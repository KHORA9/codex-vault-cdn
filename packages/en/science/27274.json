During the last few years,\r\nhowever, owing to the greatly increased interest taken in agricultural\r\neducation, the demand for agricultural scientific literature has called\r\ninto existence quite a number of new works. Despite this fact, the\r\nauthor ventures to believe that the gap which the present treatise was\r\noriginally designed to fill is still unfilled.\r\n\r\nOf the importance of the subject all interested in agriculture are well\r\naware. It is no exaggeration to say that the introduction of the\r\npractice of artificial manuring has revolutionised modern husbandry.\r\nIndeed, without the aid of artificial manures, arable farming, as at\r\npresent carried out, would be impossible. Fifty years ago the practice\r\nmay be said to have been unknown; yet so widespread has it now become,\r\nthat at the present time the capital invested in the manure trade in\r\nthis country alone amounts to millions sterling. It need scarcely be\r\npointed out, therefore, that a practice in which such vast monetary\r\ninterests are involved is worthy of the most careful consideration by\r\nall students of agricultural science, as well as, it may be added, by\r\npolitical economists.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the present work is to supply in a concise and popular form\r\nthe chief results of recent agricultural research on the question of\r\nsoil fertility, and the nature and action of various manures. It makes\r\nno pretence to be an exhaustive treatise on the subject, and only\r\ncontains those facts which seem to the author to have an important\r\nbearing on agricultural practice. In the treatment of its subject it may\r\nbe said to stand midway between Professor Storer's recently published\r\nelaborate and excellent treatise on 'Agriculture in some of its\r\nRelations to Chemistry'--a work which is to be warmly recommended to all\r\nstudents of agricultural science, and to which the author would take\r\nthis opportunity of acknowledging his indebtedness--and Dr J. M. H.\r\nMunro's admirable little work on 'Soils and Manures.'\r\n\r\nIn order to render the work as intelligible to the ordinary agricultural\r\nreader as possible, all tabular matter and matter of a more or less\r\ntechnical nature have been relegated to the Appendices attached to each\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nThe author's somewhat wide experience as a University Extension\r\nLecturer, and as a Lecturer in connection with County Council schemes of\r\nagricultural education, during the last few years, induces him to\r\nbelieve that the work may be of especial value to those engaged in\r\nteaching agricultural science.\r\n\r\nHe has to express the deep obligation he is under, in common with all\r\nwriters on Agricultural Chemistry, to the classic researches of Sir John\r\nBennet Lawes, Bart., and Sir J. Henry Gilbert, now in progress for more\r\nthan fifty years at Sir John Lawes' Experiment Station at Rothamsted.\r\nHis debt of gratitude to these distinguished investigators has been\r\nstill further increased by their kindness in permitting him to dedicate\r\nthe work to them, and for having been good enough to read portions of\r\nthe work in proof. In addition to the free use which has been made\r\nthroughout the book of the results of these experiments, the last\r\nchapter contains, in a tabular form, a short epitome of some of the more\r\nimportant Rothamsted researches on the action of different manures.\r\n\r\nTo the numerous German and French works on the subject, more especially\r\nto Professor Heiden's encyclopaedic 'Lehrbuch der Duengerlehre' and the\r\nvarious writings of Dr Emil von Wolff, the author is further much\r\nindebted.\r\n\r\nAmong English works he would especially mention the assistance he has\r\nderived from the writings of Mr R. Warington, F.R.S., Professor S. W.\r\nJohnson, Professor Armsby, the late Dr Augustus Voelcker, and others. He\r\nwould also tender his acknowledgments to the new edition of Stephens'\r\n'Book of the Farm,' and he has to thank its editor, his friend Mr James\r\nMacdonald, Secretary to the Highland and Agricultural Society of\r\nScotland, for having read parts of his proof-sheets.\r\n\r\nIt is also his pleasing duty to thank his friends Dr Bernard Dyer, Hon\r\nSecretary of the Society of Public Analysts, Dr A. P. Aitken, Chemist to\r\nthe Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland; Professor Douglas\r\nGilchrist of Bangor; Mr F. J. Cooke, late of Flitcham; Mr Hermann Voss\r\nof London; and Professor Wright of Glasgow, for having assisted him in\r\nthe revision of proof-sheets.\r\n\r\nANALYTICAL LABORATORY,\r\n128 WELLINGTON STREET, GLASGOW,\r\n_January_ 1894.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n                    PART I.--HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.\r\n                                                                     PAGE\r\n Beginning of agricultural chemistry                                    4\r\n Early theories regarding plant-growth                                  4\r\n        Van Helmont                                                     4\r\n        Digby                                                           6\r\n        Duhamel and Stephen Hales                                       8\r\n        Jethro Tull                                                     9\r\n Charles Bonnet's discovery of source of plants' carbon                11\r\n Researches of Priestley, Ingenhousz, Senebier, on assimilation\r\n   of carbon                                                        11-12\r\n Publication of first English treatise by Earl Dundonald               13\r\n Publication of Theodore de Saussure, 'Chemical Researches on\r\n   Vegetation,' 1804                                                   14\r\n Theories on source of plant-nitrogen                                  15\r\n        Early experiments on this subject                              16\r\n Sir Humphry Davy's lectures (1802-1812)                               17\r\n State of agricultural chemistry in 1812                               17\r\n Beginning of Boussingault's researches (1834)                         21\r\n Publication of Liebig's first report to the British Association       24\r\n        Refutation of \"humus\" theory                                   26\r\n        Liebig's mineral theory                                        26\r\n        Liebig's theory of source of plants' nitrogen                  27\r\n Publication of Liebig's second report to British Association          30\r\n        Liebig's services to agricultural chemistry                    31\r\n Development of agricultural research in Germany                       32\r\n The Rothamsted Experiment Station                                     33\r\n Sir J.

While it is true we have many old\r\nspeculations on the subject, they can scarcely be said to possess much\r\nscientific value. The great questions which had first to be solved by\r\nthe agricultural chemist were,--What is the food of plants? and,--What\r\nis the source of that food? The second of these two questions more\r\neasily admitted of answer than the first. The source of plant-food could\r\nonly be the atmosphere or the soil. As the composition of the\r\natmosphere, however, was not discovered till the close of last century,\r\nand the chemistry of the soil is a question which is still requiring\r\nmuch work ere we shall be in possession of anything like a full\r\nknowledge of it, it will be at once obvious that the very fundamental\r\nconditions for a solution of the question were awanting. The beginning,\r\nthen, of a true scientific agricultural chemistry may be said to date\r\nfrom the brilliant discoveries associated with the names of Priestley,\r\nScheele, Lavoisier, Cavendish, and Black--that is, towards the close of\r\nlast century.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Early Theories on Source of Plant-food._\r\n\r\nWhile this is so, and while we must regard the early attempts made\r\ntowards solving this question as being, for the most part, of little\r\nscientific value, it is not without interest, from the historical point\r\nof view, to glance briefly at some of these old interesting\r\nspeculations.\r\n\r\nThe Aristotelian doctrine, regarding the possibility of dividing matter\r\ninto the so-called four primary elements, _fire_, _air_, _earth_, and\r\n_water_, which obtained in one form or another till the birth of modern\r\nchemistry, had naturally an important influence on these early theories.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Van Helmont's Theory._\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest and most important attempts made to solve the problem\r\nof plant-growth was that by Jean Baptiste Van Helmont, one of the best\r\nknown of the alchemists, who flourished about the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth century. Van Helmont believed that he had proved by a\r\nconclusive experiment that all the products of vegetables were capable\r\nof being generated from water. The details of this classical experiment\r\nwere as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"He took a given weight of dry soil--200 lb.--and into this soil he\r\nplanted a willow-tree that weighed 5 lb., and he watered this carefully\r\nfrom time to time with pure rain-water, taking care to prevent any dust\r\nor dirt falling on to the earth in which the plant grew. He allowed this\r\nto go on growing for five years, and at the end of that period, thinking\r\nhis experiment had been conducted sufficiently long, he pulled up his\r\ntree by the roots, shook all the earth off, dried the earth again,\r\nweighed the earth and weighed the plant. He found that the plant now\r\nweighed 169 lb. 3 ounces, whereas the weight of the soil remained very\r\nnearly what it was--about 200 lb. It had only lost 2 ounces in\r\nweight.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe conclusion, therefore, come to by Van Helmont was that the source of\r\nplant-food was _water_.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Digby's Theory._\r\n\r\nSome fifty years later an extremely interesting book was published\r\nbearing the following title: 'A Discourse concerning the Vegetation of\r\nPlants, spoken by Sir Kenelm Digby, at Gresham College, on the 23d of\r\nJanuary 1660. (At a meeting of the Society for promoting Philosophical\r\nKnowledge by Experiments. London: Printed for John Williams, in Little\r\nBritain, over against St Botolph's Church, 1669.)' The author attributes\r\nplant-growth to the influence of a _balsam_ which the air contains. This\r\nbook is especially interesting as containing the earliest recognition of\r\nthe value of saltpetre as a manure. The following is an extract from\r\nthis interesting old work:--\r\n\r\n\"The sickness, and at last the death of a plant, in its natural course,\r\nproceeds from the want of that balsamick saline juice; which, I have\r\nsaid, makes it swell, germinate, and augment itself. This want may\r\nproceed either from a destitution of it in the place where the plant\r\ngrows, as when it is in a barren soil or bad air, or from a defect in\r\nthe plant itself, that hath not vigour sufficient to attract it, though\r\nit be within the sphere of it; as when the root has become so hard,\r\nobstructed and cold, as that it hath lost its vegetable functions. Now,\r\nboth these may be remedy'd, in a great measure, by one and the same\r\nphysick.... The watering of soils with cold hungray springs doth little\r\ngood; whereas muddy saline waters brought to overflow a piece of ground\r\nenrich it much. But above all, well-digested dew makes all plants\r\nluxuriate and prosper most. Now what may it be that endues these liquors\r\nwith such prolifick virtue? The meer water which is common to them all,\r\ncannot be it; there must be something else enclosed within it, to which\r\nthe water serves but for a vehicle. Examine it by spagyric art, and you\r\nwill find that it is nothing else than a _nitrous salt_, which is\r\ndilated in the water. It is this salt which gives foecundity to all\r\nthings: and from this salt (rightly understood) not only all vegetables,\r\nbut also all minerals draw their origine. By the help of plain\r\n_salt-peter_, dilated in water and mingled with some other fit earthy\r\nsubstance, that may familiarize it a little with the corn into which I\r\nendeavoured to introduce it, I have made the barrenest ground far out-go\r\nthe richest, in giving a prodigiously plentiful harvest. I have seen\r\nhemp-seed soaked in this liquor, that hath in due time made such plants\r\narise, as, for the tallness and hardness of them, seemed rather to be\r\ncoppice-wood of fourteen years' growth at least, than plain hemp. The\r\nfathers of the Christian doctrine at Paris still keep by them for a\r\nmonument (and indeed it is an admirable one) a plant of barley\r\nconsisting of 249 stalks, springing from one root or grain of barley; in\r\nwhich they counted above 18,000 grains or seeds of barley. But do you\r\nthink that it is barely the salt-peter, imbibed into the seed or root,\r\nwhich causeth this fertility? no: that would be soon exhausted and could\r\nnot furnish matter to so vast a progeny. The salt-peter there is like a\r\nmagnet, which attracts a like salt which foecundates the air, and gave\r\ncause to the Cosmopolite to say there is in the air a hidden food of\r\nlife.\"[3]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Duhamel and Hales._\r\n\r\nThe names of the French writer, Duhamel, and of the English, Stephen\r\nHales, may be mentioned in passing as authors of works bearing on the\r\nquestion of vegetable physiology. Both of these writers flourished about\r\nthe middle of the eighteenth century. The writings of the former\r\ncontained much valuable information on the effects of grafting, motion\r\nof sap, and influence of light on vegetable growth, and also the results\r\nof experiments which the author had carried out on the influence of\r\ntreating plants with certain substances. 'Statical Essays, containing\r\nVegetable Staticks; or an Account of some Statical Experiments on the\r\nSap of Vegetables, by Stephen Hales, D.D.' (2 vols.), was published in\r\nLondon in 1738; and contained, as will be seen from its title, records\r\nof experiments of very much the same nature as those of Duhamel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Jethro Tull's Theory._\r\n\r\nSome reference may be made to a theory which created a considerable\r\namount of interest when it was first published--viz., that of Jethro\r\nTull. The chief value of Tull's contribution to the subject of\r\nagricultural science was, that he emphasised the importance of tillage\r\noperations by putting forward a theory to account for the fact,\r\nuniversally recognised, that the more thoroughly a soil was tilled, the\r\nmore luxuriant the crops would be. As Tull's theory had a very\r\nconsiderable influence in stirring up interest in many of the most\r\nimportant problems in agricultural chemistry, and as it contained in\r\nitself much, the value of which we have only of late years come to\r\nunderstand, a brief statement of this theory may not be without\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nAccording to Tull the food of plants consists of the particles of the\r\nsoil. These particles, however, must be rendered very minute before they\r\nbecome available for the plant, which absorbs them by means of its\r\nrootlets. This pulverisation of the soil goes on in nature independently\r\nof the farmer, but only very slowly, and the farmer has therefore to\r\nhasten it on by means of tillage operations. The more efficiently these\r\noperations are carried on, the more abundant will the supply of\r\nplant-food be rendered in the soil. He consequently introduced and\r\nadvocated the system of horse-hoe husbandry. This theory, he informs us,\r\nwas suggested to him by the custom, which he had noticed on the\r\nContinent, of growing vines in rows, and hoeing the intervals between\r\nthese rows from time to time. The excellent results which followed this\r\nmode of cultivation induced him to adopt it in England for his farm\r\ncrops. He accordingly sowed his crops in rows or ridges, wide enough\r\napart to admit of thorough tillage of the intervals by ploughing as well\r\nas by hand-hoeing. This he continued until the plant had reached\r\nmaturity. As to the exact width of the interval most suitable, he made a\r\nlarge number of experiments. At first, in the cultivation of wheat, he\r\nmade this interval six feet wide; but latterly he adopted an interval of\r\nlesser width, that finally arrived at being between four and five feet.\r\nHe likewise experimented on each separate ridge as to which was the best\r\nnumber of rows of wheat to be sown, latterly adopting, as most\r\nconvenient, two rows at ten inches apart. The great success which he met\r\nwith in this system of cultivation induced him to publish the results of\r\nhis experiments in his famous work, 'Horse-Hoeing Husbandry.'\r\n\r\nWhile Tull's theory was based on principles at heart thoroughly sound,\r\nhe was carried away by his personal success into drawing unwarrantable\r\ndeductions. Thus he came to the conclusion that rotation of crops was\r\nunnecessary, provided that a thorough system of tillage was carried out.\r\nManures also, according to him, might be entirely dispensed with under\r\nhis system of cultivation, for the true function of all manures is to\r\naid in the pulverisation of the soil by fermentation.\r\n\r\nThe first really valuable scientific facts contributed to the science\r\nwere made by Priestley, Bonnet, Ingenhousz, and Senebier.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Discovery of the Source of Plants' Carbon._\r\n\r\nTo Charles Bonnet (1720-1793), a Swiss naturalist, is due the credit of\r\nhaving made the first contribution to a discovery of very great\r\nimportance--viz., the true source of the _carbon_, which we now know\r\nforms so large a portion of the plant-substance. Bonnet, who had devoted\r\nhimself to the question of the function of leaves, noticed that when\r\nthese were immersed in water bubbles were seen, after a time, to collect\r\non their surface. De la Hire, it ought to be pointed out, had noticed\r\nthis same fact about sixty years earlier. It was left to Priestley,\r\nhowever, to identify these bubbles with the gas he had a short time\r\npreviously discovered--viz., oxygen. Priestley had observed, about this\r\ntime, the interesting fact that plants possessed the power of purifying\r\nair vitiated by the presence of animal life.[4] The next step in this\r\nhighly interesting and important discovery was taken by John Ingenhousz\r\n(1730-1799), an eminent physician and natural philosopher. In 1779,\r\nIngenhousz published a work in London entitled 'Experiments on\r\nVegetables.' In it he gives the results of some important experiments he\r\nhad made on the question already investigated by Bonnet and Priestley.\r\nThese experiments proved that plant-leaves only gave up their oxygen in\r\nthe presence of sunlight. In 1782 he published another work on 'The\r\nInfluence of the Vegetable Kingdom on the Animal Creation.'[5]\r\n\r\nThe source of the gas, which Bonnet had first noticed to be given off\r\nfrom plant-leaves, Priestley had identified as oxygen, and Ingenhousz\r\nhad proved to be only given off under the influence of the sun's rays,\r\nwas finally shown by a Swiss naturalist, Jean Senebier[6] (1742-1809),\r\nto be the _carbonic acid gas_ in the air, which the plant absorbed and\r\ndecomposed, giving out the oxygen and assimilating the carbon.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Publication of First English Treatise on Agricultural Chemistry._\r\n\r\nIn 1795, a book dealing with the relations between chemistry and\r\nagriculture was published. This work was written by a Scottish nobleman,\r\nthe Earl of Dundonald, and possesses especial interest from the fact\r\nthat it is the first book in the English language on agricultural\r\nchemistry. The full title is as follows: 'A Treatise showing the\r\nIntimate Connection that subsists between Agriculture and Chemistry.'\r\n\r\nIn his introduction the author says: \"The slow progress which\r\nagriculture has hitherto made as a science is to be ascribed to a want\r\nof education on the part of the cultivators of the soil, and to a want\r\nof knowledge, in such authors as have written on agriculture, of the\r\nintimate connection that subsists between the science and that of\r\nchemistry. Indeed, there is no operation or process not merely\r\nmechanical that does not depend on chemistry, which is defined to be a\r\nknowledge of the properties of bodies, and of the effects resulting from\r\ntheir different combinations.\"\r\n\r\nIn quoting this passage Professor S. W. Johnson remarks:[7] \"Earl\r\nDundonald could not fail to see that chemistry was ere long to open a\r\nsplendid future for the ancient art that had always been and always will\r\nbe the prime supporter of the nations. But when he wrote, how feeble\r\nwas the light that chemistry could throw upon the fundamental questions\r\nof agricultural science! The chemical nature of the atmosphere was then\r\na discovery of barely twenty years' standing. The composition of water\r\nhad been known but twelve years. The only account of the composition of\r\nplants that Earl Dundonald could give was the following: 'Vegetables\r\nconsist of mucilaginous matter, resinous matter, matter analogous to\r\nthat of animals, and some proportion of oil.... Besides these,\r\nvegetables contain earthy matters, formerly held in solution in the\r\nnewly-taken-in juices of the growing vegetables.' To be sure, he\r\nexplains by mentioning in subsequent pages that starch belongs to the\r\nmucilaginous matter, and that on analysis by fire vegetables yield\r\nsoluble alkaline salts and insoluble phosphate of lime. But these salts,\r\nhe held, were formed in the process of burning, their lime excepted; and\r\nthe fact of their being taken from the soil and constituting the\r\nindispensable food of plants, his lordship was unacquainted with. The\r\ngist of agricultural chemistry with him was, that plants 'are composed\r\nof gases with a small proportion of calcareous matter; for although this\r\ndiscovery may appear to be of small moment to the practical farmer, yet\r\nit is well deserving of his attention and notice.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_De Saussure._\r\n\r\nThe year 1804 witnessed the publication of by far the most important\r\ncontribution made to the science up till this time. This was\r\n'Recherches Chimique sur la Vegetation,' by Theodore de Saussure, one of\r\nthe most illustrious agricultural chemists of the century. De Saussure\r\nwas the first to draw attention to the mineral or ash constituents of\r\nthe plant; and thus anticipate, to a certain extent, the subsequent\r\nfamous \"mineral\" theory of the great Liebig. The French chemist\r\nmaintained that these ash ingredients were essential; and that without\r\nthem plant-life was impossible. He also adduced fresh experiments of his\r\nown in support of the theory, based on the experiments of Bonnet,\r\nPriestley, Ingenhousz, and Senebier, that plants obtain their carbon\r\nfrom the carbonic acid gas in the air, under the influence of the\r\nsunlight. He was of opinion that the _hydrogen_ and _oxygen_ of the\r\nplant were, probably, chiefly derived from water. He showed that by far\r\nthe largest portion of the plant's substance was derived from the air\r\nand from water, and that the ash portion was alone derived from the\r\nsoil. To Saussure we owe the first definite statement on the different\r\nsources of the plant's food. It may be said that the lapse of nearly a\r\ncentury has shown his views to be, in the main, correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Source of Plant-nitrogen._\r\n\r\nThere was one question, which, even at that remote period in the history\r\nof the subject, engaged the attention of agricultural chemists--viz.,\r\nthe question of the source of the plant's _nitrogen_--a question which\r\nmay be fitly described at the present hour as still the burning\r\nquestion of agricultural chemistry.[8]\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was discovered that nitrogen was a constituent of the\r\nplant's substance; speculations as to its source were indulged in. The\r\nfact that the air furnished an unlimited storehouse of this valuable\r\nelement, and the analogy of the absorption of carbon (from the same\r\nsource by plant-leaves), naturally suggested to the minds of early\r\ninquirers that the free nitrogen of the air was the source of the\r\nplant's nitrogen. As, however, no direct experiments could be adduced to\r\nprove this theory, and as, moreover, nitrogen was found in the soil, and\r\nseemed to be a necessary ingredient of all fertile soils, the opinion\r\nthat the soil was the only source gradually supplanted the older theory.\r\nLittle value, however, must be attached to these early theories, as they\r\ncan scarcely be said to have been based on experiments of serious value.\r\nIndeed it may be safely affirmed, in the light of subsequent\r\nexperiments, that it was impossible for this question to be decided at\r\nthis early period, from the fact that analytical apparatus, of a\r\nsufficiently delicate nature, was then wholly unknown. Indeed it is only\r\nwithin the last few years that it has been possible to carry out\r\nexperiments which may be regarded as at all crucial. A short sketch of\r\nthe development of our knowledge of the relation of nitrogen to the\r\nplant will be given further on.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir Humphry Davy's Lectures._\r\n\r\nA series of lectures on agricultural chemistry, delivered by Sir Humphry\r\nDavy during the years 1802-1812, for the Board of Agriculture, and\r\nsubsequently published in book form in the year 1813,[9] affords us an\r\nopportunity of gauging, pretty accurately, the state of knowledge on the\r\nsubject at the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Position of Agricultural Chemistry at beginning of Century._\r\n\r\nIn his opening lecture Davy says: \"Agricultural chemistry has not yet\r\nreceived a regular and systematic form. It has been pursued by competent\r\nexperimenters for a short time only. The doctrines have not as yet been\r\ncollected into any elementary treatise, ... and,\" he adds, \"I am sure\r\nyou will receive with indulgence the first attempt made in this country\r\nto illustrate it by a series of experimental demonstrations.\"\r\n\r\nHe further on remarks: \"It is evident that the study of agricultural\r\nchemistry ought to be commenced by some general inquiries into the\r\ncomposition and nature of material bodies, and the law of their changes.\r\nThe surface of the earth, the atmosphere, and the water deposited from\r\nit, must either together, or separately, afford all the principles\r\nconcerned in vegetation, and it is only by examining the chemical\r\nnature of these principles that we are capable of discovering what is\r\nthe food of plants, and the manner in which this food is supplied and\r\nprepared for their nourishment.\"\r\n\r\nDavy goes on further to say: \"No general principles can be laid down\r\nrespecting the comparative merits of the different systems of\r\ncultivation and the various systems of crops adopted in different\r\ndistricts, unless the chemical nature of the soil, and the physical\r\ncircumstances to which it is exposed, are fully known.\"\r\n\r\nHe recognises the enormous importance of experiments. \"Nothing is more\r\nwanting in agriculture than experiments, in which all the circumstances\r\nare minutely and scientifically detailed.\"\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the composition of plants he says: \"It is evident that\r\nthe most essential vegetable substances consist of hydrogen, carbon, and\r\noxygen, in different proportions, generally alone; but in some few cases\r\ncombined as carbon and nitrogen. The acids, alkalies, earths, metallic\r\noxides, and saline compounds, though necessary in the vegetable economy,\r\nmust be considered as of less importance, particularly in their relation\r\nto agriculture, than the other principles.\"\r\n\r\nFurther on: \"It will be asked, Are the pure earths in the soil merely\r\nactive as mechanical or indirect chemical agents, or do they actually\r\nafford food to the plant?\"\r\n\r\nThis question he answers by saying that \"water, and the decomposing\r\nanimal and vegetable matter existing in the soil, constitute the true\r\nnourishment of plants; and as the earthy parts of the soil are useful in\r\nretaining water, so as to supply it in the proper proportion to the\r\nroots of the vegetables, so they are likewise efficacious in producing\r\nthe proper distribution of the animal or vegetable matter. When equally\r\nmixed with it, they prevent it from decomposing too rapidly; and by\r\ntheir means the soluble parts are supplied in proper proportions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Value of Davy's Lectures._\r\n\r\nThe chief value of these lectures is due to the fact that they form the\r\nfirst attempt to connect in a systematic manner the various scattered\r\nfacts, up to that time ascertained, and to interpret their bearing on\r\nagricultural practice. We have in them, it is true, a strange mixture of\r\nfacts belonging rather to botany and physiology than to agricultural\r\nchemistry; still they undoubtedly furnished a great impetus to inquiry,\r\nand at the same time they did much to popularise the science.\r\n\r\nBut not merely did Davy summarise and systematise the various results\r\narrived at by others, he also made many valuable contributions to the\r\nscience himself. The conclusions he drew from the results he obtained\r\nwere, no doubt, in many cases false, and in other cases exaggerated;\r\nstill the results possess a permanent interest. He may be said to have\r\nworked out many of the most important _physical_ or _mechanical_\r\nproperties of a soil, although exaggerating the importance of the\r\ninfluence of these properties on the question of fertility.[10]\r\n\r\nThese experiments had to do with the heat- and water-absorbing powers of\r\na soil. He experimented on a brown fertile soil, and a cold barren clay,\r\nand found at what rate they lost heat. \"Nothing,\" he says, \"can be more\r\nevident than that the genial heat of the soil, particularly in spring,\r\nmust be of the highest importance to the rising plant; ... so that the\r\ntemperature of the surface, when bare and exposed to the rays of the\r\nsun, affords at least one indication of the degree of the fertility.\"\r\n\r\nAgain he says: \"The power of soils to absorb water from air is much\r\nconnected with fertility.... I have compared the absorbent powers of\r\nmany soils, with respect to atmospheric moisture, and I have always\r\nfound it greatest in the most fertile soils; so that it affords one\r\nmethod of judging of the productiveness of land.\"\r\n\r\nWhere he erred was in overestimating the functions of the mechanical\r\nproperties of a soil, and in considering fertility to be due to them\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nDuring the next thirty years or so, little progress seems to have been\r\nmade in the way of fresh experimentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boussingault._\r\n\r\nIn 1834, Boussingault,[11] the most distinguished French agricultural\r\nchemist of the century, began that series of brilliant chemico-agricultural\r\nexperiments on his estate at Bechelbronn, in Alsace, the results of which\r\nhave added so much to agricultural science. It was the first instance of\r\nthe combination of \"science with practice,\" of the institution of a\r\nlaboratory on a farm; a combination peculiarly fitted to promote the\r\ninterests of agricultural science, and an example which has been since\r\nfollowed with such magnificent results in the case of Sir John Lawes's\r\nfamous Rothamsted Experiment Station, and other less known research\r\nstations.\r\n\r\nBoussingault's first paper appeared in 1836, and was entitled, \"The\r\namount of nitrogen in different kinds of foods, and on the equal value\r\nof foods founded on these data.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year following other papers were published on such subjects as\r\nthe amount of gluten in different kinds of wheat; on the meteorological\r\nconsiderations of how far various agricultural operations--such as\r\nextensive clearings of wood, the draining of large swamps,\r\n&c.--influence of climate on a country; and on experiments on the\r\nculture of the vine.\r\n\r\nBoussingault was the first observer to study the scientific principles\r\nunderlying the system of _rotation of crops_. In 1838 he published\r\nthe results of some very elaborate experiments he had carried out on\r\nthis subject. He also was the first chemist to carry out elaborate\r\nexperiments with a view to deciding the question of the assimilation by\r\nplants of free atmospheric nitrogen. His first contribution to the\r\nsubject was published in 1838, but can scarcely be regarded as\r\npossessing much scientific value, except in so far as it stimulated\r\nfurther research. Some thirteen years later he returned to this\r\nquestion; and during the years 1851-1855 carried out most elaborate\r\nexperiments, the results of which, until quite recently, were generally\r\nregarded as having, along with the experiments of Messrs Lawes, Gilbert,\r\nand Pugh, definitely settled the question.[12]\r\n\r\nIn 1839 Boussingault was elected a member of the French Institute, an\r\nhonour paid to him in recognition of his great services to agricultural\r\nchemistry.[13]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is a brief epitome of the history of the development of\r\nagricultural chemistry up to the year 1840, the year which witnessed the\r\npublication of one of the most memorable works on the subject, which has\r\nappeared during the present century--Liebig's first report to the\r\nBritish Association, a work which may be described as constituting an\r\nepoch in the history of the science. Liebig's position as an\r\nagricultural chemist was so prominent, and his influence as a teacher so\r\npotent, that a few biographical facts may not be out of place before\r\nentering upon an estimate of his work.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Liebig._\r\n\r\nLiebig was born at Darmstadt in the year 1803. He was the son of a\r\ndrysalter, and early devoted himself to the study of chemistry in the\r\nonly way at first at his disposal--viz., in an apothecary's shop. Soon\r\nfinding, however, his opportunities of study limited, he left the\r\napothecary's shop for the University of Bonn. He did not remain long at\r\nBonn, but in a short time left that university for Erlangen, where he\r\nstudied for some years, taking his Ph.D. degree in 1822. His subsequent\r\nstudies were carried on at Paris under Gay-Lussac, Thenard, Dulong, and\r\nother distinguished chemists. Through the influence of A. Humboldt, who\r\nwas at that time in Paris, and whose acquaintance he was fortunate\r\nenough to make, he was received into Gay-Lussac's private laboratory.\r\nIn 1824--that is, when he was only twenty-one years of age--he was\r\nappointed Professor _Extraordinarius_ of Chemistry at the University of\r\nGiessen. Two years later he was appointed to the post of Professor\r\n_Ordinarius_--an appointment which he held for twenty-five years. In\r\n1845 he was created Baron, and in 1852 appointed Professor at Munich. He\r\ndied in 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\n_His First Report to British Association._\r\n\r\nThe report above referred to was made by Liebig at the request of the\r\nChemical Section of the British Association. It was read to a meeting of\r\nthe Association held in Glasgow in 1840, and was subsequently published\r\nin book form, under the title of 'Chemistry in its Application to\r\nAgriculture and Physiology,' Liebig's position, past training and\r\nexperience were such as to peculiarly fit him for the part of pioneer in\r\nthe new science. As Sir J. H. Gilbert has remarked,[14] \"In the\r\ntreatment of his subject he not only called to his aid the previously\r\nexisting knowledge directly bearing upon his subject, but he also turned\r\nto good account the more recent triumphs of organic chemistry, many of\r\nwhich had been won in his own laboratory.\"\r\n\r\nIn his dedication to the British Association at the beginning of the\r\nbook, Liebig says: \"Perfect agriculture is the true foundation of all\r\ntrade and industry--it is the foundation of the riches of States. But a\r\nrational system of agriculture cannot be formed without the application\r\nof scientific principles; for such a system must be based on an exact\r\nacquaintance with the means of nutrition of vegetables, and with the\r\ninfluence of soils and actions of manure upon them. This knowledge we\r\nmust seek from chemistry, which teaches the mode of investigating the\r\ncomposition and of studying the characters of the different substances\r\nfrom which plants derive their nourishment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_His criticism of the \"Humus\" Theory._\r\n\r\nThe first subject which Liebig discusses is the scientific basis of the\r\nso-called \"humus\" theory. The humus theory seems to have been first\r\npromulgated by Einhof and Thaer towards the close of last century. Thaer\r\nheld that humus was the source of plant-food. He stated in his published\r\nwritings that the fertility of a soil depended really upon its humus;\r\nfor this substance, with the exception of water, is the only source of\r\nplant-food. De Saussure, however, by his experiments--the results of\r\nwhich he had published in 1804--had shown the fallacy of this humus\r\ntheory; and his statements had been further developed and substantiated\r\nby the investigations of the French chemist Braconnot and the German\r\nchemist Sprengel. Despite, however, the experiments of Saussure,\r\nBraconnot, and Sprengel, the belief that plants derived the\r\ncarbonaceous portion of their substance from humus still seemed to be\r\ncommonly held in 1840.\r\n\r\nWhile Liebig, therefore, can scarcely be said to have been the first to\r\ncontrovert the humus theory, he certainly dealt it its death-blow. He\r\nreasserted de Saussure's conclusions, and by some simple calculations\r\nshowed very clearly that it was wholly untenable. One of the most\r\nstriking of the arguments he brought forward was the fact that the humus\r\nof the soil itself consisted of the decayed vegetable matter of\r\npreceding plants. This being so, how, he asked, could it be the original\r\nsource of the carbon of plants? To reason thus was simply to reason in a\r\ncircle. He pointed out, further, that the comparative insolubility of\r\nhumus in water, or even in alkaline solutions, told against its\r\nacceptance as correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n_His Mineral Theory._\r\n\r\nHaving thus controverted the humus theory, he then goes on to deal with\r\nthe question of the source of the various plant constituents. In\r\ntreating of the relation of the soil to the plant, he puts forward his\r\n\"mineral\" theory. It cannot be doubted that, while the advance of\r\nscience since Liebig's time has induced us to considerably modify his\r\nmineral theory, it contained the statement of one of the most important\r\nfacts in the chemistry of plant physiology. He was the first to fully\r\nestimate the enormous importance of the mineral portion of the plant's\r\nfood, and point the way to one of the chief sources of a soil's\r\nfertility. Up to this period the ash constituents had been generally\r\nconsidered to be of minor importance. By emphasising the contrary\r\nopinion, and insisting upon their essentialness to plant-life, he gave\r\nto agricultural research a fresh impetus upon the right lines. His\r\nstatement of his mineral theory was in the main true, but was not the\r\nwhole truth.\r\n\r\nDe Saussure, as has already been pointed out, to a certain extent,\r\nanticipated Liebig's mineral theory. He was of the opinion that whatever\r\nmight be the case with some of the mineral constituents of plants,\r\nothers were necessary, inasmuch as they were always found in the ash. Of\r\nthese he instanced the alkaline phosphates. \"Their small quantity does\r\nnot indicate their inutility,\" he sagaciously remarks. Sir Humphry Davy,\r\nas has already been pointed out, missed recognising the true importance\r\nof the ash constituents. It was left to Liebig, then, to restate the\r\nimportant doctrine of the essentialness of the mineral matter, already\r\nimplied to some extent by de Saussure.\r\n\r\nLiebig says: \"Carbonic acid, water, and ammonia are necessary for the\r\nexistence of plants, because they contain the elements from which their\r\norgans are formed; but other substances are likewise necessary for the\r\nformation of certain organs destined for special functions, peculiar to\r\neach family of plants. Plants obtain these substances from inorganic\r\nnature.\"\r\n\r\nWhile insisting on the importance of the mineral constituents, he did\r\nso in a more or less general way not sufficiently distinguishing one\r\nmineral constituent from another.\r\n\r\nAs all plants contained certain organic acids, and as these organic\r\nacids were nearly always found in a neutral state--_i.e._, in\r\ncombination with bases, such as potash, soda, lime, and magnesia--the\r\nplant must be in a position to take up sufficient of these alkaline\r\nbases to neutralise these acids. Hence the necessity of these mineral\r\nconstituents in the soil. According to him, however, the exact nature of\r\nthe bases was a point of not so much importance. He assumed, in short,\r\nas has been pointed out by Sir J. H. Gilbert, a greater amount of mutual\r\nreplaceability amongst the bases than can be now admitted.\r\n\r\nPassing on to a consideration of the difference of the mineral\r\ncomposition of different soils, he attributes this to the difference in\r\nthe rocks forming the soils. \"Weathering\" is the great agent at work in\r\nrendering available the otherwise locked-up stores of fertility. He\r\nattributes the benefits of fallow exclusively to the increased supply of\r\nthese incombustible compounds which were thus rendered available to the\r\nplant. Treating of this subject, he says: \"From the preceding part of\r\nthis chapter\" (in which he has been explaining weathering) \"it will be\r\nseen that fallow is that period of culture when the land is exposed to\r\nprogressive disintegration by the action of the weather, for the purpose\r\nof liberating a certain quantity of alkalies and silica, to be absorbed\r\nby future plants.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_His Theory of Manures._\r\n\r\nTreating of manures, he showed how the most important constituents of\r\nmanures were _potash_ and _phosphates_. In the first edition of his work\r\nhe also insisted on the value of _nitrogen_ in manures, condemning the\r\nwant of precautions, in the treatment of animal manures, against loss of\r\nnitrogen.\r\n\r\nIn the later editions of his work he seems to have receded from that\r\nopinion, and considered that there was no necessity for supplying\r\nnitrogen in manures, since the ammonia washed down in rain was a\r\nsufficient source of all the nitrogen the plant required. It was here\r\nthat Liebig went astray, first in denying the importance of supplying\r\nnitrogen as a manure; and secondly, in overestimating the amount of\r\nammonia washed down in rain, which has subsequently been shown to be\r\nentirely inadequate to supply plants with the whole of their\r\nnitrogen.[15]\r\n\r\n\r\n_His Theory of Rotation of Crops._\r\n\r\nIn explaining the benefits of the rotation of crops, Liebig propounded a\r\nvery ingenious theory, but one which was largely of a speculative\r\nnature, and which has since been shown to be unfounded on any scientific\r\nbasis. It was to the effect that one kind of crop excreted matters which\r\nwere especially favourable to another kind of crop. He did not say\r\nwhether he considered such excretion positively injurious to the crop\r\nwhich excreted them; but he inferred that what was excreted by the crop\r\nwas what was not required, and what could, therefore, be of little\r\nbenefit to a crop of the same nature following it.\r\n\r\nThe second portion of Liebig's report dealt with the processes of\r\nfermentation, decay, and putrefaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Publication of Liebig's Second Report to British Association._\r\n\r\nIn 1842 Liebig contributed his second famous report to the British\r\nAssociation, subsequently published under the title of 'Animal\r\nChemistry; or, Organic Chemistry in its Applications to Physiology and\r\nPathology.' The publication of this report created even greater interest\r\nthan the publication of his first work. In it he may be said to have\r\ncontributed as much to animal physiology, as, in his first, he did to\r\nagricultural chemistry. His subsequent principal works on agricultural\r\nchemistry were--'Principles of Agricultural Chemistry,' published in\r\n1855, and 'On Theory and Practice in Agriculture,' 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Liebig's services to Agricultural Chemistry._\r\n\r\nAn attempt has been made to sketch in the very briefest manner some of\r\nthe main points in Liebig's teaching, as contained in his famous report\r\nto the British Association in 1840. Agricultural chemistry up till that\r\nyear can scarcely be described as having a distinct existence as a\r\nbranch of chemistry. Much valuable work, it is true, had already been\r\ndone, especially by his two great predecessors, de Saussure and\r\nBoussingault; but it was, down to the year 1840, a science made up of\r\nisolated facts. Liebig's genius formed it into an important branch of\r\nchemistry, supplied the necessary connection between the facts, and by a\r\nseries of brilliant generalisations formed the principles upon which all\r\nsubsequent advance has been built.\r\n\r\nAs has already been indicated, Liebig's chief claim to rank as the\r\ngreatest agricultural chemist of the century does not rest upon the\r\nnumber or value of his actual researches, but on the formative power he\r\nexercised in the evolution of the science. His master-mind surveyed the\r\nwhole field of agricultural chemistry, and saw laws and principles where\r\nothers saw simply a confusion of isolated, and, in many cases, seemingly\r\ncontradictory facts.\r\n\r\nBut great as the direct value of Liebig's work was, it may be questioned\r\nwhether its indirect value was not even greater. The publication of his\r\nfamous work had the effect of giving a general interest to questions\r\nwhich up till then had possessed a special interest, and that for\r\ncomparatively few. Both on the Continent and in England a very large\r\namount of discussion took place regarding his various theories.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Development of Agricultural Research in Germany._\r\n\r\nIt was especially in Germany, however, that Liebig's work bore its\r\ngreatest and most immediate fruit. Thanks to the great chemist, the\r\nGerman Government recognised the importance of forwarding scientific\r\nresearch by State aid. Agricultural Departments were added to some of\r\nthe universities, largely at State expense, while agricultural research\r\nstations were, one after another, instituted in different parts of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe first of the agricultural research stations to be founded was the\r\nnow famous one of Moeckern, near Leipzig. It was instituted in the year\r\n1851. Others followed, until at the present day there are some seventy\r\nto eighty of these _Versuchs-Stationen_ scattered throughout Germany,\r\nall well equipped and doing excellent work. Some idea of the activity of\r\nthe German stations may be inferred when it is stated that up to the\r\nyear 1877 the total number of papers embodying the results of their\r\nexperiments published by them amount to over 2000.[16]\r\n\r\nTo trace the development of agricultural chemistry, subsequent to\r\nLiebig's time, in the way it has been done prior to the year 1840, is no\r\nlonger possible. This is due to the enormous increase in the number of\r\nworkers in the field, as also to the overlapping nature of their work,\r\nwhich renders a strict chronological record wellnigh an impossibility.\r\nIt will be better, therefore, to attempt to give a brief statement of\r\nour present knowledge on the subject, naming the chief workers in the\r\nvarious departments of the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Rothamsted Experiments._\r\n\r\nBefore doing so, it is fitting that reference should be made to the work\r\nand experiments of two living English chemists, who have done much to\r\ncontribute to our knowledge in every branch of the science--viz., Sir\r\nJohn Lawes, Bart., and Sir J. H. Gilbert, F.R.S.\r\n\r\nThe fame of the Rothamsted experiments is now world-wide; and no single\r\nexperiment station has ever produced such an amount of important work as\r\nthe magnificently equipped research station at Rothamsted. The\r\nRothamsted station may be said to date from 1843, although Sir John\r\nLawes was engaged in carrying out field experiments for ten years\r\nprevious to that date.[17] In 1843 Sir John Lawes associated with\r\nhimself the distinguished chemist Sir J. H. Gilbert, and the numerous\r\npapers since published have almost invariably borne the two names. The\r\nexpense of working the station has been borne entirely by Sir John Lawes\r\nhimself; who has further set aside a sum of L100,000, the Laboratory,\r\nand certain areas of land, for the continuance of the investigations\r\nafter his death. The fields under experimentation amount to about fifty\r\nacres. By a Trust-deed, which was signed on February 14, 1889, Sir John\r\nLawes has made over the Rothamsted Experimental Station to the English\r\nnation, to be managed by trustees.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to enter, in any detail, into the nature and scope of\r\nthe Rothamsted experiments.[18] It may be stated that, since the year\r\n1847, some eighty papers have been published on field experiments, and\r\nexperiments on vegetation; while thirty papers have been published\r\nrecording experiments on the feeding of animals.[19]\r\n\r\nWhat has all along characterised these valuable experiments has been\r\ntheir practical nature. While their aim has been entirely scientific,\r\nthe scale of the experiments and the conditions under which they have\r\nbeen carried out, have been such as to render them essentially\r\n_technical_ experiments. For this reason their results possess, and will\r\nalways possess, a peculiar interest for every practical farmer.\r\n\r\nThe greatest services the Rothamsted experiments have rendered\r\nagricultural chemistry have been the valuable contributions they have\r\nmade to our knowledge of the function of nitrogen in agriculture; its\r\nrelation in its different chemical forms to plant-life; and the sources\r\nof the nitrogen found in plants. Researches of a most elaborate nature\r\nhave been carried out on what is still one of the most keenly debated\r\nquestions of the present hour--viz., the relation of the \"free\" nitrogen\r\nin the atmosphere to the plant. Of the very highest value also have been\r\nthe elaborate researches of Mr R. Warington, F.R.S., on the important\r\nquestion of _Nitrification_, which have been in course in the Rothamsted\r\nLaboratory for the last fifteen years, and to which full reference will\r\nbe made in the chapter on Nitrification.\r\n\r\nTo the Rothamsted experiments also we owe the refutation of Liebig's\r\nmineral theory. In fact it may safely be said that no experimenters in\r\nthe field of agricultural chemistry have made more numerous or valuable\r\ncontributions to the science than these illustrious investigators.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Review of our present Knowledge of Agricultural Chemistry._\r\n\r\nSome attempt may now be made to indicate briefly our present knowledge\r\nof the more important facts regarding plant physiology, agronomy, and\r\nmanuring.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Proximate Composition of the Plant._\r\n\r\nThe great advance made in the direction of the improvement of the\r\naccuracy of old analytical processes and the discovery of numerous new\r\nones have furnished us with elaborate analyses of the composition of\r\nplants. We now know that the plant-substance is made up of a large\r\nnumber of complex organic substances, formed out of carbon, hydrogen,\r\noxygen, and nitrogen,[20] and that these substances form, on an average,\r\nabout 95 per cent of the dry vegetable matter; the other 5 per cent\r\nbeing made up of mineral substances. As to the source of these different\r\nsubstances, our knowledge is, on the whole, pretty complete. With regard\r\nto the carbon of green-leaved plants, which amounts to from 40 to 50 per\r\ncent, subsequent research has confirmed Senebier and de Saussure's\r\nconclusions, that its source is the carbonic acid gas of the air. The\r\ndecomposition of the carbonic acid gas is effected by the leaves under\r\nthe influence of sunlight. That a certain quantity of carbon may be\r\nobtained from the carbonic acid absorbed by plant-roots, is indeed\r\nprobable. Especially during the early stages of plant-growth this source\r\nof carbon may be of considerable importance. Generally speaking,\r\nhowever, it may be said of all green-leaved plants, that the chief\r\nsource of their carbon is the carbonic acid gas in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Carbon Fixation by Plants._\r\n\r\nThe exact way in which this decomposition of carbonic acid gas is\r\neffected by the leaves is not yet clear. It seems to be directly\r\ndependent, in some way or other, on the chlorophyll, or green colouring\r\nmatter. This decomposition of carbonic acid, and the fixation of the\r\ncarbon by the plant with the formation of starch, takes place only under\r\nthe influence of sunlight. During the night a reflex action takes place,\r\nwhich is commonly known as _respiration_, and which is exactly analogous\r\nto animal respiration.[21] The rate at which the fixation of carbon\r\ntakes place depends on the strength of the sun's rays. It seems to take\r\nplace very rapidly under a strong tropical sun.[22] The action of\r\nsunlight on the absorption of carbon has been studied by a number of\r\nobservers, among others by Sachs, Draper, Cloez, Gratiolet, Caillet,\r\nPrillieux, Lommel, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Action of Light on Plant-growth._\r\n\r\nExperiments made by several observers, more especially Pfeffer, have\r\nshown that the yellow rays of the solar spectrum are the most potent in\r\ninducing this decomposition.\r\n\r\nSome interesting experiments have been carried out by different\r\nobservers on the possibility of growing plants under the influence of\r\nartificial light. While it would seem that the light from oil-lamps or\r\ngaslight is unable to promote growth, except in very exceptional cases,\r\nthe electric light, or other strong artificial light, seems to be\r\ncapable of taking the place of sunlight. Heinrich was the first to show\r\nthat sunlight could be replaced by the magnesium light.\r\n\r\nExperiments with the electric light have been carried out by\r\nHerve-Mangon in France and Dr Siemens in England. The plants grown under\r\nthe influence of the electric light were observed to be of a lighter\r\ngreen colour than those grown under normal conditions, thus indicating a\r\nfeebler growth; in fact, Siemens was of the opinion that the electric\r\nlight was about half as effective as daylight.[23]\r\n\r\nThese experiments are interesting from an industrial point of view; for\r\nit is conceivable that at some distant time electricity might be called\r\nto the aid of the agriculturist.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Source of Plants' Oxygen._\r\n\r\nWith regard to the source of the oxygen, which, next to carbon, is the\r\nelement most largely present in the plant's substance--amounting to,\r\nroughly speaking, about 40 per cent--all evidence seems to indicate that\r\nit is chiefly derived from water, which is also the source of the\r\nplant's hydrogen. In addition to water, carbonic acid and nitric acid\r\nmay also furnish small quantities. It has been pretty conclusively\r\nproved that the atmospheric oxygen, while necessary to plant-growth, and\r\npromoting the various chemical vital processes, is not a direct source\r\nof the plant's oxygen. The important function played by atmospheric\r\noxygen in certain stages of the plant's growth has been long recognised.\r\nMalpighi, nearly two hundred years ago, observed that for the process of\r\ngermination atmospheric air was necessary; and shortly after the\r\ndiscovery of the composition of the air was made, oxygen was identified\r\nas the important gas in promoting this process. Oxygen is also\r\nespecially necessary during the period of ripening.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Source of Plants' Hydrogen._\r\n\r\nHydrogen, which amounts to about 6 per cent, is, as has already been\r\npointed out, chiefly derived from water. It is possible that ammonia\r\nalso may form a source.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Source of Plants' Nitrogen._\r\n\r\nWhen we come to treat of the source of the nitrogen, which is found in\r\nthe plant's substance to an extent varying from a fraction of a per cent\r\nto about 4 per cent, we enter on a much more debated question.\r\n\r\nWhat is the source, or, what are the sources, of plant-nitrogen? is a\r\nquestion to the solution of which more time and more research have been\r\ndevoted than to the solution of any other question connected with\r\nagricultural chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious source is the free nitrogen, which forms four-fifths of\r\nthe atmospheric air. Reference has already been made to this\r\nquestion.[24] Priestley was the first of the long list of experimenters\r\non this interesting question.\r\n\r\nAs far back as 1771 he affirmed that certain plants had the power of\r\nabsorbing free nitrogen; and this opinion he supported by the results of\r\ncertain experiments he had made on the subject. Eight years\r\nlater,--viz., in 1779--Ingenhousz further supported this conclusion, and\r\nstated that all plants could absorb, within the space of a few hours,\r\nnoticeable quantities of nitrogen gas. The first to oppose this theory\r\nwas de Saussure, who, in 1804, carried out experiments which showed that\r\nplants were unable to utilise free nitrogen.\r\n\r\nSubsequent experiments, carried out by Woodhouse and Senebier, supported\r\nde Saussure's conclusions. Mention has already been made of\r\nBoussingault's elaborate researches on the subject.[25] His first\r\nexperiments were carried out in 1838. He concluded that plants did not\r\nabsorb free nitrogen. Georges Ville was the first to reassert the older\r\ntheory, put forward by Priestley and Ingenhousz. His opinion was founded\r\non experiments he had carried out during the years 1849-52. The subject\r\ncreated so much interest at the time, that a committee of the French\r\nAcademy--consisting of Dumas, Regnault, Peligot, Chevreul, and\r\nDecaisne--were appointed to investigate Ville's experiments. The result\r\nof the investigation of the Commission was to confirm Ville's\r\nexperiments. It is a significant fact, however, that the plant\r\nexperimented with by the Commission was _cress--a non-leguminous\r\nplant_. It has been commonly assumed that the results of recent\r\nexperiments have confirmed Ville's experiments. It is only proper to\r\npoint out that this is not a necessary inference. The assimilation of\r\nfree nitrogen by the _leguminosae_, so far as modern research has\r\nrevealed, only takes place under the influence of micro-organic life.\r\nVille's experiments, however, were supposed to be conducted under\r\n_sterilised_ conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the results of Boussingault's second series of\r\nexperiments, carried out between the years 1851 and 1855, were\r\npublished, and confirmed his earlier experiments.\r\n\r\nThe results of a large number of experiments subsequently carried out\r\nwere in support of Boussingault's conclusions. Among them may be\r\nmentioned Mene, Harting, Gunning, Lawes, Gilbert and Pugh, Roy,\r\nPetzholdt, and Bretschneider.\r\n\r\nSuch an amount of overwhelming evidence might naturally have been\r\nregarded as conclusively proving that the free nitrogen of the air is\r\nnot an available source of nitrogen to the plant. The question, however,\r\nwas not decided. In 1876 Berthelot reopened it. From experiments he had\r\ncarried out, he concluded that free nitrogen was fixed by various\r\norganic compounds, under the influence of silent electric discharges. In\r\n1885 he carried out further experiments, from which he concluded that\r\nargillaceous soils had the power of fixing the free nitrogen of the\r\natmosphere. This they effected, he was of opinion, through the agency of\r\nmicro-organisms. Schloesing has recently shown that this fixation of\r\nfree nitrogen by soils is extremely doubtful.[26] The gain of nitrogen\r\nobserved under such conditions can be explained by the absorption by the\r\nsoil of combined nitrogen--viz., ammonia--from the air.\r\n\r\nBerthelot's early experiments in 1876 had the effect of stimulating a\r\nnumber of other experiments, with the result that we now possess the\r\nsolution of this long-debated and most important problem.\r\n\r\nThe names of the better known investigators on this subject, in addition\r\nto Berthelot's, are those of Hellriegel, Wilfarth, Deherain, Joulie,\r\nDietzell, Frank, Emil von Wolff, Atwater, Woods, Nobbe, Ward, Breal,\r\nBoussingault, Wagner, Schultz-Lupitz, Fleischer, Pagnoul, Schloesing,\r\nLaurent, Petermann, Pradmowsky, Beyrenick, Lawes, and Gilbert.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to enter into the details of these most important\r\nexperiments. An attempt may be made, instead, briefly to epitomise them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Recent Experiments on Nitrogen question._\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it may be asked, How is it possible that the\r\nprevious elaborate experiments, published prior to 1876, should now\r\nprove unreliable? A satisfactory explanation may be found in the fact,\r\nas Lawes and Gilbert have recently pointed out, that the fixation of the\r\nfree nitrogen by the plant, or within the soil, takes place, if at all,\r\nthrough the agency of electricity or of micro-organisms, or of both.\r\nThe earlier experiments, however, were so arranged as to exclude the\r\ninfluence of either of those agencies.\r\n\r\nThe question has further been limited in its scope. It is now supposed\r\nthat only plants of the _leguminous_ order have the power of drawing\r\nupon the free atmospheric nitrogen. Of the experiments above referred\r\nto, those of Hellriegel and Wilfarth are the most striking and\r\nimportant. They found in their experiments, that while the legumes have\r\nthe power of obtaining their nitrogen from the air, cereals have not.\r\nSimilar experiments by Atwater in America, and others, support this\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nTheir conclusions may be briefly epitomised as follows:--\r\n\r\n(_a_) That the leguminous plants--such as peas, &c.--have the power of\r\ndrawing their nitrogen supplies from the free nitrogen of the air in a\r\nway not possessed by other plants; and that they thus possess two\r\nsources of nitrogen--the soil and the air.\r\n\r\n(_b_) That this absorption of free nitrogen is not effected directly by\r\nthe plant, but is the result, so to speak, of the joint action of\r\ncertain micro-organisms present in certain soils and in the plant\r\nitself, (_symbiosis_).\r\n\r\n(_c_) That this fixation is connected with the formation of minute\r\ntubercles on the roots of the plants of the leguminous class; and that\r\nthese tubercles may be the home of the fixing organism.\r\n\r\n(_d_) That these fixing micro-organisms are not present in all\r\nsoils.[27]\r\n\r\nWhile the relation of free nitrogen to the plant has long been, and\r\nstill is, a very obscure problem, it was early recognised that the\r\ncombined nitrogen present in soils and manures was an important source\r\nof plant-food. Reference has already been made to the early theory of\r\nSir Kenelm Digby regarding the value of nitrates.[28] De Saussure, as we\r\nhave also already seen, was fully impressed with the importance of\r\napplying nitrogen to the soil as a manure. Liebig's early attitude on\r\nthis question was to the effect, that to apply nitrogen in manures was\r\nquite unnecessary, as the plant had a sufficient source in the ammonia\r\npresent in the air, which he erroneously supposed was sufficient in\r\nquantity to supply all the needs of the crops. Despite this early\r\nrecognition of the value of combined nitrogen to the plant, it is only\r\nof recent years that we have obtained any definite knowledge as to the\r\nrespective value of its different compounds as manures, or as to the\r\nform in which it is assimilated by the plant. It exists in three\r\nforms--(1) as organic nitrogen; (2) as ammonia salts; (3) as nitrates\r\nand nitrites. Much experimental work has during late years been devoted\r\nto studying the comparative action and merits of these three forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relation of Organic Nitrogen to the Plant._\r\n\r\nFirst, as to the relation of organic nitrogen to the plant. There is a\r\nlarge number of different organic compounds which contain nitrogen. That\r\nthe plant is able to assimilate certain of these organic compounds,\r\nseems, from several experiments, to be extremely probable. From certain\r\nresearches, carried out as far back as the year 1857, Sir Charles\r\nCameron concluded that the plant could assimilate one of them--viz.,\r\n_urea_. From what, however, we have subsequently learned regarding the\r\nprocess of \"nitrification,\" it is quite probable that the nitrogen in\r\nthese experiments was first converted into nitrates before being\r\nassimilated. At any rate, as the plants were not tested for urea, the\r\nexperiments must be regarded as leaving the problem unsolved.\r\n\r\nOther experiments were carried out of a similar nature by Professor S.\r\nW. Johnson, the different kinds of nitrogen experimented with being\r\n_uric acid_, _hippuric acid_, and _guanine_. But here, again, no\r\ndefinite conclusion can be drawn, as no analyses were made of the\r\nplants. More recently, however, Dr Hampe has carried out experiments\r\nwith _urea_, _uric acid_, _hippuric acid_, and _glycocoll_. These\r\nexperiments may be held as demonstrating the fact that at least one\r\norganic compound of nitrogen is capable of being assimilated, as urea\r\nwas actually identified as being present in the plants experimented\r\nwith. From further experiments, carried out by Dr Paul Wagner and\r\nWolff, _glycin_, _tyrosin_, and _kreatin_ are able to be assimilated by\r\nthe plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plants able to absorb certain Forms of Organic Nitrogen._\r\n\r\nWe may conclude, then, from these interesting experiments, that plants\r\nare able to absorb certain organic forms of nitrogen. That they do so in\r\nnature to any extent is extremely improbable, such organic forms of\r\nnitrogen being rarely present in the soil, or if present, being\r\nconverted into ammonia or nitrate salts before assimilation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nature of Humus in the Soil._\r\n\r\nWhile on the subject of organic nitrogen, reference may be briefly made\r\nto that substance known as _humus_,--the name applied to the organic\r\nportion of soils,--a substance which figures so largely in early\r\ntheories of plant-nutrition. The most elaborate investigation of the\r\ncomposition of humus has been carried out by Mulder. According to\r\nMulder, it is composed of a number of organic bodies, and he has\r\nidentified the following substances--ulmin, humin, ulmic, humic, geic\r\nacids, &c. These bodies are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen,\r\nwhich are invariably associated with nitrogen. Detmer and Simon have\r\nfurther investigated the subject. The true function of humus, it would\r\nseem, in addition to its numerous mechanical properties, is to furnish,\r\nby its decomposition, carbonic acid and nitrogen--in the form of\r\nammonia and nitric acid--to the soil; the former acting as a solvent of\r\nthe mineral food, the latter as the source of the plant's nitrogen. The\r\nold theory, therefore, that the presence of humus in a soil is a\r\ncondition of fertility, is not so far removed from the truth. Where\r\nthere is an abundance of humus in the soil there is likely also to be an\r\nabundance of nitrogen.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relation of Ammonia to the Plant._\r\n\r\nIt seems to be beyond doubt that nitrogen is directly absorbed by plants\r\nin the form of ammonia. Liebig, as we have seen, concluded that this was\r\nthe great source of nitrogen for the plant, and that the ammonia\r\ncompounds present in the air were an all-sufficient supply. Subsequent\r\nresearch, while confirming his belief so far as regards the capability\r\nof plants to assimilate nitrogen in the form of ammonia, has proved that\r\nthe amount of ammonia present in the air is very minute, and utterly\r\ninadequate to supply the plant with the whole of its nitrogen.\r\nInvestigations have been made on this subject by Graeger, Fresenius,\r\nPierre, Bineau, and Ville. According to Ville's researches, which are\r\namong the most recent, the amount does not exceed 30 _parts per thousand\r\nmillion parts of air_.[29] Some conception of the value of this source\r\nof nitrogen may be gained by estimating the quantity falling, dissolved\r\nin rain, on an acre of soil throughout the year. Various estimations of\r\nthe total amount of combined nitrogen, which is in this way brought to\r\nthe soil, have been made. A certain amount of discrepancy, it is true,\r\nis to be found in these various estimations, no doubt largely due to the\r\ndifference in the circumstances under which the investigations were\r\ncarried out. Mr Warington has made several investigations at Rothamsted,\r\nand, according to his most recently published figures, the total\r\nquantity only amounts to 3.37 lb. per acre per annum--of which only 2.53\r\nlb. is as ammonia itself.[30]\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned, there can be little doubt that plants can absorb\r\nnitrogen in the form of ammonia. The question of how far plant-leaves\r\nare able to absorb ammonia is a much debated one. It is probable that if\r\nthey can do so, it is only to a very small extent.[31] The question as\r\nto whether the plant's roots can absorb ammonia or not, is also a very\r\nkeenly debated one. The point is a very difficult one to decide, and is\r\nmuch complicated by the consideration that ammonia, when applied to the\r\nthe soil, is so speedily converted into nitric acid. Despite, however,\r\nthese difficulties, and the vast amount of controversy on the point, the\r\nexperiments of Ville, Hosaeus and Lehmann, seem to indicate beyond doubt\r\nthat ammonia is a direct source of nitrogen. Lehmann's experiments would\r\nseem, further, to indicate that there are certain periods of a plant's\r\ngrowth when its preference for ammonia salts seems to be greater than at\r\nother times. The point, however, it must be confessed, is still an\r\nobscure one. The great difficulty in deciding it, as has just been said,\r\nlies in the fact that ammonia salts, when applied to a soil, are, by the\r\nprocess of nitrification, converted into nitrates. In experimenting,\r\ntherefore, with ammonia, and noting the results, it is wellnigh\r\nimpossible to say, except by subsequent analyses, whether the nitrogen\r\nin the ammonia salts has not been converted into nitrates before\r\nassimilation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relation of Nitric Acid to the Plant._\r\n\r\nThirdly, as to nitrogen in the form of nitrates. While it is true that\r\nplants can absorb nitrogen in certain organic forms and as ammonia\r\nsalts, it is now a well-known fact that the chief, and by far the most\r\nimportant, source of nitrogen is nitric acid. Probably more than 90 per\r\ncent of the nitrogen absorbed by green-leaved plants from the soil is\r\nabsorbed as nitrates. The tendency of all nitrogen compounds in the soil\r\nis towards conversion into nitric acid. It is the final form of nitrogen\r\nin the soil. The precise method in which this conversion takes place is\r\na discovery of only a few years' standing. The great economic importance\r\nof this discovery, made by the French chemists Schloesing and Muentz, and\r\nassociated in this country with the names of Warington, Munro, and P. F.\r\nFrankland, is only gradually being appreciated. It is without doubt one\r\nof the most interesting made in the domain of agricultural chemistry of\r\nlate years.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nitrification._\r\n\r\nIt was in the year 1877 that the two French chemists above referred to\r\npublished the results of some experiments they had carried out, which\r\nproved that nitrification--the name given to the process by which\r\nammonia or other nitrogen salts are converted in the soil into nitric\r\nacid--was due to the action of micro-organic life.\r\n\r\nThe basis of the theory rests upon the fact that dilute solutions of\r\nammonia salts or urine, containing all the necessary constituents of\r\nplant-food, if previously sterilised, may be kept for an indefinitely\r\nlong period of time, provided the air supplied be filtered through\r\ncotton wool,--so as to prevent the entrance of micro-organisms--without\r\nany formation of nitrates. Introduce, however, into such a solution a\r\nlittle fresh soil, and nitrification will soon follow.\r\n\r\nThe conditions under which the nitrification ferment acts, as well as\r\nthe nature of the ferment, or rather ferments, have subsequently been\r\ncarefully studied by Schloesing and Muentz, Winogradsy, Deherain,\r\nKellner, and other Continental observers, and especially by Warington,\r\nMunro, and P. F. Frankland in this country. These conditions cannot be\r\ngone into here. They will be fully discussed in the chapter on\r\nNitrification. Briefly stated, they are a certain range of temperature\r\n(between slightly above freezing-point and 50 deg. C., the maximum activity\r\ntaking place, according to Schloesing and Muentz, at about 30 deg. C.); a\r\nplentiful supply of atmosphere oxygen (hence the fact observed by\r\nWarington, that nitrification is chiefly limited to the surface-soil); a\r\ncertain amount of moisture; and the presence of certain of the necessary\r\nmineral plant constituents, and the presence of carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\nThe light which these discoveries throw upon the extremely complicated\r\nquestion of the fertility of the soil is considerable, as it follows\r\nthat no soil can be regarded as really a fertile one in which the\r\nprocess of nitrification does not freely take place. They furthermore\r\nexplain many facts, hitherto observed but not well understood, with\r\nregard to the action of different nitrogenous manures.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ash Constituents of the Plant._\r\n\r\nWe now come to consider the present state of our knowledge on the\r\nessentialness of the ash or mineral portion of the plant. While a\r\nportion of the plant's substance which, up to Liebig's time, had\r\nobtained little notice, it has, since the publication of his famous\r\n\"mineral\" theory, obtained an ever-increasing amount of investigation.\r\n\r\nUp till 1800 practically nothing was known of the function of the ash\r\nconstituents. In 1802 de Saussure wrote that it was unknown whether the\r\nconstituents of many plants were due to the soils on which they grew, or\r\nwhether they were the products of vegetable growth. Some two years\r\nlater, however, he was enabled to carry out a number of experiments\r\nwhich really placed the subject on a firm scientific basis. The\r\nessentialness of the ash constituents was only, however, placed beyond\r\nall doubt by Wiegmann and Polstorff's researches, carried out in 1840.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the great stimulus given to research\r\nby the promulgation of Liebig's mineral theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Methods of Research._\r\n\r\nIn epitomising the vast amount of work carried on since 1840, with the\r\nview of ascertaining the essentialness of the various substances found\r\nin the ash of plants, two methods of experimentation have been\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Artificial Soils._\r\n\r\nThe first of these two methods was that adopted in the famous\r\nexperiments, carried out by Prince Salm-Horstmar, which have done so\r\nmuch to further our knowledge on this question. It consisted in growing\r\nplants on an artificial soil--formed out of sugar-charcoal, pulverised\r\nquartz or purified sand--to which were added the different food\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Water-culture._\r\n\r\nWhile the results obtained by Prince Salm-Horstmar by this method were\r\nof a most valuable nature, subsequent experimenters have abandoned his\r\nmethod for the other method--viz., \"water-culture.\" The medium used in\r\nthis process is pure water; and it is from experiments carried out in\r\nwater-culture that much of our present knowledge, in regard to the\r\nrelation of the ash constituents to the plant, is due.\r\n\r\nThe names of those who have worked in this department are very numerous.\r\nAmong them may be mentioned Knop, Sachs, Stohmann, Nobbe, Rautenberg,\r\nKuehn, Lucanus, W. Wolff, Hampe, Beyer, E. Wolff, P. Wagner,\r\nBretschneider and Lehmann. The results obtained by these and other\r\nexperimenters have demonstrated the following facts.\r\n\r\nThe substances which have been found in the ash of plants are: _potash_,\r\n_soda_, _lime_, _magnesia_, _oxide of iron_, _oxide of manganese_,\r\n_phosphoric acid_, _sulphuric acid_, _silica_, _carbonic acid_,\r\n_chlorine_, _lithia_, _rubidia_, _alumina_, _oxide of copper_,\r\n_bromine_, _iodine_, and occasionally even other substances. Of these,\r\nhowever, only six are probably absolutely necessary for\r\nplant-growth--viz., _potash_, _lime_, _magnesia_, _oxide of iron_,\r\n_phosphoric acid_, and _sulphuric acid_. Three other substances seem\r\nalso to be almost invariably present, and may possibly be essential--in\r\nvery minute quantities at any rate--viz., _chlorine_, _soda_, and\r\n_silica_. With regard to _alumina_ and _oxide of copper_, these\r\nconstituents must be regarded as accidental; while _iodine_ and\r\n_bromine_ only occur in the ash of marine plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Method of Absorption of Plant-food._\r\n\r\nA department of vegetable physiology which has had much work devoted to\r\nit is the method in which plant-roots absorb their food. The plant's\r\nnourishment is absorbed in solution by means of the roots. Its\r\nabsorption takes place, according to Fischer and Dutrochet, who have\r\ninvestigated the subject at great length, by the process known as\r\n_endosmosis_. It has also been established by numerous experiments, that\r\ndifferent plants require different constituents in different\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Water as a Carrier of Plant-food._\r\n\r\nThe function performed by water, as the carrier of plant-food, and the\r\nmotion of the sap of the plant, are questions which have also received\r\nmuch attention. The motion of the plant's sap seems to have attracted a\r\ngreat deal of attention at a very early stage of the study of plant\r\nphysiology. As far back as 1679, Marriotte studied it. Among other old\r\nexperimenters were Hales, Guettard, Senebier, Saint-Martin, de Candolle,\r\nand Miguel. In more recent times, it has been investigated by Schuebler,\r\nLawes and Gilbert, Knop, Sachs, Unger, and Hosaeus. Some idea of the\r\nenormous amount of water transpired by plant-leaves may be gained by the\r\nstatement that from 233 lb. to 912 lb. of water are transpired for every\r\npound of plant-tissue formed.[32]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Agronomy._\r\n\r\nWhen we come to deal with questions relating to the chemistry of the\r\nsoil, we find that so much investigation has been devoted to this one\r\nbranch of agricultural chemistry as to constitute it a special branch by\r\nitself--known in France under the name of _agronomie_--and being taught\r\nin the large agricultural colleges by special professors of the subject.\r\nThe value of studying the properties of soils was recognised at an early\r\nperiod. This study was for long largely confined to their _physical_,\r\nor, what are popularly known as their _mechanical_ properties. Thus Sir\r\nHumphry Davy ascertained many important facts with regard to the heat\r\nand water absorbing and retaining properties of soils.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Retention by Soil of Plant-food._\r\n\r\nIt was not till a later period that the power soils possess of fixing\r\nfrom their watery solutions various plant-foods, both organic and\r\ninorganic, was discovered. The earliest recognition of this most\r\nimportant property of soils was made by Gazzeri, who, in 1819, called\r\nattention to the fact that the dark fluid portion of farmyard manure was\r\npurified on passing through clay. He concluded that soils, more\r\nespecially clayey soils, possessed the property of being able to fix\r\nfrom their watery solutions the necessary plant-food constituents, and\r\nfix them beyond risk of loss, only affording a gradual supply to the\r\nplant as required.\r\n\r\nThe first experiments carried out on this subject were those by Huxtable\r\nand Thompson in 1850. The liquid portion of farmyard manure was filtered\r\nthrough soil and subsequently examined, when it was found to have not\r\nonly lost its colour, but also to have lost its smell. Ammonia and\r\nammonia salts were also experimented with, and it was found that soils\r\npossessed the power of fixing ammonia.\r\n\r\nTo Thomas Way, however, we are indebted for the most valuable\r\ncontribution on this important subject made by any one single\r\ninvestigator. His experiments were not merely carried out with regard\r\nto ammonia, but also with regard to other bases--such as potash, lime,\r\nmagnesia, soda, &c. Since Way's experiments much work has been done by\r\nLiebig, Stohmann, Henneberg, and Heiden, as also by Voelcker, Eichhorn,\r\nKnop, Rautenberg, Pochwissnew, Warington, Beyer, Bretschneider, Sestini,\r\nLaskowsky, Strehl, Pillnitz, Peters, W. Wolff, Lehmann, and Biedermann.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bases and Acids fixed by Soil._\r\n\r\nFrom these experiments it may be taken as proved beyond doubt that soils\r\nhave the power of fixing, to a greater or less extent, the following\r\nbases: ammonia, potash, lime, magnesia and soda; as well as the two\r\nacids, phosphoric and silicic. The order in which the different bases\r\nare fixed is an important point. It would seem that the soil has a\r\ngreater affinity for the more valuable manurial substances, such as\r\nammonia, potash, and lime, and that these substances are first fixed.\r\nThat in fixing any one of the above-mentioned bases from its solution,\r\nit can only do so at the expense of another base. Thus, in fixing\r\npotash, either lime, magnesia, or soda must be given up. Further, when a\r\nbase in solution, as sulphate or chloride, is absorbed by a soil, the\r\nbase is alone fixed, while the sulphuric acid or chlorine is left in\r\nsolution. Lastly, the amount of base absorbed by a soil depends on the\r\nconcentration of its solution, on the nature of its combination, and the\r\ntemperature. Way found in his experiments that a clay soil has more\r\npower than a peaty soil, and that a peaty soil has more power than a\r\nsandy soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Causes of this Fixation._\r\n\r\nSo much for the fact of soil absorption; as to the cause or causes of\r\nthis absorption, a great number of theories have been put forward. Those\r\nmay be divided into two classes--those accounting for it as due to\r\nphysical properties of the soil; and those, on the other hand,\r\nexplaining it as due to chemical action.\r\n\r\nTo the latter class Way's belonged. He explained it as due to the\r\nformation in the soil of hydrated double silicates, consisting of a\r\nsilicate of alumina, along with a silicate of the base fixed. Bruestlein\r\nand Peters, on the other hand, were of the opinion that it was purely\r\nphysical in its nature. A theory has been advanced that it is due to the\r\nformation of insoluble ulmates and humates, formed by the union of ulmic\r\nand humic acids, along with the bases fixed. Among others who devoted\r\ninvestigation to this interesting question, may be mentioned Rautenberg\r\nand Heiden.\r\n\r\nOn reviewing the evidence, it seems to be pretty well established that\r\nit really is mainly a chemical act, due chiefly to the formation of\r\ndouble silicates, and doubtless to a certain extent to the formation of\r\ninsoluble humates and ulmates. Heiden's experiments would seem to\r\nindicate, however, that it is also partly of a physical nature.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the absorption of phosphoric acid, this has been shown to\r\nbe a chemical act, and depends on the formation of insoluble phosphates\r\nof calcium, iron, aluminium, and magnesium, the percentage of iron\r\nespecially determining this.\r\n\r\nMuch analytical work has been accomplished of late years with a view of\r\nascertaining the amount of ash in different kinds of plants, and in the\r\ndifferent parts of the plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Action of Manures._\r\n\r\nThe department of agricultural chemistry which has been most largely\r\ndeveloped of late years is that connected with the problems of\r\n_manuring_. It is, from a practical point of view, of most value. It is\r\nsome considerable time since we have recognised that the only three\r\ningredients it is, as a rule, expedient to apply as artificial manures,\r\nare _nitrogen_, _phosphoric acid_, and _potash_. The nature, mode of\r\naction of the different compounds, and properties of these three\r\nsubstances, and their comparative influence in fostering plant-growth,\r\ntogether with the economic question of which form is, under various\r\ncircumstances, the most economical for the farmer to use, have together\r\ngiven rise to a large number of \"field\" and \"pot\" experiments. As the\r\nprinciples underlying this practice form the subject of the following\r\ntreatise, any further discussion of the question must be left to the\r\nfollowing chapters.\r\n\r\n    _Note._--The reader interested in the historical development of\r\n    agricultural chemistry is referred to Sir J. H. Gilbert's\r\n    Presidential Address to the Chemical Section of the British\r\n    Association, 1880.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The History of the Chemical Elements. By Sir Henry E. Roscoe, F.R.S.\r\n(Wm. Collins, Sons, & Co.)\r\n\r\n[2] Van Helmont's science was, however, of an extremely rudimentary\r\nnature, as may be evidenced by the belief he entertained that the smells\r\nwhich arise from the bottom of morasses produce frogs, slugs, leeches,\r\nand other things; as well as by the following recipe which he gave for\r\nthe production of a pot of mice: \"Press a dirty shirt into the orifice\r\nof a vessel containing a little corn, after about twenty-one days the\r\nferment proceeding from the dirty shirt, modified by the odour of the\r\ncorn, effects a transmutation of the wheat into mice.\" The crowning\r\npoint in this recipe, however, lay in the fact that he asserted that he\r\nhad himself witnessed the fact, and, as an interesting and corroborative\r\ndetail, he added that the mice were born full-grown. See 'Louis Pasteur:\r\nHis Life and Labours.' By his Son-in-law. Translated by Lady Claud\r\nHamilton. (Longmans, Green, & Co.) P. 89.\r\n\r\n[3] He then goes on to relate a number of experiments by Cornelius\r\nDrebel and Albertus Magnus, showing the refreshing power of this balsam,\r\nand then those of Quercitan with roses and other flowers, and his own\r\nwith nettles.\r\n\r\n[4] Priestley, however, did not realise that _carbonic acid gas_ was a\r\nnecessary plant-food; on the contrary, he considered it to have a\r\ndeleterious action on plant-growth. Percival was really the first to\r\npoint out that carbonic acid gas was a plant-food.\r\n\r\n[5] It is recorded as an instance of the scientific enthusiasm of the\r\nman, that he was wont to carry about with him bottles containing oxygen,\r\nwhich he had obtained from cabbage-leaves, as also coils of iron wire,\r\nwith which he could illustrate the brilliant combustion which ensued on\r\nburning the latter in oxygen gas.\r\n\r\n[6] For a full account of Senebier's researches, see 'Physiologie\r\nvegetale, contenant une description des organes des plantes, et une\r\nexposition des phenomenes produits par leur organisation, par Jean\r\nSenebier.'

(London, 1831.)\r\n\r\n[10] This department of agricultural research was subsequently carried\r\non by Sprengel, Schuebler, and others.\r\n\r\n[11] Born in Paris, 1802; died 11th May 1887.\r\n\r\n[12] See p. 40.\r\n\r\n[13] While much of Boussingault's work was carried out previous to the\r\nyear 1840, he continued to enrich agricultural chemistry with numerous\r\nvaluable contributions up till the time of his death. It may be well\r\nhere to mention the names of his most important contributions to\r\nagricultural science, made subsequent to 1840.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 he published, in a work entitled 'Economie Rurale,' the results\r\nof his numerous experiments and researches. This work is well known to\r\nEnglish agriculturists from an English translation which appeared in\r\n1845 (Boussingault's 'Rural Economy,' translated by G. Law. H. Balliere,\r\nLondon).\r\n\r\nIn 1860 appeared the first volume of his last great work, 'Agronomie\r\nChimie Agricole et Physiologie' This work, which consisted of seven\r\nvolumes, was not finished till 1884. He died on the 11th of May 1887. It\r\nmay be added that the Royal Society of London awarded him the Copley\r\nmedal in 1887.\r\n\r\n[14] See British Association Proceedings, 1880, p. 511.\r\n\r\n[15] It may be pointed out that, while the amount of ammonia washed down\r\nby the rain is small, Schloesing has found in some recent experiments\r\nthat a damp soil may absorb from the air in the course of a year 38 lb.\r\nof combined nitrogen, chiefly ammonia, per acre. See p. 132.\r\n\r\n[16] The example, set by Germany, has been followed by other countries\r\nin which well-equipped research stations now exist. Perhaps the most\r\nstriking example of the rapid development of the means of agricultural\r\nresearch is furnished by the United States of America. At present over\r\nfifty agricultural experiment stations, more or less well equipped,\r\nexist at present in that country, all liberally supplied by State aid.\r\nThe earliest to be founded, it may be added, was that at Middletown,\r\nConnecticut, the date of its institution being 1875.\r\n\r\n[17] It may thus claim to be the second oldest experimental station,\r\nthat instituted by Boussingault at Bechelbronn in Alsace being the\r\noldest.\r\n\r\n[18] For an account of the Rothamsted experiments, and a short biography\r\nof Sir John Lawes, the reader is referred to a pamphlet by the present\r\nwriter, entitled 'Sir J. B. Lawes, Bart., LL.D., F.R.S., and the\r\nRothamsted Experiments' ('Scottish Farmer' Office, 93 Hope Street,\r\nGlasgow).\r\n\r\n[19] Of these numerous elaborate experiments, perhaps those which have\r\nattracted the most widespread interest amongst agriculturists have been\r\nthose carried out on the growth of wheat on the same land year after\r\nyear for a period of nearly fifty years. The important light which this\r\nseries of experiments has thrown upon the theory of the rotation of\r\ncrops, and the subject of the manuring of cereals, is very great.\r\n\r\n[20] Associated in some cases with phosphorus and sulphur.\r\n\r\n[21] It must be pointed out that plant-respiration does not take place\r\n_only_ during the night-time. It probably goes on at all times, but it\r\nis only during the night-time that its action is apparent, as the\r\nreverse process of carbon assimilation, which goes on at an incomparably\r\ngreater rate, masks its action during the daytime.\r\n\r\n[22] The length of the day has an important influence on plant-growth,\r\nas is evidenced by the rapid growth of vegetation in Norway and Sweden.\r\nIn these countries there is a late spring, and a short and by no means\r\nhot summer, but a very long period of daylight.\r\n\r\n[23] A point of great interest which these experiments elucidated is\r\nthat nocturnal repose is not absolutely necessary for the growth and\r\ndevelopment of all plants.\r\n\r\n[24] See pp. 15 and 22.\r\n\r\n[25] See p. 22.\r\n\r\n[26] See Chapter III., pp. 120 and 131.\r\n\r\n[27] Further reference is made to this subject in Chapter III., p. 136.\r\n\r\n[28] See p. 6.\r\n\r\n[29] See Phil. Trans., Part II., 1861, pp. 444-446. Lawes & Gilbert.\r\nSchloesing has found in the air in the neighbourhood of Paris 1 lb. of\r\nammonia in 26,000,000 cubic yards; while Muentz found only about half\r\nthat amount in a similar quantity of air on the top of the Pic du Midi.\r\n\r\n[30] See Chapter III., pp. 119, 120; Appendix, p. 155.\r\n\r\n[31] Some recent experiments by Dyer and Smetham would seem to show that\r\ncomparatively small quantities of ammonia in the air prove actually\r\nhurtful to plant-life. Thus they found that one volume of ammonia in\r\n1000 volumes of air was fatal to hardy plants; while one volume in 3000\r\nvolumes killed tender ones.\r\n\r\n[32] According to the experiments of Hellriegel and Wollny. The\r\nquantity, it may be added, varies with the leaf-surface and the length\r\nof the period of growth of the plant. It is greatest with clovers and\r\ngrasses, and least in the potatoes and roots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPLES OF MANURING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nFERTILITY OF THE SOIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to clearly understand to what the fertility of a soil is\r\ndue ere we can hope to master the theory of manuring.\r\n\r\n\r\n_What constitutes Fertility in a Soil._\r\n\r\nThe question, What constitutes fertility in a soil? is by no means an\r\neasy one to answer. If we say, The presence of a plentiful supply of the\r\nconstituents which form the plant's food, our answer will be incomplete.\r\nSimilarly, if we reply, A certain physical condition of the soil--here,\r\nagain, it will be found equally unsatisfactory; for fertility of a soil\r\ndepends both on its physical condition and on its chemical composition,\r\nand indeed even on other circumstances. It may be well, then, before\r\nproceeding to treat of the nature and action of the different manures,\r\nto offer a brief statement of the conditions of fertility so far, at any\r\nrate, as we at present know them. For it may be well to warn the reader\r\nthat, despite the great amount of work carried out on this subject by\r\nexperimenters, we still have much to learn before we shall be in a\r\nposition fully and clearly to understand the subject of soil-fertility\r\nin all its bearings.\r\n\r\nApart altogether from the influence exerted by climate, latitude,\r\naltitude, and exposure, the fertility of a soil may be said to depend on\r\nthe following properties. These we may divide into three groups or\r\nclasses:--\r\n\r\n1. Physical or mechanical.\r\n2. Chemical.\r\n3. Biological.\r\n\r\n\r\n=I. Physical Properties of a Soil.=--The physical properties of a soil\r\nare generally admitted to have a very important bearing on its\r\nfertility. This has been long practically recognised, and perhaps has in\r\nthe past been unduly exalted in importance, at the expense of the no\r\nless important functions of the chemical.[33] The reason of this is\r\ndoubtless to be ascribed to the fact that it is much easier to study\r\nthe physical properties of a soil than it is to study the chemical; and\r\nthat, while we are in possession of a very large amount of useful\r\ninformation with regard to the former, we are at present only on the\r\nthreshold of our knowledge of the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Variety of Soils._\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of common observation that soils differ widely in their\r\nmechanical nature. The early recognition of this fact is evidenced by\r\nthe large number of technical terms which have been long in vogue among\r\nfarmers descriptive of these differences. Thus soils are in the habit of\r\nbeing described as \"heavy,\" \"light,\" \"stiff,\" \"strong,\" \"warm,\" \"cold,\"\r\n\"wet,\" \"damp,\" \"peaty,\" \"clayey,\" \"sandy,\" \"loamy,\" &c., &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Absorptive Power for Water._\r\n\r\nOne of the most important of the physical properties of a soil is its\r\npower to absorb water.\r\n\r\nWater to the plant economy is just as important and necessary as it is\r\nto the animal economy. Consequently it is of primary importance to\r\nexamine into the conditions which regulate the absorption of this\r\nimportant plant-food by the soil.\r\n\r\nBy the absorptive power of a soil is meant its capacity for drinking in\r\nany water with which its particles may come in contact. This power\r\ndepends, first, on the predominance of its proximate constituents--viz.,\r\n_sand_, _clay_, _carbonate of lime_, and _humus_; and secondly on the\r\nfineness of the soil-particles.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Absorptive Power of Sand, Clay, Humus._\r\n\r\nFirst, then, with regard to the absorptive power of sand, clay, and\r\nhumus. Of these, sand possesses this power to the least extent, clay to\r\na greater extent, while humus possesses it most of all.[34]\r\n\r\nThe extent, therefore, of the absorptive power of a soil depends very\r\nmuch on the proportions in which it possesses these three ingredients.\r\nThe more sandy a soil is, the less will its power be of absorbing water;\r\nand this, there is little doubt, is one of the reasons why a sandy soil\r\nis, as a rule, an unfertile soil. Of course there are other and even\r\nmore important reasons; but that this absorptive power has an important\r\nbearing on the question is conclusively proved by the fact that sandy\r\nsoils are more fertile in a climate where rain is frequent than in one\r\nwhere much dry weather prevails. The incapacity of a sandy soil to\r\nabsorb a large quantity of moisture is not fraught with such evil\r\neffects to the crops in the former case, because it is counteracted by\r\nthe climatic conditions, which obviate the necessity, in a soil, of\r\npossessing great absorptive powers.\r\n\r\nThe converse, of course, we may mention in passing, holds good of clayey\r\nsoils.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fineness of Soil-particles._\r\n\r\nThe second quality in a soil on which its absorptive power depends is\r\nthe fineness of its particles. The great benefit which a soil derives\r\nfrom a good tilth, in this respect, was one of the reasons why Tull's\r\nsystem of horse-hoeing husbandry was so successful in its results.[35]\r\nThe finer the soil-particles, it may be said generally, the greater is\r\nthe absorptive power of the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Limit to Fineness._\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a limit to the fineness to which the particles of a\r\nsoil ought to be reduced; for it has been found by experiment that when\r\na certain degree of fineness is reached, the absorptive power decreases\r\nwith any further pulverisation. A German experimenter found, for\r\nexample, that a garden loam, capable of absorbing 114 per cent of water\r\nin its natural state, when pulverised very fine was able to absorb only\r\n62 per cent of water. Here, clearly, the limit to which it is advisable\r\nto pulverise a soil had been exceeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reason of the above._\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to see why this should be so. The amount of water\r\nthat a soil can soak up is due to the number of pores, or air-spaces, it\r\ncontains of a certain size. If these pores are large and few in number,\r\nthe amount of water absorbed will be naturally less than when they are\r\nnumerous and smaller in size. Up to a certain extent, the more a soil is\r\nbroken the greater will be the number of pores created, of a size to\r\npermit the water to soak in. Beyond that point the pores become too\r\nminute, and the soil becomes too compact, each particle clinging\r\ntogether too closely.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Retentive Power of Soils for Water._\r\n\r\nNow closely connected with this absorptive power of soils, which we have\r\njust been considering, is the power soils possess of holding or\r\nretaining the water they absorb. This power, it will be seen at a\r\nglance, must have an important bearing on the fertility of a soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Importance of Retentive Power._\r\n\r\nAs a considerable interval often elapses between the periods of\r\nrainfall, soils, if they are to support vegetable growth, must be able\r\nto store up their water-supply against periods of drought. This is all\r\nthe more necessary when we remember that, in the case of heavy crops,\r\nthe rainfall would often be inadequate to supply the water necessary for\r\ntheir growth. In fact, it has been estimated that the average\r\nevaporation from soils bare of any cultivation is equal to the rainfall.\r\nThat the evaporation from soils covered with vegetation is very much\r\ngreater, has been strikingly shown by a calculation made by the late\r\neminent American botanist, Professor Asa Gray, who calculated that a\r\ncertain elm-tree offered a leaf-surface, from which active transpiration\r\nconstantly went on, of some five acres in extent; while it has further\r\nbeen calculated that a certain oak-tree, within a period of six months,\r\ntranspired during the daytime eight and a half times more water than\r\nfell as rain on an area equal in circumference to the tree-top.[36] Just\r\nas the state of the fineness of the soil-particles has an important\r\ninfluence on the absorptive power of soils, so, too, it is found, it has\r\nan important bearing on the rate at which evaporation takes place.\r\nEvaporation goes on to the greatest extent in soils whose particles are\r\ncompacted together, capillary action in this case taking place more\r\nfreely, and effecting evaporation from a greater depth of soil. The\r\nstirring of the surface portion of the soil, as for example by hoeing or\r\nharrowing, has for this reason an important influence in lessening the\r\namount of evaporation, and minimising the risks of drought, by breaking\r\nthe capillary attraction. The amount of evaporation which takes place\r\nfrom a soil covered with a crop, depends largely on the nature of the\r\ncrop; a deep-rooted crop, since it draws its moisture from a wider area\r\nof soil, being more effective in drying a soil than a shallow-rooted\r\ncrop. The difference in the amounts evaporated from a cropped and a bare\r\nfallow soil has been shown at Rothamsted to equal a rainfall of nine\r\ninches, the crop being barley. The increase, of course, is due to the\r\nwater which the crop transpires.[37]\r\n\r\nIt may be generally said that the greater the absorptive power of a\r\nsoil, the greater is its retentive power; for soils that most largely\r\nabsorb water are the most reluctant to part with it.\r\n\r\nWhile these properties are undoubtedly necessary for fertile soils, it\r\nis needless to add that they may be possessed by a soil to too great an\r\nextent. The soil that is unable to throw off any excess of water becomes\r\ncold and damp, and does not admit of proper tillage. Its pores become\r\nentirely choked up, and the circulation of air, which, as we shall see,\r\nis of so much importance, is rendered impossible. Plants in such a soil\r\nare apt to sicken and die, the water becomes stagnant, and certain\r\nchemical actions are caused which give rise to poisonous gases, such as\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen, &c. A stiff clayey soil offers a good example of\r\nthe disadvantage of over-retentiveness. Owing to the difficulty such\r\nsoils experience in throwing off their excessive water, they are\r\nextremely difficult to till; and sowing operations are on that account\r\napt to be delayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Power Plants have of absorbing Water from a Soil._\r\n\r\nIt is a strange fact, and one worth noticing in this connection, that\r\nthe power plant-roots have of drawing their moisture from a soil, seems\r\nto depend on the retentive power of the soil. By this is meant that\r\nplants have not the means of exhausting the water in a retentive soil to\r\nsuch an extent as in a non-retentive soil.\r\n\r\nIn some extremely interesting experiments, carried out by the well-known\r\nGerman botanist Sachs, it was found that plants wilted in a loamy soil,\r\nwhose water-holding capacity was 52 per cent, when its moisture reached\r\n8 per cent; while in a sandy soil--water-holding capacity 21 per\r\ncent--the same species of plant did not wilt until its moisture reached\r\n1-1/2 per cent. Here, then, we see that on one kind of soil the plant\r\nwas able to live, and obtain sufficient water for its needs, while it\r\ndied of thirst in another soil, although that soil contained quite as\r\nmuch moisture.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, we may say that Hellriegel's experiments have shown\r\nthat any soil can supply plants with all the water they need so long as\r\nits moisture is not reduced below one-third of the whole amount it can\r\nhold.[38]\r\n\r\n\r\n_How to increase Absorptive Power of Soils._\r\n\r\nThe absence or presence, in excess, of the above properties, suggests a\r\nword or two on how these natural defects may, to a certain extent, be\r\nremedied artificially. It stands to reason, that if organic matter in a\r\nsoil renders its absorptive power greater, a simple method of improving\r\na soil defective in this property is by the addition of organic matter.\r\nOne of the benefits of ploughing-in green crops on sandy soils is\r\nundoubtedly due to this fact; the addition of farmyard manure having\r\nalso a similar effect. The absence of a sufficient amount of\r\nretentiveness, such as is found in sandy soils, in the same way\r\nsuggests, as a remedy, the addition of clay; and, _vice versa_, where\r\nthe soil is too clayey, the natural method of improvement will be the\r\naddition of sand.[39]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Shrinkage of Soils._\r\n\r\nIn drying, soils shrink. Those which shrink least are sandy and chalky\r\nsoils. Humus soils, on the other hand, shrink most.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Most favourable Amount of Water in a Soil._\r\n\r\nThe amount of water in a soil most favourable for plant-growth is a\r\nquestion of considerable difficulty. Too great an amount of moisture\r\nrenders the land cold; air cannot obtain access to the soil-particles,\r\nand the plants sicken and die. Hellriegel has found that as much as 80\r\nper cent of what the soil can hold is hurtful to plants, and that from\r\n50 to 60 per cent is the best amount.[40]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hygroscopic Power._\r\n\r\nA property possessed by soils in relation to water, which is quite\r\ndistinct from absorptive power, is their hygroscopic power. By this is\r\nmeant their power of absorbing water from the air where it is present in\r\nthe gaseous form. This property is identical with the property which\r\nwill be adverted to immediately--viz., capacity for absorbing gases. The\r\nextent to which soils possess this hygroscopic property seems to be\r\nregulated very much by the same conditions as regulate their ordinary\r\nabsorptive power.[41] This property is considered to be of great\r\nimportance in the case of soils in hot climates, where their\r\nagricultural value may be said to depend to a large extent upon it. The\r\namount of water, however, absorbed in this way is, comparatively\r\nspeaking, insignificant. Lastly, it may be observed that there are\r\ncertain methods of drying soils afflicted with too much moisture. These\r\nconsist in making open ditches, and thus relieving them of their\r\nsuperabundance of water, or in planting certain kinds of trees, such as\r\nwillows and poplars. The amount of green surface presented by the large\r\nnumber of leaves of trees, from which the constant evaporation of water\r\ngoes on, is very great. The consequence is that trees may be regarded as\r\npumping-engines. It is from this cause that foresters have noticed that\r\nclay lands are apt to become wetter after the trees growing upon them\r\nhave been cut down.[42]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Capacity for Heat in Soils._\r\n\r\nA property which depends largely on those we have just been considering\r\nis the capacity soils possess of absorbing and retaining heat.[43] The\r\ntemperature of a soil, of course, largely depends on the temperature of\r\nthe air; but this, we must not forget, depends also on the soil itself.\r\nThe heat given forth by the sun's rays strikes the soil, with the result\r\nthat, while so much of its heat is absorbed, a certain portion--and this\r\nwill vary according to the nature of the soil--of its heat is radiated\r\ninto the air.\r\n\r\nThe changes in the temperature of the soil naturally take place more\r\nslowly than the changes in the temperature of the air; the depth of soil\r\nthus affected by those changes varies also in different climes. It has\r\nbeen calculated that in temperate climes the changes of temperature\r\noccurring from day to night are not felt much below three feet down.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Explanation of Dew._\r\n\r\nWe have, it may be stated, generally two processes going on. During the\r\nday the soil is engaged in absorbing its heat from the sun's rays; when\r\nnight comes, and the sun goes below the horizon, the air is chilled\r\nbelow the temperature of the soil, which radiates out its stored-up heat\r\ninto the air. The result is that the temperature of the soil is soon\r\nreduced below the temperature of the air, and the moisture, present in\r\nthe air in the form of vapour, coming in contact with the cold surface\r\nof the earth, is condensed into dew, which is deposited, and is seen\r\nbest early in the morning before the sun has had time to evaporate it\r\nagain. Dew is most abundant in summer-time, for the reason that the\r\ndifference in temperature of the day and night is then greatest. In\r\nwinter-time it is seen as hoar-frost.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Heat of Soils._\r\n\r\nThe temperature of a soil, however, is due to other sources than the\r\nsun's rays. Whenever vegetable matter decays, there is always a certain\r\namount of heat generated. Soils, therefore, in which there is a large\r\namount of decaying vegetable matter, are certain to receive more heat\r\nfrom this source than soils of more purely mineral nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Heat in Farmyard Manure._\r\n\r\nA good example of the amount of heat that accompanies fermentation, or\r\ndecay of vegetable matter, is seen in the case of rotting farmyard\r\nmanure. The danger of loss of the volatile ammonia from this cause is\r\noften great, and care must be taken to prevent fermentation going on too\r\nquickly, and the temperature from becoming too high.[44] The actual\r\nincrease in the temperature of a soil effected by the addition of\r\ncertain bulky organic manures, such as farmyard manure, may thus be\r\nconsiderable. In some experiments carried out at Tokio, Japan, it was\r\nfound that the application of 20 tons of farmyard manure per acre\r\nincreased the temperature of the soil to a depth of five inches, for a\r\nperiod of nearly a month, on an average, one and a half degrees\r\nFahrenheit. The amount of water present in a soil, it may be noticed in\r\npassing, will have a considerable effect in regulating its temperature,\r\na damp soil being, as a rule, a cold soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cause of the Heat of Fermentation._\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, How is the decay, or fermentation, of vegetable matter,\r\nsuch as farmyard manure, caused? or rather, To what is it due? Decay of\r\nany substance is just its slow combustion or burning. When a substance\r\nunites with the active chemical element in air--the oxygen gas--it is\r\nsaid to be oxidised. Now, this union of a substance with oxygen is the\r\nexplanation of burning, and the phenomena of burning and decay are\r\nexplained by the same chemical operation. When bodies decay, or when\r\nthey burn, they unite with oxygen: when this union of a body and oxygen\r\ntakes place very quickly, and the result is a flame and very great heat,\r\nthen we call it burning; when, however, it takes place slowly, it is not\r\ncalled burning, but simply oxidation or decay. The ultimate products are\r\nthe same, however, whether the body burns or decays; and the process of\r\ndecay is always accompanied by heat, as well as the process of\r\nburning.[45] It is not, of course, only the vegetable or organic matter\r\nin a soil that decays, but also the mineral matter. The oxidation,\r\nhowever, of the mineral matter in the soil takes place so slowly, and\r\nthe amount of heat generated by this oxidation is so slight, that the\r\ntemperature of the soil can scarcely be said to be much affected by it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Influence of Colour of a Soil._\r\n\r\nThere is still another quality of a soil on which its temperature\r\ndepends, and that is its colour. This may seem at first sight to be\r\nscarcely worth taking into account, and yet it has been shown to have a\r\nvery striking influence on the temperature of a soil. This naturally is\r\nbest seen in climates where there is a good deal of sun. Dark-coloured\r\nsoils have a greater heat-absorbing capacity than light-coloured soils;\r\nand experiments carried out for the purpose of determining the extent of\r\nthis influence have shown that under certain conditions the difference\r\nbetween a soil covered with a black substance, and one covered with a\r\nwhite substance, amounted to from 13 deg. to 14 deg. Fahr. Other things being\r\nequal, a crop on a dark-coloured soil will be sooner ripened than one on\r\na light-coloured soil. A soil covered by a crop is cooler than one\r\nwithout any crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Power Soils have for absorbing Gases._\r\n\r\nWe have just seen that one cause of the heat of soils is the oxidation\r\nwhich is constantly going on in all soils, but more rapidly in soils\r\ncontaining a large quantity of vegetable matter. This suggests a word or\r\ntwo on the power soils have of absorbing gases.\r\n\r\nThe chief gases in the atmosphere are oxygen and nitrogen. Both these\r\ngases are absorbed by soils, although not in similar proportions.[46]\r\nWith regard to the former, it is well known that a plentiful supply of\r\noxygen in the pores of the soil is a necessary condition of fertility.\r\nThis was long ago experimentally proved by de Saussure, who showed that\r\nplants absorbed oxygen through their roots. At certain periods of their\r\ngrowth this demand for oxygen on the part of the plant is greater than\r\nat other times. For example, seeds in the process of germination require\r\nto have free access to a plentiful supply of oxygen. This fact\r\nemphasises the enormous importance of providing a good seed-bed, and of\r\nseeing that the seed is not buried too deeply.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Carbonic Acid and Ammonia._\r\n\r\nIn addition to oxygen and nitrogen, the air contains other gases which\r\nare absorbed by the soil. Of these, carbonic acid is the most abundant.\r\nBy far the largest portion of the carbonic acid which the soil obtains\r\nfrom the air, is washed down in solution in the rain.[47] Of the other\r\nconstituents of the atmosphere, the combined forms of nitrogen--viz.,\r\n_ammonia_, _nitric_, and _nitrous acids_--are the most important. These\r\nare all absorbed by the soil, but, like carbonic acid, they are chiefly\r\nwashed down by the rain. The amount of ammonia which may be absorbed by\r\na soil from the air, is very much greater than was formerly supposed.\r\nSome recent experiments by Schloesing, referred to in a following\r\nchapter,[48] show this. A damp soil may in the course of a year absorb\r\nfar more ammonia than that washed down in rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gas-absorbing Power of Soils varies._\r\n\r\nThe power of different soils to absorb these gases varies. This\r\nvariation depends not only on their physical properties, but also on\r\ntheir chemical as well. Soils containing much organic matter have a\r\ngreater capacity for absorbing gases than the more purely mineral ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Absorption of Nitrogen._\r\n\r\nThe absorption of nitrogen by the soil is a question of considerable\r\nimportance. It will be referred to later on under the heading of the\r\nbiological properties of soils, as it is fixed by the agency of\r\nmicro-organisms.[49]\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, the chief physical or mechanical properties of a soil\r\nare its absorptive and retentive powers for water; its capacity for\r\nheat; and its power of absorbing gases. It will be easily seen how\r\ntillage operations are calculated to influence these physical properties\r\nof a soil. Thus, in the case of a stiff soil, tillage increases its\r\npower for absorbing the atmospheric gases, chiefly oxygen, which are so\r\nnecessary for rendering its fertilising matters available. On the other\r\nhand, in a light and too open soil it may exert quite a contrary effect.\r\n\r\nIt may be also well to refer here to the important influence these\r\nphysical properties exercise on the growth of the plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plant-roots require a certain Openness in the Soil._\r\n\r\nOne of the functions of the soil is to support the plant in an upright\r\nposition, and this is a function which requires in the soil a certain\r\namount of compactness or firmness. On the other hand, however, a soil\r\nmust not possess too great compactness, otherwise the plant-roots will\r\nexperience a difficulty in pushing their way downwards. This is\r\nespecially the case during the earlier periods of growth, when the\r\nplant-roots are as yet extremely tender, and experience great difficulty\r\nin overcoming much resistance. The importance of preparing a mellow\r\nseed-bed will be thus at once seen to be based on sound scientific\r\nprinciples; and this for a double reason. Not only does the young plant\r\nrequire every facility for developing its roots, but also, as has just\r\nbeen pointed out, an abundant supply of oxygen is of paramount\r\nimportance during the process of germination.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Soil and Plant-roots._\r\n\r\nThe whole question of the influence of the mechanical condition of the\r\nsoil on the development of plant-roots is one of the highest importance\r\nand interest, and is not so generally recognised as it ought to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Natural tendency of Plant-roots to grow downwards._\r\n\r\nIt may be taken as certain that the tangled condition of plant-roots is\r\ndue to the resistance offered by the soil-particles, and that the\r\nnatural tendency of the plant-root is to grow downwards. The roots, in\r\nshort, would probably grow in as symmetrical a form as do the stalks or\r\nbranches, were it not that they are hindered from so doing by the\r\nsoil-particles. Where, then, the soil is such as to offer much\r\nhindrance, the growth of the plant cannot but be retarded. Some\r\nextremely interesting experiments have been performed by the eminent\r\nGerman chemist Hellriegel on the influence which the closeness of the\r\nsoil-particles has on root-development. In these experiments peas and\r\nbeans were grown in moistened sawdust, more or less compactly\r\ncompressed. It was found that when the sawdust Was compressed to any\r\nextent, plant-growth took place very slowly, or entirely ceased.\r\n\r\nThe importance of having plant-roots as widely developed in the soil as\r\npossible, will be at once seen when we reflect that this means that the\r\narea of soil from which the plant derives its soil-food is thereby\r\ngreatly increased. Another important consideration is, that the deeper\r\nplant-roots can penetrate in a soil, the more able--other conditions\r\nbeing equal--is the plant to withstand the action of drought, as it can\r\ndraw water for its needs from the deeper layers of the soil, long after\r\na plant, whose roots do not penetrate so deeply, has wilted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plants require Room._\r\n\r\nAnother important bearing tillage has on plant-growth may here be\r\ndiscussed. A problem of considerable difficulty is presented in the\r\nquestion, How many individual plants will a certain piece of soil\r\nsupport in a healthy way? For as plants require room, it is imperative\r\nthat they be not too closely crowded together.\r\n\r\nThe question resolves itself pretty much into one of quality against\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\nExperiments on this subject have shown that a certain area of soil is\r\nonly able to support the healthy growth of a certain number of plants.\r\nIf the limit be exceeded, the result is imperfect development.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Number of Plants on certain Area increased by Tillage._\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, however, that the more thoroughly tilled a soil is, the\r\ngreater will be the number of plants it will be possible to grow on it.\r\nThe roots, instead of being forced to spread themselves along the\r\nsurface-soil, and thus take up a large amount of room, will find no\r\ndifficulty in striking downwards. Two or three plants may thus be\r\nenabled to grow in a thoroughly tilled soil in the same space as only\r\none could before tillage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_American and English Farming._\r\n\r\nThe above considerations throw considerable light on what seems to many\r\nfarmers a strange anomaly--viz., the fact that the return of farm\r\nproduce per acre on American farms is, as a rule, very much less than\r\nthat from our own impoverished soils in this country. To many, at first\r\nsight, this seems to be in direct contradiction to our common belief,\r\nand to point to the conclusion that the virgin soils of America are,\r\nafter all, actually inferior in fertility to the soils of Britain.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, necessary to draw this conclusion, as the facts of\r\nthe case admit of another explanation. The inferior returns obtained\r\nfrom American farms are due, not to the fact that the American soil is\r\nless fertile than the British--for this is not true--but to the fact\r\nthat it is less _intensively_ cultivated.\r\n\r\nIn America land is cheap and labour is dear; it is consequently found to\r\nbe more economical to cultivate a large tract of land less thoroughly\r\nthan a small area more thoroughly. In Britain the reverse is the case,\r\nlabour being cheap and land being dear. It is thus necessary to make the\r\nland go as far as possible, and produce as heavy a crop as it is\r\npossible to produce. There can be little doubt, that were American\r\nfarming to be carried on as intensively as is British farming, the\r\npresent yield would be at least probably doubled.\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider the second class of properties which influence\r\nthe fertility of a soil. These are _chemical_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=II. Chemical Composition of a Soil.=--Chemically considered, the soil\r\nis a body of great complexity. It is made up of a great variety of\r\nsubstances. The relations existing between these substances and the\r\nplant are not all of equal importance; some--and these form by far the\r\nlargest proportion of the soil-substance--are concerned in acting simply\r\nas a mechanical support for the plant, and in helping to maintain those\r\nphysical properties in the soil which, as we have just seen, exercise\r\nsuch important functions in the plant's development.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fertilising Ingredients._\r\n\r\nA small portion of the soil-substance, however, takes a very much more\r\nactive part in promoting plant-growth, by acting as direct food of the\r\nplant. As we have already seen in the Introductory Chapter,[50] the\r\nsubstances which have been found in the ash of plants are the following:\r\n_potash_, _lime_, _magnesia_, _oxide of iron_, _phosphoric acid_,\r\n_sulphuric acid_, soda, silica, chlorine, oxide of manganese, lithia,\r\nrubidia, alumina, oxide of copper, bromine, and iodine. The general\r\npresence of some of these substances is doubtful; the presence of\r\nothers, again, probably purely accidental; while some are only found in\r\nplants of a special nature, as, for instance, iodine and bromine, which\r\nare only found in the ash of marine plants.\r\n\r\nOf these ash constituents, only the first six substances--those marked\r\nin italics--are absolutely necessary to plant-growth. In addition to\r\nthese six ash constituents, the plant also derives its _nitrogen_, which\r\nis a necessary plant-food, chiefly from the soil.[51]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Importance of Nitrogen, Phosphoric Acid, and Potash._\r\n\r\nBut of these seven constituents of the soil which are necessary to\r\nplant-growth, some have come to be regarded by the agriculturist with\r\nvery much greater interest than others. This is due to the fact that\r\nthey are normally present in the soil in very much smaller quantities\r\nthan is the case with the other equally necessary food ingredients;\r\nthat, in short, they are nearly invariably present in the soil, in a\r\nreadily available form, in lesser quantities than the plant is able to\r\navail itself of, and often, as in impoverished or barren soils, in\r\nquantities too small for even normal growth. These ingredients are\r\n_nitrogen_, _phosphoric acid_, and _potash_.[52]\r\n\r\nThe importance of seeing that all the necessary plant ingredients are\r\npresent in a soil in proper quantities will be at once properly\r\nestimated when it is stated that the absence or insufficiency in amount\r\nof one single ingredient is capable of preventing the growth of the\r\nplant, although the other necessary ingredients may be even abundantly\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nWith lime, magnesia, iron, and sulphuric acid, most soils are abundantly\r\nsupplied. The substances with which the farmer has to concern himself,\r\nthen, are nitrogen, phosphates, and potash. It is these substances\r\ntherefore, that, as a rule, are alone added as manures.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chemical Condition of Fertilising Ingredients in Soil._\r\n\r\nBut in considering the chemical properties of a soil, a simple\r\nconsideration of the quantity of the different ingredients present is\r\nnot enough. A very important consideration is their chemical condition.\r\nEre any plant-food can be assimilated by the plant's roots, it must\r\nfirst be rendered soluble. The quantity of soluble, or, as it is known,\r\n_available_, plant-food in a soil is very small. It is, of course, being\r\nsteadily added to each day by the process of disintegration constantly\r\ngoing on in soils.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amount of Soluble Fertilising Ingredients._\r\n\r\nThe exact nature and dissolving capacity of the soil-water, charged as\r\nit is, to a greater or less extent, with different acids and salts, as\r\nwell as the dissolving power of the sap of the rootlets of the plant\r\nitself, render the exact estimation of the available fertilising\r\nconstituents wellnigh impossible. An approximate estimate, however, may\r\nbe obtained by treating the soil with pure water and dilute acid\r\nsolutions. The treatment of the soil with dilute acid solutions is for\r\nthe purpose of simulating, as nearly as may be done, the conditions it\r\nis submitted to in the soil. By treating a soil with water, we obtain a\r\ncertain amount of plant-food dissolved in the water. This can only be\r\nregarded as indicating approximately the amount available at that moment\r\nto the plant. But every day, thanks to the numberless complicated\r\nreactions going on in the soil, this soluble plant-food is constantly\r\nbeing added to. Considerations such as the above, together with our\r\nignorance as to the exact combinations in which the necessary minerals\r\nenter the plant, will serve to indicate the great difficulty of this\r\npart of the subject.[53]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Value of Chemical Analysis of Soils._\r\n\r\nIt is largely for these reasons that a chemical analysis of a soil is\r\nfrom one point of view of little value in giving evidence of its actual\r\nfertility. What it demonstrates more satisfactorily is its potential\r\nfertility. It is useful in revealing what there is present in it, not\r\nnecessarily, however, in an available condition. Under certain\r\ncircumstances it may be made of great value, as, for example, when we\r\nare anxious to know what will be the result of certain kinds of\r\ntreatment, such as the application of lime, &c.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly advisable, therefore, to place before the reader a number\r\nof soil analyses. That he may obtain an approximate idea of the\r\ncomposition of a soil, one or two representative analyses will be found\r\nin the Appendix,[54] along with a short account of the chief minerals\r\nout of which soils are formed.\r\n\r\nA point of considerable interest is the quantity per acre different\r\nsoils contain of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash. Although the\r\namount of these ingredients when stated in percentage seems very\r\ntrifling, yet when calculated in lb. per acre, it is seen to be in large\r\nexcess of the amount removed by the different crops. This question will\r\nbe dealt with in succeeding chapters.\r\n\r\nA point of further interest is the chemical form in which the necessary\r\nplant constituents are present in the soil. For information on this\r\npoint the reader is referred to the Appendix.[55]\r\n\r\nThe third class of properties which affect the fertility of a soil are\r\nthose which have been termed the _biological_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=III. Biological Properties of a Soil.=--The important functions which\r\nmodern discoveries have shown to be discharged by minute organic life in\r\nthe terrestrial economy are nowhere more strikingly exemplified than in\r\nthe important _role_ they perform in the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bacteria of the Soil._\r\n\r\nThe soil of every cultivated field is teeming with bacteria whose\r\nfunction is to aid in supplying plants with their necessary food. The\r\nnature of, and the functions performed by, these organisms differ very\r\nwidely. Regarding many of them we know very little; every day, however,\r\nour knowledge is being extended by the laborious researches of\r\ninvestigators in all parts of the world, and it is to be anticipated\r\nthat ere long we shall be in possession of many facts regarding the\r\nnature and the method of the development of these most interesting\r\nagents in terrestrial economy. That they are present, however, in\r\nenormous numbers in all soils we have every reason to believe, one class\r\nof organism connected with the oxidation of carbonic acid gas being\r\nestimated to be present to the extent of over half a million in one\r\ngramme of soil[56] (Wollny and Adametz). One class--and their\r\nimportance is very great in agriculture--prepare the food of plants by\r\ndecomposing the organic matter in the soil into such simple substances\r\nas are easily assimilated by the plant. The so-called \"ripening\" of\r\nvarious organic fertilisers is effected, we now know, entirely through\r\nthe agency of bacteria of this class. Plant-life is unable to live upon\r\nthe complex nitrogenous compounds of the organic matter of the soil, and\r\nwere it not for bacteria these substances would remain unavailable.\r\nAttention will be drawn in the Chapter on Farmyard Manure to this\r\nquestion more in detail. Of these bacteria, among the most important are\r\nthose which are the active agents in the process known as\r\n\"nitrification\"--_i.e._, the process whereby organic nitrogen and\r\nammonia salts are converted into nitrites and nitrates. The presence of\r\nthese organisms, it would appear, is indispensable to the fertility of\r\nany soil. There are organisms, on the other hand, which have the power\r\nof reversing the work of the nitrification bacteria by converting\r\nnitrates into other forms of nitrogen. The reduction of nitrates in the\r\nsoil is often the source of much loss of valuable nitrogen, which\r\nescapes in the free state, so that the action of bacteria is not\r\naltogether of a beneficial nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Three Classes of Organisms in the Soil._\r\n\r\nSo far as the subject has been at present studied, the micro-organisms\r\nin the soil may be divided into three classes.[57]\r\n\r\n\r\n_First Class of Organisms._\r\n\r\nWe have, first of all, those whose function it is to oxidise the soil\r\ningredients. Organisms of this class may act in different ways. They may\r\nassimilate the organic matter of the soil and convert it into carbonic\r\nacid gas and water; or, on the other hand, they may oxidise it by giving\r\noff oxygen. Some of these organisms, whose action is of the first kind,\r\nchoose most remarkable materials for assimilation. One has been found to\r\nrequire ferrous carbonate for its development, which it oxidises into\r\nthe oxide (Winogradsky); while another,[58] the so-called sulphur\r\norganism, converts sulphur into sulphuretted hydrogen according to some,\r\nand according to others into sulphates. To this class of organism the\r\nnitrifying organisms belong. As will be seen more fully in a subsequent\r\nchapter, two distinct organisms connected with this process have already\r\nbeen isolated and studied--one of these effecting the formation of\r\nnitrites from organic nitrogen or ammonia salts, and the other the\r\nconversion of nitrites into nitrates. The second method in which these\r\noxidising organisms act is by giving off oxygen. There is much interest\r\nattaching to this fact, as it was supposed till quite recently that all\r\nevolution of oxygen in vegetable physiology was dependent on the\r\npresence of light, and also intimately connected with chlorophyll, or\r\nthe green colouring matter of plants. It would seem, however, that among\r\nthe soil organisms these conditions are not necessary, and the evolution\r\nof oxygen may be carried on in the case of colourless organisms as well\r\nas in the case of light. With organisms of this kind every soil is\r\nprobably teeming. A typical example is the organism which is the active\r\nagent in the oxidation of carbonic acid gas, and which has already been\r\nreferred to as existing in the soil in such numbers.[59]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Second Class of Organisms in the Soil._\r\n\r\nThe second class of organisms are those which reduce or destroy the soil\r\nconstituents. The most important of these, from the agricultural point\r\nof view, are those which effect the liberation of nitrogen from its\r\ncompounds. In the putrefaction of organic matter the organisms chiefly\r\nact, it is probable, in the entire absence of atmospheric oxygen; but\r\nit would seem, however, that they may also act in the presence of\r\noxygen. It is through their agency that the soil may lose some of its\r\nnitrogen in the \"free\" form. To this class belong the denitrifying\r\norganisms already referred to which reduce the nitrates and nitrites in\r\nthe soil.[60]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Third Class of Organisms._\r\n\r\nThe third class of organisms are those by whose agency the soil is\r\nenriched. Of this class those fixing the free nitrogen from the air are\r\nthe most important. The nature of these organisms is still somewhat\r\nobscure, but that leguminous plants have the power of drawing upon this\r\nsource of nitrogen is now a firmly established fact. Further reference\r\nto these interesting organisms may be delayed to another chapter.\r\n\r\nThe important point to be emphasised is, that for the healthy\r\ndevelopment of these organisms, which are so necessary in every fertile\r\nsoil, certain conditions must exist. These necessary conditions will be\r\ntreated more in detail later on. It is sufficient to notice that they\r\nhave to do with the physical properties as well as the chemical\r\ncomposition of the soil. This furnishes a further reason for the\r\nnecessity of having the mechanical condition of a soil satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Recapitulation._\r\n\r\nFrom what we have said, it will be seen that the question of\r\nsoil-fertility is a very complicated one, and depends on numerous and\r\nvaried conditions; that the properties which constitute fertility, while\r\nseemingly very widely different in their nature, in reality influence\r\none another to a very great extent; that not merely is the presence in a\r\nsoil of the necessary plant constituents necessary to fertility, but\r\nthat the possession by the soil of certain physical or mechanical\r\nproperties is equally necessary; while, lastly, we have seen that the\r\npresence of certain micro-organic life is bound up with the problem of\r\nfertility in a very direct and practical manner.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the conditions, other than those of a purely chemical\r\nnature, have been thus far somewhat prominently emphasised, for the\r\nreason that in what follows attention will be almost exclusively devoted\r\nto the purely chemical conditions of fertility. It is well, then, to\r\nrealise that, while the latter conditions are by far the most important,\r\nso far as the farmer is practically concerned, inasmuch as they are most\r\nunder his control, they are not the only conditions, and are not by\r\nthemselves able to control fertility.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[33] This statement perhaps needs qualification. While the important\r\n_role_ played by the physical qualities of the soil were in the early\r\nyears of the science recognised, of more recent years the chemical\r\ncomposition of the soil has been engaging almost exclusive\r\ninvestigation. Physical properties of the soil have recently acquired a\r\nfurther importance in the eyes of the agricultural chemist, from the\r\nimportant influence they exert on what we have here called the\r\nbiological properties of a soil--viz., the development of those\r\nfermentative processes whereby plant-food is prepared to a large extent.\r\n\r\n[34] A good example of the absorptive capacity of a soil containing a\r\nlarge quantity of vegetable matter is furnished by peat-bogs, which,\r\nsponge-like, can absorb enormous quantities of water. (See Appendix,\r\nNote I., p. 98.)\r\n\r\n[35] Jethro Tull, an early well-known agricultural writer, who lived\r\nabout the middle of last century, propounded the theory, that as the\r\nfood of plants consisted of the minute earthy particles of the soil, all\r\nthat was required by the skilful farmer was to see that his soil was\r\nproperly tilled. He accordingly published a work entitled 'Horse-hoeing\r\nHusbandry,' in which he advocated a system of thorough tillage. (See\r\nHistorical Introduction, p. 10.)\r\n\r\n[36] See Introduction, p. 55.\r\n\r\n[37] See Introductory Chapter, p. 55.\r\n\r\n[38] It is not exactly known why excess of water should prevent normal\r\ngrowth in the plant. Probably it is on account of the fact that free\r\naccess of oxygen is hindered in such a case. The roots are thus not\r\nfreely enough exposed to this necessary gas, and fermentative processes\r\nof the nature of nitrification are not promoted. It may be also due to\r\nthe fact that the solution of plant-food is too dilute when such excess\r\nof water prevails.\r\n\r\n[39] See Appendix, Note II., p. 98.\r\n\r\n[40] Some experiments by E. Wollny show this. He found, when\r\nexperimenting with _summer rape_, that the best results were obtained\r\nwhen the soil contained only 40 per cent of its total water-holding\r\npower; when the amount was either lessened or increased the results\r\nobtained fell off. The effect of either too little or too much water is\r\nseen in the development of the different organs of the plant as well as\r\non its period of growth, much water seeming to retard the growth. The\r\nquality of the plant seems also to be influenced by this condition.\r\nExperiments on cereal grains by Wollny show that not merely is the\r\ntexture of the grain influenced, but that much moisture lessens the\r\npercentage of nitrogen. Wollny is of the opinion that for crops\r\ngenerally, the best amount is from 40 to 75 per cent of the total\r\nwater-holding capacity of the soil.\r\n\r\n[41] See Appendix, Note III., p. 99.\r\n\r\n[42] See p. 55.\r\n\r\n[43] The effect of the temperature of the soil on the development of the\r\nplant is most important. This is especially marked at the period of\r\ngermination, but is felt at subsequent periods of growth. Up to a\r\ncertain temperature the warmer the soil the more rapid the plant's\r\ndevelopment. In this country the temperature most favourable to growth\r\nis rarely exceeded, or indeed reached.\r\n\r\n[44] See Chapter on Farmyard Manure.\r\n\r\n[45] As will be seen further on, the fermentation of organic substances\r\nis caused by the action of micro-organic life.\r\n\r\n[46] See Appendix, Note IV., p. 100.\r\n\r\n[47] Of course it must be remembered that a large amount of carbonic\r\nacid in soils comes from the decay of vegetable matter. Soils are twenty\r\nto one hundred times richer in carbonic acid than the air.\r\n\r\n[48] See Chapter III., p. 119.\r\n\r\n[49] See Introduction, p. 40.\r\n\r\n[50] See Introductory Chapter, p. 54.\r\n\r\n[51] See pp. 44 and 135.\r\n\r\n[52] Occasionally also _lime_.\r\n\r\n[53] See Appendix, Notes V. and VI., pp. 100, 101.\r\n\r\n[54] Note VI., p. 101.\r\n\r\n[55] Note VII., p. 107.\r\n\r\n[56] Even larger estimates of the number of germs in a gramme of soil\r\nhave been made--from three-quarters to one million (Koch, Fuelles, and\r\nothers).\r\n\r\n[57] These organisms consist of molds, yeast, and bacteria, the\r\nlast-named being most abundant. In the surface-soil, among the bacteria,\r\nbacilli are most abundant. Micrococei are not abundant.\r\n\r\n[58] Investigated by Winogradsky, Olivier, De Rey Pailhade, and others.\r\n\r\n[59] Organisms of this kind have been investigated among others by\r\nHeraues, Hueppe, and E. Wollny. According to the two first-mentioned\r\ninvestigators, certain colourless bacteria effect the formation in the\r\nabsence of light from humus and carbonates a body resembling in its\r\nnature cellulose.\r\n\r\n[60] Investigated by Springer, Gayon and Dupetit, Deherain, and\r\nMarguenne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE I. (p. 68).\r\n\r\nThe following determinations by Schuebler show the absorptive power of\r\ndifferent kinds of soil-substances. These were obtained by soaking\r\nweighed quantities of the soil in water, and allowing the excess of\r\nliquid to drain away, and weighing the wet earth.\r\n\r\n                        Per cent of water\r\n                        absorbed by 100\r\n                        parts of earth.\r\n\r\nSiliceous sand                 25\r\nGypsum                         27\r\nCalcareous sand                29\r\nSandy clay                     40\r\nStrong clay                    50\r\nArable soil                    52\r\nFine calcareous                85\r\nGarden-earth                   89\r\nHumus                         190\r\n\r\nIt has been calculated that the absorptive power of a mixture of\r\ndifferent substances is not simply equal to the sum of their separate\r\ningredients.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE II. (p. 74).\r\n\r\nEVAPORATION.\r\n\r\nThe retentive property of a soil for water tends to retard evaporation.\r\nThe following table by Schuebler shows the rate at which evaporation\r\nproceeds in different soils. The experiment was conducted in the\r\nfollowing way. The soil experimented upon was saturated with water and\r\nspread over a disc, and allowed to evaporate for four hours, when it was\r\nweighed. The amount of time required for the evaporation of 90 per cent\r\nof the water was also estimated. Of 100 parts of water in the wet soil\r\nthere evaporated, at 60 deg.

(p. 76).\r\n\r\nHYGROSCOPIC POWER OF SOILS.\r\n\r\nDavy found the hygroscopic power of soils to be as follows. He found\r\nthat 100 parts by weight of three samples of different sands absorbed 3,\r\n8, and 11 parts of water, respectively, in one hour; while three loams\r\nabsorbed similarly 1.3, 1.6, and 1.8 parts.\r\n\r\nThe following samples of soil were dried at 212 deg. Fahr., and exposed to\r\nan atmosphere saturated with water and a temperature of 62 deg. Fahr., when\r\nit was found they absorbed the following amounts in twelve hours'\r\ntime:--\r\n\r\nQuartz sand               0.0\r\nLimestone sand            0.3\r\nLean clay                 2.1\r\nFat clay                  2.5\r\nClay soil.                3.0\r\nPure clay.                3.7\r\nGarden-loam               3.5\r\nHumus                     8.0\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE IV. (p. 81).\r\n\r\nGASES PRESENT IN SOILS.\r\n\r\nThe air which we find enclosed in the pores of the soil is distinctly\r\n_poorer_ in oxygen than ordinary air. Boussingault found the percentage\r\nof oxygen in a sandy soil, freshly manured and wet with rain, to be as\r\nlow as 10.35 per cent; while the air in forest-soil contained 19.5 per\r\ncent of oxygen, and .93 per cent of carbonic acid. The percentage of\r\noxygen in soils depends on the rate of decay of the organic portions.\r\nThe depth of the soil-layer also determines the quantity. This is owing\r\nto the fact that diffusion takes place more slowly deep down than near\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE V. (p. 90).\r\n\r\nAMOUNT OF SOLUBLE PLANT-FOOD IN THE SOIL.\r\n\r\nTwo of the most reliable methods of ascertaining an approximation of the\r\nquantity of soluble soil constituents are (1) by treating the soil with\r\ndistilled water, and (2) by analysing the drainage-water. With regard to\r\nthe former of these two methods, it has been found that even the amount\r\nof fertilising matter dissolved out by pure distilled water varies. This\r\nvariation depends on the amount of distilled water used, as well as the\r\nlength of time the soil is left in contact with the solvent. By washing\r\nthe soil with different quantities of water, different amounts of\r\nsoluble soil ingredients will be found to have been washed out; for\r\nalthough the first washings contain by far the greater portion of the\r\nsoluble matter, each subsequent washing will be found to contain further\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\nA number of experiments have shown that 1000 parts of distilled water\r\ndissolved out from different soils from one half to one and a half parts\r\nof soluble constituents; or from .05 to .15 per cent. Of this soluble\r\nmatter from 30 to 67 per cent is mineral in its nature, and from 33 to\r\n70 per cent organic. Poor sandy soils yield the minimum quantity, while\r\npeaty soils yield the maximum. The quantity of soluble matter in a\r\nregular peaty soil may vary from .4 to 1.4 per cent; this consists\r\nchiefly, however, of organic matter. (See Johnson's 'How Crops Feed,' p.\r\n312.)\r\n\r\nPerhaps a more satisfactory method is by analysing the drainage-water of\r\na soil. This has been found to vary very considerably in composition.\r\nThe average of a large number of analyses are .04 to .05 per cent of\r\ndissolved matter. Of this dissolved matter the largest proportion is\r\nmade up of organic matter, nitric acid, lime, and soda salts. It must be\r\nborne in mind, however, that even the drainage-water does not furnish an\r\nexact indication of the amount of dissolved matter in a soil. Much,\r\nperhaps the largest proportion of dissolved matter, never finds its way\r\ninto the drainage-water. That contained by the drainage-water really\r\nrepresents the surplus quantity of dissolved matter which the soil is\r\nunable to retain, and which is thus washed by the rain into the drains.\r\nThe composition of drainage-water is interesting, as it shows that,\r\npractically speaking, all the necessary plant ingredients are in a state\r\nof solution in the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE VI. (p. 90).\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE SOIL.\r\n\r\nThe most important substances present in soils are as follows: silica,\r\nalumina, lime, magnesia, potash, soda, ferric oxide, manganese oxide,\r\nsulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, and chlorine. Of these substances the\r\npresence of alumina, silica, lime, and, in certain cases, magnesia,\r\nalong with the organic portion of the soil--the humus--has the chief\r\ninfluence in determining the nature and the physical properties of a\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nIn order to clearly understand to what it is soils owe the nature of\r\ntheir chemical composition, it is necessary to consider the composition\r\nof some of the chief minerals out of the disintegration of which soils\r\nare formed.\r\n\r\nWhile we know of some seventy elements present in the earth's crust, it\r\nis practically made up of only some sixteen. These sixteen are--oxygen,\r\nsilicon, carbon, sulphur, hydrogen, chlorine, phosphorus, iron,\r\naluminium, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, fluorine, manganese,\r\nand barium.[61] Of these, oxygen is by far the largest constituent,\r\nforming, roughly speaking, about 50 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe main mass of the rocks consists of silica, and this is generally\r\ncombined with alumina, as in clay, forming aluminium silicate, and with\r\nthe commoner alkalies and alkaline earths. Another extremely abundant\r\ncompound is carbonate of lime, which, as limestone, chalk, and marl,\r\nforms one-sixth of the earth's total rocks.\r\n\r\nThe word \"mineral\" means a definite chemical compound of natural\r\noccurrence. The number of minerals is very great, and it is impossible\r\nto go into the subject here. Reference can only be made to a few of the\r\nmore prominent ones, which are chiefly concerned in the formation of\r\nsoils.\r\n\r\nThose formed out of silicates are, from the agricultural point of view,\r\nthe most important, as they form a very large group; and it is by their\r\ndisintegration that soils are chiefly formed. They consist of silica and\r\nalumina, along with various other substances, chiefly alkalies and\r\nalkaline earths. It is important to note one peculiarity about the\r\nsolubility of silicates. We have two classes of silicates: the one,\r\nwhich is called \"acid,\" and contains an excess of silica; the other,\r\n\"basic,\" and which contains an excess of base. Now, while the former of\r\nthese is more or less insoluble, the second is soluble. This fact has an\r\nimportant signification in the process of the disintegration of the\r\nsilicate minerals we are about to consider.\r\n\r\nThe first and most important class are the _Felspars_. Felspar is not\r\nreally a definite mineral, with a definite chemical composition, but\r\nrather the name of a class of minerals of which there are several\r\ndifferent kinds. The felspars are composed of silica and alumina, along\r\nwith potash, soda, and lime, with traces of iron and magnesia. Their\r\nprincipal constituents, however, are silica and alumina, along with\r\neither potash, soda, or lime. According as the base potash, soda, or\r\nlime predominates, the felspar is known as Orthoclase, Albite, and\r\nOligoclase, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe following are the analyses of the three minerals (by the late Dr\r\nAnderson):--\r\n\r\n--------------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------\r\n                    |   Orthoclase.   |     Albite.     |    Oligoclase.\r\n                    +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n                    |   1.   |   2.   |   1.   |   2.   |   1.   |   2.\r\n--------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n Silica             |  65.72 |  65.00 |  67.99 |  68.23 |  62.70 |  63.51\r\n Alumina            |  18.57 |  18.64 |  19.61 |  18.30 |  23.80 |  23.09\r\n Peroxide of iron   | traces |   0.83 |   0.70 |   1.01 |   0.62 |   none\r\n Oxide of manganese | traces |   0.13 |   none |   none |   none |   none\r\n Lime               |   0.34 |   1.23 |   0.66 |   1.26 |   4.60 |   2.44\r\n Magnesia           |   0.10 |   1.03 |   none |   0.51 |   0.02 |   0.77\r\n Potash             |  14.02 |   9.12 |   none |   2.53 |   1.05 |   2.19\r\n Soda.              |   1.25 |   3.49 |  11.12 |   7.99 |   8.00 |   9.37\r\n--------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n                    | 100.00 |  99.47 | 100.08 |  99.83 | 100.79 | 101.37\r\n--------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n\r\nAccording as these various felspars are present in a soil, so will the\r\nquality of the soil be. It stands to reason that as the presence of\r\npotash in a soil is one of the distinguishing features of its fertility,\r\nmuch will depend on the extent to which the orthoclase felspar is\r\npresent; and also, not only on the extent, but on the state and degree\r\nof its disintegration. It is important to note the method of this\r\ndisintegration. It is effected by the absorption of water. This water is\r\nnot merely absorbed mechanically, but actually enters into the\r\ncomposition of the mineral. It is not present as moisture merely,\r\ncapable of being expelled at ordinary boiling temperature, but it forms\r\nwhat is known as water of composition. In this process of hydration, the\r\nmineral loses its lustre and crystalline appearance, crumbles away into\r\na more or less--according to its state of disintegration--powdery mass.\r\nA very great change is also effected in its chemical composition; it\r\nloses nearly all its base. This is effected in the following way. As\r\nwater enters into the mineral's composition, it sets free a certain\r\nportion of the base; there is thus formed a basic silicate, which, being\r\nsoluble in water, is washed away in solution. This change may be\r\nillustrated by quoting the analysis of a kaolin clay formed by the\r\ndisintegration of orthoclase felspar.\r\n\r\n_Kaolin Clay formed by disintegration of Orthoclase._\r\n\r\n             Silica                    46.80\r\n             Alumina                   36.83\r\n             Peroxide of iron           3.11\r\n             Carbonate of lime          0.55\r\n             Potash                     0.27\r\n             Water                     12.44\r\n                                      ------\r\n                                      100.00\r\n                                      ------\r\n\r\nThe chief difference here is the almost total loss of potash and a\r\nportion of the silica, and the gain of water. The other constituents\r\npractically remain insoluble.\r\n\r\nAnother important mineral is _Mica_. Its composition is not unlike\r\nfelspar. It contains silica, alumina, and iron, in considerable\r\nquantities, also magnesia and potash. There are two kinds of mica--that\r\ncontaining potash, and that containing magnesia, in excess. The analyses\r\nof these two kinds are as follows (by the late Dr Anderson):--\r\n\r\n                                 MICAS.\r\n                      (_a_) Potash.

These are\r\ncomposed of silica, alumina, iron oxide, manganese oxide, lime and\r\nmagnesia. These are the chief minerals out of which soils are formed. It\r\nis scarcely necessary to say that few soils are made up out of any of\r\nthese three minerals alone. Nearly all rocks are formed out of a mixture\r\nof these minerals. Where, however, any one mineral predominates over the\r\nrest, the nature of the soil will be thereby affected. In order to\r\nillustrate this, it may be well to mention the composition of one or two\r\nof the commoner rocks.\r\n\r\n1. _Granite_, which is so abundant in certain parts of the north of\r\nScotland, and which gives rise to the soils in the neighbourhood of\r\nAberdeen, is made up of a mixture of quartz, felspar, and mica. It\r\ndepends on the felspar present--_i.e._, whether it is orthoclase,\r\noligoclase, or albite--whether the soil will be rich in potash or not.\r\nGranite containing orthoclase felspar produces a fairly fertile soil. An\r\nimportant consideration, which is apt to complicate this question, is\r\nthe situation of such soils. They are generally so high above sea-level,\r\nthat their fertility is seriously impaired on these grounds.\r\n\r\n2. _Gneiss_, another common rock, is similar in composition, only that\r\nit contains very little felspar, and a correspondingly greater amount of\r\nmica.\r\n\r\n3. _Syenite_ contains quartz, felspar, and hornblende.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of which greenstone and trap are types, are found very largely\r\nscattered over the country. They are of two kinds, diorite and dolorite.\r\n\r\n4. _Limestone_ is of two great classes. We have (1) Common, (2)\r\nMagnesian. The following are the analyses of these two classes by Dr\r\nAnderson:--\r\n\r\n----------------------+---------------------------+------------------------\r\n                      |          Common.          |         Magnesian.\r\n                      +-------------+-------------+-------------+----------\r\n                      | Mid-Lothian | Sutherland. | Sutherland. | Dumfries.\r\n----------------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+----------\r\nSilica                |    2.00     |     7.43    |     6.00    |    2.31\r\nIron oxide and alumina|    0.45     |     0.76    |     1.57    |    2.00\r\nCarbonate of lime     |   93.61     |    84.11    |    50.21    |   58.81\r\nCarbonate of magnesia |    1.62     |     7.45    |    41.22    |   36.41\r\nPhosphate of lime     |    0.56     |      -      |      -      |     -\r\nSulphate of lime      |    0.92     |      -      |      -      |     -\r\nOrganic matter        |    0.20     |      -      |      -      |     -\r\nWater                 |    0.50     |      -      |      -      |     -\r\n                      |   -----     |    -----    |    -----    |   -----\r\n                      |   99.86     |    99.75    |    99.00    |   99.53\r\n----------------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+----------\r\n\r\nClays are formed by the disintegration of any of the crystalline rocks;\r\nthe purest clays being formed from felspar. A pure clay consists simply\r\nof silica and alumina, all the other constituents having been washed\r\nout. Disintegration, however, seldom reaches such an extent; otherwise\r\nclay soils would be completely barren, which they are notably not. The\r\nimpurities present in clay, which consist of alkalies, especially potash\r\nand other mineral ingredients of the plant, are what confer on clay\r\nsoils their fertility. Clays differ, however, very considerably in\r\ntheir composition.

(p. 91).\r\n\r\nFORMS IN WHICH PLANT-FOODS ARE PRESENT IN SOIL.\r\n\r\nThe forms in which the bases necessary for plant-food are present in the\r\nsoil, are chiefly as _hydrated silicates_, and in combination with\r\norganic acids, forming humates, &c., as well as in the form of sulphates\r\nand chlorides.\r\n\r\nPhosphoric acid is present in combination with iron, alumina, or lime,\r\nor possibly also as magnesium-ammonium-phosphate. Sulphuric acid is\r\ngenerally present in a more or less insoluble condition, in combination\r\nwith iron and lime; whereas chlorine is combined with the alkali bases\r\nin an easily soluble form. An important point is as to the form in which\r\nthe plant absorbs these food constituents. In this connection reference\r\nmay be made to a theory put forward by a very distinguished French\r\nagricultural chemist, Professor Grandeau. His theory is that the\r\nnecessary ingredients of plant-food are absorbed into the plant as\r\nhumates, or, at any rate, that the medium of this transference is humic\r\nacid, and organic acids of a similar nature. This theory, however, while\r\ningenious, has not yet been supported by sufficient evidence to make its\r\nacceptance advisable. It is probable that it is only in the form of\r\nsoluble salts that the plant can absorb its food. It is quite probable,\r\nhowever, at the same time, that the exact form in which the different\r\nfood substances enter the plant may be largely determined by\r\ncircumstances. According to Nobbe, chloride of potassium is the most\r\nsuitable form of potassium salts, although the plant may absorb its\r\npotassium as sulphate, phosphate, or even silicate.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[61] Composition of the earth's solid crust in 100 parts by weight:--\r\n\r\nOxygen       44.0  to  48.7  |  Calcium      6.6  to  0.9\r\nSilicon      22.8  to  36.2  |  Magnesium    2.7  to  0.1\r\nAluminium     9.9  to   6.1  |  Sodium       2.4  to  2.5\r\nIron          9.9  to   2.4  |  Potassium    1.7  to  3.1\r\n\r\n(Roscoe's 'Lessons in Elementary Chemistry,' p. 8.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nFUNCTIONS PERFORMED BY MANURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving now considered the general conditions on which fertility of soil\r\ndepends, we are in a position to deal with the nature and function of\r\nmanures.\r\n\r\nManures may be classified in several different ways, and a considerable\r\namount of confusion is sometimes caused by the variety of classification\r\nadopted by different writers on this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Etymological meaning of the word Manure._\r\n\r\nLet us, in the first place, clearly understand what we mean by a manure.\r\nThe word manure comes from the French word _manoeuvrer_, which simply\r\nmeans \"to work with the hand,\" hence \"to till,\" and this etymological\r\nmeaning of the word illustrates the old belief in the function of\r\nmanures. We have already seen in the historical introduction that,\r\naccording to Tull, the true and only function of manures was to aid in\r\nthe pulverisation of the soil by fermentation. In advancing his system\r\nof _thorough tillage_, he claimed that since tillage effected the\r\npulverisation of the soil, where it was practised, manures could be\r\ndispensed with.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Definition of Manures._\r\n\r\nWe no longer, of course, attach this old meaning to the word. The word\r\nmanure is now applied to any substance which by its application\r\ncontributes to the fertility of a soil. As has been shown in the\r\nprevious chapter, the substances necessary for plant-growth which are\r\napt to be lacking in a soil, are only generally three in number--viz.,\r\n_nitrogen_, _phosphoric acid_, and _potash_. A manure, therefore, is\r\nunderstood to be any substance containing these ingredients, either\r\nsingly or together, and its commercial value is determined by the amount\r\nit contains of these substances. But while this is so, it must not be\r\nforgotten that if we define a manure to be a substance which contributes\r\nin any way to the fertility of the soil, substances other than these\r\nabove mentioned may be fairly regarded as manures. The fertility of a\r\nsoil, we have seen, depends not merely on the presence of certain\r\nconstituents, but also on their chemical condition--_i.e._, whether they\r\nare easily soluble or not. It further depends, as we have also seen, on\r\nthe possession by the soil of certain mechanical and biological\r\nproperties. Thus there are substances which act upon the soil's inert\r\nfertilising matter, and by their action convert it into a more speedily\r\navailable form. There are other substances which by their application\r\nexert a considerable effect on the texture of the soil, and thereby\r\ninfluence its physical and biological properties. All such substances,\r\naccording to the above definition of a manure, must be included under\r\nthe term. It will thus be seen that since fertility in a soil can be\r\npromoted in a variety of ways, and the functions performed by manures\r\nare of different kinds, we can divide them into different classes,\r\naccording to their respective action.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Different Classes of Manures._\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we can divide manures into two great classes,--(1)\r\nthose supplying to the soil necessary plant-food constituents, and thus\r\ncontributing directly to fertility; and (2) those influencing\r\nsoil-fertility in an indirect manner. The first class we may call\r\n_direct_ manures, and the second _indirect_. Those two classes admit\r\nfurther of being subdivided into other smaller classes. Among the direct\r\nmanures we have a number of subdivisions in use. They may be divided\r\ninto _general_ manures and _special_ manures, according as they contain\r\nall the elements necessary for plant-growth, or only some of them; or\r\nthey may be divided according to their source into _natural_ and\r\n_artificial_, _mineral_ and _vegetable_. Similarly we have a number of\r\nsubdivisions among the second class, depending on the special nature of\r\nthe action they exert. Some manures act in both capacities--both\r\ndirectly and indirectly--and in order that their value be fully\r\nappreciated must be studied under both heads. The most striking example\r\nof such a manure is farmyard manure. There are other manures which may\r\nin certain circumstances act in two different ways. Such a substance is\r\nlime. There are soils which are actually lacking in a sufficiency of\r\nlime for the needs of crops. On such soils an application of lime would\r\nact both as a direct and also as an indirect manure. There may also be\r\ncases of an exceptional nature, in which magnesia salts or even iron\r\nsalts may act as direct manures. Many manures commonly regarded as\r\npurely direct manures would exert an indirect influence were the\r\nquantities in which they were applied sufficiently large. This is the\r\ncase, indeed, with many artificial manures, such as guano, bones,\r\nnitrate of soda, and basic slag. It has been claimed for nitrate of soda\r\nthat it not merely promotes fertility by supplying nitrogen in its most\r\navailable form to the soil, but that the soda it contains exerts a\r\nvaluable indirect influence in consolidating the soil and increasing its\r\nabsorptive powers. When we reflect, however, on the small quantity of\r\nthis manure which is applied per acre, its mechanical influence must be\r\ninsignificant. The same applies to basic slag, which contains a\r\nconsiderable quantity of free lime in its composition. As this manure,\r\nhowever, is sometimes applied in considerable quantities, it is\r\nreasonable to suppose that its indirect value may not be altogether\r\ninsignificant. Indeed we have proof of this in the fact that its most\r\nfavourable action has been found to be on soils rich in organic\r\nmatter.[62] The action of bones and guano, and indeed of all other\r\nmanures containing a large percentage of decomposable organic matter, is\r\nlikewise of a double nature, inasmuch as their decomposition or\r\nputrefaction in the soil gives rise to the formation of carbonic and\r\norganic acids, which are capable of exerting a chemical action on the\r\nsoil ingredients. There is one point in connection with the action of\r\nthese manures which is worthy of notice, and it is that, however slight\r\ntheir indirect value may be, their action as a direct manure is very\r\nmuch accelerated by the way in which their organic matter putrefies. In\r\nshort, they may be described as providing, to a certain extent, the\r\nsolvents which render them available for the requirements of the plant.\r\nIt may be here convenient to classify the manures which we intend\r\nsubsequently to deal with.\r\n\r\nI. Manures, action of which is both direct and indirect--_e.g._, _green\r\nmanures_, _farmyard manure_, _composts_, and _sewage_.\r\n\r\nII. Manures which may be regarded as having only a direct\r\naction--_e.g._, _guano_ of all kinds, _bones_ in all forms, _nitrate of\r\nsoda_, _sulphate of ammonia_, _dried blood_, _superphosphates_, _mineral\r\nphosphates_ of all kinds, _horns_ and _hoofs_, _shoddy_, _wool-waste_,\r\n_fish-guano_, _muriate of potash_, _sulphate of potash_, and _kainit_.\r\n\r\nIII. Manures which may be regarded as having only an indirect\r\nvalue--_e.g._, _lime_, _mild_ and _caustic_, _marl_, _gypsum_, _salt_,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nWe shall now proceed to discuss the nature and action of these different\r\nmanures, starting with those exercising both a _direct_ and _indirect_\r\ninfluence. Before doing so it may be well to consider the occurrence and\r\nnatural sources of the three important soil constituents, nitrogen,\r\nphosphoric acid, and potash, with a view of seeing to what extent these\r\nare being removed from our soils by the various natural processes\r\nconstantly going on, as well as by the crops, and how far their natural\r\nsources are capable of making good this loss--in short, to clearly\r\nunderstand the economic reasons for the application of artificial\r\nmanures.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[62] See Chapter on Basic Slag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE POSITION OF NITROGEN IN AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf manurial ingredients, nitrogen is by far the most important, and on\r\nthe presence and character of the nitrogen it contains, the fertility of\r\na soil may be said to be most largely dependent. Most soils, as a rule,\r\nare better supplied with available ash ingredients than with available\r\nnitrogen compounds. The expensive nature of most artificial nitrogenous\r\nmanures also gives to nitrogen the first position from an economic point\r\nof view. A thorough study, therefore, of the different forms in which it\r\nexists in nature, of the numerous and complicated changes it undergoes\r\nin the soil, by which it is prepared for the plant's needs, of the\r\nrelation of its different forms to plant-life, and of the natural\r\nsources of its loss and gain, is of the highest importance if we are to\r\nhope to understand the difficult question of soil-fertility.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Rothamsted Experiments and the Nitrogen question._\r\n\r\nThe position of nitrogen in agriculture is a question of great\r\ndifficulty and complexity. It has engaged much attention, and has had\r\ndevoted to its elucidation much elaborate and painstaking research. To\r\nthe Rothamsted experiments we owe most of the information we possess on\r\nthe subject, and the facts contained in this chapter are almost entirely\r\nderived from the results of these famous experiments, as embodied in the\r\nmemoirs and writings of Messrs Lawes, Gilbert, and Warington.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Different forms in which Nitrogen exists in Nature._\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to the nitrogen question in the historical\r\nintroduction. In order, however, to have a comprehensive view of the\r\nsubject, it may be well to recapitulate some of the facts there\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nNitrogen, as we have already seen, exists in the \"free\" or elementary\r\ncondition, as nitrates and nitrites, as ammonia, and in a large number\r\nof different organic forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nitrogen in the Air._\r\n\r\nIt occurs in greatest abundance (amounting to about 80 per cent) in the\r\nfirst of these forms in the air. That this free nitrogen, which is\r\npractically unlimited in quantity,[63] has originally been the source of\r\nall its other forms, is of course obvious. But this conversion of free\r\nnitrogen into the various compound forms in which it occurs throughout\r\nthe mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms, has been a process effected\r\nby a variety of indirect methods, and only at the expense of a vast\r\namount of time. For practical purposes, the free nitrogen of the air may\r\nbe regarded chiefly as a non-available source for most bodies containing\r\nit. It may be described as of all forms of nitrogen the least active, as\r\nfar as plant-life is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relation of \"free\" Nitrogen to the Plant._\r\n\r\nThe relation of the \"free\" nitrogen to the plant has formed the subject\r\nof much research, more especially during the last few years, and a brief\r\nepitome of the main results arrived at has already been given in the\r\nIntroductory Chapter.[64]\r\n\r\nThat this source of nitrogen is not so inaccessible to the plant as was\r\nformerly believed, has now been abundantly proved. As the considerations\r\nwhich have led to this conclusion, and have suggested the very recent\r\nelaborate experiments on the fixation of free nitrogen by the plant--the\r\nresults of which bid fair, it would seem, to largely revolutionise our\r\nagricultural practice--have been due to the study of the relation of the\r\nsoil-nitrogen to the plant, it will be best to defer further discussion\r\nof this question till we have dealt with the other sources of nitrogen.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Combined Nitrogen in the Air._\r\n\r\nIn addition to nitrogen in the free state, air contains very small\r\nquantities of this element in combined forms. We have it in minute\r\ntraces as nitrates and nitrites, as ammonia,[65] and also in still\r\nsmaller traces as organic nitrogen in the minute dust-particles which\r\nmodern researches have revealed as being present in such enormous\r\nnumbers in our atmosphere. What the sources of these nitrates and\r\nnitrites (which exist in quantities so minute that accurate\r\ndetermination of their amount is rendered extremely difficult) are is a\r\ndisputed point. That nitrogen and oxygen unite together to form nitric\r\nand nitrous oxides under the influence of intense heat, such as the\r\nelectric spark, has been proved beyond doubt. One source, therefore, is\r\nprobably the electrical discharges which are taking place more or less\r\nfrequently on different parts of the earth's surface. Nitrates may also\r\nbe formed in the combustion of nitrogenous bodies.[66] In the burning of\r\ncoal-gas, for example, it is probable that small quantities of nitrates\r\nmay be produced. Similarly the slow combustion or decay of nitrogenous\r\norganic matter, which constantly takes place all over the earth's\r\nsurface, may be regarded as another source of this form of combined\r\nnitrogen. Ammonia may be similarly formed by the combustion, either\r\nquick or slow, of nitrogenous organic matter. It exists in the air as\r\nnitrate or nitrite of ammonia, and also as carbonate of ammonia.[67]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amount of combined Nitrogen falling in the Rain._\r\n\r\nThe importance of the combined nitrogen in the air as a source of\r\nsoil-nitrogen is best gauged by the amount falling annually on the soil\r\ndissolved in rain. This has been found to vary considerably. In the rain\r\nfalling in the vicinity of large towns the amount is greater than in\r\nrain falling in the country. Thus at Rothamsted, in England, the average\r\namount for several years was only 3.37 lb. nitrogen per annum per acre,\r\nof which 2.53 lb. were as ammonia,.84 being as nitric acid. At Lincoln,\r\nin New Zealand, 1.74 lb. fell annually per acre--as ammonia,.74, as\r\nnitric acid, 1.00; while at Barbadoes the amount was 3.77 lb., of which\r\n.93 was as ammonia, and 2.84 as nitric acid.[68] That the combined\r\nnitrogen derived from the air by the soil may be considerably in excess\r\nof this is highly probable. Soils, especially when damp, may absorb much\r\nlarger quantities from the air of the combined nitrogen it contains. We\r\nmust remember that the air in contact with the soil-surface is\r\nconstantly being changed, and that there is thus a constant renewal of\r\nthe air passed over the ground. The result is that the amount of air\r\nfrom which combined nitrogen may be removed is very great.[69]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nitrogen in the Soil._\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked as a fact worthy of notice that nitrogen is\r\nessentially a superficial element. By this is meant that it is only\r\nfound, as a rule, on the earth's immediate surface. This statement can\r\nonly be admitted to be true within certain limits. The chief source of\r\nnitrogen, in addition to the atmosphere, is, of course, vegetable and\r\nanimal tissue.[70] As vegetable and animal tissue are only found to any\r\nextent on the earth's surface, nitrogen is therefore chiefly found\r\nthere. The natural deposits of nitrogen salts, such as the\r\nnitrate-fields of Chili and the saltpetre soils of India, &c., also\r\nonly occur superficially. Notwithstanding these facts, however, the\r\namount of nitrogen which exists at probably considerable depths from the\r\nsurface must be very great. There are few sedimentary rocks which do not\r\ncontain it. At Rothamsted a sample of calcareous clay, taken from a\r\ndepth of 500 feet, contained .04 per cent--that is, as much as is found,\r\non an average, in the Rothamsted clay subsoils.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nitrogen in the Subsoil._\r\n\r\nOn the whole, however, as we have said, nitrogen is chiefly found in the\r\nsurface-soil. The amount found in the subsoil at Rothamsted seems to\r\nvary very slightly at different depths, the percentage amounting to from\r\n.06 to .03.[71] Unlike the nitrogen of the surface-soil, that in the\r\nsubsoil seems to be of very ancient origin, being probably derived from\r\nthe remains of animal and vegetable life in the mud deposited at the\r\nbottom of the ocean. It is more abundant in the case of a clay subsoil\r\nthan in a sandy subsoil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nitrogen of Surface-Soil._\r\n\r\nNitrogen has a tendency to collect on the top layers of the\r\nsurface-soil, the first 9 inches or foot containing by far the largest\r\nproportion of it. In the table given in the Appendix,[72] the rate at\r\nwhich it decreases in amount the further down we go is clearly shown.\r\nDeterminations of the respective amounts of nitrogen in every 3 inches\r\nof the soil, taken to a depth of one foot of the experimental\r\nwheat-field at Rothamsted, showed that the percentage between the first\r\n3 inches and the second 3 inches varied very slightly. A more marked\r\ndifference, however, was shown to exist between the nitrogen in the\r\nsecond and third 3 inches; while the fourth 3 inches were distinctly\r\npoorer--differing very little in their percentage of nitrogen from the\r\nsubsoil. This was the case in unmanured soil. In the case of heavily\r\nmanured soil, the increase in the soil's percentage, due to manure, was\r\nshown to be felt to the depth of a foot, but not much below it.[73]\r\n\r\nA careful perusal of the tables in the Appendix will show that the\r\nquantity of nitrogen in the case of both arable and pasture soils\r\nsteadily decreases for the first 3 feet, but that below this depth\r\nlittle decrease is seen, the percentage evidently becoming fairly\r\nconstant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The amount of Nitrogen in the Soil._\r\n\r\nVery considerable difference exists in the amount of nitrogen present in\r\ndifferent soils. The majority of analyses refer only to the amount found\r\nin the surface-soil--generally in the first 9 or 12 inches. As the soil,\r\nfurther, is not a body exactly homogeneous in its character, very\r\nconsiderable difficulty exists in obtaining reliable results. A great\r\ndeal depends, therefore, on the method of sampling and the basis of\r\ncalculation adopted; and it may be that this may occasionally explain,\r\nto some extent at least, the great discrepancies in the estimation of\r\nthe quantities of nitrogen present in different soils as found by\r\ndifferent investigators.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Peat-soils richest in Nitrogen._\r\n\r\nOf all soils, peat-soils are richest in nitrogen. Professor S. W.\r\nJohnson found the nitrogen in fifty separate samples of peat to range\r\nfrom .4 per cent to 2.9 per cent, the average being 1.5 per cent. On the\r\nother hand, marls and sandy soils are poorest, the analyses of a number\r\nof these soils showing only from .004 to .083 per cent for the former,\r\nand .025 to .074 for the latter. As a general rule most arable soils\r\ncontain over one-tenth per cent of nitrogen, or, say, over 3500 lb. per\r\nacre. A good pasture-soil, taken to a depth of 9 inches at Rothamsted,\r\nwas found to contain about a quarter per cent. In ten samples of soil,\r\ntaken to a depth of 9 inches, from different parts of Great Britain and\r\nIreland, Munro found from .128 to .695 per cent of nitrogen, the average\r\nbeing .3278 per cent. The Rothamsted soils, it may be pointed out, are\r\nprobably poor in nitrogen compared with most soils. A. Mueller's\r\ninvestigations showed that in some of the soils he has analysed, the\r\nnitrogen amounted to little short of one per cent, while for the others\r\nthe average was over half a per cent; even the poorer soils he examined\r\ncontained about one quarter per cent on an average. Anderson's analyses\r\nof Scottish wheat-soils showed a variation of from .074 to .22 in the\r\nsurface-soil, while he found in their subsoil from .15 to .92 per cent.\r\nBoussingault's results are also very much higher. The amount of nitrogen\r\nin a number of loams coming from widely different localities he examined\r\ncontained from 6000 to 30,000 lb. per acre--the soil taken to a depth of\r\n17 inches.[74]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nature of the Nitrogen in the Soil._\r\n\r\nWhen we compare the amount of nitrogen removed by different crops\r\n(which, even in the case of those most exhaustive of nitrogen, does not\r\noften amount to more than 150 lb. per acre), with the amount contained\r\nin the soil, the former amount seems very insignificant when compared to\r\nthe latter. Such being the case, it would seem at first sight that the\r\naddition of nitrogen in the form of manures is quite superfluous. We\r\nmust remember, however, that while the _total_ amount of nitrogen is\r\nrelatively large when compared to that removed by crops, only a very\r\nsmall proportion is in a condition _available_ to the plant. This leads\r\nus to consider the different forms in which nitrogen is present in the\r\nsoil, and their respective quantities.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Organic Nitrogen in the Soil._\r\n\r\nNitrogen occurs in the soil as organic nitrogen, nitric acid, nitrous\r\nacid, and ammonia. By far the largest proportion is present in the first\r\nof these forms. This is a wise provision, for otherwise the soil would\r\nbe apt to become very speedily impoverished in nitrogen; for that\r\npresent as nitrates it has scarcely any power to retain, while that\r\npresent as ammonia is soon converted into nitrates by the process of\r\n_nitrification_.\r\n\r\nThe organic nitrogen of the soil, although we are apt to think of it as\r\nsuch, is by no means of a homogeneous character, or of equal value as a\r\nsource of plant-food. Some of it, it would seem from recent\r\ninvestigations, is in a condition more susceptible of being converted\r\ninto an available form than the rest. Thus in the process of\r\nnitrification, a process which we shall consider at length immediately,\r\nthere seems to be generally a certain small proportion more ready to\r\nundergo this change than the rest; so that when this small amount is\r\nused up nitrification proceeds more slowly. In short, although we as yet\r\nknow very little of the nature of the organic nitrogen of soils, we\r\ncannot doubt but that there is a constant series of changes in its\r\ncomposition taking place, resulting in the gradual elaboration of more\r\navailable forms, until ultimately these are converted into ammonia and\r\nnitrates.\r\n\r\nThe great bulk of the organic nitrogen, however, in the soil must be\r\nregarded as in an _inert_ condition, and by no means available for the\r\ncrop. What the exact chemical form of this nitrogen is it is extremely\r\ndifficult to say. Mulder was of the opinion that a considerable\r\nproportion was in the form of humate of ammonia. This opinion, as we\r\nshall have occasion to see immediately, was based on false grounds. It\r\nis highly probable that it may be in some form approximating to amide\r\nnitrogen. Its inert character is against the belief that it long remains\r\nas albuminoid nitrogen.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Different Character of Surface and Subsoil Nitrogen._\r\n\r\nA point of very considerable importance to notice is, that the\r\nnitrogenous organic matter of the surface-soil is very different from\r\nthat found in the subsoil. This difference is shown by the variation in\r\nthe ratio of nitrogen to carbon, which points to the fact that, just as\r\nwe should naturally suppose, the origin of the latter is very much more\r\nancient than the origin of the former. Thus in the first 9 inches of old\r\npasture-soil at Rothamsted, the ratio was 1:13; while in the subsoil, 3\r\nfeet from the surface, it was only 1:6. In the surface-soil it thus\r\napproaches more nearly in composition ordinary vegetable matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nitrogen as Ammonia in Soils._\r\n\r\nThe second form in which nitrogen is present in soil is as ammonia. A\r\nvery considerable misapprehension has existed in the past as to the\r\namount of nitrogen in this form in soils. This mistake was due to the\r\nmethod adopted in estimating it, which consisted in treating the soil\r\nwith boiling caustic alkalies and counting as ammonia what was given off\r\nas such. It is now known that certain forms of organic nitrogen--as, for\r\nexample, amides--if treated in this way are slowly converted into\r\nammonia. Statements, therefore, which are found in the older text-books,\r\nrepresenting the amount of ammonia in soils as at over a tenth per cent,\r\nmust be regarded as utterly unreliable. Indeed it is highly probable\r\nthat ammonia only occurs in most soils in very minute traces. From what\r\nwe know of the process of nitrification, we see how it is wellnigh\r\nimpossible that ammonia should exist to any extent in the soil except\r\nunder very exceptional circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amount of Ammonia present in the Soil._\r\n\r\nIn ordinary soils it probably does not amount to more than from .0002\r\nper cent to .0008 per cent, or an average of .0006 per cent.[75] In\r\nrich soils, or in garden-soils, the amount may be considerably more.\r\nThus Boussingault found in a garden-soil .002 per cent. In peat and in\r\npeat-mould even a higher percentage has been found--viz.,.018 for the\r\nformer and .05 for the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nitrogen present as Nitrates in the Soil._\r\n\r\nThe third form of nitrogen in the soil is nitric acid. It is more\r\nabundant in this form than as ammonia; but still, compared with the\r\norganic nitrogen, its amount is trifling. Probably not more than 5 per\r\ncent of the total nitrogen of a soil is ever present as nitrates. The\r\nreason of this is twofold. First, as we have already remarked, the soil\r\nhas very little power to retain nitrogen in this form; and secondly,\r\nwhere the soil is covered with growing vegetation the nitrates are\r\nquickly assimilated by the plant as they are formed. It is for this\r\nreason that we find the quantity of nitrogen as nitrates very much\r\ngreater in fallow soils than in those covered with a crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Position of Nitric Nitrogen in Soil._\r\n\r\nAs we shall have occasion to see more fully in the following chapter on\r\nNitrification, the formation of nitrates is chiefly limited to the\r\nsurface-soil, the largest proportion being formed within the first 9 or\r\n12 inches. For this reason we find the largest quantity of nitrates in\r\nthe surface-soil. But inasmuch as they are easily washed into the lower\r\nlayers of the soil after formation, we often find a considerable\r\nproportion beyond the first 9 inches. The position of nitrates in the\r\nsoil thus depends very considerably on the season of the year and the\r\nweather. In dry weather, where the evaporation of the soil-water takes\r\nplace at a considerable rate, the tendency will be to concentrate the\r\nnitrates in the superficial portion of the soil. In wet weather, on the\r\nother hand, the tendency will be to wash the nitrates into the lower\r\nlayers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amount of Nitrates in the Soil._\r\n\r\nThe determination of the amount of nitrates in a soil is not of very\r\ngreat economic importance; as this varies so much, and depends on such a\r\nnumber of different conditions, such as the season, the condition of the\r\nland, and prevailing weather. A point of very much greater economic\r\nimportance is the total amount formed in the year, and the rate at which\r\nnitrification takes place. These questions will be discussed elsewhere,\r\nand therefore need not here be referred to. Some interesting analyses\r\nmade at Rothamsted, however, of the amount of nitrates in soils at\r\ndifferent depths, merit careful consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nitrates in Fallow Soils._\r\n\r\nIn the Appendix to the chapter on Nitrification,[76] will be found a\r\ntable containing the amounts of nitrates found in the first 27 inches of\r\nfallow soils. The amounts vary from 33.7 lb. to 59.9 lb. per acre. The\r\nanalyses were made in September or October. In four out of the six\r\nanalyses, it will be found that by far the largest proportion is found\r\nin the first 9 inches. In these cases the preceding summer had been dry,\r\nand thus the nitrates had not been washed down to any depth. In the\r\nother two cases the largest amount is found in the second 9 inches of\r\nsoil, and a considerable amount is also found in the third 9 inches.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nitrates in Cropped Soils._\r\n\r\nIn the case of cropped soils we find the amount of nitrates very much\r\nless. A table containing an elaborate series of determinations of\r\nnitrates in cropped soils, receiving, however, no manure, and taken to a\r\ndepth of 9 feet, will be found in the Appendix.[77] The first 27 inches\r\nonly contain some 5 to 14 lb. per acre, and the most of that is found in\r\nthe first 9 inches. This shows how speedily nitrates are assimilated by\r\nthe growing crop. An interesting point shown by these analyses is that\r\nnitrates almost entirely cease in cropped soils a certain depth down,\r\nbut that at a still lower depth they again occur in small quantities.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nitrates in manured Wheat-soils._\r\n\r\nLastly, we give in the Appendix[78] the amount of nitrates found in\r\nwheat and barley soils, differently manured, at Rothamsted. From a\r\nperusal of these tables, it will be seen that the amount (under various\r\nconditions of manuring) of nitrates in the first 27 inches varies from\r\n21.2 lb. per acre to 52.2 lb. for the wheat-soils, and 20.1 to 44.1 lb.\r\nper acre for the barley-soils.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOURCES OF SOIL-NITROGEN.\r\n\r\nWe shall now consider the sources of soil-nitrogen, the conditions which\r\ndetermine its increase, and the amount of that increase, as well as the\r\nsources of loss, and the conditions which determine this loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n_That dissolved in Rain._\r\n\r\nThe natural sources of the soil-nitrogen are several. We have first of\r\nall the atmospheric nitrogen. Of this let us first consider that present\r\nas combined nitrogen. This, as we have already seen, consists chiefly of\r\nnitrates, nitrites, and ammonia, and reaches the soil dissolved in rain\r\nor in other meteoric forms of water, such as snow, hail, fog,\r\nhoar-frost, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n_That absorbed by the Soil from the Air._\r\n\r\nIt is also absorbed by the soil from the air, especially when the soil\r\nis in a damp condition, as has been proved by Schloesing's experiments,\r\nalready referred to. The total amount which falls dissolved in the rain,\r\nper acre per annum, varies very considerably in different parts of the\r\nworld, but in any case only amounts yearly to a few pounds per acre.[79]\r\nThat absorbed by the soil from the air may be probably very much more\r\nconsiderable. Schloesing in his experiments found that this latter might\r\namount to 38 lb. per acre per annum. These results, however, were\r\nobtained under circumstances most favourable for absorption--viz., with\r\na damp soil and in the vicinity of Paris, where the air is presumably\r\nricher in combined nitrogen than it is in the country. The nitrogen\r\nabsorbed, it may be mentioned, was almost entirely in the form of\r\nammonia. It is to be noted that the nitrogen the soil obtains in this\r\nway from the combined nitrogen of the air is not all pure gain. With\r\nregard to the nitrates and nitrites, no doubt most of these are formed\r\nby electrical discharge, although a small portion of them may be formed\r\nby the oxidation of ammonia by means of ozone and peroxide of hydrogen.\r\nWith regard to the ammonia and the combined nitrogen present in the\r\norganic particles in the air, a not inconsiderable proportion is\r\nprobably derived from the soil. Schloesing considers the chief source of\r\nthe ammonia present in the air to be the tropical ocean; but we must\r\nremember that the source of much of the nitrogen in the tropical ocean\r\nis, after all, the soil.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside for a moment the question of the availability of the free\r\nnitrogen of the air, let us consider the other sources of soil-nitrogen.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Accumulation of Soil-nitrogen under Natural Conditions._\r\n\r\nThe chief source is of course the remains of vegetable and animal\r\ntissue.[80] Plants are the great conservers of soil-nitrogen. By\r\nassimilating such available forms of it as nitrates, and converting them\r\ninto organic nitrogen, they prevent the loss of this most valuable of\r\nall soil constituents that would otherwise take place.\r\n\r\nThey also serve to collect the nitrogen from the lower soil-layers and\r\nconcentrate it in the surface portion. In a state of nature, where the\r\nsoil is constantly covered with vegetation, the process going on,\r\ntherefore, will be one of steady accumulation of nitrogen in the\r\nsurface-soil. To what extent this accumulation goes on, and how far it\r\nis limited by the conditions of loss, will be considered immediately.\r\nThat it may go on to a very great extent is amply proved by the\r\nexistence of the so-called _virgin_ soils of countries like America and\r\nAustralia. There are cases, also, where the accumulation of nitrogen is\r\npractically unlimited, although the result in such cases is not\r\nnecessarily a fertile soil. Such cases are peat-bogs. But let us pass on\r\nto the accumulation of soil-nitrogen under the ordinary conditions of\r\nhusbandry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Accumulation of Nitrogen in Pastures._\r\n\r\nThe case which, under the conditions of ordinary farming, most resembles\r\na state of nature, is that of permanent pasture. It will be best,\r\ntherefore, to study first the conditions under which gain of nitrogen\r\ntakes place in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Increase of Nitrogen in the soil of Pasture-land._\r\n\r\nThat there is a steady increase of nitrogen in the soil of land under\r\npasture is a fact of universal experience. The older a pasture is the\r\nricher is its soil in nitrogen. The comparison of the analyses of the\r\nsoil of arable land with the soil of pastures of different ages shows\r\nthis in a striking way.[81] Thus at Rothamsted it was found that while\r\nthe amount of nitrogen in an ordinary arable soil was .140 per cent,\r\nthat in pastures eight, eighteen, twenty-one, and thirty years old was\r\nrespectively .151, .174, .204, and .241 per cent. In the last two\r\nanalyses we have a record of the actual gain in nitrogen made by the\r\nsame pasture, this being .04 per cent in nine years' time. From these\r\nstatistics it may be inferred that the surface-soil of a pasture may\r\nincrease at the rate of 50 lb. per acre per annum. A point of great\r\ninterest in connection with this subject is the fact that there seems to\r\nbe a limit to the accumulation of nitrogen in pastures; for it would\r\nseem that pastures centuries old are not any richer in nitrogen than\r\nthose thirty to forty years old.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gain of Nitrogen with Leguminous Crops._\r\n\r\nAnother case where the gain of nitrogen to the surface-soil is very\r\nstriking is in that of leguminous crops, such as clover, beans, peas,\r\n&c. This fact has been long recognised--especially with regard to\r\nclover--by farmers, and has been largely instrumental in leading to the\r\ninvestigation of the \"free\" nitrogen question. That a soil bearing a\r\nleguminous crop increases in nitrogen at a very striking rate is a\r\nproblem that requires to be solved. A partial explanation of the\r\nphenomenon is found in the extraordinary capacity such a crop as clover\r\nhas, by means of its multitudinous and ramifying roots, for collecting\r\nnitrogen from the subsoil. This, however, would only account for the\r\nincrease in nitrogen to a certain extent. There must be some other\r\nsource, and the only other source is the air. That the free nitrogen of\r\nthe air is, after all, available for the plant's needs, is a supposition\r\nwhich has long seemed extremely probable, and which, within the last\r\nfew years, has been proved beyond doubt to be a fact in the case of\r\nleguminous plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Fixation of \"Free\" Nitrogen._\r\n\r\nThe method in which these plants are able to make use of the free\r\nnitrogen is still a point requiring much research. So far as the\r\nquestion is at present investigated, it would seem that the fixation is\r\neffected by means of micro-organisms present in tubercles or root\r\nexcrescences found on the roots of leguminous plants.[82] Not merely has\r\nthis been placed beyond doubt, but attempts have been made to isolate\r\nand study the bacteria effecting this fixation. From Nobbe's exceedingly\r\ninteresting experiments, recently carried out, it would seem that the\r\ndifferent kinds of leguminous plants have different bacteria. Thus the\r\nbacteria in the tubercle on the pea seems to be of a different order\r\nfrom the bacteria in the tubercles of the lupin, and so on. This\r\ndiscovery is of great importance, it need scarcely be pointed out, as it\r\nthrows much light on the principles of the rotation of crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Influence of Manures in increasing Soil-nitrogen._\r\n\r\nIt may be doubted, however, if under any other conditions there is a\r\npositive gain of soil-nitrogen. In other cases the amount in the soil is\r\nonly _maintained_ under liberal manuring. In connection with this point\r\na very striking fact has been observed with regard to the effect of\r\ncontinuous large applications of farmyard manure. It has been found at\r\nRothamsted that in such a case, after a while, the manure does not seem\r\nto increase the soil-nitrogen, although where the nitrogen goes to\r\nremains a mystery. In the case of the application of artificial manures,\r\nthere does not seem to be almost any appreciable gain to the\r\nsoil-nitrogen. The soil-nitrogen is only increased by means of the\r\nresidue of crops. In this way, of course, by increasing the amount of\r\nthis crop-residue, artificial manures may be said indirectly to increase\r\nthe soil-nitrogen.[83]\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES OF LOSS OF NITROGEN.\r\n\r\nWe now come to consider the sources of loss. The chief source, of\r\ncourse, is that by drainage. Land under cultivation will suffer very\r\nmuch more from this source of loss than in a state of nature. Our modern\r\nsystem of husbandry, involving as it does thorough drainage, can\r\nscarcely fail to very considerably increase this source of loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Loss of Nitrates by Drainage._\r\n\r\nThe form in which nitrogen is lost in this way is as nitrates. It is a\r\nsomewhat striking fact, and one worthy of note, that of the three\r\nimportant manurial ingredients--nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash,\r\nthe first of these, in its final and most valuable form, is alone\r\nincapable of being fixed by the soil, and thus retained from loss by\r\ndrainage.\r\n\r\nAs nitrates are constantly being formed in the soil, the loss to its\r\ntotal nitrogen must be considerable. It is due to the fact of the great\r\nsolubility of nitrates, as well as to the fact, as already mentioned, of\r\nthe incapacity of the soil-particles to fix them. To this one exception\r\nmust be made. According to Knop, small quantities of nitric acid are\r\nheld in the _insoluble_ condition in soils in the form of highly _basic\r\nnitrates of iron and alumina_. The quantity, however, of these insoluble\r\ncompounds probably amounts to a very minute trace indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Permanent Pasture and \"Catch-cropping\" prevents Loss._\r\n\r\nThe amount of loss varies, and will depend on a number of different\r\ncircumstances--thus the nature of the soil, climate, and season of the\r\nyear will all influence its quantity. The way in which the soil is\r\ncultivated is also another important factor. Where it is constantly\r\ncovered with vegetation, as in the case of permanent pasture, the loss\r\nwill be at a minimum. Under such conditions, plant-roots are always\r\nthere ready to fix, in the insoluble organic form, the soluble nitrates\r\nas they are formed. A consideration of this fact forms one of the\r\nstrongest arguments in favour of the practice of what is known as\r\n\"catch-cropping.\" The practice consists in sowing some quickly-growing\r\ngreen crop--_e.g._, _mustard_, _vetches_, &c.--so as to occupy the soil\r\nimmediately after harvest, and subsequently to plough it in. The\r\nnitrates, which it is known are most abundantly formed towards the end\r\nof summer,[84] and which are allowed to accumulate in the soil from the\r\nperiod at which the active growth of, and consequently assimilation of\r\nnitrates by, the cereal crop have ceased, are thus fixed in the organic\r\nmatter of the plant, and removed from danger of loss by drainage\r\nincidental to autumn rains.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Conditions diminishing Loss of Nitrates._\r\n\r\nThe nature of the soil is another important condition regulating this\r\nloss. Some soils are very much opener and more porous than others; in\r\nsuch soils, of course, the loss by drainage will be greatest. We are apt\r\nat first sight, however, knowing the great solubility of nitrates, to\r\noverrate this source of loss. We have to remember that while nitrates\r\nare constantly being washed down to the lower layers of the soil, there\r\nis likewise an upward compensating movement of the soil-water constantly\r\ntaking place. This is due to the evaporation of water from the surface\r\nof the soil, which induces an upward capillary movement of water from\r\nits lower to its higher layers.[85] This upward movement of water is\r\nvery much increased, in the case of soil covered with vegetation, by the\r\ntranspiration of the plants. The climate and the season of the year will\r\naffect the extent of this upward movement. Where there is a heavy\r\nrainfall it will be very much less than in dry climates. After a long\r\nperiod of drought the nitrates will be found to be concentrated in the\r\ntop few inches of the soil; and in hot climates this sometimes takes\r\nplace to such an extent that the surface of the soil has been actually\r\ncovered with a saline crust, caused by the rapid evaporation of\r\nsoil-water under the influence of a burning tropical sun. From this\r\npoint of view it will be seen how very much less powerful a single\r\nshower of rain is--even although at the time it is heavy--in causing\r\nloss of nitrates by drainage, than a continuance of wet weather. In the\r\nformer case, where the showers are separated by an interval of dry\r\nweather, the nitrates washed down into the lower layers of the soil are\r\nslowly brought up again by the capillary action caused by evaporation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amount of Loss by Drainage._\r\n\r\nWhat the actual amount of loss is which takes place in this way it is\r\nwellnigh impossible to say. What it amounts to under certain definite\r\ncircumstances has been discovered by actual experiment at Rothamsted.\r\nTaking the circumstances most favourable to extreme loss--viz.,\r\nunmanured fallow land--the highest amount registered at Rothamsted for a\r\nyear is 54.2 lb. per acre from soil 20 inches deep, while the smallest\r\namount is 20.9 lb. In the former case, the drainage-water was equivalent\r\nto 21.66 inches, while in the latter, to 8.96 inches. The average for\r\nthirteen years on unmanured fallow soil has been 37.3 lb. (for 20\r\ninches), 32.6 lb. (for 40 inches), 35.6 lb. (for 60 inches). The point\r\nof especial interest in this connection is that an annual loss of\r\nnitrogen, equal to over 2 cwt. of nitrate of soda, may take place from a\r\ncomparatively poor arable soil lying fallow.\r\n\r\nThe loss on cropped soils is of course very much less--in short, should\r\namount to very little--especially in permanent pasture, where it is\r\nreduced to a minimum. Taking an average, Mr Warington is of opinion that\r\nthe loss in England may be put at 8 lb. per annum per acre.[86]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Loss in Form of Free Nitrogen._\r\n\r\nThe other chief natural source of loss of nitrogen is due to its escape\r\nfrom the soil in its \"free\" state. This source of loss is very much less\r\nimportant than that by drainage, and probably amounts to very little.\r\nThat, however, it takes place is beyond a doubt; and that it may--as we\r\nshall see by-and-by--under certain circumstances amount to something\r\nvery considerable is also proved. Where large quantities of nitrogenous\r\norganic matter decay, and where, consequently, the supply of atmospheric\r\noxygen is insufficient to effect complete oxidation, \"free\" nitrogen may\r\nbe evolved in considerable quantities. Similarly, it may be evolved in\r\nthe case of vegetable matter decaying under water. In soils rich in\r\norganic matter the reduction of even nitrates may take place,\r\naccompanied with the evolution of free nitrogen, which is thus lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Total Amount of Loss of Nitrogen._\r\n\r\nWhat the rate of total loss of nitrogen is from these different sources\r\ndoes not admit of easy calculation. Sir John Lawes, in dealing with the\r\nquestion of soil-fertility, estimated some years ago, by comparing the\r\nsoil of old pasture at Rothamsted with that which had been under arable\r\nculture for 250 years, that during that period some 3000 lb. of nitrogen\r\nper acre had disappeared from the arable land. Examples of decrease of\r\nnitrogen in Rothamsted soils, under various conditions of culture, will\r\nbe found in the Appendix.[87]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Loss of Nitrogen by Retrogression._\r\n\r\nA source of loss of nitrogen may be here mentioned which has to do with\r\ndiminution of amount of available nitrogen, rather than absolute loss of\r\nnitrogen to the soil, and which we may term _loss by retrogression_.\r\nNitrogen in an available form, such as nitrates, has been found to be\r\nconverted into a less available form. This retrogression may be\r\neffected, as in the case of nitrates, by reduction--_i.e._, by removal\r\nof the oxygen in combination with the nitrogen, which in many cases may\r\nbe set free, and thus partially although not necessarily entirely lost.\r\nSuch reduction is due to the action of bacteria of the denitrifying\r\norder.[88] Or, on the other hand, nitrogen may be converted into some\r\nkind of insoluble form which seems to resist decomposition and lies in\r\nan inert condition in the soil utterly unavailable for the plants'\r\nneeds. A striking example of this retrogression of nitrogen seems to be\r\nafforded in the case of farmyard manure. It has been found in the\r\nRothamsted experiments, as has been pointed out in the preceding pages,\r\nthat when farmyard manure is applied, year after year, to the same land\r\nin large quantities, a very considerable percentage of its nitrogen does\r\nnot (_i.e._, within a reasonable number of years) become available for\r\nthe crop's uses. What, indeed, becomes of the nitrogen is a mystery; but\r\nit is highly probable that some such kind of retrogression as that above\r\nreferred to, whereby the nitrogen is converted into some inert organic\r\nform, takes place.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Artificial Sources of Loss of Nitrogen._\r\n\r\nSo far, the sources of loss of nitrogen considered have been what we may\r\nterm _natural_ sources. By this is meant that the loss of nitrogen from\r\nthe above sources takes place in a state of nature, and not merely under\r\nconditions of cultivation. No doubt the loss due to drainage is very\r\nmuch greater under arable farming than would be the case where\r\nartificial drainage does not obtain; still, under any conditions, this\r\nloss must be reckoned with. On the other hand, by _artificial_ sources\r\nof loss are meant those entirely dependent on our modern system of\r\nagriculture and our modern system of sewage disposal, whereby the\r\nnitrogen contained in that portion of the produce of the farm which goes\r\nto supply our food is not returned to the soil, but is totally lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amount of Nitrogen removed in Crops._\r\n\r\nThe modern tendency towards centralisation in large towns has rendered\r\nthis loss--despite all that has been said to the contrary--a necessity.\r\nIt is extremely difficult, however, to form any estimate of its amount.\r\nWe know, of course, the amount of nitrogen removed from the soil by\r\ndifferent crops. We cannot, however, estimate how much of this may find\r\nits way back again to the soil. The amount of nitrogen contained in the\r\ndifferent crops will be fully dealt with in the chapter on the manuring\r\nof different crops. It may be, however, not without interest to give\r\nhere some approximate indication of the amount of this loss, in order to\r\nrender the view of the subject as comprehensive as possible.\r\n\r\nRecent agricultural returns for Great Britain give the total produce of\r\n_wheat_ at over 76 million bushels, that of _barley_ at over 69 million,\r\nand that of _oats_ at over 150 million. Calculating the amount of\r\nnitrogen, these quantities of wheat, barley, and oats respectively and\r\ncollectively contain, and calculating also how much _sulphate of\r\nammonia_ and _nitrate of soda_ these amounts of nitrogen represent, the\r\nfollowing are the results:--\r\n\r\n                         Nitrogen.   Sulphate of   Nitrate of\r\n                                      Ammonia.       Soda.\r\n           Bushels.        Tons.        Tons.        Tons.\r\nWheat      76,224,940      37,432      176,465      227,266\r\nBarley     69,948,266      27,324      128,813      165,896\r\nOats      150,789,416      56,835      267,936      345,068\r\n          -----------     -------      -------      -------\r\nTotal     296,962,622     121,591      573,214      738,230\r\n          ===========     =======      =======      =======\r\n\r\nOf course these figures, so far as the amounts of nitrogen are\r\nconcerned, can only be regarded as approximate, as it is only possible\r\nin such calculations to obtain approximate results. Accepting these\r\ncalculations as merely approximate, they are, nevertheless, of the\r\nhighest interest and importance. It is of great importance to understand\r\nthat in the annual produce of our three common cereal crops--supposing\r\nthem to be all consumed off the farm--there is removed from the soil a\r\nquantity of nitrogen equal to that contained in over _half a million\r\ntons of sulphate of ammonia, and three quarters of a million tons of\r\nnitrate of soda._\r\n\r\nAs has already been remarked, it is impossible to estimate exactly what\r\nproportion of this total nitrogen finds its way back to the soil. In the\r\ncase of wheat, it may be pointed out that the portion which is used as a\r\nfeeding-stuff--viz., _bran_--is very much richer in nitrogen than the\r\nflour. While, then, we are unable to estimate with any exactitude this\r\nsource of loss of nitrogen, it cannot for a moment be doubted that it is\r\nenormous, from what has been already stated. We must remember that the\r\nportion of the crop richest in nitrogen is that which is generally\r\nremoved--the straw which is grown in producing a bushel of wheat,\r\nbarley, or oats, containing less than half the amount of nitrogen\r\ncontained by a bushel of the grain itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Losses of Nitrogen incurred on the Farm._\r\n\r\nIn addition to the loss due to removal of crops from the farm, there are\r\none or two other sources of loss which it may be well to briefly refer\r\nto.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Loss in Treatment of Farmyard Manure._\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that in the past a very considerable source of\r\nloss was the improper treatment of farmyard manure. The way in which\r\nthis loss may take place will be fully considered in the chapter on\r\nfarmyard manure. Suffice it to say here, that this may take place by\r\nvolatilisation of the nitrogen as carbonate of ammonia, caused by\r\ncarelessness in allowing the temperature of the manure-heap to rise too\r\nhigh; or by drainage of the soluble nitrogen compounds, caused by\r\nallowing the rich black liquor of the manure-heap to be washed away, and\r\nnot properly conserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nitrogen removed in Milk._\r\n\r\nAnother source of loss which is apt to be overlooked is the amount of\r\nnitrogen removed in milk. Professor Storer has calculated that in the\r\ncase of a cow giving 2000 quarts, or 4300 lb., of milk in a year, and\r\nthe milk being all sold as such, there would be carried away from the\r\nfarm 22 lb. of nitrogen.[89]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Economics of the Nitrogen question._\r\n\r\nAnd here, before concluding our survey of the different sources of loss\r\nof nitrogen, it may be well to regard for a moment the subject from a\r\nsomewhat wider standpoint than that from which we have been considering\r\nit. The total supply of nitrogen in a combined form is limited. As we\r\nhave pointed out, it may be regarded as the element on which, more than\r\nany other, life, animal as well as vegetable, depends. To animal life it\r\nis alone available in combined form; to vegetable life it is chiefly\r\nalso only available in combined form. In the air we have an unlimited\r\nquantity of nitrogen, but it is almost entirely in an _uncombined_ form,\r\nand therefore largely unavailable. The conversion of nitrogen from the\r\nfree state to a combined form is a process which takes place only very\r\nslowly. Any source which diminishes the sum-total of our already all too\r\nlimited supply of combined nitrogen must be regarded as worthy of most\r\nserious consideration. The question, therefore, of the artificial waste\r\nof nitrogen daily taking place around us, is one which ought to possess\r\nfor economists a very great interest indeed. This waste has, of late\r\nyears, enormously increased, and would seem to threaten us at no very\r\ndistant date with a nitrogen famine. It is incidental to the use of\r\ncertain nitrogenous substances in the manufacture of various articles,\r\nand to our present system of sewage disposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Loss of Nitrogen-compounds in the Arts._\r\n\r\nThe articles referred to are such as explosives, starch, textile\r\nsubstances, malt liquors, &c. The question is strikingly dealt with in\r\nan able paper on \"The Economy of Nitrogen\" in the 'Quarterly Journal of\r\nScience.'[90]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Loss due to Use of Gunpowder._\r\n\r\nThe explosives--more particularly gunpowder--are the most important of\r\nthese articles. Gunpowder contains 75 per cent of saltpetre, which in\r\nits turn contains about 10 per cent of nitrogen. When gunpowder\r\nexplodes, practically the whole of this nitrogen is converted into\r\n\"free\" nitrogen. The loss is thus in a sense irreparable. In the paper\r\nabove, referred to, our total annual exports of this substance are\r\nestimated at 19,000,000 lb.; while the total annual production of the\r\nworld is estimated at not less than 100,000,000 lb. The annual loss of\r\nnitrogen due to this source alone would amount to about 10,000,000\r\nlb.[91] Similarly, loss of nitrogen, although to a less extent, is\r\ncaused by the use of other explosives, as well as in the manufacture of\r\nthe other articles above mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Loss due to Sewage Disposal._\r\n\r\nThe loss due to our present system of sewage disposal has been already\r\ntaken into account in dealing with the loss due to removal of crops. It\r\nmay be well, however, to treat it from the sewage aspect. Taking the\r\namount of nitrogen in the excreta of every individual as, on an average,\r\nhalf an ounce, the annual amount voided in the excreta of the total\r\npopulation of the British Isles would amount to 365,000,000 lb.[92]--of\r\nthis, the amount in the London sewage alone being 91,000,000 lb.[93] By\r\nthe water system, which is almost universally adopted in this country,\r\nthe above quantity of nitrogen is entirely lost to the soil. A small\r\nportion of it, it may be argued, is eventually recovered in sea weed and\r\nfish, which may be used for manure. This, however, is to argue too much\r\n_sub specie aeternitatis_. Not all the nitrogen originally present in the\r\nexcreta finds its way into the sea; for it is highly probable that a\r\nconsiderable quantity escapes in the process of the decomposition of the\r\nsewage as \"free\" nitrogen.\r\n\r\nFrom the above statement of the sources of loss and gain of nitrogen\r\ntaking place in the soil, it may be pretty safe to conclude that while\r\nin a state of nature the gain balances the loss, if indeed it does not\r\ndo more, under conditions of arable farming such is very far from being\r\nthe case; and that if fertility of the land is to be maintained,\r\nrecourse to nitrogenous manures must be had,--in short, that the\r\napplication of artificial nitrogenous manures is a necessary condition\r\nof modern husbandry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Our Artificial Nitrogen Supply._\r\n\r\nBefore concluding this chapter, it may be interesting to enumerate very\r\nbriefly the chief sources of our artificial nitrogen supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nitrate of Soda and Sulphate of Ammonia._\r\n\r\nThe most important artificial nitrogenous manures in use at present are\r\nnitrate of soda and sulphate of ammonia. Of the former, the annual\r\nexportation from Chili is close on one million tons, of which quantity\r\nabout 120,000 tons is imported into the United Kingdom. Of sulphate of\r\nammonia, on the other hand, the total production in this country is\r\nabout 130,000 tons per annum,[94] the greater proportion of which is\r\nexported, leaving only from 30,000 to 40,000 tons for consumption.\r\nNitrate of soda, it must be remembered, is not entirely used for\r\nmanurial purposes, a small proportion of the above imports being used\r\nfor chemical manufacturing purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Peruvian Guano._\r\n\r\nPeruvian guano is another important nitrogenous manure very much less\r\nabundant now than formerly, as the different guano-beds have become\r\nnearly exhausted. While the imports of this important manure into the\r\nUnited Kingdom amounted in 1870 to nearly 250,000 tons, at present not\r\nmore than 11,000 tons are being imported.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bones._\r\n\r\nA further source of nitrogen is bones, which, of course, are chiefly\r\nvaluable as a phosphatic manure, but which contain also some 3 to 4 per\r\ncent of nitrogen. Of this valuable manure we import at present about\r\n30,000 tons, while about 60,000 tons are collected in this country,\r\nbringing up our total consumption to 100,000 tons.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Nitrogenous Manures._\r\n\r\nThe above mentioned are the most important of nitrogenous manures; there\r\nare, however, a number of other nitrogenous manures used in this country\r\nin very much smaller quantities. As most of these substances are made in\r\nthis country, it is very difficult to estimate the amount of their\r\nannual production with exactness. These substances are as follows:\r\nfish-guano, meat-meal guano, dried blood, shoddy, scutch, horns and\r\nhoofs, hair, bristles, feathers, leather-scrap, &c. Of fish-guano, the\r\ntotal consumption per annum may be put down at about 8000 tons, of which\r\na fourth is imported into this country, the remaining 6000 tons being\r\nmanufactured at home. Of meat-meal guano, dried blood, hoof-guano, &c.,\r\nabout 2500 tons are annually imported, the home production bringing up\r\nthe total amount to some 10,000 tons. Of shoddy, some 12,000 tons are\r\nmanufactured in this country; while scutch--the name given to a manure\r\nmanufactured from the waste products incidental to the manufacture of\r\nglue and the dressing of skins--is produced only to the extent of a few\r\nthousand tons annually.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact worthy of notice, that while the use of phosphatic manures\r\nhas increased very considerably of late years, the same cannot be said\r\nof nitrogen. According to Mr Hermann Voss, some 34,000[95] tons of\r\nnitrogen were used in the form of artificial manures in 1873, while now\r\nonly about 28,000 tons are used--_i.e._, some 6000 tons less.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Oil-seeds and Oilcakes._\r\n\r\nThere still remains a very important source of nitrogen which has not\r\nyet been mentioned, in the shape of oil-seeds and oilcakes, used for\r\nfeeding purposes. Oilcakes are both manufactured in this country and\r\nimported in large quantities. Recent Agricultural Returns show the total\r\nimports of oilcakes at 256,296 tons; that of linseed at 370,000 tons;\r\nthat of rape-seed at 80,000 tons; and that of cotton-seed at 289,413\r\ntons.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other imported Sources of Nitrogen._\r\n\r\nWe have further, in considering this question, to take into account the\r\nlarge amount of maize, peas, beans, wheat, and oats which are imported\r\ninto this country, a certain quantity of which is used as cattle-food,\r\nand will therefore go to enrich their manure. Also the imported straw\r\nused for purposes of litter must not be forgotten. In 1887 this amounted\r\nto 52,393 tons.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it may be asked how far are the artificial sources of\r\nnitrogen able to make good the loss? In the opinion of such a reliable\r\nauthority as Sir John Lawes, they do not. There are some soils which\r\ndepend almost entirely upon imported fertility, and could not be\r\ncultivated without it. Upon some of them it is possible that the imports\r\nof nitrogen are in excess of the exports. Taking the agricultural\r\nacreage as a whole, however, he is of opinion that there is a decided\r\nloss of nitrogen, which he estimates at _from 15 lb. to 20 lb. per acre\r\nper annum_.[96]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[63] The total amount of nitrogen in the air has been estimated\r\napproximately at four million billion tons.\r\n\r\n[64] See Introductory Chapter, pp. 40 to 45.\r\n\r\n[65] Although ammonia is more abundant than nitrates and nitrites, it\r\nonly amounts to a few parts per million of air. According to Muentz, the\r\nair at great heights contains more ammonia than in its lower strata. The\r\nopposite, however, is the case with regard to nitrates, which are only\r\nfound in air near the surface of the earth. See p. 49.\r\n\r\n[66] Nitric acid may also be formed by the oxidation of ammonia by\r\nozone, or peroxide of hydrogen.\r\n\r\n[67] According to Schloesing, the chief source of the ammonia present in\r\nthe air is the tropical ocean, which yields gradually to the atmosphere,\r\nunder the action of the powerful evaporation constantly going on, a\r\nlarge amount of nitrogen in this form. The sources of the nitrogen of\r\nthe ocean are the nitrates which it receives from the drainage of land,\r\nanimal and vegetable matter, sewage, &c.\r\n\r\n[68] See Appendix, Note I., p. 155.\r\n\r\n[69] To illustrate this point, it may be mentioned that on the least\r\nwindy of days, when the wind is only moving at the rate of two miles an\r\nhour--and this, it may he added, is so slow as to be scarcely\r\nnoticeable--the air in a space of 20 feet is changed over five hundred\r\ntimes in an hour. The combined nitrogen thus absorbed is probably\r\nentirely in the form of ammonia. It would seem so at any rate, from some\r\nexperiments by Schloesing. See p. 132.\r\n\r\n[70] No vegetable or animal cell exists which does not contain nitrogen.\r\n\r\n[71] This is less on the whole than what has been found in subsoils by\r\nContinental investigators. Thus, for example, A. Mueller found the\r\naverage of a number of analyses of subsoils to be .15 per cent., and the\r\nlate Dr Anderson found the nitrogen in the subsoil of different Scottish\r\nwheat-soils to run from .15 per cent to .97 per cent.\r\n\r\n[72] See Appendix, Note II., p. 156.\r\n\r\n[73] \"Under prolonged kitchen-garden culture the subsoil becomes\r\nenriched with nitrogenous matter to a far more considerable depth; this\r\nhas been shown by the analyses of the soil of the old kitchen-garden at\r\nRothamsted. This is doubtless due to the practice of deep trenching\r\nemployed by gardeners.\"--R. Warington, 'Lectures on Rothamsted\r\nExperiments.' U.S.A. Bulletin, p. 24.\r\n\r\n[74] The comparatively insignificant effect the addition of various\r\nnitrogenous manures have in increasing the total soil-nitrogen is\r\nstrikingly illustrated in the tables given in the Appendix, Note IV., p.\r\n157.\r\n\r\n[75] See Storer's Agric. Chem., vol. i. p. 357.\r\n\r\n[76] See Chapter IV., Appendix, Note VII., p. 198.\r\n\r\n[77] See Appendix, Note III., p. 157.\r\n\r\n[78] See Appendix, Note IV., p. 157.\r\n\r\n[79] See Appendix, Note I., p. 155.\r\n\r\n[80] The original source of the nitrogen in the soil must have been the\r\nnitrogen in the air. When plants first begin to grow on a purely mineral\r\nsoil, they must obtain nitrogen from some source. The small traces\r\nwashed down in the rain will supply sufficient nitrogen to enable a\r\nscanty growth of the lower forms of vegetable life; whereas these by\r\ntheir decay furnish their successors with a more abundant source, which\r\nrapidly increases, until we have a fair percentage of humus accumulated.\r\n\r\n[81] See Appendix, Note V., p. 158.\r\n\r\n[82] See Historical Introduction, pp. 40-45.\r\n\r\n[83] The evidence demonstrating this is to be found in the fact that the\r\namount of carbon found in different soils rises or falls in proportion\r\nto the nitrogen. See p. 126.\r\n\r\n[84] See Chapter IV. on Nitrification.\r\n\r\n[85] Diffusion as well as capillary attraction is a means of bringing\r\nnitrates again to the surface-soil after rain.\r\n\r\n[86] See Appendix, Note VI., p. 158, and Note VIII., p. 160; also p.\r\n154.\r\n\r\n[87] See Appendix, Note VII., p. 159.\r\n\r\n[88] See following Chapter on Nitrification, p. 178.\r\n\r\n[89] According to the Agricultural Returns for 1888, the number of cows\r\nin milk in Great Britain amounted to 2,450,444. If we multiply this\r\nnumber by 22 the result is 54,000,000 lb., or in tons 24,107. This\r\nquantity represents 154,067 tons of ordinary commercial nitrate of soda.\r\n\r\n[90] For 1878 (p. 146 _et seq._) The reader interested in the subject is\r\nreferred to the paper itself.\r\n\r\n[91] In tons 4464, and represents 28,530 tons of nitrate of soda.\r\n\r\n[92] This in tons 162,946, which represents 1,041,384 tons of nitrate of\r\nsoda.\r\n\r\n[93] This in tons 40,625, which represents 259,633 tons of nitrate of\r\nsoda. See paper in 'Journal of Science' already referred to.\r\n\r\n[94] Europe's total production may be stated at 200,000 tons.\r\n\r\n[95] 10,500 tons of which were as guano.\r\n\r\n[96] Mr Warington estimates this at about 8 lb. See p. 141.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE I.

In nature the nitrogen, present in the soil as\r\nammonia and different organic forms, is constantly being converted into\r\nnitric acid. This conversion of nitrogen into nitrates, known as\r\n_nitrification_, is a process of very great importance, and, as has been\r\nalready pointed out in the Introductory Chapter, is effected through the\r\nagency of micro-organisms (ferments).[97] The process of nitrification,\r\nas well as the nature of the other changes taking place in the soil\r\nbetween the various compounds of nitrogen, are as yet but most\r\nimperfectly understood, but much light has been thrown on this most\r\ninteresting department of agricultural research during the last few\r\nyears; and it cannot be doubted that the increased attention which it is\r\nreceiving from different investigators, both on the Continent and in\r\nthis country, will be fraught with most important results for practical\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Occurrence of Nitrates in the Soil._\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of nitre,[98] or potassium nitrate, in soils has been\r\nlong known, although it is only within the last few years that we have\r\nobtained any precise knowledge with regard to the mode of its\r\nproduction. While its amount in most soils, especially in this\r\ncountry,[99] is very minute, there are certain parts of the world where\r\nnitrates are found in large quantities. The nitrate fields of Chili and\r\nPeru are the chief natural sources of nitrates, and they are referred to\r\nin the chapter on Nitrate of Soda. We have other parts of the world,\r\nhowever (in China and India), where soils rich in nitre occur, and which\r\nin the past have formed a source of the commercial article.[100]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nitre Soils of India._\r\n\r\nThe most important of these nitre soils are those found in the\r\nNorth-west of India, in the province of Bengal. In these districts the\r\nsoil is of a light porous texture, rich in lime, and situated at a\r\nconsiderable height above water-level. They are the sites of old\r\nvillages, and the nitre is found in the form of an efflorescence on the\r\nsurface of different parts of the soil. The occurrence of nitre under\r\nsuch conditions is due, partly to the natural richness of the soil in\r\nnitrogen, and partly to its artificial enrichment through receiving the\r\nnitrogenous excrements of the inhabitants of the villages and their\r\ncattle. The constant process of evaporation going on in such a warm\r\nclimate has the effect of inducing an upward tendency of the soil-water,\r\nthe result being a concentration of all the nitre the soil contains in\r\nits surface layer. This goes on until a regular incrustation is formed,\r\nand the soil is covered by a white deposit of nitre. Whenever this\r\nbecomes apparent, the surface portion of the soil is scraped off by the\r\n_sorawallah_, or native manufacturer, and collected and treated for the\r\npurpose of recovering, in a pure state, the saltpetre.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Saltpetre Plantations._\r\n\r\nThe large demand for saltpetre, larger than could be supplied by these\r\nnitre soils, soon gave rise to the semi-artificial method of production,\r\nformerly so largely practised in Switzerland, France, Germany, Sweden,\r\nand in many other parts of the Continent, by means of the so-called\r\n\"nitre beds,\" \"nitraries,\" or \"saltpetre plantations.\" Previous to the\r\nintroduction of this method of manufacture, the demand for saltpetre for\r\ngunpowder had become so great, that every source of nitre was eagerly\r\nsought for. Thus, when it was discovered that the earth from the floors\r\nof byres, stables, and farmyards were particularly rich in nitre, and\r\nwhen mixed with wood-ashes formed an important source of it, the right\r\nto remove these in France was vested in the Government under the\r\nSaltpetre Laws, which obtained till the French Revolution. This great\r\nscarcity soon led, however, to a careful investigation being made into\r\nthe conditions under which potassium nitrate was formed in nitre\r\nsoils.[101] These conditions, which included the presence of rich\r\nnitrogenous matter, warmth, free aeration of the soil, and a certain\r\nproportion of moisture, became, in the course of years, more and more\r\nthoroughly understood, and the result was the institution of numerous\r\n\"saltpetre plantations.\" These generally consisted of heaps of mould,\r\nrich in nitrogen, mixed with decomposing animal matter, rubbish of\r\nvarious kinds, manurial substances, ashes, road-scrapings, and lime\r\nsalts.[102] The heap was interlaid with brushwood, and was watered from\r\ntime to time with liquid manure from stables, consisting chiefly of\r\ndilute urine. In forming the heap care was taken to keep the mass\r\nporous, so as to admit of the free access of air. The heap was further\r\nprotected from the rain by covering it with a roof. In course of time\r\nconsiderable quantities of nitrates were developed, and the nitre was\r\noccasionally collected by scraping it from the surface, where it became\r\nconcentrated just as in the nitre soils. In all cases, however, the\r\nheaps, when considered rich enough in nitre, were treated from time to\r\ntime with water which, by subsequent evaporation, yielded the nitre in a\r\nmore or less pure condition.[103]\r\n\r\nThis mode of obtaining nitre is no longer practised to any extent, since\r\nit is now more conveniently obtained from the treatment of nitrate of\r\nsoda with potassium chloride.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cause of Nitrification._\r\n\r\nWe have adverted to these nitre plantations as showing how the\r\nconditions most favourable for the development of nitrification were\r\nrecognised long before anything was known as to the true nature of the\r\nprocess. It was only in 1877 that the formation of nitrates in the soil\r\nwas proved to be due to the action of micro-organic life,[104] by the\r\ntwo French chemists, Schloesing and Muentz, who discovered the fact when\r\ncarrying out experiments to see if the presence of humic matter was\r\nessential to the purification of sewage by soil. In these experiments\r\nsewage was made to filter slowly through a certain depth of soil (the\r\ntime occupied in this filtration being eight days). It was found that\r\nnitrification of the sewage took place. By treating the soil with\r\nchloroform[105] it was found that it no longer possessed the power of\r\ninducing the nitrification of the sewage. When, however, a small portion\r\nof a nitrifying soil was added, the power was regained. From this it was\r\nnaturally inferred that nitrification was effected by some kind of\r\nferment. This conclusion was soon confirmed by subsequent experiments by\r\nWarington at Rothamsted, who showed that the power of nitrification\r\ncould be communicated to media, which did not nitrify, by simply\r\nseeding them with a nitrifying substance, and that light was\r\nunfavourable to the process. Since then the question has formed the\r\nsubject of a number of researches by Mr Warington at Rothamsted, as well\r\nas by Schloesing and Muentz, Munro, Deherain, P. F. Frankland,\r\nWinogradsky, Gayon and Dupetit, Kellner, Plath, Pichard, Landolt, Leone,\r\nand others. From these researches we have obtained the following\r\ninformation with regard to the nature of the organisms concerned in this\r\nprocess, and the conditions most favourable for their development.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ferments effecting Nitrification._\r\n\r\nThe importance of isolating and studying them microscopically was\r\nrecognised at an early period in these researches. Messrs Schloesing and\r\nMuentz were the first to attempt this. They reported that they had\r\nsuccessfully accomplished this, and described the organism as consisting\r\nof very small, round, or slightly elongated corpuscles, occurring either\r\nsingly or two together. According, however, to the most recent\r\nresearches of Warington, Winogradsky, and P. F. Frankland, nitrification\r\nis not effected by a _single_ micro-organism, but by _two_, both of\r\nwhich have been successfully isolated and studied.[106] The first of\r\nthese to be discovered and isolated was the _nitrous_ organism, which\r\neffects the conversion of ammonia into nitrous acid; the second, which\r\nhas only been lately isolated by Warington and Winogradsky, effects the\r\nconversion of nitrous acid into nitric acid. Each of these ferments thus\r\nhas its distinctive function to perform in this most important process,\r\nthe nitric ferment being unable to act on ammonia, as the nitrous\r\nferment is unable to convert nitrites into nitrates. Both ferments occur\r\nin enormous quantities in the soil, and seem to be influenced, so far as\r\nis at present known, by the same conditions. Their action will thus\r\nproceed together. Nearly all we know as yet on the subject of their\r\nnature is with regard to the nitrous ferment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Appearance of Nitrous Organism._\r\n\r\nMr Warington[107] thus describes the appearance of the nitrous organism:\r\n\"As found in suspension in a freshly nitrified solution, it consists\r\nlargely of nearly spherical corpuscles, varying extremely in size. The\r\nlargest of these corpuscles barely reaches a diameter of 1/1000th of a\r\nmillimeter; and some are so minute as to be hardly discernible in\r\nphotographs, although shown there with a surface one million times\r\ngreater than their own. The larger ones are frequently not strictly\r\ncircular. These forms are universally present in nitrifying cultures.\r\nThe larger organisms are sometimes seen in the act of dividing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nitric Organism._\r\n\r\nSo far as at present known, the nitric organism is very similar in\r\nappearance to the nitrous organism, so much so that it is difficult to\r\ndistinguish the one from the other. As the same conditions influence\r\ntheir development, the process may be regarded as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Difficulty in isolating them._\r\n\r\nA great difficulty has been experienced in the attempt to isolate these\r\nmicro-organisms for the purpose of studying their nature. This arises\r\nfrom the fact that they refuse to grow on the ordinary solid cultivating\r\nmedia used by bacteriologists. Winogradsky, however, has recently\r\nsucceeded in cultivating them in _a purely mineral_ medium--viz.,\r\n_silica-jelly_.[108]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nitrifying Organisms do not require Organic Matter._\r\n\r\nThe fact that they can develop in media destitute of organic matter, is\r\none of very great interest and importance to Vegetable Physiology. It\r\nimplies that they can derive their carbon from carbonic acid--a power\r\nwhich it was believed was possessed by green plants alone among living\r\nstructures. For organisms destitute of chlorophyll, the source of their\r\nprotoplasmic carbon, it has been hitherto commonly believed, must be\r\n_organic matter_ of some sort. While it would appear that the nitrifying\r\norganisms can, when opportunity affords, feed upon organic matter, yet\r\nit has been proved beyond doubt that they can also freely develop in\r\nmedia entirely devoid of it, and are capable, under such circumstances,\r\nof deriving their carbon from a purely mineral source.[109] This fact,\r\nwhich is subversive of what was believed to be a fundamental law of\r\nVegetable Physiology, is one of the most important of the many important\r\nand interesting facts which these nitrification researches have\r\nelicited.[110]\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS FAVOURABLE FOR NITRIFICATION.\r\n\r\nWe may now proceed to discuss the conditions favourable for\r\nnitrification.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Presence of Food-constituents._\r\n\r\nAmong these conditions the first is the presence of certain\r\nfood-constituents. To both animal and vegetable life alike a certain\r\namount of mineral food is absolutely necessary. Among these phosphoric\r\nacid is one of the most important, and in the experiments on\r\nnitrification it has been found that the nitrifying organisms will not\r\ndevelop in any medium destitute of it. That other mineral\r\nfood-constituents are necessary is highly probable, although the\r\ninfluence of their absence on the development of the process has not\r\nbeen similarly studied. Probably potash, magnesia, and lime salts are\r\nnecessary. In the cultivating solutions used in the experiments on the\r\nsubject, the mineral food-constituents added consisted of lime,\r\nmagnesia, and potash salts and phosphoric acid.[111]\r\n\r\nAs we have seen above, the presence of organic matter is not necessary\r\nfor the process. In this respect these organisms are differentiated from\r\nall other ferments hitherto discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Presence of a Salifiable Base._\r\n\r\nThe presence of a sufficient quantity of a base in the soil with which\r\nthe nitric acid may combine, when it is formed, is another necessary\r\ncondition.[112] The process only goes on in a slightly alkaline\r\nsolution. The substance which acts as this salifiable base is _lime_.\r\nThe presence of a sufficient quantity of carbonate of lime in the soil\r\nwill thus be seen to be of first-rate importance. This furnishes an\r\nexplanation of one of the many benefits conferred by lime on soils. The\r\nactivity of nitrification in many soils may be hindered by the absence\r\nof a sufficiency of lime salts, and in such cases most striking results\r\nmay follow the application of moderate dressings of chalk. The absence\r\nof the nitrifying organisms in certain soils, such as peaty and forest\r\nsoils, may be thus accounted for. In such soils humic acids are present\r\nand the requisite alkalinity is thus awanting.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Only takes place in slightly Alkaline Solutions._\r\n\r\nBut while a certain slight amount of alkalinity is necessary, this must\r\nnot exceed a certain strength, otherwise the process is retarded. This\r\nis the reason why strong urine solutions do not nitrify. The amount of\r\ncarbonate of ammonia generated in them by putrefaction renders the\r\ndevelopment of nitrification impossible by rendering the alkalinity of\r\nthe solution too great.[113] The practical importance of this fact is\r\nconsiderable, as it shows the importance of diluting urine very\r\nconsiderably before applying it as a manure. Similarly, when large\r\nquantities of lime, especially burnt lime, are applied to soils, the\r\nresult will be to arrest the action of nitrification for the time. The\r\npresence of alkaline carbonates in the soil, unless in minute\r\nquantities, is apt, therefore, to seriously interfere with the\r\nprocess.[114]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Action of Gypsum on Nitrification._\r\n\r\nIt has been found by Pichard that the action of certain mineral\r\nsulphates is extremely favourable to the process, and among these\r\n_gypsum_. Warington has carried out some experiments on the action of\r\ngypsum in promoting nitrification. The reason of its favourable action\r\nis probably because it neutralises the alkalinity of nitrifying\r\nsolutions. It thus permits the process to go on in unfavourable\r\nconditions. Where, therefore, too great alkalinity exists for the\r\nmaximum development of nitrification, the best specific will be found to\r\nbe gypsum.[115] The practical value of gypsum as an adjunct to certain\r\nmanurial substances, where nitrification is desired to be promoted as\r\nrapidly as possible, such as sewage and farmyard manure, will thus at\r\nonce become apparent. So far as there is a proper degree of alkalinity\r\nmaintained, the presence of large quantities of saline matter does not\r\nseem to interfere with the process.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Presence of Oxygen._\r\n\r\nThe nitrification bacteria belong, it would seem, to the aerobic[116]\r\nclass of ferment--_i.e._, they cannot develop without a free supply of\r\noxygen. Exclusion of the air is sufficient to kill them, and in those\r\nportions of the soil where access of air is not freely permitted,\r\nnitrification will be found to be correspondingly feeble. Thus it has\r\nbeen found in experiments with different portions of soils, that but\r\nlittle signs of nitrification occur in the lower soil layers. According\r\nto experiments by Schloesing on a moist soil, in atmospheres\r\nrespectively containing no oxygen and varying quantities of it, the\r\naction of oxygen in promoting nitrification was strikingly demonstrated.\r\nIn an atmosphere of pure nitrogen, entirely devoid of oxygen, the\r\nprocess no longer took place, but the nitrates already present in the\r\nsoil were reduced and free nitrogen was evolved. In an atmosphere, on\r\nthe other hand, containing 1.5 per cent of oxygen, a considerable amount\r\nof nitrification took place; while in the presence of 6 per cent,\r\nnitrification took place to double the extent. An addition of 10 to 15\r\nper cent again doubled the quantity. When the amount of moisture added\r\nwas increased, the effect of larger percentages of oxygen was found to\r\nbe less marked. The reason of this is that the oxygen probably acts as\r\ndissolved oxygen; the addition of water meaning at the same time an\r\naddition of available oxygen. This condition exemplifies the value of\r\ntillage operations. The more thoroughly a soil is tilled the more\r\nthoroughly will the aeration of its particles take place, and\r\nconsequently the more favourable will this necessary condition of\r\nnitrification be rendered. The benefits conferred on clayey soils by\r\ntillage will in this respect be especially great.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Temperature._\r\n\r\nAnother of the conditions determining the rate at which nitrification\r\ntakes place, and one which is most important, is _Temperature_.\r\nAccording to Schloesing and Muentz the temperature at which maximum\r\ndevelopment takes place is 37 deg. C.[117] (99 deg. F.), at which temperature it\r\nis ten times as active as at 14 deg. C. (57 deg. F.) Below 5 deg. C. (40 deg. F.) the\r\naction is extremely feeble. It is clearly appreciable at 12 deg. C. (54 deg.\r\nF.), and from there up to 37 deg. C. (99 deg. F.) it rapidly increases. From 37 deg.\r\nC. (99 deg. F.) to 55 deg. C. (131 deg. F.), at which temperature no nitrification\r\ntakes place, its activity decreases; at 45 deg. C. (113 deg. F.) it is less\r\nactive than at 15 deg. C. (59 deg. F.), and at 50 deg. C. (122 deg. F.) it is very\r\nslight. These results by Schloesing and Muentz have not been exactly\r\nconfirmed by Warington. He has found that a considerable amount of\r\nnitrification goes on at a temperature between 3 deg. and 4 deg. C. (37 deg. and 39 deg.\r\nF.), while the highest temperature at which he has found it to take\r\nplace is considerably lower than 55 deg. C. (131 deg. F.) Thus he was unable to\r\nstart nitrification in a solution maintained at 40 deg. C. (104 deg. F.) It\r\nwould thus seem that the nitrifying ferments are able to develop at\r\nlower temperatures than most organisms; and although nitrification\r\nentirely ceases during frost, yet in a climate such as our own there\r\nmust be a considerable proportion of the winter during which\r\nnitrification is moderately active.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Presence of a sufficient quantity of Moisture._\r\n\r\nThe presence of moisture in a soil is another of the necessary\r\nconditions of nitrification. It has been shown that it is at once\r\narrested, and indeed destroyed, by desiccation. Other conditions being\r\nequal, and up to a certain extent, the more moisture a soil contains the\r\nmore rapid is the process. Too much water, however, is unfavourable, as\r\nit is apt to exclude the free access of air, which, as we have just\r\nshown, is so necessary, as well as to lower the temperature. During a\r\nperiod of drought the rate at which nitrification takes place will,\r\ntherefore, be apt to be seriously diminished.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Absence of strong Sunlight._\r\n\r\nIt has been found that the process goes on much more actively in\r\ndarkness; indeed Warington has found in his experiments that\r\nnitrification could be arrested by simply exposing the vessel in which\r\nit was going on to the action of sunshine.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nitrifying Organisms destroyed by Poisons._\r\n\r\nIt has already been pointed out that nitrification is arrested by the\r\naction of antiseptics, such as chloroform, bisulphide of carbon, and\r\ncarbolic acid. Another substance which has been found to have an\r\ninjurious action is ferrous sulphate or \"copperas,\" a substance which is\r\napt to be present in badly drained soils, or soils in which there is\r\nmuch actively putrefying organic matter. Maercker has found that in moor\r\nsoils containing ferrous sulphate, no nitrates, or mere traces of\r\nnitrates, could be found. A substance such as gas-lime, unless submitted\r\nto the action of the atmosphere for some time, would also have a bad\r\neffect in checking nitrification, owing to the poisonous sulphur\r\ncompounds it contains. Common salt, it would seem, also arrests the\r\nprocess; and this antiseptic property which salt exercises on\r\nnitrification throws a certain amount of light on the nature of its\r\naction when applied, as it is often done, along with artificial\r\nnitrogenous manures.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Denitrification._\r\n\r\nIn connection with the process of nitrification, it is of interest to\r\nnotice that a process of an opposite nature may also take place in\r\nsoils--viz., _denitrification_--a process which consists in reducing the\r\nnitrates to nitrites, nitrous oxide, or free nitrogen. That a reduction\r\nof nitrates takes place in the decomposition of sewage with the\r\nevolution of free nitrogen, was a fact first observed by the late Dr\r\nAngus Smith in 1867; and the reduction of nitrates to nitrites, and\r\nnitric and nitrous oxides in putrefactive changes has been subsequently\r\nnoticed by different experimenters, who have further observed that such\r\nreduction takes place in the case of putrefaction going on in the\r\npresence of large quantities of water or where there is much organic\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Denitrification also effected by Bacteria._\r\n\r\nThis change was supposed to be of a purely chemical nature, and it has\r\nonly been recently discovered that it is effected, like nitrification,\r\nby means of bacteria. It has been surmised by some that the action of\r\ndenitrification may be effected by the same organisms that effect\r\nnitrification, and that it depends on merely external conditions which\r\nprocess goes on. There is no reason, however, to suppose that this is\r\nso, and several of the denitrifying organisms have been identified.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conditions favourable for Denitrification._\r\n\r\nThat it is a process that goes on to any extent in properly cultivated\r\nsoils is not to be supposed. The conditions which favour denitrification\r\nare exactly the opposite of those which favour nitrification. It is only\r\nwhen oxygen is excluded, or, which practically means the same thing,\r\nwhen large quantities of organic matter are in active putrefaction, and\r\nthe supply of oxygen is therefore deficient, that denitrification takes\r\nplace. Schloesing, as we have already seen, found that in the case of a\r\nmoist soil, kept in an atmosphere devoid of oxygen, a reduction of its\r\nnitrates to free nitrogen took place.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Takes place in water-logged Soils._\r\n\r\nThe exclusion of oxygen from a soil may be effected by saturating the\r\nsoil with water; and Warington has found in experiments carried out in\r\nan arable soil, by no means rich in organic matter, that complete\r\nreduction of nitrates may be effected in this way. It would thus seem\r\nthat the process of denitrification will take place in water-logged\r\nsoils, or in the putrefaction of sewage matter in the presence of large\r\nquantities of water. Whether this reduction will result in the\r\nproduction of nitrites, nitrous oxide, or free nitrogen, depends on\r\ndifferent conditions. This process is one of great importance from an\r\neconomic point of view, as it reveals to us a source of loss which may\r\ntake place in the fermentation of manures. In the rotting of our\r\nfarmyard manure it is possible that the denitrifying organisms may be\r\nmore active than we have hitherto suspected, and that a considerable\r\nloss of nitrogen may in this way be effected.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Distribution of the Nitrifying Organisms in the Soil._\r\n\r\nThe nitrifying organisms are probably chiefly confined to the soil, and\r\ndo not usually occur in rain or in the atmosphere. That, however, they\r\nare found in spots which we might be inclined to think extremely\r\nunlikely, is shown by some recent interesting researches carried out by\r\nMuentz, who discovered that the bare surfaces of felspathic, calcareous,\r\nschistose, and other rocks at the summit of mountains in the Pyrenees,\r\nAlps, and Vosges, yielded large numbers of them, and that they occurred\r\nto a considerable depth in the cracks and fissures of the rocks. The\r\nnitrifying organisms are also found in river-water, in sewage, and\r\nwell-waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Depth down at which they occur._\r\n\r\nIn Warington's earlier experiments, the conclusion he arrived at was\r\nthat the occurrence of the nitrifying organisms was almost entirely\r\nlimited to the superficial layers of the soil, and that they were seldom\r\nto be met with much below a depth of 18 inches. His subsequent\r\nexperiments, however, considerably modified this conclusion, and showed\r\nthat nitrification may take place to a depth of at least 6 feet.[118]\r\nBut although it may take place at this depth, it probably, as a general\r\nrule, is limited to the surface-soil, as it is only there the conditions\r\nfor obtaining circulation of air are sufficiently favourable. A great\r\ndeal, of course, will depend on the nature of the soil--_i.e._, as to\r\nits texture. In a clayey subsoil the principal hindrance to\r\nnitrification will be the difficulty of obtaining sufficient aeration.\r\nIn clay soils it is probable, therefore, that nearly all the\r\nnitrification goes on in the surface layer; in sandy soils it may take\r\nplace to a greater depth.[119]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Action of Plant-roots in promoting Nitrification._\r\n\r\nIn this connection the action of plant-roots in permitting a more\r\nabundant access of air to the lower layers of the soil, and thus\r\npromoting nitrification, is worth noticing. This has been observed in\r\nthe case of different crops. Thus the action of nitrification has been\r\nfound to be more marked in the lower layers of a soil on which a\r\nleguminous crop was growing than on that on which a gramineous. \"The\r\nconditions which would favour nitrification in the subsoil are such as\r\nwould enable air to penetrate it, as artificial drainage, a dry season,\r\nthe growth of a luxuriant crop causing much evaporation of the water in\r\nthe soil. Such conditions, by removing the water that fills the pores of\r\nthe subsoil, will cause the air to penetrate more or less deeply and\r\nrender nitrification possible. Subsoil nitrification will thus be most\r\nactive in the drier periods of the year\" (Warington).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nature of Substances capable of Nitrification._\r\n\r\nWhat kinds of nitrogenous substances are capable of undergoing this\r\nprocess of nitrification are not yet well known. The question is, of\r\ncourse, one of great importance, as the rapidity with which a\r\nnitrogenous body nitrifies will be an important factor in determining\r\nits value as a manure. Unfortunately, on this subject we know, as yet,\r\nvery little. We are well aware that the nitrogen present in the humic\r\nmatter of the soil is readily nitrifiable. In the experiments on\r\nnitrification the nitrogenous bodies used have been chiefly ammonia\r\nsalts, so that it is difficult to say whether, in the case of other\r\nnitrogenous substances, micro-organic life of a different sort has not\r\nalso been active and has converted the nitrogen into ammonia, and\r\nthereby prepared the way for the process of nitrification.\r\n\r\nThat various manures, such as bones, horn, wool, and rape-cake are\r\nreadily nitrifiable, has been shown by experiment. Laboratory\r\nexperiments have also been carried out on such different nitrogenous\r\nsubstances as ethylamine, thiocyanates, gelatin, urea, asparagin, and\r\nalbuminoids of milk. But in all these experiments, how far these bodies\r\nhave been directly acted upon by the nitrifying organisms, or how far\r\nthey have first undergone a preparatory change in which their nitrogen\r\nhas been first converted into ammonia, is impossible to say. It is at\r\nleast quite probable that all the organic forms of nitrogen have first\r\nto be converted into ammonia ere they are nitrified.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rate at which Nitrification takes place_.\r\n\r\nA question which is practically of no little importance is the rate at\r\nwhich nitrification takes place. From what has been already said as to\r\nthe nature of the conditions favourable for the process, it will be at\r\nonce seen that this will depend on how far these conditions are present\r\nin the soil. In point of fact the rate at which nitrification takes\r\nplace will vary very much in different soils. A greater difference,\r\nhowever, in the rate at which it takes place, will be found even in the\r\nsame soils at different periods of the year. In this country, where the\r\nmost favourable temperature for its development is seldom reached, it\r\nnever goes on at the same rate as in tropical climates. One of the\r\ncauses of the greater fertility of tropical soils is due, doubtless, to\r\nthe very much longer duration of the period of nitrification, as well as\r\nto its greater intensity. As, however, temperature is not the only\r\ncondition, and the presence of moisture is quite as necessary, it may be\r\nthat its development is seriously retarded in many tropical climates by\r\nthe extreme dryness of the soil during long periods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Takes place chiefly during the Summer Months_.\r\n\r\nAlthough in this climate, as has already been pointed out, nitrification\r\nprobably goes on during most of the winter months, owing to the fact\r\nthat the temperature of our soils is only occasionally below the\r\nminimum temperature at which the process takes place, yet there can be\r\nlittle doubt that the great bulk of the soil-nitrates are produced\r\nduring a few months in summer. A fair conception of this amount is\r\nafforded by the interesting experiments on the composition of\r\ndrainage-waters made at Rothamsted, which we shall have occasion to\r\nrefer to immediately. It may be pointed out, however, that it is not\r\nalways safe to take the amount of nitrates found in drainage-waters as\r\nan infallible indication of this rate, for this amount will depend to a\r\ncertain extent on the amount of rainfall, and would be misleading in the\r\ncase of a long period of drought. On the whole, however, it furnishes us\r\nwith extremely useful data for the elucidation of this important\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Process goes on most quickly in Fallow Fields._\r\n\r\nIt has been shown in the Rothamsted experiments that the process goes on\r\nbest in fields lying in bare fallow; and in this fact lies the\r\nexplanation of one of the many reasons why the practice of leaving\r\nfields in bare fallow, so common in past times, and still practised in\r\nthe case of clay soils in some parts of the country, was so beneficial\r\nto the land thus treated. But despite this fact, the practice of leaving\r\nsoils in bare fallow can scarcely be justified from this point of view,\r\nas the loss of nitrates through the action of rain is very great in our\r\nmoist climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Laboratory Experiments on Rate of Nitrification._\r\n\r\nSeveral interesting experiments have been carried out with the object of\r\naffording data for estimating the rate at which the process may go on in\r\nour soils under certain conditions. An old experiment, carried out by\r\nBoussingault, illustrates, in a general way, how rapid the process is\r\nunder favourable circumstances. A small portion of rich soil was placed\r\non a slab protected by a glass roof, and was moistened from time to time\r\nwith water. The amount of nitrate of potash formed under these\r\ncircumstances was estimated from time to time during a period of two\r\nmonths. During the first month (August) the percentage was increased\r\nfrom .01 to .18 (equal to about 5 cwt. of nitrate of potash per acre).\r\nThe increase during the second month (September) was very much\r\nless,--indeed only about a seventh of the amount.[120] The soil\r\nexperimented with was an extremely rich garden soil, and all the\r\nconditions for nitrification were most favourable.\r\n\r\nOf recent experiments on the rate of nitrification, the most striking,\r\nperhaps, are those by Schloesing. He mixed sulphate of ammonia with a\r\nquantity of soil fairly rich in organic matter, and containing 19 per\r\ncent of water. During the twelve days of active nitrification no less\r\nthan 56 parts of nitrogen per million of soil were nitrified per day.\r\nTaking the soil to a depth of 9 inches, this would be equal to more\r\nthan 1 cwt. per acre--an amount of nitrogen equal to that contained in\r\n6 cwt. of commercial nitrate of soda. These experiments are interesting\r\nas showing what is probably the maximum rate of nitrification under the\r\nmost favourable circumstances, and where there is an abundant supply of\r\neasily nitrifiable nitrogen. That nitrification ever takes place in our\r\nsoils to this extent is not to be for a moment supposed.\r\n\r\nWarington, in his Rothamsted experiments, has found that the greatest\r\nrate, working with ordinary arable soil (first 9 inches) from the\r\nRothamsted farm, was .588 parts per million of air-dried soil per\r\nday--_i.e._, 1.3 lb. per acre (equal to about 8 lb. of nitrate of soda).\r\nSimilar soil, when supplied with ammonia salts, showed nearly double\r\nthis quantity. Higher results were obtained by Lawes and Gilbert with\r\nrich Manitoba soils, the average rate being .7 parts per million per\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe last of these interesting laboratory experiments on the rate of\r\nnitrification we shall refer to, are those by Deherain. He experimented\r\nwith soils containing different amounts of nitrogen and moisture. With a\r\nsoil containing .16 per cent of nitrogen he obtained, during a period of\r\n90 days, rates of nitrification varying from .71 to 1.09 per million\r\nparts of soil. The maximum quantity was formed when the soil contained\r\n25 per cent of moisture. On a soil considerably richer--viz.,.261 per\r\ncent of nitrogen--a higher rate of nitrification took place--1.48 parts\r\nper million. The highest rate obtained in these experiments showed,\r\nwhen calculated to pounds per acre, about 5-1/2, taking the soil to a\r\ndepth of 9 inches. When the soil was alternately dried and moistened the\r\nprocess was most rapid.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Portion of Soil-nitrogen more easily Nitrifiable than the rest._\r\n\r\nLastly, it may be noticed that in the above-cited experiments, and\r\nothers of a similar kind, the process goes on most rapidly at first, and\r\nsteadily diminishes thereafter. This is due to the fact, that there is\r\ngenerally a certain quantity of nitrogen in most soils in a more easily\r\nnitrifiable condition than the rest, so that when this becomes oxidised\r\nnitrification proceeds more slowly. It would further seem that the\r\nnitrogen of the subsoil is less easily nitrified than that of the\r\nsurface-soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rate of Nitrification deduced from Field Experiments._\r\n\r\nWhile the above experiments throw much light on the question of the rate\r\nat which nitrification may go on under different circumstances, the\r\nresults furnished by actual analyses of soils and their drainage-waters\r\nare of still more practical value; and the Rothamsted experiments\r\nfortunately furnish us with a number of these valuable results.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quantity of Nitrates formed in the soils of Fallow Fields._\r\n\r\nThese researches had to be carried out on soil taken from fields lying\r\nin bare fallow; for no true estimate of the amount of nitrates formed\r\ncould have been obtained from _cropped_ fields. In the first 27 inches\r\nof soil of six separate fields, nitrate-nitrogen was found to vary from\r\n36.3 lb. to 59.9 lb. per acre. In four of these fields the largest\r\nproportion was found in the first 9 inches of soil; in the remaining\r\ntwo, in the second 9 inches; while the third 9 inches in two fields\r\nshowed almost as large a proportion as the first 9 inches.[121]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Position of Nitrates depends on Season._\r\n\r\nThe position of nitrates in the soil depends largely on the season; for,\r\nas has been already pointed out, their production is almost entirely\r\nlimited to the surface-soil, and it is only by being washed down in rain\r\nthat they find their way to the lower layers. A wet season, therefore,\r\nhas the effect of increasing their percentage in the lower soil-layers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nitrates in Drainage-waters._\r\n\r\nAs there is a certain proportion of nitrates that finds its way even\r\nbelow the first 27 inches of soil, the above results do not show their\r\ntotal production. To accurately estimate this amount we must ascertain\r\nthe quantity escaping in drainage-water. Here, again, the Rothamsted\r\nexperiments furnish us with valuable data. The amount found in\r\ndrainage-waters of course naturally varies very much, and depends\r\nlargely on the rainfall; but taking an average of twelve years, this has\r\nbeen found to amount to between 30 and 40 lb. per acre--an amount not so\r\nvery far short of that found in the first 27 inches of the soil itself.\r\nThis was from comparatively poor soil, it must be remembered, and a much\r\nlarger quantity would undoubtedly be produced in the case of richer\r\nsoils. Adding then the results together, we find that in soils like\r\nthose at Rothamsted, when in bare fallow, between 80 and 90 lb. of\r\nnitrogen are converted into nitrates in some fourteen months' time--an\r\namount equal to about 5 cwt. of nitrate of soda. It is a fact of no\r\nlittle practical significance that nearly one-half of this large\r\nquantity is found in the drainage-water.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amount produced at Different Times of the Year._\r\n\r\nSome indication of the rate at which nitrification takes place during\r\nthe different months of the year is obtained from a study of the results\r\nof the analyses of drainage-waters which we have just referred to. This,\r\nhowever, it must be remembered, only furnishes us with a very\r\napproximate indication. The month showing the greatest amount of\r\nnitrates in the drainage-water must not necessarily be regarded as that\r\nduring which nitrification has been most active, for the amount chiefly\r\ndepends on the rainfall. In illustration of this it will be found that\r\nthe drainage-water during the autumn and early winter months contains\r\nmost nitrates, not because nitrification is most active then, but\r\nbecause the rainfall is greatest, and a large proportion of the nitrates\r\nformed during the drier summer months is being only then washed from the\r\nsoil. The amount of nitrates in drainage-waters steadily diminishes from\r\nautumn through the winter months, and is least in spring. The total\r\namount of nitrates found in the drainage-water is, therefore, not a safe\r\nguide. What, however, does furnish us with a more reliable indication is\r\nthe _percentage_ of nitrates in the drainage-water. Regarding the\r\nresults of the analyses of drainage-water (see Appendix) from this point\r\nof view, it will be seen that this is greatest during the month of\r\nSeptember, and least during April.[122]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nitrification of Manures._\r\n\r\nA subject which has not yet been specially referred to, but which is of\r\ngreat practical importance, is the nitrification of manurial substances.\r\nIt is unfortunate that the amount of research hitherto devoted to this\r\nimportant question has been slight, and that the knowledge we possess is\r\ntherefore very limited.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ammonia Salts most easily Nitrifiable._\r\n\r\nOne fact, however, about which there can be little doubt, is that\r\nnitrogen in the form of ammonia salts is, of all compounds of nitrogen,\r\nthe most easily nitrifiable. Indeed, as we have already indicated, it is\r\nhighly probable that the conversion of the different forms of organic\r\nnitrogen into ammonia is an intermediate stage in the nitrification of\r\nthese bodies. At any rate it seems to be invariably the case that when a\r\nmixture of nitrogen compounds, including ammonia salts, are allowed to\r\nnitrify, the nitrogen in the form of ammonia is the first to become\r\nnitrified.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sulphate of Ammonia most easily Nitrifiable Manure._\r\n\r\nIt follows from this that sulphate of ammonia, the most common of\r\nammoniacal manures, is one of the most speedily nitrified when applied\r\nto the soil. The rate at which the nitrification of this manure takes\r\nplace naturally varies according to the quantity applied, and other\r\ncircumstances, such as the nature of the soil and the weather, &c. That,\r\nunder favourable circumstances, the conversion of ammonia into nitrates\r\nis very rapid, has been shown by a number of experiments. Deherain has\r\nfound that when sulphate of ammonia was mixed with soil at the rate of 2\r\ncwt. per acre, nitrification took place at the rate of 1/100th of its\r\nnitrogen per day.\r\n\r\n_Rate of Nitrification of other Manures._\r\n\r\nOf other nitrogenous manures, guano, it would seem, comes next to\r\nsulphate of ammonia in the rate at which it becomes nitrified in the\r\nsoil; while next to guano stand green manures, dried blood, meat-meal,\r\n&c. As we should expect, such a manure as shoddy is very slowly\r\nnitrified. The rate at which the nitrogen compounds in farmyard manure\r\nbecome nitrified, when incorporated with the soil, vary very much\r\naccording to circumstances. It goes on probably at a greater rate than\r\nthe ordinary nitrification of soil-nitrogen. It is a somewhat striking\r\nfact that the effect of adding nitrate of soda to the soil may be at\r\nfirst to check nitrification. That the addition of common salt, even in\r\nsmall quantities, has this result, is at any rate certain. The presence\r\nof salt to the extent of one-thousandth of the weight of the soil, has a\r\nprejudicial effect.\r\n\r\n_Soils best suited for Nitrification._\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, then, nitrification is effected through the agency of\r\nmicro-organisms, which are present to a greater or less extent in all\r\nsoils. It requires for its favourable development air, warmth, moisture,\r\nabsence of strong light, presence of a salifiable base--viz., carbonate\r\nof lime--the presence of certain mineral food-constituents, such as\r\nphosphates, and a certain amount of alkalinity. It consequently takes\r\nplace to the least extent in barren sandy soils. Soils rich, light, well\r\nventilated, uniformly moist, warm, and chalky, are best suited for its\r\ndevelopment. Other things being equal, it develops better in a\r\nfine-grained soil than in a coarse-grained soil, because, in the case of\r\nthe former, aeration and uniform moistening of the soil are best\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Absence of Nitrification in Forest-soils._\r\n\r\nA point of considerable interest is the practical absence of the process\r\nin forest-soils. The absence, or occurrence in the most minute traces,\r\nof nitrates in forest-soils has been accounted for by the lowness of the\r\nnormal temperature of such soils and their extreme dryness. This latter\r\ncondition is accounted for by the enormous transpiration of water which\r\ntakes place through the trees, especially in summer-time, which is such\r\nas to render the soil almost air-dry. Lastly, it may be accounted for by\r\nthe want of mineral food ingredients.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Important Bearing of Nitrification on Agricultural Practice._\r\n\r\nBefore concluding this chapter, it may be well to draw attention to the\r\nimportant bearing which nitrification has on agricultural practice. The\r\nlight which our present knowledge--imperfect as it is--of this most\r\ninteresting process throws on the theory of the rotation of crops is\r\nvery striking, for it shows how the adoption of a skilful rotation may\r\nbe made to prevent the loss of enormous quantities of the most valuable\r\nof all our soil-constituents,--the one on the presence of which\r\nfertility may be said most to depend--viz., nitrogen.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Desirable to have Soil covered with Vegetation._\r\n\r\nThe constant production of nitrates going on in the soil, the inability\r\nof the soil to retain them, and the consequent risk of their being\r\nremoved in drainage, furnish a strong argument in favour of keeping our\r\nsoils as constantly covered with vegetation as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Permanent Pasture most Economical Condition of Soil._\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of conservation of soil-nitrates, permanent\r\npasture may be said to be the most economical condition for the soil to\r\nbe in. In such a case the nitrates are assimilated as they are formed,\r\nand, by being converted in the plant into organic nitrogen, they are at\r\nonce removed from all risk of loss. A consideration, therefore, of the\r\nprocess of nitrification furnishes many arguments in favour of laying\r\ndown land in permanent pasture--a practice which of late years has been\r\nincreasingly followed in many parts of the country. As, however, it is\r\nnot possible or desirable to carry out this practice beyond certain\r\nlimits, the rotation which most nearly conforms to the condition of\r\nkeeping the soil covered with vegetation, and most approximates in this\r\nrespect to permanent pasture, is most to be recommended.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nitrification and Rotation of Crops._\r\n\r\nThe chief risk of loss of nitrates is in connection with a cereal crop\r\nsuch as wheat. Where turnips follow wheat, there is a period during\r\nwhich the soil is left uncovered, and during which most serious loss of\r\nnitrates is apt to ensue. The risk of loss is enhanced by the fact that\r\nthe assimilation of nitrates by cereals ceases before the season of\r\ntheir maximum production in the soil. The soil is then left bare of\r\nvegetation during the autumn, which is the most critical period of all,\r\nand the result must be serious loss. In order to minimise this loss, the\r\npractice of growing catch-crops has been had recourse to. As, however,\r\nthis practice will be dealt with elsewhere, nothing further need here be\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[97] As the formation of nitrites is a stage in the process, the term\r\n_nitrification_ includes the formation of nitrites as well as nitrates.\r\n\r\n[98] Nitre seems to have been known as early as the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\n[99] Lawes and Gilbert, for example, have shown that in the Rothamsted\r\nsoils it only amounts to a few parts per million of soil.\r\n\r\n[100] See Appendix, Note I., p. 196.\r\n\r\n[101] The artificial production of nitre seems to have been first\r\neffected by Glauber in the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n[102] The lime-rubbish from old buildings, especially those parts which\r\nhave come in contact with the earth, or plastering from the walls of\r\ndamp cellars, barns, stables, &c., have been found to be rich in nitrate\r\nof lime, and, as has been long well known, constitute by themselves a\r\nvaluable manure. The formation of the nitrate of lime can be accounted\r\nfor by the contact of the lime with nitrogenous matter of different\r\nkinds.\r\n\r\n[103] As much of the nitric acid in this solution was present as nitrate\r\nof lime, it was usually treated with a solution of potassium carbonate,\r\nthe result being the precipitation of the lime as carbonate, pure\r\nsaltpetre being left in solution, according to the following equation--\r\n\r\nK_{2}CO_{3} + Ca(NO_{3})_{2} = 2 KNO_{3} + CaCO_{3}.\r\n\r\nUnder the French mode of manufacture, the process was considered to have\r\ndeveloped satisfactorily when 1000 lb. of earth, at the expiration of\r\ntwo years, yielded 5 lb. of nitre.\r\n\r\n[104] Pasteur had already in 1862 expressed the opinion that\r\nnitrification might probably be in some way connected with ferments. A.\r\nMueller (see 'Journal of Chemical Society,' 1879, p. 249) was the first\r\nto advance the opinion that nitrification was due to the action of a\r\nferment. This conclusion he was led to by the observation that while the\r\nammonia in sewage was converted into nitric acid, no change took place\r\nin solutions of ammonia or urine prepared in the laboratory.\r\n\r\n[105] Bisulphide of carbon and phenol (carbolic acid) have also been\r\nexperimented with in connection with their antiseptic action on\r\nnitrification. In these experiments the former had a similar effect to\r\nchloroform; the phenol, however, while hindering it did not entirely\r\nsuspend it, due probably to the difficulty of bringing the phenol vapour\r\ninto thorough contact with the soil-particles.\r\n\r\n[106] Winogradsky has named the nitrous organism _nitrosomonas_, and the\r\nnitric organism _nitrobaeter_.\r\n\r\n[107] From a series of Lectures delivered by him in connection with\r\nLawes Agricultural Trust, in the United States.\r\n\r\n[108] This silica-jelly consists of dialysed silicic acid, ammonium\r\nsulphate, potassium phosphate, magnesium sulphate, calcium chloride, and\r\nmagnesium carbonate.\r\n\r\n[109] This fact is all the more striking when we remember that this\r\ndecomposition of carbonic acid is best effected in the dark, since light\r\nis prejudicial to nitrification.\r\n\r\n[110] See Appendix, Note II., p. 196, and Note III., p. 197.\r\n\r\n[111] See Appendix, Note V., p. 198.\r\n\r\n[112] This is shown by the fact that nitrification will only continue in\r\na solution of carbonate of ammonia till one-half the ammonia is\r\nnitrified. It then stops. The base, with which the nitrous acid combines\r\nas it is formed, being at that stage entirely used up, nitrification is\r\nno longer possible. With regard to urine solutions the same is the case.\r\nNitrification thus will only take place where there is a sufficiency of\r\nbase.\r\n\r\n[113] See Appendix, Note IV., p. 197.\r\n\r\n[114] It would seem that an alkalinity much exceeding four parts of\r\nnitrogen per million is prejudicial to the process.\r\n\r\n[115] According to Warington, solutions containing 50 per cent of urine\r\nbecome nitrifiable when sufficient gypsum is added. The gypsum\r\nneutralises the alkalinity of nitrifying solutions by converting the\r\nalkaline ammonium carbonate into neutral ammonium sulphate, the calcium\r\ncarbonate being precipitated.\r\n\r\n[116] See Chapter on Farmyard Manure.\r\n\r\n[117] As practically illustrating this fact, a solution kept at 10 deg. C.\r\nrequired ten days, while a solution kept at 30 deg. C. required only eight\r\ndays for nitrification.\r\n\r\n[118] In sixty-nine trials no failure to produce nitrification by\r\nseeding with soil from a depth, of 2 feet was experienced. Similarly in\r\neleven trials only one failure took place with soil from a depth of 3\r\nfeet. With clay soil from a depth of 6 feet success took place to the\r\nextent of 50 per cent. No nitrification was obtained with clay from a\r\ndepth of 8 feet. Entire failure was experienced with chalk subsoil. The\r\nprocess thus diminishes in activity the lower down we go.\r\n\r\n[119] Koch has found that in soils he has examined few organisms were\r\nfound at a depth below 3 feet.\r\n\r\n[120] See Appendix, Note VI., p. 198.\r\n\r\n[121] For full analytical results see Appendix, Note VII., p. 198.\r\n\r\n[122] We find the least amount in the month of April. In the water, from\r\na 20-and 60-inch gauge respectively, the amounts were 1.35 lb. and 1.61\r\nlb. per acre (rainfall 2.25 inches). From then on to November the amount\r\nsteadily increases. In the latter month it reaches its maximum--viz.,\r\n6.50 lb. (20-inch gauge) and 5.98 lb. (60-inch gauge) per acre (rainfall\r\n2.30 inches). See Appendix to Chapter III., Note VIII, p. 160.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE I. (p. 162).\r\n\r\nOLD THEORIES OF NITRIFICATION.\r\n\r\nAccording to the old theories, nitrification was regarded as a simple\r\ncase of the oxidation of nitrogen by the oxygen of the air, or by ozone.\r\nThe union of nitrogen and oxygen, however, probably takes place only at\r\nvery high temperatures, such as are formed during electric discharges.\r\nIt is needless to point out that the union of nitrogen and oxygen in\r\nthis way is not likely to occur in soils. According to other theories,\r\nnitrification was effected by means of the oxidation of ammonia.\r\nAmmonia, however, can only be oxidised to nitric acid by means of\r\ncertain powerful oxidising agents, such as ozone or hydrogen peroxide.\r\nAs, however, these substances are not found in the soil, it is much to\r\nbe doubted whether nitric acid is ever formed in the soil in this way.\r\nIt is possible, however, as held by some, that ferric oxide is capable\r\nof inducing this conversion. On the whole, however, most evidence points\r\nto the conclusion that all nitric acid produced in the soil is formed\r\nthrough the agency of micro-organic life.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE II. (p. 170).\r\n\r\nThe important fact that nitrification can take place in solutions\r\npractically devoid of organic matter, was first shown by Dr J. H. M.\r\nMunro ('Chemical Society Journal,' August 1886, p. 561). It was further\r\ncorroborated by Warington and P. F. Frankland. Winogradsky, however,\r\nhas carried out the most conclusive experiments on the subject. \"He\r\nprepared vessels and solutions, carefully purified from organic matter,\r\nand these solutions he sowed with the nitrifying organism. Finding that\r\nunder these conditions the nitrifying organism increased enormously and\r\ndisplayed its full vigour, he proceeded further to determine the amount\r\nof carbonaceous organic matter formed in solutions after the\r\nintroduction of the organism. By making the nitrification intensive, he\r\nwas able to obtain considerable quantities of carbon from the nitrified\r\nsolutions by the process of wet combustion. In his third memoir he\r\npublishes figures which apparently show a close relation between the\r\namount of nitrogen oxidised, and the amount of carbon assimilated; the\r\nratio is about 35:1.\"--See Bulletin of U.S. Department of Agriculture,\r\nNo. 8, containing Lectures on Rothamsted Experiments by R. Warington,\r\nF.R.S., p. 50.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE III. (p. 170).\r\n\r\nThe oxidising power of the micro-organisms of soil is not confined to\r\nthe oxidation of ammonia or of organic matter. Muentz has shown that soil\r\nis capable of oxidising iodides to hypo-iodides and iodates, and\r\nbromides to hypo-bromides and bromates. This is a very important result,\r\nand seems to indicate that nitrification is part of a general oxidising\r\naction, and that we must not assume that nitrites or nitrates are\r\nproduced because they are in themselves of advantage to the organism.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE IV.

The alkalinity of the last-named\r\nsolution when nitrification commenced was equal to 447 mgs. of ammonia\r\nper litre.

The quantity of phosphoric acid absorbed by the plant is also\r\nless than that of nitrogen; and lastly, the different chemical compounds\r\nof phosphoric acid occurring in the soil are not nearly so numerous as\r\nthose of nitrogen. Phosphoric acid, however, must be regarded as ranking\r\nnext to nitrogen in its importance as a soil-constituent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Occurrence of Phosphoric Acid in Nature._\r\n\r\nThat phosphoric acid is of universal occurrence may be assumed from the\r\nfact of the almost universal occurrence of vegetable life on the\r\nearth's surface; for plants are unable to grow without it. While thus of\r\npractically universal occurrence, its amount in most soils is very\r\ntrifling. As the only source of it in the soil is from the\r\ndisintegration of the different rocks, a short description of its\r\noccurrence in the mineral kingdom may first be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mineral Sources of Phosphoric Acid._\r\n\r\nIt was first discovered in the mineral kingdom towards the close of last\r\ncentury; but we have only of late years ascertained any exact knowledge\r\nof its percentage in the different rocks out of which soils are formed.\r\nThis has been shown in many cases to be very trifling. It most\r\nabundantly occurs as _apatite_, a mineral consisting of calcium\r\nphosphate, with small quantities of calcium fluoride or calcium\r\nchloride. This apatite, or phosphorite, is found in certain parts of the\r\nworld in large masses; but as a rule, it only occurs in small quantities\r\nin most rocks. It may be stated that the older rocks are, as a general\r\nrule, richer in it than those of more recent formation; and Daubeny has\r\ndrawn attention to this fact as furnishing a useful guide in estimating\r\nthe probable richness of a soil in phosphoric acid. The older,\r\ntherefore, a rock is, the richer it is likely to be in phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Apatite and Phosphorite._\r\n\r\nOf apatite there are a variety of kinds, which differ in their\r\nappearance as well as in their composition. It occurs chiefly in a\r\ncrystalline form, and is found sometimes in regular crystals, but it\r\nalso occurs in the amorphous form. In colour it may be white, yellow,\r\nbrown, red, green, grey, or blue. Two classes of apatite are found. The\r\nfirst consists of calcium phosphate along with calcium fluoride; and in\r\nother kinds of apatite the calcium fluoride is replaced by calcium\r\nchloride. Phosphorite is another name for apatite, but is chiefly\r\napplied to impure amorphous apatite. The percentage of phosphate of lime\r\nin different kinds of apatite may be stated at from 70 to 90 per cent.\r\nIt occurs in very large quantities in Canada, the Canadian apatite being\r\nvery rich in phosphate of lime--80 to 90 per cent. In many parts of the\r\nworld it forms portions of mountain-masses, and is quarried, crushed,\r\nand used for artificial manurial purposes. Further details of its\r\noccurrence and chemical composition will be found in the Appendix.[123]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coprolites._\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the world round nodules, largely consisting of\r\nphosphate of lime, have been found, to which the name \"coprolites\" has\r\nbeen given, on the assumption that they consisted of fossilised animal\r\nexcrements. These coprolites, or osteolites as they have also been\r\ncalled, vary in the percentage of phosphate of lime they contain.\r\nSometimes this amounts to 80 per cent, but as a rule it is very much\r\nless. They also in the past have formed an important source of manure,\r\nand will be referred to subsequently.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Guano._\r\n\r\nWe have, lastly, phosphoric acid occurring in large quantities in\r\nguano-deposits, chiefly found on the west coast of South America. These\r\ndeposits, which have been of enormous importance as a source of\r\nartificial manure, are of animal origin, and will be discussed at\r\nconsiderable length in a chapter specially devoted to the subject; so\r\nthat we need do no more than mention them here.\r\n\r\nPhosphoric acid is also found in the form of phosphate of lime in\r\ncertain rocks as \"layers\" and \"pockets.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Universal Occurrence in Common Rocks._\r\n\r\nBut while it is thus found in considerable quantities in various parts\r\nof the world, and while no anxiety need thus be felt as to its abundance\r\nfor artificial manurial purposes, its occurrence in the common rocks,\r\nwhich, as we have already pointed out, is practically universal, is in\r\nmany cases very minute.\r\n\r\nFownes first identified it in the felspathic rocks in 1844; and since\r\nthen its percentage in granite, lava, trachyte, basalt, porphyry,\r\ndolomite, gneiss, syenite, dolerite, diorite, and a number of other\r\nrocks, has been determined by numerous investigators. For analyses of\r\nthese rocks the reader is referred to the Appendix.[124]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Occurrence in the Soil._\r\n\r\nThat no soil is actually without phosphoric acid is highly probable, but\r\nin many soils it is present in the merest traces, and even in fertile\r\nsoils it is rarely present in quantities over two-tenths of a per cent;\r\nwhile half that amount may be taken as an average for most fairly\r\nfertile soils. This would be about 3500 lb. per acre, calculating the\r\nsoil to a depth of 9 inches. In exceptional cases it has been found to\r\nthe extent of .3 per cent; and in the famous Russian _black earth_ it\r\nhas been found to amount to .6 per cent.[125] Like nitrogen, it is found\r\nin greatest amount in the surface portion of the soil, but its amount at\r\ndifferent depths does not vary to the same extent as we have found to be\r\nthe case with nitrogen.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Condition in which Phosphoric Acid is present in the Soil._\r\n\r\nUnlike nitrogen, phosphoric acid occurs in the soil almost entirely in\r\nan _insoluble_ form; and when applied to the soil in a soluble form, is\r\nspeedily converted into an insoluble condition. Its most commonly\r\noccurring forms are as phosphates of lime, iron, and alumina. These\r\nfacts are of importance to remember, as they explain why phosphoric acid\r\nis not found in drainage-water in any quantity. It also shows how little\r\nthe risk of loss from drainage is in the application of artificial\r\nphosphatic manure to the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Occurrence in Plants._\r\n\r\nThe percentage of phosphoric acid in plants, like other\r\nash-constituents, is subject to considerable variation, and depends on a\r\nvariety of conditions, such as the state of the plant's development,\r\nnature of soil, climate, season, treatment with manures, &c. All these\r\nconditions have a certain influence. The different parts of the plant\r\nhave been found to contain it in different quantities. The tendency of\r\nphosphoric acid is to travel up to the higher portions of the plant with\r\nthe progress of growth, and to finally accumulate in the seed. As\r\nillustrating this, it may be mentioned that the inner portion of the\r\nstalk of a ripe oat-plant has been found to contain only a seventeenth\r\nof the amount of phosphoric acid found in the same portion of the stalk\r\nof a young oat-plant. Similarly it may be mentioned that, while the ash\r\nof the grain of rye and wheat contains nearly half their weight of\r\nphosphoric acid, the percentage present in the ash of other parts of the\r\nplant amounts only to from 5 to 16 per cent. The percentage of\r\nphosphorus is greater in young plants than in mature plants; it is\r\ngreater also in quickly developed plants than in slowly developed\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nIn the plant, phosphorus is present chiefly in the albuminoids; and its\r\nabsorption from the soil takes place in greatest quantity during the\r\nperiod of maximum growth. In beans and peas an oil containing phosphorus\r\nhas been found.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Occurrence in Animals._\r\n\r\nThat phosphorus in different forms exists in animal tissue is well\r\nknown. It is found both in the brain and in the nerves, as well as in\r\nnearly all the fluids of the animal body. It is, however, in the bones\r\nthat it is most abundant, the mineral portion of which is almost\r\nentirely made of phosphate of lime,--a fact which renders bones such a\r\nvaluable artificial manure. Altogether, phosphoric acid occurs in the\r\nanimal body to the extent of 2.3 per cent. There is a point which we\r\nshall have occasion to draw the student's attention to further on in\r\ndiscussing the nature of farmyard manure--and that is, that the urine of\r\nthe common farm animals is practically devoid of phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sources of Loss of Phosphoric Acid in Agriculture._\r\n\r\nAs we have already done in the case of nitrogen, we may now attempt to\r\nform some conception of the sources of loss and gain of phosphoric acid\r\nin the soil. The sources of loss may be divided into natural and\r\nartificial. Of natural sources of loss we have only one, and that is\r\nloss by drainage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Loss of Phosphoric Acid by Drainage._\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that the condition in which phosphoric acid is\r\npresent in the soil is as insoluble phosphate. In drainage-water it\r\noccurs in mere traces. Minute though the amount seems when stated as\r\npercentage, and small as it appears beside the loss (from the same\r\nsource) of nitrogen, it is yet, if considered for large areas,\r\nsufficiently striking. Thus it has been estimated that in the river Elbe\r\nthere is carried off by drainage from the fields of Bohemia 2-3/4\r\nmillion pounds (1200 tons) of phosphoric acid annually. This, it is\r\ntrue, is a very trifling amount compared with the annual loss of\r\nnitrogen from an equal area; but then it must be remembered, on the\r\nother hand, the sources of gain to the soil of this ingredient are not\r\nso numerous as are those of nitrogen, the only sources of phosphoric\r\nacid being in the manure applied to the soil, and that coming from the\r\ngradual disintegration of phosphatic minerals.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Artificial Sources of Loss._\r\n\r\nThe other sources of loss may be classed under the term artificial, and\r\nare connected with agricultural practice. Just as we have seen that in\r\nthe case of nitrogen enormous quantities of that substance are\r\nconstantly being removed from the soil in those crops which are\r\nconsumed off the farm, so, too, enormous quantities of phosphoric acid\r\nare being removed in the same way. As illustrating this fact, it may be\r\nmentioned that Professor Grandeau has recently estimated that in the\r\nentire crops grown in France in one year there are about 298,200 tons of\r\nphosphoric acid; while the amount returned in the dung of farm animals\r\nis only 157,200, or only about one-half of what is removed in the crops,\r\nleaving a deficit of 147,000 tons to be made good by the addition of\r\nartificial phosphatic manures, if the fertility of the soil is to be\r\nmaintained. The same authority has calculated that in the bones of the\r\nentire farm animals in France there is no less a quantity than 76,820\r\ntons of phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nAs an example of how, in many cases, the amount of phosphoric acid\r\nremoved from the farm is very often much greater than that restored, a\r\ncase quoted by Crusius may be cited. This was a farm of 670 acres\r\n(Saxon) which had received only farmyard manure, and from which, during\r\nsixteen years, 985.67 cwt. of phosphoric acid had been sold off in the\r\ncrops; while only 408.33 cwt. had been restored in the manure, leaving a\r\nloss of 577.34 cwt.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Phosphoric Acid removed in Milk._\r\n\r\nA further source of loss is the phosphoric acid removed in milk. In the\r\ntotal annual yield of milk from one cow there may be from 11 to 12 lb.\r\nof phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Loss in Treatment of Farmyard Manure._\r\n\r\nThe risks of loss of phosphoric acid in the treatment of farmyard manure\r\nare not so great as in the case of nitrogen. There is, however, a\r\nconsiderable risk, through want of proper precautions, of the soluble\r\nphosphates being washed away by rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Loss in Sewage._\r\n\r\nThe loss of phosphoric acid incurred by the present method of sewage\r\ndisposal is not so large as the loss of nitrogen, inasmuch as the\r\nquantity of phosphoric acid contained in human excreta is very much\r\nless. Roughly speaking, it may be said to amount to a little less than\r\none-third of the nitrogen lost in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sources of Artificial Gain of Phosphoric Acid._\r\n\r\nTo balance these losses, we have a practically unlimited supply of\r\nmineral phosphates for application as artificial manure, as well as\r\nlarge quantities of other manures, many of them already mentioned in\r\nconnection with nitrogen, such as bones and guanos of all kinds. Quite\r\nrecently, also, a large source of phosphoric acid has been opened up in\r\nthe basic slag, a rich phosphatic bye-product obtained in considerable\r\nquantity in steel-works from the basic process of steel manufacture. We\r\nhave also large quantities of phosphoric acid in the imported\r\nfeeding-stuffs, for statistics regarding which we would refer our\r\nreaders to a previous chapter. The question of the actual amount\r\ncontained in these sources is not of the same interest as in the case of\r\nnitrogen, and need not therefore detain us. We have sufficiently\r\nindicated the importance of phosphoric acid in agriculture by the\r\nstatements above given. All further consideration of phosphoric acid\r\nmust therefore be deferred to future chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[123] See Appendix, Note I., p. 210.\r\n\r\n[124] See Appendix, Note II., p. 211.\r\n\r\n[125] These results, as indeed all soil percentages, are calculated on\r\nthe soil in a dry condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE I.

On this account straw contains a much greater\r\nproportion of potash than phosphoric acid, and hence farmyard manure may\r\nbe regarded as fairly rich in potash.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Occurrence of Potash._\r\n\r\nOf all sources of potash the ocean must be regarded as the chief.\r\nMillions and millions of tons are present in a state of solution in the\r\nsalt water of the ocean.[126] Like phosphoric acid, its occurrence in\r\nthe rocks forming the earth's crust may be said to be practically\r\nuniversal. Many of the commonly occurring rocks and minerals are\r\nextremely rich in it, and by their disintegration furnish large\r\nquantities to the soil. Some of these rocks contain it in such abundance\r\nthat they have been tried as potash manures; and were other more\r\nvaluable sources less available than they actually are, such a practice\r\nmight well be recommended. A volcanic rock known as _palagonite_, and\r\nthat most commonly occurring of all potash minerals--viz., felspar--have\r\nboth been experimented with in this way with considerable success.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Felspar and other Potash Minerals._\r\n\r\nThat felspar should prove, when finally ground, a valuable source of\r\npotash, is not to be wondered at when we remember that some varieties of\r\nit contain over 16 per cent. It has been calculated that a single cubic\r\nfoot of this mineral is sufficient to supply an oak-wood, covering a\r\nsurface of 26,910 square feet, with potash for a period of no less than\r\nfive years.[127] Some idea of the enormous _potential_ fertility of a\r\nsoil containing felspar, so far as potash is concerned, may be obtained\r\nfrom this statement. It must be remembered, however, that it is only the\r\northoclase or potash felspars which contain large quantities of\r\npotash--other felspathic rocks, such as oligoclase and labradorite,\r\nbeing comparatively poor in it. Another commonly occurring mineral which\r\nis rich in potash is mica, which has been found to contain from 5 to 13\r\nper cent. From this it follows that rocks which have large amounts of\r\nthese minerals in their composition--such as granite, for example, which\r\noften contains 5 or 6 per cent of potash--form by their disintegration\r\nsoils rich in this ingredient.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stassfurt Salts._\r\n\r\nBut in addition to the sources of potash already mentioned, it exists in\r\nother forms in the earth's surface. Till within recent years it was\r\nobtained for commercial purposes from the ashes of plants, which, as we\r\nshall immediately see, are extremely rich in this ingredient; from salt\r\nwater--this source giving rise to the so-called \"salt gardens\" on the\r\ncoast of France; and from nitre soils in different parts of India,\r\nreferred to already at considerable length. Large mineral deposits,\r\nhowever, have been recently discovered in the neighbourhood of Stassfurt\r\nin Germany, and have since their discovery supplied all the potash\r\nrequired for manurial and other purposes. In these deposits (similar\r\nones have also been found at Kalusz in the Carpathian Mountains) there\r\nare no less than five different minerals which contain potash. The form\r\nin which it is present is as sulphate or chloride, so that it is readily\r\navailable for plants, and is of altogether very much greater value than\r\nthe form in which it occurs in the minerals already mentioned--viz., as\r\nan insoluble silicate. Of the Stassfurt potash salts, the best known as\r\na manure is _kainit_, which contains about 32 per cent of sulphate of\r\npotash. A list of the other potash minerals, with the particulars of\r\ntheir composition and the percentage of potash they contain, will be\r\nfound in the Appendix.[128]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Occurrence of Saltpetre._\r\n\r\nWe have already had occasion, in Chapter IV., when discussing the\r\nquestion of nitrification, to refer to the occurrence of nitrate of\r\npotash in certain soils in India, which have formed a large source of\r\nsaltpetre used in commerce in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Occurrence of Potash in the Soil._\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said regarding the richness in potash of certain\r\ncommonly occurring minerals, such as felspar, it is only natural to\r\ninfer that most soils must contain large quantities of this substance;\r\nand this is so. The wonder is that potash, when applied as an artificial\r\nmanure, should have such a marked effect in increasing the fertility of\r\nthe soil, as is often the case. We must remember, however, that although\r\na soil may contain large quantities of potash, there may be a very small\r\npercentage of the whole in an available form for the plant's needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Potash chiefly in insoluble Condition in Soils._\r\n\r\nPotash occurs almost entirely in soils in a very insoluble form--viz.,\r\ncombined with silica as a silicate of potash. It is only by the slow\r\ndisintegration of potash rocks that the potash they contain is set free\r\nfor plant uses. When it is applied as an artificial manure, on the other\r\nhand, it is in a soluble form. In most soils the amount soluble in water\r\nprobably lies between .001 and .009 per cent; that soluble in dilute\r\nacid solutions from .1 to .5 per cent; and that insoluble from .2 to 3.5\r\nper cent of the soil. It is highly probable that a certain quantity of\r\npotash in the soil may exist in combination with humic and ulmic acids,\r\nforming insoluble potassium humates and ulmates.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Potash in Plants._\r\n\r\nOf all the ash ingredients of plants, potash is the most abundant, as it\r\nforms on an average about 50 per cent of the total ash of plants--about\r\n90 per cent of the alkalies. The ash of plants, indeed, was for long\r\nthe chief source of potash. Certain plants remove very large quantities\r\nfrom the soil. Of these roots, potatoes, the vine, the tobacco-plant,\r\nand hops may be mentioned as examples. It is present in large quantities\r\nin the grain of cereals, although, as we have already pointed out, not\r\nto the same proportional extent as phosphoric acid. It is found in the\r\nplant's extremities, such as twigs and new leaves, in greatest\r\nabundance.[129]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Potash in the Animal Tissue._\r\n\r\nIt is also found in all parts of the animal body. Especially rich in\r\npotash salts are the blood corpuscles, which contain about ten times the\r\namount contained in the serum. It is found in especial abundance in the\r\nfleece of sheep, which may contain more potash than that in the whole\r\nbody of the sheep. Animal urine also contains potash in considerable\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sources of Loss of Potash._\r\n\r\nThe capacity of the soil to retain soluble potash compounds, while not\r\nequal to its capacity for retaining phosphoric acid, is yet very much in\r\nexcess of its capacity for retaining nitrates. The result is, that\r\npotash is only found in comparatively minute traces in drainage\r\nwater.[130] Taking the same example as we already cited in illustration\r\nof the loss of phosphoric acid, we find that the amount carried away in\r\nthe course of a year in the waters of the Elbe from Bohemia is\r\n97,000,000 lb. (43,300 tons).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Potash removed in Crops._\r\n\r\nThe amount of potash removed by the different crops from the soil will\r\nbe considered in a subsequent chapter. We need only say here that the\r\nclass of crops which remove the largest quantity are the root crops,\r\nespecially mangels. The loss is least in the case of the cereals. The\r\namount of potash contained in the straw of cereals is about three times\r\nthe amount of that removed in the grain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Potash removed in Milk._\r\n\r\nLastly, we may refer to the potash removed in milk, which, on an\r\naverage, may be taken at 10 lb. per annum for each cow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Potash Manures._\r\n\r\nOf potash manures the chief are the sulphate and the chloride, or, as it\r\nis commercially known, the \"muriate.\" The chief source of potash manures\r\nare the Stassfurt deposits already referred to. Wood-ashes have also\r\nbeen used in large quantities in the past (chiefly as a potash manure),\r\nand in some parts of the world are still used. A considerable source of\r\nartificial potassic manures is the refuse manufacture of sugar-beet,\r\nsuch a large industry in Germany.

It has stood the test of long experience, and\r\nhas proved its position as one of the most important of all our\r\nfertilisers. It is highly desirable, therefore, to make a somewhat\r\ndetailed examination of its composition, and to see on what the\r\nvariation in this depends; and, finally, to examine into the mode of its\r\naction as a manure.\r\n\r\nThat it should prove a valuable manure is scarcely to be wondered at, as\r\nit is originally formed from vegetable substance, and as it therefore\r\ncontains all the elements present in the plant itself.\r\n\r\nIts composition is very variable, and probably no two samples would\r\nyield exactly similar analyses. In this fact lies one of the chief\r\ndifficulties of the treatment of the subject, and all statements made\r\nin the following pages as to its chemical composition must be taken as\r\nonly _approximate_.\r\n\r\nWe may divide its constituents into three classes.\r\n\r\n1. That portion due to _solid excreta_.\r\n\r\n2. The liquid portion, largely made up of dilute _urine_.\r\n\r\n3. The _straw_, or other material, which is used as litter.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the manure will vary according to the proportion in\r\nwhich these three substances are present, as well as according to the\r\ncomposition of the substances themselves. It will consequently tend to a\r\nclearer apprehension of the subject if we first examine briefly the\r\nchemical composition of the solid excreta and urine of the farm animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Solid Excreta._\r\n\r\nThe manurial value of the solid excreta of animals--_i.e._, the\r\nproportion they contain of _nitrogen_, _phosphoric acid_, and\r\n_potash_--depends on a variety of conditions.\r\n\r\nThe solid excreta of horses, sheep, cows, and pigs, are well known to\r\npossess different properties, as well as to vary in their composition.\r\n\r\nWhat, however, has a still greater influence is the nature of the food.\r\nThis is owing to the fact that the solid excreta are made up of\r\nundigested food. We can scarcely expect the same quality of solid\r\nexcreta from an animal fed on poor diet as from an animal fed on very\r\nmuch richer diet. Again, the percentage of the food voided in the solid\r\nexcreta varies in the case of different animals.[131]\r\n\r\nAnother consideration which enters into the question is the age, as well\r\nas the treatment, of the animal. A young animal, during the period of\r\nits growth, absorbs from its food into its system a larger quantity of\r\nthe three fertilising substances, nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash,\r\nthan is the case with an adult animal whose weight is neither increasing\r\nnor diminishing. A working horse, similarly, will return more of the\r\nnitrogen, phosphates, and potash in its dung than one not at work and\r\nwhich is permitted to gain in weight. The nature of the composition of\r\nthe solid excreta, therefore, will depend on the nature of the _food_,\r\n_age_, _breed_, _condition_, and _treatment_ of the animal.\r\n\r\nLet us now investigate shortly the influence of the above\r\nconsiderations. The solid excrements of the common farm animals are\r\ngenerally distinguished from one another according to the rate at which\r\nthey decompose or ferment on keeping. Thus horse-dung is generally known\r\nas a \"hot\" dung; while cow-dung, on the other hand, is known as \"cool.\"\r\nWhy this should be so is not absolutely clear. Probably it is owing to\r\nthe fact that the former contains less water, as well as to the fact\r\n(and this probably has more to do with it) that it contains a larger\r\npercentage of fertilising matter, especially nitrogen, thus affording\r\nconditions more favourable for rapid fermentation than in the case of\r\nthe more moist and less rich cow-dung.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the solid excreta of various animals, as we have just\r\nsaid, varies with the nature of their food; so that it is impossible to\r\ntake any analyses as absolutely representing its composition. It may be\r\ninteresting, however, to compare the analyses of samples of horse-dung\r\nwith those of some other of the commoner farm animals, with a view to\r\nobtaining an _approximate_ idea of this difference.\r\n\r\nStoeckhardt has found that in 1000 lb. of the fresh solid excreta of the\r\nanimals below mentioned, there were the following amounts of _nitrogen_,\r\n_phosphoric acid_, and _alkalies_:--\r\n\r\n-----------------------+----------+-------------+-------------+-----------\r\n                       |          |             | PHOSPHORIC  |\r\n                       |          |  NITROGEN.  |   ACID.     | ALKALIES.\r\n                       |  WATER.  |-----+-------+-----+-------+---+-------\r\n                       |          |     |Reduced|     |Reduced|   |Reduced\r\n                       |          |     |  to   |     |  to   |   |  to\r\n-----------------------+----+-----+-----+-------+-----+-------+---+-------\r\n                       |lb. | per | lb. |  per  | lb. |  per  |lb.|  per\r\n                       |    |cent.|     | cent. |     | cent. |   | cent.\r\nHorses (winter food)   |760 |76   |5    |  .50  |3-1/2|  .35  | 3 |  .30\r\nCows (winter food)     |840 |84   |3    |  .30  |2-1/2|  .25  | 1 |  .10\r\nSwine (winter food)    |800 |80   |6    |  .60  |4-1/2|  .45  | 5 |  .50\r\nSheep (2 lb. hay per   |    |     |     |       |     |       |   |\r\n  diem)                |580 |58   |7-1/2|  .75  |6    |  .6   | 3 |  .30\r\n-----------------------+----+-----+-----+-------+-----+-------+---+-------\r\n\r\nFrom the above table it will be seen that the sheep's dung contains the\r\nleast percentage of _water_, and is richer in _nitrogen_ and _phosphoric\r\nacid_ than any of the other three. The percentage of alkalies, of which\r\nthe most important is potash, is, however, not so large. This may be\r\naccounted for by the interesting and well-known fact that a large\r\npercentage of potash is to be found in the wool of sheep.[132]\r\n\r\nThe solid excrement of the sheep is, therefore, weight for weight, the\r\nmost valuable as a manure, as it contains more nitrogen and phosphates\r\nthan the others, and at the same time is much drier.\r\n\r\nIf, however, we compare the composition of the solid excreta in a dry\r\nstate, we shall find that the following are the results (basing our\r\ncalculation on Stoeckhardt's analyses):--\r\n\r\n          Nitrogen,   Phosphoric acid,   Alkalies,\r\n          per cent.      per cent.       per cent.\r\n\r\nHorse       2.08           1.45            1.25\r\nCow         1.87           1.56            0.62\r\nPig         3.00           2.25            2.50\r\nSheep       1.78           1.42            0.71\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the above that the dry substance of the solid\r\nexcreta of the pig is richest in fertilising substances. Too much\r\nstress, however, as has already been pointed out, must not be put on any\r\nsingle analysis, as so much depends on various conditions, especially\r\nthe food.[133] The most reliable method of studying this question,\r\ntherefore, is to study it in its relation to the food consumed. Wolff\r\nhas calculated from numerous investigations that, with regard to the\r\namount of solid excreta produced by the food, the following percentage\r\nof _organic matter_, _nitrogen_, and _mineral substances_, originally\r\npresent in the dry matter of the food, is voided in the dung:--\r\n\r\n                     Cow.    Ox.   Sheep.   Horse.  Average.\r\n\r\nOrganic matter       39.5   42.5    44.0     44.1     42.5\r\nNitrogen             47.5   33.9    46.7     32.4     40.1\r\nMineral substances   53.9   64.6    57.9     62.5     59.7\r\n\r\nThere is one fact to be borne in mind in estimating the manurial value\r\nof the dung of different animals--viz., that the quantity of dung voided\r\nby one animal is much greater than that voided by another. Thus the\r\namount voided by the cow, for example, is much greater than that voided\r\nby the horse; so that, in this way, the inferior quality of the former\r\nis, to some extent, compensated for by its greater quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Urine._\r\n\r\nThe solid excreta possess, however, very much less manurial value than\r\nthe urine. The former, as already stated, are undigested\r\nfood-substances: any fertilising matters which they contain are such as\r\nhave failed to be digested or absorbed into the animal system. The\r\nurine, on the other hand, contains those fertilising substances which\r\nhave been digested.\r\n\r\nThe amount of nitrogen and mineral matter, however, in the urine, does\r\nnot represent necessarily the total amount of these substances. Thus, in\r\nthe case of a growing or fattening animal, there is always a certain\r\namount of these substances being absorbed to build up the animal tissue\r\nand put on flesh.\r\n\r\nIn this respect it will be seen that the composition of urine will vary\r\nin the same way as that of the dung. In the case of the urine, however,\r\nthere is a compensating influence to be taken into account. Urine is a\r\nwaste product, and there is more waste in a young than in an adult\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nAnother very important condition which determines the composition of\r\nurine is the nature of the food, especially the quantity of water drunk.\r\nThis, of course, is obvious: the more water drunk, the poorer must the\r\ncomposition of the urine be. But here again, as in the case of the dung,\r\nthis is largely compensated for by the total quantity voided--the more\r\ndilute the urine, the larger will its quantity be; so that the inferior\r\nquality is in this way made up for by its increased quantity.\r\n\r\nKeeping in mind, then, the fact we have just stated--viz., that the\r\ncomposition of urine will vary according to different conditions--we may\r\nobtain an approximate idea of what its composition is from the following\r\nresults of analyses by Stoeckhardt. In 1000 parts the following\r\nquantities of _water_, _nitrogen_, _phosphoric acid_, and _alkalies_\r\nwere found to be present.\r\n\r\nFrom the following table it will be seen that the urine of swine\r\n(containing 97 per cent of water) is much poorer in nitrogen and\r\nalkalies than is the case with the urine of the sheep, horse, or\r\ncow.[134] While this is the case, the amount of phosphoric acid it\r\ncontains is greater than that contained in the sheep's urine.\r\n\r\n-------------------+------------+-------------------------+------------\r\n                   |            |            | Phosphoric |\r\n                   |   Water.   |  Nitrogen. |    Acid.   |  Alkalies.\r\n                   +------+-----+------+-----+------+-----+------+-----\r\n                   | Per  | Per | Per  | Per | Per  | Per | Per  | Per\r\n                   | 1000 |cent.| 1000 |cent.| 1000 |cent.| 1000 |cent.\r\n                   |parts.|     |parts.|     |parts.|     |parts.|\r\n-------------------+------+-----+------+-----+------+-----+------+-----\r\nSheep (2 lb. hay  }| 865  | 86.5|  14  | 1.4 |  .5  | .050|  20  | 2.0\r\n  per diem)       }|      |     |      |     |      |     |      |\r\n                   |      |     |      |     |      |     |      |\r\nSwine (winter food)| 975  | 97.5|   3  |  .3 | 1.25 | .125|   2  |  .2\r\n                   |      |     |      |     |      |     |      |\r\nHorses (hay and   }| 890  | 89.0|  12  | 1.2 |   -  |  -  |  15  | 1.5\r\n  oats)           }|      |     |      |     |      |     |      |\r\n                   |      |     |      |     |      |     |      |\r\nCows (hay and     }| 920  | 92.0|   8  |  .8 |   -  |  -  |  14  | 1.4\r\n  potatoes)       }|      |     |      |     |      |     |      |\r\n-------------------+------+-----+------+-----+------+-----+------+-----\r\n\r\nPhosphoric acid is present in the urine of the farm animals in the most\r\nminute traces: practically, it may be considered to be wanting in the\r\nurine of the horse and the cow, and is present only in small quantities\r\nin sheep's urine. The pig's urine, indeed, contains it in larger\r\nquantities; but the percentage is still so small as to justify the\r\nstatement that the urine of the common farm animals is not a complete\r\nmanure, and must be supplemented by phosphates, if it is to be used\r\nalone. The incomplete nature of urine as a manure constitutes a strong\r\nargument in favour of its being applied along with the solid excreta,\r\nwhich contain, as we have seen, considerable quantities of phosphoric\r\nacid. It is on this account that the drainings of rotten manure-heaps\r\nare more valuable, from a manurial point of view, than urine itself,\r\nsince these contain the soluble portion of the phosphates in the solid\r\nexcreta.[135] The urine of all animals, however, is not equally poor in\r\nphosphates. In the case of flesh-eating animals, such as the dog, the\r\nurine is found to contain them in considerable quantities.\r\n\r\nThe above tables show that the most valuable urine, weight for weight,\r\nis that of the sheep, as it contains the largest amount of alkalies\r\n(including potash) and nitrogen; that the urine of the horse comes next;\r\nthen that of the cow; while, as has already been pointed out, that of\r\nthe pig is the poorest.\r\n\r\nIn order to make our survey of the composition of urine uniform with\r\nthat of the dung, let us see how the urine of the common farm animals\r\ncompares in the matter of the composition of its dry substance. The\r\nfollowing results (basing our calculations on Stoeckhardt's figures,\r\npreviously given) show this:--\r\n\r\n          Nitrogen,    Phosphoric acid,    Alkalies,\r\n          per cent.        per cent.       per cent.\r\n\r\nPig         12.0               5              8\r\nHorse       10.9             trace           13.6\r\nSheep       10.4              3.7            14.9\r\nCow         10.0             trace           17.5\r\n\r\nFrom these figures we see that the dry substance of the urine of the pig\r\nis richest in nitrogen and phosphoric acid, but poorest in alkalies, of\r\nthe four common farm animals; that of the horse comes next in the amount\r\nof nitrogen it contains, but that, on the whole, there is very little\r\ndifference between the horse, cow, and sheep in this respect.[136]\r\n\r\nAs in the case of the dung, this subject is best studied in relation to\r\nthe food consumed. We are again indebted to Wolff's investigations for\r\nvaluable information on this point. He has found that the following\r\npercentages of _organic matter_, _nitrogen_, and _mineral substances_,\r\noriginally present in the dry matter of the food, are voided in the\r\nurine:--\r\n\r\n                      Cow.     Ox.   Sheep.  Horse.  Average\r\n\r\nOrganic matter         4.0     4.4     2.0     3.3     3.4\r\nNitrogen              31.0    54.8    42.3    60.7    47.2\r\nMineral substances    43.1    34.3    41.0    37.5    39.0[137]\r\n\r\nWe have now considered briefly the composition of the solid excrements\r\nand urine of the common farm animals, and have also enumerated some of\r\nthe principal causes of the variation in their composition.\r\n\r\nThe solid excreta consist, as we have seen, of _undigested_ food, while\r\nthe urine contains the manurial ingredients of the food which have been\r\n_digested_ by the animal system.[138] The latter is, weight for weight,\r\nas a rule, very much more valuable as a manure than the former. From\r\nthe table given in the Appendix[139] it will be seen that the\r\nproportions of the nitrogen and ash-constituents originally present in\r\nthe food consumed, which are voided in the excrements, vary with\r\ndifferent circumstances. Wolff, in summarising his results, points out\r\nthat, as a rule, the solid and liquid excrements will contain about 46\r\nper cent of the organic matter, 87.3 of the nitrogen, and 98.7 of\r\nmineral matter; while the experiments of Lawes and Gilbert at Rothamsted\r\nshow that, with fattening oxen and sheep and with horses, more than 95\r\nper cent of the nitrogen and 96 per cent or more of the ash-constituents\r\nare voided in the manure. The pig retains a larger proportion of the\r\nnitrogen--about 85 per cent appearing in the manure--while in the\r\nmilking-cow only about 75 per cent is returned in the excrements.\r\nGenerally speaking, we may say that the nitrogen originally present in\r\nthe food suffers very little loss in passing through the animal system,\r\nand that, practically speaking, the ash-constituents suffer no loss\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nAs to the distribution of the manurial ingredients, much will depend on\r\nthe nature of the food. Almost invariably more than a _half_ of the\r\ntotal nitrogen excreted will be found in the urine, in many cases very\r\nmuch more.[140] Of the mineral constituents, about a third on the\r\naverage may be said to be excreted in the urine. Of this mineral matter\r\nit may be noted that nearly all the alkalies (potash and soda), or about\r\n98 per cent, are found in the urine. Of phosphoric acid and lime, on the\r\nother hand, there are the merest traces in the urine. Horse-urine,\r\nhowever, is an exception with regard to lime, as it contains about 60\r\nper cent of the lime consumed in the food. For information on the\r\nsubject of pig-manure the reader is referred to Appendix, Note V.[141]\r\n\r\nBefore passing from this part of the subject, it may be desirable to\r\nplace before our readers the composition of the dung and urine taken\r\ntogether, so that we may be able to form some idea of their relative\r\nvalue, weight for weight. As the nitrogen constitutes by far the most\r\nvaluable portion of the manurial ingredients, it will be sufficient if\r\nwe compare them as to their percentage of this ingredient.\r\n\r\n           Water,    Nitrogen,   Calculated on\r\n         per cent.   per cent.   dry substance,   Analyses by\r\n                                  per cent.\r\nSheep       67          .91           2.7         Juergensen.\r\nHorse       76          .65           2.7         Boussingault.\r\nPig         82          .61           3.4         Boussingault.\r\nCow         86          .36           2.6         Boussingault.\r\n\r\nFrom these figures we see that, in their natural condition, the excreta\r\nof the sheep are the most valuable; those of the horse and pig coming\r\nnext; while those of the cow are the poorest, containing one-third as\r\nmuch nitrogen as those of the sheep, and one-half as much as those of\r\nthe horse and pig. This difference, however, is due almost entirely to\r\nthe different percentage of water the excreta of the various animals\r\ncontain in their natural state; for in the dry state they are seen to\r\ncontain, with the single exception of the pig, practically the same\r\namount.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, then, the important points to be noticed are--\r\n\r\n1. That in the passage of the food through the system of the common farm\r\nanimals, only a very small percentage of the fertilising substances,\r\nnitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash, is assimilated and retained in\r\nthe animal body; and that, therefore, theoretically at least, the\r\nexcreta should contain nearly the same amount of fertilising matter as\r\nthe food originally did.\r\n\r\n2. That even in the case of a fattening animal, the loss of fertilising\r\nmatter sustained by the food in passing through the system is not great.\r\n\r\n3. That with regard to the total amount of solid excreta and urine\r\nvoided, the latter contains, as a rule, more nitrogen than the former;\r\nthe nitrogen in the urine, further, being more valuable, as it is in a\r\nsoluble condition.\r\n\r\n4. That as regards the distribution of the ash-constituents, _lime_,\r\n_phosphoric acid_, and _magnesia_ are almost entirely found in the solid\r\nexcrements; while the urine contains nearly all the _potash_.\r\n\r\n5. That the best results can be expected only when the liquid and solid\r\nexcreta are used together as a manure.\r\n\r\nAs the composition of the manure depends so largely on the nature of the\r\nfood, a table will be found in the Appendix, Note VI.,[142] containing\r\nthe manurial composition of some of the commoner feeding-stuffs.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Litter._\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider the third constituent of farmyard manure--viz.,\r\nthe _litter_, which generally consists of straw.\r\n\r\nThe uses of the litter, in addition to providing a dry and comfortable\r\nbed for the animal, may be briefly summed up as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. To absorb and retain the liquid portion of the excreta.\r\n\r\n2. To increase the quantity of the manure, and thus secure its more\r\nequal distribution when applied to the field than could otherwise be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n3. To add to its value as a manure, both physically and chemically.\r\n\r\n4. To retard and regulate the decomposition of the excreta.\r\n\r\nOf course litter also performs a very useful function sanitarily,\r\ninasmuch as it serves to keep the stall or byre fresher and cleaner, and\r\nmore free from noxious gases, which it absorbs, than would otherwise be\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\n_Straw_ is almost universally used for this purpose. Besides being one\r\nof the bye-products of the farm, it is admirably suited in many ways,\r\nboth owing to its peculiar shape--its tubular structure being\r\nexcellently adapted for this purpose--as well as on account of its\r\ncomposition, being largely composed of cellulose, a very absorptive\r\nsubstance. Straw thus possesses considerable absorptive power. In\r\nmanurial ingredients it is not very rich; for, of the various parts of\r\nthe ripened plant, straw contains the least percentage of nitrogen and\r\nphosphates. This is due to the fact that, as the straw ripens, a\r\nconsiderable proportion of these ingredients passes up from the stalk to\r\nthe seeds, where they are retained.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, straw may be said to contain not more than _a half\r\nper cent_ of nitrogen--_i.e._, 11.2 lb. per ton. Its percentage of\r\nnitrogen varies, of course; the recorded analyses[143] for wheat-straw\r\nranging from .22 to .81 per cent, or furnishing an average of .48 per\r\ncent--_i.e._, 10.75 lb. per ton. Barley-straw is somewhat richer in\r\nnitrogen, the recorded analyses ranging from .41 to .85 per cent, or\r\ngiving an average of .57 per cent--_i.e._, 12.76 lb. per ton; while\r\noat-straw is the richest of the commoner straws, ranging from .32 to\r\n1.12 per cent, an average of .72 per cent--_i.e._, 16.12 lb per ton.\r\n\r\nOf mineral matter, however, straw contains a very much larger\r\npercentage, proportionally, than of nitrogen; for, with the exception of\r\nphosphates, there is a considerable quantity of inorganic fertilising\r\nmatter, in the shape of potash, lime, &c., present in\r\n\r\n               Composition of Straw.[144]\r\n-----------------+---------------+------------------------+--------\r\n                 |     Ash.      |  Composition of Ash.   |\r\n                 +------+--------+------------------------+\r\n                 |      |        |       Lb. per ton.     |\r\n                 |      |  Lb.   |-------+----------+-----| Number\r\n                 |  Per |  per   |Potash.|Phosphoric|Lime.|   of\r\n                 | cent.|  ton.  |       |   Acid   |     |Analyses\r\n-----------------+------+--------+-------+----------+-----+--------\r\nWheat (winter)   | 5.54 | 124.09 | 18.61 |   5.05   | 7.18|   8\r\nWheat (summer)   | 5.14 | 115.13 | 25.76 |   6.47   | 7.12|   6\r\nRye (winter)     | 5.33 | 119.39 | 20.61 |   5.89   | 9.73|   8\r\nRye (summer)     | 6.14 | 137.53 | 42.41 |   6.73   |10.53|   1\r\nBarley           | 4.90 | 109.76 | 26.83 |   5.75   | 8.73|   8\r\nOats             | 5.09 | 114.01 | 26.22 |   4.17   | 9.12|   4\r\n-----------------+------+--------+-------+----------+-----+--------\r\n\r\nit. Of total ash ingredients, on an average, there are generally about 5\r\nper cent--or 112 lb. per ton. The largest percentage of the fertilising\r\nmatter in this 5 per cent is potash, which varies in the ashes of the\r\nstraws of the commoner crops from 30 to 15 per cent. The above table\r\nwill show the variation in composition of the straws of some of the\r\ncommoner farm crops, and may be valuable for purposes of reference. The\r\ncrops are wheat (winter and summer), barley, oats, and rye (winter and\r\nsummer), and the amount is also calculated in lb. per ton. The results\r\nrepresent the average of a number of analyses.[145] From the table it\r\nwill be seen that the percentage of phosphates is, as has already been\r\nnoticed, very small.\r\n\r\nBut while straw is well adapted for the purposes for which litter is\r\nused, it is not the only substance. Its almost exclusive use as litter\r\nis largely owing to the fact that it is a bye-product of the farm.\r\n\r\n_Loam as Litter._--Generally speaking, any substance which has great\r\nabsorptive as well as retentive powers for nitrogen and the soluble\r\nfertilising matters present in farmyard manure, and whose price is\r\nnominal, is well suited for acting as litter. Ordinary loamy soil\r\npossesses the above qualifications, and is, besides, a substance to be\r\nhad for nothing, and, under certain circumstances and in certain\r\ncountries, is actually used for this purpose, often along with straw. A\r\ngreat objection against loam, however, is that it forms a dirty litter.\r\nMoreover, it possesses a very small percentage of fertilising matter.\r\nThe tendency, consequently, in using ordinary loam, would be to dilute\r\nthe manure too much, besides retarding fermentation to an undesirable\r\nextent. Except, therefore, under very exceptional circumstances, loam is\r\nnot to be regarded as a good litter.\r\n\r\n_Peat as Litter._--Some kinds of soil, however, are well suited for this\r\npurpose. Of these, the best are those rich in organic matter, the\r\nso-called peaty soils. Peat, when dried and freed from any earthy\r\nmatter, forms an excellent absorbent of the liquid portion of the\r\nmanure, surpassing in this respect straw itself. It is, further,\r\ngenerally very much richer in nitrogen--some peats having been found to\r\ncontain between 4 and 5 per cent of nitrogen. In some thirty samples of\r\npeat analysed by Professor S. W. Johnson, the percentage of nitrogen\r\nvaried from .4 to 2.9, giving an average of 1.5 per cent.\r\n\r\nWhile it has a very great capacity for absorbing liquids, it possesses\r\nin an unequalled degree the power of retaining the soluble nitrogen\r\ncompounds. This is undoubtedly one of the most important properties\r\nwhich recommend peat for the purposes of litter.[146]\r\n\r\nSome interesting experiments on the value of peat-moss as a litter have\r\nbeen recently carried out by Dr Bernard Dyer.[147] From these\r\nexperiments Mr Dyer has found that both its liquid-absorbing and\r\nliquid-retaining powers are very much greater than those of straw. While\r\nstraw was only able to absorb three times its weight of water, peat-moss\r\nwas found to absorb nearly ten times its weight. With regard to its\r\nwater-retaining power, this was also found to be in excess of that of\r\nstraw. Both these properties are, it need scarcely be pointed out, of\r\nvery great value in a litter. Another point of interest in these\r\nexperiments was the respective amounts of nitrogen absorbed and retained\r\nby the peat-moss and the straw. It was found that, in this respect, the\r\npeat-moss had again an advantage over the straw. Lastly, the manure\r\nproduced by the peat-moss was shown to be richer in fertilising matter\r\nthan that produced by the use of straw.[148] These experiments are\r\ninteresting as demonstrating the fact that in peat-moss we have a\r\nsubstance which is capable of acting as an excellent substitute for the\r\nmore costly straw, and which might increasingly be used as a fodder with\r\ngreat benefit to the farmer.\r\n\r\nAnother substance which has been suggested as an excellent litter is the\r\ncommon _bracken-fern_. According to some analyses made by Mr John\r\nHughes, the bracken, especially if cut in a young state, is a substance\r\nof considerable manurial value. When dried, it is very much richer in\r\nnitrogen, potash, and lime than straw. Its absorbent properties,\r\nhowever, are probably not so great. Where it can easily and cheaply be\r\nhad, as in many parts of Scotland and Ireland, it might well be used for\r\nlittering purposes.[149]\r\n\r\n_Dried leaves_ have also been used as a litter. Autumn leaves, however,\r\ncontain a very small percentage of fertilising matter. This is due to\r\nthe fact that the most of their potash, phosphoric acid, and nitrogen\r\npass into the body of the trees at the approach of winter. According to\r\nProfessor Storer, dried leaves only contain from .1 to .5 per cent\r\npotash,.006 to .3 per cent phosphoric acid, and about .75 per cent of\r\nnitrogen. Leaves, however, besides being poor in manurial ingredients,\r\nmake a bad litter, as they ferment but slowly. There is in this\r\nfermentation a large quantity of cold sour humic acid formed, which\r\nseriously impairs the value of the manure.[150]\r\n\r\nHaving now considered the composition of the three separate ingredients\r\nof farmyard manure--viz., the _dung_ or _solid excreta_, the _urine_,\r\nand the _litter_--we are in a position to consider the composition of\r\nfarmyard manure. In this connection it will be well to consider\r\nseparately the manures produced by the different farm animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Horse-manure._\r\n\r\nThe composition of horse-manure is perhaps the most uniform of all the\r\nmanures produced by the different farm animals. This is due to the fact\r\nthat the food of the horse is generally of the same kind, consisting of\r\noats, hay, and straw.\r\n\r\nThe total excrements voided by a horse in a day have been calculated,\r\naccording to the average of experiments by Boussingault and Hofmeister,\r\nat 28.11 lb., of which only 6.37 lb. consisted of dry matter.[151] These\r\n28.11 lb. contained .18 lb. of nitrogen and .92 lb. of mineral matter.\r\nThe amount of straw necessary to absorb this amount of excrement may be\r\nstated at from 4 to 6 lb. The amounts of nitrogen and mineral matter in\r\n4 lb. of straw are .01 and .23 lb. respectively. The total amount of\r\nnitrogen and ash, therefore, in the farmyard manure produced by a horse\r\nin one day, would be .19 lb. nitrogen and 1.15 lb. mineral matter; or,\r\nif we take the larger quantity of straw, somewhat more.\r\n\r\nTaking these figures, we find that the amount of manure produced by a\r\nhorse in a year will be from 11,720 to 12,450 lb. (_i.e._, from 5-1/4\r\nto 5-1/2 tons),[152] containing from 69 to 73 lb. nitrogen, and from 420\r\nto 460 lb. mineral matter.[153]\r\n\r\nA word or two may be of value regarding the treatment in the stable of\r\nhorse-manure. The great object to be aimed at is the prevention of loss\r\nof valuable fertilising constituents. This loss may be due to two\r\ncauses. It may be, in the first place, caused by drainage of the soluble\r\nmatter of the manure; or secondly, it may be due to volatilisation of\r\nthe volatile constituents.\r\n\r\nThe first of these two sources of loss depends on the precautions taken\r\nin the way of providing a proper impervious flooring to the stable. This\r\nsource of loss is extremely difficult to prevent, inasmuch as nearly all\r\nmaterials used for flooring absorb a certain percentage of urine. The\r\njudicious use of litter, however, will minimise this loss to within a\r\ntrifling extent.\r\n\r\nDr Heiden states that the amount of straw used as litter for the horse\r\nin Germany is from 4 to 6 lb. per day. The quantity should be regulated\r\naccording to the percentage of water the excreta contain; the more\r\nwatery excreta requiring naturally a larger quantity of litter. The most\r\neminent authorities on this subject recommend that the amount of litter\r\nshould equal one-fourth of the food in its natural state, or about\r\none-third of its dry substance.\r\n\r\nThe second source of loss, which is due to volatilisation of the\r\nvolatile ingredients, may be largely prevented by the use of certain\r\npreservatives.\r\n\r\nHorse-dung being, comparatively speaking, of a dry nature, it is\r\nextremely difficult to effect its thorough mixture with the litter. For\r\nthis reason the manure formed from horse excreta is particularly liable\r\nto rapid fermentation.[154] In the process of fermentation, as will be\r\nseen more in detail further on, the nitrogen is converted into carbonate\r\nof ammonia. As nitrogen in this form is of an extremely volatile nature,\r\nthe risks of loss from this source are considerable. As illustrating\r\nthis fact, it may be mentioned that Boussingault has found by experiment\r\nthat the total percentage of nitrogen contained by fresh horse-manure\r\nmight be reduced in the process of fermentation to one-half of its\r\noriginal amount by loss from this source.\r\n\r\nThe preservatives used to prevent this volatilisation are technically\r\nknown as \"fixers.\" This they do by chemically combining with the\r\nvolatile ammonia and forming non-volatile compounds with it.\r\n\r\nOf the acid fixers, hydrochloric and sulphuric acids have been\r\nrecommended. The former, however, is not well suited for this purpose.\r\nIt is a strongly fuming acid, and when brought into contact with\r\nammonia forms dense white fumes. The use of sulphuric acid is not open\r\nto this objection. Sulphate of ammonia, the salt formed in this case, is\r\none of the most stable (or least volatile) of the compounds of ammonia.\r\nIf used, it should be largely diluted with water, and the whole mixed\r\nwith sand. Such a mixture, when sprinkled over the stable-floor in even\r\nvery small quantities, has been found to effectually prevent any loss of\r\nthe volatile carbonate of ammonia.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, on the whole advisable to use an acid substance as a\r\nfixer, since such a substance may act deleteriously on the horses'\r\nhoofs.\r\n\r\nSuch substances as _gypsum_, _copperas_, and _sulphate of magnesia_,\r\nwhile equally efficient, are not open to this objection. The\r\nabove-mentioned substances owe their efficacy to the fact that they are\r\ncompounds of sulphuric acid, which, by combining with the volatile\r\nammonia and forming sulphate of ammonia, prevent its escape.\r\n\r\nGypsum, or sulphate of lime, although, comparatively speaking, an\r\ninsoluble substance, when brought in contact with carbonate of ammonia\r\nhas been proved to effect the conversion of the ammonia into sulphate of\r\nammonia. It is also believed to retard the decomposition of the\r\nmanure.[155] Copperas, or ferrous sulphate, while a soluble salt, and\r\nwhile thus acting in a more speedy manner in fixing the ammonia, is not\r\nso well suited, owing to the hurtful influence it is well known to\r\npossess on plant-life. It is only right to remember that there may be\r\ncircumstances in which copperas may, in small quantities, act even\r\nbeneficially as a manure, as Griffiths' experiments would seem to\r\nindicate. The above objection, however, cannot be urged against sulphate\r\nof magnesia. In addition to fixing the ammonia, sulphate of magnesia may\r\nvery probably fix the soluble phosphoric acid. Kainit, which consists of\r\na mixture of sulphates and chlorides of potassium and magnesium, has\r\nalso been suggested for this purpose. By using such a fixer, the value\r\nof the resulting manure would be much enhanced. In conclusion, it must\r\nbe remembered that all the above-named fixers act very much in the same\r\nway--viz., by converting the volatile carbonate of ammonia into sulphate\r\nof ammonia.[156]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Cow-manure._\r\n\r\nThe composition of the manure formed from the excrementitious matter of\r\nthe cow is very much less constant than is the case in the horse-manure.\r\nAn average statement of that composition is therefore very much more\r\ndifficult to obtain. The number of analyses available for the purpose of\r\nforming this average is, however, very large. The manure produced by\r\ncows contains a large percentage of water. This is due to the large\r\nquantity of water they drink. It has been estimated that milch-cows\r\ndrink along with their winter food, for every pound of dry substance, 4\r\nlb. of water, and in summer about 6 lb.\r\n\r\nAccording to some experiments by Boussingault, the excrements of a cow\r\nin a day amounted to 73.23 lb., of which only 9.92 lb. were dry\r\nmatter.[157] These excrements contained .256 lb. of nitrogen and 1.725\r\nlb. of mineral matter. The amount of straw necessary to use as litter\r\nfor this amount of excrements may be taken at 6 to 10 lb. The manure,\r\ntherefore, formed by a cow per day, would contain from .274 to .286 lb.\r\nof nitrogen, and from 2.046 to 2.278 lb. of mineral matter. In a year\r\nthis would amount to from 100 to 104.4 lb. of nitrogen, and from 746.8\r\nlb. to 831.5 lb. of mineral matter; or from 6 cwt. 75 lb. to 7 cwt. 47\r\nlb.\r\n\r\nCow-dung is, owing to its more watery nature and poorer quality, very\r\nmuch slower in its fermentation than horse-dung. When applied alone,\r\ncow-manure is very slow in its action, and makes its influence felt for\r\nat least three or four years. It is difficult to spread it evenly over\r\nthe soil, owing to the fact that, when somewhat dried, it has a tendency\r\nto form hard masses, which, when buried in the soil, may resist\r\ndecomposition for a very long period. The cause of this is due to the\r\npresence of a considerable amount of mucilaginous and resinous matter in\r\nthe solid excreta, which prevents the entrance of moisture and air into\r\nthe centre of the mass. This tendency of cow-manure to resist\r\ndecomposition will be greatly lessened in the case of the excrements of\r\na cow richly fed.\r\n\r\nThe risks of loss of volatile ammonia are, therefore, in its case not so\r\ngreat as we have seen them to be in the case of the \"hot\" horse-dung.\r\nNotwithstanding this fact, much of what has been said on the use of\r\npreservatives for horse-manure may be also applied to the cow-dung. This\r\nis owing to the fact that the dung is allowed to accumulate in the court\r\nfor some time. The amount of straw it is advisable to use as litter\r\nvaries, as has been said, from 6 to 10 lb. per day. The best method of\r\ncalculating this amount, according to Dr Heiden, is by taking one-third\r\nof the total weight of the dry substance of the food. The above\r\nauthority also recommends that the straw is best applied in blocks of\r\nabout one foot in length; and this for the following reasons:--\r\n\r\n1. The strewing of it is more convenient.\r\n\r\n2. The absorption of the fluid portion is more complete.\r\n\r\n3. The cleaning out of the manure from the byre is easier.\r\n\r\n4. The manure is more easily distributed when applied to the field.\r\n\r\nAmong the advantages incidental to allowing the manure to accumulate in\r\nthe court may be mentioned the following:--\r\n\r\n1. The more thorough absorption of the urine by the straw, and,\r\nconsequently, the more uniform mixture which will be thus effected of\r\nthe more valuable urine with the less valuable solid excreta.\r\n\r\n2. A certain retardation of decomposition effected by the treading under\r\nfoot of the manure.\r\n\r\n3. The protection of the manure from rain and wind, and the securing of\r\na uniform temperature.\r\n\r\nAgainst those advantages must be placed the risk of seriously affecting\r\nthe health of the animal. Although this is a point of very great\r\nimportance, it scarcely falls within the scope of this work. It may be\r\npointed out, however, that the judicious use of some of the chemical\r\nfixers previously referred to may do much to keep the air of the byre or\r\ncourt free of noxious gases.[158]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Pig-manure._\r\n\r\nThe food of the pig is so very variable in its character that it is\r\nwellnigh impossible to obtain anything like an average analysis of its\r\nexcrements. When the food of the pig is rich, then the manure may be\r\nquite equal in quality to the other manures. According to Boussingault,\r\nthe total amount of excrements, on an average, voided by a pig in\r\ntwenty-four hours is about 8.32 lb., of which 1.5 lb. is dry\r\nmatter.[159] The amount of nitrogen these excrements contain is only .05\r\nlb., and of mineral ingredients .313 lb. If we take the amount of straw\r\nmost suitable for absorbing this quantity of excrementitious matter at\r\nfrom 4 to 8 lb., then we shall find that the manure produced by a pig\r\nwill contain from .06 to .074 lb. nitrogen and .545 to .772 lb. mineral\r\nmatter. These quantities, calculated for a year, give from 22 to 27 lb.\r\nof nitrogen, and from 1 cwt. 87 lb. to 2 cwt. 57 lb. of mineral matter.\r\nThat is about as much nitrogen as would be contained in 1-1/4 to 1-1/2\r\ncwt. of nitrate of soda (95 per cent purity); or from slightly less than\r\n1 cwt. to slightly over 1 cwt. of sulphate of ammonia (97 per cent\r\npurity).\r\n\r\nAs has already been pointed out, the excrements of the pig are, as a\r\nrule, very poor in nitrogen. This accounts for the fact that pig-manure\r\nis a \"cold\" manure, slow in fermenting.[160]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Sheep-manure._\r\n\r\nThe dung and the urine of the sheep, as we have already seen, are,\r\nweight for weight, the most valuable of any of the common farm animals.\r\nThe total weight of the excrements voided by a sheep in a day may be\r\ntaken, on an average,[161] at 3.78 lb., of which .97 lb. is dry matter.\r\nThese excrements contain .038 lb. of nitrogen and .223 lb. mineral\r\nmatter. Taking the amount of straw most suitable for absorbing this\r\nquantity of excrementitious matter at three-fifths of a pound, then the\r\nmanure produced by a sheep in a day will contain .0429 lb. nitrogen and\r\n.264 lb. mineral matter. That is, in a year the quantities of nitrogen\r\nand mineral matter in the manure produced by a sheep would be 15.66 lb.\r\nof nitrogen and 96.36 lb. of mineral matter.\r\n\r\nFrom its richness in nitrogen, and from its dry condition, sheep-dung is\r\npeculiarly liable to ferment. While richer in fertilising substances\r\nthan horse-manure, it is not so rapid in its fermentation. This is due\r\nto the harder and more compact physical character of the solid excreta.\r\nThe risks of loss of volatile ammonia are, in its case, exceptionally\r\ngreat. The use of artificial \"fixers\" is therefore to be strongly\r\nrecommended.[162]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fermentation of Farmyard Manure._\r\n\r\nHaving now considered the nature of the different manures produced by\r\nthe four common farm animals separately, it is of importance to consider\r\nthe exact nature of the fermentation, decomposition, or putrefaction\r\nwhich takes place in the manure-heap.\r\n\r\nIt is now more than thirty years since Pasteur showed that the\r\nfermentation which ensued on keeping a sample of urine was due to the\r\naction of a minute organism, for the propagation of which a certain\r\namount of warmth, air, and moisture, as well as the presence of certain\r\nfood-constituents, especially nitrogenous bodies, were necessary.\r\n\r\nSubsequent researches by Pasteur and others have conclusively\r\ndemonstrated that the micro-organic life instrumental in effecting the\r\nputrefaction or decay of organic matter of any kind, may be divided into\r\ntwo great classes:--\r\n\r\n1. Those which require a plentiful supply of oxygen for their\r\ndevelopment, and which, when bereft of oxygen, die--known as _aerobies_.\r\n\r\n2. Those which, on the contrary, develop in the complete absence of\r\noxygen, and which, when exposed to oxygen, die--known as _anaerobies_.\r\n\r\nIn the fermentation of the manure-heap, therefore, we must conceive of\r\nthe two classes of organisms as the active agents. In the interior\r\nportion of the manure-heap, where the supply of oxygen is necessarily\r\nlimited, the fermentation going on there is effected by means of the\r\nanaerobic organism--_i.e._, the organism which does not require oxygen;\r\nwhile on the surface portion, which is exposed to the air, the aerobic\r\n(or oxygen-requiring) organism is similarly active. Gradually, as decay\r\nprogresses, the aerobic organisms increase in number. It is through\r\ntheir instrumentality that the final products of decomposition are\r\nlargely produced. The functions of the anaerobic organisms may be, on\r\nthe contrary, regarded as largely preparatory in their nature. By\r\nbreaking up the complex organic substances in the manure into new and\r\nsimpler forms, they advance the process of putrefaction through the\r\ninitial stages; and when this is accomplished, they die and give place\r\nto the aerobic, which, as we have just seen, effect the final\r\ntransformation of the organic matter into such simple substances as\r\n_water_ and _carbonic acid gas_.\r\n\r\nThe conditions influencing the fermentation of farmyard manure may be\r\nsummed up as follows:[163]--\r\n\r\n1. _Temperature._--The higher the temperature the more rapidly will the\r\nmanure decay.\r\n\r\n2. _Openness to the Air._--Of course it will be seen that the effect of\r\nexposing the manure to the action of the air is to induce the\r\ndevelopment of the aerobic type of organism, and thus to promote more\r\nrapid fermentation. If, on the other hand, the manure be impacted, the\r\nslower but more regular fermentation, due to the anaerobic type of\r\norganism, will be chiefly promoted. It must be remembered that in the\r\nproper rotting of farmyard manure both kinds of fermentation should be\r\nfostered. It is, in fact, on the careful regulation of the two classes\r\nof fermentation that the successful rotting of the manure depends. It\r\nmust further be remembered that, even with a certain amount of openness\r\nin a manure-heap, anaerobic fermentation may take place. This is due to\r\nthe fact that the evolution of carbonic acid gas, in such a case, is so\r\ngreat as to exclude the access of the atmospheric oxygen into the pores\r\nof the heap.\r\n\r\n3. The _dampness_ of the manure-heap is another important influence.\r\nThis, of course, will act in two ways. First, by lowering the\r\ntemperature. Where the manure-heap is found to be suffering from\r\n\"fire-fang,\" the common method in practice is to lower the temperature\r\nby moistening the heap with water. Secondly, it acts as a retarder of\r\nfermentation by limiting the supply of atmospheric oxygen, and thus\r\npreventing, as we have just seen, aerobic fermentation.\r\n\r\n4. The fourth chief influence in regulating fermentation of the\r\nmanure-heap is its _composition_, and more especially the amount of\r\nnitrogen it contains in a soluble form. The rate at which fermentation\r\ntakes place in any organic substance may be said chiefly to depend on\r\nthe percentage of soluble nitrogenous matter it contains: the greater\r\nthis is in amount, the more quickly does fermentation go on. There are\r\nalways a number of soluble nitrogenous bodies in farmyard manure. These\r\nare chiefly found in the urine, such as _urea_, _uric_ and _hippuric\r\nacids_, and _ammonia_ salts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Products of Decomposition of Farmyard Manure._\r\n\r\nThe most important of the changes which take place in the rotting of\r\nfarmyard manure may be briefly enumerated as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. The gradual conversion into gases of a large portion of the organic\r\nelements in the manure. Of these gaseous products the most abundant is\r\n_carbonic acid gas_ (CO_2). It is in this form that the carbonaceous\r\nmatter which constitutes the chief portion of the manure escapes into\r\nthe air. Carbon also escapes into the air, combined with hydrogen, in\r\nthe form of _carburetted hydrogen_ or _marsh-gas_ (CH_4), a product of\r\nthe decomposition of organic matter in the presence of a large quantity\r\nof water. This gas is consequently found bubbling up through stagnant\r\nwater. Next to carbonic acid gas, _water_ (H_2O) is the most abundant\r\ngaseous product of decomposition. The nitrogen present in the manure, in\r\ndifferent forms, is converted by the process of decomposition chiefly\r\ninto _ammonia_, which, combining with the carbonic acid, forms carbonate\r\nof ammonia, a very volatile salt. It is to this fact that one of the\r\ngreat sources of loss in the decomposition of farmyard manure is due. If\r\nthe temperature of the manure-heap be permitted to rise too high, the\r\ncarbonate of ammonia volatilises. It is probable, also, that a not\r\ninconsiderable portion of the nitrogen escapes into the air in the free\r\nstate. The last of the most important gaseous products of decomposition\r\nare _sulphuretted_ and _phosphoretted hydrogen_. It is to these gases\r\nthat much of the smell of rotting farmyard manure is due.\r\n\r\n2. The second class of substances formed are _soluble organic acids_,\r\nsuch as _humic_ and _ulmic acids_. The function performed by these acids\r\nis a very important one. They unite with the ammonia and the alkali\r\nsubstances in the mineral portion of the manure, forming humates and\r\nulmates of ammonia, potash, &c. It is these ulmates that form the black\r\nliquor which oozes out from the manure-heap.\r\n\r\nIn very rotten farmyard manure traces of _nitric acid_ may be found; but\r\nit must be remembered that the formation of nitrates is practically\r\nimpossible under the ordinary conditions of active fermentation of\r\nfarmyard manure, except perhaps in its very last stages.\r\n\r\n3. The third class of changes taking place have to do with the mineral\r\nportion of the manure. The result of the formation of so much carbonic\r\nand other organic acids is to increase the amount of _soluble_ mineral\r\nmatter very considerably.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Analyses of Farmyard Manure._\r\n\r\nIt is chiefly to the valuable researches of the late Dr Augustus\r\nVoelcker that we owe our knowledge of the composition of old and fresh\r\nfarmyard manure. All interested in this important question should peruse\r\nthe original papers on this subject contributed to the 'Journal of the\r\nRoyal Agricultural Society' by Dr Voelcker. Typical analyses\r\nillustrating the variation in the composition of farmyard manure at\r\ndifferent stages of decomposition will be found in the Appendix.[164]\r\nFrom what has been already said, it is obvious chat the composition of\r\nfarmyard manure is of a very variable nature.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of moisture naturally varies most, and this variation will\r\ndepend on the age of the manure, and the conditions under which it is\r\npermitted to decay. It may be taken at from a minimum of 65 per cent in\r\nfresh to 80 per cent in well-rotted manure. The total organic matter may\r\nbe taken at from 13 to 14 per cent, containing nitrogen .4 to .65 per\r\ncent. The total mineral matter will range from about 4 to 6.5 per cent,\r\ncontaining of potash from .4 to .7 per cent, and of phosphoric acid from\r\n.2 to .4 per cent.[165]\r\n\r\nAs Mr Warington[166] has pointed out, one ton of farmyard manure would\r\nthus contain 9 to 15 lb. of nitrogen, about the same quantity of potash,\r\nand 4 to 9 lb. of phosphoric acid. These quantities of nitrogen and\r\nphosphoric acid, calculated to (95 per cent) nitrate of soda, and (97\r\nper cent) sulphate of ammonia, and (25 per cent) superphosphate, give\r\nrespectively 57.25 to 96 lb. nitrate of soda, 45 to 75 lb. sulphate of\r\nammonia, and 35 to 79 lb. superphosphate. That is, in order to apply as\r\nmuch nitrogen to the soil as is contained in one ton of nitrate of soda,\r\nwe should require to use from 23 to 41 tons of farmyard manure:\r\nsimilarly one ton of sulphate of ammonia contains as much nitrogen as 30\r\nto 50 tons farmyard manure. In the same way one ton of superphosphate\r\nof lime contains as much phosphoric acid as 28 to 64 tons farmyard\r\nmanure.\r\n\r\nThe value of rotten manure is, weight for weight, greater than that of\r\nfresh manure. This is due to the fact that, while the water increases in\r\namount, the loss of organic matter of a non-nitrogenous nature more than\r\ncounterbalances the increase in water. The manure, therefore, becomes\r\nmore concentrated in quality. The loss on the total weight, according to\r\nWolff, in the rotting of farmyard manure, should not exceed in two or\r\nthree months' time 16 to 20 per cent--viz., a sixth to a fifth of its\r\nentire weight. Not only, however, does the manure become richer in\r\nmanurial ingredients, but the forms in which the manurial ingredients\r\nare present in rotten manure are more valuable, as they are more\r\nsoluble. These statements must not be taken as proving that it is more\r\neconomical to apply farmyard manure in a rotten condition than in a\r\nfresh one. The distinction must not be lost sight of which exists\r\nbetween relative increase--increase in the percentage of valuable\r\nconstituents--and absolute increase. The increase in the value of the\r\nmanure by the changes of the manurial ingredients from the insoluble to\r\nthe soluble condition may be effected at the expense of a considerable\r\namount of absolute loss of these valuable ingredients. This is a point\r\nwhich is probably too often left out of account in discussing the\r\nrelative merits of fresh and rotten farmyard manure; and it is\r\nimportant that it should be clearly understood. In the words of the late\r\nDr Voelcker: \"Direct experiments have shown that 100 cwt. of fresh\r\nfarmyard manure are reduced to 80 cwt. if allowed to lie till the straw\r\nis half rotten; 100 cwt. of fresh farmyard manure are reduced to 60 cwt.\r\nif allowed to ferment till it becomes 'fat or cheesy'; 100 cwt. of fresh\r\nfarmyard manure are reduced to 40-50 cwt. if completely decomposed. This\r\nloss not only affects the water and other less valuable constituents of\r\nfarmyard manure, but also its most fertilising ingredients. Chemical\r\nanalysis has shown that 100 cwt. of common farmyard manure contain about\r\n40 lb. of nitrogen, and that during fermentation in the first period 5\r\nlb. of nitrogen are dissipated in the form of volatile ammonia; in the\r\nsecond, 10 lb.; in the third, 20 lb. Completely decomposed common manure\r\nhas thus lost about one-half of its most valuable constituent.\"[167]\r\nWhile, of course, a very great amount of absolute loss of the valuable\r\nconstituents--the nitrogen and ash-constituents--of farmyard manure may\r\ntake place through volatilisation and drainage, by taking requisite\r\nprecautions this loss may be very much minimised. As regards the total\r\nloss, this, in two or three months' time, should only amount to 16 to 20\r\nper cent--or one-sixth to one-fifth of the weight.[168] The use of\r\nfixers, to which reference has already been made, will greatly minimise\r\nthis loss. The application of fixers is best made to the manure when\r\nstill in the stall or byre. The health of the animal benefits by so\r\ndoing, while the manure is at once guarded against loss from this\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nAs to the relative merits of covered and uncovered manure-heaps, much\r\ndifference of opinion exists. It is one of those questions which does\r\nnot admit of final decision one way or another, as it depends so largely\r\non the individual circumstances of each case. That manure produced under\r\ncover is more valuable than manure made in the open is readily granted.\r\nThe question, however, is as to whether the increase in its value is\r\nsufficiently great to warrant the extra expense involved in building\r\ncovered courts. This depends on the individual circumstances of each\r\ncase, and cannot be decided in a general way. For experiments on the\r\nrelative value of manure made under cover and in the open, see\r\nAppendix.[169]\r\n\r\nThe method of applying farmyard manure to the field is a question which\r\nbelongs more to the practical farmer than, to the scientist, and must be\r\nlargely decided by economic considerations. There is an aspect, however,\r\nof the question which may well be treated here. The first point in the\r\nproduction of good manure is in connection with its even distribution.\r\nIt is of great importance that the excrements of the different farm\r\nanimals be thoroughly mixed together. By the intimate incorporation of\r\nthe \"hot\" horse-dung with the \"cold\" cow and pig dung, uniform\r\nfermentation is secured. Fire-fang--or too rapid fermentation--may occur\r\nfrom this not being properly done, and from the manure becoming too dry.\r\nIt is important, also, as we shall see immediately, to have the manure\r\nuniform in quality when applied to the field. The manure ought to be\r\nfirmly trodden down, to moderate the rate of fermentation. Where the\r\nmanure-heap is exposed to rain, the quantity of water it will naturally\r\nreceive will probably be quite sufficient, if indeed not too much, to\r\nensure a proper rate of fermentation--except, perhaps, in very warm\r\nweather. The great point to be aimed at is to ensure regular\r\nfermentation. What has to be especially avoided is any sudden exposure\r\nof the manure to large quantities of water. The result of such a\r\nwashing-out of the soluble nitrogen is to retard fermentation, besides\r\nincurring the risk of great actual loss by drainage.[170]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Application of Farmyard Manure to the Field._\r\n\r\nIn applying the manure to the field, and before ploughing it in, two\r\nmethods of procedure may be pursued. First, the manure may be set out in\r\nheaps, larger or smaller, over the field, and be allowed to remain in\r\nthese heaps some time before being spread; and secondly, it may be\r\ndirectly spread broadcast over the field, and thus allowed to lie for\r\nsome time. Lastly, the manure may be ploughed in immediately; and it may\r\nbe stated that such a method is, where circumstances permit, the safest\r\nand most economical method.[171]\r\n\r\nIn discussing the merits and demerits of these two methods, Dr Heiden\r\npoints out, first, with regard to the distribution of the manure in\r\nsmall heaps over the field, that this is not to be recommended, on the\r\nfollowing grounds:--\r\n\r\n1. Because the chances of loss by volatilisation are thereby increased.\r\nThe manure is distributed several times instead of only once or twice.\r\n\r\n2. It is apt to ensure unequal distribution. The separate heaps run the\r\nrisk of losing their soluble nitrogenous matter, which soaks into the\r\nground beneath the heaps. The other portions of the field not covered by\r\nthe manure-heaps are thus manured with washed-out farmyard manure,\r\nbereft of its most valuable constituents. The result is, that while\r\ncertain portions of the field are too strongly manured, other portions\r\nare too weakly manured.\r\n\r\n3. The proper fermentation of the manure is apt to be interfered with by\r\nthe loss of that which is its most important agent--viz., the soluble\r\nnitrogenous matter--and also by the drying action of the wind.\r\n\r\nThe same objections hold good to a large extent with regard to the\r\nsetting out in the fields of the manure in large heaps. The risks of\r\nloss, in one respect, may be said to be less, owing to the smaller\r\nsurface presented. On the other hand, they may be greater, owing to\r\nfermentation taking place more quickly. Agricultural practice, however,\r\noften renders this custom necessary; and if precautions are taken not to\r\nlet the heap lie too long, and to cover it over with earth, the risk of\r\nserious loss may be rendered inconsiderable.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the second method of procedure--viz., the spreading of\r\nthe manure broadcast over the field, and allowing it thus to lie--Dr\r\nHeiden is of opinion that this should only be done when the field is\r\nlevel. In the case of uneven ground the risks are, of course, obvious.\r\nIt has been affirmed that, by allowing farmyard manure thus to lie\r\nexposed for some time, an important loss of volatile ammonia--carbonate\r\nof ammonia--is apt to take place. This could only take place where the\r\nformer treatment of the farmyard manure had been bad. Hellriegel has\r\nshown that in the case of properly prepared farmyard manure there is no\r\ndanger of loss in this way. The absorptive power of the soil for\r\nammonia, it must be remembered, is very great, and the amount of\r\nvolatile ammonia in farmyard manure is relatively so small that it is\r\nscarcely possible that any could escape in this way. Hellriegel's\r\nexperiments have demonstrated this in a very striking way. He has found\r\nthat in the case of a chalky soil, and during the summer and autumn\r\nmonths, practically no loss of ammonia takes place. The following\r\nconsiderations may be further urged in support of this method of\r\napplication, as against immediately ploughing in the manure, viz.:--\r\n\r\n1. That fermentation takes place more quickly.\r\n\r\n2. That it results in a more equable distribution of the manurial\r\nconstituents in the dung, by gradually and thoroughly incorporating the\r\nliquid portion of the manure with the soil-particles.\r\n\r\nAgainst, however, these undoubted advantages, one serious disadvantage\r\nmay be urged--viz., that the manure, before being ploughed in, becomes\r\nrobbed to a large extent of its soluble nitrogenous compounds, which, as\r\nwe have repeatedly observed, are so necessary for fermentation; and\r\nthat, therefore, when it is ploughed in, it does not so readily ferment.\r\nThis being so, it is highly advisable, in the case of light or sandy\r\nsoils, not to follow such a practice, but to plough the manure directly\r\nin.\r\n\r\nAs to the depth to which it is advisable to plough the manure in, it may\r\nbe here noticed that it should not be too deep, so as to permit of the\r\naccess of sufficient moisture to ensure proper fermentation, and to\r\nprevent rapid washing down of nitrates to the drains. Lastly, it need\r\nscarcely be pointed out that it is highly important to have the manure\r\nevenly and thoroughly incorporated with the soil-particles. Where the\r\nmanure is permitted to cake together in lumps, it may successfully\r\nresist the action of fermentation for several years.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Value and Function of Farmyard Manure._\r\n\r\nPractical experience has long demonstrated the fact that farmyard manure\r\nis, taking it all round, the most valuable, and admits of the most\r\nuniversal application, of all manures; and science has done much to\r\nexplain the reason of this. The influence of farmyard manure is so\r\nmany-sided that it is difficult even to enumerate its different\r\nfunctions. As has already been pointed out, its indirect value as a\r\nmanure is probably as great as, if indeed even not greater than, its\r\ndirect value. In concluding our study of farmyard manure, we shall\r\nendeavour to summarise, in as brief a manner as possible, its chief\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\nFirst, as to its value as a supplier of the necessary elements of\r\nplant-food. This, there can be little doubt, has been, and still is,\r\ngrossly exaggerated by the ordinary farmer. Much has been claimed for it\r\nas a \"general\" manure. How far it merits pre-eminence on this score\r\namong other manures will be seen in the sequel. It is true that, since\r\nit is composed of vegetable matter, it contains all the necessary plant\r\ningredients.[172] As has been shown in the Introduction, there is\r\npractically in the case of most soils no necessity to add to a manure\r\nany more than the three ingredients, _nitrogen_, _phosphoric acid_, and\r\n_potash_. Its value, then, as a direct manure, must depend on the\r\nquantity and proportion in which these three ingredients are present.\r\nThese substances, as we have already seen, it contains only in very\r\nsmall quantities. It is, judged from this point of view, a comparatively\r\npoor manure. Furthermore, only a certain percentage of these substances\r\nis in a soluble or immediately available condition,--in this respect the\r\nrotten manure being very much more valuable than the fresh manure.\r\n\r\nAgain, a point of great importance in a universal manure is the\r\nproportion in which the necessary plant-foods are present. If it be\r\nasked, Are the nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash in farmyard manure\r\npresent in the proportion in which crops require these constituents? the\r\nanswer must be in the negative. Heiden[173] has very strikingly\r\nillustrated this point, in so far as the relations between the two ash\r\ningredients are concerned, by some computations as to the amount which\r\nwould be removed from the soil in the course of different\r\nrotations.[174] In the case of five different rotations it was found\r\nthat the ratio between the potash and phosphoric acid removed was as\r\nfollows:[175] (1) 2.96 to 1; (2) 2.76 to 1; (3) 2.95 to 1; (4) 4.13 to\r\n1; (5) 3.78 to 1. This would give a mean of 3.32 to 1. This is not the\r\nratio in which these ingredients are generally present in farmyard\r\nmanure. Farmyard manure may be said to be much richer in the mineral\r\nconstituents of plants than in nitrogen. Professor Heiden found that in\r\nthe case of a farm at Waldau, the crops in the course of ten years\r\nremoved from a _morgen_ (.631 of an acre) the following quantities:--\r\n\r\n                       lb.\r\nNitrogen               329\r\nPotash                 263\r\nPhosphoric acid        121\r\n\r\nIn order to supply these amounts the following quantities of manure\r\nwould require to be supplied:--\r\n\r\n1. For the nitrogen, 26 or 27 tons (manure containing .606 per cent\r\nnitrogen).\r\n\r\n2. For the potash, 20 to 25 tons (manure containing .672 per cent\r\npotash).\r\n\r\n3. For the phosphoric acid, 13 to 19 tons (manure containing .315 per\r\ncent phosphoric acid).\r\n\r\nFrom the above it will be seen that farmyard manure contains too little\r\nnitrogen in proportion to its ash ingredients.\r\n\r\nIt is not merely the amount of fertilising ingredients removed by the\r\ncrop we have to take into account in estimating the value of certain\r\nmanurial ingredients for the different crops. Two other considerations\r\nhave to be remembered--viz., the amount of the constituents already\r\npresent in the soil, and the ability of the different crops to obtain\r\nthe ingredients from the soil. If we take into account these two\r\nconsiderations in estimating the value of farmyard manure as a general\r\nmanure, we shall find that they accentuate the inadequacy of the ratio\r\nexisting between the nitrogen and the mineral ingredients. Messrs Lawes\r\nand Gilbert have found in the Rothamsted experiments with farmyard\r\nmanure, that while it restored the mineral ingredients, it was\r\ninadequate as a sufficient source of nitrogen. Nitrogen is, of all\r\nmanurial ingredients, in least abundance in soils. It is consequently\r\nfound that the ingredient in which farmyard manure requires to be\r\nreinforced is nitrogen. With regard to phosphoric acid and potash, it\r\nhas already been shown that the ratio between them is probably greater\r\nthan that in a good average manure. We should, arguing from this alone,\r\nbe inclined to think that farmyard manure would be best reinforced with\r\npotash. The reverse is the case, however, as every farmer knows. This is\r\ndue, first, to the fact that the potash, unlike the phosphoric acid, is\r\nentirely of a soluble nature, and therefore immediately available for\r\nthe plant's needs; and secondly, to the fact that the necessity for the\r\napplication of potash as a manure is generally not nearly so great as in\r\nthe case of phosphoric acid. The result is, that farmyard manure will\r\nbe, as a rule, more valuably supplemented by phosphoric acid than by\r\npotash.\r\n\r\nAnother point of great importance, in estimating the value of farmyard\r\nmanure as a chemical manure, is the inferior value possessed by much of\r\nthe nitrogen it contains, as compared with the nitrogen in such\r\nartificial manures as nitrate of soda and sulphate of ammonia. According\r\nto the Rothamsted experiments, weight for weight, the nitrogen in\r\nfarmyard manure is not half so valuable as it is in sulphate of ammonia.\r\nMuch of the nitrogen becomes only very slowly available; not a little of\r\nit perhaps actually takes years to be converted into nitrates.[176]\r\n\r\nThus, with regard to the direct value of farmyard manure as a manure, we\r\nhave seen--\r\n\r\n1. That it contains a very small quantity of the three fertilising\r\ningredients.\r\n\r\n2. That the proportion in which these three ingredients are present is\r\nnot the best proportion for the requirements of crops.\r\n\r\n3. That the form in which a portion of these ingredients--nitrogen and\r\nphosphoric acid--is present is not of the most valuable kind.\r\n\r\nIt is consequently not as a direct chemical manure that farmyard manure\r\nis pre-eminently valuable. We must seek for perhaps its most valuable\r\nproperties in its indirect influence.\r\n\r\nIt adds to the soil a large quantity of organic matter. Most soils are\r\nimproved by the addition of _humus_. The water-absorbing and retaining\r\npowers of a soil are increased by this addition of _humus_, while it\r\nenables the soil to attract an increased amount of moisture from the\r\nair. This is often of great importance, as in the period of germination\r\nof seed.[177] The influence it exerts on the texture of the soil in the\r\nprocess of fermentation is also very great. This is especially so in\r\nsoils whose texture is too close, such as heavy clayey soils. It opens\r\nup their pores to the air, and renders them more friable. Where such an\r\ninfluence is most required, as in clayey soils, the manure ought to be\r\napplied in a fresh condition, so that the maximum influence exerted by\r\nthe manure in this direction may be experienced. On light soils, on the\r\ncontrary, whose friability and openness are already too great, and which\r\ndo not require to be increased, the manure will be best applied in a\r\nrotten condition. It adds, further, greatly to the heat of the soils by\r\nits decomposition. Thus on cold damp soils it effects one very marked\r\nbenefit. The influence it exerts in its decomposition upon the\r\nfertilising ingredients present in the soil is also by no means\r\ninconsiderable. In the process of its fermentation large quantities of\r\ncarbonic acid gas are generated. This carbonic acid probably acts in a\r\ndouble capacity. It will, in the first place, greatly increase the\r\nsolvent power of the soil-water, and thus enable it to set free an\r\nincreased amount of mineral plant-food; and secondly, it will help to\r\nconserve a certain quantity of the soil-nitrogen, by preventing its\r\nconversion into nitrates.\r\n\r\nAs its indirect and mechanical properties are greatest when in its fresh\r\ncondition, it will be better to apply it in that condition to soils most\r\nlacking in these mechanical properties. We may therefore say that\r\nfarmyard manure is best applied in a rotted condition to light sandy\r\nsoils, and to soils in a high state of cultivation, where its mechanical\r\nproperties are not so much required.\r\n\r\nAn important point still remains to be discussed--viz., the rate at\r\nwhich the farmyard manure should be applied. This, of course, should\r\nnaturally depend on a variety of circumstances--the amount of artificial\r\nmanures used as supplementary to the farmyard manure, the frequency of\r\nits application, and the nature of the soil.\r\n\r\nThese considerations naturally vary so much, that the quantities of\r\nfarmyard manure it is advisable to apply in different cases are widely\r\ndifferent. There is a strong probability that the rate at which farmyard\r\nmanure has been applied in the past has been grossly in excess of what\r\ncould be profitably employed. Opinion is gaining ground among practical\r\nfarmers, that smaller and more frequent applications of farmyard manure\r\nto the soil would be fraught with better results than the older custom\r\nof applying a large dressing at a time. This is an opinion in the\r\nsupport of which science can urge strong arguments. It is only of late\r\nyears that we have come to recognise sufficiently the various risks\r\nwhich all fertilisers are subject to in the soil, and the importance,\r\ntherefore, of minimising these risks as much as possible by putting into\r\nthe soil at one time only as much manure as it is safely able to retain.\r\n\r\n\"The famous old German writer Thaer regarded 17 or 18 tons as an\r\nabundant dressing; 14 tons he called good, and 8 or 9 tons light. Other\r\nGerman authorities speak of 7 to 10 tons as light, 12 to 18 tons as\r\nusual, 20 or more tons as heavy, and 30 tons as a very heavy\r\napplication.\"[178]\r\n\r\nIn the new edition of Stephens' 'Book of the Farm,'[179] from 8 to 12\r\ntons per acre for roots, and from 15 to 20 tons for potatoes, along with\r\nartificials, which may cost from 25s. to 60s. per acre additional, are\r\nquoted as general dressings.\r\n\r\nThe majority of recent experiments with farmyard manure would seem to\r\nindicate that, even in the case of what are considered small dressings,\r\nthe extra return in crop the first year after application is not such as\r\nto cover the expense of the manure. Of course, as is commonly pointed\r\nout, the effect of farmyard manure is of a lasting nature, and is\r\nprobably felt throughout the whole rotation, or even longer. This, to a\r\ncertain extent, is no doubt true; still it may be strongly doubted\r\nwhether farmyard manure is, after all, an economical manure, as compared\r\nwith artificial manures. The desirability of manuring the soil and not\r\nthe crop is, in this age of keen competition, no longer believed in; and\r\nthe Rothamsted experiments have shown that it is highly doubtful whether\r\neven the soil benefits to anything like a commensurate extent by the\r\napplication of large quantities of farmyard manure. This is of course\r\nassuming for farmyard manure the value that it would fetch when sold,\r\nor, to put it rather differently, the price it would cost if the farmer\r\nhad to purchase it. Farmyard manure is a necessary bye-product of the\r\nfarm, and can scarcely be regarded, therefore, in the same light as the\r\nartificial manures which the farmer buys.[180]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[131] See Appendix, Note I., p. 279.\r\n\r\n[132] \"The large amount of potash in unwashed wool is very remarkable: a\r\nfleece must sometimes contain more potash than the whole body of the\r\nshorn sheep.\"--Warington's 'Chemistry of the Farm,' p. 78.\r\n\r\n[133] See Appendix, Note II., p. 279.\r\n\r\n[134] The urine of the pig, from the nature of its food, is, as a\r\ngeneral rule, a very poor nitrogenous manure.\r\n\r\n[135] See Appendix, Note XV., p. 290.\r\n\r\n[136] See Appendix, Note III., p. 280.\r\n\r\n[137] See Appendix, Note XVIII., p. 291.\r\n\r\n[138] The nitrogen present in the urine, it may be well to point out, is\r\nderived from the waste of nitrogenous tissue as well as from nitrogenous\r\nmatter of the food digested.\r\n\r\n[139] Note IV., p. 281.\r\n\r\n[140] Warington puts this matter admirably in the following words: \"If\r\nthe food is nitrogenous and easily digested, the nitrogen in the urine\r\nwill greatly preponderate.

In Boussingault's\r\nexperiments the food consisted of 15 lb. _hay_, 4.54 lb. _oats_, and 32\r\nlb. water; the total excrements amounting to 31.16 lb., containing 7.42\r\nlb. dry matter. In Hofmeister's experiments the food consisted of 5.23\r\nlb. _hay_, 6.18 lb. _oats_, 1 lb. _chopped straw_, and 25.57 lb. water;\r\nthe excrements amounting to 25.07 lb., containing 5.32 lb. dry matter.\r\n\r\n[152] This is taking no account of the amount of water which the manure\r\nwill absorb, and which will probably double the quantity.\r\n\r\n[153] See Appendix, Note IX., p. 283.\r\n\r\n[154] The rapid fermentation of horse-manure is due to its mechanical as\r\nwell as its chemical nature.

See Heiden's 'Duengerlehre,' vol. i. p. 99.\r\n\r\n[162] See Storer, 'Agricultural Chemistry,' vol. ii. p. 96.\r\n\r\nA question of great importance is as to the amount of farmyard manure\r\nproduced on a farm in a year, and its value. This is a question which is\r\nextremely difficult to satisfactorily deal with. Various methods of\r\ncalculating this amount have been resorted to. It may be well to state\r\nthese pretty fully. Some practical authorities estimate the amount by\r\ncalculating that every ton of straw should produce 4 tons of manure.\r\nAnother method consists in estimating the amount from the size of the\r\nfarm. Sir John Lawes has calculated the composition of farmyard manure\r\nwhich should be produced in the case of a farm of 400 acres, farmed on\r\nthe four-course system. He assumes that half of the roots and 100 tons\r\nof hay are consumed at the homestead; that the whole of the straw of the\r\ncorn crops is retained at home as food and litter; that twelve horses\r\nhave corn equal to 10 lb. of oats per head per day; and that about ten\r\nshillings per acre are expended in the purchase of cake for feeding\r\nstock. Under these conditions the amount of farmyard manure should be\r\n855 tons (or an average of 8-1/2 tons for each of the 100 acres of\r\nroot-crop) of _fresh undecomposed dung_. (For composition, see Appendix,\r\nNote XVII., p. 291.) Another method is by taking, as the data of\r\ncalculation, the number of cattle, horses, sheep, &c., producing the\r\nmanure. Lloyd considers that a fattening animal requires 3 tons of straw\r\nin the year, and makes about 12 tons of manure. A farmer, therefore,\r\nshould make 8 tons of manure for every acre of that part of his land\r\nwhich, in the four-course rotation, is put down to turnips.\r\n\r\nThe last method consists in taking as the data the amount of food\r\nconsumed and litter used in the production of the manure. Of these\r\nmethods Heiden considers the last as alone satisfactory and trustworthy.\r\nApplying this method to the horse, he shows, from experiments, that a\r\nlittle over 47 per cent of the dry matter of its food has been proved to\r\nbe voided in the solid and liquid excreta. Taking the average percentage\r\nof water in the excreta as about 77.5, the percentage of dry matter in\r\nthe excreta will be 22.5. That is, every pound of dry matter in the food\r\neaten by the horse yields a little over 2 lb. of excrementitious matter.\r\nTo this of course must be added the amount of straw used as litter,\r\nwhich may be taken at 6.5 lb.\r\n\r\nFrom these data we may calculate the amount of manure produced in a year\r\nby a horse, making certain assumptions as to the amount of work\r\nperformed. This Heiden does by assuming that a horse works 260 days, of\r\ntwelve hours each, in the course of a year, or 130 whole days, spending\r\n235 days in the stall. Calculating from the above data, he estimates\r\nthat a well-fed working horse will produce about 50 lb. of manure in a\r\nday, or 6.5 tons in a year. Of course this does not necessarily\r\nrepresent all the manure actually produced by the horse, but how much of\r\nthe remaining portion of the manure actually finds its way to the farm\r\nit is impossible to say. According to the 'Book of the Farm,' Division\r\nIII. p. 98, a farm-horse makes about 12 tons of manure in a year.\r\n\r\nIt has been calculated that cows void about 48 per cent of the dry\r\nmatter of their food in the solid and liquid excreta, which contain of\r\nwater, on an average, 87.5 per cent. That is, every pound of dry matter\r\nwill furnish 3.84 lb. of total excreta. By adding the necessary amount\r\nof straw for litter (which may be taken at one-third the weight of the\r\ndry matter of the fodder), Heiden calculates that an ox weighing 1000\r\nlb. should produce 113 lb. of manure in a day, or 20 tons in a year. The\r\n'Book of the Farm,' Division III. p. 98, gives the annual amount at from\r\n10 to 14 tons. According to Wolff, one may assume that on an average the\r\nfresh excrements (both liquid and solid) of the common farm animals\r\n(with the exception of the pig) contain of every 100 lb. of dry matter\r\nin the food consumed about 50 lb., or a half. Estimating the dry matter\r\nin the litter used at equal to about 1/4 of the dry matter of the food,\r\nthis would mean that for every 100 lb. of dry matter consumed in food\r\nthere would be 75 lb. of dry manure (viz., 50 lb. dry excrements + 25\r\nlb. dry litter), which would yield 300 lb. of farmyard manure in the wet\r\nstate--_i.e._, with 75 per cent water. The amount of food daily required\r\nper every 1000 lb. of live-weight of the common farm animals may be\r\ntaken, roughly speaking, at 24 lb. dry food material and 6 lb. of straw\r\nas litter. The daily production of manure for 1000 lb. of live-weight\r\nwould amount, therefore, to 18 lb. of dry, or 72 lb. wet manure. (See\r\nAppendix, Note XVII., p. 291.) According to J. C. Morton and Evershed,\r\noxen feeding in boxes require 20 lb. of straw per head per day as\r\nlitter. An ox, therefore, will make 8 tons of fresh dung in six months,\r\nusing 32 cwt. of litter. This means that each ton of litter gives 5 tons\r\nof fresh dung. It is calculated that nearly twice as much litter must be\r\nused in open yards.\r\n\r\n[163] It has been calculated that under ordinary circumstances\r\nsheep-dung, when allowed to ferment by itself, should do so in about\r\nfour months, horse-dung in six months, and cow-dung in eight months.\r\n\r\n[164] See Appendix, Note XII., p. 286.\r\n\r\n[165] See Heiden's 'Duengerlehre,' vol. ii. p. 156.\r\n\r\n[166] Warington, 'Chemistry of the Farm,' p. 33.\r\n\r\n[167] Recent experiments by Muentz and Girard in France have shown that\r\nthe loss in sheep excreta from volatilisation of the carbonate of\r\nammonia amounted to over 50 per cent. By the use of straw litter this\r\nwas reduced to about a half less, and with earth litter one quarter\r\nless.\r\n\r\n[168] See Appendix, Note XIII., p. 288.\r\n\r\n[169] See Appendix, Note XIV., p. 289.\r\n\r\n[170] See Appendix, Note XV., p. 290.\r\n\r\n[171] For spring application rotten farmyard manure is generally used,\r\nbecause in this condition its fertilising matter is more quickly\r\navailable. On light land it is best to apply it in the rotten condition\r\nshortly before it is likely to be used. (See p. 261.)\r\n\r\n[172] The total amount of plant-food in a ton of farmyard manure is\r\ntogether less than 1/20th of its total weight.\r\n\r\n[173] See Heiden's 'Duengerlehre,' vol. ii. p. 171.\r\n\r\n[174] For full details see Appendix, Note XVI., p. 290.\r\n\r\n[175] Storer reproduces these results in his 'Agricultural Chemistry,'\r\nvol. ii. p. 21.\r\n\r\n[176] This aspect of farmyard manure has been ably stated by Mr F. J.\r\nCooke, a well-known Norfolk farmer. In commenting on the results of the\r\nRothamsted experiments, he says: \"It is clear enough that the faith of\r\nthe farmer in the soil-enriching character of his home-made manure is\r\namply justified; the only question being, indeed, if this quality be not\r\ntoo highly appreciated. It is not, after all, so much by the fattening\r\nof our land as by the bounty of the crop grown upon it that we reap the\r\nfruit of our exertions. The man of scientific mind keeps his purpose\r\nfixed on the _production of good crops_ mainly, and the cheapest way to\r\ngrow them. The experiments under consideration show that richness of\r\nland may be purchased much too dearly, and that richness of crop by no\r\nmeans bears the necessary relation to richness of soil which has\r\nsometimes been imagined. We may boast of the 'lasting qualities' of our\r\ndung, but the answer of science by these experiments is, that so great\r\nis the last that the life of one man may not be long enough to exhaust\r\nit. In the extravagant use of dung, therefore, such considerations,\r\namongst many others, as length of purse, as well as length and character\r\nof tenure, must clearly be taken into account.\"\r\n\r\n[177] See paper on \"Manurial Experiments with Turnips\" by author, in\r\n'Transactions of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland;'\r\n1891.\r\n\r\n[178] Storer's 'Agricultural Chemistry,' vol. i. p. 498.\r\n\r\n[179] Division III. p. 130.\r\n\r\n[180] Mr F. J. Cooke, who has already been quoted, has kindly furnished\r\nthe author with his views on the peculiar functions of farmyard manure\r\nas a manure. He says: \"I look upon it, broadly speaking, as chiefly of\r\nvalue in restoring to good land, after cropping, those particular\r\nadvantages which good land alone can give, and in helping better than\r\nany other manure, when applied to poor land, to bring it up to the level\r\nof good land in those particular merits which belong alone to fine\r\nsoils. I speak now of an inherent value in good soils, beyond that\r\nattaching to them as mere reservoirs of abundant plant-food. For\r\ninstance, one may supply a poor soil by artificial manure with much more\r\nfood--and in a highly soluble condition--than is needed by the crop to\r\nbe grown upon it, and yet not get so good a crop as upon a naturally\r\nricher but otherwise similar soil less abundantly filled with\r\nimmediately available food. This may arise from a more perfect\r\ndistribution of the plant-food in the rich soil, or from the steady way\r\nin which it becomes available to the crop, as well as for other reasons.\r\nBut whatever the cause, there, I think, is the broad fact of the power\r\nof farmyard manure to enrich poor soils, so to speak, more\r\nnaturally--that is, in a way which makes them more nearly correspond to\r\nbetter soils than artificial manures can.\"\r\n\r\nHence the indirect benefit to the farmer from farmyard manure is\r\nprobably greater than its direct value as a mere manure. And the usual\r\nprovision and use of it amongst all straw-growing farmers is\r\nsufficiently justified. The extent, however, to which that course may be\r\nbeneficially carried, is one of the most important of the many difficult\r\neconomic and scientific problems which the farmer has to face.\r\n\r\nOn the economic side must of course be considered the cost of\r\nmanufacture in individual instances, as ruled by the market value of the\r\nstraw, and the different circumstances and conditions under which the\r\nvarious farm animals are kept and fed (I have the figures by me of one\r\nwell-known farmer, which show the cost to him of every ton of home-made\r\nmanure to be 20s. or more); the price the resultant crops may be\r\nexpected to command; the cost at the moment of artificial manures, &c.,\r\n&c. Whilst on the scientific side must be considered the nature of the\r\nsoil, the particular rotation of crops, &c.\r\n\r\nIt was, amongst others, just these scientific and yet very definite and\r\npractical problems we have tried to throw light on in the series of\r\nfield experiments conducted for several years by the Norfolk Chamber of\r\nAgriculture. (See reprint of summary of same in last year's Report of\r\nthe Board of Agriculture.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE I. (p. 225).\r\n\r\nDIFFERENCE IN AMOUNT OF EXCRETA VOIDED FOR FOOD CONSUMED.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the difference in the composition of the solid excreta\r\nvoided by different fattening animals fed on the same amount of food,\r\nsee Warington's 'Chemistry of the Farm,' p. 125, where it is shown that\r\nfor equal amount of live-weight, the sheep produces on the same weight\r\nof dry food very much more manure than the pig, while the ox produces\r\neven more than the sheep. Of course this does not refer to the total\r\namount of manure produced by the different animals, but only to the\r\namount of manure produced from the consumption of equal quantities of\r\nfood. This would seem to be owing to the greater capacity the pig has\r\nfor assimilating its food.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE II.

(p. 234).\r\n\r\nPIG EXCREMENTS.\r\n\r\nThe excrements voided by pigs are poor in manurial constituents, because\r\nthe food on which they are fed is generally of a very poor nature. In\r\ntheir case the urine is always very much richer in manurial ingredients\r\nthan the solid excreta. The relative composition of the solid excreta\r\nand the urine will be best illustrated by quoting some experiments\r\ncarried out by Wolff on this subject. The experiments were carried out\r\nwith two pigs nine and a half months old, and each 121.9 kilogrammes (a\r\nkilogramme is equal to about 2-1/4 lb.) in weight. The first consumed\r\ndaily 1000 grammes of barley, 5000 grammes of potatoes, and 2572 grammes\r\nof sour-milk. The second one consumed the same quantities of potatoes\r\nand sour-milk as the first, and 1000 grammes of peas. The following\r\ntable gives the results of excreta and urine daily voided, in grammes:--\r\n\r\n                 Dry      Nitrogen. Ash. Potash. Lime. Magnesia.

The statements in the\r\ndifferent text-books as to the quantity of manure produced by the horse\r\nare such as naturally to perplex the student. This discrepancy is due,\r\nhowever, to the different methods adopted by different writers of\r\ncalculating this amount. The subject is further discussed in the\r\nfootnote to p. 252.

(p. 247).\r\n\r\nTHE NATURE OF THE CHEMICAL REACTIONS OF AMMONIA \"FIXERS.\"\r\n\r\nFor the student, the exact nature of the chemical reactions taking place\r\nmay be of interest.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it must be distinctly understood that the form in\r\nwhich ammonia escapes from the manure-heap is not, as is so commonly\r\nerroneously stated in agricultural text-books, as \"free\" ammonia.\r\nWhenever ammonia is brought into contact with carbonic acid, carbonate\r\nof ammonia is formed. When it is remembered that carbonic acid is by far\r\nthe most abundant of the gaseous products of the decomposition of\r\norganic matter, it will be at once seen that free ammonia could not\r\nexist under such circumstances.\r\n\r\n1. In the case of _hydrochloric acid_, the following chemical equation\r\nwill represent the nature of the reaction--\r\n\r\n2HCl          + (NH_{4})_{2}CO_{3}      = 2NH_{4}Cl      + H_{2}O+CO_{2}\r\n(Hydrochloric   (carbonate of ammonia,)   (sal-ammoniac,)  (carbonic acid.)\r\n acid,)\r\n\r\n2. In the case of _sulphuric acid_, the equation will be--\r\n\r\nH_{2}SO_{4} + (NH_{4})_{2}CO_{3} = (NH_{4})_{2}SO_{4}    + H_{2}O+CO_{2}\r\n(Sulphuric    (carbonate of        (sulphate of ammonia,)  (carbonic acid.)\r\n acid,)        ammonia,)\r\n\r\n3. With _gypsum_ (CaSO_{4})--\r\n\r\nCaSO_{4}  + (NH_{4})_{2}CO_{3} = CaCO_{3}     +  (NH_{4})_{2}SO_{4}\r\n(Gypsum,)   (carbonate of        (calcium        (sulphate of ammonia.)\r\n             ammonia,)            carbonate,)\r\n\r\n4. With _copperas_ (FeSO_{4})--\r\n\r\nFeSO_{4}     + (NH_{4})_{2}CO_{3} = FeCO_{3}    + (NH_{4})_{2}SO_{4}\r\n(Sulphate of   (carbonate of        (ferrous      (sulphate of ammonia.)\r\niron,)          ammonia,)            carbonate,)\r\n\r\n5. With _sulphate of magnesia_ (MgSO_{4})--\r\n\r\nMgSO_{4}     + (NH_{4})_{2}CO_{3} = MgCO_{3}      + (NH_{4})_{2}SO_{4}\r\n(Sulphate of   (carbonate of        (carbonate of   (sulphate of\r\n magnesia,)     ammonia,)            magnesia,)      ammonia.)\r\n\r\nReference has been made to the fact that magnesium sulphate may probably\r\nnot only fix the ammonia, but the phosphoric acid. When magnesium\r\nsulphate, soluble phosphoric acid, and ammonia are brought in contact\r\nwith one another, the double insoluble phosphate of ammonium and\r\nmagnesium (MgNH_{4}PO_{4}6Aq) is formed. While such a reaction is\r\npossible, it is highly improbable that it takes place to any extent. The\r\ndouble phosphate is a crystalline salt which only separates after a\r\nconsiderable time, and in the presence of a large excess of ammonia.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE XI.

These two constituents of the manure\r\nare complementary to one another, and the value of farmyard manure as a\r\ngeneral manure is very much impaired if the liquid portion is not\r\napplied along with the solid. In one important respect do the drainings\r\nof manure-heaps differ from urine--that is, in the percentage of\r\nphosphates they contain, the latter being practically devoid of\r\nphosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nThe following is an analysis of drainings from a manure-heap (Wolff):--\r\n\r\nDry substance           18.0  |  Magnesia                 0.4\r\nAsh                     10.7  |  _Phosphoric acid_        0.1\r\nNitrogen                 1.5  |  Sulphuric acid           0.7\r\nPotash                   4.9  |  Silica                   0.2\r\nLime                     0.3  |\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE XVI.

It is this consideration that\r\nrenders the urine so much more valuable than the solid excreta. In the\r\ncase of a man it has been estimated that the urine voided is fifteen\r\ntimes as much, is twelve times as rich in nitrogen, three times in\r\npotash, and two in phosphoric acid, as the solid excreta (Munro). The\r\nrelation of solid matter in the case of the farm animals is not exactly\r\nsimilar. The urine of the ox is about twice the weight of its solid\r\nexcreta. Both the horse and the sheep, however, void as a rule more\r\nsolid excreta than urine. Munro, in his work on 'Soils and Manures,'\r\ncontrasts the composition of the urine and solid excreta of the\r\ndifferent farm animals by the following statement:--\r\n\r\n         1 ton of urine contains  1 ton of solid excreta\r\n                 in lb.:             contains in lb.:\r\n\r\n            Nitrogen.

This it does mainly on historical grounds, as it is now largely a\r\nmanure of the past. Not merely has it been used in agriculture to an\r\nextent to which no other artificial manure has as yet ever approximated,\r\nbut its influence on agricultural practice has been enormous. Introduced\r\ninto this country about the middle of the present century, it was the\r\nfirst of artificial manures to be used in large quantities.[183] It may\r\nbe thus described as having introduced the modern system of _intensive_\r\ncultivation, and given rise to the now almost universal practice of\r\nartificial manuring.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Influence on British Farming._\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, difficult to over-estimate the important influence which\r\nthe introduction of this most valuable fertiliser has exercised on\r\nBritish as well as, to a large extent, on European husbandry. Before its\r\nintroduction the farmer was almost completely dependent on his farmyard\r\nmanure. He was tied down to a great extent, by the exigencies of the\r\nthen prevailing agricultural customs, to certain rotations of crops. He\r\ncould do little in the way of enriching barren soils or of ensuring a\r\nheavy yield of crop. By the use of this very potent fertiliser, he\r\nquickly discovered that the most wonderful results ensued--results which\r\nmust have seemed to him at first little short of miraculous. He found\r\nthat by the application of a few hundredweights per acre, poor soils\r\ncould be made to yield large returns, and that barren patches in a field\r\ncould be brought up to the average of the surrounding portions by\r\nsprinkling merely a few handfuls of it; that by its means a good start\r\ncould be ensured to every crop, and one slow of coming away could be\r\nhastened on. In short, in this wonderful brown powder, with such a\r\ncharacteristic odour, the astonished farmer discovered a manure which,\r\nfor the speed of its action, and for the increase of crop it gave,\r\ncompletely threw into the shade both farmyard manure and bones. What\r\nwonder, then, that its fame as a manure should have become so quickly\r\nknown and its use so extensive! It thus gave a most powerful impetus to\r\nintelligent farming by bringing home to the minds of those who used it\r\nthe important position nitrogen and phosphates occupied as constituents\r\nof the soil, and the influence they exercised on plant-growth. It\r\nfurnished, in fact, on an enormously large scale, a practical\r\ndemonstration of the principles of manuring. The educational value which\r\nthe use of guano thus exercised may be said to have been very great. It\r\nalso led the way to the use of the various artificial manures so much\r\nused during the last fifty years. Impressed by the value of guano,\r\nfarmers were favourably disposed towards the use of other fertilisers;\r\nand, largely owing to its widespread popularity, the new practice\r\nspeedily gained ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Influence not wholly for Good._\r\n\r\nBut its influence, it must be admitted, was not wholly for good. In its\r\nvery popularity lay the danger of its abuse. Had its value and the\r\nmethod of its action been more widely understood, and had the principles\r\nupon which the practice of artificial manuring depends been better\r\nrealised, agriculturists would have been spared much of the needless\r\npecuniary losses they sustained by being imposed upon by unscrupulous\r\nmanure-dealers. Among the farming community the word guano soon became a\r\nname to conjure with, and under this title many spurious and worthless\r\nmanures were attempted to be palmed off on the unwary farmer. Even the\r\ngenuine article, there can be little doubt, was at one time largely\r\nadulterated; and as the farmer was almost invariably content to purchase\r\nthe article not on any guaranteed chemical analysis, but simply on the\r\nground of its appearance, colour, and more especially smell, every\r\nfacility was given for the successful perpetration of such fraudulent\r\nimposition. Guano, it was very soon found, varied in its composition,\r\nbut this variation in quality the farmer did not recognise. In the early\r\ndays of its use all guano was in his eyes of the same value. Too often,\r\nas we have just pointed out, provided it had a good colour and a strong\r\nodour, it was all right. Under such conditions, it can scarcely be\r\nwondered at that its introduction should have proved not an unmixed\r\nblessing to agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Its Value as a Manure._\r\n\r\nGuano derives its value as a manure from the nitrogen, phosphates, and\r\nthe small amount of potash it contains. This at any rate is true of the\r\ngreat bulk of guano which has been used in the past. There are, as we\r\nshall immediately see, certain kinds of guano, known as phosphatic\r\nguanos, which only contain phosphates. The amount of such purely\r\nphosphatic guano directly used as a manure in this country is, however,\r\ninconsiderable, and guano may truly be described as owing its value\r\nchiefly to its nitrogen. Not a little of its value and popularity as a\r\nmanure may be said to be due to the fact that it contains all of the\r\nthree important manurial constituents, and that in this respect it may\r\nbe regarded in a sense as a _general_ manure, thus resembling most\r\nnearly, of all artificial manures, farmyard manure. Although its sources\r\nare now, to a very large extent, exhausted, and its total annual imports\r\ninto this country are at present considerably less than what they were\r\nthirty or forty years ago,[184] it may be well, on account of its\r\nhistorical importance, to give a somewhat detailed account of its\r\norigin, occurrence, and value as a manure.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Origin and Occurrence._\r\n\r\nGuano (which means _dung_)--or huano, as it is spelt in the Spanish\r\nlanguage--was first used in Peru. It seems to have been used there long\r\nbefore that country was discovered by the Spaniards--probably as early\r\nas the twelfth century. Regarding its origin there can be little doubt.\r\nIt is almost entirely derived from the excrements of sea-birds, such as\r\npelicans, penguins, and gulls, as well as from the remains of the birds\r\nthemselves, and of seals, walruses, and various other animals.[185]\r\nUnder the influence of a tropical sun, and in a region in which rain\r\nscarcely ever falls, these excrements are soon dried, and remain little\r\nchanged in their composition through centuries. Many of the Peruvian\r\ndeposits must be extremely old, as they are covered up with sand and\r\nother _debris_, and are of considerable depth. Especially is this the\r\ncase with deposits occurring on the mainland, such as those at Pabellon\r\nde Pica, where the layer of sand or conglomerate covering up the deposit\r\nvaries in depth from a few feet to over a hundred. The effect of this\r\nsuperficial covering has been to protect the guano, to a certain extent,\r\nfrom loss of nitrogen.\r\n\r\nAlthough guano of the best class has been derived from the neighbourhood\r\nof Peru, deposits have also been found in many other parts of the\r\nworld--viz., in North America, West Indies, Australia, Asia, Africa, and\r\namong the islands of the Pacific.[186]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Variation in the Composition of different Guanos._\r\n\r\nThe guano found in these different deposits varies very considerably in\r\ncomposition. This is due to the difference in the nature of the\r\nprevailing climate of the places where these deposits occur. Where the\r\nclimate is dry and warm, as is the case in Chili and Peru, the\r\nexcrements dry quickly and remain very little changed, as one very\r\nimportant condition of fermentation--viz., moisture--is absent.[187] In\r\na damp climate, on the other hand, speedy fermentation ensues, resulting\r\nin the loss of nearly all the organic matter, including nitrogen, in\r\nsuch volatile forms as carbonate of ammonia, carbonic acid gas, water,\r\n&c. The soluble alkalies, the most important of which is potash, as well\r\nas the soluble phosphates, are also, under such conditions, lost to the\r\nguano by being washed out by the rain. We have thus a wide difference in\r\nthe quality of the different deposits, depending on the extent to which\r\ndecomposition has taken place. Guano thus ranges from the rich\r\nnitrogenous Peruvian kind, which has undergone little or no change from\r\nthe time of its deposit, to the purely phosphatic kind (such as those of\r\nMalden and Baker islands), in which everything of manurial value has\r\nbeen lost except the insoluble phosphate of lime. Even among the\r\nnitrogenous guanos we find a considerable difference in quality, some\r\ndeposits being partially impoverished by the action of the atmospheric\r\nmoisture, dew, spray or sea-water, but still containing a considerable\r\nproportion of their nitrogen. Other deposits, again, are largely admixed\r\nwith sand, which has been blown in upon them to such an extent as to\r\nmake them unsaleable. We can divide guano, therefore, into two great\r\nclasses--viz., _nitrogenous_ and _phosphatic_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--NITROGENOUS GUANOS.\r\n\r\n(_a_) PERUVIAN.\r\n\r\nBy far the most valuable and abundant deposits as yet discovered have\r\nbeen those on the Peruvian and Chilian coasts. As already pointed out,\r\nguano seems to have been used in this country from a very early period;\r\nand so impressed were the Incas with its importance as a manure, that\r\nthe penalty of death was imposed on any one guilty of killing the\r\nsea-fowl during the breeding season in the vicinity of the deposits.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of guano in Peru seems first to have been made known in\r\nEurope in the beginning of the eighteenth century. It was not, however,\r\ntill the beginning of the present century--viz., 1804--that A. Humboldt,\r\nthe great German traveller, brought some of the wonderful fertiliser\r\nhome with him, and that its composition was able to be investigated by\r\nchemical analysis. Shortly afterwards, its practical value was\r\ndemonstrated by experiments carried out on potatoes by General Beatson\r\nin St Helena. To Lord Derby is due the credit of having first introduced\r\nit into this country, the earliest importation into Liverpool being in\r\n1840. Experiments were shortly afterwards instituted in different parts\r\nof the country, prominent among which were those by Sir John Lawes and\r\nSir James Caird; and so striking were the results obtained, that the\r\nmanure rapidly found favour with the farming community--so much so, that\r\nten years later the importations into this country amounted to no less\r\nthan 200,000 tons, while in 1855 the total exports from the west coast\r\nof South America reached the enormous amount of 400,000 tons. In all, it\r\nhas been estimated that since the year 1840 over 5,000,000 tons of\r\nPeruvian guano have been imported into this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Different Deposits._\r\n\r\nPeruvian guano has been derived from various deposits occurring in\r\ndifferent parts of the coast, and from a number of small adjacent\r\nislands. The richest of these was that found on Angamos, a rocky\r\npromontory on the coast of Bolivia. Samples of this guano contained as\r\nhigh as 20 per cent of nitrogen (equal to 24 per cent ammonia).[188]\r\nUnfortunately, however, the quantity of this deposit was extremely\r\nlimited, and became rapidly exhausted. Next to this deposit in quality\r\nwas the guano found on the Chincha islands, three little islands off the\r\ncoast of Peru. These deposits were the largest which have ever been\r\ndiscovered, and for a period of nearly thirty years were almost the sole\r\nsource of the Peruvian guano sold in commerce, over 10,000,000 tons\r\nhaving been exported from them alone. Some of this guano contained 14\r\nper cent of nitrogen (equal to 17 per cent ammonia); and although part\r\nof the guano shipped from these islands was not quite so rich, yet it\r\nwas all of a high-class order. The deposits on these islands were in\r\nmany cases 100 to 200 feet in depth, and rested on rocks of granite. The\r\nlower layers were consequently found to be poorer in quality, and mixed\r\nwith pieces of granite. The Chincha island deposits have been long\r\nexhausted,[189] and the chief deposits of Peruvian guano since worked\r\nhave been those on Guanape and Macabi islands--a considerably inferior\r\nguano, containing only 9 to 11 per cent of nitrogen (equal to 11 to 13\r\nper cent of ammonia)--which in their turn have become exhausted; from\r\nBallestas, almost as rich as the Chincha island guano, also now\r\nexhausted; and from Pabellon de Pica, Punta de Lobos, Huanillos,\r\nIndependence Bay, and Lobos de Afuera. Quite recently a deposit of very\r\nhigh-class guano was discovered in Corcovado, and a good many cargoes\r\nhave already been shipped to this country. It is found to contain\r\nnitrogen equal to from 10 to 13 per cent ammonia, 30 to 35 per cent\r\nphosphates, and some potash, being thus a most valuable guano.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Appearance, Colour, and Nature._\r\n\r\nIn colour it varies from a very light to a very dark brown, the richer\r\nsamples being generally lighter. Samples taken from even the same\r\ndeposit have been found to differ very considerably in appearance, those\r\ntaken from the lower and older layers being usually darker than those\r\ntaken from the more recent upper layers. It was soon found also to vary\r\nvery much in composition. After a deposit had been worked for some time,\r\nthe quality of guano it yielded was found to be inferior and coarser,\r\nand in many cases mixed with pebbles or pieces of granite, porphyry, &c.\r\nThis led to the custom of screening it on arrival in this country,\r\nbefore it was used as a manure. In the richer qualities--_e.g._, in the\r\nChincha guano--little round concretionary nodules, varying in colour\r\nfrom pure white to dark brown, were occasionally found. Analysis showed\r\nthese nodules[190] to be composed chiefly of potash salts. Sometimes,\r\nalso, little crystals of almost pure ammonia salts were found. It soon\r\nbecame customary, therefore, to prepare guano for the market by\r\nseparating the stones and reducing the whole to a fine uniform powder.\r\nOne of its most characteristic properties, and the one which seems to\r\nhave impressed the public most, was its pungent odour. Undue importance\r\nwas attached to this property, in the belief that it was caused by the\r\nammonia it contained. It may be doubted, however, whether the\r\ncharacteristic smell of guano is due so much to its ammonia as to\r\ncertain fatty acids.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition._\r\n\r\nIn composition it is of a most complex nature. It contains its nitrogen\r\nin a great variety of forms, the chief of these being urate, oxalate,\r\nulmate, humate, sulphate, phosphate, carbonate, and muriate of ammonia;\r\nand also in a rare form of organic nitrogen peculiar to guano, called\r\nguanine. According to Boussingault, some guanos contain small quantities\r\nof nitrates. Its phosphoric acid is present both in the soluble\r\nstate--viz., as phosphates of the alkalies (ammonia and potash)--and in\r\nthe insoluble state as phosphate of lime; and lastly, its potash is\r\npresent as sulphate and phosphate. The proportion in which these\r\ndifferent forms of nitrogen and phosphoric acid are present varies\r\nconsiderably in different samples. The richer a sample, as a rule, the\r\nmore nitrogen in the form of uric acid it contains. The most of the\r\nnitrogen is present as uric acid and ammonia. Damp guanos contain more\r\nof their nitrogen as ammonia than dry ones, this being due to the\r\nfermentation which goes on in the former. On an average, about a third\r\nof its total nitrogen is soluble in water. Of its phosphates, on the\r\nother hand, only about a fourth are soluble in water.\r\n\r\nThe following analyses of a sample of Chincha island guano by\r\nKarmrodt[191] will illustrate this.

Fahr.):--\r\n\r\n1. _Constituents easily soluble in Water._\r\n\r\nUrate of ammonium                                  12.74\r\nOxalate of ammonium                                13.60\r\nNitrogenous and sulphurous organic substances       3.61\r\nAmmonium-magnesium phosphate                        4.00\r\nAmmonium phosphate                                   .90\r\nAmmonium sulphate                                   1.82\r\nAmmonium chloride                                   1.55\r\nPotassium sulphate                                  3.30\r\nSodium chloride                                     2.44\r\n                                                   -----\r\n                                                   43.96\r\n                                                   -----\r\n\r\n2. _Difficultly soluble in Water, soluble in Acids,\r\nAlcohol, and Ether._\r\n\r\nUric acid                                          21.14\r\nResin                                               1.11\r\nFatty acids                                         1.60\r\nNitrogenous and sulphurous organic substances       2.29\r\nCalcium phosphate                                  18.22\r\nPhosphate of iron                                   1.04\r\nSilica                                               .64\r\n                                                   -----\r\n                                                   46.04\r\n                                                   -----\r\n\r\nIn the above analysis it will be noticed that none of the ammonia is\r\npresent as carbonate. In most samples, however, of Peruvian guano, the\r\nammonia in this form amounted to from 1 to 2 per cent. In the inferior\r\nqualities, chiefly those which had been subjected to the action of\r\nwater, and consequently of fermentation, to a certain extent, this form\r\nof ammonia was found to be most abundant. Such guanos were most liable\r\nto loss of nitrogen by volatilisation.\r\n\r\nThe older Peruvian guano contained as high as 14 per cent of nitrogen\r\n(equal to 17 per cent of ammonia), and of phosphoric acid 12 to 14 per\r\ncent (equal to 26 to 28 per cent of phosphate of lime). It, however,\r\ngradually deteriorated in quality as the deposits became worked out, the\r\npercentage of nitrogen becoming year by year less, until latterly\r\nPeruvian guano, as imported, contains only from 3 to 4 per cent of\r\nnitrogen (equal to 4 to 5 per cent of ammonia). This guano is, however,\r\nricher in phosphates, containing often 50 to 60 per cent of phosphate of\r\nlime, and 3 to 4 per cent of potash.[192]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) OTHER NITROGENOUS GUANOS.\r\n\r\nThe guanos, other than those which come from Peru, are chiefly purely\r\nphosphatic guanos, so that the term Peruvian has not unfrequently in the\r\npast been used as a generic term synonymous with the term nitrogenous,\r\nand consequently applied to all nitrogenous guanos independent of their\r\nsource. There are, however, a few deposits other than the Peruvian\r\nwhich have yielded considerable quantities of valuable nitrogenous\r\nguano. Of those, the richest in quality--in fact, the richest of any\r\ndeposits hitherto discovered--was the Angamos guano, which came from a\r\nrocky promontory on the coast of Bolivia. The few samples of this which\r\nhave been analysed showed over 20 per cent of nitrogen. Unfortunately,\r\nthe deposit proved to be comparatively insignificant in amount, and has\r\nlong been exhausted.\r\n\r\nPoorer in quality, but more abundant in quantity, were the deposits\r\nfound on the Ichaboe and other islands off the south-west coast of\r\nAfrica. These deposits were discovered shortly after the introduction of\r\nPeruvian guano, and for a few years supplied considerable quantities of\r\nvaluable manure. The deposits first discovered were soon exhausted, so\r\nthat for a number of years Ichaboe guano ceased to be procurable. Fresh\r\ndeposits, however, were subsequently found, and considerable quantities\r\nhave of late years been used in agriculture.[193] Ichaboe guano is\r\ninferior in value to Peruvian. It exemplifies the influence of small\r\nquantities of rain on guano deposits in impoverishing them in their\r\nnitrogen. In much of the Ichaboe guano imported into this country a\r\nlarge amount of feathers is found. It also contains an abnormally large\r\nquantity of insoluble matter.\r\n\r\nAmong the other nitrogenous guanos may be mentioned the Patagonian,\r\nFalkland, and Saldanha Bay. They are, like the Ichaboa, of comparatively\r\nrecent origin, and are collected in small quantities after the breeding\r\nseason every year.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--PHOSPHATIC GUANOS.\r\n\r\nPhosphatic guanos, as already pointed out, are similar in origin to\r\nnitrogenous guanos. In their case, however, the nitrogen, alkalies, and\r\nsoluble phosphates which they originally contained have been almost\r\nentirely lost by the decomposition of their organic matter and the\r\naction of water.[194] Most of them still contain very small quantities\r\nof nitrogen, amounting to a fraction of a per cent. Of these deposits\r\nthere are very many occurring on islands in different parts of the\r\nworld. In appearance the guano obtained from them is very different from\r\nnitrogenous guano, being much lighter in colour, and of a fine powdery\r\nnature. It forms a very rich phosphatic guano, containing in many cases\r\nbetween 70 and 80 per cent of insoluble phosphate of lime. Such guanos\r\nare largely used in the manufacture of high-class superphosphates, by\r\ntreating them with sulphuric acid. Being of an insoluble nature, they\r\nare not very suitable for direct application to the soil. Of these\r\nphosphatic guanos the following are the chief--those marked in italics\r\nbeing still unexhausted:--\r\n\r\n1. _Baker_, Jarvis, Howland, Starbuck, Flint, _Enderbury_, _Malden_,\r\nLacepede, _Browse_, _Huon_, _Chesterfield_, _Sydney_, _Phoenix_,\r\n_Arbrohlos_, _Shark's Bay_, and _Timor_--all found on islands in the\r\nPacific Ocean.\r\n\r\n2. _Mejillones_, on the coast of Bolivia.\r\n\r\n3. Aves, _Tortola_, _Mona_, and other deposits in the West Indies.\r\n\r\n4. _Kuria Muria_ islands, in the Arabian Gulf.\r\n\r\nFor further particulars as to the composition of these different guanos,\r\nthe reader is referred to the Appendix, Note V., p. 329.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Inequality in Composition._\r\n\r\nThat guano was a substance of by no means uniform composition was a fact\r\nearly recognised in the history of the trade. Not only did guano from\r\ndifferent deposits show on analysis different percentages of the\r\nmanurial ingredients, but different samples of guano from the same\r\ndeposit were often found to differ very considerably from one another.\r\nIt soon became the custom, therefore, to sell it on chemical analysis,\r\neach separate cargo being carefully analysed. But this custom did not\r\nwholly obviate the difficulty, as the guano in even one cargo might\r\ndiffer. In the case of the older and richer guanos, there was certainly\r\nmore uniformity in quality, but they were liable to differ in their\r\npercentage of nitrogen.[195] As, however, the deposits became gradually\r\nworked out, their lower layers were found more or less largely admixed\r\nwith stony and earthy matter, and their composition was naturally\r\nrendered very variable. This state of matters was unsatisfactory to\r\nbuyers and sellers, and led to much friction between the two, as it was\r\nfound wellnigh impossible on the part of the seller to guarantee the\r\ncomposition of his manure. The custom of preparing the material by\r\nreducing it to a fine powder before sending it into the market, and the\r\ncustom, subsequently introduced, of treating it with sulphuric acid,\r\nhave done away with this difficulty to a large extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_\"Dissolved\" Guano._\r\n\r\nThe treatment of guano with sulphuric acid was first had recourse to in\r\nthe case of cargoes damaged with water. In such guano, as has been\r\nalready pointed out, fermentation has been permitted to take place, with\r\nthe result of the formation of volatile carbonate of ammonia in greater\r\nor less quantity. By the addition of sulphuric acid the ammonia was\r\nfixed, and the guano was prevented from losing its most valuable\r\nconstituent. It was soon found, however, that guano so treated possessed\r\ngreater activity as a manure. The result of the sulphuric acid was to\r\nincrease very materially the amount of its soluble phosphates, and also\r\nits soluble nitrogen compounds.[196] It had, moreover, the effect of\r\nproducing a guano of uniform composition. The custom, first introduced\r\nin 1864 by Messrs Ohlendorff & Co., was soon largely practised. The\r\nguano is treated with 25 to 30 per cent sulphuric acid (sp. gr. 1.73).\r\nAfter a short time the resulting hard mass is, by means of\r\ndisintegrators, reduced to a uniform powder.\r\n\r\n\r\n_\"Equalised\" or \"Rectified\" Guano._\r\n\r\nAs guano decreased in its quality the demand for a high-class article\r\nbecame more and more difficult to meet. This led to the custom of\r\n\"fortifying\" or \"rectifying\"--as it is variously called--the natural\r\nmaterial with sulphate of ammonia. A manure closely resembling in the\r\npercentage of its manurial constituents the older rich guanos is thus\r\nobtained. Of these so-called \"equalised\" guanos, two qualities are at\r\npresent sold, the first being guaranteed to contain nitrogen equal to 8\r\nto 9 per cent ammonia, 30 to 35 per cent phosphates, and 2 to 3 per cent\r\nof potash; the second quality containing only about half as much\r\nnitrogen, but more phosphates.\r\n\r\nHowever valuable this fortified guano may be--and it is, undoubtedly, a\r\nmost valuable manure--its action cannot be supposed to be exactly\r\nsimilar to the old Peruvian guano, which it resembles in the percentage\r\nof its nitrogen, phosphates, and potash. Much of the distinctive value\r\nof guano as a manure, as will be pointed out immediately, lies in the\r\nfact that it contains its manurial ingredients in a variety of\r\ndifferently soluble compounds, which are gradually rendered available in\r\nthe soil for the plant's needs. This undoubtedly is one of the reasons\r\nwhy the action of guano among manures is quite unique; and there are\r\nother reasons which we probably do not clearly understand. However\r\nskilfully the composition of the guano may be artificially simulated, it\r\nstill remains an undoubted fact that the \"equalised\" guano is not\r\nexactly similar in its action to the genuine article. Nevertheless, that\r\nit is superior in its results to the poorer classes of guano at present\r\navailable, and to ordinary compound manures, there can be little doubt.\r\nA great merit of the equalised guano is, however, that it is sold at a\r\nlower price than guano as imported; and as the guano is sold on a\r\nguaranteed analysis, the practice has done much to advance the true\r\ninterests of agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Its Action as a Manure._\r\n\r\nNext to farmyard manure, guano may be regarded as the most \"general\" of\r\nall the commonly used manures; for in addition to nitrogen, phosphoric\r\nacid, and potash, it contains nearly all the other plant ingredients,\r\nsuch as lime, magnesia, &c. Its special value as a manure, however, does\r\nnot merely consist in the amount of valuable plant-food it contains.\r\nLike farmyard manure, it owes much of its characteristic action to the\r\nstate of the intimate mixture of its manurial constituents, and also, as\r\nhas already been pointed out, to the fact that it contains those\r\nconstituents in a great variety of chemical forms, each of which differs\r\nin its solubility, and consequently availability for the plant's needs.\r\nTake, for example, the great number of different forms of nitrogen it\r\ncontains. Some are in the condition in which plants can immediately\r\nabsorb them, while the rest are in a series of less and less available\r\nforms, which, however, are gradually converted into available forms as\r\nthe plant requires them. Like farmyard manure, again, it may be applied\r\nwith almost equally good results to all kinds of crops and on all kinds\r\nof soils. We have in guano, in short, an admirable example of the value\r\nof applying our manurial ingredients in different forms. That this is no\r\nmere theory is abundantly proved by the large number of different\r\nexperiments which have in the past been carried out with guano, more\r\nespecially the well-known experiments made by Grouven, the German\r\nchemist. In those well-known experiments, guano was tested against a\r\nlarge variety of different fertilisers, and the tests were so arranged\r\nthat in most cases the amounts of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash\r\nwere the same in the other manures used. In short, these experiments\r\nprove in a very striking manner that a manure artificially made up out\r\nof most valuable fertilisers, such as nitrate of soda, sulphate of\r\nammonia, superphosphate, &c., so as to closely resemble in its\r\ncomposition guano, is by no means similar in its effects to the genuine\r\narticle. As in farmyard manure, so in guano: we must look to the\r\ncomplexity of the composition of both these fertilisers in order to\r\nfully estimate their worth. There is in the action of both manures much\r\nthat we cannot explain, or even, as yet, understand. The action of guano\r\nis merely one of many problems in the science of manuring which\r\nillustrate how unsatisfactory, despite the great amount of research\r\nalready carried out, is our knowledge of this most important department\r\nof agriculture.[197]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Proportion of fertilising Constituents in Guano._\r\n\r\nGuano must be regarded as a nitrogenous and phosphatic manure, as the\r\nquantity of potash it generally contains is small. In many soils, more\r\nespecially in such a country as Scotland, this deficiency in potash is\r\nnot of so much importance, as the value of potash as an artificial\r\nmanure is less than is the case with the other two ingredients. In\r\nsoils, however, lacking potash, guano ought to be supplemented with some\r\npotash manure. With regard to the nitrogen and phosphoric acid, we may\r\nask if these two constituents are in the best proportions. This question\r\ndoes not admit of a direct answer. In the first place, the proportion\r\nin which these two ingredients are present is variable. In the old rich\r\nPeruvian guanos, as we have above shown, the nitrogen was more abundant\r\nthan is the case at present. Such guanos, it was found, were best\r\nsupplemented with phosphatic manure when applied to the field. In the\r\n\"equalised\" and \"dissolved\" guanos, which are now so largely sold,\r\nmanufacturers attempt to adjust the percentage of nitrogen and\r\nphosphoric acid to what is considered the best proportion in most cases.\r\nAs, however, we have again and again to point out, regard must be had\r\nboth to the soil and the crop in determining what is the best proportion\r\nof the manurial ingredients in a manure. For cereals it may be well\r\nsupplemented by nitrogenous manures, while for roots it may be well\r\nsupplemented by phosphatic manures.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mode of Application._\r\n\r\nLike all manures, it is desirable to apply it in as fine a condition as\r\npossible, so as to ensure as thorough a mixture with the soil-particles\r\nas practicable. In order, furthermore, to prevent any risk of loss\r\nthrough volatilisation of the ammonia, as well as to ensure even\r\ndistribution, it is best applied mixed with dry earth, ashes, sand, or\r\nsome other substance,--not lime, however. The custom of applying along\r\nwith the guano common salt, has been proved by numerous experiments to\r\nbe highly beneficial to the action of the guano as a manure. The exact\r\nnature of the action of salt as an adjunct to manures is a point which\r\nhas elicited much discussion. Its action is probably to be ascribed to a\r\nnumber of causes. For one thing, it probably acts as an antiseptic in\r\nretarding the fermentative action which has a tendency to go on so\r\nrapidly in such manures as guano. It further increases the power of the\r\nmanure to attract moisture from the air--a most important property in\r\nthe case of drought. Some experiments by Dr Voelcker illustrate this in\r\na striking manner. Two lots of guano--one pure and one mixed with\r\nsalt--were exposed to the action of the air for a month, and were then\r\ntested as to the amount of water they contained, when it was found that\r\nthe lot containing the salt had absorbed 2 per cent more water than the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nMuch stress has been laid on the importance of having the guano buried a\r\ncertain depth in the soil; and many experiments have been carried out to\r\nprove how much better it acts when so applied. This is probably due to\r\nthe prevention of any loss of volatile ammonia, and the mixture of the\r\nmanure with the soil-particles before it comes in contact with the\r\nplant-roots. This last precaution is an important one, for it has been\r\nfound that the raw material is apt to have a bad effect on the seed or\r\nthe plant's roots. This has been found to be especially the case in\r\nregard to potatoes, the quality of which has been found to suffer when\r\nthe guano is brought into direct contact with the tubers. As guano is a\r\nmanure which is speedily available, it is desirable to apply it as\r\nshortly before it is required by the plant as possible. It is therefore\r\ngenerally best applied in spring, shortly before seed-time, or indeed at\r\nthe same time. Where farmyard manure is used, the guano has been\r\nrecommended to be used as a top-dressing in small quantities. In the\r\nmajority of cases it will be advisable, however, not to apply it as a\r\ntop-dressing, for the various reasons above-mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quantity to be used._\r\n\r\nAs to the quantity to be used, this of course will depend on the soil,\r\nthe crop, and the amount and nature of the other manures employed: 1 to\r\n4 cwt. per acre have been the usual limits, but even heavier dressings\r\nhave been commonly resorted to, especially in Scotland, where 6 to 8 or\r\neven 9 cwt. for turnips are often used. Sir J. B. Lawes and Sir James\r\nCaird long ago, shortly after the introduction of guano, estimated, from\r\nthe experiments they carried out, that the application of 2 cwt. per\r\nacre to the wheat crop gave an increase of 8 to 9 bushels in grain, and\r\nadded a fourth to the quantity of straw. The former authority recommends\r\n2 to 3 cwt. per acre for wheat, to be sown broadcast and harrowed into\r\nthe land before sowing the seed. We have already stated that it may be\r\nused in all soils and for all kinds of crops. While this is so, it has\r\nbeen found to have specially favourable results when applied to the\r\nturnip crop, when it may be used in larger quantities than in the case\r\nof cereals. When applied to the turnip crop, it is well to use the more\r\nphosphatic guanos or to supplement it with superphosphates. By applying\r\nit in two lots, the larger portion before seed-time and the rest between\r\nthe drills after the turnips are up, excellent results have been\r\nobtained. It has also proved an admirable manure for mangels. On the\r\nwhole, it gives best results on heavy soils and in a dampish climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Guano._\r\n\r\nProbably no artificial manure has been subjected to greater adulteration\r\nin the past than guano. This has been due to the fact that the practice\r\nof selling guano on analysis--especially among retail buyers--did not\r\nlargely obtain in the early years of the trade. A good deal of this\r\nadulteration was probably caused by ignorant prejudice on the part of\r\nthe farmer, to whom the pungency of its smell and its colour were too\r\napt to be ranked as its most important properties. The variation in the\r\nquality of different kinds of guano was too often not sufficiently\r\nrealised by the buyer, who not unfrequently was made to pay as high a\r\nprice for guano of an inferior quality as he ought to have paid for that\r\nof the best quality. Indeed no manure illustrates the importance of\r\nchemical analysis more than guano. Among the different forms of\r\nadulteration practised may be mentioned the addition of such substances\r\nas sawdust, rice-meal, chalk, sulphates of lime and magnesia, common\r\nsalt, sand, earth, peat, ashes of various kinds, and water. There can be\r\nno doubt, however, that such adulteration has now long ceased to be\r\npractised to any extent. Nevertheless, it may be of use to draw\r\nattention to one or two of the tests by means of which some of the\r\ncommoner forms of adulteration may be detected. One or two are extremely\r\neasily detected--as, for example, adulteration with sand or other\r\nmineral substances. In such a case, the percentage of ash left on\r\nburning a small portion of the guano will be found to be excessive. The\r\npercentage of ash in a sample of genuine Peruvian guano should not\r\nexceed from 50 to 60 per cent. The colour of the ash is another\r\nimportant point, and may serve as a further indication of adulteration.\r\nIn the case of genuine guano, this should be whitish or greyish.\r\nRed-coloured ash generally points to the adulteration of the guano with\r\nsome mineral substance containing iron--such, _e.g._, as Redonda\r\nphosphate, a mineral phosphate of iron and alumina. Where the ash is\r\nwhite, but excessive in quantity, adulteration with common salt,\r\nsulphate of magnesia, gypsum, or chalk, may be suspected. The last-named\r\nsubstance is easily detected by treating it with any of the common\r\nacids, when brisk effervescence, due to the liberation of the carbonic\r\nacid, will ensue.[198] A further point of importance with regard to the\r\nash is its solubility in water and in acids. A large insoluble residue\r\nmay be taken as indicating adulteration with sand. Adulteration with\r\nwater is also easily detected by heating a sample to the boiling\r\ntemperature and determining the loss it sustains. Of course the amount\r\nof water varies in different samples. The appearance of the guano will\r\nserve fairly well to detect whether it is abnormally moist. It may be\r\nadded, in conclusion, that Peruvian guano is extremely light; and while\r\nthis by itself is not a sufficient test of genuineness, it may serve to\r\nconfirm other tests.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--SO-CALLED GUANOS.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding this chapter, reference may be made to certain manures\r\nwhich are commonly known under the name of guanos--such as \"fish-guano,\"\r\n\"flesh-guano,\" \"meat-meal-guano,\" and \"bat-guano,\"--as well as to\r\nmanures which may more conveniently be described here--viz., \"fowl and\r\npigeon dung.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fish-Guano._\r\n\r\nThe application of fish, not suited for other purposes, to the fields\r\nas a manure is a practice which has obtained in certain parts of the\r\ncountry for a number of years. In many districts on the sea-coast, where\r\nfishing is the chief industry, the only way in the past of disposing of\r\na superabundant catch of herrings, for example, has been to utilise them\r\nas a manure. From such a practice has sprung up what is now an important\r\nand ever-increasing trade--viz., the manufacture of fish-guano.\r\n\r\nThis manufacture was first started, and is still most largely practised,\r\nin Norway. The guano obtained varies very considerably in quality\r\naccording to the nature of the process employed, and as to whether the\r\nguano is made from whole fish or merely from fish-offal. The latter\r\nsource is the common one. The manufacture is carried on at the\r\nfish-curing stations, and the quality of the guano made from this source\r\nis somewhat different from that made from whole fish, as a large\r\nproportion of the fish-offal is made up of bones and heads. Large\r\nquantities of Norwegian fish-guano are exported to various parts of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe best quality of this guano may contain as much as 10 per cent of\r\nnitrogen, but as a rule it is nearer 8 per cent. A very considerable\r\nvariation in the amount of phosphoric acid occurs for the reason above\r\nstated, the guano made from fish-scrap being naturally much richer in\r\nthis ingredient than whole-fish guano. The phosphoric acid may be said\r\nto range from 4 to 15 per cent, and there is also a small quantity of\r\npotash present.\r\n\r\nGuano is also manufactured in Norway from the carcasses of whales. Such\r\nguano contains from 7-1/2 to 8-1/2 per cent of nitrogen, and about\r\n13-1/2 per cent of phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nIn America fish-guano is manufactured to a considerable extent--one\r\nimportant source being the menhaddo, a coarse sort of herring. This fish\r\nis caught for the sake of its oil, which is extracted by boiling, the\r\nresidue being manufactured, after pressing and drying, into guano.\r\n\r\nIn this country the manufacture of fish-guano is carried out to a\r\nconsiderable and increasing extent. Formerly it was imported from Norway\r\nto a larger extent than is now the case, the present annual imports\r\namounting only to 1000 or 2000 tons. The total annual production in the\r\nUnited Kingdom is probably 7000 or 8000 tons.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Value of \"Fish-Guano.\"_\r\n\r\nThat fish-guano is a valuable manure there can be no doubt. What,\r\nhowever, impairs its value is the fact that, as a rule, it contains a\r\ncertain amount of oil. The effect of this oil is to retard fermentation\r\nand decomposition when the guano is applied to the soil, and thus render\r\nits action slower than would otherwise be the case.\r\n\r\nWhen applied to the soil, therefore, every opportunity ought to be\r\ngiven to promote its fermentation. It is best applied some time before\r\nit is likely to be used. It ought to be well mixed with the\r\nsoil-particles, and not allowed to lie on the top of the soil. Its best\r\neffect will be on light well-cultivated soils, which permit of the\r\naccess both of sufficient moisture and of sufficient air for rapid\r\nfermentation. Its value as a manure for hops, vines, grass, and\r\nstrawberries has been found to be considerable. It has been recommended\r\nto be applied along with farmyard manure; and such a mode of application\r\nis no doubt well suited to promote its decomposition. It has also been\r\nused for mixing with superphosphate of lime. Professor Storer has\r\nadvocated a more general use of fish as a manure than is at present the\r\ncase. He suggests that even fish not suitable for edible purposes might\r\nbe caught for the purpose of conversion into manure. The difficulty of\r\npreserving fish, however, is considerable; and he suggests the use of\r\npotash salts, such as muriate of potash, or lime for this purpose. The\r\nbenefit of using potash would be twofold. In addition to acting as a\r\npreservative, it would considerably enhance the value of the resulting\r\nguano as a manure. There is much truth in Professor Storer's views; and\r\nno doubt, as our sources of artificial nitrogenous manures grow more\r\nlimited, the manufacture of fish-guano will be carried on in the future\r\non a larger and more systematic scale than hitherto.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Meat-meal Guano._\r\n\r\nWhat is called \"meat-meal guano\" is generally that made from the refuse\r\nof the carcasses of cattle after they have been treated for their\r\nmeat-extract according to Liebig's process. The meat-meal is used both\r\nfor feeding and manurial purposes. Considerable quantities[199] of this\r\nguano are imported annually into this country from South America,\r\nQueensland, and New Zealand,--that coming from Frey Bentos, in Uruguay,\r\nbeing best known. It is a valuable manure, especially so for its\r\nnitrogen, which varies from 4 to 8 per cent, while it contains of\r\nphosphoric acid from 13 to 20 per cent. Some meat-meal guanos contain as\r\nmuch nitrogen as 11 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the world, more especially in Germany, the carcasses of\r\nhorses, as well as cattle, dogs, pigs, &c., which have died of disease,\r\nare converted into a guano. They are subjected to treatment by steam in\r\ndigestors, by which means the fat and gelatine are separated and\r\nutilised, while the remaining portion of the animal is converted into\r\nguano. Other processes are also employed. The resulting manure contains\r\nfrom 6 to 10 per cent of nitrogen, and from 6 to 14 per cent of\r\nphosphoric acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Value of Meat-meal Guano._\r\n\r\nMeat-meal guano is a valuable nitrogenous manure. The same remarks\r\napply to it as to fish-guano, although it ferments probably very much\r\nmore quickly than the latter, and is undoubtedly a more valuable manure.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bat Guano._\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we may consider bat guano. Bat guano, which is really a\r\nvery rare curiosity, has been found accumulated in hot climates in\r\ncaves.\r\n\r\nThe samples which have been analysed have differed very much in quality,\r\nsome containing as much as 9 per cent of nitrogen and 25 per cent of\r\nphosphoric acid. Provided it could be obtained in any quantity, and of a\r\nquality even approximating to the above analysis, it need scarcely be\r\npointed out that bat guano would be a most valuable manure.\r\n\r\nA singular point about its composition is, that it has been found to\r\ncontain a considerable proportion of its nitrogen (as much as 3 per\r\ncent) in the form of nitrates.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pigeon and Fowl Dung._\r\n\r\nPigeon dung is a manure which historically is of great importance. The\r\ndung of pigeons was used as a manure by the ancient Romans; and even in\r\nmodern times, more especially in France, it was considered a most\r\nimportant fertiliser. Despite these facts, pigeon dung is by no means a\r\nrich manure, and its composition compares most unfavourably with that of\r\nthe guanos we have just been considering. According to Storer,[200] it\r\nonly contains from 1-1/4 to 2-1/2 per cent of nitrogen, and from 1-1/2\r\nto 2 per cent of phosphoric acid, and a little over 1 per cent of\r\npotash.\r\n\r\nThe dung of poultry is just about as poor, fowl dung containing from .8\r\nto 2 per cent of nitrogen, 1-1/2 to 2 per cent of phosphoric acid, and a\r\nlittle under 1 per cent of potash; while that of ducks and geese is even\r\npoorer.[201]\r\n\r\nFrom these statements it will be seen that the excrements of pigeons,\r\nhens, and ducks do not form a rich manure. One thing about pigeon dung\r\nwhich is to be noticed, is the fact that it ferments very quickly.\r\n\r\nNone of the pseudo-guanos, however rich they may be in manurial\r\ningredients, can be regarded as equal in their action to the genuine\r\narticle, for reasons which we have gone into already when considering\r\nthe action of guano.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[183] Bones, it is true, were in use long before guano; but popular as\r\nthey deservedly were, they had not been used, at the time of the\r\nimportation of guano, to any very considerable extent.\r\n\r\n[184] The total annual imports at present may be taken at under 30,000\r\ntons, whereas in 1855 they amounted to over 200,000 tons. For statistics\r\non this point the reader is referred to the Appendix, Note I., p. 327.\r\n\r\n[185] With regard to the origin of certain guano deposits, which are of\r\nvery recent date--_e.g._, _Angamos_ and _Ichaboe_--there can be no doubt\r\nwhatever, because we can witness the process of formation still taking\r\nplace. It is not so, however, with regard to older deposits, for which\r\nsome have been inclined to claim mineral origin. The best proof that\r\nsuch deposits owe their origin mainly to bird excrements is the\r\ncomparatively large quantity of _uric acid_ they contain. On the other\r\nhand, the evidence in support of the belief that they are also formed\r\nfrom the remains of the birds themselves and other animals, is to be\r\nfound in the large proportion of phosphates they contain, and the\r\npresence in the deposits of feathers and the fossilised skeletons of the\r\nanimals above mentioned.\r\n\r\n[186] A complete list of the various deposits will be found in the\r\nAppendix, Note II., p. 327. It may be noticed that nearly all the\r\ndeposits lie within 10 deg. to 20 deg. north and south of the Equator.\r\n\r\n[187] See Chapter on Farmyard Manure, p. 257.\r\n\r\n[188] According to Nesbit, some of the cargoes of this guano contained\r\nhard saline lumps of very little manurial value--over 50 per cent being\r\ncommon salt.\r\n\r\n[189] The salt exports were made in 1868.\r\n\r\n[190] For analyses of these nodules and crystals, see Appendix, Note\r\nIII., p. 328.\r\n\r\n[191] See Heiden, vol. ii. p. 356.\r\n\r\n[192] See Appendix, Note IV., p. 329.\r\n\r\n[193] The Ichaboe guano at present exported is a fresh deposit, and is\r\nannually collected for shipment.\r\n\r\n[194] Further chemical changes have occurred in certain cases between\r\nthe guano and the limestone rock beneath, resulting in the formation of\r\nwhat is called a \"crust\" guano. Such guanos form a soft phosphatic rock,\r\nand are extremely rich in phosphates. As examples of these \"crust\"\r\nguanos may be mentioned Sombrero, Curacao, Aruba, Mexico, and Navassa\r\nphosphates.\r\n\r\n[195] The presence in the old Peruvian guano of concretionary nodules\r\nhas already been referred to.\r\n\r\n[196] According to Vogel the nitrogen as urates is converted by the\r\nsulphuric acid into ammonia salts.\r\n\r\n[197] See Appendix, Note VI. p. 330.\r\n\r\n[198] It must be remembered, however, that even genuine guano contains a\r\ncertain quantity of carbonate of lime, and will give a slight amount of\r\neffervescence when so treated.\r\n\r\n[199] The annual imports may be stated at from 3000 to 4000 tons.\r\n\r\n[200] Agricultural Chemistry, vol. i. p. 367.\r\n\r\n[201] See Appendix, Note VII., p. 331.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE I.

Along with sulphate of ammonia, it has taken\r\nthe place once held in the manure markets by the older Peruvian guano,\r\nand may without doubt be reckoned, at present prices, one of the\r\ncheapest and most valuable of the artificial sources of nitrogen for the\r\nplant. It is some sixty-two years ago since it was first exported from\r\nSouth America into this country. The total exports in that year amounted\r\nto about 800 tons, and some indication of the enormous extent to which\r\nthe use of this valuable fertiliser has been developed since then will\r\nbe obtained from the statement that the total exports at present amount\r\nto little less than 1,000,000 tons per annum, representing a monetary\r\nvalue of 6 to 7 millions sterling. Of this quantity about 120,000 tons\r\nare imported into Britain.[203] While its chief use is for manurial\r\npurposes, it must not be imagined that it is only used for this purpose.\r\nA certain amount is used in connection with various chemical\r\nmanufactures--for instance, that of nitric and sulphuric acid--and also\r\nin the manufacture of saltpetre, the chief constituent of gunpowder.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Date of Discovery of Nitrate Deposits._\r\n\r\nThe exact date of the discovery of the nitrate deposits seems to be a\r\npoint of considerable dubiety. The earliest published description of\r\nthem was written by Bollaert about the year 1820, in which year, it is\r\nstated, the first shipment was made to England. It was not, however,\r\ntill some ten or twelve years later that the Peruvian Government, to\r\nwhom they then belonged,[204] seems to have recognised their value. The\r\nmost important deposits are found in the vicinity of the town of\r\nIquique, which is the chief nitrate port of South America. It is a\r\nsomewhat striking fact that this substance, which has conclusively\r\nproved itself to be the most potent of all known artificial agents in\r\nthe promotion of vegetable growth, should be found in a district utterly\r\nlacking the slightest traces of vegetation of any kind. Lest such a\r\nstatement should seem to savour of irony, we hasten to explain that the\r\nsingular barrenness of this part of the country is largely due to the\r\ncharacter of its climate, the deposits occurring in the midst of sandy\r\ndeserts,[205] on which rain never falls.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Their Origin._\r\n\r\nThe origin of these nitrate-fields is a geological problem of very\r\nconsiderable interest, the difficulty of which is greatly enhanced by\r\ntheir altitude--3000 to 4000 feet above the sea-level--and their\r\ndistance inland, which amounts in some cases to eighty or ninety miles\r\nfrom the sea-coast. The nitrate deposits are not the only saline\r\ndeposits found in Chili. According to the late David Forbes,[206] they\r\nare not to be confused with other saline formations, which appear at\r\nintervals scattered over the whole of that portion of the western coast,\r\non which no rain falls. The latter stretch from north to south for a\r\ndistance of more than 550 miles--their greatest development being\r\nbetween latitudes 19 deg. and 25 deg. south. The depth to which they extend\r\ndownwards varies considerably. Most of them, however, are of a very\r\nsuperficial character, and \"they always show signs of their existence by\r\nthe saline efflorescence seen on the surface of the ground, which often\r\ncovers vast plains as a white crystalline incrustation, the dust from\r\nwhich, entering the nostrils and mouth of the traveller, causes much\r\nannoyance, whilst at the same time the eyes are equally suffering from\r\nthe intensely brilliant reflection of the rays of a tropical sun.\" These\r\nsaline incrustations, or _salinas_, as they are generally called, are\r\nchiefly composed of salts of lime, soda, magnesia, alumina, and of\r\nboracic acid. Their composition would lead one to attribute their origin\r\nto the evaporation of salt water; for, with the single exception of\r\nboracic acid,[207] all the mineral substances are such as would be\r\nobtained by the evaporation of sea-water, or by the mutual reactions of\r\nits salts with the constituents of the adjacent rocks. As there is\r\n\"indisputable evidence of the recent elevation of the whole of this\r\ncoast,\" volcanic upheaval might be reasonably held to explain their\r\naltitude. Their comparative proximity to the coast would seem further to\r\nfavour this theory. On these grounds, therefore, Forbes is inclined to\r\nthink that they owe their origin to the evaporation, under the influence\r\nof a tropical sun, of lagoons of salt water, the communication of which\r\nwith the sea had been cut off by the rising of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Forbes and Darwin on the Theory of their Origin._\r\n\r\nThe obvious difficulty of accounting for the formation of the larger\r\ndeposits by such a theory he meets by saying that it is only necessary\r\nto suppose that, even after the partial isolation of the lagoons by the\r\nelevations of the coast, they might still have maintained tidal or\r\noccasional communication with the sea by means of lateral openings in\r\nthe chain of hills separating them from the ocean. In such cases there\r\nwould be a gradual accumulation of salts, very much greater in amount\r\nthan that due simply to the evaporation of the water originally\r\ncontained in the lagoons. The above theory of the origin of the lower\r\nsaline deposits may go to explain the mode of formation of the\r\nnitrate-fields; but in this case several difficulties present\r\nthemselves. One is the much greater altitude of the latter, as well as\r\ntheir greater distance inland. This difficulty, however, may be met by\r\nassuming that they are of older origin than the lower deposits, and have\r\nbeen subjected to a correspondingly greater amount of volcanic upheaval.\r\nThere is abundance of proof that this part of the continent has been the\r\nscene in the past of such volcanic upheaval. Forbes is of opinion that\r\nthere is the fullest evidence to prove that, even since the arrival of\r\nthe Spaniards, a very considerable elevation of the land has taken place\r\nover the greater part, if not the whole extent, of the line of coast;\r\nwhile Darwin states that he has convincing proof that this part of the\r\ncontinent has been elevated from 400 to 1200 feet since the epoch of\r\nexisting shells. Furthermore, elevations of the coast-line, amounting in\r\nmany cases to several feet, are known to have happened within recent\r\ntimes, while earthquakes and volcanic disturbances of a less striking\r\nnature are still of common occurrence. Successive lines, indicative of\r\nold sea-beaches, can be distinctly traced stretching inland, one behind\r\nthe other; and patches of sea-sand and water-worn stone, found at a\r\ngreat distance from the coast, both in valleys and at altitudes much\r\ngreater even than 4000 feet, point to the same conclusion.[208] The\r\ndifficulty, therefore, of altitude and distance from the coast cannot be\r\nregarded as insuperable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Source of Nitric Acid._\r\n\r\nA difficulty, however, which is not so easily met, is afforded by the\r\npresence of the nitric acid which, in combination with the soda, forms\r\nthe nitrate of soda. It is scarcely necessary to inform our readers that\r\nnitrogen--except, of course, in small quantities in the free state--is\r\nnot a normal constituent of salt water. The question, therefore, of\r\ngreatest interest in connection with the formation of these nitrate-beds\r\nis, Whence has the nitric acid been derived? Several theories have been\r\nput forward to account for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Guano Theory._\r\n\r\nOne is to the effect that it owes its origin to huge guano deposits,\r\noriginally covering the shores of the large salt lakes which, by the\r\nsubsequent overflowing of their shores, effected the mixture of the\r\nguano with the salts. In this way, by a slow process of decomposition,\r\nnitrate of soda would be ultimately formed.[209] This theory, apart from\r\nother considerations, seems at first sight extremely plausible, more\r\nespecially when we remember that it is on this very coast that the\r\ngreatest guano deposits have been found, and that the famous Chincha\r\nIslands, which alone have yielded over 10 million tons of this valuable\r\nfertiliser, are comparatively near the scene of the nitrate deposits.\r\nWhat seems further to support this theory, is the actual occurrence in\r\nthe nitrate-fields themselves of small quantities of guano. But however\r\nplausible it may appear at first sight, it does not bear closer\r\ncriticism. One very serious objection is the absence in these deposits\r\nof phosphate of lime, which is the largest constituent of guano. If they\r\nwere really due to guano, how does it happen that the insoluble\r\nphosphate of lime should have disappeared, while the easily soluble\r\nnitrate of soda should alone be preserved? Again, assuming this theory\r\nto be correct, we should naturally expect to be still able to find\r\nevidence of the chemical changes which would under such circumstances\r\nhave taken place, in the shape of portions of the guano in the\r\ntransition stage. Such evidence, however, the most careful\r\ninvestigations have failed to detect. Apart, however, from the above\r\nobjections, there seems to be little doubt, from evidence afforded by\r\ntraces of birds' nests, &c., that the guano found in the nitrate-beds\r\nwas deposited subsequent to the formation of the nitrate of soda.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nitric Acid derived from Sea-weed._\r\n\r\nThe most probable theory seems to be that put forward by Noellner. The\r\norigin of the nitric acid is, according to him, to be ascribed to the\r\ndecay of great masses of sea-weed, which, by means of hurricanes such as\r\nare still prevalent in these districts, were driven into the lagoons.\r\nThe chief difficulty in the way of accepting this theory is the enormous\r\nquantity of sea-weed required to produce the millions of tons of nitric\r\nacid these deposits contain. It must be remembered, however, as bearing\r\nupon this point, that the occurrence of gigantic masses of sea-weed in\r\nthe Pacific Ocean[210] is by no means uncommon even at the present time.\r\nIf, to understand the formation of coal, we must suppose the\r\nCarboniferous period to be one during which exceptionally luxuriant\r\ngrowth of vegetation took place, we may be permitted to suppose a\r\nsimilar luxuriant growth of sea-weed during the formation of the nitrate\r\ndeposits. Very strong confirmation of the truth of this theory is\r\nfurther afforded by the presence in large quantities, in the raw nitrate\r\nof soda, of iodine, a substance characteristic of sea-weed; while pieces\r\nof sea-weed still undecomposed are met with here and there. On the\r\nwhole, therefore, this theory, while not free from difficulties, seems\r\nto be the most worthy of acceptance as regards the origin of the nitrate\r\ndeposits.[211]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Appearance of Nitrate-fields._\r\n\r\nHaving thus discussed the origin of the nitrate-fields, we may now give\r\na more detailed description of their appearance. The chief deposits at\r\npresent being worked are those lying in the Pampa de Tamarugal, in the\r\nprovince of Tarapaca. They stretch to a distance of thirty or forty\r\nmiles inland, from Pisagua southwards to somewhat beyond the town of\r\nIquique. This huge desert, as has been already indicated, seems to be\r\nentirely destitute of all vegetation and animal life. Even in the\r\nimmediately adjoining country the only kind of vegetation that seems to\r\ngrow is a species of _acacia_. The few streams that are found in this\r\nneighbourhood are entirely fed by the melting snow from the Cordilleras.\r\nDarwin describes the appearance presented by these pampas as resembling\r\n\"a country after snow, before the last dirty patches are thawed.\" The\r\n_caliche_, or raw nitrate of soda, is not equally distributed over the\r\npampas. The most abundant deposits are situated on the slopes of the\r\nhills which probably formed the shores of the old lagoons. An expert can\r\ntell from the external appearance of the ground where the richest\r\ndeposits are likely to be found. The _caliche_ itself is not found on\r\nthe surface of the plain, but is covered up by two layers. The\r\nuppermost, known technically as _chuca_, is of a friable nature, and\r\nconsists of sand and gypsum; while the lower, the _costra_, is a rocky\r\nconglomerate of clay, gravel, and fragments of felspar. The _caliche_\r\nvaries in thickness from a few inches to 10 or 12 feet, and rests on a\r\nsoft stratum of earth called _cova_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Method of mining the Nitrate._\r\n\r\nThe mode in which the _caliche_ is excavated is as follows: A hole is\r\nbored through the _chuca_, _costra_, and _caliche_ layers till the\r\n_cova_ or soft earth is reached below. It is then enlarged until it is\r\nwide enough to admit of a small boy being let down, who scrapes away the\r\nearth below the _caliche_ so as to form a little hollow cup. Into this a\r\ncharge of gunpowder is introduced, and subsequently exploded. The\r\n_caliche_ is then separated by means of picks from the overlying\r\n_costra_ and carried to the refinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Caliche._\r\n\r\nBoth in appearance and composition it varies very much. In colour it may\r\nbe snow-white, sulphur, lemon, orange, violet, blue, and sometimes brown\r\nlike raw sugar.\r\n\r\nThe _caliche_ found in the Pampa de Tamarugal contains generally about\r\n30 to 50 per cent pure nitrate of soda; that in the province of Atacama\r\ncontains from 25 to 40 per cent. The subsequent refining processes,\r\nwhich consist in crushing it by means of rollers and then dissolving it,\r\nneed not here be described. It may be sufficient to mention that the\r\nprocess used is that known as systematic lixiviation, and is analogous\r\nto the method introduced by Shanks in the manufacture of soda. The chief\r\nimpurity in the raw material is common salt: gypsum, sulphates of\r\npotassium, sodium, and magnesium, along with insoluble matters, are the\r\nother impurities. The manufacture of iodine, which, as has been already\r\nnoticed, is found in the nitrate-beds, is also carried on at these\r\n_oficinas_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extent of the Nitrate Deposits._\r\n\r\nThe question of the extent of the nitrate of soda deposits is naturally\r\none of very great interest, especially from the agricultural point of\r\nview. M. Charles Legrange, a French writer, estimated a few years ago\r\nthat they still contained about 100,000,000 tons of pure nitrate of\r\nsoda. Opinions on this point differ very considerably, and it seems\r\nwellnigh impossible to arrive at any very accurate estimate.\r\n\r\nThe number of years they will last will depend, of course, on the amount\r\nof annual exportation. This, at present, falls little short of 1,000,000\r\ntons. If this amount is maintained, they should last, according to\r\nexperts, some twenty or thirty years at least. A consideration which has\r\nan important influence on this question, is the price obtained for the\r\narticle. If this should be increased, it may be possible to treat the\r\nlarger quantities of the inferior raw material (which at present prices\r\nare allowed to accumulate) at a profit. Undoubtedly this is what will\r\nultimately take place, when the richer quality of the _caliche_ has been\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition and Properties of Nitrate of Soda._\r\n\r\nAs has already been pointed out, commercial nitrate of soda contains\r\nabout 95 per cent of pure nitrate of soda, or about 15-1/2 per cent of\r\nnitrogen, which, if calculated as ammonia, would equal 19 per cent. It\r\nis, next to sulphate of ammonia (which contains 24-1/2 per cent of\r\nammonia), the most concentrated nitrogenous manure, and further,\r\ncontains its nitrogen in the form most readily available for the plant's\r\nuse. Its most characteristic property is its great solubility, and\r\nconsequent speedy diffusion in the soil, and the inability of the\r\nsoil-particles to fix its nitrogen. In the latter respect it differs\r\nvery considerably from other forms of nitrogen. Ammonia salts, though\r\npractically quite as soluble, do not diffuse in the soil so rapidly as\r\nnitrate of soda does; for the ammonia is more or less tenaciously fixed\r\nby the soil-particles, and retained till converted by the process of\r\n_nitrification_ into nitrates.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nitrate of Soda applied as a Top-dressing._\r\n\r\nOn this account nitrate of soda is chiefly employed--and rightly so--as\r\na top-dressing. The risk of loss by drainage is thus minimised, and the\r\nvaluable nitrogen finds its rightful destination--viz., in the plant's\r\nroots.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Encourages deep Roots._\r\n\r\nA special benefit which the diffusibility of nitrate of soda has been\r\nheld to confer on the plant, is to encourage the growth of deep roots,\r\nby inducing the growing plant to send down its roots into the lower\r\nlayers of the soil after the nitrate of soda. The benefit of deep roots\r\nis, of course, very great. They enable the plant to withstand the action\r\nof drought, and at the same time increase the area whence the plant may\r\nderive its nourishment. Although the value of the manure is practically\r\nentirely due to the nitrogen it contains, it has been urged that the\r\nsoda exercises a beneficial effect on the mechanical properties of the\r\nsoil, by increasing its power of absorbing moisture, and in also\r\nrendering it more compact. This would partly explain how its results in\r\ndry seasons are so much better than those obtained from sulphate of\r\nammonia. This mechanical action of nitrate can scarcely be very great\r\nwhen we remember the comparatively small quantity applied. Even in the\r\ndriest of seasons there will always be sufficient moisture to secure the\r\ndiffusion of the nitrate of soda, while the risk of loss by drainage\r\nwill be reduced to a minimum. Much ignorance, as well as prejudice, has\r\nexisted in the past as to the true nature of the action of nitrate of\r\nsoda. Nor is this prejudice even yet entirely dispelled.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Is Nitrate an exhausting Manure?_\r\n\r\nThe common charge brought against it is, that it is what has been termed\r\nan exhausting manure. This objection, to have any weight, must mean that\r\nnitrate of soda produces a crop which takes out of the soil an\r\n_abnormal_ quantity of fertilising matter. But, so far as the writer is\r\naware, no scientific evidence has ever been brought forward to support\r\nthis contention. That the indiscriminate use of a manure may produce a\r\ncrop in which the stem and leaves are unduly developed at the expense of\r\nthe grain, or in which the quality of the crop may suffer from too rapid\r\ngrowth, is, of course, a well-known fact. But as this could also be\r\nproduced by an overdose of soluble phosphoric acid as well as ammonia\r\nsalts, it is not a property that belongs exclusively to nitrate of soda.\r\nProbably nitrate of soda has in the past been often used in this\r\nindiscriminate way so as to produce such results. The fault, therefore,\r\nlies not in the manure, but in the mode of its application. A few\r\nremarks, therefore, on this most important subject may prove\r\nserviceable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Crops for which it is suited._\r\n\r\nOpinions will naturally differ as to the crops to which it is profitable\r\nto apply nitrate of soda. Its value as a manure for cereals is pretty\r\ngenerally admitted. Its value as a manure for roots is not, however, so\r\nuniversally admitted. Experiments would seem to show that such a crop as\r\nthe mangold derives just as much benefit as do the cereals; while in\r\nGermany practical experience on a very large scale has demonstrated its\r\nvalue as a manure for beetroots. It may be generally recommended as a\r\nmanure for all crops, except, perhaps, the so-called leguminous crops,\r\nsuch as clover, beans, peas, &c, whose ability to obtain nitrogen for\r\nthemselves renders the application of expensive artificial nitrogenous\r\nmanures unadvisable.\r\n\r\nAn interesting point with regard to nitrate of soda is the curious\r\neffect it seems to have on the colour of the leaves of plants. This\r\ninteresting fact has been strikingly demonstrated at the Rothamsted\r\nExperimental Station, in the contrast in the colour of the leaves of\r\ndifferent experimental grass-plots, manured with nitrate of soda and\r\nsulphate of ammonia respectively--the plots manured with nitrate of soda\r\nbeing distinctly darker in hue, obviously owing to the greater\r\nproduction of chlorophyll or green matter. Such a depth of colour would\r\nseem to indicate a more healthy development.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Method of Application._\r\n\r\nWhile opinions, therefore, will naturally differ as to the crops to\r\nwhich nitrate of soda will be most profitably applied, little difference\r\nof opinion exists as to the method of its application. The inability of\r\nthe soil-particles to retain it, the frequency of rain, the costly\r\nnature of the manure itself, and its immediate availability as a\r\nplant-food, all point to the extreme advisability of using it as a\r\ntop-dressing. Even when used as a top-dressing, it may be advisable not\r\nto apply the entire quantity all at one time. By applying it in\r\ninstalments, little risk is run that, through inclemency of weather, the\r\nmanure will be lost. Another point of importance in applying nitrate of\r\nsoda is to secure uniform distribution. This of course is applicable to\r\nall artificial manures, but in a very special degree to nitrate of soda,\r\nbecause of its great value and the comparatively small quantity\r\napplied.\r\n\r\nAs the uniform distribution of one cwt. of any material over an acre of\r\nsoil is by no means an easy task, the mixing of nitrate of soda with\r\nsome diluent, such as dry loam, is consequently highly advisable. Common\r\nsalt is often applied along with nitrate of soda. The indirect value of\r\nsalt as a manure is considerable, and when applied along with nitrate,\r\nensures its more speedy diffusion in the soil, by increasing the soil's\r\ncapacity for absorbing moisture from the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Must be a Sufficiency of other Fertilising Constituents._\r\n\r\nA third point of importance in applying nitrate of soda, is to see that\r\nthe soil is sufficiently supplied with the other plant-foods--phosphates\r\nand potash. This is a _sine qua non_, if the nitrate is to get a fair\r\nchance. If it is desired to apply nitrate of soda along with\r\nsuperphosphate of lime, a word of caution is necessary against making\r\nthe mixture long before it is used. The reason of this is, that a\r\nchemical action is apt to ensue, resulting in the loss of the nitric\r\nacid in the nitrate of soda. The nature of the soil is another important\r\nconsideration to be taken into account. In the case of extremely loose\r\nand sandy soils, it is scarcely to be recommended as the most suitable\r\nform in which to apply nitrogen. If applied to such soils, especial care\r\nought to be taken to minimise risk of loss. No hard-and-fast rules can\r\nbe laid down as to the quantity in which it ought to be applied. This\r\nmust be regulated very much by the crop, the nature of the soil, and\r\nthe quantity of other manures employed. From 1 to 1-1/4 cwt. may be\r\nrecommended as a suitable quantity for corn crops which are otherwise\r\nliberally manured. On strong clay soils this quantity may be judiciously\r\nincreased up to 2 cwt. Dr Bernard Dyer, who has experimented largely on\r\nits use as a manure for mangolds, is of opinion that an application of\r\nfrom 3 to 4 cwt. an acre is likely to prove thoroughly profitable; and\r\nthe present writer has found in his experiments with turnips that a\r\ntop-dressing of 1 cwt. amply repaid itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conclusions drawn._\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the nature and characteristics of nitrate of soda as a\r\nmanure may be briefly summed up as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. It is a whitish, crystalline salt, extremely soluble, and is quickly\r\ndiffused in the soil. It should contain 95 per cent of pure nitrate of\r\nsoda--_i.e._, 15-1/2 per cent of nitrogen, equal to about 19 per cent of\r\nammonia.\r\n\r\n2. Next to sulphate of ammonia, it is the most concentrated nitrogenous\r\nmanure; the relative quantities of nitrogen these two manures contain\r\nbeing as three is to four.\r\n\r\n3. It contains its nitrogen in the most valuable and readily assimilable\r\nform--_i.e._, as _nitric acid_, the form into which all other forms of\r\nnitrogen have first to be converted before they become available for\r\nthe plant's uses.\r\n\r\n4. That, at present market prices, nitrate of soda may be safely\r\naffirmed to be the cheapest form of nitrogenous manure.\r\n\r\n5. That nitrate of soda, in addition to its direct value as a manure,\r\nprobably exercises a slight influence on the mechanical properties of\r\nthe soil, by increasing its compactness and water-absorbing capacities;\r\nthat it further tends to promote deep roots, and thus to increase the\r\nsoil area whence the plant may derive its nourishment, at the same time\r\nrendering the plant more able to withstand the injurious influence of\r\ndrought.\r\n\r\n6. That a plentiful supply of the other manurial constituents should be\r\npresent in the soil, if nitrate of soda is to exercise its full value.\r\n\r\n7. That it may be profitably applied in the case of nearly all kinds of\r\ncrops, but that great care should be taken as to the mode of its\r\napplication. That this should be almost invariably as a top-dressing,\r\nand that it should be applied in several doses if possible.\r\n\r\n8. That its effects can be regarded as lasting only during the first\r\nyear after application.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[202] This substance is also largely known under the name Chili\r\nsaltpetre, to distinguish it from potassium nitrate or common saltpetre.\r\n\r\n[203] See Appendix, p. 351.\r\n\r\n[204] We may remind our readers that these nitrate deposits were largely\r\nthe cause of the late war between Chili and Peru, which resulted in the\r\ncession to Chili by Peru of the province of Tarapaca, where the most\r\nimportant deposits are situated.\r\n\r\n[205] The other nitrate deposits are found in the provinces of\r\nAntofagasta and Atacama, and a certain amount of the refined article is\r\nexported from these places. The amount, however, is inconsiderable as\r\ncompared with that which comes from the province of Tarapaca.\r\n\r\n[206] See his elaborate article on the Geology of Bolivia and Peru,\r\npublished in the 'Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society' for\r\nNovember 1860.\r\n\r\n[207] The source of the boracic acid is probably volcanic.\r\n\r\n[208] A friend of the present writer, who has visited this part of the\r\nwest coast of South America, informs him that at one point of the coast\r\nat Mejillones (in Bolivia) he could trace the remains of no fewer than\r\ntwelve distinct sea-beaches, situated at different distances from the\r\nsea, and rising to an altitude of 2500 feet.\r\n\r\n[209] In this change, lime derived from the sea-shells would play an\r\nimportant part. Modern researches have shown, as we have already said in\r\na previous chapter, that, in the conversion of organic nitrogen into\r\nnitrates, the presence of carbonate of lime is a necessary condition.\r\n\r\n[210] The Gulf weed is an instance in point. Huge masses of floating\r\nsea-weed are sometimes found, 500 to 600 miles in length, forming the\r\nso-called Saragossa Sea.\r\n\r\n[211] A difficulty which has not been referred to is the belief\r\nentertained by geologists that \"there has been a change of climate in\r\nNorthern Chili, and that there must have been more rain there formerly\r\nthan there is at present. Traces of human habitations are found high up\r\nin the Cordilleras to-day. Cobs of Indian corn, axes and knives of\r\ncopper tempered to exceeding sharpness, arrow-heads of agate, even\r\npieces of cloth, are dug up in arid plains now without any trace of\r\nwater for many leagues in or around them\" (Russell, 'The Nitrate-Fields\r\nof Chili,' p. 290).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nNITRATE OF SODA.\r\n\r\n_Total Shipments from South America, 1830-1892._\r\n\r\nYear.

While the plant, no doubt, can absorb its nitrogen in the\r\nform of ammonia,[212] as well as in other forms, as we have already\r\npointed out in previous chapters, it is now fully recognised that\r\nammonia salts, when applied to the soil, are converted into nitrates.\r\nNitric acid, then, must be regarded as the most valuable, inasmuch as it\r\nis the most rapidly assimilated form of nitrogen for the plant; but\r\nnext to nitric acid in value comes ammonia. Of the different forms of\r\nammonia available for manurial purposes, the only one used to a large\r\nextent is sulphate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sources of Sulphate of Ammonia._\r\n\r\nThe oldest, and what is still the chief source of this valuable salt, is\r\nthe gas-works, where it is obtained as one of the bye-products in the\r\nmanufacture of gas. It is also obtained to a lesser extent from shale,\r\niron, coke, and carbonising works. Bones, horn, leather, and certain\r\nother animal substances rich in nitrogen, when subjected to dry\r\ndistillation, as is the case in certain manufactures, such as the\r\nmanufacture of bone-charcoal for use in sugar-refineries, and the\r\ndistillation of horn, &c., in the manufacture of prussiate of potash,\r\nalso constitute less abundant sources.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ammonia from Gas-works._\r\n\r\nCoal contains on an average from a half to one and a half per cent of\r\nnitrogen. When it is subjected to dry distillation, as is done in the\r\ngas-works, the nitrogen which it contains is chiefly converted into\r\nammonia, and, in the process of purification of the gas, is removed in\r\nthe \"gas-liquor,\"[213] which contains about one per cent of ammonia.\r\nThe ammonia recovered from this liquor by distillation is then absorbed\r\nin sulphuric acid. It may be pointed out that nothing like all the\r\nnitrogen contained in the coal is recovered as sulphate of ammonia. It\r\nhas been calculated that only from a fifth to a tenth is actually\r\nrecovered, and many processes have been patented with a view to\r\nincreasing the yield of ammonia in gas manufacture. The total production\r\nof ammonia from gas-works may be placed at little over 100,000 tons per\r\nannum for Great Britain. Mr L. Mond, F.R.S., recently drew attention to\r\nthe possibility of largely increasing our supply of sulphate of ammonia\r\nfrom coal. As indicating what an enormous source of sulphate of ammonia\r\nwe have in coal, Mr Mond calculated that its annual consumption in this\r\ncountry (estimated at 150,000,000 tons) would yield as much as 5,000,000\r\ntons of sulphate of ammonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Sources._\r\n\r\nWhile the ammonia produced in the manufacture of gas has long been\r\ncollected, it is only of recent years that the other sources of ammonia\r\nhave been developed. Next to the gas-works, the shale-works of Scotland\r\nform in this country the chief source of this valuable manure. In these\r\nworks the ammonia is obtained in distilling the paraffin shale by a\r\nmethod somewhat similar to that in use in the gas-works. The amount of\r\nsulphate of ammonia obtained from this source is between 20,000 and\r\n30,000 tons per annum. Recently the ammonia has been recovered from the\r\nblast-furnace gases in iron-works--some 6000 tons being annually\r\nobtained in this way; while from coke and carbonising works the annual\r\nproduction is about half that amount. The combined annual production\r\nfrom all these sources may be put down at 140,000 tons, the total\r\nproduction in Europe being probably little more than 200,000 tons. In\r\nthe Appendix further statistics will be found.[214]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition, &c., of Sulphate of Ammonia._\r\n\r\nPure sulphate of ammonia is a whitish crystalline salt, extremely\r\nsoluble in water. The commercial article, however, is generally greyish\r\nor brownish in colour, owing to the presence of slight quantities of\r\nimpurities. The pure salt should contain 25.75 per cent of ammonia; but\r\nthe commercial article is generally sold on a basis of 24.5 per cent. A\r\nuseful test of its purity is the fact that when subjected to a red-heat\r\nit should almost entirely volatilise, leaving very little residue. The\r\nchief impurities which it is likely to contain are an excess of\r\nmoisture, free acid, or the presence of insoluble matter. Certain\r\nsamples contain small quantities of ammonium sulphocyanate, an extremely\r\npoisonous substance for plants. The presence of this dangerous impurity\r\nis easily detected by adding ferric chloride, which, in presence of the\r\nsulphocyanate, produces a blood-red colour. Sulphate of ammonia is thus\r\nthe most concentrated of all nitrogenous manures in common use, and is\r\nfor that reason the most expensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Application._\r\n\r\nFor this reason, as well as from the fact that it contains a speedily\r\navailable form of nitrogen, sulphate of ammonia should only as a rule be\r\napplied in comparatively small quantities--100 to 125 lb. per acre.[215]\r\nIt should also be applied before, but not too long before, the crop is\r\nlikely to require it. The reason of this is to give it time to be\r\nconverted into nitrates. The ability of the soil to retain ammonia has\r\nalready been pointed out. It is not safe, however, to rely too much on\r\nthe retentive power of the soil for ammonia, the conversion of ammonia\r\ninto nitrates going on very quickly under favourable circumstances. It\r\nis most profitably used as a manure for cereals, and it has been found\r\nby Lawes and Gilbert in their experiments, that an increase of one\r\nbushel of wheat and a corresponding increase of straw have been obtained\r\nfor every 5 lb. of ammonia added to the soil. As has been pointed out in\r\nthe previous chapter, the respective merits of sulphate of ammonia and\r\nnitrate of soda depend largely on the nature of the season during which\r\nthey are used. In wet seasons the sulphate is rather more favourable\r\nthan the nitrate, but, on an average, nitrate of soda is probably the\r\nmore valuable manure--_i.e._, due regard being had to the quantity of\r\nnitrogen the two manures respectively contain. In one respect sulphate\r\nof ammonia is a much more useful manure than nitrate of soda, as the\r\nnature of its action when applied to the soil permits of it being used\r\nas an ingredient of mixed manures.\r\n\r\nLike nitrate of soda, but even to a greater extent, its most favourable\r\naction is obtained when it is applied along with other manurial\r\ningredients. It should be applied at least a month earlier than nitrate.\r\nIt has been shown that in the case of chalky soils a certain loss of\r\nammonia in sulphate of ammonia is apt to take place, due to the action\r\nof the lime; and this leads us to point out that, in preparing mixed\r\nmanures, care ought to be taken that it is not mixed with any compound\r\ncontaining free lime or caustic alkali, as otherwise loss of ammonia\r\nwill ensue. It should never, for example, be used along with basic slag.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[212] From experiments by Lehmann and others with buckwheat and maize,\r\nit would seem that certain plants may prefer, at certain stages of their\r\ngrowth, ammonia to nitrates. In the case of maize, ammonia may be\r\npreferred in the early stages of growth, while nitrates are preferred as\r\nit becomes more mature. In view, however, of our present knowledge of\r\nnitrification, it may well be doubted whether the conclusions arrived at\r\nfrom Lehmann's experiments can be accepted.\r\n\r\n[213] As the expense of converting the ammonia present in the ammoniacal\r\nliquor is considerable, the practice of using the liquor itself as a\r\nmanure has been advocated; but as an objection to this it must be urged\r\nthat, besides being so bulky a manure, the liquor contains various\r\nsubstances poisonous to plant-life.\r\n\r\n[214] See Appendix, p. 358.\r\n\r\n[215] Some crops, however, may with advantage be treated with larger\r\nquantities of sulphate of ammonia, such as mangels and potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE (p. 355).\r\n\r\nThe following table will exhibit the production of sulphate of ammonia\r\nin this country from 1870 to 1892:--\r\n\r\nYear.

Employed first in 1774, their use has\r\nsteadily increased ever since, and their popularity as a phosphatic\r\nmanure is among farmers in this country quite unrivalled. Like guano,\r\nalthough to a less extent, the early practice of using bones has done\r\nmuch to arouse interest in the problems of manuring, and to bring home\r\nto farmers the principles underlying that practice. It was from bones\r\nthat Liebig first made superphosphate of lime, and the distinguished\r\nveteran experimenter, Sir John Bennet Lawes, has told us that the\r\nbenefit accruing from the use of bones on the turnip crop first drew his\r\nattention to the interesting problem connected with the application of\r\nartificial manures. Bones were first used in Yorkshire. Shortly\r\nafterwards they were applied to exhausted pastures in Cheshire. Soon\r\ntheir use became so popular that the home supply was found inadequate;\r\nand they were imported from Germany and Northern Europe, Hull being the\r\nport of disembarkation. So largely were they used by English farmers,\r\nthat Baron Liebig considered it necessary to raise a warning protest\r\nagainst their lavish application. \"England is robbing all other\r\ncountries of the condition of their fertility. Already, in her eagerness\r\nfor bones, she has turned up the battle-fields of Leipzig, of Waterloo,\r\nand of the Crimea; already from the catacombs of Sicily she has carried\r\naway the skeletons of many successive generations. Annually she removes\r\nfrom the shores of other countries to her own the manurial equivalent of\r\nthree millions and a half of men, whom she takes from us the means of\r\nsupporting, and squanders down her sewers to the sea. Like a vampire,\r\nshe hangs upon the neck of Europe--nay, of the entire world!--and sucks\r\nthe heart-blood from nations without a thought of justice towards them,\r\nwithout a shadow of lasting advantage to herself.\"[216]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Different Forms in which Bones are used._\r\n\r\nIt may be pointed out that bones have done much to alter our system of\r\nfarming, by helping to develop turnip culture. Used at first in\r\ncomparatively large pieces, experience gradually showed that a finer\r\nstate of division facilitated their action. Yet it was long before the\r\nprejudice in favour of rough bones disappeared; and it was not till 1829\r\nthat Mr Anderson of Dundee introduced machinery for preparing 1/2-inch\r\nand 1/4-inch bones and bone-dust. In the early days of their use, bones\r\nwere fermented before being used, in order to render their action more\r\nspeedy when applied to the soil; and this practice still obtains to the\r\npresent day in some parts of the country among farmers. This\r\nfermentation was often effected simply by mixing the bones with water,\r\nand allowing the heap to lie for a week or two. In other cases the bones\r\nwere mixed with urine or other refuse matter. The most important step,\r\nhowever, in the history of the treatment of bones for manure was the\r\ndiscovery in 1840, by Liebig, of the action of sulphuric acid on them--a\r\ndiscovery which led to the institution of the manufacture of\r\nsuperphosphate of lime by Sir John Lawes. The nature of this action will\r\nbe explained in the following chapter, so that we need only say here\r\nthat the efficacy of the manure by treatment with sulphuric acid is more\r\nthan doubled. Bones have thus been used, and still are used, in a\r\nvariety of conditions, such as in the raw or green state, bruised,\r\nboiled, steamed, fermented, burned, dissolved, and broken or ground into\r\nvarious states of fineness, to which the names of 1/2-inch, 1/4-inch\r\nbones, bone-meal, bone-dust, and floated bones are given. We shall now\r\nproceed to discuss the composition of bones, and investigate more\r\nexactly the nature of their action.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Bones._\r\n\r\nThe composition of bone-tissue varies considerably, and depends on the\r\nage and kind of animal to which it belongs, as well as to the part of\r\nthe animal frame from which it is taken. Bones are made up of an organic\r\nand an inorganic part. By steeping a piece of bone in a dilute acid\r\nsolution, the inorganic portion of the bone is dissolved out, and the\r\norganic portion, which forms the framework of the bone, is alone left.\r\nOn the other hand, by submitting a bone to the action of great heat, the\r\norganic portion of the bone is driven off, and all that remains is a\r\nquantity of ash. The proportion of the organic to the inorganic matter\r\nvaries considerably in different bones. The bones of young animals\r\ncontain more organic matter than those of old animals. In compact bones,\r\nalso, the organic matter is greater than in spongy bones. The\r\nthigh-bone, of all the bones, contains most inorganic matter. In short,\r\nbones which have to bear the greatest strain are richest in inorganic\r\nmatter. Of the bones of animals, fish-bones exhibit the greatest variety\r\nof composition, some being almost entirely made up of organic matter,\r\nwhile others are similar in their composition to the bones of\r\nquadrupeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Organic Matter of Bones._\r\n\r\nThe organic portion of bones is almost entirely made up of a substance\r\nto which the name _ossein_ has been given, and which, when boiled for a\r\nlong time, is converted into gelatine. This ossein, which forms on an\r\naverage from 25 to 30 per cent of the weight of bones, is extremely rich\r\nin nitrogen, containing over 18 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Inorganic Portion of Bones._\r\n\r\nThe inorganic portion, which forms about 70 per cent, is made up chiefly\r\nof phosphate of lime. The dry leg-bones of oxen and sheep, according to\r\nHeintz, have the following percentage composition:--\r\n\r\n                                 Per cent.\r\nPhosphate of lime                58 to 63\r\nCarbonate of lime                 6 to  7\r\nPhosphate of magnesia             1 to  2\r\nFluoride of calcium                     2\r\nOrganic matter                   25 to 30\r\n\r\nAccording to Payen and Boussingault, raw bones contain 6-1/4 per cent of\r\nnitrogen and 8 per cent of water. Pure bones are thus seen to contain\r\nabout 29 per cent of phosphoric acid and 6-1/4 per cent of nitrogen. The\r\ncomposition of the commercial article, however, differs very widely.\r\nThis is due to the fact that bones collected from India and America,\r\nwhere they have been long exposed to atmospheric influences, have lost\r\nmuch of their organic matter. The amount of sand and earthy impurities\r\nalso varies very considerably.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Treatment of Bones._\r\n\r\nBones are used for the manufacture of glue and gelatine. These are\r\nextracted from them by steaming the bones. The bones after treatment are\r\nused as a manure. The improvement noted in the action of the bones thus\r\ntreated led to the introduction of the use of steamed bones as a manure.\r\nRaw bones are now rarely used. The fat present in raw bones retards\r\ntheir decomposition in the soil. Probably, as has been suggested, it\r\nforms along with lime an insoluble soap which prevents the mineral\r\nmatter in the bone being dissolved by the carbonic acid of the soil. In\r\nthe process of boiling or steaming a certain loss of nitrogen takes\r\nplace, greater or less, according to the length of time they are boiled\r\nor steamed, and in the latter case the pressure applied. A more\r\neconomical method for extracting the fat has been introduced by using\r\nbenzine, but this process is not used to any extent. The loss of\r\nnitrogen in the former case is more than compensated for by their more\r\nspeedy action as a manure when applied to the soil. Bone-meal of good\r\nquality contains from 45 to 55[217] per cent of phosphate of lime, and\r\n3-1/2 per cent of nitrogen. Our present total consumption of bones is\r\nprobably little less than 100,000 tons per annum, of which about half is\r\nobtained from home collections, over 20,000 tons being annually\r\ncollected in and around London alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Action of Bones._\r\n\r\nIt is well known that bones are a slow-acting manure. They may be said\r\nto possess both a mechanical and chemical action when applied to the\r\nsoil. When they putrefy, their nitrogen is slowly converted into\r\nammonia, and carbonic acid as well as various organic acids are formed,\r\nwhich, acting upon the insoluble mineral matter in the bones, renders it\r\navailable for plant uses. Bones thus, when applied in large quantities,\r\nmay not merely act directly as suppliers of plant-food, but in the\r\ncourse of their putrefaction may act upon a certain amount of the inert\r\nfertilising matter of the soil and render it available. The more\r\nreadily, then, bones putrefy, the more speedy will be their effect. As\r\nwe have already pointed out, bones, in order to increase their\r\nefficiency, are often fermented before application. The removal of the\r\nfat is another means of increasing the rate of their action, but the\r\nfineness to which they are ground determines this more than anything\r\nelse. Much ingenuity has been expended in perfecting machinery for\r\ngrinding bones. At one time in Germany they were pounded in stamps\r\nsimilar to those used for ore. In America what has been called \"floated\r\nbone\" has been prepared. This bone is so fine that it actually floats in\r\nthe air like flour-dust, and is made by whirling the bones against one\r\nanother. The action of bones prepared in this way is of course very\r\nspeedy, but the difficulty of applying a manure in such a fine state of\r\ndivision to the soil is great. The expense of the process also is\r\nconsiderable.\r\n\r\nThe ease with which bones when ground into a fine state of division\r\nputrefy, is evidenced by the fact that bone-flour has to be salted in\r\norder to enable it to keep. Another condition which determines the rate\r\nat which the fertilising matters in bones become available is the nature\r\nof the soil. Fermentation, as we have already seen, requires a plentiful\r\nsupply of air, and a certain amount, but not too much, of moisture.\r\nConsequently bones act best in medium soils--soils which are \"neither\r\ntoo light and dry, nor too close and wet.\" There can be no doubt that\r\nwhat gives to bones a peculiar value in the eyes of the farmer is the\r\nfact that they form a manure of a lasting character. They give what has\r\nbeen termed backbone to a soil. But the tendency of modern agricultural\r\npractice is to use quick-acting manures rather than slow. This has been\r\nadmirably put by Professor Storer in the following words: \"The old\r\nnotion, that those manures are best which make themselves felt through a\r\nlong series of years, is now recognised to be an error. The adage, that\r\n'one cannot eat the cake and have the cake' is conspicuously true in\r\nagriculture; and just as it is the part of prudence in household or\r\nmaritime economy to abstain from laying in at any one time more\r\nprovisions than can be properly disposed of in a year or during a\r\nvoyage, so should the farmer refrain from bringing to the land an\r\nunnecessary excess of plant-food. Such food is liable to spoil withal\r\nin the soil, as well as other kinds of provisions that are kept too long\r\nin store. A just proportion of food, properly prepared, is the point to\r\nbe aimed at always.\"\r\n\r\nIn view, therefore, of what has just been said, it might seem best to\r\nuse bones in the form in which they are most speedily available--viz.,\r\nas dissolved bones. This would be so if bones were the only source we\r\npossessed for the manufacture of superphosphate of lime; but we now\r\nhave, in the various mineral phosphates, abundant and cheaper sources of\r\nthis valuable manure. The opinion of leading agriculturists and\r\nagricultural chemists is rather in favour of applying bones in the\r\nundissolved condition. For one thing, it seems far from economical to\r\nutilise an expensive material such as bones for manufacturing an article\r\nwhich can be equally well manufactured from cheaper materials; for once\r\nthe phosphate of lime is dissolved, it is equally valuable from whatever\r\nsource it may be derived. Of course this is not tantamount to saying\r\nthat dissolved bones as a manure are no more valuable than\r\nsuperphosphate. In dissolved bones we have, in addition to soluble\r\nphosphate, a considerable proportion of undissolved bone-tissue,\r\ncontaining a certain quantity of nitrogen and organic matter; but so far\r\nas the soluble phosphate is concerned, it seems only rational to\r\nconclude that its efficacy is equally great, whether it be derived from\r\nbone or mineral phosphate. Another reason is, that much of the\r\ncharacteristic action of bones is lost by treating them with sulphuric\r\nacid. As Dr Aitken has pointed out, the germ life in the soil and in the\r\nbones gradually converts them into a form available for the nourishment\r\nof plants; but to dissolve bones with sulphuric acid is to kill out the\r\ngerm life and retard the decay of any nucleus of bone in the dissolved\r\nmanure.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dissolved Bones._\r\n\r\nDissolved bones, however, are still manufactured. Formerly the manure\r\ncalled dissolved bones was often a mixture of mineral superphosphate\r\nalong with undissolved bone-meal, but recent legislation has stopped the\r\ncontinuance of this practice. The composition of dissolved bones varies\r\nsomewhat, the percentage of soluble phosphate being about 20 to 23 per\r\ncent, the insoluble amounting to from 9 to 10 per cent, and the nitrogen\r\nfrom 2-1/2 to 3-1/2 per cent.[218] Another reason against dissolving\r\nbones is to be found in the difficulty experienced in dissolving their\r\nphosphate. Bones, especially when raw, are not easily acted upon by\r\nacids.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Crops suited for Bones._\r\n\r\nBones are commonly regarded as being specially beneficial to\r\npasture-land, to which they are applied as a top-dressing. Turnips,\r\ntobacco, potatoes, vines, and hops are also much benefited by the\r\napplication of bones. In America, mixed with wood-ashes (the chief\r\nmanurial constituent of which is potash), they have been extensively\r\nused as a substitute for farmyard manure, and have been applied at the\r\nrate of 5 to 6 cwt. per acre. In Saxony, according to Professor Storer,\r\n1 cwt. of fine bone-meal is worth as much as 25 to 30 cwt. of farmyard\r\nmanure.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bone-ash._\r\n\r\nThe ash which is left on burning bones used to be an article of\r\nconsiderable manurial importance. It is still imported from South\r\nAmerica in some quantity, and is used chiefly in the pottery industry.\r\nIt is occasionally still used to a limited extent for the manufacture of\r\nhigh-class superphosphates. It is extremely rich in phosphate of lime,\r\nof which it contains between 70 and 80 per cent; but of course it is\r\ndevoid of nitrogen.[219] Bone-ash is best used in the dissolved form, as\r\nit possesses no characteristic action such as is possessed by bones.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bone-char or Bone-black._\r\n\r\nWhen heated in a closed retort, bones are not converted into bone-ash,\r\nbut into a body called bone-char. This body is similar in composition to\r\nbone-ash, except for a certain percentage of charcoal--amounting, on an\r\naverage, to 10 per cent. It contains but little nitrogen and other\r\norganic matter. Bone-black or bone-char is an article which is prepared\r\nin enormous quantities for use in sugar-refineries, where it is used in\r\nthe purification of sugar. After use it may be renovated by submitting\r\nit to heat; but as this process gradually lessens the percentage of\r\ncarbon it contains, after a certain period it becomes too poor in this\r\nsubstance for efficiently acting as a filter. When this takes place it\r\nis technically known as spent char, and is used for the manufacture of\r\nsuperphosphates.

In Chapter V., where we discussed the position of\r\nphosphoric acid in agriculture, it was pointed out that mineral\r\nphosphates were very abundant, and that large deposits of them were\r\nfound in many parts of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coprolites._\r\n\r\nReference may first be made to the so-called coprolites or phosphatic\r\nnodules which have been found in great abundance in the greensand\r\nformation, in the crag of the eastern counties, and in the chalk\r\nformation of the southern counties. These coprolites are rounded\r\nnodules, and are composed of the fossil excrements and remains of\r\nancient animals. They are found in large quantities in Cambridgeshire,\r\nand were discovered by Dr Buckland many years ago. The history of their\r\ndiscovery is not a little curious. The manurial properties of\r\nroad-scrapings in parts of Cambridgeshire were noticed, and on being\r\nexamined were found to be in part composed of phosphate of lime, derived\r\nfrom phosphatic nodules dug out of the underlying greensand, and used\r\nfor the purpose of repairing roads. Professor Henslow first drew\r\nattention to them at a meeting of the British Association held in\r\nCambridge in 1845, and pointed out that they contained about 60 per cent\r\nof phosphate of lime. They were also found in enormous quantities in\r\nSuffolk, Norfolk, Bedfordshire, and Essex, and were for a long time\r\nlargely used in the manufacture of superphosphate, but of late years\r\nhave not been used to anything like the same extent, owing to the fact\r\nthat there are richer and cheaper sources of phosphate of lime\r\navailable. In 1887 about 20,000 tons of coprolites were raised. The\r\nrichest were those obtained in Cambridge, while those got from\r\nBedfordshire were about the poorest. Deposits have also been found in\r\nFrance and other countries. The average amount of phosphate of lime in\r\nEnglish coprolites is between 50 and 60 per cent, while the French\r\ncontain about 45 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Canadian Apatite or Phosphorite._\r\n\r\nWe have already referred in Chapter V. to large deposits of apatite or\r\nphosphorite found in Canada. The Canadian mines commenced to be worked\r\nabout fifteen years ago, and the output now amounts to nearly 25,000\r\ntons per annum.[221] A portion of this goes to the United States; the\r\nrest, amounting to about 20,000 tons, being shipped to England, whence\r\nit is again exported to Hamburg and other places.[222] It contains from\r\n70 to 80 per cent of phosphate. Deposits are also found at Estremadura\r\nin Spain, and in Norway.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Estremadura or Spanish Phosphates._\r\n\r\nLarge deposits of phosphate have long been known to exist at Estremadura\r\nin Spain, and the mines at Caceres have been worked on a large scale for\r\nseventeen years, and about half a million tons have been raised. In 1882\r\nthe imports into this country amounted to over 56,000 tons; but latterly\r\nthey have only been about a fourth of this amount. Dr Dauberry visited\r\nthe deposits in 1843, and wrote a most interesting account of them. They\r\ndo not seem, however, to have been imported for purposes of\r\nsuperphosphate manufacture till a number of years afterwards. Of\r\nEstremadura phosphate there are three classes, containing respectively\r\n50, 60, and 70 per cent of phosphate of lime, the lowest quality being\r\nthe commonest.[223]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Norwegian Apatite._\r\n\r\nThis apatite has ceased to be imported of late years, owing to a duty on\r\nexportation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Charleston or South Carolina Phosphate._\r\n\r\nFor a number of years these deposits have formed the chief source of\r\nphosphate of lime used in the manufacture of mineral superphosphates in\r\nthis country (in fact they have furnished two-thirds of our phosphate\r\nsupply during recent years). Discovered twenty-five years ago, some four\r\nto five million tons have already been shipped. About half a million\r\ntons were raised in 1886 from these mines, which are the most abundant\r\nin the world. There are two kinds--the so-called \"land\" and \"river\"\r\nphosphates. The former contains more oxide of iron and alumina, and is\r\ntherefore less pure than the latter, in which the iron and alumina do\r\nnot exceed 2 per cent. The river phosphate is dredged from the Bull,\r\nCoosaw, and Beaufort rivers. Of phosphate of lime it contains from 50 to\r\n60 per cent. It is generally sold in three grades--50 to 52 per cent, 55\r\nto 56 per cent, and 58 to 60 per cent of phosphate of lime. It will thus\r\nbe seen to be incapable of producing very high-class superphosphates\r\n--_i.e._, containing more than 30 per cent \"soluble\" phosphate.\r\nThis point will be more intelligible when we describe the manufacture of\r\nsuperphosphate. The demand for these phosphates in the United States has\r\nincreased enormously in recent years, owing to the increase in the\r\nquantity of manure used.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Belgian Phosphate._\r\n\r\nAnother very important source of mineral phosphates are deposits\r\ndiscovered some years ago in Belgium near Mons. These phosphates are of\r\ndifferent qualities, and are found, some in layers near the surface in\r\npockets forming the richest class, and containing from 45 to 65 per cent\r\nof phosphate, and some in the form of a friable phosphatic rock, the\r\nso-called _craie-grise_ (phosphatic chalk), containing from 25 to 35 per\r\ncent of phosphate of lime. The higher quality of Belgian phosphate is\r\npretty well exhausted, and it is the second class that forms the bulk of\r\nthe ordinary Belgian phosphate at present exported. The commercial\r\narticle contains about 35 to 40 per cent of phosphate, and about 45 per\r\ncent of carbonate of lime. The fact of its poor quality, together with\r\nthe large percentage of carbonate of lime it contains, renders its\r\nadoption alone in the manufacture of superphosphate unsuitable. Attempts\r\nhave been made to get rid of a portion of this carbonate of lime and to\r\nraise the percentage of phosphate. For this purpose the phosphate has\r\nbeen calcined, but this was soon found to be a great mistake. Other\r\nmeans have been adopted, with the result that the percentage has been\r\nincreased to 50 per cent. It is consequently used in small quantities\r\nas a drier, for which it is peculiarly suited on account of its\r\ncarbonaceous nature, along with the higher-class phosphates. In the year\r\n1886 about 145,000 tons of this phosphate were raised, of which about\r\n45,000 tons were imported into the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Somme Phosphate._\r\n\r\nStill more recently a discovery of phosphate deposits has been made in\r\nthe Somme and Pas de Calais departments in the north of France,\r\nadjoining, and similar in character to, the Belgian deposits. The only\r\ndifference between Belgian and French phosphates is, that the latter is\r\nof a higher quality, and contains from 50 to 80 per cent of phosphate of\r\nlime. A very large demand for these phosphates sprang up, and in 1888,\r\nalthough they had only been worked for some two years, no less than\r\n150,000 tons had been raised, of which about one-half contained from 70\r\nto upwards of 75 per cent. There are four grades in the market,\r\ncontaining 55 to 60, 60 to 65, 70 to 75, and 75 to 80 per cent of\r\nphosphate of lime. The highest quality furnishes the chief material for\r\nthe manufacture of high-grade superphosphates.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Florida Phosphate._[224]\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years large quantities of phosphates have been\r\nimported from Florida. These are of different qualities, the land rocks\r\nnow imported containing from 70 to 80 per cent of phosphate of lime, and\r\nthe river phosphate about 60 per cent. The latter class are similar in\r\ncomposition to the best South Carolina river-phosphates, which they much\r\nresemble.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lahn Phosphate._\r\n\r\nPhosphate deposits were found at Nassau in Germany in 1864; but as the\r\nphosphate contained a considerable proportion of iron and alumina, they\r\nare not used in this country now, although they are in Germany for\r\ndouble superphosphate manufacture.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bordeaux or French Phosphate._\r\n\r\nSimilar in quality to Lahn phosphate is that obtained in the\r\nneighbourhood of Bordeaux.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Algerian Phosphate._\r\n\r\nExcellent phosphates are now being sent from Algeria--some cargoes being\r\nas rich as 70 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Crust Guanos._\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to the guanos in the chapter on Guano. They are\r\nalso known under the name of Caribbean phosphates, and come from the\r\nWest India Islands. The chief kinds are Aruba, Curacao, Sombrero, and\r\nNavassa, the Great Cayman, Redonda, and Alta Vela. Most of them are of\r\nhigh quality, containing from 60 to 80 per cent of phosphate, and are\r\nthus suited for the manufacture of high-class superphosphates. Some of\r\nthem, however, contain a considerable proportion of iron and alumina,\r\nand are not suitable for this purpose. The Redonda and Alta Vela\r\nphosphates consist chiefly of phosphate of alumina.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Value of Mineral Phosphates as a Manure._\r\n\r\nWhile it is commonly regarded as unadvisable to use mineral phosphates\r\ndirectly as phosphatic manures, it may well be questioned how far such\r\nan opinion is warranted by actual experience. Professor Jamieson of\r\nAberdeen, in his interesting and valuable experiments, has drawn\r\nattention to the fact that coprolites in a fine state of division are an\r\nextremely valuable source of phosphoric acid for crops, and are a more\r\nquickly available source than is commonly supposed. Experiments\r\nconducted elsewhere with ground coprolites and other mineral phosphates\r\ncorroborate Professor Jamieson's conclusions. The successful use of\r\nThomas-phosphate has drawn attention to the possibility of profitably\r\napplying undissolved mineral phosphate to the soil; and no doubt the\r\npractice may in future years be increased. At present, however, with the\r\nexception of Thomas-phosphate, mineral phosphates alone are used for\r\nconversion into superphosphate.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[221] Since the discovery of the Florida deposits of phosphate, the\r\nworking of the Canadian mines has been practically abandoned.\r\n\r\n[222] See Appendix, p. 381.\r\n\r\n[223] These phosphates are now no longer worked.\r\n\r\n[224] These deposits were discovered a few years ago; and as they are of\r\nconsiderable extent and high quality, have entirely revolutionised the\r\nphosphate market. About 300,000 tons are now annually raised in\r\nFlorida.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE (p. 375).\r\n\r\nTHE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE IMPORTS OF PHOSPHATES INTO THE UNITED\r\nKINGDOM, AND THE COUNTRIES OF PRODUCTION, DURING THE YEARS 1885-92.\r\n\r\n-----------------------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+\r\n                       |  1885.  |  1886.  |  1887.  |  1888.  |  1889.  |\r\n-----------------------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+\r\n                       |  Tons.  |  Tons.  |  Tons.  |  Tons.  |  Tons.  |\r\n United States         | 138,844 | 144,623 | 165,275 | 111,369 | 122,554 |\r\n Canada                |  21,484 |  18,069 |  19,194 |  12,423 |  23,297 |\r\n Dutch West Indies     |         |         |         |         |         |\r\n  (Curacao, Aruba)     |  11,588 |  12,581 |   9,505 |  10,736 |  14,730 |\r\n British West Indies   |         |         |         |         |         |\r\n  (Sombrero, &c.)      |   7,727 |   3,351 |   6,451 |  11,010 |   1,880 |\r\n Spain and Portugal    |  19,282 |   5,825 |  15,612 |   6,978 |   1,326 |\r\n Belgium               |  35,405 |  31,551 |  45,322 |  54,261 |  64,643 |\r\n Holland               |     865 |   2,194 |   4,778 |   4,137 |   2,270 |\r\n France                |   2,276 |   1,503 |  11,140 |  39,059 |  65,490 |\r\n Australia             |     -   |     200 |     350 |     -   |   1,250 |\r\n Germany               |     704 |     -   |     -   |     -   |     -   |\r\n Hayti (San Domingo)   |     -   |   2,175 |   3,044 |   6,238 |   4,094 |\r\n Brazil                |     -   |     -   |   1,200 |     -   |     -   |\r\n Venezuela and Guiana  |     -   |     -   |     405 |     -   |     -   |\r\n Norway                |     -   |     -   |     -   |     -   |     -   |\r\n Other countries       |     397 |   1,039 |   1,139 |   1,675 |     390 |\r\n                       |         |         |         |         |         |\r\n  *Florida phosphate.  |     -   |     -   |     -   |     -   |     -   |\r\n   Carolina phosphate. |     -   |     -   |     -   |     -   |     -   |\r\n-----------------------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+\r\n\r\n-----------------------+---------+----------+----------\r\n                       |  1890.  |   1891.  |   1892.\r\n-----------------------+---------+----------+----------\r\n                       |  Tons.  |   Tons.  |   Tons.\r\n United States         | 177,283 | *131,084 | *201,465\r\n Canada                |  21,089 |   15,918 |    7,814\r\n Dutch West Indies     |         |          |\r\n  (Curacao, Aruba)     |  14,763 |    8,851 |    6,648\r\n British West Indies   |         |          |\r\n  (Sombrero, &c.)      |   3,970 |    1,960 |    2,473\r\n Spain and Portugal    |     -   |      320 |      971\r\n Belgium               |  82,096 |   70,723 |   65,079\r\n Holland               |   2,428 |    3,434 |    6,627\r\n France                |  35,659 |   18,325 |   18,239\r\n Australia             |     -   |      -   |      -\r\n Germany               |     -   |      -   |      -\r\n Hayti (San Domingo)   |    992  |    1,639 |    2,965\r\n Brazil                |    -    |      -   |      -\r\n Venezuela and Guiana  |    -    |      540 |      -\r\n Norway                |   4,151 |    1,495 |      305\r\n Other countries       |   1,070 |    1,483 |    1,594\r\n                       |         |          |\r\n  *Florida phosphate.  |     -   |   35,203 |   66,327\r\n   Carolina phosphate. |     -   |   96,881 |  135,138\r\n-----------------------+---------+----------+----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPERPHOSPHATES.\r\n\r\nAs was mentioned in the chapter on Bones, Liebig in the year 1840\r\ndiscovered that the effect of adding oil of vitriol, or sulphuric acid,\r\nto bones was to render the phosphate they contain soluble. This\r\ndiscovery marked an epoch in the history of artificial manures, and laid\r\nthe foundation of the now enormous manufacture of superphosphate. In\r\n1862 the juries of the London International Exhibition published an\r\nelaborate report containing an interesting article on the manure trade\r\nof Great Britain, in which it was stated that the annual quantity of\r\nsuperphosphate then made amounted to from 150,000 to 200,000 tons. Now\r\nit may be placed not far short of a million tons. Probably that made in\r\nthe United States is considerably more. In the first instance,\r\nsuperphosphate was manufactured by Sir John Lawes from spent bone-char.\r\nThis was superseded by coprolites and Estremadura phosphorite, Suffolk\r\ncoprolites being for many years the chief material employed. This in\r\nturn was succeeded by the richer Cambridge coprolites, but of late years\r\ncoprolites have practically ceased to be a source of superphosphate, the\r\nother mineral phosphates mentioned in the previous chapter--such as the\r\nSouth Carolina, Belgian, Somme, &c., phosphates--taking their place.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Manufacture of Superphosphate._\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of superphosphate is of too technical a nature to permit\r\nof discussion in a work of this kind. It is important, however, that the\r\ngeneral principles underlying the process of manufacture and the\r\nchemical changes in the phosphate taking place during the process be\r\nclearly understood. In the first place, great importance attaches in the\r\nmanufacture of the superphosphate to the fineness of division of the raw\r\nmaterial, and much ingenuity has been spent on apparatus designed for\r\nthis purpose. The difficulty of grinding the phosphate varies, of\r\ncourse, with the nature of the material used--apatite, for example,\r\nbeing much more difficult to reduce to the necessary fineness than\r\nphosphatic guano. The finer the state of division, the more complete\r\nwill be the decomposition of the phosphate by the acid. Mr Warington\r\nrecommends that for first-class work the powder should be so fine as to\r\nadmit of it passing through a sieve of eighty wires to the inch. After\r\nthe phosphate is reduced to powder, it is mixed with acid. This takes\r\nplace in the mixer, which is generally in the form of an iron cylinder\r\nfurnished in the centre with a revolving shaft, the sulphuric acid used\r\nbeing the ordinary chamber acid (sp. gr. 1.57). Whatever strength of\r\nacid is used, there must be a certain quantity of water present to form\r\ngypsum. It is to the formation of gypsum in the resulting product that\r\nthe dryness of the superphosphate is due. The proportion of sulphuric\r\nacid used depends on the composition of the phosphate; and here it may\r\nbe pointed out that the presence of much carbonate of lime is a most\r\nimportant factor in determining the quantity of acid required. The\r\nreason of this is, that where carbonate and phosphate of lime are\r\npresent together, sulphuric acid first acts upon the carbonate, and it\r\nis not till this is wholly decomposed that the phosphate can be acted\r\nupon. Hence mineral phosphates with a large percentage of carbonate of\r\nlime do not constitute such an economical material for the manufacture\r\nof superphosphate as those in which the percentage of carbonate is\r\nsmall.[225] A certain amount of heat is necessary for the purpose of\r\nenabling a quick decomposition to take place. For this purpose the\r\nsulphuric acid added has been previously heated. In the ordinary\r\nmanufacture of superphosphate, however, this is not considered\r\nnecessary, as the heat developed by the chemical action between the\r\nphosphate and the acid is sufficiently great. The phosphate, after being\r\nthoroughly mixed with the acid, is discharged into what is technically\r\nknown as the pit, a chamber built of brick or concrete. The mixture,\r\nwhich is in a fluid state when it enters the pit, very soon hardens, and\r\nis dug out in a day or two. It is next reduced to powder in a\r\ndisintegrator, and is then ready for use as a manure.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nature of the Reaction taking place._\r\n\r\nIn order to clearly understand the nature of the reaction which takes\r\nplace when sulphuric acid is added to a phosphatic material, it may be\r\nwell to say a word or two on the composition of the different compounds\r\nof lime and phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Phosphates of Lime._\r\n\r\nIn the various phosphatic manures used in agriculture there are four\r\ndifferent kinds of phosphates. In the commonest form, popularly called\r\nbone-phosphate, which is the form in which lime and phosphoric acid are\r\ncombined in bones, guano, and the ordinary mineral phosphates, the lime\r\nand phosphoric acid are combined in the form of what is known as\r\ntribasic phosphate of lime, or tricalcic phosphate--that is to say, for\r\nevery equivalent of phosphoric acid there are three equivalents of lime.\r\nThis may be represented as follows:--\r\n\r\nLime }\r\nLime >  Phosphoric acid.\r\nLime }\r\n\r\nOr we may also say that for every 142 parts by weight of phosphoric acid\r\nthere are 168 parts by weight of lime in this form of phosphate. This is\r\nthe least soluble form of phosphoric acid,[226] and is the form\r\ngenerally referred to in commercial analyses as insoluble phosphate.\r\nWhen this phosphate is acted upon with sulphuric acid, a soluble\r\nphosphate is formed, as Liebig first showed, to which the name\r\nsuperphosphate has been given, and which is also known as monobasic\r\nphosphate of lime, or monocalcic phosphate. This compound may be\r\nrepresented as containing, instead of three equivalents of lime, only\r\none, the other two equivalents being replaced by water. This compound\r\nmay be represented as follows:--\r\n\r\nLime  }\r\nWater >  Phosphoric acid.\r\nWater }\r\n\r\nIn it, for every 142 parts of phosphoric acid, there are only 56 parts\r\nof lime. It is soluble in water, and gives to the commercial article\r\nknown as superphosphate of lime its value. Intermediate in composition\r\nbetween these two phosphates there is another known as precipitated\r\nphosphate of lime, or dicalcic phosphate (the same as reverted\r\nphosphate), which contains two equivalents of lime and one equivalent of\r\nwater as follows:--\r\n\r\nLime  }\r\nLime  >  Phosphoric acid.\r\nWater }\r\n\r\nThis compound contains, for every 142 parts of phosphoric acid, 112\r\nparts of lime; and in solubility occupies an intermediate position.\r\nLastly, there is a fourth compound of lime and phosphoric acid, which\r\nonly occurs in one phosphatic manure--viz., phosphatic slag, in which\r\nindeed it was first discovered--which consists of four equivalents of\r\nlime to one of phosphoric acid, to which the name tetrabasic phosphate\r\nof lime or tetracalcic phosphate has been given. Its composition may be\r\nillustrated as follows:--\r\n\r\nLime  }\r\nLime  >  Phosphoric acid.\r\nLime  >\r\nLime  }\r\n\r\nOr, for every 142 parts of phosphoric acid, there are 224 parts of lime.\r\nContrary to what we might expect, this phosphate is less insoluble than\r\nthe ordinary tribasic or bone phosphate. This may be owing to the fact\r\nthat, in the tetrabasic phosphate, there is more lime present than that\r\nwhich the phosphoric acid can retain with strong chemical affinity.[227]\r\nIn the manufacture of superphosphate the tribasic phosphate is converted\r\ninto the soluble phosphate--the lime, which was formerly in combination\r\nwith the phosphoric acid, uniting with the sulphuric acid, and forming\r\ngypsum.[228] It was till recently supposed that soluble phosphate and\r\ngypsum were the only two resulting products of this decomposition. It\r\nhas been recently shown, however, by Ruffle and others, that this is\r\nnot, strictly speaking, the case, and that probably a large proportion\r\nof free phosphoric acid is formed; in fact, it seems probable that in\r\nthe first stage of the reaction, only phosphoric acid is produced, and\r\nthat this subsequently acts upon the undecomposed phosphate, with the\r\nproduction of monocalcic phosphate.[229] The amount of sulphuric acid\r\nwhich experience has shown it is necessary to add for the successful and\r\neconomical manufacture of superphosphate, depends on the composition of\r\nthe raw material employed. The larger the percentage of tribasic\r\nphosphate, the larger the quantity of sulphuric acid required for its\r\ndecomposition; but sometimes even a poor phosphate consumes a large\r\namount of sulphuric acid. This is the case where much calcium carbonate\r\nor fluoride is present in the raw phosphate, as both of these compounds\r\nrequire a quantity of acid for their decomposition, which takes place\r\nbefore the decomposition of the phosphate. Hence phosphates rich in\r\ncarbonate of lime are not well suited as economical materials from which\r\nto manufacture superphosphate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reverted Phosphates._\r\n\r\nA change which is apt to take place in superphosphate after its\r\nmanufacture is what is known as reversion of the soluble phosphate. Thus\r\nit is found that on keeping superphosphate for a long time the\r\npercentage of soluble phosphate becomes less than it was at first. The\r\nrate at which this deterioration of the superphosphate goes on varies in\r\ndifferent samples. In a well-made article it is practically\r\ninappreciable, whereas in some superphosphates, made from unsuitable\r\nmaterials, it may amount to a considerable percentage. The causes of\r\nthis reversion are twofold. For one thing, the presence of undecomposed\r\nphosphate of lime may cause it. This source of reversion, however, is\r\nvery much less important than the other, which is the presence of iron\r\nand alumina in the raw material. When a soluble phosphate reverts, what\r\ntakes place is the conversion of the monocalcic phosphate into the\r\ndicalcic. Now in the first case, where reversion is due to the presence\r\nof undecomposed phosphate, the action taking place may be represented as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\nLime }                     }     { lime }                  }\r\nLime } phosphoric acid     }     { water} phosphoric acid  }\r\nLime }                     }  +  { water}                  } =\r\n(One molecule of insoluble }     { (One molecule of soluble}\r\n    phosphate)             }     {     phosphate)          }\r\n\r\nLime }                     }     { lime }\r\nLime } phosphoric acid     }     { lime } phosphoric acid.\r\nWater}                     }  +  { water}\r\n(One molecule of reverted  }     { (One molecule of reverted\r\n    phosphate)             }     {     phosphate.)\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned, however, that reversion from this cause probably\r\ntakes place to a very slight extent in practice.[230] Where reversion is\r\ndue to the presence of iron and alumina in the raw material, the nature\r\nof the reaction is not well understood, and is consequently not so\r\neasily demonstrated as in the former case. Where iron is present in the\r\nform of pyrites, or ferrous silicate, it does not seem to cause\r\nreversion. It is only when it is present in the form of oxide--and in\r\nmost raw phosphatic materials it is generally in this latter\r\nform[231]--that it causes reversion in the phosphate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Value of reverted Phosphate._\r\n\r\nThe value of reverted phosphate is a subject which has given rise to\r\nmuch dispute among chemists. That it has a higher value than the\r\nordinary insoluble phosphate is now admitted; but in this country, in\r\nthe manure trade, this is not as yet recognised. At first it was thought\r\nthat it was impossible to estimate its quantity by chemical analysis.\r\nThis difficulty, however, has been overcome, and it is generally\r\nadmitted that the ammonium citrate process furnishes an accurate means\r\nof determining its amount. Both on the Continent and in the United\r\nStates reverted phosphate is recognised as possessing a monetary value\r\nin excess of that possessed by the ordinary insoluble phosphate. The\r\nresult is, that raw phosphates containing iron and alumina to any\r\nappreciable extent are not used in this country, although they do find a\r\nlimited application in America and on the Continent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Superphosphates._\r\n\r\nSuperphosphates as manufactured may be divided, generally speaking, into\r\nthree classes--viz., low class, medium, and high class. The ordinary or\r\nmedium class contains from 25 to 27 per cent of soluble phosphate; and\r\nhere it may be pointed out that by soluble phosphate is meant the\r\npercentage of tribasic phosphate which has been dissolved--not, as might\r\nat first sight be supposed, the percentage of monocalcic phosphate. The\r\nlower-class superphosphates are those containing less than 25 per cent,\r\ngenerally 23 to 25 per cent, of soluble phosphate; while the high-class\r\nsuperphosphate may contain from 30 to 45 per cent. For the manufacture\r\nof high-class superphosphate only a certain number of raw phosphates are\r\navailable, such as Curacao and Somme phosphates, phosphatic guanos,\r\nbone-char, &c. Certain processes have been patented for the manufacture\r\nof even more concentrated superphosphates, and by them phosphates\r\ncontaining as much as 40 per cent of soluble phosphoric acid--_i.e._,\r\nequal to 87 per cent of soluble phosphate--have been prepared. To this\r\nclass belongs the so-called double superphosphate, manufactured at\r\nWetzlar in Germany. Such a concentrated form of manure is naturally very\r\nexpensive to manufacture, and is hardly to be recommended for home\r\nconsumption. Where, however, manures have to be conveyed long distances,\r\nand the freight is consequently very high, such a concentrated article\r\nmay be found most economical.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Action of Superphosphates._\r\n\r\nWhen superphosphate is applied to the soil it is converted into an\r\ninsoluble state. In short, the process of reversion is carried on on a\r\nwholesale scale. This is due to the lime, iron, and alumina salts which\r\nthe soil contains. In all probability the phosphate is finally converted\r\ninto a hydrated ferric or aluminic phosphate, in which form it is\r\ngradually acted upon by the sap of the plant-roots as required. This\r\nbeing the case, it may be asked, Why is superphosphate so much more\r\nrapid in its action than insoluble phosphate; or why should we be at the\r\ntrouble and expense of dissolving the phosphate if it has to become\r\ninsoluble again in the soil? This question is one of very great\r\nimportance, for the answer to it furnishes, in our opinion, the key to\r\nthe whole phosphate question. When superphosphate is added to the soil,\r\nbeing soluble in water, it is soon dissolved and carried down by the\r\nrain into its pores, and becomes thoroughly mixed with the\r\nsoil-particles. It is thus soon fixed in the soil, beyond the risk of\r\nbeing washed away. The result is, that the phosphate is obtained in a\r\nstate of division infinitely more minute than could ever be obtained by\r\nmechanical grinding, and is, further, most intimately mixed with the\r\nparticles of the soil. It is this intimate mixture of the phosphate with\r\nthe particles of the soil, and its minute state of division, that\r\nconstitute the only reason for rendering superphosphate superior in its\r\naction to even the most finely ground insoluble phosphates. This opinion\r\nis supported by the fact, that although the chemist has imitated nature\r\nin this matter so far as to manufacture precipitated phosphate, he has\r\nfailed, as a rule, in getting as favourable results with it as with\r\nsuperphosphate. Although the mechanical state of division of the\r\nmanufactured precipitated phosphate is probably as fine as that\r\nobtained by nature from the superphosphate, it is impossible to obtain\r\nso intimate a mixture with the soil-particles, and hence the results\r\nobtained are different. For these reasons it will be easily seen that\r\nthe rate of action of the superphosphate must always be quicker than\r\nthat of any other form of phosphatic manure. The phosphate is everywhere\r\ndistributed in the soil. The plant-roots are thus furnished with a\r\ncontinuous supply throughout their growth, and micro-organisms, which\r\nrequire for their development a supply of this necessary plant-food, are\r\npropagated. A regularity in the plant's growth is thus secured, which is\r\nof great importance. But while admitting this, there are many cases in\r\nwhich this greater quickness of action does not render soluble phosphate\r\nthe most economical form. The nature of the crop, as well as the nature\r\nof the soil, may in many cases be such as to render the application of\r\nthe cheaper insoluble phosphate more economical. It is imperative that\r\nthe early growth of some crops be hastened as much as possible by a\r\nready supply of easily assimilable plant-food, in order to enable them\r\nto successfully sustain the attack of certain pests to which they are\r\nliable to succumb. This, for example, is notably the case with turnips.\r\nIn such a case there can be no doubt that the value of soluble phosphate\r\nto the young plants is very great, as it enables them to survive this\r\ncritical period.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Action of Superphosphate sometimes unfavourable._\r\n\r\nBut even in this case there may be other conditions which render\r\ninsoluble phosphate a preferable manure. Such a case is where the soil\r\nis of a very light nature and is deficient in lime. In this case the\r\nacid superphosphate, not having the necessary base to combine with, may\r\nprove even hurtful to the young plants. According to the late Dr\r\nVoelcker, a concentrated superphosphate may produce a smaller crop than\r\na fertiliser containing only a quarter as much soluble phosphoric acid,\r\nwhen applied to root-crops on sandy soils, greatly deficient in lime.\r\nCases such as the above, however, are extremely rare; and we may say\r\nthat, in the case of root-crops generally, superphosphate must be\r\nregarded as of special value.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Application of Superphosphate._\r\n\r\nIn any case, superphosphate ought to be applied to a soil some time\r\nbefore it is likely to be assimilated by the plant, in order to allow\r\nneutralisation of its acid character to be fully effected before the\r\nplant's roots come in contact with it. Thus Professor S. W. Johnson, one\r\nof the greatest living American authorities, states it as his opinion\r\nthat recent investigations tend to show that soluble and reverted (or\r\nprecipitated) phosphates are, upon the whole, about equally valuable as\r\nplant-food, and of nearly equal commercial value. But as Sir John Lawes,\r\nin quoting Professor Johnson to the above effect, remarks, this opinion\r\nis based on an experience of American agriculture, in which country\r\nsoluble phosphate is chiefly applied to cereal crops, while in this\r\ncountry it is chiefly applied to turnips. In the case of cereal crops,\r\nthe importance of a speedy early growth is not so great, as we have\r\nalready pointed out, as it is in turnips, where the danger to the young\r\nplants from the ravages of the turnip-fly is such that the growth of\r\neven a day or two may make a very considerable difference.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Value of Insoluble Phosphate._\r\n\r\nA consideration of the action of superphosphate, then, throws a good\r\ndeal of light on the conditions which determine the value of insoluble\r\nphosphates when applied to the soil, and shows that the state of\r\ndivision, intimacy of mixture with soil-particles, and the nature of the\r\nsoil, are the determining factors. Insoluble phosphates, as we shall\r\nhave occasion to see when discussing basic slag, have their best action\r\non soils poor in lime and rich in organic matter. Tables have been drawn\r\nup with a view to furnishing a guide for the value of phosphoric acid in\r\ndifferent manures. In the Appendix[232] we give those of Wolff for 1893,\r\nand an American table, drawn up for 1892. The comparative values of\r\nmineral phosphates, as well as Peruvian guano and bone-dust, will be\r\nfurther referred to in the following chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rate at which Superphosphate is applied._\r\n\r\nThe rate at which superphosphate is applied to the soil varies in\r\ndifferent parts of the country. In England 2 to 3 cwt. per acre is\r\nconsidered an average dressing; whereas in many parts of Scotland it is\r\napplied in as large quantities as 6 to 8 cwt. per acre to the turnip\r\ncrop. The reason why so much heavier dressings can be advantageously\r\ngiven in northern parts of this country is owing to the much longer\r\nperiod of unchecked growth. In the more southern districts, where the\r\nrainfall is less, mildew is almost certain to appear when the sowing is\r\nas early as required for a maximum crop. With it, as with other manures,\r\nthe quantity must be determined by the conditions of its application,\r\nand the amount of other manure applied.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[225] This holds true, it may be mentioned, with regard to the\r\napplication of certain manures, such as bone-char, to the soil.\r\nBone-char was for a long time used in France as a manure without being\r\ndissolved. The action of such a manure, containing a considerable\r\npercentage of carbonate of lime, is slower than its action would be were\r\nit pure phosphate of lime, as the carbonate of lime is first acted upon\r\n(as in the case of superphosphate manufacture) by the soil acids.\r\n\r\n[226] The solubility of tribasic phosphate, of course, is not always\r\nequal in different manures. For example, the phosphate in apatite, owing\r\nto the crystalline structure of that mineral, is not nearly so soluble\r\nas the phosphate in phosphatic guanos, although in both cases its\r\nchemical composition is practically the same.\r\n\r\n[227] For formulae of the different phosphates, see Appendix, Note I., p.\r\n398.\r\n\r\n[228] For chemical formulae, showing reaction, see Appendix, Note II., p.\r\n398.\r\n\r\n[229] Of course it is well known that free phosphoric acid is obtained\r\nby acting upon phosphate of lime with an excess of sulphuric acid; but\r\nthe point above referred to as having been recently discovered is, that\r\nwhen phosphate of lime is acted upon, even by a small quantity of\r\nsulphuric acid, free phosphoric acid is formed.\r\n\r\n[230] For chemical formulae showing this reversion, see Appendix, Note\r\nIII., p. 399.\r\n\r\n[231] For chemical theories on reversion of soluble phosphate by iron\r\nand alumina, see Appendix, Note IV., p. 399.\r\n\r\n[232] See Appendix, Note V., p. 400.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE I.

(p. 390).\r\n\r\n\"Just what the reactions are which are produced by the iron and alumina\r\ncompounds has never been made out very clearly. But some idea of them\r\nmay be gained from the following suggestions, which were thrown out by\r\nthe English chemist Patterson. Suppose the sulphuric acid has dissolved\r\na quantity of iron or alumina, then we may have the reaction:----\r\n\r\nFe_{2}O_{3}, 3SO_{3} + CaO, 2H_{2}O, P_{2}O_{5} = Fe_{2}O_{3},\r\nP_{2}O_{5} + CaO, SO_{3} + 2(H_{2}O, SO_{3}),\r\n\r\nand the free acid thus formed would proceed to dissolve more iron or\r\nalumina from the rock that had previously escaped decomposition, and the\r\nreaction here formulated would occur again and again. Here we have a\r\ncumulative process continually increasing the quantity of insoluble\r\nFe_{2}O_{3}, P_{2}O_{5}, and diminishing in the same proportion the\r\nsoluble P_{2}O_{5}. Again, we may have simply----\r\n\r\n2Fe_{2}O_{3} + 3(CaO, 2H_{2}O, P_{2}O_{5}) = 2(Fe_{2}O_{3}, P_{2}O_{5})\r\n+ 3CaO, P_{2}O_{5};\r\n\r\nwhere three molecules of the soluble phosphoric acid are made to revert\r\nto the insoluble state at one blow.\r\n\r\n\"In case the iron in the original rock were in the state of ferrous\r\noxide, perhaps the following reaction might occur:----\r\n\r\n4(FeO, SO_{3}) + 2O + CaO, 2H_{2}O, P_{2}O_{5} + 3CaO, P_{2}O_{5} =\r\n2(Fe_{2}O_{3}, P_{2}O_{5}) + 4(CaO, SO_{3}).\r\n\r\nIn all these equations, except the last, alumina would serve as well as\r\noxide of iron.\"--(_Vide_ Storer's 'Agricultural Chemistry,' vol. i. pp.\r\n276, 277.)\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE V.

It has been in the market since 1886, and the consumption alone\r\nin Germany in 1887 amounted to nearly 300,000 tons. In this country it\r\nis only now beginning to be used to any extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Its Manufacture._\r\n\r\n_Thomas-slag_ is a bye-product obtained in the manufacture of steel by\r\nwhat is known as the \"basic\" process. In the year 1879 an improvement in\r\nthe well-known \"Bessemer\" process was patented by Messrs Gilchrist &\r\nThomas. It must be explained that in the manufacture of steel from\r\npig-iron certain impurities in the raw material have to be got rid of in\r\norder to produce a good steel. Among these impurities one of the most\r\nimportant is _phosphorus_. This is owing to the fact that even a very\r\nsmall percentage of phosphoric acid in steel has the effect of\r\nrendering it brittle. The extraction of the phosphorus from the raw\r\nmaterial was formerly, however, attended with very serious difficulties,\r\nand had the effect naturally of rendering steel a costly article,\r\ninasmuch as only the purer kinds of pig-iron could be used for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nBy the introduction in 1879, however, of the \"Thomas-Gilchrist\" or\r\n\"basic\" process, these difficulties were very largely overcome, and the\r\nemployment of even such impure irons as the Cleveland (containing\r\ncomparatively a large percentage of phosphorus) was rendered possible,\r\nand the price of steel consequently generally very much reduced. The\r\nprocess consists of submitting the molten pig-iron to a very great heat\r\nin a pear-shaped vessel (known technically as the \"converter\"). This is\r\nopen at the top, and is supported on hinges, which permit of its being\r\nmoved so as to pour off the scum which rises to the surface at the end\r\nof the operation, and which, we may explain, consists of \"basic slag.\"\r\nIn the original process the sides of the \"converter\" were lined with\r\nfire-bricks, consisting largely of silica. This process was known as the\r\n\"acid\" process. In the \"Thomas-Gilchrist\" process, however, the sides of\r\nthe \"converter\" are lined with _lime_ (dolomitic limestone being largely\r\nused), lime being also added to the pig-iron. An air-blast is injected\r\nthrough the molten mass, and the impurities are burnt, or oxidised as it\r\nis chemically termed. The phosphorus in the iron is thus converted into\r\nphosphoric acid, and, uniting with the lime, forms phosphate of lime,\r\nwhich rises, as we have already said, to the surface in the form of a\r\nscum, and is separated from the steel by being poured off.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Not at first used._\r\n\r\nThis, then, is how the _Thomas-slag_ is obtained. It did not seem,\r\nhowever, for some years after the introduction of this ingenious\r\nprocess, to have struck any one that this rich phosphatic bye-product\r\nmight prove a valuable addition to our artificial fertilisers. The\r\nresult was, that the Thomas-slag was treated as another of the only too\r\nnumerous valueless bye-products which seem to be necessarily incidental\r\nto most of our chemical and other manufactures, and was allowed to\r\naccumulate in large quantities without being used for any purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Discovery of its Value._\r\n\r\nIn 1883 some short articles published in Germany on the subject were the\r\nmeans of first drawing the attention of the public to its importance as\r\na manure. During the years 1884 and 1885 numerous experiments were\r\ncarried out on the subject in the same country; and from then up till\r\nthe present hour it has become more and more extensively used in\r\nGermany, till in 1887, as already stated, its consumption amounted to\r\nnearly 300,000 tons.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition._\r\n\r\nIt consists mainly of phosphate of lime, silicate of lime, free lime,\r\nfree magnesia, and oxides of iron and manganese. Its composition, of\r\ncourse, naturally varies; but the following may be taken as an average\r\nanalysis:[233]--\r\n\r\n                                                 Per cent.\r\n*Phosphoric acid                                    17\r\n Lime in combination with phosphoric, silicic,\r\n   sulphuric, and carbonic acids                    40\r\n Free lime                                          15\r\n Oxides of iron                                     12\r\n*Equal to tricalcic phosphate                       37\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the phosphoric acid varies considerably, ranging from 10 to\r\n20 per cent--that is, from 22 to 44 per cent tricalcic phosphate. This\r\nis owing to the difference in the percentage of phosphorus in the raw\r\nmaterial and the quantity of lime added. Attempts have been made in\r\nGermany during the last two or three years to obtain a slag richer in\r\nphosphoric acid than that obtained heretofore, and a process for this\r\npurpose has been patented by Professor Scheibler. This consists of a\r\nslight modification in the ordinary process. Instead of treating the\r\npig-iron with an excessive quantity of lime, the amount added is not\r\nsufficient to effect the complete dephosphorisation of the iron. The\r\nresulting slag is very rich in phosphoric acid, and is correspondingly\r\npoor in iron. The iron is then again treated with fresh lime, and the\r\nphosphorus completely removed, while the same lime may be used over\r\nagain. Such slag forms a very much more concentrated phosphatic manure\r\nthan the ordinary slag, and is known as _patent phosphate meal_.\r\n\r\nA point which not only renders the slag a product of peculiar interest\r\nfrom a chemical point of view, but has a most important bearing on its\r\nvalue as a manure, is the nature of the compound formed by the union of\r\nthe lime with the phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary so-called raw phosphates, such as bone-meal, bone-ash,\r\ncoprolites, &c., the lime and phosphoric acid are combined in the form\r\nof what is known, in chemical phraseology, as _tribasic phosphate of\r\nlime_. That is to say, that for every equivalent of phosphoric acid\r\nthere are three equivalents of lime. Now it was naturally concluded at\r\nfirst that the tribasic phosphate was the form in which these two\r\nsubstances existed in the slag. This, however, was found out not to be\r\nthe case, in the following way. On allowing the slag to cool, it was\r\nfound that small but perfectly defined crystals were formed. These\r\ncrystals, by careful analysis, were shown, first by Hilgenstock, to\r\nconsist of a form of phosphate of lime hitherto unknown, in which four\r\nequivalents of lime were combined with one equivalent of phosphoric\r\nacid, and which was therefore called \"tetrabasic phosphate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Processes for preparing Slag._\r\n\r\nAs soon as the idea of utilising the slag as a manure was suggested,\r\nvarious plans for extracting its phosphoric acid, and rendering it\r\navailable as plant-food, were devised. These were deemed necessary, it\r\nwas thought, by the very insoluble nature of the phosphates in the slag,\r\nas well as by the supposed injurious action which would be exerted on\r\nplant-life by the protoxide of iron it contained. Accordingly, a large\r\nnumber of patents were taken out, \"covering almost every conceivable\r\nmethod for treating the slag, whether practicable or not. They all in\r\nthe main are combinations or variations of the following processes:--\r\n\r\n\"1. _Preliminary preparation of the Slag._\r\n\r\n    (_a_) By treating molten, or otherwise, with superheated steam, or\r\n          cooling when hot with water, to reduce it to small pieces or\r\n          to a fragile state.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Grinding.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) Treating with water to wash out free lime, or with sugar\r\n          solution.\r\n\r\n    (_d_) Roasting in the air, or with some oxidising agent.\r\n\r\n\"2. _Solution of the Slag._\r\n\r\n    (_a_) _Completely_ in weak or strong acids (hydrochloric, sulphuric,\r\n          &c.)\r\n\r\n    (_b_) _Partially_, so as to dissolve the phosphates and silicates of\r\n          lime, and leave most of the iron and manganese oxides.\r\n\r\n\"3. _Precipitation_ of the phosphoric acid, with lime\r\nor iron salts: or,\r\n\r\n\"Processes in which the slag is smelted with charcoal,\r\nto reduce phosphates to phosphides, treated with\r\nacid, and the phosphuretted hydrogen burnt to phosphoric\r\nacid; and,\r\n\r\n\"Processes in which the slag is fused with soda or\r\npotash salts,--caustic, chlorides, sulphates, carbonates,--with\r\nor without steam being forced through, to form soluble alkaline\r\nphosphates.\"[234]\r\n\r\nMany of these processes were tried; but it was found by experiment that\r\nthe best and most economical way was by applying the slag direct to the\r\nground in a state of very fine powder. Experiments further showed that\r\nit had _not_ the injurious effect on vegetation which it was feared it\r\nwould have from the protoxide of iron it contained. The discovery that\r\nits phosphoric acid existed, as has been already explained, as a\r\ntetrabasic phosphate of lime, has strengthened the opinion that this is\r\nthe best method of application.\r\n\r\nA good deal has been found to depend upon the fineness of the ground\r\nslag, with the result that it is now commonly sold on a mechanical as\r\nwell as a chemical analysis--_i.e._, the slag is guaranteed to pass\r\nthrough a sieve of a certain fineness.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Solubility of Slag._\r\n\r\nProfessor Wagner of Darmstadt has carried out some extremely interesting\r\nexperiments on the solubility of slag. He found that very finely\r\npowdered slag was dissolved in carbonic acid water to the extent of 36\r\nper cent, while, similarly treated, phosphorite only dissolved to the\r\nextent of 8 per cent.[235] Another very important solvent is _citrate of\r\nammonia_. Reverted (or precipitated) phosphate is entirely soluble in\r\nit, and phosphate soluble in it ought to be valued as worth more than\r\nthat which is not. Now, the solubility of Thomas-slag in citrate of\r\nammonia was found by Professor Wagner to be no less than 74 per cent,\r\nwhile that of phosphorite only amounted to 4 per cent. These results\r\nwere corroborated by Professor S. W. Johnson, who found that of the\r\n19.87 per cent of phosphoric acid contained in a sample of basic slag,\r\nno less than 19.57 per cent was soluble in ammonium citrate, while a\r\nfinely ground sample of phosphatic rock yielded, on analysis, only 1.81\r\nper cent soluble in citrate of ammonia, of a total of 29.49 per cent\r\nphosphoric acid which it contained. Professor Fleischer has also tested\r\nthe comparative solubility of basic slag and phosphorite, by boiling\r\nthem in a solution of acetic acid. The former was found to have been\r\ndissolved to the extent of 19 per cent, while the latter to only 5 per\r\ncent. A highly interesting and most important experiment was performed\r\nby Mr Heinrich Albert, of Biebrich. One gramme of basic slag and 100\r\ngrammes of peat were mixed together in a litre of water, and it was\r\nfound that, after standing for fourteen days, 79 per cent of the\r\nphosphoric acid contained in the slag was rendered soluble.\r\n\r\nIn the above experiments it was found that the _fineness of grinding_\r\nhad a marked effect on the solubility of the slag, and that the finer it\r\nwas ground the greater was its solubility. This has been further\r\ndemonstrated in Professor Wagner's practical experiments. From these it\r\nwas found that finely ground slag has an action _four times_ as quick as\r\ncoarse slag; but that, as far as practical results were concerned, there\r\nseemed to be a limit to the fineness to which it was advisable to grind\r\nthe slag, as slag above a certain fineness did not give better results\r\nthan a coarser slag. At any rate, he found that slag of a fineness so\r\ngreat that it all passed through a gauze sieve, gave no better results\r\nin his experiments than slag which left 17 per cent behind. We may say,\r\nhowever, that the _finer the slag is ground, the greater will its\r\nactivity as a manure be_; and that a certain degree of fineness is\r\nabsolutely necessary to constitute it an active fertiliser. As\r\nProfessor Wagner's experiments are among the most valuable and complete\r\ncarried out on basic slag, we shall give a somewhat detailed account of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Darmstadt Experiments._\r\n\r\nProfessor Wagner's experiments were carried out on such different kinds\r\nof crops as flax, rape, wheat, rye, barley, peas, and white mustard, and\r\nthe object of the experiments was to ascertain the comparative activity\r\nas fertilisers of superphosphate, basic slag of different degrees of\r\nfineness, Peruvian guano, damped bone-meal, and very finely ground\r\ncoprolites. In order to obtain a correct estimate of the relative value\r\nof these different forms of phosphatic manures, it was necessary to\r\nrender the nitrogen in the bone-meal and the nitrogen and potash\r\ncontained by the Peruvian guano inactive--_i.e._, to limit the test\r\nstrictly to phosphoric acid. This was done by adding to the super, basic\r\nslag, and coprolites, quantities of nitrogen and potash equal to those\r\ncontained by the other manures. There was further added to all the\r\nexperiments (the unmanured ones, of course, as well) an excess of\r\nnitrogen and potash. In this way the increase in returns could only be\r\ndue to the phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nThe general results obtained from these experiments may be summed up as\r\nfollows: Taking the activity of \"super\" to be represented by 100, then\r\nthe relative activity of--\r\n\r\nBasic slag of No. 1[236] fineness is       61\r\nBasic slag, No. 2[237]                     58\r\nPeruvian guano                             30\r\nBasic slag, No. 3[238]                     13\r\nBone-meal                                  10\r\nCoprolites                                  9\r\n\r\nFrom these results the value of the commercial article has been\r\nattempted to be ascertained. As it contains 80 per cent or thereby of\r\nfine meal and 20 per cent of coarse, its activity may be stated to be\r\n50, or half as active as super. Thus 2 cwt. of basic slag is equal to 1\r\ncwt. of super. This only refers to the first year's effect. Professor\r\nWagner has made further experiments as to the after-effects of the\r\ndifferent manures, with the result that he has found that the\r\nafter-effects of the basic slag are even _better_ than those of the\r\n\"super.\" This stands to reason, for if twice as much phosphoric acid be\r\nadded in the form of basic slag as is added in the form of \"super,\" and\r\nthe effect of the first year is similar--that is, the same quantity of\r\nphosphoric acid is assimilated by the plant from the soil in both\r\ncases--there is naturally more phosphoric acid left behind in the soil\r\nmanured with basic slag than in that manured with superphosphate of\r\nlime. For example, if 100 lb. of super has the same effect in the first\r\nyear as 200 lb. of basic slag, and it is found that only 60 lb. of the\r\nsuper and the basic slag have been assimilated the first year by the\r\nplant, it is only natural to conclude that the remaining 140 lb. of the\r\nbasic slag will have a better after-effect than the remaining 40 lb. of\r\nsuper. This has been actually proved to have been the case in\r\nProfessor's Wagner's experiments. The following are the results of some\r\nexperiments which Professor Wagner has carried out on the after-effects\r\nof different manures:--\r\n\r\nOut of 100 parts of phosphoric acid, there was removed by the first\r\nyear's crop--\r\n\r\nSuper                            63\r\nPeruvian guano                   22\r\nBone-meal                         7\r\nCoprolites                        6\r\nThomas-meal--\r\n  No. 1 fineness                 39\r\n  No. 2  \"                       43\r\n  No. 3  \"                       15\r\n\r\nOut of 100 parts of phosphoric acid left by the first crop, there was\r\nremoved by the three succeeding crops--\r\n\r\nSuper                              30\r\nPeruvian guano                      9\r\nBone-meal                          13\r\nCoprolites                          6\r\nThomas-meal--\r\n  No. 1 fineness                   14\r\n  No. 2  \"                         29\r\n  No. 3  \"                         24\r\n\r\nNumerous other experiments have been carried out by various\r\nexperimenters in different parts of Germany which it is unnecessary to\r\ncite here. None, however, are so complete as those of Professor Wagner.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Results of other Experiments._\r\n\r\nIn this country experiments have been carried out at Rothamsted,\r\nCirencester, Downton, Bangor, and by Dr Aitken at the Highland and\r\nAgricultural Society's stations, as well as elsewhere. The results of\r\nthese various experiments naturally differ considerably, this being\r\nowing to the difference in the nature of the soils upon which the\r\nexperiments were carried out, as well as the different degrees of\r\nfineness of the slag used. They all, however, serve to confirm Professor\r\nWagner's general results. The results obtained in Scotland by Dr Aitken\r\nat the Highland Society's stations were especially favourable to basic\r\nslag as a phosphatic manure. The experiments were carried out on\r\nturnips, and it was found that the Thomas-slag was, weight for weight,\r\nsuperior to superphosphate. It may be added that the slag used in these\r\nexperiments was rich in phosphoric acid, and was in an unusually fine\r\nstate of division. Experiments carried out by the author have proved\r\nslag to be, on various Scottish soils, one of the most economical\r\nphosphatic manures to apply to turnips.[239]\r\n\r\nWe will sum up, in conclusion, the deductions which may be fairly drawn\r\nfrom the results of all the above-mentioned experiments as to the value\r\nof basic cinder as a manure.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Soils most suited for Slag._\r\n\r\nAlthough its action is undoubtedly more favourable on some soils than\r\nothers, it may be broadly stated that generally its phosphoric acid is\r\n_half as valuable_ as that in soluble phosphate. The soils on which it\r\nwill have the most marked effect will be those of a _peaty_ nature,\r\n_poor_ in lime, but _rich_ in _organic matter_. The beneficial results\r\nobtained by an application of lime to peaty soils are well known. As the\r\nslag contains a large percentage of free lime, it thus performs on such\r\nsoils a double function. On meadow-lands, all kinds of pasture-lands (if\r\nnot of too dry a character), and clay soils poor in lime, its action has\r\nbeen shown to be especially favourable. Of different kinds of crops,\r\nthose best suited to benefit from the slag as a phosphatic manure are\r\nthose of the leguminous kind. This arises from the fact that their\r\nperiod of growth is longer than that of most other crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rate of Application._\r\n\r\nAs to the rate per acre at which the slag ought to be applied, there\r\nwill naturally be a difference of opinion. Professor Wrightson, of\r\nDownton Agricultural College, recommends that it should be applied at\r\nthe rate of from 6 to 10 cwt. per acre. This, of course, is very\r\nliberal manuring. We must remember, however, that phosphatic manures,\r\nunlike nitrogenous manures, and to some extent potash manures, may be\r\napplied in even excessive quantities without any risk of loss. It is\r\nimpossible to measure out our phosphate manures in the same accurate\r\nmanner as we measure out our nitrogen. It is safer, therefore, and on\r\nthat account more economical in the long-run, to apply our phosphate in\r\nexcessive quantity than the reverse. The reason of this may be shortly\r\nexplained. The phosphoric acid which is naturally present in most soils\r\nis with difficulty soluble. Only a small quantity is yielded daily to\r\nthe plant. This quantity may, under favourable climatic conditions, be\r\nsufficient; but these favourable influences never last very long at a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nFor three weeks, perhaps, the plant may experience drought, and during\r\nthis period it takes up no phosphoric acid, and its growth practically\r\ncomes to a standstill; but this period of drought is followed by rain\r\nand warm weather, and the plant, if it is to be ripe by harvest-time,\r\nmust make up for lost time. It must grow as much the next few days under\r\nthese favourable climatic conditions as it would have grown under normal\r\nconditions in double or treble the time. In order to do so, however, it\r\nmust be able to obtain plenty of phosphoric acid, and this is only\r\npossible where there is a decided excess of phosphoric acid present in\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nThe richness of a soil, therefore, in phosphoric acid, must be such\r\nthat it is not only able to supply the ordinary wants of the plant, but\r\nto provide an excess when such an excess will be needed; for one must\r\nremember that the amount of plant-substance formed in the course of a\r\nfew days under favourable conditions is very great, and that the amount\r\nconsequently of phosphoric acid which plants assimilate during that\r\nperiod must also be very considerable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Method of Application._\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, as to the method of application of the slag,\r\nagriculturists must be _warned against mixing it with sulphate of\r\nammonia_; for if this is done, a _considerable loss of ammonia_ will\r\nensue, set free from the sulphate by the action of the free lime which\r\nthe Thomas-slag contains. With nitrate of soda and potash salts it may\r\nbe freely mixed. Such mixtures, however, are apt to form themselves into\r\nlittle balls, which soon become very hard. They should therefore only be\r\nmixed shortly before use. To overcome this difficulty, Professor Wagner\r\nrecommends the mixture of a little peat or sawdust with the slag.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[233] See Appendix, p. 417.\r\n\r\n[234] _Vide_ paper on \"Basic Slag: Its Formation.\" By Stead and\r\nRibsdale.

It was\r\nfurther pointed out that, under the ordinary conditions of agriculture,\r\na greater restoration to the soil of the potash removed in the crops was\r\nmade in the straw used in farmyard manure than was the case with regard\r\nto the other two ingredients. Despite these facts, there are many cases\r\nwhere the addition of potassic manures is of the highest importance in\r\nincreasing plant-growth. It will be well, therefore, to devote a little\r\nspace to considering our different potassic manures and their respective\r\naction.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scottish Soils supplied with Potash._\r\n\r\nPotassic manures are not so valuable in this country since experience\r\nhas shown that most Scottish soils are abundantly supplied with this\r\nmanurial ingredient. Moreover, under the conditions of most European\r\nfarming, there seems to be a steady gain to the soil of potash. In\r\nAmerica, however, the action of potash as a manure seems to be more\r\nstrikingly illustrated. Indeed, wherever forage crops or straw are sold\r\noff the farm in large quantities, or where beets, cabbages, carrots,\r\npotatoes, onions, &c., are also grown in large quantities, the necessity\r\nfor potash manuring generally arises.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sources of Potassic Manures._\r\n\r\nThe value of potash as a manure first came to be recognised from the\r\nfavourable action of wood-ashes. Of course their favourable action is\r\nnot due solely to potash, as they contain, in addition to the other ash\r\ningredients of the plant, phosphates; and their value as a manure may\r\nalso be said to depend not a little on their indirect action. They\r\ncontain a certain percentage of caustic alkali, which promotes the\r\ndecomposition of the nitrogenous matter of the soil. But making due\r\nallowance for these other valuable properties, the chief value of\r\nwood-ashes is undoubtedly due to the potash they contain. Hence the use\r\nof the commercial article called _potash_, which is a mixture of\r\npotassium carbonate and hydrate, and which is obtained from wood-ashes,\r\nwas formerly common to a considerable extent as a manure, especially for\r\nclover. _Barilla_, a rich potassic manure prepared by burning certain\r\nstrand plants, especially the saltwort, was also in the past largely\r\nexported from Sicily and Spain. _Kelp_, a product got by burning\r\nsea-weed in Scotland, is also a rich potassic manure. Since, however,\r\nthe discovery of the Stassfurt mines, all potassic manures have come\r\nfrom these.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stassfurt Potash Salts._\r\n\r\nHuge salt deposits exist at Stassfurt in Germany. They have been formed\r\nby the evaporation of an inland sea. Salt was first discovered in these\r\ndeposits in 1839, but for long the presence of potash salts was little\r\nsuspected, and it was not until 1862 that the potash salts were worked.\r\nWe have already, in the Appendix to Chapter VI., given a list of the\r\nchief potash minerals occurring in the Stassfurt deposits. These\r\nminerals are found in layers, the lowest layer consisting of almost pure\r\nsalt; while immediately above this we have a layer of salt mixed with\r\nthe mineral polyhallite (containing potassium sulphate) of about 100\r\nfeet thick. Above this last layer there is a layer of about 90 feet,\r\ncontaining kieserite (magnesium sulphate) mixed with potassium and\r\nmagnesium chlorides; and above this again is a layer (90 feet) of\r\ncarnallite, which furnishes the chief source of the potash salts used\r\nfor manurial purposes.\r\n\r\nAt first the crude salts, as obtained direct from the deposits, were\r\nsold as manures under the name of _Abraum_ salts. Now, however, they are\r\npurified. Of potash salts in 1888 some 25,000 tons were exported from\r\nStassfurt for manurial purposes. Of these salts there may be mentioned,\r\nviz., kainit, an impure form of the sulphate, containing on an average\r\nabout 12 per cent of potash, and the muriate and the sulphate--both\r\nsalts, in a more or less pure form, being used. A word or two may be\r\nadded on the effect of the two forms of potash--viz., as the sulphate\r\nand as the muriate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relative Merits of Sulphate and Muriate of Potash._\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that muriate of potash, far from having a\r\nbeneficial effect on certain crops, is actually harmful. Of these,\r\nsugar-beets, potatoes, and tobacco may be mentioned. In the case of\r\nbeets it seems to have an effect in lessening the percentage of\r\ncrystallisable sugar, while potatoes are rendered waxy. With regard to\r\nthe tobacco-plant, it seems to impair the value of the leaf from the\r\nsmoker's point of view. That this deleterious action is due to the form\r\nin which the potash is present, and not to the potash itself, seems to\r\nbe pretty clear, since potash in the form of sulphate has not this\r\ndeleterious effect on these plants. Another objection which has been\r\nurged against muriate of potash is that, when applied as a manure, it\r\nis apt to give rise to the formation of calcium chloride,--a compound\r\nwhich is distinctly hurtful to many plants. A similar charge cannot be\r\nbrought against sulphate of potash, since gypsum, which is the chief\r\ncompound it is likely to give rise to, is of much value, as we have\r\nalready pointed out, as an indirect manure. On the whole, therefore,\r\nsulphate of potash seems to be the safest form in which to add potash.\r\nUnfortunately, however, most of the commercial sulphates are very\r\nimpure, and contain generally considerable quantities of muriate. In\r\nfavour of the muriate, it may be said that it is the more concentrated\r\nmanure, and that it diffuses better in the soil than the sulphate--a\r\npoint of great importance. It has, moreover, been used without any bad\r\neffect for clover, corn, grass, and some root crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Application of Potash Manures._\r\n\r\nThe extreme tenacity with which the soil-particles fix potash salts,\r\nwhen applied as manures, is a point which ought to be borne in mind in\r\ntheir application. This, as we have just noticed, is greater in the case\r\nof the sulphate than in the case of muriate, and it has been observed\r\nthat certain other fertilisers seem to exercise a considerable influence\r\nin hindering their fixation. Among these may be mentioned bone-meal and\r\nfarmyard manure. Nitrate of soda also seems to increase the\r\ndiffusibility of potash salts. Conversely, potash salts seem to help to\r\nfix ammonia.\r\n\r\nFor the above reasons potash manures ought to be applied to the soil a\r\nconsiderable period before they are likely to be used by the crop. There\r\nis little risk of any serious loss taking place owing to rain. Autumn\r\napplication is generally recommended. Even in very light soils it has\r\nbeen proved in the Norfolk experiments that autumn application has an\r\nimmense advantage over spring application. It has been found that where\r\npotash is applied as sulphate, little sulphuric acid is absorbed by the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Soils and Crops suited for Potash Manures._\r\n\r\nOf soils best suited for potash manures, it has been found that light\r\nsoils, and those largely charged with peaty organic matter (such as the\r\nmoorland soils of Germany), are most benefited; while on heavy clayey\r\nsoils the percentage of potash which these latter contain is already\r\nsufficiently abundant for the needs of plants. At Flitcham the value of\r\npotash on chalk soils has been strikingly demonstrated. Of crops, it is\r\nnow pretty generally acknowledged that those of the leguminous order are\r\nmost benefited by potash. Especially in the case of clover has potash\r\nalways proved itself a manure worth applying.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rate of Application._\r\n\r\nPotash is best applied in small quantities. From 1 to 2 cwt. of the\r\nmuriate or sulphate is a common amount, and from 6 to 8 cwt. of kainit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nMINOR ARTIFICIAL MANURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the manures which have been discussed in previous\r\nchapters, there are a number of minor manures which are used to a very\r\nmuch smaller extent--dried blood, hoofs, horns, &c.\r\n\r\nAmong these one of the most valuable is dried blood. Fresh blood,\r\ncontaining 80 per cent of water, has from 2.5 to 3 per cent of nitrogen,\r\nabout .25 per cent of phosphoric acid, and about .5 per cent of\r\nalkalies. When dried it forms a very concentrated and valuable\r\nnitrogenous manure, which has long been used in France. The commercial\r\narticle contains, on an average, about 12 per cent of nitrogen, and\r\nslightly over 1 per cent of phosphoric acid. When mixed with the soil it\r\nferments, and the nitrogen it contains is converted into ammonia.\r\nAlthough not so quick-acting a manure as nitrate of soda or sulphate of\r\nammonia, it can by no means be described, as is done in ordinary\r\nagricultural text-books, as a slow-acting manure. Its nitrogen may be\r\nregarded as of equal value to that in Peruvian guano. It is peculiarly\r\nsuited for horticulture, and is chiefly used in this country as a manure\r\nfor hops. It has also been used with beneficial results for wheat,\r\ngrass, and turnips. As a manure it is best suited for sandy or loamy\r\nsoils. Considerable quantities are exported to the sugar-growing\r\ncolonies as a manure for sugar-cane. Manures are made from other animal\r\nrefuse. It may be mentioned that lean flesh (containing 75 per cent of\r\nwater) has about 3 to 4 per cent of nitrogen,.5 per cent of alkalies,\r\nand .5 per cent of phosphoric acid; that is to say, a ton of lean flesh\r\nwould contain about 70 lb. of nitrogen and 10 lb. of phosphoric acid. In\r\nair-dried flesh, according to Payen and Boussingault (containing 8-1/2\r\nper cent of moisture), there is 13 per cent of nitrogen. Flesh,\r\ntherefore, is, when properly composted, a valuable nitrogenous manure.\r\nDried flesh is generally made into a manure called meat-meal guano, the\r\ncomposition of which we have already referred to in the chapter on\r\nGuano.[240]\r\n\r\nHoofs, horns, hair, bristles, and wool, wool-waste and the intestines of\r\nanimals, have been used as manures. Hoofs and horns form a regular\r\nsource of artificial nitrogenous manure; the latter being obtained as a\r\nbye-product in the manufacture of combs and other articles. They are in\r\nthe form of a fine powder; and in order to increase their rate of\r\naction, which is very slow, they are often composted in America with\r\nhorse-manure before use. They have also been composted with slaked lime.\r\nThere can be no doubt that such treatment increases very considerably\r\ntheir value. Their percentage of nitrogen seems to vary very much\r\naccording to the kind of animal from which they are derived. In nine\r\nsamples of horn the nitrogen was found to vary from 7-1/2 to 14-1/4 per\r\ncent; giving an average of 11-1/3 per cent. The nitrogen seems rarely to\r\nexceed 15 per cent. The amount of phosphoric acid they contain has been\r\nfound by various investigators to range from 6 to 10 per cent. S. W.\r\nJohnson found only from .08 to .15 per cent in buffalo-horn shavings. In\r\nFrance what is known as \"torrefied\" horn has been used. This is horn\r\nwhich has been subjected to the action of steam. The nitrogen in this\r\nmaterial is considered to be more active than in ordinary horn.\r\nAccording to Way, horns have been used for the hop crop with good\r\nresults. Ground hoof is very similar in composition to horn, and\r\ncontains about 14 to 15 per cent of nitrogen. Considerable quantities\r\nare now used. It must be remembered, however, that horns, hoofs, hair,\r\nbristles, &c., although rich in nitrogen, possess a comparatively low\r\nmanurial value. The home production of these articles may be estimated\r\nat 6000 to 7000 tons.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scutch._\r\n\r\nScutch is the name given to a manure made from the waste products\r\nincidental to the manufacture of glue and the dressing of skins. It\r\ncontains about 7 per cent of nitrogen, and is manufactured in London to\r\nthe extent of several thousand tons annually.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Shoddy and Wool-waste._\r\n\r\nShoddy, which is a manure made from waste-wool products, is a material\r\nlargely manufactured in this country, and which was formerly (it is now\r\nused to a considerably less extent) used to a large extent as a manure.\r\nIts annual production amounts to about 12,000 tons. There are three\r\nqualities,--the first containing 8 to 12 per cent of nitrogen; the\r\nsecond, 6 to 8 per cent; and the third, 5 to 8 per cent. Shoddy is by no\r\nmeans a very valuable manure. Woollen-waste products were formerly much\r\nricher in nitrogen than is now the case. This is due to the fact of the\r\nadulteration with cotton, now so prevalent in the manufacture of woollen\r\ngoods. Pure woollen rags should contain 17 to 18 per cent of nitrogen.\r\nIt has been strongly recommended to treat woollen waste with caustic\r\nalkali before being used as a manure, in order to render their nitrogen\r\nmore quickly available; and there is a good deal to recommend this\r\ntreatment. When wool-waste is applied as a manure, it should in every\r\ncase be in autumn, so as to allow as long a period as possible to elapse\r\nbefore it is required for the plant's growth.\r\n\r\nLeather has also been used as a manure. Its nitrogen may be stated at\r\nfrom 4 to 6 per cent; and it may safely be described as of all materials\r\nused as nitrogenous manures the least valuable. Leather is, from its\r\nvery nature, admirably adapted to resist decomposition when applied to\r\nthe soil, and unless it is reduced to a very fine condition, might be\r\ntrusted to remain undecomposed for a long period. Torrefied leather,\r\nhowever, is probably of greater value. It is obtained in the same way as\r\ntorrefied horn, already referred to--namely, by treatment with steam.\r\nThe grease and fatty matters which so largely aid it in resisting\r\ndecomposition being extracted, it is much better suited for manurial\r\npurposes than ordinary leather. Torrefied leather contains from 5 to 8\r\nper cent of nitrogen.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Soot._\r\n\r\nA manure which has long been used and highly esteemed is soot. Obtained\r\nin the usual way, it generally contains some 3 per cent of nitrogen,\r\nchiefly in the form of sulphate of ammonia, and small quantities of\r\npotash and phosphates. A varying proportion of the nitrogen is present\r\nin the form of ammonia salts; and this undoubtedly confers upon soot its\r\nmanurial value. It has long been used as a top-dressing for young grain\r\nand grass, and has been applied at the rate of from 40 to 60 bushels per\r\nacre. It has an indirect value as a slug-destroyer.\r\n\r\nMany of the above-mentioned manures, of comparatively low value, will\r\nprobably be less used in the future than they have been in the past,\r\nowing to the more abundant supplies of nitrate of soda and ammonia salts\r\nwhich are now available. Many of these substances have probably been\r\nused in mixed manures.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[240] See p. 324.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nSEWAGE AS A MANURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe value of sewage as a manure has been in the past enormously\r\noverrated, and much misunderstanding has existed on the part of the\r\npublic on the question of the profitableness of the disposal of town\r\nsewage as an agricultural manure. Not a few of the erroneous opinions\r\nprevalent in the past regarding sewage have been due to statements made\r\nby scientific and other writers as to the enormous wealth lost to the\r\nworld by many of the present methods of sewage disposal. Fortunately,\r\nhowever, the sewage question is now increasingly regarded as a question,\r\nin the first instance, of sanitary interest. As much has been written on\r\nthe subject, and many schemes have been devised, at the expense of much\r\ningenuity, for utilising its manurial properties, it may be desirable\r\nhere to say a few words on the purely agricultural side of the question.\r\n\r\nThe two most important points about sewage are its enormous abundance\r\nand its extremely poor quality. If the most important consideration\r\nwere not the sanitary one, but its manurial value, then indeed our water\r\nsystem, so universally used in towns, must be regarded as a most\r\nwasteful one; for by its means the value of the excrementitious matter\r\nfrom which it derives its manurial ingredients is tremendously lessened.\r\nWhen we reflect that a ton of sewage, such as is produced in many\r\nEuropean cities, contains only 2 or 3 lb. of dry matter, and that the\r\ntotal amount of nitrogen in this is only an ounce or two, while the\r\nphosphoric acid is considerably less, and that it is on those two\r\ningredients that its value as a manure entirely depends, we see very\r\nstrikingly how poor a manurial substance sewage is. Various methods have\r\nbeen devised and experimented with for extracting these manurial\r\ningredients, and many methods are in operation in different parts of the\r\nworld. The methods of utilising sewage for agricultural purposes may be\r\nbroadly divided into two classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Irrigation._\r\n\r\nOne of these, which may be classed under the heading of irrigation,\r\nconsists in pouring the sewage on to certain kinds of coarse green\r\ncrops. Sometimes the land is made to filter large quantities of sewage\r\nby special arrangements of drains and ditches. The land is first\r\ncarefully and evenly graded down a gentle incline. At the top of the\r\nfield the sewage is conducted along an open ditch from which it is\r\npermitted to escape, by the force of gravity, by several smaller\r\nditches running at right angles from the main ditch. By means of stops\r\nwhich may be shifted at will, the sewage can be directed to flow over\r\ndifferent parts of the field. Modifications in this plan may be made so\r\nas to suit the nature of the ground. In the case, for example, of a\r\nsteep incline, the field may be sewaged by means of what are known as\r\n\"catch-work\" trenches running horizontally along the hill. In this way\r\nthe sewage is allowed to pass over the whole of the field, and is caught\r\nat the bottom in a deep ditch, whence it is allowed to flow into the\r\nnearest river or stream. This is the system which has been employed at\r\nthe famous Beddington Meadows, near Croydon.\r\n\r\nAnother method of distributing the sewage is by means of underground\r\npipes, which are laid in a sort of network over the ground to be\r\nmanured. At certain intervals pipes with couplings for hose are fitted\r\non, and by keeping a certain amount of pressure on the main pipes the\r\nsewage may be distributed over the different parts of the field as it is\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nA third modification is subsoil irrigation. This resembles the\r\nlast-named system, with this difference, that the pipes used are either\r\nporous or perforated with small holes.\r\n\r\nTotal submersion can only be applied in the case of absolutely level\r\nlands, and is practised to an enormous extent in Piedmont and Lombardy.\r\n\r\nThere has been little dispute as to the thorough efficiency of\r\nirrigation--when conducted under favourable conditions--as a method of\r\npurifying sewage and utilising to the full its constituents of manurial\r\nvalue. It is the only method which has been conclusively shown to\r\nextract from sewage that to which it owes most largely its value as a\r\nmanure--viz., ammonia; and from this fact it deserves a first place in\r\nthe consideration of agriculturists. For however admirable other methods\r\nmay be from a sanitary point of view, it is obvious that a method which\r\nwould allow the ammonia in sewage wholly, or at least to over 90 per\r\ncent, to be lost, cannot claim the same place in the judgment of\r\nagriculturists as a method which can extract for the soil not only the\r\nwhole of this valuable constituent, but all else in the sewage which in\r\nany way is of value to plant-life.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Effects of continued Application of Sewage._\r\n\r\nWhen sewage is continuously applied to the same land, what generally\r\ntakes place is this: At first the sewage is purified, and the soil\r\nderives corresponding benefit from the valuable fertilising ingredients\r\nit thus extracts. After a time, however, the land becomes what has been\r\ntermed \"sewage-sick.\" The pores in the soil become choked up by the\r\nslimy matter the sewage contains in suspension; the aeration of the\r\nsoil, which, as we have already mentioned, is so necessary, is\r\nconsequently to a large extent stopped; and the result is, that the land\r\nrapidly deteriorates, and the sewage is no longer purified.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Intermittent Irrigation._\r\n\r\nThis is obviated to some extent by intermittent irrigation. The land,\r\ninstead of receiving sewage continuously, only receives it at intervals,\r\nand is allowed some time to recover between each dose. It is, however,\r\nthe opinion of those who have given the subject much attention, that\r\nland, even although intermittently sewaged, never recovers its original\r\nefficacy.\r\n\r\nIrrigation, therefore, under favourable conditions, is a most successful\r\nmethod of utilising the manurial value of sewage; but the great\r\ndifficulty in practice is to obtain those favourable conditions. It has\r\nlong been known that if soil is properly to discharge its function as a\r\npurifier of sewage water, it must be properly aerated; and we now know\r\nthat in every fertile soil the process of nitrification must be\r\npermitted free development. Now the application of large quantities of\r\nsewage to a soil is apt to prevent this free development. As we have\r\nalready seen, absence of air and the lowering of the temperature of the\r\nsoil distinctly tend to retard nitrification; and these two conditions\r\naccompany the application of large quantities of sewage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Crops suited for Sewage._\r\n\r\nAnother objection to irrigation has been found in the alleged limited\r\nnumber of crops sewaged land is suited to yield. It has been repeatedly\r\nstated that rye-grass is about the only crop it is profitable to grow\r\non it. In opposition to this statement, however, is the opinion\r\nexpressed in the conclusions arrived at by the committee appointed by\r\nthe British Association for the consideration of the sewage question. A\r\nvast number of experiments were carried out by them between the years\r\n1868-72, and the result they arrived at was as follows: \"It is certain\r\nthat all kinds of crops may be grown with sewage, so that the farmer can\r\ngrow such as he can best sell; nevertheless, the staple crops must be\r\ncattle food, such as grass, roots, &c., with occasional crops of kitchen\r\nvegetables and of corn.\" While, therefore, it is probably a mistake to\r\nsay that rye-grass is the only crop sewaged land is capable of growing\r\nprofitably, the bulk of experience goes to show that such a crop is best\r\nsuited for such land. This being so, the question naturally arises, What\r\nis the farmer who uses sewage as a manure to do with the large green\r\ncrops he obtains from his land? He is, in most cases, unable to use them\r\nhimself or dispose of them at the time. And while this has hitherto\r\nproved to be a most important drawback, now that we have in ensilage a\r\nmeans of preserving our green crops in a condition suitable as fodder\r\nfor as long a time as is necessary, the grounds on which this objection\r\nrests are almost entirely removed.\r\n\r\nIt will be obvious, of course, that some soils are naturally much better\r\nfitted to perform purification of sewage than others; but it must be\r\nfrankly admitted that even the best of soils can only deal with a\r\ncertain quantity of sewage. Various calculations have been indulged in\r\nas to the amount of sewage an acre of land can successfully deal with.\r\nAccording to one of these, an acre can purify some 2000 gallons per day,\r\nor that produced by 100 persons; while other calculations estimate it at\r\n60 persons; and others, again, at 150. The capacity of a sandy soil in\r\nthis respect will be much greater than that of a heavier soil; and at\r\nDantzic an acre of the sand-dunes is regarded as being capable of\r\npurifying the sewage of 600 persons. The late Dr Wallace has calculated\r\nthat, in order to treat the sewage of Glasgow, over twelve square miles\r\nof land would be required. Of course, if the sewage is subjected to\r\nprevious treatment, which is often the case, by the method immediately\r\nabout to be described--namely, precipitation--the amount of sewage the\r\nsoil is capable of purifying will be correspondingly increased. A\r\ndifficulty which may also be pointed out in connection with irrigation\r\nas a means of disposing of sewage, is the impossibility of carrying it\r\non during frosty weather, when the land is frost-bound. In warm climates\r\nirrigation has much to recommend it as a means of sewage disposal. In\r\ndamp and cold climates, on the other hand, there are many objections.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Treatment of Sewage by Precipitation, &c._\r\n\r\nWe now come to consider the methods grouped under this second heading.\r\nMechanical filtration, of course, only aims at purifying sewage to the\r\nextent of removing all insoluble suspended matter which it contains.\r\nDifferent substances have been used as filters, the most generally used\r\nbeing charcoal. Charcoal mixed with burnt clay, gravel, sand, &c., has\r\nalso been used.\r\n\r\nIn chemical precipitation, however, we have a method which claims to do\r\nmore. Beyond the extracting of all solid matters in suspension, it\r\nremoves (at any rate most chemical precipitants do) nearly all the\r\nphosphoric acid, which, next to the ammonia, is the most valuable\r\nconstituent the sewage contains. Of all precipitants, lime has been the\r\nmost universally used; and on the whole, it is perhaps the best, for it\r\nis both cheap and obtainable almost anywhere. According to an analysis\r\nby the late Professor Way, the difference in the percentages of\r\nphosphoric acid, potash, and ammonia, before and after treatment with\r\nlime, in a sample of sewage, was as follows:--\r\n\r\n _Grains per Gallon._\r\n\r\n                   Before.  After.\r\nPhosphoric acid     2.63      .45\r\nPotash              3.66     3.80\r\nAmmonia             7.48     7.50\r\n\r\nFrom the above we see that while sludge caused by lime as a precipitant\r\ncontains nearly all the phosphoric acid, there is not a trace of the\r\npotash or ammonia removed. Sulphate of alumina has also been used, both\r\nalone and in conjunction with lime. The advantage claimed by it over\r\nlime is, that the resulting precipitate is much less bulky. In other\r\nrespects, however, it does not seem to be any more efficient as a\r\nprecipitant. In the well-known A, B, C process, a mixture of alum, clay,\r\nlime, charcoal, blood, and alkaline salts, in different proportions, has\r\nbeen used. This mixture is said to extract, in addition to the\r\nphosphoric acid, a certain proportion of the ammonia; but the amount is\r\nso small as scarcely to be worth considering.\r\n\r\nNumerous other chemical substances have been used, alone and also in\r\nconjunction with one another, such as perchloride of iron, copperas,\r\nmanganese, &c. All alike, however, have failed to do more than effect\r\npartial purification,--the best results, it may be added, being obtained\r\nwhen the sewage thus treated was fresh. With regard to the manurial\r\nvalue of the resulting sludges, much difference of opinion has existed.\r\nThe small percentage of phosphoric acid and nitrogen they contain has\r\nprevented them from being used to any extent as a manure, as their value\r\ndid not admit of carriage beyond the distance of a few miles. By the\r\nintroduction a few years ago of the filter-press, their value has been\r\nconsiderably enhanced. The old method of dealing with the sludge at\r\nprecipitation-works was to allow it to dry gradually by exposure to the\r\natmosphere. The result, however, of leaving sewage-sludge with over 90\r\nper cent of water in it to dry in the air, was to encourage the rapid\r\ndecomposition and putrefaction of its organic matter, so that in many\r\ncases the decomposing sludge proved to be as great a nuisance as the\r\nunpurified sewage itself would have been. By the use of Johnson's\r\nfilter-press, however, a sludge containing 90 per cent of water was at\r\nonce reduced to 50 per cent or even less. By this means the percentage\r\nof its valuable constituents was very much increased, and the\r\nsludge-cake, besides being much more portable, was neither so\r\nobjectionable nor so liable to decomposition as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Value of Sewage-sludge._\r\n\r\nAs to the value of this sludge-cake as a manure, we are happily in\r\npossession of some very interesting and valuable experiments by\r\nProfessor Munro of Downton Agricultural College. The sludge experimented\r\nupon was that produced by sulphate of alumina, lime, and sulphate of\r\niron, and contained, after being subjected to Johnson's filter-press,\r\nfrom .6 to .9 per cent of nitrogen, and over 1 per cent of phosphoric\r\nacid. It was found that the benefit resulting from the application of\r\nthe sludge was far from what in theory might have been expected. The\r\nexperiments were made with turnips; and the results obtained with\r\nsuperphosphate and farmyard manure respectively, in the same field and\r\nunder exactly the same conditions, were contrasted with those obtained\r\nwith sludge. Thus it was found that 53 lb. of phosphoric acid as\r\nsuperphosphate, or 60 lb. as farmyard manure, produced a considerably\r\nlarger crop than 240 lb. of phosphoric acid in the sludge. That is to\r\nsay, that the phosphoric acid in the sludge did not exert more than\r\none-fifth of its theoretical effect. The explanation of this somewhat\r\nstrange result Dr Munro finds in the unsuitable physical character of\r\nthe sludge-cakes. In farmyard manure we have a loose texture and a large\r\namount of soluble constituents when well rotted. It thus quickly\r\ndistributes its fertilising elements throughout the soil. In the case of\r\nthe sludge, on the other hand, its composing particles are closely\r\ncompacted together, and thus offer the greatest resistance to mechanical\r\nand chemical disintegration. \"As a matter of fact,\" says Dr Munro, \"the\r\nsludge-plots in my experimental series were all readily identified, when\r\nthe roots were pulled, by the presence of unbroken and undecomposed\r\nclods of cake, which had evidently given up, at most, a small portion of\r\ntheir valuable ingredients to the soil.\"\r\n\r\nBriefly stated, therefore, the objections to chemical precipitation as a\r\nmeans of dealing with sewage are these--viz., that while it relieves\r\nsewage of all its organic matter, and to a large extent of its\r\nphosphoric acid, it fails to extract any ammonia, which is thus lost;\r\nthat the resulting sludge is consequently so poor in fertilising matters\r\nas scarcely to make it worth while to remove it any distance for\r\nmanuring purposes; and that, further, owing to its unfavourable\r\nphysical character, as at present made, even the small percentage of\r\nplant-food it contains is not realisable, within, at any rate, anything\r\nlike a reasonable time, to its full theoretical extent.\r\n\r\nThe most profitable method of treating sewage must be determined by\r\nvarious local conditions; and it must be clearly understood that the\r\nquestion of sewage disposal is primarily a sanitary one, and that it\r\nmust be dealt with from the sanitary aspect. The most profitable way of\r\napplying sewage as a manure, however, will doubtless be found by\r\ncombining chemical precipitation and land irrigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nLIQUID MANURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe adoption of irrigation as a means of utilising sewage, suggests a\r\nshort consideration of the value of liquid manures. It has been a custom\r\non many farms to apply the liquid manure got from the oozings of\r\nmanure-heaps, the drainings of the farmyard, byres, stables, piggeries,\r\n&c., directly to the soil. Indeed, so strongly has the belief in the\r\nsuperiority of liquid manure over other manure been held by certain\r\nfarmers, that they have washed the solid animal excreta with water, in\r\norder to extract from it its soluble fertilising constituents. The late\r\nMr Mechi was one of the foremost exponents of the value of liquid\r\nmanure. His farm of Tiptree Hall was fitted up with iron pipes for the\r\ndistribution of the manure over the different fields. Superphosphate, it\r\nmay also be added, as first made from bones by Baron Liebig, was applied\r\nin a liquid form. As to the general merits of liquid manure, there can\r\nbe no doubt that it is the most valuable form in which to apply manure.\r\nIt secures for the manurial ingredients it contains a speedy and uniform\r\ndiffusion in the soil; but, on the other hand, the expense of\r\ndistributing it makes its application far from economical. The chief\r\ningredient in liquid manure is urine. Now the removal of urine from the\r\nfarmyard manure-heap entails a severe loss of the ingredient which is\r\nmost potent in promoting fermentation. Separation of the urine from the\r\nsolid excreta is on this very account not to be recommended. Urine, when\r\napplied alone, is lacking in phosphoric acid, of which it contains mere\r\ntraces. It is not, therefore, suitable as a general manure. It has to be\r\npointed out, however, that the drainings from a manure-heap in this\r\nrespect are superior to pure urine, since they contain the soluble\r\nphosphates washed out of the solid excreta. The objections against using\r\nliquid manure may be summed up as follows:--\r\n\r\nFirst, it is too bulky a form in which to apply the manure, and hence\r\ntoo expensive; secondly, it is not advisable to deprive the solid\r\nexcreta of the liquid excreta, as the one supplements the other;\r\nthirdly, fermentation is largely fostered in the solid excreta by the\r\npresence of the liquid excreta--hence fermentation will not take place\r\nproperly in the solid excreta when deprived of the liquid excreta.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the production of liquid manure on the farm is in excess\r\nof what can be used for the proper fermentation of farmyard manure, it\r\nwill be best to utilise it for composts. No better addition to a compost\r\ncan be made than liquid manure, as it induces speedy fermentation in\r\nnearly all kinds of organic matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe use of composts is an old one. Before artificial manures were so\r\nplentiful as they are at present, much attention was paid by farmers to\r\ntheir preparation. A compost is generally made by mixing some substance\r\nof animal origin which is rich in manurial ingredients with peat or\r\nloam, and often along with lime, alkali salts, common salt, and indeed\r\nany sort of refuse which may be regarded as possessing a manurial value.\r\nComposting, in short, may be looked upon as a useful method of turning\r\nto profitable use refuse of various kinds which accumulate on the farm.\r\nThe object of composting is to promote fermentation of the materials\r\nforming the compost, and to convert the manurial ingredients they\r\ncontain into an available condition for plant needs. Composts often\r\nserve a useful purpose in retaining valuable volatile manurial\r\ningredients, such as ammonia, formed in easily fermentable substances\r\nlike urine. In fact, we may say that farmyard manure is the typical\r\ncompost, and its manufacture serves to illustrate the principles of\r\ncomposting.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Farmyard Manure a typical Compost._\r\n\r\nFarmyard manure as ordinarily made is not generally regarded as a\r\ncompost, but in the past it has been widely used for the purpose of\r\nmaking composts. Thus the practice of mixing farmyard manure with large\r\nquantities of peat has been in some parts of the world a common one.\r\nPeat, as has already been pointed out in a previous chapter, is\r\ncomparatively rich in nitrogen. When it is mixed with urine or some\r\nother putrescible substance, the peat undergoes fermentation, with the\r\nresult that its nitrogen is to a greater or less extent converted into\r\nammonia. The effect, therefore, of mixing peat with farmyard manure is\r\nbeneficial to both substances mixed: the escape of ammonia is rendered\r\nimpossible by the fixing properties of the peat, while the inert\r\nnitrogen of the peat is largely converted by fermentation into an\r\navailable form. The proportion of peat which it is advisable to add in\r\ncomposting farmyard manure will depend on the richness of the quality of\r\nthe manure: the richer the quality of the manure, the greater the amount\r\nof peat it will be able to ferment. Composts of this kind are generally\r\nmade by piling up the manure in heaps, consisting of alternate layers of\r\npeat and farmyard manure. From one to five parts of peat to every one\r\npart of farmyard manure is a common proportion. The use of such a\r\nmanure, containing so much organic matter, will exercise its best effect\r\non light sandy soils.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Composts._\r\n\r\nBut instead of farmyard manure, or in addition to farmyard manure,\r\nvarious other substances may be added, as bones, flesh, fish-scrap, and\r\nthe offal of slaughter-houses. Sometimes leaves and the dried\r\nbracken-fern are used for the manufacture of composts. Some of these\r\nsubstances contain much nitrogen or phosphoric acid, but in their\r\nnatural condition ferment when applied to the soil at a slow rate. If\r\nmixed together before application in pits with peat, leaves,\r\nbracken-fern, or some other absorbent material, fermentation proceeds\r\nevenly and rapidly. The addition of lime, potash, and soda salts has\r\nbeen found to have a most beneficial effect in promoting fermentation.\r\nThese substances, as is well known, hasten putrefaction of organic\r\nmatter. Lime seems especially to be valuable in composting. This is no\r\ndoubt due to the fact that lime plays a valuable part in promoting the\r\naction of various ferments, as has already been illustrated in the case\r\nof nitrification. The effect of large quantities of sour organic acids\r\n(humic and ulmic), which are the invariable products of the\r\ndecomposition of organic matter like peat, leaves, &c., is inimical to\r\nmicro-organic life. The action of lime is to neutralise these acids.\r\nThere can be no doubt that composting is a useful process for increasing\r\nthe fertilising properties of different more or less inert manurial\r\nsubstances. But in view of the abundant supply of concentrated\r\nfertilisers, the use of composts may considerably decrease in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nINDIRECT MANURES.\r\n\r\nLIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now come to discuss those manures which we may class under the term\r\n_Indirect_, because their value is due, not to their direct action as\r\nsuppliers of plant-food--like those manures we have hitherto been\r\nengaged in discussing--but to their indirect action. Of these by far the\r\nmost important is lime.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Antiquity of Lime as a Manure._\r\n\r\nLime is one of the oldest and one of the most popular of all manures. It\r\nis mentioned, and its wonderful action commented on, in the works of\r\nseveral ancient writers, more especially Pliny. Of late years, perhaps,\r\nits use has become restricted; and, as we shall point out by-and-by, it\r\nis well that it is so.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Action of Lime not thoroughly understood._\r\n\r\nDespite the fact of the long-established and almost universal use of\r\nlime, it can scarcely be said that we as yet clearly understand the\r\nexact nature of its action. Much light, however, has been thrown of late\r\nyears on the subject by the great advance which has been made in our\r\nknowledge of agricultural chemistry. Nevertheless, there are many points\r\nconnected with the action of lime on the soil which are still obscure.\r\nPerhaps one reason for the conflicting ideas prevalent with regard to\r\nthe value of this substance in agriculture is to be found in the fact\r\nthat it acts in such a number of different ways, and that the nature of\r\nthe changes it gives rise to in the soil is most complicated. The\r\nexperience of agriculturists with lime in one part of the country often\r\nseems contradictory to the experience of those in other parts of the\r\ncountry. Its action on different soils is very dissimilar. For these\r\nreasons, therefore, the discussion of the value of lime as a manure is\r\nby no means an easy one.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lime a necessary Plant-food._\r\n\r\nLime, as we have already pointed out in a former chapter, is a necessary\r\nplant-food, and were it present in the soil to a less extent than is\r\nactually the case, would be just as valuable a manure as the different\r\nnitrogenous and phosphatic manures; and in certain circumstances this is\r\nthe case. There are soils, though they are by no means of common\r\noccurrence, which actually lack sufficient lime for supporting\r\nplant-growth, and to which its addition directly promotes the growth of\r\nthe crop. Poor sandy soils are often of this nature. Another class of\r\nsoils are also apt to be lacking in lime--at any rate their surface-soil\r\nis. These are permanent pasture-soils. Originally there may have been an\r\nabundance of lime in the surface portion of the soil; but, as is well\r\nknown to every practical farmer, lime has a tendency to sink down in the\r\nsoil. This tendency in ordinary arable soils is largely counteracted by\r\nordinary tillage operations, such as ploughing, &c., by means of which\r\nthe lime is again brought to the surface. In permanent pasture-soils,\r\nhowever, no such counteracting action takes place, hence impoverishment\r\nof the surface-soil in lime eventually results. It is for this\r\nreason--partly at any rate--that permanent pasture benefits in an\r\nespecial degree by the application of lime. We say _partly_, for there\r\nare other important reasons. One is, that lime seems to have a striking\r\neffect in improving the quality of pastures by inducing the finer\r\ngrasses to predominate. It has also a very favourable action in\r\npromoting the growth of white clover. Another reason for the favourable\r\neffect of lime on pasture-soils is doubtless on account of the action it\r\nhas in setting potash free from its compounds. Soils, however, which\r\ndirectly benefit from the application of lime in the same way as they\r\nbenefit from the application of nitrogenous manures, may be safely said\r\nto be rare. In the great majority of soils lime exists, so far as the\r\ndemands of plant-life are concerned, in superabundance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lime of abundant Occurrence._\r\n\r\nIndeed limestone is one of the most abundant of all rock substances, and\r\nit has been calculated that it forms not less than one-sixth of the\r\nrock-mass of the earth's crust. Nearly all the commonly occurring\r\nminerals contain it, and in the course of their disintegration furnish\r\nit to the soil. Vast tracts of country are composed of nothing but\r\nlimestone; and we have examples, even in this country, of so-called\r\nchalk-soils, where it is the most abundant constituent. Nor can it be\r\nclassed amongst the insoluble mineral constituents of the soil; for\r\nalthough insoluble in pure water, it is soluble in water--such as the\r\nsoil-water--which contains carbonic acid. This is proved by the fact\r\nthat it is the chief dissolved mineral ingredient in all natural waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lime returned to the Soil in ordinary Agricultural Practice._\r\n\r\nIt may be further pointed out, as bearing upon the true function of lime\r\nwhen applied as a manure, that in ordinary agricultural practice nearly\r\nall the lime removed from the soil in crops finds its way back again to\r\nthe farm in the straw of the farmyard manure. For these reasons, then,\r\nit is clear that the true function of lime is as an indirect manure.\r\n\r\nLet us now proceed to discuss its action. Before doing so, however, it\r\nis important that we should clearly understand the different chemical\r\nforms in which it occurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Different Forms of Lime._\r\n\r\nLime occurs chiefly as carbonate of lime in the forms of limestone,\r\nmarble, or chalk, which are all chemically the same. It occurs also as\r\nsulphate of lime or gypsum, as well as in the forms of phosphate and\r\nfluoride. In agriculture it is only used--if we except the phosphate,\r\nwhich is applied not on account of its lime, but its phosphoric acid--in\r\nthe form of the carbonate or _mild_ lime as it is commonly called,\r\nburnt, caustic, or quick lime, and as gypsum. As the value of gypsum as\r\na manure is of such importance, and depends not entirely on its being a\r\ncompound of lime, we shall consider it by itself. Hence we have only to\r\nconsider here the action of mild and caustic lime.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Caustic Lime._\r\n\r\nWhen limestone or mild lime is submitted to a great heat, such as is\r\npractically done on a large scale in lime-kilns, it is converted into\r\ncaustic lime or lime proper. Limestone is made up, as we have just\r\nmentioned, of lime and carbonic acid. The latter ingredient is expelled\r\nin the form of a gas, and the lime is left behind. Lime never occurs\r\nnaturally as caustic lime, for the simple reason that it is impossible\r\nfor it to remain in this state, owing to the great affinity it has both\r\nfor water and carbonic acid.\r\n\r\nWhen lime is burnt, and before it is applied to the field, some time is\r\nallowed to elapse in order to permit of its absorbing moisture--or\r\nbecoming slaked, as it is technically called. This it does more or less\r\nslowly by absorbing moisture from the air. As, however, the process\r\nwould take too long, and as, moreover, the absorption of carbonic acid\r\ngas would also take place at the same time, lime is generally slaked in\r\nanother way. This can be done by simply adding water. An objection to\r\nthis method is, that the lime is not so uniformly slaked as is\r\ndesirable. It becomes gritty. The usual method is to cover it up with\r\ndamp earth in heaps, and allow the moisture of the earth to effect the\r\nslaking. When lime absorbs water a new chemical compound is formed,\r\nknown as lime hydrate; and so rapidly does the lime unite with water,\r\nthat a great deal of heat is evolved in the operation, the temperature\r\nproduced being considerably above that of boiling-water. The conversion\r\nof slaked lime into carbonate of lime or mild lime is a slower process.\r\nSooner or later, however, it takes place, whether the lime is left on\r\nthe surface of the soil or buried in it.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of these elementary chemical facts is necessary in order\r\nclearly to understand the nature of the action of lime in agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe respective action of quicklime and mild lime is, on the whole,\r\nsimilar, although the former is in every case very much more powerful\r\nin its effects than the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lime acts both mechanically and chemically._\r\n\r\nLime may be said to act on the soil both mechanically and chemically. It\r\nalters the texture of the soil, and affects its mechanical properties,\r\nsuch as its absorptive, retentive, and capillary powers with regard to\r\nwater. It acts upon its dormant fertility, and decomposes its mineral\r\nsubstances as well as its organic matter. Lastly, its influence on the\r\nmicro-organic life of the soil, which plays such an important part in\r\nthe preparation and elaboration of plant-food, is of the highest\r\nimportance. We cannot do better, therefore, than discuss its properties\r\nunder the headings _mechanical_, _chemical_, and _biological_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS OF LIME.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Action on Soil's Texture._\r\n\r\nThe effect of lime upon the texture of a soil is among its most striking\r\nproperties. Every farmer knows well what a transformation is effected in\r\nthe texture of a stiff clay soil by the application of a dressing of\r\nlime. The adhesive property of the soil--its objectionable tendency to\r\npuddle when mixed with water--is greatly lessened, and the soil is\r\nrendered very much more friable when it becomes dry. Several reasons\r\nexist for this change. In the first place, the tendency to puddle in a\r\nclayey soil is due to the fine state of division of the soil-particles.\r\nThe way in which lime counteracts this adhesive property is by causing a\r\ncoagulation of the fine soil-particles. This flocculation or aggregation\r\nof the fine clay-particles, when mixed with water by lime, is strikingly\r\ndemonstrated by adding to some muddy water a little lime-water. The\r\nresult will be that the water will speedily be rendered clear, the fine\r\nclay-particles coming together and sinking to the bottom of the vessel.\r\nEven a very small quantity of lime will effect this change. This\r\nproperty possessed by lime, we may mention, is utilised in the treatment\r\nof sewage. As it is the fine clay-particles that are the chief cause of\r\nthe puddling of clay soils, their flocculation does much to destroy this\r\nobjectionable property. Another reason why lime renders a clay soil more\r\nfriable when dry is, that lime does not undergo any shrinkage in dry\r\nweather. As clay soils shrink very much in drying, the mixture with such\r\na substance as lime tends to minimise this tendency to cake in hard\r\nlumps. The effect of even a very small addition of lime to a clay soil,\r\nin the way of increasing its friable nature, is very striking, and can\r\nbe easily illustrated by taking two portions of clay, into one of which\r\na small percentage of lime is introduced, and working both into a\r\nplastic mass with water, and then allowing them to dry. It will be found\r\nthat while the one is hard and resists disintegration, that portion to\r\nwhich the lime has been added crumbles away easily to a powder. This\r\neffect which lime has in \"lightening\" heavy soils has been known to last\r\nfor years. The disintegrating effect of quicklime when applied to heavy\r\nsoils is also due, it may be added, to the change undergone by the lime\r\nitself from the caustic state to the mild state.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lime renders light Soils more cohesive._\r\n\r\nAlthough it may seem somewhat paradoxical, lime, it would appear, in\r\nsome cases exercises an effect upon the soil exactly the reverse of what\r\nhas just been stated. That lime should act as a binding agent is only\r\nnatural when we reflect on the way in which it acts when used as mortar.\r\nIt is quite to be understood, therefore, that its action on light\r\nfriable soils should be to increase their cohesive powers, and at the\r\nsame time to increase the capillary power of the soil to absorb water\r\nfrom the lower layers. The extent of this action, of course, would\r\ndepend on the form in which the lime is applied, and the amount. A\r\nstriking example of the binding power of lime is to be found in certain\r\nsoils extremely rich in lime, in which what is known as a lime-pan has\r\nbeen formed at some distance from the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. CHEMICAL ACTION OF LIME.\r\n\r\nBut more important probably than even its mechanical action is the\r\nchemical action of lime. It is a most important agent in unlocking the\r\ninert fertility of the soil. This it does by decomposing different\r\nminerals and setting free the potash they contain. The disintegrating\r\npower of lime in this respect depends, of course, on its chemical\r\ncondition, the caustic form being much more potent than the other forms.\r\nIts action in decomposing vegetable matter and rendering the inert\r\nnitrogen it contains available for the plant's use, is also one of its\r\nmost important properties, and accounts for its beneficial action when\r\napplied to soils, such as peaty soils, rich in organic matter. Again,\r\nits use as a corrective for sour lands has long been practically\r\nrecognised. The presence of acidity in a soil is hurtful to vegetable\r\nlife. Lime, by neutralising this acidity, removes the sourness of the\r\nland, and does much to restore it to a condition suitable for the growth\r\nof cultivated crops. The generation of sourness in a soil is almost sure\r\nto give rise to certain poisonous compounds. Lime, therefore, in\r\nsweetening a soil, prevents the formation of these poisonous compounds.\r\nBadly drained and sour meadow-lands, as every farmer knows, are\r\nimmensely benefited by the application of this useful manure; for not\r\nmerely is their sourness removed and their general condition\r\nameliorated, but many of the coarser and lower forms of plant-life,\r\nwhich alone flourish on such soils, are killed out, and the more\r\nnutritive grasses are allowed to flourish instead. The action of lime in\r\npromoting the formation of a class of compounds of great importance in\r\nthe soil--viz., hydrated silicates--is worthy of notice. According to\r\nthe commonly accepted theory, much of the available mineral fertilising\r\nmatter of the soil is retained in the form of these hydrated silicates.\r\nHence lime, by increasing these compounds, not merely adds to the amount\r\nof the available fertility in the soil, but also increases its\r\nabsorptive power for food-constituents.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. BIOLOGICAL ACTION OF LIME.\r\n\r\nThe last way in which lime acts is what we have termed biological. By\r\nthis we mean the important _role_ lime plays in promoting or retarding,\r\nas the case may be, the various kinds of fermentative action which go on\r\nso abundantly in all soils. The presence of carbonate of lime in the\r\nsoil is a necessary condition for the process of nitrification. Lime is\r\nthe base with which the nitric acid, when it is formed, combines; and as\r\nwe have seen, when discussing nitrification, soils of a chalky nature\r\nare among those best suited to promote the natural formation of\r\nnitrates. This is one of the reasons for the beneficial effects produced\r\nby lime when applied to peaty soils. Not merely does it help to\r\ndecompose the organic matter so abundant in such soils, but it also\r\nfurnishes the base with which the nitric acid may combine when it is\r\nformed. But while the action of lime is to promote fermentation, it must\r\nnot be forgotten that there may be cases in which its action is rather\r\nthe reverse of this. Fermentation of organic matter goes on when there\r\nis a certain amount of alkalinity present; while, on the other hand, the\r\npresence of acidity seems to retard and check it. Too great an amount of\r\nalkalinity, however, would, in the first instance, retard fermentation\r\nas much as too great acidity. It has been claimed that the addition of\r\ncaustic lime to fresh urine may act in this way; and if this were so,\r\nthe addition of lime to farmyard manure might, to a certain extent, be\r\ndefended. The experiment, however, would be a hazardous one and not to\r\nbe recommended, as loss of ammonia would most likely ensue.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Action of Lime on Nitrogenous Organic Matter._\r\n\r\nThe action of lime on nitrogenous organic matter is of a very striking\r\nkind, and is by no means very clearly understood. As we have pointed\r\nout, it sometimes acts as an antiseptic or preservative; and this\r\nantiseptic or preservative action has been explained on the assumption\r\nthat insoluble albuminates of lime are formed. Its action in such\r\nindustries as calico-printing, where it has been used along with casein\r\nfor fixing colouring matter; or in sugar-refining, where it is used for\r\nclarifying the sugar by precipitating the albuminous matter in solution\r\nin the saccharine liquor; or lastly, in purifying sewage,--has been\r\ncited in support of this theory. While, however, there may be\r\ncircumstances in which lime, especially in its caustic form, acts as an\r\nantiseptic, its general tendency is to promote these fermentative\r\nchanges, such as nitrification, so important to plant-life.\r\n\r\nAn important use of lime in agriculture is in preventing the action of\r\ncertain fungoid diseases, such as \"rust,\" \"smut,\" \"finger-and-toe,\" &c.,\r\nas well as in killing, as every horticulturist and farmer knows, slugs,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Recapitulation._\r\n\r\nWe may, in conclusion, sum up in a single paragraph the different ways\r\nin which lime acts. Its action is mechanical, chemical, and biological.\r\nIt acts on the texture of the soil, rendering clay soils more friable,\r\nand exerting a certain binding effect on loose soils. It decomposes the\r\nminerals containing potash and other food-constituents, and renders them\r\navailable for the plant's needs. It further decomposes organic matter,\r\nand promotes the important process of nitrification. It increases the\r\npower of a soil to fix such valuable food-constituents as ammonia and\r\npotash. It neutralises sourness, and prevents the formation of poisonous\r\ncompounds in the soil. It increases the capillary condition of the soil,\r\nprevents fungoid diseases, and promotes the growth of the more nutritive\r\nherbage in pasture-land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nINDIRECT MANURES--GYPSUM, SALT, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nGYPSUM.\r\n\r\nIn the previous chapter mention was made of gypsum as a compound of\r\nlime, but no reference to its action as a manure was made. In the past,\r\ngypsum was used extensively and highly valued. It was found to be of\r\nespecial value for clover; and there is a story told of Benjamin\r\nFranklin which illustrates the very striking nature of its action on\r\nthis crop. It is related that he once printed with gypsum the words\r\n\"This has been plastered\" on a field of clover, and that for a long time\r\nafterwards the legend was plainly discernible on account of the\r\nluxuriance of the clover on the parts of the field which had been thus\r\ntreated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mode in which gypsum acts._\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that gypsum is a most ancient manure, it is only of\r\nlate years that we have come to understand the true nature of its\r\naction. For long it was believed that the reason of its striking effect\r\nin promoting clover was due to the fact that, as clover was a\r\nlime-loving plant, the action of gypsum was owing to the lime it\r\ncontained. That, however, the action of gypsum is not due to the fact\r\nthat it supplies lime to the plant, seems evident when it is stated that\r\nwere this so, any other form of lime would have the same beneficial\r\neffect. It is well known, however, that this is not so. Besides, as we\r\nhave already pointed out, lime is not a constituent which most soils\r\nlack, so far as the needs of the crop are concerned. There is a certain\r\namount of truth in the old belief that gypsum enriches the soil in\r\nammonia by fixing it from the air. The power that gypsum has as a fixer\r\nof ammonia has already been referred to in the chapter on Farmyard\r\nManure; but in this case the gypsum is brought in contact with the\r\nammonia. The origin of this old belief was due to a misconception as to\r\nthe amount of ammonia in the atmosphere. No doubt gypsum greatly\r\nincreases the power of a soil to absorb ammonia from the air; but the\r\nquantity of ammonia in the air is so very trifling, that its action in\r\nthis respect is hardly worth considering. The true explanation of the\r\naction of gypsum is to be found in its effect on the double silicates,\r\nwhich it decomposes, the potash being set free. Its action is similar to\r\nthat of other lime compounds, only more characteristic. As a manure,\r\ntherefore, its action is indirect, and its true function is to oust the\r\npotash from its compounds. Its peculiarly favourable action on clover is\r\ndue to the fact that clover specially benefits by potash, and that\r\nadding gypsum practically amounts to adding potash. Of course it should\r\nbe borne in mind that the soil must contain potash compounds if gypsum\r\nis to have its full effect. Now, however, that potash salts suitable for\r\nmanuring purposes are abundant, it may well be doubted whether it is not\r\nbetter to apply potash directly. Further, it must be borne in mind that\r\ngypsum is applied to the soil whenever it receives a dressing of\r\nsuperphosphate of lime, as gypsum is one of the products formed by\r\ntreating insoluble phosphate of lime with sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that gypsum may act as an oxidising agent in the soil,\r\njust as iron in the ferric condition does. It has a large quantity of\r\noxygen in its composition, and under certain conditions may act as a\r\ncarrier of oxygen to the lower layers of the soil. When it is used, it\r\nshould be applied some months before the crop is sown.\r\n\r\nGypsum, therefore, although it contains two necessary\r\nplant-constituents, lime and sulphuric acid, cannot be regarded as a\r\ndirect manure; and as its action comes to be more fully understood, its\r\nuse, which was never very abundant in this country, will probably\r\ndecrease. We have already, in the chapter on Nitrification, referred to\r\nthe action of gypsum in promoting nitrification.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALT.\r\n\r\nThe action of salt as a manure presents a problem which is at once of\r\nthe highest interest and surrounded with the greatest difficulties. In\r\nview of the large quantities now used for agricultural purposes, a\r\nsomewhat detailed examination of the nature of its action is not out of\r\nplace in a work such as the present.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Antiquity of the Use of Salt._\r\n\r\nThe recognition of the manurial functions of salt dates back to the very\r\nearliest times. Its use among the ancients is testified by numerous\r\nallusions in the Old Testament; while, according to Pliny, it was a\r\nwell-known manure in Italy. The Persians and the Chinese seem also to\r\nhave used it from time immemorial, the former more especially for\r\ndate-trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nature of its Action._\r\n\r\nDespite, however, the great antiquity of its use, much difference of\r\nopinion seems always to have existed as to the exact method of its\r\naction, and as to its merits as a manure in promoting vegetable growth.\r\nIt furnishes, in fact, a good example of the difficulty which exists in\r\nthe case of many manures, whose action is chiefly indirect, of fully\r\nunderstanding their influence on the soil and on the crop. In fact, the\r\naction of salt is probably more complicated than that of any other\r\nmanurial substance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Salt not a necessary Plant-food._\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that neither sodium nor chlorine--the two\r\nconstituent elements of salt--are in all probability absolutely\r\nnecessary plant-foods. If they are necessary, the plant only requires\r\nthem in minute quantities. Despite this fact, soda is an ash-constituent\r\nof nearly every plant, and in many cases one of the most abundant. In\r\namount it is one of the most variable of all the ash-constituents, being\r\npresent in some plants only in minute quantities, while in others it\r\noccurs in large quantities. Mangel and plants of the cabbage tribe may\r\nbe cited as examples of plants containing large amounts of soda in their\r\ncomposition. But the plants which contain it in largest quantity are\r\nthose which thrive on the sea-coast, and it has been thought that for\r\nthem at least salt is a necessary manure. This, however, does not seem\r\nto be the case. In fact, the amount of soda in a plant seems to be\r\nlargely a matter of accident. It may be added that the succulent\r\nportions of a plant are generally richest in soda.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Can Soda replace Potash?_\r\n\r\nAgain, it has been believed that soda is capable of replacing potash in\r\nthe plant; but this does not seem to be the case to any extent. The view\r\nthat soda is able to replace potash, it has been thought, is supported\r\nby the variation which exists in the proportion of soda and potash in\r\ndifferent plants. It must be remembered, however, that it is highly\r\nprobable that most plants contain a larger quantity of ash-constituents\r\nthan is absolutely necessary for their healthy growth. Especially is\r\nthis the case with such a necessary plant-food as potash, of which there\r\nis generally present, in all likelihood, an excess. The variation in the\r\nquantity of potash and soda present in many plants under different\r\ncircumstances can scarcely, therefore, be regarded as furnishing a proof\r\nof the replacement of potash by soda. Incidentally we may mention, as a\r\nfact worthy of notice, that cultivated plants have more potash and less\r\nsoda in their composition than wild plants. What has been said of soda\r\nmay be held to apply equally to chlorine, as it seems to be chiefly in\r\nthe form of common salt that soda enters the plant. The amount of salt,\r\ntherefore, present in plants must be regarded as largely accidental and\r\ndependent on external circumstances, such as the nature of the soil, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Salt of universal Occurrence._\r\n\r\nBut even were salt a necessary plant-food, its occurrence in the soil is\r\nalready of sufficient abundance to obviate any necessity for its\r\napplication. It may be said to be of almost universal occurrence. Even\r\nthe air contains it in traces. That this is the case in the\r\nneighbourhood of the sea-coast is well known; but even in air far\r\ninland, accurate analysis of the air would probably demonstrate its\r\npresence in greater quantity than is commonly believed. It is a wise\r\nprovision that plants absorb salt, for it increases their efficiency as\r\nfood,--the function of salt as a constituent of animal food being of the\r\nvery highest importance. It is an indispensable food-ingredient for\r\nanimal life. With regard to ordinary farm-stock, the amount of salt\r\nwhich naturally occurs in their food is quite sufficient. In the case,\r\nhowever, of pastures in countries far removed from the sea, the custom\r\nof specially supplying stock with salt is common. This is done by\r\nplacing a piece of rock-salt in the fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Special Sources of Salt._\r\n\r\nThe salt of commerce is obtained from various sources. Besides the sea,\r\nwe have ample sources of salt in the large saline deposits found in many\r\nparts of Europe, especially in Austria, and in England in Cheshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Action of Salt indirect._\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said above, it is clear that the action of salt as a\r\nmanure is indirect and not direct. What the nature of that indirect\r\naction is we shall now proceed to discuss.\r\n\r\nIn considering the evidence of the manurial value of salt, we are at\r\nonce brought face to face with the fact that the experience of its\r\naction in the past has as often been unfavourable as favourable. Salt,\r\nit is well known, is both an antiseptic and a germicide. It is, indeed,\r\none of the most commonly used of preservatives. When applied in large\r\nquantities to the soil, it has a most deleterious action on vegetation.\r\nThis hurtful action of salt has long been known; and it is as often\r\nmentioned in the writings of antiquity on account of its unfavourable as\r\non account of its favourable action. Thus, for example, among the\r\nancient Jews it was customary, after the conquest of a hostile town, to\r\nstrew salt on the enemy's fields, for the purpose of rendering them\r\nbarren and unfertile. And again, among the Romans, for the same purpose,\r\nsalt was often spread on a spot where some great crime had been\r\ncommitted.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, its unfavourable action has long been known, the fact\r\nthat there are circumstances under which its action is, on the contrary,\r\nfavourable for promoting vegetable growth has also been long recognised.\r\nThe difficulty for the agricultural student is to reconcile these two\r\nseemingly contradictory experiences. For the English agriculturist the\r\nsubject possesses especial interest, since in England it has been in the\r\npast most generally used and its action most discussed since the time of\r\nLord Bacon, who discusses in his writings the action of solutions of it\r\non different plants.\r\n\r\nThe true explanation of salt being so different in its action is to be\r\nfound in the quantity applied, the nature of the soil, the crop to which\r\nit is applied, and the conditions under which it is applied--_i.e._,\r\nwhether it is applied alone or along with other manures.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mechanical Action on Soils._\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it must be noted that salt exerts a mechanical\r\naction on the soil of a very similar kind to that exercised by lime.\r\nWhen applied to clay soils it causes a flocculation or coagulation of\r\nthe fine clay-particles, and thus prevents the soil from puddling to the\r\nsame extent as would otherwise be the case. In fact, an example of this\r\naction of salt when in solution causing the precipitation of fine\r\nsuspended clayey matter, is afforded by the formation of deltas at the\r\nmouths of rivers. The power of clarifying muddy water is common indeed\r\nto saline solutions. Schloesing attributes the clarifying power of a\r\nsoil to the presence of the saline matters it contains; and from this\r\npoint of view it would appear that manures containing any saline\r\nsubstance may exert an important mechanical influence on the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Solvent Action._\r\n\r\nBut a much more important property of salt is its solvent action on the\r\nplant-food present in the soil. Its action in decomposing the minerals\r\ncontaining lime, magnesia, potash, &c., is similar to the action of\r\ngypsum. By acting upon the double silicates it liberates these necessary\r\nplant-foods. It is not only on the basic substances upon which it acts,\r\nbut also on the phosphoric and silicic acids, which it sets free. Its\r\npower of dissolving ammonia from the soil is considerable. Experiments\r\nwith a weak solution of salt on a soil by Peters and Eichhorn to test\r\nits solvent power, showed that the salt solution dissolved more than\r\ntwice as much potash and nearly thirty times as much ammonia as an equal\r\nquantity of pure water did. When applied to the soil, it seems chiefly\r\nto liberate lime and magnesia. The exact nature of the chemical action\r\ntaking place is a point of some dubiety. According to some, it is\r\nchanged into nitrate of soda; according to others, into carbonate of\r\nsoda. The latter theory seems to be the more probable one. Its action on\r\nthe lime and magnesia compounds is to convert them into chlorides; and\r\nthis chemical reaction explains the action that salt has in increasing\r\nthe water-retaining and water-absorbing power of the soil; for the\r\nchlorides of magnesia and lime are salts which have a great power of\r\nattracting water from the air.\r\n\r\nAgain, the very fact that salt acts as an antiseptic may serve to\r\nexplain its beneficial action in certain cases where it prevents\r\nrankness of growth. No doubt this was its function when applied along\r\nwith Peruvian guano. This it might do by preventing too rapid\r\nfermentation (nitrification) of the manure, or by actually weakening the\r\nplant. Its action when applied with farmyard manure may also be similar.\r\nBut while its effect in many cases may be towards retarding\r\nfermentation, on the other hand its action, when applied along with lime\r\nto compost-heaps, is towards promoting more rapid decomposition.\r\nProbably a reaction takes place between the lime and the salt, the\r\nresult of which is the formation of caustic soda.\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the ways in which salt may act. It must at once be seen\r\nhow its action in one case will be favourable and in another case\r\nunfavourable. There must be fertilising matter present in the soil if it\r\nis to act favourably. Again, it will only be under such circumstances,\r\nwhere rankness of growth is likely to ensue, that its antiseptic\r\nproperties will act favourably and not unfavourably.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Best used in small Quantities along with Manures._\r\n\r\nProbably it is for these reasons that its action has been found to be\r\nmost favourable when applied along with other manures and not alone.\r\nApplied along with nitrate of soda, as is commonly done, it doubtless\r\nincreases the efficiency of the nitrate. Some plants seem to be\r\nundoubtedly benefited by salt: of these flax may be mentioned. The\r\napplication of salt to plants of the cabbage tribe seems also to be\r\nhighly beneficial. On mangels, along with other manures, it has also\r\nbeen found to have a very favourable effect. But with many crops its\r\naction has been proved to be less favourable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Affects Quality of Crop._\r\n\r\nAlthough salt has often been found to increase the quantity of a crop,\r\nthe quality of the crop has been made to suffer. Its action on beetroot\r\nhas been more especially studied. The effect of its application is to\r\nlessen the total quantity of dry matter and sugar in the plant. This has\r\nbeen found to be the case both when the salt was applied alone and along\r\nwith nitrate of soda and other manures. On potatoes, again, its action\r\nhas been found to be deleterious, lessening their percentage of starch.\r\nThe deleterious action of chlorides on the quality of potatoes is also\r\nseen when potassium chloride is applied. It is for this reason that\r\npotash should never be applied to the potato crop in the form of\r\nchloride.\r\n\r\nIn the late Dr Voelcker's opinion, the conditions under which salt had\r\nthe most favourable action on the mangel crop was in the case of a light\r\nsandy soil, and applied at the rate of 4 to 5 cwt. per acre. Its action\r\nwhen applied to clay soils was not so favourable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rate of Application._\r\n\r\nLastly, the rate at which it may be applied will naturally vary. From 1\r\ncwt. and even less, up to 6 cwt. or even more, has been the rate at\r\nwhich it has been commonly applied in the past. From what has been said,\r\nit will be seen that it is more likely to exert a favourable influence\r\nwhen applied only in small quantities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTHE APPLICATION OF MANURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conditions which regulate the application of manures are many and\r\nvaried, and the subject, it must be admitted, despite the large amount\r\nof investigation already carried out, is most imperfectly understood.\r\nFor these reasons it is impossible to do little more than lay down\r\ncertain general principles which may be of service to the agriculturist\r\nin guiding him in carrying out the manuring of his crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Influence of Manures in increasing Soil-fertility._\r\n\r\nIn the first place it may be asked, How far can what we may call the\r\npermanent fertility of a field be influenced by the application of\r\nmanures? And to this question the answer must be made, that the\r\ninfluence of manuring in increasing soil-fertility is very slight and\r\nonly very gradually felt. This is illustrated by the difficulty\r\nexperienced in attempting to restore to a fertile condition a soil which\r\nhas long been treated by an exhaustive system of cultivation. In such a\r\ncase it will be found impossible to restore the fertility of the soil,\r\nexcept very gradually. Farmers who farm in new countries, and in rich\r\nvirgin soils, little realise sometimes how quickly they may impoverish\r\nthe fertility of their soils by exhaustive treatment, and how slow the\r\nprocess of restoration is. Nor is this strange when we reflect on the\r\nrelatively small quantities of fertilising ingredients we are in the\r\nhabit of adding to the soil by the application of manures, and the\r\nnature of their action. The small rate at which they are applied, and\r\nthe impossibility of distributing them equally in the soil, explain how\r\ncomparatively limited their action must necessarily be. Some manures, it\r\nis true--viz., those which are soluble--are more equally distributed;\r\nbut then such manures, from their very nature, are little likely to\r\naffect the permanent fertility of the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Influence of Farmyard Manure on the Soil._\r\n\r\nOf manures which have the best effect in improving a soil's permanent\r\nfertility, farmyard manure is undoubtedly the most important. This is\r\nowing partly to the fact that it is applied in such large quantities,\r\nand partly on account of its composition. Liberal manuring with farmyard\r\nmanure, systematically carried out, will in time do much to build up a\r\nsoil's fertility. But liberal manuring with artificial manures will also\r\neffect the same end. This it does in an indirect manner by means of the\r\nincreased crop residues obtained under such treatment. Indeed one of the\r\nspeediest methods of bringing a soil into good condition is by heavily\r\nmanuring certain green crops, and then ploughing them in.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Farmyard Manure v. Artificials._\r\n\r\nThe question how far farmyard manure may be supplanted by artificials is\r\none often discussed. We have already referred to this question in the\r\nchapter on Farmyard Manure. It is possible that, with our increasing\r\nknowledge of agricultural science, we may in the future be able to\r\ndispense with farmyard manure, and make shift to do with artificials\r\nalone. At present, however, all our experience points to the fact that\r\nthe most satisfactory results are obtained from manures by using\r\nartificials in conjunction with farmyard manure. It is better both for\r\nfarmyard manure and artificial manures to be applied together,[241] so\r\nthat they may mutually act as supplementary the one to the other. While\r\nthis is so, there may be circumstances in which it will be best to use\r\nartificials alone. Where, for example, fields, owing to their situation,\r\nare inaccessible, and where the expense of conveying the bulky farmyard\r\nmanure would be very considerable, it may be found more economical to\r\napply the more concentrated artificial manures. With few exceptions,\r\nhowever, it will be found most desirable to use artificial manures as\r\nsupplementary to farmyard manure, and not as substitutes for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Farmyard Manure not favourable to certain Crops._\r\n\r\nWhile the above is true, it may be well to point out one or two facts\r\nregarding the nature of the influence of farmyard manure on certain\r\ncrops. For instance, it has long been recognised as inadvisable in\r\nstrong rich soils to apply it directly to certain grain crops, such as\r\nbarley and wheat, since such a practice is apt to encourage rankness of\r\ngrowth--an undue development of straw at the expense of the grain. It is\r\nconsequently customary to apply farmyard manure to the preceding crop.\r\nThe direct application of farmyard manure to wheat, however, according\r\nto Sir J. B. Lawes, is not fraught with unfavourable results where the\r\nsoil is a light one; it is only when the soil is of a heavy nature that\r\nit is best to apply it to the preceding crop. Potatoes are another crop\r\nto which it is best not to apply it directly. On the other hand, many\r\nare of the opinion that mangels seem to be able to benefit from large\r\napplications of farmyard manure.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conditions determining the Application of Artificial Manures._\r\n\r\nIn the application of artificial manures a large number of\r\nconsiderations have to be taken into account. Among these may be\r\nmentioned the nature of the manure itself, and its mechanical and\r\nchemical condition; the nature of the soil and its previous treatment\r\nwith manures, as well as the nature of the climate, the nature of the\r\ncrop, and the previous cropping. It may be well, therefore, to examine\r\nsomewhat in detail some of these considerations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nature of the Manure._\r\n\r\nNitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash exist in the common manures, as\r\nhas already been pointed out, in different states of availability.\r\nNitrogen, for example, may exist in a soluble or insoluble condition, as\r\nnitrates, as ammonia, or in various organic forms. Phosphoric acid,\r\nsimilarly, may exist in a soluble form, as it does in superphosphate of\r\nlime, or in an insoluble form, as it does in bones or basic slag.\r\nPotash, on the other hand, exists--or should exist--in artificial\r\nmanures only in a soluble form. Now a correct knowledge of the behaviour\r\nof these different forms of the common manurial ingredients when applied\r\nto the soil is, in the first place, necessary for their successful and\r\neconomical use.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nitrogenous Manures._\r\n\r\nThus our knowledge of the inability of the soil-particles to retain\r\nnitrogen in the form of nitric acid, as well as our knowledge of the\r\nfact that nitrogen is in this form immediately available for the\r\nplant's needs, teaches us that nitrate of soda should never be applied\r\nbefore the plant is ready to utilise it--in short, that it should only\r\nbe applied as a top-dressing; and further, that the use of such a\r\nfertiliser in a damp season is less likely to be economical than in a\r\ndry one. Again, with regard to nitrogen in the form of ammonia salts,\r\nour knowledge of the fact that ammonia is retained by the\r\nsoil-particles, and that before it becomes available for the plant's\r\nneeds it has to undergo the process of nitrification, teaches us the\r\ndesirability of applying it a short time before it is likely to be used.\r\nWhile, lastly, with regard to the nitrogen in the various organic forms\r\nin which it occurs, our knowledge of the rate at which these are\r\nconverted into an available form in the soil will determine when they\r\nare best applied. Some forms of organic nitrogen are in a soluble\r\ncondition, and are quite as speedy in their action as sulphate of\r\nammonia. This is the case with a considerable proportion of the\r\ndifferent organic forms of nitrogen present in guano. Other forms of\r\norganic nitrogen are only slightly less so--as, for example, dried\r\nblood, which ferments very speedily. With regard, therefore, to nitrates\r\nand ammonia salts, as well as the more quickly available organic forms\r\nof nitrogen, they should either be applied as a top-dressing after the\r\nplant has started growth, or only shortly before seed-time. Bones,\r\nshoddy, and the various so-called native guanos, should be applied a\r\nconsiderable period before they are likely to be required--not later\r\nthan the previous autumn.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Phosphatic Manures._\r\n\r\nWith regard to phosphatic manures the same considerations hold good.\r\nInasmuch as phosphoric acid, whether applied in the soluble condition,\r\nas in superphosphate, or the insoluble form, as in bones, basic slag,\r\n&c., is not liable to be washed out of the soil, the risk of loss is\r\nvery slight, and need not be taken into account. As we have pointed out\r\nin considering the action of superphosphate, phosphoric acid in this\r\nlatter form is more speedily available to the crop, and the necessity of\r\napplying it much before it is likely to be used does not exist. Hence\r\nsuperphosphate and manures which contain any appreciable amount of\r\nsoluble phosphoric acid, such as guano, should only be applied shortly\r\nbefore seed-time. Bones, basic slag, or mineral phosphate ought to be\r\napplied, on the other hand, a long time before they are likely to be\r\nused. Hence an autumn application is to be recommended in the case of\r\nsuch manures.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Potash Manures._\r\n\r\nLastly, with regard to potash manures, as these are soluble, there is no\r\nnecessity for applying them much before they are likely to be absorbed\r\nby the plant. Some are of the opinion that potash is, except in the case\r\nof sandy soils, best applied some little time before it is likely to be\r\nused, so as to permit of its being washed down into the soil--a process\r\nwhich takes place only comparatively slowly. As potash manures have\r\noften been found to give a better result on pastures during the second\r\nyear than during the first, they are best applied in the autumn.\r\n\r\nThe above statement as to the behaviour of the different fertilisers\r\nwhen applied to the soil, has a not unimportant bearing on the\r\nquantities in which they may safely be respectively applied. The rate at\r\nwhich manures may be applied depends, as we shall immediately see, on\r\nother conditions; but what it is here desirable to point out is, that it\r\nis not safe to apply such manures as nitrate of soda, or, for that\r\nmatter, sulphate of ammonia, in large quantities at a time. In fact\r\nthese manures, especially the former, will best be applied in very small\r\nquantities, and rather in several doses. With regard to other manures,\r\nmore especially phosphatic manures, the same reasons for small\r\napplication do not exist.\r\n\r\nThe truth of the above statements is so obvious that it may be regarded\r\nas superfluous to make them. As, however, their clear apprehension is\r\nessential to understanding the conditions of successful manuring, no\r\napology need be made for making them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nature of Soil._\r\n\r\nAnother condition which has to be taken into account in considering the\r\napplication of manures is the nature of the soil, as well as its\r\nprevious treatment. Soils poor in organic matter are those which are\r\nmost likely to be benefited by the application of nitrogenous manures.\r\nSoils of a dry light character require less phosphoric acid than they do\r\nof nitrogen and potash; while on a damp and heavy soil phosphatic\r\nmanures are more likely to be beneficial than nitrogenous or potassic\r\nmanures. Lastly, a soil rich in organic matter generally requires\r\nphosphates, and possibly potash. A point of considerable importance to\r\nnotice is, that a soil rich in lime can stand a larger application of\r\nphosphoric acid than one poor in lime. As a rule, it will be found that\r\nthe best results with potash will be obtained when applied to a sandy\r\nsoil. The nature of the soil is an important consideration in\r\ndetermining how far it is advisable to apply readily soluble manures. To\r\na very light and non-retentive soil the risk of loss in applying an\r\neasily soluble manure is considerably increased. The nature of the\r\nclimate is also of importance. Thus, in a dry climate, manures of a\r\nsoluble nature will have a better effect than in a wet climate, while\r\nthe opposite will be the case with the more slowly acting manures.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nature of previous Manuring._\r\n\r\nA consideration of equal importance is the previous treatment of the\r\nsoil with manure. For example, where a soil has been liberally treated\r\nwith farmyard manure, it has been found that mineral manures have a\r\nvery inferior effect to that obtained by nitrogenous manure. Lawes and\r\nGilbert have found this to be strikingly the case in their experiments\r\non the growth of wheat. In these experiments it was found that the\r\napplication of mineral manures was accompanied with little or no benefit\r\nto the crop, whereas very striking results followed the application of\r\nnitrogen. This they attributed to the fact that the supply of mineral\r\nfertilisers in the straw of the farmyard manure is largely in excess of\r\nthe supply of nitrogen. The nature of the action of the manure\r\npreviously applied is also to be taken into account in determining how\r\nlong its influence may probably last. Where, for example, the manure has\r\nbeen nitrate of soda or sulphate of ammonia, it may be safely concluded\r\nthat its direct influence is no longer felt a year after application.\r\nThe influence of superphosphate of lime, while scarcely so temporary,\r\nmay be said to last only for a comparatively short time.[242] On the\r\nother hand, when the manure applied is of a slow-acting nature, such as\r\nbones or basic slag, its influence will probably be felt for a number of\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nature of the Crop._\r\n\r\nBut more important than any of the above-mentioned conditions is the\r\nnature of the crop itself. Our knowledge of the requirements of the\r\ndifferent farm crops is still very imperfect. A very wide experience,\r\nhowever, of the effect of different manures on different crops, has\r\nconclusively proved that their manurial requirements differ very\r\nconsiderably. The subject is complicated by other considerations, such\r\nas the nature of the soil, &c.; but notwithstanding this fact, certain\r\npoints seem to be pretty well established.\r\n\r\nIn seeking to understand the respective requirements of the different\r\ncrops for different fertilisers, two important considerations must be\r\nborne in mind. These are--(1) _the quantities of the three fertilising\r\ningredients--nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash--which different\r\ncrops remove from the soil;_ and (2) _the different power crops possess\r\nof assimilating these ingredients._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amounts of Fertilising Ingredients removed from the Soil by different\r\nCrops._\r\n\r\nThe most convenient way of instituting a comparison between the\r\nrequirements of the different crops in this respect is by calculating\r\nthe amount, in pounds, of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash, which\r\naverage amounts of the different crops remove per acre. The following\r\ntable shows this for the common crops:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                 FERTILISING INGREDIENTS REMOVED FROM SOIL.\r\n----------------------------+-----------+------------+----------\r\n                            | Nitrogen. | Phosphoric |  Potash.\r\n                            |           |    Acid.   |\r\n----------------------------+-----------+------------+----------\r\nMangels {Root, 22 tons      |    87     |    36.4    |   222.8\r\n        {Leaf               |    51     |    16.5    |    77.9\r\n                            |-----------|------------|----------\r\n             Total crop     |   138     |    52.9    |   300.7\r\n                            |-----------+------------+----------\r\nTurnips {Root, 17 tons      |    63     |    22.4    |   108.6\r\n        {Leaf               |    49     |    10.7    |    40.2\r\n                            |-----------+------------+----------\r\n             Total crop     |   112     |    33.1    |   148.8\r\n                            |-----------+------------+----------\r\nBeans   {Grain, 30 bushels  |    77     |    22.8    |    24.3\r\n        {Straw              |    29     |     6.3    |    42.8\r\n                            |-----------+------------+----------\r\n             Total crop     |   106     |    29.1    |    67.1\r\n                            |-----------+------------+----------\r\nRed clover hay, 2 tons      |   102     |    24.9    |    83.4\r\n                            |-----------+------------+----------\r\nSwedes  {Root, 14 tons      |    70     |    16.9    |    63.3\r\n        {Leaf               |    28     |     4.8    |    16.4\r\n                            |-----------+------------+----------\r\n             Total crop     |    98     |    21.7    |    79.7\r\n                            |-----------+------------+----------\r\nOats    {Grain, 45 bushels  |    38     |    13.0    |     9.1\r\n        {Straw              |    17     |     6.4    |    37.0\r\n                            |-----------+------------+----------\r\n             Total crop     |    55     |    19.4    |    46.1\r\n                            |-----------+------------+----------\r\nMeadow hay, 1-1/2 ton,      |    49     |    12.3    |    50.9\r\n                            |-----------+------------+----------\r\nWheat   {Grain, 30 bushels  |    33     |    16.0    |     9.8\r\n        {Straw              |    15     |     4.7    |    25.9\r\n                            |-----------+------------+----------\r\n             Total crop     |    48     |    20.7    |    35.7\r\n                            |-----------+------------+----------\r\nBarley  {Grain, 30 bushels  |    35     |    16.0    |     9.8\r\n        {Straw              |    13     |     4.7    |    25.9\r\n                            |-----------+------------+----------\r\n             Total crop     |    48     |    20.7    |    35.7\r\n                            |-----------+------------+----------\r\nPotatoes, 6 tons            |    47     |    21.5    |    76.5\r\n                            |-----------+------------+----------\r\nMaize   {Grain, 30 bushels  |    28     |    10.0    |     6.5\r\n        {Stalks, &c.        |    15     |     8.0    |    29.8\r\n                            |-----------+------------+----------\r\n             Total crop     |    43     |    18.0    |    36.3\r\n----------------------------+-----------+------------+----------\r\n\r\nFrom the table it will be seen that the crops which remove the largest\r\nquantities of all three fertilising ingredients are the root\r\ncrops--mangels and turnips; that beans remove twice as much nitrogen as\r\nthe cereals--oats, barley, and wheat--which, in this respect,\r\npractically differ very little from one another; while potatoes remove\r\nabout the same quantity of nitrogen as the cereals. It will further be\r\nnoticed that the amounts of phosphoric acid removed by the different\r\ncrops differ very much less than those of nitrogen and potash. Mangels\r\nremove slightly more, and turnips slightly less, than double the amount\r\nremoved by cereals. Meadow-hay, it will be seen, of all crops removes\r\nthe least phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nIn looking at the amounts of potash, we are at once struck by their\r\ngreat discrepancy. Such a crop as mangels removes more than six times as\r\nmuch potash from the soil as the cereals. Turnips also make large\r\ndemands on this ingredient, removing over four times as much as the\r\ncereals. Leguminous crops, such as red clover and beans, remove about\r\ntwice as much.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Capacity of Crops for assimilating Manures._\r\n\r\nInstructive though these figures undoubtedly are, _they must not be\r\nregarded, as often erroneously they are, as furnishing by themselves\r\nsufficient data upon which to base the practice of manuring_. A\r\nconsideration which is of much greater importance is the capacity that\r\ndifferent crops possess for assimilating the various manurial\r\ningredients from the soil. Considered from the point of view of absolute\r\namount, there is in most soils an abundant supply of plant-food; but of\r\nthis amount only a small proportion is available. Further, the amount of\r\nthis available plant-food will vary with different crops--one crop being\r\nable to grow where another crop would starve. As illustrative of this,\r\nin the Norfolk experiments it was found that the turnip was able to\r\nassimilate potash from a soil on which the swede was practically\r\nstarved. It is on this fact more than any other that the principles of\r\nmanuring are based. Several explanations of the different capacities\r\ncrops possess of assimilating their food may be put forward. And we may\r\nhere point out that crops belonging to the same class exhibit, on the\r\nwhole, a certain amount of similarity in their manurial requirements.\r\nThus, for example, we may say that _gramineous crops_ so far resemble\r\none another in possessing _small capacity for assimilating nitrogen_,\r\n_root crops for assimilating phosphoric acid_, and _leguminous crops for\r\nassimilating potash_, and that, consequently, these crops are generally\r\nmost benefited by the application, respectively, of nitrogen, phosphoric\r\nacid, and potash. But while a certain general resemblance exists, crops\r\nbelonging to the same class differ in many cases very considerably, as\r\nwe shall immediately see.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Difference in Root Systems of different Crops._\r\n\r\nOne explanation of the different capacity possessed by different crops\r\nfor absorbing plant-food from the soil is to be found in the difference\r\nof their root systems. Every agriculturist knows that crops in this\r\nrespect differ very widely. Crops having deep roots will naturally have\r\na larger surface of soil from which to draw their food-supplies than\r\ncrops having shallower roots. Such crops as red clover, wheat, and\r\nmangels are able to draw their food-supplies from the subsoil to an\r\nextent not possessed by shallower-rooted crops, such as barley, turnips,\r\nand grass. Crops having surface-roots, on the other hand, have often\r\ngreater capacity for assimilating nitrogen,--this ingredient, as has\r\nalready been pointed out, being chiefly located in the surface-soil. The\r\ntendency of growing shallow-rooted crops will therefore be towards\r\nimpoverishing the surface-soil; whereas the occasional growth of a\r\ndeep-rooted crop brings the plant-food in the subsoil into requisition.\r\nIn this connection it may be well to draw attention to the singular\r\ncapacity possessed by certain crops for absorbing nitrogen. Of these the\r\ncase of clover is the most striking, and has long puzzled\r\nagriculturists. The discovery, which has been repeatedly referred to in\r\nthese pages, that the leguminous order of crops, to which clover\r\nbelongs, have the power of absorbing the free nitrogen of the air\r\nthrough the agency of micro-organic life in the plant and in the soil,\r\nhas furnished an explanation of this long-debated problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Period of Growth._\r\n\r\nA further reason is the difference in the period of a crop's growth. A\r\ncrop which grows quickly, and consequently occupies the ground during a\r\ncomparatively short period, will naturally require a richer soil, and\r\ntherefore a more liberal treatment with manure, than one whose growth is\r\nmore gradual.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration is the season of the year during which active\r\ngrowth of the crops takes place. For example, in the case of the wheat\r\ncrop, active growth takes place in spring and ceases early in the\r\nsummer. Since, however, nitrification goes on right through the summer,\r\nand nitrates are most abundant in the soil in late summer and autumn,\r\nsuch a crop as wheat is ill suited to obtain any benefit from this\r\nbountiful provision of nature, and is consequently particularly\r\nbenefited by the application of nitrogenous manures. Root crops, on the\r\nother hand, sown in summer, continue their active growth into autumn,\r\nand are thus enabled to utilise the nitrates formed in the process of\r\nnitrification. The custom of sowing a quickly growing green crop, such\r\nas rye, mustard, rape, &c., after a wheat crop, is a practice which aims\r\nat conserving the nitrates and preventing their loss by autumn and\r\nwinter rains. The name \"catch crop\" has been applied to such a crop. By\r\nploughing under the green crop, the nitrogen removed from the soil in\r\nthe form of easily soluble nitrates is restored in an insoluble organic\r\nform, and the soil is at the same time enriched by the addition of much\r\nvaluable organic matter.[243]\r\n\r\nIt is chiefly the above facts that form the scientific basis of the\r\nlong-pursued practice of the rotation of crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Variation in Composition of Crops._\r\n\r\nA point of considerable interest is the influence exerted by manures on\r\nthe composition of crops. It has been assumed in the preceding pages\r\nthat the composition of crops of the same plant is uniform; but this is\r\nnot strictly the case, as it has been proved that not merely the manure\r\nand soil have an appreciable influence on the crop's composition, but so\r\nalso has the climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Absorption of Plant-food._\r\n\r\nThe laws regulating the absorption of plant-food are most interesting,\r\nalthough, unfortunately, very imperfectly understood as yet. The\r\nfertilising ingredients are capable of considerable movement in the\r\nplant, and are only absorbed up to a certain period of growth. This in\r\nmany plants is reached when they flower. After this period they are no\r\nlonger capable of absorbing any more food. The popular belief that\r\nplants in ripening exhaust the soil of its fertilising matters is\r\nconsequently a fallacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fertilising Ingredients lodge in the Seed._\r\n\r\nThe tendency of fertilising matters is to move upward in the plant as it\r\nmatures, and finally to become lodged in the seed. It is for this reason\r\nthat the cereals prove such an exhaustive crop. That nature, however,\r\ncan in certain cases be very economical of her food-supplies, is\r\nstrikingly illustrated by the fact that much of the fertilising matter\r\ncontained in the mature leaves in autumn passes back into the tree\r\nbefore the leaves fall from it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Forms in which Nitrogen exists in Plants._\r\n\r\nThe form in which nitrogen is present in the plant is chiefly as\r\nalbuminoids. As, however, albuminoids belong to that class of bodies\r\nknown as colloids, which cannot easily pass through porous membranes\r\nlike those forming the walls of plant-cells, they are changed during\r\ncertain periods of the plant's growth into amides, which are\r\ncrystalloids, and consequently able to move freely about in the plant.\r\nAmides are most abundant in young plants during the period of their most\r\nactive growth, and as the plant ripens the amides seem to be largely\r\nconverted into albuminoids.\r\n\r\nWhile the subject is not very clearly understood, it would seem to be\r\npretty conclusively proved that there is a direct relation between the\r\namount of the phosphoric acid and of the nitrogen absorbed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bearing of above Facts on Agricultural Practice._\r\n\r\nThe bearing of these facts upon practice is obvious. In the first place,\r\nthey show how important it is that plants should be well fed when they\r\nare young, and that in the practice of green manuring it is best to\r\nplough in the crop when it is in flower, as no additional benefit is\r\ngained by allowing it to ripen, seeing that no further absorption of\r\nfertilising ingredients takes place after the period of flowering.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Influence of excessive Manuring of Crops._\r\n\r\nThe influence of large quantities of manures is seen in the case of\r\ncertain root crops. It is found, in such a case, that while the roots\r\nare larger, they are more watery in composition and of less nutritive\r\nvalue. Again, it seems to be a fact pretty generally known to practical\r\nmen, that nitrate of soda seems to have a bad effect on the quality of\r\nhay. It would seem, further, that the influence of nitrogenous\r\nfertilisers on cereals is to increase the percentage of nitrogen in the\r\ngrain, but that they have no such influence in the case of leguminous\r\ncrops. Phosphatic manures, on the other hand, in the case of leguminous\r\ncrops, seem to have the effect of diminishing the amount of nitrogen in\r\nthe seed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[241] Though not necessarily at the same time or to each succeeding\r\ncrop. There may be comparatively long intervals between the applications\r\nof farmyard manure in many cases.\r\n\r\n[242] Of course what is meant here is the direct influence of such\r\nmanures. Their indirect value may be shown in the soil by the increased\r\ncrop residues they give rise to.\r\n\r\n[243] This is very concisely and clearly put in Mr Warington's admirable\r\n'Chemistry of the Farm.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nMANURING OF THE COMMON FARM CROPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this chapter we shall attempt to summarise briefly the results of\r\nexperiments on the manuring of some of the commoner crops, and we shall\r\nstart with the manuring of cereals.\r\n\r\n\r\nCEREALS.\r\n\r\nAs we have already pointed out, a certain similarity in the manurial\r\nrequirements of the different members of this class exists. They are\r\ncharacterised, for one thing, by the comparatively small quantity of\r\nnitrogen they remove from the soil--less than either leguminous or root\r\ncrops. Of this nitrogen the larger proportion--amounting to\r\ntwo-thirds--is contained in the grain, the straw only containing about a\r\nquarter of the total amount of nitrogen in the plant. The amount of\r\nphosphoric acid they remove from the soil is not much less than that\r\nremoved by the other two classes of crops; but this, again, is also\r\nchiefly in the grain. It is on this account that the cereals may be\r\nregarded, in a sense, as exhaustive crops, seeing that the grain is\r\nalmost invariably sold off the farm. But, on the other hand, owing to\r\nthe comparatively small demands they make on fertilising ingredients,\r\ncereals will continue to grow on poor land for a longer period than most\r\ncrops,--a fact of very great importance for mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Especially benefited by Nitrogenous Manures._\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that cereals remove comparatively little nitrogen from\r\nthe soil, it is somewhat striking to find that they are chiefly\r\nbenefited by the application of nitrogenous manures. This fact may be\r\nexplained by the shortness of the period of their growth, and the fact\r\nthat they assimilate their nitrogen in spring and early summer, and are\r\nthus unable to utilise to the full the nitrates which accumulate in the\r\nsoil during later summer and autumn. As they seem to absorb their\r\nnitrogen almost exclusively in the form of nitrates, they are especially\r\nbenefited by the application of nitrate of soda.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Power of absorbing Silicates._\r\n\r\nA characteristic feature in the composition of cereals is the large\r\namount of silica they contain. In common with the grasses, they seem to\r\npossess a power, not possessed by other crops, of feeding upon\r\nsilicates.\r\n\r\nThe special manure, therefore, required for cereals is a nitrogenous\r\nmanure, and that, as a rule, of a speedily available character, such as\r\nnitrate of soda or sulphate of ammonia. Furthermore, certain members of\r\nthe group are also specially benefited by phosphatic manures.\r\n\r\nWe shall now consider individually a few of the more important cereal\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARLEY.\r\n\r\nOf cereal crops barley deserves to be considered first, owing to the\r\nfact that it is, of all grain crops, the most widely distributed. In\r\nEngland, in amount, it comes next to wheat among cereals. Its habits\r\nhave also been studied in a very elaborate and careful manner, and have\r\nbeen made the subject of many experiments, both in this country and\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Period of Growth._\r\n\r\nThe first point to notice about barley is the fact that its period of\r\ngrowth is a short one. This has a most important bearing on its\r\ntreatment with manure. It may be said to ripen, on an average, in\r\nthirteen or fourteen weeks in this country; although in Norway and\r\nSweden its period of growth is much less--viz., from six to seven weeks.\r\nIndeed no fewer than three crops have been obtained in one year in\r\ncertain districts in these countries, and two crops are common. With\r\nregard to the period of its growth, it differs from wheat, which in its\r\ngeneral manurial requirements it resembles. Wheat, which is largely sown\r\nin autumn, has four or five months' start of barley. From the fact that\r\nit is a short-lived crop, and that its roots are shallower than wheat,\r\nand draw their nourishment chiefly from the surface-soil, it benefits to\r\na greater extent from liberal manuring than wheat, which is more\r\nindependent of artificial supplies of fertilisers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Most suitable Soil._\r\n\r\nAgain, while wheat does well on a heavy soil, and does not require a\r\nfine surface-tilth, barley does best on a light, rich, friable soil. It\r\nhas, however, been very successfully grown on a heavy soil after wheat.\r\nBarley benefits more than wheat does from the application of\r\nsuperphosphate of lime, or some other readily available phosphatic\r\nmanure. This may be accounted for by its shorter period of growth and\r\nshallower root system, which thus prevent it drawing much mineral\r\nsustenance from the subsoil. In fact, spring-sown crops, as a rule,\r\nbenefit more from superphosphate than autumn-sown crops. The exhaustion\r\nof a soil under barley is essentially, as in the case of wheat, one of\r\nnitrogen, as Sir J. Henry Gilbert has pointed out.[244]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Farmyard Manure not suitable._\r\n\r\nIt has been urged, with some show of reason, that farmyard manure is not\r\nsuitable for barley, as its action is too slow to have much influence on\r\nso short-lived a plant, and that only quick-acting manures should be\r\nused. Where farmyard manure is applied, it should be to the preceding\r\ncrop; and this is advisable for more reasons than one.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Importance of uniform Manuring of Barley._\r\n\r\nThe use to which barley is put--viz., for malting purposes--renders the\r\nuniformity of its composition a point of great importance. Since its\r\nquality is very largely influenced by its treatment with manures,\r\nspecial care has to be exercised in their application. Grown as it\r\ngenerally is after roots, fed off with sheep, its quality, it is\r\nalleged, is apt to suffer from the unequal distribution of the manure\r\napplied in this way. It has consequently been recommended, in order to\r\navoid this inequality, rather to grow a wheat crop immediately preceding\r\nthe barley.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Norfolk Experiments on Barley._\r\n\r\nMr Cooke, in summing up the results of the interesting Norfolk\r\nexperiments on barley, points out that in these experiments barley\r\nalways was benefited by nitrogenous manures, sometimes by superphosphate\r\nof lime, and more rarely by potash; that of nitrogenous manures those\r\nof quickest action exerted the best influence. On an average it was\r\nfound that 1 cwt. nitrate of soda per acre gave an increase of 8 bushels\r\nof barley, and 2 cwt. gave 14 bushels; while 3/4 cwt. sulphate of\r\nammonia (_i.e._, the amount containing the same quantity of nitrogen as\r\n1 cwt. nitrate of soda) gave only 5-1/2 bushels of an increase, and\r\n1-1/2 cwt. (= 2 cwt. nitrate of soda) gave 10 bushels.\r\n\r\nMr Cooke recommends the following manures for the barley crop. From 1/4\r\nto 1 cwt. of nitrate of soda, according to previous treatment of soil;\r\nfrom 1 to 2 cwt. super; and where it is required, from 1/2 to 1 cwt.\r\nmuriate of potash.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Proportion of Grain to Straw._\r\n\r\nProfessor Hellriegel, the distinguished German investigator, has carried\r\nout most elaborate experiments on a small scale, with a view to\r\ninvestigating the habits of the barley plant. In the most perfectly\r\ndeveloped of these plants, grown under the most favourable conditions,\r\nhe found that the grain and straw were about equal in weight. Such a\r\nproportion of grain is, however, never realised in practice, the\r\nproportion of 2 of grain to 3 of straw being probably the common one.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEAT.\r\n\r\nWheat occupies the first position amongst cereals, in respect of extent\r\nof cultivation, in England. As a rule it is sown in autumn, although it\r\nis also sown in spring. It is generally taken after rotation grasses or\r\na leguminous crop, such as peas or beans, or after potatoes or roots.\r\n\r\nUnlike barley, it does best on a clay soil, or at any rate on a firm\r\nsoil, and requires a moist seed-bed. From the fact that wheat is often\r\nsown after such a crop as potatoes or a root crop to which a liberal\r\napplication of manure has been given, it is not so necessary to manure\r\nit except with a top-dressing of nitrate of soda. In short, it is\r\nusually considered highly desirable to get land into \"good heart\" before\r\nwheat, so that the wheat may obtain its nourishment from the residue of\r\nthe previous crop and the farmyard manure previously applied.\r\n\r\nAlthough, therefore, as a rule, the only manure it will be found\r\nnecessary to add to wheat is a nitrogenous manure, such as nitrate of\r\nsoda or sulphate of ammonia, still there are circumstances in which it\r\nwill be well to supplement these by phosphatic or even potassic manures.\r\nOn a light soil it may be advisable to add superphosphate of lime,\r\nguano, or bone-meal, in quantities of 2 to 3 cwt. per acre, in addition\r\nto a nitrogenous manure.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rothamsted Experiments on Wheat._\r\n\r\nOf experiments carried out on the growth of wheat, those which have now\r\nbeen in progress for over half a century at Rothamsted are the most\r\nvaluable and famous. In these experiments the comparative value of\r\nnitrogen and mineral manures on this crop was strikingly exemplified.\r\nThe former gave a most marked increase in the crop, while with the\r\nlatter little or no increase was obtained. A combination of nitrogenous\r\nand mineral manures, on the other hand, gave the most striking results.\r\nAn explanation of these results may be afforded by the fact that in\r\nordinary farming an excess of mineral matter, as compared with nitrates,\r\nis returned to the soil in the crop residues and in the straw of the\r\nfarmyard manure.\r\n\r\nOf nitrogenous manures, nitrate of soda, on the whole, showed better\r\nresults than sulphate of ammonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Continuous Growth of Wheat._\r\n\r\nThe possibility of growing fair crops of wheat year after year for fifty\r\nyears on the same land, and that without any manure whatever, is among\r\nthe most striking of the results of these famous Rothamsted wheat\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Flitcham Experiments._\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we may refer to Mr Cooke's Flitcham experiments. These\r\nwere carried out for the purpose of ascertaining the most suitable\r\nmanure for the wheat crop under different conditions.\r\n\r\nIt will be sufficient here to give the recommendations made by Mr Cooke\r\nas the practical outcome of these experiments.\r\n\r\nHe recommends the application of 10 tons of farmyard manure on light or\r\nmixed soils, after rotation seeds, ploughed in in the autumn, with from\r\n1/4 to 1 cwt. of nitrate of soda, sown in the spring. In certain cases\r\nfarmyard manure will be sufficient without the nitrate of soda. When\r\nfarmyard manure is not available, the most effective and economical\r\nsubstitute is 4 cwt. per acre of rape-cake, ploughed in in the autumn,\r\nor 1 cwt. of sulphate of ammonia, sown in the spring, with, in either\r\ncase, 1 cwt. of nitrate of soda as a spring top-dressing. In addition to\r\nthe above, on land in doubtful agricultural condition, or exceptionally\r\ndeficient in one or other of these ingredients, Mr Cooke recommends the\r\naddition of 2 cwt. superphosphate, or 1 cwt. muriate of potash, or both\r\nof these manures, ploughed or harrowed in in autumn.\r\n\r\n\r\nOATS.\r\n\r\nLike barley, oats are generally sown in spring, and, like barley, may be\r\ndescribed as a shallow-rooted crop. They require, therefore, manures\r\nwhich are readily available, and their demands on the different\r\nfertilising ingredients are very similar to barley. The manures which\r\nwill pay best, consequently, for oats, are nitrate of soda, used as a\r\ntop-dressing, and superphosphate of lime, applied along with the seed.\r\nProbably upon no other crop is nitrate of soda so safe and so effective\r\nas upon oats. In some respects, however, oats differ strikingly from\r\nbarley.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A very hardy Crop._\r\n\r\nIn the first place, oats are a much hardier crop than barley or wheat.\r\nThey can grow on a wonderfully wide range of soil, and under\r\ncomparatively adverse circumstances, both of climate and situation. They\r\nare better suited for a damp climate such as our own than a warm\r\nclimate. They may be described as of all crops the least fastidious, and\r\nwill flourish on sandy, peaty, or clayey soils. While this is so, they\r\nshow a preference for soils rich in decayed vegetable matter. It is for\r\nthis reason that they flourish so well on soils freshly broken up from\r\npasture, and are often the first crop to be grown on such soils.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Require mixed Nitrogenous Manuring._\r\n\r\nStoeckhardt has found, in experiments on the manuring of the oat crop,\r\nthat they greedily absorb nitrogen during nearly the whole period of\r\ntheir growth, and that, consequently, it is desirable to manure them\r\nwith a mixed nitrogenous manure which shall contain nitrogen, both in a\r\nreadily available form to supply the plant during the early stages of\r\nits growth, and in a less available form for the later stages of\r\ngrowth. He was of the opinion that in this way a continuous and\r\nsatisfactory growth of the crop would be promoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Arendt's Experiments._\r\n\r\nThe oat-plant has been made the subject of many elaborate\r\ninvestigations. Of these, those carried out by Arendt are the most\r\nelaborate and best known. In these experiments the composition of the\r\noat-plant at different stages of growth was investigated. It was found\r\nthat the oat-plant increased during the whole period of its life, and\r\nthat two-thirds of the nitrogen absorbed was absorbed during the later\r\nperiod of growth. It has since been shown, however, that the absorption\r\nof nitrogen is very much influenced by circumstances. Indeed its\r\ncomposition is peculiarly susceptible to the influence of manures, and\r\nespecially the influence of weather. Thus Arendt found that the\r\nassimilation of nitrogen is checked by cold wet weather; while, on the\r\nother hand, it is promoted by warm dry weather. The grain of oats grown\r\nin warm seasons is better developed, and in composition more nutritious\r\n(_i.e._, contains more nitrogen), than that of oats grown in wet\r\nseasons, while the reverse is the case with the straw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Avenine._\"\r\n\r\nA point of considerable interest in connection with the composition of\r\noats is the fact that it contains a body which exerts a strikingly\r\nstimulating effect on the nervous system of the animal, and to which the\r\nname \"avenine\" has been given.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quantities of Manures._\r\n\r\nThe quantities of manures which may be applied to the oat crop are\r\nsimilar in amount to those which ought to be applied to barley--from 1/2\r\nto 1 cwt. of nitrate of soda, and from 2 to 3 cwt. superphosphate of\r\nlime. Very often, however, the oat crop receives directly little or no\r\nmanure. In the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland's\r\nexperiments, sulphate of ammonia was found to be of very much less value\r\nthan nitrate of soda as a manure for oats. Potash manures, especially\r\nmuriate of potash, had a very beneficial effect. The general conclusions\r\ndrawn from these experiments were, that the treatment of the land should\r\nbe such as to accumulate organic matter in it, to prevent too great a\r\nloss of moisture, and to provide the young plant with manures that come\r\nspeedily into operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRASS.\r\n\r\nThe manuring of grass is a question of very great interest and\r\nimportance, but is, at the same time, beset with peculiar difficulties.\r\nGrass is grown under two conditions--first, that grown on soils\r\nexclusively set apart for its continuous growth (permanent pasture);\r\nand secondly, that grown for the purpose of being converted into hay and\r\nof providing pasture in the ordinary rotation of crops (rotation seeds).\r\nThe manuring of the former is somewhat different from the manuring of\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Effect of Manure on Herbage of Pastures._\r\n\r\nThe nature of the herbage growing on pasture is very much influenced by\r\nthe manure applied. This, indeed, is one of the most noteworthy features\r\nconnected with the manuring of grass, and has been especially observed\r\nin the Rothamsted experiments, where the influence of the different\r\nmanures on the various kinds of herbage has been investigated with great\r\ncare. The herbage constituting pasture is, as every farmer knows, of a\r\nvaried description. We have in pastures a mixture of plants belonging\r\nboth to the gramineous and leguminous classes, as well as a variety of\r\nweeds. Now the result of the application of different manures tends\r\nrespectively to foster the different kinds of grasses. Thus when one\r\nkind of manure is applied, grasses of one kind tend to predominate and\r\ncrowd out grasses of another. It has been found that _the more highly\r\npasture-land is manured the simpler is the nature of its herbage_ (that\r\nis, the fewer are the different kinds of herbage growing on it).\r\n_Unmanured pasture, on the other hand, is more complex in its herbage._\r\nThe result is, that the application of manure to pasture-land is\r\nattended with certain dangers. To maintain good pasture it is desirable\r\nto effect a proper balance between the different kinds of grasses. For\r\nthis reason permanent pasture may be said to be, of all crops, the least\r\ncommonly manured. As a rule it is only manured by the droppings of the\r\ncattle and sheep feeding upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Influence of Farmyard Manure._\r\n\r\nIt is found that the influence of farmyard manure upon the composition\r\nof the pasture does not tend, to the same extent, to the undue\r\ndevelopment of one type of herbage over another; and in this respect it\r\nis probably to be preferred to artificial manures.\r\n\r\nThe same reasons, however, do not hold with regard to rotation seeds,\r\nwhere an abundant growth is desired, and complexity of herbage is not so\r\nimportant. A further reason which exists for the manuring of meadow-land\r\nis the greater impoverishment of the soil taking place under such\r\nconditions. As illustrating the influence of different manures on\r\ndifferent kinds of herbage, it may be mentioned that in New England\r\nwood-ashes, a manure commonly used there, have been observed, when\r\napplied to pasture, to bring in white clover, and that the application\r\nof gypsum had the same effect. An explanation of this fact may be found\r\nin the influence of potash on leguminous crops. The chief value of\r\nwood-ashes as a manure is due to the large percentage of potash they\r\ncontain, while the value of gypsum is probably to be accounted for by\r\nthe fact that it has an indirect action, and sets free potash from its\r\ninert compounds in the soil. In the Rothamsted experiments this point\r\nhas been verified, and potash has been shown to increase the proportion\r\nof leguminous plants on a grass-field. Nitrogenous manures, on the other\r\nhand, more especially sulphate of ammonia, have been found to increase\r\nthe proportion of grasses proper, and to diminish the proportion of\r\nleguminous plants. The effect of farmyard manure, while less marked in\r\ninducing simplicity of herbage, has a similar effect to sulphate of\r\nammonia; while phosphates and other mineral manures exercise an\r\ninfluence similar to that of potash. Mixtures of mineral and nitrogenous\r\nmanures gave the largest returns obtained, but their influence was to\r\nincrease the proportion of grasses proper. Sewage irrigation also tends\r\nchiefly to develop grasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Influence of Soil and Season on Pastures._\r\n\r\nManures are not the only factors influencing the quality of pastures.\r\nThe nature of the soil, as well as the age of the pasture and the\r\ncharacter of the season, exert a very considerable influence. Grass\r\ngrowing on damp or badly drained soil is invariably of poor quality, the\r\ncoarser grasses predominating. Old pastures, again, are generally of\r\nbetter quality than new ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANURING OF MEADOW-LAND.\r\n\r\nNitrate of soda is a common manure for grass grown for hay. It is often\r\napplied at the rate of 2 or 3 cwt. per acre. It is best, however, to\r\napply it in smaller doses. On soils where lime is abundant,\r\nsuperphosphate may be applied, if necessary, at the rate of 2 or 3 cwt.\r\nper acre, or bones at a similar rate. Basic slag has been found to meet\r\nwith good results as a manure for grass-land, especially where the soil\r\nis rich in organic matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bangor Experiments._\r\n\r\nMr Gilchrist of University College, Bangor, as a result of numerous\r\nexperiments carried out in different parts of Wales, recommends for\r\nrye-grass and clover hay on land in good condition 1 cwt. of nitrate of\r\nsoda or sulphate of ammonia per acre, the former being applied about the\r\nmiddle of April, the latter during March. For land in poor condition,\r\nthe addition of 2 cwt. of superphosphate is recommended--this to be\r\napplied some time between December and March. Farmyard manure may be\r\nusefully applied to young grass and clover seeds in the autumn, more\r\nespecially on light soils. For meadow-land which is growing hay every\r\nyear, Mr Gilchrist further recommends the following 4-course rotation of\r\nmanuring:--\r\n\r\nFirst year, 15 tons farmyard manure, applied in the autumn.\r\n\r\nSecond year, 1 cwt. nitrate of soda.\r\n\r\nThird year, 4 cwt. basic slag or 3 cwt. superphosphate and 1 cwt.\r\nnitrate of soda.\r\n\r\nFourth year, 1 cwt. nitrate of soda.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Norfolk Experiments._\r\n\r\nMr Cooke, from his Norfolk experiments, recommends the following manures\r\nfor rotation seeds:--\r\n\r\nOne to 1-1/2 cwt. nitrate of soda as a top-dressing in early spring.\r\nWhere the clover plant is a good one, and it is particularly desired to\r\ncultivate it, he recommends as a dressing 1 cwt. of muriate of potash\r\nper acre, to be applied immediately after the clover is sown. The\r\npractice of dressing growing seeds in their first winter has, so far as\r\nthe experiments in Norfolk go, less to recommend it than the earlier\r\ndressing.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANURING OF PERMANENT PASTURES.\r\n\r\nIn this case the manure should be applied so as not to impair the\r\nquality of the herbage. Slow-acting manures are consequently best, such\r\nas basic slag or bones, which have been found to be of special value. On\r\nwet or marshy land after draining, lime is perhaps one of the best\r\nmanures to apply in the first instance. As we have already said,\r\nfarmyard manure will do more to maintain the quality of pasture than any\r\nkind of artificial manure. Mr Cooke is of opinion that no system of\r\nmanuring yet discovered will both thicken and improve the herbage at\r\nall equally in success to the careful and regular feeding upon the grass\r\nof cattle or sheep, the animals having a good allowance of decorticated\r\ncotton-cake, or even of linseed-cake.\r\n\r\n\r\nROOTS.\r\n\r\nOf all crops roots may be said to require the most liberal application\r\nof manure, and to respond most freely to it. They contain large\r\nquantities of the fertilising ingredients--nitrogen, phosphates, and\r\npotash--and may be regarded as exceedingly exhaustive crops. This is\r\nespecially the case with regard to mangels, which make particularly\r\nlarge demands on a soil's fertilising ingredients.\r\n\r\nTurnips are characterised by the large amount of sulphur they contain;\r\nand, according to some, this explains the beneficial effect which gypsum\r\nhas when applied to them as a manure. This, however, is more probably to\r\nbe explained by the indirect action of gypsum in setting free the potash\r\nof the soil. The fact that the successful cultivation of root crops\r\ndepends on the application of large quantities of manure, is recognised\r\nin practice, as they receive the most manure of any crop of the\r\nrotation. Roots flourish best on a light soil which is neither too wet\r\nnor too dry; but with liberal manuring and careful tillage, they may be\r\nsaid to do well on any soil. Mangels are generally more benefited by\r\nthe application of nitrogenous manures than are turnips or swedes,\r\nwhich, it would seem, have a greater power of absorbing nitrogen from\r\nthe soil than the first-named crop; but it is a mistake to suppose that\r\nany of the root crops are not dependent on a ready supply of nitrogen;\r\nand the fact that large crops of turnips can often be grown by the\r\napplication of superphosphate alone, may be taken as a proof that the\r\nsoil contains plenty of nitrogen. Mangels are, from their deeper roots,\r\nmore capable of drawing their supply of phosphoric acid from the soil\r\nthan turnips. They respond, therefore, as a rule, less freely than\r\nturnips or swedes to an application of superphosphate. Generally\r\nspeaking, we may say that the characteristic manure for turnips is\r\nsuperphosphate, and that for mangels is a nitrogenous manure such as\r\nnitrate of soda or sulphate of ammonia.\r\n\r\nA special reason for manuring root crops is the fact that they are more\r\nliable to disease than other crops; and this is especially the case in\r\nthe early stages of their growth. One of the great benefits conferred on\r\nthe turnip crop by an application of superphosphate, is the help it\r\ngives the crop to pass safely the critical period of its growth. The\r\nsuperphosphate is best drilled in with the seed, in quantities varying\r\nfrom 3 to 5 cwt. In Scotland, it may be well to point out, the manure\r\napplied to this crop is very much in excess of the amount customarily\r\napplied in England; for in the former country larger applications of\r\nmanure may be profitably employed. Roots generally receive a large\r\ndressing of farmyard manure. Salt has been found in some districts to\r\nhave a very good effect on the mangel crop, and potash is often found to\r\namply repay application.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Influence of Manure on Composition._\r\n\r\nA most interesting point in connection with the manuring of roots is the\r\neffect of manure on their composition. This has been most elaborately\r\ninvestigated at Rothamsted and elsewhere. Thus it has been found that\r\nthe effect of the application of excessive quantities of nitrogenous\r\nmanures is to produce too great a development of leaves at the expense\r\nof the roots.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nitrogenous Manures increase Sugar in Roots._\r\n\r\nNitrogenous manures also tend to increase the proportion of sugar and\r\ndiminish the proportion of nitrogenous matter in roots. This has an\r\nimportant bearing on the treatment of roots which are cultivated for\r\ntheir sugar, such as beets, in the growth of which nitrate of soda is\r\nthe chief artificial manure applied.[245]\r\n\r\nThe leaf, it may be pointed out, contains a larger percentage of dry\r\nmatter, both in swedes and in turnips, than the root.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amount of Nitrogen recovered in Increase of Crop._\r\n\r\nWith regard to the amount of nitrogen recovered in the increased crop of\r\nmangel and roots when manured with different nitrogenous manures, it was\r\nfound at Rothamsted, as an average of six years, that the following\r\npercentages of nitrogen were recovered: When nitrate of soda was\r\napplied, 60 per cent of the nitrogen it contained was recovered in the\r\nincreased crop; when ammonia salts were applied, 52 per cent; when\r\nrape-cake was used, 50 per cent; and when a mixture of rape-cake and\r\nammonia salts was used, 46 per cent.\r\n\r\nIt may be pointed out that the influence of season and climate on the\r\ncomposition of root crops is very great--greater, indeed, than on any\r\nother crop. Like oats, turnips grow better in Scotland than in England,\r\nthe moister climate of the former country being more suitable for their\r\nmaximum development, and hence the economy of maximum dressings in\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Norfolk Experiments._\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, a few words may be said on the Norfolk experiments,\r\ncarried out under the direction of Mr Cooke for the purpose of\r\nascertaining the best and most economical manure for mangels and swedes\r\non different Norfolk soils. In most of these experiments it was found\r\nthat superphosphate had not much effect in producing increase of crop in\r\nthe case of mangels; that the best nitrogenous manure was nitrate of\r\nsoda; and that on the whole it was not economical to apply farmyard\r\nmanure at the rate of more than 10 tons per acre. It was further found\r\nthat, although either potash or common salt gave a decided increase in\r\nweight of roots, it was not necessary to give both these manures at\r\nonce, either of them being about as effective as the other.\r\n\r\nMr Cooke recommends the following manures as best suited for\r\nmangels--viz., 2 cwt. nitrate, 3 cwt. common salt, and 2 cwt.\r\nsuperphosphate. Upon certain soils peculiarly adapted to mangels, and in\r\nwarm localities where larger crops than 25 to 30 tons per acre are\r\nhabitually grown, it would probably pay to increase or to double the\r\nabove quantity of nitrate of soda. Ten tons of farmyard manure may, if\r\npreferred, be substituted for all or a part of the nitrate of soda, or\r\nmay even be used in addition to it, according to the resources of the\r\nfarmer in respect of it, and the return he desires to get from the dung\r\nin the first year of application or in future ones. It is best to apply\r\nthe nitrate of soda in two instalments--half at the time of seeding, and\r\nhalf as a top-dressing immediately after the first hand-hoeing of the\r\nroots. A third dressing may often be given with advantage a month later.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Manure for Swedes._\r\n\r\nAs a complete and economical dressing for swedes in Norfolk, Mr Cooke\r\nrecommends 3 to 4 cwt. superphosphate, 1 cwt. sulphate of ammonia, and\r\n1/2 cwt. of muriate of potash. Occasionally it may be found advisable to\r\nreduce the quantity of sulphate of ammonia, or to leave it out\r\naltogether; and in other cases the potash may be judiciously omitted.\r\nThe entire mixture should be sown at the time of drilling the turnips.\r\nIf farmyard manure is used--and if used it should be applied in a\r\nwell-decomposed state--no other manure than 3 cwt. of superphosphate\r\nwill be required.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Highland Society's Experiments._\r\n\r\nValuable experiments have been carried out on the subject of manuring of\r\nturnips by Dr A. P. Aitken, for the Highland and Agricultural Society of\r\nScotland. The following are some of the results to be gathered from\r\nthese experiments. The effect of a dissolved phosphate as compared with\r\na ground phosphate is to produce a turnip of less feeding value.\r\nSuperphosphate had a better effect when applied in April than when\r\napplied with the seed in June. It was further found that when the\r\nnitrogenous manure was given entirely in the form of nitrate of soda or\r\nsulphate of ammonia, the latter produced a denser and sounder turnip.\r\nLastly, with regard to the application of potash, it was found that the\r\nbest way was to apply it several months before sowing. The effect of\r\npotash manures is to increase the amount of turnips, but to retard the\r\nripening of the bulbs. The effect of excessive potash manuring is to\r\ngreatly injure the crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Manuring for rich Crops of Turnips._\r\n\r\nIn Dr Aitken's own words: \"In order to grow a large and at the same time\r\na healthy and nutritious crop of turnips, such a system of manuring or\r\ntreatment of the soil, by feeding or otherwise, should be practised as\r\nwill result in the general enriching and raising of the condition of the\r\nland, so that the crop may grow naturally and gradually to maturity. For\r\nthat purpose a larger application of slowly acting manures, of which\r\nbone-meal may be taken as the type, is much better suited than smaller\r\napplications of the more quickly acting kind. A certain amount of\r\nquickly acting manure is very beneficial to the crop, especially in its\r\nyouth; but the great bulk of the nourishment which the crop requires\r\nshould be of the slowly rotting or dissolving kind, as uniformly\r\ndistributed through the soil as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Experiments by the Author._\r\n\r\nExperiments by the author on turnip-manuring, carried out in different\r\nparts of the South and West of Scotland, showed that while farmyard\r\nmanure is valuable in giving the crop a good start and bringing it well\r\nforward during the period of germination and early growth, by supplying\r\na certain amount of easily assimilable plant-food, and in the case of\r\ndry weather attracting a quantity of moisture, its application in\r\nquantities of 20 or even 10 tons per acre can scarcely be regarded as\r\nprofitable, giving to farmyard manure a nominal value of a few shillings\r\na ton. In these experiments slag proved itself a most valuable manure,\r\nindeed one of the most economical of all the manures experimented with.\r\nThey further showed that heavy dressings with superphosphate, amounting\r\nto as much as 8 cwt. per acre, are, from an economical point of view, as\r\na rule justifiable in Scotland; and that nitrate of soda and sulphate of\r\nammonia possess practically equal value as a manure for turnips. In\r\nalmost every one of the experiments the benefit of supplementing\r\nsuperphosphate with nitrogenous manure was shown. Potash was also found\r\nin many cases to be a thoroughly paying manure for the turnip crop, when\r\nit was applied along with nitrogen and phosphates; but when applied\r\nalone, far from exercising any appreciable benefit, it seemed to exert\r\nan injurious action.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTATOES.\r\n\r\nPotatoes are often classed along with the root crops, and in their\r\nmanurial requirements they offer many points of similarity. Next to root\r\ncrops, they may be said to make the most exhaustive demands on the soil,\r\nand therefore require a liberal general manuring. A point of importance\r\nin the manuring of potatoes is a good tilth in the soil, so as to enable\r\na free expansion of the tubers to take place. They may be said to grow\r\nbest on deep warm soils; but, like roots, if liberally manured, they may\r\nbe successfully grown on any kind of soil. Farmyard manure has long been\r\nregarded as specially valuable for the potato crop. In many parts of\r\nScotland it is applied in enormous quantities, ranging from 20 to even\r\n40 tons per acre. There can be little doubt that the value of farmyard\r\nmanure, as well as other bulky manures, for the potato crop, is partly\r\ndue to their mechanical influence on the soil. Potatoes are\r\nsurface-feeders, and require their food in a readily available\r\ncondition. It is found desirable, therefore, to supplement farmyard\r\nmanure by readily available artificial manures. Potatoes repay the\r\napplication of a mixed manure containing all the fertilising\r\ningredients--nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash--better than most\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Highland Society's Experiments on Potatoes._\r\n\r\nThe nitrogen is, according to the Highland Society's experiments, best\r\napplied in the form of nitrate of soda. Sulphate of ammonia does not\r\nseem, when farmyard manure is also applied, to have an equally valuable\r\neffect, as it influences the size of the tuber, producing an undue\r\nproportion of small potatoes. When no farmyard manure is applied,\r\nhowever, sulphate of ammonia seems to have a good effect, especially in\r\nwet seasons.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the nature of the phosphatic manure to be applied,\r\nsuperphosphate is to be preferred. Potatoes make large demands on\r\npotash, and consequently require potassic manures. In consequence of the\r\nfact that they receive large applications of farmyard manure, the\r\nnecessity for adding potash in the form of artificial manures does not\r\ngenerally exist. Potash, if applied in too large quantities, has been\r\nfound to exert a deleterious effect. We have already pointed out that\r\nmuriate of potash tends to produce a waxy potato.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Rothamsted Experiments with Potatoes._\r\n\r\nThe Rothamsted experimenters have very fully investigated the conditions\r\nof the manurial requirements of potatoes. In these experiments potatoes\r\nwere grown year after year in the same field. It was found that the\r\neffect of mineral manures alone was greater than the effect of\r\nnitrogenous manures alone, and that of mineral manures phosphates, as a\r\nrule, had a better effect than potash; that under the action of the\r\ngrowth of potatoes a greater exhaustion of phosphates than of potash\r\ntakes place in the soil; and lastly, that it is essential to have an\r\nabundant supply of the different fertilising ingredients in order to\r\ngrow successful crops. In the Rothamsted experiments, the slow action of\r\nfarmyard manure in supplying fertilising ingredients to the potatoes is\r\nstrikingly demonstrated. Thus, although farmyard manure was applied at\r\nsuch a rate that more than 200 lb. of nitrogen were added to the soil,\r\nthe result was inferior to that obtained from the application of 86 lb.\r\nof nitrogen applied in the form of readily available artificial manure.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Effect of Farmyard Manure on Potatoes._\r\n\r\nIt may be said, in this respect, that the potato is less able to utilise\r\nthe fertilising ingredients of farmyard manure than any other of the\r\nfarm crops. Yet, despite this fact, farmyard manure has been found to be\r\none of the best manures to apply. The reconciliation of these seemingly\r\ncontradictory statements depends on the influence exerted by the\r\nfarmyard manure on the mechanical condition of the soil, rendering it\r\nmore porous and easily permeable to the surface-roots, upon the\r\ndevelopment of which the success of the crop so much depends. The\r\nbeneficial effect of farmyard manure is also doubtless due to the\r\nincreased temperature which large applications of it produce in a soil.\r\n\r\nSir J. Henry Gilbert, in his well-known Cirencester Lecture on the\r\nGrowth of Potatoes, cites several examples of the manurial treatment of\r\npotatoes in different parts of the country. In Forfarshire, farmyard\r\nmanure or stable manure is largely employed (at the rate of 12 to 14\r\ntons, and in some cases even 20 tons per acre), and it is also largely\r\nsupplemented by artificial manures. These latter are applied to the\r\nextent of about 10 cwt., and consist of superphosphate, dissolved bones,\r\nand potash salts. Six tons of potatoes are considered a fair crop. In\r\nEast Lothian the manuring is similar, with the exception that farmyard\r\nmanure is applied in even larger quantities--30 to 40 tons being often\r\nused. Sometimes potatoes are grown with artificial manures alone. It\r\nwould seem that the usual crop of potatoes ranges from 4 to 8 tons per\r\nacre.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Manuring of Potatoes in Jersey._\r\n\r\nThe manuring of the potato crop, so largely grown in Jersey in the\r\nChannel Islands, is of interest. Potatoes are there grown two or three\r\nyears, then corn, then grass for a few years, then potatoes again, no\r\nspecial rotation of crops being followed. Either farmyard manure or\r\nsea-weed is applied at the rate of 25 to 30 tons per acre, supplemented\r\nby 8 to 12 cwt. of artificial manures.\r\n\r\nThese statements show how prevalent the practice of heavily manuring the\r\npotato crop is.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Influence of Manure on the Composition of the Potato._\r\n\r\nThe influence of manure on the composition of the potato crop is of much\r\ninterest. Potatoes grown without manure, just as in the case of roots,\r\nare found to have a larger percentage of nitrogen than potatoes grown\r\nwith manure. The effect of manuring, therefore, is to increase the\r\nproportion of starch, which is the most important constituent of the\r\npotato. Mineral manures have a greater effect in increasing the\r\npercentage of starch than purely nitrogenous manures; but when used\r\ntogether, a still greater increase is obtained than when used singly.\r\nThe effect of nitrogenous manures on the composition of roots and\r\npotatoes is thus seen to be similar. In the case of both crops the\r\neffect is to increase the proportion of the characteristic carbohydrate\r\nconstituent, which in roots is sugar, and in potatoes starch. Potatoes,\r\nlike roots, are also much influenced by the season. The effect of season\r\nand manuring on the potato disease is worthy of notice. Wet seasons are\r\nfavourable to the development of the disease. It has been found that in\r\na highly nitrogenous manured crop the proportion of diseased tubers is\r\ngreater than in a non-manured crop.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGUMINOUS CROPS.\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to the manuring of crops of the leguminous\r\nclass in discussing the manuring of meadows and permanent pasture. It\r\nwas there pointed out that the tendency of certain manures was to\r\nencourage the growth of the leguminous plants of the herbage, while\r\nother manures had the effect of encouraging those of the gramineous\r\nclass. It was pointed out that a manure which had this effect was\r\npotash, or any manure which owed its characteristic action to the fact\r\nthat it supplied potash to the soil or set it free in the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Leguminous Plants benefit by Potash._\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most important points to notice in manuring\r\nleguminous plants. Just as we can say that nitrogenous manures are\r\nspecially beneficial to cereals, and phosphatic manures to roots, so\r\npotash is the special manure for leguminous crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nitrogenous Manures may actually be hurtful._\r\n\r\nBut we have, further, an even more striking characteristic of leguminous\r\ncrops to notice. We have seen that, with regard to the crops already\r\ndiscussed, while there are cases in which a fertilising ingredient may\r\nbe of no value, or may positively exert a hurtful action on the crops,\r\nsuch cases are only exceptional. With regard to leguminous crops,\r\nhowever, we find that almost invariably they derive little or no benefit\r\nfrom the use of artificial nitrogenous manures. And this is all the more\r\nstriking since they contain large quantities of nitrogen in their\r\ncomposition--twice as much as the cereals. The fact, which has long been\r\nnoticed with regard to certain members of this class of plants, such as\r\nclover, that not only do they contain a large amount of nitrogen, but\r\nthat by growing them on a soil the soil is largely enriched in this\r\nvaluable fertilising constituent, has long waited for a satisfactory\r\nexplanation, which at last has been forthcoming. The discovery that\r\nleguminous crops can draw on the boundless store of nitrogen present in\r\nthe air has done much to clear up the mystery. There are, however, other\r\nproblems with regard to the growth of leguminous plants which still\r\nawait solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clover-sickness._\r\n\r\nOne of these is the fact that land on which a leguminous crop like\r\nclover has been growing for a number of years becomes unfit to support\r\nits growth any longer. Such a soil is termed \"clover-sick\"; and many\r\nhave been the theories put forward to explain the phenomenon, but none\r\nof them can be regarded as satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge that leguminous plants have the power of deriving their\r\nnitrogen from the air, furnishes us with an economical means of\r\nenriching our soils in nitrogen. By growing leguminous crops alternately\r\nwith cereals, for example, the air should be made to furnish the\r\nnecessary nitrogenous manure. As a matter of fact, modified forms of\r\nsuch a practice have long been in use--indeed the ordinary rotations of\r\ncrops are, to a certain extent, adaptations of this practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alternate Wheat and Beans Rotation._\r\n\r\nAn interesting experiment carried out at Rothamsted may be here cited\r\nwhich illustrates in a striking manner the truth of the above statement.\r\nWheat and the leguminous crop beans were grown alternately. It was\r\nfound that almost as much wheat (containing nearly as much nitrogen) was\r\nyielded in eight crops of wheat so grown as was yielded by sixteen crops\r\nof wheat grown consecutively in an adjoining field.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly cultivated leguminous crops are clover, beans, and\r\npeas. Clover having been already discussed, we need only say a word or\r\ntwo on the manuring of beans and peas.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEANS.\r\n\r\nBeans do best on strong land, and, unlike some of the crops considered,\r\ndo not require a particularly fine tilth. They are generally grown after\r\ncereals, and as a rule are sown in spring. More rarely, however, they\r\nare sown in autumn. Spring-sown beans take about seven months to come to\r\nmaturity. They are much affected, like other crops, but to a greater\r\nextent, by the nature of the season--a wet season inducing an undue\r\ndevelopment of straw.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Manure for Beans._\r\n\r\nIn common practice the manure used for the bean crop is farmyard manure,\r\napplied to the soil in autumn after the harvest of the wheat, barley, or\r\nother cereal crop grown. So common is this practice, that the belief\r\ncommonly exists that farmyard manure is necessary for a successful bean\r\ncrop. But experiments conducted at the Highland Society's Experiment\r\nStation at Pumpherston show that full crops of beans may be grown with\r\nthe aid of artificial manures on soils which have received no\r\napplication of farmyard manure for ten years.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relative Value of Manurial Ingredients._\r\n\r\nIn the Appendix[246] will be found a table giving the results of\r\nmanurial experiments with the nitrogenous, phosphatic, and potash\r\nmanures on beans, carried out by Dr A. P. Aitken at the Highland\r\nSociety's Experiment Station. From these experiments it will be seen\r\nthat the application of phosphates and nitrogenous manures, either alone\r\nor together, exerted a comparatively small effect in increasing the\r\nyield of beans compared with that obtained with potash, either alone or\r\ncombined with phosphates. As Dr Aitken says, \"Without potash in the\r\nmanure, the other two ingredients are of very little use, unless,\r\nindeed, the land be very rich in potash.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gypsum._\r\n\r\nGypsum has a good effect on the bean crop, both on account of the lime\r\nit contains, and of its indirect action in setting free potash.\r\n\r\nSuperphosphate is a much better manure than insoluble phosphates, and\r\nsimilarly, in the few cases where nitrogenous manures are beneficial,\r\nthe speediest acting are best. Hence nitrate of soda is to be preferred\r\nto other nitrogenous manures. When it is applied, it should be applied\r\nin small quantities. A slow-acting nitrogenous manure is positively\r\ninjurious; so also, according to Dr Aitken, is nitrate of soda, applied\r\nas a top-dressing to the crop.\r\n\r\nOf potash manures, the muriate seems to be more effective than the\r\nsulphate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Effect of Manure on Composition of Crop._\r\n\r\nLastly, we may refer to the effect of manures on the composition of the\r\ncrop. This is, on the whole, very slight, especially when compared with\r\nthe effect manures exert on the composition of such crops as turnips or\r\npotatoes. It is the quantity and not the quality of the crop which the\r\nmanure affects in the case of beans.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEAS.\r\n\r\nPeas are not grown to anything like the same extent as beans. As a rule,\r\nwhen they are cultivated it is along with beans, when they are\r\nnecessarily manured in a similar manner. If grown alone, however, it may\r\nbe well to point out that peas do best, unlike beans, on light, friable,\r\nchalky loam. When grown in clay they tend to develop an undue amount of\r\nstraw. The effect of season on the crop is similar to that exerted on\r\nthe bean crop. In conclusion, it may be pointed out that it is alleged\r\nthat the effect of farmyard manure on peas is to force the straw.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this chapter a word or two may be said on the manuring of\r\ntwo other crops which are cultivated to a considerable extent in this\r\ncountry--viz., hops and cabbages.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOPS.\r\n\r\nThe requirements of the hop crop in the matter of manures are rather\r\nsingular. It has been pointed out that in the case of most crops\r\nquick-acting manures are to be preferred to slow-acting manures. With\r\nhops, however, the case is very different; for they require, and cannot\r\nbe successfully cultivated without, slow-acting manures. Hops are\r\nespecially benefited by bulky nitrogenous manures--such as shoddy,\r\nhorn-meal, hide-scraps, hoofs, rape-dust, &c.; and it is only when\r\nquick-acting manures are applied along with such slow-acting manures\r\nthat they will exercise their full influence. It is best to manure hops\r\ntwice a-year,--in spring with farmyard manure, supplemented by a\r\nslow-acting nitrogenous manure, such as shoddy; and again in summer with\r\na more quickly acting manure. The dressings applied to hops are enormous\r\nrelatively to those used on other farm crops.\r\n\r\n\r\nCABBAGES.\r\n\r\nCabbages belong to that class of crops known as gross feeders, to which\r\nany sort of manure, applied in almost any quantities, does not come\r\namiss. Cabbages grow best on good loams with a well-drained porous\r\nsubsoil, although they also do well on clay soils. The quantity of\r\nfertilising ingredients, especially potash, which a large crop of\r\ncabbage removes from the soil is very great. They consequently require\r\nlarge quantities of manure, and are especially benefited by saline\r\nmanures--such as kainit and common salt--and liberal doses of nitrate of\r\nsoda, which may be regarded as the most effective of manures for all the\r\ncabbage tribe. Farmyard manure may be applied with benefit in larger\r\nquantities than it would be applied to any other crop.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[244] See his Lecture on the Growth of Barley.\r\n\r\n[245] Small roots are found to contain a larger proportion of sugar than\r\nlarge roots.\r\n\r\n[246] See Note I., p. 530.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE I.

This is often, however,\r\nunusually difficult to do, especially in the case of artificial manures,\r\nwhere the quantity to be spread over a large area of the soil is\r\nextremely small. The difficulty in the case of farmyard or other very\r\nbulky manure is not so great. In order to overcome this difficulty in\r\nthe case of artificial manures, it is often advisable to mix them with\r\nsome such substance as sand, ashes, loam, peat, or salt. The manure is\r\nthus diluted in strength, and a very much larger bulk of substance is\r\nobtained to work with. Circumstances must decide which of these\r\nsubstances to use. If the soil be a heavy clay, the addition of sand or\r\nashes may have an important mechanical effect in improving its texture;\r\nwhile, on the other hand, if it be a light soil, the addition of peat\r\nmay improve its mechanical condition. It must also be remembered that\r\npeat itself contains a large amount of nitrogen, and thus forms a manure\r\nof some value. In using loam or peat to mix with artificial manures,\r\nthey should be first dried and then riddled; while if ashes be used,\r\nthey should be previously reduced to a fine state. Wood-ashes, however,\r\nmust be used with caution, and ought not to be mixed with ammoniacal\r\nmanures, as they are apt to contain caustic alkali, which would tend to\r\ndrive off the ammonia in a volatile state.\r\n\r\nIt has been recommended, in order to save trouble and effect equal\r\ndistribution, that the manure to be applied should always be made up to\r\nthe same amount, so that the farmer by experience may ascertain the rate\r\nat which to apply it. And here it may be well to say a word or two on\r\nthe subject of mixing manures--a subject with which the farmer is not\r\nalways so conversant as it is desirable in the interests of his own\r\npocket he should be.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mixing Manures._\r\n\r\nIt is to be feared that not unfrequently indiscriminate mixing may cause\r\nvery serious loss in the most valuable constituent of a manure. It may\r\nbe well, therefore, to point out one or two of the causes of the loss\r\nthat is apt to ensue on the mixing of different kinds of manures\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nAs the subject depends for its clear comprehension on certain chemical\r\nelementary principles, it may be well for the benefit of non-chemical\r\nreaders to state these pretty fully.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Risks of Loss in Mixtures._\r\n\r\nThe risks of loss which may occur from the mixing of artificial manures\r\ntogether may be of different kinds. One is the risk of actual loss of a\r\nvaluable ingredient through volatilisation; another is the risk of the\r\ndeterioration of the value of a mixture through change of the chemical\r\nstate of a valuable ingredient. Undoubtedly the most common and most\r\nserious source of loss is the former. Of the three valuable manurial\r\ningredients--nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash--only the first is\r\nliable to loss by volatilisation, and this generally only when the\r\nnitrogen is either in the form of ammonia or nitric acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Loss of Ammonia._\r\n\r\nAmmonia, when uncombined, is a very volatile gas with a pungent smell, a\r\nproperty which enables its escape from a manure mixture to be very\r\neasily detected. It belongs to a class of substances which are known\r\nchemically as bases, and which have the power of combining with acids\r\nand forming salts. Sulphate of ammonia is a salt formed--as its name\r\nindicates--by the union of the base, ammonia, with the acid, sulphuric\r\nacid. Now when ammonia unites with sulphuric acid and forms sulphate of\r\nammonia, it is no longer volatile and liable to escape as a gas, but\r\nbecomes \"fixed,\" as it is called.\r\n\r\nAlthough most salts are more or less stable bodies--not liable to\r\nchange--if left alone, and not submitted to a high temperature or\r\nchemical action, they can be easily decomposed if they are heated or\r\nbrought into contact with some other substance which will give rise to\r\nchemical action. Sulphate of ammonia is a salt that is very easily\r\ndecomposed. This is due to the fact that its base, ammonia, is very\r\nvolatile, and not capable of being held very firmly by an acid, even by\r\nsulphuric, which is among the least volatile of all the common acids.\r\nIf, therefore, sulphate of ammonia be heated above the boiling-point of\r\nwater, or brought in contact with any other substance which will give\r\nrise to chemical action, it is easily decomposed. Now a salt may be\r\nacted upon by a base or an acid or another salt. When it is brought in\r\ncontact with a base, if the base with which it is brought in contact be\r\na stronger base than the base of the salt, the salt is decomposed, and a\r\nnew salt is formed. The acid, in short, exchanges its old base for the\r\nnew one.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Effect of Lime on Ammonia Salt._\r\n\r\nThis is exactly what takes place when the base lime comes in contact\r\nwith an ammonium salt, such as sulphate of ammonia. The sulphuric acid\r\nexchanges its old base, ammonia, for the stronger base, lime, and\r\nsulphate of lime is formed, and ammonia is set free as a gas, and\r\nescapes and is lost. Sulphate of ammonia, or any substance in which\r\nthere is an ammonia salt, must never be brought in contact with free\r\nlime, otherwise the ammonia will be lost, and should be harrowed in on\r\nchalky soils for this reason.\r\n\r\nIt is different entirely with gypsum--which is sulphate of lime--or\r\nphosphate of lime, both of which may be safely mixed with sulphate of\r\nammonia without any danger of escape of ammonia. It follows from the\r\nabove that a mixture which must on no account be tried is slag phosphate\r\nand sulphate of ammonia. This is because the slag phosphate contains a\r\nlarge percentage of free lime, which would at once, on being brought in\r\ncontact with the sulphate of ammonia, decompose it, and cause the\r\nammonia to be lost. For this same reason guano must not be mixed with\r\nslag. It is perhaps unnecessary, however, to warn one against so doing,\r\nas it is not likely such a mixture would be made, as the ratio of\r\nphosphoric acid to nitrogen in guanos is generally greater than is\r\nrequired. If it be desired to mix the slag with a quickly available form\r\nof nitrogen, nitrate of soda is not liable to loss; although for other\r\nreasons it is not desirable to apply nitrate of soda along with the\r\nslag, as the former manure should be applied almost always as a\r\ntop-dressing.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Loss of Nitric Acid._\r\n\r\nThe risks of the loss of nitrogen in the form of nitric acid, although\r\nnot so great as they are in the case of ammonia, are still considerable.\r\nAs nitric acid is not a base but an acid, what is to be avoided in\r\nmixing nitrates is bringing them in contact with any other manure which\r\ncontains another free and stronger acid--as, for example,\r\nsuperphosphate. The free acid present in superphosphate has the tendency\r\nto drive out the nitric acid from the nitrate and usurp its place. The\r\nrisk of loss of expulsion in the above cases is always augmented by the\r\nrise of temperature which invariably accompanies chemical action of any\r\nkind; and although the loss of nitrogen, in the form of nitric acid,\r\ncaused by mixing superphosphate and nitrate of soda, might, under\r\nordinary circumstances, amount to very little, yet, if the mixture were\r\nto be allowed to stand any time, and the temperature of the mass to be\r\nheightened, the loss which would undoubtedly then ensue would be\r\nconsiderable.\r\n\r\nThe nitrogen salt which it is safe to mix with superphosphate is\r\nsulphate of ammonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reversion of Phosphates._\r\n\r\nBut, as has already been mentioned, there is another loss which may\r\nresult from the mixing of manures. This is the deterioration of the\r\nvalue of an ingredient by reason of change of chemical condition. This\r\nis a source of loss that was little suspected a number of years ago, but\r\nit is now well known that superphosphate of lime, under certain\r\nconditions, is changed from its soluble to an insoluble form. We have\r\nalready referred to the reversion of phosphate in the chapter on the\r\nManufacture of Superphosphates.[247] It was there pointed out that\r\nreversion is often caused by the presence of iron and alumina or\r\nundissolved phosphate, and that the risk of reversion is therefore very\r\nmuch less in a well-made article, made from pure raw material, than in\r\none made from a raw phosphate containing much iron and alumina.\r\nSuperphosphates containing a large percentage of insoluble phosphates\r\nought not to be kept too long before being used as a manure, otherwise\r\nmuch of the labour and expense involved in their manufacture will be\r\nlost by the reversion of their soluble phosphate. Further, it is highly\r\ninadvisable to mix superphosphates with basic slag, which contains a\r\nlarge percentage of both iron and free lime. Lastly, if it is desired to\r\nmix superphosphate with insoluble phosphate, the mixture ought to be\r\nmade just previous to application.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Manurial Ingredients should be applied separately._\r\n\r\nThe question of applying manure in mixtures is one on which considerable\r\ndifference of opinion may exist. For many reasons manures are often\r\nbetter applied in the unmixed condition. For example, a mixture of a\r\nquickly acting nitrogenous manure with a slowly acting phosphatic manure\r\nis not suitable. In such a case either the nitrogenous manure will be\r\napplied too long before it is required by the plant, and thus suffer\r\nfrom risk of loss, or the phosphatic manure will not be applied long\r\nenough before it is likely to be used. By applying manures in an unmixed\r\ncondition the chances are that a more economical use of them is made\r\nthan would otherwise be the case. On the other hand, while the\r\napplication of the separate constituents may be desirable from the\r\nscientific point of view, it involves a considerable amount of extra\r\ntrouble. Of course a further consideration is the desirability in many\r\ncases of having a complete manure. The above hints, therefore, on the\r\nrisks of loss which exist in mixing manures, may be of service to the\r\nagricultural student.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[247] See p. 389.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nON THE VALUATION AND ANALYSIS OF MANURES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Value of Chemical Analysis._\r\n\r\nThe value of a manure to the farmer depends on the proportion of\r\n_nitrogen_, _phosphoric acid_, and _potash_ it contains, as well as--and\r\nthis is hardly less important--the condition in which the ingredients\r\nare present. Since these facts can alone be determined by a chemical\r\nanalysis, it is obvious that manures should always be purchased with a\r\nchemical analysis. It is unfortunate, however, that very often a\r\nchemical analysis, even when procured, is unintelligible. It may be of\r\nadvantage, therefore, to say a word or two on the correct interpretation\r\nof the significance of the data furnished in the ordinary chemical\r\nanalysis of manures.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Interpretation of Chemical Analysis._\r\n\r\nThe first thing that the farmer ought to look for in the analysis of a\r\nmanure is the amount of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash which the\r\nmanure contains.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nitrogen._\r\n\r\nThe percentage of nitrogen in a manure is generally stated as equal to\r\nits equivalent percentage of ammonia. Very often, indeed, in the older\r\nanalyses, its equivalent of ammonia was alone stated. Now this statement\r\ndoes not necessarily imply that the nitrogen in a manure is actually\r\npresent in the form of ammonia. Thus, for example, when it is stated in\r\nan analysis of bone-meal that it contains 3.5 per cent of nitrogen,\r\nequal to 4.20 per cent of ammonia, it is not to be inferred that\r\nbone-meal actually contains nitrogen in the form of ammonia. In point of\r\nfact the nitrogen is present in an insoluble, slowly available, organic\r\nform, which possesses a manurial value very inferior to that possessed\r\nby ammonia. This custom is a most unfortunate one, and is much to be\r\nregretted, as it is often liable to give rise to serious\r\nmisunderstanding. It must be remembered, therefore, that an ordinary\r\nchemical analysis does not always specify the exact form in which\r\nnitrogen is actually present. It is nevertheless of importance for the\r\nfarmer to know this, of which the nature of the manure analysed is\r\ngenerally a good indication. Unfortunately this is not shown in the case\r\nof _mixed_ manures; and this constitutes one of the reasons why mixed\r\nmanures are sometimes to be regarded with suspicion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Phosphoric Acid._\r\n\r\nThe amount of phosphates present in a manure is usually stated in its\r\nanalysis as so much phosphoric acid, while in a footnote the quantity of\r\ntricalcic (or ordinary bone) phosphate this amount is equivalent to is\r\nalso given, this being the unit of valuation. When the phosphates are in\r\na soluble condition they are stated as such, and at the same time a\r\nstatement is made as to the quantity of tricalcic phosphate which would\r\nbe required to furnish this amount by treatment with sulphuric acid.\r\nThus, for example, in an analysis of a superphosphate of lime, the\r\nstatement, _monocalcic phosphate, 17.3 per cent, equal to tricalcic\r\nphosphate rendered \"soluble,\" 27.2 per cent_, means that it would\r\nrequire 27.2 per cent of tricalcic phosphate to furnish 17.3 per cent of\r\nsoluble phosphate. Paradoxically enough, the former amount is called\r\n_\"soluble\" phosphate_, and such a superphosphate as the above would be\r\ndescribed as containing 27.2 per cent of \"soluble\" phosphate.\r\n\r\nAgain, there are different forms of the so-called \"insoluble\"\r\nphosphates,[248] although they are often not distinguished in a chemical\r\nanalysis. As we have already pointed out in the chapter on Basic Slag,\r\nphosphoric acid occurs in the slag in the form of tetrabasic phosphate\r\nof lime, although it is invariably stated in analysis as so much\r\ntricalcic phosphate. Then we have the so-called dibasic phosphate of\r\nlime, the form into which soluble phosphate in superphosphate is\r\nconverted when \"reversion\" takes place. Hitherto it has not been\r\ncustomary in this country--although the custom is prevalent both on the\r\nContinent and in America--to distinguish in the analysis of a\r\nsuperphosphate the \"reverted\" phosphate from the undissolved phosphate;\r\nsince the superior value of the former as a manure is not recognised in\r\nthe manure-trade.[249]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Importance of Mechanical Condition of Phosphate._\r\n\r\nA further point to which it is desirable to draw attention is the\r\n_mechanical_ condition of the different insoluble phosphates, which has\r\nan important influence on their value. A very wide difference, for\r\nexample, exists between the value of phosphate of lime in such a manure\r\nas Malden guano and in the crystalline mineral apatite; although,\r\nchemically considered, the form in which the phosphoric acid is present\r\nis the same in both substances.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Potash._\r\n\r\nPotash ought only to occur in a soluble form in manures. It is generally\r\nstated as so much potash, and in a footnote the equivalent amount of\r\nmuriate or sulphate of potash is given, the former being the more\r\nconcentrated form of potash.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of reference a table will be found in the Appendix[250]\r\ngiving some useful factors for converting different forms of nitrogen,\r\nphosphoric acid, and potash into one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Items in the Chemical Analysis of Manures._\r\n\r\nThe other items in the analysis of a manure are of comparatively\r\nsecondary importance compared with those already named. Among them may\r\nbe mentioned the _moisture_, the _insoluble matter_, and the _organic\r\nmatter_. The amount of moisture and the amount of sand are two items of\r\nimportance, since, if these are excessive, they afford presumption that\r\nthe manure has been adulterated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act._\r\n\r\nAn Act was passed, and came into operation in January 1894, for the\r\npurpose of compelling every vendor of manure manufactured in this\r\ncountry or imported from abroad to give to the purchaser \"an invoice\r\nstating the name of the article, and whether it is an artificially\r\ncompounded article or not, and what is at least the percentage of the\r\nnitrogen, soluble and insoluble phosphates, and potash, if any,\r\ncontained in the article, and this invoice shall have the same effect\r\nas a warranty by the seller of the statements contained therein.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Different Methods of Valuing Manures._\r\n\r\nThe monetary value of a manure depends upon a number of more or less\r\ncomplicated commercial considerations, such as the questions of supply\r\nand demand, &c., which need not here be discussed, and which similarly\r\nregulate the monetary value of any other article of commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n_\"Unit\" Value of Manurial Ingredients._\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of affording data for ascertaining the approximate value\r\nof a manure, tables have been drawn up giving what is called the \"unit\"\r\nvalue of the different manurial ingredients in various manures. This is\r\nobtained by dividing the market value of a manure per ton by the\r\npercentage of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash it contains. Thus,\r\nfor example, sulphate of ammonia of 97 per cent purity contains 25 per\r\ncent of ammonia, and at present (Dec. 1893) is valued at L13, 15s. per\r\nton. In order to obtain the unit value of ammonia in sulphate of\r\nammonia, we have only to divide L13, 15s. by 25, which gives us 11s. The\r\nvalue of such tables depends on the competence of those drawing them up,\r\nand they require to be subjected to constant revision. In the Appendix\r\nwill be found two of these tables, taken from the 'Transactions of the\r\nHighland and Agricultural Society of Scotland.'[251]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Intrinsic Value of Manures._\r\n\r\nBut there is another way of valuing manures, and that is by attempting\r\nto ascertain what their intrinsic worth is in producing an increase in\r\nthe returns of the crops. Of course it may be said that the intrinsic\r\nworth of manure affects directly its market value. This is doubtless\r\ntrue, but it is not the only factor in determining the market value of a\r\nmanure.\r\n\r\nAgain, the intrinsic worth of a manure may be said to vary according to\r\nthe soil to which it is applied and the climatic conditions. This being\r\nso, it is important for every farmer to try and ascertain for himself\r\nwhat the intrinsic value of different manures is on the soil of his\r\nfarm; and this can only be done by carrying out manuring experiments for\r\nhimself. This leads us to say a word or two on the important subject of\r\n\r\n\r\n_Field Experiments._\r\n\r\nIt is impossible that every farm should be able to support an experiment\r\nstation for the purpose of carrying out elaborate experiments on the\r\neffect of different manures on different crops. Nevertheless it is\r\npossible and highly desirable for _every_ farmer who is engaged in\r\narable farming on any scale to carry out simple experiments for the\r\npurpose of ascertaining the characteristic manurial requirements of his\r\nsoil. This can be done at the expenditure of a little time and trouble,\r\nand should be carried out in the following way. The field on which it is\r\ndesired to carry out the experiments should be divided into the\r\nrequisite number of experiment plots. These, which may be the tenth,\r\ntwentieth, or fortieth of an acre in extent, should be, if possible, on\r\na level piece of ground--all of them equally free from the shelter of\r\nhedge or tree, and otherwise subjected to the same conditions. The\r\nnature of the soil of the different plots, as well as its past\r\ntreatment, should be similar. It is desirable, in order to minimise\r\nexperimental error as much as possible, to carry out the experiments in\r\nduplicate, or even triplicate. In the first place, there should be what\r\nis called a _nothing_ plot--_i.e._, a plot receiving no manure. The\r\nproduce obtained from this plot, compared with the produce obtained from\r\nthe other manured plots, will thus furnish data for estimating the\r\nrespective amounts of increase obtained by different manures. One very\r\nsimple kind of experiment is what is called the \"seven-plot\" test. It\r\nconsists in testing the results obtained by using nitrogenous,\r\nphosphatic, and potash manures alone and in different combinations. Thus\r\nthe plots would be manured respectively as follows:--\r\n\r\nNo.                    No.\r\n 1. Nothing plot.   |   5. Nitrogen and phosphates.\r\n 2. Nitrogen.       |   6. Nitrogen and potash.\r\n 3. Phosphates.     |   7. Phosphates and potash.\r\n 4. Potash.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of other experiments might be such as the respective values\r\nof nitrogen in the different forms of sulphate of ammonia and nitrate of\r\nsoda; phosphoric acid as superphosphate, and in an undissolved form as\r\nThomas-slag; the relative importance of artificial and farmyard manure;\r\nthe effect of manures applied at different times, as well as the effect\r\nof different quantities of the same manure; the most economical manures\r\nfor different kinds of crops; and numerous other interesting problems\r\nconnected with the practical application of manures.\r\n\r\nIn carrying out these experiments, care should be taken not to have the\r\nexperimental plots _immediately_ adjoining one another, as the manure\r\napplied to the one plot may, by soaking through the soil, affect the\r\nresult on the adjoining plot. Especial note ought to be taken of the\r\nweather during the progress of the experiment. In order to make such\r\nexperiments as valuable as possible, they ought to be continued year\r\nafter year. At the conclusion of the experiment the produce obtained\r\nfrom each plot should be carefully weighed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Educational Value of Field Experiments._\r\n\r\nThe educative value of such experiments is very great, and in this\r\nconnection the remarks made by Mr F. J. Cooke, in a recent lecture\r\ndelivered to the London Farmers' Club, are worthy of most careful\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\"Local experiments,\" he says, \"teach the simple principles which should\r\ndetermine the selection of manures, as well as scientific accuracy and\r\nmethod in their use. The value of experiments is thus brought home to\r\nmen who would not go far to discover it; and the practice of a few\r\nsimple trials upon a correct system, each on his own farm, is\r\nencouraged. That such trials may be conducted with very little expense\r\nto the farmer, or other difficult qualifications, and yet to his great\r\npractical advantage, I will venture to assert on the ground of my own\r\npersonal experience. For some twenty years I have annually conducted\r\nprivate experiments on a very humble scale, and am not aware of any\r\nother separate practice which has been so useful to me. It has been\r\npursued upon two light-land farms in different parts of the same county.\r\nYet, in respect of manurial requirements, the proper treatment for one\r\nof them has differed so essentially from the other that a common\r\npractice upon both would have been simply ruinous.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Value of Manures deduced from Experiments._\r\n\r\nTables have been constructed for the purpose of showing the comparative\r\nvalue of different kinds of manures as deduced from such experiments,\r\nand may be fittingly compared with the tables giving the trade prices.\r\nWe have already quoted some of these tables in the Appendix to the\r\nchapter on Mineral Phosphates. These tables show the relative intrinsic\r\nvalue of different forms of phosphatic manures. In the Appendix[252] to\r\nthis chapter tables showing the relative value of different kinds of\r\nnitrogenous and potash manures will be found.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Value of Unexhausted Manures._\r\n\r\nA subject which has had much attention devoted to it of late years is\r\nthe question of the value of unexhausted manures in the soil. In the\r\nAgricultural Holdings Act special provision is made for giving\r\ncompensation to the out-going tenant of a farm for unexhausted manures\r\nin the soil. The Act has given rise to endless disputes between landlord\r\nand tenant, owing to the extreme difficulty of arriving at a\r\nsatisfactory estimate of what the value of the unexhausted manures in\r\nreality is. The difficulty arises from the fact that we have not\r\nsufficient data available for guiding us in estimating this value, which\r\nfurther varies under different conditions. The fertilising ingredients\r\nof a soil are present in the soil for the most part in an inert\r\ncondition, from which they are only slowly converted into an available\r\nform.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Potential Fertility of a Soil._\r\n\r\nAs indicating the total amount of the more important mineral ingredients\r\npresent in a soil, it may be mentioned that it has been calculated, in\r\nthe case of a poor sandy soil, _that the amount of potash it contains_\r\n(_provided it were in an available condition_) would be sufficient to\r\nyield three or four average crops of potatoes; of phosphates, nineteen\r\naverage crops; and of lime, seventy-three. But then only a very small\r\namount of this fertilising matter is in a readily available form.\r\n\r\nIt is for this reason that artificial manures, although added in such\r\nsmall amounts, exercise so striking an influence in increasing plants'\r\ngrowth. Their effect, however, is to a large extent only of a temporary\r\nnature; and in attempting to assess the unexhausted value of a manure a\r\nyear or two after its application, we must remember this fact.\r\n\r\nSome manures are very speedily taken up by plants, and some are very\r\neasily washed out of the soil. Others, again, it would seem highly\r\nprobable, have a tendency to become converted into a more or less inert\r\ncondition after a while. This remark may be especially applied to the\r\nfertilising constituents (chiefly nitrogen) in farmyard manure.[253] The\r\nwhole question, however, is little understood. One or two points may be\r\ndrawn attention to. In the first place, it may be safely affirmed that\r\nlittle direct effect can be expected from such quickly available and\r\neasily soluble forms of nitrogenous manures as nitrate of soda and\r\nsulphate of ammonia a year after application. Potash and phosphates, on\r\nthe other hand, may exercise an effect for a considerably longer period;\r\nand what the length of this period may be will depend on their amount\r\nand condition. Thus it is not likely that superphosphate will have much\r\neffect more than two years after application. On the other hand, such\r\nmanures as bones, basic slag, and farmyard manure may exert an\r\nappreciable influence for a number of years. How long exactly, it is\r\nwellnigh impossible to say, the rate at which they are applied and the\r\nnature of the soil having an important influence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tables of Value of Unexhausted Manures._\r\n\r\nNumerous tables have been drawn up for the purpose of guiding farmers in\r\nestimating this unexhausted value at different periods after\r\napplication, and in the case of different manures. Such tables, as a\r\nrule, furnish only very rough approximations, and are little better than\r\nmere guess-work. Still more complicated is the attempt to assess the\r\nmanurial value of foods consumed by the stock of the farm. Lawes and\r\nGilbert have devoted much attention to the elucidation of this difficult\r\nquestion, and have drawn up most elaborate and valuable tables,\r\nfurnishing data for calculating unexhausted manure value in the case of\r\ncommonly used foods. These tables are given in the Appendix.[254] In\r\nthem will be found the manurial value of different cattle-foods,\r\ncalculated on the basis of numerous experiments carried out at\r\nRothamsted.\r\n\r\nThus these experiments have demonstrated that, on an average, probably\r\nnot more than _one-tenth_ of the nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash a\r\nfood contains is removed from the food in its passage through the animal\r\nsystem. The exact amount will obviously depend on a variety of\r\nconditions, referred to already in a previous chapter.[255]\r\n\r\nIn explanation of these tables, it may be pointed out that Table I.\r\ngives the total quantities of the three fertilising ingredients in\r\nvarious foods; while Table II. shows the proportion retained in the\r\nanimal body and the proportion voided in the manure, as well as the\r\nmanurial value of the food, assuming that it exercises its full\r\ntheoretical effect. As this, however, is never fully realised, it is\r\nnecessary to make some deduction. The deduction suggested by the\r\nRothamsted experimenters, on the basis of their wide experience, is 50\r\nper cent for food consumed within the last year. That is to say, the\r\nmanurial value of food consumed during the last year is _only one-half\r\nits theoretical value_. For food consumed within the last year but one,\r\nthey suggest a deduction of one-third of the allowance for last year;\r\nwhile for food consumed three years back, a deduction of one-third from\r\nthis latter sum should be made; and so on for whatever number of years,\r\ndown to eight, may be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[248] The term _insoluble phosphates_ is an unfortunate one, as the word\r\ninsoluble is purely relative in its significance. _Undissolved_\r\nphosphates would be a better term.\r\n\r\n[249] The amount of \"reverted\" phosphate is estimated by _the ammonium\r\ncitrate process_.\r\n\r\n[250] See Note I., p. 553.\r\n\r\n[251] See Note II., p. 554.\r\n\r\n[252] See Note III., p. 556.\r\n\r\n[253] See Chapter on Farmyard Manure, p. 271.\r\n\r\n[254] See Note IV., p. 557.\r\n\r\n[255] See Chapter on Farmyard Manure, pp. 224-236.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE I.

Henry Gilbert. They have thus\r\nbeen in progress for a period of fifty years--a fact which was\r\ncelebrated a few months ago by the presentation of numerous\r\ncongratulatory addresses from various learned and agricultural societies\r\nto the distinguished investigators, and the erection of a memorial\r\ngranite slab at Rothamsted. What increases the feeling of gratitude due\r\nto Sir John Lawes by the agricultural community, is the fact that the\r\nentire expense of conducting these experiments has been borne by\r\nhimself, and he has further most generously handed over to the nation a\r\nlarge sum of money and a certain area of land for carrying them on in\r\nperpetuity.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nature of Experiments on Crops and Manures._\r\n\r\nThe earliest systematic experiments were on turnips, and since then\r\nalmost every common crop has been experimented on. Table I. (p. 562) is\r\na list of the different experiments, with their duration, area, and\r\nnumber of plots.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Soil of Rothamsted._\r\n\r\nBefore describing the more striking results of these experiments, it may\r\nbe advisable to say that the elevation of the land at Rothamsted is\r\nabout 400 feet above sea-level; that the average rainfall is about 28\r\ninches per annum; and that the surface-soil is a heavy loam, and the\r\nsubsoil a stiff clay, resting on chalk.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE I.--LIST OF ROTHAMSTED FIELD EXPERIMENTS.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------+------------+----------+------------\r\n       Crops.                     |  Duration. |  Area.   |   Plots.\r\n----------------------------------+------------+----------+------------\r\n                                  |    Years.  |  Acres.  |\r\nWheat (various manures)           |     50     |   11     | 34 (or 37)\r\nWheat alternated with fallow      |     42     |    1     |      2\r\nWheat (varieties)                 |     15     |  4-8     |  about 20\r\nBarley (various manures)          |     42     |    4-1/4 |     29\r\nOats (various manures)            |     10[1]  |    0-3/4 |      6\r\nBeans (various manures)           |     32[2]  |    1-1/4 |     10\r\nBeans (various manures)           |     27[3]  |    1     |      5\r\nBeans, alternated with wheat      |     28[4]  |    1     |     10\r\nClover (various manures)          |     29[5]  |    3     |     18\r\nVarious leguminous plants         |     16     |    3     |     18\r\n                                  |            |          |\r\nTurnips (various manures)         |     28[6]  |    8     |     40\r\nSugar-beet (various manures)      |      5     |    8     |     41\r\nMangel-wurzel (various manures)   |     18     |    8     |     41\r\n                                  +------------+          |\r\n      Total root crops            |     51     |          |\r\n                                  +------------+          |\r\n                                  |            |          |\r\nPotatoes (various manures)        |     18     |    2     |     10\r\nRotation (various manures)        |     46     |    3     |     12\r\nPermanent grass (various manures) |     38     |    7     |     22\r\n----------------------------------+------------+----------+------------\r\n1.

With such\r\nwide variations, due to season, it is extremely difficult, as Sir J.\r\nHenry Gilbert has pointed out, to estimate rate of decline due to\r\nexhaustion. Excluding the very bad seasons, this may be reckoned at from\r\none-fourth to one-third of a bushel per acre per annum. _The return of\r\nthe first year is 15 bushels, while the yield of the forty-ninth season\r\nis 9-3/8 bushels._ The average of the returns obtained during these\r\nfifty years is really in _excess of the average yield of the principal\r\nwheat-producing countries in the world_. This is truly a most astounding\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nThe next experiments we shall describe are those on the influence of\r\nfarmyard manure on the wheat crop when grown continuously.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE IV.--WHEAT GROWN CONTINUOUSLY WITH FARMYARD MANURE (14\r\ntons per annum).\r\n\r\n                                      Weight per\r\n                         Bushels.       bushel       Straw\r\n                                         (lb.)

That this is due to the nitrogen it contains, is strikingly\r\nillustrated by the fact that mixed mineral manures alone give less than\r\nhalf the return, and also by the fact that ammonia salts alone give a\r\nreturn twice as great as mineral mixtures; while, lastly, the mixture of\r\nmineral manures and ammonia salts gives but a slight increase over that\r\nobtained with ammonia salts alone.\r\n\r\nThe remaining results, selected from a much larger number, need no\r\ncomment, and we shall give them in tabular form.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable V.--WHEAT GROWN CONTINUOUSLY WITH ARTIFICIAL
