where lived and reigned, in\r\nmystery, the High Pontiff of the adjoining isles: prince, priest, and\r\ngod, in his own proper person: great lord paramount over many kings in\r\nMardi; his hands full of scepters and crosiers.\r\n\r\nSoon, rounding a lofty and insulated shore, the great central peak of\r\nthe island came in sight; domineering over the neighboring hills; the\r\nsame aspiring pinnacle, descried in drawing near the archipelago in the\r\nChamois.\r\n\r\n“Tall Peak of Ofo!” cried Babbalanja, “how comes it that thy shadow so\r\nbroods over Mardi; flinging new shades upon spots already shaded by the\r\nhill-sides; shade upon shade!”\r\n\r\n“Yet, so it is,” said Yoomy, sadly, “that where that shadow falls, gay\r\nflowers refuse to spring; and men long dwelling therein become shady of\r\nface and of soul. ‘Hast thou come from out the shadows of Ofo?’\r\ninquires the stranger, of one with a clouded brow.”\r\n\r\n“It was by this same peak,” said Mohi, “that the nimble god Roo, a\r\ngreat sinner above, came down from the skies, a very long time ago.\r\nThree skips and a jump, and he landed on the plain. But alas, poor Roo!\r\nthough easy the descent, there was no climbing back.”\r\n\r\n“No wonder, then,” said Babbalanja, “that the peak is inaccessible to\r\nman. Though, with a strange infatuation, many still make pilgrimages\r\nthereto; and wearily climb and climb, till slipping from the rocks,\r\nthey fall headlong backward, and oftentimes perish at its base.”\r\n\r\n“Ay,” said Mohi, “in vain, on all sides of the Peak, various paths are\r\ntried; in vain new ones are cut through the cliffs and the brambles:—\r\nOfo yet remains inaccessible.”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless,” said Babbalanja, “by some it is believed, that those,\r\nwho by dint of hard struggling climb so high as to become invisible\r\nfrom the plain; that these have attained the summit; though others much\r\ndoubt, whether their becoming invisible is not because of their having\r\nfallen, and perished by the way.”\r\n\r\n“And wherefore,” said Media, “do you mortals undertake the ascent at\r\nall? why not be content on the plain? and even if attainable, what\r\nwould you do upon that lofty, clouded summit? Or how can you hope to\r\nbreathe that rarefied air, unfitted for your human lungs?”\r\n\r\n“True, my lord,” said Babbalanja; “and Bardianna asserts that the plain\r\nalone was intended for man; who should be content to dwell under the\r\nshade of its groves, though the roots thereof descend into the darkness\r\nof the earth. But, my lord, you well know, that there are those in\r\nMardi, who secretly regard all stories connected with this peak, as\r\ninventions of the people of Maramma. They deny that any thing is to be\r\ngained by making a pilgrimage thereto. And for warranty, they appeal to\r\nthe sayings of the great prophet Alma.”\r\n\r\nCried Mohi, “But Alma is also quoted by others, in vindication of the\r\npilgrimages to Ofo. They declare that the prophet himself was the first\r\npilgrim that thitherward journeyed: that from thence he departed to the\r\nskies.”\r\n\r\nNow, excepting this same peak, Maramma is all rolling hill and dale,\r\nlike the sea after a storm; which then seems not to roll, but to stand\r\nstill, poising its mountains. Yet the landscape of Maramma has not the\r\nmerriness of meadows; partly because of the shadow of Ofo, and partly\r\nbecause of the solemn groves in which the Morais and temples are\r\nburied.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mohi, not one solitary tree bearing fruit, not one\r\nesculent root, grows in all the isle; the population wholly depending\r\nupon the large tribute remitted from the neighboring shores.\r\n\r\n“It is not that the soil is unproductive,” said Mohi, “that these\r\nthings are so. It is extremely fertile; but the inhabitants say that it\r\nwould be wrong to make a Bread-fruit orchard of the holy island.”\r\n\r\n“And hence, my lord,” said Babbalanja, “while others are charged with\r\nthe business of their temporal welfare, these Islanders take no thought\r\nof the morrow; and broad Maramma lies one fertile waste in the lagoon.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nThey Land\r\n\r\n\r\nComing close to the island, the pennons and trappings of our canoes\r\nwere removed; and Vee-Vee was commanded to descend from the shark’s\r\nmouth; and for a time to lay aside his conch. In token of reverence,\r\nour paddlers also stripped to the waist; an example which even Media\r\nfollowed; though, as a king, the same homage he rendered, was at times\r\nrendered himself.\r\n\r\nAt every place, hitherto visited, joyous crowds stood ready to hail our\r\narrival; but the shores of Maramma were silent, and forlorn.\r\n\r\nSaid Babbalanja, “It looks not as if the lost one were here.”\r\n\r\nAt length we landed in a little cove nigh a valley, which Mohi called\r\nUma; and here in silence we beached our canoes.\r\n\r\nBut presently, there came to us an old man, with a beard white as the\r\nmane of the pale horse. He was clad in a midnight robe. He fanned\r\nhimself with a fan of faded leaves. A child led him by the hand, for he\r\nwas blind, wearing a green plantain leaf over his plaited brow.\r\n\r\nHim, Media accosted, making mention who we were, and on what errand we\r\ncame: to seek out Yillah, and behold the isle.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Pani, for such was his name, gave us a courteous reception;\r\nand lavishly promised to discover sweet Yillah; declaring that in\r\nMaramma, if any where, the long-lost maiden must be found. He assured\r\nus, that throughout the whole land he would lead us; leaving no place,\r\ndesirable to be searched, unexplored.\r\n\r\nAnd so saying, he conducted us to his dwelling, for refreshment and\r\nrepose.\r\n\r\nIt was large and lofty. Near by, however, were many miserable hovels,\r\nwith squalid inmates. But the old man’s retreat was exceedingly\r\ncomfortable; especially abounding in mats for lounging; his rafters\r\nwere bowed down by calabashes of good cheer.\r\n\r\nDuring the repast which ensued, blind Pani, freely partaking, enlarged\r\nupon the merit of abstinence; declaring that a thatch overhead, and a\r\ncocoanut tree, comprised all that was necessary for the temporal\r\nwelfare of a Mardian. More than this, he assured us was sinful.\r\n\r\nHe now made known, that he officiated as guide in this quarter of the\r\ncountry; and that as he had renounced all other pursuits to devote\r\nhimself to showing strangers the island; and more particularly the best\r\nway to ascend lofty Ofo; he was necessitated to seek remuneration for\r\nhis toil.\r\n\r\n“My lord,” then whispered Mohi to Media “the great prophet Alma always\r\ndeclared, that, without charge, this island was free to all.”\r\n\r\n“What recompense do you desire, old man?” said Media to Pani.\r\n\r\n“What I seek is but little:—twenty rolls of fine tappa; two score mats\r\nof best upland grass; one canoe-load of bread-fruit and yams; ten\r\ngourds of wine; and forty strings of teeth;—you are a large company,\r\nbut my requisitions are small.”\r\n\r\n“Very small,” said Mohi.\r\n\r\n“You are extortionate, good Pani,” said Media. “And what wants an aged\r\nmortal like you with all these things?”\r\n\r\n“I thought superfluities were worthless; nay, sinful,” said Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n“Is not this your habitation already more than abundantly supplied with\r\nall desirable furnishings?” asked Yoomy.\r\n\r\n“I am but a lowly laborer,” said the old man, meekly crossing his arms,\r\n“but does not the lowliest laborer ask and receive his reward? and\r\nshall I miss mine?—But I beg charity of none. What I ask, I demand; and\r\nin the dread name of great Alma, who appointed me a guide.” And to and\r\nfro he strode, groping as he went.\r\n\r\nMarking his blindness, whispered Babbalanja to Media, “My lord,\r\nmethinks this Pani must be a poor guide. In his journeys inland, his\r\nlittle child leads him; why not, then, take the guide’s guide?”\r\n\r\nBut Pani would not part with the child.\r\n\r\nThen said Mohi in a low voice, “My lord Media, though I am no appointed\r\nguide; yet, will I undertake to lead you aright over all this island;\r\nfor I am an old man, and have been here oft by myself; though I can not\r\nundertake to conduct you up the peak of Ofo, and to the more secret\r\ntemples.”\r\n\r\nThen Pani said: “and what mortal may this be, who pretends to thread\r\nthe labyrinthine wilds of Maramma? Beware!”\r\n\r\n“He is one with eyes that see,” made answer Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n“Follow him not,” said Pani, “for he will lead thee astray; no Yillah\r\nwill he find; and having no warrant as a guide, the curses of Alma will\r\naccompany him.”\r\n\r\nNow, this was not altogether without effect; for Pani and his fathers\r\nbefore him had always filled the office of guide.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Media at last decided, that, this time, Mohi should\r\nconduct us; which being communicated to Pani, he desired us to remove\r\nfrom his roof. So withdrawing to the skirt of a neighboring grove, we\r\nlingered awhile, to refresh ourselves for the journey in prospect.\r\n\r\nAs we here reclined, there came up from the sea-side a party of\r\npilgrims, but newly arrived.\r\n\r\nApprised of their coming, Pani and his child went out to meet them; and\r\nstanding in the path he cried, “I am the appointed guide; in the name\r\nof Alma I conduct all pilgrims to the temples.”\r\n\r\n“This must be the worthy Pani,” said one of the strangers, turning upon\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\n“Let us take him, then, for our guide,” cried they; and all drew near.\r\n\r\nBut upon accosting him; they were told, that he guided none without\r\nrecompense.\r\n\r\nAnd now, being informed, that the foremost of the pilgrims was one\r\nDivino, a wealthy chief of a distant island, Pani demanded of him his\r\nrequital.\r\n\r\nBut the other demurred; and by many soft speeches at length abated the\r\nrecompense to three promissory cocoanuts, which he covenanted to send\r\nPani at some future day.\r\n\r\nThe next pilgrim accosted, was a sad-eyed maiden, in decent but scanty\r\nraiment; who without seeking to diminish Pani’s demands promptly placed\r\nin his hands a small hoard of the money of Mardi.\r\n\r\n“Take it, holy guide,” she said, “it is all I have.”\r\n\r\nBut the third pilgrim, one Fanna, a hale matron, in handsome apparel,\r\nneeded no asking to bestow her goods. Calling upon her attendants to\r\nadvance with their burdens, she quickly unrolled them; and wound round\r\nand round Pani, fold after fold of the costliest tappas; and filled\r\nboth his hands with teeth; and his mouth with some savory marmalade;\r\nand poured oil upon his head; and knelt and besought of him a blessing.\r\n\r\n“From the bottom of my heart I bless thee,” said Pani; and still\r\nholding her hands exclaimed, “Take example from this woman, oh Divino;\r\nand do ye likewise, ye pilgrims all.”\r\n\r\n“Not to-day,” said Divino.\r\n\r\n“We are not rich, like unto Fauna,” said the rest.\r\n\r\nNow, the next pilgrim was a very old and miserable man; stone-blind,\r\ncovered with rags; and supporting his steps with a staff.\r\n\r\n“My recompense,” said Pani.\r\n\r\n“Alas! I have naught to give. Behold my poverty.”\r\n\r\n“I can not see,” replied Pani; but feeling of his garments, he said,\r\n“Thou wouldst deceive me; hast thou not this robe, and this staff?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Merciful Pani, take not my all!” wailed the pilgrim. But his\r\nworthless gaberdine was thrust into the dwelling of the guide.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the matron was still enveloping Pani in her interminable\r\ntappas.\r\n\r\nBut the sad-eyed maiden, removing her upper mantle, threw it over the\r\nnaked form of the beggar.\r\n\r\nThe fifth pilgrim was a youth of an open, ingenuous aspect; and with an\r\neye, full of eyes; his step was light.\r\n\r\n“Who art thou?” cried Pani, as the stripling touched him in passing.\r\n\r\n“I go to ascend the Peak,” said the boy.\r\n\r\n“Then take me for guide.”\r\n\r\n“No, I am strong and lithesome. Alone must I go.”\r\n\r\n“But how knowest thou the way?”\r\n\r\n“There are many ways: the right one I must seek for myself.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, poor deluded one,” sighed Pani; “but thus is it ever with youth;\r\nand rejecting the monitions of wisdom, suffer they must. Go on, and\r\nperish!”\r\n\r\nTurning, the boy exclaimed—“Though I act counter to thy counsels, oh\r\nPani, I but follow the divine instinct in me.”\r\n\r\n“Poor youth!” murmured Babbalanja. “How earnestly he struggles in his\r\nbonds. But though rejecting a guide, still he clings to that legend of\r\nthe Peak.”\r\n\r\nThe rest of the pilgrims now tarried with the guide, preparing for\r\ntheir journey inland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nThey Pass Through The Woods\r\n\r\n\r\nRefreshed by our stay in the grove, we rose, and placed ourselves under\r\nthe guidance of Mohi; who went on in advance.\r\n\r\nWinding our way among jungles, we came to a deep hollow, planted with\r\none gigantic palm-shaft, belted round by saplings, springing from its\r\nroots. But, Laocoon-like, sire and sons stood locked in the serpent\r\nfolds of gnarled, distorted banians; and the banian-bark, eating into\r\ntheir vital wood, corrupted their veins of sap, till all those\r\npalm-nuts were poisoned chalices.\r\n\r\nNear by stood clean-limbed, comely manchineels, with lustrous leaves\r\nand golden fruit. You would have deemed them Trees of Life; but\r\nunderneath their branches grew no blade of grass, no herb, nor moss;\r\nthe bare earth was scorched by heaven’s own dews, filtrated through\r\nthat fatal foliage.\r\n\r\nFarther on, there frowned a grove of blended banian boughs,\r\nthick-ranked manchineels, and many a upas; their summits gilded by the\r\nsun; but below, deep shadows, darkening night-shade ferns, and\r\nmandrakes. Buried in their midst, and dimly seen among large leaves,\r\nall halberd-shaped, were piles of stone, supporting falling temples of\r\nbamboo. Thereon frogs leaped in dampness, trailing round their slime.\r\nThick hung the rafters with lines of pendant sloths; the upas trees\r\ndropped darkness round; so dense the shade, nocturnal birds found there\r\nperpetual night; and, throve on poisoned air. Owls hooted from dead\r\nboughs; or, one by one, sailed by on silent pinions; cranes stalked\r\nabroad, or brooded, in the marshes; adders hissed; bats smote the\r\ndarkness; ravens croaked; and vampires, fixed on slumbering lizards,\r\nfanned the sultry air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nHivohitee MDCCCXLVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, those doleful woodlands passed, straightway converse was renewed,\r\nand much discourse took place, concerning Hivohitee, Pontiff of the\r\nisle.\r\n\r\nFor, during our first friendly conversation with Pani, Media had\r\ninquired for Hivohitee, and sought to know in what part of the island\r\nhe abode.\r\n\r\nWhereto Pani had replied, that the Pontiff would be invisible for\r\nseveral days to come; being engaged with particular company.\r\n\r\nAnd upon further inquiry, as to who were the personages monopolizing\r\nhis hospitalities, Media was dumb when informed, that they were no\r\nother than certain incorporeal deities from above, passing the\r\nCapricorn Solstice at Maramma.\r\n\r\nAs on we journeyed, much curiosity being expressed to know more of the\r\nPontiff and his guests, old Mohi, familiar with these things, was\r\ncommanded to enlighten the company. He complied; and his recital was\r\nnot a little significant, of the occasional credulity of chroniclers.\r\n\r\nAccording to his statement, the deities entertained by Hivohitee\r\nbelonged to the third class of immortals. These, however, were far\r\nelevated above the corporeal demi-gods of Mardi. Indeed, in Hivohitee’s\r\neyes, the greatest demi-gods were as gourds. Little wonder, then, that\r\ntheir superiors were accounted the most genteel characters on his\r\nvisiting list.\r\n\r\nThese immortals were wonderfully fastidious and dainty as to the\r\natmosphere they breathed; inhaling no sublunary air, but that of the\r\nelevated interior; where the Pontiff had a rural lodge, for the special\r\naccommodation of impalpable guests; who were entertained at very small\r\ncost; dinners being unnecessary, and dormitories superfluous.\r\n\r\nBut Hivohitee permitted not the presence of these celestial grandees,\r\nto interfere with his own solid comfort. Passing his mornings in highly\r\nintensified chat, he thrice reclined at his ease; partaking of a fine\r\nplantain-pudding, and pouring out from a calabash of celestial old\r\nwine; meanwhile, carrying on the flow of soul with his guests. And\r\ntruly, the sight of their entertainer thus enjoying himself in the\r\nflesh, while they themselves starved on the ether, must have been\r\nexceedingly provoking to these aristocratic and aerial strangers.\r\n\r\nIt was reported, furthermore, that Hivohitee, one of the haughtiest of\r\nPontiffs, purposely treated his angelical guests thus cavalierly; in\r\norder to convince them, that though a denizen of earth; a sublunarian;\r\nand in respect of heaven, a mere provincial; he (Hivohitee) accounted\r\nhimself full as good as seraphim from the capital; and that too at the\r\nCapricorn Solstice, or any other time of the year. Strongly bent was\r\nHivohitee upon humbling their supercilious pretensions.\r\n\r\nBesides, was he not accounted a great god in the land? supreme? having\r\npower of life and death? essaying the deposition of kings? and dwelling\r\nin moody state, all by himself, in the goodliest island of Mardi?\r\nThough here, be it said, that his assumptions of temporal supremacy\r\nwere but seldom made good by express interference with the secular\r\nconcerns of the neighboring monarchs; who, by force of arms, were too\r\napt to argue against his claims to authority; however, in theory, they\r\nbowed to it. And now, for the genealogy of Hivohitee; for eighteen\r\nhundred and forty-seven Hivohitees were alleged to have gone before\r\nhim. He came in a right line from the divine Hivohitee I.: the original\r\ngrantee of the empire of men’s souls and the first swayer of a crosier.\r\nThe present Pontiff’s descent was unquestionable; his dignity having\r\nbeen transmitted through none but heirs male; the whole procession of\r\nHigh Priests being the fruit of successive marriages between uterine\r\nbrother and sister. A conjunction deemed incestuous in some lands; but,\r\nhere, held the only fit channel for the pure transmission of elevated\r\nrank.\r\n\r\nAdded to the hereditary appellation, Hivohitee, which simply denoted\r\nthe sacerdotal station of the Pontiffs, and was but seldom employed in\r\ncurrent discourse, they were individualized by a distinctive name,\r\nbestowed upon them at birth. And the degree of consideration in which\r\nthey were held, may be inferred from the fact, that during the lifetime\r\nof a Pontiff, the leading sound in his name was banned to ordinary\r\nuses. Whence, at every new accession to the archiepiscopal throne, it\r\ncame to pass, that multitudes of words and phrases were either\r\nessentially modified, or wholly dropped. Wherefore, the language of\r\nMaramma was incessantly fluctuating; and had become so full of\r\njargonings, that the birds in the groves were greatly puzzled; not\r\nknowing where lay the virtue of sounds, so incoherent.\r\n\r\nAnd, in a good measure, this held true of all tongues spoken throughout\r\nthe Archipelago; the birds marveling at mankind, and mankind at the\r\nbirds; wondering how they could continually sing; when, for all man\r\nknew to the contrary, it was impossible they could be holding\r\nintelligent discourse. And thus, though for thousands of years, men and\r\nbirds had been dwelling together in Mardi, they remained wholly\r\nignorant of each other’s secrets; the Islander regarding the fowl as a\r\nsenseless songster, forever in the clouds; and the fowl him, as a\r\nscreeching crane, destitute of pinions and lofty aspirations.\r\n\r\nOver and above numerous other miraculous powers imputed to the Pontiffs\r\nas spiritual potentates, there was ascribed to them one special\r\nprivilege of a secular nature: that of healing with a touch the bites\r\nof the ravenous sharks, swarming throughout the lagoon. With these they\r\nwere supposed to be upon the most friendly terms; according to popular\r\naccounts, sociably bathing with them in the sea; permitting them to rub\r\ntheir noses against their priestly thighs; playfully mouthing their\r\nhands, with all their tiers of teeth.\r\n\r\nAt the ordination of a Pontiff, the ceremony was not deemed complete,\r\nuntil embarking in his barge, he was saluted High Priest by three\r\nsharks drawing near; with teeth turned up, swimming beside his canoe.\r\n\r\nThese monsters were deified in Maramma; had altars there; it was deemed\r\nworse than homicide to kill one. “And what if they destroy human life?”\r\nsay the Islanders, “are they not sacred?”\r\n\r\nNow many more wonderful things were related touching Hivohitee; and\r\nthough one could not but doubt the validity of many prerogatives\r\nascribed to him, it was nevertheless hard to do otherwise, than\r\nentertain for the Pontiff that sort of profound consideration, which\r\nall render to those who indisputably possess the power of quenching\r\nhuman life with a wish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nThey Visit The Great Morai\r\n\r\n\r\nAs garrulous guide to the party, Braid-Beard soon brought us nigh the\r\ngreat Morai of Maramma, the burial-place of the Pontiffs, and a rural\r\npromenade, for certain idols there inhabiting.\r\n\r\nOur way now led through the bed of a shallow water-course; Mohi\r\nobserving, as we went, that our feet were being washed at every step;\r\nwhereas, to tread the dusty earth would be to desecrate the holy Morai,\r\nby transferring thereto, the base soil of less sacred ground.\r\n\r\nHere and there, thatched arbors were thrown over the stream, for the\r\naccommodation of devotees; who, in these consecrated waters, issuing\r\nfrom a spring in the Morai, bathed their garments, that long life might\r\nensue. Yet, as Braid-Beard assured us, sometimes it happened, that\r\ndivers feeble old men zealously donning their raiment immediately after\r\nimmersion became afflicted with rheumatics; and instances were related\r\nof their falling down dead, in this their pursuit of longevity.\r\n\r\nComing to the Morai, we found it inclosed by a wall; and while the rest\r\nwere surmounting it, Mohi was busily engaged in the apparently childish\r\noccupation of collecting pebbles. Of these, however, to our no small\r\nsurprise, he presently made use, by irreverently throwing them at all\r\nobjects to which he was desirous of directing attention. In this\r\nmanner, was pointed out a black boar’s head, suspended from a bough.\r\nFull twenty of these sentries were on post in the neighboring trees.\r\n\r\nProceeding, we came to a hillock of bone-dry sand, resting upon the\r\notherwise loamy soil. Possessing a secret, preservative virtue, this\r\nsand had, ages ago, been brought from a distant land, to furnish a\r\nsepulcher for the Pontiffs; who here, side by side, and sire by son,\r\nslumbered all peacefully in the fellowship of the grave. Mohi declared,\r\nthat were the sepulcher to be opened, it would be the resurrection of\r\nthe whole line of High Priests. “But a resurrection of bones, after\r\nall,” said Babbalanja, ever osseous in his allusions to the departed.\r\n\r\nPassing on, we came to a number of Runic-looking stones, all over\r\nhieroglyphical inscriptions, and placed round an elliptical aperture;\r\nwhere welled up the sacred spring of the Morai, clear as crystal, and\r\nshowing through its waters, two tiers of sharp, tusk-like stones; the\r\nmouth of Oro, so called; and it was held, that if any secular hand\r\nshould be immersed in the spring, straight upon it those stony jaws\r\nwould close.\r\n\r\nWe next came to a large image of a dark-hued stone, representing a\r\nburly man, with an overgrown head, and abdomen hollowed out, and open\r\nfor inspection; therein, were relics of bones. Before this image we\r\npaused. And whether or no it was Mohi’s purpose to make us tourists\r\nquake with his recitals, his revelations were far from agreeable. At\r\ncertain seasons, human beings were offered to the idol, which being an\r\nepicure in the matter of sacrifices, would accept of no ordinary fare.\r\nTo insure his digestion, all indirect routes to the interior were\r\navoided; the sacrifices being packed in the ventricle itself.\r\n\r\nNear to this image of Doleema, so called, a solitary forest-tree was\r\npointed out; leafless and dead to the core. But from its boughs hang\r\nnumerous baskets, brimming over with melons, grapes, and guavas. And\r\ndaily these baskets were replenished.\r\n\r\nAs we here stood, there passed a hungry figure, in ragged raiment:\r\nhollow cheeks, and hollow eyes. Wistfully he eyed the offerings; but\r\nretreated; knowing it was sacrilege to touch them. There, they must\r\ndecay, in honor of the god Ananna; for so this dead tree was\r\ndenominated by Mohi.\r\n\r\nNow, as we were thus strolling about the Morai, the old chronicler\r\nelucidating its mysteries, we suddenly spied Pani and the pilgrims\r\napproaching the image of Doleema; his child leading the guide.\r\n\r\n“This,” began Pani, pointing to the idol of stone, “is the holy god\r\nAnanna who lives in the sap of this green and flourishing tree.”\r\n\r\n“Thou meanest not, surely, this stone image we behold?” said Divino.\r\n\r\n“I mean the tree,” said the guide. “It is no stone image.”\r\n\r\n“Strange,” muttered the chief; “were it not a guide that spoke, I would\r\ndeny it. As it is, I hold my peace.”\r\n\r\n“Mystery of mysteries!” cried the blind old pilgrim; “is it, then, a\r\nstone image that Pani calls a tree? Oh, Oro, that I had eyes to see,\r\nthat I might verily behold it, and then believe it to be what it is\r\nnot; that so I might prove the largeness of my faith; and so merit the\r\nblessing of Alma.”\r\n\r\n“Thrice sacred Ananna,” murmured the sad-eyed maiden, falling upon her\r\nknees before Doleema, “receive my adoration. Of thee, I know nothing,\r\nbut what the guide has spoken. I am but a poor, weak-minded maiden,\r\njudging not for myself, but leaning upon others that are wiser. These\r\nthings are above me. I am afraid to think. In Alma’s name, receive my\r\nhomage.”\r\n\r\nAnd she flung flowers before the god.\r\n\r\nBut Fauna, the hale matron, turning upon Pani, exclaimed, “Receive more\r\ngifts, oh guide.” And again she showered them upon him.\r\n\r\nUpon this, the willful boy who would not have Pani for his guide,\r\nentered the Morai; and perceiving the group before the image, walked\r\nrapidly to where they were. And beholding the idol, he regarded it\r\nattentively, and said:—“This must be the image of Doleema; but I am not\r\nsure.”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” cried the blind pilgrim, “it is the holy tree Ananna, thou\r\nwayward boy.”\r\n\r\n“A tree? whatever it may be, it is not that; thou art blind, old man.”\r\n\r\n“But though blind, I have that which thou lackest.”\r\n\r\nThen said Pani, turning upon the boy, “Depart from the holy Morai, and\r\ncorrupt not the hearts of these pilgrims. Depart, I say; and, in the\r\nsacred name of Alma, perish in thy endeavors to climb the Peak.”\r\n\r\n“I may perish there in truth,” said the boy, with sadness; “but it\r\nshall be in the path revealed to me in my dream. And think not, oh\r\nguide, that I perfectly rely upon gaining that lofty summit. I will\r\nclimb high Ofo with hope, not faith; Oh, mighty Oro, help me!”\r\n\r\n“Be not impious,” said Pani; “pronounce not Oro’s sacred name too\r\nlightly.”\r\n\r\n“Oro is but a sound,” said the boy. “They call the supreme god, Ati, in\r\nmy native isle; it is the soundless thought of him, oh guide, that is\r\nin me.”\r\n\r\n“Hark to his rhapsodies! Hark, how he prates of mysteries, that not\r\neven Hivohitee can fathom.”\r\n\r\n“Nor he, nor thou, nor I, nor any; Oro, to all, is Oro the unknown.”\r\n\r\n“Why claim to know Oro, then, better than others?”\r\n\r\n“I am not so vain; and I have little to substitute for what I can not\r\nreceive. I but feel Oro in me, yet can not declare the thought.”\r\n\r\n“Proud boy! thy humility is a pretense; at heart, thou deemest thyself\r\nwiser than Mardi.”\r\n\r\n“Not near so wise. To believe is a haughty thing; my very doubts\r\nhumiliate me. I weep and doubt; all Mardi may be light; and I too\r\nsimple to discern.”\r\n\r\n“He is mad,” said the chief Divino; “never before heard I such words.”\r\n\r\n“They are thoughts,” muttered the guide.\r\n\r\n“Poor fool!” cried Fauna.\r\n\r\n“Lost youth!” sighed the maiden.\r\n\r\n“He is but a child,” said the beggar. These whims will soon depart;\r\nonce I was like him; but, praise be to Alma, in the hour of sickness I\r\nrepented, feeble old man that I am!”\r\n\r\n“It is because I am young and in health,” said the boy, “that I more\r\nnourish the thoughts, that are born of my youth and my health. I am\r\nfresh from my Maker, soul and body unwrinkled. On thy sick couch, old\r\nman, they took thee at advantage.”\r\n\r\n“Turn from the blasphemer,” cried Pani. “Hence! thou evil one, to the\r\nperdition in store.”\r\n\r\n“I will go my ways,” said the boy, “but Oro will shape the end.”\r\n\r\nAnd he quitted the Morai.\r\n\r\nAfter conducting the party round the sacred inclosure, assisting his\r\nway with his staff, for his child had left him, Pani seated himself on\r\na low, mossy stone, grimly surrounded by idols; and directed the\r\npilgrims to return to his habitation; where, ere long he would rejoin\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe pilgrims departed, he remained in profound meditation; while,\r\nbackward and forward, an invisible ploughshare turned up the long\r\nfurrows on his brow.\r\n\r\nLong he was silent; then muttered to himself, “That boy, that wild,\r\nwise boy, has stabbed me to the heart. His thoughts are my suspicions.\r\nBut he is honest. Yet I harm none. Multitudes must have unspoken\r\nmeditations as well as I. Do we then mutually deceive? Off masks,\r\nmankind, that I may know what warranty of fellowship with others, my\r\nown thoughts possess. Why, upon this one theme, oh Oro! must all\r\ndissemble? Our thoughts are not our own. Whate’er it be, an honest\r\nthought must have some germ of truth. But we must set, as flows the\r\ngeneral stream; I blindly follow, where I seem to lead; the crowd of\r\npilgrims is so great, they see not there is none to guide.—It hinges\r\nupon this: Have we angelic spirits? But in vain, in vain, oh Oro! I\r\nessay to live out of this poor, blind body, fit dwelling for my\r\nsightless soul. Death, death:—blind, am I dead? for blindness seems a\r\nconsciousness of death. Will my grave be more dark, than all is now?—\r\nFrom dark to dark!—What is this subtle something that is in me, and\r\neludes me? Will it have no end? When, then, did it begin? All, all is\r\nchaos! What is this shining light in heaven, this sun they tell me of?\r\nOr, do they lie? Methinks, it might blaze convictions; but I brood and\r\ngrope in blackness; I am dumb with doubt; yet, ’tis not doubt, but\r\nworse: I doubt my doubt. Oh, ye all-wise spirits in the air, how can ye\r\nwitness all this woe, and give no sign? Would, would that mine were a\r\nsettled doubt, like that wild boy’s, who without faith, seems full of\r\nit. The undoubting doubter believes the most. Oh! that I were he.\r\nMethinks that daring boy hath Alma in him, struggling to be free. But\r\nthose pilgrims: that trusting girl.—What, if they saw me as I am?\r\nPeace, peace, my soul; on, mask, again.”\r\n\r\nAnd he staggered from the Morai.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nThey Discourse Of The Gods Of Mardi, And Braid-Beard Tells Of One Foni\r\n\r\n\r\nWalking from the sacred inclosure, Mohi discoursed of the plurality of\r\ngods in the land, a subject suggested by the multitudinous idols we had\r\njust been beholding.\r\n\r\nSaid Mohi, “These gods of wood and of stone are nothing in number to\r\nthe gods in the air. You breathe not a breath without inhaling, you\r\ntouch not a leaf without ruffling a spirit. There are gods of heaven,\r\nand gods of earth; gods of sea and of land; gods of peace and of war;\r\ngods of rook and of fell; gods of ghosts and of thieves; of singers and\r\ndancers; of lean men and of house-thatchers. Gods glance in the eyes of\r\nbirds, and sparkle in the crests of the waves; gods merrily swing in\r\nthe boughs of the trees, and merrily sing in the brook. Gods are here,\r\nand there, and every where; you are never alone for them.”\r\n\r\n“If this be so, Braid-Beard,” said Babbalanja, “our inmost thoughts are\r\noverheard; but not by eaves-droppers. However, my lord, these gods to\r\nwhom he alludes, merely belong to the semi-intelligibles, the divided\r\nunities in unity, thin side of the First Adyta.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?” said Media.\r\n\r\n“Semi-intelligible, say you, philosopher?” cried Mohi. “Then, prithee,\r\nmake it appear so; for what you say, seems gibberish to me.”\r\n\r\n“Babbalanja,” said Media, “no more of your abstrusities; what know you\r\nmortals of us gods and demi-gods? But tell me, Mohi, how many of your\r\ndeities of rock and fen think you there are? Have you no statistical\r\ntable?”\r\n\r\n“My lord, at the lowest computation, there must be at least three\r\nbillion trillion of quintillions.”\r\n\r\n“A mere unit!” said Babbalanja. “Old man, would you express an infinite\r\nnumber? Then take the sum of the follies of Mardi for your\r\nmultiplicand; and for your multiplier, the totality of sublunarians,\r\nthat never have been heard of since they became no more; and the\r\nproduct shall exceed your quintillions, even though all their units\r\nwere nonillions.”\r\n\r\n“Have done, Babbalanja!” cried Media; “you are showing the sinister\r\nvein in your marble. Have done. Take a warm bath, and make tepid your\r\ncold blood. But come, Mohi, tell us of the ways of this Maramma;\r\nsomething of the Morai and its idols, if you please.”\r\n\r\nAnd straightway Braid-Beard proceeded with a narration, in substance as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\nIt seems, there was a particular family upon the island, whose members,\r\nfor many generations, had been set apart as sacrifices for the deity\r\ncalled Doleema. They were marked by a sad and melancholy aspect, and a\r\ncertain involuntary shrinking, when passing the Morai. And, though,\r\nwhen it came to the last, some of these unfortunates went joyfully to\r\ntheir doom, declaring that they gloried to die in the service of holy\r\nDoleema; still, were there others, who audaciously endeavored to shun\r\ntheir fate; upon the approach of a festival, fleeing to the innermost\r\nwilderness of the island. But little availed their flight. For swift on\r\ntheir track sped the hereditary butler of the insulted god, one Xiki,\r\nwhose duty it was to provide the sacrifices. And when crouching in some\r\ncovert, the fugitive spied Xiki’s approach, so fearful did he become of\r\nthe vengeance of the deity he sought to evade, that renouncing all hope\r\nof escape, he would burst from his lair, exclaiming, “Come on, and\r\nkill!” baring his breast for the javelin that slew him.\r\n\r\nThe chronicles of Maramma were full of horrors.\r\n\r\nIn the wild heart of the island, was said still to lurk the remnant of\r\na band of warriors, who, in the days of the sire of the present\r\npontiff, had risen in arms to dethrone him, headed by Foni, an upstart\r\nprophet, a personage distinguished for the uncommon beauty of his\r\nperson. With terrible carnage, these warriors had been defeated; and\r\nthe survivors, fleeing into the interior, for thirty days were pursued\r\nby the victors. But though many were overtaken and speared, a number\r\nsurvived; who, at last, wandering forlorn and in despair, like\r\ndemoniacs, ran wild in the woods. And the islanders, who at times\r\npenetrated into the wilderness, for the purpose of procuring rare\r\nherbs, often scared from their path some specter, glaring through the\r\nfoliage. Thrice had these demoniacs been discovered prowling about the\r\ninhabited portions of the isle; and at day-break, an attendant of the\r\nholy Morai once came upon a frightful figure, doubled with age, helping\r\nitself to the offerings in the image of Doleema. The demoniac was\r\nslain; and from his ineffaceable tatooing, it was proved that this was\r\nno other than Foni, the false prophet; the splendid form he had carried\r\ninto the rebel fight, now squalid with age and misery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nThey Visit The Lake Of Yammo\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Morai, we bent our steps toward an unoccupied arbor; and here,\r\nrefreshing ourselves with the viands presented by Borabolla, we passed\r\nthe night. And next morning proceeded to voyage round to the opposite\r\nquarter of the island; where, in the sacred lake of Yammo, stood the\r\nfamous temple of Oro, also the great gallery of the inferior deities.\r\n\r\nThe lake was but a portion of the smooth lagoon, made separate by an\r\narm of wooded reef, extending from the high western shore of the\r\nisland, and curving round toward a promontory, leaving a narrow channel\r\nto the sea, almost invisible, however, from the land-locked interior.\r\n\r\nIn this lake were many islets, all green with groves. Its main-shore\r\nwas a steep acclivity, with jutting points, each crowned with mossy old\r\naltars of stone, or ruinous temples, darkly reflected in the green,\r\nglassy water; while, from its long line of stately trees, the low\r\nreef-side of the lake looked one verdant bluff.\r\n\r\nGliding in upon Yammo, its many islets greeted us like a little Mardi;\r\nbut ever and anon we started at long lines of phantoms in the water,\r\nreflections of the long line of images on the shore.\r\n\r\nToward the islet of Dolzono we first directed our way; and there we\r\nbeheld the great gallery of the gods; a mighty temple, resting on one\r\nhundred tall pillars of palm, each based, below the surface, on the\r\nburied body of a man; its nave one vista of idols; names carved on\r\ntheir foreheads: Ogre, Tripoo, Indrimarvoki, Parzillo, Vivivi,\r\nJojijojorora, Jorkraki, and innumerable others.\r\n\r\nCrowds of attendants were new-grouping the images.\r\n\r\n“My lord, you behold one of their principal occupations,” said Mohi.\r\n\r\nSaid Media: “I have heard much of the famed image of Mujo, the Nursing\r\nMother;—can you point it out, Braid-Beard?”\r\n\r\n“My lord, when last here, I saw Mujo at the head of this file; but they\r\nmust have removed it; I see it not now.”\r\n\r\n“Do these attendants, then,” said Babbalanja, “so continually\r\nnew-marshal the idols, that visiting the gallery to-day, you are at a\r\nloss to-morrow?”\r\n\r\n“Even so,” said Braid-Beard. “But behold, my lord, this image is Mujo.”\r\n\r\nWe stood before an obelisk-idol, so towering, that gazing at it, we\r\nwere fain to throw back our heads. According to Mohi, winding stairs\r\nled up through its legs; its abdomen a cellar, thick-stored with gourds\r\nof old wine; its head, a hollow dome; in rude alto-relievo, its scores\r\nof hillock-breasts were carved over with legions of baby deities,\r\nfrog-like sprawling; while, within, were secreted whole litters of\r\ninfant idols, there placed, to imbibe divinity from the knots of the\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nAs we stood, a strange subterranean sound was heard, mingled with a\r\ngurgling as of wine being poured. Looking up, we beheld, through\r\narrow-slits and port-holes, three masks, cross-legged seated in the\r\nabdomen, and holding stout wassail. But instantly upon descrying us,\r\nthey vanished deeper into the interior; and presently was heard a\r\nsepulchral chant, and many groans and grievous tribulations.\r\n\r\nPassing on, we came to an image, with a long anaconda-like posterior\r\ndevelopment, wound round and round its own neck.\r\n\r\n“This must be Oloo, the god of Suicides,” said Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mohi, “you perceive, my lord, how he lays violent tail upon\r\nhimself.”\r\n\r\nAt length, the attendants having, in due order, new-deposed the long\r\nlines of sphinxes and griffins, and many limbed images, a band of them,\r\nin long flowing robes, began their morning chant.\r\n\r\n“Awake Rarni! awake Foloona!\r\nAwake unnumbered deities!”\r\n\r\n\r\nWith many similar invocations, to which the images made not the\r\nslightest rejoinder. Not discouraged, however, the attendants now\r\nseparately proceeded to offer up petitions on behalf of various tribes,\r\nretaining them for that purpose.\r\n\r\nOne prayed for abundance of rain, that the yams of Valapee might not\r\nwilt in the ground; another for dry sunshine, as most favorable for the\r\npresent state of the Bread-fruit crop in Mondoldo.\r\n\r\nHearing all this, Babbalanja thus spoke:—“Doubtless, my lord Media,\r\nbesides these petitions we hear, there are ten thousand contradictory\r\nprayers ascending to these idols. But methinks the gods will not jar\r\nthe eternal progression of things, by any hints from below; even were\r\nit possible to satisfy conflicting desires.”\r\n\r\nSaid Yoomy, “But I would pray, nevertheless, Babbalanja; for prayer\r\ndraws us near to our own souls, and purifies our thoughts. Nor will I\r\ngrant that our supplications are altogether in vain.”\r\n\r\nStill wandering among the images, Mohi had much to say, concerning\r\ntheir respective claims to the reverence of the devout.\r\n\r\nFor though, in one way or other, all Mardians bowed to the supremacy of\r\nOro, they were not so unanimous concerning the inferior deities; those\r\nsupposed to be intermediately concerned in sublunary things. Some\r\nnations sacrificed to one god; some to another; each maintaining, that\r\ntheir own god was the most potential.\r\n\r\nObserving that all the images were more or less defaced, Babbalanja\r\nsought the reason.\r\n\r\nTo which, Braid-Beard made answer, that they had been thus defaced by\r\nhostile devotees; who quarreling in the great gallery of the gods, and\r\ngetting beside themselves with rage, often sought to pull down, and\r\ndemolish each other’s favorite idols.\r\n\r\n“But behold,” cried Babbalanja, “there seems not a single image\r\nunmutilated. How is this, old man?”\r\n\r\n“It is thus. While one faction defaces the images of its adversaries,\r\nits own images are in like manner assailed; whence it comes that no\r\nidol escapes.”\r\n\r\n“No more, no more, Braid-Beard,” said Media. “Let us depart, and visit\r\nthe islet, where the god of all these gods is enshrined.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nThey Meet The Pilgrims At The Temple Of Oro\r\n\r\n\r\nDeep, deep, in deep groves, we found the great temple of Oro,\r\nSpreader-of-the-Sky, and deity supreme.\r\n\r\nWhile here we silently stood eyeing this Mardi-renowned image, there\r\nentered the fane a great multitude of its attendants, holding pearl-\r\nshells on their heads, filled with a burning incense. And ranging\r\nthemselves in a crowd round Oro, they began a long-rolling chant, a sea\r\nof sounds; and the thick smoke of their incense went up to the roof.\r\n\r\nAnd now approached Pani and the pilgrims; followed, at a distance, by\r\nthe willful boy.\r\n\r\n“Behold great Oro,” said the guide.\r\n\r\n“We see naught but a cloud,” said the chief Divino.\r\n\r\n“My ears are stunned by the chanting,” said the blind pilgrim.\r\n\r\n“Receive more gifts, oh guide!” cried Fanna the matron. “Oh Oro!\r\ninvisible Oro! I kneel,” slow murmured the sad-eyed maid.\r\n\r\nBut now, a current of air swept aside the eddying incense; and the\r\nwillful boy, all eagerness to behold the image, went hither and\r\nthither; but the gathering of attendants was great; and at last he\r\nexclaimed, “Oh Oro! I can not see thee, for the crowd that stands\r\nbetween thee and me.”\r\n\r\n“Who is this babbler?” cried they with the censers, one and all turning\r\nupon the pilgrims; “let him speak no more; but bow down, and grind the\r\ndust where he stands; and declare himself the vilest creature that\r\ncrawls. So Oro and Alma command.”\r\n\r\n“I feel nothing in me so utterly vile,” said the boy, “and I cringe to\r\nnone. But I would as lief _adore_ your image, as that in my heart, for\r\nboth mean the same; but more, how can I? I love great Oro, though I\r\ncomprehend him not. I marvel at his works, and feel as nothing in his\r\nsight; but because he is thus omnipotent, and I a mortal, it follows\r\nnot that I am vile. Nor so doth he regard me. We do ourselves degrade\r\nourselves, not Oro us. Hath not Oro made me? And therefore am I not\r\nworthy to stand erect before him? Oro is almighty, but no despot. I\r\nwonder; I hope; I love; I weep; I have in me a feeling nigh to fear,\r\nthat is not fear; but wholly vile I am not; nor can we love and cringe.\r\nBut Oro knows my heart, which I can not speak.”\r\n\r\n“Impious boy,” cried they with the censers, “we will offer thee up,\r\nbefore the very image thou contemnest. In the name of Alma, seize him.”\r\n\r\nAnd they bore him away unresisting.\r\n\r\n“Thus perish the ungodly,” said Pani to the shuddering pilgrims.\r\n\r\nAnd they quitted the temple, to journey toward the Peak of Ofo.\r\n\r\n“My soul bursts!” cried Yoomy. “My lord, my lord, let us save the boy.”\r\n\r\n“Speak not,” said Media. “His fate is fixed. Let Mardi stand.”\r\n\r\n“Then let us away from hence, my lord; and join the pilgrims; for, in\r\nthese inland vales, the lost one may be found, perhaps at the very base\r\nof Ofo.”\r\n\r\n“Not there; not there;” cried Babbalanja, “Yillah may have touched\r\nthese shores; but long since she must have fled.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nThey Discourse Of Alma\r\n\r\n\r\nSailing to and fro in the lake, to view its scenery, much discourse\r\ntook place concerning the things we had seen; and far removed from the\r\ncenser-bearers, the sad fate that awaited the boy was now the theme of\r\nall.\r\n\r\nA good deal was then said of Alma, to whom the guide, the pilgrims, and\r\nthe censer-bearers had frequently alluded, as to some paramount\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nCalled upon to reveal what his chronicles said on this theme,\r\nBraid-Beard complied; at great length narrating, what now follows\r\ncondensed.\r\n\r\nAlma, it seems, was an illustrious prophet, and teacher divine; who,\r\nages ago, at long intervals, and in various islands, had appeared to\r\nthe Mardians under the different titles of Brami, Manko, and Alma. Many\r\nthousands of moons had elasped since his last and most memorable\r\navatar, as Alma on the isle of Maramma. Each of his advents had taken\r\nplace in a comparatively dark and benighted age. Hence, it was devoutly\r\nbelieved, that he came to redeem the Mardians from their heathenish\r\nthrall; to instruct them in the ways of truth, virtue, and happiness;\r\nto allure them to good by promises of beatitude hereafter; and to\r\nrestrain them from evil by denunciations of woe. Separated from the\r\nimpurities and corruptions, which in a long series of centuries had\r\nbecome attached to every thing originally uttered by the prophet, the\r\nmaxims, which as Brami he had taught, seemed similar to those\r\ninculcated by Manko. But as Alma, adapting his lessons to the improved\r\ncondition of humanity, the divine prophet had more completely unfolded\r\nhis scheme; as Alma, he had made his last revelation.\r\n\r\nThis narration concluded, Babbalanja mildly observed, “Mohi: without\r\nseeking to accuse you of uttering falsehoods; since what you relate\r\nrests not upon testimony of your own; permit me, to question the\r\nfidelity of your account of Alma. The prophet came to dissipate errors,\r\nyou say; but superadded to many that have survived the past, ten\r\nthousand others have originated in various constructions of the\r\nprinciples of Alma himself. The prophet came to do away all gods but\r\none; but since the days of Alma, the idols of Maramma have more than\r\nquadrupled. The prophet came to make us Mardians more virtuous and\r\nhappy; but along with all previous good, the same wars, crimes, and\r\nmiseries, which existed in Alma’s day, under various modifications are\r\nyet extant. Nay: take from your chronicles, Mohi, the history of those\r\nhorrors, one way or other, resulting from the doings of Alma’s nominal\r\nfollowers, and your chronicles would not so frequently make mention of\r\nblood. The prophet came to guarantee our eternal felicity; but\r\naccording to what is held in Maramma, that felicity rests on so hard a\r\nproviso, that to a thinking mind, but very few of our sinful race may\r\nsecure it. For one, then, I wholly reject your Alma; not so much,\r\nbecause of all that is hard to be understood in his histories; as\r\nbecause of obvious and undeniable things all round us; which, to me,\r\nseem at war with an unreserved faith in his doctrines as promulgated\r\nhere in Maramma. Besides; every thing in this isle strengthens my\r\nincredulity; I never was so thorough a disbeliever as now.”\r\n\r\n“Let the winds be laid,” cried Mohi, “while your rash confession is\r\nbeing made in this sacred lake.”\r\n\r\nSaid Media, “Philosopher; remember the boy, and they that seized him.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! I do indeed remember him. Poor youth! in his agony, how my heart\r\nyearned toward his. But that very prudence which you deny me, my lord,\r\nprevented me from saying aught in his behalf. Have you not observed,\r\nthat until now, when we are completely by ourselves, I have refrained\r\nfrom freely discoursing of what we have seen in this island? Trust me,\r\nmy lord, there is no man, that bears more in mind the necessity of\r\nbeing either a believer or a hypocrite in Maramma, and the imminent\r\nperil of being honest here, than I, Babbalanja. And have I not reason\r\nto be wary, when in my boyhood, my own sire was burnt for his temerity;\r\nand in this very isle? Just Oro! it was done in the name of Alma,—what\r\nwonder then, that, at times, I almost hate that sound. And from those\r\nflames, they devoutly swore he went to others,—horrible fable!”\r\n\r\nSaid Mohi: “Do you deny, then, the everlasting torments?”\r\n\r\n“’Tis not worth a denial. Nor by formally denying it, will I run the\r\nrisk of shaking the faith of, thousands, who in that pious belief find\r\ninfinite consolation for all they suffer in Mardi.”\r\n\r\n“How?” said Media; “are there those who soothe themselves with the\r\nthought of everlasting flames?”\r\n\r\n“One would think so, my lord, since they defend that dogma more\r\nresolutely than any other. Sooner will they yield you the isles of\r\nParadise, than it. And in truth, as liege followers of Alma, they would\r\nseem but right in clinging to it as they do; for, according to all one\r\nhears in Maramma, the great end of the prophet’s mission seems to have\r\nbeen the revealing to us Mardians the existence of horrors, most hard\r\nto escape. But better we were all annihilated, than that one man should\r\nbe damned.”\r\n\r\nRejoined Media: “But think you not, that possibly, Alma may have been\r\nmisconceived? Are you certain that doctrine is his?”\r\n\r\n“I know nothing more than that such is the belief in this land. And in\r\nthese matters, I know not where else to go for information. But, my\r\nlord, had I been living in those days when certain men are said to have\r\nbeen actually possessed by spirits from hell, I had not let slip the\r\nopportunity—as our forefathers did—to cross-question them concerning\r\nthe place they came from.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” said Media, “your Alma’s faith concerns not me: I am a\r\nking, and a demi-god; and leave vulgar torments to the commonality.”\r\n\r\n“But it concerns me,” muttered Mohi; “yet I know not what to think.”\r\n\r\n“For me,” said Yoomy, “I reject it. Could I, I would not believe it. It\r\nis at variance with the dictates of my heart instinctively my heart\r\nturns from it, as a thirsty man from gall.”\r\n\r\n“Hush; say no more,” said Mohi; “again we approach the shore.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nMohi Tells Of One Ravoo, And They Land To Visit Hevaneva, A Flourishing\r\nArtisan\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving seen all worth viewing in Yammo, we departed, to complete the\r\ncircumnavigation of the island, by returning to Uma without reversing\r\nour prows. As we glided along, we passed many objects of interest,\r\nconcerning which, Mohi, as usual, was very diffuse.\r\n\r\nAmong other things pointed out, were certain little altars, like mile-\r\nstones, planted here and there upon bright bluffs, running out into the\r\nlagoon. Dedicated respectively to the guardian spirits of Maramma,\r\nthese altars formed a chain of spiritual defenses; and here were\r\npresumed to stand post the most vigilant of warders; dread Hivohitee,\r\nall by himself, garrisoning the impregnable interior.\r\n\r\nBut these sentries were only subalterns, subject to the beck of the\r\nPontiff; who frequently sent word to them, concerning the duties of\r\ntheir watch. His mandates were intrusted to one Ravoo, the hereditary\r\npontifical messenger; a long-limbed varlet, so swift of foot, that he\r\nwas said to travel like a javelin. “Art thou Ravoo, that thou so pliest\r\nthy legs?” say these islanders, to one encountered in a hurry.\r\n\r\nHivohitee’s postman held no oral communication with the sentries.\r\nDispatched round the island with divers bits of tappa, hieroglyphically\r\nstamped, he merely deposited one upon each altar; superadding a stone,\r\nto keep the missive in its place; and so went his rounds.\r\n\r\nNow, his route lay over hill and over dale, and over many a coral rock;\r\nand to preserve his feet from bruises, he was fain to wear a sort of\r\nbuskin, or boot, fabricated of a durable tappa, made from the thickest\r\nand toughest of fibers. As he never wore his buskins except when he\r\ncarried the mail, Ravoo sorely fretted with his Hessians; though it\r\nwould have been highly imprudent to travel without them. To make the\r\nthing more endurable, therefore, and, at intervals, to cool his heated\r\npedals, he established a series of stopping-places, or stages; at each\r\nof which a fresh pair of buskins, hanging from a tree, were taken down\r\nand vaulted into by the ingenious traveler. Those relays of boots were\r\nexceedingly convenient; next, indeed, to being lifted upon a fresh pair\r\nof legs.\r\n\r\n“Now, to what purpose that anecdote?” demanded Babbalanja of Mohi, who\r\nin substance related it.\r\n\r\n“Marry! ’tis but the simple recital of a fact; and I tell it to\r\nentertain the company.”\r\n\r\n“But has it any meaning you know of?”\r\n\r\n“Thou art wise, find out,” retorted Braid-Beard. “But what comes of\r\nit?” persisted Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n“Beshrew me, this senseless catechising of thine,” replied Mohi;\r\n“naught else, it seems, save a grin or two.”\r\n\r\n“And pray, what may you be driving at, philosopher?” interrupted Media.\r\n\r\n“I am intent upon the essence of things; the mystery that lieth beyond;\r\nthe elements of the tear which much laughter provoketh; that which is\r\nbeneath the seeming; the precious pearl within the shaggy oyster. I\r\nprobe the circle’s center; I seek to evolve the inscrutable.”\r\n\r\n“Seek on; and when aught is found, cry out, that we may run to see.”\r\n\r\n“My lord the king is merry upon me. To him my more subtle cogitations\r\nseem foolishness. But believe me, my lord, there is more to be thought\r\nof than to be seen. There is a world of wonders insphered within the\r\nspontaneous consciousness; or, as old Bardianna hath it, a mystery\r\nwithin the obvious, yet an obviousness within the mystery.”\r\n\r\n“And did I ever deny that?” said Media.\r\n\r\n“As plain as my hand in the dark,” said Mohi.\r\n\r\n“I dreamed a dream,” said Yoomy.\r\n\r\n“They banter me; but enough; I am to blame for discoursing upon the\r\ndeep world wherein I live. I am wrong in seeking to invest sublunary\r\nsounds with celestial sense. Much that is in me is incommunicable by\r\nthis ether we breathe. But I blame ye not.” And wrapping round him his\r\nmantle, Babbalanja retired into its most private folds.\r\n\r\nEre coming in sight of Uma, we put into a little bay, to pay our\r\nrespects to Hevaneva, a famous character there dwelling; who, assisted\r\nby many journeymen, carried on the lucrative business of making idols\r\nfor the surrounding isles.\r\n\r\nKnow ye, that all idols not made in Maramma, and consecrated by\r\nHivohitee; and, what is more, in strings of teeth paid down for to\r\nHevaneva; are of no more account, than logs, stocks, or stones. Yet\r\ndoes not the cunning artificer monopolize the profits of his vocation;\r\nfor Hevaneva being but the vassal of the Pontiff, the latter lays claim\r\nto King Leo’s share of the spoils, and secures it.\r\n\r\nThe place was very prettily lapped in a pleasant dell, nigh to the\r\nmargin of the water; and here, were several spacious arbors; wherein,\r\nprostrate upon their sacred faces, were all manner of idols, in every\r\nimaginable stage of statuary development.\r\n\r\nWith wonderful industry the journeymen were plying their tools;—some\r\nchiseling noses; some trenching for mouths; and others, with heated\r\nflints, boring for ears: a hole drilled straight through the occiput,\r\nrepresenting the auricular organs.\r\n\r\n“How easily they are seen through,” said Babbalanja, taking a sight\r\nthrough one of the heads.\r\n\r\nThe last finish is given to their godships, by rubbing them all over\r\nwith dried slips of consecrated shark-skin, rough as sand paper, tacked\r\nover bits of wood.\r\n\r\nIn one of the farther arbors, Hevaneva pointed out a goodly array of\r\nidols, all complete and ready for the market. They were of every\r\nvariety of pattern; and of every size; from that of a giant, to the\r\nlittle images worn in the ears of the ultra devout.\r\n\r\n“Of late,” said the artist, “there has been a lively demand for the\r\nimage of Arbino the god of fishing; the present being the principal\r\nseason for that business. For Nadams (Nadam presides over love and\r\nwine), there has also been urgent call; it being the time of the grape;\r\nand the maidens growing frolicsome withal, and devotional.”\r\n\r\nSeeing that Hevaneva handled his wares with much familiarity, not to\r\nsay irreverence, Babbalanja was minded to learn from him, what he\r\nthought of his trade; whether the images he made were genuine or\r\nspurious; in a word, whether he believed in his gods.\r\n\r\nHis reply was curious. But still more so, the marginal gestures\r\nwherewith he helped out the text.\r\n\r\n“When I cut down the trees for my idols,” said he, “they are nothing\r\nbut logs; when upon those logs, I chalk out the figures of, my images,\r\nthey yet remain logs; when the chisel is applied, logs they are still;\r\nand when all complete, I at last stand them up in my studio, even then\r\nthey are logs. Nevertheless, when I handle the pay, they are as prime\r\ngods, as ever were turned out in Maramma.”\r\n\r\n“You must make a very great variety,” said Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n“All sorts, all sorts.”\r\n\r\n“And from the same material, I presume.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay, one grove supplies them all. And, on an average, each tree\r\nstands us in full fifty idols. Then, we often take second-hand images\r\nin part pay for new ones. These we work over again into new patterns;\r\ntouching up their eyes and ears; resetting their noses; and more\r\nespecially new-footing their legs, where they always decay first.”\r\n\r\nUnder sanction of the Pontiff, Hevaneva, in addition to his large\r\ncommerce in idols, also carried on the highly lucrative business of\r\ncanoe-building; the profits whereof, undivided, he dropped into his\r\nprivate exchequer. But Mohi averred, that the Pontiff often charged him\r\nwith neglecting his images, for his canoes. Be that as it may, Hevaneva\r\ndrove a thriving trade at both avocations. And in demonstration of the\r\nfact, he directed our attention to three long rows of canoes, upheld by\r\nwooden supports. They were in perfect order; at a moment’s notice,\r\nready for launching; being furnished with paddles, out-riggers, masts,\r\nsails, and a human skull, with a short handle thrust through one of its\r\neyes, the ordinary bailer of Maramma; besides other appurtenances,\r\nincluding on the prow a duodecimo idol to match.\r\n\r\nOwing to a superstitious preference bestowed upon the wood and work of\r\nthe sacred island, Hevaneva’s canoes were in as high repute as his\r\nidols; and sold equally well.\r\n\r\nIn truth, in several ways one trade helped the other. The larger images\r\nbeing dug out of the hollow part of the canoes; and all knotty odds and\r\nends reserved for the idol ear-rings.\r\n\r\n“But after all,” said the artificer, “I find a readier sale for my\r\nimages, than for my canoes.”\r\n\r\n“And so it will ever be,” said Babbalanja.—“Stick to thy idols, man! a\r\ntrade, more reliable than the baker’s.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nA Nursery-Tale Of Babbalanja’s\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving taken to our canoes once again, we were silently sailing along,\r\nwhen Media observed, “Babbalanja; though I seldom trouble myself with\r\nsuch thoughts, I have just been thinking, how difficult it must be, for\r\nthe more ignorant sort of people, to decide upon what particular image\r\nto worship as a guardian deity, when in Maramma, it seems, there exists\r\nsuch a multitude of idols, and a thousand more are to be heard of.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all, your highness. The more ignorant the better. The multitude\r\nof images distracts them not. But I am in no mood for serious\r\ndiscourse; let me tell you a story.”\r\n\r\n“A story! hear him: the solemn philosopher is desirous of regaling us\r\nwith a tale! But pray, begin.”\r\n\r\n“Once upon a time, then,” said Babbalanja, indifferently adjusting his\r\ngirdle, “nine blind men, with uncommonly long noses, set out on their\r\ntravels to see the great island on which they were born.”\r\n\r\n“A precious beginning,” muttered Mohi. “Nine blind men setting out to\r\nsee sights.”\r\n\r\nContinued Babbalanja, “Staff in hand, they traveled; one in advance of\r\nthe other; each man with his palm upon the shoulder next him; and he\r\nwith the longest nose took the lead of the file. Journeying on in this\r\nmanner, they came to a valley, in which reigned a king called Tammaro.\r\nNow, in a certain inclosure toward the head of the valley, there stood\r\nan immense wild banian tree; all over moss, and many centuries old, and\r\nforming quite a wood in itself: its thousand boughs striking into the\r\nearth, and fixing there as many gigantic trunks. With Tammaro, it had\r\nlong been a question, which of those many trunks was the original and\r\ntrue one; a matter that had puzzled the wisest heads among his\r\nsubjects; and in vain had a reward been offered for the solution of the\r\nperplexity. But the tree was so vast, and its fabric so complex; and\r\nits rooted branches so similar in appearance; and so numerous, from the\r\ncircumstance that every year had added to them, that it was quite\r\nimpossible to determine the point. Nevertheless, no sooner did the nine\r\nblind men hear that there was a reward offered for discovering the\r\ntrunk of a tree, standing all by itself, than, one and all, they\r\nassured Tammaro, that they would quickly settle that little difficulty\r\nof his; and loudly inveighed against the stupidity of his sages, who\r\nhad been so easily posed. So, being conducted into the inclosure, and\r\nassured that the tree was somewhere within, they separated their\r\nforces, so as at wide intervals to surround it at a distance; when\r\nfeeling their way, with their staves and their noses, they advanced to\r\nthe search, crying out—‘Pshaw! make room there; let us wise men feel of\r\nthe mystery.’ Presently, striking with his nose one of the rooted\r\nbranches, the foremost blind man quickly knelt down; and feeling that\r\nit struck into the earth, gleefully shouted: Here it is! here it is!’\r\nBut almost in the same breath, his companions, also, each striking a\r\nbranch with his staff or his nose, cried out in like manner, ‘Here it\r\nis! here it is!’ Whereupon they were all confounded: but directly, the\r\nman who first cried out, thus addressed the rest: Good friends, surely\r\nyou’re mistaken. There is but one tree in the place, and here it is.’\r\n‘Very true,’ said the others, ‘all together; there is only _one_ tree;\r\nbut _here_ it is.’ ‘Nay,’ said the others, ‘it is _here!_’ and so\r\nsaying, each blind man triumphantly felt of the branch, where it\r\npenetrated into the earth. Then again said the first speaker: Good\r\nfriends, if you will not believe what I say, come hither, and feel for\r\nyourselves.’ ‘Nay, nay,’ replied they, why seek further? _here_ it is;\r\nand nowhere else can it be.’ ‘You blind fools, you, you contradict\r\nyourselves,’ continued the first speaker, waxing wroth; ‘how can you\r\neach have hold of a separate trunk, when there is but one in the\r\nplace?’ Whereupon, they redoubled their cries, calling each other all\r\nmanner of opprobrious names, and presently they fell to beating each\r\nother with their staves, and charging upon each other with their noses.\r\nBut soon after, being loudly called upon by Tammaro and his people; who\r\nall this while had been looking on; being loudly called upon, I say, to\r\nclap their hands on the trunk, they again rushed for their respective\r\nbranches; and it so happened, that, one and all, they changed places;\r\nbut still cried out, ‘_Here_ it is; _here_ it is!’ ‘Peace! peace! ye\r\nsilly blind men,’ said Tammaro. ‘Will ye without eyes presume to see\r\nmore sharply than those who have them? The tree is too much for us all.\r\nHence! depart from the valley.’”\r\n\r\n“An admirable story,” cried Media. “I had no idea that a mere mortal,\r\nleast of all a philosopher, could acquit himself so well. By my\r\nscepter, but it is well done! Ha, ha! blind men round a banian! Why,\r\nBabbalanja, no demi-god could surpass it. Taji, could you?”\r\n\r\n“But, Babbalanja, what under the sun, mean you by your blind story!”\r\ncried Mohi. “Obverse, or reverse, I can make nothing out of it.”\r\n\r\n“Others may,” said Babbalanja. “It is a polysensuum, old man.”\r\n\r\n“A pollywog!” said Mohi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nLanding To Visit Hivohitee The Pontiff, They Encounter An Extraordinary\r\nOld Hermit; With Whom Yoomy Has A Confidential Interview, But Learns\r\nLittle\r\n\r\n\r\nGliding on, suddenly we spied a solitary Islander putting out in his\r\ncanoe from a neighboring cove.\r\n\r\nDrawing near, the stranger informed us, that he was just from the face\r\nof the great Pontiff, Hivohitee, who, having dismissed his celestial\r\nguests, had retired to his private sanctuary. Upon this, Media resolved\r\nto land forthwith, and under the guidance of Mohi, proceed inland, and\r\npay a visit to his Holiness.\r\n\r\nQuitting the beach, our path penetrated into the solitudes of the\r\ngroves. Skirting the way were tall Casaurinas, a species of cypress,\r\nstanding motionless in the shadows, as files of mutes at a funeral. But\r\nhere and there, they were overrun with the adventurous vines of the\r\nConvolvulus, the Morning-glory of the Tropics, whose tendrils, bruised\r\nby the twigs, dropped milk upon the dragon-like scales of the trees.\r\n\r\nThis vine is of many varieties. Lying perdu, and shunning the garish\r\nsun through the day, one species rises at night with the stars;\r\nbursting forth in dazzling constellations of blossoms, which close at\r\ndawn. Others, slumbering through the darkness, are up and abroad with\r\ntheir petals, by peep of morn; and after inhaling its breath, again\r\ndrop their lids in repose. While a third species, more capricious,\r\nrefuse to expand at all, unless in the most brilliant sunshine, and\r\nupon the very tops of the loftiest trees. Ambitious flowers! that will\r\nnot blow, unless in high places, with the bright day looking on and\r\nadmiring.\r\n\r\nHere and there, we passed open glades in the woods, delicious with the\r\nincense of violets. Balsamic ferns, stirred by the breeze, fanned all\r\nthe air with aromas. These glades were delightful.\r\n\r\nJourneying on, we at length came to a dark glen so deftly hidden by the\r\nsurrounding copses, that were it not for the miasma thence wafted, an\r\nignorant wayfarer might pass and repass it, time and again, never\r\ndreaming of its vicinity.\r\n\r\nDown into the gloom of this glen we descended. Its sides were mantled\r\nwith noxious shrubs, whose exhalations, half way down, unpleasantly\r\nblended with the piny breeze from the uplands. Through its bed ran a\r\nbrook, whose incrusted margin had a strange metallic luster, from the\r\npolluted waters here flowing; their source a sulphur spring, of vile\r\nflavor and odor, where many invalid pilgrims resorted.\r\n\r\nThe woods all round were haunted by the dismal cawings of crows; tap,\r\ntap, the black hawk whetted his bill on the boughs; each trunk stalked\r\na ghost; and from those trunks, Hevaneva procured the wood for his\r\nidols.\r\n\r\nRapidly crossing this place, Yoomy’s hands to his ears, old Mohi’s to\r\nhis nostrils, and Babbalanja vainly trying to walk with closed eyes, we\r\ntoiled among steep, flinty rocks, along a wild, zigzag pathway; like a\r\nmule-track in the Andes, not so much onward as upward; Yoomy above\r\nBabbalanja, my lord Media above him, and Braid-Beard, our guide, in the\r\nair, above all.\r\n\r\nStrown over with cinders, the vitreous marl seemed tumbled together, as\r\nif belched from a volcano’s throat.\r\n\r\nPresently, we came to a tall, slender structure, hidden among the\r\nscenic projections of the cliffs, like a monument in the dark, vaulted\r\nways of an abbey. Surrounding it, were five extinct craters. The air\r\nwas sultry and still, as if full of spent thunderbolts.\r\n\r\nLike a Hindoo pagoda, this bamboo edifice rose story above story; its\r\nmany angles and points decorated with pearl-shells suspended by cords.\r\nBut the uppermost story, some ten toises in the air, was closely\r\nthatched from apex to floor; which summit was gained by a series of\r\nascents.\r\n\r\nWhat eremite dwelleth here, like St. Stylites at the top of his\r\ncolumn?—a question which Mohi seemed all eagerness to have answered.\r\n\r\nDropping upon his knees, he gave a peculiar low call: no response.\r\nAnother: all was silent. Marching up to the pagoda, and again dropping\r\nupon his knees, he shook the bamboos till the edifice rocked, and its\r\npearl-shells jingled, as if a troop of Andalusian mules, with bells\r\nround their necks, were galloping along the defile.\r\n\r\nAt length the thatch aloft was thrown open, and a head was thrust\r\nforth. It was that of an old, old man; with steel-gray eyes, hair and\r\nbeard, and a horrible necklace of jaw-bones.\r\n\r\nNow, issuing from the pagoda, Mohi turned about to gain a view of the\r\nghost he had raised; and no sooner did he behold it, than with King\r\nMedia and the rest, he made a marked salutation.\r\n\r\nPresently, the eremite pointed to where Yoomy was standing; and waved\r\nhis hand upward; when Mohi informed the minstrel, that it was St.\r\nStylites’ pleasure, that he should pay him a visit.\r\n\r\nWondering what was to come, Yoomy proceeded to mount; and at last\r\narriving toward the top of the pagoda, was met by an opening, from\r\nwhich an encouraging arm assisted him to gain the ultimate landing.\r\n\r\nHere, all was murky enough; for the aperture from which the head of the\r\napparition had been thrust, was now closed; and what little twilight\r\nthere was, came up through the opening in the floor.\r\n\r\nIn this dismal seclusion, silently the hermit confronted the minstrel;\r\nhis gray hair, eyes, and beard all gleaming, as if streaked with\r\nphosphorus; while his ghastly gorget grinned hideously, with all its\r\njaws.\r\n\r\nMutely Yoomy waited to be addressed; but hearing no sound, and becoming\r\nalive to the strangeness of his situation, he meditated whether it\r\nwould not be well to subside out of sight, even as he had come—through\r\nthe floor. An intention which the eremite must have anticipated; for of\r\na sudden, something was slid over the opening; and the apparition\r\nseating itself thereupon, the twain were in darkness complete.\r\n\r\nShut up thus, with an inscrutable stranger posted at the only aperture\r\nof escape, poor Yoomy fell into something like a panic; hardly knowing\r\nwhat step to take next. As for endeavoring to force his way out, it was\r\nalarming to think of; for aught he knew, the eremite, availing himself\r\nof the gloom, might be bristling all over with javelin points.\r\n\r\nAt last, the silence was broken.\r\n\r\n“What see you, mortal?”\r\n\r\n“Chiefly darkness,” said Yoomy, wondering at the audacity of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n“I dwell in it. But what else see you, mortal?”\r\n\r\n“The dim gleaming of thy gorget.”\r\n\r\n“But that is not me. What else dost thou see?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Then thou hast found me out, and seen all! Descend.”\r\n\r\nAnd with that, the passage-way opened, and groping through the\r\ntwilight, Yoomy obeyed the mandate, and retreated; full of vexation at\r\nhis enigmatical reception.\r\n\r\nOn his alighting, Mohi inquired whether the hermit was not a wonderful\r\npersonage.\r\n\r\nBut thinking some sage waggery lurked in the question; and at present\r\ntoo indignant to enter into details, the minstrel made some impatient\r\nreply; and winding through a defile, the party resumed its journey.\r\n\r\nStraggling behind, to survey the strange plants and flowers in his\r\npath, Yoomy became so absorbed, as almost to forget the scene in the\r\npagoda; yet every moment expected to be nearing the stately abode of\r\nthe Pontiff.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly, the scene around grew familiar; the path seemed that\r\nwhich had been followed just after leaving the canoes; and at length,\r\nthe place of debarkation was in sight.\r\n\r\nSurprised that the object of our visit should have been thus abandoned,\r\nthe minstrel ran forward, and sought an explanation.\r\n\r\nWhereupon, Mohi lifted his hands in amazement; exclaiming at the\r\nblindness of the eyes, which had beheld the supreme Pontiff of Maramma,\r\nwithout knowing it.\r\n\r\nThe old hermit was no other than the dread Hivohitee; the pagoda, the\r\ninmost oracle of the isle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nBabbalanja Endeavors To Explain The Mystery\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Great Mogul of a personage, then; this woundy Aliasuerus; this man\r\nof men; this same Hivohitee, whose name rumbled among the mountains\r\nlike a peal of thunder, had been seen face to face, and taken for\r\nnaught, but a bearded old hermit, or at best, some equivocal conjuror.\r\n\r\nSo great was his wonderment at the time, that Yoomy could not avoid\r\nexpressing it in words.\r\n\r\nWhereupon thus discoursed Babbalanja:\r\n\r\n“Gentle Yoomy, be not astounded, that Hivohitee is so far behind your\r\nprevious conceptions. The shadows of things are greater than\r\nthemselves; and the more exaggerated the shadow, the more unlike to the\r\nsubstance.”\r\n\r\n“But knowing now, what manner of person Hivohitee is,” said Yoomy,\r\n“much do I long to behold him again.”\r\n\r\nBut Mohi assured him it was out of the question; that the Pontiff\r\nalways acted toward strangers as toward him (Yoomy); and that but one\r\ndim blink at the eremite was all that mortal could obtain.\r\n\r\nDebarred thus from a second and more satisfactory interview with one,\r\nconcerning whom his curiosity had been violently aroused, the minstrel\r\nagain turned to Mohi for enlightenment; especially touching that\r\nmagnate’s Egyptian reception of him in his aerial den.\r\n\r\nWhereto, the chronicler made answer, that the Pontiff affected darkness\r\nbecause he liked it: that he was a ruler of few words, but many deeds;\r\nand that, had Yoomy been permitted to tarry longer with him in the\r\npagoda, he would have been privy to many strange attestations of the\r\ndivinity imputed to him. Voices would have been heard in the air,\r\ngossiping with Hivohitee; noises inexplicable proceeding from him; in\r\nbrief, light would have flashed out of his darkness.\r\n\r\n“But who has seen these things, Mohi?” said Babbalanja, “have you?”\r\n\r\n“Nay.”\r\n\r\n“Who then?—Media?—Any one you know?”\r\n\r\n“Nay: but the whole Archipelago has.”\r\n\r\n“Thus,” exclaimed Babbalanja, “does Mardi, blind though it be in many\r\nthings, collectively behold the marvels, which one pair of eyes sees\r\nnot.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nTaji Receives Tidings And Omens\r\n\r\n\r\nSlowly sailing on, we were overtaken by a shallop; whose inmates\r\ngrappling to the side of Media’s, said they came from Borabolla.\r\n\r\nDismal tidings!—My faithful follower’s death.\r\n\r\nAbsent over night, that morning early, he had been discovered lifeless\r\nin the woods, three arrows in his heart. And the three pale strangers\r\nwere nowhere to be found. But a fleet canoe was missing from the beach.\r\n\r\nSlain for me! my soul sobbed out. Nor yet appeased Aleema’s manes; nor\r\nyet seemed sated the avengers’ malice; who, doubtless, were on my\r\ntrack.\r\n\r\nBut I turned; and instantly the three canoes had been reversed; and\r\nfull soon, Jarl’s dead hand in mine, had not Media interposed.\r\n\r\n“To death, your presence will not bring life back.”\r\n\r\n“And we must on,” said Babbalanja. “We seek the living, not the dead.”\r\n\r\nThus they overruled me; and Borabolla’s messengers departed.\r\n\r\nSoon evening came, and in its shades, three shadows,—Hautia’s heralds.\r\n\r\nTheir shallop glided near.\r\n\r\nA leaf tri-foiled was first presented; then another, arrow-shaped.\r\n\r\nSaid Yoomy, “Still I swiftly follow, behind revenge.”\r\n\r\nThen were showered faded, pallid daffodils.\r\n\r\nSaid Yoomy, “Thy hopes are blighted all.”\r\n\r\n“Not dead, but living with the life of life. Sirens! I heed ye not.”\r\n\r\nThey would have showered more flowers; but crowding sail we left them.\r\n\r\nMuch converse followed. Then, beneath the canopy all sought repose. And\r\nere long slouched sleep drew nigh, tending dreams innumerable; silent\r\ndotting all the downs a shepherd with his flock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nDreams\r\n\r\n\r\nDreams! dreams! golden dreams: endless, and golden, as the flowery\r\nprairies, that stretch away from the Rio Sacramento, in whose waters\r\nDanae’s shower was woven;—prairies like rounded eternities: jonquil\r\nleaves beaten out; and my dreams herd like buffaloes, browsing on to\r\nthe horizon, and browsing on round the world; and among them, I dash\r\nwith my lance, to spear one, ere they all flee.\r\n\r\nDreams! dreams! passing and repassing, like Oriental empires in\r\nhistory; and scepters wave thick, as Bruce’s pikes at Bannockburn; and\r\ncrowns are plenty as marigolds in June. And far in the background, hazy\r\nand blue, their steeps let down from the sky, loom Andes on Andes,\r\nrooted on Alps; and all round me, long rushing oceans, roll Amazons and\r\nOronocos; waves, mounted Parthians; and, to and fro, toss the wide\r\nwoodlands: all the world an elk, and the forests its antlers.\r\n\r\nBut far to the South, past my Sicily suns and my vineyards, stretches\r\nthe Antarctic barrier of ice: a China wall, built up from the sea, and\r\nnodding its frosted towers in the dun, clouded sky. Do Tartary and\r\nSiberia lie beyond? Deathful, desolate dominions those; bleak and wild\r\nthe ocean, beating at that barrier’s base, hovering ’twixt freezing and\r\nfoaming; and freighted with navies of ice-bergs,—warring worlds\r\ncrossing orbits; their long icicles, projecting like spears to the\r\ncharge. Wide away stream the floes of drift ice, frozen cemeteries of\r\nskeletons and bones. White bears howl as they drift from their cubs;\r\nand the grinding islands crush the skulls of the peering seals.\r\n\r\nBut beneath me, at the Equator, the earth pulses and beats like a\r\nwarrior’s heart; till I know not, whether it be not myself. And my soul\r\nsinks down to the depths, and soars to the skies; and comet-like reels\r\non through such boundless expanses, that methinks all the worlds are my\r\nkin, and I invoke them to stay in their course. Yet, like a mighty\r\nthree-decker, towing argosies by scores, I tremble, gasp, and strain in\r\nmy flight, and fain would cast off the cables that hamper.\r\n\r\nAnd like a frigate, I am full with a thousand souls; and as on, on, on,\r\nI scud before the wind, many mariners rush up from the orlop below,\r\nlike miners from caves; running shouting across my decks; opposite\r\nbraces are pulled; and this way and that, the great yards swing round\r\non their axes; and boisterous speaking-trumpets are heard; and\r\ncontending orders, to save the good ship from the shoals. Shoals, like\r\nnebulous vapors, shoreing the white reef of the Milky Way, against\r\nwhich the wrecked worlds are dashed; strewing all the strand, with\r\ntheir Himmaleh keels and ribs.\r\n\r\nAy: many, many souls are in me. In my tropical calms, when my ship lies\r\ntranced on Eternity’s main, speaking one at a time, then all with one\r\nvoice: an orchestra of many French bugles and horns, rising, and\r\nfalling, and swaying, in golden calls and responses.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when these Atlantics and Pacifics thus undulate round me, I\r\nlie stretched out in their midst: a land-locked Mediterranean, knowing\r\nno ebb, nor flow. Then again, I am dashed in the spray of these sounds:\r\nan eagle at the world’s end, tossed skyward, on the horns of the\r\ntempest.\r\n\r\nYet, again, I descend, and list to the concert.\r\n\r\nLike a grand, ground swell, Homer’s old organ rolls its vast volumes\r\nunder the light frothy wave-crests of Anacreon and Hafiz; and high over\r\nmy ocean, sweet Shakespeare soars, like all the larks of the spring.\r\nThroned on my seaside, like Canute, bearded Ossian smites his hoar\r\nharp, wreathed with wild-flowers, in which warble my Wallers; blind\r\nMilton sings bass to my Petrarchs and Priors, and laureate crown me\r\nwith bays.\r\n\r\nIn me, many worthies recline, and converse. I list to St. Paul who\r\nargues the doubts of Montaigne; Julian the Apostate cross-questions\r\nAugustine; and Thomas-a-Kempis unrolls his old black letters for all to\r\ndecipher. Zeno murmurs maxims beneath the hoarse shout of Democritus;\r\nand though Democritus laugh loud and long, and the sneer of Pyrrho be\r\nseen; yet, divine Plato, and Proclus, and, Verulam are of my counsel;\r\nand Zoroaster whispered me before I was born. I walk a world that is\r\nmine; and enter many nations, as Mingo Park rested in African cots; I\r\nam served like Bajazet: Bacchus my butler, Virgil my minstrel, Philip\r\nSidney my page. My memory is a life beyond birth; my memory, my library\r\nof the Vatican, its alcoves all endless perspectives, eve-tinted by\r\ncross-lights from Middle-Age oriels.\r\n\r\nAnd as the great Mississippi musters his watery nations: Ohio, with all\r\nhis leagued streams; Missouri, bringing down in torrents the clans from\r\nthe highlands; Arkansas, his Tartar rivers from the plain;—so, with all\r\nthe past and present pouring in me, I roll down my billow from afar.\r\n\r\nYet not I, but another: God is my Lord; and though many satellites\r\nrevolve around me, I and all mine revolve round the great central\r\nTruth, sun-like, fixed and luminous forever in the foundationless\r\nfirmament.\r\n\r\nFire flames on my tongue; and though of old the Bactrian prophets were\r\nstoned, yet the stoners in oblivion sleep. But whoso stones me, shall\r\nbe as Erostratus, who put torch to the temple; though Genghis Khan with\r\nCambyses combine to obliterate him, his name shall be extant in the\r\nmouth of the last man that lives. And if so be, down unto death, whence\r\nI came, will I go, like Xenophon retreating on Greece, all Persia\r\nbrandishing her spears in his rear.\r\n\r\nMy cheek blanches white while I write; I start at the scratch of my\r\npen; my own mad brood of eagles devours me; fain would I unsay this\r\naudacity; but an iron-mailed hand clenches mine in a vice, and prints\r\ndown every letter in my spite. Fain would I hurl off this Dionysius\r\nthat rides me; my thoughts crush me down till I groan; in far fields I\r\nhear the song of the reaper, while I slave and faint in this cell. The\r\nfever runs through me like lava; my hot brain burns like a coal; and\r\nlike many a monarch, I am less to be envied, than the veriest hind in\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nMedia And Babbalanja Discourse\r\n\r\n\r\nOur visiting the Pontiff at a time previously unforeseen, somewhat\r\naltered our plans. All search in Maramma for the lost one proving\r\nfruitless, and nothing of note remaining to be seen, we returned not to\r\nUma; but proceeded with the tour of the lagoon.\r\n\r\nWhen day came, reclining beneath the canopy, Babbalanja would fain have\r\nseriously discussed those things we had lately been seeing, which, for\r\nall the occasional levity he had recently evinced, seemed very near his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nBut my lord Media forbade; saying that they necessarily included a\r\ntopic which all gay, sensible Mardians, who desired to live and be\r\nmerry, invariably banished from social discourse.\r\n\r\n“Meditate as much as you will, Babbalanja, but say little aloud, unless\r\nin a merry and mythical way. Lay down the great maxims of things, but\r\nlet inferences take care of themselves. Never be special; never, a\r\npartisan. In safety, afar off, you may batter down a fortress; but at\r\nyour peril you essay to carry a single turret by escalade. And if\r\ndoubts distract you, in vain will you seek sympathy from your fellow\r\nmen. For upon this one theme, not a few of you free-minded mortals,\r\neven the otherwise honest and intelligent, are the least frank and\r\nfriendly. Discourse with them, and it is mostly formulas, or\r\nprevarications, or hollow assumption of philosophical indifference, or\r\nurbane hypocrisies, or a cool, civil deference to the dominant belief;\r\nor still worse, but less common, a brutality of indiscriminate\r\nskepticism. Furthermore, Babbalanja, on this head, final, last thoughts\r\nyou mortals have none; nor can have; and, at bottom, your own fleeting\r\nfancies are too often secrets to yourselves; and sooner may you get\r\nanother’s secret, than your own. Thus with the wisest of you all; you\r\nare ever unfixed. Do you show a tropical calm without? then, be sure a\r\nthousand contrary currents whirl and eddy within. The free, airy robe\r\nof your philosophy is but a dream, which seems true while it lasts; but\r\nwaking again into the orthodox world, straightway you resume the old\r\nhabit. And though in your dreams you may hie to the uttermost Orient,\r\nyet all the while you abide where you are. Babbalanja, you mortals\r\ndwell in Mardi, and it is impossible to get elsewhere.”\r\n\r\nSaid Babbalanja, “My lord, you school me. But though I dissent from\r\nsome of your positions, I am willing to confess, that this is not the\r\nfirst time a philosopher has been instructed by a man.”\r\n\r\n“A demi-god, sir; and therefore I the more readily discharge my mind of\r\nall seriousness, touching the subject, with which you mortals so vex\r\nand torment yourselves.”\r\n\r\nSilence ensued. And seated apart, on both sides of the barge, solemnly\r\nswaying, in fixed meditation, to the roll of the waves, Babbalanja,\r\nMohi, and Yoomy, drooped lower and lower, like funeral plumes; and our\r\ngloomy canoe seemed a hearse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nThey Regale Themselves With Their Pipes\r\n\r\n\r\n“Ho! mortals! mortals!” cried Media. “Go we to bury our dead? Awake,\r\nsons of men! Cheer up, heirs of immortality! Ho, Vee-Vee! bring forth\r\nour pipes: we’ll smoke off this cloud.”\r\n\r\nNothing so beguiling as the fumes of tobacco, whether inhaled through\r\nhookah, narghil, chibouque, Dutch porcelain, pure Principe, or Regalia.\r\nAnd a great oversight had it been in King Media, to have omitted pipes\r\namong the appliances of this voyage that we went. Tobacco in rouleaus\r\nwe had none; cigar nor cigarret; which little the company esteemed.\r\nPipes were preferred; and pipes we often smoked; testify, oh! Vee-Vee,\r\nto that. But not of the vile clay, of which mankind and Etruscan vases\r\nwere made, were these jolly fine pipes of ours. But all in good time.\r\n\r\nNow, the leaf called tobacco is of divers species and sorts. Not to\r\ndwell upon vile Shag, Pig-tail, Plug, Nail-rod, Negro-head, Cavendish,\r\nand misnamed Lady’s-twist, there are the following varieties:—Gold-\r\nleaf, Oronoco, Cimaroza, Smyrna, Bird’s-eye, James-river,\r\nSweet-scented, Honey-dew, Kentucky, Cnaster, Scarfalati, and famed\r\nShiraz, or Persian. Of all of which, perhaps the last is the best.\r\n\r\nBut smoked by itself, to a fastidious wight, even Shiraz is not gentle\r\nenough. It needs mitigation. And the cunning craft of so mitigating\r\neven the mildest tobacco was well understood in the dominions of Media.\r\nThere, in plantations ever covered with a brooding, blue haze, they\r\nraised its fine leaf in the utmost luxuriance; almost as broad as the\r\nbroad fans of the broad-bladed banana. The stalks of the leaf\r\nwithdrawn, the remainder they cut up, and mixed with soft willow-bark,\r\nand the aromatic leaves of the Betel.\r\n\r\n“Ho! Vee-Vee, bring forth the pipes,” cried Media. And forth they came,\r\nfollowed by a quaint, carved cocoa-nut, agate-lidded, containing\r\nammunition sufficient for many stout charges and primings.\r\n\r\nSoon we were all smoking so hard, that the canopied howdah, under which\r\nwe reclined, sent up purple wreaths like a Michigan wigwam. There we\r\nsat in a ring, all smoking in council—every pipe a halcyon pipe of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nAnd among those calumets, my lord Media’s showed like the turbaned\r\nGrand Turk among his Bashaws. It was an extraordinary pipe, be sure; of\r\nright royal dimensions. Its mouth-piece an eagle’s beak; its long stem,\r\na bright, red-barked cherry-tree branch, partly covered with a close\r\nnetwork of purple dyed porcupine quills; and toward the upper end,\r\nstreaming with pennons, like a Versailles flag-staff of a coronation\r\nday. These pennons were managed by halyards; and after lighting his\r\nprince’s pipe, it was little Vee-Vee’s part to run them up toward the\r\nmast-head, or mouthpiece, in token that his lord was fairly under\r\nweigh.\r\n\r\nBut Babbalanja’s was of a different sort; an immense, black, serpentine\r\nstem of ebony, coiling this way and that, in endless convolutions, like\r\nan anaconda round a traveler in Brazil. Smoking this hydra, Babbalanja\r\nlooked as if playing upon the trombone.\r\n\r\nNext, gentle Yoomy’s. Its stem, a slender golden reed, like musical\r\nPan’s; its bowl very merry with tassels.\r\n\r\nLastly, old Mohi the chronicler’s. Its Death’s-head bowl forming its\r\nlatter end, continually reminding him of his own. Its shank was an\r\nostrich’s leg, some feathers still waving nigh the mouth-piece.\r\n\r\n“Here, Vee-Vee! fill me up again,” cried Media, through the blue vapors\r\nsweeping round his great gonfalon, like plumed Marshal Ney, waving his\r\nbaton in the smoke of Waterloo; or thrice gallant Anglesea, crossing\r\nhis wooden leg mid the reek and rack of the Apsley House banquet.\r\n\r\nVee-Vee obeyed; and quickly, like a howitzer, the pipe-owl was reloaded\r\nto the muzzle, and King Media smoked on.\r\n\r\n“Ah! this is pleasant indeed,” he cried. “Look, it’s a calm on the\r\nwaters, and a calm in our hearts, as we inhale these sedative odors.”\r\n\r\n“So calm,” said Babbalanja; “the very gods must be smoking now.”\r\n\r\n“And thus,” said Media, “we demi-gods hereafter shall cross-legged sit,\r\nand smoke out our eternities. Ah, what a glorious puff! Mortals,\r\nmethinks these pipe-bowls of ours must be petrifactions of roses, so\r\nscented they seem. But, old Mohi, you have smoked this many a long\r\nyear; doubtless, you know something about their material—the\r\nFroth-of-the-Sea they call it, I think—ere my handicraft subjects\r\nobtain it, to work into bowls. Tell us the tale.”\r\n\r\n“Delighted to do so, my lord,” replied Mohi, slowly disentangling his\r\nmouth-piece from the braids of his beard. “I have devoted much time and\r\nattention to the study of pipe-bowls, and groped among many learned\r\nauthorities, to reconcile the clashing opinions concerning the origin\r\nof the so-called Farnoo, or Froth-of-the-Sea.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, my old centenarian, give us the result of your\r\ninvestigations. But smoke away: a word and a puff go on.”\r\n\r\n“May it please you, then, my right worshipful lord, this Farnoo is an\r\nunctuous, argillaceous substance; in its natural state, soft,\r\nmalleable, and easily worked as the cornelian-red clay from the famous\r\npipe-quarries of the wild tribes to the North. But though mostly found\r\nburied in terra-firma, especially in the isles toward the East, this\r\nFarnoo, my lord, is sometimes thrown up by the ocean; in seasons of\r\nhigh sea, being plentifully found on the reefs. But, my lord, like\r\namber, the precise nature and origin of this Farnoo are points widely\r\nmooted.”\r\n\r\n“Stop there!” cried Media; “our mouth-pieces are of amber; so, not a\r\nword more of the Froth-of-the-Sea, until something be said to clear up\r\nthe mystery of amber. What is amber, old man?”\r\n\r\n“A still more obscure thing to trace than the other, my worshipful\r\nlord. Ancient Plinnee maintained, that originally it must be a juice,\r\nexuding from balsam firs and pines; Borhavo, that, like camphor, it is\r\nthe crystalized oil of aromatic ferns; Berzilli, that it is the\r\nconcreted scum of the lake Cephioris; and Vondendo, against scores of\r\nantagonists, stoutly held it a sort of bituminous gold, trickling from\r\nantediluvian smugglers’ caves, nigh the sea.”\r\n\r\n“Why, old Braid-Beard,” cried Media, placing his pipe in rest, “you are\r\nalmost as erudite as our philosopher here.”\r\n\r\n“Much more so, my lord,” said Babbalanja; “for Mohi has somehow picked\r\nup all my worthless forgettings, which are more than my valuable\r\nrememberings.”\r\n\r\n“What say you, wise one?” cried Mohi, shaking his braids, like an\r\nenraged elephant with many trunks.\r\n\r\nSaid Yoomy: “My lord, I have heard that amber is nothing less than the\r\ncongealed tears of broken-hearted mermaids.”\r\n\r\n“Absurd, minstrel,” cried Mohi. “Hark ye; I know what it is. All other\r\nauthorities to the contrary, amber is nothing more than gold-fishes’\r\nbrains, made waxy, then firm, by the action of the sea.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” cried Yoomy.\r\n\r\n“My lord,” said Braid-Beard, waving his pipe, this thing is just as I\r\nsay. Imbedded in amber, do we not find little fishes’ fins,\r\nporpoise-teeth, sea-gulls’ beaks and claws; nay, butterflies’ wings,\r\nand sometimes a topaz? And how could that be, unless the substance was\r\nfirst soft? Amber is gold-fishes’ brains, I say.”\r\n\r\n“For one,” said Babbalanja, “I’ll not believe that, till you prove to\r\nme, Braid-Beard, that ideas themselves are found imbedded therein.”\r\n\r\n“Another of your crazy conceits, philosopher,” replied Mohi,\r\ndisdainfully; “yet, sometimes plenty of strange black-letter characters\r\nhave been discovered in amber.” And throwing back his hoary old head,\r\nhe jetted forth his vapors like a whale.\r\n\r\n“Indeed?” cried Babbalanja. “Then, my lord Media, it may be earnestly\r\ninquired, whether the gentle laws of the tribes before the flood, were\r\nnot sought to be embalmed and perpetuated between transparent and sweet\r\nscented tablets of amber.”\r\n\r\n“That, now, is not so unlikely,” said Mohi; “for old King Rondo the\r\nRound once set about getting him a coffin-lid of amber; much desiring a\r\nfamous mass of it owned by the ancestors of Donjalolo of Juam. But no\r\nnavies could buy it. So Rondo had himself urned in a crystal.”\r\n\r\n“And that immortalized Rondo, no doubt,” said Babbalanja. “Ha! ha! pity\r\nhe fared not like the fat porpoise frozen and tombed in an iceberg; its\r\nicy shroud drifting south, soon melted away, and down, out of sight,\r\nsunk the dead.”\r\n\r\n“Well, so much for amber,” cried Media. “Now, Mohi, go on about\r\nFarnoo.”\r\n\r\n“Know, then, my lord, that Farnoo is more like ambergris than amber.”\r\n\r\n“Is it? then, pray, tell us something on that head. You know all about\r\nambergris, too, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“Every thing about all things, my lord. Ambergris is found both on land\r\nand at sea. But especially, are lumps of it picked up on the spicy\r\ncoasts of Jovanna; indeed, all over the atolls and reefs in the eastern\r\nquarter of Mardi.”\r\n\r\n“But what is this ambergris? Braid-Beard,” said Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n“Aquovi, the chymist, pronounced it the fragments of mushrooms growing\r\nat the bottom of the sea; Voluto held, that like naptha, it springs\r\nfrom fountains down there. But it is neither.”\r\n\r\n“I have heard,” said Yoomy, “that it is the honey-comb of bees, fallen\r\nfrom flowery cliffs into the brine.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing of the kind,” said Mohi. “Do I not know all about it,\r\nminstrel? Ambergris is the petrified gall-stones of crocodiles.”\r\n\r\n“What!” cried Babbalanja, “comes sweet scented ambergris from those\r\nmusky and chain-plated river cavalry? No wonder, then, their flesh is\r\nso fragrant; their upper jaws as the visors of vinaigrettes.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, you are all wrong,” cried King Media.\r\n\r\nThen, laughing to himself:—“It’s pleasant to sit by, a demi-god, and\r\nhear the surmisings of mortals, upon things they know nothing about;\r\ntheology, or amber, or ambergris, it’s all the same. But then, did I\r\nalways out with every thing I know, there would be no conversing with\r\nthese comical creatures.\r\n\r\n“Listen, old Mohi; ambergris is a morbid secretion of the Spermaceti\r\nwhale; for like you mortals, the whale is at times a sort of\r\nhypochondriac and dyspeptic. You must know, subjects, that in\r\nantediluvian times, the Spermaceti whale was much hunted by sportsmen,\r\nthat being accounted better pastime, than pursuing the Behemoths on\r\nshore. Besides, it was a lucrative diversion. Now, sometimes upon\r\nstriking the monster, it would start off in a dastardly fright, leaving\r\ncertain fragments in its wake. These fragments the hunters picked up,\r\ngiving over the chase for a while. For in those days, as now, a\r\nquarter-quintal of ambergris was more valuable than a whole ton of\r\nspermaceti.”\r\n\r\n“Nor, my lord,” said Babbalanja, “would it have been wise to kill the\r\nfish that dropped such treasures: no more than to murder the noddy that\r\nlaid the golden eggs.”\r\n\r\n“Beshrew me! a noddy it must have been,” gurgled Mohi through his\r\npipe-stem, “to lay golden eggs for others to hatch.”\r\n\r\n“Come, no more of that now,” cried Media. “Mohi, how long think you,\r\nmay one of these pipe-bowls last?”\r\n\r\n“My lord, like one’s cranium, it will endure till broken. I have smoked\r\nthis one of mine more than half a century.”\r\n\r\n“But unlike our craniums, stocked full of concretions,” said\r\nBabbalanja, our pipe-bowls never need clearing out.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said Mohi, “they absorb the oil of the smoke, instead of\r\nallowing it offensively to incrust.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, the older the better,” said Media, “and the more delicious the\r\nflavor imparted to the fumes inhaled.”\r\n\r\n“Farnoos forever! my lord,” cried Yoomy. “By much smoking, the bowl\r\nwaxes russet and mellow, like the berry-brown cheek of a sunburnt\r\nbrunette.”\r\n\r\n“And as like smoked hams,” cried Braid-Beard, “we veteran old smokers\r\ngrow browner and browner; hugely do we admire to see our jolly noses\r\nand pipe-bowls mellowing together.”\r\n\r\n“Well said, old man,” cried Babbalanja; “for, like a good wife, a pipe\r\nis a friend and companion for life. And whoso weds with a pipe, is no\r\nlonger a bachelor. After many vexations, he may go home to that\r\nfaithful counselor, and ever find it full of kind consolations and\r\nsuggestions. But not thus with cigars or cigarrets: the acquaintances\r\nof a moment, chatted with in by-places, whenever they come handy; their\r\nexistence so fugitive, uncertain, unsatisfactory. Once ignited, nothing\r\nlike longevity pertains to them. They never grow old. Why, my lord, the\r\nstump of a cigarret is an abomination; and two of them crossed are more\r\nof a _memento-mori_, than a brace of thigh-bones at right angles.”\r\n\r\n“So they are, so they are,” cried King Media. “Then, mortals, puff we\r\naway at our pipes. Puff, puff, I say. Ah! how we puff! But thus we\r\ndemi-gods ever puff at our ease.”\r\n\r\n“Puff; puff, how we puff,” cried Babbalanja. “but life itself is a puff\r\nand a wheeze. Our lungs are two pipes which we constantly smoke.”\r\n\r\n“Puff, puff! how we puff,” cried old Mohi. “All thought is a puff.”\r\n\r\n“Ay,” said Babbalanja, “not more smoke in that skull-bowl of yours than\r\nin the skull on your shoulders: both ends alike.”\r\n\r\n“Puff! puff! how we puff,” cried Yoomy. “But in every puff, there hangs\r\na wreath. In every puff, off flies a care.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, there they go,” cried Mohi, “there goes another—and, there, and\r\nthere;—this is the way to get rid of them my worshipful lord; puff them\r\naside.”\r\n\r\n“Yoomy,” said Media, “give us that pipe song of thine. Sing it, my\r\nsweet and pleasant poet. We’ll keep time with the flageolets of ours.”\r\n\r\n“So with pipes and puffs for a chorus, thus Yoomy sang:—\r\n\r\nCare is all stuff:—\r\n    Puff! Puff:\r\nTo puff is enough:—\r\n    Puff! Puff!\r\nMore musky than snuff,\r\nAnd warm is a puff:—\r\n    Puff! Puff!\r\nHere we sit mid our puffs,\r\nLike old lords in their ruffs,\r\nSnug as bears in their muffs:—\r\n    Puff! Puff!\r\nThen puff, puff, puff;\r\nFor care is all stuff,\r\nPuffed off in a puff:—\r\n    Puff! Puff!\r\n\r\n\r\n“Ay, puff away,” cried Babbalanja, “puff; puff, so we are born, and so\r\ndie. Puff, puff, my volcanos: the great sun itself will yet go out in a\r\nsnuff, and all Mardi smoke out its last wick.”\r\n\r\n“Puffs enough,” said King Media, “Vee-Vee! haul down my flag. There,\r\nlie down before me, oh Gonfalon! and, subjects, hear,—when I die, lay\r\nthis spear on my right, and this pipe on my left, its colors at half\r\nmast; so shall I be ambidexter, and sleep between eloquent symbols.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nThey Visit An Extraordinary Old Antiquary\r\n\r\n\r\n“About prows there, ye paddlers,” cried Media. “In this fog we’ve been\r\nraising, we have sailed by Padulla, our destination.”\r\n\r\nNow Padulla, was but a little island, tributary to a neighboring king;\r\nits population embracing some hundreds of thousands of leaves, and\r\nflowers, and butterflies, yet only two solitary mortals; one, famous as\r\na venerable antiquarian: a collector of objects of Mardian vertu; a\r\ncognoscenti, and dilettante in things old and marvelous; and for that\r\nreason, very choice of himself.\r\n\r\nHe went by the exclamatory cognomen of “Oh-Oh;” a name bestowed upon\r\nhim, by reason of the delighted interjections, with which he welcomed\r\nall accessions to his museum.\r\n\r\nNow, it was to obtain a glimpse of this very museum, that Media was\r\nanxious to touch at Padulla.\r\n\r\nLanding, and passing through a grove, we were accosted by Oh-Oh\r\nhimself; who, having heard the shouts of our paddlers, had sallied\r\nforth, staff in hand.\r\n\r\nThe old man was a sight to see; especially his nose; a remarkable one.\r\nAnd all Mardi over, a remarkable nose is a prominent feature: an ever\r\nobvious passport to distinction. For, after all, this gaining a name,\r\nis but the individualizing of a man; as well achieved by an\r\nextraordinary nose, as by an extraordinary epic. Far better, indeed;\r\nfor you may pass poets without knowing them. Even a hero, is no hero\r\nwithout his sword; nor Beelzebub himself a lion, minus that lasso-tail\r\nof his, wherewith he catches his prey. Whereas, he who is famous\r\nthrough his nose, it is impossible to overlook. He is a celebrity\r\nwithout toiling for a name. Snugly ensconced behind his proboscis, he\r\nrevels in its shadow, receiving tributes of attention wherever he goes.\r\n\r\nNot to enter at large upon the topography of Oh-Oh’s nasal organ, all\r\nmust be content with this; that it was of a singular magnitude, and\r\nboldly aspiring at the end; an exclamation point in the face of the\r\nwearer, forever wondering at the visible universe. The eyes of Oh-Oh\r\nwere like the creature’s that the Jew abhors: placed slanting in his\r\nhead, and converging their rays toward the mouth; which was no Mouth,\r\nbut a gash.\r\n\r\nI mean not to be harsh, or unpleasant upon thee, Oh-Oh; but I must\r\npaint thee as thou wert.\r\n\r\nThe rest of his person was crooked, and dwarfed, and surmounted by a\r\nhump, that sat on his back like a burden. And a weary load is a hump,\r\nHeaven knows, only to be cast off in the grave.\r\n\r\nThus old, and antiquated, and gable-ended, was the tabernacle of\r\nOh-Oh’s soul. But his person was housed in as curious a structure.\r\nBuilt of old boughs of trees blown down in the groves, and covered over\r\nwith unruly thatching, it seemed, without, some ostrich nest. But\r\nwithin, so intricate, and grotesque, its brown alleys and cells, that\r\nthe interior of no walnut was more labyrinthine.\r\n\r\nAnd here, strewn about, all dusty and disordered, were the precious\r\nantiques, and curios, and obsoletes, which to Oh-Oh were dear as the\r\napple of his eye, or the memory of departed days.\r\n\r\nThe old man was exceedingly importunate, in directing attention to his\r\nrelics; concerning each of which, he had an endless story to tell. Time\r\nwould fail; nay, patience, to repeat his legends. So, in order, here\r\nfollow the most prominent of his rarities:—\r\n\r\n\r\nThe identical Canoe, in which, ages back, the god Unja came from the\r\nbottom of the sea. (Very ponderous; of lignum-vitae wood).\r\n\r\nA stone Flower-pot, containing in the original soil, Unja’s last\r\nfootprints, when he embarked from Mardi for parts unknown. (One\r\nfoot-print unaccountably reversed).\r\n\r\nThe Jaw-bones of Tooroorooloo, a great orator in the days of Unja.\r\n(Somewhat twisted).\r\n\r\nA quaint little Fish-hook. (Made from the finger-bones of Kravi the\r\nCunning).\r\n\r\nThe mystic Gourd; carved all over with cabalistic triangles, and\r\nhypogrifs; by study of which a reputed prophet, was said to have\r\nobtained his inspiration. (Slightly redolent of vineyards).\r\n\r\nThe complete Skeleton of an immense Tiger-shark; the bones of a\r\nPearl-shell-diver’s leg inside. (Picked off the reef at low tide).\r\n\r\nAn inscrutable, shapeless block of a mottled-hued, smoke-dried wood.\r\n(Three unaccountable holes drilled through the middle).\r\n\r\nA sort of ecclesiastical Fasces, being the bony blades of nine sword-\r\nfish, basket-hilted with shark’s jaws, braided round and tasseled with\r\ncords of human hair. (Now obsolete).\r\n\r\nThe mystic Fan with which Unja fanned himself when in trouble. (Woven\r\nfrom the leaves of the Water-Lily).\r\n\r\nA Tripod of a Stork’s Leg, supporting a nautilus shell, containing the\r\nfragments of a bird’s egg; into which, was said to have been magically\r\ndecanted the soul of a deceased chief. (Unfortunately crushed in by\r\natmospheric pressure).\r\n\r\nTwo clasped Right Hands, embalmed; being those of twin warriors, who\r\nthus died on a battle-field. (Impossible to sunder).\r\n\r\nA curious Pouch, or Purse, formed from the skin of an Albatross’ foot,\r\nand decorated with three sharp claws, naturally pertaining to it.\r\n(Originally the property of a notorious old Tooth-per-Tooth).\r\n\r\nA long tangled lock of Mermaid’s Hair, much resembling the curling\r\nsilky fibres of the finer sea-weed. (Preserved between fins of the\r\ndolphin).\r\n\r\nA Mermaid’s Comb for the toilet. The stiff serrated crest of a Cook\r\nStorm-petrel (Oh-Oh was particularly curious concerning Mermaids).\r\n\r\nFiles, Rasps, and Pincers, all bone, the implements of an eminent\r\nChiropedist, who flourished his tools before the flood. (Owing to the\r\nexcessive unevenness of the surface in those times, the diluvians were\r\npeculiarly liable to pedal afflictions).\r\n\r\nThe back Tooth, that Zozo the Enthusiast, in token of grief, recklessly\r\nknocked out at the decease of a friend. (Worn to a stump and quite\r\nuseless).\r\n\r\n\r\nThese wonders inspected, Oh-Oh conducted us to an arbor, to show us the\r\nfamous telescope, by help of which, he said he had discovered an\r\nant-hill in the moon. It rested in the crotch of a Bread-fruit tree;\r\nand was a prodigiously long and hollow trunk of a Palm; a scale from a\r\nsea-kraken its lens.\r\n\r\nThen returning to his cabinet, he pointed to a bamboo microscope, which\r\nhad wonderfully assisted him in his entomological pursuits.\r\n\r\n“By this instrument, my masters,” said he, “I have satisfied myself,\r\nthat in the eye of a dragon-fly there are precisely twelve thousand\r\nfive hundred and forty-one triangular lenses; and in the leg of a flea,\r\nscores on scores of distinct muscles. Now, my masters, how far think\r\nyou a flea may leap at one spring? Why, two hundred times its own\r\nlength; I have often measured their leaps, with a small measure I use\r\nfor scientific purposes.”\r\n\r\n“Truly, Oh-Oh,” said Babbalanja, “your discoveries must ere long result\r\nin something grand; since you furnish such invaluable data for\r\ntheorists. Pray, attend, my lord Media. If, at one spring, a flea leaps\r\ntwo hundred times its own length, then, with the like proportion of\r\nmuscles in his calves, a bandit might pounce upon the unwary traveler\r\nfrom a quarter of a mile off. Is it not so, Oh-Oh?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, but it is, my masters. And one of the greatest consolations I\r\ndraw from these studies, is the ever-strengthening conviction of the\r\nbeneficent wisdom that framed our Mardi. For did men possess thighs in\r\nproportion to fleas, verily, the wicked would grievously leap about,\r\nand curvet in the isles.”\r\n\r\n“But Oh-Oh,” said Babbalanja, “what other discoveries have you made?\r\nHast yet put a usurer under your lens, to find his conscience? or a\r\nlibertine, to find his heart? Hast yet brought your microscope to bear\r\nupon a downy peach, or a rosy cheek?”\r\n\r\n“I have,” said Oh-Oh, mournfully; “and from the moment I so did, I have\r\nhad no heart to eat a peach, or salute a cheek.”\r\n\r\n“Then dash your lens!” cried Media.\r\n\r\n“Well said, my lord. For all the eyes we get beyond our own, but\r\nminister to infelicity. The microscope disgusts us with our Mardi; and\r\nthe telescope sets us longing for some other world.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nThey Go Down Into The Catacombs\r\n\r\n\r\nWith a dull flambeau, we now descended some narrow stone steps, to view\r\nOh-Oh’s collection of ancient and curious manuscripts, preserved in a\r\nvault.\r\n\r\n“This way, this way, my masters,” cried Oh-Oh, aloft, swinging his dim\r\ntorch. “Keep your hands before you; it’s a dark road to travel.”\r\n\r\n“So it seems,” said Babbalanja, wide-groping, as he descended lower and\r\nlower. “My lord this is like going down to posterity.”\r\n\r\nUpon gaining the vault, forth flew a score or two of bats,\r\nextinguishing the flambeau, and leaving us in darkness, like Belzoni\r\ndeserted by his Arabs in the heart of a pyramid. The torch at last\r\nrelumed, we entered a tomb-like excavation, at every step raising\r\nclouds of dust; and at last stood before long rows of musty, mummyish\r\nparcels, so dingy-red, and so rolled upon sticks, that they looked like\r\nstiff sausages of Bologna; but smelt like some fine old Stilton or\r\nCheshire.\r\n\r\nMost ancient of all, was a hieroglyphical Elegy on the Dumps,\r\nconsisting of one thousand and one lines; the characters,—herons,\r\nweeping-willows, and ravens, supposed to have been traced by a quill\r\nfrom the sea-noddy.\r\n\r\nThen there were plenty of rare old ballads:—\r\n\r\n“King Kroko, and the Fisher Girl.”\r\n“The Fight at the Ford of Spears.”\r\n“The Song of the Skulls.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd brave old chronicles, that made Mohi’s mouth water:—\r\n\r\n“The Rise and Setting of the Dynasty of Foofoo.”\r\n“The Heroic History of the Noble Prince Dragoni; showing how he killed\r\nten Pinioned Prisoners with his Own Hand.”\r\n“The whole Pedigree of the King of Kandidee, with that of his famous\r\nhorse, Znorto.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Tarantula books:—\r\n\r\n“Sour Milk for the Young, by a Dairyman.”\r\n“The Devil adrift, by a Corsair.”\r\n“Grunts and Groans, by a Mad Boar.”\r\n“Stings, by a Scorpion.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd poetical productions:—\r\n\r\n“Suffusions of a Lily in a Shower.”\r\n“Sonnet on the last Breath of an Ephemera.”\r\n“The Gad-fly, and Other Poems.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd metaphysical treatises:—\r\n\r\n“Necessitarian not Predestinarian.”\r\n“Philosophical Necessity and Predestination One Thing and The Same.”\r\n“Whatever is not, is.”\r\n“Whatever is, is not.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd scarce old memoirs:—\r\n\r\n“The One Hundred Books of the Biography of the Great and Good King\r\nGrandissimo.”\r\n“The Life of old Philo, the Philanthropist, in one Chapter.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd popular literature:—\r\n\r\n“A most Sweet, Pleasant, and Unctuous Account of the Manner in which\r\nFive-and-Forty Robbers were torn asunder by Swiftly-Going Canoes.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd books by chiefs and nobles:—\r\n\r\n“The Art of Making a Noise in Mardi.”\r\n“On the Proper Manner of Saluting a Bosom Friend.”\r\n“Letters from a Father to a Son, inculcating the Virtue of Vice.”\r\n“Pastorals by a Younger Son.”\r\n“A Catalogue of Chieftains who have been Authors, by a Chieftain, who\r\ndisdains to be deemed an Author.”\r\n“A Canto on a Cough caught by my Consort.”\r\n“The Philosophy of Honesty, by a late Lord, who died in disgrace.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd theological works:—\r\n\r\n“Pepper for the Perverse.”\r\n“Pudding for the Pious.”\r\n“Pleas for Pardon.”\r\n“Pickles for the Persecuted.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd long and tedious romances with short and easy titles:—\r\n\r\n“The Buck.”\r\n“The Belle.”\r\n“The King and the Cook, or the Cook and the King.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd books of voyages:—\r\n\r\n“A Sojourn among the Anthropophagi, by One whose Hand was eaten off at\r\nTiffin among the Savages.”\r\n“Franko: its King, Court, and Tadpoles.”\r\n“Three Hours in Vivenza, containing a Full and Impartial Account of\r\nthat Whole Country: by a Subject of King Bello.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd works of nautical poets:—\r\n\r\n“Sky-Sail-Pole Lyrics.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd divers brief books, with panic-striking titles:—\r\n\r\n“Are you safe?”\r\n“A Voice from Below.”\r\n“Hope for none.”\r\n“Fire for all.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd pamphlets by retired warriors:—\r\n\r\n“On the Best Gravy for Wild Boar’s Meat.”\r\n“Three Receipts for Bottling New Arrack.”\r\n“To Brown Bread Fruit without Burning.”\r\n“Advice to the Dyspeptic.”\r\n“On Starch for Tappa.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAll these MSS. were highly prized by Oh-Oh. He averred, that they spoke\r\nof the mighty past, which he reverenced more than the paltry present,\r\nthe dross and sediment of what had been.\r\n\r\nPeering into a dark crypt, Babbalanja drew forth a few crumbling,\r\nillegible, black-letter sheets of his favorite old essayist, brave\r\nBardianna. They seemed to have formed parts of a work, whose title only\r\nremained—“Thoughts, by a Thinker.”\r\n\r\nSilently Babbalanja pressed them to his heart. Then at arm’s length\r\nheld them, and said, “And is all this wisdom lost? Can not the divine\r\ncunning in thee, Bardianna, transmute to brightness these sullied\r\npages? Here, perhaps, thou didst dive into the deeps of things,\r\ntreating of the normal forms of matter and of mind; how the particles\r\nof solids were first molded in the interstices of fluids; how the\r\nthoughts of men are each a soul, as the lung-cells are each a lung; how\r\nthat death is but a mode of life; while mid-most is the Pharzi.— But\r\nall is faded. Yea, here the Thinker’s thoughts lie cheek by jowl with\r\nphrasemen’s words. Oh Bardianna! these pages were offspring of thee,\r\nthought of thy thought, soul of thy soul. Instinct with mind, they once\r\nspoke out like living voices; now, they’re dust; and would not prick a\r\nfool to action. Whence then is this? If the fogs of some few years can\r\nmake soul linked to matter naught; how can the unhoused spirit hope to\r\nlive when mildewed with the damps of death.”\r\n\r\nPiously he folded the shreds of manuscript together, kissed them, and\r\nlaid them down.\r\n\r\nThen approaching Oh-Oh, he besought him for one leaf, one shred of\r\nthose most precious pages, in memory of Bardianna, and for the love of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBut learning who he was, one of that old Ponderer’s commentators, Oh-Oh\r\ntottered toward the manuscripts; with trembling fingers told them over,\r\none by one, and said—“Thank Oro! all are here.—Philosopher, ask me for\r\nmy limbs, my life, my heart, but ask me not for these. Steeped in wax,\r\nthese shall be my cerements.”\r\n\r\nAll in vain; Oh-Oh was an antiquary.\r\n\r\nTurning in despair, Babbalanja spied a heap of worm-eaten parchment\r\ncovers, and many clippings and parings. And whereas the rolls of\r\nmanuscripts did smell like unto old cheese; so these relics did\r\nmarvelously resemble the rinds of the same.\r\n\r\nTurning over this pile, Babbalanja lighted upon something that restored\r\nhis good humor. Long he looked it over delighted; but bethinking him,\r\nthat he must have dragged to day some lost work of the collection, and\r\nmuch desirous of possessing it, he made bold again to ply Oh-Oh;\r\noffering a tempting price for his discovery.\r\n\r\nGlancing at the title—“A Happy Life”—the old man cried—“Oh, rubbish!\r\nrubbish! take it for nothing.” And Babbalanja placed it in his\r\nvestment.\r\n\r\nThe catacombs surveyed, and day-light gained, we inquired the way to\r\nJi-Ji’s, also a collector, but of another sort; one miserly in the\r\nmatter of teeth, the money of Mardi.\r\n\r\nAt the mention of his name, Oh-Oh flew out into scornful philippics\r\nupon the insanity of that old dotard, who hoarded up teeth, as if teeth\r\nwere of any use, but to purchase rarities. Nevertheless, he pointed out\r\nour path; following which, we crossed a meadow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\nBabbalanja Quotes From An Antique Pagan; And Earnestly Presses It Upon\r\nThe Company, That What He Recites Is Not His But Another’s\r\n\r\n\r\nJourneying on, we stopped by a gurgling spring, in a beautiful grove;\r\nand here, we stretched out on the grass, and our attendants unpacked\r\ntheir hampers, to provide us a lunch.\r\n\r\nBut as for that Babbalanja of ours, he must needs go and lunch by\r\nhimself, and, like a cannibal, feed upon an author; though in other\r\nrespects he was not so partial to bones.\r\n\r\nBringing forth the treasure he had buried in his bosom, he was soon\r\nburied in it; and motionless on his back, looked as if laid out, to\r\nkeep an appointment with his undertaker.\r\n\r\n“What, ho! Babbalanja!” cried Media from under a tree, “don’t be a\r\nduck, there, with your bill in the air; drop your metaphysics, man, and\r\nfall to on the solids. Do you hear?”\r\n\r\n“Come, philosopher,” said Mohi, handling a banana, “you will weigh more\r\nafter you have eaten.”\r\n\r\n“Come, list, Babbalanja,” cried Yoomy, “I am going to sing.”\r\n\r\n“Up! up! I say,” shouted Media again. “But go, old man, and wake him:\r\nrap on his head, and see whether he be in.”\r\n\r\nMohi, obeying, found him at home; and Babbalanja started up.\r\n\r\n“In Oro’s name, what ails you, philosopher? See you Paradise, that you\r\nlook so wildly?”\r\n\r\n“A Happy Life! a Happy Life!” cried Babbalanja, in an ecstasy. “My\r\nlord, I am lost in the dream of it, as here recorded. Marvelous book!\r\nits goodness transports me. Let me read:—‘I would bear the same mind,\r\nwhether I be rich or poor, whether I get or lose in the world. I will\r\nreckon benefits well placed as the fairest part of my possession, not\r\nvaluing them by number or weight, but by the profit and esteem of the\r\nreceiver; accounting myself never the poorer for any thing I give. What\r\nI do shall be done for conscience, not ostentation. I will eat and\r\ndrink, not to gratify my palate, but to satisfy nature. I will be\r\ncheerful to my friends, mild and placable to my enemies. I will prevent\r\nan honest request, if I can foresee it; and I will grant it, without\r\nasking. I will look upon the whole world as my country; and upon Oro,\r\nboth as the witness and the judge of my words and my deeds. I will live\r\nand die with this testimony: that I loved a good conscience; that I\r\nnever invaded another man’s liberty; and that I preserved my own. I\r\nwill govern my life and my thoughts, as if the whole world were to see\r\nthe one, and to read the other; for what does it signify, to make any\r\nthing a secret to my neighbor, when to Oro all our privacies are\r\nopen.’”\r\n\r\n“Very fine,” said Media.\r\n\r\n“The very spirit of the first followers of Alma, as recorded in the\r\nlegends,” said Mohi.\r\n\r\n“Inimitable,” said Yoomy.\r\n\r\nSaid Babbalanja, “Listen again:—‘Righteousness is sociable and gentle;\r\nfree, steady, and fearless; full of inexhaustible delights.’ And here\r\nagain, and here, and here:—The true felicity of life is to understand\r\nour duty to Oro.’—‘True joy is a serene and sober motion.’ And here,\r\nand here,—my lord, ’tis hard quoting from this book;—but listen—‘A\r\npeaceful conscience, honest thoughts, and righteous actions are\r\nblessings without end, satiety, or measure. The poor man wants many\r\nthings; the covetous man, all. It is not enough to know Oro, unless we\r\nobey him.’”\r\n\r\n“Alma all over,” cried Mohi; “sure, you read from his sayings?”\r\n\r\n“I read but odd sentences from one, who though he lived ages ago, never\r\nsaw, scarcely heard of Alma. And mark me, my lord, this time I\r\nimprovise nothing. What I have recited, Is here. Mohi, this book is\r\nmore marvelous than the prophecies. My lord, that a mere man, and a\r\nheathen, in that most heathenish time, should give utterance to such\r\nheavenly wisdom, seems more wonderful than that an inspired prophet\r\nshould reveal it. And is it not more divine in this philosopher, to\r\nlove righteousness for its own sake, and in view of annihilation, than\r\nfor pious sages to extol it as the means of everlasting felicity?”\r\n\r\n“Alas,” sighed Yoomy, “and does he not promise us any good thing, when\r\nwe are dead?”\r\n\r\n“He speaks not by authority. He but woos us to goodness and happiness\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\n“Then, Babbalanja,” said Media, “keep your treasure to yourself.\r\nWithout authority, and a full right hand, Righteousness better be\r\nsilent. Mardi’s religion must seem to come direct from Oro, and the\r\nmass of you mortals endeavor it not, except for a consideration,\r\npresent or to come.”\r\n\r\n“And call you that righteousness, my lord, which is but the price paid\r\ndown for something else?”\r\n\r\n“I called it not righteousness; it is religion so called. But let us\r\nprate no more of these things; with which I, a demi-god, have but\r\nlittle in common. It ever impairs my digestion. No more, Babbalanja.”\r\n\r\n“My lord! my lord! out of itself, Religion has nothing to bestow. Nor\r\nwill she save us from aught, but from the evil in ourselves. Her one\r\ngrand end is to make us wise; her only manifestations are reverence to\r\nOro and love to man; her only, but ample reward, herself. He who has\r\nthis, has all. He who has this, whether he kneel to an image of wood,\r\ncalling it Oro; or to an image of air, calling it the same; whether he\r\nfasts or feasts; laughs or weeps;—that man can be no richer. And this\r\nreligion, faith, virtue, righteousness, good, whate’er you will, I find\r\nin this book I hold. No written page can teach me more.”\r\n\r\n“Have you that, then, of which you speak, Babbalanja? Are you content,\r\nthere where you stand?”\r\n\r\n“My lord, you drive me home. I am not content. The mystery of mysteries\r\nis still a mystery. How this author came to be so wise, perplexes me.\r\nHow he led the life he did, confounds me. Oh, my lord, I am in\r\ndarkness, and no broad blaze comes down to flood me. The rays that come\r\nto me are but faint cross lights, mazing the obscurity wherein I live.\r\nAnd after all, excellent as it is, I can be no gainer by this book. For\r\nthe more we learn, the more we unlearn; we accumulate not, but\r\nsubstitute; and take away, more than we add. We dwindle while we grow;\r\nwe sally out for wisdom, and retreat beyond the point whence we\r\nstarted; we essay the Fondiza, and get but the Phe. Of all simpletons,\r\nthe simplest! Oh! that I were another sort of fool than I am, that I\r\nmight restore my good opinion of myself. Continually I stand in the\r\npillory, am broken on the wheel, and dragged asunder by wild horses.\r\nYes, yes, Bardianna, all is in a nut, as thou sayest; but all my back\r\nteeth can not crack it; I but crack my own jaws. All round me, my\r\nfellow men are new-grafting their vines, and dwelling in flourishing\r\narbors; while I am forever pruning mine, till it is become but a stump.\r\nYet in this pruning will I persist; I will not add, I will diminish; I\r\nwill train myself down to the standard of what is unchangeably true.\r\nDay by day I drop off my redundancies; ere long I shall have stripped\r\nmy ribs; when I die, they will but bury my spine. Ah! where, where,\r\nwhere, my lord, is the everlasting Tekana? Tell me, Mohi, where the\r\nEphina? I may have come to the Penultimate, but where, sweet Yoomy, is\r\nthe Ultimate? Ah, companions! I faint, I am wordless:- -something,\r\nnothing, riddles,—does Mardi hold her?”\r\n\r\n“He swoons!” cried Yoomy.\r\n\r\n“Water! water!” cried Media.\r\n\r\n“Away:” said Babbalanja serenely, “I revive.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nThey Visit A Wealthy Old Pauper\r\n\r\n\r\nContinuing our route to Jiji’s, we presently came to a miserable hovel.\r\nHalf projecting from the low, open entrance, was a bald overgrown head,\r\nintent upon an upright row of dark-colored bags:— pelican\r\npouches—prepared by dropping a stone within, and suspending them, when\r\nmoist.\r\n\r\nEver and anon, the great head shook with a tremulous motion, as one by\r\none, to a clicking sound from the old man’s mouth, the strings of teeth\r\nwere slowly drawn forth, and let fall, again and again, with a rattle.\r\n\r\nBut perceiving our approach, the old miser suddenly swooped his pouches\r\nout of sight; and, like a turtle into its shell, retreated into his\r\nden. But soon he decrepitly emerged upon his knees, asking what brought\r\nus thither?—to steal the teeth, which lying rumor averred he possessed\r\nin abundance? And opening his mouth, he averred he had none; not even a\r\nsentry in his head.\r\n\r\nBut Babbalanja declared, that long since he must have drawn his own\r\ndentals, and bagged them with the rest.\r\n\r\nNow this miserable old miser must have been idiotic; for soon\r\nforgetting what he had but just told us of his utter toothlessness, he\r\nwas so smitten with the pearly mouth of Hohora, one of our attendants\r\n(the same for whose pearls, little King Peepi had taken such a fancy),\r\nthat he made the following overture to purchase its contents: namely:\r\none tooth of the buyer’s, for every three of the seller’s. A\r\nproposition promptly rejected, as involving a mercantile absurdity.\r\n\r\n“Why?” said Babbalanja. “Doubtless, because that proposed to be given,\r\nis less than that proposed to be received. Yet, says a philosopher,\r\nthis is the very principle which regulates all barterings. For where\r\nthe sense of a simple exchange of quantities, alike in value?”\r\n\r\n“Where, indeed?” said Hohora with open eyes, “though I never heard it\r\nbefore, that’s a staggering question. I beseech you, who was the sage\r\nthat asked it?”\r\n\r\n“Vivo, the Sophist,” said Babbalanja, turning aside.\r\n\r\nIn the hearing of Jiji, allusion was made to Oh-Oh, as a neighbor of\r\nhis. Whereupon he vented much slavering opprobrium upon that miserable\r\nold hump-back; who accumulated useless monstrosities; throwing away the\r\nprecious teeth, which otherwise might have sensibly rattled in his own\r\npelican pouches.\r\n\r\nWhen we quitted the hovel, Jiji, marking little Vee-Vee, from whose\r\nshoulder hung a calabash of edibles, seized the hem of his garment and\r\nbesought him for one mouthful of food; for nothing had he tasted that\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe boy tossed him a yam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nYoomy Sings Some Odd Verses, And Babbalanja Quotes From The Old Authors\r\nRight And Left\r\n\r\n\r\nSailing from Padulla, after many pleasant things had been said\r\nconcerning the sights there beheld; Babbalanja thus addressed Yoomy—\r\n“Warbler, the last song you sung was about moonlight, and paradise, and\r\nfabulous pleasures evermore: now, have you any hymns about earthly\r\nfelicity?”\r\n\r\n“If so, minstrel,” said Media, “jet it forth, my fountain, forthwith.”\r\n\r\n“Just now, my lord,” replied Yoomy, “I was singing to myself, as I\r\noften do, and by your leave, I will continue aloud.”\r\n\r\n“Better begin at the beginning, I should think,” said the chronicler,\r\nboth hands to his chin, beginning at the top to new braid his beard.\r\n\r\n“No: like the roots of your beard, old Mohi, all beginnings are stiff,”\r\ncried Babbalanja. “We are lucky in living midway in eternity. So sing\r\naway, Yoomy, where you left off,” and thus saying he unloosed his\r\ngirdle for the song, as Apicius would for a banquet.\r\n\r\n“Shall I continue aloud, then, my lord?”\r\n\r\nMy lord nodded, and Yoomy sang:—\r\n\r\n“Full round, full soft, her dewy arms,—\r\nSweet shelter from all Mardi’s harms!”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Whose arms?” cried Mohi.\r\n\r\nSang Yoomy:—\r\n\r\nDiving deep in the sea,\r\n    She takes sunshine along:\r\nDown flames in the sea,\r\n    As of dolphins a throng.\r\n\r\n\r\n“What mermaid is this?” cried Mohi.\r\n\r\nSang Yoomy:—\r\n\r\nHer foot, a falling sound,\r\nThat all day long might bound.\r\n    Over the beach,\r\n    The soft sand beach,\r\n    And none would find\r\n    A trace behind.\r\n\r\n\r\n“And why not?” demanded Media, “why could no trace be found?”\r\n\r\nSaid Braid-Beard, “Perhaps owing, my lord, to the flatness of the\r\nmermaid’s foot. But no; that can not be; for mermaids are all vertebrae\r\nbelow the waist.”\r\n\r\n“Your fragment is pretty good, I dare say, Yoomy,” observed Media, “but\r\nas Braid-Beard hints, rather flat.”\r\n\r\n“Flat as the foot of a man with his mind made up,” cried Braid-Beard.\r\n“Yoomy, did you sup on flounders last night?”\r\n\r\nBut Yoomy vouchsafed no reply, he was ten thousand leagues off in a\r\nreverie: somewhere in the Hyades perhaps.\r\n\r\nConversation proceeding, Braid-Beard happened to make allusion to one\r\nRotato, a portly personage, who, though a sagacious philosopher, and\r\nvery ambitious to be celebrated as such, was only famous in Mardi as\r\nthe fattest man of his tribe.\r\n\r\nSaid Media, “Then, Mohi, Rotato could not pick a quarrel with Fame,\r\nsince she did not belie him. Fat he was, and fat she published him.”\r\n\r\n“Right, my lord,” said Babbalanja, “for Fame is not always so honest.\r\nNot seldom to be famous, is to be widely known for what you are not,\r\nsays Alla-Malolla. Whence it comes, as old Bardianna has it, that for\r\nyears a man may move unnoticed among his fellows; but all at once, by\r\nsome chance attitude, foreign to his habit, become a trumpet-full for\r\nfools; though, in himself, the same as ever. Nor has he shown himself\r\nyet; for the entire merit of a man can never be made known; nor the sum\r\nof his demerits, if he have them. We are only known by our names; as\r\nletters sealed up, we but read each other’s superscriptions.\r\n\r\n“So with the commonalty of us Mardians. How then with those beings who\r\nevery way are but too apt to be riddles. In many points the works of\r\nour great poet Vavona, now dead a thousand moons, still remain a\r\nmystery. Some call him a mystic; but wherein he seems obscure, it is,\r\nperhaps, we that are in fault; not by premeditation spoke he those\r\narchangel thoughts, which made many declare, that Vavona, after all,\r\nwas but a crack-pated god, not a mortal of sound mind. But had he been\r\nless, my lord, he had seemed more. Saith Fulvi, ‘Of the highest order\r\nof genius, it may be truly asserted, that to gain the reputation of\r\nsuperior power, it must partially disguise itself; it must come down,\r\nand then it will be applauded for soaring.’ And furthermore, that there\r\nare those who falter in the common tongue, because they think in\r\nanother; and these are accounted stutterers and stammerers.’”\r\n\r\n“Ah! how true!” cried the Warbler.\r\n\r\n“And what says the archangel Vavona, Yoomy, in that wonderful drama of\r\nhis, ‘The Souls of the Sages?’—‘Beyond most barren hills, there are\r\nlandscapes ravishing; with but one eye to behold; which no pencil can\r\nportray.’ What wonder then, my lord, that Mardi itself is so blind.\r\n‘Mardi is a monster,’ says old Bardianna, ‘whose eyes are fixed in its\r\nhead, like a whale’s; it can see but two ways, and those comprising but\r\na small arc of a perfect vision. Poets, heroes, and men of might, are\r\nall around this monster Mardi. But stand before me on stilts, or I will\r\nbehold you not, says the monster; brush back your hair; inhale the wind\r\nlargely; lucky are all men with dome-like foreheads; luckless those\r\nwith pippin-heads; loud lungs are a blessing; a lion is no lion that\r\ncan not roar.’ Says Aldina, ‘There are those looking on, who know\r\nthemselves to be swifter of foot than the racers, but are confounded\r\nwith the simpletons that stare.’”\r\n\r\n“The mere carping of a disappointed cripple,” cried Mold. His\r\nbiographer states, that Aldina had only one leg.”\r\n\r\n“Braid-Beard, you are witty,” said Babbbalanja, adjusting his robe. “My\r\nlord, there are heroes without armies, who hear martial music in their\r\nsouls.”\r\n\r\n“Why not blow their trumpets louder, then,” cried Media, that all Mardi\r\nmay hear?”\r\n\r\n“My lord Media, too, is witty, Babbalanja,” said Mohi.\r\n\r\nBreathed Yoomy, “There are birds of divinest plumage, and most glorious\r\nsong, yet singing their lyrics to themselves.”\r\n\r\nSaid Media, “The lark soars high, cares for no auditor, yet its sweet\r\nnotes are heard here below. It sings, too, in company with myriads of\r\nmates. Your soliloquists, Yoomy, are mostly herons and owls.”\r\n\r\nSaid Babbalanja, “Very clever, my lord; but think you not, there are\r\nmen eloquent, who never babble in the marketplace?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, and arrant babblers at home. In few words, Babbalanja, you espouse\r\na bad cause. Most of you mortals are peacocks; some having tails, and\r\nsome not; those who have them will be sure to thrust their plumes in\r\nyour face; for the rest, they will display their bald cruppers, and\r\nstill screech for admiration. But when a great genius is born into\r\nMardi, he nods, and is known.”\r\n\r\n“More wit, but, with deference, perhaps less truth, my lord. Say what\r\nyou will, Fame is an accident; merit a thing absolute. But what matter?\r\nOf what available value reputation, unless wedded to power, dentals, or\r\nplace? To those who render him applause, a poet’s may seem a thing\r\ntangible; but to the recipient, ’tis a fantasy; the poet never so\r\nstretches his imagination, as when striving to comprehend what it is;\r\noften, he is famous without knowing it.”\r\n\r\n“At the sacred games of Lazella,” said Yoomy, “slyly crowned from\r\nbehind with a laurel fillet, for many hours, the minstrel Jarmi\r\nwandered about ignorant of the honors he bore. But enlightened at last,\r\nhe doffed the wreath; then, holding it at arm’s length, sighed\r\nforth—Oh, ye laurels! to be visible to me, ye must be removed from my\r\nbrow!”\r\n\r\n“And what said Botargo,” cried Babbalanja, “hearing that his poems had\r\nbeen translated into the language of the remote island of Bertranda?—\r\n‘It stirs me little; already, in merry fancies, have I dreamed of their\r\nbeing trilled by the blessed houris in paradise; I can only imagine the\r\nsame of the damsels of Bertranda.’ Says Boldo, the\r\nMaterialist,—‘Substances alone are satisfactory.’”\r\n\r\n“And so thought the mercenary poet, Zenzi,” said Yoomy. “Upon receiving\r\nfourteen ripe yams for a sonnet, one for every line, he said to me,\r\nYoomy, I shall make a better meal upon these, than upon so many\r\ncompliments.”\r\n\r\n“Ay,” cried Babbalanja, “‘Bravos,’ saith old Bardianna, but induce\r\nflatulency.’”\r\n\r\nSaid Media, “And do you famous mortals, then, take no pleasure in\r\nhearing your bravos?”\r\n\r\n“Much, my good lord; at least such famous mortals, so enamored of a\r\nclamorous notoriety, as to bravo for themselves, when none else will\r\nhuzza; whose whole existence is an unintermitting consciousness of\r\nself; whose very persons stand erect and self-sufficient as their\r\ninfallible index, the capital letter I; who relish and comprehend no\r\nreputation but what attaches to the carcass; who would as lief be\r\nrenowned for a splendid mustache, as for a splendid drama: who know not\r\nhow it was that a personage, to posterity so universally celebrated as\r\nthe poet Vavona, ever passed through the crowd unobserved; who deride\r\nthe very thunder for making such a noise in Mardi, and yet disdain to\r\nmanifest itself to the eye.”\r\n\r\n“Wax not so warm, Babbalanja; but tell us, if to his contemporaries\r\nVavona’s person was almost unknown, what satisfaction did he derive\r\nfrom his genius?”\r\n\r\n“Had he not its consciousness?—an empire boundless as the West. What to\r\nhim were huzzas? Why, my lord, from his privacy, the great and good\r\nLogodora sent liniment to the hoarse throats without. But what said\r\nBardianna, when they dunned him for autographs?—‘Who keeps the register\r\nof great men? who decides upon noble actions? and how long may ink\r\nlast? Alas! Fame has dropped more rolls than she displays; and there\r\nare more lost chronicles, than the perished books of the historian\r\nLivella.’ But what is lost forever, my lord, is nothing to what is now\r\nunseen. There are more treasures in the bowels of the earth, than on\r\nits surface.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! no gold,” cried Yoomy, “but that comes from dark mines.”\r\n\r\nSaid Babbalanja, “Bear witness, ye gods! cries fervent old Bardianna,\r\nthat besides disclosures of good and evil undreamed of now, there will\r\nbe other, and more astounding revelations hereafter, of what has passed\r\nin Mardi unbeheld.”\r\n\r\n“A truce to your everlasting pratings of old Bardianna,” said King\r\nMedia; why not speak your own thoughts, Babbalanja? then would your\r\ndiscourse possess more completeness; whereas, its warp and woof are of\r\nall sorts,—Bardianna, Alla-Malolla, Vavona, and all the writers that\r\never have written. Speak for yourself, mortal!”\r\n\r\n“May you not possibly mistake, my lord? for I do not so much quote\r\nBardianna, as Bardianna quoted me, though he flourished before me; and\r\nno vanity, but honesty to say so. The catalogue of true thoughts is but\r\nsmall; they are ubiquitous; no man’s property; and unspoken, or\r\nbruited, are the same. When we hear them, why seem they so natural,\r\nreceiving our spontaneous approval? why do we think we have heard them\r\nbefore? Because they but reiterate ourselves; they were in us, before\r\nwe were born. The truest poets are but mouth-pieces; and some men are\r\nduplicates of each other; I see myself in Bardianna.”\r\n\r\n“And there, for Oro’s sake, let it rest, Babbalanja; Bardianna in you,\r\nand you in Bardianna forever!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nWhat Manner Of Men The Tapparians Were\r\n\r\n\r\nThe canoes sailed on. But we leave them awhile. For our visit to Jiji,\r\nthe last visit we made, suggests some further revelations concerning\r\nthe dental money of Mardi.\r\n\r\nEre this, it should have been mentioned, that throughout the\r\nArchipelago, there was a restriction concerning incisors and molars, as\r\nornaments for the person; none but great chiefs, brave warriors, and\r\nmen distinguished by rare intellectual endowments, orators, romancers,\r\nphilosophers, and poets, being permitted to sport them as jewels.\r\nThough, as it happened, among the poets there were many who had never a\r\ntooth, save those employed at their repasts; which, coming but seldom,\r\ntheir teeth almost corroded in their mouths. Hence, in commerce, poets’\r\nteeth were at a discount.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, then, many mortals blent with the promiscuous mob of\r\nMardians, who, by any means, accumulated teeth, were fain to assert\r\ntheir dental claims to distinction, by clumsily carrying their\r\ntreasures in pelican pouches slung over their shoulders; which pouches\r\nwere a huge burden to carry about, and defend. Though, in good truth,\r\nfrom any of these porters, it was harder to wrench his pouches, than\r\nhis limbs. It was also a curious circumstance that at the slightest\r\ncasual touch, these bags seemed to convey a simultaneous thrill to the\r\nowners.\r\n\r\nBesides these porters, there were others, who exchanged their teeth for\r\nrichly stained calabashes, elaborately carved canoes, and more\r\nespecially, for costly robes, and turbans; in which last, many outshone\r\nthe noblest-born nobles. Nevertheless, this answered not the end they\r\nhad in view; some of the crowd only admiring what they wore, and not\r\nthem; breaking out into laudation of the inimitable handiwork of the\r\nartisans of Mardi.\r\n\r\nAnd strange to relate, these artisans themselves often came to be men\r\nof teeth and turbans, sporting their bravery with the best. A\r\ncircumstance, which accounted for the fact, that many of the class\r\nabove alluded to, were considered capital judges of tappa and\r\ntailoring.\r\n\r\nHence, as a general designation, the whole tribe went by the name of\r\nTapparians; otherwise, Men of Tappa.\r\n\r\nNow, many moons ago, according to Braid-Beard, the Tapparians of a\r\ncertain cluster of islands, seeing themselves hopelessly confounded\r\nwith the plebeian race of mortals; such as artificers, honest men,\r\nbread-fruit bakers, and the like; seeing, in short, that nature had\r\ndenied them every inborn mark of distinction; and furthermore, that\r\ntheir external assumptions were derided by so many in Mardi, these\r\nselfsame Tapparians, poor devils, resolved to secede from the rabble;\r\nform themselves into a community of their own; and conventionally pay\r\nthat homage to each other, which universal Mardi could not be prevailed\r\nupon to render to them.\r\n\r\nJointly, they purchased an island, called Pimminee, toward the extreme\r\nwest of the lagoon; and thither they went; and framing a code of laws-\r\n-amazingly arbitrary, considering they themselves were the framers—\r\nsolemnly took the oath of allegiance to the commonwealth thus\r\nestablished. Regarded section by section, this code of laws seemed\r\nexceedingly trivial; but taken together, made a somewhat imposing\r\naggregation of particles.\r\n\r\nBy this code, the minutest things in life were all ordered after a\r\nspecific fashion. More especially one’s dress was legislated upon, to\r\nthe last warp and woof. All girdles must be so many inches in length,\r\nand with such a number of tassels in front. For a violation of this\r\nordinance, before the face of all Mardi, the most dutiful of sons would\r\ncut the most affectionate of fathers.\r\n\r\nNow, though like all Mardi, kings and slaves included, the people of\r\nPimminee had dead dust for grandsires, they seldom reverted to that\r\nfact; for, like all founders of families, they had no family vaults.\r\nNor were they much encumbered by living connections; connections, some\r\nof them appeared to have none. Like poor Logan the last of his tribe,\r\nthey seemed to have monopolized the blood of their race, having never a\r\ncousin to own.\r\n\r\nWherefore it was, that many ignorant Mardians, who had not pushed their\r\ninvestigations into the science of physiology, sagely divined, that the\r\nTapparians must have podded into life like peas, instead of being\r\notherwise indebted for their existence. Certain it is, they had a\r\ncomical way of backing up their social pretensions. When the\r\nrespectability of his clan was mooted, Paivai, one of their bucks,\r\ndisdained all reference to the Dooms-day Book, and the ancients. More\r\nreliable evidence was had. He referred the anxious world to a witness,\r\nstill alive and hearty,—his contemporary tailor; the varlet who cut out\r\nhis tappa doublets, and rejoiced his soul with good fits.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” sighed Babbalanja, “how it quenches in one the thought of\r\nimmortality, to think that these Tapparians too, will hereafter claim\r\neach a niche!”\r\n\r\nBut we rove. Our visit to Pimminee itself, will best make known the\r\nways of its denizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\nTheir Adventures Upon Landing At Pimminee\r\n\r\n\r\nA long sail over, the island of Pimminee came in sight; one dead fiat,\r\nwreathed in a thin, insipid vapor.\r\n\r\n“My lord, why land?” said Babbalanja; “no Yillah is here.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis my humor, Babbalanja.”\r\n\r\nSaid Yoomy, “Taji would leave no isle unexplored.”\r\n\r\nAs we neared the beach, the atmosphere became still closer and more\r\nlanguid. Much did we miss the refreshing balm which breathed in the\r\nfine breezy air of the open lagoon. Of a slender and sickly growth\r\nseemed the trees; in the meadows, the grass grew small and mincing.\r\n\r\nSaid Media, “Taji, from the accounts which Braid-Beard gives, there\r\nmust be much to amuse, in the ways of these Tapparians.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Babbalanja, “their lives are a continual farce,\r\ngratuitously performed for the diversion of Mardi. My lord, perhaps we\r\nhad best doff our dignity, and land among them as persons of lowly\r\ncondition; for then, we shall receive more diversion, though less\r\nhospitality.”\r\n\r\n“A good proposition,” said Media.\r\n\r\nAnd so saying, he put off his robe for one less pretentious.\r\n\r\nAll followed suit; Yoomy doffing turban and sash; and, at last,\r\ncompletely metamorphosed, we looked like Hungarian gipsies.\r\n\r\nVoyaging on, we entered a bay, where numbers of menials were standing\r\nin the water, engaged in washing the carved work of certain fantastic\r\ncanoes, belonging to the Tapparians, their masters.\r\n\r\nLanding at some distance, we followed a path that soon conducted us to\r\na betwisted dwelling of bamboos, where, gently, we knocked for\r\nadmittance. So doing, we were accosted by a servitor, his portliness\r\nall in his calves. Marking our appearance, he monopolized the\r\nthreshold, and gruffly demanded what was wanted.\r\n\r\n“Strangers, kind sir, fatigued with travel, and in need of refreshment\r\nand repose.”\r\n\r\n“Then hence with ye, vagabonds!” and with an emphasis, he closed the\r\nportal in our face.\r\n\r\nSaid Babbalanja, turning, “You perceive, my lord Media, that these\r\nvarlets take after their masters; who feed none but the well-fed, and\r\nhouse none but the well-housed.”\r\n\r\n“Faith! but they furnish most rare entertainment, nevertheless,” cried\r\nMedia. “Ha! ha! Taji, we had missed much, had we missed Pimminee.”\r\n\r\nAs this was said, we observed, at a distance, three menials running\r\nfrom seaward, as if conveying important intelligence.\r\n\r\nHalting here and there, vainly seeking admittance at other habitations,\r\nand receiving nothing but taunts for our pains, we still wandered on;\r\nand at last came upon a village, toward which, those from the sea-side\r\nhad been running.\r\n\r\nAnd now, to our surprise, we were accosted by an eager and servile\r\nthrong.\r\n\r\n“Obsequious varlets,” said Media, “where tarry your masters?”\r\n\r\n“Right royal, and thrice worshipful Lord of Odo, do you take us for our\r\ndomestics? We are Tapparians, may it please your illustrious Highness;\r\nyour most humble and obedient servants. We beseech you, supereminent\r\nSir, condescend to visit our habitations, and partake of our cheer.”\r\n\r\nThen turning upon their attendants, “Away with ye, hounds! and set our\r\ndwellings in order.”\r\n\r\n“How know ye me to be king?” asked Media.\r\n\r\n“Is it not in your serene Highness’s regal port, and eye?”\r\n\r\n“’Twas their menials,” muttered Mohi, “who from the paddlers in charge\r\nof our canoes must have learned who my lord was, and published the\r\ntidings.”\r\n\r\nAfter some further speech, Media made a social surrender of himself to\r\nthe foremost of the Tapparians, one Nimni; who, conducting us to his\r\nabode, with much deference introduced us to a portly old Begum, and\r\nthree slender damsels; his wife and daughters.\r\n\r\nSoon, refreshments appeared:—green and yellow compounds, and divers\r\nenigmatical dainties; besides vegetable liqueurs of a strange and\r\nalarming flavor served in fragile little leaves, folded into cups, and\r\nvery troublesome to handle.\r\n\r\nExcessively thirsty, Babbalanja made bold to inquire for water; which\r\ncalled forth a burst of horror from the old Begum, and minor shrieks\r\nfrom her daughters; who declared, that the beverage to which remote\r\nreference had been made, was far too widely diffused in Mardi, to be at\r\nall esteemed in Pimminee.\r\n\r\n“But though we seldom imbibe it,” said the old Begum, ceremoniously\r\nadjusting her necklace of cowrie-shells, “we occasionally employ it for\r\nmedicinal purposes.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, indeed?” said Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n“But oh! believe me; even then, we imbibe not the ordinary fluid of the\r\nsprings and streams; but that which in afternoon showers softly drains\r\nfrom our palm-trees into the little hollow or miniature reservoir\r\nbeneath its compacted roots.”\r\n\r\nA goblet of this beverage was now handed Babbalanja; but having a\r\ncurious, gummy flavor, it proved any thing but palatable.\r\n\r\nPresently, in came a company of young men, relatives of Nimni. They\r\nwere slender as sky-sail-poles; standing in a row, resembled a\r\npicket-fence; and were surmounted by enormous heads of hair, combed out\r\nall round, variously dyed, and evened by being singed with a lighted\r\nwisp of straw. Like milliners’ parcels, they were very neatly done up;\r\nwearing redolent robes.\r\n\r\n“How like the woodlands they smell,” whispered Yoomy. “Ay, marvelously\r\nlike sap,” said Mohi.\r\n\r\nOne part of their garniture consisted of numerous tasseled cords, like\r\nthose of an aigulette, depending from the neck, and attached here and\r\nthere about the person. A separate one, at a distance, united their\r\nankles. These served to measure and graduate their movements; keeping\r\ntheir gestures, paces, and attitudes, within the prescribed standard of\r\nTapparian gentility. When they went abroad, they were preceded by\r\ncertain footmen; who placed before them small, carved boards, whereon\r\ntheir masters stepped; thus avoiding contact with the earth. The simple\r\ndevice of a shoe, as a fixture for the foot, was unknown in Pimminee.\r\n\r\nBeing told, that Taji was lately from the sun, they manifested not the\r\nslightest surprise; one of them incidentally observing, however, that\r\nthe eclipses there, must be a sad bore to endure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\nA, I, AND O\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old Begum went by the euphonious appellation of\r\nOhiro-Moldona-Fivona; a name, from its length, deemed highly genteel;\r\nthough scandal averred, that it was nothing more than her real name\r\ntransposed; the appellation by which she had been formerly known,\r\nsignifying a “Getterup-of-Fine-Tappa.” But as this would have let out\r\nan ancient secret, it was thought wise to disguise it.\r\n\r\nHer daughters respectively reveled in the pretty diminutives of A, I,\r\nand O; which, from their brevity, comical to tell, were considered\r\nequally genteel with the dame’s.\r\n\r\nThe habiliments of the three Vowels must not be omitted. Each damsel\r\ngarrisoned an ample, circular farthingale of canes, serving as the\r\nframe-work, whereon to display a gayly dyed robe. Perhaps their charms\r\nintrenched themselves in these impregnable petticoats, as feeble armies\r\nfly to fortresses, to hide their weakness, and better resist an onset.\r\n\r\nBut polite and politic it is, to propitiate your hostess. So seating\r\nhimself by the Begum, Taji led off with earnest inquiries after her\r\nwelfare. But the Begum was one of those, who relieve the diffident from\r\nthe embarrassment of talking; all by themselves carrying on\r\nconversation for two. Hence, no wonder that my Lady was esteemed\r\ninvaluable at all assemblies in the groves of Pimminee; contributing so\r\nlargely to that incessant din, which is held the best test of the\r\nenjoyment of the company, as making them deaf to the general nonsense,\r\notherwise audible.\r\n\r\nLearning that Taji had been making the tour of certain islands in\r\nMardi, the Begum was surprised that he could have thus hazarded his\r\nlife among the barbarians of the East. She desired to know whether his\r\nconstitution was not impaired by inhaling the unrefined atmosphere of\r\nthose remote and barbarous regions. For her part, the mere thought of\r\nit made her faint in her innermost citadel; nor went she ever abroad\r\nwith the wind at East, dreading the contagion which might lurk in the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nUpon accosting the three damsels, Taji very soon discovered that the\r\ntongue which had languished in the presence of the Begum, was now\r\ncalled into active requisition, to entertain the Polysyllables, her\r\ndaughters. So assiduously were they occupied in silent endeavors to\r\nlook sentimental and pretty, that it proved no easy task to sustain\r\nwith them an ordinary chat. In this dilemma, Taji diffused not his\r\nremarks among all three; but discreetly centered them upon O. Thinking\r\nshe might be curious concerning the sun, he made some remote allusion\r\nto that luminary as the place of his nativity. Upon which, O inquired\r\nwhere that country was, of which mention was made.\r\n\r\n“Some distance from here; in the air above; the sun that gives light to\r\nPimminee, and Mardi at large.”\r\n\r\nShe replied, that if that were the case, she had never beheld it; for\r\nsuch was the construction of her farthingale, that her head could not\r\nbe thrown back, without impairing its set. Wherefore, she had always\r\nabstained from astronomical investigations.\r\n\r\nHereupon, rude Mohi laughed out. And that lucky laugh happily relieved\r\nTaji from all further necessity of entertaining the Vowels. For at so\r\nvulgar, and in Pimminee, so unwonted a sound, as a genuine laugh, the\r\nthree startled nymphs fainted away in a row, their round farthingales\r\nfalling over upon each other, like a file of empty tierces. But they\r\npresently revived.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, without stirring from their mats, the polite young bucks in\r\nthe aigulettes did nothing but hold semi-transparent leaves to their\r\neyes, by the stems; which leaves they directed downward, toward the\r\ndisordered hems of the farthingales; in wait, perhaps, for the\r\nrevelation of an ankle, and its accompaniments. What the precise use of\r\nthese leaves could have been, it would be hard to say, especially as\r\nthe observers invariably peeped over and under them.\r\n\r\nThe calamity of the Vowels was soon followed by the breaking up of the\r\nparty; when, evening coming on, and feeling much wearied with the labor\r\nof seeing company in Pimminee, we retired to our mats; there finding\r\nthat repose which ever awaits the fatigued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\nA Reception-Day At Pimminee\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning, Nimni apprized us, that throughout the day he proposed\r\nkeeping open house, for the purpose of enabling us to behold whatever\r\nof beauty, rank, and fashion, Pimminee could boast; including certain\r\nstrangers of note from various quarters of the lagoon, who doubtless\r\nwould honor themselves with a call.\r\n\r\nAs inmates of the mansion, we unexpectedly had a rare opportunity of\r\nwitnessing the final toilets of the Begum and her daughters,\r\npreparatory to receiving their guests.\r\n\r\nTheir four farthingales were placed standing in the middle of the\r\ndwelling; when their future inmates, arrayed in rudimental vestments,\r\nwent round and round them, attaching various articles of finery, dyed\r\nscarfs, ivory trinkets, and other decorations. Upon the propriety of\r\nthis or that adornment, the three Vowels now and then pondered apart,\r\nor together consulted. They talked and they laughed; they were silent\r\nand sad; now merry at their bravery; now pensive at the thought of the\r\ncharms to be hidden.\r\n\r\nIt was O who presently suggested the expediency of an artful fold in\r\ntheir draperies, by the merest accident in Mardi, to reveal a\r\ntantalizing glimpse of their ankles, which were thought to be pretty.\r\n\r\nBut the old Begum was more active than any; by far the most\r\ndisinterested in the matter of advice. Her great object seemed to be to\r\npile on the finery at all hazards; and she pointed out many as yet\r\nvacant and unappropriated spaces, highly susceptible of adornment.\r\n\r\nAt last, all was in readiness; when, taking a valedictory glance, at\r\ntheir intrenchments, the Begum and damsels simultaneously dipped their\r\nheads, directly after emerging from the summit, all ready for\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nAnd now to describe the general reception that followed. In came the\r\nRoes, the Fees, the Lol-Lols, the Hummee-Hums, the Bidi-Bidies, and the\r\nDedidums; the Peenees, the Yamoyamees, the Karkies, the Fanfums, the\r\nDiddledees, and the Fiddlefies; in a word, all the aristocracy of\r\nPimminee; people with exceedingly short names; and some all name, and\r\nnothing else. It was an imposing array of sounds; a circulation of\r\nciphers; a marshaling of tappas; a getting together of grimaces and\r\nfurbelows; a masquerade of vapidities.\r\n\r\nAmong the crowd was a bustling somebody, one Gaddi, arrayed in much\r\napparel to little purpose; who, singling out Babbalanja, for some time\r\nadhered to his side, and with excessive complaisance, enlightened him\r\nas to the people assembled.\r\n\r\n“_That_ is rich Marmonora, accounted a mighty man in Pimminee; his bags\r\nof teeth included, he is said to weigh upwards of fourteen stone; and\r\nis much sought after by tailors for his measure, being but slender in\r\nthe region of the heart. His riches are great. And that old vrow is the\r\nwidow Roo; very rich; plenty of teeth; but has none in her head. And\r\n_this_ is Finfi; said to be not very rich, and a maid. Who would\r\nsuppose she had ever beat tappa for a living?”\r\n\r\nAnd so saying, Gaddi sauntered off; his place by Babbalanja’s side\r\nbeing immediately supplied by the damsel Finfi. That vivacious and\r\namiable nymph at once proceeded to point out the company, where Gaddi\r\nhad left off; beginning with Gaddi himself, who, she insinuated, was a\r\nmere parvenu, a terrible infliction upon society, and not near so rich\r\nas he was imagined to be.\r\n\r\nSoon we were accosted by one Nonno, a sour, saturnine personage. “I\r\nknow nobody here; not a soul have I seen before; I wonder who they all\r\nare.” And just then he was familiarly nodded to by nine worthies\r\nabreast. Whereupon Nonno vanished. But after going the rounds of the\r\ncompany, and paying court to many, he again sauntered by Babbalanja,\r\nsaying, “Nobody, nobody; nobody but nobodies; I see nobody I know.”\r\n\r\nAdvancing, Nimni now introduced many strangers of distinction, parading\r\ntheir titles after a fashion, plainly signifying that he was bent upon\r\nconvincing us, that there were people present at this little affair of\r\nhis, who were men of vast reputation; and that we erred, if we deemed\r\nhim unaccustomed to the society of the illustrious.\r\n\r\nBut not a few of his magnates seemed shy of Media and their laurels.\r\nEspecially a tall robustuous fellow, with a terrible javelin in his\r\nhand, much notched and splintered, as if it had dealt many a thrust.\r\nHis left arm was gallanted in a sling, and there was a patch upon his\r\nsinister eye. Him Nimni made known as a famous captain, from King\r\nPiko’s island (of which anon) who had been all but mortally wounded\r\nsomewhere, in a late desperate though nameless encounter.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Media as this redoubtable withdrew, Fofi is a cunning knave;\r\na braggart, driven forth, by King Piko for his cowardice. He has blent\r\nhis tattooing into one mass of blue, and thus disguised, must have\r\npalmed himself off here in Pimminee, for the man he is not. But I see\r\nmany more like him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh ye Tapparians,” said Babbalanja, “none so easily humbugged as\r\nhumbugs. Taji: to behold this folly makes one wise. Look, look; it is\r\nall round us. Oh Pimminee, Pimminee!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\nBabbalanja Falleth Upon Pimminee Tooth And Nail\r\n\r\n\r\nThe levee over, waiving further civilities, we took courteus leave of\r\nthe Begum and Nimni, and proceeding to the beach, very soon were\r\nembarked.\r\n\r\nWhen all were pleasantly seated beneath the canopy, pipes in full\r\nblast, calabashes revolving, and the paddlers quietly urging us along,\r\nMedia proposed that, for the benefit of the company, some one present,\r\nin a pithy, whiffy sentence or two, should sum up the character of the\r\nTapparians; and ended by nominating Babbalanja to that office.\r\n\r\n“Come, philosopher: let us see in how few syllables you can put the\r\nbrand on those Tapparians.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, my lord, but you must permit me to ponder awhile; nothing\r\nrequires more time, than to be brief. An example: they say that in\r\nconversation old Bardianna dealt in nothing but trisyllabic sentences.\r\nHis talk was thunder peals: sounding reports, but long intervals.”\r\n\r\n“The devil take old Bardianna. And would that the grave-digger had\r\nburied his Ponderings, along with his other remains. Can none be in\r\nyour company, Babbalanja, but you must perforce make them hob-a-nob\r\nwith that old prater? A brand for the Tapparians! that is what we\r\nseek.”\r\n\r\n“You shall have it, my lord. Full to the brim of themselves, for that\r\nreason, the Tapparians are the emptiest of mortals.”\r\n\r\n“A good blow and well planted, Babbalanja.”\r\n\r\n“In sooth, a most excellent saying; it should be carved upon his\r\ntombstone,” said Mohi, slowly withdrawing his pipe.\r\n\r\n“What! would you have my epitaph read thus:—‘Here lies the emptiest of\r\nmortals, who was full of himself?’ At best, your words are exceedingly\r\nambiguous, Mohi.”\r\n\r\n“Now have I the philosopher,” cried Yoomy, with glee. “What did some\r\none say to me, not long since, Babbalanja, when in the matter of that\r\nsleepy song of mine, Braid-Beard bestowed upon me an equivocal\r\ncompliment? Was I not told to wrest commendation from it, though I\r\ntortured it to the quick?”\r\n\r\n“Take thy own pills, philosopher,” said Mohi.\r\n\r\n“Then would he be a great original,” said Media.\r\n\r\n“Tell me, Yoomy,” said Babbalanja, “are you not in fault? Because I\r\nsometimes speak wisely, you must not imagine that I should always act\r\nso.”\r\n\r\n“I never imagined that,” said Yoomy, “and, if I did, the truth would\r\nbelie me. It is you who are in fault, Babbalanja; not I, craving your\r\npardon.”\r\n\r\n“The minstrel’s sides are all edges to-day,” said Media.\r\n\r\n“This, then, thrice gentle Yoomy, is what I would say;” resumed\r\nBabbalanja, “that since we philosophers bestow so much wisdom upon\r\nothers, it is not to be wondered at, if now and then we find what is\r\nleft in us too small for our necessities. It is from our very abundance\r\nthat we want.”\r\n\r\n“And from the fool’s poverty,” said Media, “that he is opulent; for his\r\nvery simplicity, is sometimes of more account than the wisdom of the\r\nsage. But we were discoursing of the Tapparians. Babbalanja:\r\nsententiously you have acquitted yourself to admiration; now amplify,\r\nand tell us more of the people of Pimminee.”\r\n\r\n“My lord, I might amplify forever.”\r\n\r\n“Then, my worshipful lord, let him not begin,” interposed Braid-Beard.\r\n\r\n“I mean,” said Babbalanja, “that all subjects are inexhaustible,\r\nhowever trivial; as the mathematical point, put in motion, is capable\r\nof being produced into an infinite line.”\r\n\r\n“But forever extending into nothing,” said Media. “A very bad example\r\nto follow. Do you, Babbalanja, come to the point, and not travel off\r\nwith it, which is too much your wont.”\r\n\r\n“Since my lord insists upon it then, thus much for the Tapparians,\r\nthough but a thought or two of many in reserve. They ignore the rest of\r\nMardi, while they themselves are but a rumor in the isles of the East;\r\nwhere the business of living and dying goes on with the same\r\nuniformity, as if there were no Tapparians in existence. They think\r\nthemselves Mardi in full; whereas, by the mass, they are stared at as\r\nprodigies; exceptions to the law, ordaining that no Mardian shall\r\nundertake to live, unless he set out with at least the average quantity\r\nof brains. For these Tapparians have no brains. In lieu, they carry in\r\none corner of their craniums, a drop or two of attar of roses; charily\r\nused, the supply being small. They are the victims of two incurable\r\nmaladies: stone in the heart, and ossification of the head. They are\r\nfull of fripperies, fopperies, and finesses; knowing not, that nature\r\nshould be the model of art. Yet, they might appear less silly than they\r\ndo, were they content to be the plain idiots which at bottom they are.\r\nFor there be grains of sense in a simpleton, so long as he be natural.\r\nBut what can be expected from them? They are irreclaimable Tapparians;\r\nnot so much fools by contrivance of their own, as by an express, though\r\ninscrutable decree of Oro’s. For one, my lord, I can not abide them.”\r\n\r\nNor could Taji.\r\n\r\nIn Pimminee were no hilarious running and shouting: none of the royal\r\ngood cheer of old Borabolla; none of the mysteries of Maramma; none of\r\nthe sentiment and romance of Donjalolo; no rehearsing of old legends:\r\nno singing of old songs; no life; no jolly commotion: in short, no men\r\nand women; nothing but their integuments; stiff trains and\r\nfarthingales.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\nBabbalanja Regales The Company With Some Sandwiches\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was night. But the moon was brilliant, far and near illuminating the\r\nlagoon.\r\n\r\nOver silvery billows we glided.\r\n\r\n“Come Yoomy,” said Media, “moonlight and music for aye—a song! a song!\r\nmy bird of paradise.”\r\n\r\nAnd folding his arms, and watching the sparkling waters, thus Yoomy\r\nsang:—\r\n\r\nA ray of the moon on the dancing waves\r\n    Is the step, light step of that beautiful maid:\r\nMardi, with music, her footfall paves,\r\n    And her voice, no voice, but a song in the glade.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Hold!” cried Media, “yonder is a curious rock. It looks black as a\r\nwhale’s hump in blue water, when the sun shines.”\r\n\r\n“That must be the Isle of Fossils,” said Mohi. “Ay, my lord, it is.”\r\n\r\n“Let us land, then,” said Babbalanja.\r\n\r\nAnd none dissenting, the canoes were put about, and presently we\r\ndebarked.\r\n\r\nIt was a dome-like surface, here and there fringed with ferns,\r\nsprouting from clefts. But at every tide the thin soil seemed gradually\r\nwashing into the lagoon.\r\n\r\nLike antique tablets, the smoother parts were molded in strange\r\ndevices:—Luxor marks, Tadmor ciphers, Palenque inscriptions. In long\r\nlines, as on Denderah’s architraves, were bas-reliefs of beetles,\r\nturtles, ant-eaters, armadilloes, guanos, serpents, tongueless\r\ncrocodiles:—a long procession, frosted and crystalized in stone, and\r\nsilvered by the moon.\r\n\r\n“Strange sight!” cried Media. “Speak, antiquarian Mohi.”\r\n\r\nBut the chronicler was twitching his antiquarian beard, nonplussed by\r\nthese wondrous records. The cowled old father, Piaggi, bending over his\r\ncalcined Herculanean manuscripts, looked not more at fault than he.\r\n\r\nSaid Media, “Expound you, then, sage Babbalanja.” Muffling his face in\r\nhis mantle, and his voice in sepulchral tones, Babbalanja thus:—\r\n\r\n“These are the leaves of the book of Oro. Here we read how worlds are\r\nmade; here read the rise and fall of Nature’s kingdoms. From where this\r\nold man’s furthest histories start, these unbeginning records end.\r\nThese are the secret memoirs of times past; whose evidence, at last\r\ndivulged, gives the grim lie to Mohi’s gossipings, and makes a rattling\r\namong the dry-bone relics of old Maramma.”\r\n\r\nBraid-Beard’s old eyes flashed fire. With bristling beard, he cried,\r\n“Take back the lie you send!”\r\n\r\n“Peace! everlasting foes,” cried Media, interposing, with both arms\r\noutstretched. “Philosopher, probe not too deep. All you say is very\r\nfine, but very dark. I would know something more precise. But, prithee,\r\nghost, unmuffle! chatter no more! wait till you’re buried for that.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, death’s cold ague will set us all shivering, my lord. We’ll swear\r\nour teeth are icicles.”\r\n\r\n“Will you quit driving your sleet upon us? have done expound these\r\nrocks.”\r\n\r\n“My lord, if you desire, I’ll turn over these stone tablets till\r\nthey’re dog-eared.”\r\n\r\n“Heaven and Mardi!—Go on, Babbalanja.”\r\n\r\n“’Twas thus. These were tombs burst open by volcanic throes; and hither\r\nhurled from the lowermost vaults of the lagoon. All Mardi’s rocks are\r\none wide resurrection. But look. Here, now, a pretty story’s told. Ah,\r\nlittle thought these grand old lords, that lived and roared before the\r\nflood, that they would come to this. Here, King Media, look and learn.”\r\n\r\nHe looked; and saw a picture petrified, and plain as any on the\r\npediments of Petra.\r\n\r\nIt seemed a stately banquet of the dead, where lords in skeletons were\r\nranged around a board heaped up with fossil fruits, and flanked with\r\nvitreous vases, grinning like empty skulls. There they sat, exchanging\r\nrigid courtesies. One’s hand was on his stony heart; his other pledged\r\na lord who held a hollow beaker. Another sat, with earnest face beneath\r\na mitred brow. He seemed to whisper in the ear of one who listened\r\ntrustingly. But on the chest of him who wore the miter, an adder lay,\r\nclose-coiled in flint.\r\n\r\nAt the further end, was raised a throne, its canopy surmounted by a\r\ncrown, in which now rested the likeness of a raven on an egg.\r\n\r\nThe throne was void. But half-concealed by drapery, behind the\r\ngoodliest lord, sideway leaned a figure diademed, a lifted poniard in\r\nits hand:—a monarch fossilized in very act of murdering his guest.\r\n\r\n“Most high and sacred majesty!” cried Babbalanja, bowing to his feet.\r\n\r\nWhile all stood gazing on this sight, there came two servitors of\r\nMedia’s, who besought of Babbalanja to settle a dispute, concerning\r\ncertain tracings upon the islet’s other side.\r\n\r\nThither we followed them.\r\n\r\nUpon a long layer of the slaty stone were marks of ripplings of some\r\nnow waveless sea; mid which were tri-toed footprints of some huge\r\nheron, or wading fowl.\r\n\r\nPointing to one of which, the foremost disputant thus spoke:—“I\r\nmaintain that these are three toes.”\r\n\r\n“And I, that it is one foot,” said the other.\r\n\r\n“And now decide between us,” joined the twain.\r\n\r\nSaid Babbalanja, starting, “Is not this the very question concerning\r\nwhich they made such dire contention in Maramma, whose tertiary rocks\r\nare chisseled all over with these marks? Yes; this it is, concerning\r\nwhich they once shed blood. This it is, concerning which they still\r\ndivide.”\r\n\r\n“Which of us is right?” again demanded the impatient twain.\r\n\r\n“Unite, and both are right; divide, and both are wrong. Every unit is\r\nmade up of parts, as well as every plurality. Nine is three threes; a\r\nunit is as many thirds; or, if you please, a thousand thousandths; no\r\nspecial need to stop at thirds.”\r\n\r\n“Away, ye foolish disputants!” cried Media. “Full before you is the\r\nthing disputed.”\r\n\r\nStrolling on, many marvels did we mark; and Media said:—“Babbalanja,\r\nyou love all mysteries; here’s a fitting theme. You have given us the\r\nhistory of the rock; can your sapience tell the origin of all the\r\nisles? how Mardi came to be?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, that once mooted point is settled. Though hard at first, it proved\r\na bagatelle. Start not my lord; there are those who have measured Mardi\r\nby perch and pole, and with their wonted lead sounded its utmost\r\ndepths. Listen: it is a pleasant story. The coral wall which\r\ncircumscribes the isles but continues upward the deep buried crater of\r\nthe primal chaos. In the first times this crucible was charged with\r\nvapors nebulous, boiling over fires volcanic. Age by age, the fluid\r\nthickened; dropping, at long intervals, heavy sediment to the bottom;\r\nwhich layer on layer concreted, and at length, in crusts, rose toward\r\nthe surface. Then, the vast volcano burst; rent the whole mass; upthrew\r\nthe ancient rocks; which now in divers mountain tops tell tales of what\r\nexisted ere Mardi was completely fashioned. Hence many fossils on the\r\nhills, whose kith and kin still lurk beneath the vales. Thus Nature\r\nworks, at random warring, chaos a crater, and this world a shell.”\r\n\r\nMohi stroked his beard.\r\n\r\nYoomy yawned.\r\n\r\nMedia cried, “Preposterous!”\r\n\r\n“My lord, then take another theory—which you will—the celebrated\r\nsandwich System. Nature’s first condition was a soup, wherein the\r\nagglomerating solids formed granitic dumplings, which, wearing down,\r\ndeposited the primal stratum made up of series, sandwiching strange\r\nshapes of mollusks, and zoophytes; then snails, and periwinkles:—\r\nmarmalade to sip, and nuts to crack, ere the substantials came.\r\n\r\n“And next, my lord, we have the fine old time of the Old Red Sandstone\r\nsandwich, clapped on the underlying layer, and among other dainties,\r\nimbedding the first course of fish,—all quite in rule,—sturgeon- forms,\r\ncephalaspis, glyptolepis, pterichthys; and other finny things, of\r\nflavor rare, but hard to mouth for bones. Served up with these, were\r\nsundry greens,—lichens, mosses, ferns, and fungi.\r\n\r\n“Now comes the New Red Sandstone sandwich: marly and magnesious, spread\r\nover with old patriarchs of crocodiles and alligators,—hard carving\r\nthese,—and prodigious lizards, spine-skewered, tails tied in bows, and\r\nswimming in saffron saucers.”\r\n\r\n“What next?” cried Media.\r\n\r\n“The Ool, or Oily sandwich:—rare gormandizing then; for oily it was\r\ncalled, because of fat old joints, and hams, and rounds, and barons of\r\nsea-beeves and walrusses, which then crowned the stratum-board. All\r\npiled together, glorious profusion!—fillets and briskets, rumps, and\r\nsaddles, and haunches; shoulder to shoulder, loin ’gainst sirloin, ribs\r\nrapping knuckles, and quarter to none. And all these sandwiched right\r\nover all that went before. Course after course, and course on course,\r\nmy lord; no time to clear the wreck; no stop nor let; lay on and slash;\r\ncut, thrust, and come.\r\n\r\n“Next the Chalk, or Coral sandwich; but no dry fare for that; made up\r\nof rich side-courses,—eocene, miocene, and pliocene. The first was wild\r\ngame for the delicate,—bantam larks, curlews, quails, and flying\r\nweazels; with a slight sprinkling of pilaus,—capons, pullets, plovers,\r\nand garnished with petrels’ eggs. Very savory, that, my lord. The\r\nsecond side-course—miocene—was out of course, flesh after fowl: marine\r\nmammalia,—seals, grampuses, and whales, served up with sea-weed on\r\ntheir flanks, hearts and kidneys deviled, and fins and flippers\r\nfriccasied. All very thee, my lord. The third side-course, the\r\npliocene, was goodliest of all:—whole-roasted elephants, rhinoceroses,\r\nand hippopotamuses, stuffed with boiled ostriches, condors,\r\ncassowaries, turkeys. Also barbacued mastodons and megatheriums,\r\ngallantly served up with fir-trees in their mouths, and tails\r\ncock-billed.\r\n\r\n“Thus fared the old diluvians: arrant gormandizers and beef-bolters. We\r\nMardians famish on the superficial strata of deposits; cracking our\r\njaws on walnuts, filberts, cocoa-nuts, and clams. My lord, I’ve done.”\r\n\r\n“And bravely done it is. Mohi tells us, that Mardi was made in six\r\ndays; but you, Babbalanja, have built it up from the bottom in less\r\nthan six minutes.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing for us geologists, my lord. At a word we turn you out whole\r\nsystems, suns, satellites, and asteroids included. Why, my good lord,\r\nmy friend Annonimo is laying out a new Milky Way, to intersect with the\r\nold one, and facilitate cross-cuts among the comets.”\r\n\r\nAnd so saying, Babbalanja turned aside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\nThey Still Remain Upon The Rock\r\n\r\n\r\n“Gogle-goggle, fugle-fi, fugle-fogle-orum,” so hummed to himself\r\nBabbalanja, slowly pacing over the fossils. “Is he crazy again?”\r\nwhispered Yoomy.\r\n\r\n“Are you crazy, Babbalanja?” asked Media.\r\n\r\n“From my very birth have I been so, my lord; am I not possessed by a\r\ndevil?”\r\n\r\n“Then I’ll e’en interrogate him,” cried Media. “—Hark ye, sirrah;— why\r\nrave you thus in this poor mortal?”\r\n\r\n“’Tis he, not I. I am the mildest devil that ever entered man; in\r\npropria persona, no antlers do I wear; my tail has lost its barb, as at\r\nlast your Mardian lions lose their caudal horns.”\r\n\r\n“A very sing-song devil this. But, prithee, who are you, sirrah?”\r\n\r\n“The mildest devil that ever entered man; in propria persona, no\r\nantlers do I wear; my tail has lost its barb, as at last your Mardian\r\nlions lose their caudal horns.”\r\n\r\n“A very iterating devil this. Sirrah! mock me not. Know you aught yet\r\nunrevealed by Babbalanja?”\r\n\r\n“Many things I know, not good to tell; whence they call me Azzageddi.”\r\n\r\n“A very confidential devil, this; that tells no secrets. Azzageddi, can\r\nI drive thee out?”\r\n\r\n“Only with this mortal’s ghost:—together we came in, together we\r\ndepart.”\r\n\r\n“A very terse, and ready devil, this. Whence come you, Azzageddi?”\r\n\r\n“Whither my catechist must go—a torrid clime, cut by a hot equator.”\r\n\r\n“A very keen, and witty devil, this. Azzageddi, whom have you there?”\r\n\r\n“A right down merry, jolly set, that at a roaring furnace sit and toast\r\ntheir hoofs for aye; so used to flames, they poke the fire with their\r\nhorns, and light their tails for torches.”\r\n\r\n“A very funny devil, this. Azzageddi, is not Mardi a place far\r\npleasanter, than that from whence you came?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, home! sweet, sweet, home! would, would that I were home again!”\r\n\r\n“A very sentimental devil, this. Azzageddi, would you had a hand, I’d\r\nshake it.”\r\n\r\n“Not so with us; who, rear to rear, shake each other’s tails, and\r\ncourteously inquire, ‘Pray, worthy sir, how now stands the great\r\nthermometer?’”\r\n\r\n“The very prince of devils, this.”\r\n\r\n“How mad our Babbalanja is,” cried Mohi. My lord, take heed; he’ll\r\nbite.”\r\n\r\n“Alas! alas!” sighed Yoomy.\r\n\r\n“Hark ye, Babbalanja,” cried Media, “enough of this: doff your devil,\r\nand be a man.”\r\n\r\n“My lord, I can not doff him; but I’ll down him for a time: Azzageddi!\r\ndown, imp; down, down, down! so: now, my lord, I’m only Babbalanja.”\r\n\r\n“Shall I test his sanity, my lord?” cried Mohi.\r\n\r\n“Do, old man.”\r\n\r\n“Philosopher, our great reef is surrounded by an ocean; what think you\r\nlies beyond?”\r\n\r\n“Alas!” sighed Yoomy, “the very subject to renew his madness.”\r\n\r\n“Peace, minstrel!” said Media. “Answer, Babbalanja.”\r\n\r\n“I will, my lord. Fear not, sweet Yoomy; you see how calm I am. Braid-\r\nBeard, those strangers, that came to Mondoldo prove isles afar, as a\r\nphilosopher of old surmised, but was hooted at for his surmisings. Nor\r\nis it at all impossible, Braid-Beard, that beyond their land may exist\r\nother regions, of which those strangers know not; peopled with races\r\nsomething like us Mardians; but perhaps with more exalted faculties,\r\nand organs that we lack. They may have some better seeing sense than\r\nours; perhaps, have fins or wings for arms.”\r\n\r\n“This seems not like sanity,” muttered Mohi.\r\n\r\n“A most crazy hypothesis, truly,” said Media.\r\n\r\n“And are all inductions vain?” cried Babbalanja. “Have we mortals\r\nnaught to rest on, but what we see with eyes? Is no faith to be reposed\r\nin that inner microcosm, wherein we see the charted universe in little,\r\nas the whole horizon is mirrored in the iris of a gnat? Alas! alas! my\r\nlord, is there no blest Odonphi? no Astrazzi?”\r\n\r\n“His devil’s uppermost again, my lord,” cried Braid-Beard.\r\n\r\n“He’s stark, stark mad!” sighed Yoomy.\r\n\r\n“Ay, the moon’s at full,” said Media. “Ho, paddlers! we depart.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\nBehind And Before\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was yet moonlight when we pushed from the islet. But soon, the sky\r\ngrew dun; the moon went into a cavern among the clouds; and by that\r\nsecret sympathy between our hearts and the elements, the thoughts of\r\nall but Media became overcast.\r\n\r\nAgain discourse was had of that dark intelligence from Mondoldo,—the\r\nfell murder of Taji’s follower.\r\n\r\nSaid Mohi, “Those specter sons of Aleema must have been the assassins.”\r\n\r\n“They harbored deadly malice,” said Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n“Which poor Jarl’s death must now have sated,” sighed Yoomy.\r\n\r\n“Then all the happier for Taji,” said Media. “But away with gloom!\r\nbecause the sky is clouded, why cloud your brows? Babbalanja, I grieve\r\nthe moon is gone. Yet start some paradox, that we may laugh. Say a\r\nwoman is a man, or you yourself a stork.”\r\n\r\nAt this they smiled. When hurtling came an arrow, which struck our\r\nstern, and quivered. Another! and another! Grazing the canopy, they\r\ndarted by, and hissing, dived like red-hot bars beneath the waves.\r\n\r\nStarting, we beheld a corruscating wake, tracking the course of a low\r\ncanoe, far flying for a neighboring mountain. The next moment it was\r\nlost within the mountain’s shadow and pursuit was useless.\r\n\r\n“Let us fly!” cried Yoomy\r\n\r\n“Peace! What murderers these?” said Media, calmly; “whom can they\r\nseek?—you, Taji?”\r\n\r\n“The three avengers fly three bolts,” said Babbalanja. “See if the\r\narrow yet remain astern,” cried Media.\r\n\r\nThey brought it to him.\r\n\r\n“By Oro! Taji on the barb!”\r\n\r\n“Then it missed its aim. But I will not mine. And whatever arrows\r\nfollow, still will I hunt on. Nor does the ghost, that these pale\r\nspecters would avenge, at all disquiet me. The priest I slew, but to\r\ngain her, now lost; and I would slay again, to bring her back. Ah,\r\nYillah! Yillah.”\r\n\r\nAll started.\r\n\r\nThen said Babbalanja, “Aleema’s sons raved not; ’tis true, then, Taji,\r\nthat an evil deed gained you your Yillah: no wonder she is lost.”\r\n\r\nSaid Media, unconcernedly, “Perhaps better, Taji, to have kept your\r\nsecret; but tell no more; I care not to be your foe.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, Taji! I had shrank from you,” cried Yoomy, “but for the mark upon\r\nyour brow. That undoes the tenor of your words. But look, the stars\r\ncome forth, and who are these? A waving Iris! ay, again they come:—\r\nHautia’s heralds!”\r\n\r\nThey brought a black thorn, buried in withered rose-balm blossoms, red\r\nand blue.\r\n\r\nSaid Yoomy, “For that which stings, there is no cure,”\r\n\r\n“Who, who is Hautia, that she stabs me thus?”\r\n\r\n“And this wild sardony mocks your misery.”\r\n\r\n“Away! ye fiends.”\r\n\r\n“Again a Venus car; and lo! a wreath of strawberries!—Yet fly to me,\r\nand be garlanded with joys.”\r\n\r\n“Let the wild witch laugh. She moves me not. Neither hurtling arrows\r\nnor Circe flowers appall.”\r\n\r\nSaid Yoomy, “They wait reply.”\r\n\r\n“Tell your Hautia, that I know her not; nor care to know. I defy her\r\nincantations; she lures in vain. Yillah! Yillah! still I hope!”\r\n\r\nSlowly they departed; heeding not my cries no more to follow.\r\n\r\nSilence, and darkness fell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\nBabbalanja Discourses In The Dark\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day came and went; and still we onward sailed. At last, by night,\r\nthere fell a calm, becalming the water of the wide lagoon, and\r\nbecalming all the clouds in heaven, wailing the constellations. But\r\nthough our sails were useless, our paddlers plied their broad stout\r\nblades. Thus sweeping by a rent and hoar old rock, Vee-Vee, impatient\r\nof the calm, sprang to his crow’s nest in the shark’s mouth, and\r\nseizing his conch, sounded a blast which ran in and out among the\r\nhollows, reverberating with the echoes.\r\n\r\nBe sure, it was startling. But more so with respect to one of our\r\npaddlers, upon whose shoulders, elevated Vee-Vee, his balance lost, all\r\nat once came down by the run. But the heedless little bugler himself\r\nwas most injured by the fall; his arm nearly being broken.\r\n\r\nSome remedies applied, and the company grown composed, Babbalanja\r\nthus:—“My lord Media, was there any human necessity for that accident?”\r\n\r\n“None that I know, or care to tell, Babbalanja.”\r\n\r\n“Vee-Vee,” said Babbalanja, “did you fall on purpose?”\r\n\r\n“Not I,” sobbed little Vee-Vee, slinging his ailing arm in its mate.\r\n\r\n“Woe! woe to us all, then,” cried Babbalanja; “for what direful events\r\nmay be in store for us which we can not avoid.”\r\n\r\n“How now, mortal?” cried Media; “what now?”\r\n\r\n“My lord, think of it. Minus human inducement from without, and minus\r\nvolition from within, Vee-Vee has met with an accident, which has\r\nalmost maimed him for life. Is it not terrifying to think of? Are not\r\nall mortals exposed to similar, nay, worse calamities, ineffably\r\nunavoidable? Woe, woe, I say, to us Mardians! Here, take my last\r\nbreath; let me give up this beggarly ghost!”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” said Media; “pause, Babbalanja. Turn it not adrift prematurely.\r\nLet it house till midnight; the proper time for you mortals to\r\ndissolve. But, philosopher, if you harp upon Vee-Vee’s mishap, know\r\nthat it was owing to nothing but his carelessness.”\r\n\r\n“And what was that owing to, my lord?”\r\n\r\n“To Vee-Vee himself.”\r\n\r\n“Then, my lord, what brought such a careless being into Mardi?”\r\n\r\n“A long course of generations. He’s some one’s great-great-grandson,\r\ndoubtless; who was great-great-grandson to some one else; who also had\r\ngrandsires.”\r\n\r\n“Many thanks then to your highness; for you establish the doctrine of\r\nPhilosophical Necessity.”\r\n\r\n“No. I establish nothing; I but answer your questions.”\r\n\r\n“All one, my lord: you are a Necessitarian; in other words, you hold\r\nthat every thing takes place through absolute necessity.”\r\n\r\n“Do you take me, then, for a fool, and a Fatalist? Pardie! a bad creed\r\nfor a monarch, the distributor of rewards and punishments.”\r\n\r\n“Right there, my lord. But, for all that, your highness is a\r\nNecessitarian, yet no Fatalist. Confound not the distinct. Fatalism\r\npresumes express and irrevocable edicts of heaven concerning particular\r\nevents. Whereas, Necessity holds that all events are naturally linked,\r\nand inevitably follow each other, without providential interposition,\r\nthough by the eternal letting of Providence.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well, Babbalanja, I grant it all. Go on.”\r\n\r\n“On high authority, we are told that in times past the fall of certain\r\nnations in Mardi was prophesied of seers.”\r\n\r\n“Most true, my lord,” said Mohi; “it is all down in the chronicles.”\r\n\r\n“Ha! ha!” cried Media. “Go on, philosopher.”\r\n\r\nContinued Babbalanja, “Previous to the time assigned to their\r\nfulfillment, those prophecies were bruited through Mardi; hence,\r\nprevious to the time assigned to their fulfillment, full knowledge of\r\nthem may have come to the nations concerned. Now, my lord, was it\r\npossible for those nations, thus forwarned, so to conduct their\r\naffairs, as at, the prophesied time, to prove false the events revealed\r\nto be in store for them?”\r\n\r\n“However that may be,” said Mohi, “certain it is, those events did\r\nassuredly come to pass:—Compare the ruins of Babbelona with book ninth,\r\nchapter tenth, of the chronicles. Yea, yea, the owl inhabits where the\r\nseers predicted; the jackals yell in the tombs of the kings.”\r\n\r\n“Go on, Babbalanja,” said Media. “Of course those nations could not\r\nhave resisted their doom. Go on, then: vault over your premises.”\r\n\r\n“If it be, then, my lord, that—”\r\n\r\n“My very worshipful lord,” interposed Mohi, “is not our philosopher\r\ngetting off soundings; and may it not be impious to meddle with these\r\nthings?”\r\n\r\n“Were it so, old man, he should have known it. The king of Odo is\r\nsomething more than you mortals.”\r\n\r\n“But are we the great gods themselves,” cried Yoomy, “that we discourse\r\nof these things.”\r\n\r\n“No, minstrel,” said Babbalanja; “and no need have the great gods to\r\ndiscourse of things perfectly comprehended by them, and by themselves\r\nordained. But you and I, Yoomy, are men, and not gods; hence is it for\r\nus, and not for them, to take these things for our themes. Nor is there\r\nany impiety in the right use of our reason, whatever the issue. Smote\r\nwith superstition, shall we let it wither and die out, a dead, limb to\r\na live trunk, as the mad devotee’s arm held up motionless for years? Or\r\nshall we employ it but for a paw, to help us to our bodily needs, as\r\nthe brutes use their instinct? Is not reason subtile as\r\nquicksilver—live as lightning—a neighing charger to advance, but a\r\nsnail to recede? Can we starve that noble instinct in us, and hope that\r\nit will survive? Better slay the body than the soul; and if it be the\r\ndirest of sins to be the murderers of our own bodies, how much more to\r\nbe a soul-suicide. Yoomy, we are men, we are angels. And in his\r\nfaculties, high Oro is but what a man would be, infinitely magnified.\r\nLet us aspire to all things. Are we babes in the woods, to be scared by\r\nthe shadows of the trees? What shall appall us? If eagles gaze at the\r\nsun, may not men at the gods?”\r\n\r\n“For one,” said Media, “you may gaze at me freely. Gaze on. But talk\r\nnot of my kinsmen so fluently, Babbalanja. Return to your argument.”\r\n\r\n“I go back then, my lord. By implication, you have granted, that in\r\ntimes past the future was foreknown of Oro; hence, in times past, the\r\nfuture must have been foreordained. But in all things Oro is immutable.\r\nWherefore our own future is foreknown and foreordained. Now, if things\r\nforeordained concerning nations have in times past been revealed to\r\nthem previous to their taking place, then something similar may be\r\npresumable concerning individual men now living. That is to say, out of\r\nall the events destined to befall any one man, it is not impossible\r\nthat previous knowledge of some one of these events might\r\nsupernaturally come to him. Say, then, it is revealed to me, that ten\r\ndays hence I shall, of my own choice, fall upon my javelin; when the\r\ntime comes round, could I refrain from suicide? Grant the strongest\r\npresumable motives to the act; grant that, unforewarned, I would slay\r\nmyself outright at the time appointed: yet, foretold of it, and\r\nresolved to test the decree to the uttermost, under such circumstances,\r\nI say, would it be possible for me not to kill myself? If possible,\r\nthen predestination is not a thing absolute; and Heaven is wise to keep\r\nsecret from us those decrees, whose virtue consists in secrecy. But if\r\nnot possible, then that suicide would not be mine, but Oro’s. And, by\r\nconsequence, not only that act, but all my acts, are Oro’s. In sum, my\r\nlord, he who believes that in times past, prophets have prophesied, and\r\ntheir prophecies have been fulfilled; when put to it, inevitably must\r\nallow that every man now living is an irresponsible being.”\r\n\r\n“In sooth, a very fine argument very finely argued,” said Media. “You\r\nhave done marvels, Babbalanja. But hark ye, were I so disposed, I could\r\ndeny you all over, premises and conclusions alike. And furthermore, my\r\ncogent philosopher, had you published that anarchical dogma among my\r\nsubjects in Oro, I had silenced you by my spear-headed scepter, instead\r\nof my uplifted finger.”\r\n\r\n“Then, all thanks and all honor to your generosity, my lord, in\r\ngranting us the immunities you did at the outset of this voyage. But,\r\nmy lord, permit me one word more. Is not Oro omnipresent—absolutely\r\nevery where?”\r\n\r\n“So you mortals teach, Babbalanja.”\r\n\r\n“But so do they _mean_, my lord. Often do we Mardians stick to terms\r\nfor ages, yet truly apply not their meanings.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Oro is every where. What now?”\r\n\r\n“Then, if that be absolutely so, Oro is not merely a universal\r\non-looker, but occupies and fills all space; and no vacancy is left for\r\nany being, or any thing but Oro. Hence, Oro is _in_ all things, and\r\nhimself _is_ all things—the time-old creed. But since evil abounds, and\r\nOro is all things, then he can not be perfectly good; wherefore, Oro’s\r\nomnipresence and moral perfection seem incompatible. Furthermore, my\r\nlord those orthodox systems which ascribe to Oro almighty and universal\r\nattributes every way, those systems, I say, destroy all intellectual\r\nindividualities but Oro, and resolve the universe into him. But this is\r\na heresy; wherefore, orthodoxy and heresy are one. And thus is it, my\r\nlord, that upon these matters we Mardians all agree and disagree\r\ntogether, and kill each other with weapons that burst in our hands. Ah,\r\nmy lord, with what mind must blessed Oro look down upon this scene!\r\nThink you he discriminates between the deist and atheist? Nay; for the\r\nSearcher of the cores of all hearts well knoweth that atheists there\r\nare none. For in things abstract, men but differ in the sounds that\r\ncome from their mouths, and not in the wordless thoughts lying at the\r\nbottom of their beings. The universe is all of one mind. Though my\r\ntwin-brother sware to me, by the blazing sun in heaven at noon-day,\r\nthat Oro is not; yet would he belie the thing he intended to express.\r\nAnd who lives that blasphemes? What jargon of human sounds so puissant\r\nas to insult the unutterable majesty divine? Is Oro’s honor in the\r\nkeeping of Mardi?— Oro’s conscience in man’s hands? Where our warrant,\r\nwith Oro’s sign-manual, to justify the killing, burning, and\r\ndestroying, or far worse, the social persecutions we institute in his\r\nbehalf? Ah! how shall these self-assumed attorneys and vicegerents be\r\nastounded, when they shall see all heaven peopled with heretics and\r\nheathens, and all hell nodding over with miters! Ah! let us Mardians\r\nquit this insanity. Let us be content with the theology in the grass\r\nand the flower, in seed-time and harvest. Be it enough for us to know\r\nthat Oro indubitably is. My lord! my lord! sick with the spectacle of\r\nthe madness of men, and broken with spontaneous doubts, I sometimes see\r\nbut two things in all Mardi to believe:—that I myself exist, and that I\r\ncan most happily, or least miserably exist, by the practice of\r\nrighteousness. All else is in the clouds; and naught else may I learn,\r\ntill the firmament be split from horizon to horizon. Yet, alas! too\r\noften do I swing from these moorings.”\r\n\r\n“Alas! his fit is coming upon him again,” whispered Yoomy.\r\n\r\n“Why, Babbalanja,” said Media, “I almost pity you. You are too warm,\r\ntoo warm. Why fever your soul with these things? To no use you mortals\r\nwax earnest. No thanks, but curses, will you get for your earnestness.\r\nYou yourself you harm most. Why not take creeds as they come? It is not\r\nso hard to be persuaded; never mind about believing.”\r\n\r\n“True, my lord; not very hard; no act is required; only passiveness.\r\nStand still and receive. Faith is to the thoughtless, doubts to the\r\nthinker.”\r\n\r\n“Then, why think at all? Is it not better for you mortals to clutch\r\nerror as in a vice, than have your fingers meet in your hand? And to\r\nwhat end your eternal inquisitions? You have nothing to substitute. You\r\nsay all is a lie; then out with the truth. Philosopher, your devil is\r\nbut a foolish one, after all. I, a demi-god, never say nay to these\r\nthings.”\r\n\r\n“Yea, my lord, it would hardly answer for Oro himself, were he to come\r\ndown to Mardi, to deny men’s theories concerning him. Did they not\r\nstrike at the rash deity in Alma?”\r\n\r\n“Then, why deny those theories yourself? Babbalanja, you almost affect\r\nmy immortal serenity. Must you forever be a sieve for good grain to run\r\nthrough, while you retain but the chaff? Your tongue is forked. You\r\nspeak two languages: flat folly for yourself, and wisdom for others.\r\nBabbalanja, if you have any belief of your own, keep it; but, in Oro’s\r\nname, keep it secret.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, my lord, in these things wise men are spectators, not actors; wise\r\nmen look on, and say ‘ay.’”\r\n\r\n“Why not say so yourself, then?”\r\n\r\n“My lord, because I have often told you, that I am a fool, and not\r\nwise.”\r\n\r\n“Your Highness,” said Mohi, “this whole discourse seems to have grown\r\nout of the subject of Necessity and Free Will. Now, when a boy, I\r\nrecollect hearing a sage say, that these things were reconcilable.”\r\n\r\n“Ay?” said Media, “what say you to that, now, Babbalanja?”\r\n\r\n“It may be even so, my lord. Shall I tell you a story?”\r\n\r\n“Azzageddi’s stirring now,” muttered Mohi.\r\n\r\n“Proceed,” said Media.\r\n\r\n“King Normo had a fool, called Willi, whom he loved to humor. Now,\r\nthough Willi ever obeyed his lord, by the very instinct of his\r\nservitude, he flattered himself that he was free; and this conceit it\r\nwas, that made the fool so entertaining to the king. One day, said\r\nNormo to his fool,—‘Go, Willi, to yonder tree, and wait there till I\r\ncome,’ ‘Your Majesty, I will,’ said Willi, bowing beneath his jingling\r\nbells; ‘but I presume your Majesty has no objections to my walking on\r\nmy hands:—I am free, I hope.’ ‘Perfectly,’ said Normo, ‘hands or feet,\r\nit’s all the same to me; only do my bidding.’ ‘I thought as much,’ said\r\nWilli; so, swinging his limber legs into the air, Willi, thumb after\r\nthumb, essayed progression. But soon, his bottled blood so rushed\r\ndownward through his neck, that he was fain to turn a somerset and\r\nregain his feet. Said he, ‘Though I am free to do it, it’s not so easy\r\nturning digits into toes; I’ll walk, by gad! which is my other option.’\r\nSo he went straight forward, and did King Normo’s bidding in the\r\nnatural way.”\r\n\r\n“A curious story that,” said Media; “whence came it?”\r\n\r\n“My lord, where every thing, but one, is to be had:—within.”\r\n\r\n“You are charged to the muzzle, then,” said Braid-Beard. “Yes, Mohi;\r\nand my talk is my overflowing, not my fullness.”\r\n\r\n“And what may you be so full of?”\r\n\r\n“Of myself.”\r\n\r\n“So it seems,” said Mohi, whisking away a fly with his beard.\r\n\r\n“Babbalanja,” said Media, “you did right in selecting this ebon night\r\nfor discussing the theme you did; and truly, you mortals are but too\r\napt to talk in the dark.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, my lord, and we mortals may prate still more in the dark, when we\r\nare dead; for methinks, that if we then prate at all, ’twill be in our\r\nsleep. Ah! my lord, think not that in aught I’ve said this night, I\r\nwould assert any wisdom of my own. I but fight against the armed and\r\ncrested Lies of Mardi, that like a host, assail me. I am stuck full of\r\ndarts; but, tearing them from out me, gasping, I discharge them whence\r\nthey come.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, Babbalanja slowly drooped, and fell reclining; then lay\r\nmotionless as the marble Gladiator, that for centuries has been dying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\nMy Lord Media Summons Mohi To The Stand\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile slowly the night wore on, and the now scudding clouds flown past,\r\nrevealed again the hosts in heaven, few words were uttered save by\r\nMedia; who, when all others were most sad and silent, seemed but little\r\nmoved, or not stirred a jot.\r\n\r\nBut that night, he filled his flagon fuller than his wont, and drank,\r\nand drank, and pledged the stars.\r\n\r\n“Here’s to thee, old Arcturus! To thee, old Aldebaran! who ever poise\r\nyour wine-red, fiery spheres on high. A health to _thee_, my regal\r\nfriend, Alphacca, in the constellation of the Crown: Lo! crown to\r\ncrown, I pledge thee! I drink to _ye_, too, Alphard! Markab! Denebola!\r\nCapella!—to _ye_, too, sailing Cygnus! Aquila soaring!—All round, a\r\nhealth to all your diadems! May they never fade! nor mine!”\r\n\r\nAt last, in the shadowy east, the Dawn, like a gray, distant sail\r\nbefore the wind, was descried; drawing nearer and nearer, till her\r\ngilded prow was perceived.\r\n\r\nAnd as in tropic gales, the winds blow fierce, and more fierce, with\r\nthe advent of the sun; so with King Media; whose mirth now breezed up\r\nafresh. But, as at sunrise, the sea-storm only blows harder, to settle\r\ndown at last into a steady wind; even so, in good time, my lord Media\r\ncame to be more decorous of mood. And Babbalanja abated his reveries.\r\n\r\nFor who might withstand such a morn!\r\n\r\nAs on the night-banks of the far-rolling Ganges, the royal bridegroom\r\nsets forth for his bride, preceded by nymphs, now this side, now that,\r\nlighting up all the flowery flambeaux held on high as they pass; so\r\ncame the Sun, to his nuptials with Mardi:—the Hours going on before,\r\ntouching all the peaks, till they glowed rosy-red.\r\n\r\nBy reflex, the lagoon, here and there, seemed on fire; each curling\r\nwave-crest a flame.\r\n\r\nNoon came as we sailed.\r\n\r\nAnd now, citrons and bananas, cups and calabashes, calumets and\r\ntobacco, were passed round; and we were all very merry and mellow\r\nindeed. Smacking our lips, chatting, smoking, and sipping. Now a\r\nmouthful of citron to season a repartee; now a swallow of wine to wash\r\ndown a precept; now a fragrant whiff to puff away care. Many things did\r\nbeguile. From side to side, we turned and grazed, like Juno’s white\r\noxen in clover meads.\r\n\r\nSoon, we drew nigh to a charming cliff, overrun with woodbines, on high\r\nsuspended from flowering Tamarisk and Tamarind-trees. The blossoms of\r\nthe Tamarisks, in spikes of small, red bells; the Tamarinds,\r\nwide-spreading their golden petals, red-streaked as with streaks of the\r\ndawn. Down sweeping to the water, the vines trailed over to the crisp,\r\ncurling waves,—little pages, all eager to hold up their trains.\r\n\r\nWithin, was a bower; going behind it, like standing inside the sheet of\r\nthe falls of the Genesee.\r\n\r\nIn this arbor we anchored. And with their shaded prows thrust in among\r\nthe flowers, our three canoes seemed baiting by the way, like wearied\r\nsteeds in a hawthorn lane.\r\n\r\nHigh midsummer noon is more silent than night. Most sweet a siesta\r\nthen. And noon dreams are day-dreams indeed; born under the meridian\r\nsun. Pale Cynthia begets pale specter shapes; and her frigid rays best\r\nilluminate white nuns, marble monuments, icy glaciers, and cold tombs.\r\n\r\nThe sun rolled on. And starting to his feet, arms clasped, and wildly\r\nstaring, Yoomy exclaimed—“Nay, nay, thou shalt not depart, thou\r\nmaid!—here, here I fold thee for aye!—Flown?—A dream! Then siestas\r\nhenceforth while I live. And at noon, every day will I meet thee, sweet\r\nmaid! And, oh Sun! set not; and poppies bend over us, when next we\r\nembrace!”\r\n\r\n“What ails that somnambulist?” cried Media, rising. “Yoomy, I say! what\r\nails thee?”\r\n\r\n“He must have indulged over freely in those citrons,” said Mohi,\r\nsympathetically rubbing his fruitery. “Ho, Yoomy! a swallow of brine\r\nwill help thee.”\r\n\r\n“Alas,” cried Babbalanja, “do the fairies then wait on repletion? Do\r\nour dreams come from below, and not from the skies? Are we angels, or\r\ndogs? Oh, Man, Man, Man! thou art harder to solve, than the Integral\r\nCalculus—yet plain as a primer; harder to find than the\r\nphilosopher’s-stone—yet ever at hand; a more cunning compound, than an\r\nalchemist’s—yet a hundred weight of flesh, to a penny weight of spirit;\r\nsoul and body glued together, firm as atom to atom, seamless as the\r\nvestment without joint, warp or woof—yet divided as by a river, spirit\r\nfrom flesh; growing both ways, like a tree, and dropping thy topmost\r\nbranches to earth, like thy beard or a banian!—I give thee up, oh Man!\r\nthou art twain—yet indivisible; all things—yet a poor unit at best.”\r\n\r\n“Philosopher you seem puzzled to account for the riddles of your race,”\r\ncried Media, sideways reclining at his ease. “Now, do thou, old Mohi,\r\nstand up before a demi-god, and answer for all.—Draw nigh, so I can eye\r\nthee. What art thou, mortal?”\r\n\r\n“My worshipful lord, a man.”\r\n\r\n“And what are men?”\r\n\r\n“My lord, before thee is a specimen.”\r\n\r\n“I fear me, my lord will get nothing out of that witness,” said\r\nBabbalanja. “Pray you, King Media, let another inquisitor cross-\r\nquestion.”\r\n\r\n“Proceed; take the divan.”\r\n\r\n“A pace or two farther off, there, Mohi; so I can garner thee all in at\r\na glance.—Attention! Rememberest thou, fellow-being, when thou wast\r\nborn?”\r\n\r\n“Not I. Old Braid-Beard had no memory then.”\r\n\r\n“When, then, wast thou first conscious of being?”\r\n\r\n“What time I was teething: my first sensation was an ache.”\r\n\r\n“What dost thou, fellow-being, here in Mardi?”\r\n\r\n“What doth Mardi here, fellow-being, under me?”\r\n\r\n“Philosopher, thou gainest but little by thy questions,” cried Yoomy\r\nadvancing. “Let a poet endeavor.”\r\n\r\n“I abdicate in your favor, then, gentle Yoomy; let me smooth the divan\r\nfor you;—there: be seated.”\r\n\r\n“Now, Mohi, who art thou?” said Yoomy, nodding his bird-of-paradise\r\nplume.\r\n\r\n“The sole witness, it seems, in this case.”\r\n\r\n“Try again minstrel,” cried Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n“Then, what art thou, Mohi?”\r\n\r\n“Even what thou art, Yoomy.”\r\n\r\n“He is too sharp or too blunt for us all,” cried King Media. “His devil\r\nis even more subtle than yours, Babbalanja. Let him go.”\r\n\r\n“Shall I adjourn the court then, my lord?” said Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n“Ay.”\r\n\r\n“Oyez! Oyez! Oyez! All mortals having business at this court, know ye,\r\nthat it is adjourned till sundown of the day, which hath no to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\nWherein Babbalanja And Yoomy Embrace\r\n\r\n\r\n“How the isles grow and multiply around us!” cried Babbalanja, as\r\nturning the bold promontory of an uninhabited shore, many distant lands\r\nbluely loomed into view. “Surely, our brief voyage, may not embrace all\r\nMardi like its reef?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Media, “much must be left unseen. Nor every where can Yillah\r\nbe sought, noble Taji.”\r\n\r\nSaid Yoomy, “We are as birds, with pinions clipped, that in\r\nunfathomable and endless woods, but flit from twig to twig of one poor\r\ntree.”\r\n\r\n“More isles! more isles!” cried Babbalanja, erect, and gazing abroad.\r\n“And lo! round all is heaving that infinite ocean. Ah! gods! what\r\nregions lie beyond?”\r\n\r\n“But whither now?” he cried, as in obedience to Media, the paddlers\r\nsuddenly altered our course.\r\n\r\n“To the bold shores of Diranda,” said Media.\r\n\r\n“Ay; the land of clubs and javelins, where the lord seigniors Hello and\r\nPiko celebrate their famous games,” cried Mohi.\r\n\r\n“Your clubs and javelins,” said Media, “remind me of the great battle-\r\nchant of Narvi—Yoomy!”—turning to the minstrel, gazing abstractedly\r\ninto the water;—“awake, Yoomy, and give us the lines.”\r\n\r\n“My lord Media, ’tis but a rude, clanging thing; dissonant as if the\r\nnorth wind blew through it. Methinks the company will not fancy lines\r\nso inharmonious. Better sing you, perhaps, one of my sonnets.”\r\n\r\n“Better sit and sob in our ears, silly Yoomy that thou art!—no! no!\r\nnone of your sentiment now; my soul is martially inclined; I want\r\nclarion peals, not lute warblings. So throw out your chest, Yoomy: lift\r\nhigh your voice; and blow me the old battle-blast.—Begin, sir\r\nminstrel.”\r\n\r\nAnd warning all, that he himself had not composed the odious chant,\r\nYoomy thus:—\r\n\r\nOur clubs! our clubs!\r\nThe thousand clubs of Narvi!\r\nOf the living trunk of the Palm-tree made;\r\nSkull breakers! Brain spatterers!\r\nWielded right, and wielded left;\r\nLife quenchers! Death dealers!\r\nCausing live bodies to run headless!\r\n\r\nOur bows! our bows!\r\nThe thousand bows of Narvi!\r\nRibs of Tara, god of War!\r\nFashioned from the light Tola their arrows;\r\nSwift messengers! Heart piercers!\r\nBarbed with sharp pearl shells;\r\nWinged with white tail-plumes;\r\nTo wild death-chants, strung with the hair of wild maidens!\r\n\r\nOur spears! our spears!\r\nThe thousand spears of Narvi!\r\nOf the thunder-riven Moo-tree made\r\nTall tree, couched on the long mountain Lana!\r\nNo staves for gray-beards! no rods for fishermen!\r\nTempered by fierce sea-winds,\r\nSplintered into lances by lightnings,\r\nLong arrows! Heart seekers!\r\nToughened by fire their sharp black points!\r\n\r\nOur slings! our slings!\r\nThe thousand slings of Narvi!\r\nAll tasseled, and braided, and gayly bedecked.\r\nIn peace, our girdles; in war, our war-nets;\r\nWherewith catch we heads as fish from the deep!\r\nThe pebbles they hurl, have been hurled before,—\r\nHurled up on the beach by the stormy sea!\r\nPebbles, buried erewhile in the head of the shark:\r\nTo be buried erelong in the heads of our foes!\r\nHome of hard blows, our pouches!\r\nNest of death-eggs!  How quickly they hatch!\r\n\r\nUplift, and couch we our spears, men!\r\nRing hollow on the rocks our war clubs!\r\nBend we our bows, feel the points of our arrows:\r\nAloft, whirl in eddies our sling-nets;\r\nTo the fight, men of Narvi!\r\nSons of battle! Hunters of men!\r\nRaise high your war-wood!\r\nShout Narvi! her groves in the storm!\r\n\r\n\r\n“By Oro!” cried Media, “but Yoomy has well nigh stirred up all\r\nBabbalanja’s devils in me. Were I a mortal, I could fight now on a\r\npretense. And did any man say me nay, I would charge upon him like a\r\nspear-point. Ah, Yoomy, thou and thy tribe have much to answer for; ye\r\nstir up all Mardi with your lays. Your war chants make men fight; your\r\ndrinking songs, drunkards; your love ditties, fools. Yet there thou\r\nsittest, Yoomy, gentle as a dove.—What art thou, minstrel, that thy\r\nsoft, singing soul should so master all mortals? Yoomy, like me, you\r\nsway a scepter.”\r\n\r\n“Thou honorest my calling overmuch,” said Yoomy, we minstrels but sing\r\nour lays carelessly, my lord Media.”\r\n\r\n“Ay: and the more mischief they make.”\r\n\r\n“But sometimes we poets are didactic.”\r\n\r\n“Didactic and dull; many of ye are but too apt to be prosy unless\r\nmischievous.”\r\n\r\n“Yet in our verses, my lord Media, but few of us purpose harm.”\r\n\r\n“But when all harmless to yourselves, ye may be otherwise to Mardi.”\r\n\r\n“And are not foul streams often traced to pure fountains, my lord?”\r\nsaid Babbalanja. “The essence of all good and all evil is in us, not\r\nout of us. Neither poison nor honey lodgeth in the flowers on which,\r\nside by side, bees and wasps oft alight. My lord, nature is an\r\nimmaculate virgin, forever standing unrobed before us. True poets but\r\npaint the charms which all eyes behold. The vicious would be vicious\r\nwithout them.”\r\n\r\n“My lord Media,” impetuously resumed Yoomy, “I am sensible of a\r\nthousand sweet, merry fancies, limpid with innocence; yet my enemies\r\naccount them all lewd conceits.”\r\n\r\n“There be those in Mardi,” said Babbalanja, “who would never ascribe\r\nevil to others, did they not find it in their own hearts; believing\r\nnone can be different from themselves.”\r\n\r\n“My lord, my lord!” cried Yoomy. “The air that breathes my music from\r\nme is a mountain air! Purer than others am I; for though not a woman, I\r\nfeel in me a woman’s soul.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, have done, silly Yoomy,” said Media. “Thou art becoming flighty,\r\neven as Babbalanja, when Azzageddi is uppermost.”\r\n\r\n“Thus ever: ever thus!” sighed Yoomy. “They comprehend us not.”\r\n\r\n“Nor me,” said Babbalanja. “Yoomy: poets both, we differ but in\r\nseeming; thy airiest conceits are as the shadows of my deepest\r\nponderings; though Yoomy soars, and Babbalanja dives, both meet at\r\nlast. Not a song you sing, but I have thought its thought; and where\r\ndull Mardi sees but your rose, I unfold its petals, and disclose a\r\npearl. Poets are we, Yoomy, in that we dwell without us; we live in\r\ngrottoes, palms, and brooks; we ride the sea, we ride the sky; poets\r\nare omnipresent.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\nOf The Isle Of Diranda\r\n\r\n\r\nIn good time the shores of Diranda were in sight. And, introductory to\r\nlanding, Braid-Beard proceeded to give us some little account of the\r\nisland, and its rulers.\r\n\r\nAs previously hinted, those very magnificent and illustrious lord\r\nseigniors, the lord seigniors Hello and Piko, who between them divided\r\nDiranda, delighted in all manner of public games, especially warlike\r\nones; which last were celebrated so frequently, and were so fatal in\r\ntheir results, that, not-withstanding the multiplicity of nuptials\r\ntaking place in the isle, its population remained in equilibrio. But,\r\nstrange to relate, this was the very object which the lord seigniors\r\nhad in view; the very object they sought to compass, by instituting\r\ntheir games. Though, for the most part, they wisely kept the secret\r\nlocked up.\r\n\r\nBut to tell how the lord seigniors Hello and Piko came to join hands in\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\nDiranda had been amicably divided between them ever since the day they\r\nwere crowned; one reigning king in the East, the other in the West. But\r\nKing Piko had been long harassed with the thought, that the\r\nunobstructed and indefinite increase of his browsing subjects might\r\neventually denude of herbage his portion of the island. Posterity,\r\nthought he, is marshaling her generations in squadrons, brigades, and\r\nbattalions, and ere long will be down upon my devoted empire. Lo! her\r\nlocust cavalry darken the skies; her light-troop pismires cover the\r\nearth. Alas! my son and successor, thou wilt inhale choke-damp for air,\r\nand have not a private corner to say thy prayers.\r\n\r\nBy a sort of arithmetical progression, the probability, nay, the\r\ncertainty of these results, if not in some way averted, was proved to\r\nKing Piko; and he was furthermore admonished, that war—war to the haft\r\nwith King Hello—was the only cure for so menacing an evil.\r\n\r\nBut so it was, that King Piko, at peace with King Hello, and well\r\ncontent with, the tranquillity of the times, little relished the idea\r\nof picking a quarrel with his neighbor, and running its risks, in order\r\nto phlebotomize his redundant population.\r\n\r\n“Patience, most illustrious seignior,” said another of his sagacious\r\nAhithophels, “and haply a pestilence may decimate the people.”\r\n\r\nBut no pestilence came. And in every direction the young men and\r\nmaidens were recklessly rushing into wedlock; and so salubrious the\r\nclimate, that the old men stuck to the outside of the turf, and refused\r\nto go under.\r\n\r\nAt last some Machiavel of a philosopher suggested, that peradventure\r\nthe object of war might be answered without going to war; that\r\nperadventure King Hello might be brought to acquiesce in an\r\narrangement, whereby the men of Diranda might be induced to kill off\r\none another voluntarily, in a peaceable manner, without troubling their\r\nrulers. And to this end, the games before mentioned were proposed.\r\n\r\n“Egad! my wise ones, you have hit it,” cried Piko; “but will Hello say\r\nay?”\r\n\r\n“Try him, most illustrious seignior,” said Machiavel.\r\n\r\nSo to Hello went embassadors ordinary and extraordinary, and ministers\r\nplenipotentiary and peculiar; and anxiously King Piko awaited their\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nThe mission was crowned with success.\r\n\r\nSaid King Hello to the ministers, in confidence:—“The very thing, Dons,\r\nthe very thing I have wanted. My people are increasing too fast. They\r\nkeep up the succession too well. Tell your illustrious master it’s a\r\nbargain. The games! the games! by all means.”\r\n\r\nSo, throughout the island, by proclamation, they were forthwith\r\nestablished; succeeding to a charm.\r\n\r\nAnd the lord seigniors, Hello and Piko, finding their interests the\r\nsame, came together like bride and bridegroom; lived in the same\r\npalace; dined off the same cloth; cut from the same bread-fruit; drank\r\nfrom the same calabash; wore each other’s crowns; and often locking\r\narms with a charming frankness, paced up and down in their dominions,\r\ndiscussing the prospect of the next harvest of heads.\r\n\r\nIn his old-fashioned way, having related all this, with many other\r\nparticulars, Mohi was interrupted by Babbalanja, who inquired how the\r\npeople of Diranda relished the games, and how they fancied being coolly\r\nthinned out in that manner.\r\n\r\nTo which in substance the chronicler replied, that of the true object\r\nof the games, they had not the faintest conception; but hammered away\r\nat each other, and fought and died together, like jolly good fellows.\r\n\r\n“Right again, immortal old Bardianna!” cried Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n“And what has the sage to the point this time?” asked Media.\r\n\r\n“Why, my lord, in his chapter on “Cracked Crowns,” Bardianna, after\r\nmany profound ponderings, thus concludes: In this cracked sphere we\r\nlive in, then, cracked skulls would seem the inevitable allotments of\r\nmany. Nor will the splintering thereof cease, till this pugnacious\r\nanimal we treat of be deprived of his natural maces: videlicet, his\r\narms. And right well doth man love to bruise and batter all occiputs in\r\nhis vicinity.”\r\n\r\n“Seems to me, our old friend must have been on his stilts that time,”\r\ninterrupted Mohi.\r\n\r\n“No, Braid-Beard. But by way of apologizing for the unusual rigidity of\r\nhis style in that chapter, he says in a note, that it was written upon\r\na straight-backed settle, when he was ill of a lumbago, and a crick in\r\nthe neck.”\r\n\r\n“That incorrigible Azzageddi again,” said Media, “Proceed with your\r\nquotation, Babbalanja.”\r\n\r\n“Where was I, Braid-Beard?”\r\n\r\n“Battering occiputs at the last accounts,” said Mohi.\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes. And right well doth man love to bruise and batter all\r\nocciputs in his vicinity; he but follows his instincts; he is but one\r\nmember of a fighting world. Spiders, vixens, and tigers all war with a\r\nrelish; and on every side is heard the howls of hyenas, the throttlings\r\nof mastiffs, the din of belligerant beetles, the buzzing warfare of the\r\ninsect battalions: and the shrill cries of lady Tartars rending their\r\nlords. And all this existeth of necessity. To war it is, and other\r\ndepopulators, that we are beholden for elbow-room in Mardi and for all\r\nour parks an gardens, wherein we are wont to expatiate. Come on, then,\r\nplague, war, famine and viragos! Come on, I say, for who shall stay ye?\r\nCome on, and healthfulize the census! And more especially, oh War! do\r\nthou march forth with thy bludgeon! Cracked are, our crowns by nature,\r\nand henceforth forever, cracked shall they be by hard raps.”\r\n\r\n“And hopelessly cracked the skull, that hatched such a tirade of\r\nnonsense,” said Mohi.\r\n\r\n“And think you not, old Bardianna knew that?” asked Babbalanja. “He\r\nwrote an excellent chapter on that very subject.”\r\n\r\n“What, on the cracks in his own pate?”\r\n\r\n“Precisely. And expressly asserts, that to those identical cracks, was\r\nhe indebted for what little light he had in his brain.”\r\n\r\n“I yield, Babbalanja; your old Ponderer is older than I.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay, Braid-Beard; his crest was a tortoise; and this was the\r\nmotto:—‘I bite, but am not to be bitten.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\nThey Visit The Lords Piko And Hello\r\n\r\n\r\nIn good time, we landed at Diranda. And that landing was like landing\r\nat Greenwich among the Waterloo pensioners. The people were docked\r\nright and left; some without arms; some without legs; not one with a\r\ntail; but to a man, all had heads, though rather the worse for wear;\r\ncovered with lumps and contusions.\r\n\r\nNow, those very magnificent and illustrious lord seigniors, the lord\r\nseigniors Hello and Piko, lived in a palace, round which was a fence of\r\nthe cane called Malacca, each picket helmed with a skull, of which\r\nthere were fifty, one to each cane. Over the door was the blended arms\r\nof the high and mighty houses of Hello and Piko: a Clavicle crossed\r\nover an Ulna.\r\n\r\nEscorted to the sign of the Skull-and-Cross-Bones, we received the very\r\nbest entertainment which that royal inn could afford. We found our\r\nhosts Hello and Piko seated together on a dais or throne, and now and\r\nthen drinking some claret-red wine from an ivory bowl, too large to\r\nhave been wrought from an elephant’s tusk. They were in glorious good\r\nspirits, shaking ivory coins in a skull.\r\n\r\n“What says your majesty?” said Piko. “Heads or tails?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, heads, your majesty,” said Hello.\r\n\r\n“And heads say I,” said Piko.\r\n\r\nAnd heads it was. But it was heads on both sides, so both were sure to\r\nwin.\r\n\r\nAnd thus they were used to play merrily all day long; beheading the\r\ngourds of claret by one slicing blow with their sickle-shaped scepters.\r\nWide round them lay empty calabashes, all feathered, red dyed, and\r\nbetasseled, trickling red wine from their necks, like the decapitated\r\npullets in the old baronial barn yard at Kenilworth, the night before\r\nQueen Bess dined with my lord Leicester.\r\n\r\nThe first compliments over; and Media and Taji having met with a\r\nreception suitable to their rank, the kings inquired, whether there\r\nwere any good javelin-flingers among us: for if that were the case,\r\nthey could furnish them plenty of sport. Informed, however, that none\r\nof the party were professional warriors, their majesties looked rather\r\nglum, and by way of chasing away the blues, called for some good old\r\nstuff, that was red.\r\n\r\nIt seems, this soliciting guests, to keep their spears from decaying,\r\nby cut and thrust play with their subjects, was a very common thing\r\nwith their illustrious majesties.\r\n\r\nBut if their visitors could not be prevailed upon to spear a subject or\r\nso, our hospitable hosts resolved to have a few speared, and otherwise\r\nserved up for our special entertainment. In a word, our arrival\r\nfurnished a fine pretext for renewing their games; though, we learned,\r\nthat only ten days previous, upward of fifty combatants had been slain\r\nat one of these festivals.\r\n\r\nBe that as it might, their joint majesties determined upon another one;\r\nand also upon our tarrying to behold it. We objected, saying we must\r\ndepart.\r\n\r\nBut we were kindly assured, that our canoes had been dragged out of the\r\nwater, and buried in a wood; there to remain till the games were over.\r\n\r\nThe day fixed upon, was the third subsequent to our arrival; the\r\ninterval being devoted to preparations; summoning from their villages\r\nand valleys the warriors of the land; and publishing the royal\r\nproclamations, whereby the unbounded hospitality of the kings’\r\nhousehold was freely offered to all heroes whatsoever, who for the love\r\nof arms, and the honor of broken heads, desired to cross battle-clubs,\r\nhurl spears, or die game in the royal valley of Deddo.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the whole island was in a state of uproarious commotion, and\r\nstrangers were daily arriving.\r\n\r\nThe spot set apart for the festival, was a spacious down, mantled with\r\nwhite asters; which, waving in windrows, lay upon the land, like the\r\ncream-surf surging the milk of young heifers. But that whiteness, here\r\nand there, was spotted with strawberries; tracking the plain, as if\r\nwounded creatures had been dragging themselves bleeding from some\r\ndeadly encounter. All round the down, waved scarlet thickets of sumach,\r\nmoaning in the wind, like the gory ghosts environing Pharsalia the\r\nnight after the battle; scaring away the peasants, who with\r\nbushel-baskets came to the jewel-harvest of the rings of Pompey’s\r\nknights.\r\n\r\nBeneath the heaped turf of this down, lay thousands of glorious corpses\r\nof anonymous heroes, who here had died glorious deaths.\r\n\r\nWhence, in the florid language of Diranda, they called this field “The\r\nField of Glory.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\nThey Attend The Games\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last the third day dawned; and facing us upon entering the plain,\r\nwas a throne of red log-wood, canopied by the foliage of a red-dyed\r\nPandannus. Upon this throne, purple-robed, reclined those very\r\nmagnificent and illustrious lords seigniors, the lord seigniors Hello\r\nand Piko. Before them, were many gourds of wine; and crosswise, staked\r\nin the sod, their own royal spears.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the down, as if by a furrow, a long, oval space was\r\nmargined of about which, a crowd of spectators were seated. Opposite\r\nthe throne, was reserved a clear passage to the arena, defined by\r\nair-lines, indefinitely produced from the leveled points of two spears,\r\nso poised by a brace of warriors.\r\n\r\nDrawing near, our party was courteously received, and assigned a\r\ncommodious lounge.\r\n\r\nThe first encounter was a club-fight between two warriors. Nor casque\r\nof steel, nor skull of Congo could have resisted their blows, had they\r\nfallen upon the mark; for they seemed bent upon driving each other, as\r\nstakes, into the earth. Presently, one of them faltered; but his\r\nadversary rushing in to cleave him down, slipped against a guavarind;\r\nwhen the falterer, with one lucky blow, high into the air sent the\r\nstumbler’s club, which descended upon the crown of a spectator, who was\r\nborne from the plain.\r\n\r\n“All one,” muttered Pike.\r\n\r\n“As good dead as another,” muttered Hello.\r\n\r\nThe second encounter was a hugging-match; wherein two warriors, masked\r\nin Grisly-bear skins, hugged each other to death.\r\n\r\nThe third encounter was a bumping-match between a fat warrior and a\r\ndwarf. Standing erect, his paunch like a bass-drum before a drummer,\r\nthe fat man was run at, head-a-tilt by the dwarf, and sent spinning\r\nround on his axis.\r\n\r\nThe fourth encounter was a tussle between two-score warriors, who all\r\nin a mass, writhed like the limbs in Sebastioni’s painting of Hades.\r\nAfter obscuring themselves in a cloud of dust, these combatants,\r\nuninjured, but hugely blowing, drew off; and separately going among the\r\nspectators, rehearsed their experience of the fray.\r\n\r\n“Braggarts!” mumbled Piko.\r\n\r\n“Poltroons!” growled Hello.\r\n\r\nWhile the crowd were applauding, a sober-sided observer, trying to rub\r\nthe dust out of his eyes, inquired of an enthusiastic neighbor, “Pray,\r\nwhat was all that about?”\r\n\r\n“Fool! saw you not the dust?”\r\n\r\n“That I did,” said Sober-Sides, again rubbing his eyes, “But I can\r\nraise a dust myself.”\r\n\r\nThe fifth encounter was a fight of single sticks between one hundred\r\nwarriors, fifty on a side.\r\n\r\nIn a line, the first fifty emerged from the sumachs, their weapons\r\ninterlocked in a sort of wicker-work. In advance marched a priest,\r\nbearing an idol with a cracked cocoanut for a head,—Krako, the god of\r\nTrepans. Preceded by damsels flinging flowers, now came on the second\r\nfifty, gayly appareled, weapons poised, and their feet nimbly moving in\r\na martial measure.\r\n\r\nMidway meeting, both parties touched poles, then retreated. Very\r\ncourteous, this; but tantamount to bowing each other out of Mardi; for\r\nupon Pike’s tossing a javelin, they rushed in, and each striking his\r\nman, all fell to the ground.\r\n\r\n“Well done!” cried Piko.\r\n\r\n“Brave fellows!” cried Hello.\r\n\r\n“But up and at it again, my heroes!” joined both. “Lo! we kings look\r\non, and there stand the bards!”\r\n\r\nThese bards were a row of lean, sallow, old men, in thread-bare robes,\r\nand chaplets of dead leaves.\r\n\r\n“Strike up!” cried Piko.\r\n\r\n“A stave!” cried Hello.\r\n\r\nWhereupon, the old croakers, each with a quinsy, sang thus in cracked\r\nstrains:—\r\n\r\nQuack! Quack! Quack!\r\nWith a toorooloo whack;\r\nHack away, merry men, hack away.\r\nWho would not die brave,\r\nHis ear smote by a stave?\r\nThwack away, merry men, thwack away!\r\n’Tis glory that calls,\r\nTo each hero that falls,\r\nHack away, merry men, hack away!\r\nQuack! Quack! Quack!\r\nQuack! Quack!\r\nQuack!\r\n\r\n\r\nThus it tapered away.\r\n\r\n“Ha, ha!” cried Piko, “how they prick their ears at that!”\r\n\r\n“Hark ye, my invincibles!” cried Hello. “That pean is for the slain. So\r\nall ye who have lives left, spring to it! Die and be glorified! Now’s\r\nthe time!—Strike up again, my ducklings!”\r\n\r\nThus incited, the survivors staggered to their feet; and hammering away\r\nat each others’ sconces, till they rung like a chime of bells going off\r\nwith a triple-bob-major, they finally succeeded in immortalizing\r\nthemselves by quenching their mortalities all round; the bards still\r\nsinging.\r\n\r\n“Never mind your music now,” cried Piko.\r\n\r\n“It’s all over,” said Hello.\r\n\r\n“What valiant fellows we have for subjects,” cried Piko.\r\n\r\n“Ho! grave-diggers, clear the field,” cried Hello.\r\n\r\n“Who else is for glory?” cried Piko.\r\n\r\n“There stand the bards!” cried Hello.\r\n\r\nBut now there rushed among the crowd a haggard figure, trickling with\r\nblood, and wearing a robe, whose edges were burned and blacked by fire.\r\nWielding a club, it ran to and fro, with loud yells menacing all.\r\n\r\nA noted warrior this; who, distracted at the death of five sons slain\r\nin recent games, wandered from valley to valley, wrestling and\r\nfighting.\r\n\r\nWith wild cries of “The Despairer! The Despairer!” the appalled\r\nmultitude fled; leaving the two kings frozen on their throne, quaking\r\nand quailing, their teeth rattling like dice.\r\n\r\nThe Despairer strode toward them; when, recovering their senses, they\r\nran; for a time pursued through the woods by the phantom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\nTaji Still Hunted, And Beckoned\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevious to the kings’ flight, we had plunged into the neighboring\r\nwoods; and from thence emerging, entered brakes of cane, sprouting from\r\nmorasses. Soon we heard a whirring, as if three startled partridges had\r\ntaken wing; it proved three feathered arrows, from three unseen hands.\r\n\r\nGracing us, two buried in the ground, but from Taji’s arm, the third\r\ndrew blood.\r\n\r\nOn all sides round we turned; but none were seen. “Still the avengers\r\nfollow,” said Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n“Lo! the damsels three!” cried Yoomy. “Look where they come!”\r\n\r\nWe joined them by the sumach-wood’s red skirts; and there, they waved\r\ntheir cherry stalks, and heavy bloated cactus leaves, their crimson\r\nblossoms armed with nettles; and before us flung shining, yellow,\r\ntiger-flowers spotted red.\r\n\r\n“Blood!” cried Yoomy, starting, “and leopards on your track!”\r\n\r\nAnd now the syrens blew through long reeds, tasseled with their\r\npanicles, and waving verdant scarfs of vines, came dancing toward us,\r\nproffering clustering grapes.\r\n\r\n“For all now yours, Taji; and all that yet may come,” cried Yoomy, “fly\r\nto me! I will dance away your gloom, and drown it in inebriation.”\r\n\r\n“Away! woe is its own wine. What may be mine, that will I endure, in\r\nits own essence to the quick. Let me feel the poniard if it stabs.”\r\n\r\nThey vanished in the wood; and hurrying on, we soon gained sun-light,\r\nand the open glade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\nThey Embark From Diranda\r\n\r\n\r\nArrived at the Sign of the Skulls, we found the illustrious lord\r\nseigniors at rest from their flight, and once more, quaffing their\r\nclaret, all thoughts of the specter departed. Instead of rattling their\r\nown ivory iii the heads on their shoulders, they were rattling their\r\ndice in the skulls in their hands. And still “Heads,” was the cry, and\r\n“Heads,” was the throw.\r\n\r\nThat evening they made known to my lord Media that an interval of two\r\ndays must elapse ere the games were renewed, in order to reward the\r\nvictors, bury their dead, and provide for the execution of an Islander,\r\nwho under the provocation of a blow, had killed a stranger.\r\n\r\nAs this suspension of the festivities had been wholly unforeseen, our\r\nhosts were induced to withdraw the embargo laid upon our canoes.\r\nNevertheless, they pressed us to remain; saying, that what was to come\r\nwould far exceed in interest, what had already taken place. The games\r\nin prospect being of a naval description, embracing certain\r\nhand-to-hand contests in the water between shoals of web-footed\r\nwarriors.\r\n\r\nHowever, we decided to embark on the morrow.\r\n\r\nIt was in the cool of the early morning, at that hour when a man’s face\r\ncan be known, that we set sail from Diranda; and in the ghostly\r\ntwilight, our thoughts reverted to the phantom that so suddenly had\r\ncleared the plain. With interest we hearkened to the recitals of Mohi;\r\nwho discoursing of the sad end of many brave chieftains in Mardi, made\r\nallusion to the youthful Adondo, one of the most famous of the chiefs\r\nof the chronicles. In a canoe-fight, after performing prodigies of\r\nvalor; he was wounded in the head, and sunk to the bottom of the\r\nlagoon.\r\n\r\n“There is a noble monody upon the death of Adondo,” said Yoomy. “Shall\r\nI sing it, my lord? It. is very beautiful; nor could I ever repeat it\r\nwithout a tear.”\r\n\r\n“We will dispense with your tears, minstrel,” said Media, “but sing it,\r\nif you will.”\r\n\r\nAnd Yoomy sang:—\r\n\r\nDeparted the pride and the glory of Mardi:\r\nThe vaunt of her isles sleeps deep in the sea,\r\n    That rolls o’er his corpse with a hush.\r\n    His warriors bend over their spears,\r\n    His sisters gaze upward and mourn.\r\n        Weep, weep, for Adondo, is dead!\r\n    The sun has gone down in a shower;\r\n    Buried in clouds in the face of the moon;\r\nTears stand in the eyes of the starry skies,\r\n    And stand in the eyes of the flowers;\r\nAnd streams of tears are the trickling brooks,\r\n    Coursing adown the mountains.—\r\nDeparted the pride, and the glory of Mardi:\r\nThe vaunt of her isles sleeps deep in the sea.\r\nFast falls the small rain on its bosom that sobs.—\r\n    Not showers of rain, but the tears of Oro.\r\n\r\n\r\n“A dismal time it must have been,” yawned Media, “not a dry brook then\r\nin Mardi, not a lake that was not moist. Lachrymose rivulets, and\r\ninconsolable lagoons! Call you this poetry, minstrel?”\r\n\r\n“Mohi has something like a tear in his eye,” said Yoomy.\r\n\r\n“False!” cried Mohi, brushing it aside.\r\n\r\n“Who composed that monody?” said Babbalanja. “I have often heard it\r\nbefore.”\r\n\r\n“None know, Babbalanja but the poet must be still singing to himself;\r\nhis songs bursting through the turf in the flowers over his grave.”\r\n\r\n“But gentle Yoomy, Adondo is a legendary hero, indefinitely dating\r\nback. May not his monody, then, be a spontaneous melody, that has been\r\nwith us since Mardi began? What bard composed the soft verses that our\r\npalm boughs sing at even? Nay, Yoomy, that monody was not written by\r\nman.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! Would that I had been the poet, Babbalanja; for then had I been\r\nfamous indeed; those lines are chanted through all the isles, by prince\r\nand peasant. Yes, Adondo’s monody will pervade the ages, like the low\r\nunder-tone you hear, when many singers do sing.”\r\n\r\n“My lord, my lord,” cried Babbalanja, “but this were to be truly\r\nimmortal;—to be perpetuated in our works, and not in our names. Let me,\r\noh Oro! be anonymously known!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\nWherein Babbalanja Discourses Of Himself\r\n\r\n\r\nAn interval of silence was at last broken by Babbalanja.\r\n\r\nPointing to the sun, just gaining the horizon, he exclaimed, “As old\r\nBardianna says—shut your eyes, and believe.”\r\n\r\n“And what may Bardianna have to do with yonder orb?” said Media.\r\n\r\nThis much, my lord, the astronomers maintain that Mardi moves round the\r\nsun; which I, who never formally investigated the matter for myself,\r\ncan by no means credit; unless, plainly seeing one thing, I blindly\r\nbelieve another. Yet even thus blindly does all Mardi subscribe to an\r\nastronomical system, which not one in fifty thousand can astronomically\r\nprove. And not many centuries back, my lord, all Mardi did equally\r\nsubscribe to an astronomical system, precisely the reverse of that\r\nwhich they now believe. But the mass of Mardians have not as much\r\nreason to believe the first system, as the exploded one; for all who\r\nhave eyes must assuredly see, that the sun seems to move, and that\r\nMardi seems a fixture, eternally _here_. But doubtless there are\r\ntheories which may be true, though the face of things belie them.\r\nHence, in such cases, to the ignorant, disbelief would seem more\r\nnatural than faith; though they too often reject the testimony of their\r\nown senses, for what to them, is a mere hypothesis. And thus, my lord,\r\nis it, that the mass of Mardians do not believe because they know, but\r\nbecause they know not. And they are as ready to receive one thing as\r\nanother, if it comes from a canonical source. My lord, Mardi is as an\r\nostrich, which will swallow augh you offer, even a bar of iron, if\r\nplaced endwise. And though the iron be indigestible, yet it serves to\r\nfill: in feeding, the end proposed. For Mardi must have something to\r\nexercise its digestion, though that something be forever indigestible.\r\nAnd as fishermen for sport, throw two lumps of bait, united by a cord,\r\nto albatrosses floating on the sea; which are greedily attempted to be\r\nswallowed, one lump by this fowl, the other by that; but forever are\r\nkept reciprocally going up and down in them, by means of the cord; even\r\nso, my lord, do I sometimes fancy, that our theorists divert\r\nthem-selves with the greediness of Mardians to believe.”\r\n\r\n“Ha, ha,” cried Media, “methinks this must be Azzageddi who speaks.”\r\n\r\n“No, my lord; not long since, Azzageddi received a furlough to go home\r\nand warm himself for a while. But this leaves me not alone.”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“My lord,—for the present putting Azzageddi entirely aside,—though I\r\nhave now been upon terms of close companionship with myself for nigh\r\nfive hundred moons, I have not yet been able to decide who or what I\r\nam. To you, perhaps, I seem Babbalanja; but to myself, I seem not\r\nmyself. All I am sure of, is a sort of prickly sensation all over me,\r\nwhich they call life; and, occasionally, a headache or a queer conceit\r\nadmonishes me, that there is something astir in my attic. But how know\r\nI, that these sensations are identical with myself? For aught I know, I\r\nmay be somebody else. At any rate, I keep an eye on myself, as I would\r\non a stranger. There is something going on in me, that is independent\r\nof me. Many a time, have I willed to do one thing, and another has been\r\ndone. I will not say by myself, for I was not consulted about it; it\r\nwas done instinctively. My most virtuous thoughts are not born of my\r\nmusings, but spring up in me, like bright fancies to the poet;\r\nunsought, spontaneous. Whence they come I know not. I am a blind man\r\npushed from behind; in vain, I turn about to see what propels me. As\r\nvanity, I regard the praises of my friends; for what they commend\r\npertains not to me, Babbalanja; but to this unknown something that\r\nforces me to it. But why am I, a middle aged Mardian, less prone to\r\nexcesses than when a youth? The same inducements and allurements are\r\naround me. But no; my more ardent passions are burned out; those which\r\nare strongest when we are least able to resist them. Thus, then, my\r\nlord, it is not so much outer temptations that prevail over us mortals;\r\nbut inward instincts.”\r\n\r\n“A very curious speculation,” said Media. But Babbalanja, have you\r\nmortals no moral sense, as they call it?”\r\n\r\n“We have. But the thing you speak of is but an after-birth; we eat and\r\ndrink many months before we are conscious of thoughts. And though some\r\nadults would seem to refer all their actions to this moral sense, yet,\r\nin reality, it is not so; for, dominant in them, their moral sense\r\nbridles their instinctive passions; wherefore, they do not govern\r\nthemselves, but are governed by their very natures. Thus, some men in\r\nyouth are constitutionally as staid as I am now. But shall we pronounce\r\nthem pious and worthy youths for this? Does he abstain, who is not\r\nincited? And on the other hand, if the instinctive passions through\r\nlife naturally have the supremacy over the moral sense, as in extreme\r\ncases we see it developed in irreclaimable malefactors,—shall we\r\npronounce such, criminal and detestable wretches? My lord, it is easier\r\nfor some men to be saints, than for others not to be sinners.”\r\n\r\n“That will do, Babbalanja; you are on the verge, take not the leap! Go\r\nback whence you set out, and tell us of that other, and still more\r\nmysterious Azzageddi; him whom you hinted to have palmed himself off on\r\nyou for you yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, my lord,—Azzageddi still set aside,—upon that self-same\r\ninscrutable stranger, I charge all those past actions of mine, which in\r\nthe retrospect appear to me such eminent folly, that I am confident, it\r\nwas not I, Babbalanja, now speaking, that committed them. Nevertheless,\r\nmy lord, this very day I may do some act, which at a future period may\r\nseem equally senseless; for in one lifetime we live a hundred lives. By\r\nthe incomprehensible stranger in me, I say, this body of mine has been\r\nrented out scores of times, though always one dark chamber in me is\r\nretained by the old mystery.”\r\n\r\n“Will you never come to the mark, Babbalanja? Tell me something direct\r\nof the stranger. Who, what is he? Introduce him.”\r\n\r\n“My lord, I can not. He is locked up in me. In a mask, he dodges me. He\r\nprowls about in me, hither and thither; he peers, and I stare. This is\r\nhe who talks in my sleep, revealing my secrets; and takes me to unheard\r\nof realms, beyond the skies of Mardi. So present is he always, that I\r\nseem not so much to live of myself, as to be a mere apprehension of the\r\nunaccountable being that is in me. Yet all the time, this being is I,\r\nmyself.”\r\n\r\n“Babbalanja,” said Media, “you have fairly turned yourself inside out.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my lord,” said Mohi, “and he has so unsettled me, that I begin to\r\nthink all Mardi a square circle.”\r\n\r\n“How is that, Babbalanja,” said Media, “is a circle square?”\r\n\r\n“No, my lord, but ever since Mardi began, we Mardians have been\r\nessaying our best to square it.”\r\n\r\n“Cleverly retorted. Now, Babbalanja, do you not imagine, that you may\r\ndo harm by disseminating these sophisms of yours; which like your devil\r\ntheory, would seem to relieve all Mardi from moral accountability?”\r\n\r\n“My lord, at bottom, men wear no bonds that other men can strike off;\r\nand have no immunities, of which other men can deprive them. Tell a\r\ngood man that he is free to commit murder,—will he murder? Tell a\r\nmurderer that at the peril of his soul he indulges in murderous\r\nthoughts,—will that make him a saint?”\r\n\r\n“Again on the verge, Babbalanja? Take not the leap, I say.”\r\n\r\n“I can leap no more, my lord. Already I am down, down, down.”\r\n\r\n“Philosopher,” said Media, “what with Azzageddi, and the mysterious\r\nindweller you darkly hint of, I marvel not that you are puzzled to\r\ndecide upon your identity. But when do you seem most yourself?”\r\n\r\n“When I sleep, and dream not, my lord.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?”\r\n\r\n“Why then, a fool’s cap might be put on you, and you would not know\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“The very turban he ought to wear,” muttered Mohi.\r\n\r\n“Yet, my lord, I live while consciousness is not mine, while to all\r\nappearances I am a clod. And may not this same state of being, though\r\nbut alternate with me, be continually that of many dumb, passive\r\nobjects we so carelessly regard? Trust me, there are more things alive\r\nthan those that crawl, or fly, or swim. Think you, my lord, there is no\r\nsensation in being a tree? feeling the sap in one’s boughs, the breeze\r\nin one’s foliage? think you it is nothing to be a world? one of a herd,\r\nbison-like, wending its way across boundless meadows of ether? In the\r\nsight of a fowl, that sees not our souls, what are our own tokens of\r\nanimation? That we move, make a noise, have organs, pulses, and are\r\ncompounded of fluids and solids. And all these are in this Mardi as a\r\nunit. Daily the slow, majestic throbbings of its heart are perceptible\r\non the surface in the tides of the la-goon. Its rivers are its veins;\r\nwhen agonized, earthquakes are its throes; it shouts in the thunder,\r\nand weeps in the shower; and as the body of a bison is covered with\r\nhair, so Mardi is covered with grasses and vegetation, among which, we\r\nparasitical things do but crawl, vexing and tormenting the patient\r\ncreature to which we cling. Nor yet, hath it recovered from the pain of\r\nthe first foundation that was laid. Mardi is alive to its axis. When\r\nyou pour water, does it not gurgle? When you strike a pearl shell, does\r\nit not ring? Think you there is no sensation in being a rock?—To exist,\r\nis to be; to be, is to be something: to be something, is—”\r\n\r\n“Go on,” said Media.\r\n\r\n“And what is it, to be something?” said Yoomy artlessly. “Bethink\r\nyourself of what went before,” said Media.\r\n\r\n“Lose not the thread,” said Mohi.\r\n\r\n“It has snapped,” said Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n“I breathe again,” said Mohi.\r\n\r\n“But what a stepping-off place you came to then, philosopher,” said\r\nMedia. “By the way, is it not old Bardianna who says, that no Mardian\r\nshould undertake to walk, without keeping one foot foremost?”\r\n\r\n“To return to the vagueness of the notion I have of myself,” said\r\nBabbalanja.\r\n\r\n“An appropriate theme,” said Media, “proceed.”\r\n\r\n“My lord,” murmured Mohi, “Is not this philosopher like a centipede?\r\nCut off his head, and still he crawls.”\r\n\r\n“There are times when I fancy myself a lunatic,” resumed Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n“Ah, now he’s beginning to talk sense,” whispered Mohi.\r\n\r\n“Surely you forget, Babbalanja,” said Media. “How many more theories\r\nhave you? First, you are possessed by a devil; then rent yourself out\r\nto the indweller; and now turn yourself into a mad-house. You are\r\ninconsistent.”\r\n\r\n“And for that very reason, my lord, not inconsistent; for the sum of my\r\ninconsistencies makes up my consistency. And to be consistent to one’s\r\nself, is often to be inconsistent to Mardi. Common consistency implies\r\nunchangeableness; but much of the wisdom here below lives in a state of\r\ntransition.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” murmured Mold, “my head goes round again.”\r\n\r\n“Azzageddi aside, then, my lord, and also, for the nonce, the\r\nmysterious indweller, I come now to treat of myself as a lunatic. But\r\nthis last conceit is not so much based upon the madness of particular\r\nactions, as upon the whole drift of my ordinary and hourly ones; those,\r\nin which I most resemble all other Mardians. It seems like going\r\nthrough with some nonsensical whim-whams, destitute of fixed purpose.\r\nFor though many of my actions seem to have objects, and all of them\r\nsomehow run into each other; yet, where is the grand result? To what\r\nfinal purpose, do I walk about, eat, think, dream? To what great end,\r\ndoes Mohi there, now stroke his beard?”\r\n\r\n“But I was doing it unconsciously,” said Mohi, dropping his hand, and\r\nlifting his head.\r\n\r\n“Just what I would be at, old man. ‘What we do, we do blindly,’ says\r\nold Bardianna. Many things we do, we do without knowing,—as with you\r\nand your beard, Mohi. And many others we know not, in their true\r\nbearing at least, till they are past. Are not half our lives spent in\r\nreproaches for foregone actions, of the true nature and consequences of\r\nwhich, we were wholly ignorant at the time? Says old Bardianna, ‘Did I\r\nnot so often feel an appetite for my yams, I should think every thing a\r\ndream;’—so puzzling to him, seemed the things of this Mardi. But\r\nAlla-Malolla goes further. Says he, ‘Let us club together,\r\nfellow-riddles:—Kings, clowns, and intermediates. We are bundles of\r\ncomical sensations; we bejuggle ourselves into strange phantasies: we\r\nare air, wind, breath, bubbles; our being is told in a tick.’”\r\n\r\n“Now, then, Babbalanja,” said Media, “what have you come to in all this\r\nrhapsody? You everlastingly travel in a circle.”\r\n\r\n“And so does the sun in heaven, my lord; like me, it goes round, and\r\ngives light as it goes. Old Bardianna, too, revolved. He says so\r\nhimself. In his roundabout chapter on Cycles and Epicycles, with Notes\r\non the Ecliptic, he thus discourseth:—‘All things revolve upon some\r\ncenter, to them, fixed; for the centripetal is ever too much for the\r\ncentrifugal. Wherefore, it is a perpetual cycling with us, without\r\nprogression; and we fly round, whether we will or no. To stop, were to\r\nsink into space. So, over and over we go, and round and round;\r\ndouble-shuffle, on our axis, and round the sun.’ In an another place,\r\nhe says:—‘There is neither apogee nor perigee, north nor south, right\r\nnor left; what to-night is our zenith, to-morrow is our nadir; stand as\r\nwe will, we stand on our heads; essay to spring into the air, and down\r\nwe come; here we stick; our very bones make glue.’”\r\n\r\n“Enough, enough, Babbalanja,” cried Media. “You are a very wise\r\nMardian; but the wisest Mardians make the most consummate fools.”\r\n\r\n“So they do, my lord; but I was interrupted. I was about to say, that\r\nthere is no place but the universe; no limit but the limitless; no\r\nbottom but the bottomless.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\nOf The Sorcerers In The Isle Of Minda\r\n\r\n\r\n“Tiffin! tiffin!” cried Media; “time for tiffin! Up, comrades! and\r\nwhile the mat is being spread, walk we to the bow, and inhale the\r\nbreeze for an appetite. Hark ye, Vee-Vee! forget not that calabash with\r\nthe sea-blue seal, and a round ring for a brand. Rare old stuff, that,\r\nMohi; older than you: the circumnavigator, I call it. My sire had a\r\ncanoe launched for the express purpose of carrying it thrice round\r\nMardi for a flavor. It was many moons on the voyage; the mariners never\r\nsailed faster than three knots. Ten would spoil the best wine ever\r\nfloated.”\r\n\r\nTiffin over, and the blue-sealed calabash all but hid in the great\r\ncloud raised by our pipes, Media proposed to board it in the smoke. So,\r\ngoblet in hand, we all gallantly charged, and came off victorious from\r\nthe fray.\r\n\r\nThen seated again, and serenely puffing in a circle, the\r\ncircumnavigator meanwhile pleasantly going the rounds, Media called\r\nupon Mohi for something entertaining.\r\n\r\nNow, of all the old gossips in Mardi, surely our delightful old\r\nDiodorus was furnished with the greatest possible variety of histories,\r\nchronicles, anecdotes, memoirs, legends, traditions, and biographies.\r\nThere was no end to the library he carried. In himself, he was the\r\nwhole history of Mardi, amplified, not abridged, in one volume.\r\n\r\nIn obedience, then, to King Media’s command, Mohi regaled the company\r\nwith a narrative, in substance as follows:—\r\n\r\nIn a certain quarter of the Archipelago was an island called Minda; and\r\nin Minda were many sorcerers, employed in the social differences and\r\nanimosities of the people of that unfortunate land. If a Mindarian\r\ndeemed himself aggrieved or insulted by a countryman, he forthwith\r\nrepaired to one of these sorcerers; who, for an adequate consideration,\r\nset to work with his spells, keeping himself in the dark, and directing\r\nthem against the obnoxious individual. And full soon, by certain\r\npeculiar sensations, this individual, discovering what was going on,\r\nwould straightway hie to his own professor of the sable art, who, being\r\nwell feed, in due time brought about certain counter-charms, so that in\r\nthe end it sometimes fell out that neither party was gainer or loser,\r\nsave by the sum of his fees.\r\n\r\nBut the worst of it was, that in some cases all knowledge of these\r\nspells were at the outset hidden from the victim; who, hearing too late\r\nof the mischief brewing, almost always fell a prey to his foe; which\r\ncalamity was held the height of the art. But as the great body of\r\nsorcerers were about matched in point of skill, it followed that the\r\nparties employing them were so likewise. Hence arose those interminable\r\ncontests, in which many moons were spent, both parties toiling after\r\ntheir common destruction.\r\n\r\nIndeed, to say nothing of the obstinacy evinced by their employers, it\r\nwas marvelous, the pertinacity of the sorcerers themselves. To the very\r\nlast tooth in their employer’s pouches, they would stick to their\r\nspells; never giving over till he was financially or physically\r\ndefunct.\r\n\r\nBut much as they were vilified, no people in Minda were half so\r\ndisinterested as they. Certain indispensable conditions secured, some\r\nof them were as ready to undertake the perdition of one man as another;\r\ngood, bad, or indifferent, it made little matter.\r\n\r\nWhat wonder, then, that such abominable mercenaries should cause a\r\nmighty deal of mischief in Minda; privately going about, inciting\r\npeaceable folks to enmities with their neighbors; and with marvelous\r\nalacrity, proposing themselves as the very sorcerers to rid them of the\r\nannoyances suggested as existing.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it even happened that a sorcerer would be secretly retained to\r\nwork spells upon a victim, who, from his bodily sensations, suspecting\r\nsomething wrong, but knowing not what, would repair to that self-same\r\nsorcerer, engaging him to counteract any mischief that might be\r\nbrewing. And this worthy would at once undertake the business; when,\r\nhaving both parties in his hands, he kept them forever in suspense;\r\nmeanwhile seeing to it well, that they failed not in handsomely\r\nremunerating him for his pains.\r\n\r\nAt one time, there was a prodigious excitement about these sorcerers,\r\ngrowing out of some alarming revelations concerning their practices. In\r\nseveral villages of Minda, they were sought to be put down. But\r\nfruitless the attempt; it was soon discovered that already their spells\r\nwere so spread abroad, and they themselves so mixed up with the\r\neveryday affairs of the isle, that it was better to let their vocation\r\nalone, than, by endeavoring to suppress it, breed additional troubles.\r\nAh! they were a knowing and a cunning set, those sorcerers; very hard\r\nto overcome, cajole, or circumvent.\r\n\r\nBut in the name of the Magi, what were these spells of theirs, so\r\npotent and occult? On all hands it was agreed, that they derived their\r\ngreatest virtue from the fumes of certain compounds, whose\r\ningredients—horrible to tell—were mostly obtained from the human heart;\r\nand that by variously mixing these ingredients, they adapted their\r\nmultifarious enchantments.\r\n\r\nThey were a vain and arrogant race. Upon the strength of their dealing\r\nin the dark, they affected even more mystery than belonged to them;\r\nwhen interrogated concerning their science, would confound the inquirer\r\nby answers couched in an extraordinary jargon, employing words almost\r\nas long as anacondas. But all this greatly prevailed with the common\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nNor was it one of the least remarkable things, that oftentimes two\r\nsorcerers, contrarily employed upon a Mindarian,—one to attack, the\r\nother to defend,—would nevertheless be upon the most friendly terms\r\nwith each other; which curious circumstance never begat the slightest\r\nsuspicions in the mind of the victim.\r\n\r\nAnother phenomenon: If from any cause, two sorcerers fell out, they\r\nseldom exercised their spells upon each other; ascribable to this,\r\nperhaps,—that both being versed in the art, neither could hope to get\r\nthe advantage.\r\n\r\nBut for all the opprobrium cast upon these sorcerers, part of which\r\nthey deserved, the evils imputed to them were mainly, though\r\nindirectly, ascribable to the very persons who abused them; nay, to the\r\nvery persons who employed them; the latter being by far the loudest in\r\ntheir vilifyings; for which, indeed, they had excellent reason.\r\n\r\nNor was it to be denied, that in certain respects, the sorcerers were\r\nproductive of considerable good. The nature of their pursuits leading\r\nthem deep into the arcana of mind, they often lighted upon important\r\ndiscoveries; along with much that was cumbersome, accumulated valuable\r\nexamples concerning the inner working of the hearts of the Mindarians;\r\nand often waxed eloquent in elucidating the mysteries of iniquity.\r\n\r\nYet was all this their lore graven upon so uncouth, outlandish, and\r\nantiquated tablets, that it was all but lost to the mass of their\r\ncountrymen; and some old sachem of a wise man is quoted as having said,\r\nthat their treasures were locked up after such a fashion, that for old\r\niron, the key was worth more than the chest and its contents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\nChiefly Of Sing Bello\r\n\r\n\r\n“Now Taji,” said Media, “with old Bello of the Hump whose island of\r\nDominora is before us, I am at variance.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! How so?”\r\n\r\n“A dull recital, but you shall have it.”\r\n\r\nAnd forthwith his Highness began.\r\n\r\nThis princely quarrel originated, it seems, in a slight jostling\r\nconcerning the proprietorship of a barren islet in a very remote\r\nquarter of the lagoon. At the outset the matter might have been easily\r\nadjusted, had the parties but exchanged a few amicable words. But each\r\ndisdaining to visit the other, to discuss so trivial an affair, the\r\nbusiness of negotiating an understanding was committed to certain\r\nplenipos, men with lengthy tongues, who scorned to utter a word short\r\nof a polysyllable.\r\n\r\nNow, the more these worthies penetrated into the difficulty, the wider\r\nbecame the breach; till what was at first a mere gap, became a yawning\r\ngulf.\r\n\r\nBut that which had perhaps tended more than any thing else to deepen\r\nthe variance of the kings, was hump-backed Bello’s dispatching to Odo,\r\nas his thirtieth plenipo, a diminutive little negotiator, who all by\r\nhimself, in a solitary canoe, sailed over to have audience of Media;\r\ninto whose presence he was immediately ushered.\r\n\r\nDarting one glance at him, the king turned to his chieftains, and\r\nsaid:—“By much straining of your eyes, my lords, can you perceive this\r\ninsignificant manikin? What! are there no tall men in Dominora, that\r\nKing Bello must needs send this dwarf hither?”\r\n\r\nAnd charging his attendents to feed the embassador extraordinary with\r\nthe soft pap of the cocoanut, and provide nurses during his stay, the\r\nmonarch retired from the arbor of audience.\r\n\r\n“As I am a man,” shouted the despised plenipo, raising himself on his\r\ntoes, “my royal master will resent this affront!—A dwarf, forsooth!—\r\nThank Oro, I am no long-drawn giant! There is as much stuff in me, as\r\nin others; what is spread out in their clumsy carcasses, in me is\r\ncondensed. I am much in little! And that much, thou shalt know full\r\nsoon, disdainful King of Odo!”\r\n\r\n“Speak not against our lord the king,” cried the attendants.\r\n\r\n“And speak not ye to me, ye headless spear poles!”\r\n\r\nAnd so saying, under sufferance of being small, the plenipo was\r\npermitted to depart unmolested; for all his bravadoes, fobbing his\r\ncredentials and affronts.\r\n\r\nApprized of his servant’s ignoble reception, the choleric Bello burst\r\nforth in a storm of passion; issuing orders for, one thousand conch\r\nshells to be blown, and his warriors to assemble by land and by sea.\r\n\r\nBut bethinking him of the hostilities that might ensue, the sagacious\r\nMedia hit upon an honorable expedient to ward off an event for which he\r\nwas then unprepared. With all haste he dispatched to the hump-backed\r\nking a little dwarf of his own; who voyaging over to Dominora in a\r\ncanoe, sorry and solitary as that of Bello’s plenipo, in like manner,\r\nreceived the same insults. The effect whereof, was, to strike a balance\r\nof affronts; upon the principle, that a blow given, heals one received.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, these proceedings but amounted to a postponement of\r\nhostilities; for soon after, nothing prevented the two kings from\r\nplunging into war, but the following judicious considerations. First:\r\nMedia was almost afraid of being beaten. Second: Bello was almost\r\nafraid to conquer. Media, because he was inferior in men and arms;\r\nBello, because, his aggrandizement was already a subject of warlike\r\ncomment among the neighboring kings.\r\n\r\nIndeed, did the old chronicler Braid-Beard speak truth, there were some\r\ntribes in Mardi, that accounted this king of Dominora a testy,\r\nquarrelsome, rapacious old monarch; the indefatigable breeder of\r\ncontentions and wars; the elder brother of this household of nations,\r\nperpetually essaying to lord it over the juveniles; and though his\r\npatrimonial dominions were situated to the north of the lagoon, not the\r\nslightest misunderstanding took place between the rulers of the most\r\ndistant islands, than this doughty old cavalier on a throne, forthwith\r\nthrust his insolent spear into the matter, though it in no wise\r\nconcerned him, and fell to irritating all parties by his gratuitous\r\ninterference.\r\n\r\nEspecially was he officious in the concerns of Porpheero, a neighboring\r\nisland, very large and famous, whose numerous broad valleys were\r\ndivided among many rival kings:—the king of Franko, a small-framed,\r\npoodle-haired, fine, fiery gallant; finical in his tatooing; much given\r\nto the dance and glory;—the king of Ibeereea, a tall and stately\r\ncavalier, proud, generous, punctilious, temperate in wine; one hand\r\nforever on his javelin, the other, in superstitious homage, lifted to\r\nhis gods; his limbs all over marks of stakes and crosses;—the king of\r\nLuzianna; a slender, dark-browed thief; at times wrapped in a moody\r\nrobe, beneath which he fumbled something, as if it were a dagger; but\r\notherwise a sprightly troubadour, given to serenades and\r\nmoonlight;—-the many chiefs of sunny Latianna; minstrel monarchs, full\r\nof song and sentiment; fiercer in love than war; glorious bards of\r\nfreedom; but rendering tribute while they sang;—the priest-king of\r\nVatikanna; his chest marked over with antique tatooings; his crown, a\r\ncowl; his rusted scepter swaying over falling towers, and crumbling\r\nmounds; full of the superstitious past; askance, eyeing the suspicious\r\ntime to come;—the king of Hapzaboro; portly, pleasant; a lover of wild\r\nboar’s meat; a frequent quaffer from the can; in his better moods, much\r\nfancying solid comfort;—the eight-and-thirty banded kings, chieftains,\r\nseigniors, and oligarchies of the broad hill and dale of Tutoni;\r\nclubbing together their domains, that none might wrest his neighbor’s;\r\nan earnest race; deep thinkers, deeper drinkers; long pipes, long\r\nheads; their wise ones given to mystic cogitations, and consultations\r\nwith the devil;—the twin kings of Zandinavia; hardy, frugal\r\nmountaineers; upright of spine and heart; clad in skins of bears;—the\r\nking of Jutlanda; much like their Highnesses of Zandinavia; a seal-skin\r\ncap his crown; a fearless sailor of his frigid seas;—the king of\r\nMuzkovi; a shaggy, icicled White-bear of a despot in the north; said to\r\nreign over millions of acres of glaciers; had vast provinces of\r\nsnow-drifts, and many flourishing colonies among the floating icebergs.\r\nAbsolute in his rule as Predestination in metaphysics, did he command\r\nall his people to give up the ghost, it would be held treason to die\r\nlast. Very precise and foppish in his imperial tastes was this monarch.\r\nDisgusted with the want of uniformity in the stature of his subjects,\r\nhe was said to nourish thoughts of killing off all those below his\r\nprescribed standard—six feet, long measure. Immortal souls were of no\r\naccount in his fatal wars; since, in some of his serf-breeding estates,\r\nthey were daily manufactured to order.\r\n\r\nNow, to all the above-mentioned monarchs, old Bello would frequently\r\ndispatch heralds; announcing, for example, his unalterable resolution,\r\nto espouse the cause of this king, against that; at the very time,\r\nperhaps, that their Serene Superfluities, instead of crossing spears,\r\nwere touching flagons. And upon these occasions, the kings would often\r\nsend back word to old Bello, that instead of troubling himself with\r\ntheir concerns, he might far better attend to his own; which, they\r\nhinted, were in a sad way, and much needed reform.\r\n\r\nThe royal old warrior’s pretext for these and all similar proceedings,\r\nwas the proper adjustment in Porpheero, of what he facetiously styled\r\nthe “Equipoise of Calabashes;” which he stoutly swore was essential to\r\nthe security of the various tribes in that country.\r\n\r\n“But who put the balance into thy hands, King Bello?” cried the\r\nindignant nations.\r\n\r\n“Oro!” shouted the hump-backed king, shaking his javelin.\r\n\r\nSuperadded to the paternal interest which Bello betrayed in the\r\nconcerns of the kings of Porpheero, according to our chronicler, he\r\nalso manifested no less interest in those of the remotest islands.\r\nIndeed, where he found a rich country, inhabited by a people, deemed by\r\nhim barbarous and incapable of wise legislation, he sometimes relieved\r\nthem from their political anxieties, by assuming the dictatorship over\r\nthem. And if incensed at his conduct, they flew to their spears, they\r\nwere accounted rebels, and treated accordingly. But as old Mohi very\r\ntruly observed,—herein, Bello was not alone; for throughout Mardi, all\r\nstrong nations, as well as all strong men, loved to govern the weak.\r\nAnd those who most taunted King Bello for his political rapacity, were\r\nopen to the very same charge. So with Vivenza, a distant island, at\r\ntimes very loud in denunciations of Bello, as a great national brigand.\r\nNot yet wholly extinct in Vivenza, were its aboriginal people, a race\r\nof wild Nimrods and hunters, who year by year were driven further and\r\nfurther into remoteness, till as one of their sad warriors said, after\r\ncontinual removes along the log, his race was on the point of being\r\nremorselessly pushed off the end.\r\n\r\nNow, Bello was a great geographer, and land surveyor, and gauger of the\r\nseas. Terraqueous Mardi, he was continually exploring in quest of\r\nstrange empires. Much he loved to take the altitude of lofty mountains,\r\nthe depth of deep rivers, the breadth of broad isles. Upon the highest\r\npinnacles of commanding capes and promontories, he loved to hoist his\r\nflag. He circled Mardi with his watch-towers: and the distant voyager\r\npassing wild rocks in the remotest waters, was startled by hearing the\r\ntattoo, or the reveille, beating from hump-backed Bello’s omnipresent\r\ndrum. Among Antartic glaciers, his shrill bugle calls mingled with the\r\nscream of the gulls; and so impressed seemed universal nature with the\r\nsense of his dominion, that the very clouds in heaven never sailed over\r\nDominora without rendering the tribute of a shower; whence the air of\r\nDominora was more moist than that of any other clime.\r\n\r\nIn all his grand undertakings, King Bello was marvelously assisted by\r\nhis numerous fleets of war-canoes; his navy being the largest in Mardi.\r\nHence his logicians swore that the entire Lagoon was his; and that all\r\nprowling whales, prowling keels, and prowling sharks were invaders. And\r\nwith this fine conceit to inspire them, his poets-laureat composed some\r\nglorious old saltwater odes, enough to make your very soul sing to hear\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut though the rest of Mardi much delighted to list to such noble\r\nminstrelsy, they agreed not with Bello’s poets in deeming the lagoon\r\ntheir old monarch’s hereditary domain.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, the paddlers of the hump-backed king, meeting upon\r\nthe broad lagoon certain canoes belonging to the before-mentioned\r\nisland of Vivenza; these paddlers seized upon several of their\r\noccupants; and feeling their pulses, declared them born men of\r\nDominora; and therefore, not free to go whithersoever they would; for,\r\nunless they could somehow get themselves born over again, they must\r\nforever remain subject to Bello. Shed your hair; nay, your skin, if you\r\nwill, but shed your allegiance you can not; while you have bones, they\r\nare Bello’s. So, spite of all expostulations and attempts to prove\r\nalibis, these luckless paddlers were dragged into the canoes of\r\nDominora, and commanded to paddle home their captors.\r\n\r\nWhereof hearing, the men of Vivenza were thrown into a great ferment;\r\nand after a mighty pow-wow over their council fire, fitting out several\r\ndouble-keeled canoes, they sallied out to sea, in quest of those, whom\r\nthey styled the wholesale corsairs of Dominora.\r\n\r\nBut lucky perhaps it was, that at this juncture, in all parts of Mardi,\r\nthe fleets of the hump-backed king, were fighting, gunwale and gunwale,\r\nalongside of numerous foes; else there had borne down upon the canoes\r\nof the men of Vivenza so tremendous an armada, that the very swell\r\nunder its thousand prows might have flooded their scattered proas\r\nforever out of sight.\r\n\r\nAs it was, Bello dispatched a few of his smaller craft to seek out, and\r\nincidentally run down the enemy; and without returning home,\r\nstraightway proceed upon more important enterprises.\r\n\r\nBut it so chanced, that Bello’s crafts, one by one meeting the foe, in\r\nmost cases found the canoes of Vivenza much larger than their own; and\r\nmanned by more men, with hearts bold as theirs; whence, in the\r\nship-duels that ensued, they were worsted; and the canoes of Vivenza,\r\nlocking their yard-arms into those of the vanquished, very courteously\r\ngallanted them into their coral harbors.\r\n\r\nSolely imputing these victories to their superior intrepidity and\r\nskill, the people of Vivenza were exceedingly boisterous in their\r\ntriumph; raising such obstreperous peans, that they gave themselves\r\nhoarse throats; insomuch, that according to Mohi, some of the present\r\ngeneration are fain to speak through their noses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\nDominora And Vivenza\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three canoes still gliding on, some further particulars were\r\nnarrated concerning Dominora; and incidentally, of other isles.\r\n\r\nIt seems that his love of wide dominion sometimes led the otherwise\r\nsagacious Bello into the most extravagant actions. If the chance\r\naccumulation of soil and drift-wood about any detached shelf of coral\r\nin the lagoon held forth the remotest possibility of the eventual\r\nexistence of an islet there, with all haste he dispatched canoes to the\r\nspot, to take prospective possession of the as yet nearly submarine\r\nterritory; and if possible, eject the zoophytes.\r\n\r\nDuring an unusually low tide, here and there baring the outer reef of\r\nthe Archipelago, Bello caused his royal spear to be planted upon every\r\nplace thus exposed, in token of his supreme claim thereto.\r\n\r\nAnother anecdote was this: that to Dominora there came a rumor, that in\r\na distant island dwelt a man with an uncommonly large nose; of most\r\nportentous dimensions, indeed; by the soothsayers supposed to\r\nforeshadow some dreadful calamity. But disregarding these superstitious\r\nconceits, Bello forthwith dispatched an agent, to discover whether this\r\nhuge promontory of a nose was geographically available; if so, to\r\nsecure the same, by bringing the proprietor back.\r\n\r\nNow, by sapient old Mohi, it was esteemed a very happy thing for Mardi\r\nat large, that the subjects whom Bello sent to populate his foreign\r\nacquisitions, were but too apt to throw off their vassalage, so soon as\r\nthey deemed themselves able to cope with him.\r\n\r\nIndeed, a fine country in the western part of Mardi, in this very\r\nmanner, became a sovereign—nay, a republican state. It was the nation\r\nto which Mohi had previously alluded—Vivenza. But in the flush and\r\npride of having recently attained their national majority, the men of\r\nVivenza were perhaps too much inclined to carry a vauntful crest. And\r\nbecause intrenched in their fastnesses, after much protracted fighting,\r\nthey had eventually succeeded in repelling the warriors dispatched by\r\nBello to crush their insurrection, they were unanimous in the opinion,\r\nthat the hump-backed king had never before been so signally chastised.\r\nWhereas, they had not so much vanquished Bello, as defended their\r\nshores; even as a young lion will protect its den against legions of\r\nunicorns, though, away from home, he might be torn to pieces. In truth,\r\nBraid-Beard declared, that at the time of this war, Dominora couched\r\nten long spears for every short javelin Vivenza could dart; though the\r\njavelins were stoutly hurled as the spears.\r\n\r\nBut, superior in men and arms, why, at last, gave over King Bello the\r\nhope of reducing those truculent men of Vivenza? One reason was, as\r\nMohi said, that many of his fighting men were abundantly occupied in\r\nother quarters of Mardi; nor was he long in discovering that fight he\r\nnever so valiantly, Vivenza—not yet its inhabitants—was wholly\r\nunconquerable. Thought Bello, Mountains are sturdy foes; fate hard to\r\ndam.\r\n\r\nYet, the men of Vivenza were no dastards; not to lie, coming from\r\nlion-like loins, they were a lion-loined race. Did not their bards\r\npronounce them a fresh start in the Mardian species; requiring a new\r\nworld for their full development? For be it known, that the great land\r\nof Kolumbo, no inconsiderable part of which was embraced by Vivenza,\r\nwas the last island discovered in the Archipelago.\r\n\r\nIn good round truth, and as if an impartialist from Arcturus spoke it,\r\nVivenza was a noble land. Like a young tropic tree she stood, laden\r\ndown with greenness, myriad blossoms, and the ripened fruit\r\nthick-hanging from one bough. She was promising as the morning.\r\n\r\nOr Vivenza might be likened to St. John, feeding on locusts and wild\r\nhoney, and with prophetic voice, crying to the nations from the\r\nwilderness. Or, child-like, standing among the old robed kings and\r\nemperors of the Archipelago, Vivenza seemed a young Messiah, to whose\r\ndiscourse the bearded Rabbis bowed.\r\n\r\nSo seemed Vivenza in its better aspect. Nevertheless, Vivenza was a\r\nbraggadocio in Mardi; the only brave one ever known. As an army of\r\nspurred and crested roosters, her people chanticleered at the\r\nresplendent rising of their sun. For shame, Vivenza! Whence thy\r\nundoubted valor? Did ye not bring it with ye from the bold old shores\r\nof Dominora, where there is a fullness of it left? What isle but\r\nDominora could have supplied thee with that stiff spine of thine?— That\r\nheart of boldest beat? Oh, Vivenza! know that true grandeur is too big\r\nfor a boast; and nations, as well as men, may be too clever to be\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nBut what more of King Bello? Notwithstanding his territorial\r\nacquisitiveness, and aversion to relinquishing stolen nations, he was\r\nyet a glorious old king; rather choleric—a word and a blow—but of a\r\nright royal heart. Rail at him as they might, at bottom, all the isles\r\nwere proud of him. And almost in spite of his rapacity, upon the whole,\r\nperhaps, they were the better for his deeds. For if sometimes he did\r\nevil with no very virtuous intentions, he had fifty, ways of\r\naccomplishing good with the best; and a thousand ways of doing good\r\nwithout meaning it. According to an ancient oracle, the hump-backed\r\nmonarch was but one of the most conspicuous pieces on a board, where\r\nthe gods played for their own entertainment.\r\n\r\nBut here it must not be omitted, that of late, King Bello had somewhat\r\nabated his efforts to extend his dominions. Various causes were\r\nassigned. Some thought it arose from the fact that already he found his\r\nterritories too extensive for one scepter to rule; that his more remote\r\ncolonies largely contributed to his tribulations, without\r\ncorrespondingly contributing to his revenues. Others affirmed that his\r\nhump was getting too mighty for him to carry; others still, that the\r\nnations were waving too strong for him. With prophetic solemnity,\r\nhead-shaking sages averred that he was growing older and older had\r\npassed his grand climacteric; and though it was a hale old age with\r\nhim, yet it was not his lusty youth; that though he was daily getting\r\nrounder, and rounder in girth, and more florid of face, that these,\r\nhowbeit, were rather the symptoms of a morbid obesity, than of a\r\nhealthful robustness. These wise ones predicted that very soon poor\r\nBello would go off in an apoplexy.\r\n\r\nBut in Vivenza there were certain blusterers, who often thus prated:\r\n“The Hump-back’s hour is come; at last the old teamster will be gored\r\nby the nations he’s yoked; his game is done,—let him show his hand and\r\nthrow up his scepter; he cumbers Mardi,—let him be cut down and burned;\r\nhe stands in the way of his betters,—let him sheer to one side; he has\r\nshut up many eyes, and now himself grows blind; he hath committed\r\nhorrible atrocities during his long career, the old sinner! —now, let\r\nhim quickly say his prayers and be beheaded.”\r\n\r\nHowbeit, Bello lived on; enjoying his dinners, and taking his jorums as\r\nof yore. Ah, I have yet a jolly long lease of life, thought he over his\r\nwine; and like unto some obstinate old uncle, he persisted in\r\nflourishing, in spite of the prognostications of the nephew nations,\r\nwhich at his demise, perhaps hoped to fall heir to odd parts of his\r\npossessions: Three streaks of fat valleys to one of lean mountains!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\nThey Land At Dominora\r\n\r\n\r\nAs erewhile recounted, not being on the best terms in Mardi with the\r\nKing of Dominora, Media saw fit to draw nigh unto his dominions in\r\nhaughty state; he (Media) being upon excellent terms with himself. Our\r\nsails were set, our paddles paddling, streamers streaming, and Vee-Vee\r\nin the shark’s mouth, clamorous with his conch. The din was soon heard;\r\nand sweeping into a fine broad bay we beheld its margin seemingly\r\npebbled in the distance with heads; so populous the land.\r\n\r\nWinding through a noble valley, we presently came to Bello’s palace,\r\ncouchant and bristling in a grove. The upright canes composing its\r\nfront projected above the eaves in a long row of spear-heads fluttering\r\nwith scarlet pennons; while below, from the intervals of the canes,\r\nwere slantingly thrust three tiers of decorated lances. A warlike\r\naspect! The entire structure looking like the broadside of the\r\nMacedonian phalanx, advancing to the charge, helmeted with a roof.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Bello,” said Media, “thou dwellest among thy quills like the\r\nporcupine.”\r\n\r\n“I feel a prickly heat coming over me,” cried Mohi, “my lord Media, let\r\nus enter.”\r\n\r\n“Ay,” said Babbalanja, “safer the center of peril, than the\r\ncircumference.”\r\n\r\nPassing under an arch, formed by two pikes crossed, we found ourselves\r\ntargets in prospective, for certain flingers of javelins, with poised\r\nweapons, occupying the angles of the palace.\r\n\r\nFronting us, stood a portly old warrior, spear in hand, hump on back,\r\nand fire in eye.\r\n\r\n“Is it war?” he cried, pointing his pike, “or peace?” reversing it.\r\n\r\n“Peace,” said Media.\r\n\r\nWhereupon advancing, King Bello courteously welcomed us.\r\n\r\nHe was an arsenal to behold: Upon his head the hereditary crown of\r\nDominora,—a helmet of the sea-porcupine’s hide, bristling all over with\r\nspikes, in front displaying a river-horse’s horn, leveled to the\r\ncharge; thrust through his ears were barbed arrows; and from his dyed\r\nshark-skin girdle, depended a kilt of strung javelins.\r\n\r\nThe broad chest of Bello was the chart of Mardi. Tattooed in sea-blue\r\nwere all the groups and clusters of the Archipelago; and every time he\r\nbreathed, rose and fell the isles, as by a tide: Dominora full upon his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nHis sturdy thighs were his triumphal arch; whereon in numerous\r\nmedallions, crests, and shields, were blazoned all his victories by sea\r\nand land.\r\n\r\nHis strong right arm was Dominora’s scroll of Fame, where all her\r\nheroes saw their names recorded.—An endless roll!\r\n\r\nOur chronicler avouched, that on the sole of Bello’s dexter foot was\r\nstamped the crest of Franko’s king, his hereditary foe. “Thus, thus,”\r\ncried Bello, stamping, “thus I hourly crush him.”\r\n\r\nIn stature, Bello was a mountaineer; but, as over some tall tower\r\nimpends the hill-side cliff, so Bello’s Athos hump hung over him. Could\r\nit be, as many of his nobles held, that the old monarch’s hump was his\r\nsensorium and source of strength; full of nerves, muscles, ganglions\r\nand tendons? Yet, year by year it grew, ringed like the bole of his\r\npalms. The toils of war increased it. But another skirmish with the\r\nisles, said the wiseacres of Porpheero, and Bello’s mount will crush\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAgainst which calamity to guard, his medicos and Sangredos sought the\r\nhump’s reduction. But down it would not come. Then by divers mystic\r\nrites, his magi tried. Making a deep pit, many teeth they dropped\r\ntherein. But they could not fill it. Hence, they called it the Sinking\r\nPit, for bottom it had none. Nevertheless, the magi said, when this pit\r\nis filled, Bello’s hump you’ll see no more. “Then, hurrah for the\r\nhump!” cried the nobles, “for he will never hurl it off. Long life to\r\nthe hump! By the hump we will rally and die! Cheer up, King Bello!\r\nStand up, old king!”\r\n\r\nBut these were they, who when their sovereign went abroad, with that\r\nAthos on his back, followed idly in its shade; while Bello leaned\r\nheavily upon his people, staggering as they went.\r\n\r\nAy, sorely did Bello’s goodly stature lean; but though many swore he\r\nsoon must fall; nevertheless, like Pisa’s Leaning Tower, he may long\r\nlean over, yet never nod.\r\n\r\nVisiting Dominora in a friendly way, in good time, we found King Bello\r\nvery affable; in hospitality, almost exceeding portly Borabolla:\r\nOctober-plenty reigned throughout his palace borders.\r\n\r\nOur first reception over, a sumptuous repast was served, at which much\r\nlively talk was had.\r\n\r\nOf Taji, Bello sought to know, whether his solar Majesty had yet made a\r\nprovince of the moon; whether the Astral hosts were of much account as\r\nterritories, or mere Motoos, as the little tufts of verdure are\r\ndenominated, here and there clinging to Mardi’s circle reef; whether\r\nthe people in the sun vilified, him (Bello) as they did in Mardi; and\r\nwhat they thought of an event, so ominous to the liberties of the\r\nuniverse, as the addition to his navy of three large canoes.\r\n\r\nEre long, so fused in social love we grew, that Bello, filling high his\r\ncan, and clasping Media’s palm, drank everlasting amity with Odo.\r\n\r\nSo over their red cups, the two kings forgot their differences, and\r\nconcerning the disputed islet nothing more was ever heard; especially,\r\nas it so turned out, that while they were most hot about it, it had\r\nsuddenly gone out of sight, being of volcanic origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\nThrough Dominora, They Wander After Yillah\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last, withdrawing from the presence of King Bello, we went forth,\r\nstill intent on our search.\r\n\r\nMany brave sights we saw. Fair fields; the whole island a garden; green\r\nhedges all round; neat lodges, thick as white mice in the landscape;\r\nold oak woods, hale and hearty as ever; old temples buried in ivy; old\r\nshrines of old heroes, deep buried in broad groves of bay trees; old\r\nrivers laden down with heavy-freighted canoes; humped hills, like\r\ndroves of camels, piled up with harvests; every sign and token of a\r\nglorious abundance, every sign and token of generations of renown. Rare\r\nsight! fine sight! none rarer, none finer in Mardi.\r\n\r\nBut roving on through this ravishing region, we passed through a corn-\r\nfield in full beard, where a haggard old reaper laid down his hook,\r\nbeseeching charity for the sake of the gods.—“Bread, bread! or I die\r\nmid these sheaves!”\r\n\r\n“Thrash out your grain, and want not.”\r\n\r\n“Alas, masters, this grain is not mine; I plough, I sow, I reap, I\r\nbind, I stack,—Lord Primo garners.”\r\n\r\nRambling on, we came to a hamlet, hidden in a hollow; and beneath\r\nweeping willows saw many mournful maidens seated on a bank; beside\r\neach, a wheel that was broken. “Lo, we starve,” they cried, “our\r\ndistaffs are snapped; no more may we weave and spin!”\r\n\r\nThen forth issued from vaults clamorous crowds of men, hands tied to\r\ntheir backs.—“Bread! Bread!” they cried. “The magician hath turned us\r\nout from our glen, where we labored of yore in the days of the merry\r\nGreen Queen. He has pinioned us hip and arm that we starve. Like sheep\r\nwe die off with the rot.—Curse on the magician. A curse on his spell.”\r\n\r\nBending our steps toward the glen, roaring down the rocks we descried a\r\nstream from the mountains. But ere those waters gained the sea, vassal\r\ntribute they rendered. Conducted through culverts and moats, they\r\nturned great wheels, giving life to ten thousand fangs and fingers,\r\nwhose gripe no power could withstand, yet whose touch was soft as the\r\nvelvet paw of a kitten. With brute force, they heaved down great\r\nweights, then daintily wove and spun; like the trunk of the elephant,\r\nwhich lays lifeless a river-horse, and counts the pulses of a moth. On\r\nall sides, the place seemed alive with its spindles. Round and round,\r\nround and round; throwing off wondrous births at every revolving;\r\nceaseless as the cycles that circle in heaven. Loud hummed the loom,\r\nflew the shuttle like lightning, red roared the grim forge, rung anvil\r\nand sledge; yet no mortal was seen.\r\n\r\n“What ho, magician! Come forth from thy cave!”\r\n\r\nBut all deaf were the spindles, as the mutes, that mutely wait on the\r\nSultan.\r\n\r\n“Since we are born, we will live!” so we read on a crimson banner,\r\nflouting the crimson clouds, in the van of a riotous red-bonneted mob,\r\nracing by us as we came from the glen. Many more followed: black, or\r\nblood-stained:—.\r\n\r\n“Mardi is man’s!”\r\n\r\n“Down with landholders!”\r\n\r\n“Our turn now!”\r\n\r\n“Up rights! Down wrongs!”\r\n\r\n“Bread! Bread!”\r\n\r\n“Take the tide, ere it turns!”\r\n\r\nWaving their banners, and flourishing aloft clubs, hammers, and\r\nsickles, with fierce yells the crowd ran on toward the palace of Bello.\r\nForemost, and inciting the rest by mad outcries and gestures, were six\r\nmasks; “This way! This way!” they cried,—“by the wood; by the dark\r\nwood!” Whereupon all darted into the groves; when of a sudden, the\r\nmasks leaped forward, clearing a long covered trench, into which fell\r\nmany of those they led. But on raced the masks; and gaining Bello’s\r\npalace, and raising the alarm, there sallied from thence a woodland of\r\nspears, which charged upon the disordered ranks in the grove. A crash\r\nas of icicles against icebergs round Zembla, and down went the hammers\r\nand sickles. The host fled, hotly pursued. Meanwhile brave heralds from\r\nBello advanced, and with chaplets crowned the six masks.—“Welcome,\r\nheroes! worthy and valiant!” they cried. “Thus our lord Bello rewards\r\nall those, who to do him a service, for hire betray their kith and\r\ntheir kin.”\r\n\r\nStill pursuing our quest, wide we wandered through all the sun and\r\nshade of Dominora; but nowhere was Yillah found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\nThey Behold King Bello’s State Canoe\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last, bidding adieu to King Bello; and in the midst of the lowing of\r\noxen, breaking away from his many hospitalities, we departed for the\r\nbeach. But ere embarking, we paused to gaze at an object, which long\r\nfixed our attention.\r\n\r\nNow, as all bold cavaliers have ever delighted in special chargers,\r\ngayly caparisoned, whereon upon grand occasions to sally forth upon the\r\nplains: even so have maritime potentates ever prided themselves upon\r\nsome holiday galley, splendidly equipped, wherein to sail over the sea.\r\n\r\nWhen of old, glory-seeking Jason, attended by his promising young\r\nlieutenants, Castor and Pollux, embarked on that hardy adventure to\r\nColchis, the brave planks of the good ship Argos he trod, its model a\r\nswan to behold.\r\n\r\nAnd when Trojan Aeneas wandered West, and discovered the pleasant land\r\nof Latium, it was in the fine craft Bis Taurus that he sailed: its\r\nstern gloriously emblazoned, its prow a leveled spear.\r\n\r\nAnd to the sound of sackbut and psaltery, gliding down the Nile, in the\r\npleasant shade of its pyramids to welcome mad Mark, Cleopatra was\r\nthroned on the cedar quarter-deck of a glorious gondola, silk and satin\r\nhung; its silver plated oars, musical as flutes. So, too, Queen Bess\r\nwas wont to disport on old Thames.\r\n\r\nAnd tough Torf-Egill, the Danish Sea-king, reckoned in his stud, a\r\nslender yacht; its masts young Zetland firs; its prow a seal, dog-like\r\nholding a sword-fish blade. He called it the Grayhound, so swift was\r\nits keel; the Sea-hawk, so blood-stained its beak.\r\n\r\nAnd groping down his palace stairs, the blind old Doge Dandolo, oft\r\nembarked in his gilded barge, like the lord mayor setting forth in\r\ncivic state from Guildhall in his chariot. But from another sort of\r\nprow leaped Dandolo, when at Constantinople, he foremost sprang ashore,\r\nand with a right arm ninety years old, planted the standard of St. Mark\r\nfull among the long chin-pennons of the long-bearded Turks.\r\n\r\nAnd Kumbo Sama, Emperor of Japan, had a dragon-beaked junk, a floating\r\nJuggernaut, wherein he burnt incense to the sea-gods.\r\n\r\nAnd Kannakoko, King of New Zealand; and the first Tahitian Pomaree; and\r\nthe Pelew potentate, each possessed long state canoes; sea-snakes, all;\r\ncarved over like Chinese card-cases, and manned with such scores of\r\nwarriors, that dipping their paddles in the sea, they made a commotion\r\nlike shoals of herring.\r\n\r\nWhat wonder then, that Bello of the Hump, the old sea-king of Mardi,\r\nshould sport a brave ocean-chariot?\r\n\r\nIn a broad arbor by the water-side, it was housed like Alp Arsian’s\r\nwar-horse, or the charger Caligula deified; upon its stern a wilderness\r\nof sculpture:—shell-work, medal-lions, masques, griffins, gulls, ogres,\r\nfinned-lions, winged walruses; all manner of sea-cavalry, crusading\r\ncentaurs, crocodiles, and sharks; and mermen, and mermaids, and Neptune\r\nonly knows all.\r\n\r\nAnd in this craft, Doge-like, yearly did King Bello stand up and wed\r\nwith the Lagoon. But the custom originated not in the manner of the\r\nDoge’s, which was as follows; so, at least, saith Ghibelli, who tells\r\nall about it:—\r\n\r\nWhen, in a stout sea-fight, Ziani defeated Barbarossa’s son Otho,\r\nsending his feluccas all flying, like frightened water-fowl from a\r\nlake, then did his Holiness, the Pope, present unto him a ring; saying,\r\n“Take this, oh Ziani, and with it, the sea for thy bride; and every\r\nyear wed her again.”\r\n\r\nSo the Doge’s tradition; thus Bello’s:—\r\n\r\nAges ago, Dominora was circled by a reef, which expanding in proportion\r\nto the extension of the isle’s naval dominion, in due time embraced the\r\nentire lagoon; and this marriage ring zoned all the world.\r\n\r\nBut if the sea was King Bello’s bride, an Adriatic Tartar he wedded;\r\nwho, in her mad gales of passions, often boxed about his canoes, and\r\nled his navies a very boisterous life indeed.\r\n\r\nAnd hostile prognosticators opined, that ere long she would desert her\r\nold lord, and marry again. Already, they held, she had made advances in\r\nthe direction of Vivenza.\r\n\r\nBut truly, should she abandon old Bello, he would straight-way after\r\nher with all his fleets; and never rest till his queen was regained.\r\n\r\nNow, old sea-king! look well to thy barge of state: for, peradventure,\r\nthe dry-rot may be eating into its keel; and the wood-worms exploring\r\ninto its spars.\r\n\r\nWithout heedful tending, any craft will decay; yet, for ever may its\r\nfirst, fine model be preserved, though its prow be renewed every\r\nspring, like the horns of the deer, if, in repairing, plank be put for\r\nplank, rib for rib, in exactest similitude. Even so, then, oh Bello! do\r\nthou with thy barge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\nWherein Babbalanja Bows Thrice\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning’s twilight found us once more afloat; and yielding to\r\nthat almost sullen feeling, but too apt to prevail with some mortals at\r\nthat hour, all but Media long remained silent.\r\n\r\nBut now, a bright mustering is seen among the myriad white Tartar tents\r\nin the Orient; like lines of spears defiling upon some upland plain,\r\nthe sunbeams thwart the sky. And see! amid the blaze of banners, and\r\nthe pawings of ten thousand thousand golden hoofs, day’s mounted\r\nSultan, Xerxes-like, moves on: the Dawn his standard, East and West his\r\ncymbals.\r\n\r\n“Oh, morning life!” cried Yoomy, with a Persian air; “would that all\r\ntime were a sunrise, and all life a youth.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! but these striplings whimper of youth,” said Mohi, caressing his\r\nbraids, “as if they wore this beard.”\r\n\r\n“But natural, old man,” said Babbalanja. “We Mardians never seem young\r\nto ourselves; childhood is to youth what manhood is to age:—something\r\nto be looked back upon, with sorrow that it is past. But childhood\r\nreeks of no future, and knows no past; hence, its present passes in a\r\nvapor.”\r\n\r\n“Mohi, how’s your appetite this morning?” said Media.\r\n\r\n“Thus, thus, ye gods,” sighed Yoomy, “is feeling ever scouted. Yet,\r\nwhat might seem feeling in me, I can not express.”\r\n\r\n“A good commentary on old Bardianna, Yoomy,” said Babbalanja, “who\r\nsomewhere says, that no Mardian can out with his heart, for his\r\nunyielding ribs are in the way. And indeed, pride, or something akin\r\nthereto, often holds check on sentiment. My lord, there are those who\r\nlike not to be detected in the possession of a heart.”\r\n\r\n“Very true, Babbalanja; and I suppose that pride was at the bottom of\r\nyour old Ponderer’s heartless, unsentimental, bald-pated style.”\r\n\r\n“Craving pardon, my lord is deceived. Bardianna was not at all proud;\r\nthough he had a queer way of showing the absence of pride. In his\r\nessay, entitled,—“On the Tendency to curl in Upper Lips,” he thus\r\ndiscourses. “We hear much of pride and its sinfulness in this Mardi\r\nwherein we dwell: whereas, I glory in being brimmed with it;—my sort of\r\npride. In the presence of kings, lords, palm-trees, and all those who\r\ndeem themselves taller than myself, I stand stiff as a pike, and will\r\nabate not one vertebra of my stature. But accounting no Mardian my\r\nsuperior, I account none my inferior; hence, with the social, I am ever\r\nready to be sociable.”\r\n\r\n“An agrarian!” said Media; “no doubt he would have made the headsman\r\nthe minister of equality.”\r\n\r\n“At bottom we are already equal, my honored lord,” said Babbalanja,\r\nprofoundly bowing—“One way we all come into Mardi, and one way we\r\nwithdraw. Wanting his yams a king will starve, quick as a clown; and\r\nsmote on the hip, saith old Bardianna, he will roar as loud as the next\r\none.”\r\n\r\n“Roughly worded, that, Babbalanja.—Vee-Vee! my crown!—So; now,\r\nBabbalanja, try if you can not polish Bardianna’s style in that last\r\nsaying you father upon him.”\r\n\r\n“I will, my ever honorable lord,” said Babbalanja, salaming. “Thus\r\nwe’ll word it, then: In their merely Mardian nature, the sublimest\r\ndemi-gods are subject to infirmities; for struck by some keen shaft,\r\neven a king ofttimes dons his crown, fearful of future darts.”\r\n\r\n“Ha, ha!—well done, Babbalanja; but I bade you polish, not sharpen the\r\narrow.”\r\n\r\n“All one, my thrice honored lord;—to polish is not to blunt.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\nBabbalanja Philosophizes, And My Lord Media Passes Round The Calabashes\r\n\r\n\r\nAn interval of silence passed; when Media cried, “Out upon thee, Yoomy!\r\ncurtail that long face of thine.”\r\n\r\n“How can he, my lord,” said Mohi, “when he is thinking of furlongs?”\r\n\r\n“Fathoms you mean, Mohi; see you not he is musing over the gunwale? And\r\nnow, minstrel, a banana for thy thoughts. Come, tell me how you poets\r\nspend so many hours in meditation.”\r\n\r\n“My lord, it is because, that when we think, we think so little of\r\nourselves.”\r\n\r\n“I thought as much,” said Mohi, “for no sooner do I undertake to be\r\nsociable with myself, than I am straightway forced to beat a retreat.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, old man,” said Babbalanja, “many of us Mardians are but sorry\r\nhosts to ourselves. Some hearts are hermits.”\r\n\r\n“If not of yourself, then, Yoomy, of whom else do you think?” asked\r\nMedia.\r\n\r\n“My lord, I seldom think,” said Yoomy, “I but give ear to the voices in\r\nmy calm.”\r\n\r\n“Did Babbalanja speak?” said Media. “But no more of your reveries;” and\r\nso saying Media gradually sunk into a reverie himself.\r\n\r\nThe rest did likewise; and soon, with eyes enchanted, all reclined:\r\ngazing at each other, witless of what we did.\r\n\r\nIt was Media who broke the spell; calling for Vee-Vee our page, his\r\ncalabashes and cups, and nectarines for all.\r\n\r\nEyeing his goblet, Media at length threw himself back, and said:\r\n“Babbalanja, not ten minutes since, we were all absent-minded; now, how\r\nwould you like to step out of your body, in reality; and, as a spirit,\r\nhaunt some shadowy grove?”\r\n\r\n“But our lungs are not wholly superfluous, my lord,” said Babbalanja,\r\nspeaking loud.\r\n\r\n“No, nor our lips,” said Mohi, smacking his over his wine.\r\n\r\n“But could you really be disembodied here in Mardi, Babbalanja, how\r\nwould you fancy it?” said Media.\r\n\r\n“My lord,” said Babbalanja, speaking through half of a nectarine,\r\n“defer putting that question, I beseech, till after my appetite is\r\nsatisfied; for, trust me, no hungry mortal would forfeit his palate, to\r\nbe resolved into the impalpable.”\r\n\r\n“Yet pure spirits we must all become at last, Babbalanja,” said Yoomy,\r\n“even the most ignoble.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, so they say, Yoomy; but if all boors be the immortal sires of\r\nendless dynasties of immortals, how little do our pious patricians bear\r\nin mind their magnificent destiny, when hourly they scorn their\r\ncompanionship. And if here in Mardi they can not abide an equality with\r\nplebeians, even at the altar; how shall they endure them, side by side,\r\nthroughout eternity? But since the prophet Alma asserts, that Paradise\r\nis almost entirely made up of the poor and despised, no wonder that\r\nmany aristocrats of our isles pursue a career, which, according to some\r\ntheologies, must forever preserve the social distinctions so sedulously\r\nmaintained in Mardi. And though some say, that at death every thing\r\nearthy is removed from the spirit, so that clowns and lords both stand\r\non a footing; yet, according to the popular legends, it has ever been\r\nobserved of the ghosts of boors when revisiting Mardi, that invariably\r\nthey rise in their smocks. And regarding our intellectual equality\r\nhere, how unjust, my lord, that after whole years of days end nights\r\nconsecrated to the hard gaining of wisdom, the wisest Mardian of us all\r\nshould in the end find the whole sum of his attainments, at one leap\r\noutstripped by the veriest dunce, suddenly inspired by light divine.\r\nAnd though some hold, that all Mardian lore is vain, and that at death\r\nall mysteries will be revealed; yet, none the less, do they toil and\r\nponder now. Thus, their tongues have one mind, and their understanding\r\nanother.”\r\n\r\n“My lord,” said Mohi, “we have come to the lees; your pardon,\r\nBabbalanja.”\r\n\r\n“Then, Vee-Vee, another calabash! Fill up, Mohi; wash down wine with\r\nwine. Your cup, Babbalanja; any lees?”\r\n\r\n“Plenty, my lord; we philosophers come to the lees very soon.”\r\n\r\n“Flood them over, then; but cease not discoursing; thanks be to the\r\ngods, your mortal palates and tongues can both wag together; fill up, I\r\nsay, Babbalanja; you are no philosopher, if you stop at the tenth cup;\r\nendurance is the test of philosophy all Mardi over; drink, I say, and\r\nmake us wise by precept and example.—Proceed, Yoomy, you look as if you\r\nhad something to say.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks, my lord. Just now, Babbalanja, you flew from the subject;— you\r\nspoke of boors; but has not the lowliest peasant an eye that can take\r\nin the vast horizon at a sweep: mountains, vales, plains, and oceans?\r\nIs such a being nothing?”\r\n\r\n“But can that eye see itself, Yoomy?” said Babbalanja, winking. “Taken\r\nout of its socket, will it see at all? Its connection with the body\r\nimparts to it its virtue.”\r\n\r\n“He questions every thing,” cried Mohi. “Philosopher, have you a head?”\r\n\r\n“I have,” said Babbalanja, feeling for it; “I am finished off at the\r\nhelm very much as other Mardians, Mohi.”\r\n\r\n“My lord, the first yea that ever came from him.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, Mohi,” said Media, “the discourse waxes heavy. I fear me we have\r\nagain come to the lees. Ho, Vee-Vee, a fresh calabash; and with it we\r\nwill change the subject. Now, Babbalanja, I have this cup to drink, and\r\nthen a question to propound. Ah, Mohi, rare old wine this; it smacks of\r\nthe cork. But attention, Philosopher. Supposing you had a wife—which,\r\nby the way, you have not—would you deem it sensible in her to imagine\r\nyou no more, because you happened to stroll out of her sight?”\r\n\r\n“However that might be,” murmured Yoomy, “young Nina bewailed herself a\r\nwidow, whenever Arhinoo, her lord, was absent from her side.”\r\n\r\n“My lord Media,” said Babbalanja, “During my absence, my wife would\r\nhave more reason to conclude that I was not living, than that I was. To\r\nthe former supposition, every thing tangible around her would tend; to\r\nthe latter, nothing but her own fond fancies. It is this imagination of\r\nours, my lord, that is at the bottom of these things. When I am in one\r\nplace, there exists no other. Yet am I but too apt to fancy the\r\nreverse. Nevertheless, when I am in Odo, talk not to me of Ohonoo. To\r\nme it is not, except when I am there. If it be, prove it. To prove it,\r\nyou carry me thither but you only prove, that to its substantive\r\nexistence, as cognizant to me, my presence is indispensable. I say\r\nthat, to me, all Mardi exists by virtue of my sovereign pleasure; and\r\nwhen I die, the universe will perish with me.”\r\n\r\n“Come you of a long-lived race,” said Mohi, “one free from apoplexies?\r\nI have many little things to accomplish yet, and would not be left in\r\nthe lurch.”\r\n\r\n“Heed him not, Babbalanja,” said Media. “Dip your beak again, my eagle,\r\nand soar.”\r\n\r\n“Let us be eagles, then, indeed, my lord: eagle-like, let us look at\r\nthis red wine without blinking; let us grow solemn, not boisterous,\r\nwith good cheer.”\r\n\r\nThen, lifting his cup, “My lord, serenely do I pity all who are stirred\r\none jot from their centers by ever so much drinking of this fluid. Ply\r\nhim hard as you will, through the live-long polar night, a wise man can\r\nnot be made drunk. Though, toward sunrise, his body may reel, it will\r\nreel round its center; and though he make many tacks in going home, he\r\nreaches it at last; while scores of over-plied fools are foundering by\r\nthe way. My lord, when wild with much thought, ’tis to wine I fly, to\r\nsober me; its magic fumes breathe over me like the Indian summer, which\r\nsteeps all nature in repose. To me, wine is no vulgar fire, no fosterer\r\nof base passions; my heart, ever open, is opened still wider; and\r\nglorious visions are born in my brain; it is then that I have all Mardi\r\nunder my feet, and the constellations of the firmament in my soul.”\r\n\r\n“Superb!” cried Yoomy.\r\n\r\n“Pooh, pooh!” said Mohi, “who does not see stars at such times? I see\r\nthe Great Bear now, and the little one, its cub; and Andromeda, and\r\nPerseus’ chain-armor, and Cassiopea in her golden chair, and the\r\nbright, scaly Dragon, and the glittering Lyre, and all the jewels in\r\nOrion’s sword-hilt.”\r\n\r\n“Ay,” cried Media, “the study of astronomy is wonderfully facilitated\r\nby wine. Fill up, old Ptolemy, and tell us should you discover a new\r\nplanet. Methinks this fluid needs stirring. Ho, Vee-Vee, my scepter! be\r\nwe sociable. But come, Babbalanja, my gold-headed aquila, return to\r\nyour theme;—the imagination, if you please.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, my lord, I was about to say, that the imagination is the\r\nVoli-Donzini; or, to speak plainer, the unical, rudimental, and all-\r\ncomprehending abstracted essence of the infinite remoteness of things.\r\nWithout it, we were grass-hoppers.”\r\n\r\n“And with it, you mortals are little else; do you not chirp all over,\r\nMohi? By my demi-god soul, were I not what I am, this wine would almost\r\nget the better of me.”\r\n\r\n“Without it—” continued Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n“Without what?” demanded Media, starting to his feet. “This wine?\r\nTraitor, I’ll stand by this to the last gasp, you are inebriated,\r\nBabbalanja.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps so, my lord; but I was treating of the imagination, may it\r\nplease you.”\r\n\r\n“My lord,” added Mohi, “of the unical, and rudimental fundament of\r\nthings, you remember.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! there’s none of them sober; proceed, proceed, Azzageddi!”\r\n\r\n“My lord waves his hand like a banner,” murmured Yoomy.\r\n\r\n“Without imagination, I say, an armless man, born, blind, could not be\r\nmade to believe, that he had a head of hair, since he could neither see\r\nit, nor feel it, nor has hair any feeling of itself.”\r\n\r\n“Methinks though,” said Mohi, “if the cripple had a Tartar for a wife,\r\nhe would not remain skeptical long.”\r\n\r\n“You all fly off at tangents,” cried Media, “but no wonder: your mortal\r\nbrains can not endure much quaffing. Return to your subject,\r\nBabbalanja. Assume now, Babbalanja,—assume, my dear prince—assume it,\r\nassume it, I say!—Why don’t you?”\r\n\r\n“I am willing to assume any thing you please, my lord: what is it?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! yes!—Assume that—that upon returning home, you should find your\r\nwife had newly wedded, under the—the—the metaphysical presumption, that\r\nbeing no longer visible, you—_you_ Azzageddi, had departed this life;\r\nin other words, out of sight, out of mind; what then, my dear prince?”\r\n\r\n“Why then, my lord, I would demolish my rival in a trice.”\r\n\r\n“Would you?—then—then so much for your metaphysics, Bab—Babbalanja.”\r\n\r\nBabbalanja rose to his feet, muttering to himself—“Is this assumed, or\r\nreal?—Can a demi-god be mastered by wine? Yet, the old mythologies make\r\nbacchanals of the gods. But he was wondrous keen! He felled me, ere he\r\nfell himself.”\r\n\r\n“Yoomy, my lord Media is in a very merry mood to-day,” whispered Mohi,\r\n“but his counterfeit was not well done. No, no, a bacchanal is not used\r\nto be so logical in his cups.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\nThey Sail Round An Island Without Landing; And Talk Round A Subject\r\nWithout Getting At It\r\n\r\n\r\nPurposing a visit to Kaleedoni, a country integrally united to\r\nDominora, our course now lay northward along the western white cliffs\r\nof the isle. But finding the wind ahead, and the current too strong for\r\nour paddlers, we were fain to forego our destination; Babbalanja\r\nobserving, that since in Dominora we had not found Yillah, then in\r\nKaleedoni the maiden could not be lurking.\r\n\r\nAnd now, some conversation ensued concerning the country we were\r\nprevented from visiting. Our chronicler narrated many fine things of\r\nits people; extolling their bravery in war, their amiability in peace,\r\ntheir devotion in religion, their penetration in philosophy, their\r\nsimplicity and sweetness in song, their loving-kindness and frugality\r\nin all things domestic:—running over a long catalogue of heroes,\r\nmeta-physicians, bards, and good men.\r\n\r\nBut as all virtues are convertible into vices, so in some cases did the\r\nbest traits of these people degenerate. Their frugality too often\r\nbecame parsimony; their devotion grim bigotry; and all this in a\r\ngreater degree perhaps than could be predicated of the more immediate\r\nsubjects of King Bello.\r\n\r\nIn Kaleedoni was much to awaken the fervor of its bards. Upland and\r\nlowland were full of the picturesque; and many unsung lyrics yet lurked\r\nin her glens. Among her blue, heathy hills, lingered many tribes, who\r\nin their wild and tattooed attire, still preserved the garb of the\r\nmightiest nation of old times. They bared the knee, in token that it\r\nwas honorable as the face, since it had never been bent.\r\n\r\nWhile Braid-Beard was recounting these things, the currents were\r\nsweeping us over a strait, toward a deep green island, bewitching to\r\nbehold.\r\n\r\nNot greener that midmost terrace of the Andes, which under a torrid\r\nmeridian steeps fair Quito in the dews of a perpetual spring;—not\r\ngreener the nine thousand feet of Pirohitee’s tall peak, which, rising\r\nfrom out the warm bosom of Tahiti, carries all summer with it into the\r\nclouds;—nay, not greener the famed gardens of Cyrus,—than the vernal\r\nlawn, the knoll, the dale of beautiful Verdanna.\r\n\r\n“Alas, sweet isle! Thy desolation is overrun with vines,” sighed Yoomy,\r\ngazing.\r\n\r\n“Land of caitiff curs!” cried Media.\r\n\r\n“Isle, whose future is in its past. Hearth-stone, from which its\r\nchildren run,” said Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n“I can not read thy chronicles for blood, Verdanna,” murmured Mohi.\r\n\r\nGliding near, we would have landed, but the rolling surf forbade. Then\r\nthrice we circumnavigated the isle for a smooth, clear beach; but it\r\nwas not found.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile all still conversed.\r\n\r\n“My lord,” said Yoomy, “while we tarried with King Bello, I heard much\r\nof the feud between Dominora and this unhappy shore. Yet is not\r\nVerdanna as a child of King Bello’s?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, minstrel, a step-child,” said Mohi.\r\n\r\n“By way of enlarging his family circle,” said Babbalanja, “an old lion\r\nonce introduced a deserted young stag to his den; but the stag never\r\nbecame domesticated, and would still charge upon his foster-brothers.\r\n—Verdanna is not of the flesh and blood of Dominora, whence, in good\r\npart, these dissensions.”\r\n\r\n“But Babbalanja, is there no way of reconciling these foes?”\r\n\r\n“But one way, Yoomy:—By filling up this strait with dry land; for,\r\ndivided by water, we Mardians must ever remain more or less divided at\r\nheart. Though Kaleedoni was united to Dominora long previous to the\r\nunion of Verdanna, yet Kaleedoni occasions Bello no disquiet; for,\r\ngeographically one, the two populations insensibly blend at the point\r\nof junction. No hostile strait flows between the arms, that to embrace\r\nmust touch.”\r\n\r\n“But, Babbalanja,” said Yoomy, “what asks Verdanna of Dominora, that\r\nVerdanna so clamors at the denial?”\r\n\r\n“They are arrant cannibals, Yoomy,” said Media, “and desire the\r\nprivilege of eating each other up.”\r\n\r\n“King Bello’s idea,” said Babbalanja; “but, in these things, my lord,\r\nyou demi-gods are ever unanimous. But, whatever be Verdanna’s demands,\r\nBello persists in rejecting them.”\r\n\r\n“Why not grant every thing she asks, even to renouncing all claim upon\r\nthe isle,” said Mohi; “for thus, Bello would rid himself of many\r\nperplexities.”\r\n\r\n“And think you, old man,” said Media, “that, bane or blessing, Bello\r\nwill yield his birthright? Will a tri-crowned king resign his triple\r\ndiadem? And even did Bello what you propose he would only breed still\r\ngreater perplexities. For if granted, full soon would Verdanna be glad\r\nto surrender many things she demands. And all she now asks, she has had\r\nin times past; but without turning it to advantage:—and is she wiser\r\nnow?”\r\n\r\n“Does she not demand her harvests, my lord?” said Yoomy, “and has not\r\nthe reaper a right to his sheaf?”\r\n\r\n“Cant! cant! Yoomy. If you reap for me, the sheaf is mine.”\r\n\r\n“But if the reaper reaps on his own harvest-field, whose then the\r\nsheaf, my lord?” said Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n“His for whom he reaps—his lord’s!”\r\n\r\n“Then let the reaper go with sickle and with sword,” said Yoomy, “with\r\none hand, cut down the bearded grain; and with the other, smite his\r\nbearded lords.”\r\n\r\n“Thou growest fierce, in thy lyric moods, my warlike dove,” said\r\n‘Media, blandly. “But for thee, philosopher, know thou, that Verdanna’s\r\nmen are of blood and brain inferior to Bello’s native race; and the\r\nbetter Mardian must ever rule.”\r\n\r\n“Verdanna inferior to Dominora, my lord!—Has she produced no bards, no\r\norators, no wits, no patriots? Mohi, unroll thy chronicles! Tell me, if\r\nVerdanna may not claim full many a star along King Bello’s tattooed arm\r\nof Fame?\r\n\r\n“Even so,” said Mohi. “Many chapters bear you out.”\r\n\r\n“But my lord,” said Babbalanja, “as truth, omnipresent, lurks in all\r\nthings, even in lies: so, does some germ of it lurk in the calumnies\r\nheaped on the people of this land. For though they justly boast of many\r\nlustrous names, these jewels gem no splendid robe. And though like a\r\nbower of grapes, Verdanna is full of gushing juices, spouting out in\r\nbright sallies of wit, yet not all her grapes make wine; and here and\r\nthere, hang goodly clusters mildewed; or half devoured by worms, bred\r\nin their own tendrils.”\r\n\r\n“Drop, drop your grapes and metaphors!” cried Media. “Bring forth your\r\nthoughts like men; let them come naked into Mardi.—What do you mean,\r\nBabbalanja?”\r\n\r\n“This, my lord, Verdanna’s worst evils are her own, not of another’s\r\ngiving. Her own hand is her own undoer. She stabs herself with bigotry,\r\nsuperstition, divided councils, domestic feuds, ignorance, temerity;\r\nshe wills, but does not; her East is one black storm-cloud, that never\r\nbursts; her utmost fight is a defiance; she showers reproaches, where\r\nshe should rain down blows. She stands a mastiff baying at the moon.”\r\n\r\n“Tropes on tropes!” said. Media. “Let me tell the tale,—straight-\r\nforward like a line. Verdanna is a lunatic—”\r\n\r\n“A trope! my lord,” cried Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n“My tropes are not tropes,” said Media, “but yours are.—Verdanna is a\r\nlunatic, that after vainly striving to cut another’s throat, grimaces\r\nbefore a standing pool and threatens to cut his own. And is such a\r\nmadman to be intrusted with himself? No; let another govern him, who is\r\nungovernable to himself Ay, and tight hold the rein; and curb, and rasp\r\nthe bit. Do I exaggerate?—Mohi, tell me, if, save one lucid interval,\r\nVerdanna, while independent of Dominora, ever discreetly conducted her\r\naffairs? Was she not always full of fights and factions? And what first\r\nbrought her under the sway of Bello’s scepter? Did not her own Chief\r\nDermoddi fly to Bello’s ancestor for protection against his own\r\nseditious subjects? And thereby did not her own king unking himself?\r\nWhat wonder, then, and where the wrong, if Henro, Bello’s conquering\r\nsire, seized the diadem?”\r\n\r\n“What my lord cites is true,” said Mohi, “but cite no more, I pray;\r\nlest, you harm your cause.”\r\n\r\n“Yet for all this, Babbalanja,” said Media, “Bello but holds lunatic\r\nVerdanna’s lands in trust.”\r\n\r\n“And may the guardian of an estate also hold custody of the ward, my\r\nlord?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, if he can. What _can_ be done, may be: that’s the Greed of demi-\r\ngods.”\r\n\r\n“Alas, alas!” cried Yoomy, “why war with words over this poor,\r\nsuffering land. See! for all her bloom, her people starve; perish her\r\nyams, ere taken from the soil; the blight of heaven seems upon them.”\r\n\r\n“Not so,” said Media. “Heaven sends no blights. Verdanna will not\r\nlearn. And if from one season’s rottenss, rottenness they sow again,\r\nrottenness must they reap. But Yoomy, you seem earnest in this\r\nmatter;—come: on all hands it is granted that evils exist in Verdanna;\r\nnow sweet Sympathizer, what must the royal Bello do to mend them?”\r\n\r\n“I am no sage,” said Yoomy, “what would my lord Media do?”\r\n\r\n“What would _you_ do, Babbalanja,” said Media.\r\n\r\n“Mohi, what you?” asked the philosopher.\r\n\r\n“And what would the company do?” added Mohi.\r\n\r\n“Now, though these evils pose us all,” said Babbalanja, “there lately\r\ndied in Verdanna, one, who set about curing them in a humane and\r\npeaceable way, waving war and bloodshed. That man was Konno. Under a\r\nhuge caldron, he kept a roaring fire.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Azzageddi, how could that answer his purpose?” asked Media.\r\n\r\n“Nothing better, my lord. His fire boiled his bread-fruit; and so\r\nconvinced were his countrymen, that he was well employed, that they\r\nalmost stripped their scanty orchards to fill his caldron.”\r\n\r\n“Konno was a knave,” said Mohi.\r\n\r\n“Your pardon, old man, but that is only known to his ghost, not to us.\r\nAt any rate he was a great man; for even assuming he cajoled his\r\ncountry, no common man could have done it.”\r\n\r\n“Babbalanja,” said Mohi, “my lord has been pleased to pronounce\r\nVerdanna crazy; now, may not her craziness arise from the irritating,\r\ntantalizing practices of Dominora?”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless, Braid-Beard, many of the extravagances of Verdanna, are in\r\ngood part to be ascribed to the cause you mention; but, to be\r\nimpartial, none the less does Verdanna essay to taunt and provoke\r\nDominora; yet not with the like result. Perceive you, Braid-Beard, that\r\nthe trade-wind blows dead across this strait from Dominora, and not\r\nfrom Verdanna? Hence, when King Bello’s men fling gibes and insults,\r\nevery missile hits; but those of Verdanna are blown back in its teeth:\r\nher enemies jeering her again and again.”\r\n\r\n“King Bello’s men are dastards for that,” cried Yoomy. “It shows\r\nneither sense, nor spirit, nor humanity,” said Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n“All wide of the mark,” cried Media. “What is to be done for Verdanna?”\r\n\r\n“What will she do for herself?” said Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n“Philosopher, you are an extraordinary sage; and since sages should be\r\nseers, reveal Verdanna’s future.”\r\n\r\n“My lord, you will ever find true prophets, prudent; nor will any\r\nprophet risk his reputation upon predicting aught concerning this land.\r\nThe isles are Oro’s. Nevertheless, he who doctors Verdanna aright, will\r\nfirst medicine King Bello; who in some things is, himself a patient,\r\nthough he would fain be a physician. However, my lord, there is a demon\r\nof a doctor in Mardi, who at last deals with these desperate cases. He\r\nemploys only pills, picked off the Conroupta Quiancensis tree.”\r\n\r\n“And what sort of a vegetable is that?” asked Mohi. “Consult the\r\nbotanists,” said Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\nThey Draw Nigh To Porpheero; Where They Behold A Terrific Eruption\r\n\r\n\r\nGliding away from Verdanna at the turn of the tide, we cleared the\r\nstrait, and gaining the more open lagoon, pointed our prows for\r\nPorpheero, from whose magnificent monarchs my lord Media promised\r\nhimself a glorious reception.\r\n\r\n“They are one and all demi-gods,” he cried, “and have the old demi-god\r\nfeeling. We have seen no great valleys like theirs:—their scepters are\r\nlong as our spears; to their sumptuous palaces, Donjalolo’s are but\r\ninns:—their banquetting halls are as vistas; no generations run\r\nparallel to theirs:—their pedigrees reach back into chaos.\r\n\r\n“Babbalanja! here you will find food for philosophy:—the whole land\r\ncheckered with nations, side by side contrasting in costume, manners,\r\nand mind. Here you will find science and sages; manuscripts in miles;\r\nbards singing in choirs.\r\n\r\n“Mohi! here you will flag over your page; in Porpheero the ages have\r\nhived all their treasures: like a pyramid, the past shadows over the\r\nland.\r\n\r\n“Yoomy! here you will find stuff for your songs:—blue rivers flowing\r\nthrough forest arches, and vineyards; velvet meads, soft as ottomans:\r\nbright maidens braiding the golden locks of the harvest; and a\r\nbackground of mountains, that seem the end of the world. Or if nature\r\nwill not content you, then turn to the landscapes of art. See! mosaic\r\nwalls, tattooed like our faces; paintings, vast as horizons; and into\r\nwhich, you feel you could rush: See! statues to which you could off\r\nturban; cities of columns standing thick as mankind; and firmanent\r\ndomes forever shedding their sunsets of gilding: See! spire behind\r\nspire, as if the land were the ocean, and all Bello’s great navy were\r\nriding at anchor.\r\n\r\n“Noble Taji! you seek for your Yillah;—give over despair! Porpheero’s\r\nsuch a scene of enchantment, that there, the lost maiden must lurk.”\r\n\r\n“A glorious picture!” cried Babbalanja, but turn the medal, my lord;—\r\nwhat says the reverse?”\r\n\r\n“Cynic! have done.—But bravo! we’ll ere long be in Franko, the\r\ngoodliest vale of them all; how I long to take her old king by the\r\nhand!”\r\n\r\nThe sun was now setting behind us, lighting up the white cliffs of\r\nDominora, and the green capes of Verdanna; while in deep shade lay\r\nbefore us the long winding shores of Porpheero.\r\n\r\nIt was a sunset serene.\r\n\r\n“How the winds lowly warble in the dying day’s ear,” murmured Yoomy.\r\n\r\n“A mild, bright night, we’ll have,” said Media.\r\n\r\n“See you not those clouds over Franko, my lord,” said Mohi, shaking his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n“Ah, aged and weather-wise as ever, sir chronicler;—I predict a fair\r\nnight, and many to follow.”\r\n\r\n“Patience needs no prophet,” said Babbalanja. “The night, is at hand.”\r\n\r\nHitherto the lagoon had been smooth: but anon, it grew black, and\r\nstirred; and out of the thick darkness came clamorous sounds. Soon,\r\nthere shot into the air a vivid meteor, which bursting at the zenith,\r\nradiated down the firmament in fiery showers, leaving treble darkness\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nThen as all held their breath, from Franko there spouted an eruption,\r\nwhich seemed to plant all Mardi in the foreground.\r\n\r\nAs when Vesuvius lights her torch, and in the blaze, the storm-swept\r\nsurges in Naples’ bay rear and plunge toward it; so now, showed\r\nFranko’s multitudes, as they stormed the summit where their monarch’s\r\npalace blazed, fast by the burning mountain.\r\n\r\n“By my eternal throne!” cried Media, starting, “the old volcano has\r\nburst forth again!”\r\n\r\n“But a new vent, my lord,” said Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n“More fierce this, than the eruption which happened in my youth,” said\r\nMohi—“methinks that Franko’s end has come.”\r\n\r\n“You look pale, my lord,” said Babbalanja, “while all other faces\r\nglow;—Yoomy, doff that halo in the presence of a king.”\r\n\r\nOver the waters came a rumbling sound, mixed with the din of warfare,\r\nand thwarted by showers of embers that fell not, for the whirling\r\nblasts.\r\n\r\n“Off shore! off shore!” cried Media; and with all haste we gained a\r\nplace of safety.\r\n\r\nDown the valley now poured Rhines and Rhones of lava, a fire-freshet,\r\nflooding the forests from their fastnesses, and leaping with them into\r\nthe seething sea.\r\n\r\nThe shore was lined with multitudes pushing off wildly in canoes.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the fiery storm from Franko, kindled new flames in the\r\ndistant valleys of Porpheero; while driven over from Verdanna came\r\nfrantic shouts, and direful jubilees. Upon Dominora a baleful glare was\r\nresting.\r\n\r\n“Thrice cursed flames!” cried Media. “Is Mardi to be one conflagration?\r\nHow it crackles, forks, and roars!—Is this our funeral pyre?”\r\n\r\n“Recline, recline, my lord,” said Babbalanja. “Fierce flames are ever\r\nbrief—a song, sweet Yoomy! Your pipe, old Mohi! Greater fires than this\r\nhave ere now blazed in Mardi. Let us be calm;—the isles were made to\r\nburn;—Braid-Beard! hereafter, in some quiet cell, of this whole scene\r\nyou will but make one chapter;—come, digest it now.”\r\n\r\n“My face is scorched,” cried Media.\r\n\r\n“The last, last day!” cried Mohi.\r\n\r\n“Not so, old man,” said Babbalanja, “when that day dawns, ’twill dawn\r\nserene. Be calm, be calm, my potent lord.”\r\n\r\n“Talk not of calm brows in storm-time!” cried Media fiercely. “See! how\r\nthe flames blow over upon Dominora!”\r\n\r\n“Yet the fires they kindle there are soon extinguished,” said\r\nBabbalanja. “No, no; Dominora ne’er can burn with Franko’s fires; only\r\nthose of her own kindling may consume her.”\r\n\r\n“Away! Away!” cried Media. “We may not touch Porpheero now.—Up sails!\r\nand westward be our course.”\r\n\r\nSo dead before the blast, we scudded.\r\n\r\nMorning broke, showing no sign of land.\r\n\r\n“Hard must it go with Franko’s king,” said Media, “when his people rise\r\nagainst him with the red volcanoes. Oh, for a foot to crush them! Hard,\r\ntoo, with all who rule in broad Porpheero. And may she we seek, survive\r\nthis conflagration!”\r\n\r\n“My lord,” said Babbalanja, “where’ere she hide, ne’er yet did Yillah\r\nlurk in this Porpheero; nor have we missed the maiden, noble Taji! in\r\nnot touching at its shores.”\r\n\r\n“This fire must make a desert of the land,” said Mohi; “burn up and\r\nbury all her tilth.”\r\n\r\n“Yet, Mohi, vineyards flourish over buried villages,” murmured Yoomy.\r\n\r\n“True, minstrel,” said Babbalanja, “and prairies are purified by fire.\r\nAshes breed loam. Nor can any skill make the same surface forever\r\nfruitful. In all times past, things have been overlaid; and though the\r\nfirst fruits of the marl are wild and poisonous, the palms at last\r\nspring forth; and once again the tribes repose in shade. My lord, if\r\ncalms breed storms, so storms calms; and all this dire commotion must\r\neventuate in peace. It may be, that Perpheero’s future has been cheaply\r\nwon.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\nWherein King Media Celebrates The Glories Of Autumn, The Minstrel, The\r\nPromise Of Spring\r\n\r\n\r\n“Ho, now!” cried Media, “across the wide waters, for that New Mardi,\r\nVivenza! Let us indeed see, whether she who eludes us elsewhere, he at\r\nlast found in Vivenza’s vales.”\r\n\r\n“There or nowhere, noble Taji,” said Yoomy.\r\n\r\n“Be not too sanguine, gentle Yoomy,” said Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n“Does Yillah choose rather to bower in the wild wilderness of Vivenza,\r\nthan in the old vineyards of Porpheero?” said Braid-Beard.\r\n\r\nSang Yoomy:—\r\nHer bower is not of the vine,\r\nBut the wild, wild eglantine!\r\nNot climbing a moldering arch,\r\nBut upheld by the fir-green larch.\r\n    Old ruins she flies:\r\n    To new valleys she hies:—\r\n    Not the hoar, moss-wood,\r\n    Ivied trees each a rood—\r\n    Not in Maramma she dwells,\r\n    Hollow with hermit cells.\r\n\r\n        ’Tis a new, new isle!\r\n        An infant’s its smile,\r\n            Soft-rocked by the sea.\r\n        Its bloom all in bud;\r\n        No tide at its flood,\r\n            In that fresh-born sea!\r\n\r\nSpring! Spring! where she dwells,\r\nIn her sycamore dells,\r\nWhere Mardi is young and new:\r\nIts verdure all eyes with dew.\r\n\r\nThere, there! in the bright, balmy morns,\r\nThe young deer sprout their horns,\r\nDeep-tangled in new-branching groves,\r\nWhere the Red-Rover Robin roves,—\r\n\r\n            Stooping his crest,\r\n            To his molting breast—\r\n        Rekindling the flambeau there!\r\n    Spring! Spring! where she dwells,\r\n    In her sycamore dells:—\r\n    Where, fulfilling their fates,\r\n    All creatures seek mates—\r\n        The thrush, the doe, and the hare!\r\n\r\n\r\n“Thou art most musical, sweet Yoomy,” said Media. “concerning this\r\nspring-land Vivenza. But are not the old autumnal valleys of Porpheero\r\nmore glorious than those of vernal Vivenza? Vivenza shows no trophies\r\nof the summer time, but Dominora’s full-blown rose hangs blushing on\r\nher garden walls; her autumn groves are glory-dyed.”\r\n\r\n“My lord, autumn soon merges in winter, but the spring has all the\r\nseasons before. The full-blown rose is nearer withering than the bud.\r\nThe faint morn is a blossom: the crimson sunset the flower.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\nIn Which Azzageddi Seems To Use Babbalanja For A Mouth-Piece\r\n\r\n\r\nPorpheero far astern, the spirits of the company rose. Once again, old\r\nMohi serenely unbraided, and rebraided his beard; and sitting Turk-wise\r\non his mat, my lord Media smoking his gonfalon, diverted himself with\r\nthe wild songs of Yoomy, the wild chronicles of Mohi, or the still\r\nwilder speculations of Babbalanja; now and then, as from pitcher to\r\npitcher, pouring royal old wine down his soul.\r\n\r\nAmong other things, Media, who at times turned over Babbalanja for an\r\nencyclopaedia, however unreliable, demanded information upon the\r\nsubject of neap tides and their alleged slavish vassalage to the moon.\r\n\r\nWhen true to his cyclopaediatic nature, Babbalanja quoted from a still\r\nolder and better authority than himself; in brief, from no other than\r\neternal Bardianna. It seems that that worthy essayist had discussed the\r\nwhole matter in a chapter thus headed: “On Seeing into Mysteries\r\nthrough Mill-Stones;“ and throughout his disquisitions he evinced such\r\na profundity of research, though delivered in a style somewhat\r\nequivocal, that the company were much struck by the erudition\r\ndisplayed.\r\n\r\n“Babbalanja, that Bardianna of yours must have been a wonderful\r\nstudent,” said Media after a pause, “no doubt he consumed whole\r\nthickets of rush-lights.”\r\n\r\n“Not so, my lord.—‘Patience, patience, philosophers,’ said Bardianna;\r\n‘blow out your tapers, bolt not your dinners, take time, wisdom will be\r\nplenty soon.’”\r\n\r\n“A notable hint! Why not follow it, Babbalanja?”\r\n\r\n“Because, my lord, I have overtaken it, and passed on.”\r\n\r\n“True to your nature, Babbalanja; you stay nowhere.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, keep moving is my motto; but speaking of hard students, did my\r\nlord ever hear of Midni the ontologist and entomologist?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Then, my lord, you shall hear of him now. Midni was of opinion that\r\nday-light was vulgar; good enough for taro-planting and traveling; but\r\nwholly unadapted to the sublime ends of study. He toiled by night; from\r\nsunset to sunrise poring over the works of the old logicans. Like most\r\nphilosophers, Midni was an amiable man; but one thing invariably put\r\nhim out. He read in the woods by glow-worm light; insect in hand,\r\ntracing over his pages, line by line. But glow-worms burn not long: and\r\nin the midst of some calm intricate thought, at some imminent comma,\r\nthe insect often expired, and Midni groped for a meaning. Upon such an\r\noccasion, ‘Ho, Ho,’ he cried; ‘but for one instant of sun-light to see\r\nmy way to a period!’ But sun-light there was none; so Midni sprang to\r\nhis feet, and parchment under arm, raced about among the sloughs and\r\nbogs for another glow-worm. Often, making a rapid descent with his\r\nturban, he thought he had caged a prize; but nay. Again he tried; yet\r\nwith no better succcess. Nevertheless, at last he secured one; but\r\nhardly had he read three lines by its light, when out it went. Again\r\nand again this occurred. And thus he forever went halting and stumbling\r\nthrough his studies, and plunging through his quagmires after a glim.”\r\n\r\nAt this ridiculous tale, one of our silliest paddlers burst into\r\nuncontrollable mirth. Offended at which breach of decorum, Media\r\nsharply rebuked him.\r\n\r\nBut he protested he could not help laughing.\r\n\r\nAgain Media was about to reprimand him, when Babbalanja begged leave to\r\ninterfere.\r\n\r\n“My lord, he is not to blame. Mark how earnestly he struggles to\r\nsuppress his mirth; but he can not. It has often been the same with\r\nmyself. And many a time have I not only vainly sought to check my\r\nlaughter, but at some recitals I have both laughed and cried. But can\r\nopposite emotions be simultaneous in one being? No. I wanted to weep;\r\nbut my body wanted to smile, and between us we almost choked. My lord\r\nMedia, this man’s body laughs; not the man himself.”\r\n\r\n“But his body is his own, Babbalanja; and he should have it under\r\nbetter control.”\r\n\r\n“The common error, my lord. Our souls belong to our bodies, not our\r\nbodies to our souls. For which has the care of the other? which keeps\r\nhouse? which looks after the replenishing of the aorta and auricles,\r\nand stores away the secretions? Which toils and ticks while the other\r\nsleeps? Which is ever giving timely hints, and elderly warnings? Which\r\nis the most authoritative?—Our bodies, surely. At a hint, you must\r\nmove; at a notice to quit, you depart. Simpletons show us, that a body\r\ncan get along almost without a soul; but of a soul getting along\r\nwithout a body, we have no tangible and indisputable proof. My lord,\r\nthe wisest of us breathe involuntarily. And how many millions there are\r\nwho live from day to day by the incessant operation of subtle processes\r\nin them, of which they know nothing, and care less? Little ween they,\r\nof vessels lacteal and lymphatic, of arteries femoral and temporal; of\r\npericranium or pericardium; lymph, chyle, fibrin, albumen, iron in the\r\nblood, and pudding in the head; they live by the charity of their\r\nbodies, to which they are but butlers. I say, my lord, our bodies are\r\nour betters. A soul so simple, that it prefers evil to good, is lodged\r\nin a frame, whose minutest action is full of unsearchable wisdom.\r\nKnowing this superiority of theirs, our bodies are inclined to be\r\nwillful: our beards grow in spite of us; and as every one knows, they\r\nsometimes grow on dead men.”\r\n\r\n“You mortals are alive, then, when you are dead, Babbalanja.”\r\n\r\n“No, my lord; but our beards survive us.”\r\n\r\n“An ingenious distinction; go on, philosopher.”\r\n\r\n“Without bodies, my lord, we Mardians would be minus our strongest\r\nmotive-passions, those which, in some way or other, root under our\r\nevery action. Hence, without bodies, we must be something else than we\r\nessentially are. Wherefore, that saying imputed to Alma, and which, by\r\nhis very followers, is deemed the most hard to believe of all his\r\ninstructions, and the most at variance with all preconceived notions of\r\nimmortality, I Babbalanja, account the most reasonable of his doctrinal\r\nteachings. It is this;—that at the last day, every man shall rise in\r\nthe flesh.”\r\n\r\n“Pray, Babbalanja, talk not of resurrections to a demi-god.”\r\n\r\n“Then let me rehearse a story, my lord. You will find it in the ‘Very\r\nMerry Marvelings’ of the Improvisitor Quiddi; and a quaint book it is.\r\nFugle-fi is its finis:—fugle-fi, fugle-fo, fugle-fogle-orum!”\r\n\r\n“That wild look in his eye again,” murmured Yoomy. “Proceed,\r\nAzzageddi,” said Media.\r\n\r\n“The philosopher Grando had a sovereign contempt for his carcass. Often\r\nhe picked a quarrel with it; and always was flying out in its\r\ndisparagement. ‘Out upon you, you beggarly body! you clog, drug, drag!\r\nYou keep me from flying; I could get along better without you. Out upon\r\nyou, I say, you vile pantry, cellar, sink, sewer; abominable body! what\r\nvile thing are you not? And think you, beggar! to have the upper hand\r\nof me? Make a leg to that man if you dare, without my permission. This\r\nsmell is intolerable; but turn from it, if you can, unless I give the\r\nword. Bolt this yam!—it is done. Carry me across yon field!—off we go.\r\nStop!—it’s a dead halt. There, I’ve trained you enough for to-day; now,\r\nsirrah, crouch down in the shade, and be quiet.—I’m rested. So, here’s\r\nfor a stroll, and a reverie homeward:— Up, carcass, and march.’ So the\r\ncarcass demurely rose and paced, and the philosopher meditated. He was\r\nintent upon squaring the circle; but bump he came against a bough. ‘How\r\nnow, clodhopping bumpkin! you would take advantage of my reveries,\r\nwould you? But I’ll be even with you;’ and seizing a cudgel, he laid\r\nacross his shoulders with right good will. But one of his backhanded\r\nthwacks injured his spinal cord; the philosopher dropped; but presently\r\ncame to. ‘Adzooks! I’ll bend or break you! Up, up, and I’ll run you\r\nhome for this.’ But wonderful to tell, his legs refused to budge; all\r\nsensation had left them. But a huge wasp happening to sting his foot,\r\nnot him, for he felt it not, the leg incontinently sprang into the air,\r\nand of itself, cut all manner of capers. Be still! Down with you!’ But\r\nthe leg refused. ‘My arms are still loyal,’ thought Grando; and with\r\nthem he at last managed to confine his refractory member. But all\r\ncommands, volitions, and persuasions, were as naught to induce his\r\nlimbs to carry him home. It was a solitary place; and five days after,\r\nGrando the philosopher was found dead under a tree.”\r\n\r\n“Ha, ha!” laughed Media, “Azzageddi is full as merry as ever.”\r\n\r\n“But, my lord,” continued Babbalanja, “some creatures have still more\r\nperverse bodies than Grando’s. In the fables of Ridendiabola, this is\r\nto be found. ‘A fresh-water Polyp, despising its marine existence;\r\nlonged to live upon air. But all it could do, its tentacles or arms\r\nstill continued to cram its stomach. By a sudden preternatural impulse,\r\nhowever, the Polyp at last turned itself inside out; supposing that\r\nafter such a proceeding it would have no gastronomic interior. But its\r\nbody proved ventricle outside as well as in. Again its arms went to\r\nwork; food was tossed in, and digestion continued.’”\r\n\r\n“Is the literal part of that a fact?” asked Mohi.\r\n\r\n“True as truth,” said Babbalanja; “the Polyp will live turned inside\r\nout.”\r\n\r\n“Somewhat curious, certainly,” said Media.—“But me-thinks, Babbalanja,\r\nthat somewhere I have heard something about organic functions, so\r\ncalled; which may account for the phenomena you mention; and I have\r\nheard too, me-thinks, of what are called reflex actions of the nerves,\r\nwhich, duly considered, might deprive of its strangeness that story of\r\nyours concerning Grande and his body.”\r\n\r\n“Mere substitutions of sounds for inexplicable meanings, my lord. In\r\nsome things science cajoles us. Now, what is undeniable of the Polyp\r\nsome physiologists analogically maintain with regard to us Mardians;\r\nthat forasmuch, as the lining of our interiors is nothing more than a\r\ncontinuation of the epidermis, or scarf-skin, therefore, that in a\r\nremote age, we too must have been turned wrong side out: an hypothesis,\r\nwhich, indirectly might account for our moral perversities: and also,\r\nfor that otherwise nonsensical term—‘the coat of the stomach;’ for\r\noriginally it must have been a surtout, instead of an inner garment.”\r\n\r\n“Pray, Azzageddi,” said Media, “are you not a fool?”\r\n\r\n“One of a jolly company, my lord; but some creatures besides wearing\r\ntheir surtouts within, sport their skeletons without: witness the\r\nlobster and turtle, who alive, study their own anatomies.”\r\n\r\n“Azzageddi, you are a zany.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon, my lord,” said Mohi, “I think him more of a lobster; it’s hard\r\ntelling his jaws from his claws.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Braid-Beard, I am a lobster, a mackerel, any thing you please;\r\nbut my ancestors were kangaroos, not monkeys, as old Boddo erroneously\r\nopined. My idea is more susceptible of demonstration than his. Among\r\nthe deepest discovered land fossils, the relics of kangaroos are\r\ndiscernible, but no relics of men. Hence, there were no giants in those\r\ndays; but on the contrary, kangaroos; and those kangaroos formed the\r\nfirst edition of mankind, since revised and corrected.”\r\n\r\n“What has become of our finises, or tails, then?” asked Mohi, wriggling\r\nin his seat.\r\n\r\n“The old question, Mohi. But where are the tails of the tadpoles, after\r\ntheir gradual metamorphosis into frogs? Have frogs any tails, old man?\r\nOur tails, Mohi, were worn off by the process of civilization;\r\nespecially at the period when our fathers began to adopt the sitting\r\nposture: the fundamental evidence of all civilization, for neither\r\napes, nor savages, can be said to sit; invariably, they squat on their\r\nhams. Among barbarous tribes benches and settles are unknown. But, my\r\nlord Media, as your liege and loving subject I can not sufficiently\r\ndeplore the deprivation of your royal tail. That stiff and vertebrated\r\nmember, as we find it in those rustic kinsmen we have disowned, would\r\nhave been useful as a supplement to your royal legs; and whereas my\r\ngood lord is now fain to totter on two stanchions, were he only a\r\nkangaroo, like the monarchs of old, the majesty of Odo would be\r\ndignified, by standing firm on a tripod.”\r\n\r\n“A very witty conceit! But have a care, Azzageddi; your theory applies\r\nnot to me.”\r\n\r\n“Babbalanja,” said Mohi, “you must be the last of the kangaroos.”\r\n\r\n“I am, Mohi.”\r\n\r\n“But the old fashioned pouch or purse of your grandams?” hinted Media.\r\n\r\n“My lord, I take it, that must have been transferred; nowadays our sex\r\ncarries the purse.”\r\n\r\n“Ha, ha!”\r\n\r\n“My lord, why this mirth? Let us be serious. Although man is no longer\r\na kangaroo, he may be said to be an inferior species of plant. Plants\r\nproper are perhaps insensible of the circulation of their sap: we\r\nmortals are physically unconscious of the circulation of the blood; and\r\nfor many ages were not even aware of the fact. Plants know nothing of\r\ntheir interiors:—three score years and ten we trundle about ours, and\r\nnever get a peep at them; plants stand on their stalks:—we stalk on our\r\nlegs; no plant flourishes over its dead root:—dead in the grave, man\r\nlives no longer above ground; plants die without food:—so we. And now\r\nfor the difference. Plants elegantly inhale nourishment, without\r\nlooking it up: like lords, they stand still and are served; and though\r\ngreen, never suffer from the colic:—whereas, we mortals must forage all\r\nround for our food: we cram our insides; and are loaded down with\r\nodious sacks and intestines. Plants make love and multiply; but excel\r\nus in all amorous enticements, wooing and winning by soft pollens and\r\nessences. Plants abide in one place, and live: we must travel or die.\r\nPlants flourish without us: we must perish without them.”\r\n\r\n“Enough Azzageddi!” cried Media. “Open not thy lips till to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\nThe Charming Yoomy Sings\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morrow came; and three abreast, with snorting prows, we raced\r\nalong; our mat-sails panting to the breeze. All present partook of the\r\nlife of the air; and unanimously Yoomy was called upon for a song. The\r\ncanoes were passing a long, white reef, sparkling with shells, like a\r\njeweler’s case: and thus Yoomy sang in the same old strain as of yore;\r\nbeginning aloud, where he had left off in his soul:—\r\n\r\n        Her sweet, sweet mouth!\r\n    The peach-pearl shell:—\r\nRed edged its lips,\r\n    That softly swell,\r\nJust oped to speak,\r\nWith blushing cheek,\r\n    That fisherman\r\nWith lonely spear\r\n    On the reef ken,\r\nAnd lift to ear\r\nIts voice to hear,—\r\n    Soft sighing South!\r\nLike this, like this,—\r\nThe rosy kiss!—\r\n    That maiden’s mouth.\r\nA shell! a shell!\r\nA vocal shell!\r\n    Song-dreaming,\r\nIn its inmost dell!\r\n\r\nHer bosom! Two buds half blown, they tell;\r\nA little valley between perfuming;\r\n            That roves away,\r\n            Deserting the day,—\r\n    The day of her eyes illuming;—\r\nThat roves away, o’er slope and fell,\r\nTill a soft, soft meadow becomes the dell.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus far, old Mohi had been wriggling about in his seat, twitching his\r\nbeard, and at every couplet looking up expectantly, as if he desired\r\nthe company to think, that he was counting upon that line as the last;\r\nBut now, starting to his feet, he exclaimed, “Hold, minstrel! thy\r\nmuse’s drapery is becoming disordered: no more!”\r\n\r\n“Then no more it shall be,” said Yoomy, “But you have lost a glorious\r\nsequel.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\nThey Draw Nigh Unto Land\r\n\r\n\r\nIn good time, after many days sailing, we snuffed the land from afar,\r\nand came to a great country, full of inland mountains, north and south\r\nstretching far out of sight. “All hail, Kolumbo!” cried Yoomy.\r\n\r\nCoasting by a portion of it, which Mohi called Kanneeda, a province of\r\nKing Bello’s, we perceived the groves rocking in the wind; their\r\nflexible boughs bending like bows; and the leaves flying forth, and\r\ndarkening the landscape, like flocks of pigeons.\r\n\r\n“Those groves must soon fall,” said Mohi.\r\n\r\n“Not so,” said Babbalanja. “My lord, as these violent gusts are formed\r\nby the hostile meeting of two currents, one from over the lagoon, the\r\nother from land; they may be taken as significant of the occasional\r\nvariances between Kanneeda and Dominora.”\r\n\r\n“Ay,” said Media, “and as Mohi hints, the breeze from Dominora must\r\nsoon overthrow the groves of Kanneeda.”\r\n\r\n“Not if the land-breeze holds, my lord;—one breeze oft blows another\r\nhome.—Stand up, and gaze! From cape to cape, this whole main we see, is\r\nyoung and froward. And far southward, past this Kanneeda and Vivenza,\r\nare haughty, overbearing streams, which at their mouths dam back the\r\nocean, and long refuse to mix their freshness with the foreign\r\nbrine:—so bold, so strong, so bent on hurling off aggression is this\r\nbrave main, Kolumbo;—last sought, last found, Mardi’s estate, so long\r\nkept back;—pray Oro, it be not squandered foolishly. Here lie\r\nplantations, held in fee by stout hearts and arms; and boundless\r\nfields, that may be had for seeing. Here, your foes are forests, struck\r\ndown with bloodless maces.—Ho! Mardi’s Poor, and Mardi’s Strong! ye,\r\nwho starve or beg; seventh-sons who slave for earth’s first-born—here\r\nis your home; predestinated yours; Come over, Empire-founders! fathers\r\nof the wedded tribes to come!—abject now, illustrious evermore:—Ho:\r\nSinew, Brawn, and Thigh!”\r\n\r\n“A very fine invocation,” said Media, “now Babbalanja, be seated; and\r\ntell us whether Dominora and the kings of Porpheero do not own some\r\nsmall portion of this great continent, which just now you poetically\r\npronounced as the spoil of any vagabonds who may choose to settle\r\ntherein? Is not Kanneeda, Dominora’s?”\r\n\r\n“And was not Vivenza once Dominora’s also? And what Vivenza now is,\r\nKanneeda soon must be. I speak not, my lord, as wishful of what I say,\r\nbut simply as foreknowing it. The thing must come. Vain for Dominora to\r\nclaim allegiance from all the progeny she spawns. As well might the old\r\npatriarch of the flood reappear, and claim the right of rule over all\r\nmankind, as descended from the loins of his three roving sons.\r\n\r\n“’Tis the old law:—the East peoples the West, the West the East; flux\r\nand reflux. And time may come, after the rise and fall of nations yet\r\nunborn, that, risen from its future ashes, Porpheero shall be the\r\npromised land, and from her surplus hordes Kolumbo people it.”\r\n\r\nStill coasting on, next day, we came to Vivenza; and as Media desired\r\nto land first at a point midway between its extremities, in order to\r\nbehold the convocation of chiefs supposed to be assembled at this\r\nseason, we held on our way, till we gained a lofty ridge, jutting out\r\ninto the lagoon, a bastion to the neighboring land. It terminated in a\r\nlofty natural arch of solid trap. Billows beat against its base. But\r\nabove, waved an inviting copse, wherein was revealed an open temple of\r\ncanes, containing one only image, that of a helmeted female, the\r\ntutelar deity of Vivenza.\r\n\r\nThe canoes drew near.\r\n\r\n“Lo! what inscription is that?” cried Media, “there, chiseled over the\r\narch?”\r\n\r\nStudying those immense hieroglyphics awhile, antiquarian Mohi still\r\neyeing them, said slowly:—“In-this-re-publi-can-land-all-men-are-\r\nborn-free-and-equal.”\r\n\r\n“False!” said Media.\r\n\r\n“And how long stay they so?” said Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n“But look lower, old man,” cried Media, “methinks there’s a small\r\nhieroglyphic or two hidden away in yonder angle.—Interpret them, old\r\nman.”\r\n\r\nAfter much screwing of his eyes, for those characters were very minute,\r\nChampollion Mohi thus spoke—” Except-the-tribe-of-Hamo.”\r\n\r\n“That nullifies the other,” cried Media. “Ah, ye republicans!”\r\n\r\n“It seems to have been added for a postscript,” rejoined Braid-Beard,\r\nscrewing his eyes again.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps so,” said Babbalanja, “but some wag must have done it.”\r\n\r\nShooting through the arch, we rapidly gained the beach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\nThey Visit The Great Central Temple Of Vivenza\r\n\r\n\r\nThe throng that greeted us upon landing were exceedingly boisterous.\r\n\r\n“Whence came ye?” they cried. “Whither bound? Saw ye ever such a land\r\nas this? Is it not a great and extensive republic? Pray, observe how\r\ntall we are; just feel of our thighs; Are we not a glorious people?\r\nHere, feel of our beards. Look round; look round; be not afraid; Behold\r\nthose palms; swear now, that this land surpasses all others. Old\r\nBello’s mountains are mole-hills to ours; his rivers, rills; his\r\nempires, villages; his palm-trees, shrubs.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said Babbalanja. “But great Oro must have had some hand in\r\nmaking your mountains and streams.—Would ye have been as great in a\r\ndesert?”\r\n\r\n“Where is your king?” asked Media, drawing himself up in his robe, and\r\ncocking his crown.\r\n\r\n“Ha, ha, my fine fellow! We are all kings here; royalty breathes in the\r\ncommon air. But come on, come on. Let us show you our great Temple of\r\nFreedom.”\r\n\r\nAnd so saying, irreverently grasping his sacred arm, they conducted us\r\ntoward a lofty structure, planted upon a bold hill, and supported by\r\nthirty pillars of palm; four quite green; as if recently added; and\r\nbeyond these, an almost interminable vacancy, as if all the palms in\r\nMardi, were at some future time, to aid in upholding that fabric.\r\n\r\nUpon the summit of the temple was a staff; and as we drew nigh, a man\r\nwith a collar round his neck, and the red marks of stripes upon his\r\nback, was just in the act of hoisting a tappa standard— correspondingly\r\nstriped. Other collared menials were going in and out of the temple.\r\n\r\nNear the porch, stood an image like that on the top of the arch we had\r\nseen. Upon its pedestal, were pasted certain hieroglyphical notices;\r\naccording to Mohi, offering rewards for missing men, so many hands\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\nEntering the temple, we beheld an amphitheatrical space, in the middle\r\nof which, a great fire was burning. Around it, were many chiefs, robed\r\nin long togas, and presenting strange contrasts in their style of\r\ntattooing.\r\n\r\nSome were sociably laughing, and chatting; others diligently making\r\nexcavations between their teeth with slivers of bamboo; or turning\r\ntheir heads into mills, were grinding up leaves and ejecting their\r\njuices. Some were busily inserting the down of a thistle into their\r\nears. Several stood erect, intent upon maintaining striking attitudes;\r\ntheir javelins tragically crossed upon their chests. They would have\r\nlooked very imposing, were it not, that in rear their vesture was sadly\r\ndisordered. Others, with swelling fronts, seemed chiefly indebted to\r\ntheir dinners for their dignity. Many were nodding and napping. And,\r\nhere and there, were sundry indefatigable worthies, making a great show\r\nof imperious and indispensable business; sedulously folding banana\r\nleaves into scrolls, and recklessly placing them into the hands of\r\nlittle boys, in gay turbans and trim little girdles, who thereupon fled\r\nas if with salvation for the dying.\r\n\r\nIt was a crowded scene; the dusky chiefs, here and there, grouped\r\ntogether, and their fantastic tattooings showing like the carved work\r\non quaint old chimney-stacks, seen from afar. But one of their number\r\novertopped all the rest. As when, drawing nigh unto old Rome, amid the\r\ncrowd of sculptured columns and gables, St. Peter’s grand dome soars\r\nfar aloft, serene in the upper air; so, showed one calm grand forehead\r\namong those of this mob of chieftains. That head was Saturnina’s. Gall\r\nand Spurzheim! saw you ever such a brow?—poised like an avalanche,\r\nunder the shadow of a forest! woe betide the devoted valleys below!\r\nLavatar! behold those lips,—like mystic scrolls! Those eyes,— like\r\npanthers’ caves at the base of Popocatepetl!\r\n\r\n“By my right hand, Saturnina,” cried Babbalanja, “but thou wert made in\r\nthe image of thy Maker! Yet, have I beheld men, to the eye as\r\ncommanding as thou; and surmounted by heads globe-like as thine, who\r\nnever had thy caliber. We must measure brains, not heads, my lord;\r\nelse, the sperm whale, with his tun of an occiput, would transcend us\r\nall.”\r\n\r\nNear by, were arched ways, leading to subterranean places, whence\r\nissued a savory steam, and an extraordinary clattering of calabashes,\r\nand smacking of lips, as if something were being eaten down there by\r\nthe fattest of fat fellows, with the heartiest of appetites, and the\r\nmost irresistible of relishes. It was a quaffing, guzzling, gobbling\r\nnoise. Peeping down, we beheld a company, breasted up against a board,\r\ngroaning under numerous viands. In the middle of all, was a mighty\r\ngreat gourd, yellow as gold, and jolly round like a pumpkin in October,\r\nand so big it must have grown in the sun. Thence flowed a tide of red\r\nwine. And before it, stood plenty of paunches being filled therewith\r\nlike portly stone jars at a fountain. Melancholy to tell, before that\r\nfine flood of old wine, and among those portly old topers, was a lean\r\nman; who occasionally ducked in his bill. He looked like an ibis\r\nstanding in the Nile at flood tide, among a tongue-lapping herd of\r\nhippopotami.\r\n\r\nThey were jolly as the jolliest; and laughed so uproariously, that\r\ntheir hemispheres all quivered and shook, like vast provinces in an\r\nearthquake. Ha! ha! ha! how they laughed, and they roared. A deaf man\r\nmight have heard them; and no milk could have soured within a\r\nforty-two-pounder ball shot of that place.\r\n\r\nNow, the smell of good things is no very bad thing in itself. It is the\r\nsavor of good things beyond; proof positive of a glorious good meal. So\r\nsnuffing up those zephyrs from Araby the blest, those boisterous gales,\r\nblowing from out the mouths of baked boars, stuffed with bread-fruit,\r\nbananas, and sage, we would fain have gone down and partaken.\r\n\r\nBut this could not be; for we were told that those worthies below, were\r\na club in secret conclave; very busy in settling certain weighty state\r\naffairs upon a solid basis, They were all chiefs of immense\r\ncapacity:—how many gallons, there was no finding out.\r\n\r\nBe sure, now, a most riotous noise came up from those catacombs, which\r\nseemed full of the ghosts of fat Lamberts; and this uproar it was, that\r\nheightened the din above-ground.\r\n\r\nBut heedless of all, in the midst of the amphitheater, stood a tall,\r\ngaunt warrior, ferociously tattooed, with a beak like a buzzard; long\r\ndusty locks; and his hands full of headless arrows. He was laboring\r\nunder violent paroxysms; three benevolent individuals essaying to hold\r\nhim. But repeatedly breaking loose, he burst anew into his delirium;\r\nwhile with an absence of sympathy, distressing to behold, the rest of\r\nthe assembly seemed wholly engrossed with themselves; nor did they\r\nappear to care how soon the unfortunate lunatic might demolish himself\r\nby his frantic proceedings.\r\n\r\nToward one side of the amphitheatrical space, perched high upon an\r\nelevated dais, sat a white-headed old man with a tomahawk in his hand:\r\nearnestly engaged in overseeing the tumult; though not a word did he\r\nsay. Occasionally, however, he was regarded by those present with a\r\nmysterious sort of deference; and when they chanced to pass between him\r\nand the crazy man, they invariably did so in a stooping position;\r\nprobably to elude the atmospheric grape and cannister, continually\r\nflying from the mouth of the lunatic.\r\n\r\n“What mob is this?” cried Media.\r\n\r\n“’Tis the grand council of Vivenza,” cried a bystander. “Hear ye not\r\nAlanno?” and he pointed to the lunatic.\r\n\r\nNow coming close to Alanno, we found, that with incredible volubility,\r\nhe was addressing the assembly upon some all-absorbing subject\r\nconnected with King Bello, and his presumed encroachments toward the\r\nnorthwest of Vivenza.\r\n\r\nOne hand smiting his hip, and the other his head, the lunatic thus\r\nproceeded; roaring like a wild beast, and beating the air like a\r\nwindmill:—\r\n\r\n“I have said it! the thunder is flashing, the lightning is crashing!\r\nalready there’s an earthquake in Dominora! Full soon will old Bello\r\ndiscover that his diabolical machinations against this ineffable land\r\nmust soon come to naught. Who dare not declare, that we are not\r\ninvincible? I repeat it, we are. Ha! ha! Audacious Bello must bite the\r\ndust! Hair by hair, we will trail his gory gray beard at the end of our\r\nspears! Ha, ha! I grow hoarse; but would mine were a voice like the\r\nwild bulls of Bullorom, that I might be heard from one end of this\r\ngreat and gorgeous land to its farthest zenith; ay, to the uttermost\r\ndiameter of its circumference. Awake! oh Vivenza. The signs of the\r\ntimes are portentous; nay, extraordinary; I hesitate not to add,\r\npeculiar! Up! up! Let us not descend to the bathos, when we should soar\r\nto the climax! Does not all Mardi wink and look on? Is the great sun\r\nitself a frigid spectator? Then let us double up our mandibles to the\r\ndeadly encounter. Methinks I see it now. Old Bello is crafty, and his\r\noath is recorded to obliterate us! Across this wide lagoon he casts his\r\nserpent eyes; whets his insatiate bill; mumbles his barbarous tusks;\r\nlicks his forked tongues; and who knows when we shall have the shark in\r\nour midst? Yet be not deceived; for though as yet, Bello has forborn\r\nmolesting us openly, his emissaries are at work; his infernal sappers,\r\nand miners, and wet-nurses, and midwives, and grave- diggers are busy!\r\nHis canoe-yards are all in commotion! In navies his forests are being\r\nlaunched upon the wave; and ere long typhoons, zephyrs, white-squalls,\r\nbalmy breezes, hurricanes, and besoms will be raging round us!”\r\n\r\nHis philippic concluded, Alanno was conducted from the place; and being\r\nnow quite exhausted, cold cobble-stones were applied to his temples,\r\nand he was treated to a bath in a stream.\r\n\r\nThis chieftain, it seems, was from a distant western valley, called\r\nHio-Hio, one of the largest and most fertile in Vivenza, though but\r\nrecently settled. Its inhabitants, and those of the vales adjoining,— a\r\nright sturdy set of fellows,—were accounted the most dogmatically\r\ndemocratic and ultra of all the tribes in Vivenza; ever seeking to push\r\non their brethren to the uttermost; and especially were they bitter\r\nagainst Bello. But they were a fine young tribe, nevertheless. Like\r\nstrong new wine they worked violently in becoming clear. Time, perhaps,\r\nwould make them all right.\r\n\r\nAn interval of greater uproar than ever now ensued; during which, with\r\nhis tomahawk, the white-headed old man repeatedly thumped and pounded\r\nthe seat where he sat, apparently to augment the din, though he looked\r\nanxious to suppress it.\r\n\r\nAt last, tiring of his posture, he whispered in the ear of a chief, his\r\nfriend; who, approaching a portly warrior present, prevailed upon him\r\nto rise and address the assembly. And no sooner did this one do so,\r\nthan the whole convocation dispersed, as if to their yams; and with a\r\ngrin, the little old man leaped from his seat, and stretched his legs\r\non a mat.\r\n\r\nThe fire was now extinguished, and the temple deserted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\nWherein Babbalanja Comments Upon The Speech Of Alanno\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we lingered in the precincts of the temple after all others had\r\ndeparted, sundry comments were made upon what we had seen; and having\r\nremarked the hostility of the lunatic orator toward Dominora,\r\nBabbalanja thus addressed Media:—\r\n\r\n“My lord, I am constrained to believe, that all Vivenza can not be of\r\nthe same mind with the grandiloquent chief from Hio-Hio. Nevertheless,\r\nI imagine, that between Dominora and this land, there exists at bottom\r\na feeling akin to animosity, which is not yet wholly extinguished;\r\nthough but the smoldering embers of a once raging fire. My lord, you\r\nmay call it poetry if you will, but there are nations in Mardi, that to\r\nothers stand in the relation of sons to sires. Thus with Dominora and\r\nVivenza. And though, its majority attained, Vivenza is now its own\r\nmaster, yet should it not fail in a reverential respect for its parent.\r\nIn man or nation, old age is honorable; and a boy, however tall, should\r\nnever take his sire by the beard. And though Dominora did indeed ill\r\nmerit Vivenza’s esteem, yet by abstaining from criminations, Vivenza\r\nshould ever merit its own. And if in time to come, which Oro forbid,\r\nVivenza must needs go to battle with King Bello, let Vivenza first\r\ncross the old veteran’s spear with all possible courtesy. On the other\r\nhand, my lord, King Bello should never forget, that whatever be\r\nglorious in Vivenza, redounds to himself. And as some gallant old lord\r\nproudly measures the brawn and stature of his son; and joys to view in\r\nhis noble young lineaments the likeness of his own; bethinking him,\r\nthat when at last laid in his tomb, he will yet survive in the long,\r\nstrong life of his child, the worthy inheritor of his valor and renown;\r\neven so, should King Bello regard the generous promise of this young\r\nVivenza of his own lusty begetting. My lord, behold these two states!\r\nOf all nations in the Archipelago, they alone are one in blood.\r\nDominora is the last and greatest Anak of Old Times; Vivenza, the\r\nforemost and goodliest stripling of the Present. One is full of the\r\npast; the other brims with the future. Ah! did this sire’s old heart\r\nbut beat to free thoughts, and back his bold son, all Mardi would go\r\ndown before them. And high Oro may have ordained for them a career,\r\nlittle divined by the mass. Methinks, that as Vivenza will never cause\r\nold Bello to weep for his son; so, Vivenza will not, this many a long\r\nyear, be called to weep over the grave of its sire. And though King\r\nBello may yet lay aside his old-fashioned cocked hat of a crown, and\r\ncomply with the plain costume of the times; yet will his, frame remain\r\nsturdy as of yore, and equally grace any habiliments he may don. And\r\nthose who say, Dominora is old and worn out, may very possibly err. For\r\nif, as a nation, Dominora be old—her present generation is full as\r\nyoung as the youths in any land under the sun. Then, Ho! worthy twain!\r\nEach worthy the other, join hands on the instant, and weld them\r\ntogether. Lo! the past is a prophet. Be the future, its prophecy\r\nfulfilled.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\nA Scene In The Land Of Warwicks, Or King-Makers\r\n\r\n\r\nWending our way from the temple, we were accompanied by a fluent,\r\nobstreperous wight, one Znobbi, a runaway native of Porpheero, but now\r\nan enthusiastic inhabitant of Vivenza.\r\n\r\n“Here comes our great chief!” he cried. “Behold him! It was _I_ that\r\nhad a hand in making him what he is!”\r\n\r\nAnd so saying, he pointed out a personage, no way distinguished, except\r\nby the tattooing on his forehead—stars, thirty in number; and an\r\nuncommonly long spear in his hand. Freely he mingled with the crowd.\r\n\r\n“Behold, how familiar I am with him!” cried Znobbi, approaching, and\r\npitcher-wise taking him by the handle of his face.\r\n\r\n“Friend,” said the dignitary, “thy salute is peculiar, but welcome. I\r\nreverence the enlightened people of this land.”\r\n\r\n“Mean-spirited hound!” muttered Media, “were I him, I had impaled that\r\naudacious plebeian.”\r\n\r\n“There’s a Head-Chief for you, now, my fine fellow!” cried Znobbi.\r\n“Hurrah! Three cheers! Ay, ay! All kings here—all equal. Every thing’s\r\nin common.”\r\n\r\nHere, a bystander, feeling something grazing his side, looked down; and\r\nperceived Znobbi’s hand in clandestine vicinity to the pouch at his\r\ngirdle-end.\r\n\r\nWhereupon the crowd shouted, “A thief! a thief!” And with a loud voice\r\nthe starred chief cried—“Seize him, people, and tie him to yonder\r\ntree.”\r\n\r\nAnd they seized, and tied him on the spot.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Media, “this chief has something to say, after all; he\r\npinions a king at a word, though a plebeian takes him by the nose.\r\nBeshrew me, I doubt not, that spear of his, though without a tassel, is\r\nlonger and sharper than mine.”\r\n\r\n“There’s not so much freedom here as these freemen think,” said\r\nBabbalanja, turning; “I laugh and admire.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\nThey Hearken Unto A Voice From The Gods\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day we retraced our voyage northward, to visit that section of\r\nVivenza.\r\n\r\nIn due time we landed.\r\n\r\nTo look round was refreshing. Of all the lands we had seen, none looked\r\nmore promising. The groves stood tall and green; the fields spread\r\nflush and broad; the dew of the first morning seemed hardly vanished\r\nfrom the grass. On all sides was heard the fall of waters, the swarming\r\nof bees, and the rejoicing hum of a thriving population.\r\n\r\n“Ha, ha!” laughed Yoomy, “Labor laughs in this land; and claps his\r\nhands in the jubilee groves! methinks that Yillah will yet be found.”\r\n\r\nGenerously entertained, we tarried in this land; till at length, from\r\nover the Lagoon, came full tidings of the eruption we had witnessed in\r\nFranko, with many details. The conflagration had spread through\r\nPorpheero and the kings were to and fro hunted, like malefactors by\r\nblood-hounds; all that part of Mardi was heaving with throes.\r\n\r\nWith the utmost delight, these tidings were welcomed by many; yet\r\nothers heard them with boding concern.\r\n\r\nThose, too, there were, who rejoiced that the kings were cast down; but\r\nmourned that the people themselves stood not firmer. A victory, turned\r\nto no wise and enduring account, said they, is no victory at all. Some\r\nvictories revert to the vanquished.\r\n\r\nBut day by day great crowds ran down to the beach, in wait for canoes\r\nperiodically bringing further intelligence.\r\n\r\nEvery hour new cries startled the air. “Hurrah! another, kingdom is\r\nburnt down to the earth’s edge; another demigod is unhelmed; another\r\nrepublic is dawning. Shake hands, freemen, shake hands! Soon will we\r\nhear of Dominora down in the dust; of hapless Verdanna free as\r\nourselves; all Porpheero’s volcanoes are bursting! Who may withstand\r\nthe people? The times tell terrible tales to tyrants! Ere we die,\r\nfreemen, all Mardi will be free.”\r\n\r\nOverhearing these shouts, Babbalanja thus addressed Media:—“My lord, I\r\ncan not but believe, that these men, are far more excited than those\r\nwith whom they so ardently sympathize. But no wonder. The single\r\ndischarges which are heard in Porpheero; here come condensed in one\r\ntremendous report. Every arrival is a firing off of events by\r\nplatoons.”\r\n\r\nNow, during this tumultuous interval, King Media very prudently kept\r\nhimself exceedingly quiet. He doffed his regalia; and in all things\r\ncarried himself with a dignified discretion. And many hours he absented\r\nhimself; none knowing whither he went, or what his employment.\r\n\r\nSo also with Babbalanja. But still pursuing our search, at last we all\r\njourneyed into a great valley, whose inhabitants were more than\r\ncommonly inflated with the ardor of the times.\r\n\r\nRambling on, we espied a clamorous crowd gathered about a conspicuous\r\npalm, against which, a scroll was fixed.\r\n\r\nThe people were violently agitated; storming out maledictions against\r\nthe insolent knave, who, over night must have fixed there, that\r\nscandalous document. But whoever he may have been, certain it was, he\r\nhad contrived to hood himself effectually.\r\n\r\nAfter much vehement discussion, during which sundry inflammatory\r\nharangues were made from the stumps of trees near by, it was proposed,\r\nthat the scroll should be read aloud, so that all might give ear.\r\n\r\nSeizing it, a fiery youth mounted upon the bowed shoulders of an old\r\nman, his sire; and with a shrill voice, ever and anon interrupted by\r\noutcries, read as follows:—\r\n\r\n“Sovereign-kings of Vivenza! it is fit you should hearken to wisdom.\r\nBut well aware, that you give ear to little wisdom except of your own;\r\nand that as freemen, you are free to hunt down him who dissents from\r\nyour majesties; I deem it proper to address you anonymously.\r\n\r\n“And if it please you, you may ascribe this voice to the gods: for\r\nnever will you trace it to man.\r\n\r\n“It is not unknown, sovereign-kings! that in these boisterous days, the\r\nlessons of history are almost discarded, as superseded by present\r\nexperiences. And that while all Mardi’s Present has grown out of its\r\nPast, it is becoming obsolete to refer to what has been. Yet,\r\nperadventure, the Past is an apostle.\r\n\r\n“The grand error of this age, sovereign-kings! is the general\r\nsupposition, that the very special Diabolus is abroad; whereas, the\r\nvery special Diabolus has been abroad ever since Mardi began.\r\n\r\n“And the grand error of your nation, sovereign-kings! seems this:—The\r\nconceit that Mardi is now in the last scene of the last act of her\r\ndrama; and that all preceding events were ordained, to bring about the\r\ncatastrophe you believe to be at hand,—a universal and permanent\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\n“May it please you, those who hold to these things are fools, and not\r\nwise.\r\n\r\n“Time is made up of various ages; and each thinks its own a novelty.\r\nBut imbedded in the walls of the pyramids, which outrun all\r\nchronologies, sculptured stones are found, belonging to yet older\r\nfabrics. And as in the mound-building period of yore, so every age\r\nthinks its erections will forever endure. But as your forests grow\r\napace, sovereign-kings! overrunning the tumuli in your western vales;\r\nso, while deriving their substance from the past, succeeding\r\ngenerations overgrow it; but in time, themselves decay.\r\n\r\n“Oro decrees these vicissitudes.\r\n\r\n“In chronicles of old, you read, sovereign kings! that an eagle from\r\nthe clouds presaged royalty to the fugitive Taquinoo; and a king,\r\nTaquinoo reigned; No end to my dynasty, thought he.\r\n\r\n“But another omen descended, foreshadowing the fall of Zooperbi, his\r\nson; and Zooperbi returning from his camp, found his country a fortress\r\nagainst him. No more kings would she have. And for five hundred\r\ntwelve-moons the Regifugium or King’s-flight, was annually celebrated\r\nlike your own jubilee day. And rampant young orators stormed out\r\ndetestation of kings; and augurs swore that their birds presaged\r\nimmortality to freedom.\r\n\r\n“Then, Romara’s free eagles flew over all Mardi, and perched on the\r\ntopmost diadems of the east.\r\n\r\n“Ever thus must it be.\r\n\r\n“For, mostly, monarchs are as gemmed bridles upon the world, checking\r\nthe plungings of a steed from the Pampas. And republics are as vast\r\nreservoirs, draining down all streams to one level; and so, breeding a\r\nfullness which can not remain full, without overflowing. And thus,\r\nRomara flooded all Mardi, till scarce an Ararat was left of the lofty\r\nkingdoms which had been.\r\n\r\n“Thus, also, did Franko, fifty twelve-moons ago. Thus may she do again.\r\nAnd though not yet, have you, sovereign-kings! in any large degree done\r\nlikewise, it is because you overflow your redundancies within your own\r\nmighty borders; having a wild western waste, which many shepherds with\r\ntheir flocks could not overrun in a day. Yet overrun at last it will\r\nbe; and then, the recoil must come.\r\n\r\n“And, may it please you, that thus far your chronicles had narrated a\r\nvery different story, had your population been pressed and packed, like\r\nthat of your old sire-land Dominora. Then, your great experiment might\r\nhave proved an explosion; like the chemist’s who, stirring his mixture,\r\nwas blown by it into the air.\r\n\r\n“For though crossed, and recrossed by many brave quarterings, and\r\nboasting the great Bull in your pedigree; yet, sovereign-kings! you are\r\nnot meditative philosophers like the people of a small republic of old;\r\nnor enduring stoics, like their neighbors. Pent up, like them, may it\r\nplease you, your thirteen original tribes had proved more turbulent,\r\nthan so many mutinous legions. Free horses need wide prairies; and\r\nfortunate for you, sovereign-kings! that you have room enough, wherein\r\nto be free.\r\n\r\n“And, may it please you, you are free, partly, because you are young.\r\nYour nation is like a fine, florid youth, full of fiery impulses, and\r\nhard to restrain; his strong hand nobly championing his heart. On all\r\nsides, freely he gives, and still seeks to acquire. The breath of his\r\nnostrils is like smoke in spring air; every tendon is electric with\r\ngenerous resolves. The oppressor he defies to his beard; the high walls\r\nof old opinions he scales with a bound. In the future he sees all the\r\ndomes of the East.\r\n\r\n“But years elapse, and this bold boy is transformed. His eyes open not\r\nas of yore; his heart is shut up as a vice. He yields not a groat; and\r\nseeking no more acquisitions, is only bent on preserving his hoard. The\r\nmaxims once trampled under foot, are now printed on his front; and he\r\nwho hated oppressors, is become an oppressor himself.\r\n\r\n“Thus, often, with men; thus, often, with nations. Then marvel not,\r\nsovereign-kings! that old states are different from yours; and think\r\nnot, your own must forever remain liberal as now.\r\n\r\n“Each age thinks its own is eternal. But though for five hundred\r\ntwelve-moons, all Romara, by courtesy of history, was republican; yet,\r\nat last, her terrible king-tigers came, and spotted themselves with\r\ngore.\r\n\r\n“And time was, when Dominora was republican, down to her sturdy back-\r\nbone. The son of an absolute monarch became the man Karolus; and his\r\ncrown and head, both rolled in the dust. And Dominora had her patriots\r\nby thousands; and lusty Defenses, and glorious Areopagiticas were\r\nwritten, not since surpassed; and no turban was doffed save in homage\r\nof Oro.\r\n\r\n“Yet, may it please you, to the sound of pipe and tabor, the second\r\nKing Karolus returned in good time; and was hailed gracious majesty by\r\nhigh and low.\r\n\r\n“Throughout all eternity, the parts of the past are but parts of the\r\nfuture reversed. In the old foot-prints, up and down, you mortals go,\r\neternally traveling your Sierras. And not more infallible the\r\nponderings of the Calculating Machine than the deductions from the\r\ndecimals of history.\r\n\r\n“In nations, sovereign-kings! there is a transmigration of souls; in\r\nyou, is a marvelous destiny. The eagle of Romara revives in your own\r\nmountain bird, and once more is plumed for her flight. Her screams are\r\nanswered by the vauntful cries of a hawk; his red comb yet reeking with\r\nslaughter. And one East, one West, those bold birds may fly, till they\r\nlock pinions in the midmost beyond.\r\n\r\n“But, soaring in the sky over the nations that shall gather their\r\nbroods under their wings, that bloody hawk may hereafter be taken for\r\nthe eagle.\r\n\r\n“And though crimson republics may rise in constellations, like fiery\r\nAldebarans, speeding to their culminations; yet, down must they sink at\r\nlast, and leave the old sultan-sun in the sky; in time, again to be\r\ndeposed.\r\n\r\n“For little longer, may it please you, can republics subsist now, than\r\nin days gone by. For, assuming that Mardi is wiser than of old;\r\nnevertheless, though all men approached sages in intelligence, some\r\nwould yet be more wise than others; and so, the old degrees be\r\npreserved. And no exemption would an equality of knowledge furnish,\r\nfrom the inbred servility of mortal to mortal; from all the organic\r\ncauses, which inevitably divide mankind into brigades and battalions,\r\nwith captains at their head.\r\n\r\n“Civilization has not ever been the brother of equality. Freedom was\r\nborn among the wild eyries in the mountains; and barbarous tribes have\r\nsheltered under her wings, when the enlightened people of the plain\r\nhave nestled under different pinions.\r\n\r\n“Though, thus far, for you, sovereign-kings! your republic has been\r\nfruitful of blessings; yet, in themselves, monarchies are not utterly\r\nevil. For many nations, they are better than republics; for many, they\r\nwill ever so remain. And better, on all hands, that peace should rule\r\nwith a scepter, than than the tribunes of the people should brandish\r\ntheir broadswords. Better be the subject of a king, upright and just;\r\nthan a freeman in Franko, with the executioner’s ax at every corner.\r\n\r\n“It is not the prime end, and chief blessing, to be politically free.\r\nAnd freedom is only good as a means; is no end in itself Nor, did man\r\nfight it out against his masters to the haft, not then, would he\r\nuncollar his neck from the yoke. A born thrall to the last, yelping out\r\nhis liberty, he still remains a slave unto Oro; and well is it for the\r\nuniverse, that Oro’s scepter is absolute.\r\n\r\n“World-old the saying, that it is easier to govern others, than\r\noneself. And that all men should govern themselves as nations, needs\r\nthat all men be better, and wiser, than the wisest of one-man rulers.\r\nBut in no stable democracy do all men govern themselves. Though an army\r\nbe all volunteers, martial law must prevail. Delegate your power, you\r\nleagued mortals must. The hazard you must stand. And though unlike King\r\nBello of Dominora, your great chieftain, sovereign-kings! may not\r\ndeclare war of himself; nevertheless, has he done a still more imperial\r\nthing:—gone to war without declaring intentions. You yourselves were\r\nprecipitated upon a neighboring nation, ere you knew your spears were\r\nin your hands.\r\n\r\n“But, as in stars you have written it on the welkin, sovereign-kings!\r\nyou are a great and glorious people. And verily, yours is the best and\r\nhappiest land under the sun. But not wholly, because you, in your\r\nwisdom, decreed it: your origin and geography necessitated it. Nor, in\r\ntheir germ, are all your blessings to be ascribed to the noble sires,\r\nwho of yore fought in your behalf, sovereign-kings! Your nation enjoyed\r\nno little independence before your Declaration declared it. Your\r\nancient pilgrims fathered your liberty; and your wild woods harbored\r\nthe nursling. For the state that to-day is made up of slaves, can not\r\nto-morrow transmute her bond into free; though lawlessness may\r\ntransform them into brutes. Freedom is the name for a thing that is\r\n_not_ freedom; this, a lesson never learned in an hour or an age. By\r\nsome tribes it will never be learned.\r\n\r\n“Yet, if it please you, there may be such a thing as being free under\r\nCaesar. Ages ago, there were as many vital freemen, as breathe vital\r\nair to-day.\r\n\r\n“Names make not distinctions; some despots rule without swaying\r\nscepters. Though King Bello’s palace was not put together by yoked men;\r\nyour federal temple of freedom, sovereign-kings! was the handiwork of\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\n“It is not gildings, and gold maces, and crown jewels alone, that make\r\na people servile. There is much bowing and cringing among you\r\nyourselves, sovereign-kings! Poverty is abased before riches, all Mardi\r\nover; any where, it is hard to be a debtor; any where, the wise will\r\nlord it over fools; every where, suffering is found.\r\n\r\n“Thus, freedom is more social than political. And its real felicity is\r\nnot to be shared. _That_ is of a man’s own individual getting and\r\nholding. It is not, who rules the state, but who rules me. Better be\r\nsecure under one king, than exposed to violence from twenty millions of\r\nmonarchs, though oneself be of the number.\r\n\r\n“But superstitious notions you harbor, sovereign kings! Did you visit\r\nDominora, you would not be marched straight into a dungeon. And though\r\nyou would behold sundry sights displeasing, you would start to inhale\r\nsuch liberal breezes; and hear crowds boasting of their privileges; as\r\nyou, of yours. Nor has the wine of Dominora, a monarchical flavor.\r\n\r\n“Now, though far and wide, to keep equal pace with the times, great\r\nreforms, of a verity, be needed; nowhere are bloody revolutions\r\nrequired. Though it be the most certain of remedies, no prudent invalid\r\nopens his veins, to let out his disease with his life. And though all\r\nevils may be assuaged; all evils can not be done away. For evil is the\r\nchronic malady of the universe; and checked in one place, breaks forth\r\nin another.\r\n\r\n“Of late, on this head, some wild dreams have departed.\r\n\r\n“There are many, who erewhile believed that the age of pikes and\r\njavelins was passed; that after a heady and blustering youth, old Mardi\r\nwas at last settling down into a serene old age; and that the Indian\r\nsummer, first discovered in your land, sovereign kings! was the hazy\r\nvapor emitted from its tranquil pipe. But it has not so proved. Mardi’s\r\npeaces are but truces. Long absent, at last the red comets have\r\nreturned. And return they must, though their periods be ages. And\r\nshould Mardi endure till mountain melt into mountain, and all the isles\r\nform one table-land; yet, would it but expand the old battle-plain.\r\n\r\n“Students of history are horror-struck at the massacres of old; but in\r\nthe shambles, men are being murdered to-day. Could time be reversed,\r\nand the future change places with the past, the past would cry out\r\nagainst us, and our future, full as loudly, as we against the ages\r\nforegone. All the Ages are his children, calling each other names.\r\n\r\n“Hark ye, sovereign-kings! cheer not on the yelping pack too furiously:\r\nHunters have been torn by their hounds. Be advised; wash your hands.\r\nHold aloof. Oro has poured out an ocean for an everlasting barrier\r\nbetween you and the worst folly which other republics have perpetrated.\r\nThat barrier hold sacred. And swear never to cross over to Porpheero,\r\nby manifesto or army, unless you traverse dry land.\r\n\r\n“And be not too grasping, nearer home. It is not freedom to filch.\r\nExpand not your area too widely, now. Seek you proselytes? Neighboring\r\nnations may be free, without coming under your banner. And if you can\r\nnot lay your ambition, know this: that it is best served, by waiting\r\nevents.\r\n\r\n“Time, but Time only, may enable you to cross the equator; and give you\r\nthe Arctic Circles for your boundaries.”\r\n\r\nSo read the anonymous scroll; which straightway, was torn into shreds.\r\n\r\n“Old tory, and monarchist!” they shouted, “Preaching over his benighted\r\nsermons in these enlightened times! Fool! does he not know that all the\r\nPast and its graves are being dug over?”\r\n\r\nThey were furious; so wildly rolling their eyes after victims, that\r\nwell was it for King Media, he wore not his crown; and in silence, we\r\nmoved unnoted from out the crowd.\r\n\r\n“My lord, I am amazed at the indiscretion of a demigod,” said\r\nBabbalanja, as we passed on our way; “I recognized your sultanic style\r\nthe very first sentence. This, then, is the result of your hours of\r\nseclusion.”\r\n\r\n“Philosopher! I am astounded at your effrontery. I detected your\r\nphilosophy the very first maxim. Who posted that parchment for you?”\r\n\r\nSo, each charged the other with its authorship: and there was no\r\nfinding out, whether, indeed, either knew aught of its origin.\r\n\r\nNow, could it have been Babbalanja? Hardly. For, philosophic as the\r\ndocument was, it seemed too dogmatic and conservative for him. King\r\nMedia? But though imperially absolute in his political sentiments,\r\nMedia delivered not himself so boldly, when actually beholding the\r\neruption in Franko.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the settlement of this question must be left to the\r\ncommentators on Mardi, some four or five hundred centuries hence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\nThey Visit The Extreme South Of Vivenza\r\n\r\n\r\nWe penetrated further and further into the valleys around; but, though,\r\nas elsewhere, at times we heard whisperings that promised an end to our\r\nwanderings;—we still wandered on; and once again, even Yoomy abated his\r\nsanguine hopes.\r\n\r\nAnd now, we prepared to embark for the extreme south of the land.\r\n\r\nBut we were warned by the people, that in that portion of Vivenza,\r\nwhither we were going, much would be seen repulsive to strangers. Such\r\nthings, however, indulgent visitors overlooked. For themselves, they\r\nwere well aware of those evils. Northern Vivenza had done all it could\r\nto assuage them; but in vain; the inhabitants of those southern valleys\r\nwere a fiery, and intractable race; heeding neither expostulations, nor\r\nentreaties. They were wedded to their ways. Nay, they swore, that if\r\nthe northern tribes persisted in intermeddlings, they would dissolve\r\nthe common alliance, and establish a distinct confederacy among\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nOur coasting voyage at an end, our keels grated the beach among many\r\nprostrate palms, decaying, and washed by the billows. Though part and\r\nparcel of the shore we had left, this region seemed another land. Fewer\r\nthriving thingswere seen; fewer cheerful sounds were heard.\r\n\r\n“Here labor has lost his laugh!” cried Yoomy.\r\n\r\nIt was a great plain where we landed; and there, under a burning sun,\r\nhundreds of collared men were toiling in trenches, filled with the taro\r\nplant; a root most flourishing in that soil. Standing grimly over\r\nthese, were men unlike them; armed with long thongs, which descended\r\nupon the toilers, and made wounds. Blood and sweat mixed; and in great\r\ndrops, fell.\r\n\r\n“Who eat these plants thus nourished?” cried Yoomy. “Are these men?”\r\nasked Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n“Which mean you?” said Mohi.\r\n\r\nHeeding him not, Babbalanja advanced toward the fore-most of those with\r\nthe thongs,—one Nulli: a cadaverous, ghost-like man; with a low ridge\r\nof forehead; hair, steel-gray; and wondrous eyes;—bright, nimble, as\r\nthe twin Corposant balls, playing about the ends of ships’ royal-yards\r\nin gales.\r\n\r\nThe sun passed under a cloud; and Nulli, darting at Babbalanja those\r\nwondrous eyes, there fell upon him a baleful glare.\r\n\r\n“Have they souls?” he asked, pointing to the serfs.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Nulli, “their ancestors may have had; but their souls have\r\nbeen bred out of their descendants; as the instinct of scent is killed\r\nin pointers.”\r\n\r\nApproaching one of the serfs, Media took him by the hand, and felt of\r\nit long; and looked into his eyes; and placed his ear to his side; and\r\nexclaimed, “Surely this being has flesh that is warm; he has Oro in his\r\neye; and a heart in him that beats. I swear he is a man.”\r\n\r\n“Is this our lord the king?” cried Mohi, starting.\r\n\r\n“What art thou,” said Babbalanja to the serf. “Dost ever feel in thee a\r\nsense of right and wrong? Art ever glad or sad?—They tell us thou art\r\nnot a man:—speak, then, for thyself; say, whether thou beliest thy\r\nMaker.”\r\n\r\n“Speak not of my Maker to me. Under the lash, I believe my masters, and\r\naccount myself a brute; but in my dreams, bethink myself an angel. But\r\nI am bond; and my little ones;—their mother’s milk is gall.”\r\n\r\n“Just Oro!” cried Yoomy, “do no thunders roll,—no lightnings flash in\r\nthis accursed land!”\r\n\r\n“Asylum for all Mardi’s thralls!” cried Media.\r\n\r\n“Incendiaries!” cried he with the wondrous eyes, “come ye, firebrands,\r\nto light the flame of revolt? Know ye not, that here are many serfs,\r\nwho, incited to obtain their liberty, might wreak some dreadful\r\nvengeance? Avaunt, thou king! _thou_ horrified at this? Go back to Odo,\r\nand right her wrongs! These serfs are happier than thine; though thine,\r\nno collars wear; more happy as they are, than if free. Are they not\r\nfed, clothed, and cared for? Thy serfs pine for food: never yet did\r\nthese; who have no thoughts, no cares.”\r\n\r\n“Thoughts and cares are life, and liberty, and immortality!” cried\r\nBabbalanja; “and are their souls, then, blown out as candles?”\r\n\r\n“Ranter! they are content,” cried Nulli. “They shed no tears.”\r\n\r\n“Frost never weeps,” said Babbalanja; “and tears are frozen in those\r\nfrigid eyes.”\r\n\r\n“Oh fettered sons of fettered mothers, conceived and born in manacles,”\r\ncried Yoomy; “dragging them through life; and falling with them,\r\nclanking in the grave:—oh, beings as ourselves, how my stiff arm\r\nshivers to avenge you! ’Twere absolution for the matricide, to strike\r\none rivet from your chains. My heart outswells its home!”\r\n\r\n“Oro! Art thou?” cried Babbalanja; “and doth this thing exist? It\r\nshakes my little faith.” Then, turning upon Nulli, “How can ye abide to\r\nsway this curs’d dominion?”\r\n\r\n“Peace, fanatic! Who else may till unwholesome fields, but these? And\r\nas these beings are, so shall they remain; ’tis right and righteous!\r\nMaramma champions it!—I swear it! The first blow struck for them,\r\ndissolves the union of Vivenza’s vales. The northern tribes well know\r\nit; and know me.”\r\n\r\nSaid Media, “Yet if—”\r\n\r\n“No more! another word, and, king as thou art, thou shalt be\r\ndungeoned:—here, there is such a law; thou art not among the northern\r\ntribes.”\r\n\r\n“And this is freedom!” murmured Media; “when heaven’s own voice is\r\nthrottled. And were these serfs to rise, and fight for it; like dogs,\r\nthey would be hunted down by her pretended sons!”\r\n\r\n“Pray, heaven!” cried Yoomy, “they may yet find a way to loose their\r\nbonds without one drop of blood. But hear me, Oro! were there no other\r\nway, and should their masters not relent, all honest hearts must cheer\r\nthis tribe of Hamo on; though they cut their chains with blades thrice\r\nedged, and gory to the haft! ’Tis right to fight for freedom, whoever\r\nbe the thrall.”\r\n\r\n“These South savannahs may yet prove battle-fields,” said Mohi;\r\ngloomily, as we retraced our steps.\r\n\r\n“Be it,” said Yoomy. “Oro will van the right.”\r\n\r\n“Not always has it proved so,” said Babbalanja. “Oft-times, the right\r\nfights single-handed against the world; and Oro champions none. In all\r\nthings, man’s own battles, man himself must fight. Yoomy: so far as\r\nfeeling goes, your sympathies are not more hot than mine; but for these\r\nserfs you would cross spears; yet, I would not. Better present woes for\r\nsome, than future woes for all.”\r\n\r\n“No need to fight,” cried Yoomy, “to liberate that tribe of Hamo\r\ninstantly; a way may be found, and no irretrievable evil ensue.”\r\n\r\n“Point it out, and be blessed, Yoomy.”\r\n\r\n“That is for Vivenza; but the head is dull, where the heart is cold.”\r\n\r\n“My lord,” said Babbalanja, “you have startled us by your kingly\r\nsympathy for suffering; say thou, then, in what wise manner it shall be\r\nrelieved.”\r\n\r\n“That is for Vivenza,” said Media.\r\n\r\n“Mohi, you are old: speak thou.”\r\n\r\n“Let Vivenza speak,” said Mohi.\r\n\r\n“Thus then we all agree; and weeping all but echo hard-hearted Nulli.\r\nTears are not swords and wrongs seem almost natural as rights. For the\r\nrighteous to suppress an evil, is sometimes harder than for others to\r\nuphold it. Humanity cries out against this vast enormity:— not one man\r\nknows a prudent remedy. Blame not, then, the North; and wisely judge\r\nthe South. Ere, as a nation, they became responsible, this thing was\r\nplanted in their midst. Such roots strike deep. Place to-day those\r\nserfs in Dominora; and with them, all Vivenza’s Past;— and serfs, for\r\nmany years, in Dominora, they would be. Easy is it to stand afar and\r\nrail. All men are censors who have lungs. We can say, the stars are\r\nwrongly marshaled. Blind men say the sun is blind. A thousand muscles\r\nwag our tongues; though our tongues were housed, that they might have a\r\nhome. Whose is free from crime, let him cross himself—but hold his\r\ncross upon his lips. That he is not bad, is not of him. Potters’ clay\r\nand wax are all, molded by hands invisible. The soil decides the man.\r\nAnd, ere birth, man wills not to be born here or there. These southern\r\ntribes have grown up with this thing; bond-women were their nurses, and\r\nbondmen serve them still. Nor are all their serfs such wretches as\r\nthose we saw. Some seem happy: yet not as men. Unmanned, they know not\r\nwhat they are. And though, of all the south, Nulli must stand almost\r\nalone in his insensate creed; yet, to all wrong-doers, custom backs the\r\nsense of wrong. And if to every Mardian, conscience be the awarder of\r\nits own doom; then, of these tribes, many shall be found exempted from\r\nthe least penalty of this sin. But sin it is, no less;—a blot, foul as\r\nthe crater-pool of hell; it puts out the sun at noon; it parches all\r\nfertility; and, conscience or no conscience—ere he die—let every master\r\nwho wrenches bond-babe from mother, that the nipple tear; unwreathes\r\nthe arms of sisters; or cuts the holy unity in twain; till apart fall\r\nman and wife, like one bleeding body cleft:—let that master thrice\r\nshrive his soul; take every sacrament; on his bended knees give up the\r\nghost;—yet shall he die despairing; and live again, to die forever\r\ndamned. The future is all hieroglyphics. Who may read? But, methinks\r\nthe great laggard Time must now march up apace, and somehow befriend\r\nthese thralls. It can not be, that misery is perpetually entailed;\r\nthough, in a land proscribing primogeniture, the first-born and last of\r\nHamo’s tribe must still succeed to all their sires’ wrongs. Yes.\r\nTime—all-healing Time—Time, great Philanthropist!—Time must befriend\r\nthese thralls!”\r\n\r\n“Oro grant it!” cried Yoomy “and let Mardi say, amen!”\r\n\r\n“Amen! amen! amen!” cried echoes echoing echoes.\r\n\r\nWe traversed many of these southern vales; but as in Dominora,—so,\r\nthroughout Vivenza, North and South,—Yillah harbored not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\nThey Converse Of The Mollusca, Kings, Toad-Stools And Other Matters\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce more embarking, we gained Vivenza’s southwestern side and there,\r\nbeheld vast swarms of laborers discharging from canoes, great loads of\r\nearth; which they tossed upon the beach.\r\n\r\n“It is true, then,” said Media “that these freemen are engaged in\r\ndigging down other lands, and adding them to their own, piece-meal. And\r\nthis, they call extending their dominions agriculturally, and\r\npeaceably.”\r\n\r\n“My lord, they pay a price for every canoe-load,” said Mohi.\r\n\r\n“Ay, old man, holding the spear in one hand, and striking the bargain\r\nwith the other.”\r\n\r\n“Yet charge it not upon all Vivenza,” said Babbalanja. “Some of her\r\ntribes are hostile to these things: and when their countryman fight for\r\nland, are only warlike in opposing war.”\r\n\r\n“And therein, Babbalanja, is involved one of those anomalies in the\r\ncondition of Vivenza,” said Media, “which I can hardly comprehend. How\r\ncomes it, that with so Many things to divide them, the valley-tribes\r\nstill keep their mystic league intact?”\r\n\r\n“All plain, it is because the model, whence they derive their union, is\r\none of nature’s planning. My lord, have you ever observed the\r\nmysterious federation subsisting among the molluscs of the Tunicata\r\norder,—in other words, a species of cuttle-fish, abounding at the\r\nbottom of the lagoon?”\r\n\r\n“Yes: in clear weather about the reefs, I have beheld them time and\r\nagain: but never with an eye to their political condition.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! my lord king, we should not cut off the nervous communication\r\nbetween our eyes, and our cerebellums.”\r\n\r\n“What were you about to say concerning the Tunicata order of mollusca,\r\nsir philosopher?”\r\n\r\n“My very honorable lord, I hurry to conclude. They live in a compound\r\nstructure; but though connected by membranous canals, freely\r\ncommunicating throughout the league—each member has a heart and stomach\r\nof its own; provides and digests its own dinners; and grins and bears\r\nits own gripes, without imparting the same to its neighbors. But if a\r\nprowling shark touches one member, it ruffles all. Precisely thus now\r\nwith Vivenza. In that confederacy, there are as many consciences as\r\ntribes; hence, if one member on its own behalf, assumes aught\r\nafterwards repudiated, the sin rests on itself alone; is not\r\nparticipated.”\r\n\r\n“A very subtle explanation, Babbalanja. You must allude, then, to those\r\nrecreant tribes; which, while in their own eyes presenting a sublime\r\nmoral spectacle to Mardi,—in King Bello’s, do but present a hopeless\r\nexample of bad debts. And these, the tribes that boast of boundless\r\nwealth.”\r\n\r\n“Most true, my lord. But Bello errs, when for this thing, he\r\nstigmatizes all Vivenza, as a unity.”\r\n\r\n“Babbalanja, you yourself are made up of members:—then, if you be sick\r\nof a lumbago,—’tis not _you_ that are unwell; but your spine.”\r\n\r\n“As you will, my lord. I have said. But to speak no more on that head\r\n—what sort of a sensation, think you, life is to such creatures as\r\nthose mollusca?”\r\n\r\n“Answer your own question, Babbalanja.”\r\n\r\n“I will; but first tell me what sort of a sensation life is to you,\r\nyourself, my lord.”\r\n\r\n“Pray answer that along with the other, Azzageddi.”\r\n\r\n“Directly; but tell me, if you will, my lord, what sort of a sensation\r\nlife is to a toad-stool.”\r\n\r\n“Pray, Babbalanja put all three questions together; and then, do what\r\nyou have often done before, pronounce yourself a lunatic.”\r\n\r\n“My lord, I beseech you, remind me not of that fact so often. It is\r\ntrue, but annoying. Nor will any wise man call another a fool.”\r\n\r\n“Do you take me for a mere man, then, Babbalanja, that you talk to me\r\nthus?”\r\n\r\n“My demi-divine lord and master, I was deeply concerned at your\r\nindisposition last night:—may a loving subject inquire, whether his\r\nprince is completely recovered from the effect of those guavas?”\r\n\r\n“Have a care, Azzageddi; you are far too courteous, to be civil. But\r\nproceed.”\r\n\r\n“I obey. In kings, mollusca, and toad-stools, life is one thing and the\r\nsame. The Philosopher Dumdi pronounces it a certain febral vibration of\r\norganic parts, operating upon the vis inertia of unorganized matter.\r\nBut Bardianna says nay. Hear him. ‘Who put together this marvelous\r\nmechanism of mine; and wound it up, to go for three score years and\r\nten; when it runs out, and strikes Time’s hours no more? And what is\r\nit, that daily and hourly renews, and by a miracle, creates in me my\r\nflesh and my blood? What keeps up the perpetual telegraphic\r\ncommunication between my outpost toes and digits, and that domed\r\ngrandee up aloft, my brain?—It is not I; nor you; nor he; nor it. No;\r\nwhen I place my hand to that king muscle my heart, I am appalled. I\r\nfeel the great God himself at work in me. Oro is life.’”\r\n\r\n“And what is death?” demanded Media.\r\n\r\n“Death, my lord!—it is the deadest of all things.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\nWherein, That Gallant Gentleman And Demi-God, King Media, Scepter In\r\nHand, Throws Himself Into The Breach\r\n\r\n\r\nSailing south from Vivenza, not far from its coast, we passed a cluster\r\nof islets, green as new fledged grass; and like the mouths of floating\r\ncornucopias, their margins brimmed over upon the brine with flowers. On\r\nsome, grew stately roses; on others stood twin-pillars; across others,\r\ntri-hued rainbows rested.\r\n\r\nCried Babbalanja, pointing to the last, “Franko’s pledge of peace! with\r\nthat, she loudly vaunts she’ll span the reef!—Strike out all hues but\r\nred,—and the token’s nearer truth.”\r\n\r\nAll these isles were prolific gardens; where King Bello, and the\r\nPrinces of Porpheero grew their most delicious fruits,—nectarines and\r\ngrapes.\r\n\r\nBut, though hard by, Vivenza owned no garden here; yet longed and\r\nlusted; and her hottest tribes oft roundly swore, to root up all roses\r\nthe half-reef over; pull down all pillars; and dissolve all rainbows.\r\n“Mardi’s half is ours;” said they. Stand back invaders! Full of vanity;\r\nand mirroring themselves in the future; they deemed all reflected\r\nthere, their own.\r\n\r\n’Twas now high noon.\r\n\r\n“Methinks the sun grows hot,” said Media, retreating deeper under the\r\ncanopy. “Ho! Vee-Vee; have you no cooling beverage? none of that golden\r\nwine distilled from torrid grapes, and then sent northward to be\r\ncellared in an iceberg? That wine was placed among our stores. Search,\r\nsearch the crypt, little Vee-Vee! Ha, I see it!—that yellow\r\ngourd!—Come: drag it forth, my boy. Let’s have the amber cups: so: pass\r\nthem round;—fill all! Taji! my demi-god, up heart! Old Mohi, my babe,\r\nmay you live ten thousand centuries! Ah! this way you mortals have of\r\ndying out at three score years and ten, is but a craven habit. So,\r\nBabbalanja! may you never die. Yoomy! my sweet poet, may you live to\r\nsing to me in Paradise. Ha, ha! would that we floated in this glorious\r\nstuff, instead of this pestilent brine.—Hark ye! were I to make a Mardi\r\nnow, I’d have every continent a huge haunch of venison; every ocean a\r\nwine-vat! I’d stock every cavern with choice old spirits, and make\r\nthree surplus suns to ripen the grapes all the year round. Let’s drink\r\nto that!—Brimmers! So: may the next Mardi that’s made, be one entire\r\ngrape; and mine the squeezing!”\r\n\r\n“Look, look! my lord,” cried Yoomy, “what a glorious shore we pass.”\r\n\r\nSallying out into the high golden noon, with golden-beaming goblets\r\nsuspended, we gazed.\r\n\r\n“This must be Kolumbo of the south,” said Mohi.\r\n\r\nIt was a long, hazy reach of land; piled up in terraces, traced here\r\nand there with rushing streams, that worked up gold dust alluvian, and\r\nseemed to flash over pebbled diamonds. Heliotropes, sun-flowers,\r\nmarigolds gemmed, or starred the violet meads, and vassal-like, still\r\nsunward bowed their heads. The rocks were pierced with grottoes,\r\nblazing with crystals, many-tinted.\r\n\r\nIt was a land of mints and mines; its east a ruby; west a topaz.\r\nInland, the woodlands stretched an ocean, bottomless with foliage; its\r\ngreen surges bursting through cable-vines; like Xerxes’ brittle chains\r\nwhich vainly sought to bind the Hellespont. Hence flowed a tide of\r\nforest sounds; of parrots, paroquets, macaws; blent with the howl of\r\njaguars, hissing of anacondas, chattering of apes, and herons\r\nscreaming.\r\n\r\nOut from those depths up rose a stream.\r\n\r\nThe land lay basking in the world’s round torrid brisket, hot with\r\nsolar fire.\r\n\r\n“No need here to land,” cried Yoomy, “Yillah lurks not here.”\r\n\r\n“Heat breeds life, and sloth, and rage,” said Babbalanja. “Here live\r\nbastard tribes and mongrel nations; wrangling and murdering to prove\r\ntheir freedom.—Refill, my lord.”\r\n\r\n“Methinks, Babbalanja, you savor of the mysterious parchment, in\r\nVivenza read:—Ha? Yes, philosopher, these are the men, who toppled\r\ncastles to make way for hovels; these, they who fought for freedom, but\r\nfind it despotism to rule themselves. These, Babbalanja, are of the\r\nrace, to whom a tyrant would prove a blessing.” So saying he drained\r\nhis cup.\r\n\r\n“My lord, that last sentiment decides the authorship of the scroll.\r\nBut, with deference, tyrants seldom can prove blessings; inasmuch as\r\nevil seldom eventuates in good. Yet will these people soon have a\r\ntyrant over them, if long they cleave to war. Of many javelins, one\r\nmust prove a scepter; of many helmets, one a crown. It is but in the\r\nwearing.—Refill, my lord.”\r\n\r\n“Fools, fools!” cried Media, “these tribes hate us kings; yet know not,\r\nthat Peace is War against all kings. We seldom are undone by spears,\r\nwhich are our ministers.—This wine is strong.”\r\n\r\n“Ha, now’s the time! In his cups learn king-craft from a king. Ay, ay,\r\nmy lord, your royal order will endure, so long as men will fight. Break\r\nthe spears, and free the nations. Kings reap the harvests that wave on\r\nbattle-fields. And oft you kings do snatch the aloe-flower, whose slow\r\nblossoming mankind watches for a hundred years.—Say on, my lord.”\r\n\r\n“All this I know; and, therefore, rest content. My children’s children\r\nwill be kings; though, haply, called by other titles. Mardi grows\r\nfastidious in names: we royalties will humor it. The steers would burst\r\ntheir yokes, but have not hands. The whole herd rears and plunges, but\r\nsoon will bow again: the old, old way!”\r\n\r\n“Yet, in Porpheero, strong scepters have been wrested from anointed\r\nhands. Mankind seems in arms.”\r\n\r\n“Let them arm on. They hate us:—good;—they always have; yet still we’ve\r\nreigned, son after sire. Sometimes they slay us, Babbalanja; pour out\r\nour marrow, as I this wine; but they spill no kinless blood. ’Twas\r\njustly held of old, that but to touch a monarch, was to strike at\r\nOro.—Truth. The palest vengeance is a royal ghost; and regicides but\r\nfather slaves. Thrones, not scepters, have been broken. Mohi, what of\r\nthe past? Has it not ever proved so?”\r\n\r\n“Pardon, my lord; the times seem changed. ’Tis held, that demi-gods no\r\nmore rule by right divine. In Vivenza’s land, they swear the last kings\r\nnow reign in Mardi.”\r\n\r\n“Is the last day at hand, old man? Mohi, your beard is gray; but,\r\nYoomy, listen. When you die, look around; mark then if any mighty\r\nchange be seen. Old kingdoms may be on the wane; but new dynasties\r\nadvance. Though revolutions rise to high spring-tide, monarchs will\r\nstill drown hard;—monarchs survived the flood!”\r\n\r\n“Are all our dreams, then, vain?” sighed Yoomy. “Is this no dawn of day\r\nthat streaks the crimson East! Naught but the false and flickering\r\nlights which sometimes mock Aurora in the north! Ah, man, my brother!\r\nhave all martyrs for thee bled in vain; in vain we poets sang, and\r\nprophets spoken? Nay, nay; great Mardi, helmed and mailed, strikes at\r\nOppression’s shield, and challenges to battle! Oro will defend the\r\nright, and royal crests must roll.”\r\n\r\n“Thus, Yoomy, ages since, you mortal poets sang; but the world may not\r\nbe moved from out the orbit in which first it rolled. On the map that\r\ncharts the spheres, Mardi is marked ‘the world of kings.’ Round\r\ncenturies on centuries have wheeled by:—has all this been its nonage?\r\nNow, when the rocks grow gray, does man first sprout his beard? Or, is\r\nyour golden time, your equinoctial year, at hand, that your race fast\r\npresses toward perfection; and every hand grasps at a scepter, that\r\nkings may be no more?”\r\n\r\n“But free Vivenza! Is she not the star, that must, ere long, lead up\r\nthe constellations, though now unrisen? No kings are in Vivenza; yet,\r\nspite her thralls, in that land seems more of good than elsewhere. Our\r\nhopes are not wild dreams: Vivenza cheers our hearts. She is a rainbow\r\nto the isles!”\r\n\r\n“Ay, truth it is, that in Vivenza they have prospered. But thence it\r\ncomes not, that all men may be as they. Are all men of one heart and\r\nbrain; one bone and sinew? Are all nations sprung of Dominora’s loins?\r\nOr, has Vivenza yet proved her creed? Yoomy! the years that prove a\r\nman, prove not a nation. But two kings’-reigns have passed since\r\nVivenza was a monarch’s. Her climacteric is not come; hers is not yet a\r\nnation’s manhood even; though now in childhood, she anticipates her\r\nyouth, and lusts for empire like any czar. Yoomy! judge not yet. Time\r\nhath tales to tell. Many books, and many long, long chapters, are\r\nwanting to Vivenza’s history; and whet history but is full of blood?”\r\n\r\n“There stop, my lord,” said Babbalanja, “nor aught predict. Fate laughs\r\nat prophets; and of all birds, the raven is a liar!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI.\r\nThey Round The Stormy Cape Of Capes\r\n\r\n\r\nLong leagues, for weary days, we voyaged along that coast, till we came\r\nto regions where we multiplied our mantles.\r\n\r\nThe sky grew overcast. Each a night, black storm-clouds swept the\r\nwintry sea; and like Sahara caravans, which leave their sandy wakes—\r\nso, thick and fleet, slanted the scud behind. Through all this rack and\r\nmist, ten thousand foam-flaked dromedary-humps uprose.\r\n\r\nDeep among those panting, moaning fugitives, the three canoes raced on.\r\n\r\nAnd now, the air grew nipping cold. The clouds shed off their fleeces;\r\na snow-hillock, each canoe; our beards, white-frosted.\r\n\r\nAnd so, as seated in our shrouds, we sailed in among great mountain\r\npasses of ice-isles; from icy ledges scaring shivering seals, and white\r\nbears, musical with icicles, jingling from their shaggy ermine.\r\n\r\nFar and near, in towering ridges, stretched the glassy Andes; with\r\ntheir own frost, shuddering through all their domes and pinnacles.\r\nIce-splinters rattled down the cliffs, and seethed into the sea.\r\n\r\nBroad away, in amphitheaters undermined by currents, whole cities of\r\nice-towers, in crashes, toward one center, fell.—In their earthquakes,\r\nLisbon and Lima never saw the like. Churned and broken in the boiling\r\ntide, they swept off amain;—over and over rolling; like porpoises to\r\nvessels tranced in calms, bringing down the gale.\r\n\r\nAt last, rounding an antlered headland, that seemed a moose at bay—ere\r\nlong, we launched upon blue lake-like waters, serene as Windermere, or\r\nHoricon. Thus, from the boisterous storms of youth, we glide upon\r\nsenility.\r\n\r\nBut as we northward voyaged, another aspect wore the sea.\r\n\r\nIn far-off, endless vistas, colonnades of water-spouts were seen: all\r\nheaven’s dome upholding on their shafts: and bright forms gliding up\r\nand down within. So at Luz, in his strange vision, Jacob saw the\r\nangels.\r\n\r\nA boundless cave of stalactites, it seemed; the cloud-born vapors\r\ndownward spiraling, till they met the whirlpool-column from the sea;\r\nthen, uniting, over the waters stalked, like ghosts of gods. Or midway\r\nsundered—down, sullen, sunk the watery half; and far up into heaven,\r\nwas drawn the vapory. As, at death, we mortals part in twain; our\r\nearthy half still here abiding; but our spirits flying whence they\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nIn good time, we gained the thither side of great Kolumbo of the South;\r\nand sailing on, long waited for the day; and wondered at the darkness.\r\n\r\n“What steadfast clouds!” cried Yoomy, “yonder! far aloft: that ridge,\r\nwith many points; it fades below, but shows a faint white crest.”\r\n\r\n“Not clouds, but mountains,” said Babbalanja, “the vast spine, that\r\ntraverses Kolumbo; spurring off in ribs, that nestle loamy valleys,\r\nveined with silver streams, and silver ores.”\r\n\r\nIt was a long, embattled line of pinnacles. And high posted in the\r\nEast, those thousand bucklered peaks stood forth, and breasted back the\r\nDawn. Before their purple bastions bold, Aurora long arrayed her\r\nspears, and clashed her golden shells. The summons dies away. But now,\r\nher lancers charge the steep, and gain its crest a-glow;—their\r\nglittering spears and blazoned shields triumphant in the morn.\r\n\r\nBut ere that sight, we glided on for hours in twilight; when, on those\r\nmountains’ farther side, the hunters must have been abroad, morning-\r\nglories all astir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII.\r\nThey Encounter Gold-Hunters\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, northward coasting along Kolumbo’s Western shore, whence came the\r\nsame wild forest-sounds, as from the Eastern; and where we landed not,\r\nto seek among those wrangling tribes;—after many, many days, we spied\r\nprow after prow, before the wind all northward bound: sails\r\nwide-spread, and paddles plying: scaring the fish from before them.\r\n\r\nTheir inmates answered not our earnest hail.\r\n\r\nBut as they sped, with frantic glee, in one long chorus thus they\r\nsang:—\r\n\r\n                        We rovers bold,\r\n                    To the land of Gold,\r\n                Over bowling billows are gliding:\r\n                    Eager to toil,\r\n                    For the golden spoil,\r\n                And every hardship biding.\r\n                        See! See!\r\n                Before our prows’ resistless dashes,\r\n                The gold-fish fly in golden flashes!\r\n                    ’Neath a sun of gold,\r\n                    We rovers bold,\r\n                On the golden land are gaining;\r\n                And every night,\r\n                We steer aright,\r\n            By golden stars unwaning!\r\n        All fires burn a golden glare:\r\n        No locks so bright as golden hair!\r\n    All orange groves have golden gushings:\r\n    All mornings dawn with golden flushings!\r\nIn a shower of gold, say fables old,\r\nA maiden was won by the god of gold!\r\n    In golden goblets wine is beaming:\r\n    On golden couches kings are dreaming!\r\n    The Golden Rule dries many tears!\r\n    The Golden Number rules the spheres!\r\nGold, gold it is, that sways the nations:\r\nGold! gold! the center of all rotations!\r\n    On golden axles worlds are turning:\r\n    With phosphorescence seas are burning!\r\n    All fire-flies flame with golden gleamings:\r\n    Gold-hunters’ hearts with golden dreamings!\r\n    With golden arrows kings are slain:\r\n    With gold we’ll buy a freeman’s name!\r\nIn toilsome trades, for scanty earnings,\r\nAt home we’ve slaved, with stifled yearnings:\r\nNo light! no hope! Oh, heavy woe!\r\nWhen nights fled fast, and days dragged slow.\r\n            But joyful now, with eager eye,\r\n            Fast to the Promised Land we fly:\r\n                Where in deep mines,\r\n                The treasure shines;\r\n            Or down in beds of golden streams,\r\n            The gold-flakes glance in golden gleams!\r\n                How we long to sift,\r\n                That yellow drift!\r\n            Rivers! Rivers! cease your going!\r\n                Sand-bars! rise, and stay the tide!\r\n            ’Till we’ve gained the golden flowing;\r\n                And in the golden haven ride!\r\n\r\n\r\n“Quick, quick, my lord,” cried Yoomy, “let us follow them; and from the\r\ngolden waters where she lies, our Yillah may emerge.”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” said Babbalanja,—“no Yillah there!—from yonder promised-land,\r\nfewer seekers will return, than go. Under a gilded guise, happiness is\r\nstill their instinctive aim. But vain, Yoomy, to snatch at Happiness.\r\nOf that we may not pluck and eat. It is the fruit of our own toilsome\r\nplanting; slow it grows, nourished by many teats, and all our earnest\r\ntendings. Yet ere it ripen, frosts may nip;—and then, we plant again;\r\nand yet again. Deep, Yoomy, deep, true treasure lies; deeper than all\r\nMardi’s gold, rooted to Mardi’s axis. But unlike gold, it lurks in\r\nevery soil,—all Mardi over. With golden pills and potions is sickness\r\nwarded off?—the shrunken veins of age, dilated with new wine of youth?\r\nWill gold the heart-ache cure? turn toward us hearts estranged? will\r\ngold, on solid centers empires fix? ’Tis toil world-wasted to toil in\r\nmines. Were all the isles gold globes, set in a quicksilver sea, all\r\nMardi were then a desert. Gold is the only poverty; of all glittering\r\nills the direst. And that man might not impoverish himself thereby, Oro\r\nhath hidden it, with all other banes,—saltpeter and explosives, deep in\r\nmountain bowels, and river-beds. But man still will mine for it; and\r\nmining, dig his doom.— Yoomy, Yoomy!—she we seek, lurks not in the\r\nGolden Hills!”\r\n\r\n“Lo, a vision!” cried Yoomy, his hands wildly passed across his eyes.\r\n“A vast and silent bay, belted by silent villages:—gaunt dogs howling\r\nover grassy thresholds at stark corpses of old age and infancy; gray\r\nhairs mingling with sweet flaxen curls; fields, with turned furrows,\r\nchoked with briers; arbor-floors strown over with hatchet-helves,\r\nrotting in the iron; a thousand paths, marked with foot-prints, all\r\ninland leading, none villageward; and strown with traces, as of a\r\nflying host. On: over forest—hill, and dale—and lo! the golden region!\r\nAfter the glittering spoil, by strange river-margins, and beneath\r\nimpending cliffs, thousands delve in quicksands; and, sudden, sink in\r\ngraves of their own making: with gold dust mingling their own ashes.\r\nStill deeper, in more solid ground, other thousands slave; and pile\r\ntheir earth so high, they gasp for air, and die; their comrades\r\nmounting on them, and delving still, and dying—grave pile on grave!\r\nHere, one haggard hunter murders another in his pit; and murdering,\r\nhimself is murdered by a third. Shrieks and groans! cries and curses!\r\nIt seems a golden Hell! With many camels, a sleek stranger comes—\r\npauses before the shining heaps, and shows _his_ treasures: yams and\r\nbread-fruit. ‘Give, give,’ the famished hunters cry—, ‘a thousand\r\nshekels for a yam!—a prince’s ransom for a meal!—Oh, stranger! on our\r\nknees we worship thee:—take, take our gold; but let us live!’ Yams are\r\nthrown them and they fight. Then he who toiled not, dug not, slaved\r\nnot, straight loads his caravans with gold; regains the beach, and\r\nswift embarks for home. ‘Home! home!’ the hunters cry, with bursting\r\neyes. ‘With this bright gold, could we but join our waiting wives, who\r\nwring their hands on distant shores, all then were well. But we can not\r\nfly; our prows lie rotting on the beach. Ah! home! thou only\r\nhappiness!—better thy silver earnings than all these golden findings.\r\nOh, bitter end to all our hopes—we die in golden graves.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII.\r\nThey Seek Through The Isles Of Palms; And Pass The Isles Of Myrrh\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, our prows we turned due west, across the blue lagoon.\r\n\r\nSoon, no land appeared. Far as the eye could sweep, one azure plain;\r\nall over flaked with foamy fleeces:—a boundless flock upon a boundless\r\nmead!\r\n\r\nAgain, all changed. Like stars in multitude, bright islets multiplied\r\naround. Emerald-green, they dotted shapes fantastic: circles, arcs, and\r\ncrescents;—atolls all, or coral carcanets, begemmed and flashing in the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nBy these we glided, group after group; and through the foliage, spied\r\nsweet forms of maidens, like Eves in Edens ere the Fall, or Proserpines\r\nin Ennas. Artless airs came from the shore; and from the\r\ncenser-swinging roses, a bloom, as if from Hebe’s cheek.\r\n\r\n“Here, at last, we find sweet Yillah!” murmured Yoomy. “Here must she\r\nlurk in innocence! Quick! Let us land and search.”\r\n\r\n“If here,” said Babbalanja, “Yillah will not stay our coming, but fly\r\nbefore us through the groves. Wherever a canoe is beached, see you not\r\nthe palm-trees pine? Not so, where never keel yet smote the strand. In\r\nmercy, let us fly from hence. I know not why, but our breath here, must\r\nprove a blight.”\r\n\r\nThese regions passed, we came to savage islands, where the glittering\r\ncoral seemed bones imbedded, bleaching in the sun. Savage men stood\r\nnaked on the strand, and brandished uncouth clubs, and gnashed their\r\nteeth like boars.\r\n\r\nThe full red moon was rising; and, in long review there passed before\r\nit, phantom shapes of victims, led bound to altars through the groves.\r\nDeath-rattles filled the air. But a cloud descended, and all was gloom.\r\n\r\nAgain blank water spread before us; and after many days, there came a\r\ngentle breeze, fraught with all spicy breathings; cinnamon aromas; and\r\nin the rose-flushed evening air, like glow worms, glowed the islets,\r\nwhere this incense burned.\r\n\r\n“Sweet isles of myrh! oh crimson groves,” cried Yoomy. “Woe, woe’s your\r\nfate! your brightness and your bloom, like musky fire-flies,\r\ndouble-lure to death! On ye, the nations prey like bears that gorge\r\nthemselves with honey.”\r\n\r\nSwan-like, our prows sailed in among these isles; and oft we landed;\r\nbut in vain; and leaving them, we still pursued the setting sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIV.\r\nConcentric, Inward, With Mardi’s Reef, They Leave Their Wake Around The\r\nWorld\r\n\r\n\r\nWest, West! West, West! Whitherward point Hope and prophet-fingers;\r\nwhitherward, at sun-set, kneel all worshipers of fire; whitherward in\r\nmid-ocean, the great whales turn to die; whitherward face all the\r\nMoslem dead in Persia; whitherward lie Heaven and Hell!—West, West!\r\nWhitherward mankind and empires—flocks, caravans, armies, navies;\r\nworlds, suns, and stars all wend!—West, West!—Oh boundless boundary!\r\nEternal goal! Whitherward rush, in thousand worlds, ten thousand\r\nthousand keels! Beacon, by which the universe is steered!—Like the\r\nnorth-star, attracting all needles! Unattainable forever; but forever\r\nleading to great things this side thyself!—Hive of all sunsets!—\r\nGabriel’s pinions may not overtake thee!\r\n\r\nOver balmy waves, still westward sailing! From dawn till eve, the\r\nbright, bright days sped on, chased by the gloomy nights; and, in glory\r\ndying, lent their luster to the starry skies. So, long the radiant\r\ndolphins fly before the sable sharks but seized, and torn in\r\nflames—die, burning:—their last splendor left, in sparkling scales that\r\nfloat along the sea.\r\n\r\nCymbals, drums and psalteries! the air beats like a pulse with music!\r\n—High land! high land! and moving lights, and painted lanterns!—What\r\ngrand shore is this?\r\n\r\n“Reverence we render thee, Old Orienda!” cried Media, with bared brow,\r\n“Original of all empires and emperors!—a crowned king salutes thee!”\r\n\r\n“Mardi’s father-land!” cried Mohi, “grandsire of the nations,—hail!”\r\n\r\n“All hail!” cried Yoomy. “Kings and sages hither coming, should come\r\nlike palmers,—scrip and staff! Oh Orienda! thou wert our East, where\r\nfirst dawned song and science, with Mardi’s primal mornings! But now,\r\nhow changed! the dawn of light become a darkness, which we kindle with\r\nthe gleam of spears! On the world’s ancestral hearth, we spill our\r\nbrothers’ blood!”\r\n\r\n“Herein,” said Babbalanja, “have many distant tribes proved parricidal.\r\nIn times gone by, Luzianna hither sent her prom; Franko, her scores of\r\ncaptains; and the Dykemen, their peddler hosts, with yard-stick spears!\r\nBut thou, oh Bello! lord of the empire lineage! Noah of the moderns.\r\nSire of the long line of nations yet in germ!— thou, Bello, and thy\r\nlocust armies, are the present curse of Orienda. Down ancient streams,\r\nfrom holy plains, in rafts thy murdered float! The pestilence that\r\nthins thy armies here, is bred of corpses, made by thee. Maramma’s\r\npriests, thy pious heralds, loud proclaim that of all pagans, Orienda’s\r\nmost resist the truth!—ay! vain all pious voices, that speak from\r\nclouds of war! The march of conquest through wild provinces, may be the\r\nmarch of Mind; but not the march of Love.”\r\n\r\n“Thou, Bello!” cried Yoomy, “would’st wrest the crook from Alma’s hand,\r\nand place in it a spear. But vain to make a conqueror of him, who put\r\noff the purple when he came to Mardi; and declining gilded miters,\r\nentered the nations meekly on an ass.”\r\n\r\n“Oh curse of commerce!” cried Babbalanja, “that it barters souls for\r\ngold. Bello! with opium, thou wouldst drug this land, and murder it in\r\nsleep!—And what boot thy conquests here? Seed sown by spears but seldom\r\nsprings; and harvests reaped thereby, are poisoned by the sickle’s\r\nedge.”\r\n\r\nYet on, and on we coasted; counting not the days.\r\n\r\n“Oh, folds and flocks of nations! dusky tribes innumerable!” cried\r\nYoomy, “camped on plains and steppes; on thousand mountains, worshiping\r\nthe stars; in thousand valleys, offering up first-fruits, till all the\r\nforests seem in flames;—where, in fire, the widow’s spirit mounts to\r\nmeet her lord!—Oh, Orienda, in thee ’tis vain to seek our Yillah!”\r\n\r\n“How dark as death the night!” said Mohi, shaking the dew from his\r\nbraids, “the Heavens blaze not here with stars, as over Dominora’s\r\nland, and broad Vivenza.”\r\n\r\nOne only constellation was beheld; but every star was brilliant as the\r\none, that promises the morning. That constellation was the Crux-\r\nAustralis,—the badge, and type of Alma.\r\n\r\nAnd now, southwest we steered, till another island vast, was reached;\r\n—Hamora! far trending toward the Antarctic Pole.\r\n\r\nCoasting on by barbarous beaches, where painted men, with spears,\r\ncharged on all attempts to land, at length we rounded a mighty bluff,\r\nlit by a beacon; and heard a bugle call:—Bello’s! hurrying to their\r\nquarters, the World-End’s garrison.\r\n\r\nHere, the sea rolled high, in mountain surges: mid which, we toiled and\r\nstrained, as if ascending cliffs of Caucasus.\r\n\r\nBut not long thus. As when from howling Rhoetian heights, the traveler\r\nspies green Lombardy below, and downward rushes toward that pleasant\r\nplain; so, sloping from long rolling swells, at last we launched upon\r\nthe calm lagoon.\r\n\r\nBut as we northward sailed, once more the storm-trump blew, and\r\ncharger-like, the seas ran mustering to the call; and in battalions\r\ncrouched before a towering rock, far distant from the main. No moon,\r\neclipsed in Egypt’s skies, looked half so lone. But from out that\r\ndarkness, on the loftiest peak, Bello’s standard waved.\r\n\r\n“Oh rifled tomb!” cried Babbalanja. “Wherein lay the Mars and Moloch of\r\nour times, whose constellated crown, was gemmed with diadems. Thou god\r\nof war! who didst seem the devouring Beast of the Apocalypse; casting\r\nso vast a shadow over Mardi, that yet it lingers in old Franko’s vale;\r\nwhere still they start at thy tremendous ghost; and, late, have hailed\r\na phantom, King! Almighty hero-spell! that after the lapse of half a\r\ncentury, can so bewitch all hearts! But one drop of hero-blood will\r\ndeify a fool.\r\n\r\n“Franko! thou wouldst be free; yet thy free homage is to the buried\r\nashes of a King; thy first choice, the exaltation of his race. In\r\nfurious fires, thou burn’st Ludwig’s throne; and over thy new-made\r\nchieftain’s portal, in golden letters print’st—‘The Palace of our\r\nLord!’ In thy New Dispensation, thou cleavest to the exploded Law. And\r\non Freedom’s altar—ah, I fear—still, may slay thy hecatombs. But\r\nFreedom turns away; she is sick with burnt blood of offerings. Other\r\nrituals she loves; and like Oro, unseen herself, would be worshiped\r\nonly by invisibles. Of long drawn cavalcades, pompous processions,\r\nfrenzied banners, mystic music, marching nations, she will none. Oh,\r\nmay thy peaceful Future, Franko, sanctify thy bloody Past. Let not\r\nhistory say; ‘To her old gods, she turned again.’”\r\n\r\nThis rocky islet passed, the sea went down; once more we neared\r\nHamora’s western shore. In the deep darkness, here and there, its\r\nmargin was lit up by foam-white, breaking billows rolled over from\r\nVivenza’s strand, and down from northward Dominora; marking places\r\nwhere light was breaking in, upon the interior’s jungle-gloom.\r\n\r\nIn heavy sighs, the night-winds from shore came over us.\r\n\r\n“Ah, vain to seek sweet Yillah here,” cried Yoomy.—“Poor land! curst of\r\nman, not Oro! how thou faintest for thy children, torn from thy soil,\r\nto till a stranger’s. Vivenza! did these winds not spend their plaints,\r\nere reaching thee, thy every vale would echo them. Oh, tribe of Hamo!\r\nthy cup of woe so brims, that soon it must overflow upon the land which\r\nholds ye thralls. No misery born of crime, but spreads and poisons\r\nwide. Suffering hunteth sin, as the gaunt hound the hare, and tears it\r\nin the greenest brakes.”\r\n\r\nStill on we sailed: and after many tranquil days and nights, a storm\r\ncame down, and burst its thousand bombs. The lightnings forked and\r\nflashed; the waters boiled; our three prows lifted themselves in\r\nsupplication; but the billows smote them as they reared.\r\n\r\nSaid Babbalanja, bowing to the blast: “Thus, oh Vivenza! retribution\r\nworks! Though long delayed, it comes at last—Judgment, with all her\r\nbolts.”\r\n\r\nNow, a current seized us, and like three darts, our keels sped\r\neastward, through a narrow strait, far in, upon a smooth expanse, an\r\ninland ocean, without a throb.\r\n\r\nOn our left, Porpheero’s southwest point, a mighty rock, long tiers of\r\ngalleries within, deck on deck; and flag-staffs, like an admiral’s\r\nmasts: a line-of-battle-ship, all purple stone, and anchored in the\r\nsea. Here Bello’s lion crouched; and, through a thousand port-holes,\r\neyed the world.\r\n\r\nOn our right, Hamora’s northern shore gleamed thick with crescents;\r\nnumerous as the crosses along the opposing strand.\r\n\r\n“How vain to say, that progress is the test of truth, my lord,” said\r\nBabbalanja, “when, after many centuries, those crescents yet unwaning\r\nshine, and count a devotee for every worshiper of yonder crosses. Truth\r\nand Merit have other symbols than success; and in this mortal race, all\r\ncompetitors may enter; and the field is clear for all. Side by side,\r\nLies run with Truths, and fools with wise; but, like geometric lines,\r\nthough they pierce infinity, never may they join.”\r\n\r\nOver that tideless sea we sailed; and landed right, and landed left;\r\nbut the maiden never found; till, at last, we gained the water’s limit;\r\nand inland saw great pointed masses, crowned with halos.\r\n\r\n“Granite continents,” cried Babbalanja, “that seem created like the\r\nplanets, not built with human hands. Lo, Landmarks! upon whose flanks\r\nTime leaves its traces, like old tide-rips of diluvian seas.”\r\n\r\nAs, after wandering round and round some purple dell, deep in a\r\nboundless prairie’s heart, the baffled hunter plunges in; then,\r\ndespairing, turns once more to gain the open plain; even so we seekers\r\nnow curved round our keels; and from that inland sea emerged. The\r\nuniverse again before us; our quest, as wide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV.\r\nSailing On\r\n\r\n\r\nMorning dawned upon the same mild, blue Lagoon as erst; and all the\r\nlands that we had passed, since leaving Piko’s shore of spears, were\r\nfaded from the sight.\r\n\r\nPart and parcel of the Mardian isles, they formed a cluster by\r\nthemselves; like the Pleiades, that shine in Taurus, and are eclipsed\r\nby the red splendor of his fiery eye, and the thick clusterings of the\r\nconstellations round.\r\n\r\nAnd as in Orion, to some old king-astronomer,—say, King of Rigel, or\r\nBetelguese,—this Earth’s four quarters show but four points afar; so,\r\nseem they to terrestrial eyes, that broadly sweep the spheres.\r\n\r\nAnd, as the sun, by influence divine, wheels through the Ecliptic;\r\nthreading Cancer, Leo, Pisces, and Aquarius; so, by some mystic impulse\r\nam I moved, to this fleet progress, through the groups in white-reefed\r\nMardi’s zone.\r\n\r\nOh, reader, list! I’ve chartless voyaged. With compass and the lead, we\r\nhad not found these Mardian Isles. Those who boldly launch, cast off\r\nall cables; and turning from the common breeze, that’s fair for all,\r\nwith their own breath, fill their own sails. Hug the shore, naught new\r\nis seen; and “Land ho!” at last was sung, when a new world was sought.\r\n\r\nThat voyager steered his bark through seas, untracked before; ploughed\r\nhis own path mid jeers; though with a heart that oft was heavy with the\r\nthought, that he might only be too bold, and grope where land was none.\r\n\r\nSo I.\r\n\r\nAnd though essaying but a sportive sail, I was driven from my course,\r\nby a blast resistless; and ill-provided, young, and bowed to the brunt\r\nof things before my prime, still fly before the gale;—hard have I\r\nstriven to keep stout heart.\r\n\r\nAnd if it harder be, than e’er before, to find new climes, when now our\r\nseas have oft been circled by ten thousand prows,—much more the glory!\r\n\r\nBut this new world here sought, is stranger far than his, who stretched\r\nhis vans from Palos. It is the world of mind; wherein the wanderer may\r\ngaze round, with more of wonder than Balboa’s band roving through the\r\ngolden Aztec glades.\r\n\r\nBut fiery yearnings their own phantom-future make, and deem it present.\r\nSo, if after all these fearful, fainting trances, the verdict be, the\r\ngolden haven was not gained;—yet, in bold quest thereof, better to sink\r\nin boundless deeps, than float on vulgar shoals; and give me, ye gods,\r\nan utter wreck, if wreck I do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVI.\r\nA Flight Of Nightingales From Yoomy’s Mouth\r\n\r\n\r\nBy noon, down came a calm.\r\n\r\n“Oh Neeva! good Neeva! kind Neeva! thy sweet breath, dear Neeva!”\r\n\r\nSo from his shark’s-mouth prayed little Vee-Vee to the god of Fair\r\nBreezes. And along they swept; till the three prows neighed to the\r\nblast; and pranced on their path, like steeds of Crusaders.\r\n\r\nNow, that this fine wind had sprung up; the sun riding joyously in the\r\nheavens; and the Lagoon all tossed with white, flying manes; Media\r\ncalled upon Yoomy to ransack his whole assortment of songs:—warlike,\r\namorous, and sentimental,—and regale us with something inspiring for\r\ntoo long the company had been gloomy.\r\n\r\n“Thy best,” he cried.\r\n\r\nThen will I e’en sing you a song, my lord, which is a song-full of\r\nsongs. I composed it long, long since, when Yillah yet bowered in Odo.\r\nEre now, some fragments have been heard. Ah, Taji! in this my lay, live\r\nover again your happy hours. Some joys have thousand lives; can never\r\ndie; for when they droop, sweet memories bind them up.—My lord, I deem\r\nthese verses good; they came bubbling out of me, like live waters from\r\na spring in a silver mine. And by your good leave, my lord, I have much\r\nfaith in inspiration. Whoso sings is a seer.”\r\n\r\n“Tingling is the test,” said Babbalanja, “Yoomy, did you tingle, when\r\nthat song was composing?”\r\n\r\n“All over, Babbalanja.”\r\n\r\n“From sole to crown?”\r\n\r\n“From finger to finger.”\r\n\r\n“My life for it! true poetry, then, my lord! For this self-same\r\ntingling, I say, is the test.”\r\n\r\n“And infused into a song,” cried Yoomy, “it evermore causes it so to\r\nsparkle, vivify, and irradiate, that no son of man can repeat it\r\nwithout tingling himself. This very song of mine may prove what I say.”\r\n\r\n“Modest youth!” sighed Media.\r\n\r\n“Not more so, than sincere,” said Babbalanja. “He who is frank, will\r\noften appear vain, my lord. Having no guile, he speaks as freely of\r\nhimself, as of another; and is just as ready to honor his own merits,\r\neven if imaginary, as to lament over undeniable deficiencies. Besides,\r\nsuch men are prone to moods, which to shallow-minded, unsympathizing\r\nmortals, make their occasional distrust of themselves, appear but as a\r\nphase of self-conceit. Whereas, the man who, in the presence of his\r\nvery friends, parades a barred and bolted front,—that man so highly\r\nprizes his sweet self, that he cares not to profane the shrine he\r\nworships, by throwing open its portals. He is locked up; and Ego is the\r\nkey. Reserve alone is vanity. But all mankind are egotists. The world\r\nrevolves upon an I; and we upon ourselves; for we are our own\r\nworlds:—all other men as strangers, from outlandish, distant climes,\r\ngoing clad in furs. Then, whate’er they be, let us show our worlds; and\r\nnot seek to hide from men, what Oro knows.”\r\n\r\n“Truth, my lord,” said Yoomy, “but all this applies to men in mass; not\r\nspecially, to my poor craft. Of all mortals, we poets are most subject\r\nto contrary moods. Now, heaven over heaven in the skies; now layer\r\nunder layer in the dust. This, the penalty we pay for being what we\r\nare. But Mardi only sees, or thinks it sees, the tokens of our\r\nself-complacency: whereas, all our agonies operate unseen. Poets are\r\nonly seen when they soar.”\r\n\r\n“The song! the song!” cried Media. “Never mind the metaphysics of\r\ngenius.”\r\n\r\nAnd Yoomy, thus clamorously invoked, hemmed thrice, tuning his voice\r\nfor the air.\r\n\r\nBut here, be it said, that the minstrel was miraculously gifted with\r\nthree voices; and, upon occasions, like a mocking-bird, was a concert\r\nof sweet sounds in himself. Had kind friends died, and bequeathed him\r\ntheir voices? But hark! in a low, mild tenor, he begins:—\r\n\r\n        Half-railed above the hills, yet rosy bright,\r\n    Stands fresh, and fair, the meek and blushing morn!\r\nSo Yillah looks! her pensive eyes the stars,\r\n    That mildly beam from out her cheek’s young dawn!\r\n\r\n                But the still meek Dawn,\r\n                Is not aye the form\r\n                Of Yillah nor Morn!\r\n                    Soon rises the sun,\r\n                    Day’s race to run:\r\n                His rays abroad,\r\n                Flash each a sword,—\r\n                    And merrily forth they flare!\r\n                    Sun-music in the air!\r\n                So Yillah now rises and flashes!\r\n                Rays shooting from ont her long lashes,—\r\n                    Sun-music in the air!\r\n\r\n                    Her laugh! How it bounds!\r\n                    Bright cascade of sounds!\r\n                Peal after peal, and ringing afar,—\r\n                Ringing of waters, that silvery jar,\r\n                    From basin to basin fast falling!\r\n                    Fast falling, and shining, and streaming:—\r\n                Yillah’s bosom, the soft, heaving lake,\r\n                Where her laughs at last dimple, and flake!\r\n\r\nOh beautiful Yillah! Thy step so free!—\r\n    Fast fly the sea-ripples,\r\nRevealing their dimples,\r\n    When forth, thou hi’st to the frolicsome sea!\r\n\r\n                 All the stars laugh,\r\n                     When upward she looks:\r\n                All the trees chat\r\n                     In their woody nooks:\r\n                All the brooks sing;\r\n                All the caves ring;\r\n                All the buds blossom;\r\n                    All the boughs bound;\r\n                All the birds carol;\r\n                    And leaves turn round,\r\n                    Where Yillah looks!\r\n\r\nLight wells from her soul’s deep sun\r\nCausing many toward her to run!\r\nVines to climb, and flowers to spring;\r\nAnd youths their love by hundreds bring!\r\n\r\n\r\n“Proceed, gentle Yoomy,” said Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n“The meaning,” said Mohi.\r\n\r\n“The sequel,” said Media.\r\n\r\n“My lord, I have ceased in the middle; the end is not yet.”\r\n\r\n“Mysticism!” cried Babbalanja. “What, minstrel; must nothing ultimate\r\ncome of all that melody? no final and inexhaustible meaning? nothing\r\nthat strikes down into the soul’s depths; till, intent upon itself, it\r\npierces in upon its own essence, and is resolved into its pervading\r\noriginal; becoming a thing constituent of the all embracing deific;\r\nwhereby we mortals become part and parcel of the gods; our souls to\r\nthem as thoughts; and we privy to all things occult, ineffable, and\r\nsublime? Then, Yoomy, is thy song nothing worth. Alla Mollolla saith,\r\n‘That is no true, vital breath, which leaves no moisture behind.’ I\r\nmistrust thee, minstrel! that thou hast not yet been impregnated by the\r\narcane mysteries; that thou dost not sufficiently ponder on the Adyta,\r\nthe Monads, and the Hyparxes; the Dianoias, the Unical Hypostases, the\r\nGnostic powers of the Psychical Essence, and the Supermundane and\r\nPleromatic Triads; to say nothing of the Abstract Noumenons.”\r\n\r\n“Oro forbid!” cried Yoomy; “the very sound of thy words affrights me.”\r\nThen, whispering to Mohi—“Is he daft again?”\r\n\r\n“My brain is battered,” said Media. “Azzageddi! you must diet, and be\r\nbled.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” sighed Babbalanja, turning; “how little they ween of the\r\nRudimental Quincunxes, and the Hecatic Spherula!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVII.\r\nThey Visit One Doxodox\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning, we came to a deep, green wood, slowly nodding over the\r\nwaves; its margin frothy-white with foam. A charming sight!\r\n\r\nWhile delighted, all our paddlers gazed, Media, observing Babbalanja\r\nplunged in reveries, called upon him to awake; asking what might so\r\nabsorb him.\r\n\r\n“Ah, my lord! what seraphic sounds have ye driven from me!”\r\n\r\n“Sounds! Sure, there’s naught heard but yonder murmuring surf; what\r\nother sound heard you?”\r\n\r\n“The thrilling of my soul’s monochord, my lord. But prick not your ears\r\nto hear it; that divine harmony is overheard by the rapt spirit alone;\r\nit comes not by the auditory nerves.”\r\n\r\n“No more, Azzageddi! No more of that. Look yonder!”\r\n\r\n“A most lovely wood, in truth. And methinks it is here the sage\r\nDoxodox, surnamed the Wise One, dwells.”\r\n\r\n“Hark, I hear the hootings of his owls,” said Mohi.\r\n\r\n“My lord, you must have read of him. He is said to have penetrated from\r\nthe zoned, to the unzoned principles. Shall we seek him out, that we\r\nmay hearken to his wisdom? Doubtless he knows many things, after which\r\nwe pant.”\r\n\r\nThe lagoon was calm, as we landed; not a breath stirred the plumes of\r\nthe trees; and as we entered the voiceless shades, lifting his hand,\r\nBabbalanja whispered:—“This silence is a fit introduction to the\r\nportals of Telestic lore. Somewhere, beneath this moss, lurks the\r\nmystic stone Mnizuris; whereby Doxodox hath attained unto a knowledge\r\nof the ungenerated essences. Nightly, he bathes his soul in\r\narchangelical circumlucencies. Oh, Doxodox! whip me the Strophalunian\r\ntop! Tell o’er thy Jynges!”\r\n\r\n“Down, Azzageddi! down!” cried Media. “Behold: there sits the Wise One;\r\nnow, for true wisdom!”\r\n\r\nFrom the voices of the party, the sage must have been aware of our\r\napproach: but seated on a green bank, beneath the shade of a red\r\nmulberry, upon the boughs of which, many an owl was perched, he seemed\r\nintent upon describing divers figures in the air, with a jet-black\r\nwand.\r\n\r\nAdvancing with much deference and humility, Babbalanja saluted him.\r\n\r\n“Oh wise Doxodox! Drawn hither by thy illustrious name, we seek\r\nadmittance to thy innermost wisdom. Of all Mardian, thou alone\r\ncomprehendest those arcane combinations, whereby to drag to day the\r\nmost deftly hidden things, present and to come. Thou knowest what we\r\nare, and what we shall be. We beseech thee, evoke thy Tselmns!”\r\n\r\n“Tetrads; Pentads; Hexads; Heptads; Ogdoads:—meanest thou those?”\r\n\r\n“New terms all!”\r\n\r\n“Foiled at thy own weapons,” said Media.\r\n\r\n“Then, if thou comprehendest not my nomenclature:—how my science? But\r\nlet me test thee in the portico.—Why is it, that as some things extend\r\nmore remotely than others; so, Quadammodotatives are larger than\r\nQualitatives; forasmuch, as Quadammodotatives extend to those things,\r\nwhich include the Quadammodotatives themselves.”\r\n\r\n“Azzageddi has found his match,” said Media.\r\n\r\n“Still posed, Babbalanja?” asked Mohi.\r\n\r\n“At a loss, most truly! But I beseech thee, wise Doxodox! instruct me\r\nin thy dialectics, that I may embrace thy more recondite lore.”\r\n\r\n“To begin then, my child:—all Dicibles reside in the mind.”\r\n\r\n“But what are Dicibles?” said Media.\r\n\r\n“Meanest thou, Perfect or Imperfect Dicibles?” Any kind you please;—\r\nbut what are they?”\r\n\r\n“Perfect Dicibles are of various sorts: Interrogative; Percontative;\r\nAdjurative; Optative; Imprecative; Execrative; Substitutive;\r\nCompellative; Hypothetical; and lastly, Dubious.”\r\n\r\n“Dubious enough! Azzageddi! forever, hereafter, hold thy peace.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, my children! I must go back to my Axioms.”\r\n\r\n“And what are they?” said old Mohi.\r\n\r\n“Of various sorts; which, again, are diverse. Thus: my contrary axioms\r\nare Disjunctive, and Subdisjunctive; and so, with the rest. So, too, in\r\ndegree, with my Syllogisms.”\r\n\r\n“And what of them?”\r\n\r\n“Did I not just hint what they were, my child? I repeat, they are of\r\nvarious sorts: Connex, and Conjunct, for example.”\r\n\r\n“And what of them?” persisted Mohi; while Babbalanja, arms folded,\r\nstood serious and mute; a sneer on his lip.\r\n\r\n“As with other branches of my dialectics: so, too, in their way, with\r\nmy Syllogisms. Thus: when I say,—If it be warm, it is not cold:— that’s\r\na simple Sumption. If I add, But it is warm:—that’s an _Ass_umption.”\r\n\r\n“So called from the syllogist himself, doubtless;” said Mohi, stroking\r\nhis beard.\r\n\r\n“Poor ignorant babe! no. Listen:—if finally, I say,—Therefore it is not\r\ncold that’s the final inference.”\r\n\r\n“And a most triumphant one it is!” cried Babbalanja. “Thrice profound,\r\nand sapient Doxodox! Light of Mardi! and Beacon of the Universe! didst\r\never hear of the Shark-Syllogism?”\r\n\r\n“Though thy epithets be true, my child, I distrust thy sincerity. I\r\nhave not yet heard of the syllogism to which thou referrest.”\r\n\r\n“It was thus. A shark seized a swimmer by the leg; addressing him:\r\n‘Friend, I will liberate you, if you truly answer whether you think I\r\npurpose harm.’ Well knowing that sharks seldom were magnanimous, he\r\nreplied: Kind sir, you mean me harm; now go your ways.’ ‘No, no; my\r\nconscience forbids. Nor will I falsify the words of so veracious a\r\nmortal. You were to answer truly; but you say I mean you harm:—so harm\r\nit is:—here goes your leg.’”\r\n\r\n“Profane jester! Would’st thou insult me with thy torn-foolery?\r\nBegone—all of ye! tramp! pack! I say: away with ye!” and into the woods\r\nDoxodox himself disappeared.\r\n\r\n“Bravely done, Babbalanja!” cried Media. “You turned the corner to\r\nadmiration.”\r\n\r\n“I have hopes of our Philosopher yet,” said Mohi.\r\n\r\n“Outrageous impostor! fool, dotard, oaf! Did he think to bejuggle me\r\nwith his preposterous gibberish? And is this shallow phraseman the\r\nrenowned Doxodox whom I have been taught so highly to reverence? Alas,\r\nalas—Odonphi there is none!”\r\n\r\n“His fit again,” sighed Yoomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVIII.\r\nKing Media Dreams\r\n\r\n\r\nThat afternoon was melting down to eve; all but Media broad awake; yet\r\nall motionless, as the slumberer upon the purple mat. Sailing on, with\r\nopen eyes, we slept the wakeful sleep of those, who to the body only\r\ngive repose, while the spirit still toils on, threading her mountain\r\npasses.\r\n\r\nKing Media’s slumbers were like the helmed sentry’s in the saddle. From\r\nthem, he started like an antlered deer, bursting from out a copse. Some\r\nsaid he never slept; that deep within himself he but intensified the\r\nhour; or, leaving his crowned brow in marble quiet, unseen, departed to\r\nfar-off councils of the gods. Howbeit, his lids never closed; in the\r\nnoonday sun, those crystal eyes, like diamonds, sparkled with a fixed\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nAs motionless we thus reclined, Media turned and muttered:—“Brother\r\ngods, and demi-gods, it is not well. These mortals should have less or\r\nmore. Among my subjects is a man, whose genius scorns the common\r\ntheories of things; but whose still mortal mind can not fathom the\r\nocean at his feet. His soul’s a hollow, wherein he raves.”\r\n\r\n“List, list,” whispered Yoomy—“our lord is dreaming; and what a royal\r\ndream.”\r\n\r\n“A very royal and imperial dream,” said Babbalanja—“he is arraigning me\r\nbefore high heaven;—ay, ay; in dreams, at least, he deems himself a\r\ndemi-god.”\r\n\r\n“Hist,” said Mohi—“he speaks again.”\r\n\r\n“Gods and demi-gods! With one gesture all abysses we may disclose; and\r\nbefore this Mardi’s eyes, evoke the shrouded time to come. Were this\r\nwell? Like lost children groping in the woods, they falter through\r\ntheir tangled paths; and at a thousand angles, baffled, start upon each\r\nother. And even when they make an onward move, ’tis but an endless\r\nvestibule, that leads to naught. In my own isle of Odo—Odo! Odo! How\r\nrules my viceroy there?—Down, down, ye madding mobs! Ho, spearmen,\r\ncharge! By the firmament, but my halberdiers fly!”\r\n\r\n“His dream has changed,” said Babbalanja. “He is in Odo, whither his\r\nanxieties impel him.”\r\n\r\n“Hist, hist,” said Yoomy.\r\n\r\n“I leap upon the soil! Render thy account, Almanni! Where’s my throne?\r\nMohi, am I not a king? Do not thy chronicles record me? Yoomy, am I not\r\nthe soul of some one glorious song? Babbalanja, speak.—Mohi! Yoomy!”\r\n\r\n“What is it, my lord? thou dost but dream.”\r\n\r\nStaring wildly; then calmly gazing round, Media smiled. “Ha! how we\r\nroyalties ramble in our dreams! I’ve told no secrets?”\r\n\r\n“While he seemed to sleep, my lord spoke much,” said Mohi.\r\n\r\n“I knew it not, old man; nor would now; but that ye tell me.”\r\n\r\n“We dream not ourselves,” said Babbalanja, “but the thing within us.”\r\n\r\n“Ay?—good-morrow Azzageddi!—But come; no more dreams: Vee-Vee! wine.”\r\n\r\nAnd straight through that livelong night, immortal Media plied the can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIX.\r\nAfter A Long Interval, By Night They Are Becalmed\r\n\r\n\r\nNow suns rose, and set; moons grew, and waned; till, at last, the star\r\nthat erewhile heralded the dawn, presaged the eve; to us, sad token!—\r\nwhile deep within the deepest heart of Mardi’s circle, we sailed from\r\nsea to sea; and isle to isle; and group to group;—vast empires\r\nexplored, and inland valleys, to their utmost heads; and for every ray\r\nin heaven, beheld a king.\r\n\r\nNeedless to recount all that then befell; what tribes and caravans we\r\nsaw; what vast horizons; boundless plains: and sierras, in their every\r\nintervale, a nation nestling.\r\n\r\nEnough that still we roamed.\r\n\r\nIt was evening; and as the red sun, magnified, launched into the wave,\r\nonce more, from a wild strand, we launched our three canoes.\r\n\r\nSoon, from her clouds, hooded Night, like a nun from a convent, drew\r\nnigh. Rustled her train, yet no spangles were there. But high on her\r\nbrow, still shone her pale crescent; haloed by bandelets—violet, red,\r\nand yellow. So looked the lone watcher through her rainbow-iris; so\r\nsad, the night without stars.\r\n\r\nThe winds were laid; the lagoon, still, as a prairie of an August noon.\r\n\r\n“Let us dream out the calm,” said Media. “One of ye paddlers, watch: Ho\r\ncompanions! who’s for Cathay?”\r\n\r\nSleep reigned throughout the canoes, sleeping upon the waters. But\r\nnearer and nearer, low-creeping along, came mists and vapors, a\r\nthousand; spotted with twinklings of Will-o-Wisps from neighboring\r\nshores. Dusky leopards, stealing on by crouches, those vapors seemed.\r\n\r\nHours silently passed. When startled by a cry, Taji sprang to his feet;\r\nagainst which something rattled; then, a quick splash! and a dark form\r\nbounded into the lagoon.\r\n\r\nThe dozing watcher had called aloud; and, about to stab, the assassin,\r\ndropping his stiletto, plunged.\r\n\r\nPeering hard through those treacherous mists, two figures in a shallop,\r\nwere espied; dragging another, dripping, from the brine.\r\n\r\n“Foiled again, and foiled forever. No foe’s corpse was I.”\r\n\r\nAs we gazed, in the gloom quickly vanished the shallop; ere ours could\r\nbe reversed to pursue.\r\n\r\nThen, from the opposite mists, glided a second canoe; and beneath the\r\nIris round the moon, shone now another:—Hautia’s flowery flag!\r\n\r\nVain to wave the sirens off; so still they came.\r\n\r\nOne waved a plant of sickly silver-green.\r\n\r\n“The Midnight Tremmella!” cried Yoomy; “the falling-star of flowers!—\r\nStill I come, when least foreseen; then flee.”\r\n\r\nThe second waved a hemlock top, the spike just tapering its final\r\npoint. The third, a convolvulus, half closed. “The end draws nigh, and\r\nall thy hopes are waning.” Then they proffered grapes.\r\n\r\nBut once more waved off, silently they vanished.\r\n\r\nAgain the buried barb tore, at my soul; again Yillah was invoked, but\r\nHautia made reply.\r\n\r\nSlowly wore out the night. But when uprose the sun, fled clouds, and\r\nfled sadness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXX.\r\nThey Land At Hooloomooloo\r\n\r\n\r\n“Keep all three prows, for yonder rock.” cried Media; “No sadness on\r\nthis merry morn! And now for the Isle of Cripples,—even Hooloomooloo.”\r\n\r\n“The Isle of Cripples?”\r\n\r\n“Ay; why not? Mohi, tell how they came to club.” In substance, this was\r\nthe narration.\r\n\r\nAverse to the barbarous custom of destroying at birth all infants not\r\nsymmetrically formed; but equally desirous of removing from their sight\r\nthose unfortunate beings; the islanders of a neighboring group had long\r\nago established an asylum for cripples; where they lived, subject to\r\ntheir own regulations; ruled by a king of their own election; in short,\r\nforming a distinct class of beings by themselves.\r\n\r\nOne only restriction was placed upon them: on no account must they quit\r\nthe isle assigned them. And to the surrounding islanders, so unpleasant\r\nthe sight of a distorted mortal, that a stranger landing at\r\nHooloomooloo, was deemed a prodigy. Wherefore, respecting any knowledge\r\nof aught beyond them, the cripples were well nigh as isolated, as if\r\nHooloomooloo was the only terra-firma extant.\r\n\r\nDwelling in a community of their own, these unfortunates, who otherwise\r\nhad remained few in number, increased and multiplied greatly. Nor did\r\nsuccessive generations improve in symmetry upon those preceding them.\r\n\r\nSoon, we drew nigh to the isle.\r\n\r\nHeaped up, and jagged with rocks; and, here and there, covered with\r\ndwarfed, twisted thickets, it seemed a fit place for its denizens.\r\n\r\nLanding, we were surrounded by a heterogeneous mob; and thus escorted,\r\ntook our way inland, toward the abode of their lord, King Yoky.\r\n\r\nWhat a scene!\r\n\r\nHere, helping himself along with two crotched roots, hobbled a dwarf\r\nwithout legs; another stalked before, one arm fixed in the air, like a\r\nlightning rod; a third, more active than any, seal-like, flirted a pair\r\nof flippers, and went skipping along; a fourth hopped on a solitary\r\npin, at every bound, spinning round like a top, to gaze; while still\r\nanother, furnished with feelers or fins, rolled himself up in a ball,\r\nbowling over the ground in advance.\r\n\r\nWith curious instinct, the blind stuck close to our side; with their\r\nchattering finger, the deaf and the dumb described angles, obtuse and\r\nacute in the air; and like stones rolling down rocky ravines, scores of\r\nstammerers stuttered. Discord wedded deformity. All asses’ brays were\r\nnow harmonious memories; all Calibans, as angels.\r\n\r\nYet for every stare we gave them, three stares they gave us.\r\n\r\nAt last, we halted before a tenement of rude stones; crooked Banian\r\nboughs its rafters, thatched with fantastic leaves. So rambling and\r\nirregular its plan, it seemed thrown up by the eruption, according to\r\nsage Mohi, the origin of the isle itself.\r\n\r\nEntering, we saw King Yoky.\r\n\r\nAh! sadly lacking was he, in all the requisites of an efficient ruler.\r\nDeaf and dumb he was; and save arms, minus every thing but an\r\nindispensable trunk and head. So huge his all-comprehensive mouth, it\r\nseemed to swallow up itself.\r\n\r\nBut shapeless, helpless as was Yoky,—as king of Hooloomooloo, he was\r\ncompetent; the state being a limited monarchy, of which his Highness\r\nwas but the passive and ornamental head.\r\n\r\nAs his visitors advanced, he fell to gossiping with his fingers: a\r\nservitor interpreting. Very curious to note the rapidity with which\r\nmotion was translated into sound; and the simultaneousness with which\r\nmeaning made its way through four successive channels to the mind—hand,\r\nsight, voice, and tympanum.\r\n\r\nMuch amazement His Highness now expressed; horrified his glances.\r\n\r\n“Why club such frights as ye? Herd ye, to keep in countenance; or are\r\nafraid of your own hideousness, that ye dread to go alone? Monsters!\r\nspeak.”\r\n\r\n“Great Oro!” cried Mohi, “are we then taken for cripples, by the very\r\nKing of the Cripples? My lord, are not our legs and arms all right?”\r\n\r\n“Comelier ones were never turned by turners, Mohi. But royal Yoky! in\r\nsooth we feel abashed before thee.”\r\n\r\nSome further stares were then exchanged; when His Highness sought to\r\nknow, whether there were any Comparative Anatomists among his visitors.\r\n\r\n“Comparative Anatomists! not one.”\r\n\r\n“And why may King Yoky ask that question?” inquired Babbalanja.\r\n\r\nThen was made the following statement.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of his reign, when he seemed fallen into his\r\ndotage, the venerable predecessor of King Yoky had been much attached\r\nto an old gray-headed Chimpanzee, one day found meditating in the\r\nwoods. Rozoko was his name. He was very grave, and reverend of aspect;\r\nmuch of a philosopher. To him, all gnarled and knotty subjects were\r\nfamiliar; in his day he had cracked many a crabbed nut. And so in love\r\nwith his Timonean solitude was Rozoko, that it needed many bribes and\r\nbland persuasions, to induce him to desert his mossy, hillside,\r\nmisanthropic cave, for the distracting tumult of a court.\r\n\r\nBut ere long, promoted to high offices, and made the royal favorite,\r\nthe woodland sage forgot his forests; and, love for love, returned the\r\naged king’s caresses. Ardent friends they straight became; dined and\r\ndrank together; with quivering lips, quaffed long-drawn, sober bumpers;\r\ncomparing all their past experiences; and canvassing those hidden\r\nthemes, on which octogenarians dilate.\r\n\r\nFor when the fires and broils of youth are passed, and Mardi wears its\r\ntruer aspect—then we love to think, not act; the present seems more\r\nunsubstantial than the past; then, we seek out gray-beards like\r\nourselves; and hold discourse of palsies, hearses, shrouds, and tombs;\r\nappoint our undertakers; our mantles gather round us, like to\r\nwinding-sheets; and every night lie down to die. Then, the world’s\r\ngreat bubble bursts; then, Life’s clouds seem sweeping by, revealing\r\nheaven to our straining eyes; then, we tell our beads, and murmur\r\npater-nosters; and in trembling accents cry—“Oro! be merciful.”\r\n\r\nSo, the monarch and Rozoko.\r\n\r\nBut not always were they thus. Of bright, cheerful mornings, they took\r\nslow, tottering rambles in the woods; nodding over grotesque walking-\r\nsticks, of the Chimpanzee’s handiwork. For sedate Rozoko was a\r\ndilletante-arborist: an amateur in canes. Indeed, canes at last became\r\nhis hobby. For half daft with age, sometimes he straddled his good\r\nstaff and gently rode abroad, to take the salubrious evening air;\r\ndeeming it more befitting exercise, at times, than walking. Into this\r\nmenage, he soon initiated his friend, the king; and side by side they\r\noften pranced; or, wearying of the saddle, dismounted; and paused to\r\nponder over prostrate palms, decaying across the path. Their mystic\r\nrings they counted; and, for every ring, a year in their own calendars.\r\n\r\nNow, so closely did the monarch cleave to the Chimpanzee, that, in good\r\ntime, summoning his subjects, earnestly he charged it on them, that at\r\ndeath, he and his faithful friend should be buried in one tomb.\r\n\r\nIt came to pass, the monarch died; and Poor Rozoko, now reduced to\r\nsecond childhood, wailed most dismally:—no one slept that night in\r\nHooloomooloo. Never did he leave the body; and at last, slowly going\r\nround it thrice, he laid him down; close nestled; and noiselessly\r\nexpired.\r\n\r\nThe king’s injunctions were remembered; and one vault received them\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nMoon followed moon; and wrought upon by jeers and taunts, the people of\r\nthe isle became greatly scandalized, that a base-born baboon should\r\nshare the shroud of their departed lord; though they themselves had\r\ntucked in the aged AEneas fast by the side of his Achates.\r\n\r\nThey straight resolved, to build another vault; and over it, a lofty\r\ncairn; and thither carry the remains they reverenced.\r\n\r\nBut at the disinterring, a sad perplexity arose. For lo surpassing Saul\r\nand Jonathan, not even in decay were these fast friends divided. So\r\nmingled every relic,—ilium and ulna, carpus and metacarpus;—and so\r\nsimilar the corresponding parts, that like the literary remains of\r\nBeaumont and of Fletcher, which was which, no spectacles could tell.\r\nTherefore, they desisted; lest the towering monument they had reared,\r\nmight commemorate an ape, and not a king.\r\n\r\nSuch the narration; hearing which, my lord Media kept stately silence.\r\nBut in courtly phrase, as beseemed him, Babbalanja, turban in hand,\r\nthus spoke:—\r\n\r\n“My concern is extreme, King Yoky, at the embarrassment into which your\r\nisland is thrown. Nor less my grief, that I myself am not the man, to\r\nput an end to it. I could weep that Comparative Anatomists are not so\r\nnumerous now, as hereafter they assuredly must become; when their\r\nservices shall be in greater request; when, at the last, last day of\r\nall, millions of noble and ignoble spirits will loudly clamor for lost\r\nskeletons; when contending claimants shall start up for one poor,\r\ncarious spine; and, dog-like, we shall quarrel over our own bones.”\r\n\r\nThen entered dwarf-stewards, and major-domos; aloft bearing twisted\r\nantlers; all hollowed out in goblets, grouped; announcing dinner.\r\n\r\nLoving not, however, to dine with misshapen Mardians, King Media was\r\nloth to move. But Babbalanja, quoting the old proverb—“Strike me in the\r\nface, but refuse not my yams,” induced him to sacrifice his\r\nfastidiousness.\r\n\r\nSo, under a flourish of ram-horn bugles, court and company proceeded to\r\nthe banquet.\r\n\r\nCentral was a long, dislocated trunk of a wild Banian; like a huge\r\ncentipede crawling on its hundred branches, sawn of even lengths for\r\nlegs. This table was set out with wry-necked gourds; deformities of\r\ncalabashes; and shapeless trenchers, dug out of knotty woods.\r\n\r\nThe first course was shrimp-soup, served in great clampshells; the\r\nsecond, lobsters, cuttle-fish, crabs, cockles, cray-fish; the third,\r\nhunchbacked roots of the Taro-plant—plantains, perversely curling at\r\nthe end, like the inveterate tails of pertinacious pigs; and for\r\ndessert, ill-shaped melons, huge as idiots’ heads, plainly suffering\r\nfrom water in the brain.\r\n\r\nNow these viands were commended to the favorable notice of all guests;\r\nnot only for their delicacy of flavor, but for their symmetry.\r\n\r\nAnd in the intervals of the courses, we were bored with hints to admire\r\nnumerous objects of vertu: bow-legged stools of mangrove wood; zig-zag\r\nrapiers of bone; armlets of grampus-vertebrae; outlandish tureens of\r\nthe callipees of terrapin; and cannakins of the skulls of baboons.\r\n\r\nThe banquet over, with many congees, we withdrew.\r\n\r\nReturning to the water-side, we passed a field, where dwarfs were\r\nlaboring in beds of yams, heaping the soil around the roots, by\r\nscratching it backward; as a dog.\r\n\r\nAll things in readiness, Yoky’s valet, a tri-armed dwarf, treated us to\r\na glorious start, by giving each canoe a vigorous triple-push, crying,\r\n“away with ye, monsters!”\r\n\r\nNor must it be omitted that just previous to embarking, Vee-Vee, spying\r\na curious looking stone, turned it over, and found a snake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXI.\r\nA Book From The “Ponderings Of Old Bardianna”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Babbalanja, lighting his trombone as we sailed from the\r\nisle, “who are the monsters, we or the cripples?”\r\n\r\n“You yourself are a monster, for asking the question,” said Mohi.\r\n\r\n“And so, to the cripples I am; though not, old man, for the reason you\r\nmention. But I am, as I am; whether hideous, or handsome, depends upon\r\nwho is made judge. There is no supreme standard yet revealed, whereby\r\nto judge of ourselves; ‘Our very instincts are prejudices,’ saith Alla\r\nMallolla; ‘Our very axioms, and postulates are far from infallible.’\r\n‘In respect of the universe, mankind is but a sect,’ saith Diloro: ‘and\r\nfirst principles but dogmas.’ What ethics prevail in the Pleiades? What\r\nthings have the synods in Sagittarius decreed?”\r\n\r\n“Never mind your old authors,” said Media. “Stick to the cripples;\r\nenlarge upon them.”\r\n\r\n“But I have done with them now, my lord; the sermon is not the text.\r\nGive ear to old Bardianna. I know him by heart. Thus saith the sage in\r\nBook X. of the Ponderings, ‘Zermalmende,’ the title: ‘Je pense,’ the\r\nmotto:—‘My supremacy over creation, boasteth man, is declared in my\r\nnatural attitude:—I stand erect! But so do the palm-trees; and the\r\ngiraffes that graze off their tops. And the fowls of the air fly high\r\nover our heads; and from the place where we fancy our heaven to be,\r\ndefile the tops of our temples. Belike, the eagles, from their eyries\r\nlook down upon us Mardians, in our hives, even as upon the beavers in\r\ntheir dams, marveling at our incomprehensible ways. And cunning though\r\nwe be, some things, hidden from us, may not be mysteries to them.\r\nHaving five keys, hold we all that open to knowledge? Deaf, blind, and\r\ndeprived of the power of scent, the bat will steer its way\r\nunerringly:—could we? Yet man is lord of the bat and the brute; lord\r\nover the crows; with whom, he must needs share the grain he garners. We\r\nsweat for the fowls, as well as ourselves. The curse of labor rests\r\nonly on us. Like slaves, we toil: at their good leisure they glean.\r\n\r\n“‘Mardi is not wholly ours. We are the least populous part of creation.\r\nTo say nothing of other tribes, a census of the herring would find us\r\nfar in the minority. And what life is to us,—sour or sweet,—so is it to\r\nthem. Like us, they die, fighting death to the last; like us, they\r\nspawn and depart. We inhabit but a crust, rough surfaces, odds and ends\r\nof the isles; the abounding lagoon being its two-thirds, its grand\r\nfeature from afar; and forever unfathomable.\r\n\r\n“‘What shaft has yet been sunk to the antipodes? What underlieth the\r\ngold mines?\r\n\r\n“‘But even here, above-ground, we grope with the sun at meridian.\r\nVainly, we seek our Northwest Passages,—old alleys, and thoroughfares\r\nof the whales.\r\n\r\n“‘Oh men! fellow men! we are only what we are; not what we would be;\r\nnor every thing we hope for. We are but a step in a scale, that reaches\r\nfurther above us than below. We breathe but oxygen. Who in Arcturus\r\nhath heard of us? They know us not in the Milky Way. We prate of\r\nfaculties divine: and know not how sprouteth a spear of grass; we go\r\nabout shrugging our shoulders: when the firmament-arch is over us; we\r\nrant of etherealities: and long tarry over our banquets; we demand\r\nEternity for a lifetime: when our mortal half-hours too often prove\r\ntedious. We know not of what we talk. The Bird of Paradise out-flies\r\nour flutterings. What it is to be immortal, has not yet entered into\r\nour thoughts. At will, we build our futurities; tier above tier, all\r\ngalleries full of laureates: resounding with everlasting oratorios!\r\nPater-nosters forever, or eternal Misereres! forgetting that in Mardi,\r\nour breviaries oft fall from our hands. But divans there are, some say,\r\nwhereon we shall recline, basking in effulgent suns, knowing neither\r\nOrient nor Occident. Is it so? Fellow men! our mortal lives have an\r\nend; but that end is no goal: no place of repose. Whatever it may be,\r\nit will prove but as the beginning of another race. We will hope, joy,\r\nweep, as before; though our tears may be such as the spice-trees shed.\r\nSupine we can only be, annihilated.\r\n\r\n“‘The thick film is breaking; the ages have long been circling.\r\nFellow-men! if we live hereafter, it will not be in lyrics; nor shall\r\nwe yawn, and our shadows lengthen, while the eternal cycles are\r\nrevolving. To live at all, is a high vocation; to live forever, and run\r\nparallel with Oro, may truly appall us. Toil we not here? and shall we\r\nbe forever slothful elsewhere? Other worlds differ not much from this,\r\nbut in degree. Doubtless, a pebble is a fair specimen of the universe.\r\n\r\n“‘We point at random. Peradventure at this instant, there are beings\r\ngazing up to this very world as their future heaven. But the universe\r\nis all over a heaven: nothing but stars on stars, throughout infinities\r\nof expansion. All we see are but a cluster. Could we get to Bootes, we\r\nwould be no nearer Oro, than now he hath no place; but is here.\r\nAlready, in its unimaginable roamings, our system may have dragged us\r\nthrough and through the spaces, where we plant cities of beryl and\r\njasper. Even now, we may be inhaling the ether, which we fancy seraphic\r\nwings are fanning. But look round. There is much to be seen here, and\r\nnow. Do the archangels survey aught more glorious than the\r\nconstellations we nightly behold? Continually we slight the wonders, we\r\ndeem in reserve. We await the present. With marvels we are glutted,\r\ntill we hold them no marvels at all. But had these eyes first opened\r\nupon all the prodigies in the Revelation of the Dreamer, long\r\nfamiliarity would have made them appear, even as these things we see.\r\nNow, _now_, the page is out-spread: to the simple, easy as a primer; to\r\nthe wise, more puzzling than hieroglyphics. The eternity to come, is\r\nbut a prolongation of time present: and the beginning may be more\r\nwonderful than the end.\r\n\r\n“‘Then let us be wise. But much of the knowledge we seek, already we\r\nhave in our cores. Yet so simple it is, we despise it; so bold, we fear\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“‘In solitude, let us exhume our ingots. Let us hear our own thoughts.\r\nThe soul needs no mentor, but Oro; and Oro, without proxy. Wanting Him,\r\nit is both the teacher and the taught. Undeniably, reason was the first\r\nrevelation; and so far as it tests all others, it has precedence over\r\nthem. It comes direct to us, without suppression or interpolation; and\r\nwith Oro’s indisputable imprimatur. But inspiration though it be, it is\r\nnot so arrogant as some think. Nay, far too humble, at times it submits\r\nto the grossest indignities. Though in its best estate, not infallible;\r\nso far as it goes, for us, it is reliable. When at fault, it stands\r\nstill. We speak not of visionaries. But if this our first revelation\r\nstops short of the uttermost, so with all others. If, often, it only\r\nperplexes: much more the rest. They leave much unexpounded; and\r\ndisclosing new mysteries, add to the enigma. Fellow-men; the ocean we\r\nwould sound is unfathomable; and however much we add to our line, when\r\nit is out, we feel not the bottom. Let us be truly lowly, then; not\r\nlifted up with a Pharisaic humility. We crawl not like worms; nor wear\r\nwe the liveries of angels.\r\n\r\n“‘The firmament-arch has no key-stone; least of all, is man its prop.\r\nHe stands alone. We are every thing to ourselves, but how little to\r\nothers. What are others to us? Assure life everlasting to this\r\ngeneration, and their immediate forefathers—and what tears would flow,\r\nwere there no resurrection for the countless generations from the first\r\nman to five cycles since? And soon we ourselves shall have fallen in\r\nwith the rank and file of our sires. At a blow, annihilate some distant\r\ntribe, now alive and jocund—and what would we reck? Curiosity apart, do\r\nwe really care whether the people in Bellatrix are immortal or no?\r\n\r\n“‘Though they smite us, let us not turn away from these things, if they\r\nbe really thus.\r\n\r\n“‘There was a time, when near Cassiopeia, a star of the first\r\nmagnitude, most lustrous in the North, grew lurid as a fire, then dim\r\nas ashes, and went out. Now, its place is a blank. A vast world, with\r\nall its continents, say the astronomers, blazing over the heads of our\r\nfathers; while in Mardi were merry-makings, and maidens given in\r\nmarriage. Who now thinks of that burning sphere? How few are aware that\r\never it was?\r\n\r\n“‘These things are so.\r\n\r\n“‘Fellow-men! we must go, and obtain a glimpse of what we are from the\r\nBelts of Jupiter and the Moons of Saturn, ere we see ourselves aright.\r\nThe universe can wax old without us; though by Oro’s grace we may live\r\nto behold a wrinkle in the sky. Eternity is not ours by right; and,\r\nalone, unrequited sufferings here, form no title thereto, unless\r\nresurrections are reserved for maltreated brutes. Suffering is\r\nsuffering; be the sufferer man, brute, or thing.\r\n\r\n“‘How small;—how nothing, our deserts! Let us stifle all vain\r\nspeculations; we need not to be told what righteousness is; we were\r\nborn with the whole Law in our hearts. Let us do: let us act: let us\r\ndown on our knees. And if, after all, we should be no more forever;—\r\nfar better to perish meriting immortality, than to enjoy it\r\nunmeritorious. While we fight over creeds, ten thousand fingers point\r\nto where vital good may be done. All round us, Want crawls to her\r\nlairs; and, shivering, dies unrelieved. Here, _here_, fellow-men, we\r\ncan better minister as angels, than in heaven, where want and misery\r\ncome not.\r\n\r\n“‘We Mardians talk as though the future was all in all; but act as\r\nthough the present was every thing. Yet so far as, in our theories, we\r\ndwarf our Mardi; we go not beyond an archangel’s apprehension of it,\r\nwho takes in all suns and systems at a glance. Like pebbles, were the\r\nisles to sink in space, Sirius, the Dog-star, would still flame in the\r\nsky. But as the atom to the animalculae, so Mardi to us. And lived\r\naright, these mortal lives are long; looked into, these souls,\r\nfathomless as the nethermost depths.\r\n\r\n“‘Fellow-men; we split upon hairs; but stripped, mere words and phrases\r\ncast aside, the great bulk of us are orthodox. None who think, dissent\r\nfrom the grand belief. The first man’s thoughts were as ours. The\r\nparamount revelation prevails with us; and all that clashes therewith,\r\nwe do not so much believe, as believe that we can not disbelieve.\r\nCommon sense is a sturdy despot; that, for the most part, has its own\r\nway. It inspects and ratifies much independent of it. But those who\r\nthink they do wholly reject it, are but held in a sly sort of bondage;\r\nunder a semblance of something else, wearing the old yoke.’”\r\n\r\n“Cease, cease, Babbalanja,” said Media, “and permit me to insinuate a\r\nword in your ear. You have long been in the habit, philosopher, of\r\nregaling us with chapters from your old Bardianna; and with infinite\r\ngusto, you have just recited the longest of all. But I do not observe,\r\noh, Sage! that for all these things, you yourself are practically the\r\nbetter or wiser. You live not up to Bardianna’s main thought. Where he\r\nstands, he stands immovable; but you are a Dog-vane. How is this?”\r\n\r\n“Gogle-goggle, fugle-fi, fugle-fogle-orum!”\r\n\r\n“Mad, mad again,” cried Yoomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXII.\r\nBabbalanja Starts To His Feet\r\n\r\n\r\nFor twenty-four hours, seated stiff, and motionless, Babbalanja spoke\r\nnot a word; then, almost without moving a muscle, muttered thus:—“At\r\nbanquets surfeit not, but fill; partake, and retire; and eat not again\r\ntill you crave. Thereby you give nature time to work her magic\r\ntransformings; turning all solids to meat, and wine into blood. After a\r\nbanquet you incline to repose:—do so: digestion commands. All this\r\nfollow those, who feast at the tables of Wisdom; and all such are they,\r\nwho partake of the fare of old Bardianna.”\r\n\r\n“Art resuscitated, then, Babbalanja?” said Media. “Ay, my lord, I am\r\njust risen from the dead.”\r\n\r\n“And did Azzageddi conduct you to their realms?”\r\n\r\n“Fangs off! fangs off! depart, thou fiend!—unhand me! or by Oro, I will\r\ndie and spite thee!”\r\n\r\n“Quick, quick, Mohi! let us change places,” cried Yoomy.\r\n\r\n“How now, Babbalanja?” said Media.\r\n\r\n“Oh my lord man—not _you_ my lord Media!—high and mighty Puissance!\r\ngreat King of Creation!—thou art but the biggest of braggarts! In every\r\nage, thou boastest of thy valorous advances:—flat fools, old dotards,\r\nand numskulls, our sires! All the Past, wasted time! the Present knows\r\nall! right lucky, fellow-beings, we live now! every man an author!\r\nbooks plenty as men! strike a light in a minute! teeth sold by the\r\npound! all the elements fetching and carrying! lightning running on\r\nerrands! rivers made to order! the ocean a puddle!— But ages back they\r\nboasted like us; and ages to come, forever and ever, they’ll boast.\r\nAges back they black-balled the past, thought the last day was come; so\r\nwise they were grown. Mardi could not stand long; have to annex one of\r\nthe planets; invade the great sun; colonize the moon;—conquerors sighed\r\nfor new Mardis; and sages for heaven— having by heart all the primers\r\nhere below. Like us, ages back they groaned under their books; made\r\nbonfires of libraries, leaving ashes behind, mid which we reverentially\r\ngrope for charred pages, forgetting we are so much wiser than they.—But\r\namazing times! astounding revelations; preternatural divulgings!—How\r\nnow?—more wonderful than all our discoveries is this: that they never\r\nwere discovered before. So simple, no doubt our ancestors overlooked\r\nthem; intent on deeper things—the deep things of the soul. All we\r\ndiscover has been with us since the sun began to roll; and much we\r\ndiscover, is not worth the discovering. We are children, climbing trees\r\nafter birds’ nests, and making a great shout, whether we find eggs in\r\nthem or no. But where are our wings, which our fore-fathers surely had\r\nnot? Tell us, ye sages! something worth an archangel’s learning;\r\ndiscover, ye discoverers, something new. Fools, fools! Mardi’s not\r\nchanged: the sun yet rises in its old place in the East; all things go\r\non in the same old way; we cut our eye-teeth just as late as they did,\r\nthree thousand years ago.”\r\n\r\n“Your pardon,” said Mohi, “for beshrew me, they are not yet all cut. At\r\nthreescore and ten, here have I a new tooth coming now.”\r\n\r\n“Old man! it but clears the way for another. The teeth sown by the\r\nalphabet-founder, were eye-teeth, not yet all sprung from the soil.\r\nLike spring-wheat, blade by blade, they break ground late; like\r\nspring-wheat, many seeds have perished in the hard winter glebe. Oh, my\r\nlord! though we galvanize corpses into St. Vitus’ dances, we raise not\r\nthe dead from their graves! Though we have discovered the circulation\r\nof the blood, men die as of yore; oxen graze, sheep bleat, babies bawl,\r\nasses bray—loud and lusty as the day before the flood. Men fight and\r\nmake up; repent and go at it; feast and starve; laugh and weep; pray\r\nand curse; cheat, chaffer, trick, truckle, cozen, defraud, fib, lie,\r\nbeg, borrow, steal, hang, drown—as in the laughing and weeping,\r\ntricking and truckling, hanging and drowning times that have been.\r\nNothing changes, though much be new-fashioned: new fashions but\r\nrevivals of things previous. In the books of the past we learn naught\r\nbut of the present; in those of the present, the past. All Mardi’s\r\nhistory—beginning middle, and finis—was written out in capitals in the\r\nfirst page penned. The whole story is told in a title- page. An\r\nexclamation point is entire Mardi’s autobiography.”\r\n\r\n“Who speaks now?” said Media, “Bardianna, Azzageddi, or Babbalanja?”\r\n\r\n“All three: is it not a pleasant concert?”\r\n\r\n“Very fine: very fine.—Go on; and tell us something of the future.”\r\n\r\n“I have never departed this life yet, my lord.”\r\n\r\n“But just now you said you were risen from the dead.” “From the buried\r\ndead within me; not from myself, my lord.”\r\n\r\n“If you, then, know nothing of the future—did Bardianna?”\r\n\r\n“If he did, naught did he reveal. I have ever observed, my lord, that\r\neven in their deepest lucubrations, the profoundest, frankest,\r\nponderers always reserve a vast deal of precious thought for their own\r\nprivate behoof. They think, perhaps, that ’tis too good, or too bad;\r\ntoo wise, or too foolish, for the multitude. And this unpleasant\r\nvibration is ever consequent upon striking a new vein of ideas in the\r\nsoul. As with buried treasures, the ground over them sounds strange and\r\nhollow. At any rate, the profoundest ponderer seldom tells us all he\r\nthinks; seldom reveals to us the ultimate, and the innermost; seldom\r\nmakes us open our eyes under water; seldom throws open the\r\ntotus-in-toto; and never carries us with him, to the unconsubsistent,\r\nthe ideaimmanens, the super-essential, and the One.”\r\n\r\nConfusion! Remember the Quadammodatatives!”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Braid-Beard, “that’s the crack in his calabash, which all\r\nthe Dicibles of Doxdox will not mend.”\r\n\r\n“And from that crazy calabash he gives us to drink, old Mohi.”\r\n\r\n“But never heed his leaky gourd nor its contents, my lord. Let these\r\nphilosophers muddle themselves as they will, we wise ones refuse to\r\npartake.”\r\n\r\n“And fools like me drink till they reel,” said Babbalanja. “But in\r\nthese matters one’s calabash must needs go round to keep afloat.\r\nFogle-orum!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIII.\r\nAt Last, The Last Mention Is Made Of Old Bardianna; And His Last Will\r\nAnd Testament Is Recited At Length\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day was waning. And, as after many a tale of ghosts, around their\r\nforest fire, Hungarian gipsies silent sit; watching the ruddy glow\r\nkindling each other’s faces;—so, now we solemn sat; the crimson West\r\nour fire; all our faces flushed.\r\n\r\n“Testators!” then cried Media, when your last wills are all round\r\nsettled, speak, and make it known!”\r\n\r\n“Mine, my lord, has long been fixed,” said Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n“And how runs it?”\r\n\r\n“Fugle-fogle—”\r\n\r\n“Hark ye, intruding Azzageddi! rejoin thy merry mates below;—go there,\r\nand wag thy saucy tail; or I will nail it to our bow, till ye roar for\r\nliberation. Begone, I say.”\r\n\r\n“Down, devil! deeper down!” rumbled Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n“My lord, I think he’s gone. And now, by your good leave, I’ll repeat\r\nold Bardianna’s Will. It’s worth all Mardi’s hearing; and I have so\r\nstudied it, by rote I know it.”\r\n\r\n“Proceed then; but I mistrust that Azzageddi is not yet many thousand\r\nfathoms down.”\r\n\r\n“Attend my lord:—‘Anno Mardis 50,000,000, o.s. I, Bardianna, of the\r\nisland of Vamba, and village of the same name, having just risen from\r\nmy yams, in high health, high spirits, and sound mind, do hereby\r\ncheerfully make and ordain this my last will and testament.\r\n\r\n“‘Imprimis:\r\n\r\n“‘All my kith and kin being well to do in Mardi, I wholly leave them\r\nout of this my will.\r\n\r\n“‘Item. Since, in divers ways, verbally and otherwise, my good friend\r\nPondo has evinced a strong love for me, Bardianna, as the owner and\r\nproprietor of all that capital messuage with the appurtenances, in\r\nVamba aforesaid, called ‘The Lair,’ wherein I now dwell; also for all\r\nmy Bread-fruit orchards, Palm-groves, Banana-plantations, Taro-patches,\r\ngardens, lawns, lanes, and hereditaments whatsoever, adjoining the\r\naforesaid messuage;—I do hereby give and bequeath the same to Bomblum\r\nof the island of Adda; the aforesaid Bomblum having never expressed any\r\nregard for me, as a holder of real estate.\r\n\r\n“‘Item. My esteemed neighbor Lakreemo having since the last lunar\r\neclipse called daily to inquire after the state of my health: and\r\nhaving nightly made tearful inquiries of my herb-doctor, concerning the\r\nstate of my viscera;—I do hereby give and bequeath to the aforesaid\r\nLakreemo all and sundry those vegetable pills, potions, powders,\r\naperients, purgatives, expellatives, evacuatives, tonics, emetics,\r\ncathartics, clysters, injections, scarifiers, cataplasms, lenitives,\r\nlotions, decoctions, washes, gargles, and phlegmagogues; together with\r\nall the jars, calabashes, gourds, and galipots, thereunto pertaining;\r\nsituate, lying, and being, in the west-by-north corner of my\r\neast-southeast crypt, in my aforesaid tenement known as ‘The Lair.’\r\n\r\n“‘Item. The woman Pesti; a native of Vamba, having oftentimes hinted\r\nthat I, Bardianna, sorely needed a spouse, and having also intimated\r\nthat she bore me a conjugal affection; I do hereby give and bequeath to\r\nthe aforesaid Pesti:—my blessing; forasmuch, as by the time of the\r\nopening of this my last will and testament, I shall have been forever\r\ndelivered from the aforesaid Pesti’s persecutions.\r\n\r\n“‘Item. Having a high opinion of the probity of my worthy and excellent\r\nfriend Bidiri, I do hereby entirely, and wholly, give, will, grant,\r\nbestow, devise, and utterly hand over unto the said Bidiri, all that\r\ntenement where my servant Oram now dwelleth; with all the lawns,\r\nmeadows, uplands and lowlands, fields, groves, and gardens, thereunto\r\nbelonging:—IN TRUST NEVERTHELESS to have and to hold the same for the\r\nsole use and benefit of Lanbranka Hohinna, spinster, now resident of\r\nthe aforesaid island of Vamba.\r\n\r\n“‘Item. I give and bequeath my large carved drinking gourd to my good\r\ncomrade Topo.\r\n\r\n“’Item. My fast friend Doldrum having at sundry times, and in sundry\r\nplaces, uttered the prophecy, that upon my decease his sorrow would be\r\ngreat; I do hereby give and bequeath to the aforesaid Doldrum, ten\r\nyards of my best soft tappa, to be divided into handkerchiefs for his\r\nsole benefit and behoof.\r\n\r\n“’Item. My sensible friend Solo having informed me, that he intended to\r\nremain a bachelor for life; I give and devise to the aforesaid Solo,\r\nthe mat for one person, whereon I nightly repose.\r\n\r\n“’Item. Concerning my private Arbor and Palm-groves, adjoining, lying,\r\nand being in the isle of Vamba, I give and devise the same, with all\r\nappurtenances whatsoever, to my friend Minta the Cynic, to have and to\r\nhold, in trust for the first through-and-through honest man, issue of\r\nmy neighbor Mondi; and in default of such issue, for the first\r\nthrough-and-through honest man, issue of my neighbor Pendidda; and in\r\ndefault of such issue, for the first through-and-through honest man,\r\nissue of my neighbor Wynodo: and in default of such issue, to any\r\nthrough-and-through honest man, issue of any body, to be found through\r\nthe length and breadth of Mardi.\r\n\r\n“’Item.

I give to the poor of Vamba the total contents of my\r\nred-labeled bags of bicuspids and canines (which I account\r\nthree-fourths of my whole estate); to my body servant Fidi, my staff,\r\nall my robes and togas, and three hundred molars in cash; to that\r\ndiscerning and sagacious philosopher my disciple Krako, one complete\r\nset of denticles, to buy him a vertebral bone ring; and to that pious\r\nand promising youth Vangi, two fathoms of my best kaiar rope, with the\r\nprivilege of any bough in my groves.\r\n\r\n“’All the rest of my goods, chattels and household stuff whatsoever;\r\nand all my loose denticles, remaining after my debts and legacies are\r\npaid, and my body is out of sight, I hereby direct to be distributed\r\namong the poor of Vamba.\r\n\r\n“’Ultimo. I give and bequeath to all Mardi this my last advice and\r\ncounsel:—videlicet: live as long as you can; close your own eyes when\r\nyou die.\r\n\r\n“’I have no previous wills to revoke; and publish this to be my first\r\nand last.\r\n\r\n“’In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my right hand; and hereunto\r\nhave caused a true copy of the tattooing on my right temple to be\r\naffixed, during the year first above written.\r\n\r\n“’By me, BARDIANNA.’”\r\n\r\n“Babbalanja, that’s an extraordinary document,” said Media.\r\n\r\n“Bardianna was an extraordinary man, my lord.”\r\n\r\n“Were there no codicils?”\r\n\r\n“The will is all codicils; all after-thoughts; Ten thoughts for one\r\nact, was Bardianna’s motto.”\r\n\r\n“Left he nothing whatever to his kindred?”\r\n\r\n“Not a stump.”\r\n\r\n“Prom his will, he seems to have lived single.”\r\n\r\n“Yes: Bardianna never sought to improve upon nature; a bachelor he was\r\nborn, and a bachelor he died.”\r\n\r\n“According to the best accounts, how did he depart, Babbalanja?” asked\r\nMohi.\r\n\r\n“With a firm lip, and his hand on his heart, old man.”\r\n\r\n“His last words?”\r\n\r\n“Calmer, and better!”\r\n\r\n“Where think you, he is now?”\r\n\r\n“In his Ponderings. And those, my lord, we all inherit; for like the\r\ngreat chief of Romara, who made a whole empire his legatee; so, great\r\nauthors have all Mardi for an heir.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIV.\r\nA Death-Cloud Sweeps By Them, As They Sail\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day, a fearful sight!\r\n\r\nAs in Sooloo’s seas, one vast water-spout will, sudden, form: and\r\nwhirling, chase the flying Malay keels; so, before a swift-winged\r\ncloud, a thousand prows sped by, leaving braided, foaming wakes; their\r\ncrowded inmates’ arms, in frenzied supplications wreathed; like tangled\r\nforest-boughs.\r\n\r\n“See, see,” cried Yoomy, “how the Death-cloud flies! Let us dive down\r\nin the sea.”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” said Babbalanja. “All things come of Oro; if we must drown, let\r\nOro drown us.”\r\n\r\n“Down sails: drop paddles,” said Media: “here we float.”\r\n\r\nLike a rushing bison, sweeping by, the Death-cloud grazed us with its\r\nfoam; and whirling in upon the thousand prows beyond, sudden burst in\r\ndeluges; and scooping out a maelstrom, dragged down every plank and\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nLong we rocked upon the circling billows, which expanding from that\r\ncenter, dashed every isle, till, moons after-ward, faint, they laved\r\nall Mardi’s reef.\r\n\r\n“Thanks unto Oro,” murmured Mohi, “this heart still beats.”\r\n\r\nThat sun-flushed eve, we sailed by many tranquil harbors, whence fled\r\nthose thousand prows. Serene, the waves ran up their strands; and\r\nchimed around the unharmed stakes of palm, to which the thousand prows\r\nthat morning had been fastened.\r\n\r\n“Flying death, they ran to meet it,” said Babbalanja. “But tie not that\r\nthey fled, they died; for maelstroms, of these harbors, the Death-cloud\r\nmight have made. But they died, because they might not longer live.\r\nCould we gain one glimpse of the great calendar of eternity, all our\r\nnames would there be found, glued against their dates of death. We die\r\nby land, and die by sea; we die by earthquakes, famines, plagues, and\r\nwars; by fevers, agues; woe, or mirth excessive. This mortal air is one\r\nwide pestilence, that kills us all at last. Whom the Death-cloud\r\nspares, sleeping, dies in silent watches of the night. He whom the\r\nspears of many battles could not slay, dies of a grape-stone, beneath\r\nthe vine-clad bower he built, to shade declining years. We die, because\r\nwe live. But none the less does Babbalanja quake. And if he flies not,\r\n’tis because he stands the center of a circle; its every point a\r\nleveled dart; and every bow, bent back:—a twang, and Babbalanja dies.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXV.\r\nThey Visit The Palmy King Abrazza\r\n\r\n\r\nNight and morn departed; and in the afternoon, we drew nigh to an\r\nisland, overcast with shadows; a shower was falling; and pining,\r\nplaintive notes forth issued from the groves: half-suppressed, and\r\nsobbing whisperings of leaves. The shore sloped to the water; thither\r\nour prows were pointed.\r\n\r\n“Sheer off! no landing here,” cried Media, “let us gain the sunny side;\r\nand like the care-free bachelor Abrazza, who here is king, turn our\r\nback on the isle’s shadowy side, and revel in its morning-meads.”\r\n\r\n“And lord Abrazza:—who is he?” asked Yoomy.\r\n\r\n“The one hundred and twentieth in lineal descent from Phipora,” said\r\nMohi; “and connected on the maternal side to the lord seigniors of\r\nKlivonia. His uttermost uncle was nephew to the niece of Queen\r\nZmiglandi; who flourished so long since, she wedded at the first\r\nTransit of Venus. His pedigree is endless.”\r\n\r\n“But who is lord Abrazza?”\r\n\r\n“Has he not said?” answered Babbalanja. “Why so dull?—Uttermost nephew\r\nto him, who was nephew to the niece of the peerless Queen Zmiglandi;\r\nand the one hundred and twentieth in descent from the illustrious\r\nPhipora.”\r\n\r\n“Will none tell, who Abrazza is?”\r\n\r\n“Can not a man then, be described by running off the catalogue of his\r\nancestors?” said Babbalanja. “Or must we e’en descend to himself. Then,\r\nlisten, dull Yoomy! and know that lord Abrazza is six feet two: plump\r\nthighs; blue eyes; and brown hair; likes his bread-fruit baked, not\r\nroasted; sometimes carries filberts in his crown: and has a way of\r\nwinking when he speaks. His teeth are good.”\r\n\r\n“Are you publishing some decamped burglar,” said Media, “that you speak\r\nthus of my royal friend, the lord Abrazza? Go on, sir! and say he\r\nreigns sole king of Bonovona!”\r\n\r\n“My lord, I had not ended. Abrazza, Yoomy, is a fine and florid king:\r\nhigh-fed, and affluent of heart; of speech, mellifluent. And for a\r\nroyalty extremely amiable. He is a sceptered gentleman, who does much\r\ngood. Kind king! in person he gives orders for relieving those, who\r\ndaily dive for pearls, to grace his royal robe; and gasping hard, with\r\nblood-shot eyes, come up from shark-infested depths, and fainting, lay\r\ntheir treasure at his feet. Sweet lord Abrazza! how he pities those,\r\nwho in his furthest woodlands day-long toil to do his bidding. Yet\r\nking-philosopher, he never weeps; but pities with a placid smile; and\r\nthat but seldom.”\r\n\r\n“There seems much iron in your blood,” said Media. “But say your say.”\r\n\r\n“Say I not truth, my lord? Abrazza, I admire. Save his royal pity all\r\nelse is jocund round him. He loves to live for life’s own sake. He vows\r\nhe’ll have no cares; and often says, in pleasant reveries,— ‘Sure, my\r\nlord Abrazza, if any one should be care-free, ’tis thou; who strike\r\ndown none, but pity all the fallen!’ Yet none he lifteth up.”\r\n\r\nAt length we gained the sunny side, and shoreward tended. Vee-Vee’s\r\nhorn was sonorous; and issuing from his golden groves, my lord Abrazza,\r\nlike a host that greets you on the threshold, met us, as we keeled the\r\nbeach.\r\n\r\n“Welcome! fellow demi-god, and king! Media, my pleasant guest!”\r\n\r\nHis servitors salamed; his chieftains bowed; his yeoman-guard, in\r\nmeadow-green, presented palm-stalks,—royal tokens; and hand in hand,\r\nthe nodding, jovial, regal friends, went up a lane of salutations;\r\ndragging behind, a train of envyings.\r\n\r\nMuch we marked Abrazza’s jeweled crown; that shot no honest blaze of\r\nruddy rubies; nor looked stern-white like Media’s pearls; but cast a\r\ngreen and yellow glare; rays from emeralds, crossing rays from many a\r\ntopaz. In those beams, so sinister, all present looked cadaverous:\r\nAbrazza’s cheek alone beamed bright, but hectic.\r\n\r\nUpon its fragrant mats a spacious hall received the kings; and\r\ngathering courtiers blandly bowed; and gushing with soft flatteries,\r\nbreathed idol-incense round them.\r\n\r\nThe hall was terraced thrice; its elevated end was curtained; and\r\nthence, at every chime of words, there burst a girl, gay scarfed, with\r\nnaked bosom, and poured forth wild and hollow laughter, as she raced\r\ndown all the terraces, and passed their merry kingships.\r\n\r\nWide round the hall, in avenues, waved almond-woods; their whiteness\r\nfrosted into bloom. But every vine-clad trunk was hollow-hearted;\r\nhollow sounds came from the grottos: hollow broke the billows on the\r\nshore: and hollow pauses filled the air, following the hollow laughter.\r\n\r\nGuards, with spears, paced the groves, and in the inner shadows, oft\r\nwere seen to lift their weapons, and backward press some ugly phantom,\r\nsaying, “Subjects! haunt him not; Abrazza would be merry; Abrazza\r\nfeasts his guests.”\r\n\r\nSo, banished from our sight seemed all things uncongenial; and pleasant\r\ntimes were ours, in these dominions. Not a face passed by, but smiled;\r\nmocking-birds perched on the boughs; and singing, made us vow the woods\r\nwere warbling forth thanksgiving, with a thousand throats! The stalwart\r\nyeomen grinned beneath their trenchers, heaped with citrons\r\npomegrantes, grapes; the pages tittered, pouring out the wine; and all\r\nthe lords loud laughed, smote their gilded spears, and swore the isle\r\nwas glad.\r\n\r\nSuch the isle, in which we tarried; but in our rambles, found no\r\nYillah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVI.\r\nSome Pleasant, Shady Talk In The Groves, Between My Lords Abrazza And\r\nMedia, Babbalanja, Mohi, And Yoomy\r\n\r\n\r\nAbrazza had a cool retreat—a grove of dates; where we were used to\r\nlounge of noons, and mix our converse with the babble of the rills; and\r\nmix our punches in goblets chased with grapes. And as ever, King\r\nAbrazza was the prince of hosts.\r\n\r\n“Your crown,” he said to Media; and with his own, he hung it on a\r\nbough.\r\n\r\n“Be not ceremonious:” and stretched his royal legs upon the turf.\r\n\r\n“Wine!” and his pages poured it out.\r\n\r\nSo on the grass we lounged; and King Abrazza, who loved his antique\r\nancestors; and loved old times; and would not talk of moderns;—bade\r\nYoomy sing old songs; bade Mohi rehearse old histories; bade Babbalanja\r\ntell of old ontologies; and commanded all, meanwhile, to drink his old,\r\nold wine.\r\n\r\nSo, all round we quaffed and quoted.\r\n\r\nAt last, we talked of old Homeric bards:—those who, ages back, harped,\r\nand begged, and groped their blinded way through all this charitable\r\nMardi; receiving coppers then, and immortal glory now.\r\n\r\nABRAZZA—How came it, that they all were blind?\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—It was endemical, your Highness. Few grand poets have good\r\neyes; for they needs blind must be, who ever gaze upon the sun. Vavona\r\nhimself was blind: when, in the silence of his secret bower, he said—“I\r\nwill build another world. Therein, let there be kings and slaves,\r\nphilosophers and wits; whose checkered actions—strange, grotesque, and\r\nmerry-sad, will entertain my idle moods.” So, my lord, Vavona played at\r\nkings and crowns, and men and manners; and loved that lonely game to\r\nplay.\r\n\r\nABRAZZA—Vavona seemed a solitary Mardian; who seldom went abroad; had\r\nfew friends; and shunning others, was shunned by them.\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—But shunned not himself, my lord; like gods, great poets\r\ndwell alone; while round them, roll the worlds they build.\r\n\r\nMEDIA—You seem to know all authors:—you must have heard of Lombardo,\r\nBabbalanja; he who flourished many ages since.\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—I have; and his grand Kortanza know by heart.\r\n\r\nMEDIA (_to Abrazza._)—A very curious work, that, my lord.\r\n\r\nABRAZZA—Yes, my dearest king. But, Babbalanja, if Lombardo had aught to\r\ntell to Mardi—why choose a vehicle so crazy?\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—It was his nature, I suppose.\r\n\r\nABRAZZA—But so it would not have been, to me.\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—Nor would it have been natural, for my noble lord Abrazza,\r\nto have worn Lombardo’s head:—every man has his own, thank Oro!\r\n\r\nABBRAZZA—A curious work: a very curious work. Babbalanja, are you\r\nacquainted with the history of Lombardo?\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—None better. All his biographies have I read.\r\n\r\nABRAZZA—Then, tell us how he came to write that work. For one, I can\r\nnot imagine how those poor devils contrive to roll such thunders\r\nthrough all Mardi.\r\n\r\nMEDIA—Their thunder and lightning seem spontaneous combustibles, my\r\nlord.\r\n\r\nABRAZZA—With which, they but consume themselves, my prince beloved.\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—In a measure, true, your Highness. But pray you, listen; and\r\nI will try to tell the way in which Lombardo produced his great\r\nKortanza.\r\n\r\nMEDIA—But hark you, philosopher! this time no incoherencies; gag that\r\ndevil, Azzageddi. And now, what was it that originally impelled\r\nLombardo to the undertaking?\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—Primus and forever, a full heart:—brimful, bubbling,\r\nsparkling; and running over like the flagon in your hand, my lord.\r\nSecundo, the necessity of bestirring himself to procure his yams.\r\n\r\nABRAZZA—Wanting the second motive, would the first have sufficed,\r\nphilosopher?\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—Doubtful. More conduits than one to drain off the soul’s\r\noverflowings. Besides, the greatest fullnesses overflow not\r\nspontaneously; and, even when decanted, like rich syrups, slowly ooze;\r\nwhereas, poor fluids glibly flow, wide-spreading. Hence, when great\r\nfullness weds great indolence;—that man, to others, too often proves a\r\ncipher; though, to himself, his thoughts form an Infinite Series,\r\nindefinite, from its vastness; and incommunicable;—not for lack of\r\npower, but for lack of an omnipotent volition, to move his strength.\r\nHis own world is full before him; the fulcrum set; but lever there is\r\nnone. To such a man, the giving of any boor’s resoluteness, with\r\ntendons braided, would be as hanging a claymore to Valor’s side, before\r\nunarmed. Our minds are cunning, compound mechanisms; and one spring, or\r\nwheel, or axle wanting, the movement lags, or halts. Cerebrum must not\r\noverbalance cerebellum; our brains should be round as globes; and\r\nplanted on capacious chests, inhaling mighty morning- inspirations. We\r\nhave had vast developments of parts of men; but none of manly wholes.\r\nBefore a full-developed man, Mardi would fall down and worship. We are\r\nidiot, younger-sons of gods, begotten in dotages divine; and our\r\nmothers all miscarry. Giants are in our germs; but we are dwarfs,\r\nstaggering under heads overgrown. Heaped, our measures burst. We die of\r\ntoo much life.\r\n\r\nMEDIA (_to Abrazza_)—Be not impatient, my lord; he’ll recover\r\npresently. You were talking of Lombardo, Babbalanja.\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—I was, your Highness. Of all Mardians, by nature, he was the\r\nmost inert. Hast ever seen a yellow lion, all day basking in the yellow\r\nsun:—in reveries, rending droves of elephants; but his vast loins\r\nsupine, and eyelids winking? Such, Lombardo; but fierce Want, the\r\nhunter, came and roused his roar. In hairy billows, his great mane\r\ntossed like the sea; his eyeballs flamed two hells; his paw had stopped\r\na rolling world.\r\n\r\nABRAZZA—In other words, yams were indispensable, and, poor devil, he\r\nroared to get them.\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA (_bowing_)—Partly so, my literal lord. And as with your own\r\ngolden scepter, at times upon your royal teeth, indolent tattoos you\r\nbeat; then, potent, sway it o’er your isle; so, Lombardo. And ere\r\nNecessity plunged spur and rowel into him, he knew not his own paces.\r\n_That_ churned him into consciousness; and brought ambition, ere then\r\ndormant, seething to the top, till he trembled at himself. No mailed\r\nhand lifted up against a traveler in woods, can so, appall, as we\r\nourselves. We are full of ghosts and spirits; we are as grave-yards\r\nfull of buried dead, that start to life before us. And all our dead\r\nsires, verily, are in us; _that_ is their immortality. From sire to\r\nson, we go on multiplying corpses in ourselves; for all of which, are\r\nresurrections. Every thought’s a soul of some past poet, hero, sage. We\r\nare fuller than a city. Woe it is, that reveals these things. He knows\r\nhimself, and all that’s in him, who knows adversity. To scale great\r\nheights, we must come out of lowermost depths. The way to heaven is\r\nthrough hell. We need fiery baptisms in the fiercest flames of our own\r\nbosoms. We must feel our hearts hot—hissing in us. And ere their fire\r\nis revealed, it must burn its way out of us; though it consume us and\r\nitself. Oh, sleek-cheeked Plenty! smiling at thine own dimples;—vain\r\nfor thee to reach out after greatness. Turn! turn! from all your tiers\r\nof cushions of eider-down—turn! and be broken on the wheels of many\r\nwoes. At white-heat, brand thyself; and count the scars, like old\r\nwar-worn veterans, over camp-fires. Soft poet! brushing tears from\r\nlilies—this way! and howl in sackcloth and in ashes! Know, thou, that\r\nthe lines that live are turned out of a furrowed brow. Oh! there is a\r\nfierce, a cannibal delight, in the grief that shrieks to multiply\r\nitself. That grief is miserly of its own; it pities all the happy. Some\r\ndamned spirits would not be otherwise, could they.\r\n\r\nABRAZZA (_to Media_)—Pray, my lord, is this good gentleman a devil?\r\n\r\nMEDIA.—No, my lord; but he’s possessed by one. His name is Azzageddi.\r\nYou may hear more of him. But come, Babbalanja, hast forgotten all\r\nabout Lombardo? How set he about that great undertaking, his Kortanza?\r\n\r\nABRAZZA (_to Media_)—Oh, for all the ravings of your Babbalanja,\r\nLombardo took no special pains; hence, deserves small commendation.\r\nFor, genius must be somewhat like us kings,—calm, content, in\r\nconsciousness of power. And to Lombardo, the scheme of his Kortanza\r\nmust have come full-fledged, like an eagle from the sun.\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—No, your Highness; but like eagles, his thoughts were first\r\ncallow; yet, born plumeless, they came to soar.\r\n\r\nABRAZZA—Very fine. I presume, Babbalanja, the first thing he did, was\r\nto fast, and invoke the muses.\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—Pardon, my lord; on the contrary he first procured a ream of\r\nvellum, and some sturdy quills: indispensable preliminaries, my\r\nworshipful lords, to the writing of the sublimest epics.\r\n\r\nABRAZZA—Ah! then the muses were afterward invoked.\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—Pardon again. Lombardo next sat down to a fine plantain\r\npudding.\r\n\r\nYOOMY—When the song-spell steals over me, I live upon olives.\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—Yoomy, Lombardo eschewed olives. Said he, “What fasting\r\nsoldier can fight? and the fight of all fights is to write.” In ten\r\ndays Lombardo had written—\r\n\r\nABRAZZA—Dashed off, you mean.\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—He never dashed off aught.\r\n\r\nABRAZZA—As you will.\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—In ten days, Lombardo had written full fifty folios; he\r\nloved huge acres of vellum whereon to expatiate.\r\n\r\nMEDIA—What then?\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—He read them over attentively; made a neat package of the\r\nwhole: and put it into the fire.\r\n\r\nALL—How?\r\n\r\nMEDIA—What! these great geniuses writing trash?\r\n\r\nABRAZZA—I thought as much.\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—My lords, they abound in it! more than any other men in\r\nMardi. Genius is full of trash. But genius essays its best to keep it\r\nto itself; and giving away its ore, retains the earth; whence, the too\r\nfrequent wisdom of its works, and folly of its life.\r\n\r\nABRAZZA—Then genius is not inspired, after all. How they must slave in\r\ntheir mines! I weep to think of it.\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—My lord, all men are inspired; fools are inspired; your\r\nhighness is inspired; for the essence of all ideas is infused. Of\r\nourselves, and in ourselves, we originate nothing. When Lombardo set\r\nabout his work, he knew not what it would become. He did not build\r\nhimself in with plans; he wrote right on; and so doing, got deeper and\r\ndeeper into himself; and like a resolute traveler, plunging through\r\nbaffling woods, at last was rewarded for his toils. “In good time,”\r\nsaith he, in his autobiography, “I came out into a serene, sunny,\r\nravishing region; full of sweet scents, singing birds, wild plaints,\r\nroguish laughs, prophetic voices. “Here we are at last, then,” he\r\ncried; “I have created the creative.” And now the whole boundless\r\nlandscape stretched away. Lombardo panted; the sweat was on his brow;\r\nhe off mantle; braced himself; sat within view of the ocean; his face\r\nto a cool rushing breeze; placed flowers before him; and gave himself\r\nplenty of room. On one side was his ream of vellum—\r\n\r\nABBRAZZA—And on the other, a brimmed beaker.\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—No, your Highness; though he loved it, no wine for Lombardo\r\nwhile actually at work.\r\n\r\nMOHI—Indeed? Why, I ever thought that it was to the superior quality of\r\nLombardo’s punches, that Mardi was indebted for that abounding humor of\r\nhis.\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—Not so; he had another way of keeping himself well braced.\r\n\r\nYOOMY—Quick! tell us the secret.\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—He never wrote by rush-light. His lamp swung in heaven.— He\r\nrose from his East, with the sun; he wrote when all nature was alive.\r\n\r\nMOHI—Doubtless, then, he always wrote with a grin; and none laughed\r\nlouder at his quips, than Lombardo himself.\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—Hear you laughter at the birth of a man child, old man? The\r\nbabe may have many dimples; not so, the parent. Lombardo was a hermit\r\nto behold.\r\n\r\nMEDIA—What! did Lombardo laugh with a long face?\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—His merriment was not always merriment to him, your\r\nHighness. For the most part, his meaning kept him serious. Then he was\r\nso intensely riveted to his work, he could not pause to laugh.\r\n\r\nMOHI—My word for it; but he had a sly one, now and then.\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—For the nonce, he was not his own master: a mere amanuensis\r\nwriting by dictation.\r\n\r\nYOOMY—Inspiration, that!\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA.—Call it as you will, Yoomy, it was a sort of sleep- walking\r\nof the mind. Lombardo never threw down his pen: it dropped from him;\r\nand then, he sat disenchanted: rubbing his eyes; staring; and feeling\r\nfaint—sometimes, almost unto death.\r\n\r\nMEDIA—But pray, Babbalanja, tell us how he made acquaintance with some\r\nof those rare worthies, he introduces us to, in his Koztanza.\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—He first met them in his reveries; they were walking about\r\nin him, sour and moody: and for a long time, were shy of his advances;\r\nbut still importuned, they at last grew ashamed of their reserve;\r\nstepped forward; and gave him their hands. After that, they were frank\r\nand friendly. Lombardo set places for them at his board; when he died,\r\nhe left them something in his will.\r\n\r\nMEDIA—What! those imaginary beings?\r\n\r\nABRAZZA—Wondrous witty! infernal fine!\r\n\r\nMEDIA—But, Babbalanja; after all, the Koztanza found no favor in the\r\neyes of some Mardians.\r\n\r\nABRAZZA—Ay: the arch-critics Verbi and Batho denounced it.\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—Yes: on good authority, Verbi is said to have detected a\r\nsuperfluous comma; and Batho declared that, with the materials he could\r\nhave constructed a far better world than Lombardo’s. But, didst ever\r\nhear of his laying his axis?\r\n\r\nABRAZZA—But the unities; Babbalanja, the unities! they are wholly\r\nwanting in the Koztanza.\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—Your Highness; upon that point, Lombardo was frank. Saith\r\nhe, in his autobiography: “For some time, I endeavored to keep in the\r\ngood graces of those nymphs; but I found them so captious, and\r\nexacting; they threw me into such a violent passion with their\r\nfault-findings; that, at last, I renounced them.”\r\n\r\nABRAZZA—Very rash!\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—No, your Highness; for though Lombardo abandoned all\r\nmonitors from without; he retained one autocrat within—his crowned and\r\nsceptered instinct. And what, if he pulled down one gross world, and\r\nransacked the etherial spheres, to build up something of his own—a\r\ncomposite:—what then? matter and mind, though matching not, are mates;\r\nand sundered oft, in his Koztanza they unite:—the airy waist, embraced\r\nby stalwart arms.\r\n\r\nMEDIA—Incoherent again! I thought we were to have no more of this!\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—My lord Media, there are things infinite in the finite; and\r\ndualities in unities. Our eyes are pleased with the redness of the\r\nrose, but another sense lives upon its fragrance. Its redness you must\r\napproach, to view: its invisible fragrance pervades the field. So, with\r\nthe Koztanza. Its mere beauty is restricted to its form: its expanding\r\nsoul, past Mardi does embalm. Modak is Modako; but fogle-foggle is not\r\nfugle-fi.\r\n\r\nMEDIA (_to Abrazza_)—My lord, you start again; but ’tis only another\r\nphase of Azzageeddi; sometimes he’s quite mad. But all this you must\r\nneeds overlook.\r\n\r\nABRAZZA—I will, my dear prince; what one can not see through, one must\r\nneeds look over, as you say.\r\n\r\nYOOMY—But trust me, your Highness, some of those strange things fall\r\nfar too melodiously upon the ear, to be wholly deficient in meaning.\r\n\r\nABRAZZA—Your gentle minstrel, _this_ must be, my lord. But Babbalanja,\r\nthe Koztanza lacks cohesion; it is wild, unconnected, all episode.\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—And so is Mardi itself:—nothing but episodes; valleys and\r\nhills; rivers, digressing from plains; vines, roving all over; boulders\r\nand diamonds; flowers and thistles; forests and thickets; and, here and\r\nthere, fens and moors. And so, the world in the Koztanza.\r\n\r\nABRAZZA—Ay, plenty of dead-desert chapters there; horrible sands to\r\nwade through.\r\n\r\nMEDIA—Now, Babbalanja, away with your tropes; and tell us of the work,\r\ndirectly it was done. What did Lombardo then? Did he show it to any one\r\nfor an opinion?\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—Yes, to Zenzori; who asked him where he picked up so much\r\ntrash; to Hanto, who bade him not be cast down, it was pretty good; to\r\nLucree, who desired to know how much he was going to get for it; to\r\nRoddi, who offered a suggestion.\r\n\r\nMEDIA—And what was that?\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—That he had best make a faggot of the whole; and try again.\r\n\r\nABRAZZA—Very encouraging.\r\n\r\nMEDIA—Any one else?\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—To Pollo; who, conscious his opinion was sought, was thereby\r\npuffed up; and marking the faltering of Lombardo’s voice, when the\r\nmanuscript was handed him, straightway concluded, that the man who\r\nstood thus trembling at the bar, must needs be inferior to the judge.\r\nBut his verdict was mild. After sitting up all night over the work; and\r\ndiligently taking notes:—“Lombardo, my friend! here, take your sheets.\r\nI have run through them loosely. You might have done better; but then\r\nyou might have done worse. Take them, my friend; I have put in some\r\ngood things for you:”\r\n\r\nMEDIA—And who was Pollo?\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—Probably some one who lived in Lombardo’s time, and went by\r\nthat name. He is incidentally mentioned, and cursorily immortalized in\r\none of the posthumous notes to the Koztanza.\r\n\r\nMEDIA—What is said of him there?\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—Not much. In a very old transcript of the work—that of\r\nAldina—the note alludes to a brave line in the text, and runs thus:—\r\n“Diverting to tell, it was this passage that an old prosodist, one\r\nPollo, claimed for his own. He maintained he made a free-will offering\r\nof it to Lombardo. Several things are yet extant of this Pollo, who\r\ndied some weeks ago. He seems to have been one of those, who would do\r\ngreat things if they could; but are content to compass the small. He\r\nimagined, that the precedence of authors he had established in his\r\nlibrary, was their Mardi order of merit. He condemned the sublime poems\r\nof Vavona to his lowermost shelf. ‘Ah,’ thought he, ‘how we library\r\nprinces, lord it over these beggarly authors!’ Well read in the history\r\nof their woes, Pollo pitied them all, particularly the famous; and\r\nwrote little essays of his own, which he read to himself.”\r\n\r\nMEDIA—Well: and what said Lombardo to those good friends of his,—\r\nZenzori, Hanto, and Roddi?\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—Nothing. Taking home his manuscript, he glanced it over;\r\nmaking three corrections.\r\n\r\nABRAZZA—And what then?\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—Then, your Highness, he thought to try a conclave of\r\nprofessional critics; saying to himself, “Let them privately point out\r\nto me, now, all my blemishes; so that, what time they come to review me\r\nin public, all will be well.” But curious to relate, those professional\r\ncritics, for the most part, held their peace, concerning a work yet\r\nunpublished. And, with some generous exceptions, in their vague,\r\nlearned way, betrayed such base, beggarly notions of authorship, that\r\nLombardo could have wept, had tears been his. But in his very grief, he\r\nground his teeth. Muttered he, “They are fools. In their eyes, bindings\r\nnot brains make books. They criticise my tattered cloak, not my soul,\r\ncaparisoned like a charger. He is the great author, think they, who\r\ndrives the best bargain with his wares: and no bargainer am I. Because\r\nhe is old, they worship some mediocrity of an ancient, and mock at the\r\nliving prophet with the live coal on his lips. They are men who would\r\nnot be men, had they no books. Their sires begat them not; but the\r\nauthors they have read. Feelings they have none: and their very\r\nopinions they borrow. They can not say yea, nor nay, without first\r\nconsulting all Mardi as an Encyclopedia. And all the learning in them,\r\nis as a dead corpse in a coffin. Were they worthy the dignity of being\r\ndamned, I would damn them; but they are not. Critics?—Asses! rather\r\nmules!—so emasculated, from vanity, they can not father a true thought.\r\nLike mules, too, from dunghills, they trample down gardens of roses:\r\nand deem that crushed fragrance their own.—Oh! that all round the\r\ndomains of genius should lie thus unhedged, for such cattle to uproot!\r\nOh! that an eagle should be stabbed by a goose-quill! But at best, the\r\ngreatest reviewers but prey on my leavings. For I am critic and\r\ncreator; and as critic, in cruelty surpass all critics merely, as a\r\ntiger, jackals. For ere Mardi sees aught of mine, I scrutinize it\r\nmyself, remorseless as a surgeon. I cut right and left; I probe, tear,\r\nand wrench; kill, burn, and destroy; and what’s left after that, the\r\njackals are welcome to. It is I that stab false thoughts, ere hatched;\r\nI that pull down wall and tower, rejecting materials which would make\r\npalaces for others. Oh! could Mardi but see how we work, it would\r\nmarvel more at our primal chaos, than at the round world thence\r\nemerging. It would marvel at our scaffoldings, scaling heaven; marvel\r\nat the hills of earth, banked all round our fabrics ere completed.—How\r\nplain the pyramid! In this grand silence, so intense, pierced by that\r\npointed mass,—could ten thousand slaves have ever toiled? ten thousand\r\nhammers rung?—There it stands, —part of Mardi: claiming kin with\r\nmountains;—was this thing piecemeal built?—It was. Piecemeal?—atom by\r\natom it was laid. The world is made of mites.”\r\n\r\nYOOMY (_musing._)—It is even so.\r\n\r\nABRAZZA—Lombardo was severe upon the critics; and they as much so upon\r\nhim;—of that, be sure.\r\n\r\nBABBALANGA—Your Highness, Lombardo never presumed to criticise true\r\ncritics; who are more rare than true poets. A great critic is a sultan\r\namong satraps; but pretenders are thick as ants, striving to scale a\r\npalm, after its aerial sweetness. And they fight among themselves.\r\nEssaying to pluck eagles, they themselves are geese, stuck full of\r\nquills, of which they rob each other.\r\n\r\nABRAZZA (_to Media._)—Oro help the victim that falls in Babbalanja’s\r\nhands!\r\n\r\nMEDIA.—Ay, my lord; at times, his every finger is a dagger: every\r\nthought a falling tower that whelms! But resume, philosopher—what of\r\nLombardo now?\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—“For this thing,” said he, “I have agonized over it\r\nenough.—I can wait no more. It has faults—all mine;—its merits all its\r\nown;—but I can toil no longer. The beings knit to me implore; my heart\r\nis full; my brain is sick. Let it go—let it go—and Oro with it.\r\nSomewhere Mardi has a mighty heart—-_that_ struck, all the isles shall\r\nresound!”\r\n\r\nABRAZZA—Poor devil! he took the world too hard.\r\n\r\nMEDIA.-As most of these mortals do, my lord. That’s the load, self-\r\nimposed, under which Babbalanja reels. But now, philosopher, ere Mardi\r\nsaw it, what thought Lombardo of his work, looking at it objectively,\r\nas a thing out of him, I mean.\r\n\r\nABRAZZA—No doubt, he hugged it.\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—Hard to answer. Sometimes, when by himself, he thought\r\nhugely of it, as my lord Abrazza says; but when abroad, among men, he\r\nalmost despised it; but when he bethought him of those parts, written\r\nwith full eyes, half blinded; temples throbbing; and pain at the heart—\r\n\r\nABRAZZA—Pooh! pooh!\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—He would say to himself, “Sure, it can not be in vain!” Yet\r\nagain, when he bethought him of the hurry and bustle of Mardi,\r\ndejection stole over him. “Who will heed it,” thought he; “what care\r\nthese fops and brawlers for me? But am I not myself an egregious\r\ncoxcomb? Who will read me? Say one thousand pages—twenty-five lines\r\neach—every line ten words—every word ten letters. That’s two million\r\nfive hundred thousand _a_’s, and _i_’s, and _o_’s to read! How many are\r\nsuperfluous? Am I not mad to saddle Mardi with such a task? Of all men,\r\nam I the wisest, to stand upon a pedestal, and teach the mob? Ah, my\r\nown Kortanza! child of many prayers!—in whose earnest eyes, so\r\nfathomless, I see my own; and recall all past delights and silent\r\nagonies-thou may’st prove, as the child of some fond dotard:— beauteous\r\nto me; hideous to Mardi! And methinks, that while so much slaving\r\nmerits that thou should’st not die; it has not been intense, prolonged\r\nenough, for the high meed of immortality. Yet, things immortal have\r\nbeen written; and by men as me;—men, who slept and waked; and ate; and\r\ntalked with tongues like mine. Ah, Oro! how may we know or not, we are\r\nwhat we would be? Hath genius any stamp and imprint, obvious to\r\npossessors? Has it eyes to see itself; or is it blind? Or do we delude\r\nourselves with being gods, and end in grubs? Genius, genius?—a thousand\r\nyears hence, to be a household-word?—I?— Lombardo? but yesterday cut in\r\nthe market-place by a spangled fool!— Lombardo immortal?—Ha, ha,\r\nLombardo! but thou art an ass, with vast ears brushing the tops of\r\npalms! Ha, ha, ha! Methinks I see thee immortal! ‘Thus great Lombardo\r\nsaith; and thus; and thus; and thus:— thus saith he—illustrious\r\nLombardo!—Lombardo, our great countryman! Lombardo, prince of\r\npoets—Lombardo! great Lombardo!’—Ha, ha, ha!— go, go! dig thy grave,\r\nand bury thyself!”\r\n\r\nABRAZZA—He was very funny, then, at times.\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—Very funny, your Highness:—amazing jolly! And from my\r\nnethermost soul, would to Oro, thou could’st but feel one touch of that\r\njolly woe! It would appall thee, my Right Worshipful lord Abrazza!\r\n\r\nABRAZZA (_to Media_)—My dear lord, his teeth are marvelously white and\r\nsharp: some she-shark must have been his dam:—does he often grin thus?\r\nIt was infernal!\r\n\r\nMEDIA—Ah! that’s Azzageddi. But, prithee, Babbalanja, proceed.\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—Your Highness, even in his calmer critic moods, Lombardo was\r\nfar from fancying his work. He confesses, that it ever seemed to him\r\nbut a poor scrawled copy of something within, which, do what he would,\r\nhe could not completely transfer. “My canvas was small,” said he;\r\n“crowded out were hosts of things that came last. But Fate is in it.”\r\nAnd Fate it was, too, your Highness, which forced Lombardo, ere his\r\nwork was well done, to take it off his easel, and send it to be\r\nmultiplied. “Oh, that I was not thus spurred!” cried he; “but like many\r\nanother, in its very childhood, this poor child of mine must go out\r\ninto Mardi, and get bread for its sire.”\r\n\r\nABRAZZA (_with a sigh_)—Alas, the poor devil! But methinks ’twas\r\nwondrous arrogant in him to talk to all Mardi at that lofty rate.—Did\r\nhe think himself a god?\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA—He himself best knew what he thought; but, like all others,\r\nhe was created by Oro to some special end; doubtless, partly answered\r\nin his Koztanza.\r\n\r\nMEDIA—And now that Lombardo is long dead and gone—and his work, hooted\r\nduring life, lives after him—what think the present company of it?\r\nSpeak, my lord Abrazza! Babbalanja! Mohi! Yoomy!\r\n\r\nABRAZZA (_tapping his sandal with his scepter__)—I never read it.\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA (_looking upward_)—It was written with a divine intent.\r\n\r\nMohi (_stroking his beard_)—I never hugged it in a corner, and ignored\r\nit before Mardi.\r\n\r\nYoomy (_musing_)—It has bettered my heart.\r\n\r\nMEDIA (_rising_)—And I have read it through nine times.\r\n\r\nBABBALANJA (_starting up_)—Ah, Lombardo! this must make thy ghost glad!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVII.\r\nThey Sup\r\n\r\n\r\nThere seemed something sinister, hollow, heartless, about Abrazza, and\r\nthat green-and-yellow, evil-starred crown that he wore.\r\n\r\nBut why think of that? Though we like not something in the curve of\r\none’s brow, or distrust the tone of his voice; yet, let us away with\r\nsuspicions if we may, and make a jolly comrade of him, in the name of\r\nthe gods. Miserable! thrice miserable he, who is forever turning over\r\nand over one’s character in his mind, and weighing by nice avoirdupois,\r\nthe pros and the cons of his goodness and badness. For we are all good\r\nand bad. Give me the heart that’s huge as all Asia; and unless a man,\r\nbe a villain outright, account him one of the best tempered blades in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nThat night, in his right regal hall, King Abrazza received us. And in\r\nmerry good time a fine supper was spread.\r\n\r\nNow, in thus nocturnally regaling us, our host was warranted by many\r\nancient and illustrious examples.\r\n\r\nFor old Jove gave suppers; the god Woden gave suppers; the Hindoo deity\r\nBrahma gave suppers; the Red Man’s Great Spirit gave suppers:— chiefly\r\nvenison and game.\r\n\r\nAnd many distinguished mortals besides.\r\n\r\nAhasuerus gave suppers; Xerxes gave suppers; Montezuma gave suppers;\r\nPowhattan gave suppers; the Jews’ Passovers were suppers; the Pharaohs\r\ngave suppers; Julius Caesar gave suppers:—and rare ones they were;\r\nGreat Pompey gave suppers; Nabob Crassus gave suppers; and\r\nHeliogabalus, surnamed the Gobbler, gave suppers.\r\n\r\nIt was a common saying of old, that King Pluto gave suppers; some say\r\nhe is giving them still. If so, he is keeping tip-top company, old\r\nPluto:—Emperors and Czars; Great Moguls and Great Khans; Grand Lamas\r\nand Grand Dukes; Prince Regents and Queen Dowagers:—Tamerlane\r\nhob-a-nobbing with Bonaparte; Antiochus with Solyman the Magnificent;\r\nPisistratus pledging Pilate; Semiramis eating bon-bons with Bloody\r\nMary, and her namesake of Medicis; the Thirty Tyrants quaffing three to\r\none with the Council of Ten; and Sultans, Satraps, Viziers, Hetmans,\r\nSoldans, Landgraves, Bashaws, Doges, Dauphins, Infantas, Incas, and\r\nCaciques looking on.\r\n\r\nAgain: at Arbela, the conqueror of conquerors, conquering son of\r\nOlympia by Jupiter himself, sent out cards to his captains,—\r\nHephestion, Antigonus, Antipater, and the rest—to join him at ten,\r\np.m., in the Temple of Belus; there, to sit down to a victorious\r\nsupper, off the gold plate of the Assyrian High Priests. How\r\nmajestically he poured out his old Madeira that night!—feeling grand\r\nand lofty as the Himmalehs; yea, all Babylon nodded her towers in his\r\nsoul!\r\n\r\nSpread, heaped up, stacked with good things; and redolent of citrons\r\nand grapes, hilling round tall vases of wine; and here and there,\r\nwaving with fresh orange-boughs, among whose leaves, myriads of small\r\ntapers gleamed like fire-flies in groves,—Abrazza’s glorious board\r\nshowed like some banquet in Paradise: Ceres and Pomona presiding; and\r\njolly Bacchus, like a recruit with a mettlesome rifle, staggering back\r\nas he fires off the bottles of vivacious champagne.\r\n\r\nIn ranges, roundabout stood living candelabras:—lackeys, gayly\r\nbedecked, with tall torches in their hands; and at one end, stood\r\ntrumpeters, bugles at their lips.\r\n\r\n“This way, my dear Media!—this seat at my left—Noble Taji!—my right.\r\nBabbalanja!—Mohi—where you are. But where’s pretty Yoomy?— Gone to\r\nmeditate in the moonlight? ah!—Very good. Let the banquet begin. A\r\nblast there!”\r\n\r\nAnd charge all did.\r\n\r\nThe venison, wild boar’s meat, and buffalo-humps, were extraordinary;\r\nthe wine, of rare vintages, like bottled lightning; and the first\r\ncourse, a brilliant affair, went off like a rocket.\r\n\r\nBut as yet, Babbalanja joined not in the revels. His mood was on him;\r\nand apart he sat; silently eyeing the banquet; and ever and anon\r\nmuttering,—“Fogle-foggle, fugle-fi.—”\r\n\r\nThe first fury of the feast over, said King Media, pouring out from a\r\nheavy flagon into his goblet, “Abrazza, these suppers are wondrous fine\r\nthings.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, my dear lord, much better than dinners.”\r\n\r\n“So they are, so they are. The dinner-hour is the summer of the day:\r\nfull of sunshine, I grant; but not like the mellow autumn of supper. A\r\ndinner, you know, may go off rather stiffly; but invariably suppers are\r\njovial. At dinners, ’tis not till you take in sail, furl the cloth, bow\r\nthe lady-passengers out, and make all snug; ’tis not till then, that\r\none begins to ride out the gale with complacency. But at these\r\nsuppers—Good Oro! your cup is empty, my dear demi-god!—But at these\r\nsuppers, I say, all is snug and ship-shape before you begin; and when\r\nyou begin, you waive the beginning, and begin in the middle. And as for\r\nthe cloth,—but tell us, Braid-Beard, what that old king of Franko,\r\nLudwig the Fat, said of that matter. The cloth for suppers, you know.\r\nIt’s down in your chronicles.”\r\n\r\n“My lord,”—wiping his beard,—“Old Ludwig was of opinion, that at\r\nsuppers the cloth was superfluous, unless on the back of some jolly\r\ngood friar. Said he, ‘For one, I prefer sitting right down to the\r\nunrobed table.’”\r\n\r\n“High and royal authority, that of Ludwig the Fat,” said Babbalanja,\r\n“far higher than the authority of Ludwig the Great:—the one, only great\r\nby courtesy; the other, fat beyond a peradventure. But they are equally\r\nfamous; and in their graves, both on a par. For after devouring many a\r\nfair province, and grinding the poor of his realm, Ludwig the Great has\r\nlong since, himself, been devoured by very small worms, and ground into\r\nvery fine dust. And after stripping many a venison rib, Ludwig the Fat\r\nhas had his own polished and bleached in the Valley of Death; yea, and\r\nhis cranium chased with corrodings, like the carved flagon once held to\r\nits jaws.”\r\n\r\n“My lord! my lord!”—cried Abrazza to Media—“this ghastly devil of yours\r\ngrins worse than a skull. I feel the worms crawling over me!—By Oro we\r\nmust eject him!”\r\n\r\n“No, no, my lord. Let him sit there, as of old the Death’s-head graced\r\nthe feasts of the Pharaohs—let him sit—let him sit—for Death but\r\nimparts a flavor to Life—Go on: wag your tongue without fear,\r\nAzzageddi!—But come, Braid-Beard! let’s hear more of the Ludwigs.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, your Highness, of all the eighteen royal Ludwigs of\r\nFranko—”\r\n\r\n“Who like so many ten-pins, all in a row,” interposed Babbalanja— “have\r\nbeen bowled off the course by grim Death.”\r\n\r\n“Heed him not,” said Media—“go on.”\r\n\r\n“The Debonnaire, the Pious, the Stammerer, the Do-Nothing, the\r\nJuvenile, the Quarreler:—of all these, I say, Ludwig the Fat was the\r\nbest table-man of them all. Such a full orbed paunch was his, that no\r\nway could he devise of getting to his suppers, but by getting right\r\ninto them. Like the Zodiac his table was circular, and full in the\r\nmiddle he sat, like a sun;—all his jolly stews and ragouts revolving\r\naround him.”\r\n\r\n“Yea,” said Babbalanja, “a very round sun was Ludwig the Fat. No wonder\r\nhe’s down in the chronicles; several ells about the waist, and King of\r\ncups and Tokay. Truly, a famous king: three hundred-weight of lard,\r\nwith a diadem on top: lean brains and a fat doublet—a demijohn of a\r\ndemi-god!”\r\n\r\n“Is this to be longer borne?” cried Abrazza, starting up. “Quaff that\r\nsneer down, devil! on the instant! down with it, to the dregs! This\r\ncomes, my lord Media, of having a slow drinker at one’s board. Like an\r\niceberg, such a fellow frosts the whole atmosphere of a banquet, and is\r\nfelt a league off We must thrust him out. Guards!”\r\n\r\n“Back! touch him not, hounds!”—cried Media. “Your pardon, my lord, but\r\nwe’ll keep him to it; and melt him down in this good wine. Drink! I\r\ncommand it, drink, Babbalanja!”\r\n\r\n“And am I not drinking, my lord? Surely you would not that I should\r\nimbibe more than I can hold. The measure being full, all poured in\r\nafter that is but wasted. I am for being temperate in these things, my\r\ngood lord. And my one cup outlasts three of yours. Better to sip a\r\npint, than pour down a quart. All things in moderation are good;\r\nwhence, wine in moderation is good. But all things in excess are bad:\r\nwhence wine in excess is bad.”\r\n\r\n“Away with your logic and conic sections! Drink!—But no, no: I am too\r\nsevere. For of all meals a supper should be the most social and free.\r\nAnd going thereto we kings, my lord, should lay aside our scepters.— Do\r\nas you please Babbalanja.”\r\n\r\n“You are right, you are right, after all, my dear demi-god,” said\r\nAbrazza. “And to say truth, I seldom worry myself with the ways of\r\nthese mortals; for no thanks do we demi-gods get. We kings should be\r\never indifferent. Nothing like a cold heart; warm ones are ever\r\nchafing, and getting into trouble. I let my mortals here in this isle\r\ntake heed to themselves; only barring them out when they would thrust\r\nin their petitions. This very instant, my lord, my yeoman-guard is on\r\nduty without, to drive off intruders.—Hark!—what noise is that?—Ho, who\r\ncomes?”\r\n\r\nAt that instant, there burst into the hall, a crowd of spearmen, driven\r\nbefore a pale, ragged rout, that loudly invoked King Abrazza.\r\n\r\n“Pardon, my lord king, for thus forcing an entrance! But long in vain\r\nhave we knocked at thy gates! Our grievances are more than we can bear!\r\nGive ear to our spokesman, we beseech!”\r\n\r\nAnd from their tumultuous midst, they pushed forward a tall, grim,\r\npine-tree of a fellow, who loomed up out of the throng, like the Peak\r\nof Teneriffe among the Canaries in a storm.\r\n\r\n“Drive the knaves out! Ho, cowards, guards, turn about! charge upon\r\nthem! Away with your grievances! Drive them out, I say, drive them\r\nout!—High times, truly, my lord Media, when demi-gods are thus annoyed\r\nat their wine. Oh, who would reign over mortals!”\r\n\r\nSo at last, with much difficulty, the ragged rout were ejected; the\r\nPeak of Teneriffe going last, a pent storm on his brow; and muttering\r\nabout some black time that was corning.\r\n\r\nWhile the hoarse murmurs without still echoed through the hall, King\r\nAbrazza refilling his cup thus spoke:—“You were saying, my dear lord,\r\nthat of all meals a supper is the most social and free. Very true. And\r\nof all suppers those given by us bachelor demi-gods are the best. Are\r\nthey not?”\r\n\r\n“They are. For Benedict mortals must be home betimes: bachelor\r\ndemi-gods are never away.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, your Highnesses, bachelors are all the year round at home;” said\r\nMohi: “sitting out life in the chimney corner, cozy and warm as the\r\ndog, whilome turning the old-fashioned roasting jack.”\r\n\r\n“And to us bachelor demi-gods,” cried Media “our to-morrows are as long\r\nrows of fine punches, ranged on a board, and waiting the hand.”\r\n\r\n“But my good lords,” said Babbalanja, now brightening with wine; “if,\r\nof all suppers those given by bachelors be the best:—of all bachelors,\r\nare not your priests and monks the jolliest? I mean, behind the scenes?\r\nTheir prayers all said, and their futurities securely invested,—who so\r\ncarefree and cozy as they? Yea, a supper for two in a friar’s cell in\r\nMaramma, is merrier far, than a dinner for five-and-twenty, in the\r\nbroad right wing of Donjalolo’s great Palace of the Morn.”\r\n\r\n“Bravo, Babbalanja!” cried Media, “your iceberg is thawing. More of\r\nthat, more of that. Did I not say, we would melt him down at last, my\r\nlord?”\r\n\r\n“Ay,” continued Babbalanja, “bachelors are a noble fraternity: I’m a\r\nbachelor myself. One of ye, in that matter, my lord demi-gods. And if\r\nunlike the patriarchs of the world, we father not our brigades and\r\nbattalions; and send not out into the battles of our country whole\r\nregiments of our own individual raising;—yet do we oftentimes leave\r\nbehind us goodly houses and lands; rare old brandies and mountain\r\nMalagas; and more especially, warm doublets and togas, and\r\nspatterdashes, wherewithal to keep comfortable those who survive us;—\r\ncasing the legs and arms, which others beget. Then compare not\r\ninvidiously Benedicts with bachelors, since thus we make an equal\r\ndivision of the duties, which both owe to posterity.”\r\n\r\n“Suppers forever!” cried Media. “See, my lord, what yours has done for\r\nBabbalanja. He came to it a skeleton; but will go away, every bone\r\npadded!”\r\n\r\n“Ay, my lord demi-gods,” said Babbalanja, drop by drop refilling his\r\ngoblet. “These suppers are all very fine, very pleasant, and merry. But\r\nwe pay for them roundly. Every thing, my good lords, has its price,\r\nfrom a marble to a world. And easier of digestion, and better for both\r\nbody and soul, are a half-haunch of venison and a gallon of mead, taken\r\nunder the sun at meridian, than the soft bridal breast of a partridge,\r\nwith some gentle negus, at the noon of night!”\r\n\r\n“No lie that!” said Mohi. “Beshrew me, in no well-appointed mansion\r\ndoth the pantry lie adjoining the sleeping chamber. A good thought:\r\nI’ll fill up, and ponder on it.”\r\n\r\n“Let not Azzageddi get uppermost again, Babbalanja,” cried Media. “Your\r\ngoblet is only half-full.”\r\n\r\n“Permit it to remain so; my lord. For whoso takes much wine to bed with\r\nhim, has a bedfellow, more restless than a somnambulist. And though\r\nWine be a jolly blade at the board, a sulky knave is he under a\r\nblanket. I know him of old. Yet, your Highness, for all this, to many a\r\nMardian, suppers are still better than dinners, at whatever cost\r\npurchased. Forasmuch, as many have more leisure to sup, than dine. And\r\nthough you demi-gods, may dine at your ease; and dine it out into\r\nnight: and sit and chirp over your Burgundy, till the morning larks\r\njoin your crickets, and wed matins to vespers;—far otherwise, with us\r\nplebeian mortals. From our dinners, we must hie to our anvils: and the\r\nlast jolly jorum evaporates in a cark and a care.”\r\n\r\n“Methinks he relapses,” said Abrazza.\r\n\r\n“It waxes late,” said Mohi; “your Highnesses, is it not time to break\r\nup?”\r\n\r\n“No, no!”, cried Abrazza; “let the day break when it will: but no\r\nbreakings for us. It’s only midnight. This way with the wine; pass it\r\nalong, my dear Media. We are young yet, my sweet lord; light hearts and\r\nheavy purses; short prayers and long rent-rolls. Pass round the Tokay!\r\nWe demi-gods have all our old age for a dormitory. Come!—Round and\r\nround with the flagons! Let them disappear like mile-stones on a\r\nrace-course!”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” murmured Babbalanja, holding his full goblet at arm’s length on\r\nthe board, “not thus with the hapless wight, born with a hamper on his\r\nback, and blisters in his palms.—Toil and sleep—sleep and toil, are his\r\ndays and his nights; he goes to bed with a lumbago, and wakes with the\r\nrheumatics;—I know what it is;—he snatches lunches, not dinners, and\r\nmakes of all life a cold snack! Yet praise be to Oro, though to such\r\nmen dinners are scarce worth the eating; nevertheless, praise Oro\r\nagain, a good supper is something. Off jack-boots; nay, off shirt, if\r\nyou will, and go at it. Hurrah! the fagged day is done: the last blow\r\nis an echo. Twelve long hours to sunrise! And would it were an\r\nAntarctic night, and six months to to-morrow! But, hurrah! the very\r\nbees have their hive, and after a day’s weary wandering, hie home to\r\ntheir honey. So they stretch out their stiff legs, rub their lame\r\nelbows, and putting their tired right arms in a sling, set the others\r\nto fetching and carrying from dishes to dentals, from foaming flagon to\r\nthe demijohn which never pours out at the end you pour in. Ah! after\r\nall, the poorest devil in Mardi lives not in vain. There’s a soft side\r\nto the hardest oak-plank in the world!”\r\n\r\n“Methinks I have heard some such sentimental gabble as this before from\r\nmy slaves, my lord,” said Abrazza to Media. “It has the old gibberish\r\nflavor.”\r\n\r\n“Gibberish, your Highness? Gibberish? I’m full of it—I’m a gibbering\r\nghost, my right worshipful lord! Here, pass your hand through me— here,\r\n_here_, and scorch it where I most burn. By Oro! King! but I will gibe\r\nand gibber at thee, till thy crown feels like another skull clapped on\r\nthy own. Gibberish? ay, in hell we’ll gibber in concert, king! we’ll\r\nhowl, and roast, and hiss together!”\r\n\r\n“Devil that thou art, begone! Ho, guards! seize him!”\r\n\r\n“Back, curs!” cried Media. “Harm not a hair of his head. I crave\r\npardon, King Abrazza, but no violence must be done Babbalanja.”\r\n\r\n“Trumpets there!” said Abrazza; “so: the banquet is done—lights for\r\nKing Media! Good-night, my lord!”\r\n\r\nNow, thus, for the nonce, with good cheer, we close. And after many\r\nfine dinners and banquets—through light and through shade; through\r\nmirth, sorrow, and all—drawing nigh to the evening end of these\r\nwanderings wild—meet is it that all should be regaled with a supper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVIII.\r\nThey Embark\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning, King Abrazza sent frigid word to Media that the day was\r\nvery fine for yachting; but he much regretted that indisposition would\r\nprevent his making one of the party, who that morning doubtless would\r\ndepart his isle.\r\n\r\n“My compliments to your king,” said Media to the chamberlains, “and say\r\nthe royal notice to quit was duly received.”\r\n\r\n“Take Azzageddi’s also,” said Babbalanja; “and say, I hope his Highness\r\nwill not fail in his appointment with me:—the first midnight after he\r\ndies; at the grave-yard corner;—there I’ll be, and grin again!”\r\n\r\nSailing on, the next land we saw was thickly wooded: hedged round about\r\nby mangrove trees; which growing in the water, yet lifted high their\r\nboughs. Here and there were shady nooks, half verdure and half water.\r\nFishes rippled, and canaries sung.\r\n\r\n“Let us break through, my lord,” said Yoomy, “and seek the shore. Its\r\nsolitudes must prove reviving.” “Solitudes they are,” cried Mohi.\r\n\r\n“Peopled but not enlivened,” said Babbalanja. “Hard landing here,\r\nminstrel! see you not the isle is hedged?”\r\n\r\n“Why, break through, then,” said Media. “Yillah is not here.”\r\n\r\n“I mistrusted it,” sighed Yoomy; “an imprisoned island! full of\r\nuncomplaining woes: like many others we must have glided by,\r\nunheedingly. Yet of them have I heard. This isle many pass, marking its\r\noutward brightness, but dreaming not of the sad secrets here embowered.\r\nHaunt of the hopeless! In those inland woods brood Mardians who have\r\ntasted Mardi, and found it bitter—the draught so sweet to\r\nothers!—maidens whose unimparted bloom has cankered in the bud; and\r\nchildren, with eyes averted from life’s dawn—like those new-oped\r\nmorning blossoms which, foreseeing storms, turn and close.”\r\n\r\n“Yoomy’s rendering of the truth,” said Mohi.\r\n\r\n“Why land, then?” said Media. “No merry man of sense—no demi-god like\r\nme, will do it. Let’s away; let’s see all that’s pleasant, or that\r\nseems so, in our circuit, and, if possible, shun the sad.”\r\n\r\n“Then we have circled not the round reef wholly,” said Babbalanja, “but\r\nmade of it a segment. For this is far from being the first sad land, my\r\nlord, that we have slighted at your instance.”\r\n\r\n“No more. I will have no gloom. A chorus! there, ye paddlers! spread\r\nall your sails; ply paddles; breeze up, merry winds!”\r\n\r\nAnd so, in the saffron sunset, we neared another shore.\r\n\r\nA gloomy-looking land! black, beetling crags, rent by volcanic clefts;\r\nploughed up with water-courses, and dusky with charred woods. The beach\r\nwas strewn with scoria and cinders; in dolorous soughs, a chill wind\r\nblew; wails issued from the caves; and yellow, spooming surges, lashed\r\nthe moaning strand.\r\n\r\n“Shall we land?” said Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n“Not here,” cried Yoomy; “no Yillah here.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Media. “This is another of those lands far better to avoid.”\r\n\r\n“Know ye not,” said Mohi, “that here are the mines of King Klanko,\r\nwhose scourged slaves, toiling in their pits, so nigh approach the\r\nvolcano’s bowels, they hear its rumblings? ‘Yet they must work on,’\r\ncries Klanko, ‘the mines still yield!’ And daily his slaves’ bones are\r\nbrought above ground, mixed with the metal masses.”\r\n\r\n“Set all sail there, men! away!”\r\n\r\n“My lord,” said Babbalanja; “still must we shun the unmitigated evil;\r\nand only view the good; or evil so mixed therewith, the mixture’s\r\nboth?”\r\n\r\nHalf vailed in misty clouds, the harvest-moon now rose; and in that\r\npale and haggard light, all sat silent; each man in his own secret\r\nmood: best knowing his own thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIX.\r\nBabbalanja At The Full Of The Moon\r\n\r\n\r\n“Ho, mortals! Go we to a funeral, that our paddles seem thus muffled?\r\nUp heart, Taji! or does that witch Hautia haunt thee? Be a demi-god\r\nonce more, and laugh. Her flowers are not barbs; and the avengers’\r\narrows are too blunt to slay. Babbalanja! Mohi! Yoomy! up heart! up\r\nheart!—By Oro! I will debark the whole company on the next land we\r\nmeet. No tears for me. Ha, ha! let us laugh. Ho, Vee-Vee! awake; quick,\r\nboy,—some wine! and let us make glad, beneath the glad moon. Look! it\r\nis stealing forth from its clouds. Perdition to Hautia! Long lives, and\r\nmerry ones to ourselves! Taji, my charming fellow, here’s to you:—May\r\nyour heart be a stone! Ha, ha!—will nobody join me? My laugh is lonely\r\nas his who laughed in his tomb. Come, laugh; will no one quaff wine, I\r\nsay? See! the round moon is abroad.”\r\n\r\n“Say you so, my lord? then for one, I am with you;” cried Babbalanja.\r\n“Fill me a brimmer. Ah! but this wine leaps through me like a panther.\r\nAy, let us laugh: let us roar: let us yell! What, if I was sad but just\r\nnow? Life is an April day, that both laughs and weeps in a breath. But\r\nwhoso is wise, laughs when he can. Men fly from a groan; but run to a\r\nlaugh. Vee-Vee! your gourd. My lord, let me help you. Ah, how it\r\nsparkles! Cups, cups, Vee-Vee, more cups! Here, Taji, take that: Mohi,\r\ntake that: Yoomy, take that. And now let us drown away grief. Ha! ha!\r\nthe house of mourning, is deserted, though of old good cheer kept the\r\nfuneral guests; and so keep I mine; here I sit by my dead, and\r\nreplenish your wine cups. Old Mohi, your cup: Yoomy, yours: ha! ha! let\r\nus laugh, let us scream! Weeds are put off at a fair; no heart bursts\r\nbut in secret; it is good to laugh, though the laugh be hollow; and\r\nwise to make merry, now and for aye. Laugh, and make friends: weep, and\r\nthey go. Women sob, and are rid of their grief: men laugh, and retain\r\nit. There is laughter in heaven, and laughter in hell. And a deep\r\nthought whose language is laughter. Though wisdom be wedded to woe,\r\nthough the way thereto is by tears, yet all ends in a shout. But wisdom\r\nwears no weeds; woe is more merry than mirth; ’tis a shallow grief that\r\nis sad. Ha! ha! how demoniacs shout; how all skeletons grin; we all die\r\nwith a rattle. Laugh! laugh! Are the cherubim grave? Humor, thy laugh\r\nis divine; whence, mirth-making idiots have been revered; and therefore\r\nmay I. Ho! let us be gay, if it be only for an hour, and Death hand us\r\nthe goblet. Vee-Vee! bring on your gourds! Let us pledge each other in\r\nbumpers!—let us laugh, laugh, laugh it out to the last. All sages have\r\nlaughed,—let us; Bardianna laughed, let us; Demorkriti laughed,—let us:\r\nAmoree laughed,—let us; Rabeelee roared,—let us; the hyenas grin, the\r\njackals yell,—let us.—But you don’t laugh, my lord? laugh away!”\r\n\r\n“No, thank you, Azzageddi, not after that infernal fashion; better\r\nweep.”\r\n\r\n“He makes me crawl all over, as if I were an ant-hill,” said Mohi.\r\n\r\n“He’s mad, mad, mad!” cried Yoomy.\r\n\r\n“Ay, mad, mad, mad!—mad as the mad fiend that rides me!—But come, sweet\r\nminstrel, wilt list to a song?—We madmen are all poets, you know:—Ha!\r\nha!—\r\n\r\nStars laugh in the sky:\r\n    Oh fugle-fi I\r\nThe waves dimple below:\r\n    Oh fugle-fo!\r\n\r\n\r\n“The wind strikes her dulcimers; the groves give a shout; the hurricane\r\nis only an hysterical laugh; and the lightning that blasts, blasts only\r\nin play. We must laugh or we die; to laugh is to live. Not to laugh is\r\nto have the tetanus. Will you weep? then laugh while you weep. For\r\nmirth and sorrow are kin; are published by identical nerves. Go, Yoomy:\r\ngo study anatomy: there is much to be learned from the dead, more than\r\nyou may learn from the living and I am dead though I live; and as soon\r\ndissect myself as another; I curiously look into my secrets: and grope\r\nunder my ribs. I have found that the heart is not whole, but divided;\r\nthat it seeks a soft cushion whereon to repose; that it vitalizes the\r\nblood; which else were weaker than water: I have found that we can not\r\nlive without hearts; though the heartless live longest. Yet hug your\r\nhearts, ye handful that have them; ’tis a blessed inheritance! Thus,\r\nthus, my lord, I run on; from one pole to the other; from this thing to\r\nthat. But so the great world goes round, and in one Somerset, shows the\r\nsun twenty-five thousand miles of a landscape!”\r\n\r\nAt that instant, down went the fiery full-moon, and the Dog-Star; and\r\nfar down into Media, a Tivoli of wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXX.\r\nMorning\r\n\r\n\r\nLife or death, weal or woe, the sun stays not his course. On: over\r\nbattle-field and bower; over tower, and town, he speeds,—peers in at\r\nbirths, and death-beds; lights up cathedral, mosque, and pagan\r\nshrine;—laughing over all;—a very Democritus in the sky; and in one\r\nbrief day sees more than any pilgrim in a century’s round.\r\n\r\nSo, the sun; nearer heaven than we:—with what mind, then, may blessed\r\nOro downward look.\r\n\r\nIt was a purple, red, and yellow East;—streaked, and crossed. And down\r\nfrom breezy mountains, robust and ruddy Morning came,—a plaided\r\nHighlander, waving his plumed bonnet to the isles.\r\n\r\nOver the neighboring groves the larks soared high; and soaring, sang in\r\njubilees; while across our bows, between two isles, a mighty moose swam\r\nstately as a seventy-four; and backward tossed his antlered wilderness\r\nin air.\r\n\r\nJust bounding from fresh morning groves, with the brine he mixed the\r\ndew of leaves,—his antlers dripping on the swell, that rippled before\r\nhis brown and bow-like chest.\r\n\r\n“Five hundred thousand centuries since,” said Babbalanja, “this same\r\nsight was seen. With Oro, the sun is co-eternal; and the same life that\r\nmoves that moose, animates alike the sun and Oro. All are parts of One.\r\nIn me, in _me_, flit thoughts participated by the beings peopling all\r\nthe stars. Saturn, and Mercury, and Mardi, are brothers, one and all;\r\nand across their orbits, to each other talk, like souls. Of these\r\nthings what chapters might be writ! Oh! that flesh can not keep pace\r\nwith spirit. Oh! that these myriad germ-dramas in me, should so perish\r\nhourly, for lack of power mechanic.—Worlds pass worlds in space, as\r\nmen, men,—in thoroughfares; and after periods of thousand years,\r\ncry:—“Well met, my friend, again!”—To me to _me_, they talk in mystic\r\nmusic; I hear them think through all their zones. —Hail, furthest\r\nworlds! and all the beauteous beings in ye! Fan me, sweet Zenora! with\r\nthy twilight wings!—Ho! let’s voyage to Aldebaran.—Ha! indeed, a ruddy\r\nworld! What a buoyant air! Not like to Mardi, this. Ruby columns:\r\nminarets of amethyst: diamond domes! Who is this?—a god? What a\r\nlake-like brow! transparent as the morning air. I see his thoughts like\r\nworlds revolving—and in his eyes—like unto heavens—soft falling stars\r\nare shooting.—How these thousand passing wings winnow away my breath:—I\r\nfaint:—back, back to some small asteroid.—Sweet being! if, by Mardian\r\nword I may address thee— speak!—‘I bear a soul in germ within me; I\r\nfeel the first, faint trembling, like to a harp-string, vibrate in my\r\ninmost being. Kill me, and generations die.’—So, of old, the unbegotten\r\nlived within the virgin; who then loved her God, as new-made mothers\r\ntheir babes ere born. Oh, Alma, Alma, Alma!—Fangs off, fiend!—will that\r\nname ever lash thee into foam?—Smite not my face so, forked flames!”\r\n\r\n“Babbalanja! Babbalanja! rouse, man! rouse! Art in hell and damned,\r\nthat thy sinews so snake-like coil and twist all over thee? Thy brow is\r\nblack as Ops! Turn, turn! see yonder moose!”\r\n\r\n“Hail! mighty brute!—thou feelest not these things: never canst _thou_\r\nbe damned. Moose! would thy soul were mine; for if that scorched thing,\r\nmine, be immortal—so thine; and thy life hath not the consciousness of\r\ndeath. I read profound placidity—deep—million— violet fathoms down, in\r\nthat soft, pathetic, woman eye! What is man’s shrunk form to thine,\r\nthou woodland majesty?—Moose, moose!—my soul is shot again—Oh, Oro!\r\nOro!”\r\n\r\n“He falls!” cried Media.\r\n\r\n“Mark the agony in his waning eye,” said Yoomy;—“alas, poor Babbalanja!\r\nIs this thing of madness conscious to thyself? If ever thou art sane\r\nagain, wilt thou have reminiscences? Take my robe:— here, I strip me to\r\ncover thee and all thy woes. Oro! by this, thy being’s side, I\r\nkneel:—grant death or happiness to Babbalanja!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXI.\r\nL’ultima Sera\r\n\r\n\r\nThus far, through myriad islands, had we searched: of all, no one pen\r\nmay write: least, mine;—and still no trace of Yillah.\r\n\r\nBut though my hopes revived not from their ashes; yet, so much of Mardi\r\nhad we searched, it seemed as if the long pursuit must, ere many moons,\r\nbe ended; whether for weal or woe, my frenzy sometimes reeked not.\r\n\r\nAfter its first fair morning flushings, all that day was overcast. We\r\nsailed upon an angry sea, beneath an angry sky. Deep scowled on deep;\r\nand in dun vapors, the blinded sun went down, unseen; though full\r\ntoward the West our three prows were pointed; steadfast as three\r\nprinted points upon the compass-card.\r\n\r\n“When we set sail from Odo, ’twas a glorious morn in spring,” said\r\nYoomy; “toward the rising sun we steered. But now, beneath autumnal\r\nnight-clouds, we hasten to its setting.”\r\n\r\n“How now?” cried Media; “why is the minstrel mournful?—He whose place\r\nit is to chase away despondency: not be its minister.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, my lord, so _thou_ thinkest. But better can my verses soothe the\r\nsad, than make them light of heart. Nor are we minstrels so gay of soul\r\nas Mardi deems us. The brook that sings the sweetest, murmurs through\r\nthe loneliest woods:\r\n\r\nThe isles hold thee not, thou departed!\r\n    From thy bower, now issues no lay:—\r\nIn vain we recall perished warblings:\r\n    Spring birds, to far climes, wing their way!”\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Yoomy thus sang; unmindful of the lay, with paddle plying, in low,\r\npleasant tones, thus hummed to himself our bowsman, a gamesome wight:—\r\n\r\nHo! merrily ho! we paddlers sail!\r\nHo! over sea-dingle, and dale!—\r\n    Our pulses fly,\r\n    Our hearts beat high,\r\nHo! merrily, merrily, ho!\r\n\r\n\r\nBut a sudden splash, and a shrill, gurgling sound, like that of a\r\nfountain subsiding, now broke upon the air. Then all was still, save\r\nthe rush of the waves by our keels.\r\n\r\n“Save him! Put back!”\r\n\r\nFrom his elevated seat, the merry bowsman, too gleefully reaching\r\nforward, had fallen into the lagoon.\r\n\r\nWith all haste, our speeding canoes were reversed; but not till we had\r\ndarted in upon another darkness than that in which the bowsman fell.\r\n\r\nAs, blindly, we groped back, deep Night dived deeper down in the sea.\r\n\r\n“Drop paddles all, and list.”\r\n\r\nHolding their breath, over the six gunwales all now leaned; but the\r\nonly moans were the wind’s.\r\n\r\nLong time we lay thus; then slowly crossed and recrossed our track,\r\nalmost hopeless; but yet loth to leave him who, with a song in his\r\nmouth, died and was buried in a breath.\r\n\r\n“Let us away,” said Media—“why seek more? He is gone.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, gone,” said Babbalanja, “and whither? But a moment since, he was\r\namong us: now, the fixed stars are not more remote than he. So far off,\r\ncan he live? Oh, Oro! this death thou ordainest, unmans the manliest.\r\nSay not nay, my lord. Let us not speak behind Death’s back. Hard and\r\nhorrible is it to die: blindfold to leap from life’s verge! But thus,\r\nin clouds of dust, and with a trampling as of hoofs, the generations\r\ndisappear; death driving them all into his treacherous fold, as wild\r\nIndians the bison herds. Nay, nay, Death is Life’s last despair. Hard\r\nand horrible is it to die. Oro himself, in Alma, died not without a\r\ngroan. Yet why, why live? Life is wearisome to all: the same dull\r\nround. Day and night, summer and winter, round about us revolving for\r\naye. One moment lived, is a life. No new stars appear in the sky; no\r\nnew lights in the soul. Yet, of changes there are many. For though,\r\nwith rapt sight, in childhood, we behold many strange things beneath\r\nthe moon, and all Mardi looks a tented fair— how soon every thing\r\nfades. All of us, in our very bodies, outlive our own selves. I think\r\nof green youth as of a merry playmate departed; and to shake hands, and\r\nbe pleasant with my old age, seems in prospect even harder, than to\r\ndraw a cold stranger to my bosom. But old age is not for me. I am not\r\nof the stuff that grows old. This Mardi is not our home. Up and down we\r\nwander, like exiles transported to a planet afar:—’tis not the world\r\n_we_ were born in; not the world once so lightsome and gay; not the\r\nworld where we once merrily danced, dined, and supped; and wooed, and\r\nwedded our long-buried wives. Then let us depart. But whither? We push\r\nourselves forward then, start back in affright. Essay it again, and\r\nflee. Hard to live; hard to die; intolerable suspense! But the grim\r\ndespot at last interposes; and with a viper in our winding-sheets, we\r\nare dropped in the sea.”\r\n\r\n“To me,” said Mohi, his gray locks damp with night-dews, “death’s dark\r\ndefile at times seems at hand, with no voice to cheer. That all have\r\ndied, makes it not easier for me to depart. And that many have been\r\nquenched in infancy seems a mercy to the slow perishing of my old age,\r\nlimb by limb and sense by sense. I have long been the tomb of my youth.\r\nAnd more has died out of me, already, than remains for the last death\r\nto finish. Babbalanja says truth. In childhood, death stirred me not;\r\nin middle age, it pursued me like a prowling bandit on the road; now,\r\ngrown an old man, it boldly leads the way; and ushers me on; and turns\r\nround upon me its skeleton gaze: poisoning the last solaces of life.\r\nMaramma but adds to my gloom.”\r\n\r\n“Death! death!” cried Yoomy, “must I be not, and millions be? Must I\r\ngo, and the flowers still bloom? Oh, I have marked what it is to be\r\ndead;—how shouting boys, of holidays, hide-and-seek among the tombs,\r\nwhich must hide all seekers at last.”\r\n\r\n“Clouds on clouds!” cried Media, “but away with them all! Why not leap\r\nyour graves, while ye may? Time to die, when death comes, without dying\r\nby inches. ’Tis no death, to die; the only death is the fear of it. I,\r\na demi-god, fear death not.”\r\n\r\n“But when the jackals howl round you?” said Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n“Drive them off! Die the demi-god’s death! On his last couch of crossed\r\nspears, my brave old sire cried, ‘Wine, wine; strike up, conch and\r\ncymbal; let the king die to martial melodies!’”\r\n\r\n“More valiant dying, than dead,” said Babbalanja. “Our end of the\r\nwinding procession resounds with music and flaunts with banners with\r\nbrave devices: ‘Cheer up!’ ‘Fear not!’ ‘Millions have died before!’—\r\nbut in the endless van, not a pennon streams; all there, is silent and\r\nsolemn. The last wisdom is dumb.”\r\n\r\nSilence ensued; during which, each dip of the paddles in the now calm\r\nwater, fell full and long upon the ear.\r\n\r\nAnon, lifting his head, Babbalanja thus:—“Yillah still eludes us. And\r\nin all this tour of Mardi, how little have we found to fill the heart\r\nwith peace: how much to slaughter all our yearnings.”\r\n\r\n“Croak no more, raven!” cried Media. “Mardi is full of spring-time\r\nsights, and jubilee sounds. I never was sad in my life.”\r\n\r\n“But for thy one laugh, my lord, how many groans! Were all happy, or\r\nall miserable,—more tolerable then, than as it is. But happiness and\r\nmisery are so broadly marked, that this Mardi may be the retributive\r\nfuture of some forgotten past.—Yet vain our surmises. Still vainer to\r\nsay, that all Mardi is but a means to an end; that this life is a state\r\nof probation: that evil is but permitted for a term; that for specified\r\nages a rebel angel is viceroy.—Nay, nay. Oro delegates his scepter to\r\nnone; in his everlasting reign there are no interregnums; and Time is\r\nEternity; and we live in Eternity now. Yet, some tell of a hereafter,\r\nwhere all the mysteries of life will be over; and the sufferings of the\r\nvirtuous recompensed. Oro is just, they say.—Then always,—now, and\r\nevermore. But to make restitution implies a wrong; and Oro can do no\r\nwrong. Yet what seems evil to us, may be good to him. If he fears not,\r\nnor hopes,—he has no other passion; no ends, no purposes. He lives\r\ncontent; all ends are compassed in Him; He has no past, no future; He\r\nis the everlasting now; which is an everlasting calm; and things that\r\nare, have been,— will be. This gloom’s enough. But hoot! hoot! the\r\nnight-owl ranges through the woodlands of Maramma; its dismal notes\r\npervade our lives; and when we would fain depart in peace, that bird\r\nflies on before:— cloud-like, eclipsing our setting suns, and filling\r\nthe air with dolor.”\r\n\r\n“Too true!” cried Yoomy. “Our calms must come by storms. Like helmless\r\nvessels, tempest-tossed, our only anchorage is when we founder.”\r\n\r\n“Our beginnings,” murmured Mohi, “are lost in clouds; we live in\r\ndarkness all our days, and perish without an end.”\r\n\r\n“Croak on, cowards!” cried Media, “and fly before the hideous phantoms\r\nthat pursue ye.”\r\n\r\n“No coward he, who hunted, turns and finds no foe to fight,” said\r\nBabbalanja. “Like the stag, whose brow is beat with wings of hawks,\r\nperched in his heavenward antlers; so I, blinded, goaded, headlong,\r\nrush! this way and that; nor knowing whither; one forest wide around!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXII.\r\nThey Sail From Night To Day\r\n\r\n\r\nEre long the three canoes lurched heavily in a violent swell. Like\r\npalls, the clouds swept to and fro, hooding the gibbering winds. At\r\nevery head-beat wave, our arching prows reared up, and shuddered; the\r\nnight ran out in rain.\r\n\r\nWhither to turn we knew not; nor what haven to gain; so dense the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nBut at last, the storm was over. Our shattered prows seemed gilded. Day\r\ndawned; and from his golden vases poured red wine upon the waters.\r\n\r\nThat flushed tide rippled toward us; floating from the east, a lone\r\ncanoe; in which, there sat a mild, old man; a palm-bough in his hand: a\r\nbird’s beak, holding amaranth and myrtles, his slender prow.\r\n\r\n“Alma’s blessing upon ye, voyagers! ye look storm-worn.”\r\n\r\n“The storm we have survived, old man; and many more, we yet must ride,”\r\nsaid Babbalanja.\r\n\r\n“The sun is risen; and all is well again. We but need to repair our\r\nprows,” said Media.\r\n\r\n“Then, turn aside to Serenia, a pleasant isle, where all are welcome;\r\nwhere many storm-worn rovers land at last to dwell.”\r\n\r\n“Serenia?” said Babbalanja; “methinks Serenia is that land of\r\nenthusiasts, of which we hear, my lord; where Mardians pretend to the\r\nunnatural conjunction of reason with things revealed; where Alma, they\r\nsay, is restored to his divine original; where, deriving their\r\nprinciples from the same sources whence flow the persecutions of\r\nMaramma,—men strive to live together in gentle bonds of peace and\r\ncharity;—folly! folly!”\r\n\r\n“Ay,” said Media; “much is said of those people of Serenia; but their\r\nsocial fabric must soon fall to pieces; it is based upon the idlest of\r\ntheories. Thanks for thy courtesy, old man, but we care not to visit\r\nthy isle. Our voyage has an object, which, something tells me, will not\r\nbe gained by touching at thy shores. Elsewhere we may refit. Farewell!\r\n’Tis breezing; set the sails! Farewell, old man.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, nay! think again; the distance is but small; the wind fair,—but\r\n’tis ever so, thither;—come: we, people of Serenia, are most anxious to\r\nbe seen of Mardi; so that if our manner of life seem good, all Mardi\r\nmay live as we. In blessed Alma’s name, I pray ye, come!”\r\n\r\n“Shall we then, my lord?”\r\n\r\n“Lead on, old man! We will e’en see this wondrous isle.”\r\n\r\nSo, guided by the venerable stranger, by noon we descried an island\r\nblooming with bright savannas, and pensive with peaceful groves.\r\n\r\nWafted from this shore, came balm of flowers, and melody of birds: a\r\nthousand summer sounds and odors. The dimpled tide sang round our\r\nsplintered prows; the sun was high in heaven, and the waters were deep\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n“The land of Love!” the old man murmured, as we neared the beach, where\r\ninnumerable shells were gently rolling in the playful surf, and\r\nmurmuring from their tuneful valves. Behind, another, and a verdant\r\nsurf played against lofty banks of leaves; where the breeze, likewise,\r\nfound its shore.\r\n\r\nAnd now, emerging from beneath the trees, there came a goodly multitude\r\nin flowing robes; palm-branches in their hands; and as they came, they\r\nsang:—\r\n\r\n        Hail! voyagers, hail!\r\nWhence e’er ye come, where’er ye rove,\r\n    No calmer strand,\r\n    No sweeter land,\r\nWill e’er ye view, than the Land of Love!\r\n\r\n    Hail! voyagers, hail!\r\nTo these, our shores, soft gales invite:\r\n    The palm plumes wave,\r\n    The billows lave,\r\nAnd hither point fix’d stars of light!\r\n\r\n    Hail! voyagers, hail!\r\nThink not our groves wide brood with gloom;\r\n    In this, our isle,\r\n    Bright flowers smile:\r\nFull urns, rose-heaped, these valleys bloom.\r\n\r\n    Hail! voyagers, hail!\r\nBe not deceived; renounce vain things;\r\n    Ye may not find\r\n    A tranquil mind,\r\nThough hence ye sail with swiftest wings.\r\n\r\n    Hail! voyagers, hail!\r\nTime flies full fast; life soon is o’er;\r\n    And ye may mourn,\r\n    That hither borne,\r\nYe left behind our pleasant shore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXIII.\r\nThey Land\r\n\r\n\r\nThe song was ended; and as we gained the strand, the crowd embraced us;\r\nand called us brothers; ourselves and our humblest attendants.\r\n\r\n“Call ye us brothers, whom ere now ye never saw?”\r\n\r\n“Even so,” said the old man, “is not Oro the father of all? Then, are\r\nwe not brothers? Thus Alma, the master, hath commanded.”\r\n\r\n“This was not our reception in Maramma,” said Media, “the appointed\r\nplace of Alma; where his precepts are preserved.”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” said Babbalanja; “old man! your lesson of brotherhood was\r\nlearned elsewhere than from Alma; for in Maramma and in all its\r\ntributary isles true brotherhood there is none. Even in the Holy Island\r\nmany are oppressed; for heresies, many murdered; and thousands perish\r\nbeneath the altars, groaning with offerings that might relieve them.”\r\n\r\n“Alas! too true. But I beseech ye, judge not Alma by all those who\r\nprofess his faith. Hast thou thyself his records searched?”\r\n\r\n“Fully, I have not. So long, even from my infancy, have I witnessed the\r\nwrongs committed in his name; the sins and inconsistencies of his\r\nfollowers; that thinking all evil must flow from a congenial fountain,\r\nI have scorned to study the whole record of your Master’s life. By\r\nparts I only know it.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! baneful error! But thus is it, brothers!! that the wisest are set\r\nagainst the Truth, because of those who wrest it from itself.”\r\n\r\n“Do ye then claim to live what your Master hath spoken? Are your\r\nprecepts practices?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing do we claim: we but earnestly endeavor.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me not of your endeavors, but of your life. What hope for the\r\nfatherless among ye?”\r\n\r\n“Adopted as a son.”\r\n\r\n“Of one poor, and naked?”\r\n\r\n“Clothed, and he wants for naught.”\r\n\r\n“If ungrateful, he smite you?”\r\n\r\n“Still we feed and clothe him.”\r\n\r\n“If yet an ingrate?”\r\n\r\n“Long, he can not be; for Love is a fervent fire.”\r\n\r\n“But what, if widely he dissent from your belief in Alma;—then, surely,\r\nye must cast him forth?”\r\n\r\n“No, no; we will remember, that if he dissent from us, we then equally\r\ndissent from him; and men’s faculties are Oro-given. Nor will we say\r\nthat he is wrong, and we are right; for this we know not, absolutely.\r\nBut we care not for men’s words; we look for creeds in actions; which\r\nare the truthful symbols of the things within. He who hourly prays to\r\nAlma, but lives not up to world-wide love and charity—that man is more\r\nan unbeliever than he who verbally rejects the Master, but does his\r\nbidding. Our lives are our Amens.”\r\n\r\n“But some say that what your Alma teaches is wholly new—a revelation of\r\nthings before unimagined, even by the poets. To do his bidding, then,\r\nsome new faculty must be vouchsafed, whereby to apprehend aright.”\r\n\r\n“So have I always thought,” said Mohi.\r\n\r\n“If Alma teaches love, I want no gift to learn,” said Yoomy.\r\n\r\n“All that is vital in the Master’s faith, lived here in Mardi, and in\r\nhumble dells was practiced, long previous to the Master’s coming. But\r\nnever before was virtue so lifted up among us, that all might see;\r\nnever before did rays from heaven descend to glorify it, But are Truth,\r\nJustice, and Love, the revelations of Alma alone? Were they never heard\r\nof till he came? Oh! Alma but opens unto us our own hearts. Were his\r\nprecepts strange we would recoil—not one feeling would respond;\r\nwhereas, once hearkened to, our souls embrace them as with the\r\ninstinctive tendrils of a vine.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Babbalanja, “since Alma, they say, was solely intent upon\r\nthe things of the Mardi to come—which to all, must seem uncertain—of\r\nwhat benefit his precepts for the daily lives led here?”\r\n\r\n“Would! would that Alma might once more descend! Brother! were the turf\r\nour everlasting pillow, still would the Master’s faith answer a blessed\r\nend;—making us more truly happy _here_. _That_ is the first and chief\r\nresult; for holy here, we must be holy elsewhere. ’Tis Mardi, to which\r\nloved Alma gives his laws; not Paradise.”\r\n\r\n“Full soon will I be testing all these things,” murmured Mohi.\r\n\r\n“Old man,” said Media, “thy years and Mohi’s lead ye both to dwell upon\r\nthe unknown future. But speak to me of other themes. Tell me of this\r\nisland and its people. From all I have heard, and now behold, I gather\r\nthat here there dwells no king; that ye are left to yourselves; and\r\nthat this mystic Love, ye speak of, is your ruler. Is it so? Then, are\r\nye full as visionary, as Mardi rumors. And though for a time, ye may\r\nhave prospered,—long, ye can not be, without some sharp lesson to\r\nconvince ye, that your faith in Mardian virtue is entirely vain.”\r\n\r\n“Truth. We have no king; for Alma’s precepts rebuke the arrogance of\r\nplace and power. He is the tribune of mankind; nor will his true faith\r\nbe universal Mardi’s, till our whole race is kingless. But think not we\r\nbelieve in man’s perfection. Yet, against all good, he is not\r\nabsolutely set. In his heart, there is a germ. _That_ we seek to\r\nfoster. To _that_ we cling; else, all were hopeless!”\r\n\r\n“Your social state?”\r\n\r\n“It is imperfect; and long must so remain. But we make not the\r\nmiserable many support the happy few. Nor by annulling reason’s laws,\r\nseek to breed equality, by breeding anarchy. In all things, equality is\r\nnot for all. Each has his own. Some have wider groves of palms than\r\nothers; fare better; dwell in more tasteful arbors; oftener renew their\r\nfragrant thatch. Such differences must be. But none starve outright,\r\nwhile others feast. By the abounding, the needy are supplied. Yet not\r\nby statute, but from dictates, born half dormant in us, and warmed into\r\nlife by Alma. Those dictates we but follow in all we do; we are not\r\ndragged to righteousness; but go running. Nor do we live in common. For\r\nvice and virtue blindly mingled, form a union where vice too often\r\nproves the alkali. The vicious we make dwell apart, until reclaimed.\r\nAnd reclaimed they soon must be, since every thing invites. The sin of\r\nothers rests not upon our heads: none we drive to crime. Our laws are\r\nnot of vengeance bred, but Love and Alma.”\r\n\r\n“Fine poetry all this,” said Babbalanja, “but not so new. Oft do they\r\nwarble thus in bland Maramma!”\r\n\r\n“It sounds famously, old man!” said Media, “but men are men. Some must\r\nstarve; some be scourged.—Your doctrines are impracticable.”\r\n\r\n“And are not these things enjoined by Alma? And would Alma inculcate\r\nthe impossible? of what merit, his precepts, unless they may be\r\npracticed? But, I beseech ye, speak no more of Maramma. Alas! did Alma\r\nrevisit Mardi, think you, it would be among those Morals he would lay\r\nhis head?”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” said Babbalanja, “as an intruder he came; and an intruder\r\nwould he be this day. On all sides, would he jar our social systems.”\r\n\r\n“Not here, not here! Rather would we welcome Alma hungry and athirst,\r\nthan though he came floating hither on the wings of seraphs; the\r\nblazing zodiac his diadem! In all his aspects we adore him; needing no\r\npomp and power to kindle worship. Though he came from Oro; though he\r\ndid miracles; though through him is life;—not for these things alone,\r\ndo we thus love him. We love him from, an instinct in us;—a fond,\r\nfilial, reverential feeling. And this would yet stir in our souls, were\r\ndeath our end; and Alma incapable of befriending us. We love him\r\nbecause we do.”\r\n\r\n“Is this man divine?” murmured Babbalanja. “But thou speakest most\r\nearnestly of adoring Alma:—I see no temples in your groves.”\r\n\r\n“Because this isle is all one temple to his praise; every leaf is\r\nconsecrated his. We fix not Alma here and there; and say,—‘those groves\r\nfor Him, and these broad fields for us.’ It is all his own; and we\r\nourselves; our every hour of life; and all we are, and have.”\r\n\r\n“Then, ye forever fast and pray; and stand and sing; as at long\r\nintervals the censer-bearers in Maramma supplicate their gods.”\r\n\r\n“Alma forbid! We never fast; our aspirations are our prayers; our lives\r\nare worship. And when we laugh, with human joy at human things, —_then_\r\ndo we most sound great Oro’s praise, and prove the merit of sweet\r\nAlma’s love! Our love in Alma makes us glad, not sad. Ye speak of\r\ntemples;—behold! ’tis by not building _them_, that we widen charity\r\namong us. The treasures which, in the islands round about, are lavished\r\non a thousand fanes;—with these we every day relieve the Master’s\r\nsuffering disciples. In Mardi, Alma preached in open fields, —and must\r\nhis worshipers have palaces?”\r\n\r\n“No temples, then no priests;” said Babbalanja, “for few priests will\r\nenter where lordly arches form not the portal.”\r\n\r\n“We have no priests, but one; and he is Alma’s self. We have his\r\nprecepts: we seek no comments but our hearts.”\r\n\r\n“But without priests and temples, how long will flourish this your\r\nfaith?” said Media.\r\n\r\n“For many ages has not this faith lived, in spite of priests and\r\ntemples? and shall it not survive them? What we believe, we hold\r\ndivine; and things divine endure forever.”\r\n\r\n“But how enlarge your bounds? how convert the vicious, without\r\npersuasion of some special seers? Must your religion go hand in hand\r\nwith all things secular?”\r\n\r\n“We hold not, that one man’s words should be a gospel to the rest; but\r\nthat Alma’s words should be a gospel to us all. And not by precepts\r\nwould we have some few endeavor to persuade; but all, by practice, fix\r\nconvictions, that the life we lead is the life for all. We are\r\napostles, every one. Where’er we go, our faith we carry in our hands,\r\nand hearts. It is our chiefest joy. We do not put it wide away six days\r\nout of seven; and then, assume it. In it we all exult, and joy; as that\r\nwhich makes us happy here; as that, without which, we could be happy\r\nnowhere; as something meant for this time present, and henceforth for\r\naye. It is our vital mode of being; not an incident. And when we die,\r\nthis faith shall be our pillow; and when we rise, our staff; and at the\r\nend, our crown. For we are all immortal. Here, Alma joins with our own\r\nhearts, confirming nature’s promptings.”\r\n\r\n“How eloquent he is!” murmured Babbalanja. “Some black cloud seems\r\nfloating from me. I begin to see. I come out in light. The sharp fang\r\ntears me less. The forked flames wane. My soul sets back like ocean\r\nstreams, that sudden change their flow. Have I been sane? Quickened in\r\nme is a hope. But pray you, old man—say on—methinks, that in your faith\r\nmust be much that jars with reason.”\r\n\r\n“No, brother! Right-reason, and Alma, are the same; else Alma, not\r\nreason, would we reject. The Master’s great command is Love; and here\r\ndo all things wise, and all things good, unite. Love is all in all. The\r\nmore we love, the more we know; and so reversed. Oro we love; this\r\nisle; and our wide arms embrace all Mardi like its reef. How can we\r\nerr, thus feeling? We hear loved Alma’s pleading, prompting voice, in\r\nevery breeze, in every leaf; we see his earnest eye in every star and\r\nflower.”\r\n\r\n“Poetry!” cried Yoomy; “and poetry is truth! He stirs me.”\r\n\r\n“When Alma dwelt in Mardi, ’twas with the poor and friendless. He fed\r\nthe famishing; he healed the sick; he bound up wounds. For every\r\nprecept that he spoke, he did ten thousand mercies. And Alma is our\r\nloved example.”\r\n\r\n“Sure, all this is in the histories!” said Mohi, starting.\r\n\r\n“But not alone to poor and friendless, did Alma wend his charitable\r\nway. From lowly places, he looked up; and long invoked great chieftains\r\nin their state; and told them all their pride was vanity; and bade them\r\nask their souls. ‘In _me_,’ he cried, ‘is that heart of mild content,\r\nwhich in vain ye seek in rank and title. I am Love: love ye then me.’”\r\n\r\n“Cease, cease, old man!” cried Media; “thou movest me beyond my\r\nseeming. What thoughts are these? Have done! Wouldst thou unking me?”\r\n\r\n“Alma is for all; for high and low. Like heaven’s own breeze, he lifts\r\nthe lily from its lowly stem, and sweeps, reviving, through the palmy\r\ngroves. High thoughts he gives the sage, and humble trust the simple.\r\nBe the measure what it may, his grace doth fill it to the brim. He lays\r\nthe lashings of the soul’s wild aspirations after things unseen; oil he\r\npoureth on the waters; and stars come out of night’s black concave at\r\nhis great command. In him is hope for all; for all, unbounded joys.\r\nFast locked in his loved clasp, no doubts dismay. He opes the eye of\r\nfaith and shuts the eye of fear. He is all we pray for, and beyond;\r\nall, that in the wildest hour of ecstasy, rapt fancy paints in bright\r\nAuroras upon the soul’s wide, boundless Orient!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Alma, Alma! prince divine!” cried Babbalanja, sinking on his\r\nknees—“in _thee_, at last, I find repose. Hope perches in my heart a\r\ndove;—a thousand rays illume;—all Heaven’s a sun. Gone, gone! are all\r\ndistracting doubts. Love and Alma now prevail. I see with other\r\neyes:—Are these my hands? What wild, wild dreams were mine;—I have been\r\nmad. Some things there are, we must not think of. Beyond one obvious\r\nmark, all human lore is vain. Where have I lived till now? Had dark\r\nMaramma’s zealot tribe but murmured to me as this old man, long since\r\nhad I, been wise! Reason no longer domineers; but still doth speak. All\r\nI have said ere this, that wars with Alma’s precepts, I here recant.\r\nHere I kneel, and own great Oro and his sovereign son.”\r\n\r\n“And here another kneels and prays,” cried Yoomy.\r\n\r\n“In Alma all my dreams are found, my inner longings for the Love\r\nsupreme, that prompts my every verse. Summer is in my soul.”\r\n\r\n“Nor now, too late for these gray hairs,” cried Mohi, with devotion.\r\n“Alma, thy breath is on my soul. I see bright light.”\r\n\r\n“No more a demigod,” cried Media, “but a subject to our common chief.\r\nNo more shall dismal cries be heard from Odo’s groves. Alma, I am\r\nthine.”\r\n\r\nWith swimming eyes the old man kneeled; and round him grouped king,\r\nsage, gray hairs, and youth.\r\n\r\nThere, as they kneeled, and as the old man blessed them, the setting\r\nsun burst forth from mists, gilded the island round about, shed rays\r\nupon their heads, and went down in a glory—all the East radiant with\r\nred burnings, like an altar-fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXIV.\r\nBabbalanja Relates To Them A Vision\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving Babbalanja in the old man’s bower, deep in meditation;\r\nthoughtfully we strolled along the beach, inspiring the musky, midnight\r\nair; the tropical stars glistening in heaven, like drops of dew among\r\nviolets.\r\n\r\nThe waves were phosphorescent, and laved the beach with a fire that\r\ncooled it.\r\n\r\nReturning, we espied Babbalanja advancing in his snow-white mantle. The\r\nfiery tide was ebbing; and in the soft, moist sand, at every step, he\r\nleft a lustrous foot-print.\r\n\r\n“Sweet friends! this isle is full of mysteries,” he said. “I have\r\ndreamed of wondrous things. After I had laid me down, thought pressed\r\nhard upon me. By my eyes passed pageant visions. I started at a low,\r\nstrange melody, deep in my inmost soul. At last, methought my eyes were\r\nfixed on heaven; and there, I saw a shining spot, unlike a star.\r\nThwarting the sky, it grew, and grew, descending; till bright wings\r\nwere visible: between them, a pensive face angelic, downward beaming;\r\nand, for one golden moment, gauze-vailed in spangled Berenice’s Locks.\r\n\r\n“Then, as white flame from yellow, out from that starry cluster it\r\nemerged; and brushed the astral Crosses, Crowns, and Cups. And as in\r\nviolet, tropic seas, ships leave a radiant-white, and fire-fly wake;\r\nso, in long extension tapering, behind the vision, gleamed another\r\nMilky-Way.\r\n\r\n“Strange throbbings seized me; my soul tossed on its own tides. But\r\nsoon the inward harmony bounded in exulting choral strains. I heard a\r\nfeathery rush; and straight beheld a form, traced all over with veins\r\nof vivid light. The vision undulated round me.\r\n\r\n“‘Oh! Spirit!! angel! god! whate’er thou art,’—I cried, ‘leave me; I am\r\nbut man.’\r\n\r\n“Then, I heard a low, sad sound, no voice. It said, or breathed upon\r\nme,—‘Thou hast proved the grace of Alma: tell me what thou’st learned.’\r\n\r\n“Silent replied my soul, for voice was gone,—‘This have I learned, oh!\r\nspirit!—In things mysterious, to seek no more; but rest content, with\r\nknowing naught but Love.’\r\n\r\n“‘Blessed art thou for that: thrice blessed,’ then I heard, and since\r\nhumility is thine, thou art one apt to learn. That which thy own wisdom\r\ncould not find, thy ignorance confessed shall gain. Come, and see new\r\nthings.’\r\n\r\n“Once more it undulated round me; its lightning wings grew dim; nearer,\r\nnearer; till I felt a shock electric,—and nested ’neath its wing.\r\n\r\n“We clove the air; passed systems, suns, and moons: what seem from\r\nMardi’s isles, the glow-worm stars.\r\n\r\n“By distant fleets of worlds we sped, as voyagers pass far sails at\r\nsea, and hail them not. Foam played before them as they darted on; wild\r\nmusic was their wake; and many tracks of sound we crossed, where worlds\r\nhad sailed before.\r\n\r\n“Soon, we gained a point, where a new heaven was seen; whence all our\r\nfirmament seemed one nebula. Its glories burned like thousand\r\nsteadfast-flaming lights.\r\n\r\n“Here hived the worlds in swarms: and gave forth sweets ineffable.\r\n\r\n“We lighted on a ring, circling a space, where mornings seemed forever\r\ndawning over worlds unlike.\r\n\r\n“‘Here,’ I heard, ‘thou viewest thy Mardi’s Heaven. Herein each world\r\nis portioned.’\r\n\r\n“As he who climbs to mountain tops pants hard for breath; so panted I\r\nfor Mardi’s grosser air. But that which caused my flesh to faint, was\r\nnew vitality to my soul. My eyes swept over all before me. The spheres\r\nwere plain as villages that dot a landscape. I saw most beauteous\r\nforms, yet like our own. Strange sounds I heard of gladness that seemed\r\nmixed with sadness:—a low, sweet harmony of both. Else, I know not how\r\nto phrase what never man but me e’er heard.\r\n\r\n“‘In these blest souls are blent,’ my guide discoursed, ‘far higher\r\nthoughts, and sweeter plaints than thine. Rude joy were discord here.\r\nAnd as a sudden shout in thy hushed mountain-passes brings down the\r\nawful avalanche; so one note of laughter here, might start some white\r\nand silent world.’\r\n\r\n“Then low I murmured:—‘Is their’s, oh guide! no happiness supreme?\r\ntheir state still mixed? Sigh these yet to know? Can these sin?’\r\n\r\n“Then I heard:—‘No mind but Oro’s can know all; no mind that knows not\r\nall can be content; content alone approximates to happiness. Holiness\r\ncomes by wisdom; and it is because great Oro is supremely wise, that\r\nHe’s supremely holy. But as perfect wisdom can be only Oro’s; so,\r\nperfect holiness is his alone. And whoso is otherwise than perfect in\r\nhis holiness, is liable to sin.\r\n\r\n“‘And though death gave these beings knowledge, it also opened other\r\nmysteries, which they pant to know, and yet may learn. And still they\r\nfear the thing of evil; though for them, ’tis hard to fall. Thus hoping\r\nand thus fearing, then, their’s is no state complete. And since Oro is\r\npast finding out, and mysteries ever open into mysteries beyond; so,\r\nthough these beings will for aye progress in wisdom and in good; yet,\r\nwill they never gain a fixed beatitude. Know, then, oh mortal Mardian!\r\nthat when translated hither, thou wilt but put off lowly temporal\r\npinings, for angel and eternal aspirations. Start not: thy human joy\r\nhath here no place: no name.\r\n\r\n“Still, I mournful mused; then said:—‘Many Mardians live, who have no\r\naptitude for Mardian lives of thought: how then endure more earnest,\r\neverlasting, meditations?’\r\n\r\n“‘Such have their place,’ I heard.\r\n\r\n“‘Then low I moaned, ‘And what, oh! guide! of those who, living\r\nthoughtless lives of sin, die unregenerate; no service done to Oro or\r\nto Mardian?’\r\n\r\n“‘They, too, have their place,’ I heard; ‘but ’tis not here. And\r\nMardian! know, that as your Mardian lives are long preserved through\r\nstrict obedience to the organic law, so are your spiritual lives\r\nprolonged by fast keeping of the law of mind. Sin is death.’\r\n\r\n“‘Ah, then,’ yet lower moan made I; ‘and why create the germs that sin\r\nand suffer, but to perish?’\r\n\r\n“‘That,’ breathed my guide; ‘is the last mystery which underlieth all\r\nthe rest. Archangel may not fathom it; that makes of Oro the\r\neverlasting mystery he is; that to divulge, were to make equal to\r\nhimself in knowledge all the souls that are; that mystery Oro guards;\r\nand none but him may know.’\r\n\r\n“Alas! were it recalled, no words have I to tell of all that now my\r\nguide discoursed, concerning things unsearchable to us. My sixth sense\r\nwhich he opened, sleeps again, with all the wisdom that it gained.\r\n\r\n“Time passed; it seemed a moment, might have been an age; when from\r\nhigh in the golden haze that canopied this heaven, another angel came;\r\nits vans like East and West; a sunrise one, sunset the other. As\r\nsilver-fish in vases, so, in his azure eyes swam tears unshed.\r\n\r\n“Quick my guide close nested me; through its veins the waning light\r\nthrobbed hard.\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, spirit! archangel! god! whate’er thou art,’ it breathed; ‘leave\r\nme: I am but blessed, not glorified.’\r\n\r\n“So saying, as down from doves, from its wings dropped sounds. Still\r\nnesting me, it crouched its plumes.\r\n\r\n“Then, in a snow of softest syllables, thus breathed the greater and\r\nmore beautiful:—‘From far away, in fields beyond thy ken, I heard thy\r\nfond discourse with this lone Mardian. It pleased me well; for thy\r\nhumility was manifeat; no arrogance of knowing. Come _thou_ and learn\r\nnew things.’\r\n\r\n“And straight it overarched us with its plumes; which, then, down-\r\nsweeping, bore us up to regions where my first guide had sunk, but for\r\nthe power that buoyed us, trembling, both.\r\n\r\n“My eyes did wane, like moons eclipsed in overwhelming dawns: such\r\nradiance was around; such vermeil light, born of no sun, but pervading\r\nall the scene. Transparent, fleck-less, calm, all glowed one flame.\r\n\r\n“Then said the greater guide This is the night of all ye here behold—\r\nits day ye could not bide. Your utmost heaven is far below.’\r\n\r\n“Abashed, smote down, I, quaking, upward gazed; where, to and fro, the\r\nspirits sailed, like broad-winged crimson-dyed flamingos, spiraling in\r\nsunset-clouds. But a sadness glorified, deep-fringed their mystic\r\ntemples, crowned with weeping halos, bird-like, floating o’er them,\r\nwhereso’er they roamed.\r\n\r\n“Sights and odors blended. As when new-morning winds, in summer’s\r\nprime, blow down from hanging gardens, wafting sweets that never pall;\r\nso, from those flowery pinions, at every motion, came a flood of\r\nfragrance.\r\n\r\n“And now the spirits twain discoursed of things, whose very terms, to\r\nme, were dark. But my first guide grew wise. For me, I could but\r\nblankly list; yet comprehended naught; and, like the fish that’s mocked\r\nwith wings, and vainly seeks to fly;—again I sought my lower element.\r\n\r\n“As poised, we hung in this rapt ether, a sudden trembling seized the\r\nfour wings now folding me. And afar of, in zones still upward reaching,\r\nsuns’ orbits off, I, tranced, beheld an awful glory. Sphere in sphere,\r\nit burned:—the one Shekinah! The air was flaked with fire;—deep in\r\nwhich, fell showers of silvery globes, tears magnified —braiding the\r\nflame with rainbows. I heard a sound; but not for me, nor my first\r\nguide, was that unutterable utterance. Then, my second guide was swept\r\naloft, as rises a cloud of red-dyed leaves in autumn whirlwinds.\r\n\r\n“Fast clasping me, the other drooped, and, instant, sank, as in a\r\nvacuum; myriad suns’ diameters in a breath;—my five senses merged in\r\none, of falling; till we gained the nether sky, descending still.\r\n\r\n“Then strange things—soft, sad, and faint, I saw or heard; as, when, in\r\nsunny, summer seas, down, down, you dive, starting at pensive phantoms,\r\nthat you can not fix.\r\n\r\n“‘These,’ breathed my guide, ‘are spirits in their essences; sad, even\r\nin undevelopment. With these, all space is peopled;—all the air is\r\nvital with intelligence, which seeks embodiment. This it is, that\r\nunbeknown to Mardians, causes them to strangely start in solitudes of\r\nnight, and in the fixed flood of their enchanted noons. From hence, are\r\nformed your mortal souls; and all those sad and shadowy dreams, and\r\nboundless thoughts man hath, are vague remembrances of the time when\r\nthe soul’s sad germ, wide wandered through these realms. And hence it\r\nis, that when ye Mardians feel most sad, then ye feel most immortal.\r\n\r\n“Like a spark new-struck from flint, soon Mardi showed afar. It glowed\r\nwithin a sphere, which seemed, in space, a bubble, rising from vast\r\ndepths to the sea’s surface. Piercing it, my Mardian strength returned;\r\nbut the angel’s veins once more grew dim.\r\n\r\n“Nearing the isles, thus breathed my guide:—‘Loved one, love on! But\r\nknow, that heaven hath no roof. To know all is to be all. Beatitude\r\nthere is none. And your only Mardian happiness is but exemption from\r\ngreat woes—no more. Great Love is sad; and heaven is Love. Sadness\r\nmakes the silence throughout the realms of space; sadness is universal\r\nand eternal; but sadness is tranquillity; tranquillity the uttermost\r\nthat souls may hope for.’\r\n\r\n“Then, with its wings it fanned adieu; and disappeared where the sun\r\nflames highest.”\r\n\r\nWe heard the dream and, silent, sought repose, to dream away our\r\nwonder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXV.\r\nThey Depart From Serenia\r\n\r\n\r\nAt sunrise, we stood upon the beach.\r\n\r\nBabbalanja thus:—“My voyage is ended. Not because what we sought is\r\nfound; but that I now possess all which may be had of what I sought in\r\nMardi. Here, tarry to grow wiser still:—then I am Alma’s and the\r\nworld’s. Taji! for Yillah thou wilt hunt in vain; she is a phantom that\r\nbut mocks thee; and while for her thou madly huntest, the sin thou\r\ndidst cries out, and its avengers still will follow. But here they may\r\nnot come: nor those, who, tempting, track thy path. Wise counsel take.\r\nWithin our hearts is all we seek: though in that search many need a\r\nprompter. Him I have found in blessed Alma. Then rove no more. Gain\r\nnow, in flush of youth, that last wise thought, too often purchased, by\r\na life of woe. Be wise: be wise.\r\n\r\n“Media! thy station calls thee home. Yet from this isle, thou earnest\r\nthat, wherewith to bless thy own. These flowers, that round us spring,\r\nmay be transplanted: and Odo made to bloom with amaranths and myrtles,\r\nlike this Serenia. Before thy people act the things, thou here hast\r\nheard. Let no man weep, that thou may’st laugh; no man toil too hard,\r\nthat thou may’st idle be. Abdicate thy throne: but still retain the\r\nscepter. None need a king; but many need a ruler.\r\n\r\n“Mohi! Yoomy! do we part? then bury in forgetfulness much that hitherto\r\nI’ve spoken. But let not one syllable of this old man’s words be lost.\r\n\r\n“Mohi! Age leads thee by the hand. Live out thy life; and die, calm-\r\nbrowed.\r\n\r\n“But Yoomy! many days are thine. And in one life’s span, great circles\r\nmay be traversed, eternal good be done. Take all Mardi for thy home.\r\nNations are but names; and continents but shifting sands.\r\n\r\n“Once more: Taji! be sure thy Yillah never will be found; or found,\r\nwill not avail thee. Yet search, if so thou wilt; more isles, thou\r\nsay’st, are still unvisited; and when all is seen, return, and find thy\r\nYillah here.\r\n\r\n“Companions all! adieu.”\r\n\r\nAnd from the beach, he wended through the woods.\r\n\r\nOur shallops now refitted, we silently embarked; and as we sailed away,\r\nthe old man blessed us.\r\n\r\nFor a time, each prow’s ripplings were distinctly heard: ripple after\r\nripple.\r\n\r\nWith silent, steadfast eyes, Media still preserved his noble mien; Mohi\r\nhis reverend repose; Yoomy his musing mood.\r\n\r\nBut as a summer hurricane leaves all nature still, and smiling to the\r\neye; yet, in deep woods, there lie concealed some anguished roots torn\r\nup:—so, with these.\r\n\r\nMuch they longed, to point our prows for Odo’s isle; saying our search\r\nwas over.\r\n\r\nBut I was fixed as fate.\r\n\r\nOn we sailed, as when we first embarked; the air was bracing as before.\r\nMore isles we visited:—thrice encountered the avengers: but unharmed;\r\nthrice Hautia’s heralds but turned not aside;—saw many checkered\r\nscenes—wandered through groves, and open fields—traversed many\r\nvales—climbed hill-tops whence broad views were gained—tarried in\r\ntowns—broke into solitudes—sought far, sought near:—Still Yillah there\r\nwas none.\r\n\r\nThen again they all would fain dissuade me.\r\n\r\n“Closed is the deep blue eye,” said Yoomy.\r\n\r\n“Fate’s last leaves are turning, let me home and die,” said Mohi.\r\n\r\n“So nigh the circuit’s done,” said Media, “our morrow’s sun must rise\r\no’er Odo; Taji! renounce the hunt.”\r\n\r\n“I am the hunter, that never rests! the hunter without a home! She I\r\nseek, still flies before; and I will follow, though she lead me beyond\r\nthe reef; through sunless seas; and into night and death. Her, will I\r\nseek, through all the isles and stars; and find her, whate’er betide!”\r\n\r\nAgain they yielded; and again we glided on;—our storm-worn prows, now\r\npointed here, now there;—beckoned, repulsed;—their half-rent sails,\r\nstill courting every breeze.\r\n\r\nBut that same night, once more, they wrestled with me. Now, at last,\r\nthe hopeless search must be renounced: Yillah there was none: back must\r\nI hie to blue Serenia.\r\n\r\nThen sweet Yillah called me from the sea;—still must I on! but gazing\r\nwhence that music seemed to come, I thought I saw the green corse\r\ndrifting by: and striking ’gainst our prow, as if to hinder. Then,\r\nthen! my heart grew hard, like flint; and black, like night; and\r\nsounded hollow to the hand I clenched. Hyenas filled me with their\r\nlaughs; death-damps chilled my brow; I prayed not, but blasphemed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXVI.\r\nThey Meet The Phantoms\r\n\r\n\r\nThat starless midnight, there stole from out the darkness, the Iris\r\nflag of Hautia.\r\n\r\nAgain the sirens came. They bore a large and stately urn-like flower,\r\nwhite as alabaster, and glowing, as if lit up within. From its calyx,\r\nflame-like, trembled forked and crimson stamens, burning with intensest\r\nodors.\r\n\r\nThe phantoms nearer came; their flower, as an urn of burning niter.\r\nThen it changed, and glowed like Persian dawns; or passive, was shot\r\nover by palest lightnings;—so variable its tints.\r\n\r\n“The night-blowing Cereus!” said Yoomy, shuddering, “that never blows\r\nin sun-light; that blows but once; and blows but for an hour.—For the\r\nlast time I come; now, in your midnight of despair, and promise you\r\nthis glory. Take heed! short time hast thou to pause; through me,\r\nperhaps, thy Yillah may be found.”\r\n\r\n“Away! away! tempt me not by that, enchantress! Hautia! I know thee\r\nnot; I fear thee not; but instinct makes me hate thee. Away! my eyes\r\nare frozen shut; I will not be tempted more.”\r\n\r\n“How glorious it burns!” cried Media. I reel with incense:—can such\r\nsweets be evil?”\r\n\r\n“Look! look!” cried Yoomy, “its petals wane, and creep; one moment\r\nmore, and the night-flower shuts up forever the last, last hope of\r\nYillah!”\r\n\r\n“Yillah! Yillah! Yillah!” bayed three vengeful voices far behind.\r\n\r\n“Yillah! Yillah!—dash the urn! I follow, Hautia! though thy lure be\r\ndeath.”\r\n\r\nThe Cereus closed; and in a mist the siren prow went on before; we,\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\nWhen day dawned, three radiant pilot-fish swam in advance: three\r\nravenous sharks astern.\r\n\r\nAnd, full before us, rose the isle of Hautia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXVII.\r\nThey Draw Nigh To Flozella\r\n\r\n\r\nAs if Mardi were a poem, and every island a canto, the shore now in\r\nsight was called Flozella-a-Nina, or The-Last-Verse-of-the-Song.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mohi, the origin of this term was traceable to the\r\nremotest antiquity.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, there were other beings in Mardi besides Mardians;\r\nwinged beings, of purer minds, and cast in gentler molds, who would\r\nfain have dwelt forever with mankind. But the hearts of the Mardians\r\nwere bitter against them, because of their superior goodness. Yet those\r\nbeings returned love for malice, and long entreated to virtue and\r\ncharity. But in the end, all Mardi rose up against them, and hunted\r\nthem from isle to isle; till, at last, they rose from the woodlands\r\nlike a flight of birds, and disappeared in the skies. Thereafter,\r\nabandoned of such sweet influences, the Mardians fell into all manner\r\nof sins and sufferings, becoming the erring things their descendants\r\nwere now. Yet they knew not, that their calamities were of their own\r\nbringing down. For deemed a victory, the expulsion of the winged beings\r\nwas celebrated in choruses, throughout Mardi. And among other\r\njubilations, so ran the legend, a pean was composed, corresponding in\r\nthe number of its stanzas, to the number of islands. And a band of\r\nyouths, gayly appareled, voyaged in gala canoes all round the lagoon,\r\nsinging upon each isle, one verse of their song. And Flozella being the\r\nlast isle in their circuit, its queen commemorated the circumstance, by\r\nnew naming her realm.\r\n\r\nThat queen had first incited Mardi to wage war against the beings with\r\nwings. She it was, who had been foremost in every assault. And that\r\nqueen was ancestor of Hautia, now ruling the isle.\r\n\r\nApproaching the dominions of one who so long had haunted me,\r\nconflicting emotions tore up my soul in tornadoes. Yet Hautia had held\r\nout some prospect of crowning my yearnings. But how connected were\r\nHautia and Yillah? Something I hoped; yet more I feared. Dire\r\npresentiments, like poisoned arrows, shot through me. Had they pierced\r\nme before, straight to Flozella would I have voyaged; not waiting for\r\nHautia to woo me by that last and victorious temptation. But unchanged\r\nremained my feelings of hatred for Hautia; yet vague those feelings, as\r\nthe language of her flowers. Nevertheless, in some mysterious way\r\nseemed Hautia and Yillah connected. But Yillah was all beauty, and\r\ninnocence; my crown of felicity; my heaven below;—and Hautia, my whole\r\nheart abhorred. Yillah I sought; Hautia sought me. One, openly beckoned\r\nme here; the other dimly allured me there. Yet now was I wildly\r\ndreaming to find them together. But so distracted my soul, I knew not\r\nwhat it was, that I thought.\r\n\r\nSlowly we neared the land. Flozella-a-Nina!—An omen? Was this isle,\r\nthen, to prove the last place of my search, even as it was the Last-\r\nVerse-of-the-Song?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXVIII.\r\nThey Land\r\n\r\n\r\nA jeweled tiara, nodding in spray, looks flowery Flozella, approached\r\nfrom the sea. For, lo you! the glittering foam all round its white\r\nmarge; where, forcing themselves underneath the coral ledge, and up\r\nthrough its crevices, in fountains, the blue billows gush. While,\r\nwithin, zone above zone, thrice zoned in belts of bloom, all the isle,\r\nas a hanging-garden soars; its tapering cone blending aloft, with\r\nheaven’s own blue.\r\n\r\n“What flies through the spray! what incense is this?” cried Media.\r\n\r\n“Ha! you wild breeze! you have been plundering the gardens of Hautia,”\r\ncried Yoomy.\r\n\r\n“No sweets can be sweeter,” said Braid-Beard, “but no Upas more\r\ndeadly.”\r\n\r\nAnon we came nearer; sails idly flapping, and paddles suspended; sleek\r\ncurrents our coursers. And round about the isle, like winged rainbows,\r\nshoals of dolphins were leaping over floating fragments of wrecks:—\r\ndark-green, long-haired ribs, and keels of canoes. For many shallops,\r\ninveigled by the eddies, were oft dashed to pieces against that flowery\r\nstrand. But what cared the dolphins? Mardian wrecks were their homes.\r\nOver and over they sprang: from east to west: rising and setting: many\r\nsuns in a moment; while all the sea, like a harvest plain, was stacked\r\nwith their glittering sheaves of spray.\r\n\r\nAnd far down, fathoms on fathoms, flitted rainbow hues:—as seines- full\r\nof mermaids; half-screening the bones of the drowned.\r\n\r\nSwifter and swifter the currents now ran; till with a shock, our prows\r\nwere beached.\r\n\r\nThere, beneath an arch of spray, three dark-eyed maidens stood;\r\ngarlanded with columbines, their nectaries nodding like jesters’ bells;\r\nand robed in vestments blue.\r\n\r\n“The pilot-fish transformed!” cried Yoomy.\r\n\r\n“The night-eyed heralds three!” said Mohi.\r\n\r\nFollowing the maidens, we now took our way along a winding vale; where,\r\nby sweet-scented hedges, flowed blue-braided brooks; their tributaries,\r\nrivulets of violets, meandering through the meads.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, forever glowed the rosy mountains with a tropic dawn; and\r\non the other; lay an Arctic eve;—the white daisies drifted in long\r\nbanks of snow, and snowed the blossoms from the orange boughs. There,\r\nsummer breathed her bridal bloom; her hill-top temples crowned with\r\nbridal wreaths.\r\n\r\nWe wandered on, through orchards arched in long arcades, that seemed\r\nbaronial halls, hung o’er with trophies:—so spread the boughs in\r\nantlers. This orchard was the frontlet of the isle.\r\n\r\nThe fruit hung high in air, that only beaks, not hands, might pluck.\r\n\r\nHere, the peach tree showed her thousand cheeks of down, kissed often\r\nby the wooing winds; here, in swarms; the yellow apples hived, like\r\ngolden bees upon the boughs; here, from the kneeling, fainting trees,\r\nthick fell the cherries, in great drops of blood; and here, the\r\npomegranate, with cold rind and sere, deep pierced by bills of birds\r\nrevealed the mellow of its ruddy core. So, oft the heart, that cold and\r\nwithered seems, within yet hides its juices.\r\n\r\nThis orchard passed, the vale became a lengthening plain, that seemed\r\nthe Straits of Ormus bared so thick it lay with flowery gems:\r\ntorquoise-hyacinths, ruby-roses, lily-pearls. Here roved the vagrant\r\nvines; their flaxen ringlets curling over arbors, which laughed and\r\nshook their golden locks. From bower to bower, flew the wee bird, that\r\never hovering, seldom lights; and flights of gay canaries passed, like\r\njonquils, winged.\r\n\r\nBut now, from out half-hidden bowers of clematis, there issued swarms\r\nof wasps, which flying wide, settled on all the buds.\r\n\r\nAnd, fifty nymphs preceding, who now follows from those bowers, with\r\ngliding, artful steps:—the very snares of love!—Hautia. A gorgeous\r\namaryllis in her hand; Circe-flowers in her ears; her girdle tied with\r\nvervain.\r\n\r\nShe came by privet hedges, drooping; downcast honey-suckles; she trod\r\non pinks and pansies, blue-bells, heath, and lilies. She glided on: her\r\ncrescent brow calm as the moon, when most it works its evil influences.\r\n\r\nHer eye was fathomless.\r\n\r\nBut the same mysterious, evil-boding gaze was there, which long before\r\nhad haunted me in Odo, ere Yillah fled.—Queen Hautia the incognito!\r\nThen two wild currents met, and dashed me into foam.\r\n\r\n“Yillah! Yillah!—tell me, queen!” But she stood motionless; radiant,\r\nand scentless: a dahlia on its stalk. “Where? Where?”\r\n\r\n“Is not thy voyage now ended?—Take flowers! Damsels, give him wine to\r\ndrink. After his weary hunt, be the wanderer happy.”\r\n\r\nI dashed aside their cups, and flowers; still rang the vale with\r\nYillah!\r\n\r\n“Taji! did I know her fate, naught would I now disclose; my heralds\r\npledged their queen to naught. Thou but comest here to supplant thy\r\nmourner’s night-shade, with marriage roses. Damsels! give him wreaths;\r\ncrowd round him; press him with your cups!”\r\n\r\nOnce more I spilled their wine, and tore their garlands. Is not that,\r\nthe evil eye that long ago did haunt me? and thou, the Hautia who hast\r\nfollowed me, and wooed, and mocked, and tempted me, through all this\r\nlong, long voyage? I swear! thou knowest all.”\r\n\r\n“I am Hautia. Thou hast come at last. Crown him with your flowers!\r\nDrown him in your wine! To all questions, Taji! I am mute.—Away!—\r\ndamsels dance; reel round him; round and round!”\r\n\r\nThen, their feet made music on the rippling grass, like thousand leaves\r\nof lilies on a lake. And, gliding nearer, Hautia welcomed Media; and\r\nsaid, “Your comrade here is sad:—be ye gay. Ho, wine!—I pledge ye,\r\nguests!”\r\n\r\nThen, marking all, I thought to seem what I was not, that I might learn\r\nat last the thing I sought.\r\n\r\nSo, three cups in hand I held; drank wine, and laughed; and half-way\r\nmet Queen Hautia’s blandishments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXIX.\r\nThey Enter The Bower Of Hautia\r\n\r\n\r\nConducted to the arbor, from which the queen had emerged, we came to a\r\nsweet-brier bower within; and reclined upon odorous mats.\r\n\r\nThen, in citron cups, sherbet of tamarinds was offered to Media, Mohi,\r\nYoomy; to me, a nautilus shell, brimmed with a light-like fluid, that\r\nwelled, and welled like a fount.\r\n\r\n“Quaff, Taji, quaff! every drop drowns a thought!”\r\n\r\nLike a blood-freshet, it ran through my veins.\r\n\r\nA philter?—How Hautia burned before me! Glorious queen! with all the\r\nradiance, lighting up the equatorial night.\r\n\r\n“Thou art most magical, oh queen! about thee a thousand constellations\r\ncluster.”\r\n\r\n“They blaze to burn,” whispered Mohi.\r\n\r\n“I see ten million Hautias!—all space reflects her, as a mirror.”\r\n\r\nThen, in reels, the damsels once more mazed, the blossoms shaking from\r\ntheir brows; till Hautia, glided near; arms lustrous as rainbows:\r\nchanting some wild invocation.\r\n\r\nMy soul ebbed out; Yillah there was none! but as I turned round open-\r\narmed, Hautia vanished.\r\n\r\n“She is deeper than the sea,” said Media.\r\n\r\n“Her bow is bent,” said Yoomy.\r\n\r\n“I could tell wonders of Hautia and her damsels,” said Mohi.\r\n\r\n“What wonders?”\r\n\r\n“Listen; and in his own words will I recount the adventure of the youth\r\nOzonna. It will show thee, Taji, that the maidens of Hautia are all\r\nYillahs, held captive, unknown to themselves; and that Hautia, their\r\nenchantress, is the most treacherous of queens.\r\n\r\n“‘Camel-like, laden with woe,’ said Ozonna, ‘after many wild rovings in\r\nquest of a maiden long lost—beautiful Ady! and after being repelled in\r\nMaramma; and in vain hailed to land at Serenia, represented as naught\r\nbut another Maramma;—with vague promises of discovering Ady, three\r\nsirens, who long had pursued, at last inveigled me to Flozella; where\r\nHautia made me her thrall. But ere long, in Rea, one of her maidens, I\r\nthought I discovered my Ady transformed. My arms opened wide to\r\nembrace; but the damsel knew not Ozonna. And even, when after hard\r\nwooing, I won her again, she seemed not lost Ady, but Rea. Yet all the\r\nwhile, from deep in her strange, black orbs, Ady’s blue eyes seemed\r\npensively looking:—blue eye within black: sad, silent soul within\r\nmerry. Long I strove, by fixed ardent gazing, to break the spell, and\r\nrestore in Rea my lost one’s Past. But in vain. It was only Rea, not\r\nAdy, who at stolen intervals looked on me now. One morning Hautia\r\nstarted as she greeted me; her quick eye rested on my bosom; and\r\nglancing there, affrighted, I beheld a distinct, fresh mark, the\r\nimpress of Rea’s necklace drop. Fleeing, I revealed what had passed to\r\nthe maiden, who broke from my side; as I, from Hautia’s. The queen\r\nsummoned her damsels, but for many hours the call was unheeded; and\r\nwhen at last they came, upon each bosom lay a necklace-drop like Rea’s.\r\nOn the morrow, lo! my arbor was strown over with bruised Linden-leaves,\r\nexuding a vernal juice. Full of forbodings, again I sought Rea: who,\r\ncasting down her eyes, beheld her feet stained green. Again she fled;\r\nand again Hautia summoned her damsels: malicious triumph in her eye;\r\nbut dismay succeeded: each maid had spotted feet. That night Rea was\r\ntorn from my side by three masks; who, stifling her cries, rapidly bore\r\nher away; and as I pursued, disappeared in a cave. Next morning, Hautia\r\nwas surrounded by her nymphs, but Rea was absent. Then, gliding near,\r\nshe snatched from my hair, a jet-black tress, loose-hanging. ‘Ozonna is\r\nthe murderer! See! Rea’s torn hair entangled with his!’ Aghast, I swore\r\nthat I knew not her fate. ‘Then let the witch Larfee be called!’ The\r\nmaidens darted from the bower; and soon after, there rolled into it a\r\ngreen cocoa-nut, followed by the witch, and all the damsels, flinging\r\nanemones upon it. Bowling this way and that, the nut at last rolled to\r\nmy feet.—‘It is he!’ cried all.—Then they bound me with osiers; and at\r\nmidnight, unseen and irresistible hands placed me in a shallop; which\r\nsped far out into the lagoon, where they tossed me to the waves; but so\r\nviolent the shock, the osiers burst; and as the shallop fled one way,\r\nswimming another, ere long I gained land.\r\n\r\n“‘Thus in Flozella, I found but the phantom of Ady, and slew the last\r\nhope of Ady the true.’”\r\n\r\nThis recital sank deep into my soul. In some wild way, Hautia had made\r\na captive of Yillah; in some one of her black-eyed maids, the blue-eyed\r\nOne was transformed. From side to side, in frenzy, I turned; but in all\r\nthose cold, mystical eyes, saw not the warm ray that I sought.\r\n\r\n“Hast taken root within this treacherous soil?” cried Media. “Away! thy\r\nYillah is behind thee, not before. Deep she dwells in blue Serenia’s\r\ngroves; which thou would’st not search. Hautia mocks thee; away! The\r\nreef is rounded; but a strait flows between this isle and Odo, and\r\nthither its ruler must return. Every hour I tarry here, some wretched\r\nserf is dying there, for whom, from blest Serenia, _I carry life and\r\njoy. Away!_”\r\n\r\n“Art still bent on finding evil for thy good?” cried Mohi.—“How can\r\nYillah harbor here?—Beware!—Let not Hautia so enthrall thee.”\r\n\r\n“Come away, come away,” cried Yoomy. “Far hence is Yillah! and he who\r\ntarries among these flowers, must needs burn juniper.”\r\n\r\n“Look on me, Media, Mohi, Yoomy. Here I stand, my own monument, till\r\nHautia breaks the spell.”\r\n\r\nIn grief they left me.\r\n\r\nVee-Vee’s conch I heard no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XC.\r\nTaji With Hautia\r\n\r\n\r\nAs their last echoes died away down the valley, Hautia glided near;—\r\nzone unbound, the amaryllis in her hand. Her bosom ebbed and flowed;\r\nthe motes danced in the beams that darted from her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Come! let us sin, and be merry. Ho! wine, wine, wine! and lapfuls of\r\nflowers! let all the cane-brakes pipe their flutes. Damsels! dance;\r\nreel, swim, around me:—I, the vortex that draws all in. Taji! Taji!— as\r\na berry, that name is juicy in my mouth!—Taji, Taji!” and in choruses,\r\nshe warbled forth the sound, till it seemed issuing from her syren\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nMy heart flew forth from out its bars, and soared in air; but as my\r\nhand touched Hautia’s, down dropped a dead bird from the clouds.\r\n\r\n“Ha! how he sinks!—but did’st ever dive in deep waters, Taji? Did’st\r\never see where pearls grow?—To the cave!—damsels, lead on!”\r\n\r\nThen wending through constellations of flowers, we entered deep groves.\r\nAnd thus, thrice from sun-light to shade, it seemed three brief nights\r\nand days, ere we paused before the mouth of the cavern.\r\n\r\nA bow-shot from the sea, it pierced the hill-side like a vaulted way;\r\nand glancing in, we saw far gleams of water; crossed, here and there,\r\nby long-flung distant shadows of domes and columns. All Venice seemed\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\nFrom a stack of golden palm-stalks, the damsels now made torches; then\r\nstood grouped; a sheaf of sirens in a sheaf of frame.\r\n\r\nIlluminated, the cavern shone like a Queen of Kandy’s casket: full of\r\ndawns and sunsets.\r\n\r\nFrom rocky roof to bubbling floor, it was columned with stalactites;\r\nand galleried all round, in spiral tiers, with sparkling, coral ledges.\r\n\r\nAnd now, their torches held aloft, into the water the maidens softly\r\nglided; and each a lotus floated; while, from far above, into the air\r\nHautia flung her flambeau; then bounding after, in the lake, two\r\nmeteors were quenched.\r\n\r\nWhere she dived, the flambeaux clustered; and up among them, Hautia\r\nrose; hands, full of pearls.\r\n\r\n“Lo! Taji; all these may be had for the diving; and Beauty, Health,\r\nWealth, Long Life, and the Last Lost Hope of man. But through me alone,\r\nmay these be had. Dive thou, and bring up one pearl if thou canst.”\r\n\r\nDown, down! down, down, in the clear, sparkling water, till I seemed\r\ncrystalized in the flashing heart of a diamond; but from those\r\nbottomless depths, I uprose empty handed.\r\n\r\n“Pearls, pearls! thy pearls! thou art fresh from the mines. Ah, Taji!\r\nfor thee, bootless deep diving. Yet to Hautia, one shallow plunge\r\nreveals many Golcondas. But come; dive with me:—join hands—let me show\r\nthee strange things.”\r\n\r\n“Show me that which I seek, and I will dive with thee, straight through\r\nthe world, till we come up in oceans unknown.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, nay; but join hands, and I will take thee, where thy Past shall\r\nbe forgotten; where thou wilt soon learn to love the living, not the\r\ndead.”\r\n\r\n“Better to me, oh Hautia! all the bitterness of my buried dead, than\r\nall the sweets of the life thou canst bestow; even, were it eternal.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCI.\r\nMardi Behind: An Ocean Before\r\n\r\n\r\nReturned from the cave, Hautia reclined in her clematis bower,\r\ninvisible hands flinging fennel around her. And nearer, and nearer,\r\nstole dulcet sounds dissolving my woes, as warm beams, snow. Strange\r\nlanguors made me droop; once more within my inmost vault, side by side,\r\nthe Past and Yillah lay:—two bodies tranced;—while like a rounding sun,\r\nbefore me Hautia magnified magnificence; and through her fixed eyes,\r\nslowly drank up my soul.\r\n\r\nThus we stood:—snake and victim: life ebbing out from me, to her.\r\n\r\nBut from that spell, I burst again, as all the Past smote all the\r\nPresent in me.\r\n\r\n“Oh Hautia! thou knowest the mystery I die to fathom. I see it\r\ncrouching in thine eye:—Reveal!”\r\n\r\n“Weal or woe?”\r\n\r\n“Life or death!”\r\n\r\n“See, see!” and Yillah’s rose-pearl danced before me.\r\n\r\nI snatched it from her hand:—“Yillah! Yillah!”\r\n\r\n“Rave on: she lies too deep to answer; stranger voices than thine she\r\nhears:—bubbles are bursting round her.”\r\n\r\n“Drowned! drowned then, even as she dreamed:—I come, I come!—Ha, what\r\nform is this?—hast mosses? sea-thyme? pearls?—Help, help! I sink!—Back,\r\nshining monster!—-What, Hautia,—is it thou?—Oh vipress, I could slay\r\nthee!”\r\n\r\n“Go, go,—and slay thyself: I may not make thee mine;—go,—dead to\r\ndead!—There is another cavern in the hill.” Swift I fled along the\r\nvalley-side; passed Hautia’s cave of pearls; and gained a twilight\r\narch; within, a lake transparent shone. Conflicting currents met, and\r\nwrestled; and one dark arch led to channels, seaward tending.\r\n\r\nRound and round, a gleaming form slow circled in the deepest eddies:—\r\nwhite, and vaguely Yillah.\r\n\r\nStraight I plunged; but the currents were as fierce headwinds off\r\ncapes, that beat back ships.\r\n\r\nThen, as I frenzied gazed; gaining the one dark arch, the revolving\r\nshade darted out of sight, and the eddies whirled as before.\r\n\r\n“Stay, stay! let me go with thee, though thou glidest to gulfs of\r\nblackness;—naught can exceed the hell of this despair!—Why beat longer\r\nin this corpse oh, my heart!”\r\n\r\nAs somnambulists fast-frozen in some horrid dream, ghost-like glide\r\nabroad, and fright the wakeful world; so that night, with death-glazed\r\neyes, to and fro I flitted on the damp and weedy beach.\r\n\r\n“Is this specter, Taji?”—and Mohi and the minstrel stood before me.\r\n\r\n“Taji lives no more. So dead, he has no ghost. I am his spirit’s\r\nphantom’s phantom.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, then, phantom! the time has come to flee.”\r\n\r\nThey dragged me to the water’s brink, where a prow was beached. Soon—\r\nMohi at the helm—we shot beneath the far-flung shadow of a cliff; when,\r\nas in a dream, I hearkened to a voice.\r\n\r\nArrived at Odo, Media had been met with yells. Sedition was in arms,\r\nand to his beard defied him. Vain all concessions then. Foremost stood\r\nthe three pale sons of him, whom I had slain, to gain the maiden lost.\r\nAvengers, from the first hour we had parted on the sea, they had\r\ndrifted on my track survived starvation; and lived to hunt me round all\r\nMardi’s reef; and now at Odo, that last threshold, waited to destroy;\r\nor there, missing the revenge they sought, still swore to hunt me round\r\nEternity.\r\n\r\nBehind the avengers, raged a stormy mob, invoking Media to renounce his\r\nrule. But one hand waving like a pennant above the smoke of some\r\nsea-fight, straight through that tumult Media sailed serene: the\r\nrioters parting from before him, as wild waves before a prow\r\ninflexible.\r\n\r\nA haven gained, he turned to Mohi and the minstrel:—“Oh, friends! after\r\nour long companionship, hard to part! But henceforth, for many moons,\r\nOdo will prove no home for old age, or youth. In Serenia only, will ye\r\nfind the peace ye seek; and thither ye must carry Taji, who else must\r\nsoon be slain, or lost. Go: release him from the thrall of Hautia.\r\nOutfly the avengers, and gain Serenia. Reek not of me. The state is\r\ntossed in storms; and where I stand, the combing billows must break\r\nover. But among all noble souls, in tempest-time, the headmost man last\r\nflies the wreck. So, here in Odo will I abide, though every plank\r\nbreaks up beneath me. And then,—great Oro! let the king die clinging to\r\nthe keel! Farewell!”\r\n\r\nSuch Mohi’s tale.\r\n\r\nIn trumpet-blasts, the hoarse night-winds now blew; the Lagoon, black\r\nwith the still shadows of the mountains, and the driving shadows of the\r\nclouds. Of all the stars, only red Arcturus shone. But through the\r\ngloom, and on the circumvallating reef, the breakers dashed\r\nghost-white.\r\n\r\nAn outlet in that outer barrier was nigh.\r\n\r\n“Ah! Yillah! Yillah!—the currents sweep thee ocean-ward; nor will I\r\ntarry behind.—Mardi, farewell!—Give me the helm, old man!”\r\n\r\n“Nay, madman! Serenia is our haven. Through yonder strait, for thee,\r\nperdition lies. And from the deep beyond, no voyager e’er puts back.”\r\n\r\n“And why put back? is a life of dying worth living o’er again?—Let\r\n_me_, then, be the unreturning wanderer. The helm! By Oro, I will steer\r\nmy own fate, old man.—Mardi, farewell!”\r\n\r\n“Nay, Taji: commit not the last, last crime!” cried Yoomy.\r\n\r\n“He’s seized the helm! eternity is in his eye! Yoomy: for our lives we\r\nmust now swim.”\r\n\r\nAnd plunging, they struck out for land: Yoomy buoying Mohi up, and the\r\nsalt waves dashing the tears from his pallid face, as through the scud,\r\nhe turned it on me mournfully.\r\n\r\n“Now, I am my own soul’s emperor; and my first act is abdication! Hail!\r\nrealm of shades!”—and turning my prow into the racing tide, which\r\nseized me like a hand omnipotent, I darted through.\r\n\r\nChurned in foam, that outer ocean lashed the clouds; and straight in my\r\nwhite wake, headlong dashed a shallop, three fixed specters leaning\r\no’er its prow: three arrows poising.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, pursuers and pursued flew on, over an endless sea.\r\n\r\n THE END.",
