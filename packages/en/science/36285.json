Nevertheless, the behavior of\r\nno species of the genus has been studied extensively. The papers of\r\nMontagna and Tomkins are the only works that mention behavior and\r\nnatural history in any detail. There has been an increasing awareness\r\nof the importance of ethological data and of their usefulness in\r\nsystematics. For these reasons, I made a comparative study of the\r\nbreeding behavior of the Sharp-tailed Sparrow (_Ammospiza caudacuta_)\r\nand the Seaside Sparrow (_Ammospiza maritima_) in New Jersey in the\r\nspring and summer of 1955.\r\n\r\nThe Seaside Sparrow is restricted to the Gulf- and Atlantic-coasts\r\nof North America, breeding north to Massachusetts. The Sharp-tailed\r\nSparrow breeds south to North Carolina. The overlap of the\r\nbreeding ranges of the two species is therefore small. Furthermore\r\nthe forms breeding in the coastal states are restricted to tidal\r\nmarshes, and the geographically peripheral colonies of each species\r\nare small. Irregular nesting is the case for the northernmost\r\ncolonies of the Seaside Sparrow, on Cape Cod (Griscom, 1944:317),\r\nand the same is probably true for the colonies of the Sharp-tailed\r\nSparrow on Pea Island, North Carolina, as indicated by Montagna's\r\nfailure to locate any breeding birds in July, 1941 (Montagna, 1942b:\r\n256). The center of overlap of the ranges of the two species is in\r\nNew Jersey where both forms are abundant and can best be studied\r\ncomparatively.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MATERIALS AND METHODS\r\n\r\n    The adult sparrows were captured and banded, and sometimes the\r\n    nestlings were banded. The standard funnel trap, baited with seeds,\r\n    proved useless for capturing birds of the Genus _Ammospiza_,\r\n    although migrant Savannah Sparrows (_Passerculus sandwichensis_)\r\n    readily entered. A Japanese bird net, twenty-five feet long, was\r\n    used successfully. Eighty-five Sharp-tailed Sparrows and forty\r\n    Seaside Sparrows were banded at two localities.\r\n\r\n    All of the adult sparrows were banded with United States Fish and\r\n    Wildlife Service numbered bands and colored celluloid bands. The\r\n    colored bands I used were obtained from the Hinton Supply Company\r\n    of New York City, which manufactures them for cage birds. The firm\r\n    makes them in seven colors, sold at reasonable prices. With seven\r\n    colors, the number of combinations, using only one colored band and\r\n    one aluminum band per bird, is forty-two.\r\n\r\n    In addition, I dyed many adults and all nestlings. Alcoholic\r\n    solutions of Victoria Blue B S concentrate and Alizarine Red S\r\n    concentrate were used. The males were dyed red, the females blue;\r\n    various areas of the body were colored in order further to\r\n    individualize the birds. Although the dyes disappeared in less than\r\n    a month, the markings were helpful on many occasions.\r\n\r\n    When an adult bird was captured I always sexed it and ordinarily\r\n    weighed and measured it. The nestlings were weighed and measured\r\n    daily at intervals of 24 hours. I built a corral of hardware cloth\r\n    around one Sharp-tailed Sparrow nest in order to measure the young\r\n    after they left the nest. The sex of any adult was ascertained by\r\n    examining the cloacal area, as described by Salt (1954:61-75). Sex\r\n    as determined by this method was corroborated by internal\r\n    examination of the specimens collected.\r\n\r\n    A pan balance accurate to one-tenth of a gram was used for\r\n    weighing. The adults were weighed in a cloth sack, the sack being\r\n    weighed each time to prevent error owing to variable moisture and\r\n    other factors.\r\n\r\n    Dragging the marsh with a rope was ineffectual in finding nests.\r\n    The birds flushed long before the rope neared them. I found nests\r\n    of the sparrows by using a blind. From a blind I would determine\r\n    the approximate location of a nest by watching the movements of the\r\n    adult birds. Then I would either make a direct search of the\r\n    vegetation or move the blind closer to find the actual site.\r\n\r\n    Many hours were spent in blinds. I had two in operation throughout\r\n    the breeding season, and it was from these that most of the data on\r\n    behavior were accumulated. Observations were made by means of a 7 x\r\n    50 coated binocular and on occasions by means of a 19.6x spotting\r\n    telescope.\r\n\r\n\r\n    DESCRIPTION OF THE AREA\r\n\r\n    The intensive work was carried out on the marshes west of the town\r\n    of Lavallette in Ocean County, New Jersey. Further observations\r\n    were made at other localities in the county, in particular at the\r\n    Chadwick marshes (plate 6), one mile north of the Lavallette site,\r\n    where many of the Ammospizas were banded. The breeding Ammospizas\r\n    of the localities are the nominate races, _A. c. caudacuta_\r\n    (Gmelin) and _A. m. maritima_ (Wilson).\r\n\r\n    Characteristic of the sand beaches of the Atlantic coast of the\r\n    United States are offshore bars which, when exposed, form long bays\r\n    parallel to the coastline. These bays become surrounded by marshes\r\n    that in turn are inhabited by the two species of _Ammospiza_. The\r\n    birds prefer the marshes closest to the ocean (plate 6). I made\r\n    trips to the marshes on the mainland side of upper Barnegat Bay and\r\n    found only a few Sharp-tailed Sparrows and no Seaside Sparrows in\r\n    residence.\r\n\r\n    The island of the Lavallette marshes that I worked on was\r\n    approximately 1400 feet long and 600 feet wide. One-third of the\r\n    east central end of the island was covered with sand fill, pumped\r\n    there several years before the study was begun (plate 1, fig. b).\r\n    The island was also ditched. The four east-west ditches are spaced\r\n    125 feet apart; the two ditches perpendicular to these are 340 feet\r\n    apart and are situated in the western portion of the island. These\r\n    ditches, originally dug as a means of decreasing the mosquito\r\n    population, are one foot wide and almost three feet deep. The\r\n    excavated earth is deposited in a row paralleling the ditch. The\r\n    entire island, excluding the sand fill is not more than two feet\r\n    above normal high tide. In August, 1955, abnormally high water, a\r\n    result of hurricane \"Connie\", rose four to five feet and covered\r\n    all but the tops of the bushes and a few mounds of sand. Low tides\r\n    expose no mud flats for the edges of the marsh are nearly vertical\r\n    banks and the water along the edges is more than one foot deep.\r\n\r\n    The average temperature for July, compiled over a 34 year period at\r\n    the Asbury Park weather station is 72.6°F. The average\r\n    precipitation from May through August, acquired over the same\r\n    length of time, is between 3.5 and 4.5 inches per month.\r\n\r\n    In spring and summer the prevailing winds are from the south and\r\n    southwest. Therefore, the south and west shores of the island are\r\n    subject to greater inundations by water. The fact that the island\r\n    is unprotected by neighboring islands from the open expanse of the\r\n    bay on this side is also of importance in this respect. The north\r\n    and east shores, on the lee side of the island, are guarded from\r\n    the open bay by nearby land. The exposed southern shores, where\r\n    there was open mud and sparse patches of cord-grass, were the\r\n    preferred feeding areas of the Seaside Sparrows. Lack of exposed\r\n    and open feeding areas may account for the absence of this species\r\n    in areas that otherwise seem to fulfill the requirements of the\r\n    species.\r\n\r\n    Two major drift lines were present on the island: one within a few\r\n    feet of the waterline consisted mostly of dead eel grass (Zostera\r\n    marina), and the other, situated close to the cattail strip,\r\n    contained a variety of flotsam (pl. 2, fig. a).\r\n\r\n\r\n    FLORA\r\n\r\n    The vegetation on the island consisted chiefly of smooth cord-grass\r\n    (_Spartina alterniflora_), black grass (_Juncus gerardi_), cattail\r\n    (_Typha_ sp.), and marsh-elder (_Iva frutescens_). Other plants\r\n    identified on the area were: common reed grass (_Phragmites\r\n    communis_) and slender grass wort (_Salicornia europea_). Black\r\n    grass grows on the inner, dryer portions of the marsh, and\r\n    cord-grass prefers the wetter portions, growing to the edge of the\r\n    water. The marsh-elder bushes mostly are restricted to the mounds\r\n    of earth dug from the ditches. Cattails, in general, grow in a\r\n    narrow band paralleling, but back a few yards from, the shoreline.\r\n    Areas of mixed black grass and cord-grass occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\n    REPTILES\r\n\r\n    Diamond-backed terrapins (_Malaclemys terrapin_) were the only\r\n    reptiles recorded from the study island. Several were taken on\r\n    land, but the majority were seen in the waters about the marsh.\r\n\r\n    On June 27 a black snake (_Coluber constrictor_) was seen in a\r\n    bushy area bordering a marsh on the mainland side of Barnegat Bay.\r\n    A few Sharp-tailed Sparrows were seen in the same locality and a\r\n    singing male (G. E. W. 559) with testes 14 x 8 mm. and a female (G.\r\n    E. W. 558) with a brood patch were collected.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MAMMALS\r\n\r\n    Only two species of mammals, both abundant, were present on the\r\n    study island: the meadow vole (_Microtus pennsylvanicus_) and the\r\n    muskrat (_Ondatra zibethicus_). The muskrats dug burrows beneath\r\n    the level of the water into the banks of the island, used the\r\n    ditches as routes to the interior of the marsh and built some small\r\n    houses, mostly from cattail stems.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PREDATORS\r\n\r\n    Unless the above named mammals preyed on the sparrows, all of the\r\n    enemies of the colony at Lavallette were avian. Both Crows (_Corvus\r\n    brachyrhynchos_) and Fish Crows (_Corvus ossifragus_) visited the\r\n    local marshes frequently as did a Marsh Hawk (_Circus cyaneus_). I\r\n    watched the Marsh Hawk make many passes at what I thought were\r\n    sparrows, but the only animal I ever saw caught by the hawk was a\r\n    _Microtus_. The sparrows were alarmed when the hawk appeared,\r\n    quickly and silently disappearing into the grass.\r\n\r\n    At least two nests on the Lavallette Marsh were destroyed by\r\n    predators in the course of the breeding season of 1955. One nest of\r\n    the Seaside Sparrow was empty when I checked it on July 3; on July\r\n    2 it had contained four young, three days old. On July 21 I found a\r\n    dead Sharp-tailed Sparrow, approximately three days old, lying on a\r\n    patch of matted grass. A hole was in the flank of the bird and\r\n    blood was present about the bill. This nestling was not from a nest\r\n    under observation.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PASSERINE ASSOCIATES\r\n\r\n    On the Lavallette marshes the only passerine associates of the two\r\n    species of _Ammospiza_ were Song Sparrows (_Melospiza melodia\r\n    atlantica_) and Long-billed Marsh Wrens (_Telmatodytes palustris\r\n    palustris_). Two pairs of Song Sparrows and less than six pairs of\r\n    marsh wrens nested on the study area. One Song Sparrow nest was\r\n    found and is plotted on the map (pl. 1, fig. b); the other pair\r\n    nested somewhere along the east shore of the island. The Song\r\n    Sparrows at the east end of the island obtained most of their food\r\n    from the grounds of the Lavallette Yacht Club across fifty yards of\r\n    water to the east. The pair that nested in the western portion of\r\n    the island fed along the sand fill or along the bases of the\r\n    marsh-elder. Their nest was built in the most extensive area of\r\n    these bushes; it was placed approximately one foot above the ground\r\n    in a small dead bush and gained support and concealment from the\r\n    surrounding black grass. Three of the four eggs hatched on June 30,\r\n    and the young left the nest on July 11. Both parents fed the\r\n    offspring.\r\n\r\n    The marsh wrens fed and nested in the cattails. I never saw these\r\n    wrens away from the cattails.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTER STATUS AND SPRING MIGRATION\r\n\r\nOcean County is ten miles south of the area treated in Cruickshank's\r\nregional work (1942). He considers both species as rare to casual\r\nwinter residents. Concerning the spring migration of the Sharp-tailed\r\nSparrow he says (p. 456) \"The first widespread wave never comes before\r\nApril 25, however, and most of the birds arrive in May.\" He mentions\r\nthat late May is the height of migration and that stragglers are\r\npassing through up to the middle of June. The arrival of the Seaside\r\nSparrow in spring is similar (p. 458): the first widespread movement is\r\nin early May, the peak is reached in the third week of the month, and\r\nstragglers have been recorded through the second week in June.\r\n\r\nI was in the field in Ocean County almost daily all spring and found no\r\nSeaside Sparrows and only two Sharp-tailed Sparrows north of Barnegat\r\nInlet, Ocean County, before May 5. I waded through the marshes at\r\nChadwick, Lavallette, and Island Beach State Park on April 27 when high\r\ntides covered all of the dense vegetation and saw no sparrows of the\r\nGenus _Ammospiza_. If many had been present on this date I would have\r\nseen them. On May 5 both species were plentiful on the Chadwick\r\nmarshes. Furthermore, the Seaside Sparrows were defending territories.\r\nThe absence of the two species the previous day indicates a large\r\nnocturnal flight.\r\n\r\nIt was during the second and third weeks in May that the sparrows of\r\nthis genus were most abundant. In this period many unbanded Seaside\r\nSparrows were in the patches of cattails that were being defended by\r\nthe resident males from other territory-holders.\r\n\r\nOne _Ammospiza caudacuta subvirgata_ (G. E. W. 545) was taken in the\r\ncourse of the study. It was a female (ovary: 7 x 5 mm.) weighing 15.3\r\ngrams (\"moderate fat\"), taken on June 8, 1955, on a marsh near the\r\nmouth of the Manasquan River on the Monmouth-Ocean County line. This\r\nmarsh is decidedly less brackish than the Lavallette and Chadwick\r\nmarshes. The specimen was the only _Ammospiza_ seen there and was\r\nprobably a migrant, despite the late date; this subspecies is known to\r\noccur late along the Atlantic Coast south of its breeding range.\r\nCruickshank (1942:454-455) considers the peak of spring migration for\r\nthis subspecies to be reached in late May.\r\n\r\nTo find _A. c. subvirgata_ in a marsh seemingly not saline enough for\r\nthe nominate race is not surprising. _A. c. subvirgata_ breeds in\r\nmarshes, along the coast of New England, which are almost fresh water\r\n(Montagna, 1942b:256). _A. c. caudacuta_ is only casual away from salt\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERRITORY\r\n\r\nIn a general treatise on the subject of territorialism, Nice (1933:98),\r\nsummarizing Howard, stated: \"Territory implies in the male bird\r\nisolation, advertisement, fixation, and intolerance.\" I concluded from\r\nmy observations that all four requirements are exhibited by male\r\nSeaside Sparrows while none of them is well developed in male\r\nSharp-tailed Sparrows. This subject is discussed separately for the two\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nTomkins (1941:38-51) studied populations of _Ammospiza maritima\r\nmacgillivrayii_ near the mouth of the Savannah River in South Carolina\r\nand Georgia and concluded that this form is not territorial. In support\r\nof his conclusions, he quoted Nice (1933:90-91) as follows: \"Territory\r\ncannot mean just the nest spot when the adults feed in common; this may\r\nbe 'nest territory,' but it is a very different matter from a territory\r\nin its strict sense to which parents confine themselves during the\r\nbreeding season. Again, the very essence of a territory lies in its\r\nexclusiveness; if a bird's range is not defended, it is not a\r\nterritory.\"\r\n\r\nThe feeding and nesting grounds of breeding Seaside Sparrows are often\r\nseparated by a portion of the marsh which is not used by the birds.\r\nThis complicates study of the territorial habits of the species. It\r\ndoes not mean, however, that the species is not territorial.\r\n\r\nThe birds studied by Tomkins had separate feeding and nesting grounds.\r\nConcerning this, Tomkins (1941:43) states that \"The Seaside Sparrows of\r\nthis locality [Savannah River area] often live where the two\r\nrequirements [adequate feeding grounds and suitable nesting cover] are\r\nnot always together or even meeting, but also where the feeding grounds\r\nand the nesting place are separated by a short distance.\"\r\n\r\nSix of the eight original pairs of breeding Seaside Sparrows of the\r\nLavallette colony fed in areas separate from those in which they\r\nnested. I found the eight nests of the original residents and banded\r\nand dyed all of the adults. The owners of two nests did not have\r\nseparate nesting and feeding areas. One nest was built within fifteen\r\nfeet of the south shore of the island, adjacent to the feeding area.\r\nThe other was built within a few feet of the north shore. The female of\r\nthis nest obtained food along the shore in the immediate vicinity of\r\nthe nest. Her mate was absent; in all probability it was the singing\r\nmale which I took from a nearby bush, before I found it advantageous to\r\nuse the island as a study area.\r\n\r\nThe remaining six pairs flew to the south or west shores of the island\r\nin order to feed. None of these six nests was more than 100 yards from\r\nthe feeding grounds (pl. 1, fig. b).\r\n\r\nIt was comparatively easy to see that the males defended an area\r\nsurrounding the nest. It was more difficult to see that the pairs fed\r\non separate plots of shoreline, each defended by the male, but I am\r\nconvinced that this was the case.\r\n\r\nThe nest area was defended by the males through singing and chasing. I\r\nsaw no instances of a female entering into territorial disputes;\r\nnevertheless, I did see a female chase a Sharp-tailed Sparrow away from\r\nthe vicinity of her nest.\r\n\r\nTomkins (1941:46) did not consider the song of _A. m. macgillivrayii_\r\nto be \"a declaration warning other birds away.\" After observing the\r\nbehavior of males of _A. m. maritima_ I am convinced that advertisement\r\nof intolerance is the primary purpose of song in this species. An\r\naccount of the activities of a male Seaside Sparrow on May 6 on the\r\nmarsh at Chadwick demonstrates this point. In an hour (6:01-7:01 a.m.)\r\nthe bird sang 395 times, an average of 6.6 times per minute. He faced\r\nhis nearest singing competitor when singing, which in the course of\r\nthis hour was usually a male approximately 250 feet away across a\r\ncreek. The two competitors almost always alternated their songs and\r\nfrequently the singing of one seemed to stimulate the other bird to\r\nsing. Although the song of the Seaside Sparrow is short and unmusical\r\nit is loud, especially when compared with the song of the Sharp-tailed\r\nSparrow. Elevated perches such as the tallest cattail stems or isolated\r\nbushes were used as singing and observation perches.\r\n\r\nThe chase of the Seaside Sparrow is not vigorous, but in all cases the\r\nintruder was seen to give way to the defender. I saw no physical fights\r\nbetween Seaside Sparrows. Chase by a defending bird was close to the\r\nground and directly toward the intruder. Sometimes the attacking male\r\nemitted chipping notes when first sighting or flying towards his\r\nadversary.\r\n\r\nIn the hour of observation mentioned above, no other Seaside Sparrows\r\nentered the bird's territory, which consisted of a strip of cattail and\r\nshoreline, 250 feet long and no more than 25 feet wide. At other times\r\nSeaside Sparrows did enter this male's territory, and he drove them out\r\nas soon as he saw them. Savannah and Swamp Sparrows, which for a few\r\nweeks migrated through the area, were not chased, but Sharp-tailed\r\nSparrows were chased at times.\r\n\r\nSeveral times I flushed a particular male Seaside Sparrow from the\r\nnorthwest tip of the Lavallette study island so that it flew to the\r\nisland to the north. Seaside Sparrows of this north island immediately\r\nmade themselves conspicuous by chipping and then drove the non-resident\r\nindividual back to its own territory.\r\n\r\nThe first time I heard what is described below as the social call of\r\nthe Seaside Sparrow was on June 30 when an unbanded sparrow alighted in\r\na marsh-elder bush near a nest. The individual called twice as it came\r\nnear. The sound immediately aroused the owners of the nest and the male\r\nflew directly toward the strange bird. The intruder quickly and\r\nsilently flew away.\r\n\r\nMy field notes refer to many other instances of territorial defense of\r\nthe nesting area; it seems superfluous to cite them here.\r\n\r\nAdditional proof of territorialism in Seaside Sparrows was obtained by\r\nidentifying and plotting the location of all the marked individuals,\r\nwhich I saw each day while systematically traversing all the available\r\nhabitat on the island. Surprisingly, I did not once record a resident\r\nSeaside Sparrow in what I considered another male's territory in the\r\nmonth and a half (June 15-August 1) that I worked on the island at\r\nLavallette.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the adult Seaside Sparrows did not search for food\r\ncommunally, or that different pairs did not utilize one particular area\r\nat different times was most apparent when the pairs were feeding young.\r\nFrom the blinds I first noted that the adults from any given nesting\r\nterritory always flew in the same direction towards the shore. After\r\nmoving a blind closer to the shore I noted that once an adult arrived\r\nat the open or sparsely vegetated shoreline, that adult restricted\r\nitself to a certain portion of the shoreline. These shoreline\r\nterritories were plotted on field maps and appear on the map in plate\r\n1, figure b. One method used to ascertain the boundaries of these\r\nshoreline feeding territories was a census taken from a boat. Many\r\ntimes I circled the island in a skiff identifying the marked sparrows\r\nas they appeared along the shore. The feeding sparrows were always\r\nfound in the same areas around the island. Straight lines can be drawn\r\nbetween the nest sites and feeding areas of each pair of Seaside\r\nSparrows without having any lines cross (pl. 1, fig. b). These lines\r\ncorrespond to the flyways used by each pair to go to and return from\r\nthe feeding area. I consider the area defended about the nest, the\r\nsegment of shoreline used by a pair of Seaside Sparrows and the\r\nconnecting flyway to constitute the territory of a male Seaside\r\nSparrow. If the flyways of any of the pairs had crossed, a situation of\r\nmutual exclusiveness would not have existed and a territory could not\r\nhave been defined for the species.\r\n\r\nIt is generally agreed that territorial species engage in a minimum of\r\nfighting. Song and display have been evolved to substitute for actual\r\ncombat which demands a greater amount of energy. Additionally, the mere\r\npresence of an individual in an area previously established as its\r\nterritory probably serves to keep birds of nearby territories away. I\r\nthink that male Seaside Sparrows defend the feeding area and flyway as\r\na part of their territory by advertisement through use of these areas.\r\nThe birds at Lavallette rarely sang on the feeding grounds and I noted\r\nonly a few chases originating there. The sparrows rarely landed along\r\nthe flyways. The constant use of these areas probably served as\r\nterritorial defense, however. This supposition is supported by the fact\r\nthat feeding areas and flyways of different pairs were mutually\r\nexclusive.\r\n\r\nNice (1941:457) divided territory into six categories. Type A (mating,\r\nnesting, and feeding ground for young) is the type exhibited by the\r\nSeaside Sparrow. The territory of a male Seaside Sparrow must contain\r\nan area of open mud and/or sparse vegetation where food can be obtained\r\nand also enough suitable cover to conceal the nest. I suspect in the\r\ncase of the few males studied on the marshes at Chadwick that the\r\nterritories the males established (strips of cattails and adjacent\r\nshoreline) did not have suitable nesting cover, because these males\r\nwere unmated on June 15 when I left this study area because of human\r\ninterference. Suitable nesting cover and feeding areas were separated\r\nby short distances of unusable marsh for most of the sparrows on the\r\nLavallette study area. This fact caused the adults to commute from one\r\nsite to the other. Photographs of shoreline habitat suitable for\r\nfeeding by Seaside Sparrows appear in plate 2.\r\n\r\nThe area defended about the nest tended to follow the rows of\r\nmarsh-elder bushes (pl. 3, fig. a), probably because these bushes\r\nsupplied suitable song and observation perches. The segments of\r\nshoreline used by each pair were less than 75 yards in length and\r\nscarcely 20 feet wide. I never recorded Seaside Sparrows foraging in\r\nthe interior of the marsh.\r\n\r\nSharp-tailed Sparrows were more abundant than Seaside Sparrows on the\r\nmarshes at Chadwick and Lavallette. Sharp-tailed Sparrows were the more\r\ndifficult to net because of the peculiar organization of the colonies.\r\nThis organization, described below, also made nests of that species the\r\nmore difficult to find. Only intensive netting at both localities\r\nproduced enough marked individuals for me to study the breeding\r\nbehavior of the species.\r\n\r\nAt Chadwick, where I netted most of the 85 Sharp-tailed Sparrows that I\r\nbanded, my efforts were concentrated on one segment of the marsh.\r\nMarking made it evident that the males were not territorial, although\r\nthey did confine themselves to what might appropriately be called a\r\nbreeding home range, the area to which an individual confines itself in\r\nthe course of one nesting attempt. Observations of marked birds also\r\nindicated that there was considerable overlap of the breeding home\r\nranges of individual males.\r\n\r\nI recorded a few marked Sharp-tailed Sparrows often enough and over a\r\nlong enough period (more than one month) to gain a good idea of the\r\nsize of the breeding home range of the males, which I estimate to be\r\nthree to four acres. This estimate was made at Chadwick, where large\r\nareas of suitable uniform habitat occur. Females are more secretive\r\nthan males, but seem to restrict themselves to areas considerably\r\nsmaller than those of the males. My observations of two females that\r\nwere feeding young indicated that each female restricted herself to an\r\narea of less than one acre. Female Sharp-tailed Sparrows possibly are\r\nterritorial, although I recorded no disputes that would substantiate\r\nthis possibility.\r\n\r\nIf I am correct in my estimates of size of breeding home range in\r\nSharp-tailed Sparrows (males, three to four acres; females,\r\napproximately one acre), certain observations made by Montagna and me\r\nare readily explainable.\r\n\r\nMy netting operations indicated a surplus of male Sharp-tailed Sparrows\r\nin a given area. At Chadwick, I netted as many Sharp-tailed Sparrows as\r\nI could, without regard to sex. Here I captured 39 males and 16 females\r\n(six individuals remained unsexed). On the Lavallette study island,\r\nnetting was more selective; here I attempted to net the females of the\r\nnests I found. The sex ratio at Lavallette was 15 males to eight\r\nfemales (one juvenile was not sexed). Three of the eight females were\r\nnetted at their nests.\r\n\r\nMontagna (1940:196) decided from collecting and observations that male\r\nSharp-tailed Sparrows either outnumbered the females or were\r\npolygamous. The results I obtained from netting seemed to indicate a\r\nsurplus of males. Banding, however, showed that in the breeding season\r\nmales range over a larger area than do females. With this knowledge,\r\nthe discrepancy between the number of males and females captured is\r\nexplainable without an unbalanced sex ratio. If the males range over an\r\narea four times as large as that of the females, theoretically, four\r\ntimes as many males should be caught at every placement of the net\r\nprovided the net remained in place long enough to capture all the birds\r\nusing the area. In practice, this is essentially what occurred.\r\n\r\nOther behaviorisms of this species indicate that it is not territorial.\r\nThe song of the male is not loud and does not seem to be an\r\nadvertisement to other birds. In fact, the song of this species is so\r\nquiet and lengthy when compared to that of the Seaside Sparrow that I\r\nat first thought I was hearing \"whisper\" or \"practice\" songs. These\r\nqualities of the song seem to indicate that the \"advertising\" function\r\nof song of territorial species is lacking or unimportant in\r\nSharp-tailed Sparrows.\r\n\r\nI suspect that male Sharp-tailed Sparrows do not even know where nests\r\nare. On July 18 at 7:00 a.m. I was watching a nest from a nearby blind\r\nwhen an unbanded male (I saw the individual sing later) appeared. As\r\nthe bird foraged through the black grass, it headed directly toward the\r\nnest. When the male was almost one foot from the nest the incubating\r\nfemale left. She ran from the tussock and flew a short distance away to\r\na cattail stem. From here she watched the male, which seemingly\r\noblivious continued foraging, coming within inches of the nest. As the\r\nmale walked away from the nest the female returned. At 8:00 p.m. the\r\nsame day I was in the blind again. The female was out searching for\r\nfood when a different, banded male appeared. In his foraging, the male\r\nwalked up on the grass stems over the nest. The male apparently saw the\r\nyoung (two had hatched on July 17 and one on July 18) for he turned his\r\nhead and seemed to peer down under the stems. The female appeared (with\r\nfood) as he was doing this; she flew directly toward him and he flew\r\naway. The male was not seen near the nest in later observations.\r\n\r\nOn July 1 (6:50 a.m.) I was in a blind near another nest as the female\r\napproached with food for the young. At this moment a male appeared and\r\nthe female immediately flew away. The male perched on a tussock within\r\ntwo feet of the nest, sang, and then flew off. The female reappeared in\r\na few seconds without the food. She searched through a clump of black\r\ngrass four feet from the nest, caught a small, pale green insect, fed\r\nit to her one young (there were also two eggs in the nest) and began\r\nbrooding.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOICE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Song_\r\n\r\nOnly males of the two species sing. The normal song of the Seaside\r\nSparrow lasts just under two seconds, the buzzing final note\r\nconstituting three-quarters of the song. Saunders (1951:257-258)\r\ndescribes this song as short, and buzzlike, beginning with two or three\r\nshort, rather faint notes and ending in a trill at first loud but\r\nfading away toward the end. The introductory notes are followed by a\r\nhigher-pitched, loud, strongly accented, but buzzy note. This note is\r\nusually higher than the final trill and connected with it. The song has\r\nbeen written as _tup tup ZEE reeeeeeeeee_ and _tup TEE tle reeeeeeeeeee_\r\n(Saunders, 1951:257), _cutcut_, _zhé-eeeeeeeee_ (Peterson, 1947:232)\r\nand _che-zheéeege_, _che-zhée_, _che-wéege_, _chur-zhée_ and\r\n_too-szheée_ (Stone, 1937:910). My field notes contain the following:\r\n_CHUR-er eeeee_, _CHUR eeeeee_ and _oka-CHE weeeee_. These variations\r\nin the phonetic representation of the songs are attributable mostly to\r\nthe birds. Not only is there variation among individuals, but also\r\nindividuals vary their songs. Birds that I heard giving a characteristic\r\nsong suddenly sang a different type for awhile, and then reverted to\r\nthe original. The bill is elevated and opens considerably with each\r\nnote; the head bobs with the loud note. Typical singing postures are\r\nshown by Tomkins (1941: pl. 3).\r\n\r\nThe song of the Sharp-tailed Sparrow, as described by Saunders\r\n(1951:256-257), is short and insectlike, introduced by one or two short\r\nnotes; the remainder is a somewhat wheezy trill, growing fainter\r\ntowards the end. Sometimes there are two trills on different pitches,\r\nand occasionally a final short, low note. The quality is as though the\r\nsound _sh_ ran through all but the introductory notes. Saunders writes\r\nthese trills as: _tsup tsup shreeeeeeeee_ and _tip tish eeeeee\r\nshaaaaaaay_. The bill is opened slightly with each note, as I saw when\r\nI watched a singing bird with the sun directly behind it. Montagna\r\n(1942a:116) noted that _A. c. caudacuta_ sang less often than the more\r\nnorthern _A. c. subvirgata_.\r\n\r\nBoth species have specialized flight songs, but in the birds that I\r\nstudied these songs were infrequent and seemingly unimportant. The\r\nflight song of the Seaside Sparrows consisted of a double version of\r\nthe normal song. Although I heard it only a few times, the flight song\r\nof the Sharp-tailed Sparrow seemed slightly louder than the normal\r\nsong. This song is given by both species as the bird flutters upward\r\nten or 20 feet and glides back down.\r\n\r\nSinging begins at daylight and decreases at 9 or 10:00 a.m. when the\r\ntemperature rises. On cloudy days singing seemed to last longer.\r\nTowards dusk singing again increases, but not to the frequency of the\r\nmorning peak.\r\n\r\nThe major differences between the songs of the two species are in\r\nloudness, length, and frequency. The fact that the Seaside Sparrow\r\nsings louder than the Sharp-tailed Sparrow is mentioned by Stone\r\n(1937:906). On windless days I heard singing Seaside Sparrows more than\r\n200 yards away; Sharp-tailed Sparrows were inaudible at distances of\r\nmore than 40 yards. The song of a Seaside Sparrow is rarely longer than\r\ntwo seconds; the song of a Sharp-tailed Sparrow usually lasts for\r\nalmost 20 seconds and consists of a variable number of phrases like\r\nthose described by Saunders. A Seaside Sparrow that I watched for one\r\nhour sang 395 times or 6.6 times per minute. I doubt that any of the\r\nSharp-tailed Sparrows sang more than 20 times per hour, although I made\r\nno comparable count.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Seaside Sparrows sing from exposed perches such as tall\r\ncattail stems and tall or isolated marsh-elder bushes. Sharp-tailed\r\nSparrows do not often use conspicuous perches for singing. They sing\r\nwhile on the ground or when in flight. They do use exposed perches as\r\nobservation posts and occasionally sing from them.\r\n\r\nSeaside Sparrows often face their nearest neighbor when singing and\r\nalternate songs with this bird. The one time Sharp-tailed Sparrows\r\nalmost always sing is when they are involved in fighting. In such a\r\ncase the several birds sing simultaneously.\r\n\r\nSeaside Sparrows began singing the morning after their nocturnal\r\narrival. For resident birds, singing is at its maximum at this time and\r\nis maintained at a high level throughout incubation. At hatching of the\r\neggs, singing declines sharply; males then are busy aiding in care of\r\nthe young. Males that have successfully reared a brood rarely sing\r\nafter the young leave the nest.\r\n\r\nSharp-tailed Sparrows sang infrequently when they first arrived, and\r\nsinging did not reach its peak until late May. By August singing had\r\nalmost ceased in this species.\r\n\r\nSong of the Seaside Sparrow functions importantly in the establishment\r\nand maintenance of its territory. Newly-arrived males sing vigorously.\r\nIn the Sharp-tailed Sparrow I think song is merely an expression of\r\nsexual excitement because song does not reach maximum frequency until\r\nthe females arrive and become receptive to the males.\r\n\r\nDifferences in song correspond to differences in territorial behavior.\r\nThe distinct, loud song, sung often and from exposed perches, which is\r\nfrequently alternated with that of the nearest competitor, is given by\r\nthe Seaside Sparrow, a territorial species. The indistinct, quiet song,\r\nsung infrequently and often from unexposed places belongs to the\r\nSharp-tailed Sparrow, a non-territorial species.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Calls_\r\n\r\nSeaside Sparrows give a soft, lisping call note, probably the one\r\nreferred to by Saunders as a squeaky _tseep_ (1951:258), that functions\r\nas a social call. When migrants were numerous on the marshes at\r\nChadwick I heard this note often. At Lavallette I did not hear it\r\nuntil June 30 (work began there on June 16) and then it was from an\r\nunbanded, non-resident bird. In late July and in August the number of\r\nnon-resident sparrows increased and the social call was heard often. I\r\nnever heard a resident bird give this call. On December 29, 1955, on a\r\nmarsh at the mouth of the Manasquan River on the Monmouth-Ocean County\r\nline, a group of wintering Seaside Sparrows frequently used this call.\r\nI do not know whether the Sharp-tailed Sparrow has a comparable call.\r\n\r\nBoth species emit alarm notes. Although variable, the Seaside Sparrow\r\nhas two general types. One, recorded by me as a short _chip_ or _tick_\r\nwas given by both sexes whenever I was near a nest. The other type, a\r\nhigh, sharp _tsip_, is indicative of a higher degree of excitement.\r\nWhen I captured young already out of the nest, or when I investigated\r\nnests containing young old enough to depart, the adults gave this call.\r\nThe tail is jerked downward each time this note is given.\r\n\r\nThe alarm call of the Sharp-tailed Sparrow is not so loud as that of\r\nthe Seaside Sparrow and it is not given so often. I described it as a\r\nshort _tsick_ or _tsuck_. Females emitted such calls when I was at\r\ntheir nests or when male Sharp-tailed Sparrows came near their nests.\r\nMales may have a similar call, but I never recorded it. Montagna\r\n(1942a:116) remarks on the quietness of this species. This is\r\nespecially evident when one compares Sharp-tailed Sparrows with Seaside\r\nSparrows.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE 1\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. _a_.

Stems of black grass were parted to take the picture. The outer\r\nrim of this nest (lower right) is made of living stems of black grass.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPULATION\r\n\r\nIn late June at the Lavallette area there was an influx of unbanded\r\nSeaside Sparrows. Certain of these new arrivals established territories\r\nin areas unoccupied by the remaining original residents. These new\r\nresidents were birds that probably had unsuccessful nestings elsewhere.\r\nBecause of tropical storms that almost covered the island with water in\r\nAugust, I doubt that any of these late nestings were successful. On\r\nJuly 7 at 8:30 a.m., while watching a pair of these new arrivals, I\r\nrecorded my only observation of copulation in the Seaside Sparrow. The\r\nfemale seemed to be searching for a nest site when copulation occurred.\r\nThe female crawled about in a marsh-elder bush seemingly testing the\r\nvarious forks in the branches for size. The male followed her,\r\nremaining a few inches above and behind. Several times the two birds\r\ndisappeared in the lower branches and were hidden by the surrounding\r\nblack grass. Finally, while the female squatted on a branch the male\r\nmounted. He fluttered his wings before mounting and continued to do so\r\nas coition took place.\r\n\r\nI began observations at Lavalette on June 16, too late to observe\r\ncopulation of the early residents. All the nests contained eggs by that\r\ntime. At Chadwick, pair formation seemingly never occurred, at least\r\nwith the males I was studying. The territories established by males at\r\nChadwick contained few marsh-elder bushes. Possibly females, finding no\r\nsuitable nest sites, refused to accept these territories.\r\n\r\nCopulation in the Sharp-tailed Sparrow was observed several times. It\r\noccurs most frequently in the course of, or immediately following, a\r\nfight between several males. I do not know what instigates the\r\ngathering of several males into these groups; it may be a certain\r\nbehaviorism of a female, or possibly, merely the appearance of a\r\nfemale. Montagna (1942a:117) was convinced that females of _A. c.\r\nsubvirgata_ were present in these fights. On the other hand, in two\r\ninstances with _A. c. diversa_ where he collected all the birds in the\r\ngroup, no females were present. Twice, at Chadwick, my observations\r\nindicated that females of _A. c. caudacuta_ were not always involved in\r\nthese groups. In these instances all the birds in the group had\r\npreviously been banded and diagnosed as males. Possibly a female was\r\nthe original stimulus of these groups, and she may have disappeared\r\nwhile the males were fighting with each other. I found it difficult to\r\ndistinguish fighting males from a copulating pair. On June 3, however,\r\na banded pair was observed. Copulation occurred on the ground. The male\r\nfluttered his wings as he mounted and the female remained motionless.\r\nCopulation lasted approximately three seconds; immediately thereafter\r\nthe male flew to a nearby cattail stem and the female climbed a tussock\r\nof grass and chipped quietly. This same female was seen to copulate\r\nwith other males, and males were observed copulating with several\r\nfemales.\r\n\r\n_A. m. maritima_ is monogamous, the pair-bond being maintained\r\nthroughout a breeding cycle. _A. c. caudacuta_ is promiscuous,\r\nrelations between the sexes being limited to copulation. For _A. c.\r\nsubvirgata_ a relationship other than promiscuity has been intimated\r\n(Lewis, 1920:587-589). Concerning observations of the nest he found at\r\nYarmouth, Nova Scotia, Lewis wrote: \"The nest was found after I had\r\nquietly watched the parent Sparrows for about an hour, while they were\r\nbringing food to their young.... The male sang from time to time from a\r\npiece of driftwood on the marsh about 30 feet distant from the nest.\r\nWhen I was examining the nest and the young birds, the parents made no\r\ndemonstration for some minutes, but later they came near and uttered\r\nchip's, much like those of Savannah Sparrows.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNESTS\r\n\r\nI found the nests of all eight pairs of Seaside Sparrows which nested\r\non the Lavallette study island in 1955. Four nests were supported by\r\nmarsh-elder bushes, three of which were dead. These nests were placed\r\nlow enough to be hidden by numerous stems of black grass, as were the\r\nother four nests. Of the remaining four nests, three were placed in\r\ntussocks of black grass and the fourth one gained support mostly from\r\ncord-grass stems. The eight nests ranged from 9 to 11 inches (9.6 inch\r\naverage) from the rim to the ground, the four nests in the bushes being\r\nthe highest. The outside diameters of the nests ranged from 3 to 4.5\r\ninches (3.9 inch average) and the outside depth varied between 2 and\r\n3.5 inches (2.7 inch average). Seven of the nests had an inside depth\r\nof 1.5 inches; the other one was only an inch from the rim to the\r\nfloor. The inside diameter of the cup varied between 2 and 2.5 inches.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above all eight nests were shielded by stems of black\r\ngrass. Stems were not woven over the nests by the birds; rather it was\r\nthe choice of the nest sites that resulted in the concealment. The only\r\nplant used for nest material was black grass.\r\n\r\nIn all cases the black grass limited the directions from which the\r\nnests could be entered. Six of the nests were approached from a\r\ndirection varying between northeast and southeast. The prevailing winds\r\nof spring and summer are from the south and southwest; the black grass\r\nconsequently leans in the opposite direction. The remaining two nests\r\nwere entered from the northwest. These were nests built in marsh-elder\r\nbushes where the grass stems were held upright by the branches of the\r\nbushes.\r\n\r\nOne nest, built in a small dead marsh-elder bush, was tilted by the\r\ngrowth of stems of black grass which were used for support on one side.\r\nThis tilting did not cause the contents to spill, but, I judged, did\r\ncause the adults to desert the nest.\r\n\r\nSeven nests of the Sharp-tailed Sparrow were found; two of these were\r\nold nests. Four of the five nests used in the breeding season of 1955\r\nwere found on the Lavallette marsh study area, the other one I\r\ndiscovered on the Chadwick marshes. Two young Sharp-tailed Sparrows\r\nthat I saw at Lavallette were not from nests I found, nor were they\r\nfrom the same nest. Therefore, a minimum of six Sharp-tailed Sparrows\r\nbred on the Lavallette island. Measurements were taken of only the five\r\nnests that were used in 1955. The Sharp-tailed Sparrow builds its nest\r\ncloser to the ground than does the Seaside Sparrow. The five nests were\r\nfive to six inches off the ground; the two nests of a previous year\r\nappeared to have been no higher. The Sharp-tailed Sparrow nests were\r\nbuilt in areas where black grass was the predominant plant, and the\r\nnests were constructed entirely from this grass. The outside diameters\r\nvaried from 3 to 4.25 inches (3.4 inch average). The outside depth of\r\nthe nests varied from 2 to 3.5 inches (2.8 inch average). The inside\r\ndepth was 1.5 inches in all nests and the inside diameter ranged from 2\r\nto 2.5 inches (2.1 inch average).\r\n\r\nHarrison F. Lewis (1920:587) studied a nest of _A. c. subvirgata_ in a\r\nsmall salt marsh near Bunker's Island at the southern end of Yarmouth\r\nHarbor, Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, which he found on June 12, 1920. For\r\ndetails of this nest I quote Dr. Lewis. \"The nest proper was a neat,\r\nround cup of fine, dry, dead grass, with some horsehair in the lining.\r\nIts foundation consisted of some small masses of 'eel-grass' and roots.\r\nIts dimensions were: inside diameter, 2.5 in.; outside diameter, 4.5\r\nin.; inside depth, 1.5 in.; outside depth 2.375 in. It was elevated\r\nabove the general surface of the marsh by being placed on the top of a\r\nlow, grassy ridge, about fourteen inches high, formed from material\r\nthrown up when a ditch was dug across the marsh, many years before.\r\nDuring some storm a mat of dead 'eel-grass' had been left on top of\r\nthis ridge, and this had later been lifted by the growing marsh grass,\r\nleaving several inches between it and the ground. The nest was placed\r\non the northwest edge of this mat, about half of the nest being under\r\nit, while the other side was sheltered and concealed by grass about six\r\ninches high. The nest was not sunk in the ground at all.\"\r\n\r\nTwo of the nests found were entered from the north-northeast, the other\r\nthree from the east-southeast. All five nests were sheltered above by\r\nstems of black grass. Three of the nests were beneath a layer of dead\r\nblack grass where a clump of erect living stems parted the mat. One\r\nnest (pl. 4, fig. a) was situated where cattail stubs held the black\r\ngrass somewhat erect. Green stalks as well as dead stalks were woven\r\ninto a canopy over this nest. Another nest was constructed on a mat of\r\nblack grass under and among numerous horizontal living stems, some of\r\nwhich were woven into the outer lining of the nest (pl. 4, fig. b).\r\n\r\nNests of both species were found in tussocks of black grass. The\r\nlocations of these sites differed. The Sharp-tailed Sparrow prefers the\r\nhigher and therefore dryer portions of the marsh where black grass is\r\nthe characteristic plant. Contrastingly the Seaside Sparrow almost\r\nalways chooses the wetter portions of the marsh (Cruickshank, 1942:45;\r\nForbush and May, 1939:514; Stone, 1937:906; personal observations)\r\nwhere several species of plants are abundant. In areas that have been\r\nditched, as have almost all marshes in New Jersey, the mound of\r\nexcavated muck is ideal for the growth of marsh-elder. Rows of these\r\nbushes are present on many of the marshes of New Jersey (pl. 3, fig.\r\na). The location of four of the eight Seaside Sparrow nests in these\r\n\"hedgerows\" indicates that they provide suitable, if not preferred,\r\nsites for the species.\r\n\r\n\r\nEGGS AND INCUBATION\r\n\r\nI found no nests of either species before they contained a complete\r\ncomplement of eggs and therefore was unable to ascertain the incubation\r\nperiod for these species. Brood patches were evident on female\r\nSharp-tailed Sparrows by June 1, probably indicating that laying began\r\nnear this date. Cruickshank (1942:456) lists egg dates of the\r\nSharp-tailed Sparrow as concentrated in early June, with extremes of\r\nMay 19 and August 4. He thinks the species probably has two broods. For\r\nthe Seaside Sparrow, Cruickshank (1942:458) states there is probably\r\nbut one brood and that egg dates are concentrated in early June, with\r\nextremes May 23 and July 2. Stone (1937:907, 911) considers four eggs a\r\nnormal clutch for both species, but cites instances where three and\r\nfive eggs were thought to be complete sets. Four of the eight Seaside\r\nSparrow nests I found contained at least three eggs, and four contained\r\nat least four eggs. Four of the five Sharp-tailed Sparrow nests I found\r\ncontained at least three eggs and one contained four eggs.\r\n\r\nFemale Seaside Sparrows do all of the incubation. The male, while the\r\nfemale is on the nest, remains a short distance away. He sings often\r\nand gives alarm notes when there is a local disturbance. These chipping\r\nnotes bring the female off the nest, and then they both chip at the\r\nintruder. The male accompanies the female to the feeding grounds and\r\nnormally they return together.\r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, male Sharp-tailed Sparrows take no part in the\r\nnesting activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nYOUNG\r\n\r\nI studied growth and changes in behavior of the young. Since I could\r\nsee no behavioral differences between the nestlings of the two species,\r\nthis subject will be discussed jointly for the two forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Growth_\r\n\r\nThe color of the natal downs of both species is similar. Dwight\r\n(1900:190), who saw newly hatched nestlings only of the Sharp-tailed\r\nSparrow, described the color as grayish wood-brown. A series of white\r\nneossoptiles is present at the posterior end of the ventral tract in\r\nboth species. These feathers are more numerous in the Seaside Sparrow.\r\nDwight (1900:98) saw no neossoptiles on the underparts of any of the\r\npasserines he examined. Seaside Sparrows have a mid-dorsal row of downs\r\nin the dorsal tract near the uropygium. These feathers are lacking in\r\nthe Sharp-tailed Sparrow and constitute the major difference, in this\r\nplumage, between the two species. The neossoptiles of three Seaside\r\nSparrows and one Sharp-tailed Sparrow were counted. These counts were\r\nchecked on the young birds studied in the field. The number and\r\nplacement of these feathers appear in plate five. There appears to be a\r\nconsistently greater number of natal downs in Seaside Sparrows, when\r\ncompared with Sharp-tailed Sparrows.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 1--DAILY WEIGHT IN GRAMS OF NESTLING SEASIDE SPARROWS AND\r\nSHARP-TAILED SPARROWS FROM LAVALLETTE, OCEAN CO., NEW JERSEY.\r\n\r\n  ======+================================================================+\r\n    Day |                   _Ammospiza maritima_               | Average |\r\n  ------+---------+------+---------+------+------+------+------+---------+\r\n   0    |     ... |  2.2 |     2.3 |  ... |  ... |  2.2 |  1.8 |    2.1  |\r\n   1    |     3.0 |  3.3 |     3.5 |  3.7 |  3.3 |  2.6 |  2.1 |    3.1  |\r\n   2    |     4.6 |  5.0 |     5.2 |  5.0 |  4.8 |  3.7 |  3.0 |    4.5  |\r\n   3    |     7.0 |  5.5 |     7.2 |  6.9 |  6.9 |  5.9 |  4.7 |    6.3  |\r\n   4    |     9.4 |  8.1 |    10.6 |  9.1 |  9.1 |  7.6 |  6.4 |    8.6  |\r\n   5    |    12.5 | 11.1 |    12.3 | 11.4 | 11.1 |  9.9 |  8.7 |   11.0  |\r\n   6    |    14.6 | 13.1 | [1]11.1 | 13.9 | 13.7 | 12.6 |  9.6 |   13.0  |\r\n   7    | [1]11.6 | 13.9 |    12.1 | 15.1 | 14.8 | 14.3 | 11.8 |   13.7  |\r\n   8    |    14.9 | 15.5 |    13.4 | 14.9 | 14.8 | 14.6 | 12.4 |   14.4  |\r\n   9    |    15.2 | 15.8 |    13.8 | 16.2 | 16.1 | 16.0 | 14.4 |   15.4  |\r\n  10    |     ... |  ... |     ... |  ... | 15.9 | 15.5 | 14.3 |   15.2  |\r\n  ------+---------+------+---------+------+------+------+------+---------+\r\n\r\n  ------+---------+------+---------+------+------+---------+\r\n    Day |         _Ammospiza caudacuta_          | Average |\r\n  ------+---------+------+---------+------+------+---------+\r\n   0    |   1.6   |  ... |    1.8  |  1.7 |  1.7 |    1.7  |\r\n   1    |   1.8   |  2.3 |    2.5  |  3.0 |  2.1 |    2.3  |\r\n   2    |   3.3   |  2.7 |    4.1  |  4.6 |  3.1 |    3.6  |\r\n   3    |   5.0   |  3.7 |    5.9  |  6.4 |  4.7 |    5.1  |\r\n   4    |   6.8   |  5.4 |    8.4  |  9.1 |  6.7 |    7.3  |\r\n   5    |   8.6   |  6.9 |   10.7  | 11.2 |  9.5 |    9.4  |\r\n   6    |  10.2   |  8.9 |   12.8  | 13.0 | 10.9 |   11.2  |\r\n    7   |  12.1   | 11.4 |   14.5  | 13.6 | 12.3 |   12.8  |\r\n   8    |  13.5   | 12.9 |   15.3  | 14.5 | 13.3 |   13.9  |\r\n   9    |  12.2   | 13.4 |   15.9  | 14.9 | 13.6 |   14.0  |\r\n  10    |  12.7   | 14.0 |   15.5  | 15.0 | 14.0 |   14.2  |\r\n  11    |   ...   |  ... |   ...   | 15.1 | 14.4 |    ...  |\r\n  ------+---------+------+---------+------+------+---------+\r\n\r\n      [1] These weights are not figured in the averages; see text.\r\n\r\nSeven nestling Seaside Sparrows and five nestling Sharp-tailed Sparrows\r\nwere weighed at 24-hour intervals until they left their nests. The\r\nbirds were weighed in early morning before they had received much food.\r\nWeights of these individuals, and daily averages for each species are\r\nshown in Table 1. The weights in the zero column were of nestlings that\r\nhad not been fed. The weight of one hatchling (1.9 gm.), which does not\r\nappear in the table, is included in the average for the zero column.\r\nTwo young Seaside Sparrows, approximately a week old, fell out of a\r\nnest between 9:30 a.m. July 6 and 5:30 a.m. July 7. When I found them\r\nbelow the nest, at the latter time, their temperatures were far below\r\nnormal, and they had lost a considerable amount of weight. These\r\nabnormally low weights were not figured in the averages. The weights of\r\nSharp-tailed Sparrows 11 days old were obtained by confining the birds\r\nto the vicinity of the nest with a screen.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. The development of the young of Seaside Sparrows\r\n(solid line) and Sharp-tailed Sparrows (dotted line) as evidenced by\r\nfour linear measurements taken at 24 hour intervals.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt hatching and throughout nestling life and post nestling life Seaside\r\nSparrows average heavier than Sharp-tailed Sparrows of comparable age\r\n(Table 1). Weights of adults of the two species that were netted or\r\ncollected between May 6 and June 27, 1955, within two miles of\r\nChadwick, Ocean County, New Jersey, follow: Fourteen males of\r\n_Ammospiza maritima_ averaged 24.2 gm. (21.9-27.4 gm.); three females\r\naveraged 22.3 gm. (19.8-24.4 gm.). Thirty-three males of _A.\r\ncaudacuta_ averaged 20.7 gm. (18.0-23.1, 25.8 gm.); 14 females\r\naveraged 17.8 gm. (15.3-19.0 gm.), 2.9 gm. less than the males. One\r\nfemale Sharp-tailed Sparrow, weighing 23.1 gm., was not included in the\r\naverages because it had an egg with shell in the oviduct.\r\n\r\nMontagna (1940:195-196) weighed a series of breeding Sharp-tailed\r\nSparrows (21 males; 5 females) from Popham Beach, Maine, and found the\r\nmales to be only 0.2 gm. heavier than the females, but he stated that\r\nthe small number of females weighed, and the high percentage of these\r\nthat contained eggs, probably lessened the difference in weight found\r\nat other seasons.\r\n\r\nThe four linear measurements that I took on the same series of adults\r\nconfirmed the size difference: Seaside Sparrows average larger than\r\nSharp-tailed Sparrows, and males average larger than females in both\r\nspecies. The average and range for each measurement taken on the\r\nsparrows is presented in Table 2.\r\n\r\nFour linear measurements were also taken daily on the young sparrows. A\r\nsummary of these data appears in Figure 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Behavior_\r\n\r\nThe first indication of hatching is a crack in the side of the egg\r\nalong the line of greatest circumference. The crack is extended along\r\nthis line by the egg tooth, and then contraction of muscles of the neck\r\nby the embryo separates the shell into two pieces. Extension of the\r\nlegs frees the bird from the shell. I held the eggs of two Seaside\r\nSparrows in my hand and watched this procedure. In each instance the\r\nyoung bird defecated in the shell before freeing itself. A barely\r\naudible \"peep\" note was heard from one hatchling Sharp-tailed Sparrow\r\nwhen I held it near my ear. When free from the shell, the young birds\r\nrest on their tarsi, abdomen and forehead; their down dries in a few\r\nminutes, and their skin becomes noticeably darker. One sparrow gaped\r\nfive minutes after hatching and all the young gaped later the same day.\r\nThe abdomen of the young becomes distended when they are fed by the\r\nparents.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 5\r\n\r\n_Ammospiza caudacuta_\r\n\r\n_Ammospiza maritima_\r\n\r\nDrawings of the nestlings of the two species of _Ammospiza_\r\napproximately three days of age showing the variation in the amount and\r\nplacement of the neossoptiles in the two species.

The young are better able to right themselves, and\r\nmany feather papillae show distinctly through the skin.\r\n\r\nOn the second day young are capable of moving short distances by using\r\ntheir wings and feet. A thick ridge of tissue forms over the eyeball\r\nwhere the eyelids later delaminate. The call is now a double version of\r\nthe \"peep\" note described above.\r\n\r\nWhen the young are three days old the eyelids open, but only slightly.\r\nIn the next three days the young become better co-ordinated and the\r\neyes open fully. The egg tooth was last seen on a young bird on the\r\nsixth day. All incoming feathers remain sheathed until the seventh day.\r\n\r\nOn the seventh day young show the first signs of cowering. Previously,\r\nthey all begged when I came to the nest. The remiges remain sheathed,\r\nbut the body feathers emerge from the tips of the sheaths. A quiet\r\nreedy call replaces the \"peep\" note. A quiet, but squealing distress\r\ncall was also first noted on the seventh day, when the young were\r\nhandled.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth day the remigial sheaths become gray (previously they\r\nwere dark blue) and begin to slough off. When removed from the nest,\r\nthe young attempt to escape. Begging is less frequent and cowering is\r\nthe predominant attitude towards intruders.\r\n\r\nThe first young of both species left the nest on the ninth day. It must\r\nbe remembered, however, that this remark, and succeeding remarks,\r\nconcerning departure of young from nests pertains to young that were\r\ndisturbed daily by me. The others climbed to the edge of the nest when\r\nthey were left alone, but remained in the nest when they were all\r\nreplaced. Gaping was recorded once on the ninth day. Stuart W. John\r\nwatched two Sharp-tailed Sparrows on my study area leave a nest. They\r\nclimbed out and immediately hid in a tussock of grass a few inches\r\nbehind the nest.\r\n\r\nOn the tenth day when I parted the branches over one Seaside Sparrow\r\nnest, the four young jumped from the nest and scattered in the grass.\r\nOne of these birds gave a chipping note similar to the distress call of\r\nadults. No bird remained in a nest longer than ten days. Four young\r\nleft the nest after nine days, seven young left on the tenth day. When\r\nthe young leave the nest they are able to run rapidly through the dense\r\ngrass. The young are fed by the parents for approximately 20 days after\r\nthey leave the nest. Twenty-three days after one young Seaside Sparrow\r\nleft the nest it was netted at the opposite end of the island, 300\r\nyards from the territory of its parents.\r\n\r\nYoung Seaside Sparrows fly in an uncertain but characteristic manner\r\nwhen they are flushed from the grass. They dive clumsily into the grass\r\nafter a short flight, making it easy to identify them as birds of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe plumage of sparrows of the Genus _Ammospiza_ serves to conceal them\r\nin their habitat. In juvenal and adult plumage, the Sharp-tailed\r\nSparrow is a brown-backed, streaked bird, the color and pattern\r\nblending with the matted grasses (Allen, 1925:67) where the species\r\nfeeds and nests. The Seaside Sparrow, as an adult, is olive-gray. Its\r\ncolor corresponds to that of the substratum where the species forages.\r\nThe juvenal plumage of the Seaside Sparrow resembles that of the\r\nSharp-tailed Sparrow. I believe that young Seaside Sparrows have this\r\nbrown, streaked plumage because they spend most of their time in the\r\ndense grass. In the Seaside Sparrow a complete post-juvenal molt begins\r\nin late August. The resulting plumage resembles that which is acquired\r\nby the adults when they complete their post-nuptial molt (Dwight,\r\n1900:192-193).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOD, FEEDING, AND CARE OF THE YOUNG\r\n\r\nThe food habits of Seaside Sparrows and Sharp-tailed Sparrows have been\r\nstudied by Judd (1901:64-66), who concluded that both species are\r\nhighly insectivorous. In 51 stomachs of Sharp-tailed Sparrows 81 per\r\ncent of the contents was animal. The results of investigation of\r\nstomachs of Seaside Sparrows were similar. In each of the two species\r\nthe bill is more elongated and less conical than in other sparrows. For\r\nthe two species studied, the shape of the bill seems to be an\r\nadaptation for feeding on insects.\r\n\r\nWhen searching for food, Sharp-tailed Sparrows walk through the dense\r\nblack grass, deftly brushing stems aside with their bill as they go.\r\nOpen areas are generally traversed by rapid running. I never noticed\r\neither species hopping. They stop to investigate openings in the matted\r\nunderstory of grass, often sticking their heads into the holes. Many\r\ntimes I saw these sparrows stretch or jump to pick insects from stems.\r\nMany droppings, almost certainly those of Sharp-tailed Sparrows, were\r\npresent in areas of damp, matted grass. Females, when feeding young,\r\nobtain most of the food near the nest; several times I saw birds catch\r\ninsects when they were within inches of their nest. Sharp-tailed\r\nSparrows feed also along the banks of pools and creeks, and along the\r\nperimeters of marshes. Sharp-tailed Sparrows seem to be less restricted\r\nin the types of feeding habitats they can use than are Seaside\r\nSparrows.\r\n\r\nSeaside Sparrows always returned to the edge of the marsh to procure\r\nfood, according to my observations. The birds at Lavallette fed\r\nextensively on noctuid moths. In the feeding territories of two pairs\r\nof Seaside Sparrows, along the strip of washed-up eel grass, I found at\r\nleast 40 wings of these moths. In several instances the four wings of\r\none moth were lying close together in the same relative position in\r\nwhich they had been on the animal. Legs and pieces of thorax were also\r\ndiscarded occasionally. I watched adults take these moths from the\r\nstems of the smooth cord-grass and snip the wings off with their bills.\r\nMoth wings were present in the other feeding territories, but not in so\r\ngreat a quantity. Once I saw a female return to the nest with a spider\r\nin her bill. Spiders were abundant throughout the marsh.\r\n\r\nDwight (1900:193) was surprised that the two species living in the same\r\nenvironment, and therefore suffering equally from abrasion from the\r\ncoarse marsh grasses, should have a different number of molts per year.\r\nThe Sharp-tailed Sparrow has a complete pre-nuptial, as well as a\r\ncomplete postnuptial, molt. The Seaside Sparrow has only a postnuptial\r\nmolt, the nuptial plumage being acquired by wear. My observations of\r\nthe feeding habits of the two species indicate that they do not live in\r\nprecisely the same environment. The Sharp-tailed Sparrow, which has two\r\ncomplete molts annually, generally forages in dense, abrasive\r\nvegetation. The Seaside Sparrow, which has but one molt each year,\r\nforages in relatively open areas.\r\n\r\nSeveral times I saw adult Seaside Sparrows fly from their nests toward\r\nthe feeding territories with fecal sacs in their bills. On the feeding\r\ngrounds, I found several of these sacs discarded near the moth wings. I\r\nsaw also female Sharp-tailed Sparrows leave their nests with fecal\r\nsacs. I did not see sparrows of either species swallow fecal sacs.\r\n\r\nOne nest, that of a Seaside Sparrow containing four young, became\r\nfouled with excrement when the young were nine to ten days old. It is\r\ninteresting that these young were cared for only by a male, at least\r\nfor the last four days of nest life, and that one of the young birds\r\ndied two days before the others left the nest. This male's mate was\r\nprobably a female that I banded on June 18 (the young left the nest on\r\nJune 23) and never saw again. A female, whose mate was probably killed\r\nby me on June 15, continued to incubate the three eggs until they\r\nhatched on June 29, but deserted the nest when the young were two days\r\nold. This female was seen again on August 1 more than 500 yards from\r\nher nest site on the island immediately north of the study area.\r\n\r\nDevotion of parent passerine birds to the young typically increases\r\nwith the growth of the young (Nice, 1943:245). This may explain why the\r\nmateless female deserted its nest when the young were only two days\r\nold, whereas a mateless male continued to care for his six-day-old\r\nyoung. The death of one nestling, and the eventual fouling of his nest\r\nmay indicate that the job was too much for one adult to perform. The\r\ncorrelation of increasing devotion of the parents with increasing age\r\nof the young was further illustrated by the distraction display, noted\r\nby me, on the part of a pair of Seaside Sparrows on the day their young\r\nleft the nest. As I lifted the four nine-day-old young from the nest\r\nfor weighing, they began to give the distress call. This attracted the\r\nparents from the feeding area approximately 60 yards away. The two\r\nadults ran around on the ground within ten feet of me giving the\r\n_tsip_ note and fluttering their wings. Several times the adults\r\nflew within a few feet of me, making a vibrating sound with their\r\nwings. Although I realized the function of this display, it was\r\ndistracting nevertheless.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n\r\n    I am indebted to Assistant Professor Harrison B.

The male Seaside\r\nSparrow defends its territory by chasing and singing. The male\r\nSharp-tailed Sparrow confines itself to a breeding home range. This\r\nrange is not a territory; it is inhabited by several males. Female\r\nSharp-tailed Sparrows may be territorial; this is not certainly known.\r\n\r\nThe Seaside Sparrow sings louder, more distinctly, more often, and from\r\nmore exposed perches than does the Sharp-tailed Sparrow. These\r\ncharacteristics seem to be correlated with territorial habits. Other\r\ncalls are described and their functions are discussed.\r\n\r\nThe Seaside Sparrow nests in marsh-elder bushes, or in areas of mixed\r\nvegetation. The Sharp-tailed Sparrow prefers the inner, drier areas of\r\na marsh, where black grass is dominant. The Seaside Sparrow places its\r\nnest farther above the ground than does the Sharp-tailed Sparrow. Both\r\nspecies used only black grass in constructing the nest.\r\n\r\nCopulation is described. The incubation period was not determined for\r\neither species. Three or four eggs seem to be a normal clutch. Females\r\ndo all of the incubating.\r\n\r\nThe young remained in the nests nine to ten days. These nests, of\r\ncourse were disturbed, for I visited them at least daily. The nestlings\r\nof the Seaside Sparrow are fed by both parents. Male Sharp-tailed\r\nSparrows seem not to know the location of the nests and take no part in\r\nrearing the young at least up to time of fledging. The natal down of\r\nboth species is described. Data on growth and behavior of the young are\r\npresented.\r\n\r\nSeaside Sparrows obtained most of their food from the shoreline of the\r\nmarsh, in areas of open mud and smooth cord-grass. The plumage of the\r\nadult matches, in color, this mud. The Sharp-tailed Sparrow feeds\r\neverywhere in the marsh, but mostly in areas of dense and matted black\r\ngrass. The plumage on the dorsum of this species is brown and streaked\r\nresembling the dead grass. Juvenal Seaside Sparrows, which spend most\r\nof their time concealed in the dense grass, resemble adult and juvenal\r\nSharp-tailed Sparrows in plumage. Sharp-tailed Sparrows molt completely\r\ntwice per year. The Seaside Sparrow molts but once per year. The\r\ndifference in number of molts, too, is correlated with habitat\r\npreference, since the grassy forage habitat of the Sharp-tailed Sparrow\r\nmust result in greater abrasion of the plumage than does the open\r\nfeeding habitat of the Seaside Sparrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE CITED\r\n\r\nALLEN, GLOVER M.\r\n\r\n1925.
