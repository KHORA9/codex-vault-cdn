NELSON AND SONS, PATERNOSTER ROW;\r\n\r\nEDINBURGH; AND NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n1875.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Insect\" is one of the four remarkable works in which the late\r\nM. Michelet embodied the results of a loving and persevering study\r\nof Nature. These works are absolutely unique; the poetry of Science\r\nwas never before illustrated on so large a scale, or with so much\r\nvividness of fancy, or in so eloquent a style. The aspects of Nature\r\nwere never before examined with so strong an enthusiasm or so definite\r\nan individuality,--with so eager a desire to identify them with the\r\nfeelings, hopes, and aspirations of humanity. Michelet approached his\r\nsubject neither as philosopher nor as poet, but yet with something\r\nof the spirit of both. His philosophy and poetry, however, were both\r\nsubordinate to his ardent sympathy with what he conceived to be the\r\nsoul, the personality of Nature; and whether his attention was directed\r\nto the life of ocean, the bird, the insect, or the mountain-plant, he\r\nstill sought for some evidence of its special and distinct existence,\r\nwith thoughts and emotions, as it were, and a character of its own. It\r\nwas almost as if he saw in Nature a likeness to, and a kinship with,\r\nhumanity. No doubt, in expressing these views he was occasionally led\r\ninto a certain extravagance, and his enthusiasm not infrequently outran\r\nor overmastered his judgment. He lacked the profound insight and sober\r\nreflection of Wordsworth, and accuracy of detail was often sacrificed\r\nfor the sake of a brilliant generalization. But, after making due\r\nallowance for defects inseparable, perhaps, from a genius rather\r\npassionate and impulsive than analytic and self-composed, it must be\r\nadmitted that the lover of Nature has cause to be grateful for the fine\r\nfancies, rich illustrations, and suggestive analogies crowded into the\r\nbooks we speak of.\r\n\r\nA recent writer, M. Monod,[A] has pronounced upon them an animated\r\neulogium:--\"Scientific men may discover in these books errors,\r\ninaccuracies, and exaggerations; but, in spite of all, they have shown\r\nthat the physical sciences, though accused of withering the soul, and\r\nrobbing Nature of poetry and life of enchantment, contain the elements\r\nof a profound and varied poetry, that never loses its charm, because\r\nit is not dependent on the caprices of taste and fashion, but has its\r\nsource in the unchangeable reality of things. Many have said that\r\nscience will drive out religion and poetry; Michelet finds in every\r\nbranch of science the demonstration of a new faith, revealing to him\r\na harmony till then unperceived, centred in the supreme unity of the\r\nDivine mind and of the Absolute Being.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: _Macmillan's Magazine_, July 1874, pp. 231, 232.]\r\n\r\nWhether the reader endorses this high eulogium or not, he will\r\ncertainly, in \"The Insect,\" as in \"The Bird,\" find a new stimulus to\r\nthe study of Nature, and a fresh proof of the power and fancy of one of\r\nthe greatest of modern French writers.\r\n\r\nOf the present translation, it is necessary only to say that it has\r\nbeen executed with a conscientious adherence to the original, and with\r\nan effort to preserve, as far as possible, its peculiarities of style.\r\nIf it should be thought that in the attempt something of freedom and\r\nfluency has been sacrificed, it is hoped the critic will acknowledge\r\nthat something of faithfulness has been gained. The author of \"The\r\nInsect\" took much interest in the presentation of it and its companions\r\nto the English reader in an English dress, and was pleased to express\r\nhis approval of the manner in which the Translator had accomplished his\r\ntask.\r\n\r\nIt remains to be added that the exquisite Illustrations, by M. H.\r\nGiacomelli, have all been specially drawn and engraved for the English\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nW. H.

MOUNTAINS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nTHE LIVING INFINITE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have followed the Bird in all its liberties of flight, and space,\r\nand light; but the Earth which we quitted would not quit us. The sweet\r\nmelodies of the winged world could not prevent us from hearing the\r\nmurmur of an infinite world of shadow and silence, which, wanting the\r\nspeech of man, expresses itself, nevertheless, with eloquent force, by\r\nmeans of a myriad mute tongues.\r\n\r\nA universal appeal made to us simultaneously by all Nature, from the\r\ndepths of Earth and Sea, from the bosom of every plant, from the very\r\nair which we breathe.\r\n\r\nThe eloquent appeal of the ingenious arts of the Insect, of its powers\r\nof love so vividly manifested through its wings and colours, in the\r\nbrilliant scintillation with which it enkindles our nights.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAn appeal which becomes frightful from the number of those who make it.\r\nWhat is the little tribe of Birds, or that of Quadrupeds, compared with\r\nthem? All the animal species, all the various forms of life, brought\r\nface to face with this one family, disappear, and are as nothing. Put\r\nthe world on one side, and on the other the Insect World; the latter\r\nhas the advantage.\r\n\r\nOur collections contain about one hundred thousand species. But taking\r\ninto consideration that every plant at the least nourishes three,\r\nwe obtain the result, according to the number of known plants, of\r\nthree hundred and sixty thousand species of insects! And each, be it\r\nremembered, of prodigious fecundity.\r\n\r\nNow call to mind that every creature nourishes other creatures on its\r\nsurface, in the thickness of its solids, in its fluids, and in its\r\nblood; that each insect is a little world inhabited by insects; and\r\nthat these again have parasites of their own.\r\n\r\nIs this all? No; in the masses men have supposed to be mineral or\r\ninorganic, animals are now revealed to us of which it would take a\r\nthousand millions to form one inch in thickness,--the which do not\r\nthe less present us with a rough sketch or outline of the Insect, and\r\nhave a right to be spoken of as _insects commenced_. And what are the\r\nnumbers of these? A single species accumulates the Apennines out of its\r\n_débris_, and with its atoms has raised up that enormous backbone of\r\nAmerica, the Cordilleras.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at this point, we think our review is ended. Patience!\r\nThe molluscs, which in the Southern Seas have created so many\r\nislands,--which literally pave, as recent soundings have shown, the\r\ntwelve hundred leagues of Ocean separating us from America,--these\r\nmolluscs are qualified by many naturalists with the name of _embryo\r\ninsects_; so that their fertile tribes form, as it were, a dependency\r\nof the higher race,--candidates, one might say, for the rank of Insect.\r\n\r\nThis is sublime. The reason that, nevertheless, makes me regret the\r\nlittle world of Birds,--those charming companions which bore me aloft\r\non their wings not long ago,--is not their harmonious concerts, is not\r\neven the spectacle of their airy and sublime life--but because they\r\nunderstood me!\r\n\r\nWe comprehended and we loved one another; we interchanged our\r\nlanguages. I spoke for the Bird, and the Bird sang for me.\r\n\r\nHaving fallen from heaven at the threshold of the sombre kingdom, and\r\nin the presence of the mute and mysterious sons of night, what language\r\nam I to invent, and what signs of intelligence? How am I to exercise\r\nmy wits to discover a mode of communicating with them? My voice and\r\ngestures do but drive them away. There is no glance of recognition in\r\ntheir eyes; no emotion visible on their inscrutable mask. Under its\r\nwarrior-cuirass the Insect remains impenetrable. Does its heart--for\r\nit has one--beat after the fashion of mine? Its senses are infinitely\r\nsubtle, but do they resemble _my_ senses? It seems as if they still\r\nremained apart, unknown, ay, and without a name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt escapes us; Nature has created for it, with respect to man, a\r\nperpetual _alibi_. If she reveals it to us for a moment in a single\r\ngleam of love, she hides it for years in the depths of the shadowy\r\nearth or in the discreet bosom of the oaks. And even when discovered,\r\ncaptured, opened, dissected, and examined by a microscope in every\r\ndetail, it still remains to us an enigma.\r\n\r\nAnd an enigma of by no means reassuring character,--whose singularity\r\nalmost scandalizes, while it so confuses our ideas. What shall we say\r\nof a being which breathes through its side and flanks? of a paradoxical\r\nwalker, which, contrary to all other organisms, presents its back to\r\nthe earth and its belly to the sky? In many respects, we may look upon\r\nthe insect as a creature of contradictions.\r\n\r\nAdd, moreover, that its littleness contributes to the misunderstanding.\r\nEvery organ appears to us fantastic and threatening, because our weak\r\neyes do not see it with sufficient clearness to be able to explain its\r\nstructure and utility. What is imperfectly seen always perplexes; and\r\ntherefore provisionally, we kill it! And it is so little, too, that we\r\ndo not trouble ourselves to be just towards it.\r\n\r\nWe are in no want of systems. We could willingly accept the definitive\r\ndecree of a German dreamer, who sums up the whole matter in a word:\r\n\"The good God made the world; but the devil made the insect!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Insect, nevertheless, does not look upon itself as vanquished. To\r\nthe systems of the philosopher and the terror of the child (which are,\r\nperhaps, both the same thing), this is its answer:--\r\n\r\nIn the first place, that Justice is universal, that size has nothing to\r\ndo with Right; that if one could suppose the Right to be unequal in its\r\napplication, and the Universal Love to incline the balance, it would be\r\non the side of the little.\r\n\r\nIt says that it would be absurd to judge by the figure, to condemn\r\norgans of whose uses we are ignorant, which are principally the tools\r\nof special professions, the instruments of a hundred trades; that it,\r\nthe insect, is the great destroyer and fabricator, the most industrious\r\nof artisans, the energetic workman of life.\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, it says (this pretension will perhaps appear most\r\narrogant), that if we judge by visible signs, by works and results,\r\nit is It, among all beings, which loves most truly. Love endows it\r\nwith wings, with a marvellous iris of colours, and even with visible\r\nflames. Love is for _it_ the instantaneous or approaching death, with\r\nan astonishing _second sight_ of maternity which continues over the\r\norphan an ingenious superintendence. And lastly, the maternal genius\r\nextends so far, that, surpassing and eclipsing the rare associations of\r\nbirds and quadrupeds, it has enabled the Insect to create republics and\r\nestablish cities!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nI admit that this weighty plea has made an impression on me.\r\n\r\nIf thou toilest and lovest, O Insect, whatever may be thy aspect, I\r\ncannot separate myself from thee. We are truly somewhat akin. For what\r\nam I myself, but a worker? What has been my greatest happiness in this\r\nworld?\r\n\r\nOur communion of action and destiny will open my heart, and give me\r\na new sense with which to understand thy silence. Love--the divine\r\nforce which circulates in all things, like an universal soul--is the\r\ninterpreter through whose agency our insects discourse and understand\r\neach other without speech.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nOUR STUDIES AT PARIS AND IN SWITZERLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the prolonged perusal of naturalists and travellers by which we\r\nprepared ourselves for writing \"The Bird,\" and for which nothing less\r\nwas required than the patience of a solitary woman, we gathered on\r\nthe way a number of facts and details which presented the Insect to\r\nour eyes under the most varied aspects. The Insect appeared to us\r\nincessantly in company with the Bird,--here like a harmony, there as an\r\nantagonism,--but too often in profile, and as a subordinate being.\r\n\r\nI was in the middle of the sixteenth century, and while engaged for\r\nabout three years in historical studies, my knowledge on this point was\r\ncollected only by means of extracts, readings, and conversations every\r\nevening. The various elements of this grand study I acquired through\r\nthe medium of a soul eminently gentle towards the things of nature, and\r\ngenerously given to love the weak; whose loyal and patient affection,\r\nindefinitely extending curiosity, picked up, so to speak, like the\r\nant, and as so many grains of sand, the materials which we found less\r\nfrequently in the more important works than in an infinity of memoirs\r\nand scattered dissertations.\r\n\r\nTo live long, steadfastly, for ever,--this it is which renders weak\r\nspirits strong. Such a perseverance of taste and affection is not\r\nless necessary when one wishes to put aside one's books, and enter\r\nupon a course of observation, of long and delicate studies of life. I\r\nam not surprised that Mademoiselle Jurine contributed so largely to\r\nher father's astonishing discoveries respecting bees, nor that Madame\r\nMérian, as the fruit of her far-off wanderings, has bequeathed to us\r\nher wise and beautiful book of drawings of the Insects of Guiana. The\r\neyes and hands of women, so delicate and well adapted for dealing with\r\ntiny objects, are eminently appropriate for such pursuits as these.\r\nThey have also a greater respect for, attention to, and condescension\r\ntowards trifling existences, than man exhibits. Though poetical, they\r\nare less poets, and impose less upon the Real the tyranny of their\r\nthought. They are more docile towards it, do not dominate over it,\r\nsubmit themselves to it, and do not bestow on these little beings\r\nthe rapid and often disdainful glance of the higher life. And when,\r\nwith all this, they are patient also, they may well become excellent\r\nobservers, and miniature Réaumurs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFeminine qualities are specially needful in microscopical studies. To\r\nsucceed in these, one must become somewhat of a woman. The microscope\r\nis amusing at a first hasty glance; but if one would make a serious\r\nuse of it, it demands a certain amount of dexterity, patient tact, and\r\nespecially leisure,--considerable leisure,--full liberty of time,--in\r\norder that one may indefinitely repeat the same observations, and\r\nexamine the same object on different days, in the pure light of\r\nmorning, in the warm ray of noon, and occasionally even at a later\r\nhour. For certain objects which we must regard as a whole are best\r\nseen through a single lens; others only through a transparency, by\r\nilluminating them beneath the mirror of the microscope. Others,\r\ninsignificant or commonplace by day, grow marvellous in the evening,\r\nwhen the focus of the instrument concentrates the light. To conclude:\r\ntheir study demands--what in the present age one least possesses--an\r\nisolation from the world, a point beyond time; the support of a\r\nblameless curiosity, and of a constant and reverent love of these\r\nimperceptible existences. Theirs is a kind of virginal and solitary\r\nmaternity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI was not released from my absorption in that terrible sixteenth\r\ncentury until the spring of 1856. \"The Bird\" had also made its\r\nappearance. I sought an interval of rest, and established myself at\r\nMontreux, near Clarens, on the Lake of Geneva. But this most delightful\r\nlocality, awakening in me a keen perception of Nature, did not restore\r\nmy tranquillity. I was still too much affected by the bloody story\r\nI had been narrating. A flame burned within me which nothing could\r\nextinguish. I rambled along the roads, with my cup of fir-wood, tasting\r\nthe water at every fountain--all so fresh and so pure!--and demanding\r\nof them if any possessed the property of effacing the bitternesses of\r\nthe Past and Present, and which, out of so many springs, might prove to\r\nme a Lethe.\r\n\r\nAt length I found, at about half a league from Lucerne, an old convent\r\ntransformed into a hostelry, where I selected for my study the parlour,\r\na very spacious apartment, which, through its seven windows opening on\r\nthe mountains, the lake, and the town--a threefold prospect--afforded\r\nme a magnificent light at all hours. From morning to evening the sun\r\nremained faithful to me, and revolved around my microscope, set in\r\nthe middle of the chamber. The beautiful lake, shining in front and\r\non every side, is not that which afterwards, when hemmed in by the\r\nheights, and furious and violent, will be called the Lake of Uri. But\r\nthe firs which everywhere overhang the landscape warn you not to place\r\ntoo much reliance on the season,--inform you that you are residing\r\nin a cold country. In numerous things, moreover, you find a certain\r\nbarbarous savagery prevailing. It is from the very south the breath\r\nof winter blows. In front of me, and my constant companion, arose, on\r\nthe farther shore, the gloomy Pilatus, a barren mountain with keen\r\nrazor-like edges; and over its black shoulder gleamed, at ten leagues\r\ndistant, the snow-white _Virgin_ and the _Silver Peak_ (the Jungfrau\r\nand the Silberhorn).\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe country is very beautiful and very fresh in July, but frequently,\r\nin September, is already cold. You perceive above and behind you, at\r\nan enormous elevation, an ocean of water suspended. This is the main\r\nreservoir whence issue the great European reservoirs; the mass of St.\r\nGothard, a table-land measuring ten leagues in every direction, which\r\nfrom one extremity pours out the Rhine, from another the Rhone, from\r\na third the Reuss, and towards the south the Ticino. You do not _see_\r\nthis reservoir--except a little of its outline--but you _feel_ it. Do\r\nyou wish for water? Come hither. Drink; it is the grandest cup which\r\nquenches the thirst of humanity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI began to feel less athirst. In the middle of summer the nights were\r\ncold, the mornings and evenings fresh. Those spotless snows, which I\r\ngazed at so eagerly and with insatiable eyes, purified me, it seemed,\r\nfrom the long, dusty, sun-burned, blood-besprinkled, and sublime, but\r\nalso sometimes miry, revolutions of history. I recovered a little my\r\nequilibrium between the drama of the world and the eternal epopea.\r\n\r\nWhat can be more divine than these Alps? Elsewhere I have called\r\nthem \"the common altar of Europe.\" And wherefore? Not on account of\r\ntheir height,--a little higher, or a little lower, one is no nearer\r\nheaven,--but because the grand harmony, elsewhere vague, is palpable\r\nhere. The solidarity of life, the circulation of nature, the beneficent\r\nconcord of the elements,--all is visible. It kindles a glorious\r\nillumination.\r\n\r\nEach chain filters from its glacier, as a revelation of the\r\ninaccessible zone, a torrent which, concentrated, tranquillized\r\nand purified in an ample lake,--translated into pure and azure\r\nwater,--emerges as a great river, and diffuses everywhere the soul of\r\nthe Alps. From these innumerable waters reascend to the mountains the\r\nmists which renew the treasure of their glaciers.\r\n\r\nAll is in such perfect sympathy, and the perspectives are so noble,\r\nthat the lakes and their rivers still reflect or survey, as they wander\r\nafar, the grave assemblage of the mountains, the upper snows, the\r\nsublime virgin peaks of which they are an emanation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThey face, they explain one another, harmonize with and love one\r\nanother. But in what austerity! In their mutual love we recognize an\r\nidentity of the strongest contrasts,--fixity and fluidity, rapidity and\r\neternity, the snows above the verdure, forebodings of winter in summer.\r\n\r\nHence results a prudent nature, a general sagacity in the things\r\nthemselves. One enjoys without forgetting that one's enjoyment will not\r\nbe of long duration. But the heart is not the less moved by a world of\r\nsuch seriousness and purity. This brevity attracts, and this austerity\r\ntakes one captive. From the gleaming snows to the lakes, from the woods\r\nto the rivers and to the fresh emerald meads, a sovereign virginity\r\npredominates over the whole country.\r\n\r\nSuch localities are for all the seasons of life. Old age grows\r\nstrengthened by its association with nature, and greets without\r\nmelancholy the grand shadows falling from the mountains. And hearts\r\nstill young, which feel only the morning and the dawn, expand to the\r\ncharming joys of religious tenderness,--tenderness for the Soul of the\r\nworld, tenderness for its smallest infants.\r\n\r\nThe favourite place for our walks, and our usual studio, was a small\r\ngrove of firs situated at a tolerable elevation above the lake, in the\r\nrear of the rock of Seeberg. We ascended thither by two routes doubly\r\nilluminated by the mighty radiance of the splendid mirror in which the\r\nfour cantons are reflected. No landscape can be more gentle, if we look\r\ntowards Lucerne; none more serious or solemn, in the direction of St.\r\nGothard and the amphitheatre of mountains. But all this grandeur and\r\nbrightness terminated suddenly at the first step we took beneath our\r\nfirs. It was as if one had reached the end of the world. The light\r\nlessened; sounds seemed subdued; life itself appeared absent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSuch, at the first glance, is the customary effect of the woods. But at\r\nthe second all is changed. The suffocation, or at least subordination,\r\nimposed by the fir upon all those plants which would fain grow in\r\nits shade, lets light into the depths; and when the eyes have become\r\naccustomed to this kind of gloaming, we see considerably further, and\r\ndistinguish much more clearly, than in the inextricable labyrinth of\r\nordinary forests where everything acts as an obstruction.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle first presented to us under the noble funereal\r\npillars--the pillars, may we not say? of a stately temple--was a\r\nspectacle of death; not of a saddening death, but of a death rich,\r\nadorned, and graceful, such as Nature frequently vouchsafes to plants.\r\nAt every step the old trunks of trees, felled but not uprooted, were\r\nclothed in an incomparable velvety green,--a tissue superbly woven\r\nof fine mosses soft to the touch, which delighted the eye by their\r\nchanging aspects, their reflexes, and their shifting gleams.\r\n\r\nBut where was the animal life of the forest? Our ears soon grew\r\naccustomed to recognize and divine its presence. I do not refer to the\r\nwhistle of the tomtits, or the strange laughter of the woodpecker, the\r\nevident lord of the place. I am thinking of a different people, against\r\nwhom the birds wage war.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA great hum and murmur, sufficiently loud to drown the noise of a\r\nbrook, warned us that the forest was haunted by wasps. Already we had\r\ndiscovered their fort, whence more than one endeavoured to lead us\r\nastray, suspecting our steps, and obviously ill-disposed towards us.\r\n\r\nIn the very localities least frequented by the wasps, light, hoarse,\r\ninternal rustlings seemed to issue from the trees. Were these the\r\nvoices of their genii, their Dryads? No, indeed; but of their\r\nmysterious enemies, the mighty populace of the shadows, which,\r\nfollowing up the veins of the trunk and penetrating its entire\r\nextent, work out for themselves, with patient teeth, innumerable\r\nways and channels and galleries. Sometimes nearly a hundred thousand\r\n_scolyti_[B] (for such is their name) are found in a single tree. The\r\nsickly fir is at length reduced by their teeth to the condition of a\r\npiece of delicate lace-work. Yet the bark remains intact, and deludes\r\nus with the phantom of life.\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: A genus of _Coleoptera_.]\r\n\r\nHow does the tree defend itself? Sometimes by its sap, which,\r\nwhile preserving its strength, asphyxiates the enemy; but more\r\nfrequently it is assisted by a friend, a physician, from without--the\r\nwoodpecker--which carefully auscultates it, taps and strikes it with\r\nits strong hammer, and with persevering ardour watches for and pursues\r\nthe nibbling colony.\r\n\r\nIs this internal combat between the two lives, the animal and the\r\nvegetable, really understood? Of this I cannot be sure, and there are\r\ntimes when I think myself deceived.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn that silence which was not silence, a something--I know not\r\nwhat--assured us that the dead forest was in truth alive, and on the\r\npoint of breaking forth into speech. We entered it full of hope, and\r\nbelieving that we should discover some secret. We felt certain that to\r\nour inquiring spirit a great manifold Spirit was about to reply. Though\r\nfatigued by the walk, and in an infirm state of health, I felt great\r\npleasure in the search I had undertaken in these pallid glooms. I loved\r\nto see before me a person deeply moved, and enthusiastically smitten by\r\ntheir great mysteries. Stick in hand, she advanced into this fantastic\r\ntwilight, interrogating the sombre forest, and seeking, as it were, the\r\nVirgilian \"golden bough.\"\r\n\r\nI was about to quit the scene, and seat myself in a sunny opening,\r\nwhen at length a more successful sounding in one of the ancient trunks\r\nbrought to light a world whose existence no one would have suspected.\r\n\r\nAt the summit of this trunk, cut off within a foot of the ground, you\r\ncould very easily distinguish the works wrought by the _scolyti_ and\r\nweevils, the former inhabitants of the tree, in conformity to the\r\nconcentric arrangement of the sap. But all this belonged to ancient\r\nhistory; a different condition of things now existed. These miserable\r\n_scolyti_ had perished, having undergone, like their tree, the\r\nenergetic action of a great chemical transformation which excluded all\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAll life, except one, and that the keenest--a consuming and burned-up\r\nlife, it seems--the life of those beings powerful under an infinitely\r\nlittle form, in which one might have readily concluded that a black\r\nflame, shining fitfully, had consumed all that was material, and\r\nreserved only what was spiritual.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe _coup de théâtre_ was violent, and the immense swarming had its\r\neffect. A vivid and unwonted joy agitated the much-moved hand that had\r\nmade the happy discovery; and in proportion to the full revelation of\r\nits greatness, a wild vertigo passed from the distracted people to\r\nthe author of this great ruin. The walls of the city fell down, and\r\nrevealed the interior of the edifice; innumerable halls and galleries\r\nwere laid bare; generally four to five inches in length, and about\r\nhalf an inch in height,--a height certainly quite sufficient, and\r\neven majestic, if we take into account the size of the members of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nA true palace, or rather a vast and superb city; limited in breadth,\r\nbut to what depth may it not penetrate the earth? It is said that some\r\nhave been found which, perseveringly excavated, have numbered no fewer\r\nthan seven hundred stories. Thebes and Nineveh were insignificant!\r\nBabylon and Babel alone might have sustained, in their audaciously\r\ntowering piles, a comparison with these shadowy Babels which\r\ncontinually expanded in the abyss.\r\n\r\nBut more astonishing than the grandeur is the interior aspect of\r\nthese habitations: without, all damp, and mossy, and overgrown with\r\ntiny cryptogams; within, an astonishing dryness, and an admirable\r\ncleanliness--every partition firm though soft, just as if it had been\r\ntapestried with cotton velvet, very heavy and lustreless. Is this\r\nblack velvet produced from the wood itself, after undergoing powerful\r\nmodification, or by an extremely delicate layer of microscopic fungi\r\nwhich may have been established in the tree while it was still moist,\r\nand before it received its all-powerful necromancers? The agent of the\r\ntransformation betrayed itself directly: each separate cell, if closely\r\nsmelt, betrayed the pungent odour of formic acid, by means of which the\r\nbusy race had effected the metamorphosis of its abode, had burned it\r\nand purified it with its flame, had dried it and rendered it wholesome\r\nwith its useful poison.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is this acid also which, undoubtedly, had accelerated and assisted\r\nthe enormous and colossal labour, had opened the way to the tiny\r\nefforts of those indefatigable sculptors whose chisels are their teeth.\r\nYet even in this case there can be no question but that it must have\r\noccupied a considerable time. Successive generations had very probably\r\npassed their lives in the tree, working always on the same plan and in\r\nthe same direction. The image of the projected and longed-for city--the\r\nhope of creating a secure fortress, a noble and massive acropolis--had\r\nfor long years sustained the hearts of the courageous citizens. Ah,\r\nwhat would life be worth if one laboured only for one's-self! Let us\r\nlook forward to the future. The first-comers who spent their lives\r\nin the tree, and from their internal reservoir drew and exhausted the\r\njuices that excavated it, could have enjoyed but for a very brief time\r\na habitation so melancholy, and so steeped, as yet, in pestiferous\r\ndamps and protracted rains; but they thought of future generations, and\r\nreverenced posterity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAlas, I am much afraid that the sanguine dream is ended! It is not\r\nthat a child's stick, held by a young and womanly hand, has penetrated\r\nto the very bottom of the structure carried so deeply into the earth;\r\nbut that the exterior defences, which protected and closed up the\r\nwhole, and kept off the rains, have been removed and scattered abroad.\r\nAnd lo! the great autumnal floods pouring down from the Rhigi, Mont\r\nPilate, and the St. Gothard, the father of rivers,--floating above\r\nthe forests in heavy mists or descending in torrents,--will swamp for\r\never the internal recesses. And what flame, or what burning life, can\r\nthe inhabitants oppose to these repeated invasions of the waters, to\r\nrebuild their palace and purify it again?\r\n\r\nSeated on a fir, I eyed it steadfastly, and as I gazed I dreamed.\r\nThough accustomed to the fall of empires and republics, its ruins flung\r\nme into an ocean of thought. A wave, and then another wave rose, and\r\nthrobbed in my heart. The verse of Homer hung upon my lips,--\r\n\r\n\"And even Troy shall see its day of doom.\"\r\n\r\nWhat could I do for this ravaged world, this half-ruined city? What for\r\nthis great laborious insect race, which all living tribes pursue, or\r\ndevour, or despise, and which nevertheless reveals to us the strongest\r\nimages of unselfish love, of public devotion, and the social sense\r\nin its keenest energy? One thing: to comprehend it,--to explain it,\r\nif I could,--to pour light upon it, and supply it with a generous\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMy wife and I returned home dreaming, and understanding one another\r\nwithout speaking. What had previously been an amusement, a curiosity,\r\nand a study, thenceforth became a Book.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nOUR STUDIES AT FONTAINEBLEAU.\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel no surprise that our great initiator into the Insect World,\r\nSwammerdam, recoiled in affright when the microscope first afforded him\r\na glimpse of it.\r\n\r\nFor the name of its inhabitants is, the Living Infinite.\r\n\r\nUpwards of two hundred years men have laboured, simplifying in one\r\ndirection, and complicating in another. The excellent treatises written\r\nupon this subject leave, among a multitude of partial illuminations, a\r\ncertain feeling of being dazzled. Such is the impression which their\r\nstudy for some time produced upon us.\r\n\r\nOught I to flatter myself that I can render it clearer than my masters\r\nhave done? By no means. But I discovered, through the incident which\r\ntook place at Lucerne, and others of later date, that our enthusiastic\r\nand sympathetic ignorance could penetrate further, perhaps, into the\r\nmeaning of the insect life than has been the lot of many scientific\r\nclassificators.\r\n\r\nThe thought pursued me during the winter, but I could not verify any\r\nexperiment at Paris; it was only at Fontainebleau that I worked out the\r\ntruly simple formula about to be submitted to the reader, and obtained\r\nsome tranquillity of mind, so far as this subject was concerned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe place admirably favoured the then condition of my soul. All the\r\npainful circumstances of the time, by driving me back upon myself,\r\nincreased my concentration. We constituted for ourselves a perfect\r\nsolitude. Our chamber became for us an entire city. And outside\r\nthere was nothing but a ring of wood, then tolerably small, which we\r\ntraversed on foot.\r\n\r\nThis ring oppressed me a little in the great heats, when the sun shone\r\nreflected on the sandstone. But in these dry hot days the thought\r\ndoes not grow enfeebled. I could follow up and investigate mine with\r\nsequence and perseverance, enjoying--what is rare enough in life--a\r\ngrand harmonious unity of ideas and sentiments, which I was by no means\r\nanxious to vary, but rather to deepen.\r\n\r\nI went forth alone at noonday, and walked some distance into the dull,\r\ndumb, and sandy forest, which was without whisper and without voice.\r\nI carried thither my theme, and trusted to attain its meaning in that\r\ninfinite of sand overlaid by an infinite of leaves. But how much vaster\r\nthat infinite of animated life, the abyss of imperceptible organisms\r\ninto which I was fain to descend!\r\n\r\nAll that Sénancour says of Fontainebleau is true so far as relates\r\nto the vague dreamer who brings with him no prevailing thought.\r\nYes; the landscape \"is generally on a small scale, dull, low, and\r\nsolitary without being wild.\" Animals are seldom met with, except in\r\na few kids whose number is easily counted. Birds are not numerous.\r\nFew or no springs are visible; and the apparent absence of water\r\nhas a specially depressing effect on the Alpine traveller, who still\r\nrecalls the freshness of the innumerable fountains of the Alps, and\r\nstill has before his eyes the radiance of those delightful and sublime\r\nmirrors--their lakes. There, all is clear and luminous in the waters\r\nand the snows. Here, all is obscure. This small angle, sequestered as\r\nit were from the rest of France, is an enigma. It shows you the dead\r\nsandstones without a trace of life; it shows you, particularly to-day,\r\nthe newly-planted pines, which suffer nothing living under their shade.\r\nTo discover what lies concealed beneath this outer mask, you must have\r\nrecourse to the divining-rod, the hazel-wand. Revolve it, and you shall\r\nfind. But what is this divining-rod? A study or a love; any passion\r\nwhich lights up the inner world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe power of this locality does not lie in its historical, any more\r\nthan in its artistic associations.[C]\r\n\r\n[Footnote C: It contains, however, three notable things: one\r\nmagnificent, the Hall of Henry II.; one marvellous, the Little Gallery\r\nof Francis I.; and one sublime, the four colossi, the incomparable\r\nrelics of a lost art, that of sculpture in sandstone.]\r\n\r\nThe chateau distracts one's attention from the forest by its\r\nabundant variety of memories and epochs; but it fails to increase\r\nthe impression. Nature is the true fairy in this strange, sombre,\r\nfantastic, and sterile region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FOREST OF FONTAINEBLEAU.]\r\n\r\nObserve that wherever the forest assumes an aspect of grandeur, either\r\nthrough the extent of its vista or the loftiness of its trees, it\r\nresembles all other forests. The truly magnificent towering beeches\r\nof Bas-Bréau seem to me, in spite of their stately bearing and smooth\r\nshining bark, a thing I have seen elsewhere. The place is original only\r\nwhere it is low, gloomy rock; where it bears evidence of the struggle\r\nof the sandstone, the twisted tree, the perseverance of the elm, or the\r\ncourageous effort of the oak.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMany persons have remained here fascinated and enthralled. Coming only\r\nfor a month, they have lingered until death. To the enchanting scene\r\nthey have addressed the lover's speech to his beloved:--\"Let me live,\r\nlet me die with thee!\"--_Tecum vivere amem, tecum obeam libens._\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that every individual finds here what he most\r\ndelights in: Saint Louis, the Thébaïd of which he dreamed; while Henry\r\nIV., who cared for nothing but pleasure, exclaimed, \"My delicious\r\ndeserts!\" The poor mystical exile, Kosciusko,[D] felt the attraction\r\nof his Lithuanian forests, and here took root. A man of stone, of\r\nflint,--the Breton Maud'huys,--saw here the image of his native\r\nBrittany, and built up, stone upon stone, the most original book\r\nwritten upon Fontainebleau.\r\n\r\n[Footnote D: The Polish hero who unavailingly struggled to secure his\r\ncountry's freedom, but was crushed by the power of Russia:--\r\n\r\n\"And Freedom shrieked when Kosciusko fell!\"]\r\n\r\nIt is a region of power, which you cannot enter with impunity. Some\r\npersons lose in it their wits, undergo a strange metamorphosis, and\r\nlike Bottom, in Windsor Forest, see themselves adorned with ass's ears.\r\nFor the forest is a _person_: has its lovers and its detractors--some\r\ncurse it, others bless it. A foolish dreamer wrote of it, on a rock\r\nnear Nemours, \"I _will_ possess thee, cruel stepmother!\" And her lover,\r\nthe old soldier Denecourt, who bestowed on her all that he had in the\r\nworld, called her \"My adored!\"[E]\r\n\r\n[Footnote E: It is impossible to be grateful enough for all that M.\r\nDenecourt has done; he has rendered the place accessible by everybody,\r\neven the poorest, who are no longer in need of guides.--Author.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSome one has said to me: \"Is she not the _Viola_ of Shakespeare,\r\nwith her dubious but always charming aspect; now a maiden, and now a\r\ncavalier? Or his young page, Rosalind, after she appears as a laughing\r\ndamsel?\" No: the contrasts are much greater.\r\n\r\nFor the fairy here has countless faces. She has the cold Alpine plants,\r\nand yet she shelters the most delicate flora. Austere in winter and\r\nspring, she terrifies you with the rugged rocks which, in autumn, she\r\nconceals under a crimson mantle of foliage. She has at her disposal,\r\nfor a daily change, the delicate tissue of floating gauze which Lantara\r\nnever fails to spread over it in all his pictures. With her belt of\r\nforest she arrests on every side the light mists, and gaily weaves\r\nthem into veils, and scarfs, and girdles; into all kinds of delicate\r\ndisguises. You would think the heavy masses of sandstone invariable;\r\nyet they change their aspects, their colours--I was going to say their\r\nform--every hour. The little chain, for example, known as the Rock of\r\nAvon, had saluted us in the morning with the breath of the heather,\r\nthe cheeriest ray of the dawn, an enchanting aurora which tinted with\r\nrose hues the sandstone; all nature seemed to smile, and to harmonize\r\nwith the innocent studies of a devout and poetic soul. When we returned\r\nthere in the evening, the capricious fairy had changed everything.\r\nThose pines, which had welcomed us under their airy canopy, had\r\nsuddenly grown wild and fierce, and resounded with strange noises, with\r\nlamentations of sinister augury. Those shrubs, which in the morning\r\nhad graciously invited the white robe to pause beside them and gather\r\ntheir berries or flowers, now seemed to conceal in their copses an\r\nundefinable something of ill omen--robbers, it might be, or sorcerers!\r\nBut greater still the transformation in those rocks, which had\r\ncourteously received us, and bidden us be seated. Is it the evening,\r\nor is it a coming storm, which has changed them? I know not; but there\r\nthey are, metamorphosed into gloomy sphinxes, into elephants prostrate\r\non the earth, into mammoths, and other monsters of the old worlds which\r\nhave ceased to exist. They are now at rest, it is true; but are they\r\nnot about to rise? However this may be, the evening comes on apace; let\r\nus advance. My wife presses close to my arm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDoes not our forest deserve the name of the Shakespearian comedy, \"As\r\nYou Like It\"?\r\n\r\nNo; to deal justly with it, we must own that its entertaining\r\nmetamorphosis, and all its changes to the eye, are absolutely external.\r\nMovable in its leaves and mists, fugitive in its shifting sands, it\r\nhas a firmer foundation than perhaps any other forest, and a power\r\nof fixity which communicates itself to the soul, and invites it to\r\ngrow strong; to search out and seek within its own nature whatever it\r\npossesses of the inscrutable. Do not linger too long over its fantastic\r\naccidents. _Without_ it says, \"As You Like It;\" _within_, \"Ever and for\r\never.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIts beauty is that of the profound, faithful, and tender heart, which\r\ndoes not the less vary its exquisite grace, though it may daily repeat\r\nthe words of Charles d'Orléans:\r\n\r\n\"Who can ever weary of her?\r\n Still her beauty she renews.\"\r\n\r\nThese ideas occurred to me one day as, seated upon Mont Ussy, I\r\nlooked across Fontainebleau. I comprehended how, in this confined\r\nand ordinary region--in this apparent chaos of rocks, and trees, and\r\nsandstone--prevailed a tolerable degree of order, which necessarily\r\nconcealed within it a mystery not obvious at the first glance.\r\n\r\nAs a whole, it is almost a circle of hills and forests, all dry on the\r\nsurface; but the sandstone is very pervious, and the sand filtrates\r\nwith great facility. And the unseen waters, descend in all directions\r\nto a great reservoir which occupies the depths.\r\n\r\nStorms are frequent here, but do not spread very far. We may nearly\r\nalways expect them, for the forest detains and arrests them, preserves\r\nfor itself the wealth of suspended waters, transmitting them to the\r\nlower grounds after they have been sifted through the leaves, the\r\nwoods, and the sands. All this occurs below, without the process ever\r\nbecoming visible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDig, and you shall find.\r\n\r\nThere lies the charm, the vitality of the _genius loci_.\r\n\r\nThe word \"genius\" conveys too great an idea of fixity, and that of\r\n\"fairy\" is more appropriate. Who shall describe the mystery of this\r\nprofound hidden basin? this simple and attractive delusion, which,\r\nwhile promising only dryness, faithfully stores up underneath the\r\ntreasure of its waters?\r\n\r\nAn eminent Italian artist has given expression to it in the paintings\r\nwhich adorn the Hall of Henry II. It is the _Nemorosa_, the Wood-Nymph,\r\nwith hands full of wild-flowers, hiding beneath a rugged rock, but\r\nsubdued and dreamy, and with eyes swimming tearfully.\r\n\r\nIn the course of our labours, and especially on days when fell a fine\r\nsoft rain, we frequently appreciated this sentiment. It prevailed\r\naround us like a concentration of nature. In the deep silence we\r\ncould hear only our beating hearts, the pendulum of the clock, or the\r\noccasional cry of the swallow passing above our heads.\r\n\r\nCalmed, but not lulled asleep, with clearer brain and keener eye than\r\nbefore, we penetrated further into the shadowy world of the atom, to\r\ndiscover its actual nature; the light, and especially the love, which\r\nis the true legitimate sovereign of this lower world; the tongue, the\r\neloquent voice, by which it appeals to the upper world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nOUR STUDIES AT FONTAINEBLEAU.\r\n\r\n(_Continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\nEven in its hours of silence, the forest occasionally finds a voice, a\r\nsound, or a murmur, which recalls to you the remembrance of life.\r\n\r\nSometimes the laborious woodpecker, laboriously toiling at its task of\r\nexcavating the oak, cheers itself with its singular cry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFrequently the heavy hammer of the quarryman, falling and falling on\r\nthe sandstone, resounds in the distance with a hoarse, dull echo.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, if you listen attentively, you catch a significant hum,\r\nand see, at your feet, legions of ants,--countless populations, the\r\ntrue inhabitants of the place, speeding over the withered and falling\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\nSo many images are these of persistent toil, which blend with the\r\nfanciful a serious gravity. Each in his own way digs and digs. And do\r\nthou too pursue thy work, and exhume and stir up thy thought.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is an admirable place to cure you of the great malady of the\r\nday--its shiftiness, its empty agitation. The time does not know its\r\nown disease; men say that they are clogged and cloyed, when they have\r\nscarcely skimmed the surface. They set out with the delusive notion\r\nthat the best of everything is superficial and external, and that it is\r\nsufficient to put their lips to the cup. But the surface is frequently\r\nfroth. Lower down, and within, lies the elixir of life. We must\r\npenetrate deeper, and mingle more intimately with things, willingly and\r\nby habit, so as to discover their harmony, in which lies true happiness\r\nand strength. The real misfortune, the moral misery, is our want of\r\nconcentration.\r\n\r\nI love those spots which confine and limit the field of thought.\r\nHere, in this narrow circle of hill and wood, every change is purely\r\nexternal and wholly optical. With so many points of shelter, the\r\nwinds, necessarily, do not greatly vary. The fixity of the atmosphere\r\nfurnishes us with a moral basis. I am not certain that our ideas would\r\nhere be strongly stimulated; but he who comes with them fully aroused\r\nmay long preserve and cherish them, without any interruption of his\r\ndream; may seize and relish all the outer accidents, as well as the\r\ninner mysteries. The soul may here put forth its roots, and find that\r\nthe true, the exquisite sense of life, is not to skim the surface, but\r\nto study, and probe, and enjoy the depth.\r\n\r\nThis spot admonishes thought. The sandstone, fixed and motionless\r\nbeneath the mobility of the leaves, is eloquent enough in its very\r\nsilence. Since when has it been planted here? Ah, what ages ago, since,\r\ndespite its hardness, the rain has succeeded in excavating it! No other\r\nforce has prevailed against it. Such as it was, even so it is; and thus\r\nit seems to say to the heart, \"Persevere!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nApparently it should be strong enough to exclude all vegetable life.\r\nBut the heroic oaks will not be denied, and, being condemned to live\r\nthere, have succeeded in defiance of every obstacle. With their\r\ntwisted roots, and with their strong talons that have seized upon the\r\nrock, they too, after their fashion, eloquently exclaim, \"Persevere!\"\r\nThe invincible trees, struggling all the more bravely the greater\r\nthe resistance they meet with, have, on the unimpeded side, plunged\r\nso much the more deeply into the bowels of the earth, and drawn\r\nfrom it incalculable forces. One of them, the poor old giant named\r\n_Charlemagne_, worn-out, undermined, thunder-stricken, after so many\r\ncenturies and so many trials, is still so vigorous in its loins, that\r\nin a solitary branch it has all the appearance of carrying a great oak\r\nwith outstretched arms.\r\n\r\nBetween this sandstone and these oaks one may profit largely. Nor is\r\nman, if you find him here at work, a less useful teacher. The valiant\r\nquarrymen whom I encountered battling against the rock with monstrous\r\nhammers which seem never made for the hand of man, I could willingly\r\nbelieve to possess the resistant force of the sandstone and the iron\r\nheart of the oak. And this is undoubtedly true, so far as concerns\r\nthe soul and the will. But the body has less power of endurance. Few\r\nquarrymen live beyond forty years of age; and those first carried off\r\nare invariably the most skilful and ardent at their work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAll the life of the forest centres in the quarrymen and the ants.\r\nFormerly it had the bees also. They were very numerous, and may still\r\nbe met with in the direction of Franchart. But they have greatly\r\ndecreased in numbers since the planting of so many pines and Northern\r\ntrees, which kill everything with their shade, and in many places have\r\nexterminated the heather and the flowers. On the other hand, the yellow\r\nants, which prefer for their materials the prickles and catkins of\r\nthe pines, appear to prosper. No forest, perhaps, is richer in every\r\nspecies of ants.\r\n\r\nThese, then, are the true inhabitants, the true soul of the desert; the\r\nants toiling in the sand, the quarrymen working in the sandstone. Both\r\nare of the same race; the men are ants on the surface, and the ants are\r\nmen below.\r\n\r\nI admired the resemblance in their destiny, in their laborious\r\npatience, in their admirable perseverance. The sandstone is a very\r\nrefractory and rebellious substance, and often splitting badly,\r\nsubjects the poor workmen to severe disappointments. Those especially\r\nwho are forced by a protracted winter to return to the quarry before\r\nthe end of the bad weather, find the hard and yet porous blocks\r\nexcessively damp and half frozen. As a result, they have numerous\r\nill-wrought stones, and a mass of waste. However, they do not lose\r\ntheir courage; and without murmuring recommence their painful toil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe ants teach us a similar lesson of patience. The breeders of birds\r\nand game incessantly damage, overthrow, and carry away the immense\r\nworks which have occupied them for a whole season. Incessantly they\r\nbegin them anew with heroic ardour.\r\n\r\nWe constantly paid them a visit, and learned to sympathize with them\r\nmore and more. Their patient procedures, their active and concentrated\r\nlife, is, in truth, more like that of the artisan than the winged\r\nexistence of the bird which formerly occupied our attention. That free\r\ninheritor of the day, that favourite of Nature, soars so high above\r\nman! To what may I compare my long laborious career? I have, indeed,\r\ncaught glimpses of the sky, and sometimes heard the songs of the birds\r\nabove; but, on the whole, my existence, the indefatigable labour which\r\nchains me to my task, much more nearly resembles the modest communities\r\nof the ant and the bee.\r\n\r\nAt first sight, the labours of their comrades, the quarrymen, are not\r\nvery agreeable to contemplate. So many spoiled and badly quarried\r\nstones, so many fragments, so much dust and sand, have in them nothing\r\nattractive. It is but a field of ruin which is displayed before you.\r\nBut what does Nature think of it? To judge by the eagerness with which\r\nthe plants take possession of the sand, mingle with it, and convert\r\nit into a soil for their use, Nature is happy enough to see all\r\nthis substance, which, while for thousands of years retained in the\r\nsandstone, did not enter into circulation, returning into the mobility\r\nof the Universal Life. That fortunate battle between man and the rock\r\ndraws, at length, the captive element from its long enchantment. The\r\ngrass seizes upon it; the tree seizes upon it; the animals seize upon\r\nit. All this sand, in which the rock never fails to end eventually,\r\nbecomes permeable to the activity of a vast subterranean world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNothing aroused in my mind a greater number of dreams, no spectacle\r\nthrew me back more directly upon myself. For I, too, through some\r\ndegree of poverty or sluggishness, I have long been rebellious like\r\nthis sandstone, upon which, frequently, nothing can make an impression,\r\nor which, splitting cross-wise, yields but irregular, shapeless\r\nfragments and useless refuse. It needed History, with its weighty\r\niron hammer, to disengage me from myself, to separate me from my own\r\nobstacles, to shatter and release me.\r\n\r\nA severe enfranchisement! What have I not lost of myself, in return for\r\nthe few stones I have contributed to the great monument of the future!\r\nSometimes, doubly stricken by the past and the present, I have felt as\r\nif I were crumbling into pieces--what say I?--into powder, into dust;\r\nand at times I have seen myself, as I see the bottom of yonder quarry,\r\na mass of sand and rubbish.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is through these elements, through an undefinable\r\nsap hidden in the bosom of the flint, that all-powerful Nature has\r\nworked out my renovation. With a little grass and heather binding up\r\nwhat History and the world had crushed, she has said, smilingly: \"You\r\ncreature, you are Time. I am Nature, the everlasting.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThus, then, observe the rough quarry, bristling with the _débris_ of\r\nages, which grows green, once more reproduces, and attires itself in a\r\ngarb of such foliage as it never knew before man applied the iron to\r\nit. \"A wild winter vegetation! Black firs! Melancholy birch-trees!\" But\r\nwith all the gloominess mingles the white hawthorn blossom.\r\n\r\nWhat I have so eagerly craved, and yearned for, in my long years of\r\nsilence, when I was as an arid block and a man of stone, was the fluid\r\nnature of the sap and its capacity of expansion. My tardy youth longed\r\nto dilate my lingering soul. Yesterday, I gave to the world \"The Bird,\"\r\nan impulse of the heart towards light. To-day, the same force compels\r\nme, on the other hand, to descend below the earth, and embark along\r\nwith you on the great living sea of metamorphoses. A world of mysteries\r\nand gloom, it is true; but where, nevertheless, the most penetrating\r\nlight is thrown on the two cherished treasures of the soul--Immortality\r\nand Love.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBook the First.\r\n\r\nMETAMORPHOSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1.--TERROR AND REPUGNANCE OF CHILDHOOD.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTERROR AND REPUGNANCE OF CHILDHOOD.[F]\r\n\r\n[Footnote F: This fragment of a domestic journal was originally\r\nintended for insertion in \"The Bird.\" [It is from the pen of Madame\r\nMichelet.]]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Winter, summer, and nearly all the fine days of the year, had passed\r\nsince the departure of my father for Louisiana, from which he was not\r\nfated to return. Our country-house had remained deserted. My mother,\r\nfull of sad presentiments, and fearing herself to revisit it, sent me\r\nthere, one afternoon, with my brothers, to gather some fruit.\r\n\r\n\"And I went,--cherishing, I must own, a kind of illusion, and almost\r\nbelieving I should be received on the paternal threshold by the beloved\r\narms.\r\n\r\n\"Deeply agitated, I crossed the approach to the domain, and with a\r\nspring arrived opposite the door which my father had so often opened\r\nwith that ineffable smile I still can see.\r\n\r\n\"A child, and yet already a young girl, at that age of the imagination\r\nwhen dreams are so powerful, I opposed the obstinate need of my heart\r\nto the certain fact. I waited a moment on the threshold with a strange\r\nanxiety; the strength of my faith would fain have conquered the sad\r\nreality. But the door remained closed.\r\n\r\n\"Then, with a trembling hand, I opened it myself to find at least\r\nhis shadow within. But that, too, had disappeared. An obscure world,\r\nhostile to the light, had glided into that asylum, and I was, so to\r\nspeak, enveloped in it.\r\n\r\n\"His little black table--a poor family relic--and the shelves of his\r\nbookcase creaked at intervals beneath the teeth of the worm. The\r\nchamber had already put on an air of antiquity. Great motionless\r\nspiders,--guardians, as it were, of the place,--had threaded and\r\ntapestried the empty alcove. Woodlice and millipeds ran and clambered\r\nhither and thither, seeking a refuge under the panelings.\r\n\r\n\"The strange and unforeseen physiognomy of the place afflicted me so\r\nkeenly that I fell back upon myself, and exclaimed, as the tears flowed\r\ndown my cheeks,--'O my father! where are you?'\r\n\r\n\"From that moment I could perceive nothing but the desolateness of the\r\nscene; and everywhere, in the court, in the garden, I found the new and\r\nsilent guests who had taken possession of our places.\r\n\r\n\"Already the gathering mist of evening mingled with the last rays\r\nof the sun, and the slugs, tempted by the warm damp air, emerged in\r\ncrowds from the leaves which strewed the garden-walks. They fared\r\nforth, slowly but surely, to feast on the fallen fruit. Clouds of wasps\r\nrevelled in audacious pillage, tearing to pieces with their keen teeth\r\nour finest peaches and most luscious grapes.\r\n\r\n\"Our apple-trees, formerly so productive, were covered with network\r\nwoven by the caterpillars, and offered us nothing but yellow foliage.\r\nIn less than a year they had grown aged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHILDHOOD'S HOME OF MADAME MICHELET.]\r\n\r\n\"I had never before been brought in contact with a world like this. My\r\nfather's vigilance, and still more successfully, the assistance of the\r\nlittle birds, had preserved us from it. So, in my experience, and with\r\na heart overcome by the spectacle of so much ruin, I cursed those whom\r\none ought not to curse, because all creatures are from God.\r\n\r\n\"Later in life, but much later, I understood the designs of Providence.\r\nWhen man is absent the insect ought to take his place, so that\r\neverything may pass through the great crucible, to be renewed or\r\npurified.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch is the fear, such the instinctive repugnance of the child. But\r\nwe are all children, and even Philosophy, despite its longing after\r\nuniversal sympathy, cannot guard against similar impressions. The\r\napparatus of fantastic weapons with which the insect is usually armed\r\nseems to it a menace against man.\r\n\r\nLiving in a world of strife, it is imperative that the insect should be\r\nborn in mail of proof, and the insects of the Tropics are frequently\r\nterrible to the eye.\r\n\r\nYet a considerable number of these terrifying weapons, pincers, hooks,\r\nsaws, pikes, augers, screws, rollers, and dentilated teeth,--the\r\nformidable arsenal which gives them the appearance of veterans setting\r\nout for the battle-field,--prove, if we examine them rightly, to be the\r\npacific tools with which they gain their livelihood, the implements\r\nwith which they do their regular work. Here the artisan carries his\r\nworkshop with him. He is at once the workman and the manufacturer. What\r\nshould we say of our human operatives, if they marched ever bristling\r\nwith the steel and old iron they make use of in their labours? They\r\nwould appear to us very strange and monstrous, and would even fill our\r\nminds with fear.\r\n\r\nThe insect, as we shall hereafter see, is a warrior through\r\ncircumstances, through the necessities of self-defence or appetite, but\r\ngenerally he is before all and above all industrial. There is not a\r\nsingle species which may not be classified according to its work, and\r\nranged under the banner of a guild of trades.\r\n\r\nThe great achievement of the artist, or, to use the language of our\r\nancient corporations, the test-work of this workman, by which he proves\r\nhimself to be a master, is the cradle. In the Insect World, as the\r\nmother generally dies in giving birth to her child, it is important to\r\nprovide an ingenious asylum which shall protect and support the orphan,\r\nand supply the mother's place. So difficult a work requires tools and\r\nimplements which seem to us inexplicable. This, which you compare to\r\na medieval poignard, to the subtly treacherous weapon of the Italian\r\nbravo, is, on the contrary, an instrument of love and maternity.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, Nature is so far from sharing our prejudices, dislikes,\r\nand childish apprehensions, that she seems specially to care for and\r\nprotect the gnawing species which injuriously interfere with the\r\neconomy of our small farms and plantations, but which, on the other\r\nhand, lend valuable assistance in maintaining the balance of species\r\nand keeping down the vegetable accumulation of certain climates. She\r\npreserves with watchful anxiety the caterpillars which we destroy. In\r\nthe case of the oak-grub, she is mindful to glaze over or varnish its\r\neggs, so that, concealed under the withered leaf, and beaten by winds\r\nand rains, they may safely brave the winter. The crawling worms make\r\ntheir appearance clothed in and defended by a thick furry garb, which\r\ndeceives their enemies, until, transformed into moths, they fly to and\r\nfro in happy freedom under cover of the night.\r\n\r\nFor some she invents still greater precautions. Essential agents,\r\nundoubtedly, in the transformation of life, they possess, beyond all\r\nothers, the guarantees of existence which secure them, infallibly, an\r\nimmortality of race.\r\n\r\nThe grubs, for instance, alternately viviparous and oviparous, spring\r\ninto full life in the summer, that they may the more quickly set to\r\nwork, but are produced in autumn in the shape of an egg, that they may\r\nthe better endure the cold of winter. Finally, their generous mother\r\nreserves for this beloved species an unheard-of gift,--that a moment of\r\nlove shall give them the fecundity of forty generations!\r\n\r\nCreatures so highly privileged have evidently some task to execute,\r\nsome great and important mission which renders them indispensable, and\r\nmakes them an essential part of the harmony of the world. Suns are\r\nnecessary, but so also are gnats. Grand is the order of the Milky Way,\r\nand no less so that of the bee-hive. Who knows but that the life of the\r\nstars may be of minor importance? I see that some of them vanish, and\r\nGod dispenses with them. But no genus of the Insect World ever fails to\r\nanswer to the summons. If a single species of ants should disappear,\r\ntheir loss would be serious, and cause a dangerous gap in the universal\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: II.--COMPASSION.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCOMPASSION.\r\n\r\nOne day, into the studio of the painter Gros entered a pupil of his, a\r\nhandsome and careless young man, who had thought it clever to pin to\r\nhis hat a beautiful butterfly, which, having just been captured, was\r\nstill struggling painfully. The artist, indignant, broke out into a\r\nviolent passion. \"What, wretch!\" he cried, \"is this your feeling for\r\nthe Beautiful? You find an exquisite creature, and can make no better\r\nuse of it than to crucify and kill it barbarously! Begone, begone, and\r\nreturn here no more! Never again make your appearance in my presence!\"\r\n\r\nThis speech will not surprise those who are acquainted with the great\r\nmaster's vivid sensibility, and his reverence for the Beautiful.\r\nWhat is more astonishing is that an anatomist, a man living with the\r\nscalpel always in his hand--Lyonnet--should speak in the same sense,\r\nand so speak in reference to insects which are to ordinary observers\r\nthe least interesting. That able and patient man has opened up, as we\r\nknow, an entirely new channel for science by his colossal investigation\r\nof the willow-grub, from which we learn that the muscular development\r\nof the insect is identical with that of the higher animals. Lyonnet\r\ncongratulates himself that he was able to bring his prolonged labours\r\nto a conclusion without killing more than eight or nine individuals of\r\nthe species he wished to describe.\r\n\r\nA noble result of study! In fathoming life by this persevering\r\ntoil, far from growing coldly indifferent, he became more intensely\r\nsympathetic. The minute details of the infinitely little had revealed\r\nto him the sources of the keen sensibility which Nature has hidden\r\neverywhere. He had found it existing at the bottom of the animal scale,\r\nand thus he acquired a due reverence for every form of life.\r\n\r\nWe are sometimes disquieted, repelled, and dismayed by insects exactly\r\nin proportion to our ignorance. Nevertheless almost every species,\r\nespecially in our European climates, is perfectly harmless. But we\r\nsuspect the unknown; and we are apt to kill those with which we are not\r\nacquainted, by way of acquiring knowledge.\r\n\r\nI remember that, one morning in June, about four o'clock, when the\r\nsun was already high in the heavens, I was aroused somewhat abruptly,\r\nthough still much fatigued and very sleepy. I was living in the\r\ncountry, and my chamber, which faced the east, having neither curtain\r\nnor shutter, the sun's rays fell full upon my bed. A magnificent\r\ndrone, I do not know how, had made its way into the room, and joyously\r\nfluttered and buzzed in the sunshine. I grew weary of the noise. I\r\narose, and thinking he wished to sally forth, threw open the window.\r\nBut no; such was not his intention. The morning, though beautiful, was\r\nvery fresh and damp: he preferred to remain indoors, in a more genial\r\ntemperature, which dried and warmed him. Without, it was four A.M.;\r\nwithin, it was already noon. He acted precisely as I should have done,\r\nand would not depart. Willing to give him time, I left the window open,\r\nand returned to my bed; but I could not sleep. The fresh air from\r\nwithout entering into the room, my drone entered further and further,\r\nand buzzed about and around. The obstinate and importunate guest\r\nexcited in me an angry feeling, and I started up, determined to expel\r\nhim by main force. A handkerchief was my weapon, but undoubtedly I made\r\nuse of it very unskilfully. I stunned, confused, and frightened the\r\ndrone; he whirled round and round in a dizzy fit, but thought less than\r\never of quitting the chamber. My impatience increased: I pursued him\r\nwith greater, with too great impetuosity. He fell on the window-sill,\r\nand rose no more.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWas he dead, or stunned? I would not close the window, thinking that\r\nin the latter case the air might revive him, and he would fly away.\r\nMeanwhile, by no means satisfied with what I had done, I threw myself\r\non my bed. On the whole, it was his own fault. Why did he not escape?\r\nSuch was my first reflection; but afterwards I grew more severe in\r\nself-judgment, and accused my impatience. So great is the tyranny of\r\nman, he can endure nothing. Like all kings, this lord of creation is\r\nimpetuous, and at the slightest contradiction breaks out into a fury,\r\nand kills.\r\n\r\nVery beautiful was the morning; fresh, and yet, by degrees, growing\r\nalmost warm; a happy mixture of temperature, proper to that delightful\r\ncountry and that season of the year: it was Normandy, and the month of\r\nJune. The peculiar characteristic of this month, distinguishing it from\r\nall those that follow, is, that it gives birth to the innocent species\r\nwhich live on vegetable food, but to none of the murderous races which\r\nneed a living prey,--that it breeds flies, but not spiders. Death has\r\nnot yet begun, and love reigns everywhere. All these ideas occurred to\r\nme, but proved by no means agreeable; for at this blessed, sacred time,\r\nwhen a universal confidence prevails, I had already _killed_: man alone\r\nhad broken the peace of God. The thought was very bitter. Whether the\r\nvictim was great or small, mattered but little; the dead was always the\r\ndead. And it was without any serious occasion, without provocation,\r\nthat I had brutally disturbed the sweet harmony of Spring, and spoiled\r\nthe universal idyl.\r\n\r\nWhile revolving all these thoughts, I glanced occasionally from my bed\r\ntowards the window, and watched if the drone did not stir a little, if\r\nhe were really dead. Unhappily he gave not a sign: his immobility was\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nThis lasted for half-an-hour, or about three-quarters; then\r\nsuddenly--without, so far as I could see, the slightest preliminary\r\nmovement--my drone arose with a strong and steady flight, and without\r\nthe slightest hesitancy, as if nothing had befallen him. He passed out\r\ninto the garden, which by that time was thoroughly warmed and filled\r\nwith sunshine.\r\n\r\nI confess that I found in his escape a happiness and a relief; but as\r\nfor my drone, he had never lost heart. I perceived that he had thought\r\nin his tiny prudence that if, by the least sign, he had betrayed\r\nhis returning vitality, his executioner would have finished him.\r\nAccordingly, he imitated death with wonderful fidelity, waiting until\r\nhe had quite recovered his strength and breath,--until his wings, dry\r\nand warm, were fully ready to carry him away; and then, at one leap, he\r\nwas off, without saying _adieu_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was during a journey in Switzerland,--in the land of the Hallers,\r\nthe Hubers, and the Bonnets,--that we began to study seriously; no\r\nlonger contenting ourselves with collections which only displayed the\r\nexterior, but determined on examining the inner organs with microscope\r\nand scalpel. Then also we committed our first crimes.\r\n\r\nI have no need to say that this preoccupation, this emotion--far more\r\ndramatic than one would have supposed--interfered with our journey.\r\nThe sublime, enchanting, and solemn scenes of Switzerland lost, no\r\ndoubt, their due power over us. But life--suffering life (and we were\r\ncompelled to make it suffer)--diverted our thoughts. The hymn or\r\neternal epopea of these infinitely great could scarcely vie with the\r\ndrama of our infinitely little organisms. A fly hid from us the Alps;\r\nthe agony of a beetle, which was ten days dying, veiled Mont Blanc from\r\nour gaze; in the anatomy of an ant we forgot the Jungfrau.\r\n\r\nIt matters not; for who shall rightly determine what is really great\r\nor little? Everything is great, everything important, everything equal\r\nin the bosom of nature and the impartiality of universal love. And\r\nwhere is it more perceptible than in the infinite travail of the little\r\norganic world on which our eyes were fixed? To lift them towards the\r\nmountains, or lower them towards the insects, was one and the same\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM MADAME MICHELET'S JOURNAL.\r\n\r\n\"On the 20th of July, a very hot day, but freshened nevertheless by the\r\nmorning breeze which disported on the lake between Chillon and Clarens,\r\nI went out for a walk alone, my husband remaining indoors to write.\r\nThe sun shot athwart our valleys of the Pays de Vaud, and poured his\r\nfull splendour on the opposite mountains of Savoy. The lake, already\r\nillumined, reflected the sharp ridges of the rocks, whose base, clothed\r\nin pastures, lends life and freshness to its borders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"By-and-by the sun turned, and the scene changed. A warm ray of light\r\npenetrated beyond Chillon, the long defile of the Valais, illuminated\r\nthe pointed Dent du Midi, and coloured in vapour the summit of the\r\nremote St. Bernard. But to this scene of glory I preferred the\r\nmorning hour, when our Montreux reposed in shadow. It was the hour\r\nof divine service at its little church, whose terrace, half-way down\r\nthe slope, propped up by sharp acclivities, wooded, and therefore\r\nobscure, pours out the crystal waters on the thirsty vineyards lying\r\nbelow. Beneath the terrace a beautiful mossy grot, glittering with\r\nstalactites, preserves a delightful feeling of freshness. The fane\r\nabove, surrounded by hospitable wooden seats; a small library (a second\r\ntemple), whence the vine-dressers borrow books; and, finally, a pretty\r\nfountain, combine in a graceful little picture, austerely charming. At\r\nmorning especially, in the half-misty veil which foretokens a day of\r\nheat, this beautiful spot has all the effect of a religious thought,\r\nconcentrating in itself, and yet extended over that immense panorama\r\nwhich the mind embraces, admires, and blesses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"I frequently resorted thither, ascending the first slope of the\r\nmountain, solitary, and enriched with flowers. I took with me a book,\r\nand yet I never read. The prospect was too absorbing. Whether the\r\neye ranged afar over the level mirror of the lake, and the rocks of\r\nMeillerie, with their forests, meadows, and precipices; or hovered\r\nclose at hand about the nest of Clarens and the low towers of Chillon;\r\nor, finally, returned to the pretty villas, with their green lattices,\r\nof our friends the physician and the pastor,[G] in whose company my\r\nhusband laboured;--I remained there in a kind of dream, and my heart,\r\ndeeply moved, felt the sweetness of a holy harmony.\r\n\r\n[Footnote G: It was our good fortune to reside, while at Montreux--the\r\nmost beautiful spot on the wide earth--with a very estimable and rare\r\nindividual, whom I should have thought of Italian or Spanish birth, if\r\nI had not known her to be a Genevese, and the sister of the able and\r\nenthusiastic historian of Geneva. Next door lived an eminent physician,\r\nof simple character, but all the more learned in natural studies.]\r\n\r\n\"But soon I discovered that I was not utterly alone. Bees, or drones,\r\nwhich had also risen early, were already at work, seeking in the cups\r\nof the flowers the honey distilled beneath the dew, penetrating into\r\nthe depths of the campanulas, or skilfully gliding into the mysterious\r\ncorolla of the charming Venus's Slipper. Brilliant cicindelas opened\r\nthe hunt after the gnats, while more unwieldy tribes sought their\r\nlivelihood at the bottom of the herbage.\r\n\r\n\"On this day, then, the 20th of July, allowing my glance to fall\r\nmechanically at my feet, and withdrawing my eyes for a moment from the\r\ntoo luminous picture, I saw with astonishment a scene which vividly\r\ncontrasted with this attractive and holy spot,--an atrocious warlike\r\nstruggle. The insect-giant which we call the stag-beetle, one of the\r\nlargest of European species, a black shining mass, whose horns bristle\r\nwith superb crescent-wise pincers, had seized upon a beetle of far\r\ninferior size. Nevertheless, the two enemies being equally provided\r\nwith admirable defensive arms, after the fashion of the corselets,\r\narmlets, and cuisses of our ancient knights, the struggle was long\r\nand fierce. Both belonged to the murderous race which prey on little\r\ninsects,--were powerful lords in the habit of devouring their vassals.\r\nWhichever had fallen victim in the fray, the Lilliputian people had\r\ncertainly applauded. However, the blind instinctive movement which\r\nleads us, in such cases, to separate the combatants, induced me to\r\ninterfere; and with the point of my umbrella, skilfully, delicately,\r\nand without wounding the two antagonists, I compelled the stronger of\r\nthe two to release its grasp.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe captive thus secured was, without form of trial, adjudged to\r\nundergo our investigations as a punishment for his fratricidal\r\nvoracity. Our system, however, is not to impale the insect,--a horrible\r\npunishment and a pitiful spectacle which has no end; for a month\r\nafterwards, ay, and more, you will see the poor transfixed wretches\r\nwrithing in agony. Ether generally kills them rapidly, and apparently\r\npainlessly. Well, then, we _etherized_ our prisoner largely. In a\r\nmoment he spun round and fell: we thought him finished. An hour or two\r\npassed, and lo! he was once more alive, once more upright on trembling\r\nfeet, and attempting to walk; he fell, and again he rose. But, to tell\r\nthe truth, his gait was like that of a drunken man. A child would have\r\nlaughed at it. We had no desire to laugh, being obliged to poison him\r\na second time. A stronger dose was accordingly administered; but in\r\nvain,--he came again to himself. It was a curious circumstance; but\r\nit certainly seemed as if this kind of intoxication, while weakening\r\nand almost paralyzing the faculties of motion, had all the more keenly\r\nexcited the nerves, and what we may call the amorous faculties. The use\r\nhe sought to make of his vacillating step and last efforts was to join\r\na female of his species which we had found lying dead, and placed upon\r\nthe table. He felt her with his palpi and trembling arms. He contrived\r\nto turn her over, and tumbled about (very probably he could not see) to\r\nassure himself whether she was alive. He would not part from her: one\r\nwould have sworn that he had undertaken, though dying, to resuscitate\r\nthe dead. It was a fantastic, a gloomy, and yet, for one who knows at\r\nheart that all nature is identical, a touching spectacle.\r\n\r\nIt afflicted us greatly; we attempted to shorten it by the help of the\r\nether, and to separate this Juliet from her Romeo. But the indomitable\r\nmale laughed at all our poisons, and dismally dragged himself along.\r\nWe shut him up in a large box, where he did not die until after a\r\nconsiderable period, and incredibly large doses. His punishment--and,\r\nreader, you may justly call it _ours_--endured for fully fifteen days.\r\n\r\nThis robust, enduring being, with his inextinguishable flame of life,\r\nthrew us into a prolonged reverie.\r\n\r\nOn our first dabbling in bloodshed, Nature had wished to show us, and\r\nwith a master's hand, the strange and unconquerable energy with which\r\nshe has endowed life. \"Love is strong as death.\" Where do we find this\r\nsaying? In the Bible. Yes; and it is also the eternal Bible. For what\r\nmore powerfully consecrates existence, and renders it sympathetic,\r\nreverend, and sacred? And how great a pity it is, then, to cut it short\r\nat the divine moment when every being has its share of God!\r\n\r\nWe excused ourselves by saying that this insect, which lives six years\r\nin a single night, could have spread its wings beneath the sky but two\r\nmonths longer,--just long enough to perpetuate its race. We deprived\r\nit, therefore, of a very little time--a month out of six or seven years.\r\n\r\nYes; but that month was the epoch to which all its life had tended.\r\nPreviously it had only vegetated; but then, it could really have lived\r\nand reigned, powerful and joyous. Long an insect, in that hour it would\r\nhave become almost a bird, a son of the flower-enamelled earth and the\r\ngenial light. We had acted like the Parcæ, which delight in cutting the\r\nthread of our lives at the very moment of happiness!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: III.--WORLD-BUILDERS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nWORLD-BUILDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a world under this world, above, below, and all around it, of\r\nwhich we have no suspicion.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, indeed, we catch a faint murmur, a sound, and thereupon\r\nwe say, \"It is a trifle, it is nothing.\" But this nothing is the\r\nInfinite.\r\n\r\nThe Infinite of the invisible life, the silent life, the world of night\r\nand of the inner earth, of the shadowy ocean,--the unseen creatures of\r\nthe air which we breathe, or which, mingling in the fluids we drink,\r\ncirculate within us unperceived.\r\n\r\nAn immensely powerful world, which in its details we scorn, but which\r\nat intervals affrights us, when it stands revealed before our eyes in\r\none of its grand unforeseen manifestations.\r\n\r\nThe navigator, for example, who at night sees the ocean shimmering with\r\nlustre and wreathing garlands of fire, is at first diverted by the\r\nspectacle. He sails ten leagues; the garland is indefinitely prolonged;\r\nit stirs, and twists, and knots itself in harmony with the motions of\r\nthe wave; it becomes a monstrous serpent ever extending its sinuous\r\nlength to thirty, ay, and forty leagues. Yet all this is but a dance of\r\nimperceptible animalcules! What are their numbers? At this question the\r\nimagination starts back aghast; it perceives in the distance a nature\r\nof gigantic force, of terrific wealth, but possessing little relation\r\nto the other, the well-ordered, and, in a certain degree, economical\r\nnature, of the higher life.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to speak of insects or molluscs without naming these\r\nanimalcules, which seem to be their rough outline, and in the extreme\r\nsimplicity of their organism already foretoken, indicate, and prepare\r\nfor them. With a good microscope you can discern these miniatures of\r\nthe insect, which simulate their organism, and mimic their movements.\r\nWhen you are able to distinguish the _Rotifers_, you think that in\r\nthe aggregations and in the tentacles of their mouth you recognize\r\nthem as little polypes. The _Rhizopods_, though almost imperceptible,\r\nare furnished, nevertheless, with good solid carapaces, which are\r\nequally as good a protection for them as their great shells are for the\r\nmolluscs, the oyster and the snail. The microscopic _Tardigradæ_ are,\r\nin fact, closely connected with insects, and the _Acarina_ with worms.\r\n\r\nWhat are these least of the little? Simply the architects or builders\r\nof the globe which we inhabit. With their bodies and their remains they\r\nhave prepared the soil now echoing under our feet. Whether their tiny\r\nshells be still distinguishable, or whether they have been decomposed\r\ninto chalk, they are not the less the foundation of immense portions of\r\nour earth. A single bed of this chalk stretches from Paris to Tours;\r\nthat is, for fifty miles. Another, of enormous breadth, spreads over\r\nall Champagne. Pure chalk, or Spanish white, which we find everywhere,\r\nis composed of pounded shells.\r\n\r\nAnd it is these most minute of organisms which have wrought the\r\ngrandest of works. The imperceptible rhizopod has built for itself a\r\nnobler monument than the Pyramids; nothing less than Central Italy,\r\na notable portion of the chain of the Apennines. But even this was\r\ntoo insignificant: the colossal masses of Chili, the prodigious\r\nCordilleras, which look down upon the world at their feet, are\r\nthe funeral monument wherein this impalpable--I had almost said\r\ninvisible-organism has interred the remains of its vanished race.\r\n\r\nA bygone world, hidden beneath the present and upper world in the\r\nprofundities of life or the obscurity of time!\r\n\r\nWhat might it not tell us, if God would give it speech, and permit it\r\nto recall all that it has done or is doing for us! What just demands\r\nmight not the elementary plants, the imperfect animals whose dust\r\nhas fashioned for our use the fertile crust of the globe, that noble\r\ntheatre of life, address to us! \"While you were still asleep,\" might\r\nsay the ferns, \"we alone, by transforming and purifying the previously\r\nirrespirable air, created after thousands upon thousands of years the\r\nearth now blooming with the corn and the rose! We accumulated that\r\nsubterranean treasure of enormous coal-beds which warms your hearth;\r\nand that one mass, among others, a hundred leagues in length, which\r\nfeeds the great forge of the world from London to Newcastle.\"\r\n\r\n\"We,\" the imperceptibles might say,--the obscure and unnamed\r\nanimalcules despised or ignored by man,--\"we are thy guardians, have\r\nlaid out thy fields, and built thy dwelling-places. It is not the great\r\nfossil rhinoceros or mastodon whose bones have made thy soil; it is\r\n_our_ work--or rather, it is ourselves. Thy cities, thy Louvres, and\r\nthy Capitols are constructed with our _débris_. Life itself in its\r\nessence, in that sparkling beverage by which France diffuses joy over\r\nall the earth, whence comes it? From arid hills where the vine thrives\r\nin the white dust that once was _we_, and absorbs the concealed warmth\r\nof our prior existences.\"\r\n\r\nThe demand made upon us would be a lengthened one; restitution\r\nimpossible. These dead myriads, having nourished with their lime the\r\nvarious articles that form our sustenance, have passed into our very\r\nbeing. Others also would put forth a claim. The very pebble, the hard\r\nflint, once lived, and now nourishes life.\r\n\r\nGreat was the astonishment in Europe when a Berlin\r\nprofessor--Ehrenberg--informed us that the silicious stone, so sharp,\r\nrough, and brittle, the _tripoli_ with which metals are polished, is\r\nneither more nor less than an aggregation of dead animalcules, an\r\naccumulation of the shells of infusoria of a terrible diminutiveness.\r\nSo small is the creature I speak of, that it takes one hundred and\r\neighty-seven millions to weigh a grain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe labours of the unseen architects of the globe, admired by our men\r\nof science in extinct species, travellers have discovered revived\r\nin living species. They have surprised, in our own day, immense\r\nlaboratories in permanent activity, of beings invisible in themselves,\r\nor apparently powerless, but really of boundless capacity of toil, if\r\nwe judge by its results. What death accomplishes for life, life itself\r\nrelates. Numbers of tiny organisms become by their present works the\r\ninterpreters and historians of their vanished predecessors.\r\n\r\nThese, like the latter, with their structures, or their _débris_,\r\nbuild up islands in the sea, and construct immense banks of reefs,\r\nwhich, gradually joining together, will become new lands. Without going\r\nfurther than Sicily, we find among the madrepores, that cover its\r\ncoasts torn by volcanic fires, a little animal, the zoophyte, which\r\nhas accomplished a task man would never have dared to undertake. He\r\ncontrives to move forward by protecting his soft body with a shield of\r\nstone which he incessantly secretes. Continuously developing the tubes\r\nwhich in succession afford him shelter, he entirely fills up the empty\r\nspaces left by the madrepores or corals, bridges over the intervals\r\nbetween the reefs, and connects them with one another; finally, he\r\ncreates a passage in defiles previously impassable. In due time this\r\nbuilder will have accomplished the colossal task of a causeway all\r\naround the island in its circumference of a hundred and eighty leagues.\r\n\r\nBut it is more particularly in the vast Southern Ocean that these\r\nworks are prosecuted on a grand scale by the polypes of the lime,\r\nthe corallines, and madrepores of every kind; an animal vegetation\r\nworthy of comparison with the labour of the mosses in a peat-moor,\r\nwhich continue to flourish in their upper growth while the lower are\r\ntransformed and decomposed. Exactly like these vegetables, the polypes,\r\nand even their production, the coral, while still soft and tender,\r\nfrequently become the nourishment of worms and fishes which feed and\r\nbrowse upon them like our cattle, derive their sustenance from them,\r\nand return them in the shape of chalk, without the slightest indication\r\nof a previous existence! Recently English seamen have discovered at\r\nthe bottom of the sea this manufacture of chalk, which is incessantly\r\npassing from the living into the inorganic condition.\r\n\r\nBut these destructive causes do not prevent the polypes from\r\nimperturbably carrying on their gigantic labours, incessantly elevating\r\nthe islands and solid barriers which are so skilfully adapted to resist\r\nthe oceanic action. They divide the work among themselves according\r\nto their species. The idlest execute their share in the quiet waters,\r\nor in the great depths, remotest from the light; others, under the\r\nsunshine, among the very breakers of which they eventually become the\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\nSoft, gelatinous, elastic, adhering to their support, the stony and\r\nporous mass; they deaden the fury of the boiling waters which would\r\nwear out the granite, and split the rock into fragments.\r\n\r\nUnder the mild trade-winds which prevail in the tropic climates, the\r\nsea would uniformly flow with a tranquil tide if it did not encounter\r\nthese living ramparts, which force it back upon itself, scatter its\r\nwaves in spray, and vex it with everlasting torment.\r\n\r\nThat the waters should assault them is their fate. But they inflict no\r\ninjury upon them; and in truth it is on their behalf they toil. Their\r\nviolence does not wear _them_, but it wears the reef, and detaches in\r\natoms the lime on which they live and with which they build. This lime,\r\nabsorbed by them and _animalized_, changes into a hundred sparkling,\r\nliving, active flowers, which are identical with our polypes, and form\r\nquite an analogous world enamelling the ocean-bed.\r\n\r\nOn the margin of these islands,--which are generally circular, like a\r\nring,--accumulates a layer of vegetable wealth, which speedily grows\r\ngreen, and embellishes itself with the only tree that can endure\r\nsalt-water, the cocoa-nut palm. This, then, is the _humus_; the\r\nlife which will for ever continue to develop. The fresh springs and\r\nfountains will next make their appearance, invited and fed by the\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSuch is the original type of a young world which in due time will be\r\ninhabited. The cocoa-palm will have its insects; the birds will pause\r\non its boughs; men will gather its fruit. Wrecked ships and floating\r\ntimbers, propelled by the sea, will bring there after awhile tenants of\r\nevery kind.\r\n\r\nSome of these islands, when extended, enlarged, and solidified, measure\r\nnot less than twenty-five miles in circumference. Many are larger\r\nstill; fertile, inhabited, and populous, like the Maldives.\r\n\r\nThe ambition of their architects might rest contented, you would think,\r\nwith these vast creations. But to insure their fixity, they have\r\nincreased their extent. The buttresses by which they strengthen their\r\nwork at the bottom of the sea being prolonged and elevated, expand\r\ninto banks, which link the isles to each other over an immense area.\r\nAlong the line of burning life, in the tropic zone, these indefatigable\r\nbuilders have daringly intersected the sea and worked athwart its\r\ncurrents, and already are arresting the courses of our navigators.\r\n\r\nNew Caledonia is now surrounded by a reef of 145 leagues in length. The\r\nchain of the Maldive Islands measures 480 English miles. To the east of\r\nNew Holland stretches a bank of polypes over 360 leagues, 127 of these\r\nwithout interruption. Finally, in the Pacific Ocean the mass known as\r\nthe Dangerous Archipelago is about 400 leagues in length by 150 in\r\nbreadth.\r\n\r\nIf they continue after this fashion, incessantly connecting their\r\nvarious piles of submarine masonry, they will perhaps realize the\r\nprophecy of Kirby, who discerned in the coral isles and reefs the\r\npossibility of a new world--a brilliant and fertile world; and in the\r\ncourse of centuries may accomplish the formation of a causeway, an\r\nimmense bridge, connecting Asia with America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IV.--LOVE AND DEATH.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nLOVE AND DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbove the infinite elementary life,--that quasi-vegetable life in\r\nwhich generation is but, as it were, a-budding,--begins the distinct,\r\nindividual, and complete organism whose strongly centralized electric\r\nnetwork of nerves is able to sympathize directly with the rapid energy\r\nof its acts and resolutions.\r\n\r\nHowever humble the insect may seem in appearance, it is from the first\r\nindependent of the immovable, expectant existence of all the inferior\r\nraces. It is born entirely free from that communistic fatalism which\r\nmerges the being of each in the life of all. It exists independently;\r\nit moves, goes, comes, advances or returns, changes its determination\r\nor its direction at pleasure, or in obedience to its wants, appetites,\r\nand caprices. It suffices for itself; it foresees, provides, defends,\r\nand boldly confronts the most unexpected chances.\r\n\r\nIn this, then, do we not discern, as it were, a first glimpse of\r\npersonality?\r\n\r\nThe individual stands out from the mass. He shows himself all at once\r\nadmirably provided with the instruments necessary for the support\r\nand sustenance of the individual existence. He is born greedy and\r\n_absorbent_. But this very absorbingness is exactly the service which\r\nNature expects of him. It is his mission to purify and disencumber\r\nthe world; to clear it of morbid or extinct animal matter, which acts\r\nas an obstacle to the growth of life; to save the latter from the\r\nconsequences of its excessive fecundity, the danger of its abundance.\r\n\r\nNo other being, as we shall prove, exercises so great an influence\r\nupon our globe; no other throws itself into the condition of general\r\nexistence with so vital an energy. But this extraordinary strength,\r\nin such disproportion to the size, bulk, and weight of the insect, is\r\nsubject to a severe law; the rapid, absolute, and complete renewal, at\r\neach generation, of the individual.\r\n\r\n_Love implies death._ To engender and to beget is to die. He who is\r\nborn, by the very act of his birth kills.\r\n\r\nThis is a sentence common to all beings, but carried out upon none more\r\nliterally than upon the insect.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is death for the father to love. It is\r\nindispensable that he should surrender all his powers, and exhaust the\r\nbest part of his vitality; that he should perish in himself, to revive\r\nin him to whom he shall have transmitted his germ of resurrection.\r\n\r\nAnd for the mother, too, in most of the insect species, the\r\ncondemnation is the same. She will love, give birth, and speedily die.\r\nLove for her shall not have its prize and recompense. She shall not\r\nsee her sons. She shall not enjoy the consolations of death in seeing\r\nherself survive in her image.\r\n\r\nA great and harsh difference between this mother and the mothers\r\nof superior animals! The woman--or the female of the mammal--as a\r\nrule cherishes in her own body her beloved treasure, warms it with\r\nher own flame, and feeds it with her love. How envious would be the\r\ninsect-mother, if she knew of this supreme maternal happiness! But\r\n_she_ must seek of an ungenial nature, must demand of some other\r\nbeing--tree, plant, fruit, or perhaps the earth itself--that it will\r\ncondescend to continue the work of her maternity. This is rigorous, but\r\nit is not cruel. Let us look at it seriously. If death separate the\r\nmother and the child, it is because they cannot live together; because\r\nthey are strongly sundered by the opposite conditions of life and\r\nnutrition. The child, at first a lowly grub, larva, or worm, an obscure\r\nminer, a concealed nocturnal worker, must for a long time continue\r\nto feed upon the coarsest food, and sometimes even on death itself.\r\nShe, the mother, who, winged and transfigured, has mounted to a higher\r\nlife; and lives solely on the honied sweets of flowers,--how could she\r\naccustom herself to the shades, and the useful but abject circumstances\r\nin which her offspring grows strong? That which is salutary and vital\r\nfor the tenebrous child of the earth would be fatal to an aërial\r\nmother, who has already fluttered in the warmth and genial light of\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is needful for the due development of the child that its mother\r\nshould provide it with a triple or quadruple cradle, and there deposit\r\nit; not neglected, and without succour, but furnished with its first\r\naliment--an aliment light and fitted for its feebleness, which it can\r\nfind on its waking up into life. This done, she closes the door, seals\r\nit, and voluntarily excludes and interdicts herself from returning\r\nthither. Thenceforth she must cede her rights to the universal mother,\r\nwho shall replace her--Nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThat in such a cradle the child should live commodiously,--that from\r\nits own body it should draw out a silky covering to line its plastic\r\nprison,--that finally, when sufficiently strong, it should issue forth\r\nunder the influence of the heat,--this is self-explanatory, and we\r\nadmire without being astonished. But what really excites our wonder\r\nis, that the mother,--a butterfly, or perhaps a beetle,--after the\r\nnumerous changes through which she has passed, after her numerous\r\nsloughings, transitory slumbers, and metamorphoses, should remember,\r\nfor her offspring's behoof, the place or plant where formerly she\r\nherself was nourished, and grew, and took her point of departure! It\r\nis a marvel which confounds the mind. Those creatures apparently the\r\nmost heedless--the fly, or light-headed butterfly--at the moment when\r\napproaching death brightens them with the radiance of love, collect, as\r\nit were, their thoughts, and seem to revive their recollections. Then,\r\nwithout lapse or error, they flee away; and lo! the plant which was\r\ntheir own early residence, their birthplace, and their cradle, shall\r\nagain become their home, and protect their offspring!\r\n\r\nAll at once they show themselves prudent, foreseeing, and skilful.\r\nTo obtain an entrance to this asylum, they practise unknown arts and\r\ndisplay incredible address. How is this? What happens? Sometimes their\r\nweapons of war, diverted to other uses, become instruments of love;\r\nsometimes new and hitherto concealed apparatus,--frequently of an\r\nextremely complex character,--make their appearance; and yet all for\r\nthis solitary act, for this single day.\r\n\r\nA curious book has been written on the mechanism and infinitely varied\r\ninstrumentation with which insects are provided for the discharge of\r\nthe maternal duty. Their implements are often charming from their\r\nprecision, delicacy, and subtlety. It will suffice to particularize\r\nthat of the rose-bush aphis,--so well described by Réaumur, as a saw\r\nwhose two blades act in an inverse direction, and whose teeth are each\r\na set of teeth.\r\n\r\nO unheard-of power of Love! Whether this divine workman prepares for\r\nthem their tiny tools, or whether he inspires them to fashion their own\r\nby the effort and vehemency of the burning maternal desire, it matters\r\nnot: you see them duly fabricated, and acting when wanted in a wholly\r\nunexpected manner.\r\n\r\nIt is a simple task for the tribes of sociable insects which labour\r\nwith the assistance and protection of a numerous republic; but it is\r\ninfinitely arduous and painful for the solitary mothers, who, without\r\nauxiliary, spouse, or friend, undertake enormous enterprises, and\r\nfrequently raise constructions which might be the work of giants,--such\r\nas the nest of the mason-wasp. One is lost in astonishment at the\r\namount of patience and strength of will required for so colossal an\r\nedifice.\r\n\r\nThis excessive toil ages the mother in a few days. She wears herself\r\nout, yet does not enjoy the fruit. Frequently the elaborate cradle\r\nserves for another. Too frequently a usurping stranger seizes upon it,\r\nprofits by the meritorious work, and establishes there its progeny,\r\nwhich will not only consume the provision of the rightful tenant, but\r\nfeed also on the unfortunate tenant himself!\r\n\r\nWho will not bestow a glance of pity on this great work, and a result\r\nof such uncertain character?\r\n\r\nIn the burning days of July, when the narrow belt of forests\r\nsurrounding Fontainebleau concentrated upon it the summer heats, we\r\nwere astonished at the incessant and continuous labour, despite the\r\nindolence of the season, of a solitary bee which was ever going and\r\ncoming. Her indefatigable journeys always brought her near some vases\r\nof camelias and rose-bays. I saw her, still fair and shapely, of a\r\nbeautiful brown mingled with black, returning, at regular intervals\r\nof about five minutes, with woven fragments of leaves, which she\r\nintroduced through a deep aperture into the soil of the vase where she\r\nhad made her nest.\r\n\r\nFor three days she worked with undiminished ardour. There were no signs\r\nthat she took the least food: constantly at her work, she appeared to\r\nhave already abandoned all care for her own life.\r\n\r\nHer preoccupation was so great and her activity so eager that we were\r\nable to approach her very closely. Nothing frightened her; so that we\r\ncould establish ourselves at our ease near her little nest, and observe\r\nher with as much patience as she herself brought to her work.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth morning we found the opening closed, and we saw her no\r\nmore. She had completed her task. Exhausted, but rejoicing at its\r\nconclusion, she had retired undoubtedly to some obscure recess to await\r\nher destiny.\r\n\r\nWe proceeded delicately to loosen the soil around the sides of the\r\nvase, in order to examine into what she had done.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom, resembling in shape a couple of thimbles, lay two\r\ncradles, and in these cradles two little ones. All the care had been\r\nfor them: so many young, so many cells.\r\n\r\nEach was composed of six-and-twenty fragments of leaves. Réaumur, in a\r\nsimilar nest, counted but sixteen. Six of these fragments, which closed\r\nup the entrance, were perfectly round,--a remarkable fact, if we bear\r\nin mind that the instrument which achieved the work was by no means\r\nappropriate to it. Yet they were as accurately finished off as if done\r\nby a punch.\r\n\r\nThe other portions of leaf, cut into ovals, and carefully placed one\r\nupon another in due accordance with the contour of the nest, resembled\r\nso many roofs designed by the indefatigable mother as a protection\r\nagainst the wind and rain. At the bottom lay a little honey; the last\r\nand tender legacy of the mother, bequeathed by her to those whom she\r\nhad abandoned for ever.\r\n\r\nWe shall enjoy the satisfaction of seeing them weave their winter\r\nshelter. It will be pleasanter for them under our roof than at the\r\nbottom of the vase. The mother's intentions will be carefully carried\r\nout. Adopted, tended, and removed to Paris, the nymphs of Fontainebleau\r\nwill take, one fine morning in spring, their flight above our windows,\r\nand, as young bees, will be able to gather, if not the honey of the\r\nheather, at least that of the Luxembourg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: V.--THE ORPHAN: ITS FEEBLENESS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE ORPHAN: ITS FEEBLENESS.[H]\r\n\r\n[Footnote H: _La Frileuse_,--literally, \"The chilly one.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have told the easiest and pleasantest story to relate, the story\r\nof the privileged creature for whom its mother has duly provided, and\r\nwho is nourished and clothed by her efforts. But many--in truth, the\r\ngreatest number--enter life destitute and necessitous. They fall naked\r\ninto the great world.\r\n\r\nPoverty the audacious, necessity the ingenious, the severe internal\r\ntravail of hunger and desire, stimulate and develop the energetic\r\norgans which come to their assistance.\r\n\r\nWhat organs? The great Swammerdam, the martyr of patience, was\r\nthe first to distinguish them. With a piercing eye, examining the\r\nnewly-hatched egg,--that dubious foundation!--he seized the opening\r\nlineaments of life, and marked in them the profound and decisive\r\ncharacters which make the mystery of the insect. He saw the little\r\ncreature, with its gelatinous body, push forward its mandible or\r\njaws,--a distinct and complete organ, placed in front of the mouth, and\r\nvisibly intended to nourish and protect the still feeble being.\r\n\r\nBehind this active apparatus he detected on the sides of the body a\r\npassive apparatus, a series of tiny mouths or valves (the _stigmata_)\r\nwhich await the air, and open to receive it.\r\n\r\nIngenious precautions! The orphan born completely naked, and launched\r\ninto life unprotected to undergo the most toilsome metamorphoses,\r\nis rendered competent for the task only by eating greedily from the\r\nmoment of its birth, absorbing and devouring! It must eat always and\r\neverywhere, even in the least respirable atmosphere, and in unhealthy\r\nand deadly places. It is for this reason nature has endowed it with\r\na slower, and, if I may so speak, a more suspicious circulation and\r\nrespiration, than that of the superior creatures which live only\r\nin pure air. In these creatures, as in man, the blood continually\r\nflows to meet the air and be vivified by it. In the insect, on the\r\ncontrary, the protecting apparatus which guards its lateral mouths\r\nare disposed in such a manner as to be able always to moderate, sift,\r\nand, if need be, exclude, the invading atmosphere. One is overcome\r\nwith surprise by the infinite variety of the combinations designed\r\nfor this end, the numerous mechanical and chemical arts of the most\r\ncomplicated character. To receive and yet not receive, to breathe\r\nwithout breathing, to preserve the control of what must nevertheless\r\nbe a passive function, to trust and yet mistrust, to surrender and yet\r\nprotect, is the difficult problem which life here proposed to itself,\r\nand of which it has found innumerable solutions. To give air to a\r\ngrub! Behold, arrogant humanity, which callest thyself the centre of\r\nall things, the most laborious effort that has engrossed the powers of\r\nnature!\r\n\r\nIts circulation resembles that of the embryo in the bosom of its\r\nmother. But how much less favourable the condition of the insect! The\r\nfoetus is in immediate contact with the world through the soft maternal\r\nmedium. The motherless insect embryo does not swim, like the other, in\r\na sea of milk. It is cradled in the rude mould of the universal life;\r\nit travels therein at great peril, on the rude earth, from shock to\r\nshock.\r\n\r\nThis fact the moderns have recognized,--_the insect is an embryo_. But\r\nwho would suppose that this very circumstance would doom it to death?\r\nHow rude a contradiction! An embryo launched into the thick of the\r\nfray, to be the victim of all--of birds, and even of insects. An embryo\r\narmed, it is true; and nothing is stranger than to see the soft grubs\r\nbrandishing their threatening jaws, while their feeble body, deprived\r\nof all defence, is exposed on every side.\r\n\r\nFlight offers them but few chances; their best protection is night.\r\nAnd therefore they shun the light,--they live as they can under the\r\nground, in the wood, or at least beneath the leaf. If this be true of\r\nthe larvæ, the grubs, of what we call worms, we may say the same of the\r\ninsect. For its first period (that of the larva) endures a considerable\r\ntime, though its life as a nymph, and finally its third period, last\r\nbut a very brief while. Numerous species (May-bugs, stag-beetles, and\r\nthe like) have three to six years of a tenebrous existence, and only\r\nthree months under the sun.\r\n\r\nEven the insects which live longest in the sun, like the bees and the\r\nants, work willingly in obscurity; are partial to the shadows of their\r\nhives and ant-hills.\r\n\r\nWe may assert as a general rule that _the insect is the child of night_.\r\n\r\nMost insects shun the day. But how can they avoid the air? Even in hot\r\ncountries, the contact of the variable atmosphere with a live nude\r\nbody, whose epidermis is not yet hardened, becomes infinitely painful.\r\nIn our severe climates, each breath of air must produce the sensation\r\nof piercing arrows, of a million of fine needles. What would it be, O\r\nHeaven, for a poor human foetus to issue, after a week or a fortnight,\r\nfrom its mother's womb, and instead of peacefully undergoing the\r\ntransformations which strengthen it, to be subjected to them in a naked\r\ncondition and in open day? What would be its sensations on quitting its\r\nsoft asylum, and falling into the cold air? Yet such must be those of\r\nthe insect, when, soft, feeble, assailable, and penetrable everywhere,\r\nstill almost floating and gelatinous to the eye, it experiences the\r\ncold, and the wind, and the shock of so many painful accidents.\r\n\r\nCertain clothed species are a little better protected. Some are lodged\r\nin the heart of a fruit. Others (bees and ants) form a protecting\r\ncommunity; but the immense majority are born solitary and naked.\r\n\r\nSome of our readers, always well clothed and warmed, will say, I am\r\nsure, that cold is an excellent thing, which stimulates the appetite\r\nand strengthens the frame. But those who have been poor will very well\r\nunderstand my preceding observations. For my part, recollections of\r\nmy childhood convince me that cold is, in all truth, a punishment;\r\nyou cannot get accustomed to it; its prolongation does not render its\r\neffect less severe. How keen a joy I felt (in rigorous winters) at\r\neach thaw which released me from my agitated, terrified, and uneasy\r\ncondition, and secured the happy re-establishment of the internal\r\nharmony!\r\n\r\nI do not deny, however, that cold may not be a powerful tonic, which\r\nsharpens and braces up the mind, and draws from it fresh efforts of\r\ninvention. Cold, as well as hunger--and perhaps hunger especially--is\r\nthe great stimulus of the arts; hunger weakens, cold strengthens.\r\n\r\nIt is the powerful inspirer of infinite swarms of those chilly\r\ncreatures which seek before all things, as soon as they are born, the\r\nmeans of covering themselves. They are not in want of food; nature\r\nhas everywhere prepared for them an ample banquet. All the vegetable\r\nkingdom, and a great part of the animal, are at their disposal; they\r\nmight live tender and indolent, as the child sleeps at its ease on\r\nthe maternal placenta which nourishes its slothfulness. But the cold\r\nirritates them; the cold damp air deadens and paralyzes their entrails;\r\nfinally, the light wounds them. They can enjoy no repose until they\r\nhave secured a shelter. In the lowest grade of life the smallest grub\r\nbecomes an artist, and by weaving, and spinning, and carving has soon\r\ncontrived a robe, and, as with a second skin over her too sensitive\r\nepidermis, has covered her suffering nakedness. Happy she who finds\r\nherself placed at the outset on a prepared soil, a cloth of warm\r\nwool, a fine fur: she does not fail to make in hot haste, according\r\nto our human fashion, a pretty paletot fitted to her figure; which,\r\nnevertheless, she leaves a little loose, like economical mothers for\r\ntheir young growing children, in whose case the garb too large to-day\r\nwill be tight and well-fitting to-morrow.\r\n\r\nThose who on their birth come in contact with chill green leaves,\r\nand their lustrous glaze, are still more industrious. They practise\r\narts which astonish the observer. Some raise enormous masses with\r\nimperceptible cables, and by mechanical processes analogous to those\r\nwhich were employed in removing and rearing the obelisk of the Place\r\nde la Concorde. Others cut out figures purposedly irregular, which the\r\nseam afterwards fits into its harmonious _ensemble_.\r\n\r\nEvery industrial corporation may be found represented in this little\r\nworld: tailors, weavers, felters, spinners, miners, and the like.\r\nAnd in each corporation you meet with species working each after its\r\npeculiar fashion, by the various processes appropriate to it.\r\n\r\nThe tailors work from a pattern. They mark out on the leaf a suitable\r\npiece; which they remove, and lay upon another leaf; tack it, cut out\r\na second on the first model, and stitch them together. This done, with\r\ntheir scaly head they flatten the ribs, just as the tailor smooths down\r\nthe seams with his iron. Then they line this coat, which they carry\r\nabout with them, with the very finest silk.\r\n\r\nOthers work in mosaic, others in marquetry and veneering. After having\r\nwoven the robe, they disguise it by artistically gluing to it a variety\r\nof surrounding materials. The aquatic insects, for example, embellish\r\ntheirs with moss, lentils, mussels, or little snails.\r\n\r\nThe miners erect galleries between a couple of leaves, and roam about\r\nin them, constructing places of exit and ingress in their subterranean\r\nabodes.\r\n\r\nThe labour is great. But among all the species an admirable justice\r\nprevails. Whoso works hard while a child, does little when an adult;\r\nand _vice versâ_. The bee, which in the larva state is richly fed\r\nby its parents, and always carried about and cradled, is destined\r\nhereafter to an exceedingly laborious life.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, another insect which, as a grub, has toiled, and\r\nwoven, and spun, will having nothing to do in its later life but\r\nwhisper love-phrases to the rose. I am speaking of Sir Butterfly.\r\n\r\nFor the great majority, hard work is for infancy, for the larva or\r\nthe grub; work twofold and excessive. On the one hand, the constant,\r\nurgent, and pressing search after the food craved for by an immense\r\ninternal need; the necessity of recruiting and renewing its energies,\r\nof restoring the inherited organs, and developing new ones.\r\n\r\nThe existence of these poor motherless creatures is divided between two\r\nsevere conditions: toil, and growth through disease.\r\n\r\nFor their moultings, or sloughings, are, in effect, a disease.\r\n\r\nThe painful moment having arrived for the little creature to change\r\nits clothing, a clothing which clings to its flesh, it is seized with\r\nillness, abandons its leaf, and creeps languidly to some solitary\r\nasylum. If you saw it in such a soft, inert, and withered condition, so\r\ndifferent from its natural state, you would say it was on the point of\r\ndeath. And many do, indeed, succumb at this laborious crisis.\r\n\r\nPassive, and suspended to a branch, it waits until nature shall\r\ncomplete its work,--until its epidermis be detached from the second\r\nskin beneath, recalling it to all the energies of life.\r\n\r\nIt is then that you see the garb, which was formerly so brilliant, dry\r\nup and harden like a thenceforth useless thing, carried hither and\r\nthither by the wind.\r\n\r\nBut before it will yield and separate, the invalid, despite of its\r\nweakness, must twist in every direction, and writhe, and swell, and\r\ncontract, and employ all the efforts of a being in its strongest\r\nmoments.\r\n\r\nAt length it has conquered; the old sheath is rent; and I see the\r\ninsect free, but bathed in sweat.\r\n\r\nDo not touch it yet, for the slightest pressure will wound. Of this\r\nit is aware, and lies perfectly motionless. It is pale, and almost\r\nswooning; it must wait patiently, before beginning to move, till\r\nits skin is less sensitive and its limbs are much firmer. Soon,\r\nfortunately, it will be invigorated by its food; it feels a terrible\r\nhunger, which restores its strength and prepares it for another\r\nsloughing. Such is its destiny. It is condemned to deliver itself\r\ncontinually in a series of _accouchements_, until it finally attains\r\nits latest transformation.\r\n\r\nIf either the exertion or the pain inspire it with a transient gleam of\r\nthought, it would say, on each painful occasion: \"Now it is ended! I\r\nhave finished my task; I will rest in peace; this is my last change.\"\r\nTo which Nature would respond: \"Not yet! not yet! Thou art not yet\r\nengendered. What art thou? Nothing but a larva, a mask which is about\r\nto fall.\"\r\n\r\nWhat! A mask! and yet it wills and toils, strives and suffers, and\r\nsometimes seems more advanced than will be the being produced from it!\r\nSo much industry and skill imprisoned in a skin which will immediately\r\ndry up and be blown away by the breeze!\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, it is seized one morning by an undefinable kind of\r\nirritability and disquiet,--by a mysterious impulse which excites it\r\nto undertake a new task. You would say that within itself another self\r\nexists, moving, and stirring, and following up a distinct purpose, and\r\nyearning to become--what? does it know? This I cannot assert; but after\r\nawhile you may see it acting, and acting sagaciously, as if inspired by\r\na perfect knowledge. Its presentiment of the slumber which will shortly\r\nseize upon it, paralyze its forces, and surrender it helplessly to all\r\nits enemies, incites it to the sudden display of a novel activity. \"Let\r\nus work well! Let us work quickly! For soon I shall sleep soundly.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VI.--THE MUMMY, NYMPH, OR CHRYSALIS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE MUMMY, NYMPH, OR CHRYSALIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us respect the childhood of the world. Let us pardon the early ages\r\nfor the consolations and hopes which they drew from the strange drama\r\nrepresented by the Insect, the thoughts of immortality which grave\r\nEgypt founded upon it. This drama tranquillized more hearts and wiped\r\naway more tears than all the mysteries of Canopus or the revels of\r\nEleusis.\r\n\r\nWhen the mourning widow, the eternal Isis, ever reproducing herself in\r\neternal anguish, was snatched from her beloved Osiris, she reposed her\r\nhope of a future reunion on the sacred beetle, and hushed her sobs.\r\n\r\nWhat is death? What is life? What is the awakening, or what the\r\nslumber? Do you not see this little miracle, this dumb confidant of\r\nthe grave, which makes us the mock of destiny? It sleeps in the egg,\r\nand afterwards sleeps again in the nymph. It is thrice born; and it\r\ndies thrice--as larva, nymph, and beetle. In each of these existences\r\nthe larva or mask is the prefigurement of the succeeding existence. It\r\nprepares, begets, and hatches itself. From the most repulsive sepulchre\r\nit emerges sparkling. On the dust it shines; on the gray Egyptian\r\nplain, in its season of aridity, it shimmers, and eclipses everything.\r\nIts jewelled wing mirrors the all-powerful sun.\r\n\r\nWhere was it? In the foul shadow, in night and death. A deity has\r\nsummoned it forth, and will yet do much more for this beloved soul!\r\nSweet, tender ray! The hope was surely founded upon justice, on the\r\nimpartial love of the Creator of all life.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the widow draws from its death the brilliant pledge of the\r\nfuture, and gives utterance to this woman's cry:--\"Merciful Heaven!\r\ndo for my husband and for me what thou hast done for the insect. Do\r\nnot grant less to man; do not grant to my best-beloved less than thou\r\naccordest to this brother of the gnat!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHas modern science swept away the ancient poesy? Has it completely\r\neliminated the miraculous from nature?\r\n\r\nThe inaugurator of this science, Swammerdam, has discovered that the\r\ngrub already contains the nymph; nay more, even the butterfly. In the\r\ngrub he has detected the rudiment of the wing and proboscis of the\r\nfuture being.\r\n\r\nThis is not all. Malpighi saw the _nymph_ of the silkworm in its\r\nvirgin slumber, _already furnished with the attributes of its coming\r\nmaternity_,--containing the eggs which, as a butterfly, it would\r\nfecundate.\r\n\r\nAnd yet again, this is not all. Réaumur, in the oak-grub, _in a grub\r\nscarcely a few hours old, found the eggs of the future butterfly_.\r\nIn other words, the infant insect, at that very stage when the grub\r\nitself, as Harvey points out, is simply a mobile egg, already possesses\r\neggs and children.\r\n\r\nIt is the identity of three beings. It seems as if there could be no\r\nintermediary deaths; one single life is continuously carried on.\r\n\r\nAll this seems clear, does it not? The ancient mystery has perished?\r\nMan has discovered, in its fulness, the secret of things?\r\n\r\nRéaumur does not think so; Réaumur himself, who has guided us so\r\nfar. In recording his observations he does not appear satisfied, and\r\nconfesses \"that they still leave very much to be desired.\"[I]\r\n\r\n[Footnote I: Réaumur, \"Histoire des Insectes,\" tome i., p. 351.]\r\n\r\nIn truth, it is a thing to confound and almost to terrify the\r\nimagination, to think that a grub, at the outset no bigger than a\r\nthread, should include in itself all the elements of its moultings and\r\nmetamorphoses; should contain its triple, and even octuple envelopes;\r\nnay more, the sheath or case of its _nympha_ and its complete\r\nbutterfly, all folded up one in another, with an immense apparatus\r\nof vessels, respiratory and digestive, of nerves for feeling and\r\nmuscles for moving! A prodigious system of anatomy! first traced out\r\nin complete detail in Lyonnet's colossal work on the willow-grub. The\r\ntwofold monster, endowed with a strong grub-stomach for the destruction\r\nof innumerable hard leaves, will possess ere long a light and delicate\r\napparatus for extracting the honey of flowers. And yet the clothed\r\ncreature, which contains in its organism a complete silk-manufactory,\r\nwill almost immediately sweep away the complex system.\r\n\r\nOne knows the gentle manoeuvres by which nature conducts the young of\r\nthe higher animals from the embryonic existence to the independent\r\nlife, adapting the old organs to new functions. Here, this is not\r\ndone. It is not a simple change of condition. The destination is not\r\nmerely different, but contrary, with a violent contrast. Therefore,\r\ninstruments fitted for an entirely novel existence are required, and\r\nthe abolition and definitive sacrifice of the primitive organism.\r\n\r\nThe revolution, which for all other beings is so well concealed, is\r\nhere entirely thrown open. And we are enabled to scrutinize with our\r\neyes this astonishing _tour de force_ in numerous grubs which undergo\r\nthe great change in the light of day, suspended to the branch of a tree\r\nby a silken cable.\r\n\r\nThe effort is worthy of our admiration and pity. To see yonder\r\nnymph, short and feeble, soft and gelatinous, without arms or paws,\r\ncontriving, by the skill with which it expands and contracts its\r\nrings, to escape from the heavy and rough machine which it was at\r\nfirst, flinging aside its limbs, setting free its head, and--one hardly\r\ndares to record the fact--throwing off its body, and rejecting many of\r\nits principal internal organs!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis little body, when it has thus escaped from its long heavy mask\r\n(living, nevertheless, but a moment since, a life full of energy), will\r\ndangle, and grow dry, and skilfully ascend to its silken fastening.\r\nThere it prepares to fix itself in its new \"Me\" as a nymph, while its\r\nformer \"Me,\" tossed about by the wind, is speedily driven I know not\r\nwhither.\r\n\r\nAll is, and ought to be, changed. _The legs will not again be the\r\nlegs._ It will need lighter organs. What can the child of the air,\r\nwhich can balance on the point of a blade of grass, do with those\r\ncoarse short feet, armed with hooks, vent-holes, and so many heavy\r\nimplements?\r\n\r\n_The head will not be the head_; at least, the enormous apparatus of\r\nmandibles will disappear, and also that of the muscles by which they\r\nwere energetically moved. All is thrown aside with the mask. A colossal\r\nchange! From a masticator the animal becomes a sucker. A flexible\r\nproboscis emerges.\r\n\r\nIf anything in the grub appeared of a fundamental character, it was the\r\ndigestive apparatus. Ah, well! this basis of its being is no more. The\r\nabsorbing throat--the powerful stomach--the greedy entrails,--all are\r\nsuppressed, or reduced nearly to nothing. What would they avail the\r\nnew being which, in certain species of butterflies, dispenses with\r\nsustenance, has no mouth but by agreement, and is so completely freed\r\nfrom digestion that frequently it has not even an inferior orifice?\r\nIt abandons without difficulty its thenceforth useless furniture, and\r\nexpectorates the skin of its stomach!\r\n\r\nThis is grand and magnificent,--no spectacle is grander! For life\r\nat such a point to change, to dominate over the organs, to rise\r\nvictorious, so entirely free of the ancient _Ego_! To those who have\r\nrevealed to us such a prodigy of transfiguration, from the bottom of my\r\nheart I say, \"Thanks!\"\r\n\r\nHow marvellous the security in this being which abandons everything,\r\nwhich unhesitatingly dismisses its strong and solid existence,\r\nthe complicated organism which just now was _itself_, its own\r\nindividuality! We call it its _larva_, its mask; but why? The\r\npersonality seems at least as energetic in the vigorous grub as in\r\nthe delicate butterfly. And, therefore, it is most indubitably its\r\nindividual being which it courageously leaves to shrivel up and perish,\r\nto become--what? Nothing reassuring, nothing but a little, soft,\r\nwhitish substance.\r\n\r\nOpen the nymph soon after it has spun its cocoon: in its shroud you\r\nshall find nothing but a kind of milky fluid, wherein you see, or\r\nfancy you see, certain dubious lineaments. After awhile you may, with\r\na fine needle, separate these I know not what,--and figure to yourself\r\nthat they are the limbs of the future butterfly. A frightful lacuna!\r\nFor many species a moment occurs when nothing of the old any longer\r\nappears, and nothing of the new as yet has come. When Æson, cut in\r\npieces, was thrown, in order to rejuvenate him, into the caldron of\r\nMedea, you would have found, on groping there, the limbs of Æson. But\r\nhere there is nothing parallel.\r\n\r\nTrustfully, nevertheless, the mummy surrounds its body with its bands,\r\ndocilely accepting the shadows, the inertness, and the captivity of\r\nthe sepulchre. It feels in itself a force, a _raison d'être_, a _causa\r\nvivendi_,--a reason for living still. And what reason? What cause? The\r\nvitality accumulated by its previous toil. All that, like a laborious\r\ngrub, it has accumulated, is its obstacle to death,--its incapability\r\nof perishing,--the reason why it will immediately live again; and not\r\nonly live, but with a light and tender existence, whose facility is\r\nproportioned exactly to the efforts which it makes in its anterior\r\ncondition of life.\r\n\r\nAdmirable compensation! When penetrating so deep down into life, I\r\nexpected to encounter certain physical fatalities. And I found justice,\r\nimmortality, and hope.\r\n\r\nYes, antiquity was right, and modern science is right. It is death, and\r\nyet it is not death; let us call it if you will partial death. Is death\r\never otherwise? Is it not a new birth?\r\n\r\nThroughout my life I have remarked that each day I died and was\r\nborn again; I have undergone many painful strugglings and laborious\r\ntransformations. One more does not astonish me. Many and many times I\r\nhave passed from the larva into the chrysalis, and into a more complete\r\ncondition; the which, after awhile, incomplete under other relations,\r\nhas put me in the way of accomplishing a new circle of metamorphoses.\r\n\r\nAll this from me to me, but not less from _me_ to those who were\r\n_still_ me, who loved me, or made me, or, so long as I lived, whom I\r\nmade. These, too, have been, or will be, my metamorphoses. Sometimes,\r\na certain intonation or gesture which I detect makes me exclaim:--\"Ah!\r\nthis is a gesture or a tone of my father.\" I had not foreseen it,\r\nand if I had foreseen it, it would not have occurred; reflection had\r\nchanged all; but, not thinking of it, I employed it. A tender emotion,\r\na holy impulse seized me, when I felt my father thus living in myself.\r\nAre we two? Were we one? Oh! it was my chrysalis. And I--I play the\r\nsame part for those who shall follow me, my children, or the children\r\nof my thought. I know, I feel, that besides the bases which I derived\r\nfrom my father, my ancestors and masters, besides the inheritance\r\nof artist-historian which I shall bequeath to others, germs existed\r\nwithin me which were never developed. Another, and perchance a better,\r\nman was within me, who has not arisen. Why were not the loftier germs\r\nwhich might have made me great, and the powerful wings of which I have\r\nsometimes felt myself possessed, displayed in life and action?\r\n\r\nThese germs, though put aside, remain to me; too late for expansion in\r\nthis life, perhaps, but in another,--who knows?\r\n\r\nAn ingenious philosopher has remarked that if the human embryo, while\r\nimprisoned in the maternal bosom, might reason, it would say:--\"I see\r\nmyself endowed with organs of which here I can make no use,--limbs\r\nwhich do not move, a stomach and teeth which do not eat. Patience!\r\nthese organs convince me that nature calls me elsewhere; a time will\r\ncome when I shall have another residence, a life in which all these\r\nimplements will find employment. They are standing still, they are\r\nwaiting. I am but the chrysalis of a man!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VII.--THE PHOENIX.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE PHOENIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe drama is complete. From the gray or blackish mummy which just now\r\nlay before you dried and shrivelled, you see the new creature, the\r\nresuscitated, the phoenix, blithely escaping, to shine resplendent in\r\nall the glory of youth.\r\n\r\nThe very reverse of _our_ destiny: commencing with bright and butterfly\r\ndays, in later life we crawl and languish; while the insect commences\r\nwith years of gloom, and from a long life of obscurity emerges into the\r\nyouth in which it dies glorified.\r\n\r\nLet us be present at this departure. The warm breath of spring has\r\nawakened the plants; its banquet is prepared. More than one flower,\r\nawaiting it, secretes its honey. It delays, because to-day that\r\nimpenetrable envelope which ensured its safety becomes for a moment\r\nits obstacle. Enfeebled and fatigued by so great a transformation,\r\nhow shall it break through the too solid cradle which threatens to\r\nsuffocate it?\r\n\r\nSome species--as, for example, the ants--experience so great a\r\ndifficulty, that the captive, probably, would never effect its release\r\nbut for the opportune assistance of some power which, from without,\r\nhastens to extricate it, to deliver it (so to speak), and separate it\r\nfrom the trammels of its swaddling-clothes. Fortunate difficulty! which\r\ncreates the bond between the two ages, attaches the liberator to the\r\nchild she has delivered, and herself begins its education and society!\r\n\r\nBut, for the majority of insects, the liberator is no other than\r\nNature. This mother, inexhaustible in tenderness and invention, gives\r\nto the little one the key which will open the barrier, pierce the\r\nprison, and introduce it to daylight and liberty.\r\n\r\n\"What key?--and how?\" say you. \"How can this soft and fluid being\r\ncontrive to seize upon a firm, compact tissue, frequently doubled and\r\nimmured by the alluvial accumulation of a protracted winter?\"\r\n\r\nThe circumstance embarrasses _us_ greatly, but Nature is not troubled.\r\nMeans of the utmost simplicity suffice her; she eludes, and sports\r\nwith, the difficulty. The butterfly of the silkworm, for instance, at\r\nthe critical moment finds a file--where?--in its eye! This eye, with\r\nnumerous facets, has a fine diamond point, which files through and\r\nsevers the silken prison.\r\n\r\nAnother, the cockchafer, shut up underground, suddenly discovers that\r\nit is a perfect mechanician. Of its whole body it makes a lever. Its\r\nposterior extremity furnishes it with a strong-pointed auger. It sinks\r\nsolidly, anchors, and makes fast. From this _point d'appui_ it derives\r\nan enormous force, and with its robust shoulders uplifts the heavy\r\nclod, enlarges the aperture, finds at length the light, extends its\r\nunwieldy apparatus of wings and wing-cases, and flies as a gnat.\r\n\r\nAnother deformed (or shapeless) miner, the mole-cricket, would never\r\nreach the surface if, to reascend from the depth of the earth, it\r\nhad not two enormous hands, or rather two powerful rakes, which\r\nopen up its way. Though hideous, it is not the less sensitive to the\r\ninfluence of spring, but it takes the precaution of never exposing its\r\nstrange figure save to the doubtful rays of the moon. Its plaintive\r\ncry singularly affects the female; she yields to it, and makes her\r\nappearance, but to return again into the night and confide to the\r\nprotecting shade the hope of her posterity.\r\n\r\nA frail aquatic insect, the gnat, on this important day assumes the\r\ndaring mission of the navigator. It makes fresh use of its demitted\r\nenvelope, and turns it into a bark. In this it stands upright, extends\r\nits new wings for sails, glides along the wave, and very frequently\r\nwithout shipwreck reaches the shore; where, when dried, the same wings\r\nwill bear it off to the chase and the pursuit of pleasure. In an\r\nhour it appears a complete master of all these novel arts. It is the\r\npeculiarity of love to know without having been taught.\r\n\r\nLove is winged. Mythology is perfectly in the right. This is verified\r\nin the proper sense and without metaphor. In one brief moment, Nature\r\ndisplays a restless anxiety to fly towards the beloved object. All\r\ncreatures rise above their own level, all mount towards the light, on\r\nthe pinions of desire. The internal fire is also revealed in glowing\r\ncolours. Every one decorates his person, every one wishes to please.\r\n\r\nThe butterfly apparently looks upon you with the great velvety eyes\r\nwhich adorn its wings. Beetles of every species, like mobile stones,\r\nastonish by their brilliant reflexes, their burning vivacities.\r\nFinally, from the bosom of the shadows bursts the flame of love, naked\r\nand unveiled, in flashing stars!\r\n\r\nAt such a moment it accomplishes the strangest transformations, and\r\nfrom the humblest masks issue, in violent contrast, the superbest\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nA dull larva of the morass, which lives only by stratagem, becomes\r\nthe brilliant amazon, the agile winged warrior, called Demoiselle\r\n(_libellula_). It is the only creature of its tribe which expresses\r\nthe complete liberty of flight, holding the same rank among insects as\r\nthe swallow among birds. Who has not followed with attentive gaze its\r\nthousand varied movements, its turns, and returns, and the infinite\r\ncircles which it makes with azure and emerald wings on the meadow or\r\nover the waters? A flight apparently capricious; but not really so, for\r\nit is a chase, a rapid and elegant extermination of myriads of insects.\r\nWhat seems to you a pastime, is the greedy absorption with which this\r\nbrilliant creature of war feeds its season of love.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDo not believe that these riches are simply the gifts of genial\r\nclimates; that these glittering festal garments which they assume\r\nto love and die in are only the sheen of the sun, the all-powerful,\r\ndecorator, which with its rays intensifies the enamel and gems we\r\nadmire upon their wings. Another sun--a sun which shines for the\r\nwhole earth, even for the ice-regions of the pole--profits them far\r\nmore considerably. It exalts in them the inner life, evokes all their\r\npowers, and, on the given day, calls forth the supreme flower. Yonder\r\nscintillating colours are their visible energies which become speaking\r\nand eloquent. It is the pride of a complete life, which, having\r\nattained its climax, displays its energy in triumph, wishes to expand\r\nand diffuse; it is the tradition of desire, the imperious prayer and\r\nurgent appeal to the beloved objects.\r\n\r\nIn pale and temperate climates, you will meet with those brilliant\r\nliveries which one would think belonged to the tropics. Who, under our\r\ngloomy and variable sky, has not seen the sparkling Spanish fly? Even\r\nin the fatal deserts where summer beams but for an instant, as if in\r\ndespite of the sun,--in despite of the poor and naked earth,--love\r\nsupports some beings of a sumptuous splendour, of opulent raiment and\r\nrich decoration. Miserable Siberia sees the princes and great lords\r\nof the Insect World simultaneously displaying their grandeur. The\r\ntyrannical Russian climate cannot prevent enormous beetles, pitiless\r\nhunters, fiercer than Ivan the Terrible, from appearing in green,\r\nblack, violet, or deep blue morocco, shaded with purple sapphires.\r\nWhile some, usurping the ancient copes consecrated to the czars and the\r\nporphyrogeniti, stalk to and fro in robes of purple, broidered with\r\nByzantine gold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn our neighbouring Siberias, I mean our lofty mountains,--under the\r\nhailstorms, for instance, of the Pyrenean glaciers,--without being\r\ndiscouraged by their rude blows, fly noble insects, of exquisite\r\nappearance, the rosalia in a mantle of pearl-gray satin, spotted with\r\nblack velvet.\r\n\r\nAmong the lofty Alps, at the Grindelwald,--the formidable descent\r\nwhere that glacier comes to us, and you may touch its _aiguilles_,\r\nand its keen breath freezes you--I once admired a timid but touching\r\nprotestation of love. Among some miserable birches, martyr trees, which\r\nundergo an eternal chastisement, a poor little plant, elegant and\r\ndelicate, persists in flowering, with a rose-hued blossom, but a violet\r\nrose, not unworthy of the mournful region. The brother of this tragical\r\nrose is a very tiny insect which, all feeble as it is, mounts higher\r\nthan any other species, and is found shivering among the lofty snows\r\nof Mont Blanc. There, above you, is only the heaven, and, beneath,\r\nthe vast shroud of ice. The poetic creature has assumed exactly two\r\ntints: the celestial blue of its wings, incredibly delicate, seems\r\nlightly kindled with the white powder of the hoar-frost. The storms\r\nand avalanches which overthrow the rocks awaken in it no sensations of\r\nterror. Under the breath of the terrible giant, in his ice-bristling\r\nbeard and formidable frown, it, the little one, flies daringly, as if\r\nconscious that this king of the everlasting winters would hesitate to\r\ndestroy the last winged flower of love which, in his realm of death,\r\npreserves for him a reflection of heaven.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBook the Second.\r\n\r\nMISSION AND ARTS OF THE INSECT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I.--SWAMMERDAM.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nSWAMMERDAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was known of the Infinite prior to 1600? Nothing whatever.\r\nNothing of the infinitely great; nothing of the infinitely little. The\r\ncelebrated page of Pascal, very frequently cited upon this subject, is\r\nthe frank astonishment of a humanity so old and yet so young, which\r\nbegins to be aware of its prodigious ignorance, opens its eyes to the\r\nReal, and awakens between two abysses.\r\n\r\nNo one forgets that in 1610 Galileo, having received from Holland a\r\nmagnifying lens, constructed the telescope, elevated it in position,\r\nand saw the firmament. But it is less generally known that Swammerdam,\r\nseizing, with the instinct of genius, on the imperfect microscope,\r\ndirected it to the lower world, and was the first to detect the living\r\ninfinite, the world of animated atoms! These great men succeeded one\r\nanother. At the epoch of the famous Italian's death (1632) was born the\r\nHollander, the Galileo of the infinitely little (1637).\r\n\r\nAn astounding revolution! The abyss of life was unfolded in its\r\nprofundity with myriads upon myriads of unknown beings and fantastic\r\norganizations of which men had not even dared to dream. But the most\r\nsurprising circumstance is, that the very method of the sciences\r\nunderwent a total change. Hitherto men had relied upon their senses.\r\nThe severest observation invoked their testimony, and they thought that\r\nno appeal could lie from their judgment. But now behold experiment\r\nand the senses themselves, rectified by a powerful auxiliary, confess\r\nthat not only have they concealed from us the greater part of things,\r\nbut that, in those they have laid bare, they have every moment been\r\nmistaken!\r\n\r\nNothing is more curious than to observe the very opposite impressions\r\nproduced by these two revolutions upon their authors. Galileo\r\nbefore the infinite of heaven, where all appeared harmonious and\r\nmarvellously ordered, felt more of joy than of surprise; he announced\r\nhis discoveries to Europe in a style of the greatest enthusiasm.\r\nSwammerdam, before the infinite of the microscopic world, seemed\r\novercome with terror. He recoiled before the spectacle of Nature at\r\nwar, devouring her very self. He grew perturbed; he seemed to fear\r\nthat all his ideas and beliefs would be overthrown: a melancholy and\r\nsingular condition, which, added to his incessant labours, shortened\r\nhis days. Let us pause awhile to dwell upon this creator of science,\r\nwho was also its martyr.\r\n\r\nThe eminent physician Boerhaave, who, a hundred years after\r\nSwammerdam's time, published with pious care his \"Bible of Nature,\"\r\ngave utterance to a surprising observation, which sets one a-dreaming:--\r\n\r\n\"He had an ardent imagination of impassioned melancholy, which raised\r\nhim to the sublime.\"\r\n\r\nThus, this surpassing master in all the works of patient inquiry, this\r\ninsatiable observer of the most minute details, who pursued Nature so\r\nfar into the imperceptible, was a poetic soul, a man of imagination,\r\none of those mournful spirits who groan after nothing less than the\r\ninfinite, and die because they fail to conquer it.\r\n\r\nHis was a remarkable combination of mental endowments which, at the\r\nfirst glance, seem opposed to one another: a love of the great, and\r\na taste for the subtlest researches; a sublimity of aim, and that\r\nobstinacy of analysis which would subdivide the atom, and yet never\r\ncry, \"Hold, enough!\" But, in reality, are these qualities of so\r\ncontradictory a nature? By no means. Men whose hearts are filled with\r\nthe love of Nature will declare that they harmonize admirably. Nothing\r\ngreat and nothing little. For the lover a simple hair is worth as much\r\nas, frequently more than, a world.\r\n\r\nHe was born in a cabinet of natural history; and his birth decided his\r\ndestiny. The cabinet, formed by his father, an apothecary of Amsterdam,\r\nwas a pell-mell, a chaos. The child wished to arrange it, and drew up a\r\ncatalogue of it. A modest ambition led him from point to point, until\r\nhe became the greatest naturalist of the century.\r\n\r\nHis father was one of the zealot collectors who then became common\r\nin Holland--insatiable treasurers of diverse rarities. It was not\r\nwith pictures--though Rembrandt was then in his glory--it was not\r\nwith antiquities, that he filled his house. But all that the ships\r\nbrought back from the two Indies of minerals, plants, fantastic and\r\nextraordinary animals, he acquired at any cost, and heaped up in piles.\r\nThese marvels of the unknown world, contrasting by their splendour and\r\ntropical magnificence with the gloomy climate which received them and\r\nthe pale sea of the North, aroused in the young Hollander's mind a\r\nlively curiosity and a passionate devotion to Nature.\r\n\r\nA very good Dutch painter has drawn a charming picture of the young\r\nGrotius: a universal scholar at twelve years of age, surrounded by\r\nfolios, maps, charts, and all the appliances of learning. How much I\r\nshould have preferred that the same artist--or rather the all-powerful\r\nmagician, Rembrandt--had revealed to us the mysterious study, that\r\nbrilliant chaos of the three kingdoms, and the young Swammerdam\r\nendeavouring to grasp the grand enigma!\r\n\r\nThe crowds and prodigious movement of Amsterdam favoured his solitude.\r\nThe Babylons of commerce are for the thinker profound deserts. In that\r\ndumb ocean of men of mercantile activity, on the border of sluggish\r\ncanals, he lived almost like Robinson Crusoe in his island. Isolated\r\neven in the midst of his family, who could not comprehend him, he\r\nseldom emerged from his cabinet, and descended on the fewest possible\r\noccasions into the paternal shop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHis sole recreation was to go in search of insects in the little soil\r\nwhich Holland offers above the waters. The melancholy meads, covered\r\nwith Paul Potter's herds, possess, in the moist warmth of the summer, a\r\ngreat variety of animal life. The traveller is much impressed when he\r\nsees the crane, the stork, and the crow, elsewhere hostile, reconciled\r\nhere by the abundance of their food, which they frequently hunt in\r\ncompany on terms of perfect accord. Hence the landscape acquires a\r\npeculiar charm. The cattle assume an air of placid security which they\r\ndo not elsewhere exhibit. The summer is short, and early assumes the\r\ngravity of autumn. Man and Nature--all appears of a pacific character,\r\nharmonized in a great moral sweetness and remarkable seriousness of\r\nmood.\r\n\r\nEnthusiastic collector as his father was, he grieved to see the youth\r\nof Swammerdam thus employed. It had been his ambition to make of\r\nhis son a renowned minister who should shine in controversy, and an\r\neloquent preacher. But his son seemed daily to grow more dumb. The\r\nchagrined father lowered his views from glory to money. In that golden\r\ncity, so feverish and so diseased, no career is more lucrative than\r\nthat of a physician. But here arose another difficulty. Swammerdam\r\nthrew himself heartily into his medical studies; but on condition that\r\nhe created them--as yet they did not exist. Therefore, the basis on\r\nwhich he desired to rest them was the preliminary creation of the\r\nnatural sciences. How cure the sick man unless you understood the\r\nhealthy? And how understand the latter without studying side by side\r\nthe inferior animals which translate and explain disease? But can one\r\nsee into such delicate mysteries with the eye alone? Does not the\r\nfeebleness of the sense of vision lead us astray? The serious creation\r\nof science would suppose a reform of our senses and the creation of\r\noptics.\r\n\r\nA veritable creation! Look at the microscope. Is it a simple spy-glass?\r\nTo the eyes which the instrument possessed, Swammerdam added two arms,\r\none of which bears the glass and the other the object. He himself\r\nsays, in reference to his more difficult investigations, \"that he had\r\nattempted to obtain the assistance of another person, but that such\r\nassistance proved, in fact, an obstacle.\" It was for this reason that\r\nhe organized a dumb man of copper, a discreet servant ready for every\r\nwork; thanks to whom the observer disposes of supplementary hands and\r\nnumerous eyes of different degrees of power. In the same manner as the\r\nbirds expand or contract their visual organs, either to grasp objects\r\nin a whole or to scrutinize with searching glance the smallest detail,\r\nSwammerdam created the method of successive enlargement; the art of\r\nemploying lenses of different sizes and varying curvature, which permit\r\nthe observer to see _en masse_, and to study each separate portion, and\r\nfinally to survey the whole for the purpose of properly replacing the\r\ndetails and reconstituting the general harmony.\r\n\r\nWas this all? No. To observe dead bodies, time is required; but then\r\ntime robs us of them. Death, which seemingly conduces to study by its\r\nimmobility, is deceitful; it fixes the mask for a moment, and the\r\nobject beneath melts away. Now came a new creation of Swammerdam's.\r\nHe not only taught us to see and investigate, but he devised means\r\nfor our permanent investigation. By preservative injections he fixed\r\nthese ephemeral objects; he compelled time to halt, and forced death\r\nto endure. The Czar Peter, who, a long time afterwards, saw in the\r\ndissecting-room of one of Swammerdam's disciples the beautiful body,\r\nsupple and fresh, of a little child, with its exquisite carnation tint,\r\nthought that the rose was living, and could not be prevented from\r\nembracing it.\r\n\r\nAll this is soon said; but it was long to do. How many attempts! What\r\nmiracles of patience, of delicacy, of skilful management! In exact\r\nproportion as one descends the scale of littleness, the insufficiency\r\nof our means proves more and more embarrassing. We can touch nothing\r\nwithout breaking it. Our large fingers will hold no more: they cast\r\na shadow, they throw obstacles in our way. Our instruments are too\r\ncoarse to seize upon such atoms; therefore we refine them. But then\r\nhow can we put the invisible point in an invisible object? The two\r\nterms in sight avoid us. Only one single passion--the unconquerable\r\nlove of life and Nature, the undefinable, indescribable tenderness, a\r\nfeminine sensibility directed by a masculine, scientific genius--could\r\nsucceed in so great an aim. Our Hollander loved the tiny creatures. He\r\ndreaded wounding them so much that he spared the scalpel. He avoided\r\nas far as he could the steel, and preferred the firm but nevertheless\r\nthe delicate ivory. He fashioned in it infinitely small instruments,\r\nsharpened by aid of the microscope, which would not work rapidly, and\r\ncompelled the student to make his observations with due patience.\r\n\r\nHis tender respect for Nature found its reward. While still a youth,\r\nand a simple student at Leyden University, he had two strong holds upon\r\nher in her highest and lowest manifestations. He was the first to see\r\nand understand the maternity of the insect and the human maternity.\r\nThe latter subject, so delicate and yet so grand--in which he laboured\r\nconjointly with his master at Leyden--I put aside: let us dwell upon\r\nthe former. He dissected and described the ovaries of the bee: found\r\nthem in the pretended \"king;\" and proved that she was a queen, or\r\nrather a mother. In like manner he explained the maternity of the ant;\r\nan all-important discovery, which revealed the true mystery of the\r\nsuperior insect, and initiated us into the real character of these\r\nsocieties, which are not monarchies, but maternal republics and vast\r\npublic nurseries, each of which raises up a people.\r\n\r\nThe most general fact in the life of insects, and the great law of\r\ntheir existence, is the Metamorphosis. Changes which in other creatures\r\nare obscure, are in them exceedingly conspicuous. The three ages of the\r\ninsect appear to be three creatures. Who would have dared to assert\r\nthat the grub, with its heavy luxuriance of digestive organs and its\r\ngreat hairy feet, was identical with a winged and ethereal being, the\r\nbutterfly?\r\n\r\nHe dared to say, and by the most delicate anatomy he demonstrated, that\r\nthe larva, the pupa, and the butterfly represented three conditions of\r\nthe same individual, three natural and legitimate evolutions of its\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nHow did learned Europe welcome this novel science of metamorphoses?\r\nThat was the question. Swammerdam, young and without authority, without\r\nany position in the academy or university, lived in his cabinet.\r\nScarcely anything of his works was published during his life, nor even\r\nfifty years afterwards, so that his discoveries might circulate and\r\nadvantage all, rather than himself and his fame.\r\n\r\nHolland remained indifferent. Eminent professors in the University of\r\nLeyden were opposed to him; and took umbrage at the fact that a simple\r\nstudent placed himself by his discoveries on a level with them, or even\r\nabove them.\r\n\r\nThe miserable and necessitous condition in which his father left\r\nhim was not calculated to recommend him greatly in a country like\r\nHolland. In his costly labours he was supported by the generosity of\r\nhis friends. At Leyden it was Van Horn, his professor of anatomy, who\r\ndefrayed all his expenses.\r\n\r\nAt this epoch two illustrious academies were founded,--the Royal\r\nSociety of London and the _Académie des Sciences_ of Paris. But the\r\nformer, specially inspired by the genius of Harvey, a pupil of Padua,\r\nturned its gaze towards Italy, and addressed its inquiries to the\r\ndistinguished and very accurate observer, Malpighi, who furnished at\r\nits request the anatomy of the silkworm. I know not why the Englishmen\r\nturned aside from Holland, and did not also interrogate the genius of\r\nSwammerdam.\r\n\r\nHe was honoured only in France. It was here, in the neighbourhood of\r\nParis, that he made the first public demonstration of his discovery.\r\nHis friend Thévenot, the famous traveller and publisher of travels,\r\ncollected around him at Issy different classes of _savants_, linguists,\r\norientalists, and, before all, inquiring students of Nature. Such was\r\nthe origin of the _Académie des Sciences_. One might justly say that\r\nthe revelation of the illustrious Hollander inaugurated its cradle.\r\n\r\nA Frenchman rescued from the hands of the Inquisition the last\r\nmanuscripts of Galileo. A Frenchman also--Thévenot--supported\r\nSwammerdam with his purse and credit. He was desirous of establishing\r\nhim at Paris. On the other hand, the Grand-Duke of Tuscany invited him\r\nto Florence. But the fate of Galileo was too strong a warning. Even in\r\nFrance there was little safety. The mystic Morin was burned at Paris in\r\n1664; the very year in which Molière performed the first acts of his\r\n\"Tartuffe.\" Swammerdam, who was then residing there, might have been\r\npresent at both spectacles.\r\n\r\nHe himself, notwithstanding his positivism, showed very singular\r\ntendencies towards mysticism. The more deeply he entered into details,\r\nthe more eagerly did he long to reascend to the general source of love\r\nand life; an impotent effort which consumed him. Already, at the age of\r\nthirty-two, excessive toil, chagrin, and religious melancholy brought\r\nhim to the grave. From his early years he had suffered from the fevers\r\nso common in Holland, that land of swamp and morass, and had not paid\r\ndue attention to them. He studied with his microscope every day from\r\ndawn till noon; the remainder of the day he wrote. And for his studies\r\nhe preferred the summer days, with their strong light and burning\r\nsunshine. Then he would remain, with his head bare that he might not\r\nlose the smallest ray, frequently until deluged and bathed in sweat.\r\nHis eyesight grew very weak.\r\n\r\nHe was already in a feeble condition when, in 1669, he published in a\r\npreliminary essay the principle of the metamorphosis of insects. He\r\nwas sure of being immortal; but so much the more in danger of dying\r\nof hunger. His father thenceforth withdrew from him all assistance.\r\nSwammerdam by his discoveries (as of the lymphatic vessels and hernias)\r\nhad very considerably promoted the progress of medicine, and even of\r\nsurgery; but he was not a physician. From a spirit of obedience he had\r\nattempted to practise: he could not continue, and fell ill. He was now\r\nwithout a home. His father shut up his house, retired to live with his\r\nson-in-law, and bade Swammerdam provide for himself, and lodge where\r\nhe would. A wealthy friend had often solicited him to reside with him.\r\nWhen expelled from the paternal roof, he made an effort to seek out\r\nthis friend and remind him of his offer; but he remembered it no longer.\r\n\r\nMisfortunes now accumulated upon his head. Poor and infirm, and\r\ndragging himself along the streets of Amsterdam with a large collection\r\nwhich he knew not where to store away, he received another terrible\r\nshock--the ruin of his country. The earth sunk under his feet.\r\n\r\nIt was the fatal year of 1672, when Holland seemed crushed by the\r\ninvasion of Louis XIV. Assuredly his fatherland had not spoiled\r\nSwammerdam; but nevertheless it was the native home of science, of free\r\nreason, the asylum of human thought. And lo! she sank, engulfed by the\r\nhosts of the French; engulfed in the ocean which she had summoned to\r\nher assistance. She lived only by committing suicide. Did she live?\r\nYes; but to be thenceforth no more than the shadow of her former\r\ngreatness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe infinite melancholy of such a change has had its painter and its\r\npoet in Ruysdaël, who was born and who died in Swammerdam's time,\r\nand, like him, at the age of forty. When I contemplate in the Louvre\r\nthe inestimable picture which that Museum possesses of him, the one\r\nleads me to think of the other. The little man who followed the gloomy\r\nroute of the dunes at the approach of the storm reminds me of my\r\ninsect-hunter; and the sublime marine picture of the palisade in the\r\nred-brown waters, chafing so terribly, and electrified by the tempest,\r\nseems a dramatic expression of the moral tempests which poor Swammerdam\r\nexperienced when he wrote \"The Ephemera\"--\"among tears and sobs.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ephemera is the fly which is born but to die, living a single hour\r\nof love.\r\n\r\nBut Swammerdam did not enjoy that hour; and it seems as if he spent\r\nhis too brief life in a state of complete isolation. At the age\r\nof thirty-six he was already drawing near his end. The depths of\r\nimagination and universal tenderness in his nature could not be\r\nalimented by the barren controversies of the age. In this condition\r\nthere accidentally fell into his hand an unknown work,--a woman's\r\nbook. This sweet voice spoke to his very soul, and somewhat consoled\r\nhim. It was one of the _opuscula_ of a celebrated mystic of that age,\r\nMademoiselle Bourignon.\r\n\r\nPoor as was Swammerdam, he undertook a pilgrimage to Germany, where she\r\nresided, and went to see his consoler. He found in the journey a very\r\nreal assistance in escaping at the least from his contention with the\r\n_savants_, his rivals, in forgetting every collision, and in remitting\r\nto God alone his defence and his discoveries.\r\n\r\nHe longed to withdraw himself into a profound solitude. For this\r\npurpose it was necessary he should dispose of the dear and precious\r\ncabinet on which he had spent his days, in which he had enshrined\r\nhis heart, and which had at length become a portion of himself. He\r\nmust tear himself from it. At this cost he calculated that he would\r\nobtain a revenue sufficient for his wants; but the very loss and\r\nseparation he longed for he could not undergo. Neither in Holland nor\r\nin France could buyers be found for the cabinet. Perhaps the wealthy\r\namateurs, who think of nothing but empty _éclat_, did not find in it\r\nthe glittering species which give us a child's pleasure. The great\r\ninventor's collection offered things more serious: the logical order\r\nand arrangement of his discoveries; that eloquent and living method\r\nwhich had guided his genius to new achievements. Alas! it perished,\r\nscattered abroad.\r\n\r\nHaving been for a long time ill, in 1680, either through weakness, or\r\na disgust for life and men, he shut himself up, and would not go out\r\nany more. He bequeathed his manuscripts to his faithful and life-long\r\nfriend, whom, when dying, he himself styled the \"incomparable,\"--the\r\nFrenchman Thévenot. He died aged forty-three.\r\n\r\nWhat really killed him? His own science. The too abrupt revelation\r\nwounded and seized upon him. If Pascal saw an imaginary abyss opening\r\nbefore him, what would happen to this Dutch Pascal, who saw the real\r\nabyss and the limitless profundity of the unexpected world? It was not\r\na matter of a decreasing scale of abstract greatnesses or of inorganic\r\natoms, but of the successive envelopment and prodigious movements of\r\nbeings which are the one in the other. For the little we see, each\r\nanimal is a tiny planet, a small world inhabited by animals still\r\nmore diminutive, which in their turn are inhabited by others very\r\nmuch smaller. And this, too, without end or rest, except from the\r\npowerlessness of our senses and the imperfection of optical science.\r\n\r\nAll men now began to fathom, and incessantly toil in, that infinity\r\nwhich the hand of Swammerdam had opened up to them. From that time\r\nEurope laboured therein with diverse aims. Leuwenhoek, precipitating\r\nhimself upon it, discovered and conquered new worlds. The Italian\r\npositivist, Malpighi, showed perhaps the highest boldness. He proved\r\nthat the insect has a heart--a heart which beats like man's. One has\r\nnot far to go to endow it also with a soul. Swammerdam, who was living\r\nthen, was terrified by the fact. He drew back affrighted from the\r\ndeclivity; he wished to keep his footing, and was fain to doubt the\r\nexistence of the heart.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him that the science to which he had given the first\r\nimpulse, which he had launched on the flood of his discoveries, was\r\nconducting him to something great and terrible which he shrank from\r\nseeing: like one who, adrift on the enormous sea of fresh water which\r\ndashes headlong in the Niagara Falls, perceives himself impelled by a\r\ncalm but invincible and mighty movement--whither? He will not, and he\r\ndare not, think!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: II.--THE MICROSCOPE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE MICROSCOPE:--HAS THE INSECT A PHYSIOGNOMY?\r\n\r\n\r\nArmed with that sixth sense which man has achieved for himself, I can\r\nmove forward, at pleasure, in any direction. It is in my power to track\r\nout, to reach, to compute the spheres, and gravitate with them in\r\ntheir vast orbits. But I feel much more strongly attracted towards the\r\nother abyss--that of the infinitely little. In its atoms I discover an\r\nintensity of energy which charms and astounds me. And I myself, what am\r\nI but an atom? Neither Jupiter nor Sirius, those enormous globes at so\r\ngreat a distance from, and possessing so little sympathy with me, will\r\nteach me the secret of terrestrial life. But these, on the contrary,\r\nsurround and press upon me, injure me or lend me their assistance. If\r\nthey are not of my own kind, they are at all events associated with me.\r\n\r\nAy, fatally associated.\r\n\r\nAnd yet I cannot fly from them: swarms haunt the very air which I\r\nbreathe,--what do I say? float in the fluids of my body. It is my\r\ninterest to know them. But my sovereign interest is to escape from my\r\ndeplorable and wretched ignorance, and not to quit this world until I\r\nhave peered into the infinite.\r\n\r\nFull of such ideas, I addressed myself to one of the philosophers of\r\nthe present day who have made the greatest and most successful use\r\nof the microscope,--the celebrated Dr. Robin. Under his direction, I\r\npurchased from the skilful optician Nachet an excellent instrument, and\r\nplanted myself before my window on a very beautiful day.\r\n\r\nI have said it,--the microscope is much more than a mere magnifying\r\nglass. It is an aid, a servant who has hands to supplement your\r\nown--eyes, and movable eyes, which by their changes enable you to\r\nsee an object at a suitable magnitude, and either in detail or as a\r\nwhole. One perfectly understands the all-absorbing attraction which it\r\nexercises; however great the fatigue it causes, one cannot separate\r\none's-self from it. Its _début_, as we have seen, was signalized by\r\nits slaying its creator, Swammerdam. How many workmen has it not\r\nsince deprived, if not of life, at least of sight? The first of the\r\ntwo Hubers became blind at a comparatively early age. The illustrious\r\nauthor of the great work on the cockchafer, M. Strauss, is nearly so.\r\nOur pallid but enthusiastic Robin is already on the same descent, but\r\npursues his studies without pause. The seduction is too potent. Who can\r\nrenounce the truth, after once beholding it? Who can willingly return\r\ninto the world of errors wherein men exist? Better not to see at all,\r\nthan always to see things falsely.\r\n\r\nBehold me, then, face to face with my little man of copper. I lost not\r\nan instant in interrogating the oracle. And its first and somewhat\r\nrough reply respecting the two objects I presented was:--\r\n\r\nOne was the human hand, white and delicate,--the left hand, the idler,\r\nand that of a person who did no work.\r\n\r\nThe other, a spider's foot.\r\n\r\nTo the naked eye the former object seemed agreeable enough; the other,\r\na tiny, obscure blade, of a dirty brown, and somewhat repulsive.\r\n\r\nIn the microscope the effect was precisely the opposite. In the\r\nspider's foot, easily cleansed of a few downy spots, appeared a\r\nmagnificent comb of the most beautiful shell, which, far from being\r\ndirty, by its extreme polish was rendered incapable of being soiled;\r\neverything glided off it. This object would seem to serve two ends:\r\nthat of a very delicate hand, through which the spinner, in rising or\r\ndescending, suffers its thread to glide; and that of a comb, with which\r\nthe attentive labourer holds its stuff, while at work, in the required\r\nposition, until the woven threads--more like a cloud--grow firm and\r\nstrong, are dried by the air, and no longer fall back floating and\r\nwavy, but useless.\r\n\r\nAs for the human hand, the part exposed under the microscope\r\nseemed, even with the smallest lens, a vague and immense substance,\r\nincomprehensible through its very coarseness.\r\n\r\nEven with a medium lens, of only twelve or fifteen times magnifying\r\npower, it seemed to be a yellowish, reddish tissue, coarse and dry,\r\nill-woven,--a kind of wiry taffeta, in which each mesh was irregularly\r\npuffed up.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more humiliating!\r\n\r\nThis pitiless judge, pitiless even in its treatment of the flowers,\r\nbehaves with terrible severity towards the human flower. The freshest\r\nand most charming will act wisely in not attempting the experiment.\r\nShe would shudder at herself. Her dimples would deepen into abysses!\r\nThe light down of the peach which crowns her beautiful skin with the\r\nbloom of delicacy would show like rough thickets, or rather like savage\r\nforests.\r\n\r\nAfter my first experiment, I felt that the too truthful oracle not\r\nonly altered our ideas of proportion, but of appearances, colours,\r\nforms--transfiguring everything, in fact, from the false to the true.\r\n\r\nLet us be resigned. Whatever the organ of truth may tell us, I thank\r\nit, and I will welcome it though it declare me to be a monster. But\r\nsuch is not the case. If it change with some severity our notions\r\nof the surface, on the other hand it reveals to us worlds of truly\r\nunbounded beauty beneath it. A hundred things in anatomy which seem\r\nhorrible to the unassisted sight, acquire a touching and impressive\r\ndelicacy, and a poetical charm which approaches the sublime. This is\r\nnot the place for discussing such a subject. But a mere drop of blood,\r\nof a brickdust-red by no means agreeable to the naked eye, heavy,\r\nthick, and opaque, if you look at it when dry, under the magnifying\r\nglass, presents to you a delicious rose-bloom arborescence, with\r\ndelicate ramifications as fine and subtle as those of the coral are\r\ncoarse and dull.\r\n\r\nBut let us keep to our insects. Let us select the most miserable--the\r\nwonderfully little butterfly of the clothes-moth, that dirty white\r\nbutterfly which seems the lowest of created beings. Take only his wing.\r\nNay, far less, only a little dust, the light powder which covers his\r\nwing. You are astounded at seeing that Nature, exhausting the most\r\ningenious industry in order that this offcast of creation may fly\r\nat his ease, and without fatigue, has scattered over his wing, not\r\ndust, but a multitude of tiny balloons. Or, if you prefer it, so many\r\nparachutes, most convenient instruments for flight, which, when opened,\r\nsustain the little aeronaut without fatigue and for an indefinite\r\nperiod; which, as they are more or less expanded, enable it to rise or\r\nsink; and when folded up, permit of its remaining quiet. The least of\r\nthe butterflies, thus supported, has a faculty of flight as unlimited\r\nas the noblest bird of heaven.\r\n\r\nOne grows keenly interested in these curious apparatus, which have\r\nanticipated our human inventions. One observes their strange and\r\nsurprising modes of action, as one would observe the inhabitants of\r\nanother planet, if he were miraculously transported thither. But what\r\none most yearns to see, what one burns to detect, is some reflection\r\nfrom _within_, some gleam of the torch which is concealed in their\r\ninner existence, some appearance of thought. Have they a physiognomy?\r\nCan I seize in their strange visage any trace of an intelligence which,\r\njudging by their works, so closely resembles our own? Of the expression\r\nwhich touches me in the eye of the dog, and of other animals related\r\nto me, shall I detect nothing in the bee, the ant, in those ingenious\r\nbeings, those creators, which accomplish so many things the dog cannot\r\naccomplish?\r\n\r\nA clever man once said to me: \"As a boy I was very partial to insects;\r\nI searched about for caterpillars, and made a collection of them. I\r\nwas especially curious to look in their faces, but never succeeded.\r\nAll that I could distinguish was confused, dull, melancholy. This\r\ndiscouraged me. I left off making collections.\"\r\n\r\nI was but a child in this new study; that is, I was fresh to it, and\r\ncurious. My special anxiety was to interrogate the countenance of the\r\ndumb little world, and to surprise there, in default of voice, the\r\nsilent thought. Thought? At least, the dream, the obscure and floating\r\ninstinct.\r\n\r\nI addressed myself to the ant; an humble being in form and colour,\r\nbut endowed with a prodigious amount of social instinct and of the\r\neducational capacity; not to speak of its quickness of resource, of\r\nthe promptitude with which it confronts perils, and chances, and\r\nembarrassments.\r\n\r\nI take then an ant of the commonest species--a neutral ant--one of the\r\nworkers who are relieved from the wants of love, and in whom therefore\r\nthe sex, diminished to a minimum for the advantage of labour, develops\r\nso much more powerfully its extraordinary instinct; who alone perform\r\nall the diverse trades of the little community, and are purveyors,\r\nnurses, architects, and inventors.\r\n\r\nI selected a very fine, serene, and luminous day--not luminous with the\r\nglare of summer, but the calm radiance of autumn (1st September 1856).\r\nI was alone, in a state of perfect silence and repose, and in that\r\ncomplete forgetfulness of the world which is so rarely obtained. After\r\nthe manifold agitations of the past and present, my heart for a moment\r\nwas at peace.\r\n\r\nNever was I more ready to hear the mute voices which do not address\r\nthemselves to the ear, to penetrate in a calm and benevolent spirit\r\nthe mystery of the little world which on every side surrounds us,\r\nand yet has hitherto remained out of our reach and apart from our\r\ncommunications.\r\n\r\nAlone with my ant, armed with a tolerably good lens, with a magnifying\r\npower of twelve, I placed it delicately on a large sheet of fine white\r\npaper which covered nearly the whole table.\r\n\r\nWith the microscope I could have seen but a part and not the whole. A\r\nvery considerable enlargement would also have exaggerated the merely\r\nsecondary details--such as the scanty hairs with which the ant is\r\nprovided. Finally, its mobility would not have suffered me to keep it\r\nin the focus of the microscope; but the lens, as easily shifted as\r\nitself, followed it in all its motions.\r\n\r\nNot, however, without some difficulty. It was lively, alert,\r\ndisquieted, and impatient to quit the table. I was looking at it in\r\nthe middle of the sheet, when it was already nearly at the edge. I was\r\nobliged to _etherize_ it a little, so as to stupefy it, and render it\r\nless uneasy.\r\n\r\nIt appeared very clean, and highly varnished. Though a neuter, and\r\nnot a female, its belly was rather large, and was joined to the chest\r\nby two small swellings. From the chest the head, which was strong and\r\nnearly round, detached itself cleanly and distinctly.\r\n\r\nThis head, seen as it were _en masse_, resembled a bird's. But instead\r\nof a beak it had a circular prolongation, in which, on attentive\r\nexamination, I detected the reunion of two tiny crescents joined at\r\nthe point. These were its teeth, or mandibles, which do not operate\r\nlike ours, from above to below, but horizontally and sideways. The\r\ninsect employs its mandibles for the most widely different purposes;\r\nthey are not only its weapons and instruments of mastication, but the\r\ntools it uses for every art, supplying the place of hands in masonry,\r\nplastering, carving, and in lifting and transplanting burdens which are\r\nfrequently of enormous weight.\r\n\r\nIt was well for it that its body was wrapped in a complete coat of\r\nmail. The ether affected it but slightly, and only stupefied it. After\r\na moment's immobility it partly recovered, and made a few movements\r\nlike those of an intoxicated person, or as if it were affected with a\r\nfit of vertigo. It seemed to say, \"Where am I?\" and endeavoured to make\r\nout the ground where it was walking, the great sheet of white paper. It\r\nattempted a few tottering steps, tumbling first on one side and then on\r\nthe other. It carried before it a couple of instruments which at first\r\nI took to be feet, but which I found, on more careful inspection, were\r\nwholly different.\r\n\r\nThey sprang from a point near either eye, and, like the eyes, were\r\nevidently instruments of observation. These antennæ, as they are\r\ncalled, long, delicate, yet robust, and vibrating at the slightest\r\ntouch, are fleshy, articulated in twenty pieces, and disposed one\r\nin another. They form an instrument admirably adapted for feeling\r\nand groping. But it is useful in many other ways: by means of it the\r\nants transmit in a second very complicated advices, as, for instance,\r\nwhen they change their course and retire, or suddenly take a wholly\r\ndifferent road; evidently they have a language like that of the\r\ntelegraph. This supposed marvellous organ of touch is more probably\r\na species of hearing apparatus, and so mobile that it quivers at the\r\nslightest vibrations of the air, and feels every wave of sound.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe perfect accord of every movement of the delicate and subtle tactile\r\nand telegraphic apparatus, the strong head, in fine, which seemingly\r\n_thinks_, completed the illusion. Its attitudes, its gropings, its\r\nefforts to obtain a knowledge of the situation, showed precisely\r\nwhat we should have been under similar circumstances. Shakespeare's\r\nQueen Mab, in her nut-shell chariot, occurred to my mind. And more,\r\nthe chronicles of the Hubers; those impressive and almost terrifying\r\nnarratives which would lead us to believe that the ants are far\r\nadvanced in a knowledge of good and evil.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt turned its back upon me obstinately, as if it dreaded to see its\r\npersecutor. It looked upon me as a horrible giant, and, despite its\r\nsemi-intoxicated condition, made constant and energetic efforts to\r\nescape me, and place itself in security.\r\n\r\nI brought it back very softly and cautiously. But I could not make\r\nit show me its face. Its antipathy and its terror, undoubtedly, were\r\ntoo powerful. I therefore decided to take hold of it with a small\r\npair of pincers, and to keep it on its back, using as little pressure\r\nas possible. The pressure, though light, acting on the small lateral\r\norifices (or stigmata) through which it breathes, was infinitely\r\npainful, to judge from the resistance it offered. With its minute claws\r\nand mandibles it held the pincers so firmly that I could hear the air\r\nvibrate with every motion. I hastily profited by the painful position\r\nin which I had placed my ant; I looked it in the face.\r\n\r\nThat which is most disconcerting, and gives it a peculiar appearance,\r\nare the teeth or mandibles placed outside the mouth, and springing, one\r\non the right side, the other on the left, in a horizontal direction, so\r\nas to meet together: ours are vertical. These projecting teeth seem to\r\noffer battle, though, as I have said, they are also used for pacific\r\npurposes, and _serve as hands_.\r\n\r\nBehind the teeth may be seen several little threads or palpi at the\r\nentrance of the mouth; which are, in reality, the _little hands of the\r\nmouth_,--feeling, and handling, and turning over whatever is brought\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nIn front emerge the antennæ, the _other_ hands; but these are set\r\nexternally, are mobile and susceptible to an excess,--in a word,\r\n_electric hands_.\r\n\r\nBehind the head, at the chest, commence the paws or feet, two in front\r\nof great dexterity, and rightly named by Kirby the arms.\r\n\r\nAn apparatus of such complexity, placed in the fore part of the body,\r\ncannot fail to obscure and overcloud its physiognomy. What would be the\r\ncase with our own, if from our eyes and mouth six hands started, to say\r\nnothing of those which proceed from the shoulders, and of four others\r\nplaced lower down?\r\n\r\nThe whole is intended for action and defence. The face which the insect\r\nshows is its resisting skull, its bony case, which cannot move. This\r\nframes, encloses, and fixes the eyes, which are also immovable; but,\r\nbeing exterior and multiple, motion is not necessary: those of the ant\r\nare divided into fifty facets, which reveal everything to it either\r\nin front or rear. Thus, then, its sight is admirable, but it cannot\r\n_look_. No external muscle sets the mask in motion. And, therefore, it\r\nhas no physiognomy.\r\n\r\nBut, in compensation, its pantomime was extremely expressive,--I may\r\neven say, very pathetic. On discovering that it was so feeble and\r\nincapable of walking, it did exactly what prudent and sagacious man\r\nwould have done, and attempted to recover its energies by the very\r\nmeans which we should have employed. It commenced a methodical friction\r\nof its entire body, from above to below. Seated like a little monkey,\r\nit skilfully made use of its arms or anterior feet in such a manner as\r\nto rub its back and side. Occasionally it returned to its head, took\r\nit between its two hands, as if it would fain have shaken it clear of\r\nthe fatal intoxication which rendered it so little able to provide\r\nfor its own safety. One would have said it was questioning itself,\r\ncollecting its thoughts, and saying, as we do after a bad dream, \"Is it\r\ntrue, or is it false?--Poor head!--Alas! what ails thee, then?\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment I felt that we were living in two worlds, and that there\r\nwere no means of understanding each other. How could I reassure it? My\r\nlanguage, that of the voice; its, that of the antennæ. Not one of my\r\nwords could obtain access to the electric telegraph which served as its\r\norgan of hearing.\r\n\r\nThe continuous bony case which envelops its body isolates the insect\r\nfrom us, and conceals us from the insect. It has a heart which beats\r\nlike ours; but we cannot see its pulsations beneath its thick coat of\r\nmail. It does not even command that wordless language which touches us\r\nin so many dumb beings. It is wholly wrapped up in mystery and silence.\r\n\r\nIt breathes, or rather imbibes air, through the sides, not through the\r\nface or head. No palpitation or respiratory movement can be detected in\r\nit. Therefore, how should it speak, how complain? Of all our languages\r\nit has not one; it makes a sound, but does not possess a voice.\r\n\r\nIs the fixed and immovable mask, thus condemned to perpetual silence,\r\nthat of a monster or a spectre? No. After watching its movements,\r\nits numerous actions indicative of reflection, its arts so much more\r\nadvanced than those of the larger animals, we are not unwilling to\r\nbelieve that in this head exists a personality. And from the highest to\r\nthe lowest in the scale of life, we recognize the identity of the soul.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: III.--THE INSECT, THE AGENT OF NATURE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE INSECT AS THE AGENT OF NATURE IN THE ACCELERATION OF DEATH AND LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe insect has not my languages. He neither speaks by voice nor\r\nphysiognomy. In what manner, then, does he express himself?\r\n\r\nHe speaks by his energies.\r\n\r\n1st. By the immense destructive influence he exercises on the\r\nsuperabundance of Nature, on a swarm of lingering or morbid lives which\r\nhe hastens to sweep away.\r\n\r\n2nd. He speaks also by his visible energies, especially in the moment\r\nof love, his colours, his fires, his poisons (many of which are among\r\nour therapeutic agents).\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n3rd. He speaks by his arts, which might fecundate our human inventions.\r\n\r\nThis is the subject of our second book.\r\n\r\nLet us first attack the point where he wounds us most, and seems\r\nthe auxiliary of death: his immense, ardent, and indefatigable work\r\nof destruction. Let us contemplate him in history, and begin at the\r\nremotest epoch.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn answer to our littlenesses, our disgusts, our terrors, to the narrow\r\nand egotistical judgments which we bring to bear upon such subjects, we\r\nmust recall the great and necessary reactions of Nature.\r\n\r\nIt has not advanced with the order of a continuous flood, but with\r\nrefluxes and recoils back upon itself, which have enabled it to compass\r\na perfect harmony. Our short-sighted survey, frequently arrested by\r\nthese apparently retrograde movements, grows alarmed, takes fright, and\r\nmisconceives the character of the whole.\r\n\r\nIt is peculiar to the Infinite Love, which is continuously creating, to\r\nraise every created thing to the Infinite. But in this very infinity,\r\nit stimulates a creation of antagonisms which shall reduce the extent\r\nof the preceding. If we see it produce monstrous destroyers, be sure\r\nthat they are destined, as a remedy and a repression, to check some\r\nmonsters of fecundity.\r\n\r\nThe herbivorous insects have had the task of keeping under the alarming\r\nvegetable accumulations of the primeval world.\r\n\r\nBut these herbivora exceeding all law and all reason, the insectivorous\r\ninsects were created to confine them within limits.\r\n\r\nThe latter, robust and terrible, the tyrants of creation by their\r\nweapons and their wings, would have been the conquerors of the\r\nconquerors, and have driven to extremities the feebler species, if,\r\nabove all the insect world and its weak powers of flight, had not risen\r\non mighty wing a superior tyrant--the Bird. The haughty libellula was\r\ncarried off by the swallow.\r\n\r\nBy these successive agencies of destruction, however, production has\r\nnot been suppressed, but restrained, and the species balanced in such\r\nwise that all endure and live. The more a species is pruned, the more\r\nfertile it becomes. Does it exceed? Immediately the superabundance is\r\nequilibrized by the new fecundity which is given to its destroyers.\r\n\r\nYe men of this lingering epoch,--sons of the lean and sober\r\nWest--brought up in the little, close, carefully tended, pared, and\r\npicked gardens, which you call \"wide cultivation,\"--enlarge, I pray\r\nyou, your conceptions; extend them, and endeavour to imagine something\r\ngreater than these petty corners, if you would comprehend anything of\r\nthe earth's primitive forces; of the abundance and superabundance which\r\nshe displayed when, soaked with warm mists, her bosom heaved with the\r\nglow of her first youth.\r\n\r\nThe hotter countries of our present globe still show something of this\r\nprofusion, though in a pale decay. Africa, which over the greater\r\nportion of its area has lost its waters, preserves as a souvenir in\r\nits happier zones that enormous and swollen herb, or herbaceous tree,\r\nthe baobab. The inextricable forests of Guiana and Brazil, in their\r\nlabyrinthine chaotic confusion of wild plants which, without rule or\r\nmeasure, envelop and choke the colossal trees, corrupt them, and bury\r\nthem in their _débris_, are but imperfect images of the great ancient\r\nChaos. The only beings impure enough to endure its impurity and breathe\r\nits deadly exhalations, are great-bellied reptiles, unwieldy frogs,\r\ngreen caymans, and serpents swollen with filth and venom. And such\r\nwould have been the inhabitants of earth. Unable to draw breath in the\r\nhorrible suffocation, she could never have given forth that pure air in\r\nwhich man alone can live.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, from on high pounced down the bird, and, plunging into the\r\ngulf, carried back to the sky on the tops of the lofty forests some\r\none of these monsters. But its incessant struggle would have been vain\r\nagainst their abominable fecundity, if, from below, myriads of nibblers\r\nhad not lightened the accumulation, cleansed the frightful lairs, and\r\nthrown open to the arrows of the sun the filth under which earth was\r\npanting. The humblest insects accomplished the gigantic work which made\r\nearth inhabitable: they devoured chaos.\r\n\r\n\"Small means,\" you say, \"and great results! How could these little\r\nbeings come to the aid of an infinity?\" You would not cherish the\r\ndoubt, if you had been ever a witness of the awakening of the\r\nsilkworms, when, one morning, they are hatched with that vast hunger\r\nno abundance of leaves can satisfy. Their proprietor has supposed\r\nhimself in a position to content them with a rich and beautiful\r\nplantation of mulberry-trees; but it counts for nothing. You supply\r\nthem with forests, and they still ask for more. At a distance of twenty\r\nor thirty yards you hear a strange uninterrupted buzzing; a murmur\r\nlike that of brooks incessantly flowing, and incessantly grinding\r\nand wearing out the pebbles. Nor are you mistaken: it is a brook, a\r\ntorrent, a boundless river of living matter, which, under the grand\r\nmechanism of so many minute instruments, sounds, and resounds, and\r\nmurmurs, passing from the vegetable life to that of insects, and softly\r\nbut invincibly bases itself on animality.\r\n\r\nTo return to the primeval age. The most terrible destroyers, the most\r\nimplacable assailants, which penetrated the lowermost rottenness of\r\nthe great chaos, which at a higher level delivered the tree from the\r\npressure of its parasites, and finally mounted to its branches, and\r\nbrightened up the livid shadows,--these were the benefactors of species\r\nyet to come. Their uninterrupted work of unconquerable destruction\r\nreduced within reasonable limits the excess in which Nature was almost\r\nlost. They opened up splendid, free, and unencumbered spaces; and the\r\nmonsters, banished from the gulf where they swarmed, grew more and more\r\nbarren, and by that great revelation of the forest were exposed to the\r\nchild of Light,--the Bird.\r\n\r\nA profound agreement and genial fellowship were established between\r\nthe latter and his protagonist, the child of Night, the Insect, which\r\nhad thrown open the abyss, and delivered into his power the enemy.\r\nConsider, moreover, that in proportion as an exuberant nourishment\r\nfortified and exalted the insect, when its blood was intoxicated by so\r\nmany burning plants, a ferocity previously unknown prevailed, and the\r\nfiercer and bolder species no longer limited themselves to undermining\r\nthe _retreats_ of the monsters, but attacked the _monsters_ also.\r\nStings, augers, cupping-glasses, trenchant teeth, sharpened pincers, an\r\narsenal of unknown and as yet unnamed arms, came into existence, were\r\nelongated and whetted for assault upon the living matter. They were\r\nneeded. They proved to be the lancet which cut the putrescent sore of\r\nthe rising world. This latter had nourished and multiplied the feebly\r\nanimalized myriads of torpid worms and pale-blooded larvæ, a ghastly\r\nand also the lowest life, which gained by passing through that burning\r\ncrucible of keen existence, the superior insect-race.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI know nothing upon earth which seems stronger, firmer, more durable,\r\nand more formidable than those miniature rhinoceros-like cuirassiers,\r\nwhich traverse earth as quickly as the great mammal traverses it\r\nheavily and slowly. The carabi, the galeritas, the stag-beetles,\r\nwhich carry with so much ease armour far more formidable than that\r\nof the Middle Ages, reassure us only by their size. Here strength is\r\nrelatively formidable. Were a man proportionally strong, he might take\r\nin his arms the obelisk of Luxor.\r\n\r\nVast energies of absorption, concentrating in these insects enormous\r\nfoci of forces, translated themselves into the light by the energies of\r\ncolour. To these, in species where life was more elevated, succeeded\r\nthe moral energies. The superbly barbarous heroes, the _scarabæi_, were\r\nexterminated by the modest citizen-species, the ants and bees, in which\r\nthe secret of beauty was harmony.\r\n\r\nSuch is the whole history of insects. But to whatever height our\r\ninquiries may conduct us, let us not mistake the point of departure,\r\n--the useful nibblers and miners, which have elaborated and prepared\r\nthe globe.\r\n\r\nIs their work terminated? By no means. Immense zones remain in what\r\nmay still be called an ancient condition, condemned to a terrible and\r\nunwholesome fecundity. In the centre of America the richest forests of\r\nthe world seem ever to repel the approach of man, who enters them only\r\nto die. His arms, enfeebled by fever, have not even strength enough to\r\ncollect their treasures. If a tree fall across his path, it becomes an\r\ninsurmountable obstacle to the indifferent adventurer. He turns aside,\r\nand you may trace his circuit through the tall herbage. Fortunately\r\nthe termites do not recoil so easily. If they find themselves\r\nconfronted by a tree, they do not avoid it, do not turn its flank.\r\nThey attack it bravely in the front, set to work as many labourers as\r\nare necessary--millions, perhaps: in two or three days the tree is\r\ndevoured, and the road open.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe great law of nature, and in these countries the law of safety, is\r\nthe rapid destruction of everything decaying, languishing, stagnant,\r\nand therefore injurious; its ardent purification in the crucible of\r\nlife. And that crucible is, before all things, the insect. We must not\r\nblame its fury of absorption. Who thinks of accusing the flame? The\r\nflame is worthy of reproach only when it does not burn. And, in like\r\nmanner, that living fire, the insect, is created to devour. Necessity\r\ndemands that it should be eager, cruel, blind, and of an implacable\r\nappetite. It can have no sobriety, no moderation, no pity. All the\r\nvirtues of man and of superior beings would be nonsense which one\r\ncannot even imagine. Can you conceive of an insect with the sensibility\r\nand tenderness of the dog? which should weep like the beaver? which\r\nshould nourish the aspirations and poetry of the nightingale? or,\r\nfinally, the compassionateness of man? Such an insect would be\r\nincapable; thoroughly unfit for its profession as the anatomist,\r\ndissector, and destroyer--we may say, more justly, the universal medium\r\nof nature, which, precipitating death by suppressing long periods of\r\ndecay, in this way accelerates the brilliant return of life. Thus\r\ndisembarrassed and free, it says, with a savage pleasure, \"No maladies,\r\nno old age! Shame upon all decay! Hail to eternal youth! Let every\r\ncreature die which lives beyond a day!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nObserve that the furious eagerness of the winged insects, which seem to\r\nbe the agents of death, is frequently a cause of life. By an incessant\r\npersecution of the sick flocks, enfeebled by hot damp airs, they ensure\r\ntheir safety. Otherwise they would remain stupidly resigned, and hour\r\nafter hour grow less capable of motion, gloomier and more morbid in\r\nthe bonds of fever, until they could rise no more. The inexorable spur\r\nknows, however, the secret of putting them on their legs; though with\r\ntrembling limbs, they take to flight; the insect never quits them,\r\npresses them, urges them, and conducts them, bleeding, to the wholesome\r\nregions of the dry lands and the living waters, where, growing\r\ndiscontented, their furious guide abandons them, and returns to the\r\npestilent vapours, to its realm of death.\r\n\r\nIn the Soudan, in Africa, a little insect, the Nâm fly, directs\r\nwith a sovereign authority the migrations of the flocks. In the dry\r\nseason it rages against the camel; it audaciously ventures into the\r\near of the elephant. The giant is resistlessly driven forward by its\r\nwinged shepherds, to escape the fires of the south, and to seek the\r\nfresh winds of the north. On the other hand, the oxen, through its\r\nmanagement, remain with their Arab master peacefully in the genial\r\nsouthern pastures.\r\n\r\nThe most terrible of insects--the great Guiana ants--are valued\r\nprecisely for their devouring power. Without them, no effectual means\r\nwould exist of thoroughly cleansing the homes of man of all the\r\nobscure broods which infest the shadows, and swarm in the timbers and\r\nframework, in the most imperceptible crevices. One morning the black\r\narmy appears at the door of the house: an army of sanitary inspectors.\r\nMan retires, gives place to them, and evacuates his dwelling. \"Enter,\r\nladies; come and go at your pleasure; make yourselves quite at home.\"\r\nIt would not be safe for the owner to remain, since it is a law with\r\nthese scrupulous visitors to leave no living thing in the track of\r\ntheir march. In the first place, every insect,--the largest as well as\r\nthe minutest,--and their eggs, however well-concealed, perish. Then the\r\nsmaller animals--frogs, adders, field-mice;--none escape. The place\r\nis thoroughly cleansed, for the smallest remains are conscientiously\r\ndevoured.\r\n\r\nThe great spiders of the Antilles, without piquing themselves on\r\naccomplishing a work of purification so terrible and so complete,\r\nlabour nevertheless very industriously to secure the cleanliness of\r\nhuman habitations. They will not suffer any disgusting insect to exist.\r\nThey are excellent servants--much cleaner than the slaves. Therefore\r\nmen value them, and purchase them as indispensable domestics. Markets\r\nexist where spiders are regularly bought and sold.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Siberia, the spider enjoys the consideration to which it can\r\neverywhere put forward so many claims. That region of the farthest\r\nNorth, whose very brief summer is not the less infested with gnats and\r\nflies, finds a benefactor in the useful insect which industriously\r\nhunts the swarms for man's advantage. Its consummate prudence, its\r\nsuperior ability, its prescience of atmospheric variations and climatic\r\nphases, have so exalted the idea which the Siberians have formed of it,\r\nthat many of their tribes refer the creation of the world to a gigantic\r\nspider.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IV.--THE INSECT AS MAN'S AUXILIARY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE INSECT AS MAN'S AUXILIARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nA hunter of small birds, in an ingenious academical memoir, gives\r\nutterance to the following paradox: \"Their recent multiplication is the\r\ncause of the disease in the vine and the potato.\"\r\n\r\nHow should this be? The disease, which first broke out in September\r\n1845, is produced, says the author, by microscopic animalcules and\r\nparasitical vegetation previously destroyed by the insects. But these\r\ninsect-protectors of agriculture perished, devoured by birds, in 1844.\r\nThe fatal law passed in the May of that year, for the protection of the\r\nbirds, must have multiplied them to such a degree, that the insects,\r\ndriven out and destroyed by them, could no longer afford to our plants\r\nthe succour which defended them against their invisible enemies.\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis, supported with much wit and ability, and apparently\r\ngrounded on facts and dates, rests wholly on one basis, and if it\r\nfails, crumbles to the ground.\r\n\r\nIt supposes that the birds have been efficaciously protected by the\r\nlaw, and that, in twelve years, they have been so able to multiply as\r\nto become masters of the field, the tyrants and exterminators of the\r\nuseful insect-species, and that, in fine, the latter have unfortunately\r\nalmost disappeared.\r\n\r\nTo this three replies may be given:--\r\n\r\n1st. The birds have _not_ multiplied. We must not go for the truth\r\nto the _Bulletin des Lois_ (the Statute-book), but to fowlers and\r\nbird-catchers. And they reply:--\"So many birds have been destroyed\r\nsince the enactment of the law for their benefit, that in certain\r\ncountries sport has actually become impossible, because there are no\r\nmore to kill.\"\r\n\r\nIn Provence, in the very localities where the gnats are insupportable\r\n(and the birds, therefore, most precious),--in the Camargue,--the\r\nsportsmen, in default of edible birds, now kill the swallows. They\r\nplace themselves on the watch at the points where the winged legions\r\npass in files, and slaughter several victims at one discharge.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n2nd. The insects have by no means been destroyed by the birds. Ask\r\nof the agriculturists what species has disappeared. Let them search\r\never so keenly, and they will not find that a solitary species has\r\ndiminished. On the contrary, in the years referred to we have seen them\r\nincrease, and grow, and flourish, and nothing prevents them from making\r\nwar at their pleasure on the invisible animalcules.\r\n\r\nNot an insect-species is wanting; but, on the contrary, some careful\r\nobservers tell us, in their books on Hunting or Natural History, that\r\nnumerous species of birds will soon become extinct.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n3rd. Birds are not, as the author of the memoir calls them,\r\n\"unintelligent assassins.\" Far from this, they kill by preference\r\nthe most injurious insects. The time at which they carry on a really\r\nmurderous war is when they are feeding their young. But what do they\r\nfeed them with? With very few insectivorous insects; the latter, armed\r\nand mailed--carabi and stag-beetles--covered with metallic scales,\r\nequipped with hooks and pincers, of an indestructible vitality, would\r\nbe a horrible food for the young of the warbler, who, before such a\r\nprovision, would assuredly take to flight. This is not the kind of\r\naliment the sagacious mother seeks for her offspring; but soft and, as\r\nit were, milky insects, fat and succulent larvæ, fine little tender\r\ncaterpillars,--all herbivorous, fructivorous, and leguminivorous\r\nanimals; exactly those which do the greatest mischief in our fields and\r\ngardens.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the great labour of the bird against the insect precisely\r\ncoincides with the labour of the husbandman.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, we are far from saying, as the author referred to makes\r\nus say, that the bird is the sole purifier of creation. One must be\r\nblind, and indeed senseless, not to see that he shares this mission\r\nwith the insect. The action, too, of the latter is undoubtedly more\r\nefficacious in the pursuit of a world of living atoms, which the\r\ninsect, whose eyes are microscopes, detects and pounces upon in\r\nnumerous obscure corners, inaccessible to the bird. The bird, on\r\nthe other hand, is the essential purifier of everything demanding\r\nlong-sightedness and the power of flight,--as, for example, the\r\nfrightful clouds of invisible animalcules which float and swim in the\r\nair, and therefore pass into our lungs.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the equilibrium of species is desirable. All are more or\r\nless useful. We willingly join with the author of the paper referred\r\nto in the wish that those insects which prey upon the smaller species\r\nmight be specially distinguished and spared. The peasant destroys them\r\nindiscriminately, without knowing that by killing, for instance, the\r\ndragon-fly (or _libellula_)--the brilliant murderess which slays a\r\nthousand insects daily--he is helping the latter: becomes the auxiliary\r\nof the insects, the preserver and propagator of the enemies which\r\ndevour his substance. The terrible cicindela does not fly so high, but\r\nwith its crossed daggers, or rather the two scimitars which serve it\r\nfor jaws, accomplishes a swift and almost incredible havoc among the\r\nsmaller insects. Take care, then, and respect it. Do not listen to\r\nthe child who is dazzled by the beauty of its wings, nor, to please\r\nhim, impale on the needle-point your admirable insect-hunter, the\r\nefficacious auxiliary of the agriculturist!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe carabi,--immense warrior-tribes armed to the very teeth, and\r\ndisplaying an ardent activity beneath their heavy coats of mail,--are\r\nthe true guardians of your fields; and day and night, without holiday\r\nor repose, protect your crops. They themselves never touch the smallest\r\nblade or seed. Their sole occupation is to capture thieves, and they\r\nask for no other reward than the thieves' bodies.\r\n\r\nOthers toil underground. The innocent lobworm, which pierces and\r\nstirs up the soil, gets ready in a marvellously excellent manner the\r\nmuddy and clayey earths which are deficient in evaporation. Others,\r\nin company with the mole, hunt far down in the depths the cruel enemy\r\nof agriculture, the horribly voracious larva of the destructive\r\ncockchafer, which, for three years, has been preying on the roots\r\nbeneath the surface.\r\n\r\nThe insectivorous insects put forth undeniable claims to the protection\r\nof man, whose allies they are. But even among the herbivora there are\r\nuseful destroyers of harmful plants. The useless, pungent, and in every\r\nsense disagreeable nettle, which scarcely a single quadruped will deign\r\nto touch, fifty species of insects, in fellowship with ourselves,\r\nlabour to destroy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA very beautiful class of insects, some rich in outward garb, and\r\nothers in intelligence, are the _Necrophori_, which render us the\r\nimportant service of clearing away all dead matter from the soil.\r\nNature, which finds them so useful, has treated them truly as her\r\nfavourites, honouring them with splendid costumes, and making them both\r\nindustrious and ingenious in the discharge of their functions. It is a\r\nremarkable circumstance that, notwithstanding their sinister office,\r\nthey are far from being wild, but are very sociable if the need arises,\r\nand understand how to unite their forces, combine their energies, and\r\nact in concert. In brief,--these honest undertakers and grave-diggers\r\nare the brilliant aristocracy of the insect nation.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that Nature's ideas are not the same as ours. She loads\r\nthe most useful with rewards, whatever the nature of their work. For\r\ninstance, the _Geotrupes_, which clears away the dung, is clothed in\r\nsapphire in payment of its service. The celebrated _Coleopteron_ of\r\nEgypt, the sacred _Ateuchus_ of the tombs,[J] appears glorified with an\r\nemerald aureola.\r\n\r\n[Footnote J: The _Ateuchus sacer_, or Sacred Scarabæus of the\r\nEgyptians.]\r\n\r\nWho shall describe all the services rendered by these scavengers? Yet\r\nwe are not just in our dealings with them. It happened to me, one\r\nApril, when I was about to transplant to my garden some dahlias which\r\nhad passed the winter in the orchard, to discover that the humidity of\r\nthe air of Nantes, and the compact and imporous clayey soil, had rotted\r\nthe tubers. A bevy of insects were at work upon them, and usefully\r\nengaged in purging this shocking centre of dissolution. The gardener\r\nwas very indignant, and ready enough to accuse them of the evil which\r\nthey were endeavouring to remedy.\r\n\r\nThe enemy of damp gardens, the snail (_Helix_), is pursued by an\r\ninsect,[K] the _Drylus_, which lies in wait for it, and, the better\r\nto hunt it up, mounts on its back, and makes it carry him, seizes a\r\nfavourable opportunity, and on the snail re-entering its shell, enters\r\nalso, lives with it and upon it. A snail lasts him about a fortnight.\r\nThen he passes on to another and a larger, and then to a third still\r\nlarger. He requires three in all. In the third, as he is about to\r\nchange into a pupa, the drylus makes the place clean, and, to sleep\r\nconveniently, seizes on the substantial house of the enemy which has\r\nnourished him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote K: The larva of the _Drylus flavescens_.]\r\n\r\nThere could be no more useful task than to enlighten the peasant\r\non the distinction that ought to be made between insects useful to\r\nagriculture and insects which are noxious; or those which may be turned\r\nto advantage in various sciences,--and especially in Chemistry,--which,\r\nit is probable, will yet discover unexpected resources in beings\r\nendowed with so copious and intense a vitality. In this respect, a\r\nvery honourable work of initiation has been undertaken by the eminent\r\nnaturalist who has so skilfully organized the museum at Rouen. All his\r\npupils have preserved a grateful recollection of their teacher; and\r\nit is to one of them I owe the following summary of an original and\r\ninstructive lecture on the Insect as Food.\r\n\r\n     \"A prejudice much to be regretted, and a ridiculous\r\n     fastidiousness, has debarred our Western peoples from one of the\r\n     richest and most exquisite sources of nourishment. What right\r\n     have they who devour tainted game, and unclean birds,--what right\r\n     have the lovers of the oyster, that slimy mollusc, to reject the\r\n     nourishment supplied by the Insect World?\r\n\r\n     \"Burgundy has the good sense to profit, without any feeling\r\n     of silly disgust, by the excellent mollusc which peoples its\r\n     vineyards,--I mean the snail,--which is very good with butter and\r\n     salads, and a dish as wholesome for the chest as it is agreeable\r\n     to the mouth and profitable to the stomach.\r\n\r\n     \"A celebrated _savant_--Lalande--dared to take a step further in\r\n     advance, and to venture upon the caterpillar, rising thus another\r\n     step above our prejudices. It is to him we owe our knowledge of\r\n     the fact that the caterpillar tastes like almonds, and the spider\r\n     like hazel-nuts. He addicted himself to the latter, which he found\r\n     more delicate.\"--I should think so. In every sense, the spider is\r\n     a superior being.\r\n\r\n     \"Many insects are so nutritious and savoury that they have been\r\n     specially selected by ladies as a diet likely to renew their life,\r\n     beauty, and youth. The Romans of the Later Empire recovered the\r\n     ample outlines of the Cornelias of the Commonwealth by the use of\r\n     the _Cossus_.[L] The sultanas of the East, of those voluptuous\r\n     lands where love seeks the rounded, swelling figure, make their\r\n     slaves bring them a supply of _Blaps_,[M] and idling in their\r\n     gardens, to the music of leaping fountains, imbibe from the\r\n     succulent insect an eternal youthfulness.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote L: The Goat-Moth Caterpillar.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote M: The women of Egypt, it is said, eat the _Blaps\r\n     sulcata_ cooked with butter.]\r\n\r\n     \"In Brazil, the Portuguese extracts from the Malalis of the\r\n     bamboo, when the tree wears its nuptial flower, a kind of fresh\r\n     butter for the table; and eats the ants in sweetmeats, at the\r\n     moment that their wings uplift them on the breeze like an\r\n     aspiration of love.\r\n\r\n     \"But generally the insect, apart from its real value, has been\r\n     hunted by the peasants whose tillage it destroyed. It plundered\r\n     them of their food, and, in revenge, they themselves have fed\r\n     upon _it_. The terrible locust, whose vast increase has so often\r\n     imperilled the East, has been, on that very account, the more\r\n     eagerly pursued and devoured by the Orientals. The story runs that\r\n     the Caliph Omar, when seated at his family table, observing a\r\n     locust alight there, read inscribed upon its wing:--'We hatch nine\r\n     and ninety eggs; if we laid a hundred, we should devastate the\r\n     world.'\r\n\r\n     \"Fortunately the locust is the manna of Asia. Who does not know\r\n     that the prophets, musing in the caves of Carmel, ate nothing\r\n     else? The Mohammedan anchorites adopted the same _régime_. One day\r\n     a person said to Omar:--'What think you of locusts?' 'That I would\r\n     fain have a basketful.' Soon afterwards the supply failed him. It\r\n     was with difficulty his servant found a single insect; whereupon\r\n     he, delighted and grateful, exclaimed, 'Allah is great!'\r\n\r\n     \"Even at the present day locusts are sold throughout the East,\r\n     and are eaten in the café as a dessert and a delicacy. Ships are\r\n     loaded with them, and they are bought and sold by the cask.\r\n\r\n     \"Here, then, we have insects exceptionally nutritious and\r\n     substantial. What prevents us from making use of them? What\r\n     scruple hinders us from active and useful reprisals against them?\"\r\n\r\nAt this part of his discourse, the orator found his audience,\r\nconsisting mainly of intelligent Norman peasants, wrapped in deep\r\nattention, as at those points of the debates of the British Parliament\r\nwhen the accustomed cry arises of \"Hear! Hear!\"\r\n\r\nHe had foreseen such a moment; and having loaded his table with some of\r\nthe insects most dreaded by agriculturists, he seized them, crunched\r\nthem, and swallowed them gravely, with this strong speech, which will\r\nnot be without fruit:--\"They have eaten us: let us eat them!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: V.--A PHANTASMAGORIA OF LIGHT AND COLOUR.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nA PHANTASMAGORIA OF LIGHT AND COLOUR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the insect does not and will not speak to us, are we to suppose that\r\nit does not express the burning intensity of the life within it?\r\n\r\nNo living creature reveals itself more clearly; though only from itself\r\nto its kind, from insect to insect. They are bound up in themselves;\r\nare a sealed world, which has no outward expression, and no language\r\nexcept for its own members.\r\n\r\nFor all ordinary purposes, an electric telegraph exists in their\r\nantennæ. But the great, the eloquent language is manifested among\r\nthem towards the close of their existence,--for one brief moment, it\r\nis true,--a moment announcing the approach of death, yet the grand\r\nfestival of love.\r\n\r\nThey speak through the rare attractions with which they are\r\ninvested,--through the wing, the flight, the airy existence,--through\r\nthe fancy which possesses them (says good Du Tertre) of becoming\r\nbirds. They speak through their brilliant hieroglyphics of colours and\r\nfantastic designs, their strange coquetry of extraordinary toilets.\r\nThey speak in their very lustre, and some species reveal their inner\r\nflame by a visible torch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThey lavish with royal magnificence their last days. And wherefore\r\nshould they economize, when to-morrow they die? Break forth then, O\r\nlife of splendour! Sparkle, ye gold and emeralds, and sapphires and\r\nrubies! And let that incandescent ardour, that torrent of existence,\r\nthat cataract of profuse radiance, be poured out in one common, rapid\r\nflood!\r\n\r\nThere is not space in our museums for the proper display of the\r\nprodigious, the unbounded variety of decoration with which Nature\r\nhas, mother-like, sought to glorify the hymeneal of the insect and\r\nto emparadise its nuptials. A distinguished amateur having had the\r\npatience to show me in due succession genus after genus, species after\r\nspecies, the whole of his immense collection, I was astounded--in\r\ntruth, I was stupefied--almost terrified by the inexhaustible energy--I\r\nwas going to say fury--of invention which Nature displayed. I was\r\novercome--I closed my eyes, and begged for a truce; my brain was\r\ndizzied and blinded, and became confused. But she, she would not\r\nlet me go; she inundated and overwhelmed me with beautiful beings,\r\nwith fantastic beings, with admirable monsters, with wings of fire,\r\nand cuirasses of emerald, clad in a hundred kinds of enamel, armed\r\nwith singular apparatus--no less brilliant than formidable; some in\r\nembrowned steel, shot with yellow--others in silken hoods, embroidered\r\nwith black velvet; these with fine dashes of tawny silk on a rich\r\nmahogany ground; those in pomegranate-coloured velvet lit up with gold;\r\nothers in luminous, indescribable azures, relieved by jet-black beads;\r\nand others, again, bright in metallic streaks alternating with heavy\r\nvelvet.\r\n\r\nIt was as if they wished to say:--\r\n\r\n\"We in ourselves are the whole of Nature. If she perishes, we shall\r\nenact a drama, and personate all her creations. For if you look for\r\nrich furry garb, behold us here in mantles such as a Russian czarina\r\nnever wore. Do you wish for feathers? behold us radiant in plumage\r\nwhich the humming-bird cannot equal; or if you prefer leaves, we can\r\nimitate them so as to deceive your eye. Even wood--in fact, all kinds\r\nof substances--there is nothing which we cannot imitate. Take, I pray\r\nyou, this little twig, and hold it in your hand,--it is an insect!\"\r\n\r\nThen I was fairly conquered. I made a humble reverence to a people so\r\nredoubtable; with a burning brain I issued from the magic cave; and\r\nfor a long time afterwards the sparkling scintillating masks danced\r\nand whirled around me, pursuing me, and maintaining on my retina their\r\nwild, strange revel.\r\n\r\nAnd yet I had seen them only in cases and in boxes, as dead as\r\nin nature they were ardent and restless. What would have been my\r\nimpression if I had seen them alive, and in motion,--especially in the\r\nburning climes where they abound and superabound,--where everything is\r\nin harmony with them,--where the air, the water, the flora, impregnated\r\nwith prolific flames, rival the keen ardour of the animal hosts in the\r\nmadness of love, of production precipitated and incessantly renewed by\r\nimpatient death?\r\n\r\nThe American forests of Brazil and Guiana are the formidable furnaces\r\nin which the great exchange of life is uninterruptedly carried on. The\r\nfantastic faëry of the vegetable kingdom is in accord with that of the\r\nanimated forces. Savage, harsh, and plaintive cries--not songs--form\r\nthe woodland concert. Strange voices of birds, in the woods and the\r\nsavannahs, relieve each other,--hoarse and vibrating, but regular,\r\nas if to mark the hours. They are the clock of the desert. Some by\r\nday, others by night; and perfectly distinct also at each of the three\r\nperiods of the day,--morn, and noon, and evening. They disquiet the\r\ntraveller, inasmuch as they reproduce our human voices or sounds, and\r\nseem ironical or mocking. One cries, another whistles, another sighs.\r\nThis strikes like an alarm, that like a hammer, while a third imitates\r\nthe tones of a bagpipe. The vast plains re-echo the mighty voice of the\r\ncariama. And that of the serpent-conqueror, the courageous kamichi,\r\nharsh and strong, echoing over the marshes, makes the savage tremble,\r\nfor he thinks he hears the spirits passing.\r\n\r\nAt evening, with the song of the grasshoppers, the croaking of the\r\nfrogs, the shriek of the owls, and the lamentations of the vampires,\r\nmingles the howl of the apes; until a hiss, which seems drawn from a\r\nwounded bosom, silences all, and spreads a universal terror, because it\r\nindicates the presence of the sharp-clawed prowler, the swift jaguar.\r\n\r\nIn these forests there is nothing to reassure you. Yonder green and\r\npeaceful waters, whence ever and anon proceeds the sound of half-choked\r\nsighs,--you place your foot upon them, and with terror discover that\r\nthey are solid! that the surface is composed of great alligators, with\r\ntheir greenish backs resembling breadths of moss or aquatic herbs! Let\r\na living creature appear, and immediately they raise their heads and\r\nput themselves in motion; you behold the strange assemblage rise from\r\nthe slime in all their horror! But is this all?--Even these monsters\r\nwhich reign on the surface have their tyrants over them. The piranha,\r\nor razor-fish, as swift as the cayman is unwieldy, severs with its\r\nsaw-like teeth the latter's tail, and carries it off before it can\r\nwheel round. The cayman, nearly always, mutilated in this manner, would\r\nperish, if its cuirass did not prevent its enemy from dissecting it.\r\nThe same terrible anatomist, with a flash of its scalpel, cuts down as\r\nit passes the bird which skims the waves. Aquatic birds which have been\r\nwounded by it are frequently caught. And what, then, of the quadrupeds?\r\nThe most powerful are devoured. A horrible combat is waged without\r\npause in the deep waters,--in the waters living and overflowing with\r\nlife, but with death also,--where is realized to the letter a rapid\r\nand furious suicide of Nature,--Nature devouring in order to re-create\r\nitself!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe insects in fury and beauty are worthy of this scene. The exalted\r\nvitality, revealed among the gadflies and the mosquitoes, by their\r\nthirst of blood, is shown in other species by their enchanting colours,\r\ntheir caprices of design, their singularities of form, which either\r\nastonish us or terrify. The _Buprestis imperialis_, proud of its green\r\ncuirass powdered all over with dust of gold, seems to have passed\r\nthrough the bowels of the metalliferous earth, and enriched itself on\r\nthe way. The _Buprestis chrysochlorus_, of a yellower green, flutters\r\nto and fro like a mounted gem. The _Arlequin_ of Guiana,--a gigantic\r\nmower, armed with tremendous antennæ and prodigious legs to traverse\r\nthe innumerable obstacles offered by the tall herbage,--is marked with\r\nblack commas on a yellow ground, with inexplicable hieroglyphs,--a\r\nbeing doubly strange and doubly enigmatic. It singularly reminds us\r\nof the texture of Indian stuffs, where, for the sake of harmonizing\r\ncolours not usually brought side by side, the artist traces a number of\r\nwavy and broken lines, which soften and blend them into complete accord.\r\n\r\nThose gentle and social insects, the butterflies, covering the\r\nbanks with their winged tribes, transform the whole prairie into an\r\nenchanting flowery carpet. The butterfly of butterflies, the glorious\r\nbutterfly of Brazil, of a rich azure lit up by shifting gleams, softly\r\nhovers, in the warm hours, above the waters crowned by the imperial\r\ndome of the blossomy forests. A pacific and splendid creature, it seems\r\nthe innocent king of all the puissant nature. Others, scarcely less\r\nbeautiful, follow in its train; and ever and ever more the glorious\r\nhost, in floating azure, follows the current of the stream.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, are the tongues of Love; for the boundless rainbow of all\r\nthese colours is simply its varied expression. And for what purpose, if\r\nlove itself ought to appear without an intermediary?\r\n\r\nAlready, in our colder lands, the timid glow-worm, motionless under the\r\nhedgerow, suffers its little lamp to shine and guide through the night\r\nthe lover to his love.\r\n\r\nIn Italy it moves to and fro, and its flame has acquired wings. I was\r\nmuch struck by it, at the hot springs of Acqui, in Piedmont, where\r\nsulphur everywhere prevails; the wild dance of the tiny lights seemed\r\nstimulated by the fires lurking in the entrails of the earth. In Brazil\r\nthe very leaves overflow with phosphorus. How should aught be wanting\r\nfor the illumination of the bridal-joy of the insect? That marvel,\r\nunder the tropics, glitters everywhere and enchants everything. Two\r\nhundred species are known, which Nature has gifted with the poetic\r\nfaculty of breathing forth flame, and charming their great festival\r\nwith the poesy of light.\r\n\r\nA graceful German lady, Mademoiselle Mérian, having been transplanted\r\nto these zones of fire, has related in naïve language the alarm which\r\nshe experienced on seeing their insect wonders. The daughter and\r\ngrand-daughter of excellent and laborious engravers, herself an artist\r\nand of well-informed mind, she has produced, in Latin, Dutch, and\r\nFrench, an admirable and picturesque work on the Insects of Surinam.\r\nThe learned lady, in an exemplary life of misfortunes and virtues, had\r\nbut one weakness (who has not one?)--the love of Nature. She quitted\r\nGermany for Holland, attracted by its unique and brilliant collections\r\nof the treasures of the two worlds. Then, as these did not suffice her,\r\nshe visited Guiana, where she painted for several years. She combined\r\nin the same picture,--an excellent method,--the insect, the plant on\r\nwhich it lives, and the reptile which lives on the insect. Thoroughly\r\nconscientious, she sought out and posed her formidable models, of\r\nwhich, nevertheless, she was much afraid. Once, when the Indian savages\r\nhad brought her a basket of insects, she was sleeping after her work.\r\nBut in her chaste slumber she was disturbed by a strange dream. She\r\nthought she heard a harp, a melody of love. The melody grew inflamed;\r\nit was no longer a song, but an intoxication. All the room seemed\r\nfilled with fire. She woke, and found her dream was true. The basket\r\nwas the lyre, the basket was the volcano. She quickly saw that the\r\nvolcano did not burn. The captives were fire-flies (_fulgores_); their\r\nsong was an epithalamium, and their flame the flame of love.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the tropical countries the stranger generally travels by night to\r\navoid the heat. But he would not dare to enter the populous shadows of\r\nthe forest-depths, were he not reassured by the luminous insects which\r\nhe sees dancing and fluttering in the distance, and anon planted on\r\nthe neighbouring bushes. He takes them for his companions, and fixes\r\nthem in his shoes, partly to show him the path, and partly to keep off\r\nserpents. And when the morning breaks, he gratefully and carefully\r\nreplaces them among the thickets, and restores them to their amorous\r\nwork. There is a pretty Indian proverb: \"Carry away the fire-fly, but\r\nreturn it to the place from which thou carriedst it.\"\r\n\r\nWho can fail to be affected by their flame? It follows the movement\r\nof life, it flares and wanes in cadence with the ebb and flow of our\r\nrespiration; it beats in exact accord with the rhythm of our heart. It\r\nexpands or contracts in harmony with it, and the trouble of its emotion\r\nagitates also that tremendous torch.\r\n\r\nWhat lies at the bottom? the visible desire, the effort to please and\r\nto be loved, translated in a hundred different manners by the eloquence\r\nof light. One, of an unrivalled blue, with a head of rubies, outvies\r\nwith its scintillation the red-hot coal. Another, of a more melancholy\r\ncast, plunges into a sombre red. A third, of flame-coloured yellow,\r\nfading and passing into green, seems to express the languors, swoons,\r\nand storms of the violent loves of the South.\r\n\r\nThe ardent daughter of Spain, rendered more impassioned by the American\r\nsky, puts her hand on the creature of the flame, and seizes upon it as\r\nher own. She makes it a talisman, a jewel, and a victim. Burning, she\r\nplaces it on her burning bosom, where it must soon perish.\r\n\r\nThere is no purpose to which she does not turn it. By a triumph of\r\naudacious coquetry, linking the insects with silk, or imprisoning them\r\nin gauze, she wreathes the animated flames in glowing necklaces, and\r\nrolls them around her waist in girdles of fire. The queens of the ball\r\nare crowned with an infernal diadem of living topazes, of throbbing\r\nemeralds, which flicker or gleam (through suffering or love?). A\r\nbrilliant but funereal decoration, of sinister magnetism, whose charm\r\nis enhanced by a sentiment of death. They dance; the waning flame\r\nassociates its tender gleams with the languishing glances of a deep\r\nblack eye. They dance; without end and without reason, without pity or\r\nremembrance of the amorous light dying and fading on their bosom, and\r\nhaving no power to say: \"Replace me where you captured me!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VI.--THE SILKWORM.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE SILKWORM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The ideal of the human arts of spinning and weaving,\"--said to me one\r\nday a Southerner (a manufacturer, but a man of imagination),--\"the\r\nideal which we always follow is a woman's beautiful hair! Oh, how far\r\nare the softest wools or finest cotton from approaching it! At what an\r\nenormous distance does all, and ever will all, our progress leave us!\r\nWe drag ourselves onward, a long, long way in the rear, and enviously\r\nregard that supreme perfection which Nature daily realizes as a mere\r\nmatter of pastime.\r\n\r\n\"That delicate, yet strong and tenacious hair, vibrating with an\r\nexquisite sonority which goes from the ear to the heart, and yet withal\r\nso soft, warm, luminous, and electrical--is the flower of the human\r\nflower.\r\n\r\n\"Men fruitlessly dispute respecting the merits of colour. What does\r\nit matter? The brilliant black contains and promises the flame; the\r\nblonde displays it with the splendours of the Golden Fleece. The sunny\r\nbrown appropriates the very sun, makes use of it, blends it with its\r\nmirages, floats, and undulates, and incessantly varies in its streaming\r\nreflexes, now smiles with light, now deepens into gloom, always\r\ndeceives, and, whatever we may say, deceives us most delightfully.\r\n\r\n\"The principal, the infinite effort of human industry, has combined\r\nall possible means for the improvement of cotton. Between the Vosges\r\nand the Rhine, the rare agreement of capital, machinery, the arts of\r\ndesign, and the chemical sciences, has produced those splendid Indian\r\nproducts of Alsace, to which England herself does honour by purchasing\r\nthem. Alas! all this cannot disguise the original poverty of the\r\nungrateful tissue which men have so richly embellished. If the woman\r\nwho in her vanity clothes her form in these materials, and thinks\r\nher beauty heightened by them, would loosen her tresses about her,\r\nand unroll their waves over the indigent richness of our most sheeny\r\ncottons, what would occur? How they would be humiliated!\r\n\r\n\"Sir, we must own the truth; there is only one thing worthy of being\r\nplaced side by side with woman's hair. Only one manufacturer can\r\ncontend against it. That manufacturer is an insect,--the modest\r\nsilkworm.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA peculiar charm attends the labours of the silkworm; it ennobles\r\neverything which surrounds it. In traversing our rudest provinces,\r\nthe valleys of the Ardèche, where all is rocky,--where the mulberry\r\nand the chestnut seem to dispense with earth, to live upon air and\r\npebbles,--where low stone houses sadden the eyes by their gray\r\ntints,--everywhere I saw at the door, under a kind of arcade, two\r\nor three charming brunettes, with ivory teeth, who smiled on the\r\nwayfarer, and continued spinning their silken gold. The wayfarer said\r\nto them in a low voice, as the carriage bore him away:--\"What a pity,\r\ninnocent fairies, that the gold may not be for you! That instead of\r\nbeing disguised with a useless colour, and disfigured by art, it does\r\nnot retain its natural hue, and shine on the person of its beautiful\r\nspinners! How much better the royal tissue would become you than the\r\n_grandes dames_!\"\r\n\r\nA mere glance at the silkworm convinces you that it is no more a native\r\nof Europe than any other sweet thing. All that is soft and exquisite\r\nsprings from the East. Our West, that hardy soldier, blacksmith,\r\nand miner, is good only to dig. It is good mother Asia, disdained by\r\nher rude son, who has bestowed upon him the treasures which seem to\r\nconcentrate the essence of the globe. With the Arab horse and the\r\nnightingale, she has given him coffee, and sugar, and silk,--the\r\nrevivifiers of existence and the true ornament of love.\r\n\r\nWhen silk first arrived at Rome, the empresses felt that previously\r\nthey had been no better than plebeians. They compared it, as far as its\r\nsoft lustre was concerned, to the pearls of the Orient, paying for it,\r\nwithout haggling, the price of pearls and gold.\r\n\r\nChina esteemed it of such high value, that, to preserve the monopoly,\r\nshe inflicted the penalty of death on any persons who dared to export\r\nthe silkworm. It was only at the utmost peril, and by concealing it in\r\na hollow cane, that men succeeded in carrying it to Byzantium, whence\r\nit passed to the West.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Age, the age of indigence and barren disputes, when\r\nwool was the luxury of the rich, and the poor wore serge in winter,\r\nno attention was paid to silk, and its manufacture was exclusively\r\nconfined to Italy.\r\n\r\nIt is the gold of the silkworms of Verona which, in Giorgione, at the\r\nmighty outcome of the Venetian art, and in the strong Titian, the\r\nmaster of masters, enriches with a ruddy radiance their beautiful\r\nblondes and brunettes, the sovereign beauties of the world.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in an age of decadence, when Spain and Flanders had\r\nwaned, the melancholy artist who preferred to paint the beauty which\r\nyears had marked,--the fading flower,--the fruit too early pierced\r\nand unnaturally ripened,--Van Dyck, clothed with white silk, like a\r\nconsoling beam of moonlight, his languishing and drooping signoras.\r\nUnder the soft folds of their satins they still trouble hearts with\r\nvain dreams and regrets.\r\n\r\nThe woman who possessed the secret of preserving her charms to the\r\nlast decline of old age, whose cypher everywhere inscribed teaches\r\nus that Love can conquer Time, Diana de Poitiers, in her profound\r\nart, did exactly the opposite of what our imprudent ladies do, who,\r\nincessantly changing, as if to amuse the passer-by, leave no trace\r\nupon the soul, and produce no permanent impression. She permitted the\r\nIrises to delectate themselves with their fugitive rainbow; but, like\r\nthe celestial Dian, always wore the same costume, black or white, and\r\ninvariably of silk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt was to please her that Henry II. wore the first pair of silk\r\nstockings, and the fine silken close-fitting vest, which indicated\r\nall the gracefulness of a muscular yet slender figure. We know\r\nhow ardent an enthusiasm Henry IV., at a later period, showed in\r\npromoting the growth of the silk-manufacture, planting mulberry-trees\r\neverywhere,--along the highways, in the market-places, in the courts of\r\nhis palaces, and even in the gardens of the Tuileries. Coloured silks,\r\nfor decoration and furniture, and silks with flowered designs, were\r\nsoon afterwards manufactured at Lyons, which provided all Europe with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nShall I say it, however? These coloured and ornamented silks do not\r\nby any means produce a great and profound effect. Silk in its natural\r\nstate, and not even tinted, is in much more intimate sympathy with\r\nwoman and beauty. Amber and pearls, the latter slightly yellow, with\r\nrich falls of lace, the latter not too yellow, are the only suitable\r\naccompaniments of silk.\r\n\r\nFor silk is a noble and in nowise pretentious attire, which lends\r\na subdued charm to the exuberant liveliness of youth, and clothes\r\ndeclining beauty with its most tender and touching radiance.\r\n\r\nA genuine mystery attends it which is not without attraction. Colour\r\nor gloss? Cotton has its peculiar gloss, and, when fitly prepared,\r\noften acquires an agreeable freshness. Silk is not properly glossy, but\r\nluminous,--with a soft electrical light, which harmonizes naturally\r\nwith the electricity of the woman. A living tissue, it embraces\r\nwillingly the living person.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOriental ladies, before they foolishly adopted our Western customs,\r\nwore but two kinds of stuff: underneath, the real cashmere (of so fine\r\na texture that a large shawl might be passed through a ring); and\r\nabove, a beautiful tunic of silk of a pale blonde, or rather straw\r\ncolour, with a gleam or flash of magnetic amber.\r\n\r\nThese two articles were less garments than friends,--gentle\r\nslaves,--supple and charming flatterers: the cashmere warm, caressing,\r\nand pliant, enfolding the bather lovingly when she emerged from her\r\nbath; the silk tunic, on the contrary, light and aërial, only not too\r\ndiaphanous. Its blonde whiteness agreed most admirably with the colour\r\nof her skin; one might indeed have very justly said that it had imbibed\r\nthat colour through its constant intimacy and accustomed tenderness.\r\nInferior to the skin, undoubtedly, yet it seemed related to it; or\r\nrather it became in the end a part of the body, and, as it were, melted\r\ninto it, like a dream which informs our whole existence, and cannot be\r\nseparated from it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VII.--INSTRUMENTS OF THE INSECT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nINSTRUMENTS OF THE INSECT: AND ITS CHEMICAL ENERGIES, AS IN THE\r\nCOCHINEAL AND THE CANTHARIDES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHave I insisted too much upon my theme? No; I have reached its very\r\ndepths, its most important details.\r\n\r\nSilk is not a particular, but a general view or aspect of it, for\r\nnearly every insect produces silk.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have dealt with only one kind of silk,--that of the bombyx,\r\nand indeed that of a species of bombyx which is not very fertile. Let\r\nus hope that the meritorious Society of Acclimatization will introduce\r\nhere the Chinese bombyx (_Attacus_), which lives on the dwarf oak,\r\nwhose strong and cheap silk might be used as clothing for the poor.\r\nAll classes thenceforth might wear a material warm, light, impervious,\r\nsolid; and not only so, but beautiful, brilliant, and noble. Such a\r\nchange would be equivalent, in my eyes, to the general ennoblement and\r\ntransfiguration of the people.\r\n\r\nRéaumur long ago asserted that numerous chrysalides would furnish a\r\nbeautiful silk. The spider would yield a substance both delicate and\r\ntenacious,--as witness the admirable veil of spider's silk preserved in\r\nthe Paris Museum.\r\n\r\nThe delicate Arachne, whose light thread resembles a fleecy\r\ncloud,--which is nevertheless so strong, as it issues from the\r\nspinnerets,--Arachne is pre-eminently the spinner. But, as a general\r\nrule, the insect is the weaver, and wholly devoted to that feminine\r\nart. I was about to say, the insect is a woman.\r\n\r\nIn our vocabulary \"feminine\" means feeble; but in the Insect World\r\nit is the synonym of strength and energy. It is,--as is the case\r\nwith maternity everywhere,--it is for the purpose of defending and\r\nnourishing the child, of provisioning the cradle in which the orphan\r\nwill remain alone,--it is for this purpose specially that the insect is\r\na warrior, and furnished with formidable weapons.\r\n\r\nAs far as concerns the instruments which pierce, and cut, and saw, the\r\ninsect, in spite of all our progress, is perhaps a little in advance\r\nof man to-day. The instinct of maternity, the need of providing for\r\nits child--the future orphan--the protecting shelter of the hardest\r\nbodies, has evidently inspired it to make extraordinary efforts for the\r\ndevelopment and refinement of its tools. A few, in their fantastical\r\ncharacter, have as yet no analogues in any of our factories.\r\n\r\nLong before Réaumur organized the thermometer, the ants, for the\r\nprotection of their delicate, hygrometrical, and susceptible\r\neggs, divided their habitations into a series of thirty or forty\r\nstories,--lowering or raising the tiny creatures to the degree of\r\nwarmth, dryness, or humidity, which the temperature of the day and of\r\nthe hour of the day rendered necessary. Thus they formed an infallible\r\nthermometer, on which one might rely with as much certainty as on that\r\nof the philosophers.\r\n\r\nIn the comparisons between human and insect industry, the differences\r\nwhich we remark belong not so much to the methods as to the speciality\r\nof their wants and situation. The insect aptly varies the application\r\nof its arts. For example: the spider which, in its network-trap,\r\nimprovised every day, lightens its work by a mixture of gluing and\r\nspinning, follows quite a different process in the important labour of\r\nfabricating the soft, warm, and durable cocoons which are intended to\r\nreceive its young. The nest would seem to be partly spun and partly\r\nfelted, like the majority of birds' nests.\r\n\r\nWe know that from the water-spider man derived the idea of the\r\ndiving-bell; but it is _not_ generally known that an ingenious Norman\r\npeasant has succeeded in imitating perfectly the operations of the\r\nlarva of the syrphes, which, by means of an extremely prolonged\r\nrespiratory apparatus, preserves a communication with the pure and\r\nwholesome air, even while working at the bottom of the most putrid\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nIt seems, then, that in the Insect World exist a complete pharmacy,\r\nchemistry, and perfumery. Have our sciences been sufficiently attentive\r\nto this fact? The potent vitality which gives an extraordinary force\r\nto the muscles of such tiny creatures, seems also to endow their\r\nliquids with active properties and burning energies which the large\r\nanimals do not possess. Many, for defensive purposes, are gifted with\r\ncaustic secretions--which they eject the moment you approach--or\r\nwith fulminating powders. Others with poison, which flows as soon as\r\nthe sting has been thrust in. Some possess, in addition, an art of\r\nmagnetizing or etherizing their enemy; and others, like certain ants\r\nwhich work in damp, woody places, season their abodes by burning them,\r\nas it were, with potent formic acid.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe entire genus of the _Cerambyx_ (or Long-horned Beetle) exhale a\r\nstrong, rose-like odour, which is smelt at a distance, is lasting, and\r\nendures after the creature's death. Even among the Carnivora, ay, and\r\namong the Coprophagi, we meet with perfumed insects, or, at all events,\r\nwith insects which, when in danger of being captured, endeavour to\r\ndeceive you, or implore pity, by emitting agreeable odours.\r\n\r\nOthers shine with admirable colours. The deep reds of the Nopal Coccus\r\nhave furnished the purple of kings.\r\n\r\nBy a skilful mixture, we also obtain from the cochineal the\r\npre-eminently gay and radiant colour, carmine, with its innumerable\r\ntints and rosy shades.\r\n\r\nA sovereign art with the insect is to carry on its sting, and\r\nconcentrate at a particular point, the liquids which flow in the plant,\r\nin the living being. It is the very art of irritation. Its applications\r\nare innumerable in medicine and industry; tints, paintings, varied\r\nornaments, a hundred fantastic and beautiful things come to us from\r\nthe sting of the galls, the excrescences and gibbosities which they so\r\nskilfully raise.\r\n\r\nThe cochineal insect, while engaged in extracting by this process from\r\nexotic vegetables the envelope of solid green in which it will spend\r\nits prolonged period of rest, furnishes us with the red of reds, the\r\nscarlet of lake, which will colour varnishes, and wax, and a multitude\r\nof objects.\r\n\r\nIn health or illness, the stings of insects upon the living flesh are\r\nviolent irritants for disturbing or re-establishing the course of life.\r\nIn these there is nothing mediocre. A few, without sting, burn you by\r\ntheir internal acridity.\r\n\r\nWho has not seen on the dusty plain, before the thirsty harvest, the\r\ncantharides, with its emerald enamel, abruptly crossing the footpath\r\nwith a wild and agitated movement! Burning elixir of existence, where\r\nlove transforms itself into a poison,--it is not with impunity that\r\nwe make use of it medicinally. That medieval pharmacy, which was so\r\ndangerous to man, is not without peril, it seems, for the animals\r\nthemselves. A very intelligent but eccentrically ardent cat, which\r\nI kept for a long time, among its other caprices of violence loved\r\nto hunt the cantharides. It seemed attracted by the acridity of the\r\nbeautiful insect, as the moth is by the flame. It was an intoxication.\r\nBut when, hunting it through the flowers, she had seized and crushed\r\nher dangerous victim, the latter appeared to take its revenge.\r\n\r\nThe inflammable feline nature, stimulated by the fiery sting, broke\r\nout in cries, in excesses of fury, in strange leaps and bounds. She\r\nexpiated her orgie of fire by terrible sufferings.\r\n\r\nBut, on the contrary, another insect, the bamboo-worm, or _malalis_,\r\nprovides you, if you first remove its head, which is a deadly poison,\r\nwith an exquisite cream, the sweet and soporific influence of which,\r\nsay the Brazilian Indians, lulls love asleep. For two days and nights,\r\nthe young maiden who has tasted of it, crouching under the blossomy\r\ntree, feels all the more powerfully in her soul the depth of the virgin\r\nforests, and the mystery of those fresh glades which have never seen\r\nthe sun, nor echoed to the step of man, nor known any intruder but the\r\nlonely great blue butterfly. And yet she is not alone: love quenches\r\nher thirst with the most delicious fruits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIII.--THE STUDY OF THE INSECT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nON THE RENOVATION OF OUR ARTS BY THE STUDY OF THE INSECT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Arts properly so called, the Fine Arts, should profit much more\r\nthan the Industrial, by the study of insects. The goldsmith and the\r\nlapidary would do well to seek in them models and instruction. The\r\nsoft insects, the flies, specially possess in their eyes truly magical\r\nirises, with which no casket of gems can bear comparison. In passing\r\nfrom one species to another, and even, if I mistake not, from one\r\nindividual to another, new combinations may be observed. Remark that\r\nthe flies with brilliant wings are not always the most richly endowed,\r\nas far as their optical organs are concerned. Take the dull, gray,\r\ndusty, odious horse-fly, which lives on warm blood; its eye, to the\r\nmagnifying-glass, offers the strange faëry spectacle of a mosaic of\r\njewels, such as all the art of Froment-Meurice has scarcely invented.\r\n\r\nIf you descend still lower, insects which do not live, like this fly,\r\nupon living but upon dead matter, ordure, and decomposition, astonish\r\nus by the richness of their reflections, which our enamel ought to\r\nendeavour to reproduce. The dunghill beetle, an ungainly black insect\r\nif we look only at the upper part of its body, is, underneath, of a\r\ndeep sapphire-blue which no kingly diadem ever equalled! And what shall\r\nwe say of the son of the dead, of the Egyptian scarabæus,--a living\r\nemerald, but far superior to that jewel in the gravity, opulence, and\r\nmagic of its lustre? The imagination is impressed, and one does not\r\nfeel astonished that a people so tender and devout, so in love with\r\ndeath, so full of the dreams of eternity, took for a symbol the little\r\nmiraculous animal,--a burning jet of life springing from the grave!\r\n\r\nA certain skill in examination, and a choice of day and of light, are\r\nnecessary. You cannot properly study the insect of the tropics and that\r\nof our colder climates on the same day or at the same hour. The former\r\nshould be examined only in favourable weather, under a pure sky and\r\na strong sun,--a vivid and genial ray, analogous to the light which\r\nbathes it in its own country. The other, frequently uninteresting to\r\nthe naked eye, but of great beauty under the microscope, may reserve\r\nits grand illuminating effects for the evening, or for artificial\r\nlight. Little is promised by the cockchafer, at first sight so coarse\r\nand prosaic in appearance. Yet its scaly wing, when submitted to the\r\nfocus of the microscope, and well lighted up beneath the little mirror,\r\nso that it is seen by transparency, presents a noble winter stuff, a\r\ndead leaf, where meander veins of a very beautiful brown. And in the\r\nevening it becomes quite another thing: the yellowish part of the scale\r\nhas got the best of it, and in the light shines forth like gold--(a\r\npoor comparison!)--the strange, magical gold of paradise, which we\r\ndream of for the walls of the heavenly Jerusalem, or for the robes of\r\nlight worn by saints and spirits before the Throne! A sun softer and\r\ntenderer than the orb of day, and one which, we know not why, charms\r\nand affects the heart.\r\n\r\nA strange mirage! And yet nothing but a cockchafer's wing!\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may next be an insect which neither by day nor night,\r\nneither to the naked eye nor under the microscope, could excite a\r\nfeeling of interest; but if you take the trouble to lift up, with a\r\ndelicate and patient scalpel, the laminæ which compose the thickness\r\nof its scaly wing, you will find there, in most instances, a variety\r\nof unexpected designs, sometimes vegetable curves,--sometimes airy\r\nramifications,--sometimes angular striated figures, like hieroglyphics,\r\nwhich remind you of certain Oriental languages; and compose, in truth,\r\na genuine necromancer's book, that can neither be referred to, nor\r\ncompared with, any known form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThese singular characters, while strongly attracting the eye and\r\ndisquieting the mind, are fully worthy of the interest they excite.\r\nWhat they express, and give utterance to, in their emphatic language,\r\nis the circulation of life. Some are tubes through which the air enters\r\nthe wing, and distends it for flight; others are tiny veins where\r\ncirculate the powerful liquids that endow the imperceptible organism\r\nwith its colours and its energy.\r\n\r\nThe most attractive forms are living forms. Take a drop of blood, and\r\nsubmit it to the microscope. This drop, as it spreads, rewards you with\r\na delightful arborescence,--with the delicacy and lightness of certain\r\nwinter trees, when revealed in their actual figure, and no longer\r\nencumbered with leaves.\r\n\r\nThus, Nature's infinite potency of beauty is not limited to the\r\nsurface, as antiquity supposed. It does not trouble itself about\r\nhuman eyesight, but labours for its own behoof, and on its own work.\r\nFrom the surface to the interior, it frequently increases in beauty\r\nas in depth. It invests with surpassing loveliness things which are\r\nabsolutely hidden, and which death alone can unveil. Sometimes, as if\r\nto contradict and confound our ideas, it clothes in ravishing forms the\r\norgans which, from our point of view, accomplish the vilest functions.\r\nI am thinking of the exquisite beauty and delicate tenderness of that\r\ncoral-tree which incessantly pours out the chyle of our intestines.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo return to the insects: beauty abounds in them both externally and\r\ninternally. One need not search far in order to discover it. Take an\r\ninsect, not very rare, which I constantly meet with on the sandy soil\r\nof Fontainebleau, in localities well open to the sun. Take--but not\r\nwithout precaution, for it is well armed--the brilliant cicindela. Even\r\nto the naked eye it is an agreeable object; but under the microscope it\r\nappears to be perhaps the richest and the most varied which art could\r\nstudy. These are truly surprising creatures! Each individual differs;\r\nall are enamelled, and decorated to an excess, without resembling one\r\nanother. In each, if taken and separately studied, new discoveries may\r\nbe made.\r\n\r\nIt is the ardent and murderous hunter of other insects, and endowed\r\nwith formidable weapons,--having for its two anterior mandibles a\r\ncouple of sickles which close in upon one another, and transfix\r\ndeeply, on both sides, their unfortunate victim. Its rich and living\r\naliment apparently communicates to the cicindela its glowing colours.\r\nIts entire body is embellished with them. On the wings, a changeful\r\nbesprinkling of peacock's eyes. On the fore parts, numerous meanders,\r\ndiversely and softly shaded, are trailed over a dark ground. Abdomen\r\nand legs are glazed with such rich hues that no enamel can sustain a\r\ncomparison with them; the eye can scarcely endure their vivacity. The\r\nsingular thing is, that beside these enamels you find the dead tones\r\nof flowers and the butterfly's wing. To all these various elements add\r\nsome singularities, which you would suppose to be the work of human\r\nart, in the Oriental styles, Persian and Turkish, or as in the Indian\r\nshawl, where the colours, slightly subdued, have found an admirable\r\nbasis; time having gradually lent a grave tone to their sweet harmony.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFrankly, is there aught approaching such a degree of excellence in our\r\nhuman arts? How great the necessity that, in their apparently fatigued\r\nand languid condition, they should gain life and strength from these\r\nliving sources!\r\n\r\nIn general, instead of going straight to Nature, to the inexhaustible\r\nfountain of beauty and invention, they have solicited help from the\r\nerudition, the history, and the antiquity of man.\r\n\r\nWe have copied ancient jewels; sometimes those of the barbarous peoples\r\nwhich first procured them from our own merchants. We have copied the\r\nold robes and the stuffs of our ancestors. We have copied, especially,\r\nthe painted-glass windows of Gothic architecture, whose colours and\r\nforms have been selected hap-hazard, and transplanted to objects\r\nutterly discordant and unsuitable,--as, for instance, to shawls!\r\n\r\nIf we were desirous of comprehending and rehabilitating these ancient\r\nwindows, we might have taken a lesson from the enamels of certain\r\nscarabæi. Seen beneath the microscope, they present very analogous\r\neffects, simply because they possess the same elements of beauty. The\r\nthirteenth century glass-windows (you may see them at Bourges, and\r\nespecially in the Museum of that city) were double. The light therefore\r\nremained in them, did not pass through them, gave them the magical\r\neffects of precious stones. And of a similar character are those insect\r\nwings composed of numerous leaves, between which you may detect, with\r\nthe microscope, a network of mysterious hieroglyphics.\r\n\r\nGothic, so little in harmony with either our wants or our ideas,\r\nhas passed out of our furniture, but it still lingers in the\r\nshawl-manufacture; a rich and costly industry, which, having once\r\nadopted the fantastic method of imitating in opaque wools those windows\r\nwhose transparency was their special merit, can hardly emancipate\r\nitself from the bondage.\r\n\r\nMen have not consulted women. In order to weave complex designs, heap\r\nup a medley of arches and oriels, and condemn our wives to carry\r\nchurches on their backs, men have provided a heavy groundwork of the\r\nstoutest wools; the whole being despatched from London and Paris to be\r\nservilely woven by the Indians who have unlearned their own arts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur intelligent Parisian merchants, who have reluctantly followed in\r\nthe path traced out for them by the great producers, may very well\r\nescape from these _rich_ and heavy styles. Let some one lose patience,\r\nand turning his back on the copyists of antique absurdities, go to\r\nNature herself in search of advice,--to the great insect collections\r\nand the conservatories of the Jardin des Plantes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNature, being feminine, will tell him that if he would fitly decorate\r\nhis sister in the soft and airy tissue of the ancient cashmere, he must\r\ndelineate thereupon--not the towers of Notre-Dame,[N] but a hundred\r\ncharming creatures--that little, but, if you will, very common marvel\r\nof the cicindela, in which all styles are combined;--or the purple\r\nscarabæus glorified in its lily;--or the emerald chrysomela, which this\r\nvery morning I found sensually reposing at the bottom of a rose.\r\n\r\n[Footnote N: Notre-Dame is the metropolitan cathedral of Paris.]\r\n\r\nDo I mean that you should copy these? Not at all. I should call these\r\nliving creatures, in their robe of love, from which they derive all\r\ntheir charm, an animated aureola, which cannot be translated. We must\r\nbe content to love and contemplate them, to draw our inspiration from\r\nthem, to convert them into ideal forms, and new rainbows of colours,\r\nand exquisite posies of blossoms. Thus transformed, they will become,\r\nnot what they are in Nature, but fantastic and wonderful,--as the child\r\nwho pants for them sees them in its slumber, or the maiden yearning\r\nafter a beautiful attire, or as the young pregnant wife when dreaming\r\nof them in her hours of longing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IX.--THE SPIDER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE SPIDER--INDUSTRY--THE STOPPAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore we pass on to those insect communities with which the latter\r\nportion of this volume will be occupied, let us speak here of a\r\nsolitary individual.\r\n\r\nHigher, and yet lower, than the insect, the spider is separated from it\r\nby its organization, but connected with it by its instincts, wants, and\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nA being strongly specialized in two particulars, it is excluded from\r\nthe great classes of the animal kingdom, and stands isolated, as it\r\nwere, in creation.\r\n\r\nIn the fertile countries of the tropics, where game abounds, it lives\r\nwith its fellows. Some are said to weave around a tree one immense\r\nnet, common to all, whose avenues they guard in perfect agreement.\r\nNay more: having frequent occasion to deal with powerful insects, and\r\neven little birds, they co-operate in the hour of peril, and lend each\r\nother, as it were, a helping hand.\r\n\r\nBut this gregarious mode of living is wholly exceptional, confined to\r\ncertain species, and peculiarly favoured climates. Everywhere else the\r\nspider, through its organism and the fatality of its life, assumes the\r\ncharacter of the hunter, of the savage, who, living upon uncertain\r\nprey, remains envious, mistrustful, exclusive, and solitary.\r\n\r\nBut remember that it does not resemble the ordinary hunter, who gets\r\nquit with his journeys, his exertions, and his activity. The spider's\r\nhunt costs it dearly, if I may venture to say so, and demands an\r\nincessant outlay. Every day, every hour, it must draw from its own\r\nsubstance the essential element of the network which is to provide it\r\nwith food and renew that substance. Accordingly, it starves in order to\r\nnourish, and exhausts in order to recruit itself; it grows lean on the\r\ndubious hope of afterwards growing fat. Its life is a lottery, remitted\r\nto the risk of a thousand unforeseen contingencies. Hence, it cannot\r\nfail to develop into an unquiet creature, sympathizing but coldly with\r\nits kind, in whom it sees possible competitors,--in a word, it is a\r\nfatally egotistical animal. And were it not so, it would perish.\r\n\r\nThe worst of it is, as far as the poor creature is concerned, that it\r\nis profoundly ugly. It is not one of those which, ugly to the naked\r\neye, are rehabilitated by the microscope. The overwhelming speciality\r\nof its career has the effect, as we see among men, of attenuating one\r\nlimb, exaggerating another, and prevents anything like harmony: the\r\nblacksmith is frequently a hunchback. In the same manner the spider\r\nis pot-bellied. Nature has sacrificed everything to its function, its\r\nwants, and the industrial apparatus which will satisfy those wants. It\r\nis an artisan, a rope-maker, a spinner, and a weaver. Do not look at\r\nits figure, but at the product of its art. It is not only a spinner,\r\nbut a spinning-mill.\r\n\r\nConcentrated and circular, with eight feet around its body, and eight\r\nvigilant eyes in its head, it causes astonishment by the eccentric\r\nprominency of its enormous belly. An ignoble feature, wherein the\r\ncareless observer reads the result of gormandising! Alas, it is just\r\nthe contrary! This big belly is its workshop, its magazine, the pouch\r\nwhere the rope-maker carries in front of it the material of the thread\r\nwhich it winds and unwinds; but as it fills this pouch with nothing but\r\nits very substance, it enlarges only at the expense of itself, and by\r\ndint of extreme sobriety. And you shall often see it, though emaciated\r\nin every limb, retaining full and expanded the treasure which is the\r\nindispensable element of its labour, the hope of its industry, and its\r\nonly chance of a future. A true type of the man of industry! \"If I fast\r\nto-day,\" it says, \"I shall eat perhaps to-morrow; but if my material\r\nruns short, all is over,--my stomach must rest and fast for ever!\"\r\n\r\nMy first relations with the spider were nothing less than agreeable.\r\nIn my poverty-blighted childhood, while I toiled alone (as I have\r\nsaid in my book on \"The People\") in the then ruinous and desolate\r\nprinting-office of my father, the temporary workshop was in a kind of\r\ncellar, sufficiently well lighted,--being a cellar in the boulevard\r\nwhere my family resided, but on the ground-floor so far as concerned\r\nthe adjoining street. Through a large grated window the mid-day sun\r\nobliquely lighted up the sombre case where I put together my little\r\nleaden letters. There, at the angle of the wall, I distinctly perceived\r\na prudent spider, which, supposing the stray sunbeam would bring some\r\nimprudent fly for its breakfast, drew near my case. This sunbeam,\r\nfalling not in its corner but nearer me, was a natural temptation to\r\ninvite its closer approach. In spite of my innate disgust, I admired\r\nthe progressive ratio of timid, slow, and prudent experiment by which\r\nit ascertained the character of him to whose mercy it virtually\r\nconfided its very existence. It watched me closely with all its eight\r\neyes, and propounded to itself the problem, \"Is he, or is he not, an\r\nenemy?\"\r\n\r\nWithout analyzing its figure, or very clearly distinguishing its\r\neyes, I felt that I was observed and watched; and apparently this\r\nobservation, in the long run, proved favourable to me. By the instinct\r\nof work, perhaps (which is very great in its species), it perceived\r\nthat I was really a peaceful labourer, and that I was busy, like\r\nitself, in weaving my cobweb. However this may be, it abandoned its\r\nstratagems and precautions with a quick decision, as if adopting an\r\nadventurous and somewhat perilous step. Not without grace it descended\r\nupon its thread, and planted itself resolutely on our respective\r\nfrontier--the edge of my case, favoured, at that moment, with a golden\r\nray of the sickly sun.\r\n\r\nI was divided between two sentiments. I confess that I did not\r\nrelish so close an intimacy,--the figure of such a friend pleased\r\nme but little; on the other hand, this prudent and observant being,\r\nwhich certainly did not lavish its confidence, seemed to say to me:\r\n\"Wherefore should I not enjoy a little of thy sun? So different in\r\nnature, we have nevertheless arrived together from our necessitous toil\r\nand cold obscurity at this sweet banquet of light. Let us take heart,\r\nand fraternize. This ray which you permit me to share, receive it from\r\nme, and preserve it. In another half century, it will kindle up your\r\nwinter.\"\r\n\r\nAs the little black fairy said this in its own language, whispering\r\nlow, very low--in fact, it could not be lower (for it is thus that\r\nfairies speak)--I marked the effect of it vaguely, and it slumbered in\r\nmy mind. The circumstance, however, was recalled for a brief while some\r\nyears ago; and again, after a long interval, it has been revived on\r\nthis very day, when for the first time I record and explain it.\r\n\r\nOn the former occasion, after a domestic affliction, I was spending my\r\nholidays in Paris, and I went daily alone to walk in my little garden\r\nin the Rue des Postes. My family were in the country. Mechanically I\r\nremarked the beautiful concentric stars which the spiders had woven\r\nround my trees, and which they repaired and remade incessantly with\r\na laudable industry, giving themselves immense trouble to preserve\r\nmy small stock of fruits and grapes, and relieving myself from the\r\nimportunity of flies and the stings of gnats. They reminded me of\r\nthe black domestic spider which, in my childhood, had entered into\r\nconversation with me. These latter were very different. Daughters of\r\nair and light, always exposed, always before the eyes of men, without\r\nother shelter than the surface of a leaf, where they may easily be\r\ncaptured, they are unable to cultivate the reserve or diplomacy of\r\nmy old acquaintance. All their work, is visible, all their little\r\nmystery open to the wind, and their persons at everybody's discretion;\r\nthey have no other protection than what may be afforded them through\r\ncompassion, or in consideration of a well-understood interest in the\r\npositive services which they render.\r\n\r\nThose which suspend their nests to the branches of trees, like those\r\nwhich suspend them to our windows, display an evident design to place\r\nthemselves in the wind, where a current of air may waft the insects\r\nto them, or in the path of a ray of light in which the gnat may float\r\nand whirl. The web does not fall vertically, for such a position would\r\nrestrict it to one current; the spider, like an able seaman, gives it a\r\ngreat obliquity, and thus secures a couple of currents, or even more.\r\n\r\nFrom the extremity of its belly, four screw-plates or tubercles, which\r\ncan be drawn in or out (like telescopes), eject by their movement a\r\nvery little cloud, that increases in size from minute to minute. This\r\ncloud is composed of threads of an infinite tenuity; each tubercle\r\nsecretes a thousand, and the four, by combining together their four\r\nthousand threads, make the unique and tolerably strong thread of which\r\nthe web is woven.\r\n\r\nMark well, that the threads of the intelligent manufacturer are not\r\nall alike, but of different strength and quality according to their\r\ndestination. Some are dry for warping, others viscous for gluing. The\r\ntissues of the nest intended for the reception of the new-born are of a\r\ncottony material, while those which will enwrap the cocoon containing\r\nthe eggs possess all the resistant power necessary for the safety of\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\nWhen the spider has produced a sufficient quantity of thread to\r\nundertake a web, it voluntarily glides from an elevated point,\r\nand unwinds its skein. There it remains suspended, and afterwards\r\nreascending to its starting-point by the assistance of its tiny\r\ncordage, moves towards another point; and continues to trace in this\r\nmanner a series of radii all diverging from the same centre.\r\n\r\nThe skein stretched, it is busied next in weaving the woof by crossing\r\nthe thread. Running from radius to radius, it touches each with its\r\ntubercles, which fasten to it the circular border. The whole is not a\r\ncompact tissue, but a veritable network, so geometrically proportioned\r\nthat all the meshes of the circle are invariably of the same size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis web, woven out of itself, living and vibrating, is much more\r\nthan an instrument; it is a part of its being. Itself of a circular\r\nform, the spider seems to expand within this circle, and prolong the\r\nfilaments of its nerves to the radiating threads which it weaves. In\r\nthe centre of its web lies its greatest force for attack or defence.\r\nOut of that centre it is timid; a fly will make it recoil. The web is\r\nits electric telegraph, responding to the lightest touch, and revealing\r\nthe presence of an imperceptible and almost imponderable victim; while,\r\nat the same time, being slightly viscous in substance, it retains the\r\nprey, or delays and entangles a dangerous enemy.\r\n\r\nIn windy weather, the continual agitation of the web prevents it from\r\ngiving an account of what transpires, and the spider then remains at\r\nthe centre. But usually it keeps near its machinery, hidden under a\r\nleaf, that it may not terrify its victims, or fall a prey to any of its\r\nnumerous foes.\r\n\r\nPrudence and patience, rather than courage, are its characteristics.\r\nIts experience is too great, it has undergone too many accidents and\r\nmisadventures, it is too much accustomed to the severities of fate, to\r\nindulge in any surpassing audacity. It is afraid even of an ant. The\r\nlatter, often a mischievous individual, a restless and rugged rodent,\r\nand afraid of nothing, frequently persists in exploring the strange\r\nwoof, of which it can make nothing. The spider accordingly gives\r\nway to it,--whether it fears the acid of the ant, which burns like\r\naquafortis, or whether, like a good artisan, it calculates that a long\r\nand obstinate struggle will cost it more time than will the manufacture\r\nof another web. Therefore, without yielding to the slightest\r\nsusceptibility of self-love, it allows the ant to strut about, and\r\ntakes up its post a little further off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEvery animal lives by depredation. Nature is ever devouring itself;\r\nbut the prey is not always sought and merited by a patient industry\r\ndeserving of respect. No being, however, is so much the plaything of\r\nfate as the spider. Like every good workman, it has a twofold value: in\r\nits work and its person. An infinity of insects--the murderous carabus,\r\nor the _libellula_, an elegant and splendid assassin--have only their\r\nbodies and their weapons, and spend their lives joyously in killing.\r\nOthers possess secure and easily defended asylums, where they have\r\ncause to fear few dangers. The field-spider has neither the one nor the\r\nother advantage. It is in the position of the respectable operative,\r\nwho, through his small and ill-guaranteed fortune, attracts or tempts\r\ncupidity or insolence. The lizard from below, the squirrel from above,\r\nhunt the feeble hunter. The inert frog darts at it the viscous tongue,\r\nwhich glues it and renders it immovable. It is the felicity of the\r\nswallow, in her graceful circle, to carry off, without injuring, the\r\nspider and his web; and all birds look upon it as a great dainty or\r\nan excellent medicine. The nightingale, faithful, like all great\r\nsingers, to a certain hygiene, prescribes for herself, as an occasional\r\npurgative, a spider.\r\n\r\nEven if she be not swallowed up herself, if the instrument of her\r\ntrade is destroyed, the consequences are the same. Should the web be\r\nundone blow upon blow, a somewhat protracted fast renders it unable to\r\nsecrete a fresh supply of thread, and it soon perishes of hunger. It is\r\nconstantly confined in this vicious circle:--\r\n\r\nTo spin, it requires food;\r\n\r\nTo feed, it must spin.\r\n\r\nIts thread, for the spider as for the Parcæ, is that of destiny.\r\n\r\nWe once made the experiment of removing three times running a spider's\r\nweb. Three times, in six hours, it replaced it, with admirable\r\npatience, and without abating one jot of hope. The experiment was a\r\ncruel one, and we now reproach ourselves for it. We meet with too many\r\npoor unfortunates, whom accidents of this kind have thrown out of work,\r\nand who are thenceforth too exhausted to resume their industry. One\r\nsees them, like living skeletons, attempting fruitlessly a different\r\ntrade, in which they succeed but poorly, and mournfully envying the\r\nlong legs of the field-spiders, which gain their living by incessant\r\ntravelling.\r\n\r\nWhen people speak of the eager gluttony of the spider, they forget that\r\nit must either eat a double quantity, or soon perish: eat to recruit\r\nits body, and eat to renew its thread.\r\n\r\nThree circumstances contribute to wear it out: the ardour of incessant\r\nwork, its nervous susceptibility--which is carried to an extreme--and\r\nits twofold respiratory system.\r\n\r\nFor it has not only the passive respiration of the insect, which\r\nreceives, or submits to, the air introduced through its stigmata;\r\nit has also a kind of active respiration, analogous to the play of\r\nthe lungs in the higher animals. It takes the air and masters it,\r\ntransforms and decomposes it, and incessantly renews it. If you do\r\nbut examine its movements, you feel that it is something more than an\r\ninsect; the vital glow traverses its frame in a rapid circulation; the\r\nheart beats very differently from what it does in the fly or butterfly.\r\n\r\nBut its superiority is its peril. The insect braves with impunity the\r\nstrongest odours and mephitic miasmas. The spider cannot endure them.\r\nInstantly affected by them, it falls into convulsions, struggles,\r\nand expires. I saw this incident one day at Lucerne. Chloroform,\r\nwhose action the stag-beetle had endured for fourteen days without\r\nsuccumbing, immediately--at the first contact--overpowered the spider.\r\nYet the victim was a large one, and I found it engaged in eating a\r\ngnat. I wished to experiment, and poured on it a single drop. The\r\neffect was terrible. Nothing more pitiful could be seen in a case of\r\nhuman asphyxia. It tumbled over, raised itself, and then swooned; all\r\nits supports failed it, and its limbs appeared disjointed. One thing\r\nwas very pathetic--that in this supreme moment the fecundity of its\r\nbosom became apparent; in its agony, its tubercles sent forth their\r\nlittle cloudy woof, so that you might have believed it to be working\r\neven in death.\r\n\r\nI felt oppressed, and in the hope that the fresh air would perhaps\r\nrevive it, I placed it on my window-sill; but it was no longer\r\n_itself_. I know not how the effect was produced; but it seemed to have\r\nmelted away, and nothing of it remained but its skeleton. The vanished\r\nsubstance had left but its shadow, which the wind bore away to the\r\nneighbouring lake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: X.--THE HOME AND LOVES OF THE SPIDER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE HOME AND LOVES OF THE SPIDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spider greatly surpasses all other solitary-living insects. It not\r\nonly possesses its nest, its ambush, its temporary hunting-station;\r\nit has (or, at least, certain species have) a regular house, a house\r\nof a very complex description: a vestibule, and a sleeping-chamber,\r\nand a mode of egress in the rear; and, finally, a door which is a very\r\ntriumph of art, for it closes of itself, falling back by its own weight.\r\n\r\nThe door! It is this which is wanting even in the grand cities of the\r\nbees and the ants; these industrial republics have never hitherto\r\nattained to so lofty a climax.\r\n\r\nThe ants have just reached the point at which most of our African\r\ntribes have halted. Every evening they shut up their dwelling-places\r\nwith immense labour--renewed daily--and by a little, unsubstantial\r\nlattice-work, which does not relieve them from the necessity of\r\nplanting sentinels. It is true, however, that these great, valiant, and\r\nwell-armed peoples have no fear of invasion, and, like Lacedæmon, need\r\nneither walls nor ditches. Their proud intrepidity has set limits to\r\ntheir industry.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the poor artisan which lives by itself, and is\r\nalways exhausted by the incessant toil of spinning and weaving, cannot\r\nrely upon its valour. It has need, in certain countries and under\r\ncertain alarming conditions, of profound ingenuity, and has discovered\r\nthis little miracle of prudence and combination, which eclipses both\r\nthe savage and the insect. I do not refer to the great animals, none of\r\nwhich, except the beaver, are very industrious.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Lucerne we for the first time saw the house\r\nof the spider (the _Agelena_). It was a kind of sheath, and very well\r\nmade, with a vestibule facing the south, which expanded outward like a\r\nfunnel. This exterior portion, forming a little sunny retreat, was the\r\nsnare and the citadel. The lady of the house stationed herself quite\r\nat the bottom of the funnel; but behind this very bottom, at the lower\r\nextremity of the case or sheath, was constructed a back apartment,\r\nsmall and very secure, in a white substantial cocoon. In this she\r\ntrusted so completely, that while we detached the silken cables which\r\nmoored the entire edifice to the bush, she made no attempt to escape.\r\nWe had neither destroyed nor damaged, but simply detached the dwelling,\r\nand on the day following we found it repaired and moored to the bush on\r\nevery side. The exposure was no longer so favourable; but, undoubtedly,\r\nthe workman, in an advanced season of the year (in September, and under\r\nthe Alps), did not possess the resources for recommencing this grand\r\nsummer-work.\r\n\r\nIn the Brazilian forests a little spider has its case suspended exactly\r\nin the centre of its web; and thither it hurries at the slightest\r\napproach of danger, and has no sooner entered, says Swainson, than the\r\ndoor suddenly closes behind it by a spring.\r\n\r\nBut the masterpiece of the genus is seen, especially in Corsica, in\r\nthe laborious _Mygale_. Its residence is a kind of well, industriously\r\nwalled round, with smooth and polished sides, and a double tapestry,--a\r\ncoarse strong hanging on the earthward front, and a fine satiny hanging\r\nin the interior. The orifice of the well is closed by a door. This door\r\nis a disc, much larger at the top than at the bottom, and let into\r\na groove in such a manner as to shut hermetically. The disc, which\r\nis not more than three lines thick, contains, nevertheless, thirty\r\ndouble woofs, and between the woofs intervene the same number of coats\r\nor layers of earth,--so that the entire door is really composed of\r\nsixty doors. Here, in truth, is a miracle of patience; but observe,\r\ntoo, the ingenuity,--all these doors of network and earth clamp into\r\none another. The thread-doors at one point are prolonged to the wall,\r\nfastening the door to the wall as by a hinge. This door opens outwardly\r\nwhen the spider raises it to go forth, and closes by its own weight.\r\nBut the enemy might eventually succeed in opening it. This has been\r\nanticipated. On the side opposite the hinge some small holes are worked\r\nin the door; to these the spider clings, and becomes a living bolt.[O]\r\n\r\n[Footnote O: See the works of Audouin and Walckenaër.]\r\n\r\nWhat would happen if this astonishing artisan, placed in peculiar\r\nand trying circumstances (like the bees under Huber's experiments),\r\nwere called upon to vary its art and devise a novelty? Could it do\r\nso? Has it the intelligence, the resource, and, at need, the power of\r\ninnovation which the superior insects display under certain conditions?\r\nIt would be worth while to make the experiment. This, at all events, is\r\ncertain, that the simple _Epeiras_ (our garden-spiders) know very well,\r\nwhen deprived of the necessary space for extending their geometrical\r\ncurtain, how to construct one of irregular design, decreasing in\r\nproportion to the restrictions of their area.\r\n\r\nExperiments, moreover, are difficult. The spider is so nervous, that\r\nthe fear which makes it an artist can also paralyze and utterly\r\nconfound it. Its web alone gives it courage. Out of its web, everything\r\nmakes it tremble. In captivity, having no web, it actually flees before\r\nits prey, and has not the resolution to confront a fly.\r\n\r\nIts miserable condition of passive expectancy fully explains its\r\ncharacter. To wait, while acting, running, fighting, is to cheat both\r\ntime and hunger; but to remain there immovable, to be unable to stir\r\nfrom fear of alarming your prey, to watch it coming nearer and nearer\r\nbut eventually escaping, and to suffer from an empty stomach! To be\r\na witness of the endless, heedless dances of the fly, which, in the\r\nsunbeam, amuses and balances itself for hours without responding to\r\nthe avid prayers of the tempter which whispers, \"Come, little one!\r\nCome, my darling!\" is a terrible punishment, a series of hopes and\r\ndisappointments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt pursues its gay measure, and thinks nothing of the sufferer.\r\n\r\nThe fatal inquiry, \"Shall I dine?\" returns, and lacerates its bowels.\r\nThen comes the more ominous reflection: \"If I do not dine to-day, no\r\nmore thread! And far less, then, may I hope to dine to-morrow!\"\r\n\r\nFrom all this results a suffering, restless, but prodigiously wary and\r\nattentive being, which detects not only the slightest contact, but\r\nthe slightest noise. The spider is only too sensitive. A very little\r\ndisturbance seems to overthrow its self-control. It apparently faints;\r\nyou see it suddenly fall from its position, struck down by fear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis sensitiveness, as you will readily believe, is especially\r\ndisplayed in the spider's maternal condition. However miserable and\r\navaricious in its nature, it is tender, liberal, and generous towards\r\nits young. While the birds of prey--the winged hunters which have so\r\nmany resources--drive away their young at a very early age, look upon\r\nthem as greedy competitors, and force them by blows of their beaks to\r\ndwell afar from the domain which they reserve as their own, the spider\r\nis not contented with carrying its eggs in the cocoon, but, in certain\r\nspecies, nourishes them when living and greedy, guards them, bears them\r\non its back; or else she makes them walk, holding them by a thread;\r\nif danger threatens, she draws in the thread, they leap upon her, and\r\nshe saves them. If she cannot do so, she will perish. Some there are\r\nwhich, rather than abandon their offspring, will suffer themselves to\r\nbe swallowed up in the gulf of the ant-lion. Others, of a slow species,\r\nwhich, when unable to save them, make no effort to escape, but allow\r\nthemselves to be captured also.\r\n\r\nTheir nests are frequently masterpieces. At Interlaken, in Switzerland,\r\nI have admired their long soft tubes, warm in the interior, and\r\nwell-lined,--externally, disguised with much skill by an artistic\r\npell-mell of small bits of leaf, tiny twigs, and fragments of gray\r\nplaster, so as to melt perfectly into the colour of the wall supporting\r\nthem. But this was nothing in comparison with a work of art which I\r\nhave here at Fontainebleau.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of July 1857, I discovered in an outhouse a very pretty\r\nround basket, about an inch across, made of all kinds of materials,\r\nand, as it had nothing to fear from rain, without any cover. It was\r\nvery gracefully suspended to a beam by some elegant silken threads,\r\nwhich I should call little hands, such as are possessed by the climbing\r\nplants. Within, brooding on its eggs with a constant incubation, might\r\nbe seen a spider. It never stirred, except, perhaps, for a moment at\r\nnight, in quest of food. Never was there any animal so timid. At the\r\ngentlest approaches fear made it fly, and almost fall. Once when we\r\ndisturbed it a little abruptly, it was seized with such an excess of\r\nterror that it did not recover for an entire day. It sat for six weeks,\r\nand, but for these perturbations, would perhaps have remained much\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nAn admirable mother,--an ingenious and delicate artist,--before all\r\nthings a female,--a female nervous and timid to the highest degree,\r\nthis strange sensitive creature explained to me perfectly the very\r\nopposite sentiments with which the spider inspires us,--those of\r\nrepulsion and attraction. We start away from it, and yet we draw near\r\nto it. It is so coarse, and yet, at the same time, so prodigiously\r\nsensitive! It breathes as we do. And the delicate tubercle which\r\nsecretes its silk, like a milky cloud (as the microscope shows us), is\r\nthe most feminine organ which exists, perhaps, in nature.\r\n\r\nAlas, it is alone! Except a few species (mygales) in which the father\r\nrenders some assistance to the mother, it expects no help. The male,\r\nafter its moment of love, becomes, indeed, an enemy. Cruel consequences\r\nof misery! It perceives that its children are capable of furnishing\r\nit with food. But the mother, who is bigger than he, makes a similar\r\nreflection,--thinks that the eater is eatable,--and frequently crunches\r\nher spouse.\r\n\r\nThese atrocious events never happen, I am confident, in climates where\r\nease and abundance do not deprave their natural disposition. But in our\r\nwell-peopled countries, with game very rare, and competition of extreme\r\nviolence, these unfortunates act towards one another like the wretched\r\ncastaways on the raft of the _Medusa_.\r\n\r\nA cruel tyrant, the stomach, dominates over all nature, and vanquishes\r\neven love. Passion, in an anxious and restless being like the spider,\r\nis very mistrustful. At the height of his devotion, the lean and feeble\r\nmale dares only approach the majestic lady with a timid reverence and\r\nthe utmost reserve. He advances, he retires, he watches; he seems\r\nto ask himself if he has at all succeeded in subduing the haughty\r\ncreature. He resorts to the timid methods of a slow magnetism, and\r\nespecially to an extreme patience. He puts little faith in the first\r\nsigns, and does not willingly yield his confidence. And, finally, when\r\nthe adored object shows herself sensible of his sincerity, and grows\r\nardent in her expansion of soul, he does not so wholly trust in her\r\nbut what he will escape, and fly with all his speed, at some sudden\r\nimpulse, and under the influence of an indescribable panic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch is the terrible idyl of the dusky lovers of our ceilings. Among\r\nour garden-spiders less suspicion seems to exist. Nature softens\r\nhearts, and rugged industrialism itself grows smoother in rustic\r\nlife. We see some upon our trees which behave tolerably well to their\r\nhusbands, and do not too often remember that they are competitors in\r\nthe chase. They permit them to reside in the same locality, although\r\na little apart, and keeping them at a distance. A light partition\r\nseparates them. The princess consents that he may live under her roof,\r\nand on the ground-floor, while she lives on the first story,--keeping\r\nhim below and in subjection, so that he may not presume to think\r\nhimself the king, but only the _prince consort_, and the _husband of\r\nthe queen_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHave they any sympathies beyond their own race? So some authorities\r\nhave asserted, and I believe it. They are isolated from us far less\r\nthan the true insects. They live in our houses, have an interest in\r\nknowing us, and seem to observe us. They pay great attention to voices\r\nand sounds, and have a marvellous perception of them. If they have not\r\nthe insect-organs of hearing (which would seem to be the antennæ), it\r\nis because they are _all antennæ_. Their excessive vigilance, and the\r\nnervous irradiation which makes itself felt everywhere among them,\r\nendow them with the keenest receptivity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMuch has been said about the musical spider of Pellisson. Another and\r\nless-known anecdote is not less striking. One of those little victims\r\nwhich are trained into virtuosi before they are ripe of age,--Berthome,\r\nillustrious in 1800,--owed his astonishing successes to the savage\r\nconfinement in which he was forced to work. At eight he astounded and\r\nstupefied his hearers by his mastery of the violin. In his perpetual\r\nsolitude he had a comrade whom no one suspected,--a spider. It was\r\nlodged at first in a quiet corner, but it gave itself license to\r\nadvance from the corner to the music-stand, from the music-stand to the\r\nchild, even climbing upon the mobile arm which held the bow. There, a\r\npalpitating and breathless amateur, it paused and listened. It was an\r\naudience in itself. The artist needed nothing more to fill him with\r\ninspiration and double his energy.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the child had a stepmother, who, one day, introducing an\r\namateur into the sanctuary, saw the sensible animal at its post. A blow\r\nfrom her slipper annihilated the auditory. The child fell swooning to\r\nthe ground, was ill for three months, and died,--heartbroken!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBook the Third.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNITIES OF INSECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I.--THE TERMITES, OR WHITE ANTS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE CITY IN THE SHADOWS: THE TERMITES, OR WHITE ANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. de Prefontaine (cited by Huber, in his work on \"The Ants\") relates\r\nthat, when travelling in Guiana, he saw a party of negroes besieging\r\ncertain fantastic edifices which he calls ant-hills. They did not\r\nventure to attack them except from a distance, and with firearms;\r\nhaving first taken the precaution, moreover, to dig a little trench and\r\nfill it with water, to check the progress of the beleaguered army and\r\ndrown its battalions, if they adventured a sortie.\r\n\r\nThese edifices are not the habitations of Ants, but of Termites,--quite\r\na different species of insect; which are found not only in Guiana, but\r\nin Africa, New Holland, and in the prairies of North America.\r\n\r\nA host of travellers have described them. But the standard and most\r\ninstructive authority is that of Smeathman, which now lies before\r\nus, enriched with excellent plates. The drawings are taken from the\r\ntermite-hills of Africa.\r\n\r\nFigure to yourself a mound of earth, about twelve feet high (some have\r\nbeen discovered measuring twenty), which, from a distance, might easily\r\nbe mistaken for a negro's hut. Approach it, and you will at once detect\r\nthat it is the product of a higher art. Its curious form is that of a\r\npointed dome; or, if you like, of an obtuse and preponderating obelisk.\r\nFor support, the dome or obelisk has four, five, or six cupolas from\r\nfive to six feet high; and against these are propped up below some\r\nsmall bell-like structures, nearly two feet in elevation. The whole\r\nmight well be taken for a kind of Oriental cathedral, the principal\r\nspire of which had a double cincture of minarets, decreasing in height;\r\nthe said whole being of extreme solidity, and composed of a compact\r\nclay, which, when burnt, makes the best bricks. Not only may several\r\nmen stand upon it without injury, but even the wild bull's station\r\nthemselves on its summit as sentinels to watch, through the high\r\ngrasses of the plain, that the lion or panther does not surprise the\r\nherd.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this dome is hollow, and the inferior platform which\r\nsupports it is itself supported by a semi-hollow construction formed by\r\nthe junction of four arches (two to three feet in span),--arches of a\r\nvery substantial design, being pointed, ogival, and in a kind of Gothic\r\nstyle. Lower still extends a number of passages or corridors, plastered\r\nspaces which one might call saloons, and finally, convenient, spacious,\r\nand healthy lodgings, capable of receiving a large population; in\r\nbrief, quite a subterranean city.\r\n\r\nA broad spiral passage winds and rises gradually in the thickness of\r\nthe edifice, which has no opening, no door, no window; the vomitories\r\nare disguised and at a distance, terminating afar in the plain.\r\n\r\nIt is the most considerable and important work which displays the\r\ngenius of insects; a labour of infinite patience and of daring art. We\r\nmust not forget that these walls, which time has hardened, were very\r\nfriable at first, and always crumbling. To raise this Titanic edifice\r\nto such a height, a continuity of effort was absolutely requisite, and\r\na succession of provisional constructions, demolished one after the\r\nother when they had served their purpose. The masons commenced with the\r\nexterior pyramids, a foot and a foot and a half in height; then with\r\nthose of the second rank. But the latter being solid and indurated,\r\nthey intrepidly undermined their base to make room for the passages,\r\nthe windows, and the spiral staircase. The same operation was carried\r\nout beneath the dome, which was excavated with great labour, and in\r\nsuch a manner that the great hollow vault, in conjunction with its\r\nlower platform, rested on the narrow vaults of the four arches forming\r\nthe centre and foundation of the edifice.\r\n\r\nObserve that this dome is self-sustaining, and that its substructions,\r\nstrictly speaking, would amply suffice for its support; the lateral\r\npyramids being only its not indispensable auxiliaries. Here, then,\r\nwe find the principle of a true, honest, and courageous art, which,\r\nrelying on itself and its calculations, requires no assistance from\r\nexternal supports, and needs neither props nor buttresses. It is\r\nexactly the system of Brunelleschi.\r\n\r\nWho has carried the art to such a climax? We must own that it is the\r\nsupreme of usefulness. The sharpened dome, the belfries or needles,\r\nare admirably arranged so as to resist the terrible rain-storms of the\r\ntropics. The dome keeps off the water, and assists it to flow away\r\nrapidly. If it cracked, the platform on which it leans would throw\r\nthe water, as from a roof, on to the exterior _enceinte_, which would\r\ncarry it to the ground. Hollow like a kiln, it quickly gets warmed, and\r\nabsorbs the heat; duly communicating it to the subterranean passages to\r\nhatch the eggs, and promote the comfort of a race which, being wholly\r\nnaked, prefers an elevated temperature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is a masterpiece of art, precisely because it is a masterpiece of\r\nutility. The beautiful and the useful admirably harmonize. Now one\r\nwould wish to know who _are_ these astonishing artists: we hardly dare\r\nto confess that they are the objects of our entire contempt.\r\n\r\nVarious names have been bestowed upon them; among others, that of\r\ntermites: and again, that of wood-ants,--a designation not very\r\naccurate, for the ants are their enemies, and their body, being\r\nexceedingly soft, is exactly the opposite of the dry hard body of the\r\nant.\r\n\r\nThey have been also called wood-lice; and they seem, in truth, a soft\r\nand feeble kind of vermin, which are crushed without resistance.\r\nMagnificent jest of God, who loves to exalt his humblest creatures! The\r\nMemphis, the Babylon, the true Capitol of the insects, is built--by\r\nwhom? By lice! Though their luxury of jaws, and their four stages of\r\nteeth, make them admirable rodents, nevertheless, if we except their\r\n_élite_, the soldiers, they have no important weapons. Their teeth,\r\nmade to gnaw, are powerless in combat. The destiny of the termites is\r\nplain; spite of the formidable names which have been given to their\r\nspecies (_bellicosus_, _mordax_, _atrox_), they are simply _workers_.\r\n\r\nEvery other insect is stronger than they are; or at least harder,\r\nbetter protected, and more completely armed. All, especially the ants,\r\nhunt them, and devour them by myriads. Birds greedily pursue them; the\r\npoultry-yards absorb them in frightful quantities. All (even man, who\r\ncooks them) find them of an agreeable taste; and the negro can never be\r\nsatiated with them.\r\n\r\nThey work without seeing their work. They have no eyes, at least none\r\nwhich are visible. Very probably, the darkness in which they live\r\ndestroys their ocular organs, as is the case with a species of duck\r\nfound in the subterranean lakes of Carinthia. The rare species of\r\ntermites which venture forth into the daylight have very conspicuous\r\nand perfectly formed eyes.\r\n\r\nThe darkness and the persecution to which they are exposed under the\r\nlight, seem to have developed their singular industry. Against that\r\nworld of day which shows them so bitter a hostility, they have built,\r\nas they have been able, this little world of the shadows, in which they\r\nexercise their arts. They issue forth only in search of food, and the\r\ngum and other substances of which they make their magazines.\r\n\r\nTheir attachment is extreme for these cities of darkness. They defend\r\nthem obstinately. The first blow that is given each resists in his own\r\nfashion; the workmen plastering the interior with a kind of mortar\r\nwhich closes up the holes, the soldiers attacking the assailants and\r\ndrawing blood with their sharp pincers, clinging to the wound, and\r\nsuffering themselves to be crushed rather than let go. A naked man\r\n(like the negro) shrinks under these bites, grows discouraged, and is\r\nconquered.\r\n\r\nIf you still persist, if you penetrate, you admire the palace, its\r\ncircuits, its corridors, its aërial bridges, the halls or saloons where\r\nthe population lodge, the nurseries for the eggs, the caves, cellars,\r\nor magazines. But, above all, search to the centre. There lurks the\r\nmystery of this little world; there is its palladium, its idol,\r\nincessantly surrounded by the cares of an enthusiastic crowd. A strange\r\nand shocking object, which is not the less obeyed, and visibly adored!\r\n\r\nIt is the queen, or common mother, frightfully fecund, from whose body\r\nissues an uninterrupted flood of about sixty eggs per minute, or eighty\r\nthousand eggs per day!\r\n\r\nYou can conceive of nothing more fantastic. These strange creatures,\r\nwhich we compare to vermin, have nevertheless their moment of supreme\r\npoesy, their hour of love; for a moment their wings uplift them, and\r\nalmost immediately they sink. The couples thus bereft, having neither\r\nrefuge nor strength, and no means of resistance, are a prey for all the\r\ninsects,--a manna upon which they straightway throw themselves. The\r\nworking termites, which have neither love nor wings, endeavour to save\r\na couple of the victims, welcome them,--weak, and fallen, and wretched\r\nas they are,--and make them monarchs.\r\n\r\nThey remove them to the centre of the city, and establish them in the\r\nsaloon on which all the apartments and corridors abut. There they\r\nare revived, recruited, and nourished day and night; and the female\r\ngradually assumes an enormous size, until in body and stomach she is\r\ntwo thousand times larger than her natural condition,--though, by a\r\nhideous contrast, the head does not increase. For the rest, immovable,\r\nand therefore captive, the doors through which she entered have become\r\ninfinitely too narrow to admit of the egress of such a monster.\r\nAccordingly, there she will remain, pouring out, until she splits\r\nasunder, that torrent of living matter which the termites day and night\r\ncollect, and which, to-morrow, will be the People.\r\n\r\nThis soft and whitish-looking creature, a stomach rather than a being,\r\nis at least of the size of the human thumb: a traveller pretends to\r\nhave seen one as large as a crab.\r\n\r\nThe bigger she is, the more fertile, the more inexhaustible, this\r\nterrible mother of lice seems the more enthusiastically worshipped by\r\nher fanatical vermin. She appears to be their ideal, their poetry,\r\ntheir ecstasy. If you carry them off, with a fragment, a ruin of the\r\ncity, you may see them, under a glass shade, instantly set to work to\r\nbuild an arch for the protection of the mother's venerated head, to\r\nreconstruct her royal hall, which will become, if the materials be\r\nsufficient, the centre and basis of the resuscitated community.\r\n\r\nI am not astonished, let me add, at the extravagant love which they\r\nshow towards this instrument of fecundity. If every other race did not\r\njointly labour to destroy them, this truly prodigious mother would make\r\nthem masters of the world,--nay, what do I say?--its only inhabitants.\r\nThe fish alone would survive; but the insect world would perish. It\r\nsuffices to remember that the queen-bee takes a year to accomplish\r\nwhat the termite mother accomplishes in a day. Through her means they\r\nwould swallow up Everybody; but they are feeble and savoury, and it is\r\nEverybody which swallows up them.\r\n\r\nWhen the species of termites which live and dwell in the woods\r\nunfortunately approach near our habitations, there is no means of\r\narresting their ravages. They work with a truly incredible vigour and\r\nrapidity. They have been known in one night to eat their way through\r\nthe leg of a table, then through the thickness of the table itself,\r\ndescending through the leg on the opposite side.\r\n\r\nThe reader can easily imagine the effect produced by such toil as this\r\non the joists and framework of a house. The worst of it is, that a long\r\ntime may elapse before their ravages are detected. We continue to rely\r\nupon supports which suddenly, one fine morning, crumble away; we sleep\r\npeacefully under roofs which to-morrow will cease to exist.\r\n\r\nThe town of Valencia, in New Grenada, undermined by the subterranean\r\ngalleries these insects have excavated in the earth, is now literally\r\nsuspended upon their dangerous catacombs.\r\n\r\nWe have ourselves seen, at Rochelle, the formidable beginnings of the\r\nravages they executed in the timber-work of a quarter of the town where\r\nthey were introduced by foreign ships. Whole buildings are found eaten\r\nup, though apparently sound,--all the wood hollowed and tunnelled,\r\neven to the banisters of the staircase: do not rest upon them, or they\r\nwill yield and give way under your hand. These terrible nibblers seem\r\nwilling, however, to confine themselves to one district of the town,\r\nand not to invade the remainder. Otherwise, this historical city,\r\nimportant still through its marine and its commerce, would be reduced\r\nto the condition of Herculaneum and Pompeii.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: II.--INSECTS AT WORK.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE ANTS:--THEIR DOMESTIC ECONOMY--THEIR NUPTIALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ants enjoy a superiority over all other insects, inasmuch as they\r\nare less specialized by their mode of life, their nourishment, and the\r\ninstruments of their industry. Generally, they adapt themselves to\r\nall conditions, and work in all climates; nor in all Nature do more\r\nenergetic agents in purification and cleansing exist. They are, so to\r\nsay, the factotums of Nature.\r\n\r\nThe termites, at least the majority of them, work in the darkness,\r\nunder the earth; the ants both above and below.\r\n\r\nLike the termites, they build, at least in tropical countries, the\r\nmost remarkable edifices,--domes under which their chrysalides enjoy\r\nthe warmth of the sun without being injured by its scorching rays.\r\nBut these are not fortresses; the ants have no need of them; for in\r\nthe tropical regions they are the sovereigns and tyrants of all other\r\nbeings. The exterminating _carabi_, the invading _necrophori_, which\r\nplay among us, as insects, the _rôle_ of the eagle and the vulture,\r\nscarcely venture to make their appearance in the burning latitudes\r\nwhere the ants hold sway. Everything which lies on the earth's surface\r\nthey immediately devour. Lund, in his _Mémoire sur les Fourmis_, says\r\nthat he had scarcely time to pick up a bird which he had seen drop. The\r\nants were already on the spot, and had seized upon it. The sanitary\r\npolice is performed by them with an implacable and energetic exactitude.\r\n\r\nThe great ants of the South are much more savage than our European\r\nspecies; and feeling themselves sovereigns and mistresses, feared by\r\nall, dreading none, they march forward imperturbably, without suffering\r\nany obstacle to divert their course. If a house stand in their way,\r\nthey enter, and all that is alive within it--even the enormous,\r\nvenomous, and formidable spiders, ay, and small mammiferous animals\r\nalso--is devoured. Men give place to them. And if you cannot quit your\r\nhouse, you have reason to fear their invasion. Once, at Barbadoes,\r\na long column was seen defiling for several days in formidable\r\nnumbers. All the earth was black with them, and the torrent poured\r\nforward straight in the direction of the houses. They were crushed\r\nby hundreds, without heeding their losses; myriads were destroyed,\r\nbut they continued to advance. No wall, no ditch, was of any service;\r\nwater even could not arrest their progress: for it is known that they\r\nconstruct living bridges, by fastening on to one another in clusters\r\nand garlands. Fortunately, the plan was adopted of sowing the ground in\r\nadvance of them with numerous tiny volcanoes, small heaps of gunpowder,\r\nwhich were fired at intervals beneath them, and exploding, swept away\r\nwhole files, and dispersed the rest,--covering them with fire and\r\nsmoke, and blinding them with dust. This scheme proved successful.\r\nAt least, the ants turned aside a little, and moved in a different\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLinnæus calls the termites the scourge of the two Indies; and we might\r\nequally well bestow this appellation on the ants, if we considered only\r\nthe havoc they commit among the labours and cultivation of man. In a\r\nfew hours they strip a large orangery, denuding it of every leaf. In a\r\nsingle night they devastate a field of cotton, manioc, or sugar-cane.\r\nBehold their crimes! Their virtues? they destroy to a still greater\r\nextent all things that might prove hurtful to man, and but for them\r\ncertain countries would be uninhabitable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs for our European species, I cannot see that they do the slightest\r\nharm, either to man, or to the plants he cultivates. Far from it, they\r\ndeliver him from an infinity of little insects. I have frequently seen\r\nlong files of them, with each carrying in his mouth a very small grub\r\nas a contribution to the food stores of the republic. Such a picture\r\nshould ensure them the benedictions of every honourable agriculturist.\r\n\r\nThe mason-ants, which work in and entirely under the earth, are\r\ndifficult to observe. But the \"carpenters\" may be easily followed, at\r\nleast in the upper part of their constructions. The cupola of their\r\nedifice being subject to dilapidation, they are constantly under a\r\nnecessity of repairing and re-excavating it. With the small amount of\r\nsoil which they make use of, they mix the leaves and spines of the\r\nfir, and the catkins of the pine. If they meet with a bent; twisted,\r\nand knotty twig, it is a treasure; they employ it as an arcade, or,\r\nbetter still, as an ogive; for the pointed arch is the most solid.\r\nThe numerous avenues which lead to the surface spread out in radii\r\nlike a fan; they start from a concentric point, and extend to the\r\ncircumference. The mass of the edifice is divided into low but spacious\r\napartments. The largest is in the centre and under the dome; it is also\r\nthe most elevated, and destined, apparently, for public communications.\r\nThere, at all hours, you will find a knot of busy citizens, who, by\r\nthe rapid contact of their antennæ (a kind of electric telegraph) seem\r\nto relate to one another the news, and exchange opinions or mutual\r\ndirections. It is a kind of forum.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more curious than to observe the various occupations\r\nand movements of this great people. While some, as purveyors, go in\r\nsearch of grubs, hunt insects, or collect materials, others, sedentary\r\nin their habits, attend entirely to domestic cares and the education\r\nof the young. An immense and an incessant occupation, if we may judge\r\nfrom the continual movement of the nurses round the cradles. Let but a\r\nraindrop fall, or a single sunbeam penetrate, and a general stir takes\r\nplace, a general removal of all the children of the colony, and this\r\nwith an ardour which never wearies. You may see them tenderly taking up\r\nthe big children--which weigh as much as themselves--and transferring\r\nthem from stage to stage, to rest them in a convenient position.\r\n\r\nThis scale of heat, extending over forty degrees, what is it but a\r\nthermometer?\r\n\r\nBut more remains. The cares of alimentation, of what one might call\r\n\"suckling,\" are much more complicated than among the bees. The eggs\r\nmust receive a nourishing humidity from the mouth of the nurses. The\r\nlarvæ take the beakful. And the young one which has worn through its\r\nhusk and become a nymph, would not have strength enough to emerge\r\nfrom it if the attentive guardians were not at hand to open the husk,\r\nrelease the little tenant, and initiate it into the light. In the\r\nartificial ant-hills, which we have procured for the sake of closer\r\nexamination, we have even succeeded in observing a circumstance which\r\nHuber regrets he had been unable to discover.\r\n\r\nSome light movements which the infant communicates to its\r\nswaddling-clothes give warning that its hour is come. We took great\r\npleasure in watching the nurses seated upon their hind limbs like\r\nlittle motionless, upright fairies, plainly discerning under the silent\r\nveil the first yearning for liberty.\r\n\r\nAs in every superior race, the young comes into the world weak, and\r\nfrail, and incapable of effort. Its first steps are so infirm that\r\nat every movement it falls upon its knees. It requires, as it were,\r\nto be kept in leading-strings. Its great vitality is only shown by\r\nan incessant demand for food. Therefore, when the heat is great, and\r\nnumerous swaddling-husks must be opened daily, the new-born are all\r\nlodged in the same part of the city.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEST OF RUSSET ANTS.]\r\n\r\nOne day, however, I saw a young ant thrust forth its head, still\r\nsomewhat pale, at a gate of the city, then step across the threshold,\r\nand march along the summit of the ant-hill. The escapade, however, was\r\nnot long permitted. A nurse encountering the fugitive, seized it by\r\nthe top of its head, and conducted it gently towards a neighbouring\r\nentrance.\r\n\r\nThe child resisted; it suffered itself to be dragged along, and on\r\nthe way coming in contact with a small piece of wood, profited by it\r\nto stiffen itself, and exhaust its conductor's strength. The latter,\r\nalways keeping its temper, let go for a moment, executed a flank\r\nmovement, and then returned to the charge, until its nursling, tired\r\nout, was compelled to yield obedience.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the young are strong enough, they have to be brought\r\nacquainted with the interior labyrinth of the city, the suburbs, the\r\navenues which lead to the outer world, and the neighbouring roads. Then\r\nthey are trained to hunt, are accustomed to provide for themselves, to\r\nlive hap-hazard and upon little or any kind of food. Temperance is the\r\nbasis of the whole commonwealth.\r\n\r\nThe ant, not being fastidious, but accepting all descriptions of food,\r\nis from this very cause the less anxious, restless, and selfish. It is\r\nvery wrong to call it a _miser_. Far from being so, it seems solely\r\nintent upon multiplying in its city the number of its co-partners.\r\nIn its generous maternal care of those whom it has not begotten, in\r\nits solicitude for those little ones of yesterday which to-day become\r\nyoung citizens, originates a feeling quite novel and very rare among\r\ninsects,--that of fraternity. (See the works of Latreille and Huber.)\r\n\r\nThe obscurest and most curious point of their education is,\r\nundoubtedly, the communication of language, which reminds the observer\r\nof the forms of freemasonry. It enables them to transmit really\r\ncomplicated directions to their legions, and to change in a moment the\r\nmarch of a whole column, the action of an entire populace.\r\n\r\nThis language principally consists in the touch of the antennæ, or in\r\na light collision of the mandibles. They urge (or perhaps persuade) by\r\nblows of the head against the thorax. Finally, they sometimes carry\r\noff the auditor, who makes no resistance, and transport him to some\r\ndesignated place or object. In this case, which undoubtedly is both\r\ndifficult to believe and explain, the convinced auditor unites with\r\nthe other, and both together carry off other witnesses, which in their\r\nturn perform upon others--the number continually increasing--the same\r\noperation. Our parliamentary phrases, \"to carry away the crowd,\" \"to\r\ntransport the hearer,\" are by no means mere metaphors among the ants!\r\n\r\nTo this lively gesticulation they join many other scarcely explicable\r\nmovements,--such as cavalcades, in which they march mounted one upon\r\nanother, exchanging gay defiances and light blows upon the cheeks.\r\nThen they rear themselves upright, and contend by couples, seizing\r\nupon a leg, a mandible, or an antenna. Naturalists have spoken of\r\nthese as their pastimes, but I know not what to think. Among so busy,\r\nand obviously serious a family, this gymnastic exercise has perhaps a\r\nhygienic object which we do not understand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe had so well managed our prisoners that they had become habituated\r\nto their new domicile, and toiled under our eyes as they would have\r\ndone in their own city. They rebuilt for themselves a small town in\r\nminiature, with gates whose number they carefully augmented, especially\r\non very hot days, for the purpose of giving air to their little ones,\r\nwhom they took care to place near the openings.\r\n\r\nIn the evening they conscientiously proceeded, according to their\r\ninvariable custom, to shut up the gates, as if always afraid of some\r\nnocturnal invasion of idle vagabonds. A spectacle of deep interest,\r\nwhich we frequently took occasion to enjoy in front of the great\r\nswarming ant-hills.\r\n\r\nNor could there be a more varied picture; on all sides, and at great\r\ndistances, you might see them coming in long files, each bearing some\r\nlittle article,--one a long straw, another a pretty pine nut-cup, or\r\n(according to the country) a black needle-like leaf of the fir-tree.\r\nThese, like little woodcutters returning at close of day, brought back\r\nimperceptible bundles of twigs; others, which seemed empty-handed,\r\nwere but the more heavily loaded, having just taken prisoners some\r\nwood-lice, which they carried home for the evening meal of the little\r\nones.\r\n\r\nAt the approaches of the City, the points where the ascent commenced,\r\nit was a pleasure to see the vigour, the zeal, and the ardour\r\nwith which they dragged up such heavy materials. If one let go,\r\nexhausted, two or three others succeeded. And the joist or beam, full\r\nof animation, and apparently alive, gradually ascended. Skill and\r\nforesight supplied the want of strength. If checked at any particular\r\npoint, they turned and advanced in a somewhat different direction,\r\nascending a little higher than was necessary; then they let down the\r\nweight exactly over the opening which they wished to conceal; a quick\r\nlight movement made the mass pirouette, and it fell into its place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNumerous problems in statics and mechanics were solved by a felicitous\r\naudacity and with a great economy of effort. By degrees all was\r\nsecured. The vast dome, embracing with a soft and delicate curve a\r\ngreat nation of workers in its lawful repose, offered nothing to the\r\nsight, neither door nor window, and appeared to be a simple heap of\r\ntiny fragments of fir. Do I mean that all slumbered in full confidence?\r\nIt would be wrong to think so. A few sentinels wandered to and fro; at\r\nthe lightest touch of a switch, or the rustle of a leaf, the guards\r\nwould issue forth, perambulate the exterior of their city, and when\r\nreassured would re-enter, but, undoubtedly, to continue their watch,\r\nand remain upon duty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe most surprising scene at which any one can be present is a marriage\r\nof ants.\r\n\r\nOf all follies, as everybody knows, the worst are those of the wise.\r\nThe honourable, economical, and respectable republic accordingly\r\npresents (one single day yearly, it is true) a prodigious spectacle--of\r\nlove? of madness?--we do not know, but certainly of vertigo, and\r\nto speak plainly, of terror. M. Huber saw in it the appearance of a\r\nnational holiday. What a holiday! And what a scene of intoxication! But\r\nno; nothing human can give an idea of this boiling effervescence.\r\n\r\nI watched it on one occasion, between six and seven o'clock in the\r\nevening. The day had been one of heavy showers and warm gleams of\r\nlight. The horizon was lowering, and yet the air calm. It was Nature's\r\npause before resuming her storms of rain.\r\n\r\nUpon a low sloping roof I saw descend quite a deluge of winged insects,\r\nwhich seemed stunned, confused, delirious. To describe their agitation,\r\ntheir disorderly movements, their somersaults and shocks to arrive\r\nmore quickly at the goal, would be impossible. Many rested, and loved.\r\nThe greater number whirled round and round without stopping. All were\r\nso eager to live, that their very eagerness proved an obstacle. This\r\nfeverish desire produced a feeling of alarm.\r\n\r\nA terrible idyllic poem!\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to make out what they wished. Were they enjoying\r\na festival of love? Were they devouring one another? Right through\r\nthis distraught multitude of _fiancés_ who had lost their senses\r\npassed other and wingless ants, which threw themselves without mercy\r\non the most embarrassed individuals, bit them, and treated them so\r\nseverely, that we thought we could see them crunching the lovers.\r\nBut no! They wanted nothing more than to force them to obey, and to\r\nrecall them to their senses. Their vivid pantomime was the counsel of\r\nprudence translated into action. The wingless ants were the wise and\r\nirreproachable nurses, who, having no children, bring up those of the\r\nothers, and bear all the burden of the toil and management of the city.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese virgins maintained a surveillance over the amorous and slothful,\r\nand rigidly inspected the marriage-festival as a public act, which,\r\nevery year, renews the nation. Their natural fear was lest the winged\r\nfools should be wooed and won elsewhere, and create other tribes,\r\nwithout any thought of the parent community.\r\n\r\nNumbers of the winged ones submitted, and allowed themselves to\r\nbe carried below towards their country and virtue. But many tore\r\nthemselves away, and flew afar, obedient only to the dictates of love\r\nand caprice.\r\n\r\nIt was an astonishing vision, a fantastic dream, which can never be\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nIn the morning nothing remained as a memorial of the excesses of the\r\npreceding evening, except the fragments of some severed wings, in which\r\nno one could have divined the trace of a unique _soirée d'amour_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: III.--THE ANTS: THEIR FLOCKS AND THEIR SLAVES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE ANTS:--THEIR FLOCKS AND THEIR SLAVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I learned for the first time, from the pages of Huber, the strange\r\nand prodigious fact that certain ants keep slaves, I was greatly\r\nastonished--as everybody has been by this singular revelation--but I\r\nwas especially saddened and wounded.\r\n\r\nWhat! I turn aside from the history of man in search of innocence. I\r\nhope at least to discover among the brute creation the even-handed\r\njustice of nature, the primitive rectitude of the plan of creation.\r\nI seek in this people, whom I had previously loved and esteemed for\r\ntheir laboriousness and temperateness, the severe and touching image of\r\nrepublican virtues--and I find among them this thing without a name!\r\n\r\nWhat a joy, what a triumph for the partisans of slavery, for all the\r\nfriends of evil! Hell and tyranny, laugh ye, and make merry! A black\r\nspot is revealed in the brightness of Nature.\r\n\r\nI had flung aside Huber, and no book had ever seemed to me more\r\nhateful. Pardon, illustrious observer! your grandfather and your father\r\nhad enraptured and charmed me. The first of the clan--Huber, the great\r\nhistorian of the bees--has inspired with new warmth the religion of\r\nman, and lifted up his heart. But Huber of the ants has broken mine.\r\n\r\nIt was, nevertheless, a duty to resume my perusal of his work, and\r\nexamine it more attentively. An immoral, a Machiavellian, and a\r\nperverse insect is worthy of investigation.\r\n\r\nBut, in the first place, let us make a distinction. A portion of these\r\npretended slaves may only be cattle.\r\n\r\nIt is enough to look at the ants, thin to an excess, brilliant, and\r\nvarnished, to conclude that they are the driest and most parched of\r\nbeings. Their singular acridity has been established by chemical\r\nresearches, and science has contrived to extract the mordant formic\r\nacid from their bodies. Sometimes, when they are in peril, they hurl\r\nit at their enemies like a venom. Not a few species employ it in\r\ndrying, blackening, and almost burning the trees where they establish\r\ntheir abodes. Is not a substance so corrosive for others equally\r\ndangerous to themselves? I should be tempted to think so, and to this\r\nextreme acridity should attribute their greediness for honey and other\r\nlubricating substances. I submit my hypothesis to the consideration of\r\nthe scientific.\r\n\r\nThe ants of Mexico, in a specially favoured climate, have two classes\r\nof workmen,--one charged with the duty of seeking provisions; the\r\nother, inactive and sedentary, entrusted with the work of elaborating\r\nthem, and making out of them a kind of honey for the common nourishment.\r\n\r\nThe ants of our temperate climates, for the most part incapable of\r\nmaking honey, satisfy their imperative need of it by licking the\r\nhoney-dew found upon certain grubs, which, without labour, by the mere\r\nfact of their organization, extract saccharine juices from all species\r\nof plants. The transmission of this honey to the ants is effected\r\nquietly, and, as it were, by mutual agreement.\r\n\r\nIt operates by a kind of titillation or gentle traction, such as we\r\nexercise upon the cow. These grubs, placed at the extreme limit of\r\nanimal life--viviparous in summer, oviparous in autumn--are very humble\r\ncreatures, and prodigiously inferior in intelligence to the ants. The\r\nmagnifying-glass reveals them to the observer as always bent, and\r\nalways engaged in feeding. Their attitude is that of the cattle. They\r\nare, in truth, the milch-cows of the ants; and that they may always\r\nprofit by them, the latter frequently transport them to their ant-hill,\r\nwhere they live together on admirably good terms. The ants take great\r\ncare of the grubs, superintend the incubation, and nourish the adults\r\nwith their favourite vegetables.\r\n\r\nIn situations where great difficulty would be experienced in\r\ntransporting and installing them, they empark them on the ground\r\nby throwing up around their field of pasture a fence of twigs and\r\ncylinders of earth. This may justly be termed the grazing-field, the\r\n_chalet_ of the ants; which repair to it at certain hours to milk\r\ntheir herds, and sometimes carry their young thither for the easier\r\ndistribution of the food. I am frequently present, especially in the\r\nevening, at these Dutch-like scenes, which have hitherto found no Paul\r\nPotter among the ants to depict them.\r\n\r\nObserve that these grubs, whether transported to the ant-hill or\r\nemparked on their favourite feeding-ground, possess the inestimable\r\nadvantage of having their safety guaranteed by the redoubtable\r\nrepublic. The \"lion of the grubs\" (as a small worm is called), and\r\nother wild beasts, if they dared approach the herd, would feel very\r\ncruelly their strong mandibles and burning formic acid.\r\n\r\nSo far, then, we have no reproach to make; the grubs are cattle, and\r\nnot slaves. The ants do exactly what we do; they make use of the\r\nprivilege of superior beings, but exercise it with more gentleness and\r\nmanagement than does man.\r\n\r\nBut we now come to a more delicate consideration. There are two\r\nkinds of ants, of a tolerable size, but otherwise of no peculiar\r\ndistinction, which employ as servants, nurses, and cooks, certain\r\nsmall ants endowed with more skill and ingenuity.\r\n\r\nThis strange fact, which ought apparently to change our ideas of animal\r\nmorality, was discovered early in the present century. Pierre Huber,\r\nthe son of the celebrated observer of the manners and habits of bees,\r\nwalking one day in a field near Geneva, saw on the ground a strong\r\ndetachment of reddish-coloured ants on the march, and bethought himself\r\nof following them. On the flanks of the column, as if to dress its\r\nranks, a few speed to and fro in eager haste. After marching for about\r\na quarter of an hour, they halt before an ant-hill belonging to the\r\nsmall black ant, and a desperate struggle takes place at its gates.\r\n\r\nA small number of the blacks offer a brave resistance; but the great\r\nmajority of the people thus assailed flee through the gates remotest\r\nfrom the scene of combat, carrying away their young. It was just these\r\nwhich were the cause of the strife; what the blacks most justly feared\r\nwas the theft of their offspring. And soon the assailants, who had\r\nsucceeded in penetrating into, the city, might be seen emerging from it\r\nloaded with the young black progeny. It was an exact resemblance of a\r\ndescent of slave-dealers on the coast of Africa.\r\n\r\nThe red ants, encumbered with their living booty, left the unfortunate\r\ncity in the desolation of its great loss, and resumed the road to\r\ntheir own habitation, whither their astonished and almost breathless\r\nobserver followed them. But how was his astonishment augmented when, at\r\nthe-threshold of the red ants' community, a small population of black\r\nants came forward to receive the plunder, welcoming with visible joy\r\nthese children of their own race, which, undoubtedly, would perpetuate\r\nit in the foreign land.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is a mixed city, where the strong warrior-ants live in a\r\nperfectly good understanding with the little blacks. But what do the\r\nlatter? Huber speedily discovered that, in effect, they do everything.\r\nThey alone build; they alone bring up the young red ants and the\r\ncaptives of their own species; they alone administer the affairs of the\r\ncommunity, provide its supplies of food, wait upon and nourish their\r\nred masters, who, like great infant giants, indolently allow their\r\nlittle attendants to feed them at the mouth. No other occupations\r\nare theirs but war, theft, and kidnapping. No other movements in the\r\nintervals than to wander about lazily, and bask in the sunshine at the\r\ndoor of their barracks.\r\n\r\nThe most curious circumstance is, that these civilized helots really\r\nlove their great barbarous warriors, and carefully tend their children,\r\ngladly and cheerfully perform their tasks of servitude, and, more,\r\nencourage the extension of their slavery and the abduction of the\r\nlittle blacks. Does not all this wear the appearance of a free adhesion\r\nto the established order of things?\r\n\r\nAnd who knows but that the joy and pride of governing the strong and\r\ntyrannizing over their tyrants, may be for the little blacks an inner\r\nliberty--an exquisite and sovereign freedom--far superior to any\r\npleasure they could have derived from the equality of their native\r\ncountry?\r\n\r\nHuber made an experiment. He was desirous of observing what would be\r\nthe result if the great red ants found themselves without servants, and\r\nif they would know how to supply their own wants. He thought, perhaps,\r\nthat the degenerate creatures might be inspired and uplifted by the\r\nmaternal love which is so strong among the ants.\r\n\r\nHe put a few into a glass case, and with them some _nymphs_.\r\nInstinctively they began to move them about and to cradle them\r\nafter their fashion; but soon discovered (big and robust as they,\r\nnevertheless, were) that the weight was too much for them; they\r\naccordingly left them on the ground, and coolly abandoned them. In\r\ntruth, they abandoned themselves. Huber put some honey for them in a\r\ncorner, so that they had nothing to do but to take it. Miserable the\r\ndegradation, cruel the punishment with which slavery afflicts the\r\nenslavers! They did not touch it; they seemed to know nothing; they had\r\nbecome so grossly ignorant and indolent that they could no longer feed\r\nthemselves. Some of them died from starvation, with food before them!\r\n\r\nHuber, to complete the experiment, then introduced into the case one\r\nblack ant. The presence of this sagacious helot changed the face of\r\nthings, and re-established life and order. He went straight to the\r\nhoney; he fed the great dying simpletons; he dug a hole in the ground,\r\nplaced in it the eggs, prepared the incubation, watched over the\r\nnymphs (or _maillots_), and restored to life and happiness the little\r\npeople, who, becoming industrious in their turn, seconded the efforts\r\nof their nurse. Felicitous influence of genius! A single individual had\r\nre-created the city.\r\n\r\nThe observer then understood that with such a superiority of\r\nintelligence these helots might, in reality, wear the chains of\r\nservitude very lightly, and perhaps govern their masters. A persevering\r\nstudy proved to him that such was, indeed, the case. The little blacks\r\nin many things carry a moral authority whose signs are very visible;\r\nthey do not, for example, permit the great red ants to go out alone on\r\nuseless expeditions, and compel them to return into the city. Nor are\r\nthey even at liberty to go out in a body, if their wise little helots\r\ndo not think the weather favourable, if they fear a storm, or if the\r\nday is far advanced. When an excursion proves unsuccessful, and they\r\nreturn without children, the little blacks are stationed at the gates\r\nof the city to forbid their ingress, and send them back to the combat;\r\nnay more, you may see them take the cowards by the collar, and force\r\nthem to retrace their route.\r\n\r\nThese are astounding facts; but such as they are, they were seen by our\r\nillustrious observer. He could not trust his eyes, and summoned one of\r\nthe greatest naturalists of Sweden--M. Jurine--to his side, to make new\r\ninvestigations, and decide whether he had been deceived. This witness,\r\nand others who afterwards pursued the same course of experiments, found\r\nthat his discoveries were entirely accurate.\r\n\r\nYet--shall I dare to confess it?--after all these weighty testimonies\r\nI still doubted. Let me say, I _hoped_ that the fact, without\r\nbeing absolutely false, had not been correctly observed. But on a\r\ncertain occasion I saw it--with my own eyes saw it--in the park of\r\nFontainebleau. I was accompanied by an illustrious philosopher, an\r\nexcellent observer, and he too saw exactly what I saw.\r\n\r\nIt was half-past four in the afternoon of a very warm day. From a\r\npile of stones emerged a column of from four to five hundred red or\r\nreddish ants, precisely the same colour as the wing-cases of the\r\ngnat. They marched rapidly towards a piece of turf, kept in order by\r\ntheir sergeants or \"pivot-men,\" whom we saw on the flanks, and who\r\nwould not permit any one to straggle. (This is a circumstance known to\r\neverybody who has seen a file of ants on the march.) But the novel and\r\nastonishing thing to me was, that gradually those who were at the head\r\ndrew near to each other, and advanced only by turning; they passed and\r\nrepassed the whirling crowd, describing concentric circles; a manoeuvre\r\nevidently fit to produce enthusiasm, and to augment energy,--each, by\r\ncontact, electrifying himself with the ardour of all.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the revolving mass seemed to sink and disappear. There was no\r\nsign of ant-hills in the turf; but after a while we detected an almost\r\nimperceptible orifice, through which we saw them vanish in less time\r\nthan it takes me to write these words. We asked ourselves if it was an\r\nentrance to their domicile; if they had re-entered their city. In a\r\nminute at the utmost they gave us a reply, and showed us our mistake.\r\nThey issued in a throng, each carrying a nymph on its mandibles.\r\n\r\nFrom the short time they had taken, it was evident that they had a\r\nprevious knowledge of the localities, the place where the eggs were\r\ndeposited, the time when they were to assemble, and the degree of\r\nresistance they had to expect. Perhaps it was not their first journey.\r\n\r\nThe little blacks on whom the red ants made this _razzia_ sallied out\r\nin considerable numbers; and I truly pitied them. They did not attempt\r\nto fight. They seemed frightened and stunned. They only endeavoured to\r\ndelay the ravishers by clinging to them. A red ant was thus arrested;\r\nbut another red one, who was free, relieved him of his burden, and\r\nthereupon the black ant relaxed his grasp. In fine, it was a pitiful\r\nscene for the blacks. They offered no serious resistance. The five\r\nhundred red ants succeeded in carrying off nearly three hundred\r\nchildren. At two or three feet from the hole, the blacks ceased to\r\npursue them, abandoned all hope, and resigned themselves to their fate.\r\nAll this did not occupy ten minutes between the departure and the\r\nreturn. The two parties were very unequal. It was evidently a facile\r\nabuse of strength,--very probably an outrage often repeated,--a tyranny\r\nof the great, who levied a tribute of children from their poor little\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLet us now endeavour to understand this shocking and hideous fact.\r\nIt is peculiar to certain species; it is a particular incident, an\r\nexceptional case, yet related on the whole to a general law of the\r\nlife of the ants. Their societies are founded on the principle of the\r\n_division of labour_, and the _speciality of functions_. The ant-hill,\r\nin its normal state, comprehends, as we know, three classes:--\r\n\r\n1st. The great multitude, composed of laborious virgins, who confine\r\nthemselves to the love of the children of the commonwealth, and perform\r\nall the work of the community;\r\n\r\n2nd. The fecund females, feeble, soft, and, unintelligent; and,\r\n\r\n3rd. Some little shrivelled males, who are born only to die.\r\n\r\nThe first class is, in truth and reality, the people. But in this\r\npeople you find two industrial divisions, two great bodies of workmen.\r\nThe one executes all the more arduous tasks, such as the transportation\r\nof heavy burdens, and the far and perilous hunt after provisions,--and,\r\nat need, carry on war. The other, nearly always at home, receives\r\nthe materials, superintends the domestic economy, and undertakes the\r\nprincipal duty of the republic,--the education of the young.\r\n\r\nThe two corporations, that of the purveyors and warriors,--that of the\r\nnurses and tutors,--are, in every tribe, of unequal size, but identical\r\nin species, colour, and organization.\r\n\r\nBetween the big warriors and the little industrials the moral equality\r\nseems perfect. If there were any difference, we should say that the\r\nclass of the little ants, who build up the city and train up the\r\npeople, is the more important, the life, genius, and soul of the state;\r\nthe one which of itself could, at need, constitute the republic.\r\n\r\nM. Huber has discovered two species (the red-brown and red) who do\r\nnot possess this essential class, this fundamental element of the ant\r\ncommunities. It would not surprise us if the accessory or warrior\r\nclass were wanting. But here, in reality, it is the basis which we\r\nfind deficient,--the vital foundation,--the _raison d'être_. We are,\r\ntherefore, not so much astonished at the depraved resource by which\r\nthese red ants subsist, as at the monstrous lacuna which compels them\r\nto adopt it.\r\n\r\nThere is a mystery in the matter which we cannot at present explain,\r\nbut which would probably be cleared up if we could arrive at a\r\nknowledge of the general history of the species, its changes, and\r\nmigrations. Who does not know the modification effected in animals,\r\nboth externally and internally, in their forms and their manners, by\r\nthe displacements they undergo? Who, for example, would recognize\r\nthe brother of our bull-dog--of the St. Bernard--of the giant dog of\r\nPersia, which could strangle lions--in that abortion, the Havannah dog,\r\nso weak and frail, that even in a torrid climate Nature has clothed it\r\nwith a thick fleece, which conceals it, and converts it into an enigma?\r\n\r\nThe animal, when transplanted, may become a monster.\r\n\r\nThe ants also may have had their revolutions, their moral and physical\r\nchanges, in proportion, as the globe, everywhere becoming inhabitable,\r\nhas favoured their migrations. Several species, in the beautiful\r\nAmerican climates, have preserved the honey-making industry; our own\r\nare ignorant of it, and are compelled to have recourse to the grubs;\r\nthence arises an art and a progress,--the art of breeding, preserving,\r\nand pasturing cattle.\r\n\r\nSome species may have advanced, others retrograded. And it is thus I\r\nshould explain the kidnapping habits of the red ants. Probably they\r\nbelong to expatriated and demoralized classes--fragments of decayed\r\ncommunities which have lost their arts,--and which could not live but\r\nfor this barbarous and desperate method of slavery. They no longer\r\npossess the artistic and teaching class, without which all peoples\r\nperish. Reduced to a military career, they could not live two days if\r\nthey did not take unto themselves _souls_. Therefore, that they may not\r\nperish, they carry off the little black souls, which tend them, it is\r\ntrue, but also govern them. And this not only in the city itself, but\r\nin its external relations,--deciding or adjourning their expeditions,\r\nand regulating their campaigns; while the red, far from regulating the\r\naffairs of peace, do not seem even to comprehend them.\r\n\r\nSingular triumph of intelligence! Invincible power of genius!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IV.--EXTERMINATION OF THE COMMUNITY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE ANTS:--CIVIL WAR--EXTERMINATION OF THE COMMUNITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the tyrant's punishment that he could not, even if he would,\r\neasily deliver his captive. So long as my nightingale sings, I know\r\nthat he cares little for his cage, and I bear his captivity lightly;\r\nbut when the time of song has gone by, I share his melancholy, and the\r\nquestion again and again recurs to my mind, \"How can I release him?\" He\r\nno longer knows how to fly; in truth, is almost without wings. If I set\r\nhim free, he would perish before he had gone two steps. The liberties\r\nwhich he takes at Paris in a large chamber, and here, at Fontainebleau,\r\nin a small garden, are, really, of but little importance. He does not\r\nprofit by them; almost always remains concealed in a gooseberry-bush,\r\ndreaming and listening. The strains he hears,--the lively songs of the\r\nwarblers, the voices of love and, maternity,--augment, I believe, his\r\nsadness; so much so, that here, in the open air, under the blue sky,\r\nenjoying a relative degree of freedom, he loses his appetite, and will\r\neat no longer. We bethought ourselves of giving him his natural diet,\r\nand of feeding him with the insects on which he lives in the woods. But\r\nhere is another difficulty. Who would not shrink from hunting after\r\nand carrying living victims to be devoured? We preferred to give him\r\ninsects _in futuro_, the eggs of insects, and inert sleeping nymphæ. We\r\ncarried on a traffic in them at Fontainebleau, where our aristocratic\r\npheasants, a feudal race, do not deign to eat anything but ants' eggs.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 8th of June, there was brought to me from the\r\nforest a great clod of earth, mixed with dry twigs, and especially with\r\ntiny _débris_ of the Northern trees, such as the needles of the firs,\r\nor little prickly leaves resembling thorns.\r\n\r\nIn the midst, the inhabitants pell-mell, of every size and grade, eggs,\r\nlarvæ, nymphæ, diminutive artisans, great ants, which seemed to be\r\nwarriors and defenders; finally, a few females which had just assumed\r\ntheir wedding garments, the wings which they wear for the moment\r\nof love. Thus it turned out to be a very complete specimen of the\r\nrepublic, varied, but well distinguished by one identical sign,--all\r\nthis brownish-coloured populace having on their corselets a dull red\r\nspot. As for the classes and professions of the ants, they were easily\r\ncharacterized by their very habitations, notwithstanding the general\r\nconfusion. They were carpenter-ants, of the species which prop the\r\nupper stories of their buildings with timber framework.\r\n\r\nThough their situation was so completely altered, my ants were in no\r\nwise prostrated. They continued their different tasks, of which the\r\nprincipal was, to protect the eggs and nymphæ from the action of a too\r\npowerful sun.\r\n\r\nThe general commotion had flung them out of their subterranean cradles,\r\nand exposed them on the surface. The little ants busied themselves\r\nactively in rectifying the disorder. The great ones went and came, and\r\ncircled about a great earthen vase which contained the dismembered\r\nfragment of the republic. They marched with a firm step, and recoiled\r\nbefore no obstacles. We could not frighten them. If we placed in their\r\nway any impediment,--a bit of twig or our finger,--they crouched upon\r\ntheir loins, manoeuvred with great address their tiny arms, and patted\r\nus like a young kitten.\r\n\r\nIn their revolutions around our vase, they encountered upon the sand\r\nsome ashy-black ants which had taken possession of our garden, and\r\nconstructed underneath its soil a large establishment. The latter do\r\nnot have recourse to timber, but build in masonry,--cementing the earth\r\nwith their saliva, and drying and seasoning it with their formic acid.\r\n\r\nThe spot was rendered peculiarly agreeable to them by its rose trees,\r\napple and peach trees, which furnished them with abundant herds of\r\ngnats, that they might extract honey-dew for themselves and their\r\nlittle ones.\r\n\r\nThe rencontre was not very friendly. Though among the big carpenters\r\nwere some ants of a sufficiently diminutive stature, they wholly\r\ndiffered from the black through their long legs and the red-spotted\r\ncorselet. They were pitiless. Perhaps they suspected the blacks had\r\nbeen sent out as spies, to explore the ground, and lay snares for the\r\nemigrant colony which had just been disembarked. At all events, the big\r\ncarpenters slew the little masons.\r\n\r\nThe act was followed by terrible and wholly unexpected results. Our\r\nvase was unfortunately placed near an apple-tree covered with those\r\nwoolly grubs which are the despair of the gardener and the joy of the\r\nants. Our masons had just taken possession of the precious sugary herd,\r\nand encamped themselves in the very roots of the tree, within reach of\r\nthe invaluable booty. There they were, under the ground, a complete\r\nnation, an infinite number.\r\n\r\nThe massacre took place about twelve o'clock. At a quarter past eleven,\r\nor a little later, all the black legions were warned, aroused, erect,\r\nand ascending from their subterraneous habitations, poured out through\r\nevery gate. The sand was hidden beneath the long black columns; our\r\npaths were all alive. The sun, shining full upon the little garden,\r\nstimulated and burned up the multitude, which only quickened their\r\npace. Living always underground, they have necessarily a very\r\nsusceptible brain. The furious heat, and especially their fear lest the\r\ninvading giants should pounce upon their families, impelled them to\r\nconfront death unflinchingly.\r\n\r\nAnd a death which seemed certain; for each of the big carpenters, as\r\nfar as size and thews were concerned, was well worth eight or ten of\r\nthe little masons. At the first collision we saw a big ant fall upon a\r\nbrown dwarf, and annihilate it at one blow.\r\n\r\nThe masons, however, had the advantage of numbers. But what of\r\nthat? Suppose the front ranks were checked in the assault, and\r\nperished,--then the second, then the third,--if the army, still\r\nadvancing, did but furnish the enemy with new victims? Such was our\r\napprehension. All our fear was for the little aborigines of our\r\ngarden, disturbed by that invasion of a foreign people which we had\r\nbrought upon them,--a people ill-bred and brutal, which, without\r\nany provocation, had marked their first arrival by slaughtering the\r\ninhabitants of the country.\r\n\r\nBut it must be acknowledged that we had compared only the material\r\nforces of the two armies, and had not taken into account their moral\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nWe recognized at the first onset an astonishing amount of skill and\r\nintelligence on the part of the little blacks. By sixes, they seized\r\nupon one of their gigantic opponents, each holding and neutralizing\r\na claw; then two leaped on its back, and firmly grasped its antennæ,\r\nuntil the giant, bound in every limb, was reduced to an inert body. It\r\nseemed to lose its senses; to grow dull and stupid; no longer to be\r\nconscious of its enormous superiority of strength. Others then rushed\r\nto the attack, and, without incurring any danger, stabbed him above and\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nThe scene, regarded from a near point of view, was frightful. Whatever\r\nadmiration the little ones merited for their heroic courage, their\r\nfury made one shudder. It was impossible to see without a feeling of\r\npity these poor garotted giants, dragged miserably to and fro,--fired\r\nat from right and left,--floating as in an open sea on these billows\r\nof rage and impetuosity,--blind, powerless, and incapable of\r\nresistance,--like lambs beneath the butcher's knife.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe longed to separate them. But how was it to be done? We were in\r\nthe presence of infinity. A man's strength was nothing when tested\r\nagainst such multitudes. We might have proceeded to the extremity of\r\na universal deluge,--a moment's _noyade_[P]--but even this would have\r\nproved insufficient. They would not have let go their death-grasp; and\r\nwhen the torrent had flowed by, the massacre would have continued. The\r\nsole remedy, and an atrocious one--worse even than the evil--would\r\nhave been to have burned alive, with a wisp of flaming straw, the two\r\ncontending hosts, the conquerors and the conquered.\r\n\r\n[Footnote P: The wholesale drownings which took place at Lyons during\r\nthe Reign of Terror were known as _noyades_.--Translator.]\r\n\r\nWe were particularly struck by the fact that, after all, it was only a\r\nvery few of the big ants that were garotted and captured; and that if\r\nthose which remained free had fallen upon the assailants, they might\r\neasily have wrought a frightful carnage, their action being so rapid,\r\nand one blow inflicting death. But no such idea occurred to them.\r\nThey ran hither and thither in a panic of fear, and rushed into the\r\nvery throes of danger, into the thickest press of the hostile masses.\r\nAlas, they were not only vanquished, but seemed to have lost their\r\nsenses! While the little ants, feeling themselves at home, on their\r\nnative soil, showed so firm a front, the gigantic foreigners,--without\r\nany stake in the ground,--a desperate fragment of an annihilated\r\ncity,--wholly ignorant of the country whither they had been\r\ntransplanted,--recognized that everything was antagonistic to them,\r\nthat a snare was hidden at every step, that no refuge was open to their\r\nscattered forces. Ah, woful condition of a people whose fatherland has\r\nperished, and who have lost their gods!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYes, I excuse them. We ourselves were almost terrified at the sight\r\nof those legions of death,--that formidable army of little black\r\nskeletons which had all escaladed the earthen vase, and in that\r\nconfined region, choked and burning, crowded and furious, mounted one\r\nupon another. As the discomfiture of the giants became a thing assured,\r\nhorrible appetites were revealed among the blacks. An opportune moment\r\narrived. It was a dramatic stroke! In their mute but terribly eloquent\r\npantomime, we heard this cry: \"Their young ones are fat!\"\r\n\r\nThe gluttonous army of the lean threw themselves on the children. The\r\nlatter, belonging to a superior race, were sufficiently heavy; and\r\nmore, their oblong nymph-like envelope, round and smooth, offered no\r\npoints of vantage. Two, three, four little blacks, by combining their\r\nefforts, succeeded, though not without difficulty, in carrying a single\r\none of these up the smooth sides of the earthen vase. Then they came\r\nabruptly to a terrible resolve,--to seize upon the _maillots_, to bear\r\noff the naked children. It was no easy matter, for the little one clung\r\nstoutly, and its interwoven limbs were, so to speak, soldered together;\r\nin such wise that this violent and sudden development could only be\r\neffected by severe wounds,--in fact, by quartering them. The black ants\r\nthen carried them off, torn and palpitating.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of this kidnapping of children, we had expected\r\nto see some such spectacle as a _razzia_ of slaves, which is only too\r\ncommon among both men and ants. But we now understood that something\r\nmore was meditated. In drawing them cruelly from their outer coat,\r\nwhich is to them the very necessity of life, it became too evident that\r\ntheir captors cared very little whether they lived or did not live. It\r\nwas for their flesh they seized them; as a tender prey for the young\r\nones they had left at home, the fat children being delivered up alive\r\nto the furious appetites of the lean!\r\n\r\nTo understand the horror of the scene, you must know the true nature\r\nof the large eggs of the ants,--improperly called eggs, but in reality\r\ntheir nymphs or chrysalides,--diminutive organized ants which, under a\r\nthin veil, strengthen their tender, delicate, and still soft existence.\r\nThey remain in this envelope for the purpose of accomplishing a\r\nprogress of successive solidification and colouring.\r\n\r\nThe very fine and wonderfully soft web which they weave for themselves\r\nis, as we know, of a dull white, lightly shaded with a delicate yellow,\r\nwhich, when stronger, turns into a nankeen tint. Open it shortly\r\nbefore the emergence of the perfect insect, and you find a being of\r\nexactly the same colour, all folded and rolled up in itself like the\r\nhuman embryo in its mother's womb. When stretched out, the aspect of\r\nthe future ant is easily recognized, but it singularly differs from it\r\nin character: the head is quite innocent; lift up the antennæ, which,\r\nin this condition, resemble ears, and the young white head reminds\r\nyou of that of a little white rabbit. The eyes alone,--two black\r\npoints,--marked with sufficient prominency, indicate the next stage of\r\ncolouring. For the rest, there is nothing to forewarn you that this\r\nlittle, weak, and denuded animal, so touching and so interesting, will\r\nbecome in a few days the black being so full of energy, so keen with\r\nlife, so fierce in blood, which will traverse the earth in a fury of\r\nlabour and burning activity.\r\n\r\nOne comprehends that in this stage of existence the milky and succulent\r\nnymphs of the ants will prove a very appetizing dish for the bird, and\r\nfor the infinite number of creatures which hunt them greedily.\r\n\r\nI have dissected only one nymph in the last days of its nymph-period,\r\nand when near its time of hatching. But that one was sufficient. The\r\nsight (seen through a lens of twelve times magnifying power) was very\r\npainful. The being was completely formed, and already black on the\r\nbelly, yellow on the corselet. The head was intelligent, like that of\r\nan old ant, but pale, and changing from yellow to black. Still weak\r\nand heavy, and seized, as it were, with vertigo, it rolled from right\r\nto left, and from left to right, with a singular effect of somnolence\r\nand pain. You might have supposed it to be saying: \"Ah me! so soon!\r\nWhy hast thou called me so cruelly, before the proper hour, from my\r\nsoft cradle to the harsh drudgery of life? But it is all at end for\r\nme!\" It struggled nevertheless to confront the unknown chances of its\r\nnovel situation, and to disengage its trammelled limbs. The antennæ\r\nwere already perfectly free, and stirred about in their anxiety to\r\ndiscern the new world; this cerebral organ revealed very plainly\r\nthe disquietude and agitation of the brain. Its greatest perplexity\r\narose from its failure to release its two arms (or anterior limbs).\r\nIt laboured violently to do so. They were glued to the body by an\r\nindescribable something which might be called a pale blood, and one\r\nsweated to see the poor little creature, already prudent and timid,\r\nunable to complete its offensive arrangements, and to extricate\r\n(apparently to snatch or pluck away) its two bleeding arms.\r\n\r\nI have explained this at some length, in order to make the reader\r\nunderstand the passionate interest felt by the ants in the little\r\nballs which, to our eyes, seem so insignificant. Beneath its soft and\r\ntransparent tissue they feel the infant palpitating under its two\r\ntouching forms,--the creature, denuded and innocent, which dreameth\r\nstill--the creature already formed and intelligent, perceiving\r\neverything, but incapable of self-defence, and, before it sees the\r\nlight, disturbed by all the fears and agitations of existence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe most painful shock for the young of the insects is the sudden\r\ncold; at least, the nudity, the exposure to the air and light. This\r\nis so antipathetic and painful to them, that in certain species it is\r\nthe source of their arts and their most ingenious devices. The eggs\r\nand nymphs of the ants in their tiny transparent swaddling-robe,--and\r\nstill more the larvæ which are deprived of it,--feel with an excessive\r\nsensibility every atmospheric variation. Hence the delicate and\r\ncontinual attentions of their nurses in carrying them from place to\r\nplace, in translating them from one to another of the well-contrived\r\nsteps of their thirty or forty stories, in protecting their dear little\r\nchilly charge from cold, damp, or excessive heat. A degree more or less\r\nmeans for it life or death.\r\n\r\nIt is a cruel and tragical change for these children of love,\r\nspoiled hitherto with excessive indulgence, and tended with greater\r\ncare than any princess, when they are abruptly deprived of their\r\ngarments,--stripped, with blows from pincers, teeth, and claws,--and\r\ndespoiled by the hands of the executioner. Suddenly exposed to the\r\nburning sun, dragged hither, pushed thither, rolled over all the\r\nroughnesses of a coarse sandy soil,--sensible, infinitely sensible,\r\nin their new condition of nakedness, to the shocks, blows, and rude\r\nsomersaults which their violent enemies do not spare them!\r\n\r\nIn towns captured by a furious enemy, it has happened that the tombs\r\nof the dead have been desecrated. But here, we behold the exhumation of\r\nthe living,--the despoiling of innocent and all vulnerable creatures,\r\npoor bits of skinless flesh, to whom the very lightest touch had been a\r\nsufficient agony!\r\n\r\nThis immense execution upon the population and their young was hurried\r\nover so rapidly, that at three o'clock in the afternoon nearly all was\r\nended; the city was sacked and depopulated in every corner, and its\r\nfuture beyond all hope of a resurrection.\r\n\r\nWe thought that some fugitive might still be lurking in concealment;\r\nthat perhaps the conquerors would abandon the desert if we transported\r\nthem, with the destroyed city, into a paved coach-yard outside the\r\ngarden; that then would awake in them the remembrance of their family,\r\nto whom, moreover, they could carry nothing more to be devoured. Our\r\nexpectation was realized.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 10th of June we saw them scattered along all the\r\nroads which led towards their dwelling-place, at the other end of the\r\ngarden. But the destiny of the vanquished seemed accomplished. The dead\r\nand silent city was nothing but a cemetery, where, with the exception\r\nof a few scattered bodies, could only be seen some dead wood, some\r\nold pods of Northern trees, and their gloomy _aiguilles_ (pines and\r\nonce-green firs), not less dead than the city itself.\r\n\r\nI confess that such a vengeance, so disproportionate to the act\r\nwhich was its cause or pretext, excited in me a strong feeling of\r\nindignation, and my heart, changing sides, was completely alienated\r\nfrom those little black barbarians.\r\n\r\nSo, observing that some of them, still implacable, were promenading\r\namong the ruins, I sent them rudely flying over its walls (that is, the\r\nedges of the vase). In vain it was gently pointed out to me that these\r\nblacks had been provoked, that they had shown the greatest courage,\r\nhaving braved so great a peril that their destruction might almost have\r\nbeen predicted. They were cruel and savage but heroic tribes, like the\r\nIroquois, the Hurons, the revengeful heroes who formerly peopled the\r\nforests of the Mississippi and Canada. These reasons were good, but\r\ndid not calm me. I felt too keenly the enormity of the crime. Without\r\nwishing to annihilate them, I confess that if these ferocious blacks\r\nhad chanced to come under my foot I should not have turned aside.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate empty vase continually reminded me of what had\r\noccurred, and held me as by a spell. On the evening of the 11th we\r\nwere still seated on the ground before it, with our chin in our hand,\r\ncompletely absorbed in thought. Our gaze plunged into its depths. We\r\npersisted in longing for a sign of life to appear upon its perfect\r\nimmobility, a something which might still say that all was not\r\nfinished. This firm resolve seemed to have the potency of an evocation,\r\nand as if our desires had recalled to daylight some miserable spirit\r\nof the widowed city, one of the victims which had escaped made its\r\nappearance, and hurried headlong away from the field of death. And we\r\nperceived that it carried a cradle.\r\n\r\nNight came, and it was in a completely strange locality, surrounded by\r\nenemies. A few holes, which one might mistake for places of refuge,\r\nwere precisely the mouths opening into the Inferno of the blacks. The\r\nunhappy fugitive, with its misfortune increased by the burden of its\r\ninfant, ran distractedly, and without knowing whither. I followed it\r\nwith my eyes and heart, until the darkness concealed it from me.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: V.--THE WASPS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE WASPS: THEIR FURY OF IMPROVISATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the wasp on a summer's day enters at the window, with its loud,\r\naggressive, and menacing _zou! zou! zou!_ everybody is on his guard.\r\nThe child trembles, the mother suspends her work, even the husband\r\nlifts his eyes: \"Insolent, impudent intruder!\" and he arms himself with\r\na handkerchief.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the superb insect, having flown into every corner, and cast\r\naround the room a rapid and scornful glance, departs with a loud noise,\r\nnot condescending to notice the unfriendly welcome accorded to him.\r\nHis only reflection has been this: \"A paltry house! Not a fruit, not a\r\nspider, not a fly, not the smallest bit of meat!\"\r\n\r\nThen he makes a descent on the shop of the country butcher: \"Butcher,\r\nmy custom is yours. I am desirous of dealing with you. Do not hesitate,\r\nfoolish miser. Cut me a good slice of meat, and I will pay you for it;\r\nI will kill all your flesh-flies. Let us agree to be friends. We are\r\nboth born to kill.\"\r\n\r\nThe slow dull animals of the genus _Man_ are much scandalized at the\r\nproceedings of the wasp. It acts, it does not talk. But if it deigned\r\nto speak, its apology would be simple. A word would suffice. It is\r\nthe being on whom Nature imposes the terrible destiny of suppressing\r\ntime. We speak of the ephemera which lives a few hours: the period is\r\nsufficient for a creature that does nothing. The true ephemera is the\r\nwasp. In a brief six months' summer (not more than four months of full\r\nactivity) it has to accomplish, not only the cycle of the individual\r\nlife--to be born, to eat, to love, to die--but, what is far more\r\nonerous, the cycle of a prolonged social life, the most complicated\r\nwhich any insect is required to perform. What the bee leisurely\r\nelaborates in several years, the wasp must realize immediately. Much\r\nmore than the bee! For the latter makes its honeycombs in a completed\r\nhouse (the hive, the hollow of the rock, the trunk of a tree); but the\r\nwasp must improvise without as within, the ramparts of the city no less\r\nthan the city itself.\r\n\r\nFour months to create everything, to make and unmake a people, and a\r\npeople of lofty organization!\r\n\r\nLearn, ye idle races which mutter that in fourscore years ye have no\r\ntime, learn to despise it. It is a purely relative affair. There is\r\nnever any time for the flat-bellied snail, were it to crawl through\r\ncenturies. There is always time for heroic activity, firm will, and\r\nresolute energy.\r\n\r\nThe wasp dies. Its city of thirty thousand souls, improvised by\r\na revolution, as by a thundering stroke of genius and courage,\r\nsubsists as a testimony to its labours. Solid, eminently substantial,\r\nconscientiously wrought, and seemingly intended for eternity!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet us note the starting-point.\r\n\r\nA miserable fly, which in winter has survived the destruction of its\r\nrace, issues all a-dust from its hiding-place. Thank Heaven, it is\r\nthe spring-time! Does it seek to enjoy the sun? No, it will not allow\r\nitself a day's repose. What is its first duty? To love with a rapid and\r\nburning love, to go straight to its goal, to seize and take up as it\r\npasses that vital force which will create an entire people. Love on the\r\nwing,--no delay,--everything made to bear on the great social aim!\r\n\r\nSavage and alone, with its idea and its hope, this mother of the\r\nfuture commonwealth creates in the first place its citizens, some\r\nthousands upon thousands of labourers. You have already learned that\r\namong insects every worker is a female. These too are workers, but the\r\nharsh necessities of toil suppress in them their sex. They love with a\r\nlofty devotion. The austere virgin looks for no other spouse than the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nThe chain of ardent labour is continued from the mother to her\r\ndaughters. Her task was to beget: it is theirs to build. The fury\r\nof improvisation is the same in them, however, as it was in her.\r\nAccording to the region and the climate, the tribe, the species,\r\nand the work vary. Here they will excavate underground the cave in\r\nwhich they construct their edifice, isolating it from the soil, and\r\npreserving it from damp. There they suspend it in the air, and build it\r\nof strong coarse pasteboard to defy the heaviest rains. To make this\r\npaper or pasteboard, they hasten to the forest, where they select some\r\nthoroughly prepared wood, which has been long soaking, and has been\r\nalready steeped by Nature just as we steep flax. Then within, with a\r\nstrong sharp tooth (for theirs are not the graceful probosces of bees\r\nintended to kiss flowers), they gnaw, and tear, and loosen, and sever\r\nthe rebellious filaments, pound them into pulp as we do the linen rags,\r\nand knead them with a heavy tongue. After the paste has been mixed\r\nwith a viscous and adhesive saliva, it is spread out into thin layers.\r\nWith teeth closed like a press, the work is completed. The elementary\r\nsubstance of the pasteboard is prepared.\r\n\r\nA second industry now commences. The paper manufacturer is transformed\r\ninto a mason. It has not the beaver's tail to serve as a trowel, but\r\nwith the American wasp a sort of palette on the leg serves the same\r\npurpose. The operation is not the same here as in Guiana. The mason\r\nof Cayenne, having built up the walls, has only to suspend to them a\r\nsuccession of floors or platforms, following in that dry hot land the\r\ntype of our human habitations. But the European mason, working with\r\npasteboard, in a damp climate, where even in the summer heavy rains\r\nare frequent, adopts a different plan: _a house within a house_, a\r\nhive completely isolated from the envelope which encloses it. This\r\nis the most successful device for an ardent and chilly people, whose\r\nlife-flame needs careful guarding.\r\n\r\nAs it is without, so it is within. As the house, so too the inhabitant.\r\nWe men are not yet sufficiently acquainted with the influence exercised\r\nupon our moral dispositions by our habitations. This duplication of\r\nwalls, this potent envelopment of a people so completely shut up under\r\nits strong twofold enclosure, largely contributes to the unity of the\r\ncommonwealth.\r\n\r\nObserve another singularity: shall we call it a trivial one? No; to\r\nthe serious observer it is of importance. The city has two gates;\r\nits people enter by the one, and pass out by the other, so that no\r\nconfusion can take place, and no collision between the ingressing and\r\negressing crowds. This plan is adopted by all people who economize\r\ntime, and wish to transact their business expeditiously. In London,\r\nthe rule is the same as with the wasps: on the one side those who are\r\ncoming, on the other those who are going; each person keeps to the\r\nright; these take one footpath, those another. No such impediment\r\nis met with in the Strand as the idlers of our Rue Vivienne, who\r\nincessantly convert themselves into a serious obstacle, and swim\r\nlaboriously in the confusion they create.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut to return to our subject.\r\n\r\nWhat is the object of these constructions? Is this robust being,\r\nendowed with such an intensity of vital force, more afraid of the air\r\nthan numbers of delicate insects,--than the nervous spider, which\r\nhas only a house of thread, or even lives under a leaf? Therein lies\r\nthe lofty mystery of life for the higher insect. It is this which\r\nstimulates the universal genius of the ant either above ground or\r\nunder ground. It is this which inspires the activity, the persevering\r\ntoil and economy of the bee. What, then, is it? The _love of the\r\nfuture_,--the yearning to perpetuate and eternize that which one loves.\r\nAll their love centres in their offspring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTo love the child and the future; to toil in view of time and of that\r\nwhich as yet is not; to exhaust their vitality and die of work, that\r\nposterity may have less cause to labour,--a noble ideal, assuredly, of\r\nsociety, wherever it may be. One can well understand it in those who\r\nhave time before them, and a life to make use of, like men and bees.\r\nBut that this insect which has no time, which perishes in the evening,\r\nshould love the time that will never be its own, should immolate its\r\nlittle life for the sake of the life that is to come, should devote to\r\nthe child of to-morrow its solitary day, is a sacrifice peculiar to the\r\nwasp: it is original and sublime!\r\n\r\nThere is not a minute to lose; and the mother incessantly increases the\r\nburden. Besides the female workers, she produces some few males who\r\ndo not work, whose little and very brief function scarcely prevails\r\nas an excuse for their inactivity. Among those tragical and serious\r\ninsect-races, Nature, as if to divert herself a moment by a comical\r\ndistraction, has made the poor little males ordinarily squat and\r\nobese, innocent little Falstaffs, who are guarded like a seraglio of\r\nunimportant servants. The caricature is complete in the case of the\r\nmale bee, which, alleging that it neither knows how to glean abroad nor\r\nto build at home, passes the time in humming before its bee-hive (like\r\nour young cigar-smoking idlers).\r\n\r\nAmong the wasps life is so tense, burning, and keen, that the\r\nvery males, slothful as they may be, dare not abandon themselves\r\nto complete indolence. Yonder ladies, who do not jest, and who\r\nhave stings of which the males are deprived, might look upon their\r\nidleness sourly, and stir them up with dagger-thrusts. So they have\r\nconceived the idea of working without work; they have the air of\r\ndoing something,--a small part of the domestic labour, cleaning, and\r\nsweeping. If any one dies, the ceremony of interment provides them with\r\na pretence; with the effort of carrying a slight weight they sweat and\r\ngroan, and several put their shoulders together. In a word, they are\r\nvery ridiculous. And I am confident that their terrible companions\r\nlaugh at them.\r\n\r\nTheirs truly is an onerous undertaking. Twenty or thirty thousand\r\nmouths to feed, is a very extensive household. If they were only gifted\r\nwith the prudent activity of bees, their community would perish of\r\nfamine. What they need is a violent, furious, murderous rapidity,--all\r\nthe appearances of an immense gluttony,--all the love and devotion\r\nwhich Sparta had for the art of thieving. But the secret of their\r\npower, which is plainly discernible in them if we observe them but\r\na moment, is their magnificent insolence, their superb contempt for\r\nall other beings, and their firm conviction that the whole world is\r\ntheir inheritance. If we consider, it is true, their wonderful energy,\r\ncompared with which lions and tigers are mere races of sheep,--and\r\ntheir prodigious yearly effort of improvisation,--and, finally, their\r\nabsolute devotion to the public welfare,--we shall not find in all\r\nnature creatures relatively of greater power, nor which possess a\r\nclearer right to value themselves highly.\r\n\r\nOur modern minds, however, find a difficulty in admiring the violence\r\nof the antique virtues. Their boundless love of the commonwealth is\r\npushed to an almost criminal excess. Who has not marked with how\r\nferocious an ardour they hunt the bees! Yet certain species of wasps\r\ncan make honey; but only in fine climates, which, knowing no winter,\r\nallow the wasps an interval of peaceful labour. Here the case is\r\ndifferent. Their life, cut short in six months, compels them to resort\r\nto measures of cruel simplicity. Honey is needed for their children.\r\nThereupon they attack the bee, and take it prisoner; with their pliable\r\nbody, whose waist is a mere thread, they so curve the extremity as\r\nto stab the prisoner underneath with their deadly sting; when thus\r\nstricken, the wasp saws it with three strokes of its teeth, and leaves\r\nthe head and corselet to palpitate for some time longer, while the\r\nbelly, filled with honey, the barbarian carries off as a gift for its\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\nIt feels no remorse. The death of others apparently does not cause a\r\npang to this creature, which knows that it too will die to-morrow.\r\n\r\nWhat do I say?\r\n\r\nOur virgins of Tauris do not wait until Nature lays upon them her\r\nheavy hand and the ignoble leaden shroud of winter. They have borne\r\nthe sword; they will die by the sword. The republic ends in a general\r\nmassacre. The children, recently, ay, and still, so dear, are slain;\r\ndilatory children whom cold and want would kill to-morrow; their\r\nsisters, aunts, and affectionate nurses securing them at least the\r\nadvantage of dying by the hands of those who love them. This latter\r\ngift, a speedy death, is freely bestowed on numerous unfortunates who\r\nhad no thought of soliciting it,--on little useless males, even on\r\nyoung workers who were born late, and cannot boast of a constitution\r\nsufficiently strong to resist the winter.\r\n\r\nLet it not be said that the heroic race of wasps is ever seen to\r\nrequest the humiliating hospitality of the smoky roofs of man, and, for\r\nthe sake of living a little longer, to expose its melancholy remains\r\nin the shambles of a spider's web! No, children! No, sisters! Die! The\r\nrepublic is immortal. Some one of us, favoured by the yearly miracle\r\nand great lottery of Nature, will be called upon to recommence the\r\nentire work. And if but one remains, it is enough. Should the world\r\nperish, a single true heart would suffice to re-create it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VI.--THE BEES: A TOMB AT PÈRE-LACHAISE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\"THE BEES\" OF VIRGIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll modern writers have triumphed over the ignorance displayed by\r\nthe poet Virgil in his fable of Aristæus, who draws life out of the\r\nwomb of death, and causes his bees to spring from the entrails of\r\nimmolated bulls.[Q] But, for myself, I have never laughed at it. I\r\nknow, I feel, that every word of this great sacred poet has a weighty\r\nvalue, an authority which I would designate as that of an augur and\r\na pontiff. And the fourth book of the _Georgics_, particularly, was\r\na holy work, issuing from the inmost recesses of the heart. It was a\r\npious homage rendered to sorrow and to friendship; an eulogium on the\r\nproscribed Gallus, Virgil's dearest friend. This eulogium, undoubtedly,\r\nwas struck out by the prudent Mæcenas; and Virgil then substituted his\r\nResurrection of the Bees: a song full of immortality, which, in the\r\nmystery of Nature's transformations, embodies our highest hope, that\r\ndeath is not a death, but the beginning of a new life.\r\n\r\n[Footnote Q: The passage to which Michelet refers is found in the\r\nfourth book of the _Georgics_, and is thus translated by Dryden:--\r\n\r\n   \"The secret in an easy method lies:\r\n    Select four brawny bulls for sacrifice,\r\n    Which on Lycæus graze, without a guide;\r\n    Add four fair heifers yet in yoke untried:\r\n    For these, four altars in their temple rear,\r\n    And then adore the woodland powers with prayer.\r\n    From the slain victims pour the streaming blood,\r\n    And leave their bodies in the shady wood:\r\n    Nine mornings thence, Lethean poppy bring,\r\n    T' appease the manes of the poet's king:\r\n    And, to propitiate his offended pride,\r\n    A fatted calf and a black ewe provide:\r\n    This finished, to the former woods repair.\r\n    His mother's precepts he performs with care;\r\n    The temple visits, and adores with prayer.\r\n    Four altars raises, from his herds he calls,\r\n    For slaughter, four the fairest of his bulls;\r\n    Four heifers from his female store he took,\r\n    All fair, and all unknowing of the yoke.\r\n    Nine mornings thence, with sacrifice and prayers,\r\n    The powers atoned, he to the grove repairs.\r\n    Behold a prodigy! for, from within\r\n    The broken bowels, and the bloated skin,\r\n    A buzzing noise of bees his ears alarms,\r\n    Straight issue through the sides assaulting swarms;\r\n    Dark as a cloud they make a wheeling flight,\r\n    Then on a neighbouring tree, descending light:\r\n    Like a large cluster of black grapes they show,\r\n    And make a large dependence from the bough.\"\r\n]\r\n\r\nWould he have descended to the empty pleasure of inserting a popular\r\nfable in that consecrated portion of his poem which had been occupied\r\nby his friend's name? I will never believe it. The fable, if it be\r\none, must necessarily possess some serious foundation, and a truthful\r\nside. We are not dealing here with the worldly poet, the urbane singer,\r\nlike Horace, the elegant favourite of Rome. It is not the charming\r\nimprovisatore of the court of Augustus, the gay and indiscreet Ovid,\r\nwho betrays the loves of the gods. Virgil is the child of Earth,\r\nthe pure and noble figure of the old Italian peasant, the religious\r\ninterrogator, the reverently simple interpreter of the secrets of\r\nNature. But he may be mistaken in his words,--that he may have\r\nill-applied the names,--this is not impossible; but so far as the\r\nfacts are concerned, it is an entirely different matter: whatever he\r\ndescribes, I firmly believe he saw.\r\n\r\nAn accident threw me into the way of understanding the poet's\r\nintention. On a certain memorable day, my wife and I repaired to the\r\ncemetery of Père-Lachaise, to visit before winter the burial-places of\r\nmy family, the tomb which reunites my father and his grandson. This\r\nlatter had been born to me in the very year which terminated the first\r\nhalf of the present century, and I had named him Lazarus in my devout\r\nhope of the Awakening of the Nations. I had imagined that I saw upon\r\nhis countenance a gleam, as it were, of the strong and tender thoughts\r\nwhich throbbed in my heart at that last moment of my teaching. Oh,\r\nvanity of human hopes! This flower of my autumn, which I yearned to\r\nanimate with the potent vitality that had been of too tardy development\r\nin myself, disappeared almost in the act of birth. And there was\r\nno help but to deposit my child at the feet of my father, who had\r\nalready been four years dead. Two cypresses which I then planted in\r\nthat ill-omened nook of clay have acquired in the brief interval an\r\nextraordinary growth. Two, nay, three times taller than myself, they\r\nclothe their vigorous branches with a young, rich foliage which ever\r\npoints towards heaven. If, with an effort, you lower them, they rear\r\nthemselves again, in all their pride and strength, flourishing with a\r\nmarvellous pith, as if they had drank from the earth where I planted\r\nthem the precious treasure of my past and my unconquerable aspiration.\r\n\r\nWhile revolving these thoughts I ascended the hill, and before arriving\r\nat the tomb, which is situated in the upper alley, I made this\r\nobservation,--that though I had on so many occasions frequented this\r\nmelancholy and beautiful spot, having been in earlier life the most\r\nassiduous visitor of the dead, I had scarcely ever seen any insects\r\nin the Père-Lachaise. Hardly even at the great epoch of the flowers,\r\nwhen everything is covered with bloom, and numbers of the old deserted\r\nsepulchres are embowered in roses, I had not remarked that animal life\r\nabounded there as it abounds elsewhere. Very few birds, and very few\r\ninsects. Why? I could not say.\r\n\r\nWhile making this reflection, we had finished climbing the hill; we\r\nstood in front of the tomb. And there, with admiration, with a species\r\nof astonishment, I found a surprising contradiction of what I had just\r\nbeen saying.\r\n\r\nAbout a score of very brilliant bees hovered above the little\r\ngarden-plot,--which was narrow as a shroud, stripped of bloom and bare\r\nof flowers, and saddened by the influence of the season. In the whole\r\ncemetery remained only the last autumnal flowers,--some withering\r\nand half-leafless Bengal roses. The spot where we stood, full of new\r\nbuildings, masonry, and plaster, was an Arabia Deserta. Finally, on the\r\ntomb, towards the head of the grandfather, flourished only a few sickly\r\nwhite asters, and over my child the cypresses. It must needs have been\r\nthat these asters, in their cold clayey soil, nourished either by the\r\nwhispers of the air or the spirits of the earth, treasured up a modicum\r\nof honey, since the little gleaners resorted thither for their harvest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am not superstitious. I believe in but one miracle, the constant\r\nmiracle of the Providence of Nature. I experienced nevertheless how\r\npowerfully the mind may be affected by a lively surprise of the heart.\r\nI felt an emotion of gratefulness at the sight of the mysterious little\r\ncreatures animating this solitude, whither, alas! I myself came but\r\nrarely. The increasing absorption of my work, in which day pressed upon\r\nday,--the palpitating flame of the forge where one forges more and more\r\nquickly, in the doubt whether one will be living to-morrow,--all this\r\nkept us further from the tombs than in the days of our dreamy youth. I\r\nwas much affected by seeing my place supplied. In my absence the bees\r\npeopled and vivified the spot, consoled, and perhaps rejoiced my dead.\r\nMy father may have smiled on them in his kindly indulgence; they may\r\nhave been the happiness and first delight of my child.\r\n\r\nSelfish motives could not have led them thither; there was so little\r\nfor them to take. Nevertheless, when we suspended to the cypress-boughs\r\nthe garlands of _immortelles_ we had brought with us, they were curious\r\nenough to ascertain if there was any treasure in the new flowers. The\r\nhard, prickly corolla soon repulsed them, and sent them back to the\r\nfaded asters. I felt very sad, and said to them:--\"Late, very late, my\r\nfriends, you come, and to the tomb of the poor! Why am I not able to\r\nrecompense you with a banquet of friendship, which should sustain and\r\nwarm you during the first cold breezes, already blowing on these icy\r\nheights, so exposed to the northern wind!\"\r\n\r\nAs if they had understood me, their movements afforded an exact reply.\r\nSome I saw, with their little limbs skilfully bent forward, rubbing\r\ntheir backs in the sun; they longed to absorb into every vein its\r\ngenial radiance. They made the most of that brief hour when the sun\r\nrevolves too quickly; one scarcely feels it before it has gone! Their\r\nsignificant gesture plainly said:--\"Oh, what a cold morning we have\r\nhad! Let us make haste! In less than an hour commences the equally\r\ninclement evening, the frozen night,--nay, who knows? the winter! and\r\nthen our death is at hand.\"\r\n\r\nThey were still full of life, however; marvellously trim and bright,--I\r\nmay even say radiant,--under their illuminated wings, all shot with\r\ngold. I never saw more beautiful insects; insects more clearly inspired\r\nby a higher life. One thing embarrassed me; namely, that they were\r\ntoo handsome, and too shining, inasmuch as they did not wear their\r\nindustrial attire, their velvety coat, their pincers, and their\r\nbrushes. And, finally, I discovered another circumstance: that they had\r\nnot the four wings of the bee, but only two.\r\n\r\nI perceived my mistake. It was these insects which had deceived Virgil.\r\nLike myself, he thought them bees, and so he erroneously called them.\r\nRéaumur confesses that for a moment even he was deceived by them.\r\n\r\nBut the fact related by Virgil is not inaccurate. We can understand how\r\nkeenly it would impress the minds of the ancients, and how they would\r\nsee in it a type of resurrection. They seem the daughters of death. Of\r\nthe three ages of their existence, they spend the first in morbid and\r\ndeadly waters, fatal to all other creatures, which permit the escape of\r\nthe residuum of life in dissolution; with ingenious tenderness, Nature\r\nthere preserves them, maintains them alive, and enables them to breathe\r\nin the very midst of death.\r\n\r\nTheir second period is passed under the earth,--in the shades,--where\r\nthey sleep their chrysalis-like slumber.\r\n\r\nBut when once they have quitted the place of sepulture, they are fully\r\ncompensated for their previous abasement; a light aërial life, exempt\r\nfrom the bee's incessant toil, and glorified by golden wings, such\r\nas the latter never boasts of, is bestowed upon them, with the gift,\r\nmoreover, of gentle manners. Innocent, and without stings, they live\r\ntheir season of love under the sun and among the flowers. Far from\r\nblushing at their origin,--these noble Virgilian bees!--they do not\r\ndisdain the flowers of the cemetery, they keep company with the dead,\r\nand for the living collect that honey of the soul,--the hope of the\r\nfuture!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VII.--THE BEE IN THE FIELDS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE BEE IN THE FIELDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When the plant attains to the flower, the climax of its\r\nexistence,--when it assumes its symmetrical outlines, its perfumes,\r\nits colours, and a certain degree of animal irritability,--it emerges\r\nfrom its condition of isolation, and connects itself more closely\r\nwith the great Whole. But it remains fixed in one place, without any\r\nreciprocation of love. The animal, on the contrary, is movement itself,\r\nand manifests its joy in living by its capricious mobility. Then the\r\ncaptive plant casts a glance of amicable confidence on the animal's\r\nlife of freedom, offers it the abundance of its substance, and for sole\r\nreward expects that it will achieve its fecundation. Then, too, as an\r\nelder brother might do, the animal assists the plant, and affords it in\r\nits dependent state the succour of liberty. But, for this purpose, the\r\nanimal must be completely free, I would say winged, bound up with the\r\nvegetable life which was its kindly nurse. Behold the insect, love's\r\nmessenger and mediator to the plants, their propagator, and the zealous\r\ninstrument of their fertilization.\r\n\r\n\"With a maternal care, the plant provides a place in its own body where\r\nthe insect's egg may be developed. It nourishes the young larva which\r\nas yet is incapable of action, but which, in due time, emerging from\r\nits vegetation in the egg, will move freely to and fro, and seek its\r\nown sustenance. The creative fecundity of the plant easily replaces\r\nwhatever the insect has extracted from it; and thus both animal and\r\nplant harmoniously attain to the climax of existence.\r\n\r\n\"The animal, from its low sphere of nutrition, rises to a more elevated\r\nsphere, the pure need of motion, and the pursuit of love. The plant,\r\nit is true, does not soar so high; but its flower is a bright dream of\r\na higher state of being,--a dream which, though fugitive, proceeds, by\r\nmeans of its fruits, to secure the conservation of the species. The\r\nblossoming plant and the winged insect reach, as if by concert, an\r\nanalogous development, manifested by their colours, their beautiful\r\nsymmetrical forms, and their refinement of substance. Papilionaceous\r\nflowers, for instance, might almost be called insects-become-plants.\r\n\r\n\"This harmonic existence marches forward with the same rhythm as the\r\nmoments of the day. Each flower to whose juice an insect is assigned\r\nexpands at the hour when its life is most intense, and shuts at the\r\nhour of its repose. Thus they feel their unity; love attracts them\r\none towards the other. Here the plant plays the part of the female,\r\nthe fixed basis of creation, absorbed in nature. The insect resembles\r\nthe tiny male who frees himself from earth and curvets in the air;\r\nrecalled, nevertheless, by the plant to the oneness of the terrestrial\r\nwhole. It is a winged anther, which diffuses life among the flowers.\"[R]\r\n\r\n[Footnote R: Burdach, bk. ii., c. 3.]\r\n\r\nWhat the wind accomplishes hap-hazard, flinging abroad in capricious\r\nshowers the generative elements, the insect performs through love,--the\r\ndirect love of its species, the _in_direct and confused love of the\r\namiable auxiliary which welcomes and nourishes it, which will hereafter\r\nnourish also its eggs and continue its maternal work. Its action,\r\ntherefore, is not external and superficial, like that of the wind;\r\nit is internal and penetrating. The ardent, curious insect will not\r\nsuffer itself to be checked by the light and trivial obstacles with\r\nwhich vegetable modesty surrounds the threshold of its mysteries; it\r\nboldly dashes aside the veil, and enters into the inmost economy of\r\nthe flower. It seizes, it pillages, and it carries away, assured that\r\nall it does will be approved. The flower, in its powerless expansion,\r\nrejoices only too keenly in the deeds of these thievish liberators,\r\nwho will transport its desire whither it would fain transport itself.\r\n\"Take,\" she says, \"and take yet more!\" The insect then exhausts its\r\nutmost effort; each of its hairs becomes a tiny magnetic dart, which\r\nattracts and wishes to attract. Would that it might be enveloped in\r\nthese points, and over all its surface (like the lightning conductor)\r\nconcentrate this treasure of vegetable electricity! Such is its\r\naspiration. An aspiration realized in the higher insect, in the\r\nbee, which bristles everywhere with a magnetic apparatus,--the bee,\r\npredestined by the tools peculiar to it, both to its little individual\r\nindustry of honey-making, and to the grand, general, universal industry\r\nof the fecundation, of plants.\r\n\r\nIt is an admirable creature, and what the great physiologist has just\r\nsaid of the loves of the flower and the insect applies particularly\r\nto it; except with this notable distinction on the part of the bee,\r\nthat it robs the flower only of that noble luxuriance of life which it\r\nlavishes upon love. The bee does not establish its cradle in the plant\r\nthat the young may thence derive its sole sustenance, and gradually\r\ndevour its nurse. Instead of depositing its egg, and exposing it to\r\nthe hazards of the vegetable existence, as the butterfly does with\r\nits future caterpillar, the bee economizes the plant, and, without\r\nattacking it, borrows from it the precious materials which its art\r\nworks up into palaces of alabaster, amber, or of gold, where its\r\nchildren will in due time repose.\r\n\r\nThe innocency of the bee is one of its lofty attributes, no less than\r\nits miraculous art. Its sting is simply a defensive and indispensable\r\nweapon, not against man-with whom, of its own accord, it does not\r\nwage war--but against the cruel wasps, its terrible enemies. The\r\nbee, on the other hand, injures none. It does not live by death; its\r\ninoffensive life does not demand the sacrifice of other lives. It\r\nstimulates innumerable existences; it vivifies and fecundates them.\r\nThere is no uncultivated desert, no wild, bare region which it does not\r\nanimate,--where it does not infuse fresh vigour into the languishing\r\nvegetation, urging the plants to bud, watching over and inspecting\r\nthem. It reproaches them with their slothfulness; and as soon as they\r\nopen to the influence of love-these poor dumb virgins!--it establishes\r\nbetween them the requisite interpreters, carries off in its murmurs\r\ntheir pollen and perfume, and harmonizes the aromas which are their\r\nblossoms of thought.\r\n\r\nThis process begins in the month of March. When an uncertain but\r\nalready potent sun reawakes the sleeping sap, the tiny flowers of the\r\nfields, the wild violet, the Easter-daisy of the sward, the buttercup\r\nof the hedgerow, the precocious gillyflower, expanding, perfume the\r\nair. But their expansion lasts only for a moment. Barely open at\r\nnoon, by three o'clock they fold themselves up again, and veil their\r\nshivering stamens. In this brief interval of gentle heat you may see\r\na little wan-looking creature, completely clad but very chilly, which\r\nalso ventures to unfurl its wings. The bee quits its city, in the\r\nknowledge that the manna is ready for it and its little ones.\r\n\r\nA little matter then, it is true, but most cradles are empty at this\r\nepoch. The great fecundity of the mother bee still lurks concealed in\r\nher bosom. The regular and rapid incubation, which might suffice to\r\ncreate a world, will not commence until a much later period,--the sunny\r\ntime of May.\r\n\r\nHow admirable is this agreement! Most of the shivering flowers, like\r\nthe shivering bee, wait a more equable season before they bare to the\r\nsun their corolla, too delicate to endure the caprices of April.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to watch the intercourse between these charming\r\ncreatures. The docile flower inclines and yields to the insect's\r\nunquiet movements. The shrine which it had closed against the winds,\r\nand the inquisitive glance, it opens to the beloved bee, which,\r\nimpregnated by it, speeds afar on her message of love. The delicious\r\nprecautions which Nature has taken to veil from profane eyes the\r\nmysteries enacted therein, do not delay for a moment the audacious\r\nseeker, who is completely at home, so to speak, and has no fear of\r\nbeing considered an intruder. One flower, for example, is protected by\r\na couple of petals which join together in the form of an arch (as, for\r\ninstance, the iris on the border of the waters, which in this manner\r\ndefends from the rain its delicate little lovers). Another, like the\r\nsweet-pea, dons a kind of helmet, whose vizor must be lifted by its\r\nsuitor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe bee takes its stand at the bottom of these recesses worthy of the\r\nfairies, covered with the softest tapestry, under fantastic pavilions,\r\nwith walls of topaz, and roofs of sapphire. Paltry comparisons these,\r\nfor they are borrowed from dead gems, while the flowers live, and feel,\r\nand desire, and wait. And if the happy conqueror of the little hidden\r\nkingdoms,--if the imperious violator of their innocent barriers, the\r\ninsect, mingles and confuses everything, they readily whisper its\r\npardon, overwhelm it with their sweetnesses, and load it with their\r\nhoney.\r\n\r\nThere are favoured localities, and there are happy hours, where and\r\nwhen the bee, while gathering its harvest, accomplishes--chaste\r\ntoiler!--myriads of marriages. On the coasts, for example, and in\r\nthe immediate neighbourhood of the savage sea, where one would\r\nhardly expect to meet with such pacific idyls, should there be but\r\none shadowy, secure, and warm recess, Nature never fails, in the\r\nwarm and humid mildness of that maternal retreat, to create a little\r\nchosen world; and there the flower distils to the bee its sweetest\r\nnectar,--there the bee assuages the impetuous yearning of the flower.\r\n\r\nGenial, bland, and still is the hour which precedes the evening.\r\nCaressed by the last rays of the sun, whose warmth it preserves\r\nwithin its bosom, besprinkled in its corolla by the light and already\r\nradiant mist, the flower becomes conscious of two lives and a twofold\r\nelectricity; it is urged to love, and it loves! The stamens blaze\r\nforth, and scatter abroad their cloud of incense. Then at that charming\r\nand sacred hour let the mediatrix come; let the Samaritan bee appear!\r\nLet her collect the sweet odours dispersed by the evening breeze; let\r\nher redivide them with wise forethought, giving here and taking there!\r\nThe blossoms are no longer solitary; through the agency of the bee, the\r\nmeadow has been converted into a society where all understand and all\r\nlove each other, initiated into the hymeneal rites by their friendly\r\nlittle high-priest.\r\n\r\nIt is not a less important duty for the bee to rise at an early hour\r\nand be present at the moment when the flower--which has slumbered\r\nunder the penetrating dew (exhaled by its divine master, father, and\r\nlover, the sun)--awakes, and recovers its consciousness. Struck by\r\nthe sympathetic beam, it no longer resists; it gives up the softened\r\nessence of its choicest sweetness; it becomes, as it were, a tiny\r\nfountain, which distils honey drop by drop. Opportunely comes the bee;\r\nits work here is very nearly completed: the sweet treasure, finely\r\nprepared in that hour of perfection, will entail but little labour. It\r\nbears it off to its children: \"Eat; it is the soul of the blossom.\"\r\n\r\nBut in the noonday heat will she remain inactive? The burning sun and\r\ndry air have withered up the blossoms of the plain. But those of the\r\nwoods, sheltered by the fresh cool shades, present their cups brimming\r\nover; those of the murmurous brooks, and silent and deep marshes, are\r\nthen instinct with vitality. The forget-me-not dreams, and weeps tiny\r\ntears of nectar. Even the white water-lily, in her pale virginity,\r\nyields a rare treasure of love.\r\n\r\n\"Night does not injure the bee, but cold is extremely harmful. Such is\r\nher conscientiousness, that, in order to avoid losing a day's labour in\r\nour brief summers, she takes too little heed of the sudden returns of\r\nwinter, of the sharp caprices of the north wind, which sometimes visit\r\nus on the finest days. Insects of inferior intelligence, but also less\r\nindustrious, perfectly understand the secret of escaping its influence.\r\nIn their prudent idleness they say to one another, 'Tomorrow! Let us\r\nkeep holiday!' And they patiently wait for one, or two, or more days,\r\nuntil the wicked spirit of the north has abandoned its evil mood. But\r\nthose who have charge of souls, and a large family to maintain,--those\r\nwho know that a mild winter may chance to keep their offering awake,\r\nand, accordingly, famished, will hesitate before they take a single\r\nday's repose.\r\n\r\n\"And, therefore, on the cold mornings of a June not less bleak than\r\nMarch, they do not fear to rush boldly into the fields. But they are\r\nmore valiant than robust; the cold catches them, and I have known them\r\ndrag their limbs to my windows, faltering and half-paralyzed. They have\r\nmade no attempt to escape; they have suffered themselves to be taken\r\nprisoners. They were in a scared condition; still bearing the signs of\r\ntheir courageous and indefatigable work, impregnated with the dust of\r\nflowers, and their little, baskets loaded and overloaded with pollen.\r\nThey seemed to say:--'We are no sluggards. On the contrary, in the cold\r\nhours of morning, when many are still asleep, we have already completed\r\na day's work. But, alas, the times are so hard, and the north wind is\r\nso keen! Behold us half-frozen. A moment's hospitality, I pray you.'\r\n\r\n\"Who would not respect the misfortune of such blameless and over-eager\r\nworkers? I lent them not only a roof, and the warmth of an apartment\r\nclosed to the wind and open to the sun, but immediately improvised for\r\nthem a friendly repast. Where? At the bottom of a sugar-basin.\r\n\r\n\"The chilly creatures, having revived at a genial beam their lost\r\nwarmth, and restored to a good condition all the little electric world\r\nof hairs with which they bristle, began the exploration of their\r\ntemporary prison, and were agreeably surprised to find the crystal a\r\ndining-hall. With a good appetite, seating themselves at the table,\r\nthey attacked a fragment of sugar, and sucked up with their proboscis\r\nall the sweetness they could find. When they had finished their\r\nrepast, and were completely restored, were fluttering to and fro,\r\ndemanding the way out, I set them free, without causing them to lose\r\none moment of a day already far advanced. With a rapid flight, charmed\r\nby the noonday sun, they returned to their occupations, distinctly\r\nhumming:--'Farewell, madam, and many thanks!'\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIII.--THE BEES AS ARCHITECTS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE BEES AS ARCHITECTS: THE CITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the wasp's nest resemble Sparta, the bee-hive is the veritable\r\nAthens of the Insect World. There, all is art. The people--the\r\nartist-élite of the people--incessantly create two things; on the one\r\nhand, the City, the country,--on the other, the Universal Mother, whose\r\ntask it is not only to perpetuate the race, but to become its idol, its\r\n_fetish_, the living god of the community.\r\n\r\nThe bees share with the wasps, the ants, and all the sociable insects,\r\nthe disinterested life of aunts and sisters,--laborious virgins, who\r\ndevote themselves entirely to an adoptive maternity.\r\n\r\nBut from these analogous peoples the bee differs in the necessity it is\r\nunder of creating a national idol, the love of which impels it to work.\r\n\r\nAll this has been long misunderstood. It was at first supposed that\r\nthis State was a monarchy, _that it possessed a king_. Not at all; the\r\nking is a female. Thereupon one is driven to say, _This female is\r\na queen_. Another error. Not only does she not govern, or reign, or\r\ncontrol, but in certain conjunctions she is governed, and sometimes\r\neven placed in private confinement. She is at once something more and\r\nsomething less than a queen. She is an object of legal and public\r\nadoration; I should say legal and constitutional, for this adoration is\r\nnot so blind but that the idol, in some cases, as we shall see, may be\r\ntreated very severely.\r\n\r\n\"Then, at bottom, the government will be democratic?\" Yes; if we\r\ntake into consideration the unanimous devotion of the people, the\r\nspontaneous labour of everybody. No one commands. But, nevertheless,\r\nyou can clearly see that in every higher work an intelligent body of\r\nthe _élite_, an aristocracy of artists, takes the lead. The city is\r\nnot built or organized by the entire people, but by a special class, a\r\nkind of guild or corporation. While the mob of bees seeks the common\r\nnourishment abroad, certain much larger bees, the wax-makers, elaborate\r\nthe wax, prepare it, shape it, and skilfully make use of it. Like\r\nthe medieval freemasons, this respectable corporation of architects\r\ntoils and builds on the principles of a profound geometry. Like those\r\nof the old days, they are _the masters of the living stone_. But our\r\nworthy bees are far more deserving of the title! The materials which\r\nthey employ they have made, have elaborated by their vital action, and\r\nvivified with their internal juices.\r\n\r\nNeither the honey nor the wax is a vegetable substance. Those little\r\nlight bees which go in quest of the essence of the flowers bring it\r\nback already transformed and enriched by their virginal life. Sweet and\r\npure, it passes from their mouth to the mouth of their elder sisters.\r\nThese, the grave wax-makers, having received the aliment vivified and\r\nendowed with the charming sweetness which is, as it were, the soul\r\nof the race, elaborate it in their turn, and communicate to it their\r\nown peculiar life,--solidity. Wise and sedentary, they work up the\r\nliquid into a sedentary honey, a honey of the second quality, a kind of\r\nreflected honey. This is not all: the substance twice elaborated, and\r\ntwice penetrated with animal juice, they incessantly moisten with their\r\nsaliva, when using it so as to render it softer for working, but more\r\ntenacious afterwards.\r\n\r\nWas I wrong, then, in saying that this construction is truly one of\r\n\"the living stones\"? There is not an atom of the materials which is not\r\nthree times impregnated with life. Who shall say of yonder hive whether\r\nthe flower or the bee has furnished the greater part? The latter has\r\ncertainly contributed an important share. Here, the home of the people\r\nis the people's substance and visible soul; from themselves they have\r\nextracted their city, and their city is, in truth, themselves. Bee and\r\nhive, it is one and the same thing.\r\n\r\nBut let us observe them at work.\r\n\r\nAlone, in the centre of the still empty and to be created hive, the\r\nlearned wax-maker advances. From beneath its wings it delicately\r\nextracts a thin slab of wax, and conveys it to its mouth, where it is\r\nwell kneaded and pounded, and drawn out into the shape of a ribbon.\r\nEight strips are in this wise furnished, wrought, and absorbed; and the\r\nresult is eight little blocks, which the bee lays down as the first\r\nbeams of the future edifice, the foundations of the new city.\r\n\r\nOthers continue the work without moving too far from the place where it\r\nwas begun. If any unintelligent labourer does not follow the prescribed\r\nplan, the mistress-bees, experienced and accomplished, are on the spot\r\nto detect any error, and immediately remedy it.\r\n\r\nIn the solid mass, well placed and skilfully squared, where such\r\nnumbers have harmoniously deposited their contribution of wax, an\r\nexcavation must now be made, and some degree of form attained. A single\r\nbee again detaches herself from the crowd, and with her horny tongue,\r\nteeth, and paws, she contrives to hollow out the solid matter like a\r\nreversed vault. When fatigued she retires, and others take up the work\r\nof modelling. In couples they shape off and thin the walls. The only\r\npoint to be remembered is a skilful management of their thickness. But\r\nhow do they appreciate this? Who or what warns them the moment a stroke\r\ntoo much would break an opening in the partition? They never take the\r\ntrouble to make a tour of their work and examine it from the other\r\nside. Their eyes are useless to them; they judge of everything by their\r\nantennæ, which are their plumb-line and compass. They feel about, and\r\nby an infinitely delicate touch recognize the elasticity of the wax,\r\nperhaps by the sound it renders, and determine whether it is safe to\r\nexcavate it, or whether they must stop short, and not push their mining\r\noperations further.\r\n\r\nThe building, as everybody knows, is destined to serve two ends. The\r\ncells are generally used in summer as cradles, in winter as magazines\r\nof pollen and honey,--a granary of abundance for the republic. Each\r\nvessel is closed and sealed with a waxen lid, a _clôture_ religiously\r\nrespected by all the people, who take for their subsistence only a\r\nsingle comb,--and when that comb is finished pass on to another, but\r\nalways with extreme reserve and sobriety.\r\n\r\nIt has been said and repeated that the construction is absolutely\r\nuniform. Buffon goes so far as to pretend that the cell is but the\r\nidentical form of the bee, which posts itself in the wax, and by the\r\nfriction of its body, a blind manoeuvre, obtains an impress of itself,\r\na hollow, an identical cell. A baseless hypothesis, which the least\r\nreflection would show to be improbable, even if observation did not\r\ncontradict it.\r\n\r\nIn reality, their work is extremely various, and diversified in\r\nnumerous different ways.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the combs are pierced in the centre by corridors\r\nor little tunnels, which do away with the necessity of traversing two\r\nsides. Economists in everything, the bees are specially economical of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the form of the cells is by no means identical. They prefer\r\nthe hexagon,--the form which is best adapted to secure the greatest\r\npossible number of cells in the smallest area. But they do not\r\nslavishly bind themselves to this form. The first comb which they\r\nattach to the framework would cling to it very insecurely, and only\r\nby its projecting edges, if it were composed of six-sided cells. They\r\ntherefore make it with five sides only; and fashion it of pentagonal\r\ncells with broad bases, which attach themselves solidly to the wood on\r\na continuous line. The whole is agglutinated and sealed, not with wax,\r\nbut with their gum, or _propolis_, which, as it dries, becomes hard as\r\niron.\r\n\r\nThe great royal cellules, or cradles of the future mothers, which may\r\nbe seen by the side of the combs, are not six-sided, but of the form of\r\nan oblong egg,--which secures the royal favourites considerable ease,\r\nand a great facility of development.\r\n\r\nFinally, you may, with a little attention, detect important\r\ndifferences among the ordinary hexagonal cells, though at the first\r\nglance they all seem alike. They are small for the industrious\r\ngleaners, larger for the artistic wax-makers, and largest for the\r\nmales. This size is generally obtained by means of a little rounded\r\nfragment which is deposited in the bottom, and renders it slightly\r\ncircular,--I was about to say pot-bellied (_ventru_). As the house,\r\nso the tenant; the male will come into the world a squat, obese\r\nfigure,--predestined to this form by that of its cradle.\r\n\r\nThus, of their own accord, they vary the configuration and extent of\r\nthe cellules. And they vary them yet more, according to the obstacles\r\nthey encounter. If room be denied them, they reduce the size of their\r\nhexagons in due proportion and with extreme address. This fact Huber\r\nverified by some ingenious experiments. He bethought himself of\r\nderanging their operations by placing, instead of wood, a plate of\r\nglass against the wall of the hive where they were building up their\r\ncells. From the distance they saw this smooth shining crystal, to\r\nwhich nothing could be fixed; and taking their measures accordingly,\r\nthey curved their cake in such a manner that it went past the glass\r\nand joined on to the wood. But, to carry out the alteration, it became\r\nnecessary to change the diameter of the cells; to enlarge that of the\r\nconvex portion, and diminish that of the concave. A delicate problem!\r\nand yet it was readily solved by the skilful architects.\r\n\r\nIn mid-winter, says Huber again, in their season of inertia, an\r\nover-heavy slab of wax fell away, but was checked _en route_ by the\r\ncakes beneath. An avalanche seemed imminent! But the bees invented\r\nbuttresses and barriers in strong mastic, which, supporting the\r\nfallen cake and propping up the sides of the hive, prevented the\r\ndangerous ruin from dragging down the inner edifice. Then, to prevent\r\nthe occurrence of similar misfortunes, they created some novel\r\narchitectural works in the shape of flying buttresses, bulwarks,\r\npillars, cross-beams, and the like.\r\n\r\n_Novel!_ Ay, this is a sufficient refutation of Buffon's theory. That\r\nmachines or automata could invent, is a thing not easily explicable.\r\nYet the sovereign authority of this great dictator of natural history\r\nwould have prevailed, perhaps, over facts and over observation, if,\r\ntowards the close of the last century, the bees themselves, by an\r\nunforeseen stroke, had not definitively cut the Gordian knot.\r\n\r\nIt was about the epoch of the American, and shortly before the outbreak\r\nof the French Revolution. An unknown creature then made its appearance\r\nover all Europe,--of a frightful figure,--a great strong nocturnal\r\nbutterfly, marked very plainly in tawny-gray, with a hideous death's\r\nhead. This sinister being, which none had seen before, alarmed every\r\ncountryside, and seemed an omen of the most terrible misfortunes.\r\nYet, in truth, those who were terrified by it had brought it into\r\nEurope. It had come in the grub condition with its natal plant, the\r\nAmerican potato,--the fashionable vegetable which Parmentier extolled,\r\nLouis XVI. protected, and which spread in all directions. The savants\r\nbaptized the insect with a somewhat horrifying name--the _Sphinx\r\nAtropos_.\r\n\r\nAnd terrible indeed _was_ this new creature, but only for the honey.\r\nOf this it was remorselessly greedy, and to attain it was capable of\r\neverything. A hive of thirty thousand bees could not daunt it. In the\r\ndepths of night, the rapacious monster, profiting by the hour when the\r\napproaches to the city are less carefully guarded, with a gloomy but\r\nsubdued sound, as if stifled by the soft down which covers it (and all\r\nother nocturnal insects), invaded the hive, swooped down on the combs,\r\ndevoured and plundered, gutted and destroyed the magazines, and slew\r\nthe infant bees. In vain they awoke, and flew to arms; their sting\r\ncould not penetrate through the soft elastic padding which clothed the\r\nsphinx,--like the cotton armour worn by the Mexicans in the days of\r\nCortez, and impenetrable by Spanish weapons.\r\n\r\nHuber meditated on the best means of protecting his bees against this\r\nshameless brigand. Should it be by gratings, or doors? And how? He\r\ncould not determine. The most skilfully devised barriers have always\r\nthe inconvenience of impeding the great movement of ingress and egress,\r\nwhich takes place at the threshold of the hive. Their impatience\r\nregarded as intolerable the obstructions, which could not fail to\r\nembarrass them, and against which they might break their wings.\r\n\r\nOne morning, Huber's faithful assistant, who seconded him in his\r\nexperiments, brought information that the bees themselves had already\r\nsolved the problem. In different hives they had conceived and\r\nattempted various systems of defence and fortification. Here they\r\nconstructed a wall of wax, with narrow loopholes, through which the\r\n_great_ enemy could not pass. There, by a more ingenious expedient,\r\nwithout creating a single impediment, they built up some inter-crossing\r\narcades at the gates, or tiny cloisters one behind the other, but\r\nrunning in different directions,--that is to say, to the void left by\r\nthe first corresponded the substance of the second. Thus was secured\r\na number of openings for the impatient buzzing crowd, which might go\r\nin and out as usual, with no other difficulty than that of moving in\r\na slightly zigzag fashion. At the same time, a complete barrier was\r\nobtained against the great and _big_ enemy, which could no longer\r\nenter with expanded wings, nor even glide uninjured through the narrow\r\ncorridors.\r\n\r\nIt was the _coup d'état_ of the brute creation, the revolution of the\r\ninsects, executed by the bees, not only against their plunderers,\r\nbut against the calumniators who had denied their intelligence. The\r\ntheorists who had refused to believe in it, the Malebranches and the\r\nBuffons, were compelled to own themselves beaten. They had to adopt the\r\nreserve of eminent observers, like Swammerdam and Réaumur, who, far\r\nfrom questioning the genius of insects, furnish us with numerous facts\r\nin proof of its flexibility, of its rising to the measure of great\r\ndangers, of its scorn of routine, and of its power to make unexpected\r\nprogress under certain circumstances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IX.--THE BEES: ON THE WING.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nHOW THE BEES CREATE THE PEOPLE AND THE COMMON MOTHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the life of the bees, all things are brought to bear on the welfare\r\nof the infant. Let us see, then, this object of love. Let us see what\r\nis lying at the bottom of the cell; her who has just been created, the\r\nlittle virgin of toil.\r\n\r\nShe is born in a condition of singular purity; so much so that she is\r\nnot even provided with the organ of the inferior necessities. On a\r\ndelicate mixture of honey and flower dust, which is constantly renewed,\r\nyou see nothing at first but a comma, then a C, a spiral. But she\r\nalready lives, is organized, and active; so that on the eighth day,\r\nlike a skilful spinner, she weaves her network of metamorphosis.\r\n\r\nHer nurses, that she may enjoy a complete repose at the sacred moment,\r\ntake the precaution to close up her cell; erecting over it a little\r\ndome, velvety, and of a tawny colour. For ten days she is a nymph,\r\nenveloped in a veil of exceeding whiteness and great delicacy, through\r\nwhich you can discern a miniature of mouth, eyes, wings, and feet.\r\nTwenty-one days suffice for her development. Then she scratches an\r\nopening in the little dome, and thrusts through it her head; next,\r\nwith her fore-feet resting on the rim, she strenuously endeavours to\r\ndisengage her whole body. It is a great effort; but the honey is close\r\nat hand to recruit her energies. At the first cell she falls in with\r\nshe plunges into it her proboscis, and initiates herself into life.\r\n\r\nShe is still humid, gray, and very weak. So she hastens to get dry in\r\nthe sun, to harden her soft and rumpled wings. There she is welcomed by\r\nher numerous kinswomen, who stroke and lick her amorously, and bestow\r\non her a maternal kiss.\r\n\r\nNo creature is more richly endowed with implements, or more obviously\r\nintended for an industrial speciality. Each organ reads her its lesson,\r\nand informs her what she has to do. Lighted by five eyes and guided by\r\na couple of antennæ, she carries in front, projecting beyond her mouth,\r\nan unique and marvellous instrument of taste,--the proboscis, or long\r\nexternal tongue,--which is of peculiar delicacy, and partly hairy that\r\nit may the more readily absorb and imbibe. Protected, when at rest, by\r\na beautiful scaly sheath, the proboscis puts forth its fine point to\r\ntouch a liquid; and this point wetted, draws it back into its mouth,\r\nwhere lies the internal tongue, a subtle judge of sensation, and the\r\nfinal authority.\r\n\r\nTo this delicate apparatus add some coarser attributes which indicate\r\ntheir own uses: hairs on every side to catch up the dust of the\r\nflowers, brushes on the thighs to sweep together the scattered harvest,\r\nand panniers to compress it into pellets of many colours. All these\r\nconjoined form the insignia of her trade.--Go, my daughter, and become\r\na reaper!\r\n\r\nThou wilt desire nothing else, and thou wilt be fit for nothing else.\r\nThe fairy virgins who prepared thy cradle, and feed thee daily, will\r\nbring thee up to be what they have been. Sober, laborious, and sterile,\r\nthey practise a rigid economy; in them and in thee they maintain\r\nthe pure flame of virginity by fasting, or at least by very scanty\r\nnourishment, while they banquet splendidly the future mother, though\r\nstill a child, and are lavish towards the numerous, and, for the most\r\npart, useless tribe of males.\r\n\r\nIt is here we reach the fundamental strata of the City, the aristocracy\r\nof devotion and intelligence. The wax-makers, or bee-architects, if\r\nthey consulted the wishes of the living queen, would never train up\r\nan heiress to her throne. She is blindly jealous, and as soon as the\r\nsuccessor is born would have her put to death. They do not listen.\r\nThose firm sage heads, remembering that we all die, take counsel on the\r\nnecessity of perpetuating the race. And, accordingly, by the side of\r\nthe cells, or close little cradles which receive all the children of\r\nthe republic, they build some spacious chambers, fifteen, nay, twenty\r\ntimes larger, in which the ordinary egg, favoured by the conditions\r\nof ease and liberty, may enlarge and develop at will all its natural\r\nfaculties. The more certainly to ensure the superior growth of the\r\nchosen egg, they prodigalize upon it a stronger and more generous food,\r\nwhich shall give full liberty to its sex, and endow it with fecundity.\r\nSuch is the efficacy of this potent liquor, that if the nurses\r\naccidentally let fall a drop or two on the neighbouring cradles, the\r\nlittle bees, rejoicing in the chance, participate in the queen-mother's\r\nfecundity, although in an inferior degree.\r\n\r\n                                 Madam,\r\nKings I have made, but never willed to be one.\r\n[J'ai fait des rois, madame, et n'ai pas voulu l'être.]\r\n\r\nThis dramatic line perfectly characterizes the disinterestedness of\r\nthese prudent nurses. They bestow all the world's gifts on their\r\nfavourite,--a beautiful and ample habitation, a superior regimen, and\r\nthat paradise of women--motherhood!\r\n\r\nTo the others, on the contrary,--to their sisters, who are born\r\nresembling them,--narrow cradles, coarse food, incessant work, and\r\npain! These will go into the fields to sweat for the people and the\r\nmother; those, confined at home, will build incessantly, and attend to\r\nthe young. No recreation is allowed to them; I do not think they have,\r\nlike the ants, fêtes and gymnastic games. Their entire feast will be\r\nlabour (from which the queen-mother is excused). To one alone they\r\ngive love, and for themselves preserve nothing but wisdom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe characteristic attribute of this child of grace, of whom the whole\r\nmultitude is enamoured, is certain beautiful long legs of gold, or\r\nrather of transparent amber, of a gilded yellow. This rich colour lends\r\nnobility to her belly, and is also found on the edge of her dorsal\r\nrings. Elegant, _svelte_, and noble, she is freed from the drudgery of\r\ndragging the industrial apparatus which overloads the worker,--brushes\r\nand panniers. Like all the bees, she carries a sword,--I mean the\r\nsting,--but never uses it except in a personal combat; nor has she many\r\noccasions, being so surrounded, beset, and overwhelmed with an excess\r\nof love.\r\n\r\nThis mother is very timorous, a trifle is sufficient to terrify her;\r\nat the slightest danger she takes to flight, and conceals herself at\r\nthe bottom of the hive. Her head is not very large, and the unique\r\nfunction which so distinguishes her, is not one of those which tend\r\nto expand the brain. The others have more opportunity of acquiring\r\nknowledge and varying their accomplishments. The little gleaners gather\r\na wide experience Of the country and of life. The bee-architects,\r\nwho, moreover, attend to a thousand unforeseen domestic affairs, are\r\ncompelled to think and develop their intelligence. The mother has but\r\ntwo duties to fulfil.\r\n\r\nOn a sunny day in spring, about three hours after noon, she issues\r\nforth, and out of a myriad males or more she selects a spouse, carries\r\nhim off a moment on her wings, and then rejects him, mutilated; he does\r\nnot survive his felicity. She re-enters her hive, and all is ended. She\r\nis impregnated for four years, the ordinary term of her existence. No\r\nloves can be briefer or more chaste. All her toil, by day and night,\r\nwithout distinction of season,--except for three months of lethargy in\r\nrigorous winters,--is to lay eggs everywhere, and without cessation.\r\nShe flies from cellule to cellule, and in each deposits an egg. Nothing\r\nmore is required of her. She was born for this destiny, and her people\r\nprosper in proportion to her fecundity. If she fell barren, all would\r\nlanguish,--as well as the activity, the labour, and the love which\r\nevery one bestows upon her. The sentiment displayed towards her is\r\nnot so much of a personal character as the idea of utility, of the\r\npreservation and perpetuity of the people, which very visibly prevails.\r\n\r\nThis mother, say our authors, has a somewhat giddy head. Like all\r\nindividuals who have nothing to do, she is volatile and capricious.\r\nAt the end of a year's incubation and sedentary life in the depths of\r\nthe hive, a desire seizes her for the open air, to see a little of the\r\nworld, to visit new countries. She has, nevertheless, a more serious\r\nmotive than they say. She sees the spacious chambers which are being\r\nbuilt for the young mothers who will replace her. She feels that her\r\nrivals are concealed there, and grows fiercely jealous. Incessantly she\r\nprowls around, and but for the assiduous guard which protects them, and\r\nkeeps her away, she would dart her sting through the thin partitions.\r\nConceive, then, what must be her rage when the young captives, ignorant\r\nof her fury and their danger, make imprudent efforts to escape from\r\ntheir cradles, hum and sing aloud their little cicala song, which\r\nis peculiar to the mother of the bees, and so clearly announces to\r\nthe queen the presence of the pretenders? The foresight of the bees,\r\nwhich, to guard against all accidents, has thus reared up the young\r\nmothers, involves them then in difficulty. A frightful combat impends,\r\na wholesale massacre; the old queen-mother, were she allowed, would not\r\nspare one of those odious females. Separation is preferable to civil\r\nwar. The aged sovereign, agitated and distraught, runs everywhere, and\r\nseems to say: \"Let those who love me, follow me.\" She raises a song of\r\ndeparture, and all labour is suspended.\r\n\r\nDetermined to follow her, numbers of the bees make the necessary\r\npreparations, and eat a supply of food which will last them several\r\ndays. The excessive agitation is manifested by a sudden change of\r\ntemperature; from 28° C., the heat of the hive mounts up to 30° or\r\n32°,--a condition of things intolerable to the bees, for to respire\r\neasily is a peculiar feature of their organization. In the extreme\r\nheat they are all bathed in sweat. Therefore they must either set out\r\nor die. The mother sallies forth, and they rush headlong after her.\r\nThey buzz and whirl for a moment round the abandoned home, and then\r\ndart a little further away, describing in the air the most fantastic\r\nand incredible flights. The air is darkened with them. At length some\r\nsettle upon the branch of a neighbouring tree, then numerous others\r\ntake their places, along with the queen. They cling to one another, and\r\ndroop downwards in a large cluster. Tranquillity is re-established. The\r\nother bee communities having taken the alarm, and fearing the invasion\r\nof the fugitives, have guarded their gates, and reinforced their\r\nordinary posts; but now, seeing them settled, they breathe freely, and\r\nreturn to their occupations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile some prudent and faithful messengers are despatched from\r\nthe cluster to examine the neighbouring localities best adapted for\r\na new establishment. M. Debeauvoys was the first to observe this act\r\nof prudence, this special and prudent mission of inspection for the\r\ninformation and guidance of the new colony. A hollow tree, or a cavity\r\nin the rock, protected from the north wind, and near a brook where they\r\ncan conveniently drink, are the conditions which weigh most with our\r\nprudent emigrants. A hive fully prepared and already furnished with\r\nhoney they do not regard with indifference. They are very decisive in\r\ntheir movements, being directed by an excellent sense.\r\n\r\nShall we affirm that they have quitted without regret the native land\r\nwhere they toiled so successfully? And that, having once forsaken it,\r\nthey think of it no more? By no means. The mother especially,--\"giddy\"\r\nas they call her,--has her fancies for return, and twice--nay,\r\nthrice--persists in going back, carrying with her the too devoted\r\ncolony.\r\n\r\nWhat would befall if, in these home-visits, she found herself face to\r\nface with the new queen whom the non-emigrating people have substituted\r\nin her place? There would be a combat. And this, too, happens without\r\nemigration, when, spite of all the efforts that are made to prevent\r\nher, a young mother, having forced her way through the wall of her\r\napartment, reveals to the old queen the detested object of her\r\njealousy. A duel then infallibly takes place. However, as each knows\r\nthe other to be armed with a mortal dart, their natural cowardice would\r\nmoderate their fury, and limit the struggle to a few harmless shocks,\r\nand an innocent wrestle, like the pugilistic display of paid athletes.\r\nBut the people who gather round and look on from a near point of view\r\nare very grave, and mean the affair to be so. Division in the community\r\nwould be the greatest of all evils. Moreover, they are so economical\r\nand temperate for themselves, so parsimonious for others, that they\r\ntake into consideration, I am sure, the enormous cost that would\r\nresult from the establishment of a couple of queens. Each one of them,\r\nroyally nourished as they are, is a serious trouble to the republic.\r\nThe State would be ruined if it had to pay a double budget. Therefore\r\none of them must die. And hence arises a strange spectacle, completely\r\ncharacteristic of the singular spirit of this people: the object of\r\nadoration, recently gorged, and brushed, and caressed,--if she recoil,\r\nis led back to the combat, is impelled and driven into it, until one\r\nof the two antagonists contrives to leap upon the other, and from its\r\nbended and superjacent abdomen plunges into the latter's entrails the\r\nirremissible poignard.\r\n\r\nUnity is thus secured. The survivor, who, if conquered, would have been\r\nflung aside without regret, now that she is victorious becomes the idol\r\nand living deity of the commonwealth; but let her remember, on the\r\nexpress condition of perpetuating the people and proving continuously\r\nprolific.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose a deplorable misfortune,--that every mother has\r\nperished. What then becomes of the orphaned world? Does it fall, as\r\nsome have asserted, into complete demoralization? Does such a calamity\r\nentail a furious anarchy, a universal pillage of the people by the\r\npeople themselves? By no means, says M. Debeauvoys. A few hours of\r\ntrouble, pain, wrath, and apparent delirium follow. The bees flutter\r\nto and fro in great agitation, and suspend their work; for a moment\r\nthey even neglect the nurslings. But a people so grave and dignified\r\nat bottom soon resume their dignity, and remember what they owe to\r\nthemselves. The mother is dead? Long live the mother! We know how to\r\ncreate another. What we were yesterday, so are we to-day.\r\n\r\nThe last will be first. They turn to the youngest child of the people,\r\nwho has barely opened her shell, who has not had time to undergo the\r\nconfinement of a narrow cradle, who has not yet grown lean on the\r\nscanty fare of an artisan. This fare is not honey, but merely the dust\r\nof flowers which naturalists call _bees' bread_. Those who have been\r\npreviously fed upon poorer fare will remain little; they no longer\r\npossess the faculty of transformation.\r\n\r\nBut this young bee, so soft and so tender, will become whatever you\r\nwill; and in order that she may develop into a true female, a bee of\r\nlove, and a prolific mother, what is necessary? Liberty. Let them\r\nprovide her with a vast cradle where her young life may float, and\r\nagitate, and develop, at ease. It will cost three cradles destroyed\r\nto provide for hers, and the lives of three infants, who will perish\r\nbefore birth; but what matter, if in a year she supplies the nation\r\nwith ten thousand?\r\n\r\nThe consecration of the mother of the people is that living nourishment\r\nwhich the people extract from themselves, and in which they mingle\r\ntheir bee-sweetness with the balmy essence of the flowers. A strong and\r\nnoble nourishment, rich in the intoxicating perfume of aromatic herbs,\r\nricher in the virginal love concentrated upon it by thirty thousand\r\nsisters for the behoof of the marvellous child who belongs to them all.\r\n\r\nOn the third day the child sees its cradle extended by an ornament\r\nintended to make it still freer,--a pyramid reversed. On the fifth only\r\ndo they seal it up, to the intent that she may sleep peacefully, and\r\naccomplish her metamorphosis in peace. And then the anxiety increases.\r\nThey guard the beloved sleeper who will be to-morrow the common soul,\r\nand will inspire by her love the labours of the people. They guard\r\nher, and they wait upon her, but with the haughty dignity of a people\r\nwho adore only their own handiwork, chosen by them, nourished by them,\r\ncreated by them, and to be unmade by them. It is their pride that at\r\nneed they know how to create a god.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONCLUSION.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bee and the ant reveal to us the lofty harmony of the insect.\r\n\r\nBoth, in their high intelligence, are of superior rank as artists,\r\narchitects, and the like. The bee is more, a geometer; the ant is\r\nbefore all remarkable as an educator.\r\n\r\nThe ant is frankly and strongly republican, having no need of a living\r\nand visible symbol of the community, lightly esteeming and governing\r\nwith sufficient rudeness the soft and feeble females who perpetuate\r\nthe race. The bee, on the other hand, more tender apparently, or less\r\nreasoning and more imaginative, finds a moral support in the worship of\r\nthe common mother. For her community of virgins it is, so to speak, a\r\nreligion of love.\r\n\r\nAmong both the ants and bees maternity is the social principle; but\r\nfraternity also takes root, flourishes, and springs to a glorious\r\nstature.\r\n\r\nOur book, begun in a profound obscurity, terminates in a fulness of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nTo form a correct judgment of insects, you must examine and estimate\r\ntheir achievements and their societies. If their organization rank\r\nso low as has been said, so much the more are they to be admired for\r\naccomplishing such noble works with such inferior organs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nObserve that the most advanced works are executed by those (as, for\r\nexample, the ants) who have no special implements to facilitate them,\r\nbut must supply the want by skill and invention.\r\n\r\nWere they not so diminutive, what consideration we should extend to\r\ntheir arts and labours! Comparing the cities of the termites with the\r\ncabins of the negro, the subterranean galleries of the ants with the\r\nlittle excavations of our Tourangeaux of the Loire, how we should\r\ndwell on the superior skill of the insects! Is it stature, then, which\r\nchanges your moral judgments? What are the proportions which will merit\r\nyour esteem?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet us add, that if this book do not modify the opinion of the reader,\r\nit has greatly modified our own. This, in the course of our labour,\r\nhas undergone a considerable change. We thought we were going to study\r\nthings, and found them _souls_.\r\n\r\nClose daily observation, initiating us into their ways and habits,\r\ndeveloped in our minds a sentiment which animated our study, but also\r\ncomplicated it,--respect for their persons and lives.\r\n\r\n\"What say you? An ant's existence? Nature holds them cheaply, renews\r\nthem incessantly, prodigalizes lives, sacrifices them to one another.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nYes, but because she makes them. She bestows life and withdraws it; has\r\nthe secret of their destinies, and that of the compensations in the\r\ncourse of possible progress. But as for us, we have no power over them,\r\nexcept to make them suffer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis is a grave reflection. We are not talking here of any childish\r\nsensibility. On the contrary, neither children nor men of science\r\ncherish any such feeling. But a man--man accustomed to reason with\r\nhimself and estimate his acts--will not lightly deprive any creature of\r\nthat gift of life which it is utterly out of his power to confer on the\r\nmost insignificant. This consideration impressed us strongly. And at\r\nfirst a person, a woman, more impressionable and more scrupulous than\r\nmyself, who had come hither with the design of making a collection of\r\nthe insects of Fontainebleau, hesitated, deferred the task; and then,\r\nhaving interrogated her conscience, felt compelled to renounce it.\r\nWithout uttering a word of censure upon scientific collections, which\r\nare absolutely indispensable, it is certain that we ought not to find\r\na pastime in death. Note that many of these creatures are much less\r\nimportant in form and colour than by attitude and movement, which\r\ncannot be preserved at the extremity of a pin!\r\n\r\nOur first discussion of this kind was in reference to the fate of\r\na very remarkable butterfly (a sphinx, if I mistake not), which we\r\ncaught in a net to examine for a moment. I had admired it for several\r\ndays, coming and going among the flowers,--not, like most of its race,\r\nflying hap-hazard, but choosing them discreetly, and then, with a very\r\nfine, very long and arrowy proboscis, sucking by small sips, and very\r\nquickly withdrawing, as if acted upon by a steel spring. The movement\r\nwas one of incomparable grace, of coquettish sobriety; just as if it\r\nsaid: \"Enough for to-day,--enough! But, to-morrow!\" I have never seen\r\nanything more graceful.\r\n\r\nIt is only a gray butterfly, and not at all remarkable. Who that sees\r\nit dead would divine that, in charming nimbleness, it is the favourite\r\nof Nature, in which she has exhausted all her grace?\r\n\r\nWe opened the net. And not long afterwards we had the pleasure of\r\nseeing the same butterfly, which, in bad weather, came one evening to\r\ntake shelter with us, and found a resting-place in our chamber. In the\r\nmorning, wishful to enjoy the sunshine, it flew away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI ought to add, moreover, that all the shipwrecked unfortunates of\r\nthe latter end of autumn, guided by a very sure but very surprising\r\ninstinct, willingly came to our house,--some on a temporary visit,\r\nothers to remain with us. A young bullfinch, in a bad condition,\r\nand who had evidently met with more than one adventure, arrived all\r\nbewildered, and even on the first day ate from our hands. The same\r\nthing happened with a still more miserable creature,--a little tiny\r\nred-tail, which had been barbarously deprived of its head-feathers that\r\nit might be sold for a nightingale. This creature, so ill-treated by\r\nmen, which might justly have been afraid of them, not only took at the\r\nvery first the seed from our hands and lips, but would not sleep except\r\non the mistress's finger.\r\n\r\nAs for insects, their domestication is impossible. But many,\r\nnevertheless, seem able to live with man, to appreciate peaceable\r\npeople and mildness of character. Last winter, two pretty red\r\nlady-birds had taken up their residence on our table, among our books\r\nand papers, which were being constantly moved about. What to give them,\r\nwe knew not; they passed the whole season without eating, or appearing\r\nto receive any injury. The warmth of the apartment seemed agreeable to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA strong September wind is now blowing, and, this very day, has cast\r\nin upon us a beautiful reddish-coloured caterpillar. Though she had\r\nnot come of her own accord, but in spite of herself, we felt that we\r\nought to respect misfortune. We did not know from what plant she had\r\nbeen torn, but supposed from her motions that she had been carried away\r\nat the moment she had begun to spin. We presented her with a variety\r\nof leaves; but none of them pleased her taste. She moved to and fro,\r\ndisplaying an extraordinary agitation. We supposed she wished to find\r\nrest upon a branch, but the rain fell in torrents. As many caterpillars\r\nand larvæ work underground, we brought it some earth. But this, too,\r\nwas useless. Thinking she might like a web at a time when she was\r\nengaged in weaving, we placed her on the lace-work of a cushion which\r\nlay in the window; but the lace was cold and coarse, and did not please\r\nher. Moreover, the wind, the little wind which entered, would have\r\ncruelly frozen her during a whole winter. Finally, by a feminine marvel\r\nof intuition, we concluded that, since she was about to weave silk, she\r\nwould like the silk-velvet lining of our microscope.\r\n\r\nPlainly, it was the very thing she herself would have chosen. Installed\r\nin the evening, by the morning she had made herself at home in this\r\nsoft, warm, and sheltered place. She had already spun, and hastily\r\nextended her threads to right and left, as if fearing she might be\r\ndisturbed. Then, during the day, her work having been respected, she\r\nsaw that she had miscalculated her measurements, and that her cocoon\r\nwas too short; she destroyed a third of it, to resume the fabric from\r\nthat point on better proportions.\r\n\r\nBehold, then, microscope, and scalpel, and all our instruments\r\nexpelled. What could we do? The confiding animal had taken up a\r\nposition at our fireside, and would not withdraw from it. Life had\r\ndriven out Science. Grave study, wait! for awhile thou art adjourned.\r\nDuring the winter we respected the sleep of the chrysalis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Illustrative Notes.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustrative Notes.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 1.\r\n\r\n_The Meaning of this Book._--It has sprung wholly from the heart.\r\nNothing has been given up to the intellect, nothing to systems. We have\r\nabstained from entering into scientific disputes.\r\n\r\nIf the following formula should seem to you too systematic, pass over\r\nit. We have not sought to embody a dogma in it. We would only simplify,\r\nif possible, the point of view, and place it in the reader's power to\r\nembrace the whole significance of the book.\r\n\r\nThe point of departure is violent. It is the gigantic and necessary\r\nwar waged by the insect upon all morbid or encumbering life that might\r\nprove an obstacle to life. A terrible war, an infernal toil, which,\r\nensures the safety of the world.\r\n\r\nThis powerful accelerator of the universal passage should destroy like\r\nfire. But to secure the sharpness of action such a mission requires,\r\nit is necessary that its own transformations be accelerated, its life\r\ncompressed; that from love to death, and death to love, it revolve\r\nin a burning circle. However brief may be this circle, it cannot be\r\naccomplished but at the cost of painful metamorphoses, which resemble a\r\nseries of successive deaths.\r\n\r\nAmong most insects, marriage means the death of the father; maternity,\r\nthe death of the mother. Thus the generations pass away without knowing\r\none another. The mother loves her daughter, anticipates her birth,\r\noften immolates herself for her sake, but will never see her.\r\n\r\nThis cruel contradiction, this harsh denial which Nature opposes to the\r\nmost pathetic aspirations of love, apparently inflames and irritates\r\nit. It gives everything unreservedly, knowing that it is for death.\r\nIt draws from it two powers; on the one hand, unheard _tongues of\r\nlight and colour_, ravishing phantasmagorias, in which love is not\r\ntranslated, but expands in rays, and pharos-fires, and torches, and\r\nburning sparks. It is the appeal to the rapid present, the lightning\r\nand the thunder of happiness. But the love of the to come, the\r\nforeseeing tenderness for that which not yet is, is expressed in\r\nanother fashion by the astonishingly complex and ingenious creation of\r\na storehouse of implements, whence all our mechanical arts have derived\r\ntheir most perfect models. Usually this grand apparatus of tools serves\r\nbut for a day; it enables them at the moment they forsake the orphan to\r\nimprovise the cradle which shall continue the mother, shall perpetuate\r\nthe incubation when the mother ceases to exist.\r\n\r\nBut how? Must she indeed perish? Can there be no exception to the\r\npitiless law? In hot climates, especially, many mothers may survive.\r\nWhat if these mothers united together to deceive destiny, by\r\nassociating so many brief existences in one common and lasting life in\r\nwhich their children should find an eternal mother?\r\n\r\nHow shall we elude death?--Let us create society.\r\n\r\nThe society of mothers. The insect is essentially a female and a\r\nmother. The male is an exception, a secondary accident,--frequently,\r\ntoo, an abortion, a caricature of an insect.\r\n\r\nThe dream of the female--maternity, and the safety of her child--the\r\npreservation of the future--leads her to create the community, which\r\nsecures her own safety.\r\n\r\nThis society can only perpetuate itself by ensuring its existence\r\nagainst the season of sterility. Hence results a need of accumulation.\r\nHence proceed labour and economy.\r\n\r\nBut Nature, eluded by the effort and the toil,--I was going to say,\r\nthe virtue,--does not lose its rights. Beaten on the one side, on the\r\nother it reacts upon the commonwealth, and grievously oppresses it.\r\nThis self-protecting society, while rescuing immense multitudes from\r\ndeath and prolonging the common existence, multiplies the mouths to be\r\nfed, and is often overloaded. If its members would not die of famine,\r\nthey must live on a very scanty regimen, must preserve alive a limited\r\nnumber of fertile females, and condemn the majority, or nearly the\r\nwhole of the females to celibacy. Reared for virginity and labour,\r\nsterilized from the cradle in their maternal powers, they are by no\r\nmeans of barren intellect. The extinction of certain faculties seems to\r\nstrengthen the others.\r\n\r\nSuch is the institution, ingeniously severe, of aunts or adoptive\r\nmothers. With too little sexual feeling to desire love, they possess\r\nenough to wish for children, to love and adopt them. They are both less\r\nthan mothers, and more than mothers. Should invasion or ruin befall\r\nthe hive or the ant-hill, the true mothers consult their own safety in\r\nflight; the devoted aunts or sisters know no other thought but that of\r\nsaving the children.\r\n\r\nElevated by this factitious maternity and disinterested love above\r\nitself, the insect surpasses all other creatures,--even those which,\r\nlike the mammals, are evidently superior in organization. It teaches us\r\nthat organism is not everything, and that there is a potency in life\r\nwhich acts strongly beyond the range and in despite of the organs.\r\nThose species which, like the ants, have no special instruments to\r\nfacilitate their work, are invariably the most advanced.\r\n\r\nThe noblest work of the world, the most elevated goal to which its\r\ninhabitants tend, is the community,--by which I mean a society strongly\r\nconsolidated. The only being, besides Man, who seems to reach this\r\ngoal, is undoubtedly the Insect.\r\n\r\nNo other creature approaches it. The most sublime and charming, the\r\nBird, is, through these very qualities, also the most individual. Its\r\nsociety is the family; its community, the nest; its associations are\r\nonly collocations of nests for the sake of security. Those mammals\r\nwhich, approach us so nearly, and impress us so strongly by their\r\nadvanced organisation,--I mean, the beaver,--show wonderful powers\r\nof combination for the execution of their task; but, when the work\r\nis done, they retire to their own houses and families, isolated by\r\nthe very tenderness of their domestic affections. The assembly of the\r\nbeavers is, as it were, a colony of builders and engineers, where each\r\none lives apart; but they are not citizens, and it is not a city.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe city is only to be found in the insect world. Separated from man by\r\nmany degrees in organism, the insect approaches him more closely than\r\nany other being in the supreme work of his life,--which is, to live for\r\nthe many. It has not those touching signs of close relationship which\r\nrender the higher animals so interesting to us. It has no blood; it has\r\nno milk. But I recognize it as akin by one loftier attribute: it has\r\nthe social sense.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn ignorant dogmatism had long asserted that the very perfection\r\nof these insect-societies depended on their automatism. But modern\r\nobservation has proved, that if the conditions are varied, and\r\nunforeseen obstacles and difficulties placed in their way, they\r\nconfront them with vigour and calm sense, and with the resources of an\r\nunfettered ingenuity,\r\n\r\nIt is a world of _method_, which, at need, can show itself\r\n_unrestrained_.\r\n\r\nA world which, presently, in its original mission of combat and\r\ndestruction, seemed to us an atrociously fatal force; but which\r\nafterwards, by the influence of its maternal devotion, became a world\r\nof social harmony, preaching a lofty morality.\r\n\r\nBut is _maternity_ all? No; the community of life introduces the insect\r\nto the threshold of a still higher rank of sentiments. Even among those\r\nwhich are isolated--among the necrophori, for example, and the pilulary\r\nscarabæi--_fraternal_ co-operation has a beginning. They render mutual\r\nservices, and fly to the assistance of one another, co-operating in\r\ncertain works. Among the sociable insects the feeling is carried to a\r\nconsiderable height; the bees feed one another, mouth to mouth, and\r\nstint themselves to supply their sisters. A very safe, and by no means\r\nromantic observer, saw an ant dressing the wound of another ant which\r\nhad lost an antenna, by pouring on it some honey-dew to close it up and\r\nprotect it from the air.\r\n\r\nSee now how far we have advanced from our starting-point, where the\r\ninsect appeared to us a pure voracious element, a machine of absorption.\r\n\r\nA great, a sublime metamorphosis, more marvellous than that of the\r\nmoultings and transformations which guided the egg, the grub, the\r\nnymph, to the assumption of wings.\r\n\r\nIt is a world strange to man, but singularly parallel to our own,\r\nthough having no mutual mode of communication. We invent scarcely\r\nanything which has not previously--though for a long time unknown to\r\nus--been invented by the insect.\r\n\r\nWhat have the great animals discovered? Nothing. Apparently their\r\nwarmth of life, and their red blood, obscure their mental light.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, the insect world, free from a heavy apparatus of flesh\r\nand blood intoxication, more subtly sensitive, and moved by a nervous\r\nelectricity, seems a frightful world of spirits.\r\n\r\nFrightful? No. If terror sit at the threshold of science, safety is\r\nfound in its _penetralia_. At the first glance the living energy of\r\nthe invisible may startle us; and with a shudder of alarm we may\r\ncontemplate in the animalcule the likeness, some flashes of the\r\nindividuality, or a certain undefinable something which seems like a\r\ncounterfeit, of man.\r\n\r\nThese gleams, which so troubled the great Swammerdam, and made him\r\nrecoil with dread, are precisely the circumstances that give me\r\nencouragement. Yes; all see, all feel, and all love: a miracle truly\r\nreligious! In the material infinite which deepens under my eyes, I\r\nrecognize, for my reassurance, a moral infinite. The individuality\r\nhitherto claimed as a monopoly by the pride of the chosen species, I\r\nsee generously extended to all, and conferred even upon the least. The\r\ngulf of life would have seemed to me deserted, desolate, barren, and\r\ngodless, had I not everywhere discovered the warmth and tenderness of\r\nthe Universal Love in the universality of the soul.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 2.\r\n\r\n_Our Authorities._--In a book which puts forward no scientific\r\npretensions, the book of an unlearned writer dedicated to unlearned\r\nreaders, we do not hesitate to confess that our method of study was\r\nvery indirect. If we had commenced with subtle classificators or minute\r\nanatomists, or with dry manuals of instruction, perhaps we should\r\nhave been checked at the first step. But we approached this science\r\non its attractive side--through the great historians of the insect,\r\nwho have united the delineation of its habits with the description\r\nof its organs. Our mind had received a strong and decisive blow (if\r\nwe may so speak) from the hooks of the two Hubers on the Bees and\r\nthe Ants. The impression was so great, that thereafter we read with\r\ninterest what one does not usually read continuously, Réaumur's six\r\nquarto volumes of _Mémoires_--an immortal book, which must always be\r\na standard authority. Neither the contemptuous reaction of Buffon,\r\nnor the anatomical works, of superior exactness on special points,\r\nwhich have since been produced, should cause it to be forgotten.\r\nRéaumur was, as it were, the central point of our studies, and from\r\nhim we went back to the illustrious masters of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, Swammerdam and Malpighi; next, we descended to those of the\r\neighteenth, the Lyonnets, Bonnets, and Geers; finally, to our modern\r\nwriters, Latreille, Duméril, Lepelletier, Blanchard,--to the fertile\r\nand audacious school of the Geoffroy Saint-Hilaires and the Audouins,\r\ngloriously supported by Ampère and Goethe. While profiting by the noble\r\ntreatises which sum up the main results of the science, like those\r\nof Lacordaire, we by no means neglected the admirable monographs of\r\nthe present, century,--those of Léon Dufour (scattered through the\r\n_Annales des Sciences Naturelles_, and other collections), the grand\r\nwork of Walckenaër on the Spiders, the colossal labour of Strauss\r\non the Cockchafer--a monument of the first class, which can only be\r\ncompared to Lyonnet's treatise on the Caterpillar. As for details drawn\r\nfrom travellers, we shall hereafter have an opportunity of referring\r\nto them. We shall also acknowledge our debt to foreign writers,--to\r\nKirby, Smeathman, Lund, and others. For the anatomy of the insect, as\r\nfor general anatomy, we cannot too strongly recommend the admirable\r\nand usefully enlarged specimens prepared by our excellent master, Dr.\r\nAuzoux.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 3.--Book i., Chap. iii.\r\n\r\n_On Insect Embryos, Invisible Animalcules, Infusorias as the\r\nPredecessors or Forerunners of the Insect, &c._--The work of the\r\n_vermets_ has been observed, in Sicily, by M. de Quatrefages.--As for\r\nthe microscopic fossils, the infusorias, &c., their great _coup de\r\nthéâtre_ has been Ehrenberg's discovery.

In volume i., p. 134, for 1834, he specifies the point at\r\nwhich Cuvier left the science, and how much his discovery has added to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nUpon the living world, upon the processes at present in operation\r\nfor the creation of little spheres, on those humble constructors who\r\naccomplish such great things, we owe all our information to the English\r\nvoyagers, the Nelsons,[S] the Darwins, and others. They are minute and\r\nvery simple observers, generally timid in their assertions, which have\r\nbeen of the boldest character, they having seen the very heart of the\r\nmystery, and caught Nature in the act. Read Darwin (whose researches\r\nhave been most ably summed up by Sir Charles Lyell) for information on\r\nthe prodigious manufacture of chalk, divided alternately between the\r\nfishes and the polypes, which are building up islands with it, and will\r\nsoon construct continents.\r\n\r\n[Footnote S: \"Nous devons tout aux navigateurs Anglais, aux Nelson, aux\r\nDarwin,\" etc.]\r\n\r\nEngland alone, that immense _poulpe_ whose arms enfold the earth, and\r\nwho incessantly _feels_ and examines it, could observe it thoroughly in\r\nits distant solitudes, where at its ease it continues its everlasting\r\nprocreation. The great theories formerly advanced in explanation of the\r\ncataclysms, epochs, and revolutions of the earth, will lose, perhaps,\r\nsomething of their importance. For we know now that everything is in a\r\nstate of constant change.\r\n\r\nDoes Europe perceive that quite a complete literature has sprung from\r\nGreat Britain in the last twenty years? I describe it as an immense\r\ncommission of inquiry into the condition of the globe, undertaken by\r\nthe English. They alone could do it. And why? Because other nations\r\n_travel_, but only the English _reside_. They daily recommence at all\r\npoints of the earth the life-study of a Robinson Crusoe: and this\r\nis done by a crowd of isolated observers, led abroad by commercial\r\nspeculation, and hence so much the less systematical in their inquiries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 4.--Book i., Chap. iv.\r\n\r\n(_Love and Death._) _On the Female Apparatus._--Réaumur,--and, in fact,\r\nevery writer,--has admired the manner in which the weapons of war\r\nbecome the instruments of maternal love. M. Lacase, in a very beautiful\r\nthesis, the result of independent observations, and a continuation of\r\nthe analogous works of an eminent master, Léon Dufour, has treated this\r\nsubject with great anatomical preciseness. An original and important\r\npoint of his labour is, undoubtedly, his demonstration, conformably\r\nto the views of Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, Serres, Audouin, and others,\r\n\"that the very various armours which prolong the abdomen imply the\r\nmodification, or even the sacrifice, of one or two of its posterior\r\nrings.\" Thus Nature apparently operates upon a fixed, amount of\r\nsubstance, only increasing one part at the expense of others, which are\r\nshortened or transformed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 5.--Book i., Chap. v.\r\n\r\n_The Chilly Offspring of the Insect._--\"But,\" the reader will exclaim,\r\n\"what labour! How terrible a law of continuous efforts to be imposed\r\non young beings, as yet but ill provided with tools, and without, that\r\nsuperb arsenal of implements which at a later stage we admire in the\r\ninsect. How protracted are the means devised for their defence, which\r\nwould be much sooner accomplished if they were born less soft, a\r\nlittle firmer, and somewhat less impressionable.\"\r\n\r\nYes; but in that case they would be just so far unfitted for the\r\nessential circumstance which ensures their development. Nature\r\nwishes them to be soft, ay, and very soft, that they may more easily\r\nundergo the moultings and painful changes which are imperative upon\r\nthem,--which moultings, if the insect-substance were hard, would\r\ninflict upon it the most severe injuries. By instinct they are aware\r\nof this, and dread extremely lest their bodies should harden. The\r\n_processionary_ caterpillars, for example, though covered thickly with\r\nhair, conceal themselves from the sun under ample curtains. And they\r\nare also mindful to issue forth only in the evening, when the damp and\r\nmisty air may preserve their salutary humidity.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 6.--Book i., Chap. vii.\r\n\r\n_The Appearance of the Perfect Insect._--The anatomy of the insect\r\nhas been the theme of one of the greatest disputes of our time. Some\r\none having visited Goethe, soon after the French Revolution of July\r\n1830:--\"Well, well,\" inquired the illustrious sage, \"have they settled\r\nthe question?\" And as the traveller seemed to think he referred to the\r\npolitical question, \"Oh, it is something of far greater importance!\"\r\nsaid Goethe; \"I refer to the great duel between Cuvier and Geoffroy.\"\r\n\r\nThe world took part in it. Strauss and others remained faithful to\r\nCuvier. The great physicist Ampère, in an anonymous article inserted in\r\nthe first volume of the _Annales des Sciences Naturelles_, adopted the\r\nopinions of Geoffroy, Audouin, and Serres, and even expressed them with\r\na juvenile audacity that these anatomists, in their modesty, had not\r\ndisplayed.\r\n\r\nAll the complex details of their proceedings had been extracted and\r\nprepared [by Madame Michelet] for the present volume with a patience\r\nand persevering love such as could be inspired only by a true and\r\ntender religion of Nature. Barbarian that I am, I must sacrifice this\r\narduous labour, which, perhaps, would not be much relished by the\r\npublic to whom I address myself.\r\n\r\nThe place which the insect occupies in the animal creation is very\r\nclearly defined in Lacordaire's excellent _résumé_:--\"Equal to the\r\nvertebrates in the energy of its muscular fibre, scarcely inferior to\r\nthem in the organization of its digestive canal, superior even to the\r\nbird by the quantity of its respiration, it falls below the molluscs\r\nthrough the imperfection of its system of circulation. Its nervous\r\nsystem is less concentrated than that of many of the crustacea.\"\r\n(Lacordaire, vol. ii., p. 2.)\r\n\r\nHas the insect a brain? It is a disputed question. The nervous\r\napparatus which, in the molluscs, has not found, so far, a centre,\r\ntends, it is true, in the insect, towards centralization. Two\r\nlongitudinal strings of nerves, which run through the entire length\r\nof the body, abut on the nerves of the head, which are not massed\r\nas in the higher animal. In the wasp, however, has been discovered\r\na firm, whitish substance, strongly resembling the brain. But this\r\nwould seem exceptional. Even in the head of insects remarkable for\r\ntheir intelligence, you will find only simple nervous ganglions, not\r\ndiffering in any respect from those which compose the two threads.\r\n\r\nThis inferiority of organization does but render more surprising the\r\nsuperiority of the insect in art and sociability to all other animals,\r\neven to the principal mammals (with a single exception). Here at the\r\nhighest point of the ladder, there at the lowest, it occupies, on the\r\nwhole, a middle place; and is, as it were, in the scale of existence,\r\nan energetic mediator between life and death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 7.--Book ii., Chap. i.\r\n\r\n_Swammerdam._--We refer to the inaugurator and martyr of our science,\r\nthe creator of the instrument which has enabled men to follow up\r\nhis discoveries,--a great inventor in many senses,--specially for\r\nthe preparation of anatomical specimens. The reader should study\r\nhis _Biblia Naturæ_, in Boerhaave's edition, ornamented with fine\r\nillustrations (two vols. folio), and not in the incomplete French\r\nabridgment, published in the _Mémoires_ of the Academy of Dijon, which\r\ngives the scientific results, but no trace of the man.\r\n\r\nWe do not undertake to write the history of Entomology. A good\r\nabridgment will be found at the end of M. Th. Lacordaire's\r\n_Introduction à l'Entomologie_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 8.--Book ii., Chap. iv.\r\n\r\n_The Insect as Man's Auxiliary._--The ingenious work which I here\r\nconfute, and which, assuredly, cannot be read with gratification, is\r\nentitled,--_Les Insectes, ou Réflexions d'un amateur de la chasse aux\r\npetits oiseaux_, par E. Gand, _Lecture faite à l'Académie d'Amiens_\r\n(26th December 1856).\r\n\r\nA remark which I make a few pages further on, in reference to the\r\nnecessity of a popular teaching of natural history, well deserves\r\nto gain attention. The wealth and morality of the world would be\r\ndoubled if this teaching could be universal. M. Emile Blanchard's\r\nimportant work, _Zoologie Agricole_ (in folio, 1854), gives the very\r\nuseful history of the principal insects injurious to our ordinary\r\nor ornamental plants. M. Pouchet, in his excellent _Mémoire_ on the\r\nCockchafer, enumerates the principal authors who have described the\r\ndestructive insects. The United States Congress has entrusted to Mr.\r\nHarris the preparation of a history of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 9.--Book ii., Chap. v.\r\n\r\n_Light and Colour._--My description of tropical climates is borrowed\r\nfrom a large number of travellers,--Humboldt, Azara, Auguste,\r\nSaint-Hilaire, Castelneau, Weddell, Charles Waterton, and others. For\r\nBrazil and Guiana, I have been greatly indebted to the exceeding\r\ncourtesy of M. Ferdinand Denis, whose knowledge of those countries is\r\nso perfect.\r\n\r\nParis possesses several fine collections of insects, besides that of\r\nthe Museum. One of the best-known is Doctor Bois Duval's (lepidoptera).\r\nAn establishment exclusively devoted to the sale of insects may be\r\nfound at No. 17 Rue des Saints-Pères. The magnificent collection to\r\nwhich I refer on page 176, is that of M. Douë, who most readily showed\r\nit to us, and explained it with infinite complaisance.\r\n\r\nThe anecdote which concludes chapter xii. (_The Ornament of Living\r\nFlames_) is related, in reference to the women of Santa Cruz in\r\nBolivia, by the always accurate Dr. Weddell. The Indian phrase,\r\n\"Replace it whence thou borrowedst it,\" is recorded by Waterton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 10.--Book ii., Chap. viii.\r\n\r\n_Renovation of Human Arts by Study of the Insect._--Who has not seen\r\nthat for a long time the art of decoration has made no progress, does\r\nbut incessantly repeat itself? When a particular subject has lasted\r\nten years, men think to rejuvenate it with a few variations. In a life\r\nof half a century I have several times seen this rotation of fashion,\r\nwhich would appear singularly monotonous if we did not possess in so\r\nhigh a degree the gift of forgetfulness.\r\n\r\nThe decorative art, instead of seeking its renovation in the things\r\nof old, would profit greatly by drawing its inspiration from the\r\ninfinity of beauties distributed throughout Nature. They abound and\r\nsuperabound:--\r\n\r\n1st, In the highly accented forms of tropical plants. Ours only produce\r\ntheir effect in masses, and on a grand scale.\r\n\r\n2nd, In those of a great number of the lower animals, radiata,\r\nand others; in many of the little floating molluscs, living and\r\nimperceptible flowers, the design of which, when enlarged, might\r\nsuggest some very original ideas.\r\n\r\n3rd, In certain parts of the most despised creatures; as, for example,\r\nin the eyes of the fly.\r\n\r\n4th, In the forms, designs, and colours one detects in the thickness\r\nof the living tissue; as, for example, on lifting with the scalpel\r\nthe strata of the wing-sheath of the beetles. Nature, which has so\r\nembellished the surface, has hidden, perhaps, still more beauty in\r\nthe depth. Nothing is finer than the vital fluids, when seen in the\r\nmobility of their circulation, and in the delicate canals where\r\nthat circulation is accomplished and defined. They speak to us less\r\neloquently, and impress us less forcibly by the splendour of the\r\nglittering leaves among which they circulate, than by the expressive\r\nforms in which we divine the mystery of their life. These are their\r\nvisible energies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 11.--Book ii., Chaps. ix. and x.\r\n\r\n_The Spider._--These two chapters are mainly the result of our own\r\nobservations. We have profited, however, by several authorities;\r\nespecially by the capital and classical work, the grand labour\r\nof Walckenaër,--which is of importance both for the description,\r\nclassification, and moral history of the Spiders.\r\n\r\nAzara tells us that in Paraguay the natives spin the cocoon of a great\r\norange-coloured spider fully an inch in diameter. Sir George Staunton,\r\nthe English ambassador to China, in his \"Travels in Java\" (vol. i., p.\r\n343) informs us that the epeiras of Asia weave such stout webs that\r\nthey can only be cut with a sharp-edged instrument; at the Bermudas,\r\ntheir webs are capable of arresting the progress of a bird as big as a\r\nthrush (Richard Stafford, _Coll. Acad._, ii., p. 156).\r\n\r\nDoctor Lemercier, our learned bibliographer, has lent to me (from his\r\npersonal collection) a rare and very clever _brochure_ by Quatrefages\r\non the hygrometrical sensibility of spiders, on their prescience\r\nof variations of the temperature--which we might very well turn to\r\nadvantage--and on the skilful exposure of their webs.\r\n\r\nThe formation of their beautiful and poetical autumn-webs, which are\r\ncalled _Virgin's Threads_, is very clearly explained by Des Étang, in\r\nthe _Mémoires de la Société Agricole de Troyes_, for 1839.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the spider's most terrible enemy, the ichneumon, some\r\ncurious details are given in the fourth volume of the _Memoirs_ of the\r\nAmerican Society. In order to preserve it for its little ones, it does\r\nnot kill its victim, but, if one may so speak, etherizes it by pricking\r\nit, and distilling into the wound a venom which apparently paralyzes it.\r\n\r\nMy remarks on the terror of the male in his amorous advances are based\r\nupon those of De Geer, and Lepelletier, in the _Nouveau Bulletin de la\r\nSociété Philomathique_, pt. 67, p. 257.\r\n\r\nFinally, the master-work of the spider, the ingeniously\r\nconstructed house and door of the _Mygale_ of Corsica, has been\r\ncompletely described and drawn by an observer whom one can trust\r\nimplicitly,--Audouin (followed by Walckenaër, and others).\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 12.-Book iii., Chap. i.\r\n\r\n_The Termites._--The beautiful illustrations of Smeathman would merit\r\nreproduction, and the translation of his book (ed. 1784), now very\r\nrarely met with, ought to be reprinted. The interesting additional\r\ndetails collected by Azara, Auguste, Saint-Hilaire, Castelneau, and\r\nothers, might be added, so as to make a complete monograph.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is by no means a matter of slight import to recognize that the true\r\nand grand principle of art, so long misunderstood in the Middle Ages,\r\nhas been always followed to the very letter by creatures of so low an\r\norder, in their surprising constructions.\r\n\r\nThe fact I have related in reference to the subterranean mining of\r\nValencia by the termites, will be found in Humboldt's \"Travels in\r\nEquinoctial America.\"\r\n\r\nAs for La Rochelle, read the interesting chapter in M. de Quatrefages'\r\n_Souvenirs d'un Naturaliste_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 13.--Book iii., Chap. ii.\r\n\r\n_The Ants._--The migrations of the tropical ants, say Azara and\r\nLacordaire, sometimes last over two or three days. They are to be\r\ncompared in continuousness and frightful numbers only to the clouds\r\nof pigeons which, in North America, obscure the sky for several\r\ndays in succession (see Audubon). Lund (_Annales des Sciences\r\nNaturelles_, 1831, vol. xxiii., p. 113) gives a curious picture of\r\nthese ant-migrations. They are terribly warlike, and the Americans\r\namuse themselves by opposing in a duel the _visiting ant_ (Atta) to\r\nthe _Araraa_ ant. The latter, though the weaker, prevails through the\r\npotency of its poison.\r\n\r\nAs for our European ants, my brother-in-law, M. Hippolyte Mialaret,\r\ntransmits to me a curious fact, which, I believe, has not before been\r\nobserved. He gave them a medley of various kinds of grain,--wheat,\r\nbarley, rye,--which they employed in their buildings. Having opened the\r\nant-hill, he found the grains carefully classified, and distributed on\r\ndifferent stories,--wheat, for example, on the second, barley on the\r\nthird,--the different kinds being nowhere mixed.\r\n\r\nAn excellent Italian dissertation by M. Giuseppe Gené would induce one\r\nto believe Huber mistaken in his assertion that the mother ant can by\r\nher unaided self found a community. After her fecundation she retires\r\ninto a corner, where she plucks off her wings, and waits. There some\r\nprowling ants discover, feel, and recognize her, her and her eggs sown\r\non the ground, with much prudence and even visible mistrust. Afterwards\r\nthey explore the country round about with an infinite circumspection,\r\nalways coming back to the mother, and hesitating long before they\r\ndecide. At length, their numbers increasing, they definitively adopt\r\nher, and set to work.\r\n\r\nThe indomitable perseverance of the ants is celebrated in a beautiful\r\nOriental legend of I know not what Asiatic prince,--Tamerlane, I\r\nbelieve. Beaten and defeated several times in one campaign, he was\r\nseated, almost despairing, in the depth of his tent. An ant mounted the\r\nside. Several times he made it drop, but it invariably reascended. He\r\nwas curious to see how long it would persevere, and twenty-four times\r\nthrew it to the ground without discouraging it. Then he grew tired,\r\nand moreover he was full of admiration. The ant conquered. So he said:\r\n\"Let us imitate it. We too will conquer as the ant has done.\" But for\r\nthe ant, the hero had missed the Empire of Asia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 14.--Book iii., Chap. iii.\r\n\r\n_Flocks of the Ants._--Nearly every plant nourishes grubs, which are\r\nembellished with the most varied, and frequently the most dazzling\r\ncolours. The rose-tree aphis, when I examined it through a microscope,\r\nseemed to me of a very pleasant bright green. Thrown on its back, it\r\ndisplayed a very big belly, and a very small ungainly head, which\r\nappeared to be neither more nor less than a sucker, while it agitated\r\nall its limbs. On the whole, I took it to be an innocent creature,\r\nwhich should inspire no repugnant feeling. One can understand how the\r\nants absorb the honey-dew upon its body. (See Bonnet and others, in\r\nreference to their prodigious fecundity.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 15.--Book iii., Chap. v.\r\n\r\n_The Wasps._--Before speaking of this terrible species, in which,\r\nperhaps, we see revealed the loftiest energy of nature, I ought to\r\nhave spoken of its modest neighbour, the drone. Réaumur, who is not\r\nsufficiently known as a writer, and who frequently displays much\r\ngrace of style, says, very pleasingly, that the poor drones, in their\r\nrough little societies, when compared with the royal communities of\r\nthe wasps and bees, are mere rustics or savages, and their nests so\r\nmany hamlets, but that we find a pleasure, even after having visited\r\ngreat capitals, in resting our eyes on the simplicity of villages and\r\nvillagers. (Réaumur, _Mémoires_, vol. vi., p. iii. preface, and p. 4\r\ntext.) Notwithstanding their simplicity, the drones are industrious,\r\nand have their characteristic manners and virtues. The poor males, so\r\ndespised elsewhere, are more happily employed here in a society where\r\nthe lofty speciality of art, not being so strikingly developed in the\r\nfemales, proves less humiliating; they are almost the equals of their\r\nspouses, who do not massacre them, as the wasps and bees do their\r\ndestined husbands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 16.--Book iii., Chap. viii.\r\n\r\n_The Wax-making Bees. An Aristocracy of Artists._--I here follow,\r\nin the main, the authority of M. Debeauvoys, in his _Guide de\r\nl'Apiculteur_ (\"The Bee-keeper's Manual\"), ed. 1853. In this little\r\nbut important book he has made the all-important distinction which\r\nescaped Huber's notice, and separated the great wax-making architects\r\nfrom the little gleaners and nurses. But I ask his permission to trust\r\nrather to M. Dujardin on the general character of the bees. They are,\r\nundoubtedly, choleric, and of a very dry temperament; the liqueurs and\r\nperfumes of the flowers excite them, and compel them frequently to\r\nquench their thirst. But in themselves they are sufficiently gentle,\r\nand can even be tamed. M. Dujardin, having renewed every day the\r\nprovisions of a poor hive, was readily recognized by the bees, who flew\r\ntowards him, and ran over his hands without stinging him. The annual\r\ndestruction which they consummate of their males is a common law with\r\nthem; the wasps, and other necessitous tribes, living in dread of\r\nfamine at the epoch when the flowers disappear. In America they are\r\nlooked upon as the sign of civilization. The Indians see in the bee the\r\ntype of the white race, and in the buffalo the precursor of the red.\r\n(Washington Irving, \"Tour in the Prairies.\")\r\n\r\nThe bees, as sisters and aunts, remind one of the Germany of\r\nTacitus:--\"The aunt is there held in higher esteem than the mother.\" It\r\nmust have resembled a country of bees.\r\n\r\nM. Pouchet, whom I have already cited several times, has been\r\ngood enough to furnish me with a very interesting anecdote of the\r\nmason-bees:--\r\n\r\n\"In Egypt and Nubia, which I traversed some few months ago, these\r\nhymenoptera and their buildings are so abundant that the ceilings of\r\ncertain temples and those of some hypogea are entirely covered with\r\nthem, and they absolutely mask the sculptures and hieroglyphics. These\r\nnests frequently form there a succession of layers; and in certain\r\nlocalities they are superimposed one upon another in sufficient\r\nnumbers to form a kind of stalactite suspended to the vaulted roofs\r\nof the monuments. In their construction the bee makes use of Nile mud\r\nonly; and when she has deposited therein her progeny, she seals them\r\nup with a delicately wrought cover, which the young bee, after having\r\nundergone its various metamorphoses, lifts off and flies away. But\r\nthese nests are often broken up by a species of lizard, which, by means\r\nof its singularly sharp nails, climbs to the ceilings. There it wages\r\nincessant war against the mason-bees while they are building their\r\nnests, or rather it may be seen crashing through the walls to devour\r\ntheir young progeny.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 17.--Conclusion, p. 337.\r\n\r\n_A Feminine Intuition._--A great question of method which the future\r\nwill clear up, is, to know how far woman will one day master the\r\nsciences of life, and to what extent the study of these sciences will\r\nbe shared between the two sexes. If sympathy for animals, long and\r\npatient tenderness, the persevering observation of the delicatest\r\nobjects, were the only qualities which this study demanded, it\r\nwould seem as if woman ought to make the best naturalist. But the\r\nlife-sciences have another and a far gloomier aspect, which repels and\r\naffrights; and it is so, because they are at the same time the sciences\r\nof death.\r\n\r\nHowever, in this very century, the grand and leading discovery,\r\nall-important for the knowledge of the higher insects, belongs to a\r\nmaiden, the daughter of a scientific naturalist of French Switzerland,\r\nMademoiselle Jurine. She has found that the bee-workers, who were\r\nthought to be _neuters_ (of neither the one nor the other sex), were\r\nreally females, attenuated by their exceedingly narrow cradles and\r\ninferior regimen. Now, as these workers form nearly the whole people\r\n(except five or six bred as queens, and a few hundred males), it\r\nfollows that the hive of twenty or thirty thousand bees is female. Thus\r\nthe predominance of the feminine sex, the general law of insect life,\r\nhas obtained its supreme confirmation. There are _no neuters_; neither\r\namong the bees, nor the ants, nor all the superior tribes of insects.\r\nThe males are a small exception, a secondary accident. I feel able to\r\nassert that, on the whole, _the insect is female_.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Jurine's discovery has also revealed to us the true\r\ncharacter of the maternity of adoption, an admirably original\r\ncharacteristic of these insects, and the elevated law of\r\ndisinterestedness and sacrifice which is the ennoblement of their\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\nAn undoubtedly inferior, but still distinguished merit to that of\r\naccomplishing great discoveries, is that of representing animals to us\r\nby pen or pencil in their true forms, their movements, and the general\r\nharmony of the things with which they are associated. No art seems to\r\nbelong more naturally to woman. A woman has commenced it.\r\n\r\nThe illustrious Audubon has won just admiration for his representation\r\nof the bird in its complete harmonies, its animal and vegetable\r\nmedium, on the plants which feed, near the enemy which assails\r\nit. But it has been too generally forgotten that the model of his\r\nharmonious paintings, which present us with so true a picture of life,\r\nwas furnished by a woman, Sybille de Mérian. Her handsome volume\r\n(_Métamorphose des Insectes de Surinam_, folio, in three languages, ed.\r\n1705), was the first in which this admirable method was invented and\r\nskilfully applied.\r\n\r\nShe is called \"_Mademoiselle_,\" though she was married. The name of\r\n\"_dame_\" was in her time still restricted to women of noble birth. And\r\nshe remains \"Mademoiselle;\" is never cited except under her maiden\r\nname. Her books, from their pure science and great perseverance, give\r\none the idea of a person lifted above the world of persons, and wholly\r\ndevoted to art and nature.\r\n\r\nI have dedicated to her a word or two, but without speaking of her\r\nlife. A native of Bâle, the daughter, sister, and mother of celebrated\r\nengravers, and herself an excellent painter of flowers upon velvet,\r\nshe long resided at Frankfort and Nurenberg. She experienced great\r\nmisfortunes, her husband being ruined and having separated from her.\r\nShe then sought refuge in a mystical society, analogous to that which\r\nhad formerly consoled Swammerdam. The religious spark of the new\r\nscience, _the theology of insects_, as a contemporary terms it, here\r\nproduced a strong impression on her mind. She was acquainted with\r\nSwammerdam's great idea, the unity of metamorphoses, and with that\r\nwhich Malpighi had flung in the face of astonished Europe in his book\r\non the silkworm: \"Insects have a heart.\"\r\n\r\nWhat! they have a heart, like us! Which, like ours, throbs and stirs\r\nat the impulse of their desires, their fears, or their passions!\r\nHow touching an idea! How well adapted to influence a woman!--But is\r\nthis a fact? Many long denied it, but doubt has been impossible since\r\nthe truth was demonstrated in 1824 in M. Strauss's treatise on \"The\r\nCockchafer.\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Mérian, then, started from the silkworm. But her curiosity\r\nand artistic eagerness embraced everything. Contrasted with her dull\r\nand sombre Germany, Holland, with its rich American and Oriental\r\ncollections, appeared to her like the great museum of the tropics.\r\nThere she established herself, and with her pencil made its collections\r\nher own. Those faëry cemeteries, glittering with the beauty of the\r\ndead, did but whet in her the desire to investigate life in the region\r\nwhere it most luxuriates. At the age of fifty-four she set out for\r\nGuiana; and, during a two years' residence in its dangerous climate,\r\ncollected the drawings and paintings which were to inaugurate art in\r\nnatural history.\r\n\r\nIn this branch of labour, the stumbling-block of the artist, who is an\r\nartist and nothing more, is that he may do very well, but make Nature\r\ncoquettish, add the pretty to the beautiful, and flourish those graces\r\nand daintinesses which secure for a scientific treatise the favour of\r\nfashionable ladies. Nothing of this kind is discernible in the work\r\nof Sybille de Mérian, but on every page a noble vigour, a masculine\r\ngravity, a courageous simplicity. At the same time, a close inspection,\r\nespecially of the illustrations coloured by her own hand, discovers\r\nin the softness, breadth, and fulness of the plants, their lustrous\r\nand velvety freshness,--the tones either dead or enamelled, and, as it\r\nwere, flowered, which the insects offer,--the tender, conscientious\r\nhand of a woman who has laboured upon the whole with a reverence\r\ninspired by love.\r\n\r\nWe have seen (p. 180), in our chapter on the _Fire-Flies_, the\r\nastonishment of the timid German in a world so new, when the savages\r\nbrought her its living materials,--venomous herbs, lizards, and snakes,\r\nand fantastic serpents. But the very strangeness of this nature, the\r\nemotions of the painter trembling before her models, the restless\r\nattention with which she sought to seize the changeful physiognomy\r\nand mysterious manners, while keenly agitating her heart, did but\r\nawaken her genius. Never satisfied by her representations of fugitive\r\nrealities, she believed she could make each insect properly known only\r\nby painting it under all its forms (caterpillar, nymph, butterfly). And\r\nthis not contenting her, she placed beneath it the vegetable on which\r\nit fed, and by its side the lizard, serpent, or spider which fed upon\r\n_it_. Thus, the mutuality and exchange of nature was clearly shown; you\r\nsaw clearly that formidable circulation, which, in tropical climates,\r\nis so rapid. Each of those fine plates, so harmonious and so complete,\r\ninstructs not only by its truthful details, but inspires a profound\r\nsympathy with life, which is a very different and much more valuable\r\nteaching.\r\n\r\nOne thing strikes me, which, however, this love explains. She has\r\npainted side by side those creatures which devour one another. They\r\ndraw close together, each faces its antagonist, and you conclude that a\r\nfrightful duel is imminent. But she has generally concealed the tragic\r\nstruggle. She has shrunk from painting death.\r\n\r\nHow much more terrible would have been her task had she advanced\r\nfurther, had she opened and dissected her models, and forced her\r\nfeminine pencil to the lugubrious painting of anatomical detail!\r\n\r\nAnd here we recognize the precise limit at which women are arrested in\r\nthe study of the natural sciences. They are incapable of confronting\r\nit on _both_ sides. Michael Angelo has finely said:--\"Death and life\r\nare but one. They are the work of the same master and the same hand.\"\r\nBut women do not submit. Between them and death no compact is possible.\r\nThis is very easily understood; they themselves _are_ life in all its\r\nprolific charm. They are born to give it. Whatever breaks the charm is\r\na horror to them. Death, and especially pain, are not only antipathic,\r\nbut almost incomprehensible. They feel that only happiness and joy\r\nshould attend upon woman. Pain inflicted by a woman's hand appears to\r\nthem very justly as a horrible contradiction.\r\n\r\nIn the natural sciences there are three things they may master, the\r\nthree things of life: the _incubation_ of the new being,--that is, the\r\ntenderness of its earliest care; the _education_, the _nourishment_\r\n(to speak as our fathers did) of the young adults; finally, the\r\n_observation_ of manners, and the subtle intelligence of means of\r\ninter-communication with all species. By the aid of these three woman's\r\narts, man may conciliate and gradually appropriate the inferior\r\nspecies, and even many of the insect species. To them belong entirely\r\nthe arts of domestication. If childhood were less cruel, or at least\r\nnot harshly insensible, it might share these womanly cares. For Woman,\r\nas a soft and tender child, full of pity, is the mediator of all nature.\r\n\r\nBut as for death, as for pain, as for the lights which science draws\r\nfrom them, do not speak of them to Woman. Here she halts, leaves you on\r\nthe road, and will go no further forward.\r\n\r\nShe asserts--and the assertion may appear of some real weight, even to\r\nthe sedatest minds--that science, of late years, has marched by two\r\ncontrary roads: on the one hand, demonstrating by the study of manners\r\nand of organs that animals are not a world apart, but far more like\r\nourselves than had been generally supposed; and on the other, when it\r\nhas so clearly proved their great resemblance, and consequently their\r\ncapacity of suffering, it ordains that we shall inflict upon them the\r\nmost exquisite and most cruelly protracted agonies.\r\n\r\nScience, on this terrible side, closes itself more and more against\r\nwomen. Nature, while inviting them to penetrate it, checks them at\r\nthe same time by their excessive tenderness of feeling, and by the\r\nreverence for life with which she herself has inspired them.\r\n\r\nOf all creatures, insects seemed the least worthy of being trained (or\r\ndomesticated). They were sought only for their colours. Nevertheless,\r\nwhoever sees in the pursuit nothing but a simple pleasure, will perhaps\r\nreflect for a moment when he learns that impaled insects frequently\r\nendure their torture for whole years! (See Lemahoux, and, particularly,\r\nthe excellent _Bulletin de la Société Protectrice des Animaux_,\r\nSeptember and October 1856.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn proportion as women understand the maternal instincts of the\r\ncreatures I have described, their infinite tenderness, and their\r\ningenious prevision for the objects of their love, it will become\r\nimpossible for mothers to immolate _these_ mothers, and put them to the\r\ntorture!\r\n\r\n\r\nLast Words.\r\n\r\nThe originating sentiment of the studies of which this book is the\r\noutcome, is also that which induced their suspension. Their primary\r\nattraction was found in Huber's revelation, in his vivid manifestation\r\nof the individuality of the insect. But that which at the first\r\nglance had seemed so paradoxical and incredible, was discovered, when\r\nverified, to fall below the reality. The spectacle of so many labours\r\nand efforts for the common good, the sight of all these meritorious\r\nexistences, imposes a duty upon our conscience, and renders it more and\r\nmore difficult to treat as a _thing_ the being which wills, and toils,\r\nand loves!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalysis of Subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nI. THE LIVING INFINITE.\r\n\r\n  The writer is moved by the voices of the Insect World, 17\r\n  Which leads him to reflect on its infinite numbers, 18\r\n  He refers to his loving study of the Bird, 19\r\n  But the Bird had a language; has the Insect?, 19\r\n  In many respects, it is an enigma which Man cannot read, 20\r\n  The Insect, however, has much to plead in self-defence, 21\r\n  And between it and Man the interpreter must be Love, 22\r\n\r\n\r\nII. OUR STUDIES AT PARIS AND IN SWITZERLAND.\r\n\r\n  How the writer was assisted by his wife in his study of the Insect, 23\r\n  Woman is well adapted for such a study; and why?, 24\r\n  Her tact, delicate touch, and fine perception fit her for microscopical\r\n    investigations, 24\r\n  The writer seeks a retirement near Lucerne, 25\r\n  The surrounding scenery is described, 26\r\n  And he bursts into a glowing panegyric on the Alps, 27\r\n  He discourses on the communion between Nature and the human soul, 28\r\n  This leads him to a description of a forest scene, 29\r\n  In which he recognizes the presence of the insect life, 30\r\n  A constant conflict is maintained between the insect and the plant, the\r\n    latter being aided by the bird, 30\r\n  In the forest, then, lurks a hidden world, 31\r\n  The interior of an ant-hill is suddenly revealed, 32\r\n  And the effects become visible of the formic acid, 33\r\n  Reflections suggested by the ruined ant-hill, 34\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. OUR STUDIES AT FONTAINEBLEAU.\r\n\r\n  The writer resolves to attempt an explanation of the Insect World, 36\r\n  For such a task Fontainebleau offers peculiar facilities, 37\r\n  A description is given of the characteristics of the place, 38\r\n  It has had a peculiar charm for many illustrious men, 41\r\n  Its individuality is distinct, 42\r\n  In the course of a day it presents various changes, 43\r\n  Yet throughout all a certain sameness is preserved, 44\r\n  This is expressed by the \"genius loci,\", 45\r\n  The voices of the forest, 46\r\n  Its suitability as a place for reflection, 47\r\n  Its suggestiveness; the very oaks enforce a lesson of perseverance, 48\r\n  Its life centres in its quarrymen and its ants, 49\r\n  The contrast between their several labours, 50\r\n  Nature and the Individual, 51\r\n  The writer enters upon the composition of the present book, 52\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE FIRST.--METAMORPHOSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.--TERROR AND REPUGNANCE IN CHILDHOOD.\r\n\r\n  Extract from a Journal written by Madame Michelet, 57\r\n  In which she describes a visit to the home of her childhood, 58\r\n  Painful impressions produced by the ravages of the insect, 59\r\n  The writer comments on the repugnance with which the insect is viewed by\r\n    childhood, 60\r\n  This repugnance is not shared by Nature, 61\r\n  Which protects and facilitates it in its work, 62\r\n  On account of its vast importance, 63\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.--COMPASSION.\r\n\r\n  The artist Gros reproached a young man for cruelty towards a\r\n    butterfly, 67\r\n  Lyonnet, the naturalist, equally insisted on tenderness towards even\r\n    the lowest forms of life, 68\r\n  The writer records his adventure with a drone, which he thought he had\r\n    killed, in a moment of petulance, 69\r\n  His happiness on seeing the insect revive, 70\r\n  Begins to study the insect seriously on a Swiss tour, 70\r\n  Another extract from Madame Michelet's Journal, 71\r\n  In which is described the author's retreat at Montreux, on the shore of\r\n    the Lake of Geneva, 72\r\n  In one of her walks she observes a combat between a stag-beetle and a\r\n    beetle of inferior size, 73\r\n  The stag-beetle is captured for the purpose of examination, 73\r\n  Effect produced upon it by the vapour of ether, 74\r\n  Regret expressed at having terminated its existence, 75\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.--WORLD-BUILDERS.\r\n\r\n  The world _outside_ the terrestrial world, 79\r\n  The world of the infinitely little; the architects of ocean, 80\r\n  The immense works accomplished by the lower organisms, 81\r\n  They build up reefs, banks, islands, 82\r\n  The manufacture of chalk described, 83\r\n  How a coral-island is gradually developed, 83, 84\r\n  Examples of the labours of the coral animals, 85\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.--LOVE AND DEATH.\r\n\r\n  Above these organisms in the scale of creation comes the insect, 89\r\n  Its individuality is explained; its mode of reproduction, 90\r\n  The insect-mother dies in producing her offspring, 91\r\n  But with extraordinary sagacity has provided for its support and\r\n    protection, 92\r\n  Examples given of this wonderful maternal provision, 93\r\n  The labours of the mother-bee explained, 94\r\n  Reference to the \"Nymphs of Fontainebleau,\"  95\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.--THE ORPHAN: ITS FEEBLENESS.\r\n\r\n  The insect enters upon life naked and necessitous, 99\r\n  But all its wants have been carefully anticipated, 100\r\n  Night, however, is the great protection of the embryo, 101\r\n  How it endeavours to guard against cold, 102\r\n  In its necessities originate its various industries, 103\r\n  After a time comes its season of trial, 104\r\n  Of which it exhibits a marvellous presentiment, and for which it\r\n    assiduously prepares, 105\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.--THE MUMMY, NYMPH, OR CHRYSALIS.\r\n\r\n  The meaning of the insect to the ancient Egyptians, 109\r\n  The beetle was regarded as a symbol of Eternity, 110\r\n  Has modern science swept aside the ancient poetry? 110\r\n  That it is not so, is shown by Réaumur's discoveries, 111\r\n  Which show us the marvellous changes the insect undergoes, 112\r\n\r\n  And how in each stage of growth the next is prefigured, 113\r\n  However numerous or great the changes, the individuality is\r\n    preserved, 114\r\n  A future life is provided for, as in the case of the human embryo, 115\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.--THE PHOENIX.\r\n\r\n  Out of gloom and obscurity emerges light, 119\r\n  The metamorphosis takes place, but the insect is not at a loss, 120\r\n  Nature furnishes each species with all its needs for the new life, 121\r\n  Its vital intensity is revealed by the brightness of its colouring, 122\r\n  Insects of gay attire are found in every region, 123\r\n  Even among the snows of the Alpine peaks, 124\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE SECOND.--MISSION AND ARTS OF THE INSECT.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.--SWAMMERDAM.\r\n\r\n  The secret of the Insect World first discovered by Swammerdam, 129\r\n  A comparison instituted between him and Galileo, 130\r\n  His early years, his favourite occupations, and his collections of\r\n    insects, 131, 132\r\n  To assist him in his investigations he invented the microscope, 133\r\n  His patient labours rewarded by great discoveries, 134\r\n  Yet in his own country he was not honoured; it was in France that his\r\n    work met with due appreciation, 135\r\n  Ardent devotion to science brings on premature decay, 136\r\n  Dark clouds overcast his later years, 137\r\n  He died at the age of three and forty, 138\r\n  His work is carried on by Leuwenhoek and Malpighi, 139\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.--THE MICROSCOPE: HAS THE INSECT A PHYSIOGNOMY?\r\n\r\n  In the infinitely little lurks a great attraction for man, 143\r\n  Hence its study should be systematically undertaken, 144\r\n  Michelet applies himself to his microscope, 145\r\n  And examines the structure of an insect's wing, 146\r\n  Next, he studies the organization of the ant, 147\r\n  He describes what he saw, 148\r\n  A complex apparatus, both for action and defence, 150\r\n  What it is which separates us from the insect, 151\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.--THE INSECT AS THE AGENT OF NATURE IN THE ACCELERATION\r\nOF DEATH AND LIFE.\r\n\r\n  The language of the insect in its immense energy, 155\r\n  A glance is directed at the order of Nature, 156\r\n  And it is shown that all forms of life must be kept within certain\r\n    limits, 156\r\n  Hence, one race preys upon another, and all Nature is a scene of\r\n    incessant combat, 157\r\n  In this work of destruction, and purification, the Bird and the Insect\r\n    play an important part, 158\r\n  The Coleoptera bring their surprising energies to the task, 159\r\n  The insect-tribes are therefore great sanitary agents, 160\r\n  The great Guiana ants afford an illustration, 161\r\n  And the beneficent labours of the spider have secured the respect of the\r\n    Siberians, 162\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.--THE INSECT AS MAN'S AUXILIARY.\r\n\r\n  The want of insect-labour induced the potato disease, 165\r\n  Such is the dictum of an author, who thinks that the multiplication of\r\n    small birds has been destructive to insect-life; but no such\r\n    multiplication of birds has taken place, nor any such destruction of\r\n    insects, 165, 166\r\n  The Bird and the Insect are the joint purifiers of creation, 167\r\n  Some species of insects should be carefully preserved, 167\r\n  A sketch is given of their multifarious labours, 168\r\n  Of the services rendered by the scavenger-insects, 169\r\n\r\n  Of the value of certain insects as food, 170\r\n  As, for instance, in the case of the locust, 171\r\n  The law of retaliation illustrated, 172\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.--A PHANTASMAGORIA OF LIGHT AND COLOUR.\r\n\r\n  How does the insect express its intensity of vital force? 175\r\n  In various ways, but specially through its glowing hues, 176\r\n  Which are displayed with a profusion that astonishes and almost overcomes\r\n    the observer, 177\r\n  But are not inconsistent with an ingenious mimicry, 177\r\n  A diversion is made to the tropical forest, 178\r\n  Where the insect life is seen in its most splendid developments, 179\r\n  Like winged flames they haunt the leafy shades, 180\r\n  The fire-fly lights up the gloom, and also furnishes woman's beauty with\r\n    a living ornament, 181, 182\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.--THE SILKWORM.\r\n\r\n  The exquisite structure of a woman's hair enlarged upon, 185\r\n  What can compare with it? Only the silkworm's thread, 186\r\n  Peculiar charm attending the silkworm's labours, 186\r\n  And the preciousness of the silken product, 187\r\n  Something is said about the use of silk in Mediæval France, 188\r\n  And on its excellence and fitness as a garment for Beauty, 189\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.--INSTRUMENTS OF THE INSECT: AND ITS CHEMICAL ENERGIES,\r\nAS IN THE COCHINEAL AND THE CANTHARIDES.\r\n\r\n  Hitherto the writer has treated only of the silk of the bombyx, 193\r\n  He now commends the culture of other silk-spinning species, 194\r\n  And is led to speak of the ingenious instruments with which insects are\r\n    provided, 194\r\n  And of their general powers and properties, 195\r\n  Something is said about their weapons, 196\r\n  And the malalis is spoken of, 197\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.--ON THE RENOVATION OF OUR ARTS BY THE STUDY OF THE INSECT.\r\n\r\n  The Fine Arts would profit by a close study of the insect, 201\r\n  Much might be learned, for instance, from the cockchafer's wing, 202\r\n  Nature is full of suggestive beauty, 203\r\n  Observe the enamels of the cicindela, 204\r\n  And those of the scarabæi, 205\r\n  Instead of copying from antique absurdities, go then to the\r\n    insect-collector's cabinet, 206\r\n  And its treasures will inspire the artist with new ideas, 207\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.--THE SPIDER--INDUSTRY--STANDING STILL.\r\n\r\n  We come to the consideration of the spider, 211\r\n  Whose life is a lottery, and which is branded with ugliness, 212\r\n  It is, however, the type of the persevering worker, 213\r\n  An anecdote in illustration of its character, 214\r\n  Its web, and the mode of its construction, described, 215\r\n  Prudence and patience the characteristics of the spider, 216\r\n  All animals live by prey, and the spider has its foes, 217\r\n  Its existence is confined within a narrow circle, 218\r\n  And is easily terminated, 219\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.--THE HOME AND LOVES OF THE SPIDER.\r\n\r\n  Admirable construction of its web, 223\r\n  A glance at the retreat of the Agelena, 224\r\n  Still greater ingenuity is shown by the Mygale, 225\r\n  In the web lurks the weaver, always expectant, 225\r\n  A sensitive being, and subject to fancies of terror, 227\r\n  In his moments of love he is timorous and suspicious, 228\r\n  How he is affected by musical sounds, 229\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE THIRD.--COMMUNITIES OF INSECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.--THE TERMITES, OR WHITE ANTS.\r\n\r\n  The habitations of the termites, erroneously called White Ants,\r\n    described, both externally and internally, 235, 236\r\n  A wonderful degree of skill shown in the erection of the great dome, 237\r\n  Yet the builders labour under specially difficult circumstances, 238\r\n  Their queen's fecundity; her offspring are tenderly treated, 239\r\n  Their numbers would be a terror to man, were they not checked by many\r\n    enemies, 240\r\n  An illustration is given of their terrible ravages, 241\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.--THE ANTS:--THEIR DOMESTIC ECONOMY--THEIR NUPTIALS.\r\n\r\n  Value of the ants as purifying and cleansing agents, 245\r\n  An incident at Barbadoes, 246\r\n  The carpenter-ants, and their ingenuity, described, 247\r\n  Singular affection which they display for the young, 251\r\n  They watch over them with incessant vigilance; their mode of\r\n    inter-communication, 251\r\n  A picture is given of the economy of an ant-hill, 252\r\n  In their labours the ants solve numerous problems by sheer intuition, 253\r\n  Their nuptials described as an idyllic poem, 254\r\n  What remained in the morning, 255\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.--THE ANTS: THEIR FLOCKS AND THEIR SLAVES.\r\n\r\n  The writer's pain at discovering among the ants the existence of\r\n    slavery, 259\r\n  Considerations which induced him to continue his studies, 260\r\n  He finds that the ants keep their \"herds of cattle,\" 261\r\n  And discovers a reason for their apparent encouragement of slavery, 262\r\n  Mixed communities of ants; workers and warriors, 263\r\n  The workers are in reality the masters, though they seem to be\r\n    slaves, 264\r\n  A campaign described; red against black, 265\r\n  Ant-societies regulated on the principle of division of labour, 266\r\n  Their species undergo modifications in special circumstances, 267\r\n  The influence of intellect over brute force exemplified, 268\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.--THE ANTS: CIVIL WAR--EXTERMINATION OF THE COMMUNITY.\r\n\r\n  It is the punishment of the tyrant that he cannot readily set free his\r\n    captive, 271\r\n  The caged nightingale, and the clod of earth, 272\r\n  This clod proves to contain a republic of carpenter-ants, 272\r\n  An effort is made to found a new community; difficulties in the way, 273\r\n  An encounter between the carpenter-ants and some mason-ants, 274\r\n  In which the victory is on the side of the Little, 275\r\n  Who carry off the young of the conquered, 276\r\n  A digression comments on the helplessness of the nymph, or larva, 277\r\n  And points out its exceeding suffering in the hands of a victorious\r\n    enemy, 278\r\n  The writer is shocked by the relentless cruelty of the conquerors, 279\r\n  Who have left but one poor fugitive to mourn the death of his\r\n    companions, 280\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.--THE WASPS: THEIR FURY OF IMPROVISATION.\r\n\r\n  Sensation caused by the intrusion of a wasp, 283\r\n  A panegyric on a much-abused insect, 284\r\n  Excessive industry of the wasp, 285\r\n  It works, first, as a paper manufacturer; and next, as a mason, 285\r\n  It builds its city with curious forethought and ingenuity, 286\r\n  The mother-wasp, a remarkable example of self-sacrifice, 287\r\n  Wasps distinguished by their patriotic enthusiasm, 288\r\n  At the approach of winter they dissolve the commonwealth, 289\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.--\"THE BEES\" OF VIRGIL.\r\n\r\n  The Virgilian fable of Aristæus misunderstood, 293\r\n  Intended by the poet as a parable of immortality, 294\r\n  The writer was accidentally led to an understanding of its true\r\n    significance, 295\r\n  A visit to the cemetery of Père-Lachaise, 295\r\n  Here certain lonely graves were haunted by a flight of bees, 296\r\n  Yet they were not true bees; they were two-winged, 297\r\n  They were \"the Bees\" of which Virgil had sung, 298\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.--THE BEE IN THE FIELDS.\r\n\r\n  Contrast between the Plant and the Animal, 301\r\n  Yet the one life in some points approaches the other, and a certain\r\n    sympathy exists between the flower and the winged insect, 302\r\n  What the flower owes to the bee, 303\r\n  And how far the bee is indebted to the flower, 303\r\n  A panegyric upon the bee, which gives new life to vegetation, 304\r\n  The bee's visit to the flower, and what takes place, 305\r\n  It gives and it receives; evening and morning, 306\r\n  How the bee suffers from cold, keen airs, 307\r\n  \"Farewell, madam, and many thanks!\" 308\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.--THE BEES AS ARCHITECTS: THE CITY.\r\n\r\n  Artistic character of the bee-hive, 311\r\n  Its government democratic, or a modified constitutional monarchy, 312\r\n  The writer traces the foundation and erection of the hive, 313\r\n  Its division into cells, and their differences of construction, 314\r\n  The thoughtful skill of the builders illustrated, 315\r\n  As in their improvised defence against the ravages of the Sphinx\r\n    Atropos, 316\r\n  Which may be accepted as a proof of the intelligence of insects as\r\n    distinguished from instinct, 317\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.--HOW THE BEES CREATE THE PEOPLE AND THE COMMON MOTHER.\r\n\r\n  Care of the bee for the nymph, or larva, 321\r\n  As it grows, so does its wonderful organization develop, 322\r\n  Special care bestowed on the future queen, 323\r\n  The queen bee has attributes of its own, 324\r\n  Her rage, when she becomes aware of the existence of possible rivals, 325\r\n  The community divided between the old love and the new, 325\r\n  An emigration takes place, 325\r\n  And a new commonwealth is established, 326\r\n  Sometimes the old queen and the new encounter one another, 327\r\n  In which case a deadly combat ensues, 328\r\n  And the victor becomes the idol of the people, 328\r\n  If both perish, the community, in a state of great excitement, proceed\r\n    to feed and bring up another, 329\r\n  Whom they will guard with loving loyalty, 329\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n  A comparison, and a contrast, between the bee and the ant, 333\r\n  All insects teach certain noteworthy lessons, 334\r\n  And, primarily, a reverence for life, 335\r\n  Various anecdotes from the writer's own experience are here brought\r\n    forward, in defence of the thesis that life is more precious than\r\n    science, 336\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustrative Notes, 341\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *",
