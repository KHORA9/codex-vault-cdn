These\r\ninquiries have come from people interested in our company, from\r\nothers interested in companies that have purchased the right to use\r\nour apparatus, from people desirous of becoming interested in a\r\npneumatic-tube business, from would-be purchasers of pneumatic tubes,\r\nand from people interested in pneumatic tubes from a scientific,\r\nengineering, or mechanical point of view. This book is not intended to\r\nbe a treatise on pneumatic tubes. In the first chapter I have given\r\na brief sketch of what has been done in the application of pneumatic\r\ntubes from the earliest records to the present time. The second chapter\r\ncontains a description of the postal tubes in Philadelphia, and the\r\nthird chapter describes our system in detail. Following this is a short\r\nchapter explaining the theory of pneumatic tubes, or the theory of\r\nthe flow of air in long pipes, stating the more interesting facts and\r\nrelations in as plain and simple a manner as possible. Mathematical\r\nformulæ have been purposely avoided.\r\n\r\nSeveral plates showing the Philadelphia postal line have been kindly\r\nloaned to me by the Engineers’ Club of Philadelphia. They formerly\r\nappeared in a paper read by Mr. A. Falkenau before that club. I\r\nhave also to thank the and Drill Co., the B. F. Sturtevant Co.,\r\nthe Wilbraham-Baker Blower Co., and J. B. Stewart for the use of\r\nelectrotypes of their machines.\r\n\r\nB. C. B.\r\n\r\nOctober 6, 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nBATCHELLER PNEUMATIC TUBE SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nA BRIEF HISTORICAL SKETCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Early Records.=—The earliest reference to pneumatic transmission of\r\nwhich we find any record is a paper presented to the Royal Society of\r\nLondon, by Denis Papin, in the year 1667, entitled “Double Pneumatic\r\nPump.” His plan was to exhaust the air from a long metal tube by two\r\nlarge cylinders. The tube was to contain a piston, to which a carriage\r\nwas attached by means of a cord. The “American Cyclopædia” goes on to\r\nsay, “More than a century elapsed before any further effort in this\r\ndirection was made. Paucbrouke’s ‘Dictionnaire Encyclopédique des\r\nAmusements des Sciences’ (1792) gives a description of a machine by\r\nM. Van Estin, by means of which a hollow ball holding a small package\r\nwas propelled by a blast of air through a tube several hundred feet in\r\nlength, and having many curves. This plan seems, however, to have been\r\nmore an amusement than an attempt to introduce an industrial scheme.\r\nWith more regard to practical results, Medhurst, an engineer of London,\r\npublished a pamphlet on the subject in 1810. He proposed to move small\r\ncarriages on rails in air-tight tubes or tunnels, by compressed air\r\nbehind, or by creating a partial vacuum in front. In 1812 he published\r\nanother pamphlet; but the plan was not put into successful operation,\r\nprincipally from insufficient means of exhaustion. About 1832 he\r\nproposed to connect the carriage inside such a tube with a passenger\r\ncarriage running on the top of the tube; and, although the latter\r\nproject has never been commercially successful, it was the first to\r\nbe practically attempted. More than a score of patents were taken out\r\non the Continent and in England and America, none of which met with\r\nany practical success. Returning to the original idea of Denis Papin,\r\ninventors attempted to accomplish pneumatic transmission by moving the\r\nload inside the tube, and in course of time achieved success. In France\r\nMM. Jarroux and Taisseau presented a project for atmospheric telegraphy\r\nbefore the Academy of Sciences, and they were succeeded in the same\r\ndirection by MM. Brochet and Ardor.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=Practical Beginning of the Art. The London Pneumatic\r\nTelegraph.=—London has the honor of being the first city to have\r\na practical system of pneumatic telegraphy. The first tubes were\r\ninstalled by the Electric and International Telegraph Company, the work\r\nbeing planned and carried out by their engineer, Mr. Josiah Latimer\r\nClark, in 1853 and 1854. The first tube to be laid was one and one-half\r\ninches in diameter, and extended from the central station, Founder’s\r\nCourt, Lothbury, to the Stock Exchange, Throgmorton Street, a distance\r\nof two hundred and twenty yards. The tube was operated intermittently\r\nby connecting it to a vacuum chamber at the central station. Carriers\r\nwere sent only in one direction. A steam-pump was used to maintain the\r\nvacuum. Much experience was gained from the use of this first tube. In\r\n1858 some improvements were made by Mr. C. F. Varley, and I can best\r\ndescribe them by quoting from the discussion of Mr. Carl Siemens’s\r\npaper on “Pneumatic Despatch Tubes: The Circuit System” before the\r\nInstitution of Civil Engineers, as recorded in the minutes of that\r\nsociety. “Later, about the year 1858, when a pipe two and one-fourth\r\ninches internal diameter was extended from Telegraph Street to Mincing\r\nLane, thirteen hundred and forty yards in length, the traffic was so\r\nconsiderable that it was found desirable to have the power of sending\r\nmessages in both directions. To effect that a smaller pipe, one and\r\none-half inches in internal diameter, was laid between Telegraph\r\nStreet and Mincing Lane, with a view to carrying the vacuum to the\r\nlatter station, so as to take messages in the opposite direction. This\r\nsmaller pipe was found to so wiredraw the current that the pipe would\r\nnot work, the leakage past the carrier being too considerable; and\r\naccordingly a large chamber was built in the basement floor or kitchen\r\nat the corner of Mincing Lane and Leadenhall Street to collect power\r\nor vacuum for bringing the messages from Telegraph Street to Mincing\r\nLane. This chamber was constructed of timber, fourteen feet by twelve\r\nfeet broad and ten feet high, and was covered with lead. It was not\r\nstrong enough to withstand the pressure; for one day, a carrier having\r\nstuck half-way, and when there was a higher vacuum than usual,—viz.,\r\ntwenty-three inches of mercury,—it collapsed with a loud report. At\r\nthe time the landlord of the house happened to be dining in the next\r\nroom, and he suddenly found himself, his table, dinner, and the door,\r\nwhich was wrenched off its hinges, precipitated into the room amongst\r\nthe _débris_ of the chamber. The windows were forced inwards, and those\r\non the opposite side of Mincing Lane and Leadenhall Street were drawn\r\noutwards. The damage was considerable. This accident put an end, for a\r\ntime, to the attempt to send telegraph messages by means of a vacuum\r\nconveyed through this smaller pipe. About that time he (Mr. Varley)\r\nbecame the engineer-in-chief of the Electric Telegraph Company, and\r\ngot permission from the directors to introduce a new system,—viz.,\r\ncompressed air,—though many persons contended that it would be\r\nimpossible to blow messages through a pipe, because all attempts to\r\nblow air through long pipes had utterly failed; while others said\r\nthat, if messages were sent, they would go much slower than with the\r\nvacuum.... In his (Mr. Varley’s) apparatus, for he was the first to\r\nintroduce compressed air, the reverse was found to be the case, and for\r\nthis reason: the tube did not consume power until a message was about\r\nto be forwarded; and in a tube thirteen hundred yards in length, and\r\ntwo and one-fourth inches in diameter, fifteen seconds elapsed before\r\nthe vacuum was felt at the distant end after communication had been\r\nestablished with the exhausted chamber at the engine end of the tube,\r\nconsequently the carrier did not start until after fifteen seconds\r\nhad elapsed. When a message was sent by compressed air, it was sent\r\nfrom the end at which the power was applied, and the carrier started\r\nat once, thus gaining a start of fifteen seconds; now, inasmuch as\r\nthe air in the tube had to be compressed, it started at a very high\r\nvelocity, and when it reached the other end the compressed air in\r\nexpanding gave it a higher velocity. The result was, in thirteen\r\nhundred and forty yards, from Telegraph Street to Mincing Lane,\r\nthe carriers were drawn by vacuum, on an average, in from sixty to\r\nseventy seconds, and were propelled by compressed air in about fifty\r\nor fifty-five seconds, the difference of pressure in each case being\r\nnearly equal.”\r\n\r\nThe first one and one-half inch tubes laid under the direction of Mr.\r\nClark were of iron with screwed joints. They gave much trouble from\r\nroughness upon the interior, which wore the carriers very rapidly, and\r\nfrom water that was drawn in through leaky joints. When the extensions\r\nwere made in 1858 and afterwards, two and one-fourth inch lead tubes\r\nwere used with plumber’s joints made over a heated mandrel, which made\r\nthe joints very smooth upon the interior. The carriers were of gutta\r\npercha in the form of a cylinder closed at one end and fitted with a\r\ncap at the other. The outside was covered with felt or drugget.\r\n\r\nWhen a carrier was to be despatched, a signal was sent to an attendant\r\nat the pump end of the tube, who closed that end and connected the tube\r\nto an exhausted chamber by opening a valve. As soon as the carrier\r\narrived, he closed the valve and opened the tube, which allowed the\r\ncarrier to drop out. Mr. Varley improved the method of operating the\r\nvalves by making the air pressure do the work by means of cylinders\r\nand pistons when the attendant pressed a button. He also improved the\r\ncarriers by doing away with the cap and using in its place an elastic\r\nband to hold the messages in place.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that Mr. Clark designed the first tube used in connection\r\nwith the telegraph, and that it was a single tube, operated in one\r\ndirection only by vacuum, being operated only when there were messages\r\nto send. This was extended and improved by Mr. Varley, who increased\r\nthe diameter of the tubes from one and one-half inches to two and\r\none-quarter inches, and operated them in both directions, using vacuum\r\nfor sending in one direction and compressed air for sending in the\r\nother. The air current was maintained in the tubes only when messages\r\nwere sent.\r\n\r\nGreat credit is due to Sir Rowland Hill, who, in 1855, had a proposed\r\nmethod of conveying mails in the city of London, through nine- and\r\nthirteen-inch tubes, thoroughly investigated. It was decided at this\r\ntime that the saving in time over that consumed by mail carts would not\r\nwarrant the expense of installing such a system.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Siemens Circuit System.=—The next progressive step was made\r\nby Siemens Brothers, of Berlin, who proposed a new system called\r\nthe “circuit system,” in which two tubes were used, the up tube\r\nbeing connected to the down tube at the distant end. The air was\r\ncompressed into one end of the circuit and exhausted from the other,\r\nand, furthermore, it was kept in constant circulation. Carriers were\r\ndespatched by inserting them into the air-current without stopping it,\r\nin one direction in one tube or in the opposite direction in the other.\r\nAnother feature of the Siemens system was the placing of three or more\r\nstations on one double line of tubes. Carriers could be stopped at an\r\nintermediate station by inserting in the tube an obstructing screen\r\nwhich the air would pass but which would stop a carrier. This system\r\nis described in detail in a paper read by Mr. Carl Siemens before the\r\nInstitution of Civil Engineers, London, November 14, 1871, Vol. XXXIII.\r\nof the Proceedings. The Siemens apparatus for sending and receiving\r\ncarriers consisted of two short sections of tube attached to a rocking\r\nframe so that either could be swung by hand into line with the main\r\ntube. One of the tube sections was open at both ends, and was used for\r\ndespatching carriers. A carrier was placed in it, then it was swung\r\ninto line with the main tube, when the air-current passing through\r\nswept the carrier along. The other tube section contained a perforated\r\nscreen in one end and was used to receive carriers. When it was in line\r\nwith the main tube and a carrier arrived, the carrier was stopped by\r\nstriking the screen, then the tube section was swung to one side and\r\nthe carrier pushed out with a rod. A by-pass was provided for the air\r\naround the apparatus so that its flow was not checked when the tube\r\nsection was swung. When a carrier was despatched to an intermediate\r\nstation, a signal was sent, and then the section of tube containing\r\nthe screen was interposed in the line of the tube to stop the carrier\r\nupon its arrival. The carriers used by Mr. Siemens were made of\r\ngutta-percha, papier maché, or tin, closed at one end and fitted\r\nwith a cover at the other. They were covered with felt, drugget, or\r\nleather. The front ends of the carriers were provided with thick disks\r\nof drugget or leather fitting the tube loosely, and the opposite ends\r\nwere surrounded with pieces of the same material attached to them like\r\nthe leather of an ordinary lifting pump.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 Messrs. Siemens Bros. received an order from the British\r\ngovernment to install an experimental line of tubes between the central\r\ntelegraph station and the general post-office. This was completed in\r\n1870, and after a half-year’s test it was extended to Fleet Street,\r\nand finally to Charing Cross. The tubes were of iron, three inches\r\nin diameter, with flanged and bolted joints. It was found, after\r\nsome experience, that there was no advantage in the circuit, so the\r\nup and down tubes were separated at Charing Cross Station and worked\r\nindependently.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Recent Improvements in the London System.=—In 1870 Mr. J. W. Wilmot\r\ndesigned a double sluice-valve by means of which carriers could be\r\ndespatched continuously without stopping the flow of air in the tubes.\r\nMr. Wilmot further increased the working capacity of pneumatic tubes\r\nwhen, in 1880, he invented an intermediate automatic signaller, by\r\nmeans of which a carrier signals the passage of a given point on its\r\njourney, showing that the section of the tube traversed is clear, thus\r\nallowing a second carrier to be despatched before the first has reached\r\nits destination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.\r\n\r\nDIAGRAM ILLUSTRATING THE PNEUMATIC TUBE SYSTEM LONDON RADIAL SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nLONDON RADIAL SYSTEM.]\r\n\r\nFrom this beginning the English system developed into what has been\r\ntermed a “radial system;” that is to say, one principal and several\r\nminor central pumping stations have been established, and from these\r\nradiate tubes to numerous sub-stations (see Fig. 2). Some of the\r\nstations are connected with double lines for sending in opposite\r\ndirections. The out-going tube from the pumping station is worked by\r\ncompressed air, and the incoming tube by exhaustion. Other stations\r\nare connected by single tubes, and they are operated alternately by\r\ncompression and exhaustion. Intermediate stations are located on some\r\nof the lines. For the central station the Varley valves were found\r\ntoo expensive and troublesome to keep in order, so they were replaced\r\nby the Wilmot double sluice-valves, which are operated manually. In\r\nrecent years the sluice-valves have been in turn replaced by what are\r\ntermed D-boxes, a simpler form of apparatus. At the sub-stations the\r\ntube terminates in a box into which the carriers drop. As the system\r\nhas been gradually extended, tubes two and three-sixteenths inches\r\ninside diameter have been used for short lines, and three-inch tubes\r\nfor long lines. The tubes are of lead laid inside a cast-iron pipe\r\nwhich serves as a shield, protecting them from injury. They are laid\r\nin twenty-nine foot sections, the joints being made by soldering over\r\na steel mandrel, which is afterwards drawn out by a chain. The joints\r\nin the cast-iron protecting pipe are made by caulking with yarn and\r\nlead. “Electric signals are used between the central and sub-stations,\r\nconsisting of a single stroke bell and indicator, giving notice of\r\nthe arrival and departure of carriers, and to answer the necessary\r\nquestions required in working. Where there are intermediate stations\r\nthe tubes are worked on the block system, as if it were a railway.\r\nExperience shows that, where great exactness of manipulation cannot\r\nbe obtained, it is necessary to allow only one train in each section\r\nof a tube, whether worked by vacuum or pressure. But where there is\r\nno intermediate station, and where the tube can be carefully worked,\r\ncarriers may be allowed to follow one another at short intervals in\r\na tube worked by vacuum, although it is not perfectly safe to do so\r\nin one worked by pressure. In working by pressure it has been found\r\nthat, notwithstanding a fair interval may be allowed, carriers are\r\napt to overtake one another, for no two carriers travel in the same\r\ntimes, because of differences in fit, unless they are placed end to\r\nend. If signalling be neglected and a carrier happens to stick fast,\r\nbeing followed by several others, a block will ensue which it will be\r\ndifficult to clear, while the single carrier could readily have been\r\ndislodged.” (_Proceedings Institute of Civil Engineers, London_, Vol.\r\nXLIII. p. 61.)\r\n\r\nNo changes have been made in the carriers from those used in the early\r\nexperiments which have already been described.\r\n\r\nThe London system has grown until it now includes no less than\r\nforty-two stations and thirty-four miles of tubes. Similar systems\r\nhave been established in connection with the telegraph in Liverpool,\r\nManchester, Birmingham, Glasgow, Dublin, and New Castle. The tubes\r\ngive a cheaper and more rapid means of despatching telegrams between\r\nsub-stations and central stations than transmission by telegraph, and\r\nlocal telegrams can be delivered in the sender’s handwriting.\r\n\r\n\r\n=An Underground Pneumatic Railway for Transportation of Mail.=—Before\r\ndescribing the systems used in the cities on the Continent of Europe,\r\nwe must notice a very large pneumatic tube, or more properly called a\r\npneumatic tunnel railway, constructed in London for the transportation\r\nof mail from one of the railway stations. The first railway of this\r\ntype was constructed in 1863 by the Pneumatic Despatch Company of\r\nLondon, and extended from Euston to the district post-office in\r\nEversholt Street, a distance of about eighteen hundred feet. The\r\ntunnel was flat on the bottom, having a D-shaped cross-section two\r\nfeet eight inches by two feet eight inches. The carriers or carriages\r\nwere cradle-like boxes fitting the tunnel, and they moved at a speed\r\nof seventeen miles per hour, carrying fifteen mails daily. In 1872\r\ntwo similar but larger tunnels were built from Euston Station to the\r\ngeneral post-office, a distance of fourteen thousand two hundred and\r\nfour feet, or two and three-quarters miles. One was for the up traffic,\r\nand the other for the down. The tunnels were four and a half feet\r\nwide by four feet high, the straight part being built of cast iron\r\nand the bends of brick. The line was operated by a fan twenty-two\r\nfeet in diameter, which forced the air into one tunnel and exhausted\r\nit from the other, producing a vacuum of ten inches of water, or six\r\nounces per square inch. The carriages occupied twelve minutes in\r\ntraversing the tunnels, and there was one gradient of one to fourteen.\r\nThe carriages were ten feet four inches long and weighed twenty-two\r\nhundredweight. “The system was able to transport over the whole line,\r\nallowing for delays, an average of a ton per minute.” The system was\r\nused to transport the mails in bulk, but it was found to be slow and\r\nunsatisfactory, and was very soon abandoned.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Berlin Pneumatic Telegraph.=—In 1863 the Prussian government\r\napplied to the firm of Siemens and Halske, of Berlin, for a proposition\r\nto establish a system of pneumatic tubes in that city for the\r\ntransmission of telegraph messages. A proposition was accordingly\r\nsubmitted, and the work was completed in 1865. This first line\r\nconsisted of two parallel wrought-iron tubes, two and one-half inches\r\nin diameter, one tube being used exclusively to send in one direction,\r\nand the other in the opposite direction. They extended from the\r\ntelegraph station to the Exchange, requiring a total length of five\r\nthousand six hundred and seventy feet of tube. The two tubes were\r\nlooped together at the Exchange, and a continuous current of air was\r\nmade to circulate in them by a double-acting steam air-pump, located\r\nat the telegraph station. Air was compressed into one end of the tube\r\nand exhausted from the other. With nine inches of mercury pressure and\r\nvacuum the passage was made in ninety-five seconds to the Exchange,\r\nand seventy-five seconds from the Exchange. It was similar to the\r\nline established in London by the same firm some years later, which we\r\nhave already described, except that there was no intermediate station.\r\nAfter the line had been in use for a year and a half, the Prussian\r\ngovernment had it extended, first, from the telegraph station to the\r\nPotsdam gate, with an intermediate station at the Brandenburg gate.\r\nAfter these preliminary experiments, further extensions were made until\r\na net-work of tubes extended over the city of Berlin, including no\r\nless than thirty-eight stations and over twenty-eight miles of tubes;\r\nbut in laying down this net-work a departure was made from the Siemens\r\nsystem. Air was no longer kept constantly circulating, but power was\r\nstored up in large tanks, some being exhausted and others filled with\r\ncompressed air, which was used when required to send messages, usually\r\nat intervals of five or fifteen minutes. The exhausted tanks were\r\npermanently connected with the closed tubes, which were opened when\r\nrequired for use. The tanks containing compressed air were connected\r\nto the tubes when messages were sent. The internal diameter of the\r\ntubes was 2.559 inches. They were laid in circuits, including several\r\nstations in a circuit, and the carriers travelled only in one direction\r\naround the circuit. Some outlying stations were connected by a single\r\ntube with central pumping-stations, these single tubes being worked in\r\nboth directions. Years of experience have shown the disadvantages of\r\nthis circuit-system, and it has gradually been changed to the radial\r\nsystem, such as is used in London, until now nearly all the stations\r\nare grouped around the central pumping-stations, to which they are\r\nconnected directly by radiating tubes. The Siemens apparatus has been\r\nreplaced by simpler and less expensive valves and receiving-boxes, the\r\nlatest form of which was designed and patented by Mr. Josef Wildemann.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.\r\n\r\nDIAGRAM OF PART OF PARIS PNEUMATIC TUBE SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nPARIS CIRCUIT SYSTEM.]\r\n\r\n=The Paris Pneumatic Telegraph.=—We will now glance at the system used\r\nin Paris, which has some novel features. In 1865 it was decided to\r\nestablish a system, and the first experimental line, from Place de la\r\nBourse to the Grand Hôtel, on the Boulevard des Capuciens, was laid in\r\n1866. Instead of using a steam-engine to drive an air-compressor or\r\nexhaust-pump, air was compressed in tanks by displacement with water\r\nfrom the city mains. In 1867 this line was extended to Rue de Grennelle\r\nSt. Germain, with an intermediate station at the Rue Boissy d’Anglais,\r\nand another line with stations at Rue Jean Jacques Rousseau, Hôtel du\r\nLouvre in the Rue de Rivoli, the Rue des Saints Pères, and terminating\r\nin the central station. In 1868 the system was changed to a polygonal\r\nor circuit system by removing the station in the Rue de Rivoli to the\r\nPlace du Théâtre Français and connecting the latter directly with the\r\nBourse. Other changes and extensions were made in 1870 and 1871, until\r\nthree polygons or circuits were formed, with five or six stations\r\nin each circuit, and several outlying stations were connected by\r\nindependent tubes. In the middle of the year 1875 seventeen stations\r\nhad been connected and plans were made for twenty-one more. Instead of\r\nmaintaining an air-current around each circuit by machinery located at\r\none of the stations on the circuit, at least three of the five or six\r\nstations comprised in the circuit have means of supplying compressed\r\nair or of exhausting it, and each side of the polygon, or section of\r\nthe circuit between two stations, is operated independently of the\r\nrest of the circuit (see Fig. 3). Carriers are sent on from station\r\nto station around the circuit, either by compressed air from the last\r\nstation from which they were sent or by means of exhaustion at the\r\nnext station towards which they are moving. The carriers are made up\r\nin trains of from six to ten, with a piston behind them that fits the\r\ntube closely and forces them ahead. Each carrier is addressed by means\r\nof a label for its destined station. Trains are despatched around the\r\ncircuits at stated times, usually at fifteen-minute intervals. As they\r\narrive at the various stations, carriers are taken out and others put\r\nin, and the trains sent on their way. The carriers consist of iron\r\ncylinders, closed at one end, with a leather case that slides over\r\nthem and closes the open end. They weigh, when filled with thirty-five\r\nmessages, twelve and one-half ounces, and they will travel about\r\ntwelve hundred miles before the leather cover is so worn that it must\r\nbe thrown away. The pistons are made of a wooden cone, covered with\r\niron, and having a “cup-leather” upon the rear end that fits the tube\r\nclosely. The sending and receiving apparatus consists of sections\r\nof tube closed at one end, having a door on the side, through which\r\ncarriers are inserted or despatched. A peculiar form of fork is used\r\nfor picking them out. The air is controlled by valves opened and closed\r\nby hand.\r\n\r\nSeveral methods are used to compress and exhaust the air. The most\r\nnovel method consists in having tanks in which a partial vacuum is\r\nproduced by allowing water to flow out of them into the sewer, or in\r\nhaving the air compressed by allowing water from the city mains to flow\r\ninto the tanks and displace the air. Water jets have also been used,\r\noperating similar to a steam-injector. At some of the stations water\r\nturbines drive the air-pumps, and at others steam-engines are used.\r\n\r\nThe tubes of the Paris system are of wrought iron, in lengths of from\r\nfifteen to twenty feet, the joints being made with flanges and bolts.\r\nThe interior diameter is 2.559 inches with a maximum variation to 2.519\r\ninches. The bends are made with a radius of from six to one hundred\r\nand fifty feet. Water frequently gives trouble by accumulating in the\r\ntubes. Traps are placed at low points to drain it off.\r\n\r\nThe speed of the trains of carriers in the Paris tubes is from fifteen\r\nto twenty-three miles per hour, and the average time that elapses from\r\nthe receipt of a message until its delivery is from forty to forty-five\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Pneumatic Telegraph of other Cities.=—A system similar to the\r\none just described is used in Vienna. It differs some in details of\r\napparatus, but the carriers are despatched around circuits in trains,\r\nstopping at each station, where some carriers are removed and others\r\ninserted. Brussels also is not without its system of pneumatic tubes\r\nfor the transmission of telegrams.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pneumatic Tubes in America.=—Turning our attention now to our own\r\ncountry, we cannot pass without mention some experiments of Alfred\r\nE. Beach with pneumatic railways, made nearly thirty years ago. His\r\nfirst experiment upon a large scale was made at the American Institute\r\nFair held in New York City in 1867. Here he had constructed a circular\r\nwooden tube, one hundred and seven feet long and six feet in diameter.\r\nA car that would seat ten people ran upon a track laid down inside the\r\ntube, and was propelled by a helix fan ten feet in diameter, making\r\ntwo hundred revolutions per minute. He next tried his railway upon\r\na practical scale, constructing an eight-foot tunnel for two hundred\r\nfeet under Broadway, starting at the corner of Warren Street. A car\r\nwas propelled by a large rotary blower located in the basement of a\r\nbuilding near by. The blower was kept constantly running, and the car\r\nwas sent alternately in one direction and then the other by changing\r\nvalves at the blower. Few people know that this experimental line still\r\nexists under Broadway as Mr. Beach left it.\r\n\r\nThe most extensive use of small pneumatic tubes in this country has\r\nbeen in our large retail department stores for despatching cash to\r\nand from a centrally located cashier’s desk. Seamless brass tubes\r\nare usually used, and, since the tubes are short, the air is either\r\ncompressed or exhausted by means of positive rotary blowers. At the\r\noutlying stations the tubes are usually open to the atmosphere, while\r\nat the central station simple forms of valves are used for sending and\r\nreceiving. An outgoing and a return tube are always used, and the air\r\nis kept in constant circulation. The carriers are of metal with felt\r\npacking rings and open on the side. These cash-carrying systems have\r\ncome into use during the past twenty-five years.\r\n\r\nThe Western Union Telegraph Company uses small tubes to transmit its\r\nmessages to a considerable extent in some of our large cities. In\r\n1876 four lines were laid in New York City from the main office on\r\nBroadway: two to the branch office at No. 14 Broad Street, one to 134\r\nPearl Street, and one to the Cotton Exchange. Since then this company\r\nhas laid a double line about two miles in length under Broadway to its\r\nup-town office. It also uses tubes to send messages from the receiving\r\ndesks to the operating rooms within the buildings.\r\n\r\nMany of our large hotels use pneumatic tubes to transmit messages to\r\nthe different floors and offices of the buildings, taking the place of\r\nmessenger, or bell boys, who formerly did this service.\r\n\r\nWe call especial attention to the fact that in all the systems that we\r\nhave mentioned which are in use both in this country and in Europe,\r\nnone of the tubes are larger than three inches internal diameter;\r\nalso that in all the systems, except in Paris where the carriers are\r\ndespatched in trains, the carriers are so light and move so slowly that\r\nthey can be stopped by allowing them to come in contact with some solid\r\nobject, such as a box into which the carriers drop. Very few of the\r\ntubes are more than two miles in length, and most of them are less than\r\none mile. A speed of more than thirty miles per hour has seldom been\r\nattempted, and usually it is much less than this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE PNEUMATIC TRANSIT COMPANY AND THE FIRST PNEUMATIC TUBES FOR THE\r\nTRANSPORTATION OF UNITED STATES MAIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Organization.=—Early in the year 1892 several Philadelphia gentlemen\r\norganized a corporation and obtained a charter in the State of\r\nNew Jersey to construct, lay, and operate pneumatic tubes for the\r\ntransmission of United States mail, packages, merchandise, messages,\r\netc., within the States of New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The corporation\r\nwas styled the Pneumatic Transit Company. Mr. William J. Kelly was\r\nelected president, and the company is still under his management.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WM. J. KELLY,\r\n\r\nPresident of the Pneumatic Transit Co.]\r\n\r\n=Aim and Object of the Company.=—When the Pneumatic Transit Company\r\nwas formed, it was the aim and object of its promoters to construct\r\nan extensive system of underground tubes in the City of Philadelphia\r\nwhich would serve, first, for the rapid transmission of mail, second,\r\nfor the quick delivery of merchandise from the large retail stores,\r\nthird, for the transmission of telegrams or messages within the city\r\nlimits, and, fourth, to conduct a general local express business with\r\ngreater speed than can be done in any other manner. To accomplish\r\nthis result sub-stations were to be located six or eight blocks apart\r\nthroughout a large portion of the city, and a central station was to be\r\nestablished in the centre of the business section. Stations were\r\nalso to be established in the more important retail stores and large\r\noffice buildings, and all of the stations were to be connected by tubes\r\nforming one large system.\r\n\r\nFor the transmission of mail it was planned to connect the main\r\npost-office with the sub-post-offices by tubes of a size large enough\r\nto carry all of the first-class and most of the other classes of\r\nmail matter. The sub-post-offices would be divided into groups, all\r\nof the offices in one group being connected to the same line, which\r\nwould terminate at the main post-office. Most of the business would\r\nbe between the main and individual sub-offices; in addition to this\r\nthere would be some local mail sent between the sub-offices which, for\r\noffices in the same group, could be despatched directly without passing\r\nthrough the main office. The advantages to be gained by the use of\r\nthese tubes over the present wagon service are very apparent. It places\r\nall the sub-post-offices in almost instant communication with the main\r\noffice and with each other.\r\n\r\nIt was a part of the general plan to lay tubes from the main\r\npost-office to the railway stations, thereby hastening the despatch and\r\nreceipt of mails to and from the trains.\r\n\r\nIt was expected that the bulk of the business would consist in the\r\ndelivery of parcels from the retail stores to the private houses in the\r\nresidence sections of the city. Of course it would not be practicable\r\nto lay a tube to each house, but with a station not more than four or\r\nfive blocks away, the parcels would be sent through the tube to the\r\nnearest station, and then delivered by messengers to the houses with a\r\nminimum loss of time. Ladies could do their shopping and find their\r\npurchases at home when they returned.\r\n\r\nThe same tubes used for parcel delivery would also be used for a\r\ndistrict messenger service. With numerous public stations in convenient\r\nlocations, all the advantages of the European system would be realized\r\nin the quick despatch of letters and telegrams. Every one knows how\r\nmuch time is consumed by district messenger-boys in the delivery of\r\nmessages, especially when they have to go long distances, and no\r\nargument is required to show that this time would be very much reduced\r\nby the use of pneumatic tubes, besides prompt delivery would be made\r\nmuch more certain.\r\n\r\nThe tubes of this system were to be six or eight inches in diameter,\r\nwith a few small tubes in localities where the message service is very\r\nheavy.\r\n\r\nWithout going more into detail, such were in brief the plans of the\r\npromoters of this new company; but before launching such an enterprise,\r\ninvolving a large amount of capital, there were many engineering and\r\nmechanical problems to be solved. It was not simply a question of\r\nobtaining tubes and laying them in the streets, but ways and means\r\nfor operating them must be devised. Up to this time only small tubes\r\nhad been used for the transmission of telegrams, messages, cash, and\r\nother light objects. Now it was proposed to transmit heavy and bulky\r\nmaterial. There was no experience for a guide.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Clay-Lieb Patents.=—The Pneumatic Transit Company at this time\r\nturned to the Electro-Pneumatic Transit Company, of New Jersey, a\r\nnational company that had been in existence since 1886, and which\r\nclaimed to own valuable patents, for the ways and means to carry out\r\nits new enterprise. The patents were those of Henry Clay and Charles\r\nA. Lieb, and the rights to use them in the State of Pennsylvania\r\nwere procured by the Pneumatic Transit Company, under a contract\r\nentered into between the two companies. The patents claimed to cover\r\na practical working system by which a large number of stations\r\ncould be connected to a system of main and branch tubes, with\r\nelectrically-operated switches at the junctions of the branches with\r\nthe main lines. Any person who gives the subject a little thought\r\nwill at once see the advantages of such a system if it could be made\r\nto operate. Up to the present time only single- or double-line tubes\r\nhave been used, without branches. In the European systems, frequently\r\nseveral stations are located along a line, but the carriers must stop\r\nat each station, be examined, and if they are destined for another\r\nstation, they must be redespatched. The cash systems used in many\r\nof our large stores have independent tubes running from the central\r\ncashier’s desk to each station about the store. It is plain to be seen\r\nthat, if several of these stations could be connected by branches to\r\na main tube, a large amount of tubing would be saved—a most desirable\r\nresult. The advantages of such a system would be still greater for long\r\nlines of tube laid under the pavements, extending to stations located\r\nin different parts of a large city. It was such a result that the\r\npatents of Clay and Lieb aimed to accomplish.\r\n\r\nIn order to demonstrate the practicability of the system, the\r\nElectro-Pneumatic Transit Company had constructed in the basement of\r\nthe Mills Building, on Broad Street, New York, a short line of small\r\nbrass tubing, about two or three inches in diameter, with one branch,\r\nthus connecting three stations together. The tube was very short,\r\nprobably not more than two hundred feet in length. The air-pressure\r\nrequired was very slight, probably not more than an ounce or two, being\r\nsupplied by a small blower run by an electric motor.\r\n\r\nAt the junction of the branch and the main tube was located a switch\r\nthat could be moved across the main tube and so deflect the approaching\r\ncarrier into the branch. This switch was moved by an electro-magnet,\r\nor solenoid, that could be excited by pressing a button at the station\r\nfrom which the carrier was sent. When the carrier passed into the\r\nbranch tube it set the switch back into its normal position, so that a\r\nsecond carrier, following the first, would pass along the main tube,\r\nunless the switch was again moved by pressing the button at the sending\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nThis tube in the Mills Building worked well, but it was of a size\r\nonly suited to the transmission of cash in a store or other similar\r\nservice. It could not be said, because this tube worked well, that\r\na larger and longer tube with numerous branches would work equally\r\nwell. In fact, there are several reasons why such a tube would not\r\noperate satisfactorily. The method of operating the switches was\r\nimpracticable. Suppose the branch tube had been located two miles away\r\nfrom the sending station and that it would take a carrier four minutes\r\nto travel from the sending station to the junction of the branch tube.\r\nAgain, suppose that we have just despatched a carrier destined for a\r\nstation on the main line beyond the junction, and that we wish to\r\ndespatch the second carrier to be switched off into the branch tube,\r\nwe must wait at least four minutes, until the first carrier has passed\r\nthe junction, before we can press the button and set the switch for\r\nthe second carrier which may be on its way. How are we to know when\r\nthe first carrier has passed the junction, and when the second will\r\narrive there, in order that we may throw the switch at the proper time?\r\nMust we hold our watch and time each carrier? It is plain that this is\r\nnot practical. I take this as an illustration of the impracticability\r\nof the Clay-Lieb System as constructed in the Mills Building when\r\nextended to practical dimensions. I will not describe the mechanism and\r\ndetails of the system, which are ingenious, but will say in passing\r\nthat the automatic sluice-gates, which work very well in a three-inch\r\ntube with carriers weighing an ounce or two and air-pressures of only\r\na few ounces per square inch, would be useless and could not be made\r\nto operate in a six-inch tube with carriers weighing from eight to\r\ntwenty-five pounds and an air-pressure of from five to twenty-five\r\npounds per square inch. For further information the reader is referred\r\nto the patents of Clay and Lieb.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Franchises and First Government Contract.=—In the spring of 1892\r\nan ordinance was passed by Common and Select Councils, and signed\r\nby the Mayor of the City of Philadelphia, permitting the Pneumatic\r\nTransit Company to lay pneumatic tubes in the streets of that city.\r\nAt the time this franchise was granted negotiations were in progress\r\nwith the post-office department, in Washington, for the construction\r\nof a six-inch pneumatic tube, connecting the East Chestnut Street\r\nsub-post-office, at Third and Chestnut Streets, with the main\r\npost-office, at Ninth and Chestnut Streets, for the transmission of\r\nmail. This sub-post-office was selected because more mail passes\r\nthrough it daily than any other sub-office in the city, it being\r\nlocated near the centre of the banking district. Negotiations were\r\ndelayed by various causes, so that the contract with the government was\r\nnot signed until October, 1892.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.\r\n\r\nSIX-INCH PNEUMATIC TUBES IN PROCESS OF BORING AT THE SHOP OF A.\r\nFALKENAU, PHILADELPHIA, PA.]\r\n\r\n=Search for Tubes.=—It was at this time that the writer was first\r\nemployed by the Pneumatic Transit Company, as engineer, to superintend\r\nthe construction of this line. The company commenced at once to\r\ncarry out its contract with the United States government, both the\r\npost-office department and the company being very desirous of having\r\nthe work completed before winter. The time was very short for such\r\nan undertaking, but wrought-iron tubes had already been ordered of a\r\nwell-known firm who manufacture pipe and tubing of all kinds. After\r\nwaiting four or five weeks the first lot of tubes were finished,\r\nbut upon inspection it was found that they were not sufficiently\r\naccurate and smooth on the interior to permit of their being used\r\nfor the purpose intended. The next thing that suggested itself was\r\nseamless drawn brass tubes. While they would be very expensive, the\r\nprocess of manufacture makes them eminently suited for the purpose,\r\nbut they could not be obtained in time. A city ordinance prohibits\r\nthe opening of the streets of Philadelphia during the winter months\r\nexcept in extreme cases. Accurate tubes must be had, and had quickly.\r\nIt then occurred to the writer that it might be possible to bore a\r\nsufficient quantity of ordinary cast-iron water-pipe and fit\r\nthe ends accurately together to answer our purpose. Inquiry was made\r\nat nearly all the machine-shops in the city, to ascertain how many\r\nboring-machines could be put upon this work of boring nearly six\r\nthousand feet of six-inch pipe. It was found impossible to get the work\r\ndone in time, if it was to be done in the usual manner of boring with\r\na rigid bar. At last a man was found in Mr. A. Falkenau, engineer and\r\nmachinist, who was prepared to contract for the construction of twelve\r\nspecial boring-machines and to bore all the tubing required. Suffice it\r\nto say, that the machines were built, and about six thousand feet of\r\ntubes were bored, between November 8 and December 31.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.\r\n\r\n_PIPE BORING APPARATUS._]\r\n\r\n=Method of Manufacturing Tubes.=—The process of boring was novel in\r\nsome respects, and might be termed reaming rather than boring. Figs.\r\n4 and 5 show the interior of the shop and the twelve machines. Fig. 6\r\nis a drawing of one of the machines. A long flexible bar rotated the\r\ncutter-head, which was pulled through the tube, in distinction from\r\nbeing pushed. In order to give the feeding motion, a screw was attached\r\nto the cutter-head and extended through the tube in advance of it. The\r\nfeed-screw was drawn forward by a nut attached to a hand-wheel located\r\nat the opposite end of the tube from which the boring began. Since it\r\nwas not necessary that the tubes should be perfectly straight, a method\r\nof this kind was permissible, in which the cutters could be allowed to\r\nfollow the cored axis of the tube. Air from a Sturtevant blower was\r\nforced through the tubes during the process of boring, for the double\r\npurpose of clearing the chips from the cutters and keeping them cool.\r\nAfter the tubes were reamed, each piece had to be placed in a lathe,\r\nhave a counter-bore turned in the bottom of the bell, and have the\r\nother end squared off and turned for a short distance on the outside to\r\nfit the counter-bore of the next section.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Laying and Opening the Tubes for Traffic.=—The first tubes were laid\r\nabout the middle of November, but December 1 came before the work was\r\ncompleted and special permission had to be obtained from the city\r\nto carry on the work after that date. All work was suspended during\r\nthe holidays in order not to interfere with the holiday trade of the\r\nstores on Chestnut Street. Severe frosts prevailed at that season, so\r\nthat when the work was begun again, after the holidays, bonfires had\r\nto be built in the streets to thaw out the ground in order to take up\r\nthe paving-stones and dig the trench for the tubes. Several times the\r\ntrench was filled with snow by unusually heavy storms. Notwithstanding\r\nall these delays and annoyances, the work was pushed forward, when\r\na less determined company would have given it up, and was finally\r\ncompleted. A formal opening took place on February 17, 1893, when Hon.\r\nJohn Wanamaker, then Postmaster-General, sent through the tube the\r\nfirst carrier, containing a Bible wrapped in the American flag.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly a credit to the Pneumatic Transit Company and its\r\nmanagers that they were able to complete this first line of tubes so\r\nquickly and successfully under such trying circumstances. The tubes\r\nhave been in successful operation from the opening until the present\r\ntime, a period of nearly four years, and the repairs that have been\r\nmade during that time have not required its stoppage for more than a\r\nfew hours.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1895 the sub-post-office was removed from Chestnut\r\nStreet to the basement of the Bourse (see Fig. 7). This required the\r\nabandonment of a few feet of tube on Chestnut Street and the laying of\r\na slightly greater amount on Fourth Street, thus increasing the total\r\nlength of the tubes a little. Wrought-iron tube, coated with some\r\nalloy, probably composed largely of tin or zinc, was used for this\r\nextension. The wrought-iron tube is not as good as the bored cast iron.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.\r\n\r\nBOURSE BUILDING, PHILADELPHIA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.\r\n\r\nPNEUMATIC TUBES SUSPENDED IN THE BASEMENT OF THE MAIN POST-OFFICE.]\r\n\r\n=Description of the Tubes, Method of Laying, etc.=—This Chestnut\r\nStreet line consists of two tubes, one for despatching carriers from\r\nand the other to the main post-office. The distance between the two\r\nstations is two thousand nine hundred and seventy-four feet, requiring\r\nfive thousand nine hundred and forty-eight feet of tube. The inside\r\ndiameter of the tube is six and one-eighth inches, and it was made in\r\nsections each about eleven feet long, with “bells” cast upon one end,\r\nin order to join the sections with lead and oakum, calked in the usual\r\nmanner of making joints in water- and gas-pipes, with this exception,\r\nthat at the bottom of the bell a counter-bore was turned to receive\r\nthe finished end of the next section. By thus machining the ends of\r\neach section of tube and having them fit accurately together, male and\r\nfemale, a practically continuous tube was formed with no shoulders\r\nupon the interior to obstruct the smooth passage of the carriers.\r\nJoints made in this way possess another great advantage over flanged\r\nand bolted joints, in that they are slightly yielding without\r\nleaking, and so allow for expansion and contraction due to changes of\r\ntemperature. Each joint takes care of the expansion and contraction of\r\nits section, which is very slight, but if all were added together would\r\namount to a very large movement. Another advantage of the “bell” joint\r\nis that it permits slight bends to be made in the line of tube without\r\nrequiring special bent sections. Where short bends had to be made, at\r\nstreet corners, in entering buildings, and other similar places, brass\r\ntubes were used, bent to a radius of not less than six feet, or about\r\ntwelve times the diameter of the tube. (One of the brass bends may be\r\nseen in Fig. 10.) The bends were made of seamless tubing, bent to the\r\ndesired form and radius in a hydraulic machine. To prevent them from\r\nbeing flattened in the process of bending, they were filled with resin,\r\nwhich was afterwards melted out. Flanges were screwed and soldered\r\nto the ends of the bent brass tubes, and they were bolted to special\r\nflanged sections of the iron tube.\r\n\r\nThe tubes were laid in the trench and supported by having the ground\r\nfirmly tamped about them. Usually one tube was laid above the other,\r\nwith an iron bracket between, but frequently this arrangement had to\r\nbe departed from in order to avoid obstructions, such as gas- and\r\nwater-pipes, sewers, man-holes, etc. The depth of the tubes below the\r\npavement varied from two to six feet, and in one place, in order to\r\npass under a sewer, the extreme depth of thirteen feet was reached. At\r\nthe street crossings it was frequently difficult to find sufficient\r\nspace to lay the tubes. At the intersection of Fifth and Chestnut\r\nStreets a six-inch water-main had to be cut and a bend put in. A\r\nseven-strand electric cable, used for telephoning and signalling,\r\nwas laid upon the top of one of the tubes, protected by a strip of\r\n“vulcanized wood,” grooved to fit over the cable. The cable and\r\nprotecting strip of wood were fastened to the tube by wrought-iron\r\nstraps and bolts.\r\n\r\nThe tubes enter the main post-office on the Chestnut Street side,\r\nthrough one of the windows, and are suspended from the ceiling along\r\nthe corridor in the basement for a distance of nearly two hundred\r\nfeet. Fig. 8 shows the tubes thus suspended. They terminate upon the\r\nground floor about the centre of the building, and near the cancelling\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.\r\n\r\nDUPLEX AIR-COMPRESSOR IN THE BASEMENT OF THE MAIN POST-OFFICE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.\r\n\r\nTANKS AND TUBE IN THE BASEMENT OF THE MAIN POST-OFFICE.]\r\n\r\n=Air-Compressor—Method of Circulating the Air.=—The current of air\r\nthat operates the tubes is supplied by a duplex air-compressor\r\nlocated in the basement of the main post-office. This machine is\r\nshown in Fig. 9, and requires no detailed description, as it does not\r\ndiffer materially from air-compressors used for other purposes. The\r\nstroke is twenty-four inches, the diameter of the steam-cylinders\r\nten inches, and the air-cylinders eighteen inches. The air-cylinders\r\nare double acting, with poppet-valves, and have a closed suction.\r\nThe speed of the machine varies slightly, being controlled by a\r\npressure-regulator that maintains a practically constant pressure\r\nin the tank that feeds the tube. The engines develop a little over\r\nthirty horse-power under normal conditions. The pressure of the air\r\nas it leaves the compressor is usually six or seven pounds per square\r\ninch. Compressing the air heats it to about 156° F., but this is not\r\nsufficient to require water-jackets about the air-cylinders. From the\r\ncompressor the air flows to a tank, shown on the right in\r\nFig. 10, where any oil or dirt contained in the air is deposited. The\r\nprincipal purpose of the tank is, however, to form a cushion to reduce\r\nthe pulsations in the air caused by the periodic discharge from the\r\ncylinders of the compressors, and make the current in the tube more\r\nsteady. From this tank the air flows to the sending apparatus on the\r\nground floor of the post-office and thence through the outgoing tube\r\nto the sub-post-office. At the sub-post-office, after flowing through\r\nthe receiving and sending apparatus, it enters the return tube and\r\nflows back to the main office, passing through the receiving apparatus\r\nthere and then to a tank in the basement,—the left tank in Fig. 10. The\r\nair-compressor draws its supply from this tank, so that the air is used\r\nover and over again. This return tank has an opening to the atmosphere,\r\nwhich allows air to enter and make up for any leakage or escape at the\r\nsending and receiving apparatus, thereby maintaining the atmospheric\r\npressure in the discharge end of the tube and in the suction of the\r\ncompressor. The tank serves to catch any moisture and dirt that come\r\nout of the tube. Fig. 11 is a diagram showing the direction and course\r\nof the air-current. It will be noticed that both the out-going and\r\nreturn tube are operated by _pressure_, in distinction from _exhaust_.\r\nThe air is forced around the circuit by the air-compressor. There is no\r\nexhausting from the return tube. The pressure of the air when it enters\r\nthe tube at the main post-office is, say, seven pounds per square inch;\r\nwhen it arrives at the sub-post-office the pressure is about three and\r\nthree-quarters pounds, and when it gets back to the main office and\r\nenters the return tank, the pressure is zero or atmospheric. Thus it\r\nwill be seen that the pressure becomes less and less as the air flows\r\nalong the tube. This is not the pressure that moves the carriers, but\r\nthe pressure of the air in the tube, a pressure that exists when there\r\nare no carriers in the tube. It is the pressure that would be indicated\r\nif you should drill a hole into the tube and attach a gauge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\n=Terminal Apparatus.=—When the construction of this line was begun, it\r\nwas the intention of the Pneumatic Transit Company to use the apparatus\r\nof the Electro-Pneumatic Transit Company, at both stations, for sending\r\nand receiving carriers, and so-called working-drawings were obtained\r\nfor this purpose. The sending apparatus was constructed according to\r\nthe designs furnished, but, upon examination of the drawings of the\r\nreceiving apparatus, it was so apparent that it would not work as\r\nintended that it was never constructed.\r\n\r\nThe writer was asked to design an automatic receiver to stop the\r\ncarriers without shock upon their arrival at the stations, and to\r\ndeliver them upon a table without appreciable escape of air,—something\r\nthat would answer the requirements of the present plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.\r\n\r\n_TRANSMITTER.—PHILA._\r\n\r\nSENDING APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Sender.=—The sending apparatus is for the purpose of enabling\r\nthe operator to place a carrier in the tube without allowing the air\r\nto escape. In other words, it is a means of despatching carriers. The\r\napparatus for this purpose, already referred to, is simply a valve. A\r\nside view and section of it are shown in Fig. 12. Fig. 15 is a view of\r\nthe apparatus in the main post-office. The sending apparatus is seen\r\non the left. Fig. 13 is a view of the sub-post-office apparatus, and\r\nhere a man may be seen in the act of despatching a carrier. Referring\r\nto the section, Fig. 12, it will be seen that the sending apparatus\r\nconsists of a short section of tube supported on trunnions and enclosed\r\nin a circular box. Normally this short section of tube stands in line\r\nwith the main tube, and the air-current passes directly through it.\r\nIt is shown in this position in the figure. When a carrier is to be\r\ndespatched, this short section of tube is rotated by a handle until\r\none end comes into coincidence with an opening in the side of the box.\r\nIn this position the air flows through the box around the movable\r\ntube. A carrier can then be placed in the short section of tube and be\r\nrotated by the handle into line with the main tube. The carrier will\r\nthen be carried along with the current of air. A circular plate covers\r\nthe opening in the box where the carrier is inserted when the sending\r\napparatus is closed.\r\n\r\nAt the sub-post-office this sending apparatus is placed in a horizontal\r\nposition, but its operation is the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.\r\n\r\nRECEIVING AND SENDING APPARATUS IN THE SUB-POST-OFFICE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.\r\n\r\n_APPARATUS AT SUB-STATION—PHILA._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.\r\n\r\nTERMINALS OF THE TUBE IN THE MAIN POST-OFFICE.]\r\n\r\n=Sub-Post-Office Receiver.=—We have already explained that the\r\nair-pressure in the tube at the sub-post-office is about three and\r\nthree-quarters pounds per square inch. With such a pressure we\r\ncannot open the tube to allow the carriers to come out. They must\r\nbe received in a chamber that can be closed to the tube after the\r\narrival of a carrier and then opened to the atmosphere. Furthermore,\r\nthis chamber must act as an air-cushion to check the momentum of the\r\ncarriers. Fig. 13 shows the sub-post-office apparatus when a carrier\r\nis being delivered from the receiving apparatus, or, as we will name\r\nit for convenience, the receiver. Fig. 14 is a drawing of the same\r\napparatus, partly in section, that shows more clearly its method\r\nof operation. This drawing shows the sending apparatus in a\r\ndifferent position from Fig. 13, but that is immaterial. The receiver\r\nconsists of a movable section of tube, about twice the length of a\r\ncarrier, closed at one end, supported upon trunnions, and normally\r\nin a position to form a continuation of the main tube from which the\r\ncarriers are received. When a carrier arrives it runs directly into\r\nthe receiver, which being closed at the end forms an air-cushion\r\nthat stops the carrier without shock or injury. Just before reaching\r\nthe receiving chamber the current of air passes out through slots in\r\nthe walls of the tube into a jacket that conducts it to the sending\r\napparatus, as shown in Fig. 14. At the closed end of the receiving\r\nchamber, or air-cushion, is a relief valve, normally held closed by\r\na spring. As the carrier compresses the air in front of it, this\r\nvalve opens and allows some of the air to escape, which prevents the\r\ncarrier from rebounding into the tube. Under the outer end of the\r\nreceiving chamber is a vertical cylinder, E, Fig. 14, supported upon\r\nthe base-plate containing a piston. The piston of this cylinder is\r\nconnected by a piston- and connecting-rod to the receiving chamber.\r\nWhen air is admitted to the cylinder under the piston, the latter rises\r\nand tilts the receiving chamber to an angle of about forty degrees,\r\nwhich allows the carrier to slide out. The receiving chamber carries\r\na circular plate, C, that covers the end of the main tube when it is\r\ntilted. A small piston slide-valve, F, located near the trunnion of\r\nthe receiving chamber, controls the admission and discharge of air to\r\nand from the cylinder E, upon the arrival of a carrier. When a carrier\r\narrives and compresses the air in the air-cushion or receiving\r\nchamber, a small portion of this compressed air is forced through pipe\r\nG, to a small cylinder containing a piston and located just above the\r\npiston slide-valve F. The increased pressure acting on the piston moves\r\nit downward, and it in turn moves the slide-valve F. Thus it will be\r\nseen that the stopping of the carrier causes the receiving chamber to\r\nbe tilted and the carrier slides out on to an inclined platform, K.\r\nThis platform is hinged at one end, and supported at the angle seen\r\nin the figure by a counterweight. When a carrier rests upon it, the\r\nweight of the carrier is sufficient to bear it down into a horizontal\r\nposition; in this position the carrier rolls off on to a table or\r\nshelf. The platform, K, is connected by rods, bell-cranks, etc., to the\r\npiston slide-valve, so that when it swings downward by the weight of\r\na carrier, the slide-valve is moved upward into its normal position,\r\nand this causes the receiving chamber to tilt back into a horizontal\r\nposition ready to receive the next carrier. The time that elapses from\r\nthe arrival of a carrier until the receiving chamber has returned to\r\nits horizontal position is not more than three or four seconds. Nothing\r\ncould operate in a more satisfactory manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Main Post-Office Receiver.=—At the main post-office we have a\r\nreceiver of a different type. It will be remembered that the pressure\r\nin the return tube at the main post-office is nearly down to zero or\r\natmospheric, so that we can open the tube to allow the carriers to pass\r\nout without noise or an annoying blast of air. Figs. 15 and 16 show\r\nthe main-office apparatus, and Fig. 17 is a drawing of the same. Here\r\nthe receiver consists of a section of tube closed by a sluice-gate,\r\nlocated at B, Fig. 17. The air-current passes out through slots in the\r\ntube into a branch pipe leading to the return tank in the basement.\r\nThese slots are located about four feet back of the sluice-gate, so\r\nthat the portion of the tube between the slots and the sluice-gate\r\nforms an air-cushion to check the momentum of the carriers. The\r\nsluice-gate is raised and lowered by a piston moving in a cylinder\r\nlocated just above the gate. The movement of this piston is controlled\r\nby a piston slide-valve in a manner similar to the apparatus at the\r\nsub-post-office. Air for operating the piston is conveyed through the\r\npipe D, Fig. 17, from the pipe leading from the air-compressor to the\r\nsending apparatus. This air is at about seven pounds pressure per\r\nsquare inch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.\r\n\r\nRECEIVING APPARATUS AT THE MAIN POST-OFFICE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.\r\n\r\n_APPARATUS AT THE MAIN OFFICE—PHILA._]\r\n\r\nWhen a carrier arrives, after passing the slots that allow the\r\nair-current to flow into the branch pipe, it compresses the air in\r\nfront of it against the gate. This compression checks its momentum,\r\nand it comes gradually to rest. The air compressed between the\r\ncarrier and the sluice-gate operates to move the piston slide-valve,\r\nthereby admitting air to the gate cylinder under the piston, which\r\nrises, carrying with it the sluice-gate. The tube is now open to the\r\natmosphere, and there is just sufficient pressure in the tube to push\r\nthe carrier out on to a table arranged to receive it. As the carrier\r\npasses out of the tube it lifts a finger out of its path. This finger\r\nis located at E, Fig. 17, and when it is lifted by the passing carrier\r\nit moves the piston slide-valve, and the sluice-gate is closed. A valve\r\nis located in the branch-pipe that conducts the air to the return tank\r\nin the basement. If the pressure in the tube is not sufficient to\r\npush the carrier out on to the table, this valve is partially closed,\r\nthereby increasing the pressure to a desired amount.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.\r\n\r\nCARRIER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.\r\n\r\nCARRIER.]\r\n\r\n=The Carrier.=—We have frequently spoken of the carrier, which contains\r\nthe mail and other parcels that are transported from one office to\r\nthe other. In Fig. 13, showing the sub-post-office apparatus, we see\r\none of these carriers being despatched by the attendant and another\r\nbeing delivered from the tube. In Fig. 15 several carriers may be\r\nseen standing on the floor. Fig. 18 shows a carrier with the lid\r\nopen, ready to receive a charge of mail, and Fig. 19 shows the same\r\nclosed, ready for despatching. The construction of the carrier is\r\nshown by the drawing, Fig. 20. The body of the carrier is steel,\r\nabout one-thirty-second of an inch in thickness. It is made from a\r\nflat sheet, bent into a cylinder, riveted, and soldered. The\r\nlength outside is eighteen inches, and the inside diameter is five and\r\none-quarter inches. The front end is made of a convex disk of steel,\r\nstamped in the desired form, and secured to the body of the carrier\r\nby rivets, with the convex side inward. It is necessary to have a\r\nbuffer upon the front end of the carrier to protect it from blows\r\nthat it might receive, and this buffer is made by filling the concave\r\nside of the front head with felt, held in place by a disk of leather\r\nand a central bolt. The leather disk is made of two pieces, riveted\r\ntogether, with a steel washer between. The steel washer is attached\r\nto the head of the bolt. The carrier is supported in the tube on two\r\nbearing-rings, located on the body of the carrier a short distance from\r\neach end. The location of these rings is so chosen that it permits a\r\ncarrier of maximum length to pass through a bend in the tube of minimum\r\nradius without becoming wedged. This is a very important feature in the\r\nconstruction of carriers, but does not appear to have been utilized in\r\nother systems.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.\r\n\r\n_MAIL CARRIER.—PHILA._]\r\n\r\nThe bearing-rings are made of fibrous woven material, especially\r\nprepared, and held in place by being clamped between two metal rings,\r\none of which is riveted to the body of the carrier. Of course these\r\nrings wear out and have to be replaced occasionally, but their usual\r\nlife is about one thousand miles. The rear end of the carrier is closed\r\nby a hinged lid and secured by a special lock. The lock consists of\r\nthree radial bolts that pass through the body of the carrier and the\r\nrim of the lid. These bolts are thrown by three cams, attached to a\r\nshort shaft that passes through the lid and has a handle or lever\r\nattached to it upon the outside of the lid. This cam-shaft is located\r\nout of the geometrical centre of the lid in such a position that when\r\nthe lever or handle is swung around in the unlocked position, it\r\nprojects beyond the periphery of the lid, and in this position the\r\ncarrier will not enter the tube. When the lid is closed and locked,\r\nthe lever lies across the lid in the position shown in Fig. 19, and\r\nwhen the carrier is in the tube it cannot become unlocked, for the\r\nlever cannot swing around without coming in contact with the wall of\r\nthe tube. This insures against the possibility of the carriers opening\r\nduring transit through the tube. The empty carriers weigh about nine\r\npounds, and when filled with mail, from twelve to fifteen pounds. They\r\nhave a capacity for two hundred ordinary letters, packed in the usual\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Operation of the Tubes.=—The tubes are kept in constant operation\r\nduring the day, and six days of the week. The air-compressor is started\r\nat nine o’clock in the morning and runs until seven in the evening,\r\nexcept during the noon hour, the air flowing in a constant steady\r\ncurrent through the tubes. When a carrier is placed in the tube it is\r\ncarried along in the current without appreciably affecting the load on\r\nthe compressor. Carriers may be despatched at six-second intervals,\r\nand when they are despatched thus frequently at each office, there will\r\nbe eighteen carriers in the tube at the same time. If ten carriers per\r\nminute are despatched from each office, and each carrier contains two\r\nhundred letters, the tube has a carrying capacity of two hundred and\r\nforty thousand letters per hour, which is far beyond the requirements\r\nof this office. About five hundred carriers a day are despatched\r\nfrom each office. This varies considerably on different days and at\r\ndifferent seasons of the year. Experience has taught that a certain\r\nperiod of time should elapse between the despatching of carriers, in\r\norder that they may not come in contact with each other, and that the\r\nreceivers may have time to act. With the present plant this period is\r\nmade about six seconds. In order to make it impossible for carriers\r\nto be despatched more frequently than this, time-locks are attached\r\nto the sending apparatus. One of these locks may be seen in Fig. 13,\r\nconnected to the handle of the sending apparatus. It is so arranged\r\nthat when a carrier is despatched a weight is raised and allowed to\r\nfall, carrying with it a piston in a cylinder filled with oil. While\r\nthe weight is rising and falling the sending apparatus is locked, but\r\nbecomes unlocked when the weight is all the way down. A by-pass in the\r\ncylinder permits the oil to flow from one side of the piston to the\r\nother, and the size of this by-pass can be regulated, thus determining\r\nthe time that the weight shall take in descending. This makes a simple\r\nand effective time-lock that does not get out of order.\r\n\r\nThe time required for a carrier to travel from the main to the\r\nsub-post-office is sixty seconds, and from the sub- to the main\r\npost-office, fifty-five seconds. This difference of time in going and\r\nreturning is due to the expansion of the air in the tube, as will\r\nbe explained more fully in another place. The distance between the\r\noffices being two thousand nine hundred and seventy-four feet, gives\r\nan average speed of about fifty-two feet per second, or 35.27 miles\r\nper hour. Of course the speed can be increased by increasing the\r\nair-pressure, but this speed is found in practice to be ample for all\r\nrequirements. In order to give some idea of the energy possessed by\r\none of these carriers travelling at this speed, it may be said that\r\nif the end of the tube were left open and turned upward, an emerging\r\ncarrier would rise about forty feet into the air. It is easy to imagine\r\nhow apparatus, depending for its operation upon impact with a moving\r\ncarrier, would be soon destroyed, as well as the carriers themselves.\r\nThis is why receiving apparatus used with small tubes and light\r\ncarriers cannot be applied to large tubes with heavy carriers.\r\n\r\nNo serious trouble has ever been experienced from carriers getting\r\nwedged in any part of these tubes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Benefits of the System.=—The advantages to the post-office department\r\nby the adoption of this system have been numerous, and the post-office\r\nofficials who are familiar with the operation of the tubes frequently\r\nspeak in high terms of their usefulness. Formerly the mail was\r\ntransported from one office to the other by a wagon making a trip\r\nevery half-hour. Considerable time has been saved by the greater speed\r\nof transit, but even more time is gained by keeping the mail moving\r\ninstead of allowing it to accumulate and then despatching it in bulk.\r\nWith the pneumatic system a letter posted in the sub-post-office will\r\nreach its destination just as quickly as if posted at the main office,\r\nand sometimes more quickly. Let us take an example, first, with the old\r\nwagon service. Suppose that you drop a letter in the sub-post-office;\r\nit lies there, say, fifteen minutes waiting for the departure of the\r\nnext wagon; it is put into a pouch with hundreds of other letters, and\r\nten minutes are consumed in transporting it to the main office. When\r\nit arrives there the pouch is thrown on the floor at the entrance of\r\nthe building; in a few minutes, more or less, a clerk takes the pouch,\r\nthrows it on a truck and wheels it around to the cancelling machines,\r\nwhere it may lie for five or ten minutes more before being opened,\r\nand then perhaps five minutes will elapse before your letter reaches\r\nthe cancelling machine. It would not be unusual for three-quarters\r\nof an hour to elapse from the time you dropped your letter in the\r\noffice until it was cancelled. Now with the pneumatic tube service\r\nforty minutes of this time will be saved; for immediately after you\r\ndrop your letter in the office it will be despatched through the tube\r\nand delivered on the table in front of the cancelling machines. Soon\r\nafter the tubes were installed the postmaster’s attention was called\r\nto an instance where letters from the sub-office were sent through\r\nthe tube and were despatched to New York City one train earlier than\r\nthey could have been had the old wagon service been in use. People\r\nfrequently post letters requesting that they be sent through the tube;\r\nof course they would be sent in that way if the request was not made,\r\nbut it shows that the public recognize the better service. Formerly\r\nmail was collected from the street boxes in the banking section of the\r\ncity and the collectors carried it to the main office. After the tubes\r\nwere installed this mail was carried to the sub-post-office to be sent\r\nthrough the tube, and the time formerly occupied in walking to the main\r\noffice was then utilized in having the men face up the letters ready\r\nfor the cancelling machines,—a double saving in time besides making\r\ntheir labor much lighter and enabling them to do more useful work.\r\n\r\nSince the sub-office has been established in the Bourse, it has been\r\nmade a distributing as well as receiving office. At least two more\r\ndeliveries of mail are made each day in the Bourse building than in any\r\nother office building in the city.\r\n\r\nAll letters mailed in the sub-office with a special delivery stamp are\r\ndespatched through the tube immediately.\r\n\r\nIt is now nearly four years since the system was put into operation.\r\nDuring that time more than thirty-five million letters have been\r\ntransported, and all the repairs to the system have not required it\r\nto be stopped for more than a few hours. During the first year the\r\nPneumatic Transit Company operated the tubes at their own expense,\r\nagreeing at the end of that time to take them out if the government so\r\nrequested. Since the first year the government has paid the running\r\nexpenses.\r\n\r\nSuch is the history of the first United States pneumatic postal system.\r\nSuch is the history of the first pneumatic tubes of sufficient size to\r\ncarry all the first class and most of the lower classes of mail, in\r\nthis or any other country, so far as the writer knows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE SYSTEM AND APPARATUS OF THE BATCHELLER PNEUMATIC TUBE COMPANY.\r\n\r\n\r\n=General Arrangement and Adaptability of the System.=—The experience\r\ngained in the construction and operation of the Philadelphia\r\npost-office tubes has naturally suggested improvements that can be\r\nmade in future construction, and, furthermore, it has taught us what\r\nthe requirements will be of an extensive system of tubes laid in the\r\nstreets of our cities, both for the transmission of mail and for\r\na general commercial business. Since the Philadelphia post-office\r\ntube was completed, we have been busily engaged in working out all\r\nthe details of a system of many stations so connected together that\r\ncarriers can be despatched in the most direct manner possible from\r\nany station to any other. It is the purpose of the present chapter to\r\ndescribe this system.\r\n\r\nWhile the Pneumatic Transit Company has ample field in the State of\r\nPennsylvania to carry out the work which it has mapped out, a field\r\nbroad enough to yield a good profit for the capital invested, there\r\nis no reason why the system should be limited to one State. So, in\r\norder to obtain a broader charter, covering all places where pneumatic\r\nservice may be needed, a new corporation was formed and styled the\r\nBATCHELLER PNEUMATIC TUBE COMPANY.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to lay down a rigid system equally well adapted to\r\nall places and purposes. We must accommodate ourselves somewhat to\r\ncircumstances. For example, the post-office department may require\r\none size of tube, arranged to operate in a particular way, while the\r\nrequirements of a parcel delivery business would be utterly different.\r\nThe geographical location of the stations will have much to do with the\r\ngeneral arrangement; also the condition of the streets. Some of the\r\nstreets of our large cities are so filled with water- and gas-pipes,\r\nelectrical conduits, sewers, steam-pipes, etc., etc., that it is almost\r\nimpossible to find space for pneumatic tubes, especially of large\r\ndiameter. Railway or water facilities have much to do with the location\r\nof a central pumping station, on account of the coal supply. All of\r\nthese and many other things have to be taken into consideration in\r\nplanning a system for any locality.\r\n\r\nWe have an example of a peculiar location and conditions in a proposed\r\nline of tubes over the New York and Brooklyn bridge connecting the main\r\npost-offices of those cities. This would be in many respects a unique\r\nplant. Two air-compressors would be used, one at each office.\r\n\r\nIn order to give a general idea how a large number of stations can be\r\nconnected into one system, the diagram Fig. 21 has been drawn.\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to the attempts of Clay and Lieb to devise\r\nmeans whereby several stations could be located along a main line and\r\ncarriers be sent from any station to any other through the main line.\r\nTheir method was to use branch tubes leading off from the main line\r\nwith switches at the junctions. They deflected the air-current into\r\nthe branch by placing an automatic closed valve in the main line just\r\nbeyond the junction, returning the air from the branch to the main line\r\njust beyond the valve. The carriers were to open and close this valve\r\nautomatically as they passed.\r\n\r\nThe branch and switch system has many attractions for the inventor,\r\nand upon first thought it would seem the most feasible solution of\r\nthe problem. It has been the dream of more than one inventor, as the\r\nrecords of the patent-office show, but no one has succeeded in working\r\nit out. The current of air cannot be divided; carriers passing from the\r\nbranch into the main line must not collide with other carriers running\r\nin the main line; a certain minimum distance must always be maintained\r\nbetween the carriers in the same tube; when a carrier is despatched\r\nit must go directly to the station for which it is intended without\r\nfurther attention from the sender and it must not interfere with other\r\ncarriers; expense of manufacture prohibits the use of any but round\r\nsmooth tubes up to eight inches in diameter, hence projections cannot\r\nbe placed upon the carrier to give it an individuality and cause it to\r\noperate a switch at any particular point along the line; the carrier is\r\nfree to rotate in a round tube about its longitudinal axis, therefore,\r\nits individuality must be indicated by some symmetrical marking about\r\nthis axis, if it is to be automatic in its operation; the speed of\r\nthe carrier is so high that electrical contacts placed in distinctive\r\npositions on the carriers cannot be used while it is in motion, for\r\nmechanism having inertia could not be moved during the short time that\r\nthe electric circuit would be closed; only the simplest attachments\r\ncan be made to the carrier, for constructional reasons and because of\r\nthe rough usage that they receive. These and numerous other reasons\r\nmake the problem most difficult. We have not attempted to solve it by\r\nthe use of branch tubes and electrically operated switches, but have\r\nadopted the simpler and equally effective method of carrying the main\r\nline through each of the stations that it unites. In our system each\r\ncarrier has an individuality determining the station at which it will\r\nbe discharged from the tube. By a simple attachment to, the front end\r\nof the carrier, consisting of a circular metal disk, the sender so\r\nmarks the carrier that it will pass all stations until it arrives at\r\nthe station for which it was destined and will there pass out of the\r\ntube. In addition to this a method has been devised whereby carriers\r\ncan be inserted into the tube without the possibility of collision with\r\ncarriers already running in the tube.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.\r\n\r\nA DIAGRAM SHOWING VARIOUS METHODS OF CONNECTING THE STATIONS OF A LARGE\r\nSYSTEM WITH PNEUMATIC TUBES.]\r\n\r\nReferring now to the diagram, Fig. 21, we have here an imaginary system\r\nwhich we will suppose to be located in some large city. The two large\r\nsquares I and II indicate central pumping stations, and the small\r\nsquares A, B, C, D, etc., indicate receiving and sending stations. Some\r\nof the stations, such as A, B, C, D, E, F, and Y, which do a large\r\namount of business and may be supposed to be large retail stores, are\r\nconnected directly with the central station by double tubes, one for\r\nsending and the other for receiving carriers. Two smaller stores, such\r\nas G and H, may be located on the same line. At I, J, K, and L we have\r\nfour stations, all connected by the same double line of tubes. These\r\nstations we will imagine to be located in the residence section of\r\nthe city. Carriers containing parcels of merchandise or other matter\r\ndestined for private residences would be sent from the stores A, B, C,\r\netc., to the central station I, where they would be transferred to the\r\nline 2 and be adjusted to stop at the station nearest the residence to\r\nwhich the parcels were addressed. From this station the parcels would\r\nbe delivered by messengers to the residences. If a carrier is to be\r\nsent from the central station I to station K, it will be so adjusted\r\nbefore it is put into the tube that it will pass stations I and J, but\r\nbe discharged automatically from the tube when it arrives at station\r\nK. In a similar manner carriers can be despatched from station L to\r\nstation I or from station J to station L. In passing through the\r\ncentral station the carriers are manually transferred from one line to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nIn another part of the city we may have another central pumping\r\nstation, II; and the two central stations may be connected by a double\r\ntrunk line, 3. Again, we have lines radiating from this central\r\nstation, as shown by station Y. There will be some localities where it\r\nwill be an advantage to arrange the stations upon a loop, as shown in\r\ncircuit 4, where stations S, T, U, V, W, and X are connected together\r\nin this way. Or we can combine the two arrangements of loop and direct\r\nline, as shown in circuit 5. Stations O and R are on the double line,\r\nbut from O a loop is formed including stations N, M, P, and Q. Here it\r\nis supposed that the stations O and R do a much larger business with\r\nthe central station II than the stations N, M, P, and Q, this being\r\nthe principal reason for placing them on the double line. All carriers\r\nmust be returned to the station from which they were sent, or others\r\nto replace them, otherwise there will be an accumulation of carriers\r\nat some of the stations. It is like a railway: there must be as many\r\ntrains despatched in one direction as the other, each day. Station O\r\ncan receive a carrier from the central station and return it directly,\r\nbut when station N receives one it must be returned via M, P, Q, O,\r\nand R, a much longer route than that by which it was received. This\r\ndisadvantage is compensated, when stations N, M, P, and Q do only a\r\nsmall amount of business, by the less cost of laying a single line.\r\nIf a carrier is to be sent from M to N, it must go via P, Q, and O,\r\nbeing manually transferred at O from the “down” to the “up” line. P\r\ncan send directly to Q, but Q must send to P via O, N, and M. R can\r\nsend directly to O and O to R. Similarly in circuit 4 the carriers must\r\nall travel around the loop in the same direction, shown by the arrows.\r\nStation S can receive carriers directly from the central station, but\r\nthey must return via U, W, X, V, and T.\r\n\r\nAgain, we may have a double-loop line, as indicated in the diagram\r\nby circuit 6. Here five stations, _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, and _e_, are\r\nconnected by a loop consisting of two lines of tube, in which the air\r\ncirculates in one direction in one line and in the opposite direction\r\nin the other. Here _b_ can send directly to _c_, _c_ directly to\r\n_b_, and _e_ to _b_ via _d_ and _c_, or via central and _a_. This\r\nis an arrangement that would be used where there is a large amount\r\nof business between the stations on the loop. As stated before, the\r\nbest arrangement for any particular locality depends entirely upon\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n=Size of Tubes.=—The pneumatic-tube system that we are describing\r\nis not limited to any particular size of tube. The size is usually\r\ndetermined by the number and size of packages to be transported.\r\nA small tube, two or three inches in diameter, is best suited for\r\ntelegrams and messages; mail, parcels, etc., require a six- or\r\neight-inch tube, while mail pouches and bulky material, a thirty-six\r\ninch or possibly larger tube. We divide tubes into three classes,\r\naccording to their size, naming them small, large, and very large\r\ntubes. By small tubes we mean those not larger than three or possibly\r\nfour inches in diameter. Large tubes are those having a diameter more\r\nthan four inches and not more than eight inches. Very large tubes\r\ninclude all that are more than eight inches. This classification is\r\nfor convenience, but it has a deeper significance. For example, in\r\nthe transportation of mail, it must either be handled in bulk, that\r\nis, in pouches, or in broken-bulk, that is, loose or tied up in small\r\npackages. There are many advantages in transporting it in broken-bulk,\r\nin fact, there are very few places where it could be handled in any\r\nother way. For this service six- or eight-inch tubes—not larger—are\r\nbest suited. The carriers are light enough to be easily handled; they\r\nare not so large in capacity as to make it necessary to wait for an\r\naccumulation of mail to fill them; they can be delivered from the tube\r\non to tables at any point in the building where the mail is wanted,\r\nfor cancelling, distribution, or pouching, thus rendering a very rapid\r\nservice; the mail is kept moving in an almost constant stream, keeping\r\nthe postal employees more uniformly employed; special carriers can be\r\ndespatched with “special delivery” letters. In other words, the most\r\nrapid service can be rendered by this size of tube.\r\n\r\nIf a larger than eight-inch tube is to be used for mail service,\r\nit should be not less than thirty-six inches. Carriers larger than\r\neight inches cannot be handled: they are too heavy. They are also too\r\nheavy to slide through the tube, hence, must be mounted upon wheels.\r\nIt is not practical to make a carrier on wheels less than eighteen\r\nor twenty-four inches, and the carrier must be at least twenty-four\r\ninches to contain a large mail-pouch. Now, if we are going to despatch\r\nmail-pouches through a pneumatic tube we must send more than one in a\r\ncarrier, otherwise the service will be too slow. Such large carriers\r\ncould not be despatched oftener than once or at most twice in a minute.\r\nSuppose we were to transport the mail from a railway station to a main\r\npost-office. A train arrives with, say, sixty pouches. If only one\r\npouch could be put into a carrier and the carriers could be despatched\r\nat half-minute intervals, it would take thirty minutes to despatch\r\nall the pouches. Now, suppose we make the tube thirty-six inches.\r\nThe carriers will be eight feet long and will contain from twelve to\r\nfifteen pouches. Five carriers would contain the entire train-load of\r\nmail, and they could be despatched in four or five minutes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.\r\n\r\nCROSS-SECTION OF A 36-INCH TUBE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.\r\n\r\nCARRIER FOR A 36-INCH TUBE.]\r\n\r\n=System of Very Large Tubes.=—The cross-section of a thirty-six-inch\r\ntube is shown in Fig. 22. It is built flat on the bottom and sides,\r\nwith an arched top. The floor is of concrete containing creosoted\r\nties; the side walls and top are of brick, plastered with cement upon\r\nthe interior. The two tubes may be built one above the other or\r\nside by side, depending upon the condition of the streets, but one\r\ncommon separating wall will serve for both. The carriers, one of which\r\nis shown in Fig. 23, run on two rails laid close to the sides of the\r\ntube. At curves a guard-rail is placed upon the side wall, making it\r\nimpossible for a carrier to leave the track. The carriers are made\r\nof hard wood with an iron frame, and are as light as consistent with\r\nthe service required of them. They are open on top. Their outside\r\ndimensions are thirty-four inches by thirty-four inches by eight feet.\r\nThe sending and receiving apparatus for these very large tubes have to\r\nbe specially designed for each particular station, so no attempt will\r\nbe made here to describe them. The air-pressure required depends upon\r\nthe length of the line. If it were not more than six or eight ounces\r\na fan would be used to maintain the air-current, but for pressures\r\nabove this, up to a pound or two per square inch, some form of positive\r\nblower would be used.\r\n\r\nAt the stations considerable floor space or “yard room” would be\r\nrequired for side tracks, switches, etc. Usually the basement of a\r\nbuilding would have to be utilized for the termination of such a tube.\r\nThere are but few places in our large cities where the streets are so\r\nfree from pipes, sewers, conduits, etc., that it would be practicable\r\nto build a thirty-six-inch pneumatic tube. When the service can be\r\nrendered by an eight-inch tube, the cost of installation favors its\r\nadoption. Steep grades cannot be ascended by these very large tubes,\r\nwhile the eight-inch tubes can be placed vertically. We do not say that\r\nthere is no use for eighteen- and twenty-four-inch tubes, but the\r\ndemand for them would be in special cases and we will not discuss them\r\nhere. For ordinary mail and parcel service we recommend the use of\r\nsix- and eight-inch tubes. An eight-inch carrier is twenty-four inches\r\nlong, about seven inches inside diameter, and will contain five hundred\r\nordinary letters. It weighs about thirteen pounds empty, and one can\r\nbe despatched every six to ten seconds. We estimate that eighty per\r\ncent. of all the parcels delivered from a large retail department store\r\ncould be wrapped up to go into these carriers. The minimum radius of\r\ncurvature of an eight-inch tube is eight feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n=General Arrangement of Apparatus in the Stations. Two-Station,\r\nTwo-Compressor Line.=—We will now proceed to a description of our\r\nsystem in detail. Figs. 24, 25, and 26 are diagrams showing how the\r\ntubes, air-compressor, tanks, sending and receiving apparatus are\r\nconnected together at the stations. These diagrams are drawn to\r\nrepresent an eight-inch tube, but essentially the same arrangement\r\nwould be used for smaller tubes.\r\n\r\nFig. 24 represents a line of two stations with an air-compressor at\r\neach station. Such an arrangement is proposed for the line of postal\r\ntubes over the New York and Brooklyn bridge, or for any two stations\r\nlocated a very long distance apart, say six or eight miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.\r\n\r\nDIAGRAM OF A TWO-STATION, TWO-COMPRESSOR LINE.]\r\n\r\nReferring to the diagram, we have at station A an air-compressor, _c_,\r\nwhich draws its supply of air from the tank _e_, and delivers it,\r\ncompressed to the necessary pressure, into the tank _d_. From the tank\r\n_d_ the air flows to the sending apparatus, _a_, and thence through\r\nthe tube _f_ to the station B. Upon arrival at B it flows through the\r\nreceiving apparatus _m_, and then by the pipe _l_ to the tank _j_. A\r\nsecond air-compressor, _o_, is located at station B, and it draws its\r\nsupply of air from the tank _j_. The tank _j_ has an opening to the\r\natmosphere, _i_, through which air can enter when the air-compressor\r\ndraws more than is supplied from the pipe _l_. The opening _i_ in the\r\ntank _j_ serves as an escape for air when the air-compressor at station\r\nA is started before that at station B. Stations A and B are similar in\r\ntheir arrangements. At B the air-compressor _o_ delivers its compressed\r\nair to the tank _k_, from which it flows to the sending apparatus _n_,\r\nand thence through the tube _g_ back to station A. Upon its arrival at\r\nA it passes through the receiving apparatus and enters the tank _e_,\r\nwhich is open to the atmosphere at _h_. The tanks _d_ and _k_ serve\r\nas separators to remove from the air any dirt and oil coming from the\r\ncompressors, and they form a cushion, deadening, to some extent, the\r\npulsations of the compressors and making the current of air in the\r\ntubes more steady and uniform. The tanks _e_ and _j_ form traps to\r\ncatch any moisture, oil, or dirt coming out of the tubes.\r\n\r\nCarriers are placed in the tubes and despatched by means of the sending\r\napparatus _a_ and _n_. They are received from the tubes and delivered\r\non to tables by means of the receiving apparatus _b_ and _m_. It will\r\nbe seen that the arrangement is such that the air flows through one\r\ntube and returns through the other, the same air being used over and\r\nover again. Any air that escapes at the sending and receiving apparatus\r\nis replaced by an equal amount entering the tanks _e_ and _j_ from the\r\natmosphere. By thus keeping the same air circulating in the tubes we\r\nprevent an accumulation of moisture in the tubes.\r\n\r\nThe air is at its maximum pressure in the tanks _d_ and _k_. The\r\npressure falls gradually as it flows along the tubes and is down to\r\natmospheric when it enters the tanks _e_ and _j_. The pressure at the\r\nreceivers, _b_ and _m_, is just sufficient to push the carriers out on\r\nto the tables. The construction of the sending and receiving apparatus\r\nwill be described in another place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.\r\n\r\nDIAGRAM OF A TWO-STATION, ONE-COMPRESSOR LINE.]\r\n\r\n=Two-Station, One-Compressor Line.=—Fig. 25 is a diagram showing two\r\nstations, A and B, connected by a double line of tubes, both operated\r\nby one air-compressor located at station A. This is the arrangement\r\nused in the Philadelphia post-office line, and is the arrangement that\r\nwill ordinarily be used for all two-station lines except where unusual\r\nconditions require something different. Station A is arranged precisely\r\nlike station A in Fig. 24, so it need not be described again. The\r\nair flows from the sending apparatus _a_ through the tube _f_ to the\r\nreceiving apparatus _p_ at station B. From the receiver _p_ it flows\r\nthrough the pipe _l_ to the sending apparatus _n_ and thence through\r\nthe tube _g_ back to station A. The receiver _p_ at station B is what\r\nwe will call a closed receiver,—_i.e._, it delivers the carrier from\r\nthe tube on to the table without opening the tube to the atmosphere.\r\nThe use of this form of receiver is made necessary by the fact that\r\nthe air-pressure in the tube at this station is considerably above\r\natmospheric. The air-pressure is at a maximum in the tank _d_. It falls\r\ngradually along the tube _f_, and when the air arrives at the receiver\r\n_p_, at station B, the pressure has fallen nearly to one-half its\r\nmaximum amount in the tank _d_. On its return journey through the tube\r\n_g_ the pressure continues falling until it reaches the atmospheric\r\npressure when the air enters the tank _e_ at station A.\r\n\r\nThe entire line of tube, going and returning, is operated by air at a\r\npressure above the atmospheric. There is no exhausting in the return\r\ntube. It is distinctly a _pressure_ system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.\r\n\r\nDIAGRAM OF A THREE- TO EIGHT-STATION LINE.]\r\n\r\n=Three- to Eight-Station Line.=—Thus far we have described only\r\ntwo-station lines. In Fig. 26 we have a diagram of three stations\r\nconnected together by a double line of tubes, and the arrangement\r\nwould be similar if it were extended to four, five, six, seven, or\r\neight stations. The stations are called A, B, and H. Station A is\r\narranged exactly the same as stations A in Figs. 24 and 25, therefore,\r\nneeds no description. Station B, being an intermediate station, is\r\nquite differently arranged from any of the preceding. From station\r\nA the air flows through the tube _f_ to station B, where it enters\r\nthe automatic receiving and transferring apparatus, _s_. From this\r\nit flows through the tube _f_{´}_ to the sending apparatus _r_, and\r\nthence through the tube _f_{´´}_ to the next station, which may be\r\nanother intermediate station, C, or the terminal station H. Station H\r\nis arranged like station B, Fig. 25. The air from the tube _f_{´´}_\r\nenters the receiver _p_, and is then returned, through the pipe _l_, to\r\nthe sending apparatus _n_. From the sending apparatus _n_ it continues\r\non its return journey through the tube _g_ to the intermediate station\r\nB, where it enters the receiver and transfer apparatus _t_, then passes\r\nto the sending apparatus _q_, and through the tube _g_{´´}_ back to\r\nthe receiver _b_ at station A. Thus we have followed the air-current\r\nout through one tube and back through the other. The current is kept\r\ncirculating by the compressor located at station A. The pressure is\r\nat a maximum in the tank _d_, and falls gradually as the air flows\r\nalong the tube until it returns to the tank _e_, when the pressure has\r\nfallen to atmospheric. A carrier is despatched from station A, and\r\nafter passing through the tube _f_ arrives at station B, where it stops\r\nmomentarily in the automatic receiver and transfer apparatus _s_. If\r\nthe carrier is intended for station B, and was properly adjusted when\r\nit was despatched at A, it will be discharged from the apparatus _s_\r\non to the table _u_. But if it were intended for some other station\r\nand were so adjusted, after the delay of two or three seconds in\r\nthe apparatus _s_, it will be automatically transferred to the tube\r\n_f_{´},_ pass through the sending apparatus _r_, and go on its journey\r\nthrough tube _f_{´´}_ to the next station. If it is not discharged from\r\nthe tube at any of the intermediate stations, it will finally arrive\r\nat the terminal station H and there stop. Just how the carriers are\r\nadjusted and the details of the receiving and transfer apparatus will\r\nbe described hereafter. Carriers arrive at station B from H, or other\r\nstations on the line, through tube _g_, in the apparatus _t_, which\r\neither discharges them on to the table _u_ or sends them on through\r\nthe tube _g_{´}_ and _g_{´´}_ to station A. Carriers are despatched\r\nfrom station B to station A by means of the sending apparatus _q_, and\r\nfrom station B to other stations along the line, C, D, E, F, G, and\r\nH, by means of the sending apparatus _r_. Thus, from B carriers can\r\nbe sent and received in either direction. In order to prevent the\r\npossibility of a collision of carriers by attempting to despatch one\r\nat station B at the instant another is passing through the sending\r\napparatus, an automatic lock is attached to each sending apparatus.\r\nJust outside the station B, say three hundred feet on each side, are\r\nlocated manholes, and in these manholes boxes are attached to the tube\r\ncontaining an electric circuit-closing apparatus, so arranged that\r\nwhen a carrier passes it will close an electric circuit leading to the\r\nsending apparatus in the station. These manholes and circuit-closers\r\nare shown and located on the diagram at _v_ and _w_. Wires _x_ and _y_\r\nlead from them to the sending apparatus _r_ and _q_. When a carrier\r\nfrom station A passes the box _v_, it closes the electric circuit _x_,\r\nwhich sets a time-lock on the sending apparatus _r_, holding this\r\napparatus locked, so that it is impossible to despatch a carrier for,\r\nsay, twelve seconds, a sufficient time for the carrier coming from the\r\nstation A to pass station B and get three hundred feet beyond it. After\r\nthe twelve seconds have elapsed the sending apparatus is unlocked and\r\na carrier can then be despatched. In a similar manner a carrier coming\r\nfrom station H, in passing the box _w_, closes the electric circuit _y_\r\nand locks the sending apparatus _q_ for a sufficient length of time to\r\nlet the carrier pass the station. This resembles, in some respects,\r\nthe “block system” as used on railroads. A “block” about six hundred\r\nfeet in length, depending upon the speed of the carriers, is made at\r\neach intermediate station with the station in the centre of the block.\r\nWhenever a carrier enters this “block” the sending apparatus at the\r\nstation is locked, and a carrier cannot be inserted into the tube to\r\ncollide with the one which is passing. It will be noted that a carrier\r\nin passing out of the “block” does not unlock the sending apparatus;\r\nthis is done automatically at a definite time after the carrier entered\r\nthe block. The unlocking is entirely independent of the carrier after\r\nit has entered the block, and the reason it is so arranged is this:\r\nsuppose that a second carrier enters the “block” before the first one\r\nleaves it; if the first carrier unlocked the apparatus when it left the\r\n“block,” then it would be unlocked with the second carrier in the block\r\nand a collision might occur, but by arranging it as we have done, if a\r\nsecond carrier enters the “block” before the first has passed out, the\r\nsending apparatus remains locked for a period of time beginning with\r\nthe arrival of the first carrier in the “block” and ending, say, twelve\r\nseconds after the arrival of the last carrier, which is sufficient time\r\nfor the last carrier to pass out of the block. Of course, if a carrier\r\nbecomes wedged in the tube a collision may occur, but this very seldom\r\nif ever happens. The details of the locking apparatus will be described\r\nin another place.\r\n\r\nIf stations A, B, ... and H were arranged on a loop, as shown in\r\ncircuit 6, Fig. 21, then station H, Fig. 26, would be at the central,\r\nor station A. If it were a single loop, like circuit 4, Fig. 21,\r\nthen there would be only one sending apparatus and one receiving and\r\ntransferring apparatus at the intermediate stations.\r\n\r\nA telephone circuit will include all stations, in order to give orders\r\nto the station attendants and to signal to the central station in case\r\nof an accident, when it might be necessary to stop the air-compressor.\r\nThe telephone wires, in the form of a lead-covered cable, are laid in\r\nthe same trench with the tubes and fastened to them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.\r\n\r\nSENDING APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.\r\n\r\nSENDING APPARATUS.—LONGITUDINAL SECTION.]\r\n\r\n=The Sending Apparatus.=—We have, in the preceding pages, frequently\r\nspoken of the sending apparatus, and have described it as mechanism by\r\nwhich carriers are inserted into the tube. In the Philadelphia postal\r\nline this apparatus consisted of a large valve, operated by hand. For\r\nan eight-inch tube such a valve would be too large and heavy to be\r\nmanually operated. Furthermore, that type of apparatus is not suited\r\nto an intermediate station, where carriers have to pass through it. To\r\nmeet all of these requirements we have designed an apparatus, of which\r\nFig. 27 is a side elevation, Fig. 28 a longitudinal section, and Fig.\r\n29 a cross-section. Referring to the longitudinal section, Fig. 28,\r\nthe sending apparatus is shown inserted into the line of a pneumatic\r\ntube, A, A. We have a movable section of tube, B, that can be swung\r\nabout the large bolt, G, at the top, into and out of line with the main\r\ntube, A, A. When the section of tube B is being swung to one side, the\r\nair-current has a by-pass through the slots E and F and the U-shaped\r\npipe D. The joints at the ends of the movable section B are packed with\r\nspecially-formed leathers. Referring to the cross-section, Fig. 29,\r\nwhen the movable section of tube B is swung out of line with the main\r\ntube, another and similar tube, C, takes its place. The two movable\r\ntubes, B and C, are made in one piece, so that they must always move\r\ntogether. They are connected together at each end by plates, M, that\r\nserve not only as connecting-plates, but covers for the ends of the\r\nmain-line tube while the tubes B and C are being moved. The tubes B\r\nand C swing between four plates or wings, L, that extend out on each\r\nside of the apparatus. They serve as guards, and, at certain positions\r\nof the swinging tubes, prevent the air from escaping.\r\n\r\nWe will, for convenience, call the system of swinging tubes B and C,\r\nwith their supports, etc., the swing-frame or simply the frame. This\r\nframe is moved or swung from one position to the other by means of a\r\ncylinder and piston, H, placed in an inclined position under it. A lug,\r\nN, is cast on the tube B, to which the connecting-rod, O, is attached.\r\nThe cross-head, P, slides upon an inclined guide, Q. On top of the\r\ncylinder is placed a controlling valve, made in the form of a piston\r\nslide-valve. The piston in the cylinder H is moved by the pressure of\r\nthe air taken from the main tube through the pipe I. The apparatus is\r\noperated by a hand-lever, K. When this lever is pulled, it moves the\r\nsliding-head R, and this, through the spring S, moves the controlling\r\nvalve, if the valve is not locked. If it is locked, pulling the lever\r\nsimply compresses the spring S. When the controlling valve is moved to\r\nthe right the air in the cylinder H escapes through the passage V and\r\nthe port J to the atmosphere, and compressed air from the main tube\r\nflows through the pipe I, the passages T and U, to the cylinder H,\r\nunder the piston, causing the piston to move up the inclined cylinder\r\nand swing the frame until the tube C is in line with the main tube.\r\nCarriers are despatched by placing them in the tube C, then pulling\r\nthe lever K, and swinging the frame until the tube C is in line with\r\nthe main tube. The carrier is then taken up and carried along by the\r\ncurrent of air in the main tube.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.\r\n\r\nSENDING APPARATUS.—CROSS-SECTION.]\r\n\r\nReplacing the hand-lever K in its original position returns the frame\r\nto its normal position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.\r\n\r\nSENDING TIME-LOCK.]\r\n\r\n=Sending Time-Lock.=—In any system of large pneumatic tubes a short\r\ntime should elapse between the despatching of carriers, in order that\r\nthey may not collide in the tube, and to give the receiving apparatus\r\nat the stations time to act. To insure the impossibility of having\r\ncarriers despatched too rapidly, we place on the sending apparatus a\r\ntime-lock that will automatically lock it for a determined length of\r\ntime after each carrier is despatched, the time-lock being adjustable\r\nfor any desired time. The time-lock, W, is shown attached to the\r\nsending apparatus in Fig. 27. When the swing-frame is swung to despatch\r\na carrier, it pulls up the rod X by means of a link and bell-crank, Y,\r\nthereby locking the controlling valve of the cylinder H and starting\r\nthe time-lock W, which will unlock the controlling valve after the\r\nrequired time has elapsed. The details of this time-lock are shown\r\nin Fig. 30. It consists of a long vertical cylinder, A, containing a\r\npiston, B, and a spiral spring, C, that tends to force the piston to\r\nthe bottom of the cylinder. The cylinder is filled with oil, and holes,\r\nD, in the piston allow the oil to pass freely through it when it is\r\nmoved upward in the cylinder. When the piston moves downward an annular\r\ncollar, E, forming a valve, closes the holes in the piston and prevents\r\nthe oil from passing through. Extending from one side of the piston\r\nto the other is a by-pass, F, in the wall of the cylinder. When the\r\npiston moves downward the displaced oil is forced to flow through this\r\nby-pass. A small cock, G, is arranged in the by-pass to throttle the\r\nstream of oil flowing through it. The opening in this cock, or the\r\namount of throttling, is indicated on the outside by an index and dial,\r\nZ (see Fig. 27). When the piston B is raised and allowed to descend by\r\nthe force of the spring C, it forces the oil through the by-pass F and\r\nthe cock G. If the latter is wide open the piston will descend quickly,\r\nbut if it is nearly closed the piston will descend very slowly. In\r\nother words, the time of descent can be regulated by opening and\r\nclosing the cock G. The reading on the dial Z can be made seconds of\r\ntime that elapse while the piston is descending.\r\n\r\nAbove the cylinder is a cross-head, H, that moves up and down between\r\nvertical guides. This cross-head is moved by the rod X, also shown\r\nin Fig. 27, that receives its motion from the swinging frame of the\r\nsending apparatus. A piston rod, I, attached to the piston in the\r\ncylinder, extends up through the travelling cross-head but is not\r\nattached to it. On the piston-rod are two enlargements, J and K, one\r\nmade a solid part of it, the other formed by two nuts. The travelling\r\ncross-head H carries a pawl, L, that engages under the shoulder formed\r\nby the nuts K. This pawl is kept against the piston-rod by the spring\r\nM. The enlargement, J, on the piston-rod forms a shoulder that bears\r\nagainst the bell-crank, N, that connects with the bolt, O, which locks\r\nthe controlling valve. In the present down position of the piston and\r\npiston-rod, the enlargement J, by pressing against the bell-crank N,\r\nholds the bolt O in an unlocked position. When a carrier is despatched\r\nthe cross-head H is lifted by the rod X, and carries with it the piston\r\nand piston-rod, compressing the spring C. This upward movement of the\r\npiston-rod allows the bolt O to be thrown by a spring, not shown in the\r\nfigure, and so lock the controlling valve of the sending apparatus.\r\nAs the cross-head continues its upward movement, the pawl L comes in\r\ncontact with the end of the screw P and disengages the piston-rod. This\r\nallows the piston to descend as rapidly as the oil can pass through the\r\nby-pass and cock G. When the piston has reached nearly to the bottom of\r\nthe cylinder, the shoulder J, on the piston-rod, engages the bell-crank\r\nN and withdraws the bolt O, thereby unlocking the controlling valve.\r\nThe time that the sending apparatus is locked depends upon the time\r\nrequired for the piston to descend. While the sending apparatus is\r\nlocked against the sending of another carrier, it is not so locked\r\nthat the swing-frame cannot be returned to its normal position and\r\nanother carrier inserted ready to be sent as soon as the necessary time\r\nexpires. This time is usually not more than ten seconds. Not only may\r\nthe second carrier be placed in the tube C, Fig. 29, ready to be sent,\r\nbut the handle K may be pulled and fastened in the notch _a_, thereby\r\ncompressing the spring S, which, as soon as the controlling valve is\r\nunlocked, will move the valve and automatically despatch the carrier.\r\nThe controlling valve is locked by the passage of a bolt through the\r\nhole _b_, in a block carried on the end of the valve stem, when it\r\nreturns to the normal position shown in the figure. Usually little or\r\nno time will be lost in thus locking the sending apparatus, for the\r\nsmall amount of time that the apparatus is locked will be needed in\r\nhandling the carriers.\r\n\r\n=Intermediate Station Time-Lock.=—We have another time-lock attached to\r\nthe sending apparatus that has been already referred to in describing\r\nthe “block system” used at intermediate stations; a time-lock to\r\nprevent carriers being inserted into the tube at intermediate stations\r\nwhile another carrier is passing that station. This time-lock is shown\r\nin Fig. 27 at W´, and is shown in detail by a sectional drawing, Fig.\r\n31.\r\n\r\nWhen a carrier closes an electric circuit in passing one of the boxes\r\nlocated in a manhole about three hundred feet from an intermediate\r\nstation, it indicates its approach to the station by exciting the\r\nelectro-magnet A, Fig. 31. This magnet pulls down its armature B and\r\nraises the small piston valve C, which admits compressed air to a small\r\nchamber, D. The air is supplied to this chamber from the main tube\r\nthrough the pipe E. In one end of this chamber is fitted a piston, F,\r\nheld to one end of its stroke by a spring, G. When compressed air is\r\nadmitted to the chamber D, this piston is moved to the left, and by\r\nsuch movement throws the controlling valve of the sending apparatus\r\ninto its normal position (shown in Fig. 29) and holds it there. This\r\nforms a positive lock, and, no matter in what position the sending\r\napparatus may be, it puts the tube B, Fig. 29, into line with the main\r\ntube so that the approaching carrier can pass through the apparatus.\r\nThe piston-rod H, Fig. 31, is connected to the finger _d_, Fig. 29,\r\nand by rocking this finger moves the controlling valve, or prevents it\r\nbeing moved by the handle K.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.\r\n\r\nINTERMEDIATE STATION TIME-LOCK.]\r\n\r\nReturning now to Fig. 31, we have on the top of the chamber D, in\r\naddition to the electro-magnet A and its armature B, a differential\r\ncylinder and piston, K, L, whose function is to close the valve C\r\nwhen the chamber D is filled with air. The piston K is smaller than\r\nthe piston L, and sustains a constant air-pressure, supplied through\r\nthe small pipe M M, from the pipe E, which leads to the main tube.\r\nWhen the chamber D becomes filled from the pipe E through the valve\r\nC, the pressure in the chamber moves the piston L upward against the\r\npressure on the piston K, because of the greater area of the piston\r\nL. This movement of the differential piston raises the lever I, which\r\npasses through a slot in the stem of the differential piston, and thus\r\ncloses the valve C. The air in the chamber now gradually escapes to\r\nthe atmosphere through a small orifice Q; in fact it has been escaping\r\nhere all the time while the chamber was being filled, but the opening\r\nthrough the valve C is so many times larger than the orifice Q that the\r\nescape of air was not sufficient to prevent the chamber from filling.\r\nNow, however, that all supply to the chamber is shut off, the air in\r\nthe chamber is gradually being discharged through the orifice. When\r\nnearly all the air has escaped, the piston F will return to its normal\r\nposition, shown in the figure, and unlock the controlling valve.\r\nThe time required for the air to escape from the chamber, D, is the\r\ntime that the sending apparatus will be locked, and this time can be\r\nregulated by varying the size of the orifice Q. The opening of the\r\norifice, or the time that the sending apparatus is locked, is indicated\r\nby an index and dial, P.\r\n\r\nThis locking mechanism is secured to a bracket on the side of the\r\nlarge cylinder H, Fig. 27, in a position where it can be easily\r\ninspected. The moving parts of the electro-magnetic valve—for such is\r\nthe valve C, with the magnet A, Fig. 31—are made very light, in order\r\nthat they may respond easily and quickly to the closing of the electric\r\ncircuit.\r\n\r\nIt is a disadvantage to have stations too numerous upon the same line,\r\nespecially if they do a large amount of business, for each station\r\nwill delay the sending of carriers from the others more or less, and\r\nthe interference will be greatest during the busiest hours of the\r\nday. This condition is inherent in any system of large tubes where\r\ncarriers have to be run a certain minimum distance apart, and cannot be\r\novercome by any mechanism. But the disadvantage is greatly overshadowed\r\nby the advantage of being able to connect several stations by one\r\nline, instead of having to run independent lines from each station to\r\nthe central, especially when the business of the individual stations\r\nis not sufficient to occupy a separate tube all the time. It makes\r\nit possible to have stations where otherwise the business would not\r\nwarrant the cost of installation and expense of operation. We recommend\r\nthe establishing of not more than eight stations on a line, and usually\r\na smaller number than this, depending, of course, upon the amount of\r\nbusiness to be done at each station.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.\r\n\r\nELECTRO-PNEUMATIC CIRCUIT-CLOSER.]\r\n\r\n=The Electro-Pneumatic Circuit-Closer.=—There is one piece of\r\nmechanism used in connection with the sending apparatus that we have\r\nyet to describe, and that is the circuit-closing device located in\r\nthe manholes in the street. Since the carriers travel at a high\r\nrate of speed, they should not be made to operate any mechanism by\r\nimpact with fingers or levers protruding into the tube when it can be\r\navoided, even though the work to be done is so slight as the closing\r\nof an electric circuit, for the repeated impacts cannot fail to work\r\ninjury to the carriers and the mechanism to be operated, no matter how\r\ncarefully they are designed. To avoid such impacts, we have designed\r\nthe electro-pneumatic circuit-closer, shown by the drawing in Fig. 32.\r\nIt is operated by a passing carrier, but pneumatically rather than\r\nmechanically. In the figure we have a pneumatic tube, A, A, in which a\r\ncarrier, B, is moving in the direction indicated by the arrow. At two\r\npoints, about twenty or thirty feet apart, two small holes are tapped\r\ninto the tube and pipes, C and D, are screwed in. These pipes lead to\r\ntwo chambers in a cast-iron box, F, separated by a diaphragm, E. This\r\ndiaphragm is insulated electrically from the box supporting it, and\r\nis connected with the wire G. Just out of contact with the diaphragm\r\nis an insulated screw, H, connected with the wire I. These wires lead\r\nto the time-lock, already described, on the sending apparatus at the\r\nstation. When no carrier is passing, the air-pressure is the same on\r\nboth sides of the diaphragm, but when a carrier enters that part of the\r\ntube between the two points where the pipes C and D are connected, the\r\nequality of pressure on opposite sides of the diaphragm is destroyed.\r\nThere is always a slightly greater pressure in rear of the carrier than\r\nin front of it, equal to the frictional resistance of the carrier in\r\nthe tube. It is this difference of pressure in front and in rear of\r\nthe carrier that moves it through the tube. When the carrier is in\r\nthe position shown in the figure, the same difference of pressure will\r\nexist on opposite sides of the diaphragm, and it will be deflected into\r\ncontact with the screw H, thereby closing the electric circuit. When\r\nthe carrier has passed, equality of pressure on opposite sides of the\r\ndiaphragm is established and the diaphragm takes its normal position,\r\nout of contact with the screw H. This apparatus is easily attached to\r\nthe tube, and it contains no mechanism to get out of order.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.\r\n\r\nOPEN RECEIVER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Open Receiver.=—Wherever the pressure in the tube is down nearly\r\nto atmospheric, we can use an open receiver to discharge the carriers\r\nfrom the tube. This is a receiver that opens the tube to the atmosphere\r\nand allows the carrier to come out. Such a receiver is used at the\r\nmain post-office in the Philadelphia postal-line, and was described in\r\nthe last chapter. The present receiver is similar in operation, but\r\ncontains some improvements in details. Fig. 33 is a side elevation of\r\nthe apparatus, Fig. 34 is a longitudinal section, and Fig. 35 is a\r\ncross-section through the cylinder and valve, showing the sluice-gate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.\r\n\r\nOPEN RECEIVER.—LONGITUDINAL SECTION.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.\r\n\r\nOPEN RECEIVER.—SLUICE-GATE MECHANISM.]\r\n\r\nReferring to the longitudinal section, the apparatus is attached to\r\nthe end of a pneumatic tube, A. The current of air from the tube\r\nA flows through the slots B into a pipe, C, that conducts it to a\r\ntank near the air-compressor. About the centre of the apparatus is a\r\nsluice-gate, E, that is raised and lowered by a piston in a vertical\r\ncylinder, F, located just above the sluice-gate. This piston is moved\r\nby air-pressure taken from some part of the system. When a carrier\r\narrives from the tube A, it passes over the slots B and runs into the\r\nair-cushion D, where it comes gradually to rest. Checking the\r\nmomentum of the carrier compresses the air in front of it considerably,\r\nand this excess of pressure is utilized to move a small slide-valve\r\nthat controls the movement of the piston in the cylinder F, so that as\r\nsoon as the carrier has come to rest the sluice-gate rises and allows\r\nthe carrier to be pushed out with a low velocity on to a table. The\r\nsmall pipe G conducts a small portion of the air compressed in front\r\nof the retarded carrier to the controlling valve, H, seen in Figs. 33\r\nand 35. Referring now to the section of the valve and cylinder, Fig.\r\n35, the pipe G enters the top of a small valve-cylinder containing a\r\nhemispherical piston, I, that is held up by a spiral spring, J. This\r\nspring has just sufficient tension to hold the piston I up against\r\nthe normal pressure of air in the tube. When a carrier arrives\r\nand compresses the air in the air-cushion, the excess of pressure\r\nforces the piston I down against the spring J, and moves the piston\r\nslide-valve K. This change of position of the slide-valve allows the\r\nair in the cylinder F to escape to the atmosphere through the passage\r\nL, passage P, and pipe M, while compressed air from some part of the\r\nmain tube enters through the port N and passage O to the under side of\r\nthe piston in the cylinder F. This moves the piston up, carrying with\r\nit the sluice-gate E.\r\n\r\nThere is just sufficient pressure in the tube in rear of the carrier\r\nto push the carrier past the gate and on to the table. As the carrier\r\nmoves out it raises a finger, Q, Fig. 34, that projects into its\r\npath. Raising this finger extends the spring R, Fig. 33, and rotates\r\nthe lever S, bringing the pawl T under the end of the controlling\r\nvalve-stem. When the carrier has passed out and the finger Q is free\r\nto descend, the spring R rotates the lever S back to its original\r\nposition, and thereby raises the controlling slide-valve, which causes\r\nthe sluice-gate to close. By having the upward motion of the finger Q\r\nsimply extend the spring R, and the downward motion, by the force of\r\nthe spring, move the valve, we are enabled to have several carriers\r\npass out of the tube together without having the sluice-gate close\r\nuntil the last carrier has passed out. If raising the finger Q moved\r\nthe valve, then when the first carrier passed out, the gate would close\r\ndown upon the second. Attached to the receiving apparatus and extending\r\nbeyond it is a tube, U, cut away upon one side so that the carriers can\r\nroll out of it on to a table, and having in the end a buffer to stop\r\nthe carriers if by any accident they come out of the tube with too much\r\nspeed. This buffer consists of a piston covered with several layers\r\nof leather and having a stiff spring behind it. The whole apparatus\r\nis supported from the floor upon suitable standards, and, for an\r\neight-inch tube, occupies a floor-space twelve feet long by two feet\r\nwide, not including the table.\r\n\r\nThis is the simplest form of receiving apparatus. Owing to conditions\r\nof pressure already explained, its use is confined principally to the\r\npumping stations. The only care that it requires is an occasional\r\ncleaning and oiling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.\r\n\r\nCLOSED RECEIVER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.\r\n\r\nCLOSED RECEIVER.—LONGITUDINAL SECTION.]\r\n\r\n=The Closed Receiver.=—Next we will turn our attention to the closed\r\nreceiving apparatus used at all terminal stations where the pressure in\r\nthe tube is considerably above the pressure of the atmosphere, so much\r\nso that the tube cannot be opened to allow the carrier to pass out\r\nwithout an annoying blast of air and a high velocity of the carrier.\r\nThis apparatus is similar to the receiver used in the sub-post-office\r\nof the Philadelphia postal line, but contains several modifications\r\nand improvements tending towards simplification. Fig. 36 shows it in\r\nelevation, and Fig. 37 in longitudinal section. As in the open receiver\r\njust described, the air from the tube A is deflected through slots B\r\ninto a branch pipe, C, that conducts it from the receiving apparatus\r\nto the sending apparatus and return tube. The carriers arrive from the\r\ntube A, pass over the slots B, where the air makes its exit, and run\r\ninto an air-cushion, D. This air-cushion is a tube about twice the\r\nlength of the carrier, closed at one end, and supported upon trunnions.\r\nWhen the carrier has been brought to rest, this closed section of tube\r\nis tilted by the movement of a piston in a cylinder to an angle that\r\nallows the carrier to slide out; the tube then returns to its original\r\nposition. If the end of the air-cushion was closed perfectly tight the\r\ncarrier, after coming to rest, would rebound and might be caught in the\r\njoint between the stationary and movable parts of the apparatus, when\r\nthe air-cushion tube tilted. To prevent the rebounding of the carrier a\r\nrelief-valve, E, has been placed in the head of the air-cushion tube.\r\nIt is held closed against the normal pressure in the tube by a spiral\r\nspring, but the excessive pressure created by checking the momentum of\r\nthe carrier opens the valve and allows a little air to escape through\r\nthe passage F and pipe G, down the pedestal H, to the atmosphere. When\r\nthe air-cushion or receiving tube D is tilted to discharge a carrier,\r\nthe circular plate I covers the end of the main tube. In order to\r\nprevent carriers sticking in the receiving tube when it is tilted,\r\nand to insure their prompt discharge, the pipe J is provided. In the\r\ntilted position of the receiving tube, the end of this pipe coincides\r\nwith the end of the main tube, from which it receives air to hasten\r\nthe discharge of the carrier. A check-valve, K, prevents the air from\r\nflowing backward in this pipe when a carrier is being received in the\r\nair-cushion chamber. The opening of this check-valve can be adjusted by\r\na screw, thereby regulating the speed of ejection of the carrier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.\r\n\r\nINTERMEDIATE STATION RECEIVING AND TRANSFER APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.\r\n\r\nINTERMEDIATE STATION RECEIVING AND TRANSFER APPARATUS.—VERTICAL\r\nSECTION.]\r\n\r\nThe carrier is discharged down a chute, L, which has a buffer at the\r\nbottom, and from the chute it rolls off on to a table. The buffer is\r\nmade similar to the buffer in the open receiver already described.\r\nThe cylinder and piston M, that operate to tilt the receiving tube D,\r\nare supported upon the base of the apparatus under the closed end of\r\nthe receiving tube. The cross-head of the piston- and connecting-rods\r\ntravels between guides that are made a part of the upper cylinder\r\nhead. The movement of the piston in the cylinder M is controlled by\r\na piston slide-valve exactly similar to the one shown in Fig. 35.\r\nThe slide-valve is moved, in the same manner, by the air compressed\r\nahead of the carrier when it is brought to rest in the air-cushion\r\nD. The air is conducted from the air-cushion to the controlling\r\nslide-valve through a small pipe, N, Fig. 36. This pipe leads to one\r\nof the trunnions, where it has a joint to allow for the tilting of\r\nthe receiving tube. When the carrier is discharged from the receiving\r\ntube, it raises a finger, O, Fig. 37, located just outside the tube.\r\nRaising this finger pulls the rod P, Fig. 36, extends the spring\r\nQ, turns the lever R, and catches the pawl S, under the end of the\r\ncontrolling valve stem. When the carrier has passed down the chute and\r\nallowed the finger O to drop down, the spring Q turns the lever R back\r\nto its original position and moves the controlling valve. This causes\r\nthe receiving tube to return to a horizontal position, where it is\r\nready to receive the next carrier.\r\n\r\nAt first this apparatus may seem a little cumbersome, but nothing could\r\nwork better. It is certain in its action and almost noiseless. Carriers\r\nare received, discharged, and the receiving tube returned to its normal\r\nposition in four seconds, and it can be done in less time if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Intermediate Station Receiving and Transfer Apparatus.=—One other\r\nform of receiving apparatus remains to be described, and this is the\r\napparatus used at intermediate stations to intercept all carriers\r\nintended for that station and to send the others on through the tube\r\nto the next station. A side elevation of the apparatus is shown in\r\nFig. 38 and a vertical section in Fig. 39. The tubes are led into an\r\nintermediate station, carried upward, and then, with a bend of one\r\nhundred and eighty degrees, are connected to the top of the receiving\r\nand transfer apparatus, as shown in the diagram, Fig. 26. The object of\r\nthis arrangement will be seen as we describe the apparatus. Referring\r\nto the sectional drawing, Fig. 39, the connection of the tube A is seen\r\nat the top. As in the other receivers, the current of air arriving\r\nfrom the tube A is deflected through slots, B, into a passage, C, made\r\nin the frame of the apparatus. From this passage it enters the tube D\r\nthrough the slots E. The tube D leads to the sending apparatus and\r\non to the next station, as seen in Fig. 26. The carriers are received\r\nin a closed section of tube F, which forms an air-cushion, similar to\r\nthe closed receiver last described. This receiving tube F is made a\r\npart of what we might term a wheel. This wheel fits accurately into a\r\ncircular casing and is supported by two trunnions or axles, upon which\r\nit revolves. The wheel has a broad flat rim, G, that covers the end of\r\nthe tube at H when the wheel is revolved, and, in the normal position\r\nin which it is shown in the figure, covers the interior openings I, J,\r\nK, and L, in the casing. Leather packing is provided around each of the\r\nopenings to prevent the escape of air between the face of the wheel\r\nand the interior face of the casing. From the bottom of the receiving\r\ntube F a passage, M, leads past a check-valve, N, to the tube D. When\r\na carrier arrives from the tube A, it descends into the receiving tube\r\nF, compressing the air in front of it. This compressed air begins to\r\nescape through the passage M, but the high velocity of it closes the\r\ncheck-valve N as much as possible. A stop on the stem of the valve\r\nprevents it being closed entirely. The small opening past the valve\r\nallows some of the air to pass, thereby preventing the carrier from\r\nrebounding on the air-cushion. As soon as the carrier has come to rest,\r\nthe check-valve N, by its own weight, opens wide, and the carrier, by\r\nits weight, settles gradually down to the bottom of the receiving tube.\r\nThe wheel containing the receiving tube and the carrier will then be\r\nrevolved by the cylinder and piston O, which is operated by compressed\r\nair taken from the tube through the pipe P. If the carrier is for this\r\nstation, the wheel will rotate through an angle of forty-five degrees\r\nand discharge the carrier through the opening J, down the chute Q, from\r\nwhich it will roll on to a table arranged to receive it. If, however,\r\nthe carrier is intended for some other station, the wheel will rotate\r\nthrough an angle of ninety degrees and discharge the carrier through\r\nthe opening K into the tube D, and it will go on its way to the next\r\nstation. This selection of carriers is brought about in a comparatively\r\nsimple manner. At the bottom of the receiving tube F there are two\r\nvertical needles, R and S, shown upon a larger scale in Fig. 40. The\r\nneedles R and S are contained in tubes having an insulating lining\r\nwhich keeps them out of electrical contact with the frame of the\r\napparatus. Wires _a_ and _b_ make connection with the needles through\r\nmetal plugs that form a guide for the needles, and through the springs\r\nU and V. Directly below the needle R is an insulated spring clip, W,\r\nheld by two bolts and connected to the wire _e_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.\r\n\r\nA DETAIL OF THE INTERMEDIATE STATION RECEIVING AND TRANSFER APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\nThe end of a carrier is represented at T. As the carrier settles down\r\nto the bottom of the receiving tube, it comes in contact with the\r\nends of the needles and presses them down, they being supported by\r\ntwo springs U and V. As the needle R is moved down, it makes contact\r\nwith the spring clip W, located just below it, and closes an electric\r\ncircuit that includes the electro-magnet X, Figs. 38 and 39, on the\r\nvalve of the rotating cylinder O. When this electro-magnet is excited\r\nit attracts its armature and moves the piston slide-valve Y, that\r\nadmits air to the top of the piston in the cylinder O, and allows the\r\nair under the piston to escape to the atmosphere. The piston moves\r\ndownward and revolves the wheel by means of a connecting rod.\r\n\r\nUpon the end of the carrier T is placed a thin circular metal disk,\r\n_f_, which may be copper, brass, tin-plate or any metal that is not\r\neasily oxidized. The diameter of this disk of metal determines the\r\nstation at which the carrier will be discharged from the tube. Disks of\r\nvarious diameters, that may be attached to the carrier, are represented\r\nby dashed lines, _g_, in Fig. 40. When the carrier comes in contact\r\nwith the two needles R and S, if the circular metal disk on the front\r\nend of the carrier has a diameter sufficient to span the space between\r\nthe two needles, in the position in which it is held, then an electric\r\ncircuit, made by the wires _a_ and _b_, will be closed through the\r\nneedles and the metal disk on the carrier. The metal disk makes a\r\nshort-circuit from one needle to the other. If the metal disk is not\r\nlarge enough to span the distance between the two needles, then the\r\nelectric circuit remains broken.\r\n\r\nReturning again to Fig. 39, we have the opening J, where the carriers\r\nare discharged, closed by a sluice-gate. This gate is opened and\r\nclosed by a piston moving in a cylinder, _h_, shown in Fig. 38. A\r\npiston slide-valve, _i_, similar in all respects to the valve on the\r\ncylinder O, controls the movement of the piston in this cylinder and\r\nthe sluice-gate to which it is attached. The slide-valve is moved in\r\none direction, that opens the sluice-gate, by an electro-magnet in the\r\ncircuit of the wires _a_ and _b_, Fig. 40.\r\n\r\nWhen the electric circuit made by these wires is closed by a disk\r\non the front end of a carrier, short-circuiting the two needles,\r\nthe valve is moved by the electro-magnet in the circuit, and the\r\nsluice-gate is opened. As the wheel, including the receiving tube and\r\ncarrier, revolves, a lug, _j_, Fig. 38, on the outside of the wheel\r\ncomes in contact with the open sluice-gate and the wheel can rotate\r\nno farther. A blast of air through the valve L, Fig. 39, assisted by\r\ngravity, pushes the carrier out of the receiving tube, through the\r\nopening J and down the chute Q, on to the receiving table.\r\n\r\nHad the disk on the front end of the carrier been too small to span\r\nthe distance between the two needles, the circuit would not have been\r\nclosed, the sluice-gate would not have been opened, no obstruction\r\nwould have been placed in the path of the lug _j_, on the wheel, and\r\nthe wheel would have continued its rotation through ninety degrees\r\nuntil the receiving tube F came in line with the tube D. During the\r\nlatter part of the rotation, a pin on the wheel engages a lever, _k_,\r\nFig. 38, and turns a valve, _l_, Fig. 39, stopping the flow of air\r\nthrough the passage C, compelling it to take another route through\r\nthe passage _m_, and the receiving tube F, taking with it the carrier\r\ninto the tube D. When the carrier leaves the receiving tube and passes\r\nthrough either of the openings J or K, it engages one of the fingers,\r\n_n_ or _o_, that lie in its path. These fingers are connected by rods\r\nand levers to the valves on the rotating and sluice-gate cylinders.\r\nThe ejected carrier pushes these fingers to one side, and after it has\r\npassed the fingers return, by the force of a spring, to their former\r\nposition and move the valves, causing the sluice-gate to close and the\r\nwheel to rotate backward into its normal position ready to receive\r\nthe next carrier. The connection between the fingers and the valves is\r\nsimilar to the mechanism on the open and closed receivers, so need not\r\nbe described in detail here.\r\n\r\nThe speed with which the carriers are ejected from the receiving tube\r\nthrough the opening J and down the chute Q is regulated by the valve\r\nL, which can be opened or closed by a hand-wheel, _p_. Before the\r\nwheel and receiving tube can be rotated, the needles must be withdrawn\r\nfrom the receiving tube, and this is accomplished by a small cylinder\r\nand piston, _q_, shown in Fig. 40. The needles and their encasement\r\nare attached to a cross-head, _r_, on the end of a hollow piston-rod,\r\n_s_. When air is admitted to the top of the piston in the rotating\r\ncylinder O, Fig. 39, it is also admitted through the pipe _t_, Fig.\r\n38, to the cylinder and upper side of the piston _q_, Fig. 40. This\r\nmoves the piston _q_ down against the force of a spring, _u_, and\r\nwithdraws the needles from the receiving tube. This takes place after\r\nthe needles have served their purpose and before the wheel is rotated.\r\nThe piston _q_ has much less inertia than the wheel, therefore it\r\nmoves much quicker. When the wheel begins to rotate it closes a valve,\r\n_v_, in the pipe _t_, Fig. 38, confining the air in the cylinder _q_,\r\nand preventing the needles from being raised by the spring _u_ before\r\nthe wheel returns to its normal position. If by any accident the\r\nneedles should be raised, no serious harm would result, for their ends\r\nwould simply bear against the face of the wheel. If this took place\r\nconstantly, grooves might be worn in the face of the wheel; for this\r\nreason the valve _v_ is provided.\r\n\r\nIn order to facilitate the inspection of the needles and electric\r\ncontact springs W, they are contained in a cylindrical brass case,\r\n_w_, that is held in place beneath the receiving tube by two bolts. By\r\nremoving the nuts from these bolts the entire mechanism can be removed,\r\nexamined, and cleaned. It also gives easy access to the receiving tube.\r\nThe receiving tube is long enough to receive two carriers, if it should\r\never happen that two arrive at the same time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.\r\n\r\nDIAGRAM OF CONTACT-DISKS AND NEEDLES.]\r\n\r\nTo show how the apparatus at the various stations is arranged to\r\ncorrespond with the disks of various sizes attached to the front of the\r\ncarriers, a diagram, Fig. 41, has been made, in which the needles at\r\nthe bottom of the receiving tubes of the apparatus at six intermediate\r\nstations are represented at A, B, C, D, E, and F. Six disks of\r\ndifferent sizes are represented at _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, _e_, and _f_.\r\nThe needles are placed farthest apart at station A and nearer together\r\nat each succeeding station until we arrive at station F, where they\r\nare nearest together. If we wish to send a carrier to station A from\r\nthe central, we place the largest disk, _a_, upon the front end of it.\r\nWhen it arrives at station A, it closes the electric circuit between\r\nthe needles and is discharged from the tube. Should we wish to send a\r\ncarrier to station D, then we place the disk _d_ upon the front end of\r\nit. When the carrier arrives at the station A, the disk is not large\r\nenough to span the needles; therefore the sluice-gate is not opened\r\nand the carrier is sent on in the tube. When it arrives at stations\r\nB and C, the same thing occurs again, but when it reaches station D,\r\nthe needles are sufficiently close together so that the disk makes an\r\nelectric circuit between them, and the carrier is discharged from the\r\ntube, as was intended when despatched. Since the carriers always travel\r\nin the same direction in a tube, the first station at which they arrive\r\nwhere the needles are near enough together to have both touch the disk,\r\nwill be the station at which the carrier was intended to stop. Carriers\r\ncan be despatched from any station, but if we wish to send from say D\r\nto A, they must either travel around a loop or be sent through a return\r\ntube in which the needles are arranged in the reverse order. If no disk\r\nis placed on the carrier, it will go to the last station on the line.\r\n\r\nThere are other attachments that might be made to the front end of\r\nthe carriers in order to have them stop at any desired station along\r\na line. We have worked out two other systems which are entirely\r\nmechanical in their operation, not using electric circuits and\r\nelectro-magnets to move the valves. While such a mechanical system has\r\nsome advantages over the present combined mechanical and electrical\r\nsystem, yet there is one great advantage in the latter, and that is the\r\nsimplicity of the attachment made to the carrier. A round flat disk of\r\ntin-plate is attached to the front end; it is something that is not\r\nin the way; it does not prevent standing the carriers on end in racks\r\nto fill them; it is not easily injured, and only those who have had\r\nexperience can realize the rough usage that the carriers receive; it\r\nis quickly and easily attached to the carrier, and it is so cheap that\r\nwhen bent it can be thrown away.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Carriers.=—The carriers are similar in all respects to those used in\r\nthe Philadelphia postal-line, that have been described in the preceding\r\nchapter and illustrated in Figs. 18, 19, and 20. When there are\r\nintermediate stations upon the lines, means are provided for attaching\r\ndisks to the front end of the carriers. The disks have a central stem\r\nthat secures them to the bolt in the centre of the head, and are so\r\narranged that they can be quickly attached or removed.\r\n\r\nMany experiments have been made to find the best material for\r\nbearing-rings, but thus far nothing better than a specially-prepared\r\nwoven fabric has been found. These rings will run about a thousand\r\nmiles, when they become so reduced in diameter that they have to be\r\nreplaced by new ones.\r\n\r\nThe most essential elements of a carrier are strength, lightness, and\r\nsecurity of the contents. Aluminum has frequently been proposed as a\r\nsuitable material for the bodies of carriers, but for the same weight\r\nsteel is much stronger, especially in thin rolled sheets, and for this\r\nreason it has been used.\r\n\r\nOne of the most perplexing problems that presented itself in working\r\nout the details of the system was to design a secure and reliable lock\r\nfor the lids of the carriers. We believe that the one which has been\r\nadopted fulfils all requirements in a satisfactory manner.\r\n\r\nSome experiments have been made with carriers that open on the side,\r\nbut structurally they are weak and unsuited to stand the blows that\r\ncarriers frequently receive. They are not so easily and quickly filled\r\nand emptied as those that open on the end. These remarks apply to\r\ncarriers for large tubes. In small tubes for the transportation of cash\r\nin retail stores, carriers with side openings are found convenient.\r\n\r\nWhen United States mail is sent through tubes not used exclusively for\r\npostal service, carriers with special locks can be used, so that they\r\ncan be opened only by post-office employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Air Supply.=—This completes the description of the special apparatus\r\nused in this system, but we have yet to say something regarding the\r\nmachines that supply the air. In Paris the water from the city mains\r\nhas been used to compress or exhaust the air used in small tubes,\r\nbut to operate large tubes in most of our cities steam is the only\r\navailable power. Except in isolated cases, an independent steam plant\r\nwill be erected to supply the air for a system of tubes. This plant\r\nshould be designed with a view to obtaining the maximum economy in coal\r\nconsumption, labor, water, cartage, and incidental expenses. We might\r\nsay that the same general rules of economy which govern the design and\r\nconstruction of electric-lighting plants should be applied to the plans\r\nand construction of air-compressing plants.\r\n\r\nThree types of blowing machines are used,—viz., centrifugal fans,\r\npositive blowers, and air-compressors.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fans.=—Very large tubes of moderate length can be operated by ordinary\r\ncentrifugal fans. These fans are capable of supplying air under a\r\npressure not exceeding ten or twelve ounces per square inch with very\r\ngood efficiency. They are the simplest and most inexpensive of all\r\nblowing-machines.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Blowers.=—When tubes have a length and diameter that require a\r\npressure from one to four pounds per square inch, some form of positive\r\nblower of the Root type can be used with economy. Their construction\r\nis familiar to nearly every one at all interested in machinery, so we\r\nneed give no space to their description here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.\r\n\r\nTHE STURTEVANT STEEL PRESSURE BLOWER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.\r\n\r\nROOT’S POSITIVE PRESSURE BLOWER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.\r\n\r\nSECTION OF ROOT’S TRUE CIRCLE BLOWER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.\r\n\r\nTHE GREEN BLOWER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.\r\n\r\nSECTION OF THE GREEN BLOWER.]\r\n\r\n=Air-Compressors.=—By far the greater number of our tubes require an\r\nair-pressure of more than five pounds per square inch. For such air\r\nsupply we recommend some form of air-compressor, and usually this is\r\ndriven by a steam-engine, which forms a part of the compressor. In\r\nmaking our selection we should bear in mind the conditions under which\r\nthe compressor will run. Usually it must be kept in constant operation\r\nat least ten hours per day, and frequently for a much longer period.\r\nThis makes it important that the compressor be substantially built\r\nand supported upon a solid and firm foundation. The bearings should\r\nbe broad, of good wearing material that has a low coefficient of\r\nfriction, and provided at all times with ample lubrication. If poppet\r\nvalves are used in the air-cylinders, and they are most common, the\r\nspeed in revolutions per minute should not be high. Duplex are better\r\nthan single cylinder compressors, because they deliver the air in a\r\nmore steady stream,—the pulsations are less. For constant running,\r\neconomy of steam is an important item; therefore some good type of\r\ncut-off valve should be provided. The air-cylinders should not be\r\nwater-jacketed unless the pressure is above twenty-five pounds per\r\nsquare inch. It is better to use the air as warm as possible, for it\r\nwill soon be cooled after entering the tube. A speed-governor should\r\nbe provided with compressors which are to run at constant speed, but\r\nusually they will be run to maintain a constant pressure in the tank,\r\nand to this end a good and reliable form of pressure-governor should\r\nbe provided, together with some reliable safety device to stop the\r\nengine when the speed exceeds a safe limit. But most important of all\r\nis to have the valves of the air-cylinders large in area; otherwise\r\nthe efficiency of the machine will be very low. With machines working\r\nunder eighty pounds pressure, a difference in pressure of one pound\r\non opposite sides of the valves has but little effect, but when\r\nthe machine is only compressing to five or ten pounds, one pound\r\nis a very large proportion of the total pressure and reduces the\r\nefficiency. Besides these few suggestions, only the requirements of\r\ngood engineering need be demanded. In Figs. 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, and\r\n47 we show a fan, two blowers, and an air-compressor suited to the\r\nrequirements of pneumatic-tube service that can be found in the market,\r\nand that are built by responsible concerns. We believe they are all\r\ngood of their kind, but do not recommend any particular make.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Tube, Line Construction, etc.=—Up to the present time we have\r\nfound no material better suited for the straight parts of pneumatic\r\ntubes than cast iron, machined upon the interior. It gives a smooth and\r\naccurate tube. It can be made in most convenient lengths. It is strong\r\nand not easily deformed. The bell-joint, calked with lead and oakum,\r\nhaving the tubes fitted together male and female at the bottom of the\r\nbell, is the best joint yet devised for pneumatic tubes. It is slightly\r\nyielding, accommodating itself to slight changes of length of tube\r\ndue to changes of temperature, and it allows slight bends to be made\r\nat each joint. The joints are very accurate, presenting no shoulders\r\nto obstruct the passage of carriers. The joints can be made by men\r\naccustomed to laying water- and gas-pipe. The cast iron is so stiff\r\nthat it is not distorted in calking, as may be done with wrought-iron\r\ntube. The principal objections to its use are the expense of boring and\r\nthe readiness with which it corrodes upon the interior.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.\r\n\r\nRAND COMPOUND COMPRESSOR OF MODERATE SIZE.]\r\n\r\nWe are always hoping that wrought-iron or steel tubes will be so much\r\nimproved in uniformity of dimensions and smoothness of interior that we\r\ncan use them, but our experiments thus far have been discouraging. It\r\nmay be that some of the new processes of making tubes will give us\r\nwhat we want, but we have not yet found it.\r\n\r\nSmall tubes and the short bends of large tubes are made of brass, it\r\nbeing the most suitable material. It would be very difficult to bend\r\niron tubes without involving great expense. The thickness of the bent\r\nportion of an eight-inch tube is usually three-sixteenths of an inch\r\nand never less than one-eighth of an inch.\r\n\r\nWhere the ground is firm, no other support is needed for the tubes\r\nthan to tamp the earth solidly about them. In order to economize space\r\nin the streets, it is customary to lay the tubes one above the other;\r\nand it is very convenient, although not necessary, to separate them by\r\ncast-iron saddle brackets. Such an arrangement has to be frequently\r\ndeparted from in order to overcome obstructions in the streets and to\r\nget through narrow passages. At all low points in a tube line, traps\r\nare provided to catch any moisture that may accumulate. These traps\r\nare made accessible for frequent inspection by means of man-holes\r\nor otherwise. The tube is usually laid about three feet below the\r\npavement. This distance has frequently to be varied, but it never\r\nbecomes so small as to render the tubes liable to injury from heavy\r\ntrucks passing over the pavement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nFACTS AND GENERAL INFORMATION RELATING TO PNEUMATIC TUBES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now discuss, in an elementary way, the theory of pneumatic\r\ntubes, in order to understand more clearly their _modus operandi_ and\r\nthe principles upon which they should be constructed. Let us begin with\r\nthe definition of a pneumatic tube.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Definitions.=—A pneumatic tube is a tube containing air. This is\r\nperhaps the broadest and most comprehensive definition that can be\r\ngiven, but we usually associate with the idea of a pneumatic tube\r\nthe use to which it is put. If we were to embody this idea in our\r\ndefinition we might define a pneumatic tube as a tube through which\r\nmaterial is sent by means of a current of air. This is still a very\r\nbroad definition, including all kinds of material for transportation,\r\nfor every conceivable purpose. It places no limit upon the dimensions\r\nof the tube nor the manner of its operation. This definition would\r\ninclude the toy commonly known as a putty-blower, and the pneumatic gun.\r\n\r\nThese instruments are not usually pictured in our minds when we hear\r\nor see the term pneumatic tube used. Instead of these, we think of\r\nthe brass tubes that we have seen in the large retail stores in some\r\nof our cities for conveying cash from the various counters to the\r\ncentrally located cashier’s desk. Again narrowing our definition to\r\nconform more nearly with the mental picture presented, we will define a\r\npneumatic tube as a long tube for the purpose of transporting material\r\nin carriers by means of a current of air in the tube. This, like all\r\ndefinitions, is not entirely satisfactory, if we examine it critically,\r\nbut it will answer our present purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Intermittent and Constant Air-Current.=—Having thus defined a\r\npneumatic tube, there are two ways in which we may operate it to\r\ntransport our carriers containing mail, packages, or other matter. The\r\nfirst method consists in storing our compressed air in a suitable tank,\r\nor by exhausting the air from the tank; then, when we wish to despatch\r\na carrier we place it in the tube and connect the tube with the tank by\r\nopening a valve. As soon as the carrier arrives at the distant end of\r\nthe tube the valve is closed and the air soon ceases to flow. When a\r\nlong interval of time elapses between the despatching of carriers, this\r\nis the most economical method of operation, but usually carriers have\r\nto be despatched so frequently that a great deal of time would be lost\r\nif the air-current had to be started and stopped for each carrier.\r\n\r\nThe second and more usual method of operation consists in maintaining a\r\nconstant current of air in the tube and in having the carriers inserted\r\nand ejected at the ends of the tube without stopping the current of air\r\nfor any appreciable length of time. It is analogous to launching boats\r\nin a rapidly flowing stream, allowing them to float down stream and\r\nthen withdrawing them. When the boats are in the stream they present\r\nlittle obstruction to the flow of water and check its speed but very\r\nlittle. In order to compute the speed with which the boat will pass\r\nfrom one point to another, we only have to know the speed of the stream\r\nbetween those points when no boat is in it. The presence of the boat\r\ndoes not change the speed appreciably. So it is with carriers in a\r\npneumatic tube: they are carried along with the current of air. The air\r\nflows nearly as rapidly when a carrier is in the tube as when there\r\nis none. The friction of the carrier against the inner surface of the\r\ntube creates a slight drag, but it checks the speed of the air only a\r\nlittle. Therefore, in order to know the speed with which a carrier will\r\nbe transported from one station to another through a pneumatic tube,\r\nwe need only to know the velocity with which the air flows through the\r\ntube when no carrier is present. Of course there are special cases of\r\nheavy carriers, or carriers having a large amount of friction from\r\ntheir packing, or of tubes not laid horizontally, where the resistance\r\nof the carrier must be taken into consideration, but for our present\r\npurpose we will neglect all of these conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Laws Governing the Flow of Air in Long Tubes.=—This leads us to study\r\nthe laws governing the flow of air in long tubes, omitting for the\r\npresent the presence of a carrier. Since tubes operated intermittently\r\nhave become obsolete, we will only consider the case of a constant\r\ncurrent of air, this being what we have to deal with in practice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.\r\n\r\nPRESSURE AND VELOCITY CURVES.]\r\n\r\nIn order to make our ideas and thoughts as clear as possible let us\r\nrepresent them by a diagram, Fig. 48. We will suppose that a tank, A,\r\nis kept constantly filled with compressed air at a pressure of ten\r\npounds per square inch, from some source of supply. We will suppose\r\nthat the pressure of the air in this tank never changes, air being\r\nsupplied as fast as it flows away. Next, let us assume that a tube\r\neight inches in diameter inside and one mile long (five thousand two\r\nhundred and eighty feet) is connected to the tank at one end and left\r\nopen to the atmosphere at the other. The air will flow in a constant\r\nstream from the tank into the atmosphere, for the reason that air is\r\nbeing supplied to the tank as fast as it flows away.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Law of Pressure.=—First, let us consider the pressure of the air at\r\nvarious points in the tube. We will, for convenience, represent the\r\npressure in the tank by a vertical line, D E, ten units in length,\r\nsince the pressure is ten pounds per square inch. Now let us go to a\r\npoint on the tube one quarter of a mile (one thousand three hundred\r\nand twenty feet) from the tank, drill a hole in the tube, attach a\r\npressure-gauge and measure the pressure of the air at this point.\r\nWe shall find it to be about 7.91 pounds per square inch; or, 2.09\r\npounds below the pressure in the tank. We will represent this on our\r\ndiagram by another vertical line, F G, having a length of 7.91 units.\r\nAgain let us measure the pressure in the tube at a point one-half a\r\nmile (two thousand six hundred and forty feet) from the tank. Here we\r\nfind it to be about 5.61 pounds per square inch, and we represent it\r\nby the vertical line, H I, having 5.61 units of length. We note that\r\nthe pressure is 4.39 pounds below the pressure in the tank. We are at\r\nthe middle point of the tube and the pressure has fallen to nearly,\r\nbut not quite, one-half the pressure in the tank. We will now go to\r\na point three-quarters of a mile (three thousand nine hundred and\r\nsixty feet) from the tank, and here the pressure is about 3.01 pounds\r\nper square inch. We represent it by the vertical line, J K. Lastly,\r\nwe measure the pressure very near the end of the tube, one mile from\r\nthe tank, and find it to be about zero, or the same as the pressure of\r\nthe atmosphere. All of our measurements have been in pounds above the\r\natmospheric pressure; to express them in absolute pressure, we should\r\nadd to each the pressure of the atmosphere, which is 14.69 pounds,\r\nnearly.\r\n\r\nNow we will draw a smooth curve through the tops of all our vertical\r\nlines, and we have a curve, E, G, I, K, L, representing the pressure in\r\nthe tube at every point. It falls gradually from ten pounds to zero,\r\nbut it does not fall in exact proportion to the distance from the tank.\r\nSuch a fall of pressure would be represented by the straight dash-line,\r\nE, L. The reason why the true pressure-curve is not a straight line,\r\nand lies above a straight line, is because air is an elastic fluid and\r\nexpands, becoming larger in volume as the pressure diminishes. The\r\nstraight dash-line represents the fall of pressure of an inelastic\r\nfluid, like water, when flowing in the tube.\r\n\r\nThe fall of pressure along the tube is analogous to the fall of level\r\nalong a flowing stream. In fact, we frequently speak of the descent of\r\na stream as the “head of water” when it is used for power purposes,\r\nand we mean by this the pressure the water would exert if it were\r\nconfined in a pipe. The descent, or change of level, in the bed of a\r\nstream is necessary to keep the water flowing against the friction of\r\nthe banks. The descent of the water imparts energy to overcome the\r\nfriction. In a similar manner, we must have a fall of pressure along\r\nthe pneumatic tube to overcome the friction of the air against the\r\ninterior surface of the tube. We find another analogue in the flow of\r\nthe electric current along a wire; here there is a fall of potential\r\nnecessary to overcome the resistance of the wire. Since power has to be\r\nexpended to compress the air and impart to it its pressure, when this\r\npressure disappears we know that the air must be losing its energy or\r\ndoing work, and we look to see what becomes of it. In the present case,\r\nwe find that most of this work is expended in overcoming the friction\r\nbetween the air and the surface of the tube.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Uses of Pressure Curves.=—The pressure curve teaches us many\r\nthings. Suppose we were to establish stations on this tube at the\r\nquarter, half, three-quarter, and mile points; we see at once that\r\nintermediate-station or closed receivers, described in the last\r\nchapter, must be used at all of the stations except the mile point at\r\nthe end of the tube, because the pressure in the tube is so high above\r\nthe pressure of the atmosphere that we could not open the tube to let\r\nthe carriers come out, but at the end of the tube we could use the open\r\nreceiver. In designing our sending and receiving apparatus for each\r\nstation, we look to this pressure curve to tell us the pressure which\r\nwe shall have on the pistons in our cylinders, and are thereby enabled\r\nto make them with proper proportions for the work that they have to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Law of Velocity.=—Next let us see what the velocity of the air is\r\nin the tube. Suppose that we have some convenient means of measuring\r\nthe velocity of the air at any point, in feet per second or miles\r\nper hour, with some form of anemometer. We will have our measurements\r\ntaken at the five points where we measured the pressure,—viz., at the\r\ntank, one-quarter, one-half, three-quarters and one mile from the\r\ntank. We will represent the velocities by a diagram similar to the\r\none used for pressures. At the tank we find the air entering the tube\r\nwith a velocity of 59.5 feet per second (40.6 miles per hour). We draw\r\nthe vertical line M N, to represent this. At the quarter mile point\r\nthe velocity is sixty-five feet per second (44.4 miles per hour) an\r\nincrease in the first quarter of a mile of 5.5 feet per second. We\r\nconstruct the vertical line O P. At the half-mile point the velocity is\r\n72.4 feet per second (49.4 miles per hour); at the three-quarter mile\r\npoint it is eighty-three feet per second (56.8 miles per hour); and at\r\nthe end of the tube, one mile from the tank, the air comes out of the\r\ntube with a velocity of 100.4 feet per second (68.5 miles per hour),\r\nabout 1.7 times faster than it entered the tube at the tank. Drawing\r\nall the vertical lines to represent these velocities, and drawing a\r\nsmooth curve line through the tops of our vertical lines, we have the\r\ncurve of velocities, N, P, R, T, V, for all points along the tube. It\r\nis an increasing velocity and increases more rapidly as we approach the\r\nend of the tube. This is shown more clearly by drawing the straight\r\ndashed line N V.\r\n\r\nIf the fluid flowing in the tube were inelastic, like water, then the\r\ncurve of velocities would be a straight horizontal line, for the water\r\nwould not come out of the tube any faster than it went in. But we are\r\ndealing with air, which is an elastic fluid, and, as we stated before,\r\nit expands as the pressure is reduced and becomes larger in volume.\r\nIt is this expansion that increases its velocity as it flows along the\r\ntube. It must go faster and faster to make room to expand. Since the\r\nsame actual quantity of air in pounds must come out of the tube each\r\nminute as enters the tube at the other end in the same time, to prevent\r\nan accumulation of air in the tube, and since it increases in volume as\r\nit flows through the tube, it follows that its velocity must increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Characteristics of the Velocity Curve.=—This velocity curve is both\r\ninteresting and surprising, if we have not given the subject any\r\nprevious thought. It might occur to us that the air expands in volume\r\nin the tube, and we might reason from this fact that the velocity of\r\nthe air would increase as it flowed through the tube, but very few of\r\nus would be able to see that the rate of increase of velocity also\r\nincreases. That is to say, it gains in velocity more rapidly as it\r\napproaches the open end of the tube. If the velocity were represented\r\non the diagram by a straight horizontal line, we should know that it\r\nwas constant in all parts of the tube, which would be the case if water\r\nwere flowing instead of air. If it were represented by a straight\r\ninclined line, like the dashed line N V, then we should know that\r\nthe velocity increased as the air flowed along the tube, but that it\r\nincreased at a uniform rate. The slope of the line would indicate the\r\nrate of increase. Neither of these suppositions represent correctly\r\nthe velocity of the air at all points in the tube; this can only be\r\ndone by a curved line such as we have shown. The slope of the curve at\r\nany point represents the rate of increase of velocity of the air at\r\nthat point. If the curve is nearly horizontal, then we know that the\r\nvelocity does not increase much; but if the curve is steep, then we\r\nknow that it is increasing rapidly, the actual velocity being indicated\r\nby the vertical height of the curve above the horizontal line M U.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Use of Velocity Curves.=—Besides being interesting, a knowledge of the\r\nvelocity of the air at all points in a tube is of much practical value.\r\nIt gives us the time a carrier will take in going from one station to\r\nanother. Usually the first questions asked, when it is proposed to lay\r\na pneumatic tube from station A to station B, are, How quickly can\r\nyou send a carrier between these points? How much time can be saved?\r\nThese questions are answered by constructing a velocity curve. Since\r\nthe velocity changes at every point along a tube, to get the time of\r\ntransit between two points we must know the average velocity of the\r\nair between those points. We can find this approximately from our\r\ncurve by measuring the height of the curve above the horizontal line\r\nM U at a large number of points, and then taking the average of all\r\nthese heights; but there is a more exact and easier method by means of\r\na mathematical formula. As such formula would be out of place here,\r\nwe will not give it; suffice it to say, that the average velocity of\r\nthe air between the tank and the end of the tube, in the case we have\r\nassumed, is about seventy-three feet per second (49.7 miles per hour),\r\na little less than one-half the sum of the velocities at the two ends,\r\nand a little more than the velocity at the half-mile point. Knowing\r\nthe average velocity, we can tell how long it takes for a particle\r\nof air, and it will be nearly the same for a carrier, to travel from\r\nthe tank to the end of the tube, by dividing the distance in feet by\r\nthe average velocity in feet per second. This we find to be one minute\r\n12.3 seconds. Since the air moves more rapidly as it approaches the\r\nopen end of the tube, a carrier will consume a greater period of time\r\nin going from the tank to the quarter mile point than in going from\r\nthe three-quarter mile point to the open end. The last quarter of a\r\nmile will be covered in a little more than fourteen seconds, while\r\nthe first quarter will require a little more than twenty-one seconds.\r\nThis difference is surprising, and it becomes even more marked in very\r\nlong tubes with high initial pressures. This explains why the service\r\nbetween stations located near the end of the tube is more rapid than\r\nbetween stations on other parts of the line.\r\n\r\nThis velocity curve shows us the velocity of the carriers at each\r\nstation along the line and enables us to regulate our time-locks\r\nand to locate the man-holes and circuit-closers connected with each\r\nintermediate station. It gives us the length of the “blocks” in our\r\n“block system.” When we know the velocity and weight of our carriers,\r\nwe can compute the energy stored up in them, and from this the length\r\nwe need to make our air-cushions so as not to have the air too highly\r\ncompressed. It would be impossible to design our apparatus properly if\r\nwe did not know the laws that govern the flow of air in the tubes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Quantity of Air Used.=—The next important fact that we learn from\r\nthe velocity curve is the quantity of air that flows through the tube\r\neach second or minute. If we multiply the velocity with which the\r\nair escapes from the open end of the tube by the area of the end of\r\nthe tube in square feet, we have the number of cubic feet of air at\r\natmospheric pressure discharged from the tube per unit of time. The\r\nsame quantity of air must be supplied to the tank in order to maintain\r\na constant flow in the tube. In the present case that we have assumed,\r\nthe tube is eight inches in diameter; therefore the cross-sectional\r\narea is 0.349 square foot. The velocity of the air as it comes out\r\nof the end of the tube is 100.4 feet per second; therefore about\r\nthirty-five cubic feet of air are discharged from the tube each second,\r\nor two thousand one hundred cubic feet per minute. This same amount\r\nmust be supplied to the tank A in order to maintain the pressure\r\nconstant, but when it is compressed so that it exerts a pressure of\r\nten pounds per square inch, the two thousand one hundred cubic feet\r\nwill only occupy a space of one thousand two hundred and fifty cubic\r\nfeet, if its temperature does not change. This leads us to consider the\r\neffect of temperature changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Temperature of the Air.=—If the air is allowed to become heated\r\nby compression, as is the case in practice, we have a new set of\r\nconditions. If the air in the tank A is hot,—that is, warmer than the\r\nsurrounding atmosphere,—it will by radiation cool somewhat before it\r\nenters the tube, and it will be still further cooled when it expands\r\nin the tube. Again, if its temperature falls below the temperature of\r\nthe ground in which the tube is laid, it will absorb heat from the\r\nground, and this will tend to keep up its temperature; so in practice\r\nwe have very complicated relations between the temperature, pressure,\r\nand volume of the air. These relations cannot be exactly expressed by\r\nmathematical formulæ, and we will make no attempt so to express them,\r\nbut will be content with saying that in practice we find that the\r\ntemperature of the air in the tubes is nearly constant after the first\r\nfew hundred feet, so that we can without appreciable error compute the\r\npressures and velocities as if it were constant. Now, if the air in the\r\ntank A is hot, we must raise the pressure a little above ten pounds\r\nper square inch to obtain the velocities given on our diagram. When\r\nthe air cools it contracts in volume, or, if the volume cannot change,\r\nbeing fixed by the limits of the containing vessel, then the pressure\r\nis reduced, so by raising the pressure in the tank A a little above ten\r\npounds, we compensate the loss of pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Horse-Power.=—Having shown how the quantity of air can be computed we\r\nare now in a position to estimate the horse-power of the air-compressor\r\nnecessary to operate the tube. I say estimate, because we have to take\r\ninto consideration the efficiency of the air-compressor, and that is\r\nnot an absolutely fixed quantity: it varies with different types of\r\nmachines and with their construction. When working with pressures of\r\nless than ten pounds, the friction of the machine is an important\r\nfactor. The area and construction of the valves in the air-cylinders\r\nis another very important factor. If the valves are not large enough\r\nor do not open promptly, our cylinders will not be filled with air\r\nat each stroke; this will reduce the efficiency of the machine. In\r\npractice we go to a manufacturer of air-compressors and tell him how\r\nmuch air must be compressed per minute, and the pressure to which it\r\nmust be compressed, with other conditions, and then he tells us what\r\nsize of machine we shall require and the horse-power of the machine\r\napproximately. He is supposed to know the efficiency of his own\r\nmachines. We may endeavor to prove his estimate by computations of our\r\nown. To give some idea of the horse-power required to supply the air\r\nneeded to operate our eight-inch tube one mile long, I will say that\r\nthe steam-engines of the air-compressor will have to develop in the\r\nvicinity of one hundred and twenty-five actual horse-power. From the\r\nhorse-power of the steam-engine we can easily compute the coal that\r\nwill be consumed under boilers of the usual type.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Efficiency.=—It will be noted that most of the power is not used\r\nprimarily in moving the carriers, but to move the air through the tube.\r\nVery nearly as much power is used to keep the air flowing in the tube\r\nwhen no carriers are in it as when carriers are being despatched. If we\r\nshould define the efficiency of a pneumatic tube as the ratio of the\r\npower consumed in moving the carriers to the power consumed in moving\r\nthe carriers and the air, we should find this so-called efficiency to\r\nbe very low. It is analogous to pulling the carrier with a long rope\r\nand dragging the rope on the ground. Much more power would be consumed\r\nby the rope than by the carrier. But a business man would define the\r\nefficiency of a pneumatic tube as the ratio of the cost of transporting\r\nhis letters, parcels, etc., to the cost of transporting them with equal\r\nspeed in any other way. Defined in this practical manner the efficiency\r\nof a pneumatic tube is high. We do not care what becomes of the power\r\nso long as it accomplishes our purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pressure and Exhaust Systems.=—We have noticed that pneumatic tubes\r\nhave not always been operated by compression of the air, but that some\r\nof the small tubes used in the telegraph service of European cities\r\nhave been operated by exhausting the air. The two systems are sometimes\r\ndistinguished by calling one a pressure system and the other an exhaust\r\nsystem. These terms are very misleading, for an exhaust system is\r\na pressure system. The current of air is kept flowing in a tube by\r\nmaintaining a difference of pressure at the two ends, and the result is\r\nthe same whether we raise the pressure at one end above the atmospheric\r\nor lower it at the other below the atmospheric. In either case it is\r\npressure that causes the air to flow. It happens that we are living in\r\nan atmosphere of about fifteen pounds pressure per square inch, and it\r\nis very convenient oftentimes in our computations to take the pressure\r\nof the atmosphere as our zero, and reckon all other pressures above and\r\nbelow this. If all our pressure scales read from absolute zero, the\r\npressure of a perfect vacuum, then all this confusion would be avoided.\r\nWe have not used the absolute zero in our diagram, because all our\r\ngauges are graduated with their zero at atmospheric pressure, and it is\r\ncustomary to speak of pressures above and below the atmospheric.\r\n\r\nIt is very natural to ask the question, why are tubes sometimes\r\noperated by compressing the air and at other times by exhausting it?\r\nWe answer by saying that it is usually a question of simplicity and\r\nconvenience that determines which system shall be used. Some of the\r\ncash systems in the stores use compressed air in the out-going tubes\r\nfrom the cashier’s desk and exhaust the air from the return tubes. Both\r\nends of the tubes are then left open at the counters, no sending or\r\nreceiving apparatus being required there. The carriers are so light,\r\ntheir velocity so low, and the air-pressure varies so little from the\r\npressure of the atmosphere that the carriers can be allowed to drop\r\nout of the tubes on to the counters, and they can be despatched by\r\nsimply placing them at the open end of the tube into which the air is\r\nflowing. The currents of air entering and leaving the tubes are not\r\nso strong as to cause any special annoyance. At the cashier’s desk\r\nsome simple receiving and sending apparatus has to be used, but it is\r\nbetter to concentrate all of the apparatus at one point rather than\r\nhave it distributed about the store, as would be the case if the double\r\nsystem were not used. In the London pneumatic telegraph both methods\r\nof operation have been in use. Double lines were laid, and the engines\r\nexhausted the air from one tube and forced it into the other. The\r\nexhausted tube was therefore used to despatch in one direction, while\r\nthe other tube, operated by the compressed air, served for despatching\r\nin the opposite direction. So far as I know, both work equally well.\r\n\r\nIn operating large tubes, that is to say, tubes six or eight inches\r\nin diameter, there is an advantage in using compressed, rather than\r\nexhausted air, in the construction of the sending and receiving\r\napparatus, especially when the tubes are very long. With an ample\r\nsupply of compressed air always at hand, the air-cushions can be made\r\nshorter and more effective in bringing the carriers quickly to rest.\r\nWith exhausted air the cushions are ineffective, and consequently\r\nmust be made very long in order to stop the carrier before it strikes\r\nthe closed end of the tube. This does not apply to small tubes where\r\nthe carriers are so light that they can be stopped without injury by\r\nallowing them to strike solid buffers. Again, when compressed air is\r\nused, we have a larger difference in pressure between the pressure in\r\nthe tube and the atmosphere to operate our mechanism by cylinders and\r\npistons. With an exhaust system carriers are not so easily ejected\r\nfrom the tubes of the receiving apparatus; we could not use the simple\r\nform of open receiver. Again, if the tubes are laid in wet ground, and\r\na leak occurs in any of the joints, water will be drawn in if air is\r\nbeing exhausted from the tube, while it will be kept out if compressed\r\nair is used.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the question of relative economy of the two systems, we\r\nwill say that when long tubes are used, requiring high pressures, or,\r\nmore strictly speaking, a large difference of pressure, to maintain the\r\ndesired velocity of air-current, there seems to be some advantage in\r\nusing an exhaust system. The reason is this: the friction of the air in\r\nthe tube, which absorbs most of the power, increases as the air becomes\r\nheavier and more dense. When the air is exhausted from the tube, we\r\nare using a current of rarefied air, and this moves through the tube\r\nwith less friction and, consequently, a higher velocity, for the same\r\ndifference of pressure, than the more dense compressed air. But for\r\nshort tubes that require only a small difference of pressure, this\r\nadvantage becomes very small, and is overbalanced by other advantages\r\nof a compressed air system. So, taking everything into consideration,\r\nthere is not so much to be said in favor of an exhaust system.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Laws Expressed in Mathematical Formulæ.=—While we have heretofore\r\npurposely avoided all complicated mathematical formulæ, it may not\r\nbe out of place here to give a few of the more simple relations that\r\nexist between the pressure, velocity, length and diameter of the tubes,\r\netc. In two tubes having the same diameter, with the same pressures\r\nmaintained at each end, but of different lengths, the mean velocities\r\nof the air in the tubes will bear the inverse ratio to the square\r\nroots of the lengths of the tubes. This is expressed by the following\r\nproportion:\r\n\r\n_u_ : U :: √L : √_l_\r\n\r\n_u_ and U represent the mean velocities of the air in the two tubes and\r\n_l_ and L the respective lengths of tubes.\r\n\r\nA similar but direct ratio exists between the mean velocities and the\r\ndiameters of the tubes, thus:\r\n\r\n_u_ : U :: √_d_ : √D\r\n\r\nThis relation, however, is only approximately true for tubes differing\r\ngreatly in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the pressure to other factors is not so simply\r\nexpressed. For example, in two tubes of the same length and diameter,\r\nthe relation between the pressures at the ends and the mean velocity of\r\nthe air may be expressed as follows:\r\n\r\n           (_pₒ_² - _p₁_²)^³/²   (Pₒ² - P₁²)^³/²\r\n_u_ : U ::  —————————————      :  —————————\r\n           (_pₒ_³ - _p₁_³)       (Pₒ³ - P₁³)\r\n\r\nwhere _u_ and U are the respective mean velocities, _p__{0} and P_{0}\r\nthe respective pressures at the initial ends of the tubes, and _p__{1}\r\nand P_{1} the respective pressures at the final ends of the tubes,—the\r\npressures being measured above absolute zero.\r\n\r\nThere are other relations that can be similarly expressed, but for them\r\nwe must refer the reader to a mathematical treatise on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Moisture in the Tubes.=—When pressures of more than five pounds per\r\nsquare inch are used, it is not unusual to find some moisture on the\r\ninterior of the tube and upon the outside of the carriers when they\r\ncome out of the tube. It is seldom more than a slight dampness, or at\r\nmost a degree of wetness equal to that seen on the outside of a pitcher\r\nof ice-water on a warm day. A slight amount of moisture in the tube is\r\nnot objectionable, for it serves as a lubricant to the carriers; but\r\nwhen it is present in considerable quantity it becomes objectionable\r\nand even annoying. This moisture is brought into the tube with the air,\r\nand is deposited upon the walls of the tube when their temperature\r\nis sufficiently below that of the atmosphere. The atmosphere always\r\ncontains more or less moisture in the state of vapor. The capacity of\r\nair for water-vapor depends upon its temperature, being greater the\r\nhigher the temperature, but it is a fixed and definite quantity at any\r\ngiven temperature. When the air contains all the water-vapor it can\r\nhold at a certain temperature, it is said to be saturated. If it is\r\nnot saturated, we express the amount that it contains in per cent. of\r\nthe amount it would contain if it were saturated, and this is termed\r\nthe “relative humidity.” For example, if the air is three-fourths\r\nsaturated, we say the “relative humidity” is seventy-five; but if the\r\ntemperature changes, the “relative humidity” changes also. Suppose\r\nthe temperature to-day is seventy-five degrees Fahrenheit, and that\r\nthe “relative humidity” is eighty, a cubic foot of air then contains\r\n0.00107 pound of water-vapor. Now suppose this air enters a pneumatic\r\ntube and is cooled by expansion and contact with the colder walls of\r\nthe tube to sixty degrees. At this temperature a cubic foot of air can\r\ncontain only 0.00082 pound of water-vapor when it is saturated. Now,\r\neach cubic foot of air brought into the tube brings with it 0.00107\r\npound of vapor, and after it is cooled down to sixty degrees it cannot\r\nhold it all, consequently the difference, or 0.00025 pound, must be\r\ndeposited in the tube. Under these conditions one hundred thousand\r\ncubic feet of air will deposit twenty-five pounds of water in the tube.\r\n\r\nIn the system of pneumatic tubes built and operated by the Batcheller\r\nPneumatic Tube Company, the presence of a large quantity of moisture\r\nin the tube is prevented by using the same air over and over again. A\r\nlittle moisture may be deposited when the tube starts into operation,\r\nbut the amount does not increase appreciably, as very little fresh air\r\nis admitted after starting.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Location of Obstructions in Tubes.=—In regard to the removal of\r\nobstructions in the tubes, I have had little or no experience;\r\ntherefore under this heading I am satisfied to quote from the “Minutes\r\nof the Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers,” London,\r\nVolume XLIII.\r\n\r\n“Intimately connected with the working of the tubes is the removal of\r\nobstructions which occur from time to time, causing not unfrequently\r\nserious inconvenience and delay. The most general cause of obstruction\r\nis a stoppage of the train arising from accident to the tube, to the\r\ncarriers or piston, or to the transmitting apparatus. In such cases the\r\ndelay is generally very brief, it being for the most part sufficient to\r\nreverse the pressure on the train from the next station, and to drive\r\nit back to the point it started from. If one or more of the carriers\r\nbreak in the tube, reverse pressure is also generally sufficient to\r\nremove the obstacle; but where this fails, the point of obstruction\r\nmust be ascertained. This is done by carefully observing the variations\r\nof air pressure in the reservoir when placed in connection, first\r\nwith a line of known length, and then with the obstructed tube. By\r\nthis means the position of the obstruction can be ascertained within\r\none hundred feet. Or the tube may be probed with a long rod up to a\r\nlength of two hundred feet. A very ingenious apparatus, by M. Ch.\r\nBontemps, is shown in Figs. 49 and 50, and is employed to ascertain\r\nthe exact position of the obstruction. It acts by the reflection of\r\nsound-waves on a rubber diaphragm. A small metal disk is cemented to\r\nthe rubber, and above this is a pointed screw, D. An electric circuit\r\nis closed where the points C and D are brought in contact. To locate an\r\nobstruction a pistol is fired into the tube as shown, and the resulting\r\nwave, traversing the tube at the rate of three hundred and thirty\r\nmetres a second, strikes the obstruction and is then reflected against\r\nthe diaphragm, which in its turn reflects it to the obstacle, whence it\r\nreturns to the diaphragm. By this means indications are marked on the\r\nrecording cylinder, and if the interval of time between the first and\r\nsecond indications be recorded, the distance of the obstacle from the\r\nmembrane is easily ascertained. The chronograph employed is provided\r\nwith three points; the first of these is placed in a circuit, which\r\nis closed by the successive vibrations of the diaphragm; the second\r\ncorresponds to an electric regulator, marking seconds on the cylinder;\r\nand the third subdivides the seconds there marked. Fig. 50 indicates a\r\nrecord thus made. In this case the obstacle is situated at a distance\r\nof sixty-two metres, and the vibration marks thirty-three oscillations\r\nper second. The interval occupied by two successive marks from the\r\ndiaphragm on the paper corresponds to twelve oscillations, and the\r\ndistance of the obstruction is then calculated by the following formula:\r\n\r\nD = 0.5 × 330 × 12/33 = 60 metres;\r\n\r\nso that the distance of the obstacle is recorded within two metres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.\r\n\r\nOBSTRUCTION-RECORDING APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.\r\n\r\nOBSTRUCTION-RECORDING APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\n“Amongst the special causes of accident may be mentioned the accidental\r\nabsence of a piston to the train, breaking of the piston, the freezing\r\nup of a piston in the tube, and even forgetting the presence of a\r\ntrain, which has caused the entire service to be one train late\r\nthroughout the day. Finally, the tubes themselves are sometimes broken\r\nor disturbed during street repairs, resulting of course in a complete\r\ncessation of traffic in the system till the damage is made good.”",
