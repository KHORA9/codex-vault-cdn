He took it inside and opened it. It was a\r\nremarkably fine meerschaum pipe, such as the sergeant had longed\r\nirrationally to own for many years. There was no message with it, nor\r\nany card. He swore bitterly.\r\n\r\nOn his way to Headquarters he stopped in at the orphanage where he\r\nusually left such gifts. On other occasions he had left Scotch, a\r\nfly-rod, sets of very expensive dry-flies, and dozens of pairs of silk\r\nsocks. The female head of the orphanage accepted the gift with\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\n\"I don't suppose,\" said Fitzgerald morbidly, \"that any of your kids will\r\nsmoke this pipe, but I want to be rid of it and for somebody to know.\"\r\nHe paused. \"Are you gettin' many other gifts on this order, from other\r\ncops? Like you used to?\"\r\n\r\nThe head of the orphanage admitted that the total had dropped off.\r\nFitzgerald went on his way, brooding. He'd been getting anonymous gifts\r\nlike this ever since Big Jake Connors moved into town with bright ideas.\r\nBig Jake denied that he was the generous party. He expressed complete\r\nignorance. But Detective Sergeant Fitzgerald knew better. The gifts were\r\nhaving their effect upon the Force. There was a police lieutenant whose\r\nwife had received a mink stole out of thin air and didn't speak to her\r\nhusband for ten days when he gave it to the Community Drive. He wouldn't\r\ndo a thing like that again! There was another sergeant--not\r\nFitzgerald--who'd found a set of four new white-walls tires on his\r\ndoorstep, and was ostracized by his teen-age offspring when he turned\r\nthem into the police Lost and Found. Fitzgerald gave his gifts to an\r\norphanage, with a fine disregard of their inappropriateness. But he\r\ngloomily suspected that a great many of his friends were weakening. The\r\npresents weren't bribes. Big Jake not only didn't ask acknowledgments of\r\nthem, he denied that he was the giver. But inevitably the recipients of\r\nbounty with the morning milk felt less indignation about what Big Jake\r\nwas doing and wasn't getting caught at.\r\n\r\nAt Headquarters, Detective Sergeant Fitzgerald found a memo. A memo was\r\nroutine, but the contents of this one were remarkable. He scowled at it.\r\nHe made phone calls, checking up on the more unlikely parts of it. Then\r\nhe went to make the regular investigation.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached his destination he found it an unpretentious frame\r\nbuilding with a sign outside: \"Elite Cleaners and Dyers.\" There were no\r\nplate-glass windows. There was nothing show-off about it. It was just a\r\nmedium-sized, modestly up-to-date establishment to which lesser\r\ntailoring shops would send work for wholesale treatment. From some place\r\nin the back, puffs of steam shot out at irregular intervals. Somebody\r\nworked a steampresser on garments of one sort or another. There was a\r\nrumbling hum, as of an oversized washing-machine in operation. All\r\nseemed tranquil.\r\n\r\nThe detective went in the door. Inside there was that peculiar,\r\nprofessional-cleaning-fluid smell, which is not as alarming as gasoline\r\nor carbon tetrachloride, but nevertheless discourages the idea of\r\nstriking a match. In the outer office a man wrote placidly on one\r\nblue-paper strip after another. He had an air of pleasant\r\nself-confidence. He glanced up briefly, nodded, wrote on three more\r\nblue-paper strips, and then gathered them all up and put them in a\r\nparticular place. He turned to Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\nFitzgerald showed his shield. The man behind the counter nodded again.\r\n\r\n\"My name's Fitzgerald,\" grunted the detective. \"The boss?\"\r\n\r\n\"Me,\" said the man behind the counter. He was cordial. \"My name's Brink.\r\nYou've got something to talk to me about?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the idea,\" said Fitzgerald. \"A coupla questions.\"\r\n\r\nBrink jerked a thumb toward a door.\r\n\r\n\"Come in the other office. Chairs there, and we can sit down. What's the\r\ntrouble? A complaint of some kind?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe ushered Fitzgerald in before him. The detective found himself\r\nscowling. He'd have felt better with a different kind of man to ask\r\nquestions of. This Brink looked untroubled and confident. It didn't\r\nfit the situation. The inner office looked equally matter-of-fact.\r\nNo.... There was the shelf with the usual books of reference on textiles\r\nand such items as a cleaner-and-dyer might need to have on hand.\r\nBut there were some others: \"_Basic Principles of Psi_\", \"_Modern\r\nPsychokinetic Theories_.\" There was a small, mostly-plastic machine on\r\nanother shelf. It had no obvious function. It looked as if it had some\r\nunguessable but rarely-used purpose. There was dust on it.\r\n\r\n\"What's the complaint?\" repeated Brink. \"Hm-m-m. A cigar?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Detective Sergeant Fitzgerald. \"I'll light my pipe.\" He did,\r\nextracting tobacco and a pipe that was by no means a meerschaum from his\r\npocket. He puffed and said: \"A guy who works for you caught himself on\r\nfire this mornin'. It happened on a bus. Very peculiar. The guy's name\r\nwas Jacaro.\"\r\n\r\nBrink did not look surprised.\r\n\r\n\"What happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's kind of a strange thing,\" said Fitzgerald. \"Accordin' to the\r\nreport he's ridin' this bus, readin' his paper, when all of a sudden he\r\nyells an' jumps up. His pants are on fire. He gets 'em off fast and\r\nchucks them out the bus window. He's blistered some but not serious, and\r\nhe clams up--but good--when the ambulance doc puts salve on him. He\r\nwon't say a word about what happened or how. They hadda call a ambulance\r\nbecause he couldn't go huntin' a doc with no pants on.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he's not burned badly?\" asked Brink.\r\n\r\n\"No. Blisters, yes. Scared, yes. And mad as hell. But he'll get along.\r\nIt's too bad. We've pinched him three times on suspicion of arson, but\r\nwe couldn't make it stick. Something ought to happen to make that guy\r\nstop playin' with matches--only this wasn't matches.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad he's only a little bit scorched,\" said Brink. He considered.\r\n\"Did he say anything about his eyelids twitching this morning? I don't\r\nsuppose he would.\"\r\n\r\nThe detective stared.\r\n\r\n\"He didn't. Say aren't you curious about how he came to catch on fire?\r\nOr what his pants smelled of that burned so urgent? Or where he expected\r\nburnin' to start instead of his pants?\"\r\n\r\nBrink thought it over. Then he shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"No. I don't think I'm curious.\"\r\n\r\nThe detective looked at him long and hard.\r\n\r\n\"O.K.,\" he said dourly. \"But there's something else. Day before\r\nyesterday there was a car accident opposite here. Remember?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't here at the time,\" said Brink.\r\n\r\n\"There's a car rolling along the street outside,\" said the detective.\r\n\"There's some hoods in it--guys who do dirty work for Big Jake Connors.\r\nI can't prove a thing, but it looks like they had ideas about this\r\nplace. About thirty yards up the street a sawed-off shotgun goes off.\r\nVery peculiar. It sends a load of buckshot through a side window of your\r\nplace.\"\r\n\r\nBrink said with an air of surprise: \"Oh! That must have been what broke\r\nthe window!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Fitzgerald. \"But the interesting thing is that the flash of\r\nthe shotgun burned all the hair off the head of the guy that was doin'\r\nthe drivin'. It didn't scratch him, just scorched his hair off. It\r\nscared him silly.\"\r\n\r\nBrink grinned faintly, but he said pleasantly: \"Tsk. Tsk. Tsk.\"\r\n\r\n\"He jams down the accelerator and rams a telephone pole,\" pursued\r\nFitzgerald. \"There's four hoods in that car, remember, and every one of\r\n'em's got a police record you could paper a house with. And they've got\r\nfour sawed-off shotguns and a tommy-gun in the back seat. They're all\r\nlaid out cold when the cops arrive.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was wondering about the window,\" said Brink, pensively.\r\n\r\n\"It puzzles you, eh?\" demanded the detective ironically. \"Could you've\r\nfigured it out that they were goin' to shoot up your plant to scare the\r\npeople who work for you so they'll quit? Did you make a guess they\r\nintended to drive you outta business like they did the guy that had this\r\nplace before you?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's an interesting theory,\" said Brink encouragingly.\r\n\r\nDetective Fitzgerald nodded.\r\n\r\n\"There's one thing more,\" he said formidably. \"You got a delivery truck.\r\nYou keep it in a garage back yonder. Yesterday you sent it to a garage\r\nfor inspection of brakes an' lights an' such.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Brink. \"I did. It's not back yet. They were busy. They'll\r\ncall me when it's ready.\"\r\n\r\nFitzgerald snorted.\r\n\r\n\"They'll call you when the bomb squad gets through checkin' it! When the\r\nguys at the garage lifted the hood they started runnin'. Then they\r\nhollered copper. There was a bomb in there!\"\r\n\r\nBrink seemed to try to look surprised. He only looked interested.\r\n\r\n\"Two sticks of dynamite,\" the detective told him grimly, \"wired up to go\r\noff when your driver turned on the ignition. He did but it didn't. But\r\nwe got a police force in this town! We know there's racketeerin' bein'\r\npracticed. We know there's crooked stuff goin' on. We even got mighty\r\ngood ideas who's doin' it. But we ain't been able to get anything on\r\nanybody. Not yet. Nobody's been willin' to talk, so far. But you--\"\r\n\r\nThe telephone rang stridently. Brink looked at the instrument and\r\nshrugged. He answered.\r\n\r\n\"Hello.... No, Mr. Jacaro isn't in today. He didn't come to work. On the\r\nway downtown his pants caught on fire--\"\r\n\r\nFitzgerald guessed that the voice at the other end of the line said\r\n\"_What?_\" in, an explosive manner.\r\n\r\nBrink said matter-of-factly: \"I said his pants caught on fire. It was\r\nprobably something he was bringing here to burn the plant down with--a\r\nfire bomb. I don't think he's to blame that it went off early. He\r\nprobably started out with the worst possible intentions, but something\r\nhappened....\" He listened and said: \"But he didn't chicken! He couldn't\r\ncome to work and plant a fire bomb to set fire to the place!... I know\r\nit must be upsetting to have things like that automobile accident and my\r\ntruck not blowing up and now Jacaro's pants instead of my business going\r\nup in flames. But I told you--\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped and listened. Once he grinned.\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" he said after a moment. He covered the transmitter and turned to\r\nFitzgerald. \"What hospital is Jacaro in?\"\r\n\r\nFitzgerald said sourly: \"He wasn't burned bad. Just blistered. They lent\r\nhim some pants and he went home cussing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Brink. He uncovered the transmitter. \"He went home,\" he\r\ntold the instrument. \"You can ask him about it. In a way I'm sure it\r\nwasn't his fault. I'm quite sure his eyelids twitched when he started\r\nout. I think the men who drove the car the other day had twitching\r\neyelids, too. You should ask--\"\r\n\r\nThe detective heard muted noises, as it a man shouted into a transmitter\r\nsomewhere.\r\n\r\nBrink said briskly: \"No, I don't see any reason to change my\r\nmind.... No.... I know it was luck, if you want to put it that way,\r\nbut.... No. I wouldn't advise that! Please take my advice about when\r\nyour eyelid twitches--\"\r\n\r\nFitzgerald heard the crash of the receiver hung up at some distant\r\nplace. Brink rubbed his ear. He turned back.\r\n\r\n\"Hm-m-m,\" he said. \"Your pipe's gone out.\"\r\n\r\nIt was. Sergeant Fitzgerald puffed ineffectually. Brink reached out his\r\nfinger and tapped the bowl of the detective's pipe. Instantly fragrant\r\nsmoke filled the detective's mouth. He sputtered.\r\n\r\n\"Now.... where were we?\" asked Brink.\r\n\r\n\"Who was that?\" demanded Fitzgerald ferociously. \"That was Big Jake\r\nConnors!\"\r\n\r\n\"You may be right.\" Brink told him. \"He's never exactly given me his\r\nname. He just calls up every so often and talks nonsense.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort of nonsense?\"\r\n\r\n\"He wants to be a partner in this business,\" said Brink without\r\nemotion. \"He's been saying that things will happen to it otherwise. I\r\ndon't believe it. Anyhow nothing's happened so far.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDetective Sergeant Fitzgerald tried at one and the same time to roar and\r\nto swallow. He accomplished neither. He put his finger in the bowl of\r\nhis pipe. He jerked it out, scorched.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" he said almost hoarsely, \"I was tellin' you when the phone rang!\r\nWe got a police force here in town! This's what we've been tryin' to\r\nget! You come along with me to Headquarters an' swear to a complaint--\"\r\n\r\nBrink said interestedly: \"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"That guy Big Jake Connors!\" raged the detective. \"That's why! Tryin' to\r\nthreaten you into givin' him a share in your business! Tryin' to burn it\r\ndown or blow it up when you won't! He was just a small-town crook, once.\r\nHe went to the big town an' came back with ideas. He's usin' 'em!\"\r\n\r\nBrink looked at him expectantly.\r\n\r\n\"He started a beer business,\" said the detective bitterly. \"Simultaneous\r\nother beer dealers started havin' trouble. Empty kegs smashed. Trucks\r\nbroke down. Drivers in fights. They hadda go outta business!\"\r\n\r\n\"What did the cops do?\" asked Brink.\r\n\r\n\"They listened to their wives!\" snarled Fitzgerald. \"They begun to find\r\nlittle grabbag packages in the mail an' with the milk. Fancy perfume.\r\nTricky stockin's. Fancy underwear they shoulda been ashamed for anybody\r\nto know they had it on underneath. The cops weren't bribed, but their\r\nwives liked openin' the door of a mornin' an' findin' charmin' little\r\nsurprises.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said Brink.\r\n\r\n\"Then there were juke boxes,\" went on the detective. \"He went in that\r\nbusiness--an' trouble started. People'd drive up to a beer joint, go in,\r\nget in a scuffle an'--bingo! The juke box smashed. Always the juke box.\r\nAlways a out-of-town customer. Half the juke boxes in town weren't\r\nworkin', on an average. But the ones that were workin' were always Big\r\nJake's. Presently he had the juke-box business to himself.\"\r\n\r\nBrink nodded, somehow appreciatively.\r\n\r\n\"Then it was cabs,\" said Fitzgerald. \"A lot of cops felt bad about that.\r\nBut their wives wouldn't be happy if anything happened to dear Mr. Big\r\nJake who denied that he gave anybody anything, so it was all right to\r\nuse that lovely perfume.... Cabs got holes in their radiators. They got\r\nsand in their oil systems. They had blowouts an' leaks in brake-fluid\r\nlines. Cops' wives were afraid Big Jake would get caught. But he didn't.\r\nHe started insurin' cabs against that kinda accident. Now every\r\ncab-driver pays protection-money for what they call insurance--or else.\r\nAn' cops' wives get up early, bright-eyed, to see what Santa Claus left\r\nwith the milk.\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem,\" said Brink with a grin, \"to hint that this Big Jake\r\nis ... well ... dishonest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dishonest!\" Fitzgerald's face was purplish, from many memories of\r\nwrongs. \"There was a guy named Burdock who owned this business before\r\nyou. Y'know what happened to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Brink. \"He's my brother-in-law. Connors or somebody insisted\r\non having a share of the business and threatened dreadful things if he\r\ndidn't. He didn't. So acid got spilled on clothes. Machinery got\r\nsmashed. Once a whole delivery-truck load of clothes disappeared and my\r\nbrother-in-law had to pay for any number of suits and dresses. It\r\ngot him down. He's recovering from the nervous strain now, and my\r\nsister ... eh, asked me to help out. So I offered to take over. He warned\r\nme I'd have the same trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you've got it!\" fumed the detective. \"But anyhow you'll make a\r\ncomplaint. We'll get out some warrants, and we'll have somethin' to go\r\non--\"\r\n\r\n\"But nothing's happened to complain about,\" said Brink, quite\r\nreasonably. \"One broken window's not worth a fuss.\"\r\n\r\n\"But somethin's goin' to happen!\" insisted the detective. \"That guy Big\r\nJake is poison! He's takin' over the whole town, bit by bit! You've been\r\nlucky so far, but your luck could run out--\"\r\n\r\nBrink shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"No-o-o,\" he said matter-of-factly. \"I'm grateful to you, Mr.\r\nFitzgerald, but I have a special kind of luck. I won't tell you about it\r\nbecause you wouldn't believe but--but I can give you some of it. If you\r\ndon't mind, I will.\"\r\n\r\nHe went to the slightly dusty, partly-plastic machine. On its shelf were\r\nsome parts of metal, and some of transparent plastic, and some grayish,\r\ngranular substance it was hard to identify. There was an elaborate\r\ndiagram of something like an electronic circuit inside, but it might\r\nhave been a molecular diagram from organic chemistry. Brink made an\r\nadjustment and pressed firmly on a special part of the machine, which\r\ndid not yield at all. Then he took a slip of plastic out of a slot in\r\nthe bottom.\r\n\r\n\"You can call this a good-luck charm,\" he said pleasantly, \"or a\r\ntalisman. Actually it's a psionic unit. One like it works very well, for\r\nme. Anyhow there's no harm in it. Just one thing. If your eyelids start\r\nto twitch, you'll be headed for danger or trouble or something\r\nunpleasant. So if they do twitch, stop and be very, very careful.\r\nPlease!\"\r\n\r\nHe handed the bit of plastic to Fitzgerald, who took it without\r\nconscious volition.\r\n\r\nThen Brink said briskly: \"If there isn't anything else--\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't swear out a warrant against Big Jake?\" demanded Fitzgerald\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't any reason to,\" said Brink amiably. \"I'm doing all right. He\r\nhasn't harmed me. I don't think he will.\"\r\n\r\n\"O.K.!\" said the detective bitterly. \"Have it your way! But he's got it\r\nin for you an' he's goin' to keep tryin' until he gets you! An' whether\r\nyou like it or not, you're goin' to have some police protection as soon\r\nas I can set it up.\"\r\n\r\nHe stamped out of the cleaning-and-drying plant. Automatically, he put\r\nthe bit of plastic in his pocket. He didn't know why. He got into his\r\ncar and drove downtown. As he drove, he looked suspiciously at his pipe.\r\nHe fumed. As he fumed, he swore. He did not like mysteries. But there\r\nwas no mystery about his dislike for Big Jake Connors. He turned aside\r\nfrom the direct route to Headquarters to indulge it. He drove to a\r\nhospital where four out-of-town hoods had been carried two days before.\r\nHe marched inside and up to a second-floor corridor door with a\r\nuniformed policeman seated outside it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Hm-m-m. Donnelly,\" he growled. \"How about those guys?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so good,\" said the patrolman. \"They're gettin' better.\"\r\n\r\n\"They would,\" growled Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\n\"A lawyer's been to see 'em twice,\" said the patrolman. \"He's comin'\r\nback after lunch.\"\r\n\r\n\"He would,\" grunted the detective.\r\n\r\n\"They want out,\" said the cop.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not surprised,\" said Detective Sergeant Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\nHe went into the sick room. There were four patients in it, none of them\r\nlooking exactly like gentle invalids. There were two broken noses of\r\nlong-ago dates, three cauliflower ears, and one scar of a kind that is\r\nnot the result of playing lawn tennis. Two were visibly bandaged, and\r\nthe others adhesive-taped. All of them looked at Fitzgerald without\r\ncordiality.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, well!\" he said. \"You fellas still here!\" There was silence.\r\n\"In union there is strength,\" said Fitzgerald. \"As long as you stay in\r\none room everybody's sure the others haven't started rattin'. Right?\"\r\n\r\nOne of the four snarled silently at him.\r\n\r\n\"It was just a accident,\" pursued the detective. \"You four guys are\r\nridin' along peaceable, merrily takin' the air, when quite inadvertently\r\none of you almost blows the head off of another, and he's so astonished\r\nat there bein' a gun in the car that he wrecks it. And when they get you\r\nguys in the hospital there ain't one of you knows anything about four\r\nsawed-off shotguns and a tommy gun in the car with you. Strange!\r\nStrange! Strange!\"\r\n\r\nFour faces regarded him with impassive dislike. The bandaged ones were\r\nprettier than the ones that weren't.\r\n\r\n\"That tommy gun business,\" explained Fitzgerald, \"is a federal affair.\r\nIt's against Fed law to carry 'em around loaded. And your friend Big\r\nJake hasn't been leavin' presents on the White House steps. Y'know, you\r\nguys could be in trouble!\"\r\n\r\nThree pairs of eyes and an odd one--the other was hidden under a\r\nbandage--stared at him stonily.\r\n\r\n\"Y'see,\" explained Fitzgerald again, \"Big Jake's slipped up. He hasn't\r\nrealized it yet. Its my little secret. A week ago I thought he had me\r\nlicked. But somethin' happened, and today I felt like I had to come\r\naround and congratulate you fellas. You got a break! You're gonna have\r\nfree board and lodging for years to come! I wanted to be the first to\r\ntell you!\"\r\n\r\nHe beamed at them and went out. Outside, his expression changed. He said\r\nbitterly to the cop at the door: \"I bet they beat this rap!\"\r\n\r\nHe went downstairs and out of the hospital. He started around the\r\nbuilding to his car.\r\n\r\nHis eyelid twitched. It twitched again. It began to quiver and flutter\r\ncontinuously. Fitzgerald stopped short to rub the offending eye.\r\n\r\nThere was a crash. A heavy glass water-pitcher hit the cement walk\r\nimmediately before him. It broke into a million pieces. He glared up.\r\nThe pitcher would have hit him if it hadn't been for a twitching eyelid\r\nthat had brought him to a stop. The window of the room he'd just left\r\nwas open, but there was no way to prove that a patient had gotten out of\r\nbed to heave the pitcher. And it had broken into too many pieces to\r\noffer fingerprint evidence.\r\n\r\n\"Hah!\" said Fitzgerald morosely. \"They're plenty confident!\"\r\n\r\nHe went to Headquarters. There were more memos for his attention. One\r\nwas just in. A cab had crossed a sidewalk and crashed into a plate-glass\r\nwindow. Its hydraulic brakes had failed. The trouble was a clean saw-cut\r\nin a pressure-line. Fitzgerald went to find out about it. The cab driver\r\nbitterly refused to answer any questions. He wouldn't even admit that he\r\nwas not insured by Big Jake against such accidents. Fitzgerald stormed.\r\nThe owner-driver firmly--and gloomily--refused to answer a question\r\nabout whether he'd been threatened if he didn't pay protection money.\r\n\r\nFitzgerald raged, on the sidewalk beside the cab in the act of being\r\nextracted from the plate-glass window. An open-mouthed bystander\r\nlistened admiringly to his language. Then the detective's eyelid\r\ntwitched. It twitched again, violently. Something made him look up. An\r\nemployee of the plate-glass company--there were rumors that Big Jake was\r\ninteresting himself in plate-glass insurance besides cabs--wrenched\r\nloose a certain spot. Fitzgerald grabbed the bystander and leaped. There\r\nwas a musical crash behind him. A tall section of the shattered glass\r\nfell exactly where he had been standing. It could have been pure\r\naccident. On the other hand--\r\n\r\nHe couldn't prove anything, but he had a queer feeling as he left the\r\nscene of the crash. Back in his own car he felt chilly. Driving away,\r\npresently, he felt his eyelid tentatively. He wasn't a nervous man.\r\nOrdinarily his eyelids didn't twitch.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe went to investigate a second memo. It was a restaurant, and he edged\r\nthe police car gingerly into a lane beside the building. In the rear,\r\nthe odor of spilled beer filled the air. It would have been attractive\r\nbut for an admixture of gasoline fumes and the fact that it was mud. Mud\r\nwhose moisture-content is spilled beer has a peculiar smell all its own.\r\n\r\nHe got out of his car and gloomily asked the questions the memo called\r\nfor. He didn't need to. He could have written down all the answers in\r\nadvance. The restaurant now reporting vandalism had found big Jake's\r\nbrand of beer unpopular. It had twenty cases of a superior brew brought\r\nin by motor-truck. It was stacked in a small building behind the café.\r\nFor one happy evening, the customers chose their own beer.\r\n\r\nNow, next day, there were eighteen cases of smashed beer bottles. The\r\ncrime had been committed in the small hours. There were no clues. The\r\nrestaurant proprietor unconvincingly declared that he had no idea who'd\r\ncaused it. But he'd only notified the police so he could collect\r\ninsurance--not from Big Jake.\r\n\r\nWith a sort of morbid, frustrated gloom, Detective Sergeant Fitzgerald\r\nmade the necessary notes. He put his notebook in his pocket and backed\r\nhis car out of the alley. Oddly enough, he thought of a beautifully\r\ncarved meerschaum pipe he'd found with the milk that morning. He'd\r\npresented it to an orphanage mainly because, irrationally, he'd have\r\nliked to keep it. There had been other expensive gifts he'd have liked\r\nto keep. Bourbon. A set of expensive dry-flies. An eight-millimeter\r\nmovie camera. Scotch. Shiny, smooth silk socks that would have soothed\r\nhis weary feet. He'd denied himself these gifts because he believed--he\r\nknew--that they came from Big Jake, who tactfully won friends and\r\ninfluenced people by making presents and denying it. In business matters\r\nhe was stern, because that was the way to collect protection-money. But\r\nhe was subtle with cops. He had their wives on his side.\r\n\r\nSergeant Fitzgerald growled in his throat. He'd always wanted a really\r\nfine meerschaum pipe. He'd had one this morning, and he'd had to get rid\r\nof it because it came from Big Jake. He felt that Big Jake had robbed\r\nhim of it.\r\n\r\nHe turned the police car and drove back toward the Elite Cleaners and\r\nDyers establishment. As he drove, he growled. His eyelid had twitched\r\ntwice, and each time he'd been heading into danger or trouble. The fact\r\nwas dauntingly coincidental with Brink's comment after giving him a\r\nscrap of plastic from the bottom of that crazy machine. These things\r\nwere on his mind. He couldn't bring himself to plan to mention them, but\r\nhe needed to talk to Brink again. Brink could testify to threats. He\r\ncould justify arrests. Sergeant Fitzgerald had a fine conviction that\r\nwith a chance to apply pressure, he could make some of Big Jake's hoods\r\nand collectors talk, and so bust things wide open. He only needed\r\nBrink's co-operation. He drove toward the Elite Cleaners and Dyers to\r\nput pressure on Brink toward that happy end. But he brooded over his own\r\neyebrow-twitchings.\r\n\r\nWhen the cleaning establishment came into view, there was a car parked\r\nbefore it. Two men from that car were in the act of entering the Elite\r\nplant through the same door the detective had used earlier. He parked\r\nhis car behind the other. Fuming, he crossed the sidewalk and entered\r\nthe building. As he entered, he heard a scream from the back. He heard a\r\ncrashing sound and more screams.\r\n\r\nHe bolted ahead, through the outer office and into the working area he\r\nhad not visited before. He burst through swinging doors into a\r\ntwo-story, machinery-filled cleaning-and-dyeing plant. Tables and\r\ngarment racks and five separate people appeared as proper occupants of\r\nthe place. But something had happened. There was a flood of\r\nliquid--detergent solution--flowing toward the open back doors of the\r\nbig room. It obviously came from a large carboy which had been smashed\r\nas if to draw attention to some urgent matter.\r\n\r\nThe people in the room seemed to have frozen at their work, except that\r\nBrink had apparently been interrupted in some supervisory task. He was\r\nnot working at any machine to clean, dye, dry, or press clothing. He\r\nlooked at the two individuals whom Fitzgerald had seen enter only\r\nfractions of a minute earlier. His jaw clenched, and Fitzgerald was\r\nclose enough behind the bottle-breakers to see him take an angry,\r\npurposeful step toward them. Then he checked himself very deliberately,\r\nand put his hands in his pockets, and watched. After an instant he even\r\ngrinned at the two figures who had preceded the detective.\r\n\r\nThey were an impressive pair. They were dressed in well-pressed garments\r\nof extravagantly fashionable cut. They wore expensive soft hats, tilted\r\nto jaunty angles. Even from the rear, Fitzgerald knew that handkerchiefs\r\nwould show tastefully in the breast pockets of their coats. Their shoes\r\nhad been polished until they not only shone, but glittered. But by\r\nprofessional instinct Fitzgerald noted one cauliflower ear, and the\r\nbarest fraction of a second later he saw a squat revolver being waved\r\nnegligently at the screaming women.\r\n\r\nHe reached for his service revolver. And things happened.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe situation was crystal-clear. Big Jake Connors was displeased with\r\nBrink. In all the city whose rackets he was developing and\r\nconsolidating, Brink was the only man who resisted Big Jake's civic\r\nenterprise--and got away with it! And nobody who runs rackets can permit\r\nresistance. It is contagious. So Big Jake had ordered that Brink be\r\nbrought into line or else. The or else alternative had run into snags,\r\nbefore, but it was being given a big new try.\r\n\r\nThere was the shrill high clamor of two women screaming at the tops of\r\ntheir voices because revolvers were waved at them. One Elite employee,\r\nat the pressing machine, took his foot off the treadle and steam\r\nbillowed wildly. Another man, at a giant sheet-iron box which rumbled,\r\nstared with his mouth open and blood draining from his cheeks. Brink,\r\nalone, looked--quite impossibly--amused and satisfied.\r\n\r\n\"Get outside!\" snarled a voice as Fitzgerald's revolver came out ready\r\nfor action. \"This joint is finished!\"\r\n\r\nThe companion of the snarling man rubbed suddenly at his eye. He rubbed\r\nagain, as if it twitched violently. But it was, after all, only a\r\ntwitching eyelid. He reached negligently down and picked up a wooden\r\nbox. By its markings, it was a dozen-bottle box of spot-remover--the\r\nstuff used to get out spots the standard cleaning fluid in the\r\ndry-cleaning machine did not remove.\r\n\r\nThe man heaved the box, with the hand with which he had rubbed his\r\ntwitching eye. The other man raised a hand--the one not holding a\r\nrevolver--to rub at his own eye, which also seemed to twitch agitatedly.\r\n\r\nDetective Sergeant Fitzgerald had his revolver out. He drew in his\r\nbreath for a stentorian command for them to drop their weapons. But he\r\ndidn't have time to shout. The hurtling small box of spot-remover struck\r\nthe large sheet-iron case from which loud rumblings came. It was a\r\ndryer; a device for spinning clothes which were wet with liquid from the\r\ndry-cleaning washer. A perforated drum revolved at high speed within it.\r\nThe box of spot-remover hit the door. The door dented in, hit the\r\nhigh-speed drum inside, and flew frantically out again, free from its\r\nhinges and turning end-for-end as it flew. It slammed into the thrower's\r\ncompanion, spraining three fingers as it knocked his revolver to the\r\nfloor. The weapon slid merrily away to the outer office between\r\nDetective Fitzgerald's feet.\r\n\r\nBut this was not all. The dryer-door, having disposed of one threatening\r\nrevolver, slammed violently against the wall. The wall was merely a thin\r\npartition, neatly paneled on the office side, but with shelves\r\ncontaining cleaning-and-dyeing supplies on the other. The impact shook\r\nthe partition. Dust fell from the shelves and supplies. The hood who\r\nhadn't lost his gun sneezed so violently that his hat came off. He bent\r\nnearly double, and in the act he jarred the partition again.\r\n\r\nThings fell from it. Many things. A two-gallon jar of extra-special\r\ndetergent, used only for laces, conked him and smashed on the floor\r\nbefore him. It added to the stream of fluid already flowing with\r\nsingular directness for the open, double, back-door of the workroom. The\r\nhood staggered, sneezed again, and convulsively pulled the trigger of\r\nhis gun. The bullet hit something which was solid heavy metal,\r\nricocheted, ricocheted again and the second hood howled and leaped\r\nwildly into the air. He came down in the flowing flood of spilled\r\ndetergent, flat on his stomach, and with marked forward momentum. He\r\nslid. The floor of the plant had recently been oiled to keep down dust.\r\nThe coefficient of friction of a really good detergent on top of\r\nfloor-oil is remarkably low,--somewhere around point oh-oh-nine. Hood\r\nnumber two slid magnificently on his belly on the superb lubrication\r\nafforded by detergent on top of floor-oil.\r\n\r\nThe first hood staggered. Something else fell from the shelf. It was a\r\ncarton of electric-light bulbs. Despite the protecting carton, they went\r\noff with crackings like gunfire. Technically, they did not explode but\r\nimplode, but the hood with the revolver did not notice the difference.\r\nHe leaped--and also landed in the middle of the wide streak of\r\ndetergent-over-oil which might have been arranged to receive him.\r\n\r\nHe remained erect, but he slid slowly along that shining path. His\r\nrelatively low speed was not his fault, because he went through all the\r\nmotions of frenzied flight. His legs twinkled as he ran. But his feet\r\nslid backward. He moved with a sort of dignified celerity, running fast\r\nenough for ten times the speed, upon a surface which had a frictional\r\ncoefficient far below that of the smoothest possible ice.\r\n\r\nDetective Sergeant Fitzgerald gaped, his mouth dropped open and his gun\r\nheld laxly in a practically nerveless hand.\r\n\r\nThe thing developed splendidly. The prone gunman slid out of the wide\r\ndouble door, pushing a bow-wave of detergent before him. He slid across\r\nthe cement just outside, into the open garage whose delivery-truck was\r\nabsent, and slammed with a sort of deliberate violence into a stack of\r\nfour cardboard drums of that bone-black which is used to filter\r\ncleaning-fluid so it can be used over again in the dry-cleaning machine.\r\nThe garage was used for storage as well as shelter for the\r\nestablishment's truck.\r\n\r\nThe four drums were not accurately piled. They were three and a half\r\nfeet high and two feet in diameter. They toppled sedately, falling with\r\na fine precision upon the now hatless, running, sliding hood. One of\r\nthem burst upon him. A second burst upon the prone man--who had butted\r\nthrough the cardboard of the bottom one on his arrival. There was a\r\ndense black cloud which filled all the interior of the garage. It was\r\nbone-black, which cannot be told from lamp-black or soot by the\r\nuninitiated.\r\n\r\nFrom the cloud came a despairing revolver shot. It was pure reflex\r\naction by a man who had been whammed over the head by a\r\nhundred-and-fifty-pound drum of yielding--in fact bursting--material.\r\nThere was a metallic clang. Then silence.\r\n\r\nIn a very little while the dust-cloud cleared. One figure struggled\r\ninsanely. Upon him descended--from an oil drum of cylinder-oil stored\r\nabove the rafters--a tranquil, glistening rod of opalescent\r\ncylinder-oil. His last bullet had punctured the drum. Oil turned the\r\nbone-black upon him into a thick, sticky goo which instantly gathered\r\nmore bone-black to become thicker, stickier, and gooier. He fought it,\r\nwhile his unconscious companion lay with his head in a crumpled\r\ncardboard container of more black stuff.\r\n\r\nThe despairing, struggling hood managed to get off one more shot, as if\r\ndefying even fate and chance. This bullet likewise found a target. It\r\nburst a container of powdered dye-stuff, also stored overhead. The\r\ncontainer practically exploded and its contents descended in a\r\nwidespread shower which coated all the interior of the garage with a\r\nlovely layer of bright heliotrope.\r\n\r\nMaybe the struggling hood saw it. If so, it broke him utterly. What had\r\nhappened was starkly impossible. The only sane explanation was that he\r\nhad died and was in hell. He accepted that explanation and broke into\r\nsobs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDetective Sergeant Fitzgerald had witnessed every instant of the\r\nhappening, but he did not believe it. Nevertheless, he said in a strange\r\nvoice: \"I'll phone for the paddy-wagon. It'll do for a ambulance, in\r\ncase of need.\"\r\n\r\nHe put away his unused service revolver. Thinking strange, dizzy\r\nthoughts of twitching eyelids and plastic scraps and starkly incredible\r\nhappenings, he managed to call for the police patrol. When he hung up,\r\nhe gazed blankly at the wall. He gazed, in fact, at a spot where a\r\npeculiar small machine with no visible function reposed--somewhat\r\ndusty--on a shelf.\r\n\r\nBrink stepped over briskly and closed the door between the scene of\r\ncatastrophe and the immaculate shop. Somehow, none of the mess had\r\nspilled back through the doorway. Then he came in, frowning a little.\r\n\r\n\"The fight's out of them,\" he said cheerfully. \"One's got a bad cut on\r\nhis head. The other's completely unnerved. _Tsk! Tsk!_ I hate to have\r\nsuch things happen!\"\r\n\r\nSergeant Fitzgerald shook himself, as if trying to come back to a normal\r\nand a reasonable world.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" he said in a hoarse voice. \"I saw it, an' I still don't believe\r\nit! Things like this don't happen! I thought you might be lucky. It\r\nain't that. I thought I might be crazy. It ain't that! What has been\r\ngoin' on?\"\r\n\r\nBrink sat down. His air was one of wry contemplation.\r\n\r\n\"I told you I had a special kind of luck you couldn't believe. Did your\r\neyelids twitch any time today?\"\r\n\r\nFitzgerald swallowed.\r\n\r\n\"They did. And I stopped short an' something that should've knocked my\r\ncranium down my windpipe missed me by inches. An' again--But no matter.\r\nYes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe you can believe it, then,\" said Brink. \"Did you ever hear of a\r\nman named Hieronymus?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Fitzgerald in a numbed voice. \"Who's he?\"\r\n\r\n\"He got a patent once,\" said Brink, matter-of-factly, \"on a machine he\r\nbelieved detected something he called eloptic radiation. He thought it\r\nwas a kind of radiation nobody had noticed before. He was wrong. It\r\nworked by something called psi.\"\r\n\r\nSergeant Fitzgerald shook his head. It still needed clearing.\r\n\r\n\"Psi still isn't fully understood,\" explained Brink, \"but it will do a\r\nlot of things. For instance, it can change probability as magnetism can\r\nchange temperature. You can establish a psi field in a suitable\r\nmaterial, just as you can establish a magnetic field in steel or alnico.\r\nNow, if you spin a copper disk in a magnetic field, you get eddy\r\ncurrents. Keep it up, and the disk gets hot. If you're obstinate about\r\nit, you can melt the copper. It isn't the magnet, as such, that does the\r\nmelting. It's the energy of the spinning disk that is changed into heat.\r\nThe magnetic field simply sets up the conditions for the change of\r\nmotion into heat. In the same way ... am I boring you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Confusing me,\" said Fitzgerald, \"maybe. But keep on. Maybe I'll catch a\r\nglimmer presently.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the same way,\" said Brink, \"you can try to perform violent actions\r\nin a strong psi field--a field made especially to act on violence. When\r\nyou first try it you get something like eddy currents. Warnings. It can\r\nbe arranged that such psi eddy currents make your eyelids twitch. Keep\r\nit up, and probability changes to shift the most-likely consequences of\r\nthe violence. This is like a spinning copper disk getting hot. Then, if\r\nyou're obstinate about it, you get the equivalent of the copper disk\r\nmelting. Probability gets so drastically changed that the violent thing\r\nyou're trying to do becomes something that can't happen. Hm-m-m. ... You\r\ncan't spin a copper disk in a magnetic field when it melts. You can't\r\ncommit a murder in a certain kind of psi field when probability goes\r\nhog-wild. Any other thing can happen to anybody else--to you, for\r\nexample--but no violence can happen to the thing or person you're trying\r\nto do something violent to. The psi field has melted down ordinary\r\nprobabilities. The violence you intend has become the most improbable of\r\nall conceivable things. You see?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm beginnin',\" said Detective Sergeant Fitzgerald dizzily, \"I'm\r\nbeginnin' to get a toehold on what you mean. I'd hate to have to testify\r\nabout it in court, but I'm receptive.\"\r\n\r\n\"So my special kind of luck,\" said Brink, \"comes from antiviolence psi\r\nfields, set up in psi units of suitable material. They don't use up\r\nenergy any more than a magnet does. But they transfer it, like a magnet\r\ndoes. My brother-in-law thought he had to lose his business because Big\r\nJake threatened violent things. I offered to take it over and protect\r\nit--with psi units. So far, I have. When four hoods intended to shoot up\r\nthe place and moved to do it, they were warned. Psi 'eddy currents' made\r\ntheir eyelids twitch. They went ahead. Probability changed. Quite\r\nunlikely things became more likely than not. They were obstinate about\r\nit, and what they intended became perhaps the only thing in the world\r\nthat simply couldn't happen. So they crashed into a telephone pole. That\r\nwasn't violence. That was accident.\"\r\n\r\nThe detective blinked, and then nodded, somehow painfully.\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" he said uncertainly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Somebody set a bomb in my delivery truck,\" added Brink. \"I'm sure his\r\neyelids twitched, but he didn't stop. So probability changed. The\r\nexplosion of that bomb in my truck became the most unlikely of all\r\npossible things. In fact, it became impossible. So some electric\r\nconnection went bad, and it didn't go off. Again, when Jacaro intended\r\nto plant a time fire-bomb to set the plant on fire--why--his eyelids\r\nmust have twitched but he didn't give up the intention. So the psi unit\r\nnaturally made the burning of the plant impossible. For it to be\r\nimpossible, the fire-bomb had to go off where it would do next to no\r\nharm. Jacaro lost his pants.\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped. Detective Sergeant Fitzgerald swallowed carefully.\r\n\r\n\"I don't question it,\" he said dizzily, \"even if I don't believe it.\r\nWill you now tell me that what just happened was a psi something keepin'\r\nviolent things from happening?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it,\" agreed Brink. \"The psi unit made the dryer-door fly off and\r\nknock a pistol out of a man's hand. If they'd dropped the idea of\r\nviolence, that would have ended the matter. They didn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"I accept it,\" said Fitzgerald. He gulped. \"Because I saw it. A court\r\nwouldn't believe it, though, Mr. Brink!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been tryin' for months,\" said Fitzgerald in sudden desperation,\r\n\"to find a way to stop what Big Jake's doin'. But he's tricky. He's\r\norganized. He's got smart lawyers. Mr. Brink, if the cops could use what\r\nyou've got--\" Then he stopped. \"It'd never be authorized,\" he said\r\nbitterly. \"They'd never let a cop try it.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" agreed Brink. \"Until it's believed in it can only be used\r\nprivately, for private purposes. Like I've used it. Or Hm-m-m. Do you\r\nfish, or bowl, or play golf, sergeant? I could give you a psi unit\r\nthat'd help you quite a bit in such a private purpose.\"\r\n\r\nDetective Sergeant Fitzgerald shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Dry-fly fishin's my specialty,\" he said bitterly, \"but no thank you!\r\nWhen I'm pittin' myself against a trout, it's my private purpose to be a\r\nbetter fisherman than he's a fish. Usin' what you've got would be like\r\ndynamitin' a stream. No sport in that! No! But this Big Jake, he doesn't\r\nact sporting with the public. I'd give a lot to stop him.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd get no credit for it,\" said Brink. \"No credit at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd get the job done!\" said Fitzgerald indignantly. \"A man likes\r\ncredit, but he likes a lot better to get a good job done!\"\r\n\r\nBrink grinned suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"Good man!\" he said approvingly. \"I'll buy your idea, sergeant. If\r\nyou'll play fair with a trout, you'll play fair with a crook, and an\r\nIrishman, anyhow, has a sort of inheritance--I'll give you what help I\r\ncan, and you'll do things your grandfather would swear was the work of\r\nthe Little People. And for a first lesson--\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Big Jake discourages me,\" said Brink. \"So I'll call him up and say I'm\r\ncoming to see him. I'll say if he wants this business I'll sell it to\r\nhim at a fair price. But I'll say otherwise I'll tell the newspapers\r\nabout his threats and the four of his hoods in the hospital and the two\r\nothers on the way there. Want to come along?\"\r\n\r\nDetective Sergeant Fitzgerald reached his hand to where his service\r\nrevolver reposed in its holster. Then he drew it away.\r\n\r\n\"He's a very violent man,\" he said hopefully. \"I wouldn't wonder he\r\ntried to get pretty rough--him and the characters he has on his payroll.\r\nIf they have to be stopped from bein' violent by--what is it? Psi units?\r\nSure I'll come along! It'd ought to be most edifyin' to watch!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was a clanging outside. Brink and Detective Sergeant Fitzgerald\r\ndelayed while the two unnerved, helpless, and formerly immaculate gunmen\r\nwere loaded into the paddy-wagon and carried away--to the hospital that\r\nalready held four of their ilk. Then Brink called Big Jake on the\r\ntelephone.\r\n\r\nDetective Sergeant Fitzgerald listened with increasing appreciation as\r\nBrink made his proposition and explained matter-of-factly what had\r\nhappened to Big Jake's minions who should have wrecked the Elite\r\nCleaners and Dyers. When Brink hung up, Fitzgerald had a look of zestful\r\nanticipation on his face.\r\n\r\n\"He said to come right over,\" said Brink. \"But he was grinding his\r\nteeth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah-h-h!\" said Fitzgerald pleasurably. \"I'm thinkin' of the cab-drivers\r\nan' truck drivers that've been beat up. I'm thinkin' of property smashed\r\nand honest people scared.... Do you know, I'm terrible afraid Big Jake's\r\ntoo much in the habit of violence to stop, even if his eyelids twitch?\r\nIt's deplorable! But on a strictly personal basis I think I'll enjoy\r\nseein' Big Jake an' his hoods discouraged by ... what is it Psi units?\r\nYes!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he did. Big Jake's eyelids undoubtedly did twitch while he was\r\npreparing a reception for Brink and Detective Sergeant Fitzgerald. But\r\nhe did not heed the warning. He did not even think of the legal aspect\r\nof violent things attempted against his visitors. So he tried\r\nviolence--he and his associates. They started out with fists and clubs,\r\nregardless of discretion. They tried to beat up Brink and Fitzgerald.\r\nFrom that they went on to sawed-off shotguns. Their efforts were still\r\nunsuccessful. Then they went to extremes.\r\n\r\nFitzgerald wore an expression of pious joy as Big Jake Connors and his\r\naides, obstinately attempting violent actions, were prevented by psi\r\nunits.\r\n\r\nWhen it was all over, the ambulance had to make two trips.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END",
