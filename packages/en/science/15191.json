It is not a mere condensation from Encyclopædias,\r\nCommercial Dictionaries, and Parliamentary and Consular Reports; but\r\nis the fruit of my own Colonial experience as a practical planter and\r\nof much laborious research and studious investigation into a class of\r\nephemeral but useful publications, which seldom meet with any extended\r\nor enduring circulation--assisted, moreover, by the contributions and\r\nsuggestions of many of the most eminent agricultural chemists,\r\nplanters, and merchants of our Colonial Possessions and Foreign\r\nCountries.\r\n\r\nFew are aware of the great labor and research required for digesting\r\nand arranging conflicting accounts--for consulting the numerous\r\ndetached papers and foreign works treating of the subjects embraced in\r\nthis volume, and for referring to the home and colonial trade\r\ncirculars, Legislative papers, and scientific periodicals of different\r\ncountries. The harassing duties appertaining to the position of City\r\neditor of a daily paper, coupled with numerous other literary\r\nengagements, have afforded me insufficient time to do full justice to\r\nthe work while passing through the press; and several literal\r\ntypographical errors in the botanical names have, I find, escaped my\r\nattention in the revision of the sheets. I have, however, thought it\r\nscarcely necessary to make a list of errata for these. From want of\r\nleisure, to reduce all the weights and measures named in the body of\r\nthe work into English, I have given their relative value in the Index.\r\nI have taken considerable pains to make the Index most full and\r\ncomplete, for it has always appeared to me, that in works embracing a\r\ngreat variety of subjects, facility of reference is of paramount\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nSome discrepancy may here and there be found between the figures\r\nquoted from Parliamentary returns and those derived from private trade\r\ncirculars; but the statistics are accurate enough for approximate\r\ncalculations.\r\n\r\nWhilst the work has been passing through the press, several important\r\nmodifications and alterations have been made in our Tariff.\r\n\r\nI have throughout found great difficulty in obtaining commercial\r\ninformation from the various Colonial brokers and importers of the\r\nCity, who, with but few exceptions, have been stupidly jealous of any\r\npublicity respecting the staples in the sale of which they were\r\nspecially interested. The greatest fear was expressed lest any details\r\nas to the sources of supply, stocks on hand, and cost prices of many\r\nof the minor articles, should transpire. After the results of the\r\nGreat Exhibition, the exertions making to establish Trade Museums, and\r\nthe prospect of information to be furnished at the new Crystal Palace,\r\nthis narrow-minded and selfish feeling seems singularly misplaced.\r\n\r\nI had not originally contemplated touching upon the grain crops and\r\nfood plants of temperate regions; but the prospect of a failure in our\r\nharvest, the disturbed state of political affairs on the Continent,\r\nwith short supplies from Russia and the Danubian provinces, and the\r\nabsence of any reliable statistics and information for convenient\r\nreference on this all-important subject, added to the recommendations\r\nof one or two well-informed correspondents, induced me to go more into\r\ndetail on the Food-plants and Breadstuffs than I had at first\r\nintended, and to treat very fully upon Wheat, Barley, Potatoes, and\r\nother subsidiary food crops. This has trenched somewhat largely on my\r\nspace; and although the volume has been swelled to an unexpected size,\r\nI am reluctantly compelled to omit some few Sections, such as those\r\ntreating of elastic and other Gums, Resins, &c.; on tropical Fruits;\r\nand on textile substances and products available for cordage and\r\nclothing. The latter section, which includes Cotton, Flax, Jute, &c.,\r\nand embraces a wide and important range of plants, I propose issuing\r\nin a separate volume at an early date, with a large fund of\r\nstatistical and general information.\r\n\r\nAmong those gentlemen to whom I acknowledge myself most indebted for\r\nvaluable suggestions or important information, are my friends Sir R.H.\r\nSchomburgk, British Consul at St. Domingo, and Mr. R. Montgomery\r\nMartin, the well-known Statist and Colonial Historian; Mr. R.D.\r\nWodifield, Deputy Inspector of Imports at the port of London; Mr.\r\nLeonard Wray, of Natal, author of \"The Practical Sugar Planter;\" Dr.\r\nW. Hamilton, of Plymouth, a talented and frequent contributor to the\r\nscientific periodicals of the day; Mr. T.C. Archer, of Liverpool,\r\nauthor of \"Economic Botany;\" Mr. Greene, of the firm of Blyth,\r\nBrothers, and Greene; Mr. J.S. Christopher, author of several works on\r\nthe Cape Colony, and Natal; Mr. B.H. Strousberg, editor of \"The\r\nMerchant's Magazine,\" and Mr. G.W. Johnson, the eminent agricultural\r\nwriter, author of various elaborate \"Essays on the Agriculture of\r\nHindostan,\" which were written for my \"Colonial Magazine.\"\r\n\r\nP.L.

This,\r\n    however, has never happened in relation to any one art; in every\r\n    case manufacturers have had to make the best of the materials which\r\n    chance or accident has brought before them. It is strange and\r\n    startling, but nevertheless perfectly true, that even at the present\r\n    time there are many excellent and abundant productions of nature\r\n    with which not only our manufacturers, but, in some instances, even\r\n    our men of science, are wholly unacquainted. _There is not a single\r\n    book published which gives even tolerably complete information on\r\n    any one of the different classes of vegetable raw produce at present\r\n    under our consideration_. The truth of these remarks will be felt\r\n    strongly by any one who takes the trouble to examine any of these\r\n    great divisions of raw materials. He will obtain tolerably complete\r\n    information respecting most of those substances which are known in\r\n    trade and commerce; but of the greater number of those not known to\r\n    the broker, he will learn little or nothing. Men of science, for the\r\n    most part, look down upon such knowledge. The practical uses of any\r\n    substances, the wants and difficulties of the manufacturer, are\r\n    regarded as mere trade questions, vulgar and low--simple questions\r\n    of money. On the other hand, mere men of business do not feel the\r\n    want of such knowledge, because, in the first place, they are\r\n    ignorant of its existence, and secondly, because they do not see how\r\n    it could aid them or their business; and if it should happen that an\r\n    enterprising manufacturer desires to learn something of the\r\n    cultivation and production of the raw material with which he works,\r\n    he generally finds it quite impossible to obtain any really sound\r\n    and useful information. In such cases, if he is a man of energy and\r\n    of capital, he often is at the cost of sending out a perfectly\r\n    qualified person to some distant part of the globe, to learn for him\r\n    those practical details which he desires to know. This is no\r\n    uncommon thing; and many cases might be stated, showing the great\r\n    advantages which have arisen to those who have thus gained a march\r\n    upon their neighbours.\"\r\n\r\nThe Society of Arts, appreciating the importance of from time to time\r\nencouraging the introduction of new and improved products from our\r\nIndian and Colonial Possessions, has offered many gold medals as\r\npremiums for a great variety of staples from abroad.\r\n\r\nThe Great Exhibition of the Industry of all Nations brought together\r\nan immense variety of productions from tropical regions, of which the\r\nEnglish public were comparatively ignorant. Attracting public\r\nattention, as these necessarily did, information on the best modes of\r\ncultivating and manufacturing them will be peculiarly valuable to the\r\ncolonists, and is as eagerly sought after by many brokers, merchants\r\nand manufacturers at home.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the recent liberal policy of Great Britain, the\r\ncompetition of foreign countries, the want of cheap and abundant\r\nlabor, and other causes, those chief staples, Sugar and Coffee, which\r\nfor a series of years formed the principal and almost exclusive\r\narticles of production in our colonies, and which had met with a ready\r\nand remunerative sale in the British markets, have either fallen off\r\nto an alarming extent, or become so reduced in price as scarcely to\r\nrepay the cost of cultivation. The partial abandonment of the\r\ncultivation of these staples in our colonies has had the effect of\r\ncrippling the agricultural and commercial enterprise of several of our\r\nmost valuable foreign possessions, and throwing out of employment a\r\nnumber of persons: it behoves us, therefore, to direct attention to\r\nsome of the many minor articles in demand;--to those indigenous or\r\nexotic products of the soil in tropical regions, which, being\r\ninexpensive in cultivation and manufacture, might be undertaken with a\r\nmoderate outlay of labor and capital, and the certainty of a ready and\r\nremunerative sale in the European markets; and could moreover be\r\nattended to without neglecting or at all interfering with the\r\ncultivation of the leading staples.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the export wealth of tropical regions must be\r\nchiefly agricultural, the soil and climate being peculiarly fitted for\r\nthe culture of fruits, trees and plants yielding oils, gums, starch,\r\nspices, and other valuable products, which no art can raise cheaply in\r\nmore temperate latitudes. The large and continued emigration of\r\nfarmers and other enterprising persons from Britain and the Continent\r\nto Natal, the Cape Colony, Northern Australia, Ceylon, the East India\r\nCompany's Possessions and the Straits Settlements, Brazil, New\r\nGranada, and the Central American Republics, Texas, the Southern\r\nStates of North America, and other tropical and sub-tropical\r\ncountries, renders information as to the agriculture and productions\r\nof those regions highly desirable. Even to the settlers in our West\r\nIndian possessions, most of whom have too long pursued the old beaten\r\ntrack of culture and manufacture, comparatively regardless of modern\r\nimprovements and the results of chemical, scientific, and practical\r\ninvestigation, recent information on all these subjects, and a\r\ncomparison of the practices of different countries, cannot fail to be\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\nThere is much valuable information to be met with in detached papers\r\nand essays in the scientific periodicals of the day, and in colonial\r\nand other publications; such as the Transactions and Journals of the\r\ndifferent agricultural and horticultural societies of the East and\r\nWest Indies, the United States, Australia, &c., but none readily\r\naccessible for easy reference, and which the new settler, proceeding\r\nout to try his fortune in those fair and productive regions of the\r\nglobe, can turn to as a hand book. I have had much experience in\r\nTropical Agriculture, and for many years my attention has been mainly\r\ndirected to this important subject, for which purpose I have kept up a\r\nlarge and extended correspondence with numerous agricultural,\r\nscientific and other societies abroad; with experienced practical men,\r\nand have also received the leading journals of all the tropical\r\nColonies.\r\n\r\nNo one person could be expected to be thoroughly familiar with all the\r\ndifferent modes of culture and preparation of every one of the\r\nnumerous products to be described in this volume; but where my own\r\nagricultural experience (of several years in the West Indies and South\r\nAmerica) was at fault, I have availed myself of the practical\r\nknowledge of those of my colonial friends and correspondents best\r\ninformed on the subject, and am particularly fortunate in having many\r\nvaluable essays on Tropical Agriculture scattered through the\r\ndifferent volumes of my \"Colonial Magazine.\"\r\n\r\nThe discussion of the best modes of culture, properties, manufacture,\r\nconsumption, uses, and value of the commercial products of the\r\nvegetable kingdom cannot be without its value, and the attention of\r\nmerchants and planters may be usefully directed to various articles,\r\nwhich will be profitable both in an agricultural and commercial point\r\nof view; many of which are already sources of wealth to other\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of new objects of industry into the colonial\r\ndependencies of the British Empire, is no longer considered a mere\r\nsubject of speculation, but one well worthy the attention of the eye\r\nof science; and the fostering hand of care is beginning to be held out\r\nto productions of nature and art, which, if not all equally necessary\r\nto the welfare of man, yet certainly merit the attention of the\r\ncultivator and capitalist, and have great claims on the scientific\r\nobserver, and on those interested in raising the manufactures of our\r\ncountry to a higher standard.\r\n\r\nFew who have not investigated this subject are aware of the immense\r\nnumber of countries lying in the equatorial and tropical ranges of the\r\ntorrid zone, many of which, from the value and importance of their\r\nindigenous productions, have already attracted considerable notice,\r\nand to which still more attention will be directed by European nations\r\nas the value of their various products becomes more extensively known.\r\n\r\nThe homeward commerce which we carry on with our numerous Colonies,\r\nwith our Indian Possessions, and with foreign countries, is\r\nprincipally in articles furnished by the vegetable kingdom, such as\r\nthe cereal grains, wheat, rice, maize, &c.; vegetables used in\r\npreparing dietetic drinks and distilled liquors, as tea, coffee,\r\ncacao, and the sugar cane, grapes, &c.; spices and condiments; drugs;\r\ndyes and tanning substances, obtained from the bark, leaves, fruit,\r\nand roots of various herbs and trees; the expressed or distilled oils\r\nof different plants; fruits in the green, dried, or preserved state;\r\nstarches obtained from the roots or trunks of many farinaceous plants;\r\nfibrous substances used for cordage, matting, and clothing, as cotton,\r\nIndian hemp, flax, coco-nut coir, plantain and pine-apple fibre;\r\ntimber and fancy woods. These substances, in the aggregate, form at\r\nleast nine-tenths in value of the whole imports of this country. There\r\nare also several products of the animal kingdom dependent on vegetable\r\nculture, which might be brought into this category, such as silk and\r\ncochineal. Very few of these products of the vegetable kingdom come to\r\nus in any other than an unmanufactured state; they are shipped to this\r\ncountry as the chief emporium and factory of the world, either for\r\nre-export or to be prepared for consumption by the millions to whom\r\nthey furnish employment, sustenance, and articles of clothing.\r\n\r\nIt is a wise ordination of Providence, that the different nations of\r\nthe earth are as it were mutually dependent on each other for many of\r\nthe necessaries and luxuries of life, and the means of progress and\r\ncivilization. Commerce is thus extended, the various arts and\r\nmanufactures improved by comparison and competition; and the acres yet\r\nuntilled in distant lands hold out strong inducements for immigration,\r\ntheir climate and products affording health, freedom, and independence\r\nto the over-tasked and heavily taxed artisan and agriculturist of\r\nEurope. Although the systems of tropical agriculture, generally\r\npursued, are peculiar and effective, yet there is no doubt that much\r\nimprovement remains to be carried out in the practices adopted, in the\r\nimplements employed, and the machinery used for preparing the crops\r\nfor shipment. In the British Isles our insulated position, limited\r\nextent of country, unsettled climate, and numerous population,\r\naggregated in dense masses, have compelled us to investigate and avail\r\nourselves of every improvement in agriculture, arts and manufactures,\r\nwhich experience, ingenuity, and a comparison with the customs of\r\nother countries, have placed at our disposal.\r\n\r\nIf we except sandy deserts, and some of the interior portions of the\r\npolar regions, it will be found that there is scarcely any country but\r\nwhat is capable of improvement. Indeed, so extensive are the resources\r\nof agriculture, that further improvements may be most easily effected.\r\n\r\nLet us then examine and ascertain what new objects may be improved\r\nupon, and if by our speculations only one single article, either for\r\nfood or use, is added to those already in use, or those that are\r\nalready cultivated be improved upon, it is equivalent to an increase\r\nof our wealth.\r\n\r\nAn eminent writer has truly remarked that \"Agriculture is the parent\r\nof Manufactures, seeing that the productions of nature are the\r\nmaterials of art.\"\r\n\r\nIn the economy of Providence every fragment of creation seems to\r\nunfold, as man progresses in the arts of life, unbounded capabilities\r\nof adaptation to his every want. We have, indeed, daily illustration\r\nof the truth of that trite and homely adage, that \"nothing is made in\r\nvain.\"\r\n\r\nThat quaint old English poet, Herbert, who flourished in the fifteenth\r\ncentury, in a short poem on \"Providence,\" has graphically described,\r\nin his unique vein, the sentiment which forces itself upon us in view\r\nof the numerous discoveries of the age in which we live:--\r\n\r\n\"All countries have enough to serve their need.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    ----The Indian nut alone\r\n    Is clothing, meat and trencher, drink and can,\r\n    Boat, cable, sail, and needle, all in one.\"\r\n\r\n\"The addition (it has been well observed) of even a single flower, or\r\nan ornamental shrub, to those which we already possess, is not to be\r\nregarded as a matter below the care of industry and science. The more\r\nwe extend our researches into the productions of nature, the more are\r\nour minds elevated by contemplating the variety as well as the\r\nexceeding beauty and excellence of the works of the Creator.\"\r\n\r\nThe mode of arrangement of the various subjects treated of involved\r\nsome consideration; two or three plans were open for adoption. 1st. To\r\ndescribe the several products in the order of their agricultural\r\nimportance or commercial value. 2nd. An alphabetical reference, in the\r\nstyle of a Dictionary or Encyclopædia; and 3rd. Classifying them under\r\nsubdivisions, according to their particular or chief uses. The last\r\nseemed to me the most desirable and efficient mode, although open to\r\nsome objections, from the variety of uses to which different parts of\r\nmany plants were applied. Some, as cotton, indigo, sugar, coffee, tea,\r\n&c., would readily fall into their proper division, but others, as the\r\ncoco-nut, plantain, &c., from the variety of their products, would\r\ncome under several heads. I have, however, endeavoured to meet this\r\ndifficulty by placing each plant or tree under the section to which\r\nits most valuable production seemed naturally to refer it.\r\n\r\nThere are very many plants and substances which have been passed over\r\naltogether, it being impossible, within the limits of a moderate sized\r\nvolume, to bring under notice even a tithe of the valuable grasses,\r\ntimber trees, cabinet woods, fruits, &c.; and I have confined myself\r\nin a great measure to those which either already are, or might easily\r\nbe rendered, articles of commerce, of some importance. I have shown\r\ntheir present value by quoting the current prices, and brought down,\r\nas far as possible, the statistics of each article to the close of\r\nlast year, thus rendering the work valuable by commercial references\r\nwhich could not be found collectively elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThere are some articles of commerce which could not properly be\r\ntreated of in a work intended as a guide on agriculture and husbandry,\r\nfor the tropical planter and cultivator, who purposes devoting his\r\nattention to the raising of useful crops and plants on his estate. The\r\nforests and jungles of the tropics abound in products of an useful\r\ncharacter, the luxurious and spontaneous growth of nature, such as\r\nebony, sandal wood, &c.; but these must be sought for by a different\r\nclass of settlers; and the mahogany cutter of Honduras, the\r\nteak-feller of India, the gatherer of elastic gums, can scarcely be\r\nranked with the cultivators of the soil.\r\n\r\nI had originally intended to confine my remarks to staples of tropical\r\ngrowth, but I have been induced to depart from my prescribed plan by\r\nthe importance of some of the commercial products of temperate\r\nregions, such as maple and beet-root sugar, wheat, the grain crops,\r\nand potatoes.\r\n\r\nThe system of agriculture, and modes of tillage, &c., of separate\r\ncountries in the Eastern and Western hemisphere, notwithstanding their\r\nsimilarity of climate, are as opposite as if each country belonged to\r\na different zone; and yet much may be learned by one of the other.\r\n\r\nThe only essentially useful division of seasons in countries within\r\nthe tropics is into a wet and dry season, the former being the period\r\nof germination, the latter that of fructification.\r\n\r\nThe implements of agriculture required are for the most part few and\r\nsimple, for no high tillage is necessary, the luxuriance of vegetation\r\nbeing so great that most of the products of the soil will grow\r\nindiscriminately throughout the year, and the only care of the\r\nhusbandman, after the first preparation of the soil, is to keep down\r\nthe vast growth of weeds, which might stifle the crops.\r\n\r\nIn tropical regions there is less demand for manures than in temperate\r\nclimates, but still there are many additions to the soil that may\r\nprofitably be made.\r\n\r\nFirstly, that most important principle, which has only recently been\r\npractically inculcated, is in too many quarters entirely neglected,\r\nnamely, returning to the soil the component parts taken off by various\r\ncrops, and which is so generally practised in all good agricultural\r\ndistricts, by a careful rotation of crops. Liebig has well pointed out\r\nthis: \"It must be admitted (he says), as a principle of agriculture,\r\nthat those substances which have been removed from a soil must be\r\ncompletely restored to it; and whether this restoration be effected by\r\nmeans of excrements, ashes, or bones, is in a great measure a matter\r\nof indifference.\" Again he remarks, \"We could keep our fields in a\r\nconstant state of fertility by replacing every year as much as we\r\nremove from them in the form of produce; but an increase of fertility,\r\nand consequent increase of crop, can only be obtained when we add more\r\nto them than we take away.\" Of all natural manures, therefore, the\r\nbest for each description of plant is its own refuse, or ashes; enough\r\nof these can seldom, however, be obtained. But, as far as they can be\r\nrestored, this principle is beginning to be acted upon by the sugar\r\nplanters of the West Indies, who employ the waste leaves and ashes of\r\nthe expressed stalk of the cane, after it has been used as fuel, to\r\nmanure their cane-fields. The vine growers of Germany and the Cape\r\nalso bury the cuttings of their vines around the roots of the plants.\r\nThe cinnamon grower of the East returns the waste bark and cuttings of\r\nthe shoots to the soil. And in the coco-nut groves of Ceylon, the\r\nroots of the trees are best manured with the husks of the nuts and\r\ndecomposed poonac, or the refuse cake, after the oil has been\r\nexpressed from the pulp. Analysis of soils is, perhaps, not so\r\nessential in countries where virgin land is usually in abundance, and\r\nthe luxuriance of vegetation furnishes itself, by decomposition,\r\nabundant materials for replenishing the fertility of the soil. But\r\nthere are some substances, such as muriate of soda, gypsum, phosphate,\r\nand other compounds of lime, which may be advantageously applied.\r\nGuano and expensive artificial manures, are seldom required, and,\r\nindeed, will not repay the planters for importing.\r\n\r\nAn experienced cultivator can generally judge by a superficial\r\nexamination, aided by the situation, locality, and appearance of the\r\nsoil, whether a certain portion of land is fitted for the profitable\r\ngrowth of any particular plant. Depth of soil, and facilities for\r\ndeepening it, with the nature of the subsoil, so as to know whether it\r\nretains or parts with water, are also important considerations,\r\nbecause tap-rooted plants require free scope for penetrating deep into\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nA due supply of water is of vital importance to most crops--and\r\ntherefore the extent and periods of the fall of rain are essential to\r\nbe known, as it is not always possible to resort to irrigation. The\r\nquantity of labor required for previous tillage, cultivation, and\r\nharvesting of different crops, and the available supply, are primary\r\nessentials to be considered before entering upon the culture of any\r\nstaple product, however remunerative it may appear in prospective.\r\nFacility and cost of transport to the nearest market or shipping port\r\nare the next desiderata to be ascertained, as well as a careful\r\nestimate of the cost of plant or machinery necessary.\r\n\r\nIt may be desirable at the outset to make a brief enumeration of the\r\ncountries lying within the different zones, and the agricultural\r\nproducts of which come, therefore, more especially under the notice of\r\nthe tropical planter.\r\n\r\nMeyen, in his division of the horizontal range of vegetation into\r\nzones, extends--\r\n\r\n1. The equatorial zone to fifteen degrees on both sides of the\r\nequator. In this division we shall find the Cape Verd Islands, Sierra\r\nLeone, Ascension, and St. Helena, the Republic of Liberia, the\r\nEuropean and native settlements in the Gulf of Guinea, and on the\r\nwestern Coast of Africa, Abyssinnia, Zanzibar on the East Coast,\r\nMocha and Aden in the Red Sea, the northern portion of Madagascar, the\r\nSeychelles, the Madras Presidency, Northern India, Ceylon and the\r\nNicobar Islands, Sumatra, Siam, Malacca, Singapore and the Straits\r\nSettlements, Cochin China, the Phillippine Islands, Borneo, Celebes\r\nand the Moluccas, Java and Madura, Banca, the Johore Archipelago,\r\nTimor and the eastern group of Islands, with New Guinea, a large\r\nportion of Northern Australia, the Marquesas, Society's and other\r\noceanic islands. In South America the Republics of Peru, Bolivia,\r\nEcuador, New Granada, and Venezuela, British, French and Dutch Guiana,\r\nand a large portion of the empire of Brazil; Trinidad, Barbados, and\r\nmost of the islands in the Carribean Sea.\r\n\r\nThis zone has a mean temperature of 78½ to 82½ Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\n2. The tropical zone reaches from the 15th deg. on each side of the\r\nequator to the tropics in 23 lat. The mean temperature is 73½ to 78¾\r\ndeg. Summer temperature 80½ to 86 deg.; winter temperature in the\r\neastern coast districts, 59 deg.\r\n\r\nIn this region is comprised the following countries:--Sandwich Isles,\r\nCanton, in province of China, Burmah, Calcutta, and a portion of the\r\nBengal Presidency, the Bombay Presidency, Madagascar, Mauritius and\r\nBourbon; the southern portion of Brazil, Cuba, St. Domingo, Mexico,\r\nand Central America.\r\n\r\n3. The sub-tropical zone extends from the tropics 23 to 34 deg. of\r\nlatitude. There are a number of tropical fruits in this region. The\r\nwinters are mild and vegetation is green throughout the year. In the\r\nnorthern division of the zone palms and bananas grow on the plains. In\r\nthis region is comprised all the extreme northern portions of Africa,\r\ncoasting the Mediterranean, comprising Algiers and the Barbary States,\r\nEgypt, part of Persia, Cabool and the Punjab; the greater portion of\r\nChina, Lower California, Texas, the South-Western States of America,\r\nthe Bermudas, the Cape Colony and Natal, New South Wales, Southern and\r\nWestern Australia--the Government settlements in the Northern Island\r\nof New Zealand, the largest portion of Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay and\r\nthe Argentine Republics, the Provinces of Brazil from St. Paul to Rio\r\nGrande, Madeira and the Canary Isles.\r\n\r\nTo define accurately the conditions of temperature which a plant\r\nrequires to maintain it in a flourishing condition we must ascertain\r\nwithin what limits its period of vegetation, may vary, and what\r\nquantity of heat it requires. This most remarkable circumstance was\r\nfirst observed by Boussingault, but unfortunately we do not as yet\r\npossess sufficiently accurate accounts of the conditions of culture in\r\nthe various regions of the earth, to enable us to follow out this\r\ningenious view in all its details. His theory is, that the time\r\nrequired by a plant to arrive at maturity is as the inverse ratio of\r\nthe temperature; therefore, knowing the mean temperature of any place,\r\nand the number of days which a plant takes to ripen, the time required\r\nat any other point more or less elevated, can easily be ascertained.\r\nPeter Purry, a native of Switzerland, who settled in Charleston in\r\nthe eighteenth century, in a memorial to the Duke of Newcastle, then\r\nSecretary of State, sets out with this postulate, that \"there is a\r\ncertain latitude on our globe, so happily tempered between the\r\nextremes of heat and cold, as to be more particularly adapted than any\r\nother for certain rich productions of the earth; among which are silk,\r\ncotton, indigo,\" &c.--and he fixes on the latitude of 33 deg., whether\r\nnorth or south, as the one of that peculiar character.\r\n\r\nThe following Table, showing the climate, duration and production of\r\ncertain plants cultivated in tropical America, is from the proceedings\r\nof the Agricultural Society of Grenada.

The\r\nconsumption of these in all civilized countries is immense,\r\nnotwithstanding that in many they have been fettered with heavy fiscal\r\nduties. The investigation of the culture of the plants from which they\r\nare obtained, and the manufacture of the products, is a very curious\r\nobject of research.\r\n\r\n\r\nCACAO OR COCOA.\r\n\r\nThe chocolate nuts or seeds, termed cacao, are the fruit of species of\r\n_Theobroma_, an evergreen tree, native of the Western Continent. That\r\ncommonly grown is _T. cacao_; but Lindley enumerates two other\r\nspecies, _T. bicolor_, a native of New Granada; and _T. Guianensis_,\r\nwith yellow flowers, a native of Guiana. The seeds being nourishing\r\nand agreeable to most people, are kept in the majority of houses in\r\nAmerica, as a part of the provisions of the family. By pressure they\r\nyield fatty oil, called butter of cacao. They also contain a\r\ncrystalline principle analogous to caffeine, called theobromine. The\r\ncommon cacao of the shops consists generally of the roasted beans, and\r\nsometimes of the roasted integuments of the beans, ground to powder.\r\nThe consumption of cacao in the United Kingdom is about three millions\r\nof pounds annually, yielding a revenue of £15,500. Few tropical\r\nproducts are more valuable or more useful as food to man than cacao.\r\nIt is without any exception the cheapest food that we can conceive,\r\nand were it more generally employed, so that the berries should not be\r\nmore than two, three, or, at most, six months old, from the time of\r\ngathering (for, if kept longer, they lose their nutritive properties),\r\neven a smaller quantity than that usually taken in a cup would\r\nsuffice: in fact, cacao cannot be _too_ new. The cacao beans lie in a\r\nfruit somewhat like a cucumber, about five inches long and\r\nthree-and-a-half inches thick, which contains from twenty to thirty\r\nbeans, arranged in five regular rows with partitions between, and\r\nwhich are surrounded with a rose-colored spongy substance, like that\r\nof water melons. There are fruits, however, so large as to contain\r\nfrom forty to fifty beans. Those grown in the West India islands, as\r\nwell as Berbice and Demerara, are much smaller, and have only from six\r\nto fifteen; their development being less perfect than other parts of\r\nSouth America. After the maturation of the fruit, when their green\r\ncolour has changed to a dark yellow, they are plucked, opened, their\r\nbeans cleared of the marrowy substance, and spread out to dry in the\r\nair. In the West Indies they are immediately packed up for the market\r\nwhen they are dried; but in Caraccas they are subjected to a species\r\nof slight fermentation, by putting them into tubs or chests, covering\r\nthem with boards or stones, and turning them over every morning to\r\nequalize the operation. They emit a good deal of moisture, and lose\r\nthe natural bitterness and acrimony of their taste by this process, as\r\nwell as some of their weight. Instead of wooden tubs, pits or trenches\r\ndug in the ground are sometimes had recourse to for curing the beans;\r\nan operation called earthing. They are, lastly, exposed to the sun and\r\ndried. According to Lampadius, the kernels of the West India cacao\r\nbeans contain in 100 parts, besides water, 53.1 of fat or oil, 16.7 of\r\nan albuminous brown matter, which contains all the aroma of the bean;\r\n10.91 of starch, 7¾ of gum or mucilage, 0.9 of lignine, and 2.01 of a\r\nreddish dye-stuff, somewhat akin to the pigment of cochineal. The\r\nhusks form 12 per cent, of the weight of the beans. The fatty matter\r\nis of the consistence of tallow, white, of a mild agreeable taste, and\r\nnot apt to turn rancid by keeping. It melts only at 112 degrees Fahr.,\r\nand should, therefore, make tolerable candles. It is obtained by\r\nexposing the beans to strong pressure in canvas bags, after they have\r\nbeen steamed or soaked in boiling water for some time. From five to\r\nsix ounces of butter may be thus obtained from a pound of cacao. It\r\nhas a reddish tinge when first expressed, but it becomes white by\r\nboiling with water.\r\n\r\nThe beans, being freed from all spoiled and mouldy portions, are to be\r\ngently roasted over a fire in an iron cylinder, with holes in its ends\r\nfor allowing the vapors to escape, the apparatus being similar to a\r\ncoffee-roaster. When the aroma begins to be well developed, the\r\nroasting is known to be finished, and the beans must be turned out,\r\ncooled, and freed by fanning and sifting from their husks. The kernels\r\nare then to be converted into a paste, either by trituration in a\r\nmortar heated to 130 degrees Fahr., or by a powerful mill.[1] The\r\ncacao tree resembles our dwarf apple tree both in body and branches,\r\nbut the leaf, which is of a dark green, is considerably broader and\r\nlarger. The nuts are of the color and about the size of an almond, and\r\nhang eighteen to thirty together by a slender stringy film, enclosed\r\nin a pod. A ripe pod is of a beautiful yellow, intermixed with crimson\r\nstreaks; when dried, it shrivels up and changes to a deep brown; the\r\njuice squeezed from the mucilaginous pulp contained in the husks of\r\nthese nuts appears like cream, and has a very grateful taste of a\r\ncordial quality. The nuts have a light pleasant smell, and an\r\nunctuous, bitterish, roughish (not ungrateful) taste. Those of\r\nNicaragua and Caracas are the most agreeable and are the largest;\r\nthose of the French Antilles, and our own West India islands, are the\r\nmost unctuous.\r\n\r\nThe Mexicans, in preparing the chocolate paste, add some long pepper,\r\na little annatto, and lastly vanilla; some add cinnamon, cloves and\r\nanise, and those who love perfumes, musk and ambergris.\r\n\r\nThe finest American cacao is said to be that of Soconusco, but the\r\nprincipal imports are from Caracas and Guayaquil, which is of a very\r\ngood quality. The province of Barcelona, adjoining Caracas exports\r\nannually from 200,000 to 300,000 cwt.\r\n\r\nThe very large shipments from Guayaquil are shown by the following\r\nreturn. Of this quantity Spain takes the largest portion, Mexico the\r\nnext, and England receives but a very small quantity.\r\n\r\nCacao exported from Guayaquil:--\r\n\r\n                     lbs.\r\n  1833             6,605,786\r\n  1834            10,999,853\r\n  1835            13,800,851\r\n  1836            10,918,565\r\n  1837             8,520,121\r\n  1838             7,199,057\r\n  1839            12,169,787\r\n  1840            14,266,942\r\n\r\nThe exports of cacao from the port of La Guayra, has been as follows\r\nin the years ending December 31.\r\n\r\n                 Fanegas.\r\n  1850            40,181\r\n  1851            47,951\r\n  1852            54,083\r\n\r\nFive fanegas are equal to one English quarter. The price of cacao was,\r\nat the close of 1852, sixteen dollars the fanega.\r\n\r\nThe province of Caracas, according to Humboldt, at the end of the last\r\ncentury, produced annually 150,000 fanegas of cacao, of which\r\ntwo-thirds were exported to Spain, and the remainder locally consumed.\r\nThe shipments from the port of La Guayra alone averaged 80,000 to\r\n100,000, or nearly double the present shipments. In the early part of\r\nthe present century the captain-generalship of Caracas produced nearly\r\n200,000 fanegas, of which about 145,000 were sent direct to Europe.\r\nThe province of Caracas then produced 150,000 fanegas; Maracaibo,\r\n20,000; Cumana, 18,000, and New Barcelona, 5,000.\r\n\r\nThe vallies of Aragua, in the province of Caracas, those of Cariaco,\r\nCampano, of Rio Caribe and the banks of the river Caroni, in Spanish\r\nGuiana, produce excellent cacao in abundance.\r\n\r\nThe tree there bears fruit in four years after it has been planted,\r\nthe following year still more, and increases in fecundity until the\r\nninth or tenth year, when it is in full bearing.\r\n\r\nThe banks of the Magdalena, in the vicinity of Santa Martha and\r\nCarthagena, are famed for the excellent cacao they produce. \"This\r\ntree,\" says Bonnycastle (Spanish America, vol. 1, p. 257), \"is\r\nindigenous, seldom exceeds the diameter of seven inches, and is\r\nextremely beautiful when laden with its fruit, which are disposed on\r\nshort stalks over the stem and round the great branches, resembling\r\ncitrons, from their yellow color, and warty appearance. The leaves are\r\nattenuate, stalked, drooping, about a foot long and three inches\r\nbroad, elliptic, oblong, pointed, slightly wavy, entire, and very\r\nsmooth on both sides; with one mid-rib and many transverse ones,\r\nconnected by innumerable veins. The petals of the flower are yellow,\r\nthe calyx of a light rose-color, and the flowers themselves are small\r\nand placed on tufts on the sides of the branches, with single\r\nfoot-stalks, about an inch long. Its fruit is red, or a mixture of red\r\nand yellow, and about three inches in diameter, with a fleshy rind\r\nhalf-an-inch thick; the pulp is whitish and of the consistence of\r\nbutter, containing the seed; these seeds are generally twenty-five in\r\nnumber in each fruit, and when first gathered are of a flesh color,\r\nand form a nice preserve if taken just before they are ripe. Each tree\r\nyields about two or three pounds of fruit annually, and comes to\r\nmaturity the third year after planting from the seed; it also bears\r\nleaves, flowers, or fruit all the year round, the usual seasons for\r\ngathering being June and December. The excellence of the Magdalena\r\nchocolate may be attributed to the moist nature of the soil, as the\r\nplant never thrives where the ground is hard and dry, or cannot be\r\nirrigated.\"\r\n\r\n_Mode of cultivation in the Colombian Republics_--Plantations of cacao\r\nwere speedily multiplied in Colombia, and the soil so admirably\r\nseconded the labors of the planter, that in the produce abundance was\r\nunited to excellence. The cacao of this quarter ranks next to that of\r\nSoconusco. It is well known that the best commercial recommendation of\r\ncacao is that of coming from Caracas. But even in these provinces the\r\nquality varies. The cacao of Orituco is superior to that of other\r\nplaces, and a quantity of equal bulk weighs twenty per cent. more. The\r\ncacao of the coast comes next, and obtains a preference over that of\r\nthe interior.\r\n\r\nThe plantations of cacao are all to the north of the chain of\r\nmountains which coast the sea, and in the interior country. The former\r\nextend from Cumana to the mouth of the Tocaygo; the latter are situate\r\nin the vallies of Tuy, Orituco, Ocumare, Cura, Marrin, Tare, Santa\r\nTheresa, Santa Lucia, Zuapira, Santa Philippo, Barquisimeto, Valencia,\r\nGruige and Cariaco.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of soil are not equally adapted to the culture of cacao,\r\nstill less are all exposures; but an analysis of the soil destined to\r\nthis culture never furnishes indications on which reliance can be\r\nplaced. No regard should be had to color or composition; it is only\r\nrequisite that it should be friable to a certain depth, which is\r\nascertained by the size of the trees with which it is covered; this\r\nsign determines the land proper for cacao.\r\n\r\nA suitable situation is not so easily found. It should be exposed as\r\nlittle as possible to the north, and be on the borders of a river,\r\nwhich may communicate moisture to the soil in dry seasons, and\r\nreceive its drainings in times of rain. A preference is particularly\r\nto be given to land which can receive from the river the benefits of\r\nirrigation without being exposed to injury from its overflow.\r\n\r\nAfter having chosen the land, it should be cleared of all trees,\r\nshrubs, and other plants. This operation is performed in various ways.\r\nIt is customary in Colombia to commence felling the trees immediately\r\nafter the rains, that is, about the month of November; the wood, after\r\nbeing cut, is left to dry, then collected in heaps and burnt.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the new plantation is cleared, it is crossed with small\r\nditches, in directions according to the declivity of the soil. These\r\nserve to drain the stagnant waters, to carry off the rains, and to\r\nirrigate or water the soil whenever necessary. The _alignement_ is\r\nthen laid out, in which the cacao trees are to be arranged. They are\r\nplanted in triangles or squares. In either case, there is always in\r\nthe centre an alley, bordered by cacao trees, and running from east to\r\nwest. When they are planted in squares, this alley is crossed by\r\nanother running from north to south. The cacao plants should be placed\r\nat fifteen or sixteen feet (French measure) from each other, in good\r\nsoil; and about thirteen or fourteen feet in soil of inferior quality.\r\n\r\nThis is almost the only tree in nature to which the enlivening beams\r\nof the sun are obnoxious. It requires to be sheltered from their\r\nardour; and the mode of combining this protection with the principles\r\nof fertility, forms a very essential part of the skill which its\r\ncultivation demands. The cacao tree is mingled with other trees, which\r\nguard it from the rays of the sun, without depriving it of the benefit\r\nof their heat. The _Erythrina_ and the banana are employed for this\r\npurpose. The latter, by the rapidity of its growth, and the magnitude\r\nof its leaves, protect it for the first year. The erythrina endures at\r\nleast as long as the cacao; it is not every soil, however, that agrees\r\nwith it. It perishes after a while in sandy and clayey ground, but it\r\nflourishes in such as combine those two ingredients.\r\n\r\nIn the Antilles this protection cannot be given to cacao, as it would\r\nexpose the plantation to destruction by every hurricane. Besides, the\r\ncacao succeeds but indifferently there, and is much less oily than in\r\nother parts.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the soil, and the species of the erythrina, should\r\ndetermine the distance at which they ought to be placed. That kind\r\nwhich the Spaniards call _bucare anaveo_, is planted in a fertile\r\nsoil, at the distance of two alleys, that is to say, at each second\r\nrange of cacao trees. That which they call _bucare peonio_, is placed\r\nat three alleys in good soils (about forty-eight French feet).\r\n\r\nThe former species of erythrina is that which elevates itself the\r\nhighest. The second species has many thorns, the upper surface of the\r\nleaf is darker and the lower whiter. Both kinds should be cut in the\r\nwane of the moon, and remain in the shade until its increase, at\r\nwhich time they should be planted. It is much preferable, however, to\r\ntake them from a nursery.\r\n\r\nIn one range of cacao trees a banana is placed between two cacaos, and\r\nan erythrina between the two following. In the other range a banana is\r\nplaced between each cacao tree, and no erythrinas, so that the latter\r\nare at the distance of two alleys. The banana and the erythrina are\r\nfirst planted, and when a shelter from the sun is thus provided, the\r\nhole for the cacao is made, around which are planted four stalks of\r\nthe yucca plant, at the distance of two feet from each other. At the\r\nend of two months the cacao is planted. The smaller the plant is, the\r\nbetter. There are, nevertheless, soils subject to worms where the\r\nsmall plants do not thrive; but, excepting in this particular, the\r\nsmall plants are preferable, because the large require more labor for\r\ntheir transportation and planting; many of them die, and those which\r\nsurvive bud and shoot forth, but are never of any value.\r\n\r\nThe cacao plant should not exceed thirty-six inches in size when\r\ntransplanted; if larger, it succeeds with difficulty, as will be\r\nshown.\r\n\r\nThe nurseries of cacao demand an excellent soil, well prepared, where\r\nthe water does not remain. They should be well sheltered from the sun.\r\nSmall knolls of earth are formed, in each of which are put two seeds\r\nof cacao, in such a manner that they are parallel with the level of\r\nthe ground. During the first twenty days the seeds are covered with\r\ntwo layers of banana or other leaves. If necessary, the ground is\r\nwatered; but the water is not suffered to remain. The most suitable\r\ntime for sowing is in November.\r\n\r\nWhere there is not a facility for watering, the planting of the cacao\r\nshould take place in the rainy season; but when the former is\r\npracticable, it is best to plant in dry weather and assist nature by\r\nirrigation, since it is then in the power of the cultivator to give\r\nthe exact quantity of moisture necessary. But, in all cases, care\r\nshould be taken that the plants are not wet in the interval between\r\ntheir being taken out of the ground and replanted.\r\n\r\nWhen the bananas grow old, they should be carefully felled, lest the\r\ncacaos should be injured by their accidental fall. They are totally\r\nremoved as soon as the erythrina yields sufficient shade; this\r\noperation gives more air to the trees of the plantation, and\r\nencourages their growth.\r\n\r\nUntil the cacao attains four feet in height, it is trimmed to the\r\nstem. If it shoots forth several branches, they are reduced to three,\r\nat equal distances; and, in proportion as the plant increases, the\r\nleaves which appear on the three branches are stripped off. If they\r\nbend much, and incline towards the earth, they are tied in bunches, so\r\nthat the tree may not remain crooked. The branches, which are trimmed,\r\nare cut at the distance of two fingers from the tree. The suckers\r\nwhich spring from the tree are also removed, as they only live at its\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\n_Enemies of the tree_.--The cacao trees should, as already stated,\r\nhave sufficient shade to prevent their being burned by the sun. If\r\nthey are much exposed to its rays, their branches are scattered,\r\ncrack, and the tree dies. They are also infested with worms, which\r\ngnaw the bark all around, then attack the interior and destroy them.\r\nThe only remedy which has hitherto been found, is to employ people to\r\nkill these worms, which are deposited by a small, scaly winged insect,\r\nwhich gnaws the tree; as soon as it hears the approach of its\r\ndestroyers, it lets itself fall, and trusts to its wings for safety.\r\n\r\nThe color of this insect is a mixture of ash color and white. If\r\npressed, it emits a sound something similar to the noise of water\r\nthrown on a very hot substance. It has two small horns on its head,\r\nthe points of which are directed upwards. It is so lively that, even\r\nwhen the head is separated from the body, it is a long time in dying.\r\nTo deposit its progeny it makes small holes in the tree.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the winter, or rainy season, another worm makes\r\nits appearance, which devours the leaves of the young cacao plant.\r\nThis species of worm is called _goaseme_, and they are in some years\r\nso abundant, that all the people of the plantation are solely employed\r\nin destroying them. This worm is four inches in length, and of the\r\nthickness of a finger. It is sometimes called _angaripola_, or Indian,\r\non account of the vivacity of its colors. It is believed that these\r\nworms are mediately produced by other large worms in the earth, from\r\nwhich are engendered butterflies, who lay their eggs on the leaves of\r\nthe cacao. These eggs are full of small worms, which feed on the\r\nleaves of the cacao, and appear in clusters of the size of a shilling.\r\nThey are sought and destroyed with great attention, as they occasion\r\nconsiderable damage. Those which escape lodge themselves in the earth,\r\nand in the succeeding year are changed into butterflies. At the time\r\nwhen the worm makes its appearance, it is necessary to make fires,\r\nwhich should not be so large as to injure the cacao, yet sufficient to\r\nattract and burn the butterfly.\r\n\r\nThe plantations of cacao in the valley of Tuy, the quarters of Marrin,\r\nCuba, Sabana, Ocumare, San Francis, &c., are subject to another\r\nspecies of worm called _rasquilla_. It multiplies in the dry seasons.\r\n\r\nThere are small insects, called by the Spaniards _accerredores_, of\r\nthe same figure with those which eat the bark of the cacao, but larger\r\nand of a blackish colour. They feed on the branches of the tree; are\r\nalways found upon those branches which they have cut; and the evil can\r\nonly be obviated by killing them.\r\n\r\nThe worms called _vachacos_ occasion also much damage. They eat the\r\nleaf and the flower. To destroy them it is necessary to seek them in\r\ntheir nests in the earth. Water is thrown on the spot, and stirred, as\r\nin making mortar. By this means their young are crushed, and the evil\r\nis diminished, if it be not entirely removed.\r\n\r\nA parasitical plant often attaches itself to a branch of the cacao\r\ntree which it covers over and causes to wither, by nourishing itself\r\nwith the substance of the plant. The only remedy is to remove it.\r\n\r\nWhen the cacao trees are in a bearing state, they are subject to a\r\ndisease called _tache_. This is a black taint, or stain, which attacks\r\nthe trees, encircling them below, and kills them. The mode of\r\npreservation is to make, in the beginning, a slight notch that shall\r\npierce the bark. But if the taint is extensive, it is necessary to cut\r\nall the affected part. It then exudes a liquid and is healed. The bark\r\nremains of a violet color in the part that has been tainted.\r\n\r\nThe other enemies of the cacao are the agouti, stag, squirrel, monkey,\r\n&c. The agouti produces most havoc. It often destroys in one night all\r\nthe hopes of the proprietor.\r\n\r\nBirds are not less injurious to the cacao. The whole class of parrots,\r\nin particular the great Ara, which destroys for the pleasure of\r\ndestroying, and, the parroquets, which come in numerous flocks,\r\nconspire also to ruin the plantations of cacao.\r\n\r\n_Means of preserving a plantation_.--It is necessary that a cacao\r\nplantation should have always shade and irrigation; the branches of\r\nthe plant should be cleared of the lichens that form on them; the\r\nworms destroyed; and no large herbs or shrubs and mosses permitted to\r\ngrow near, since the least disadvantage resulting therefrom would be\r\nthe loss of all the fruit that should fall into these thickets. But it\r\nis most essential to deepen the trenches which carry off the water, in\r\nproportion as the plant increases in size, and as the roots of course\r\npierce deeper; for if the trenches are left at a depth of three feet,\r\nwhile the roots are six feet in the earth, it follows that the lower\r\npart of the cacao plant is in a situation of too great humidity, and\r\nrots at the level of the water. This precaution contributes not only\r\nto make the plantation more durable, but also to render the crop more\r\nproductive. It is necessary, also, to abstain from cutting any branch\r\nfrom cacao plants that are already bearing. Such an operation might\r\noccasion the subsequent crop to be stronger; but the plants become\r\nenervated, and often perish, according to the quality of the soil and\r\nthe number of branches cut off.\r\n\r\nIf the earth of the plantations be pressed and trampled down by\r\nanimals, the duration of the plant is diminished. Irrigation, made\r\nwith judgment, maintains them long in a state of produce.\r\n\r\n_Withering of the fruit._--The fruit of the cacao withers on the tree\r\nfrom three causes:--\r\n\r\nFirst.--When the plantation is, during a long time, inundated with\r\nwater. I have seen plantations of cacao, which had only been covered\r\nwith water thirty hours, and of which the fruit was totally withered.\r\n\r\nSecond.--From abundant rains, particularly in very damp valleys. This\r\nis only to be remedied by keeping the plantation well drained, that\r\nthe water may not remain on it.\r\n\r\nThird.--A want of necessary irrigation, and the watering of the\r\nplantation under an ardent sun. The vapor from the earth kills the\r\nfruit. If the rains are deficient for a time, and an excessive rain\r\nsucceeds, the fruit of the cacao also withers.\r\n\r\nThis dessication or withering takes place everywhere; but in some\r\nplaces the surplus of fruit, which the tree is unable to nourish, is\r\nalone subject to it. In others, as Araquita and Caucagua, it withers\r\nin proportion to the northerly rains. An unsuitable soil occasions\r\nanother kind of decay. The pods become stinted, containing some good\r\nand some bad seeds. The Spaniards call this _cocosearse_, which means\r\ndefective.\r\n\r\n_Harvest of the cacao_.--The tree yields two principal crops in a\r\nyear, one about St. John's day, the other towards the end of December.\r\nThe cacao however ripens and is gathered during the whole year. But in\r\nall seasons the planters of the Central American republics make it a\r\npoint, so far as possible, to collect their crops only at the decline\r\nof the moon; because experience proves that this precaution renders\r\nthe cacao more solid, and less liable to spoil.\r\n\r\nTo collect the fruit, those negroes and Indians are employed who have\r\nthe sharpest sight, that only the ripe fruit may be gathered. The most\r\nrobust and active are chosen to carry it to the places where the beans\r\nare to be shaken out. The aged and maimed are employed to do this. The\r\noperation is performed on a floor well swept, and covered with green\r\nleaves, on which they place the cacao. Some open the pod, and others\r\nstrike out the beans with a small piece of wood, which must not be\r\nsharp, lest it should injure them.\r\n\r\nThe good and bad beans must not be mingled together. There are four\r\nsorts of cacao in every crop; the ripe and in good condition, the\r\ngreen but sound, the worm-eaten, and the rotten. The first quality is\r\nbest, the second is not bad; but the two others should be rejected.\r\n\r\nAs soon as that which is not fully ripe begins to show specks, it must\r\nbe separated. As to the pods which are not perfectly ripe, they should\r\nremain in heaps during three days under green banana leaves, that they\r\nmay ripen before they are hulled. When the cacao is stored, great care\r\nis necessary not to leave amongst it pieces of the pod or leaves, or\r\nany other excrementitious particles. This care must be repeated every\r\ntime that it is removed from the store, or replaced in it.\r\n\r\nThe cacao must always be exposed to the sun on the fourth day after it\r\nhas been gathered, and this exposure should be daily repeated until it\r\nis perfectly dry. When that is the case, the beans burst on being\r\nsqueezed, their shell resounds when struck, and they no longer become\r\nheated when placed in heaps; the latter is the best proof that the\r\nmoisture injurious to their preservation is dissipated. If the cacao\r\nis not sufficiently exposed to the sun, it becomes mouldy; if too\r\nmuch, it withers, and easily pulverises--in either case it soon rots.\r\n\r\nWhen the quantity of cacao gathered is considerable, it is placed in\r\nthe sunshine by a hundred quintals at a time, unless the cultivator\r\nhas a sufficient number of persons employed to expose a greater\r\nquantity. This operation is indispensable, to prevent it from becoming\r\nmouldy. If the rains prevent this exposure to the sun, it is\r\nnecessary, as soon as it is sufficiently cleaned or purified, to\r\nspread it in apartments, galleries, or halls, with which the\r\nplantation must be provided; this operation cannot be delayed without\r\ndanger of losing the crop.\r\n\r\nIt is to be wished that stoves were employed to dry the cacao when the\r\nsun fails, but this expedient, so simple and important, is generally\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nIt is almost universally believed that the most essential precautions\r\nfor preserving the cacao consists in gathering it at the decline of\r\nthe moon. I believe that they may more seriously calculate on the care\r\nof depositing it in apartments so hermetically closed that the air\r\ncannot penetrate; it would be advisable to make these apartments of\r\nwood, for the more perfect exclusion of moisture. The floor should be\r\nelevated two feet; under the floor a pan of coals is placed, covered\r\nwith a funnel, the point of which enters into the heap of cacao and\r\nthen diffuses the vapor. In the apartment which contains the cacao,\r\nsome persons place bottles of vinegar, slightly stopped with paper, to\r\nprevent the formation of worms.\r\n\r\nThe beans which begin to show specks, may be preserved from entire\r\ncorruption by a slight application of brine. This occasions a small\r\ndegree of fermentation, which is sufficient to destroy the worms, and\r\nto preserve the cacao during a considerable time from new attacks. Why\r\nis not this preservative also employed after the cacao is dried, and\r\nwhen placed in the store, where it awaits the purchaser?\r\n\r\nAt St. Philip they make use of smoke to preserve the cacao; it is also\r\nascertained that fine salt, thrown in small quantities on the cacao,\r\nprotects it from worms.\r\n\r\nMuch has been done for the cacao when it has been cleared of all green\r\nor dead beans, and extraneous substances; when it has received no\r\nbruise or injury in the operation of drying, and when it has been\r\nsubsequently kept in a place that is dry and not exposed to the air;\r\nyet, even with all these precautions, cacao of the best quality is\r\nseldom found marketable at the end of a year.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances sufficiently prove that the culture of cacao\r\nrequires attention more than science, vigilance rather than genius,\r\nand assiduity in preference to theory. Choice of ground, distribution\r\nand draining of the waters, position of the trees destined to shade\r\nthe cacao, are almost the only points which require more than common\r\nintelligence. Less expense is also required for an establishment of\r\nthis kind than for any other of equal revenue. One able hand, as I\r\nhave already said, is sufficient for the preservation and harvest of a\r\nthousand plants, each of which should yield at least one pound of\r\ncacao, in ground of moderate quality, and a pound and a half in the\r\nbest soil. By an averaged calculation of twenty ounces to each plant,\r\nthe thousand plants must produce twelve hundred and fifty pounds,\r\nwhich, at the ordinary price of 31s. 6d. per cwt., would produce about\r\n£17 10s. per annum for each laborer. The expenses of the plantation,\r\nincluding those of utensils, machines, and buildings, are also less\r\nconsiderable for cacao than for any other produce. The delay of the\r\nfirst crop, and the accidents peculiar to cacao, can alone diminish\r\nthe number of planters attached to its culture, and induce a\r\npreference to other commodities.\r\n\r\nThe cacao plant is not in a state of prolific produce till the eighth\r\nyear in the interior, and the ninth in plantations on the coast. Yet,\r\nby a singularity which situation alone can explain, the crops of cacao\r\ncommence in the ninth year in the valley of Goapa, and at the east of\r\nthe mouth of the Tuy. In the vicinity of the line, and on the banks of\r\nRio-Negro, the plantations are in full produce on the fourth, or at\r\nmost the fifth year.\r\n\r\nThe cacao tree continues productive to the age of fifty years on the\r\ncoast, and thirty years in the interior of the country.\r\n\r\nIn general the culture and preparation of cacao receives more\r\nattention in the eastern parts of Venezuela than in other places, and\r\neven than in the French colonies. It is true that the suitability of\r\nthe soil contributes much to the quality of the article; but without\r\nthe assistance derived from art, it would be far from possessing that\r\nsuperiority awarded to it by commerce over the cacao of every other\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nStevenson (\"Travels in South America\") speaks of another kind of cacao\r\ntree, called moracumba, which is larger than the ordinary species, and\r\ngrows wild in the woods. The beans under the brown husk are composed\r\nof a white, solid matter, almost like a lump of hard tallow. The\r\nnatives take a quantity of these, and pass a piece of slender cane\r\nthrough them, and roast them, when they have the delicate flavour of\r\nthe cacao.\r\n\r\nThere are several cacao plantations in Surinam. The trees are left to\r\ngrow their natural height, which is about that of a cherry-tree; their\r\nleaves resemble those of the broad-leaved laurel, and are of a dark\r\ngreen colour. The fruit in shape resembles a lemon, but is rather more\r\noval; it is at first green, and, when ripe, yellow. It is said that\r\nthere are some trees which produce above two hundred, each containing\r\nabout twenty beans or nuts. The fruit not only proceeds from the\r\nbranches, but even from the stem; and though there is always ripe and\r\nunripe fruit, it is only gathered twice a year. The chocolate is in\r\nthat colony in general of an inferior quality, known by its dark brown\r\ncolor and rough taste, but the superiority of the cacao depends\r\nprincipally on the soil where the trees are planted.--(Baron Von\r\nSack's \"Surinam.\")\r\n\r\nMy friend, Sir R. Schomburgk, in his \"Description of British Guiana,\"\r\nsays--\"While we crossed from the river Berbice to the Essequibo, we\r\nmet a number of chocolate nut trees, near the abandoned Caribi\r\nsettlement of Primoss. It is not to be doubted that the trees were\r\noriginally planted by the Indians, but from their number and the\r\ndistance from the river, I judged they were propagated by nature.\r\nThough they were overshadowed by larger trees, and had for many years\r\nbeen neglected, they had reached nevertheless a height of from thirty\r\nto forty feet, and the luxuriant growth and the abundance of fruit,\r\nproved that the plant was satisfied with the soil. The forests at the\r\nbanks of the Rio Branco, in the vicinity of Santa Maria and Carno,\r\nabound in wild cacao trees, the fruits of which are collected by the\r\nscanty population of that district for their own use.\"\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of cacao will be most suitable to the less wealthy\r\nindividual, as it demands so little labor and outlay. Baron Humboldt\r\nobserves, in alluding to Spanish America, that cacao plantations are\r\noccupied by persons of humble condition, who prepare for themselves\r\nand their children a slow but certain fortune; a single laborer is\r\nsufficient to aid them in their plantations, and 30,000 trees, once\r\nestablished, assure competence for a generation and a half.\r\n\r\nThe following have been the total imports of Cacao into the United\r\nKingdom from Mexico and Central America, &c.:--\r\n\r\n                  lbs.\r\n  1832            85,642\r\n  1834            16,171\r\n  1835               211\r\n  1836           861,531\r\n  1837           564,992\r\n  1838         1,681,965\r\n  1839           508,307\r\n  1840         1,058,015\r\n  1841         1,802,547\r\n  1842           441,084\r\n  1843         1,229,515\r\n  (Parl. Paper, No. 426, Sess. 1844.)\r\n\r\nOnly a few hundred pounds of this is entered annually for home\r\nconsumption, the great bulk being re-exported.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 we imported 1,204,572 lbs. from Mexico; 1,231,773 lbs. from\r\nChile; 4,438 lbs. from Venezuela, and 23,538 lbs. from Hayti.\r\n\r\nBRAZIL.--A great deal of cacao is raised in different parts of this\r\nempire. From the province of Para alone 35,000 bags, valued at\r\n£35,000, were exported in the year 1845. Mr. Edwards, in his \"Voyage\r\nup the River Amazon,\" gives an interesting account:--\r\n\r\n    \"We were now (he says) in the great cacao region, which, for an\r\n    extent of several hundred square miles, borders the river. The cacao\r\n    trees are low, not rising above fifteen or twenty feet, and are\r\n    distinguishable from a distance by the yellowish green of their\r\n    leaves, so different from aught else around them. They are planted\r\n    at intervals of about twelve feet, and, at first, are protected from\r\n    the sun's fierceness by banana trees, which, with their broad\r\n    leaves, form a complete shelter. Three years after planting the\r\n    trees yield, and therefore require little attention, or, rather,\r\n    receive not any. From an idea that the sun is injurious to the\r\n    berry, the tree-tops are suffered to mat together until the whole\r\n    becomes dense as thatch-work. The sun never penetrates this, and the\r\n    ground below is constantly wet. The trunk of the tree grows\r\n    irregularly, without beauty, although perhaps by careful training it\r\n    might be made as graceful as an apple tree. The leaf is thin, much\r\n    resembling our beech, excepting that it is smooth-edged. The flower\r\n    is very small, and the berry grows direct from the trunk or\r\n    branches. It is eight inches in length, five in diameter, and shaped\r\n    much like a rounded double cone. When ripe, it turns from light\r\n    green to a deep yellow, and at that time ornaments the tree finely.\r\n    Within the berry is a white acid pulp, and embedded in this are from\r\n    thirty to forty seeds, an inch in length, narrow and flat. These\r\n    seeds are the cacao of commerce. When the berries are ripe, they are\r\n    collected into great piles near the house, are cut open with a\r\n    tresado, and the seeds, squeezed carelessly from the pulp, are\r\n    spread upon mats to dry in the sun. Before being half dried they are\r\n    loaded into canoes in bulk, and transmitted to Para. Some of these\r\n    vessels will carry four thousand arrobas, of thirty-two pounds\r\n    weight each, and, as if such a bulk of damp produce would not\r\n    sufficiently spoil itself by its own steaming during a twenty days'\r\n    voyage, the captains are in the habit of throwing upon it great\r\n    quantities of water, to prevent its loss of weight. As might be\r\n    expected, when they arrive at Para it is little more than a heap of\r\n    mould, and it is then little wonder that Para cacao is considered\r\n    the most inferior in foreign markets. Cacao is very little drunk\r\n    throughout the province, and in the city we never saw it except at\r\n    the cafés. It is a delicious drink when properly prepared, and one\r\n    soon loses relish for that nasty compound known in the States as\r\n    chocolate, whose main ingredients are damaged rice and soap fat. The\r\n    cacao trees yield two crops annually, and, excepting in harvest\r\n    time, the proprietors have nothing to do but lounge in their\r\n    hammocks. Most of these people are in debt to traders in Santarem,\r\n    who trust them to an unlimited extent, taking a lien upon their\r\n    crops. Sometimes the plantations are of vast extent, and one can\r\n    walk for miles along the river, from one to another, as freely as\r\n    through an orchard. No doubt a scientific cultivator might make the\r\n    raising of cacao very profitable, and elevate its quality to that of\r\n    Guyaquil.\"\r\n\r\nCacao shipped from Brazil to the United Kingdom, for nine years,\r\nending 1835:--\r\n\r\n            lbs.\r\n  1827   3,992,449\r\n  1828   1,174,168\r\n  1829   2,442,456\r\n  1830   1,308,694\r\n  1831   1,716,614\r\n  1832   2,198,709\r\n  1833   2,402,803\r\n  1834   1,591,600\r\n  1835   1,678,769\r\n\r\n_Cultivation in the West India Islands_.--The only English colonies\r\nwhere this nutritious and wholesome substance is now cultivated to any\r\nextent, are Trinidad, St. Lucia, Grenada, and St. Vincent.\r\n\r\nIn Jamaica and British Guiana it has given place to the production of\r\nsugar, and though it forms such an important article in the imports\r\nand consumption of the United Kingdom, the quantity introduced from\r\nBritish plantations is barely equal to the demand. The imports from\r\nJamaica in 1831 were 6,684 lbs., and in 1838, 16,564 lbs.; while the\r\nimports since have been merely nominal. Of 5,014,681 lbs. imported in\r\n1841, 2,920,298 lbs. were furnished by the British West Indian\r\ncolonies, 1,802,547 lbs. came from the Colombian republics, and\r\n269,794 lbs. were brought from Brazil. Trinidad furnishes by far the\r\nlargest proportion of the West Indian supplies, the imports from\r\nthence in 1841 having been 2,500,000 lbs., while the imports from all\r\nthe other islands were but 427,000 lbs. In 1850, 4,750,000 lbs. were\r\nshipped from Trinidad, whilst in 1851 the quantity was nearly as much.\r\n\r\nTrinidad.--Although this tree is indigenous to many, if not most of\r\nthe tropical parts of America, it was first extensively cultivated in\r\nMexico; and it is remarkable that the words cacao and chocolate are\r\nboth of Mexican origin. From Mexico the variety called Creole cacao it\r\nis supposed was transplanted to the West India colonies; that variety\r\ncalled Forastero (stranger) came from the Brazils. The latter tree is\r\nthe most productive, but the former gives the best fruit, insomuch\r\nthat few persons now plant the Forastero cacao. There are two or\r\nthree indigenous species found growing wild in the forests of\r\nTrinidad, viz., _T. Sylvestris cacao_, _T. Guianensis_, and another\r\nsort.\r\n\r\nThere are few, perhaps no agricultural or horticultural pursuits, so\r\ndelightful (observes Mr. Joseph, in his \"History of Trinidad,\") as\r\nthat of the cultivation of the cacao. It is planted in rows,\r\nintersecting each other at right angles, at the distance of from\r\ntwelve to fifteen feet, according to the nature of the soil. The tree\r\nis not suffered to grow higher than about fifteen feet, and its broad\r\nrich foliage, the hues of which vary from a light green to a dark red,\r\nloaded with yellow and dark red pods, which contain the chocolate\r\nbean, are beautiful objects; these alleys are shaded by rows of\r\nmagnificent trees, called _Bois Immortel_ by the French and English,\r\nby the Spaniards the Madre de Cacao. It is the _Erythrina umbrosa_ or\r\n_arborea_ of Linnæus. Like the Bignonia or Pouie, this tree, at\r\nparticular seasons, throws off its foliage and is covered with\r\nblossoms; those of the Erythrina are of a brilliant red color,\r\njustifying its Greek appellation. In this state they are literally\r\ndazzling to behold--no object in the vegetable world looks more\r\nstriking than the alleys of a cacao walk shaded by a forest above them\r\nof the Bois Immortel.\r\n\r\nI have been obligingly furnished by Mr. W. Purdie, the able Government\r\nbotanist of Trinidad, with a short essay upon the cultivation of the\r\ncacao tree, with which many of the valleys of that island are so\r\nbeautifully adorned, and which, at one time, poured into that now\r\nunfortunate colony so large a stream of wealth. Fortunately the cacao\r\nplanter of the island has managed to survive the many years of\r\ndepression under which--like sugar now--the cacao cultivations\r\nlingered and sunk, and which brought the once wealthy planter down to\r\npoverty and misery. His prospects, however, are gradually improving.\r\n\r\nThe opinions put forth by Mr. Purdie, on the subject of which he\r\ntreats, will be found to run counter to the long-established practice\r\nhitherto pursued in the treatment of cacao plantations; but it must\r\nnot be forgotten that these are the opinions of a person with whom the\r\nstudy of trees, their physiology and functions, has been not merely an\r\namusing science, but an adopted employment, and whose acquirements in\r\nthis respect, previous to his arrival in the colony, recommended him\r\nfor selection as the agent to extend through South America (the great\r\ncacao region) the investigations of one of the most noted botanical\r\ngardens in Europe.\r\n\r\nMr. Purdie says:--\r\n\r\n    \"In the present depressed times, it behoves us to look well into the\r\n    resources of our fertile island, particularly as far as any\r\n    improvement can be suggested capable of averting, at least, a part\r\n    of the misery and ruin that is hovering over us, and which is too\r\n    eagerly borne on the lips of all classes of the community, instead\r\n    of using our efforts to do what we can to meet the difficulty; but\r\n    few seem to inquire whether we make the most of our present means or\r\n    not, whilst every one rather joins in the cry that sugar fetches\r\n    little or nothing, and it is no uncommon thing to hear the complaint\r\n    transferred from sugar to cacao.\r\n\r\n    It is but too true that the markets are at present lamentably\r\n    against the most important branch of our industry, under the present\r\n    manner of sugar cultivation and manufacture in this island. But it\r\n    can hardly be admitted that the same is the case in that of\r\n    cacao--also a very important branch of our agriculture.\r\n\r\n    My attention has been lately directed to the average produce per\r\n    tree, which will, I hope, throw some light on its cultivation. From\r\n    fifteen cacao trees, which are all there are at St. Ann's, I have\r\n    this year gathered 115 lbs. of cacoa (dried), and at present there\r\n    is at least 50 lbs. more ripe on the same trees. This gives 165 lbs.\r\n    of cacao from fifteen trees, or 11 lbs. per tree. These cannot be\r\n    considered fine trees; on the contrary, they are what would be\r\n    considered ordinary ones; therefore the average in this case is\r\n    fair, and differs materially from selecting the produce of fifteen\r\n    trees from a large plantation, and giving the average return of what\r\n    might be obtained from cacao cultivation. Last year these trees did\r\n    not average more than 2 lbs. per tree, and I attribute the increase\r\n    of crop to the thinning out of both the cacao and shade trees.\r\n\r\n    In a former letter to the cacao-planters of Trinidad, I recommended\r\n    twenty-four to thirty feet from tree to tree as the proper distance;\r\n    but so as to meet the feelings of those who, unfortunately for\r\n    themselves, consider every cacao tree cut down a sacrifice, I\r\n    propose that the trees be thinned out to twenty-four feet, and that,\r\n    at intervals of twenty rows at most, avenues of fifty feet in both\r\n    directions should be left. After this, it will be better seen what\r\n    may be necessary to be done to each individual tree; neither should\r\n    the shade trees be forgotten; as a general rule, they are\r\n    prejudicially thick.\r\n\r\n    By attending to this, I am quite satisfied that a very material\r\n    increase in the produce will be seen; indeed, I may say that on this\r\n    depends the chief difference of 1¼ lb. and 11 lbs. per tree; for I\r\n    consider it a very fair inference, that the average obtained here\r\n    can be realised in any other place in this island, and to any\r\n    extent, under the same circumstances of light and air, unless on\r\n    very poor soil, of which we fortunately have but little.\r\n\r\n    At twenty-four feet apart there would be seventy-five trees per\r\n    acre, or 250 per quarrée. This, at 11 lbs. per tree, gives 2,750\r\n    lbs. of dried cacao per quarrée, at 5 dollars per 100 lbs., gives\r\n    137 dollars 50 cents gross; deducting 80 dollars per quarrée\r\n    expenses, leaves 57 dollars 60 cents net profit. Thus an estate of\r\n    120 acres, or 36 quarrées, would contain 9,000 trees, at 11 lbs. per\r\n    tree will give 33,000 lbs. of cacao, at 5 dollars gives 4,350\r\n    dollars gross per annum; deducting 80 dollars per quarrée (a much\r\n    more liberal sum than is at present laid out), leaves a net balance\r\n    of 1,950 dollars, or 16 dollars 25 cents per acre.\r\n\r\n    Now this, it must be remembered, would be the produce from 9,000\r\n    trees, and from an estate containing only 36 quarrées of land (which\r\n    cannot be considered a large one); what, then, might be expected\r\n    from estates containing 40,000 trees?\r\n\r\n    I have been recently favoured with the following average return of\r\n    cacao in this island, which I have no doubt will be considered a\r\n    fair one. I insert it in full, and, from the very low return, it\r\n    shows a lamentable deficiency in the cultivation of this most\r\n    grateful tree:--\r\n\r\n    'The average number of cacoa trees in a quarrée of land is 868.\r\n\r\n    '1st. The estates throughout the island are generally planted at a\r\n    distance of 12 feet by 12, and 13½ feet by 13½. Those planted at 12\r\n    by 12 contain 969 trees in the quarrée, and those at 13½ by 13½\r\n    contain 767 trees, the area of the quarrée being taken at 139,697\r\n    superficial feet. There may be in the island about 60 quarrées in\r\n    all, planted at 15 by 15 feet.\r\n\r\n    '2nd. The actual annual value of a quarrée of land planted in cacoa\r\n    is ten fanegas, or 1¼ lb. to a tree.\r\n\r\n    'It is to be observed that this is the general return from each tree\r\n    as estates are now cultivated, but if planters had the means of\r\n    keeping their estates in high cultivation, each cacoa tree would\r\n    produce 2 lbs. on an average.\r\n\r\n    '3rd. The annual average cost of cultivating a quarrée in cacao, and\r\n    manufacturing the produce therefrom, is 35 dollars, in the imperfect\r\n    manner it is carried on at present, thereby giving only 10 fanegas\r\n    per quarrée.'\r\n\r\n    I believe there are many estates in the island where the average\r\n    distance is less than 12 by 12; however, to give the present mode\r\n    the full benefit of the return, I will adopt, for comparison's sake,\r\n    the maximum number of trees; so that 960 trees per quarrée, at l¼\r\n    lb. per tree, gives 1,211 lbs. of cacao, at 5 dollars per 100 lbs.\r\n    is worth 60 dollars,[2] gross return per quarrée; deducting 36\r\n    dollars, not 80 dollars, for expenses, which leaves 24 dollars per\r\n    quarrée net, or about 7 dollars 75 cents per acre.\r\n\r\n    This is a startling account from lands among the most fertile in the\r\n    world, and from a plant, under fair treatment, next to the sugar\r\n    cane, perhaps the most grateful for the care bestowed, more\r\n    especially when we consider that more than ten times that quantity\r\n    might be obtained with a comparatively insignificant _outlay of\r\n    money_.\r\n\r\n    If such, then, be the case, as stated in the above report (and it is\r\n    to be regretted that it is too near the truth), apathy on the part\r\n    of those whose interests are so much concerned is unwarrantable. It\r\n    is not enough to say that our fathers must have known the proper way\r\n    to plant cacao; this is but a lame excuse, and not sufficient to\r\n    dispense with any exertions of the present generation, beyond merely\r\n    collecting whatever fruit may come, as it were, fortuitously.\r\n    Moreover, at the time the present cacao plantations were established\r\n    in this island, its cultivation was comparatively little known; it\r\n    is therefore likely that they might have erred, as they undoubtedly\r\n    did, in cramming them so close together; but notwithstanding this,\r\n    by a proper system of thinning, the evils might have been easily\r\n    obviated, and large crops ensured.\r\n\r\n    A few mornings ago, a cacao planter from Santa Cruz called on me,\r\n    and in conversation stated that the only place where he had anything\r\n    like a crop of cacao at present, was where the hurricane of the 11th\r\n    of October had devastated his estate most severely, and which he at\r\n    that time considered a ruinous visitation. I hope the lesson will\r\n    not be lost on him.\r\n\r\n    In Jamaica it is found necessary to prune the coffee trees yearly,\r\n    which is done with as much care as gooseberry or currant bushes in\r\n    England; but, notwithstanding this, I remember a friend of mine in\r\n    Jamaica telling me of the extraordinary difference on his coffee\r\n    plantation under the management of a person who understood and\r\n    attended more particularly to the pruning of his trees.\r\n\r\n    Lunan, in his 'Hortus Jamaicensis,' published in 1814, gives a very\r\n    elaborate article on the cacao, although its cultivation was almost\r\n    extinct in his day in that island. He, however, appears to have\r\n    derived his information chiefly from Blume, who wrote a short\r\n    account of Jamaica, in 1672, at which time cacao was the chief\r\n    export of the island. Lunan attributes its downfall to heavy\r\n    ministerial exaction, which was then, he says, upwards of 480 per\r\n    cent. on its marketable value. Speaking of the average weight of\r\n    cacao per tree, he has the following:--'The produce of one tree is\r\n    generally estimated at about 20 lbs. of nuts. The produce per acre\r\n    in Jamaica has been rated at 1,000 lbs. weight per annum, allowing\r\n    for bad years. In poor soils, and under bad management, the produce\r\n    of the tree rarely exceeds 8 lbs. weight.' He also says--'When the\r\n    cacao plants are six months old, the planter from this period must\r\n    not be too fond of cleaning the plantation from grass and herbage,\r\n    because they keep the ground cool; but all creeping, climbing\r\n    plants, and such weeds as grow high enough to overtop the cacao,\r\n    should be destroyed.' He gives the distance from tree to tree at 18\r\n    feet. I have long since been of opinion that it is of less\r\n    consequence to clean the ground beneath the trees than to attend to\r\n    the top-pruning of the shade trees, as well as to the cacao\r\n    (although the former is very desirable, it is nevertheless a\r\n    subordinate consideration). Under the present mode of cultivation\r\n    the ground-cleaning is the only one at all attended to, and that\r\n    badly.\r\n\r\n    A very important economy might also be made in the curing of the\r\n    cacao, by which much time would be saved, and consequently expense,\r\n    by adopting the same method as is used in Jamaica for drying coffee,\r\n    namely, floorings of cement, or, as they are called, barbecues. At\r\n    convenient distances in the centre of these floorings (which are\r\n    inclined planes) a slightly-raised circular ridge is formed with\r\n    cement, leaving an aperture at the lower side to allow the escape of\r\n    any water that may have lodged in them. The cacao is easily brought\r\n    together in these places in the event of rain, and at night covered\r\n    with portable wooden frames, which are readily removed by two men.\r\n    In this way the cacao would be dried in a fifth of the time much\r\n    more effectually, and of a brighter colour.\r\n\r\n    Any experiments tending to bring about a proper system of\r\n    cultivation and manufacture of cacao, must be beneficial to the\r\n    island, as well as to individuals; for it cannot be denied that the\r\n    cultivation of cacoa will still prove advantageous in proportion to\r\n    the care bestowed on it. Indeed its cultivation is at present\r\n    languishing, not so much from inadequate prices, as from a want of\r\n    proper attention to its cultivation.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1796, there were sixty plantations in Trinidad, which produced\r\n96,000 lbs. In 1802 the plantations were reduced to fifty-seven, the\r\nyield being about the same. In 1807, 355,000 lbs. of cacao were grown.\r\nIn 1831, there were 2,972 quarrees (each three acres and one-fifth\r\nEnglish) under cultivation in Trinidad with cacao, on which were\r\n2,464,426 trees, which produced a crop of 1,479,568 lbs. In 1841 there\r\nwere 6,910 acres planted with cacao.\r\n\r\nThe following have been the exports from this island from 1821 to\r\n1844:--\r\n\r\n                               lbs.\r\n  1821                      1,214,093\r\n  1822                      1,780,379\r\n  1823                      2,424,703\r\n  1824                      2,661,628\r\n  1825                      2,760,603\r\n  1826                      2,951,171\r\n  1827                      3,696,144\r\n  1828                      2,582,323\r\n  1829                      2,756,603\r\n  1830                      1,646,531\r\n  1831                      1,888,852\r\n  1832                      1,530,990\r\n  1833                      3,090,526\r\n  1834                      3,363,630\r\n  1835                      2,744,643\r\n  1836                      3,188,870\r\n  1837                      2,507,483\r\n  1838                      2,571,915\r\n  1839                      2,914,068\r\n  1840                      2,007,494\r\n  1841                      2,493,302\r\n  1842                      2,163,798\r\n  1843                      1,099,975\r\n           (Mill's Trinidad Almanac).\r\n\r\nIn a lecture delivered by Dr. Lindley before the Society of Arts,\r\nalluding to the colonial products shown, at the Great Exhibition, he\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n    \"There was one sample which ought to be mentioned most especially;\r\n    namely, the cocoa of admirable quality which comes, or which may\r\n    come, from Trinidad. Cocoa--cacao, as we should call it--is an\r\n    article of very large consumption. Enormous quantities of it are now\r\n    used in the navy; and every one knows how much it is employed daily\r\n    in private life. It is, moreover, the basis of chocolate. But we\r\n    have the evidence of one of the most skilful brokers in London, who\r\n    has had forty years experience to enable him to speak to the\r\n    fact--that we never get good cocoa in this country. The consequence\r\n    is, that all the best chocolate is made in Spain, in France, and the\r\n    countries where the fine description of cocoa goes. We get here\r\n    cocoa which is unripe, flinty, and bitter, having undergone changes\r\n    that cause it to bear a very low price in the market. But it comes\r\n    from British possessions, and is, therefore, sold here subject to a\r\n    duty of only 18s. 8d. per cwt., whereas if it came from a foreign\r\n    country it would pay 56s.[3] The differential duty drives the best\r\n    cocoa out of the English market. Still it appears that we might\r\n    supply, from our own colonies, this very cocoa; because, as I have\r\n    said, there was exhibited, from Trinidad, a very beautiful sample,\r\n    quite equal to anything produced in the best markets of the\r\n    Magdalena, of Soconusco, or of other places on the Spanish main. It\r\n    had no bitterness, no flintiness, no damaged grain in it; but all\r\n    were plump and ripe, as if they had been picked. The cocoa from the\r\n    Spanish main goes into other countries, for the preparation of that\r\n    delicious chocolate which we buy of them. It is thrown out of our\r\n    market by the differential duty. But it is their own fault if our\r\n    own colonies do not produce fine cocoa, as Trinidad has conclusively\r\n    proved.\"\r\n\r\nThe exports of cacao from St. Lucia, where there are now 300 acres\r\nunder cultivation, have been as follows:[4]--I have also added the\r\nproduce of St. Vincent and Grenada imported here:--\r\n\r\n           Grenada.

In the same year, 15,301¾ arrobas were imported, so\r\nthat at that period the production was not adequate to the\r\nconsumption. The expectation of a great increase of production seems\r\nnot to have been realized, as the exports of cacao in 1837 were only\r\n587¼ arrobas, while the imports amounted to 40,837½ arrobas.\r\n\r\nThere are now about sixty-nine cacao plantations in that island,\r\nalmost exclusively situate in the central and oriental departments,\r\nwhich produced, in 1849, 3,836 arrobas, valued at 19,180 dollars.\r\n\r\nHayti exported, in 1801, 648,518 lbs. of cacao; in 1826, 457,592 lbs.,\r\nand in 1836, 550,484 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe French island of Martinique produces a considerable quantity of\r\ncacao. In 1763, there were stated to be 103,870 trees in bearing. The\r\nproduce exported in 1769 was 11,731 quintals. In 1770 there were\r\n871,043 trees. In 1820 there were 412 square acres under cultivation\r\nwith cacao, producing 449,492 lbs.; and in 1835, 492 hectares, which\r\nyielded 155,300 kilogrammes. I have no later returns at hand.\r\n\r\nThe beverage generally called _cocoa_ is merely the berries of\r\n_Theobroma Cacao_, pounded and drank either with water or milk, or\r\nwith both. _Chocolate_ (of which I shall speak by and bye) is a\r\ncompound drink, and is manufactured chiefly from the kernels of this\r\nplant, whose natural habitat would seem to be Guayaquil, in South\r\nAmerica, though it flourishes in great perfection in the West Indies.\r\nIt grows also spontaneously and luxuriantly on the banks of the\r\nMagdalena, in South America; but the fruit of those trees that are\r\nfound in the district of Carthagena is preferred to all others,\r\nprobably from a superior mode of cultivation. Sir R. Schomburgk, in\r\nhis expedition into the interior of British Guiana, found the country\r\nabounding in cacao, \"which the Indians were most anxious to secure, as\r\nthe pulpy arillus surrounding the seed has an agreeable vinous taste.\"\r\nSingular to say, however, they appeared perfectly ignorant of the\r\nqualities of the seed, which possesses the most delightful aroma. Sir\r\nRobert adds, they evinced the greatest astonishment when they beheld\r\nhim and Mr. Goodall collecting these seeds and using them as\r\nchocolate, which was the most delicious they had ever tasted. These\r\nindigenous cacao trees were met with in innumerable quantities on the\r\n5th of June, 1843, and the following day; and thus inexhaustible\r\nstores of a highly-prized luxury are here reaped solely by the wild\r\nhog, the agouti, monkeys, and the rats of the interior.--(Simmonds's\r\nCol. Mag. vol. i., p. 41.)\r\n\r\nThe height of the cacao shrub is generally from eighteen to twenty\r\nfeet; the leaf is between four and six inches long, and its breadth\r\nthree or four, very smooth, and terminating in a point like that of\r\nthe orange tree, but differing from it in color; of a dull green,\r\nwithout gloss, and not so thickly set upon the branches. The blossom\r\nis first white, then reddish, and contains the rudiments of the\r\nkernels or berries. When fully developed, the pericarp or seed-vessel\r\nis a pod, which grows not only from the branches, but the stem of the\r\ntree, and is from six to seven inches in length, and shaped like a\r\ncucumber. Its color is green when growing, like that of the leaf; but\r\nwhen ripe, is yellow, smooth, clear, and thin. When arrived at its\r\nfull growth, and before it is ripe, it is gathered and eaten like any\r\nother fruit, the taste being subacid. If allowed to ripen, the kernels\r\nbecome hard; and, when taken out of the seed-vessel, are preserved in\r\nskins, or, more frequently, laid on the vijahua leaves, and placed in\r\nthe air to dry. When fully dry, they are put in leathern bags, and\r\nsent to market: this is the Spanish mode of taking in the crop. A\r\nsomewhat different method is followed in Trinidad and Jamaica (in the\r\nlatter island it can scarcely be said to be cultivated now); but it\r\ndiffers in no essential degree from the principle of gradual\r\nexsiccation, and protection from moisture.\r\n\r\n_Chocolate_, properly so called, and so prized both in the Spanish\r\ncontinent and in the West Indies, never reaches Great Britain except\r\nas a contraband article, being, like nearly all colonial manufactured\r\narticles, prohibited by the Custom-house laws. What is generally drank\r\nunder that name is simply the cacao boiled in milk, gruel, or even\r\nwater, and is as much like the Spanish or West India chocolate as\r\nvinegar is to Burgundy. It is, without any exception, of all domestic\r\ndrinks the most alimentary; and the Spaniards esteem it so necessary\r\nto the health and support of the body, that it is considered the\r\nseverest punishment to withhold it, even from criminals; nay, to be\r\nunable to procure chocolate, is deemed the greatest misfortune in\r\nlife! Yet, notwithstanding this estimation in which it is held, the\r\nquantity made in the neighbourhood of Carthagena is insufficient for\r\nthe demands of the population, and is so highly priced that none is\r\nexported but as presents! The manner in which the Spaniards first\r\nmanufactured this veritable Theobroma--this food for gods (from\r\n_Theos_, God, and _broma_, food)--was very simple. They employed the\r\ncacao, maize, Indian corn (_Zea Mays_), and raw cane-juice, and\r\ncoloured it with arnatto, which they called _achiotti_ or _rocou_, but\r\nwhich was known in Europe at that time by the name of _Terra\r\nOrellana_. These four substances were levigated between two stones,\r\nand afterwards, in certain proportions, mixed together in one mass,\r\nwhich mass was subsequently divided into little cakes, and used as\r\nrequired, both in the solid and fluid form.\r\n\r\nThe Indians used one pound of the wasted nuts, half a pound of sugar,\r\nand half a pound of ground corn (maize) each, and then added\r\nrose-water to make it palatable. This the Mexicans called chocolate,\r\nfrom two words in their language, signifying the noise made by the\r\ninstruments used to mill and prepare it in the water. Many other\r\ningredients were subsequently added; but with the exception of\r\nVanilla, in the opinions of most persons, they spoil, rather than\r\nimprove it. Chocolate, as used in Mexico, is thus prepared: --The\r\nkernels are roasted in an iron pot pierced with holes; they are then\r\npounded in a mortar, and afterwards ground between two stones,\r\ngenerally of marble, till it is brought to a paste, to which sugar is\r\nadded, according to the taste of the manufacturer. From time to time,\r\nas the paste assumes consistency, they add long pepper, arnatto, and\r\nlastly, vanilla. Some manufacturers vary these ingredients, and\r\nsubstitute cinnamon, cloves, or aniseed, and sometimes musk and\r\nambergris--the two latter on account of their aphrodisiac qualities.\r\nThe following is the formula given by a late writer:--To six pounds of\r\nthe nut add three-and-a-half pounds of sugar, seven pods of vanilla,\r\none-and-a-half pounds of corn meal (maize ground), half-a-pound of\r\ncinnamon, six cloves, one drachm of capsicums (bird pepper), and as\r\nmuch of the rocou or arnatto as is sufficient to color it, together\r\nwith ambergris or musk, to enforce (as he says) the flavor, but in\r\nreality to stimulate the system. There is another chocolate made of\r\nfilberts and almonds, but this is not considered genuine. In old Spain\r\nit is somewhat differently made; two or three kinds of flowers, also\r\nthe pods of Campeche, almonds, and hazel-nuts, being mixed up with it,\r\nwhile the paste is worked with orange-water.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the manner in which chocolate is prepared in England\r\nnothing need be said, as it is too well known to require description.\r\nThat which has appeared to me the best is \"_Fry's Chocolate_,\" which\r\nrequires only to be rubbed up with a little boiling water, and scalded\r\nmilk added to it with sugar, according to the taste of the drinker;\r\nthere is a flavour, however, in this chocolate sometimes of _suet_,\r\nwhich is probably added to give it a richness which the cacao employed\r\nmay not possess of itself. In the West Indies they rarely add anything\r\nto cacoa but arnatto (sometimes a little fresh butter), though it is\r\noften scented and sweetened, and sold in little rolls at five-pence\r\nand ten-pence each, currency. It is always boiled with milk, which,\r\nthough very indigestible when boiled and taken alone, seems to lose\r\nthis quality when taken with chocolate. Chocolate thus made is much\r\ndrank, when cold, in the middle of the day, and is considered, both by\r\nthe negroes and the old settlers, as a most nutritive and salutary\r\nbeverage.\r\n\r\nThe signs by which _good chocolate_ or cacao is known are these:--It\r\nshould dissolve entirely in water, and be without sediment; it should\r\nbe oily, and yet melt in the mouth; and if genuine, and carefully\r\nprepared, should deposit no grits or grounds. That made in the West\r\nIndies, and in some parts of Cuba, is dark; but that manufactured in\r\nJamaica is of a bright brick colour, owing to the greater quantity of\r\narnatto which is used in the preparation, and which, I think, gives it\r\na richer and more agreeable flavor.\r\n\r\nIn an economical point of view, chocolate is a very important article\r\nof diet, as it may be literally termed meat and drink; and were our\r\nhalf-starved artisans, over-wrought factory children, and ricketty\r\nmillinery girls, induced to drink it instead of the innutritious\r\nbeverage called \"tea,\" its nutritive qualities would soon develop\r\nthemselves in their improved looks and more robust constitution. The\r\nprice, too, is in its favour, cacao being eight-pence per pound; while\r\nthe cheapest black tea, such as even the Chinese beggar would despise,\r\ndrank by milliners, washerwomen, and the poorer class in the\r\nmetropolis, is three shillings a pound, or three hundred and fifty per\r\ncent, dearer, while it is decidedly injurious to health.\r\n\r\nThe heads of the naval and military medical departments in England\r\nhave been so impressed with the wholesomeness and superior nutriment\r\nof cocao, that they have judiciously directed that it shall be served\r\nout twice or thrice a week to regiments of the line, and daily to the\r\nseamen on board Her Majesty's ships, and this wise regulation has\r\nevinced its salutary effects in the improved health and condition of\r\nthe men. Indeed, this has been most satisfactorily established in\r\nJamaica among the troops; and the same may be asserted of the seamen\r\nin men of war on the coast.\r\n\r\nBut the excellent qualities of chocolate were known not only to the\r\nMexicans and Peruvians, from whom, as a matter of course, the\r\nSpaniards acquired a knowledge of its properties; but European nations\r\nalso acknowledged its virtues. The Portuguese, French, Germans, and\r\nDutch, considered it an exceedingly valuable article of diet, and\r\nHoffman looked upon it both as a food and a medicine. In his\r\nmonograph, entitled _Potus Chocolati_, he recommends it in all\r\ndiseases of general weakness, macies, low spirits, and in\r\nhypochondrial complaints, and what since his time have been termed\r\nnervous diseases. As one example of the good effects of cacao, he\r\nadduces the case of Cardinal Richelieu, who was cured of eramacausis,\r\nor a general wasting away of the body, by drinking chocolate.[5] And\r\nEdwards informs us that Colonel Montague James--the first white\r\nperson born in Jamaica after the occupation of the island by the\r\nEnglish--lived to the great age of 104; and for the last thirty years\r\nof his life took scarcely any other food but chocolate. It is also\r\ncertain that those who indulge in excesses find their vigor more\r\nspeedily restored by the alternate use of chocolate and coffee than by\r\nany other ingesta; and pigs, goats, and horses, which are fed even on\r\nthe spoiled berries, are observed to become very speedily fat, and in\r\ngood condition.\r\n\r\nBut cacao has not only the property of rapidly restoring the invalid\r\nto health, strength, and condition, but a very inconsiderable quantity\r\nof it will sustain life for a long period. The South American Indians\r\nperform extraordinary journeys, subsisting, daring these prolonged\r\ntravels, on an incredibly small quantity of chocolate--so small,\r\nindeed, as to render the accounts of travellers upon the subject\r\nalmost marvellous. In this respect it resembles coffee, which also\r\npossesses the estimable property of sustaining the powers of life,\r\nwhile it modifies and restrains the passion of hunger.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact, and how far this condition may be connected with\r\nits powers of sustenance is worthy of inquiry, that chocolate recently\r\nboiled, if the operation be performed in a tin pan, is highly\r\nelectrical; and this property may be frequently manifested by\r\nrepeating the process.\r\n\r\nCacao, according to Bridges, \"was the favourite staple of the Spanish\r\ncommerce, trifling as that commerce was; and when the English took\r\npossession of the island of Jamaica, it was that which first engaged\r\ntheir attention. The extensive plantations left by their predecessors,\r\nwho had made it their principal food and only support, soon, however,\r\nbegan to fail. They were renewed; but whether it might be from the\r\nwant of attention, or of information in the new colonists, the plants\r\nnever succeeded under their management; so that, disgusted with the\r\ntroublesome and unprofitable cultivation, they soon substituted\r\nindigo.\" Yet forests of cacao trees grow wild in Guiana, the Isthmus\r\nof Darien, Yucatan, Honduras, Guatemala, Chiapa, and Nicaragua; while\r\nin Cuba, St. Domingo, and Jamaica, it was once an indigenous plant.\r\n\r\nThe following were the expenses of a cacao plantation in Jamaica\r\nduring the early period of British possession:--\r\n\r\n                                                    £ stg\r\n  Letters patent of five hundred acres of land         10\r\n  Six negroes                                         120\r\n  Four white persons, their passage and maintenance    80\r\n  Maintenance of six slaves for six months             18\r\n  Working implements                                    5\r\n                                                     ----\r\n                                                     £233\r\n\r\nIn four to five years the produce of one hundred acres would usually\r\nsell for £4,240 sterling. This was a monstrous and most unlooked-for\r\nreturn; but then, what was it to the profits of sugar, which, owing to\r\nthe prodigious increase of the slave trade, was fast coming into\r\nactive operation, and eating up and destroying all other sources and\r\nsprings of industry? How dearly have the West Indians paid for the\r\nshort-lived affluence which the sugar cane conferred!\r\n\r\nBlome, in his brief account of Jamaica, published in 1672, speaks of\r\ncacao as being one of the chief articles of export. He states that\r\nthere were sixty cacao-walks or plantations, and many more planting;\r\nbut, for many years, no cacao plantation has existed in Jamaica, all\r\nthe chocolate used being made from imported berries, or the chance\r\ngrowth of a munificent climate and redundant soil! A few scattered\r\ntrees, Edwards says (and as I my self know), here and there, are all\r\nthat remain of those flourishing and beautiful groves, which were once\r\nthe pride and boast of the country. They have withered with the indigo\r\nmanufactory, under the heavy hand of ministerial exaction. _The excise\r\non cacao, when made into cakes, rose to no less than £12 12s. per\r\ncwt., exclusive of 11s. 11½d. paid at the Custom-house, amounting\r\ntogether to upwards of £840 per cent. on its marketable value!_\r\n\r\nThe mode of cultivating the cacao is given at some length by Edwards;\r\nit is that of the Spaniards, a process strictly followed in Trinidad,\r\nwhere, of all the West India islands, it constitutes a considerable\r\nitem of exports. It is thus described:--\"A spot of level land being\r\nchosen--preference is always given to a deep black mould, sheltered by\r\na hedge or thicket, so as to be screened by the wind, especially the\r\nnorth, and cleared of all weeds and stumps of trees--a number of holes\r\nare dug, at ten or twelve feet distance from each other, each hole\r\nbeing about a foot in length, and six or eight inches deep. A very\r\nimportant matter is the selection of the seeds for planting, and this\r\nis done in the following manner: the finest and largest pods of the\r\ncacao are selected when full ripe, and the grains taken out and placed\r\nin a vessel of water. Those which swim are rejected; those chosen are\r\nwashed clean from the pulp, skinned, and then replaced in the water\r\ntill they begin to sprout; Banana (_Musa paradisiaca_), or some other\r\nlarge leaves, those of the sea-side grape (_Coccoloba uvifera_), for\r\ninstance, are then taken, and each hole is lined with one of them,\r\nleaving, however, the sides of the leaves some inches above ground;\r\nafter which the mould is rubbed in gently till the hole is filled;\r\nthree nuts are then selected for each hole, and they are set\r\ntriangularly in the earth, by making a small opening with the finger\r\nabout two inches deep, into which the nuts are put, with that end\r\ndownwards from which the sprout issues.\" They are then covered\r\nlightly with mould, the leaf folded over, and a small stone placed on\r\nthe top, to prevent its opening; in eight or ten days the young shoots\r\nappear above the ground; the leaves are then opened to give them light\r\nand air, and a shelter from the sun, either in the shape of plantain\r\nor banana leaves, is not forgotten; but the coco-nut and other species\r\nof palm, on account of their fibrous structure and great durability,\r\nare always preferred. This artificial shelter is continued for five or\r\nsix months. But, as a further security to the young plants, for they\r\nare very delicate, other trees or shrubs are planted to the south-west\r\nof the plants, that they may grow up with and shelter them, for young\r\ncacao will grow and flourish only in the shade. For this purpose the\r\ncoral bean-tree (_Erythrina Corallodendrum_) is chosen. I should\r\npresume there are other trees and plants equally eligible for this\r\npurpose, and more useful; but my experience does not enable me to\r\nspeak positively upon the subject. Should the three seeds placed in\r\neach hole spring up, it is thought necessary, when the plants are\r\nfifteen or twenty inches high, to cut one of them down. The two\r\nothers, if they devaricate, are sometimes suffered to remain, but it\r\ndoes not always happen that even _one_ of the three springs above the\r\nearth; consequently this additional labor is not invariably requisite.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth or fifth year the tree begins to bear, and attains\r\nperfection by the eighth, continuing to produce two crops of fruit per\r\nannum, yielding at each crop from 10 lbs. to 20 lbs., according to the\r\nnature of the soil. It will continue bearing for twenty years; but, as\r\nit is a delicate plant, it suffers from drought, and is liable to\r\nblight. In these respects, however, it does not differ from many other\r\nplants, which are even more subject to disease, though not half so\r\nvaluable. Besides, a proper system of irrigation, such as could be had\r\nrecourse to in many parts of Jamaica, would obviate and prevent these\r\nevils.\r\n\r\nThe whole quantity imported into the United Kingdom from the West\r\nIndies and British Guiana during the last thirteen years, has been as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n               lbs.\r\n  1831      1,491,947\r\n  1832        618,090\r\n  1833      2,125,641\r\n  1834      1,360,325\r\n  1835        439,440\r\n  1836      1,611,104\r\n  1837      1,847,125\r\n  1838      2,147,816\r\n  1839        969,428\r\n  1840      2,374,233\r\n  1841      2,919,105\r\n  1842      2,490,693\r\n  1843      1,496,554\r\n  1844      3,119,555\r\n  1845      3,351,602\r\n  1846      1,738,848\r\n  1847      3,026,381\r\n  1848      2,602,309\r\n  1849      3,159,086\r\n  1850      1,987,717\r\n  1851      4,347,195\r\n  1852      3,933,863\r\n\r\nCacao is cultivated in the highlands as well as on the coasts of the\r\nnorth-eastern peninsula of the large and rich island of Celebes, which\r\nhas within the last year or two been thrown open to foreign trade. The\r\nplantations of it are even now considerable, and this branch of\r\nindustry only requires not to be impeded by any obstacles in order to\r\nbe still further extended. It forms a large ingredient in the local\r\ntrade, and furnishes many petty traders with their daily bread, not to\r\nspeak of the landowners, for whom the cultivation of the cacao affords\r\nthe only subsistence. The preparation of the product differs from that\r\nadopted in the West Indies, but we have not been able to ascertain the\r\npractice. We may reckon that 1,200 to 2,000 piculs of 133 lbs. are\r\nyearly produced; the prices vary much, being from 50 to 75 florins per\r\npicul.--(\"Journal of the Indian Archipelago,\" vol. ii., p. 829.)\r\n\r\nBourbon now produces 15,000 to 20,000 kilogrammes of cacao annually.\r\nCacao is grown to a small extent in some of the settlements of Western\r\nAfrica, but as yet only a few puncheons have been exported, all the\r\nproduce being required for local consumption.\r\n\r\nThe following figures give the imports and consumption of cacao into\r\nthe United Kingdom in the last five years:--\r\n\r\n             Imports.

The produce of British\r\ncolonies pays 1d. per lb. duty, that from foreign countries 2d; cocoa\r\nhusks and shells half these amounts; when manufactured into chocolate\r\nor cocoa paste the duty is 2d. per lb. from British possessions, and\r\n6d. from other parts. The quantity imported in this form is to the\r\nextent of about 14,000 lbs. weight.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOFFEE.\r\n\r\nThe next staple I proceed to speak of is coffee--second only in\r\nimportance as a popular beverage to that universal commodity, tea. I\r\nshall proceed, in the first instance, to take a retrospect of the\r\nprogress of the coffee trade, and glance at the present condition and\r\nfuture prospects of produce and consumption. It will be seen, by\r\nreference to the following figures, that the consumption of coffee in\r\nthe United Kingdom shows a successive decrease, from 1847 to 1850, of\r\n6,414,533 lbs., and a loss to the revenue of £179,614.\r\n\r\nHOME CONSUMPTION AND REVENUE OF COFFEE FOR THE\r\n  Years      lbs.         £\r\n   1824    8,262,943    420,988\r\n   1825   11,082,970    315,809\r\n   1828   17,127,633    440,245\r\n   1835   23,295,046    652,124\r\n   1839   26,789,945    779,115\r\n   1840   28,723,735    921,551\r\n   1844   31,394,225    681,610\r\n   1845   34,318,095    717,871\r\n   1846   36,793,061    756,838\r\n   1847   37,441,373    746,436\r\n   1848   37,106,292    710,270\r\n   1849   34,431,074    643,210\r\n   1850   31,226,840    566,822\r\n   1851   32,564,164    445,739\r\n   1852   35,044,376    438,084\r\n\r\nI estimated, in a little treatise on coffee and its adulterations,\r\nwhich I published in 1850, that not less than 18,000,000 lbs. of\r\nvegetable matter of various kinds were sold annually under the\r\ndeceptive name of coffee. Three-fourths of these 18,000,000 lbs. of\r\npretended coffee were composed of chicory, and the remaining fourth of\r\nother ingredients prejudicial to health, as well as a fraud upon the\r\nrevenue. The various substances used in adulterating both chicory and\r\ncoffee, when sold in the powdered state, have been specifically\r\npointed out and set forth from time to time in memorials from the\r\ntrade and the coffee-growers. Mr. M'Culloch and other competent judges\r\nset down the actual consumption of chicory in the United Kingdom at\r\n12,500 tons per annum. When we consider the vast difference of price\r\nbetween chicory and coffee, as purchased by the wholesale dealer, the\r\ntemptation to its fraudulent use was obviously great, and there was no\r\npenal restriction against it.\r\n\r\nIt will be interesting and useful to trace the history of the trade in\r\nchicory from its first introduction.\r\n\r\nThe substitution of chicory for coffee occasioned a loss to the\r\nrevenue of three hundred thousand pounds sterling a-year, besides its\r\nmischievous effect in adulterating and debasing a popular beverage\r\nwhen used in such large and undue proportions for admixture, and sold\r\nat the price of coffee.\r\n\r\nSince the prohibition of the admixture of chicory with coffee, when\r\nsold to the public, and the compulsory sale by Treasury minute of the\r\ntwo articles in separate packages, a large and rapid increase in the\r\nconsumption of coffee has taken place, and the trade is now placed in\r\na healthy position. Whilst the increase in the consumption of coffee\r\nfrom the 1st of January, to 5th September, 1852, was but 142,267 lbs.\r\nas compared with the same period of 1851; the increase in the\r\nremaining four months of the year was to the amazing extent of\r\n2,350,368 lbs. This increased consumption is likely to continue, and\r\nour colonial possessions are furnishing us with larger proportionate\r\nsupplies, as may be seen by the following figures:--\r\n\r\n                      TOTAL IMPORTS OF COFFEE IN\r\n                 1848        1849        1850        1851        1852\r\n  Produce of     lbs.        lbs.        lbs.        lbs.        lbs.\r\n    British\r\n    Possessions\r\n               35,970,507  40,339,245  36,814,036  35,972,163  42,519,297\r\n  Ditto foreign\r\n    countries  21,082,943  22,976,542  13,989,116  17,138,497  11,857,957\r\n               ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------\r\n     Total     57,053,450  63,315,787  50,803,152  53,110,660  54,377,254\r\n\r\nIn the year 1832 chicory was first imported into England, subject to\r\na duty equivalent to that levied upon colonial coffee, and permitted\r\nto be sold by grocers _separately_ as chicory; but notices were at the\r\nsame time issued, that the legal penalties would be rigidly enforced,\r\nif discovered mixed with coffee.\r\n\r\nIn 1840, in consequence of memorials from the grocers and dealers in\r\nchicory, and also from the circumstance of exceedingly high rates then\r\nruling for coffee, together with the disruption of our commercial\r\nrelations with China, simultaneously advancing the price of tea (thus\r\nrendering both these popular beverages excessively dear to the\r\nconsumer), an order was issued from the Treasury to the Excise Board,\r\nauthorizing the admixture of chicory with coffee; a duty, however,\r\nbeing still maintained on the former of £20 per ton on the kiln-dried,\r\nand 6d. per lb. on the powdered root, when imported from abroad.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1845, the cultivation of chicory was introduced upon\r\nBritish soil, and, being a home-grown commodity, was exempt from duty,\r\nbut nevertheless, by virtue of the said Treasury Order, was permitted\r\nto enter into competition with a staple production of our own\r\ncolonies, contributing on its import a tax of 60 to 80 per cent. to\r\nthe revenue of the State.\r\n\r\nThe result, as might have been foreseen, necessarily created and\r\nstimulated a demoralizing system of fraud, unjust and destructive to\r\nthe interests of the coffee planter, and prejudicial to the national\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\nThe effects of so baneful a system being equally manifest upon both\r\nconsumption and revenue, they are here separately illustrated.\r\n\r\nIn 1824, according to the following high scale of duties, viz., 1s. on\r\nWest India, 1s. 6d. on East India, and 2s. 6d. on foreign, the Customs\r\nderived from coffee was £420,988; in the following year the rates were\r\nreduced one-half, and in the short space of three years the amount\r\nyielded had advanced to £440,245, an increase which steadily\r\nprogressed (partly aided by the admission of the produce of British\r\nIndia at the low duty) until it reached £921,551 in 1840. These\r\nsatisfactory results justified a further reduction of the duties in\r\n1842 to 4d. on colonial and 8d. (and in the subsequent year to 6d.) on\r\nforeign, under which the revenue declined in 1844 to £681,616. In 1846\r\nit had again reached to £756,838, and was gradually recovering itself,\r\nwhen this system of adulteration first began to extend itself\r\ngenerally, and since that time the revenue has rapidly declined under\r\nthe _same scale of duties_ to £566,822 in 1850.\r\n\r\nIn 1824 the quantity retained for home consumption was 8,262,943 lbs.,\r\nwhich was augmented to 11,082,970 lbs. in the first year of the\r\nreduction of duty, and continued to exhibit an increase at a rate\r\nrather exceeding two million pounds per annum until 1830, when coffee\r\nwould appear to have reached its limit of consumption without further\r\nstimulus, and remained stationary until the modification of duties\r\nallowing the admission of foreign coffee, _via_ the Cape, at the\r\ncolonial rate, when it advanced from 23,295,046 lbs. in 1835, to\r\n28,723,735 lbs. in 1840; and consequent upon a further reduction of\r\nduties in 1842, the elasticity of the trade experienced a still wider\r\ndevelopment, and an increase of nine million pounds is exhibited in\r\nthe next five years. From that period, however, the general use of\r\nchicory has not only checked the progressive increase of this healthy\r\ndemand, but an annual decline is observable to the extent of above six\r\nmillion pounds in 1850, as compared with 1847.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of April, 1851, with the view of partly remedying the\r\ngrievance of the colonists on this head, the duties were equalized and\r\nreduced to 3d. The results are, however, far from satisfactory, either\r\nin a fiscal or commercial point of view. It is true that an increase\r\nin consumption, of one-and-a-quarter million pounds has taken place,\r\nbut at the sacrifice of £121,000 of revenue. But this increase, it\r\nwill be seen, has not exceeded 4¼ per cent., whilst there has been a\r\ndiminution of 21½ per cent. in the revenue receipts. Upon\r\ninvestigation, moreover, it will be found that, notwithstanding the\r\n_total_ increase exhibited, there has been an actual falling off of\r\n894,778 lbs. of colonial coffee in 1851; the items for last year are,\r\nhowever, much more favorable and encouraging for the planters.\r\n\r\nNo reasonable cause can be assigned for this rapid and serious\r\ndiminution in the consumption of coffee, except the notorious\r\nsubstitution of chicory and other substances.\r\n\r\nThe arguments advanced to account for the falling off in the\r\nconsumption of coffee, by adducing the increase of tea and cacao for a\r\nsimilar period are fallacious, and contrary to the commercial\r\nexperience of many years, which convincingly proves these kindred\r\narticles to have always simultaneously increased, or diminished, in\r\nratio with the general prosperity of the kingdom, and the prevalence\r\nof temperate habits among the community.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to trace the fluctuations in the consumption of\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the last century the consumption of coffee was under\r\none million pounds yearly; the only descriptions then known in the\r\nLondon market were Grenada, Jamaica, and Mocha--the two former\r\naveraging about £5 per cwt., and the latter £20 per cwt. Grenada\r\ncoffee is now unknown, and Ceylon and Brazil are the largest\r\nproducers. In 1760, the total quantity of coffee consumed in the\r\nUnited Kingdom was 262,000 lbs., or three quarters of an ounce to each\r\nperson in the population. In 1833 the quantity was 20,691,000 lbs., or\r\n1½ lb. to each person. When first introduced into England, about the\r\nmiddle of the 17th century, coffee was sold in a liquid state, and\r\npaid a duty of 4d. per gallon; afterwards, until the year 1733, the\r\nduty was 2s. per lb.; it was then reduced to 1s. 6d., since which it\r\nhas paid various rates of duty; in the year 1824 it was settled at 6d.\r\nper lb. All descriptions of coffee now pay but 3d. per lb.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of coffee in the United Kingdom, for several years\r\nprevious to 1825, varied from seven millions and a half to eight\r\nmillions and a half pounds in round numbers, the duty being 1s. per\r\nlb. on British plantation, 1s. 6d. per lb. on East India, and 2s. 6d.\r\nper lb. on foreign. From the 5th of April of that year those rates\r\nwere each reduced to one half, and the immediate consequence was a\r\nsteady increase of the consumption until 1831, when it amounted to\r\n23,000,000 lbs. The consumption continued, without any material\r\nvariation, at this rate, or to advance by very slow degrees, until\r\n1836, when the duty on East India coffee was reduced to 6d. per lb.;\r\nand this change had precisely the same effect as the previous one, for\r\nthe consumption again advanced to upwards of 26,000,000 lbs., which\r\nwas then considered, in a memorial of the London trade, to be as much\r\nas our colonies were capable of producing! We now find, however, one\r\nsmall island, Ceylon, producing a fourth more than this amount\r\nannually.\r\n\r\nThe Belgians, a population of 4,500,000, consume more than 33,000,000\r\nlbs. of coffee annually; quite as much as is used by the whole\r\n35,000,000 French. The duty on 100 lbs. of coffee in France is more\r\nthan the common original cost--the Belgian duty not a tenth part; so\r\nthat the French do not use 1 lb. of coffee per head, while the\r\nBelgians consume 7 lbs. each per annum. The proportion in England is\r\nnot more than 1½ lb. per head to the population. The United States are\r\nthe largest consumers of coffee, as it is admitted into their ports\r\nfree of duty, and can therefore be sold for nearly the price per pound\r\nwhich the British Government levies on it for revenue. The entire\r\nconsumption of the United States and British North America, calling\r\ntheir population 23,000,000 and ours 30,000,000, exceeds ours, on an\r\nestimate of population, by sixfold. Thus the average consumption of\r\ncoffee by each American, annually, is about 8½ lbs., while the\r\nquantity used by each person in the European States is less than 1½\r\nlb.\r\n\r\nThe changes in the sources of supply, within the last fifteen or\r\nsixteen years, have been very remarkable. The British possessions in\r\nthe East have taken the place which our islands of the West formerly\r\noccupied. The British West Indies have fallen off in their produce of\r\ncoffee from 30,000,000 to 4,000,000 lbs. Ceylon which, fifteen years\r\nago, had scarcely turned attention to coffee, now exports nearly\r\n35,000,000 lbs. San Domingo, Cuba, and the French West India colonies\r\nare gradually giving up coffee-cultivation in favor of other staples;\r\nand it is only Brazil, Java, and some of the Central American\r\nRepublics that are able to render coffee a profitable crop. The export\r\ncrop of Brazil (the greatest coffee-producing country), grown in 1850,\r\nfor the supply of the year ending July, 1851, amounted to no less than\r\n302,000,000 lbs., of this a large quantity remained in the interior to\r\nsupply the deficiency of the current year.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely thirty years ago that the coffee-plant was first\r\nintroduced into Bengal by two refugees from Manilla; and the British\r\npossessions in the East Indies now yield 42,000,000 lbs. Sufficient\r\nextent has not yet been given to enable it to be decided in what\r\ndistrict of _Continental_ India it may be most advantageously\r\ncultivated. It is in the fine island of Ceylon, however, that\r\ncoffee-culture has made the most rapid progress.\r\n\r\nIt is an important fact that the supply of coffee from Ceylon, even at\r\nthe present moment, and irrespective of land already planted but not\r\nyet come into full bearing, is in excess of the whole consumption of\r\nGreat Britain, and the planter is thus compelled to carry the surplus\r\nto continental markets. The exports of coffee from Ceylon have been\r\nrather stationary the past three years, averaging about 300,000 cwt.\r\nIn the sixteen years ending with 1851, Ceylon had exported 130,083\r\ntons of coffee!\r\n\r\nThe present _produce_ of the various coffee-growing countries in the\r\nworld, may be set down at the following figures:\r\n\r\n\r\n                SOUTH AND CENTRAL AMERICA.\r\n                                             Millions of lbs.\r\n  Costa Rica                                        9\r\n  La Guayra and Porto Cabello                      35\r\n  Brazil                                          302\r\n  British West Indies                               8\r\n  French and Dutch West Indies                      7\r\n  Cuba and Porto Rico                              30\r\n  St. Domingo                                      33½\r\n\r\n                     ASIA  AND  THE  EAST.\r\n\r\n  Java                                            140\r\n  The Philippine Isles                              3\r\n  Celebes                                           1½\r\n  Sumatra                                           5\r\n  Ceylon                                           34\r\n  Malabar and Mysore                                5\r\n  Arabia (Mocha)                                    3\r\n                                                   ---\r\n                                                  616 = 275,000 tons.\r\n\r\nThis I have computed as accurately as possible from the most recent\r\nreturns, but it falls much below the actual capabilities of\r\nproduction, even with the trees at bearing, and land already under\r\ncultivation; and also, in a great measure, excludes the local\r\nconsumption in the producing countries. In many quarters there has\r\nbeen a considerable falling off in the production. The British West\r\nIndies, as we have seen, formerly exported 30,000,000 lbs., the French\r\nand Dutch West Indies 17,000,000, Cuba and Porto Rico 56,000,000, and\r\nSt. Domingo, in the last century, 76,000,000. The growth of coffee has\r\nbeen transferred from the West to the East Indies, and to the South\r\nAmerican Continent, where labor is more abundant, certain, and cheap.\r\nIn the East the increase in production has been enormous and\r\nprogressive, with, perhaps, the exception of Sumatra, which has fallen\r\noff from 15,000,000 lbs. to somewhere about one-third of that\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\nThe following statement may be taken as an approximate estimate of the\r\nactual _consumption_ of coffee at the present time:--\r\n\r\n                                           Millions of lbs.\r\n  Great Britain                                  32\r\n  Holland and Belgium                           125\r\n  France                                         33\r\n  German Customs Union                           95\r\n  Other German Countries not included            46\r\n    in the Union, and Austria\r\n  Switzerland                                    13\r\n  Mediterranean Countries                        20\r\n  Russia                                         12\r\n  Sweden and Denmark                             20\r\n  Spain and Portugal                             15\r\n  Cape of Good Hope and Australia                 6\r\n  United States and British America             170\r\n                                                ---\r\n                                                587\r\n\r\nA calculation made in the _Economist_, a year or two ago, gave the\r\nfollowing as the probable consumption:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                           Millions of lbs.\r\n  Holland and Netherlands                       108\r\n  Germany and North Europe                      175\r\n  France and South of Europe                    105\r\n  Great Britain                                  37\r\n  United States and British America             175\r\n                                                ---\r\n  Total                                         600\r\n\r\nBut this estimate is too high in some of the figures. Great Britain we\r\nknow, from the official tables only, consumes 34,000,000 lbs.\r\nannually; the United States and British America not so much as set\r\ndown by several millions; for the official returns of the imports of\r\ncoffee into the United States show an average for the three years\r\nending June, 1850, of less than 154,000,000 lbs.; although a writer in\r\na recent number of \"Hunt's Merchant's Magazine,\" New York, (usually a\r\nwell-informed periodical,) assumes a consumption of 200,000,000 lbs.,\r\nfor the North American States and Provinces.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of coffee produced being greater than the consumption\r\nthereof, the growth of it becomes less remunerative, and consequently\r\nwe may look for a decrease in the supply. Ceylon, as well as the West\r\nIndies generally, British and foreign, are likely to direct their\r\nattention to some more profitable staple. A diminished production may\r\nfurther be expected in Brazil, consequent on the extermination of the\r\nslave-trade and the more sparing exertion of the labour of the slaves.\r\nIn Cuba the want of labour is so much felt that large engagements have\r\nbeen entered into for the importation of Chinese; and there are many\r\nreasons for expecting a diminished production in Java, the next\r\nlargest coffee-producing country. The necessary consequence of this\r\nexpected decrease in the quantity of coffee produced will be, to bring\r\nthe produce as much below the wants of the consumers as it is now\r\nabove, and this must again result in an enhancement of prices in\r\nprocess of time.\r\n\r\nIf it were thought desirable to extend the production of coffee, there\r\nare many new quarters, besides the existing countries in which it is\r\nlargely cultivated, where it could be extensively grown. We may\r\ninstance Liberia and the western coast of Africa generally, the\r\ninterior ranges of Natal, the mountain-ranges on the northern coast of\r\nAustralia, from Moreton Bay to Torres Straits, &c., &c. But the\r\npresent production is more than equal to the demand; and unless a very\r\nlargely increased consumption takes place in the European countries,\r\nthe present plantations (colonial and foreign) are amply sufficient to\r\nsupply, for many years to come, all the demands that can be made upon\r\ntheir trees, a large proportion of which have yet to come into full\r\nbearing.\r\n\r\nThe coffee tree would grow to the height of fifteen or twenty feet if\r\npermitted, but it is bad policy to let it grow higher than four or\r\nfive feet. It comes to maturity in five years, but does not thrive\r\nbeyond the twenty-fifth, and is useless generally after thirty years.\r\nAlthough the tree affords no profit to the planter for nearly five\r\nyears; yet after that time, with very little labor bestowed upon it,\r\nit yields a large return.\r\n\r\nMr. Churchill, Jamaica, found that 1,000 grains of the wood, leaves,\r\nand twigs of the coffee tree, yielded 33 grains of ashes, or 3.300 per\r\ncent. The ashes consist of potass, lime, alumina, and iron in the\r\nstate of carbonates, sulphates, muriates, and phosphates, and a small\r\nportion of silica. According to Liebig's classification of plants, the\r\ncoffee tree falls under the description of those noted for their\r\npreponderance of lime. Thus the proportions in the coffee tree are--\r\n\r\n  Lime salts        77\r\n  Potass salts      20\r\n  Silica             3\r\n                   ---\r\n                   100\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to describe the cultivation of the tree and\r\npreparation of the berry, as carried on in different countries.\r\n\r\n_Cultivation of Mocha_--In Arabia Felix, the culture is principally\r\ncarried on in the kingdom of Yemen, towards the cantons of Aden and\r\nMocha. Although these countries are very hot in the plains, they\r\npossess mountains where the air is mild. The coffee is generally grown\r\nhalf way up on their slopes. When cultivated on the lower grounds it\r\nis always surrounded by large trees, which shelter it from the torrid\r\nsun, and prevent its fruit from withering before their maturity. The\r\nharvest is gathered at three periods; the most considerable occurs in\r\nMay, when the reapers begin by spreading cloths under the trees, then\r\nshaking the branches strongly, so as to make the fruit drop, which\r\nthey collect and expose upon mats to dry. They then pass over the\r\ndried berries a heavy roller, to break the envelopes, which are\r\nafterwards winnowed away with a fan. The interior bean is again dried\r\nbefore being laid up in store.\r\n\r\nThe principal coffee districts are Henjersia, Tarzia, Oudein, Aneizah,\r\nBazil, and Weesaf. The nearest coffee plantations are three-and-a-half\r\ndays journey (about 80 miles) from Aden.\r\n\r\nThe following information is derived from Capt. S.B. Haines of the\r\nIndian Navy, and our political agent at Aden. A camel load is about\r\n400 lbs = 25 frazlas or bales.\r\n\r\n                                               G.C.

Sherzee, best--price 1 G.C. frazla 25 butsha.\r\n  2. Ouceaime.\r\n  3. Muttanee.\r\n  4. Sharrazee.\r\n  5. Hubbal from Aniss.\r\n  6. Sherissee from ditto--price per frazla 1 G.C. 15 B.\r\n\r\nThe nearest place to Sana where the coffee tree grows, is at Arfish,\r\nhalf a day distant. Attempts have been made to introduce the shrub in\r\nthe garden of the Imaum at Sana, but without success, ascribed to\r\ncold. Kesher is more prized at Sana; the best is Anissea, and is sold\r\nat a higher price than other coffee, namely, g.c. 12 per 100 lbs.;\r\ninferior, at from 4, 5, and 6.\r\n\r\nRain falls in Sana three times in the year. 1st. In January, in small\r\nquantities. 2nd. Beginning of June, when it falls for eight or ten\r\ndays. By this time the seed is sown, and the cultivators look forward\r\nto the season with anxiety. 3rd. In July, when it falls in abundance.\r\nA few farmers defer sowing till this period, but it is unusual when\r\nthey expect rain in June.\r\n\r\nThe coffee plant is mostly found growing near the sides of mountains,\r\nvalleys, and other sheltered situations, the soil of which has been\r\ngradually washed down from the surrounding heights, being that which\r\nforms its source of support. This is afforded by the decomposition of\r\na species of claystone (slightly phosphoritic) which is found\r\nirregularly disposed in company with a few pieces of trap-rocks,\r\namongst which, on approaching Sana from the southward, basalt is found\r\nto preponderate. The clay stone is only found in the more elevated\r\ndistricts, but the debris finds a ready way into the lower country by\r\nthe numerous and steep gorges which are conspicuous in every\r\ndirection. As it is thrown upon one side of the valley, it is\r\ncarefully protected by means of stone walls, so as to present to the\r\ntraveller the appearance of terraces. The plant requires a moist soil,\r\nthough much rain does not appear necessary. It is always found in\r\ngreater luxuriance at places where there is no spring. The tree at\r\ntimes looks languid, and half withered; an abundant supply of water to\r\nthe root of the plant seems necessary for the full growth and\r\nperfection of its bean.\r\n\r\n_Progress of Cultivation in India_.--There are said to be ten\r\nvarieties of the coffee, but only one is found indigenous to India,\r\nand it is questionable if this is not the Mocha species introduced\r\nfrom Arabia. The cultivation of this important crop is spreading fast\r\nthroughout the east, and has been adopted in many parts of Hindostan.\r\nIn the Tenasserim provinces, on the table land of Mysore, in Penang,\r\nand especially in the islands of Bourbon and Ceylon, it is becoming\r\nmore and more an object of attention. It is known to have given good\r\nproduce in Sangar and the Nerbudda; also in Mirzapore, as well as\r\nDacca, and other parts of Bengal; Chota Najpore, Malabar, and\r\nTravancore. From three to four million pounds of coffee are now\r\nexported from the Indian presidencies annually. The highest quantity\r\nwas four and a quarter million pounds in 1845, but the progress of\r\nculture, judging from the export, has been small.\r\n\r\nOn the hilly districts on the east coast of the Gulf of Siam, the\r\ncultivation is carried on on a limited scale. The annual produce is\r\nnot much more than about 400 cwt., although it is understood to be\r\nincreasing. The quality of the berry is reckoned to be nearly equal to\r\nMocha, and it commands a high price in the English market.\r\n\r\nThe soil recommended in India is a good rich garden land, the\r\nsituation high and not liable to inundation, and well sheltered to the\r\nnorth-west, or in such other direction as the prevailing storms are\r\nfound to come from.\r\n\r\nA plantation, or a hill affording the shrubs shade, has been found\r\nbeneficial in all tropical climates, because, if grown fully exposed\r\nto the sun, the berries have been found to be ripened prematurely.\r\n\r\nThe spot should be well dug to a depth of two feet before the trees\r\nare planted out, and the earth pulverised and cleared from the roots\r\nof rank weeds, but particularly from the coarse woody grasses with\r\nwhich all parts of India abound.\r\n\r\nThe best manure is found in the decayed leaves that fall from the\r\ntrees themselves, to which may be added the weeds produced in the\r\nplantation, dried and burnt. These, then, dug in, are the only manure\r\nthat will be required. Cow-dung is the best manure for the seed-beds.\r\n\r\nThe seed reserved for sowing must be put into the ground quite fresh,\r\nas it soon loses its power of germination. Clean, well-formed berries,\r\nfree from injury by insects, or the decay of the pulp, should be\r\nselected.\r\n\r\nThese berries must be sown in a nursery, either in small, well-manured\r\nbeds, or in pots in a sheltered spot, not too close, as it is well to\r\nleave them where sown until they acquire a good growth; indeed, it is\r\nbetter if they are removed at once from the bed where they are sown,\r\nto the plantation. Here they should be planted as soon as they have\r\nattained two years of age, for, be it remembered, that if they are\r\nleft too long in the nursery, they become unproductive and never\r\nrecover. The distance at which they should be put out in the\r\nplantation need not exceed eight feet apart in the rows, between\r\nwhich, also, there should be eight feet distance. The seedlings appear\r\nin about a month after the seed is sown.\r\n\r\nThe culture requisite is, in the first instance, to afford shade to\r\nthe young plants; many consider that this shelter should be continued\r\nduring the whole period of their culture; but this is somewhat\r\ndoubtful, as it has been found that plants so protected are not such\r\ngood bearers as those which are exposed. The best plants for this\r\npurpose are tall, wide-branching trees or shrubs, without much\r\nunderwood. The other culture requisite is only to keep the ground\r\ntolerably clean from weeds, for which one cooly on from five to ten\r\nbiggahs is sufficient. He should also prune off decayed or dead\r\nbranches. This treatment must be continued until the fourth year, when\r\nthe trees will first begin bearing, and, after the gathering of each\r\ncrop, the trees will require to be thinned out from the superabundant\r\nbranches, their extremities stopped, and the tops reduced to prevent\r\ntheir growing above seven or eight feet in height; the stems, also,\r\nshould be kept free from shoots or suckers for the height of at least\r\none foot, as well as clear from weeds.\r\n\r\nIrrigation must be frequent during the first year that the plants are\r\nremoved to the plantation, and may be afterwards advantageously\r\ncontinued at intervals during the dry and hot weather, as a very hot\r\nseason is found unfavorable to the plant, drying up and destroying the\r\ntop branches and the extremities of the side shoots; whilst, on the\r\nother hand, a very long rain destroys the fruit by swelling it out and\r\nrotting it before it can be ripened: hence it is necessary to attend\r\nto a good drainage of the plantation, that no water be anywhere\r\nallowed to lodge, as certain loss will ensue, not only of the crop of\r\nthe current year, but most frequently of the trees also, as their\r\nroots require to be rather dry than otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe crop will be ready to gather from October to January, when the\r\nripe berries should be carefully picked from the trees by hand every\r\nmorning, and dried in the shade, the sun being apt to make them too\r\nbrittle; they must be carefully turned to prevent fermentation, and\r\nwhen sufficiently dry the husks must be removed, and the clean coffee\r\nseparated from the broken berries. After being picked out and put\r\naside, and then again dried, it is fit to pack. The first year's crop\r\nwill be less than the succeeding ones, in which the produce will range\r\nfrom ½ a lb. to 1 lb. in each year.--(Simmonds's \"Colonial Magazine,\"\r\nvol. xv.)\r\n\r\n_Ceylon_.--Coffee is stated to have been introduced into this island\r\nfrom Java, somewhere about the year 1730. It was extensively diffused\r\nover the country by the agency of birds and jackalls. In 1821 its\r\ncultivation may be said to have partially commenced, and in 1836, it\r\nhad become widely extended through the Kandyan provinces.\r\n\r\nIn 1839 not a tree had been felled on the wide range of the Himasgaria\r\nmountains. In 1840 a small plantation was, for the first time, formed.\r\nIn 1846 there were fifty estates, then averaging, each, 200 acres of\r\nplanted land, and yielding an average crop of 80,000 cwt. of coffee.\r\nEvery acre is now purchased in that locality, and in large tracts, or\r\nthere would have been twice the number of estates in cultivation. In\r\n1848, the Galgawatte estate, situate in this range, at an elevation of\r\n4,000 feet, containing 246 acres, of which 72 were planted, was\r\npurchased by Mr. R.D. Gerard, for £1,600.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of land which had been brought under cultivation with\r\ncoffee in this island in the ten years previous to the last reduction\r\nof duty in 1844, was, in round numbers, 25,000 acres; but so rapid was\r\nthe subsequent increase, that in the succeeding three years, that\r\nextent of land was doubled; so that, in 1847, there were upwards of\r\n60,000 acres of land under cultivation with coffee, giving employment\r\nto 40,000 immigrant coolies from the continent of India, and upwards\r\nof two millions of capital were invested in the cultivation of this\r\nstaple.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of land under culture with coffee by Europeans, was about\r\n55,000 acres in 1851. Allowing 20,000 acres to produce the quantity of\r\nnative coffee exported, and 5,000 for that consumed in the island, the\r\ntotal extent of coffee cultivation in Ceylon, European and native,\r\nwill be 80,000 acres.\r\n\r\nThe produce exported in 1849 was 373,593 cwt., while in the year 1836,\r\nwhen attention was first directed to this island as a coffee-producing\r\ncountry, the crop was not more than 60,330 cwt. Large profits were\r\nmade by the first planters, more capital was introduced, until,\r\nbetween the years 1840 and 1842, the influx of capitalists, to\r\nundertake this species of cultivation, completely changed the face of\r\nthe colony, and enlarged its trade, and the produce of coffee in\r\nsixteen years has increased sixfold.\r\n\r\nThe general culture resembles the practice in Java. Of the Ceylon\r\ncoffee, that grown about Ramboddi fetches the highest price, from the\r\nsuperiority of the make, shape, and boldness of the berry. The weight\r\nper bushel, clean, averages 56 lbs.; 57½ lbs. is about the greatest\r\nweight of Ceylon coffee. The lowest in the scale of Ceylon plantation\r\ncoffee is the Doombera, which averages 54½ lbs., clear, per bushel.\r\nThe following have been the prices of good ordinary Ceylon coffee in\r\nthe port of London for the last eight years in the month of January,\r\n1853, 46s. to 48s.; 1852, 40s. to 42s.; 1851, 38s. 6d. to 40s. 6d.;\r\n1850, 56s. 6d. to 57s. 6d.; 1849, 31s. to 32s. 6d.; 1848, 31s. 6d. to\r\n33s.; 1847, 39s. 6d. to 41s. 6d.; 1846, 49s. to 50s.\r\n\r\nForest lands are those usually planted in Ceylon, and the expense\r\nattendant on clearing and reclaiming them from a state of nature, and\r\nconverting them into plantations, is estimated to average £8 per acre.\r\nThe lowest upset price of crown lands in the colony is £1 per acre.\r\n\r\nCoffee planting has failed over a considerable portion of the southern\r\nprovince of the island, where the experiment was tried. The\r\ntemperature was found to be too equable, not descending sufficiently\r\nlow at any time to invigorate the plant; which, though growing\r\nluxuriantly at first, soon became weak and delicate. Nurseries are\r\nestablished for young plants. The districts in which the coffee is\r\nprincipally cultivated, extend over nearly the whole of the hilly\r\nregion, which is the medium and connecting link between the\r\nmountainous zone and the level districts of the coast.\r\n\r\nThe mania for coffee planting has recently subsided, in consequence of\r\nthe barely remunerative returns at which that article has been sold,\r\nascribable partly to over-production, and in some measure, perhaps, to\r\nthe temporary glut of foreign coffee thrown on the British market by\r\nthe reduction of the duty. As regards the yield, some estates in\r\nCeylon have produced upwards of 15 cwt. per acre, but it is a good\r\nestate that will average seven, and many do not give more than 4 cwt.\r\nthe acre.\r\n\r\nThe shipments from Colombo for five years, are stated below, with the\r\nclass of coffee:--\r\n\r\n         Plantation.

The\r\nconsumption of coffee, although for a long time stationary in Britain,\r\nnow that adulteration is no longer legalised, is likely to increase as\r\nrapidly as in other parts of the world; and it appears pretty evident\r\nthat, so long as anything like remunerative prices can be obtained,\r\nCeylon will do her part in supplying the world with an article which\r\noccupies the position of a necessary to the poor as well as a luxury\r\nto the rich. The exports of coffee from this colony have, within a few\r\nthousands of hundredweights, been nearly quadrupled since 1843, when\r\nonly 94,000 cwts. were sent away.\r\n\r\nDr. Rudolph Gygax, in a paper submitted to the Ceylon Branch of the\r\nRoyal Asiatic Society, offered remarks on some analyses, of the coffee\r\nof Ceylon, with suggestions for the applications of manures.\r\n\r\n    \"Having had,\" he observes, \"my attention drawn to an account of an\r\n    analysis of the Jamaica coffee berry, made by Mr. Herapath, the\r\n    Liverpool chemist, I have paid some little attention to the subject\r\n    of the coffee plant of this island, forming, as it does, so very\r\n    important a feature in the resources of this colony. The desire that\r\n    I thus felt for obtaining some information regarding the constituent\r\n    parts of the Ceylon tree and its fruit, was heightened by a\r\n    knowledge of the fact, that not a few of those coffee estates, which\r\n    once gave good promise of success, are now in a very precarious\r\n    state of production.\r\n\r\n    I much regret that the means at my disposal have not allowed me to\r\n    carry out any _quantative_ analysis, but the result of my labours\r\n    are sufficiently accurate for my present purpose. I have analysed\r\n    the wood and fruit of trees from two different localities, as well\r\n    as the ashes of some plants sent me from the Rajawella estate near\r\n    Kandy, and they all tend to bear out the result of Mr. Herapath's\r\n    inquiries. Placing the substances traced in the coffee plant in the\r\n    order in which they occur in the greatest quantity, they will stand\r\n    thus:--\r\n\r\n    Lime, potash, magnesia, phosphoric acid, other acids.\r\n\r\n    Of these lime is by far the most prominent, forming about 60 per\r\n    cent. of the whole.\r\n\r\n    I cannot help, therefore, arriving at the conclusion that, to\r\n    cultivate coffee with any degree of success, the first-named\r\n    substance must be present in the soil; or, if not present, must be\r\n    supplied to it by some process.\r\n\r\n    Now it is a singular fact that the rocks and soils of Ceylon are\r\n    greatly deficient in alkaline matter; and, taking this view of the\r\n    case, one no longer wonders that many estates cease to produce\r\n    coffee. That all, or nearly all the plantations did, in their first\r\n    year or two of bearing, produce liberally in fruit, may readily be\r\n    accounted for by the fact that the alkaline poverty of the soil was\r\n    enriched by the burning of the vast quantities of timber which lay\r\n    felled on all sides. Whilst this temporary supply lasted, all was\r\n    well with the planter. Heavy rains, and frequent scrapings of the\r\n    land with the mamotie, or hoe, soon dissipated this scanty supply,\r\n    and short crops are now the consequence.\r\n\r\n    But nature, ever bountiful, ever ready to compensate for all\r\n    deficiencies, has provided to our hands a ready means of remedying\r\n    this evil of the soil, by scattering throughout most parts of the\r\n    interior supplies of dolomitic limestone. The dolomite of Ceylon is\r\n    not pure, far from it, being mixed freely with apatite or phosphate\r\n    of lime. Even in this very accidental circumstance the coffee\r\n    planter is aided; for the phosphoric acid thus combined with the\r\n    limestone is the very substance required in addition. Some of the\r\n    finest properties in the island are situated on a limestone bottom,\r\n    and these no doubt will continue to yield abundant crops for a very\r\n    long period.\r\n\r\n    It has been urged against this opinion that in some districts where\r\n    coffee planting has proved a complete failure, dolomite is found\r\n    most abundantly; but I have very little doubt that the dolomite\r\n    here alluded to is only _magnesian_ limestone, and which is most\r\n    inimical to the coffee bush.\r\n\r\n    I am aware that already several manures have been tried on coffee\r\n    with varying degrees of success. Guano has, I believe, quite failed,\r\n    and is besides very costly. Cattle manure is said to be effective,\r\n    and no doubt it is, but it is a costly and troublesome affair.\r\n    Bones, ground fine, are now being tried, though they cannot but\r\n    prove most expensive, especially when imported.\r\n\r\n    A ton of bone dust contains of animal matter, 746 lbs,; phosphates\r\n    of lime, &c., 1,245 lbs.; carbonates of lime, &c., 249 lbs.\r\n\r\n    The virtue of bones lies in the phosphates far more than in the\r\n    animal matter, and thus their action on soils is felt for many years\r\n    after their application. The Singalese cultivators of paddy about\r\n    Colombo and Galle, appear to have been long aware of the fertilizing\r\n    effects of this kind of manure, and import the article in dhonies\r\n    from many parts of the coast: they bruise them coarsely before\r\n    applying them.\r\n\r\n    The partially decomposed husks of the coffee berry have been tried\r\n    for some years, and successfully, but they are difficult of\r\n    collection, and bulky to remove from one part of the estate to\r\n    another.\r\n\r\n    In Europe it would appear that little is yet known as to the causes\r\n    of the fertilising effects of oil cake: some suppose them to arise\r\n    mainly from the oil left by the crushing process, but this is not at\r\n    all clear. I do not, however, see that we must look for much\r\n    assistance from Poonac as a manure for coffee: for the cocoanut tree\r\n    it is doubtless most valuable, but we have yet to learn that, beyond\r\n    supplying so much more vegetable matter, it helps the action of the\r\n    soil on the roots of the coffee bush, which, after all, is what is\r\n    really required.\r\n\r\n    For the proper application of the dolomite to land as manure, it\r\n    should be freely burnt in a kiln, with a good quantity of wood, the\r\n    ashes of which should be afterwards mixed with the burnt lime, and\r\n    the whole exposed for several days to the action of the air,\r\n    sheltered of course from the weather. The mixture should be applied\r\n    just before the setting in of the monsoon rains: if the land be\r\n    tolerably level, the lime may be scattered broadcast on the surface,\r\n    though not quite near the plants. When the estate to be manured is\r\n    steep, then the substance to be applied should be placed in ridges\r\n    cut crossways to the descent of the slopes.\r\n\r\n    About one cwt. to the acre would be ample for most lands; some may,\r\n    however, require more. The contents of the husk pits might\r\n    advantageously be mixed up with the burnt lime, when a sufficiency\r\n    of it has been saved.\r\n\r\nA planter in Ambagamoe states that he has tried the following remedy\r\nfor that destructive scourge, the coffee-bug, with great success.\r\n\r\nHe applies saltpetre in a finely-powdered state, dusted over the tree\r\nwhen wet with rain or dew. The operation is inexpensive, as a very\r\nsmall quantity suffices, one cwt. being sufficient for nine or ten\r\nacres. It can be applied through a bamboo-joint covered with a\r\nperforated top, or any equally simple contrivance.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Worms' are reported to have found coco-nut oil an effectual\r\nremedy.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the question of manures:--\r\n\r\nPoonac, the marc or cake, after the coco-nut oil is expressed, is\r\nrepresented to be a stimulating manure; but is not durable. Lime is an\r\nuseful application, especially to stiff soils, as the coffee tree\r\ncontains 60 parts of lime. Bone-dust is an excellent fertiliser, but\r\nin Ceylon it is found that it cannot be applied at a less expense than\r\n£5 per acre. Cattle manure is the cheapest and most available. Guano\r\ndoes not seem suitable.\r\n\r\n_Peeling, pulping, and winnowing._--The coffee-peeler, used for\r\nseparating the bean from the pellicle, was formerly a large wheel\r\nrevolving in a trough, the disadvantage of which was the flattening\r\nmore or less of the bean when not thoroughly dry. A new machine has\r\nbeen recently introduced, the invention of Mr. Nelson, C.E., of the\r\nCeylon iron works, by which this evil is obviated; its principle being\r\nnot weight, but simple friction, of sufficient force to break the\r\nparchment at first, and, when continued, to polish the bean free from\r\nthe husk. A very simple winnowing machine for cleaning the coffee as\r\nit comes out of the peeler, is attached. From the winnowing machine it\r\nruns into the separating machine, which sorts it into sizes, and\r\nequalizes the samples, by which a vast amount of time and manual\r\nlabour are saved. The same principle is intended to be applied by Mr.\r\nNelson to pulping, which will obviate the injury now inflicted by the\r\ngrater upon the fresh berry. In spite of the greatest care numbers of\r\nthe beans in a sample, on close examination, will be found scratched\r\nor pecked; and when the closest attention is not paid, or the person\r\nsuperintending the process is devoid of mechanical skill, the injury\r\nis proportionate.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary pulping-mill in use, consists of a cylinder of wood or\r\niron, covered with sheet brass or copper, and punctured similarly to a\r\nnutmeg grater. This cylinder, technically called the barrel, runs upon\r\na spindle, which turns a brass pick on each side of a frame.\r\nImmediately in a line with the centre upon which it turns, and placed\r\nvertical to each other, are two pieces of wood, frequently shod with\r\niron of copper, called \"the chops,\" placed about half an inch apart,\r\nor sufficient to allow the passage of \"parchment\" coffee between them.\r\nThe lower chop is placed so close to the barrel, yet without contact,\r\nthat all coffee must be stopped by it and thrown outwards. The upper\r\nchop is adjusted to that distance only which will permit the cherry\r\ncoffee to come into contact with the barrel; but will not allow the\r\nberries to pass on till they have been denuded of their red epidermis\r\nby a gentle squeeze against its rough surface. The far greater portion\r\nof the pulps are separated by being carried past the lower chops upon\r\nthe sharp points of the copper, and thrown out behind, and a few are\r\nleft with the parchment coffee. As from the different sizes of the\r\nberries, and their crowding for precedence as they descend from the\r\nhopper above to the gentle embrace of the barrel and upper chop, some\r\npass unpulped, the coffee as it comes from the lower chop is made to\r\nfall upon a riddle, which separates the unpulped cherries. These are\r\nput back again, and passed through a pulper with the upper chop set\r\ncloser. The secret of working-appears to be the proper setting of the\r\nchops, and many have been the schemes proposed for reducing this to a\r\ncertainty. Perhaps, after all, few plans are better than the old\r\nwedges, by tightening or loosening of which the chop is kept in the\r\nrequired position. Within the last few years, the machine has been\r\nconsiderably improved by being formed entirely of iron, cog-wheels\r\nbeing substituted in the place of straps and drums to move the riddle,\r\nand the riddle itself is now formed of two sieves, by which the chance\r\nof unpulped berries reaching the parchment is lessened. On some\r\nestates, water-wheels have been put up to drive several pulpers at one\r\ntime, which otherwise would require from two to four men each to work\r\nthem, but from the costly buildings and appurtenances which such\r\nmachinery renders necessary, they are rare.\r\n\r\nAlthough the operation of pulping is so simple, it is one which\r\nrequires the machine to be set in such a way that the greatest\r\nquantity of work may be done, or, in other words, the smallest\r\nquantity of unpulped berries be allowed to pass through. On the other\r\nhand, the berries must not be subjected to injury from the barrel; for\r\nif the parchment skin is pricked through, the berry will appear, when\r\ncured, with an unsightly brown mark upon it. Several new coverings for\r\nbarrels, instead of punctured copper, have been tried; among others,\r\ncoir-cloth and wire net, but the old material is not as yet\r\nsuperseded. After pulping, the coffee in parchment is received into\r\ncisterns, in which it is, by washing, deprived of the mucilaginous\r\nmatter that still adheres to it. Without this most necessary\r\noperation, the mucilage would ferment and expose the berry to injury,\r\nfrom its highly corrosive qualities.\r\n\r\nAs some portion of pulp finds its way with the coffee to the cistern,\r\nwhich, if suffered to remain would, by its long retention of moisture,\r\nlengthen the subsequent drying process, various methods have been\r\nadopted to remove it. One mode is to pass the coffee a second time\r\nthrough a sieve worked by two men; another to pick it off the surfaces\r\nof the cistern, to which it naturally rises.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1846, premiums were awarded by the Ceylon Agricultural\r\nSociety to Messrs. Clerihew and Josias Lambert for the improvements\r\nthey had introduced into coffee-pulpers, which, by their exertions,\r\nhad been brought to great perfection. The first improved complete\r\ncast-iron pulper received in the island, was made for Mr. Jolly, from\r\ndrawings sent home by Mr. Lambert to Messrs. B. Hick and Son,\r\nengineers. This pulper is one of the most perfect in every respect\r\nthat has yet been brought into use, the disadvantages belonging to the\r\nold machine having been entirely remedied. The sieve crank has a\r\ndouble eccentric action. The chops are regulated by set screws, and\r\nthe sieve suspended in a novel and secure manner, the whole combining\r\nstrength and efficacy, together with an elegance of form, which will\r\nlikewise be appreciated.\r\n\r\nMr. W. Clerihew, of Ceylon, submitted to the Great Exhibition a model\r\nof his approved apparatus for drying coffee (which has been patented\r\nin the name of Robert R. Banks, Great George Street, Westminster), and\r\nreceived the Isis gold medal for the same. The intention is to dry the\r\nvegetable and aqueous moisture of the berry. Before this is required,\r\nthe coffee has previously undergone the process of pulping, or\r\nremoval from the soft fleshy husk. Here let Mr. Clerihew describe the\r\nadvantages for himself--\r\n\r\n    \"When the coffee berry is picked from the tree it bears a closer\r\n    resemblance to a ripe cherry, both in size and appearance; and\r\n    several processes have to be gone through before the article known\r\n    in commerce as coffee is produced. In the first place, the pulpy\r\n    exterior of the cherry has to be removed by the process of pulping,\r\n    which separates the seed and its thin covering called the parchment,\r\n    from the husk. When the pulping process is completed, we have the\r\n    parchment coffee by itself in a cistern, and the next process\r\n    consists in getting rid of the mucilage with which it is covered.\"\r\n\r\nHaving become assured, both by experiment and by Liebig's reasoning,\r\nthat the successive stages of decomposition were wholly ascribable to\r\nthe action of the stagnant air which occupies the interstices between\r\nthe beans, and taking into account that a mass of coffee presented a\r\nmedium pervious to air, it occurred to Mr. Clerihew that it was\r\npossible, by means of fanners, working on the exhausting principle, so\r\nto withdraw air from an enclosed space as to establish a current of\r\nair through masses of coffee spread on perforated floors forming the\r\ntop and bottom of that space. The plan he carried into execution at\r\nRathgoongodde plantation in 1849. No sooner was the plan put in\r\noperation than, instead of stagnant air occupying the interstices of\r\nthe beans and gradually acting on them, a stream of air was\r\nestablished and flowing through the mass of coffee, each bean of it\r\nbecame surrounded by a constantly renewed atmosphere of fresh air.\r\n\r\n_Java_.--When Arabia enjoyed the exclusive monopoly of coffee, it\r\ncould not be foreseen that one day the island of Java would furnish\r\nfor the consumption of the world from 125 to 130 millions of pounds\r\nper annum. The cultivation was introduced by M. Zwaendenkroom, the\r\nGovernor-General of Batavia, who obtained seeds from Mocha, in 1723.\r\nAccording to official statements the following are the exports.\r\n\r\nIn 1839 there were exported 46,781,729 kilogrammes, valued at 48\r\nmillion florins. Eight years labor, 1833 to 1841, brought its produce\r\nof coffee from 12 million kilogrammes annually, up to 55 millions.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, the exports were 916,876 piculs, but, in 1850 they were only\r\n14,801 piculs. The total coffee crop of Java was in 1850, 1,280,702\r\nlbs.; in 1851, 1,436,171 lbs.; in 1852, 1,229,349 lbs.\r\n\r\n                                                     1840          1841\r\n  Residences in which this produce has been\r\n    cultivated in 1840 and 1841                           20            20\r\n  Number of families destined for the labor          470,673       453,289\r\n  Trees which have yielded a crop                916,193,894   216,085,600\r\n  Trees which have produced the average quantity\r\n    of a picul of 125 lbs. Dutch                         280           248\r\n  Quantity of coffee furnished to the godowns\r\n    in piculs                                        706,258       877,444\r\n  Trees according to the reckoning made in the\r\n    month of March, 1841 and 1842                336,922,460   329,898,936\r\n\r\nThe comparative result of this table shows--1st. That, in the year\r\n1841, coffee had been gathered from 20,000,000 more trees than the\r\nnumber in 1840, and that the crop had increased by 171,000 piculs.\r\n\r\n2nd. That, in the month of March, 1842, there were above 7 millions\r\nless of coffee trees than in 1840. This diminution is merely nominal,\r\nseeing that these trees have served to replace those which by their\r\nsmall produce have to be suppressed in the lowlands of the residency\r\nof Baylen. On the contrary, the increase of trees, planted from 1839\r\nto 1840, amount to very nearly the same number, of 7 millions.\r\n\r\n3rd. That, in the season of 1842, there was planted nearly 20 millions\r\nof plants; of which 12 millions are to serve to replace the old trees,\r\nand 8 millions are destined to extend this culture. It is calculated\r\nthat this island will very soon be in a condition to produce a million\r\nof piculs or 125 millions more of Dutch pounds of coffee. Previous to\r\n1830, Java scarcely exported as much as 40 millions of pounds.\r\n\r\n_Cultivation and Preparation of Coffee in Java_.--For the following\r\nvaluable details I am indebted to M. de Munnick, the inspector of the\r\nagricultural department, Batavia, as contributed to my \"Colonial\r\nMagazine\" (vol. xi. p. 46).\r\n\r\n_Soil and Situation_.--Elevated lands are found to be those best\r\nsuited for the growth of coffee in Java. Land situated between 1,000\r\nand 4,000 feet above the level of the sea may be generally said to be\r\nadapted to the cultivation of coffee. It must not be taken for granted\r\nthat all ground of less elevation is unsuited. Suitable ground is to\r\nbe found lower down, but the cultivation on it is more difficult; the\r\ntree gives less fruit, and the plant is less durable. Valleys lying\r\nbetween high mountains are more especially fit for coffee plantations,\r\nbecause the soil which is washed down from the heights affords fresh\r\nfood continually to the lowlands; the valleys themselves are moist,\r\nsince the hills surrounding them attract the rain; and they are shut\r\nout from severe winds by the same protecting enclosure. The soils best\r\nsuited to the successful growth of coffee may be classed as follows:--\r\n\r\n_Firstly_. Cleared forest lands, especially those in which the black\r\nleafy, or vegetable mould is found to considerable depth. These are\r\nthe richest grounds, and will support the coffee plant for many years,\r\nand they are also cultivated with the least trouble.\r\n\r\n_Secondly_. Dark brown soils, approaching to black, which, without\r\nhaving much clay in them, appear to the eye to have a mixture of\r\ncoral. The greater the depth of this coral-like stratum, and of the\r\nreddish or deep yellowish soil, the better is the ground for coffee.\r\nThis kind of land also has sufficient strength and substance to afford\r\nnourishment for many years to the plant; but it entails more trouble\r\nthan the before mentioned soils, because the young plant does not so\r\nspeedily strike root into it, and sometimes dies, so that provision\r\nhas to be made against failures.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly_. Reddish and loose ground, such as is generally found in\r\nthe neighbourhood of volcanic lands. This kind is frequently found\r\nwell adapted for coffee; it flourishes on such land luxuriantly, but\r\ndoes not last long, as the ground possesses less strength and\r\nnourishing substance.[6] By digging in different places we become\r\nbetter acquainted with the nature of the ground, but we may take it as\r\na rule, that rich old forest land on which many larger trees are\r\nfound, and plains covered with heavy underwood, most frequently offer\r\neligible sites for coffee plantations.\r\n\r\nGrounds in which loam is found, and stony soils, are unfit for coffee.\r\nBut I do not mean by \"stony soils\" land on which many stones are\r\nlying, for on that very account it may be most suitable; but I mean\r\nland which shows a pebbly stratum just below the surface, or such as\r\nis of a porous, stony nature. In the choice of situation care must be\r\ntaken to select that which is as much as possible protected against\r\nthe south-east wind, because its dry influence is very injurious to\r\nthe coffee plant, and also prevents the growth of the _Erythrina_\r\n(known here locally as the Dadap tree) which is so necessary for its\r\nshade. Flat grounds, or gentle declivities, are better than steep\r\nslopes; yet the latter can be well employed if proper care is taken.\r\n\r\n_Cultivation_.--After the ground has been cleared in the dry\r\nseason--that is, after the bushes have been rooted out, the\r\nundergrowth burnt off, and the thickets removed--ploughing is\r\ncommenced in September. When the ground has twice been deeply\r\nploughed, the weeds and roots must be brought together with the rake\r\nand carefully burnt. The depth of the ploughing must be regulated by\r\nthe nature of the ground. In all kinds of cultivation, deep ploughing\r\nis recommended, but in Java we ought not to plough deeper than the\r\nstratum of fertile soil, as a kind of subsoil may be wrought uppermost\r\ninjurious to plants, and which, before it can become fertile, must for\r\na year at least have been exposed to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe ground having been turned up, should be left exposed for some days\r\nto throw off the vapor arising from it; and must then be again\r\nploughed and cleared with the rake. After waiting for some days, it\r\nshould be ploughed for the fourth and last time, and made as clean and\r\nfriable as possible. In small plantations this is to be done with the\r\nspade, but on large estates the roller must be used. This roller\r\nconsists of a heavy piece of round wood, eight or ten feet long, to\r\nwhich a pole is fastened in the middle to have oxen harnessed to it.\r\nIt is drawn slowly over the ploughed land, and presses the clods to\r\nearth. To give it greater force, the driver sits or stands upon it.\r\n\r\nBefore the field has been properly ploughed and rolled in the above\r\nway, the middle of October will have arrived, and we then begin to\r\nopen a path through the plantation from the highest to the lowest\r\npoint, about two roods broad, and the whole of the land is then\r\ndivided into separate parcels. Portioning off the estates into\r\ndivisions of equal size is a system to be much recommended. By this\r\nmeans labor may be equally divided, superintended and inspected. Order\r\nand regularity, which are necessary in all things, are most especially\r\nrequired in cultivation on a large scale.\r\n\r\nThe size of these parcels is regulated by the nature of the estate. On\r\nflat or gently declining land they may be greater than on steep\r\ngrounds, because, in order to prevent the washing away of the soil on\r\nprecipitous land, the water must be led off by trenches, which of\r\nthemselves make the divisions of land smaller. On flat ground the\r\ndivisions may be each 625 square roods, each of which may contain, if\r\nplanted--\r\n\r\n                           Trees.\r\n  12 feet by 12              625\r\n  10   \"     10              900\r\n   8   \"      8             1406\r\n   6   \"      6             2500\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distance between the coffee bushes cannot be definitely laid down,\r\nas it depends on the nature of the soil. On the most fertile forest\r\nlands twelve feet by twelve is a good distance. Only on low and meagre\r\ngrounds, where the tree grows less luxuriantly and strong, can six\r\nfeet by six be reckoned a proper distance.\r\n\r\nBetween the divisions a path should be left, one rood in breadth.\r\nAlong the middle paths and by the side of the divisions drains must be\r\ncut, the former two feet in breath and depth, the latter one foot. The\r\ndrains along the divisions must be cut in such a way as to conduct the\r\nrain-water to the larger drains which flank the middle paths. On\r\nprecipitous ground, when the coffee is planted, small ridges should be\r\nraised between the rows, to prevent the rich earth from washing down\r\nin the heavy rains. The steeper the land is, the closer these ridges\r\nshould be; and care should be taken to incline them, so as to break\r\nthe descent, the direction of which they should in some degree follow.\r\nThe first ridges may be made with the branches of the trees which have\r\nbeen felled, or with the rubbish cleared from the ground on the first\r\nraking of it.\r\n\r\n_Placing the pickets._--When the ground has been worked and divided in\r\nthe above manner, the pickets are placed. These are slips of bamboo\r\none-and-a-half to two feet long. First--two long canes (which do not\r\nstretch like string), each one hundred feet long, are marked off in\r\nfeet according to the distance at which the planting is to take place;\r\nheavy stakes are made fast to each end of them, by which they can be\r\nwell secured on the ground. At the places where they are marked off in\r\nfeet, strings are fastened so tightly that they cannot be displaced;\r\nand then the canes are laid down and well fixed in the ground, one in\r\nthe length and the other in the breadth.\r\n\r\nPicketing does not give much trouble; it ensures regular planting, and\r\nmakes the daily inspection simple. The planting thus takes place in\r\nstraight lines, which give an ornamental appearance, and afterwards\r\nrenders the view over the whole plantation easy. At every place where\r\na string has been tied, a picket is stuck in the ground; then the cane\r\nis removed to another place, and so on till all the estate is marked\r\nout by pickets. After the picketing, a hole is made with the spade at\r\nevery mark; it should be a good foot broad and deep, and the earth\r\ninside should be made very fine and clear. The earth is now ready to\r\nreceive the coffee plant, and the time has only to be waited for when\r\nthe first rains fully begin.\r\n\r\n_Nurseries_.--In the month of October, or earlier, if coffee trees are\r\nnear at hand, nurseries must be prepared in the neighbourhood of the\r\nland about to be planted. This can be done in the ravines, or, if they\r\nare too far from the spot where the plants are wanted, pieces of\r\nground most convenient can be selected. If the ravines are preferred,\r\nplaces must be chosen which are shaded by trees not prejudicial to the\r\ncoffee plants. On ground where there is no trees, the nurseries may be\r\ncovered, at the height of four feet, with leaves of jack (_Artocarpus\r\nintegrifolia_), areca, or other palm trees, in a manner to admit the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nThe ground made loose and fine, coffee plants newly opening, or seeds\r\nonly, are planted or sown at a distance of four inches square; 500\r\nsquare roods will in this way furnish 648,000 plants, which are\r\nsufficient for an estate of 300,000 trees. Transplanting from\r\nnurseries is absolutely necessary in coffee cultivation, and the\r\ntrouble it costs is always doubly repaid. Having a choice of plants, a\r\nperson can be convinced he has taken none but healthy trees, and he\r\nproceeds therefore with a confidence of success. After the first year,\r\nall failures having been nearly replaced, the estate is fully planted,\r\nthe trees are of regular growth, and no useless clearing is\r\nrequired--a thing which is always necessary in irregular plantations.\r\nIt is easy also to pick the berries from the trees which are planted\r\nwith regularity; the work goes on smoothly; and, when the estate has\r\nlived its time, it may be abandoned altogether, without leaving\r\npatches of living trees here and there, which renders superintendence\r\nso very difficult.\r\n\r\nThere should always be a plentiful supply of plants, to give an ample\r\nchoice and to make up for failures. When plants are placed in the\r\nnurseries, they should not have more than two offshoots, or leaves,\r\nabove each other; and when the ball plants are transplanted, they\r\nshould not be higher than a foot, as large plants always give meagre\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nAt the end of November or beginning of December, if the nurseries are\r\nkept free from weeds, and, if necessary, occasionally watered, the\r\nplants will be about a foot high, and will have put forth 4 or 5\r\nleaves; they are then just fit to be transplanted. Then, the ground is\r\ncloven with the spade, at a distance of an inch and a half round the\r\nstem of the plant, to about three inches deep; the plant, with the\r\nball of earth adhering to it, is carefully lifted out of the ground,\r\nand the ball is wrapped in a jack, plantain, or other leaf, and tied\r\nto prevent the earth falling off; but, before the plants are thus\r\ntaken from the ground, it must be moistened to make the earth\r\nadhesive.\r\n\r\n_Planting the coffee trees_.--The plants, which, after the above\r\noperation are called \"ball plants,\" are then placed in a bamboo wicker\r\nframe, and are carefully carried by two men to the place where they\r\nare to be put into the ground. They are then taken out of the frame\r\nand placed in the holes next to the pickets. The pickets are removed,\r\nand the plant is fixed upright; the leaf surrounding the ball is made\r\nloose, but not taken away; the planter presses the plant down with his\r\nhand and fills up the hole with fine loose earth, and the business of\r\nplanting the coffee tree is finished.\r\n\r\n_Planting the Dadap tree_.--This is a species of Erythrina, probably\r\n_E. indica_, or _E. arborescens_; that used for the purpose in the\r\nWest Indies is _E. Corallodendrum_. In Java, as soon as the coffee is\r\nplanted, the operation of planting the dadap tree is commenced. The\r\nbest sort of dadap comes from Serp or Mienyak; it is smooth and\r\nbroad-leaved, and shoots up quickly. Thick young stems are chosen,\r\nabout three feet long, and the lower part is pointed off. If the dadap\r\nis moist or juicy, it should be cut twenty-four hours before it is\r\nplanted. The dadap is planted uniformly by measuring the cane in the\r\nsame way as the coffee itself. Between every two rows of coffee one of\r\ndadap is planted, not on a line with the coffee plants, but\r\nalternately with them; thus, if the coffee is eight feet by eight, the\r\ndadap is sixteen by sixteen. The dadap is planted to the depth of a\r\nfoot, with somewhat of a westerly inclination, in order that the\r\nmorning sun may fall on a larger surface of the stick. The ground must\r\nbe stiffly trodden round the bottom of the stem, and the upper part of\r\nit should have some kind of leaf tightly bound around it to prevent\r\nthe sap from escaping. When the coffee and dadap plants have thus been\r\nput out, every fifth day the young plantation should be carefully\r\ninspected, and a picket placed wherever there is a failure, as a mark\r\nto the planter that a new plant is there required. This operation of\r\nreplacing failures is carried on all through the wet season, and the\r\ndadaps which have not succeeded are at the same time changed.\r\n\r\n_Keeping up the estate_.--In the first six months after planting, the\r\nestate should be cleaned each fortnight with the hoe; the ground being\r\nwell moved and the weeds taken out. Those weeds which are too close to\r\nthe plants to be removed in this manner, must be pulled out with the\r\nhand. When the plantation is thus wholly or partially cleaned, the\r\nearth must be taken off the weeds, and they must be collected and\r\nthrown on the pathways.\r\n\r\nThe weeding in this manner gives at first a great deal of trouble, but\r\nit is most advantageous in the long run, as the weeds are thus easily\r\nkept down.\r\n\r\nGreat care must be taken to do away with an old custom of burying the\r\nweeds in large holes on the estates. It conduces to bad and slovenly\r\nhabits, such as cutting off the tops of the weeds by wholesale, and\r\nthus giving the plantation an appearance of cleanliness, whilst it, in\r\nfact, is as dirty as ever. This is soon discovered by the weeds\r\nshowing themselves again above ground in a very few days, and even if\r\nthey rot under ground, they breed insects which are very hurtful to\r\nthe bushes, and the seeds vegetate.\r\n\r\nAfter the first six months, this weeding will be sufficient if it\r\ntakes places once a month, but this must be persevered in till the\r\nthird year, when there may be a much greater interval between the\r\nweeding. When the trees are coming to full growth, the hoe should be\r\nless frequently used in cleaning; the hand must be used to the full\r\nextent to which the branches reach, as the roots of the tree spread to\r\na like distance, and if they are injured the growth of the tree is\r\nprejudiced.\r\n\r\nThe well-being of an estate chiefly depends on frequent cleaning of\r\nthe plantation in the beginning. The idea of some persons that\r\ncleaning in the dry season is of little consequence, must be given up,\r\nas it is principally at that very time that it is extremely profitable\r\nto remove and clear the ground round the trees in their growth. In the\r\nfirst place, this destroys the weeds which take the nourishment away\r\nfrom the trees; secondly, the ground is rendered more open to receive\r\nthe slight showers and dews which moisten it, and to benefit by the\r\ninfluence of the air; the roots are thus considerably refreshed. The\r\ndew falling on ground which has been recently moved, penetrates at\r\nonce into it, and does good to the plant; but if it falls on the\r\nweeds, the first rays of the sun absorb it, and deprive the tree of\r\nthis source of refreshment.\r\n\r\nThe dadap is to be taken care of whilst clearing goes on; it must be\r\ncropped so as to cause it to grow upright, and to throw as much shade\r\nas possible on the coffee without pressing upon it.\r\n\r\nIn warm fertile ground, where the coffee plant grows rapidly, the\r\ntrees should be topped in the third year; but this should be done\r\nsparingly, and as a general measure it is not to be recommended; it\r\nshould be resorted to only as a means to prevent the too rapid growth\r\nof the tree, or its running up to a point. Topping and taking off\r\nsuckers are both necessary on meagre soils, where the trees run much\r\nto wood; and it prevents the trees being injured in the picking\r\nseason, which often occurs without this precaution. The top or middle\r\nstem is broken off at a height of six or seven feet, but care must be\r\ntaken not to tear the tree; when the top shoots out again it must be\r\ncropped a second time, and it is seldom necessary to do this more than\r\ntwice. The cropping causes the tree to shoot out in breadth, and to\r\npush forth a greater number of sprigs, and good strong ones.\r\n\r\n_Picking coffee_.--When the estate becomes productive, it must in the\r\npicking season, just before the work begins, be kept exceedingly clear\r\nof weeds, and be even swept clean with brooms, in order that the\r\nberries which fall off may be gathered up.\r\n\r\nThe picking should take place under proper superintendence, the trees\r\nbe picked row by row, and care taken that each berry is plucked off\r\nseparately, and not a heap together, by which the trees are torn and\r\nthe first offshoots prevented. In picking high trees, light ladders\r\nshould be used, made out of two or three bamboos tied together.\r\n\r\n_Customary preparation of the berry in the pulp_.--When the coffee is\r\npicked and brought into the village, it is piled up in a heap in the\r\nopen air, and left in that manner for twenty-four hours. Thus heaped\r\nup it gets warm, and this creates a certain fermentation of the juice\r\nwhich is in the berry. That fermentation promotes the drying and\r\nloosens the silvery pellicle which is attached to the bean inside the\r\nparchment, and which cannot be entirely got rid of in any other way.\r\nCoffee which still retains that pellicle is called in trade \"grey\r\ncoffee,\" and is lower priced than good clean sorts. After the\r\nfermentation, the coffee is spread out in rather thick layers, and\r\nturned over twice a day. If it rains during this first spreading out,\r\nthe coffee does not require to be sheltered, as the washing causes the\r\njuicy substance to evaporate, and this accelerates the drying\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as the coffee becomes dryer, the thickness of the layer\r\nmust be reduced, and the turning over must be more frequent till the\r\ncoffee is quite dry outside and the pulp has become hard.\r\n\r\nThen the coffee is laid out on drying floors, which can be easily and\r\nspeedily covered in rainy or damp weather, and is dried by the\r\npowerful heat of the sun.\r\n\r\nThis system of drying in the pulp requires six weeks or two months, as\r\nit is advisable not to be over hasty with drying.\r\n\r\nWhen the coffee is entirely dry, it is either at once pounded or\r\nplaced in the stores to await that operation. In order to know if the\r\ncoffee be sufficiently dry, take a handful of it and shut your hand\r\nclose; shake it to your ear, and listen if the beans rattle freely in\r\nthe pulp. Or try them by biting the berry, and see if the bean and\r\npulp are both brittle and crisp, which shows that the fruit is dry\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of the coffee in the parchment, or the West India\r\nsystem_.--Only sound and fully ripe beans can be prepared in the West\r\nIndia manner. In picking, therefore, all unripe, green, or unsound\r\nbeans must be taken away to dry in the pulp. As soon as the coffee is\r\nbrought in, it must be pulped. This operation is performed by means of\r\nsmall peeling mills. These mills consist of two horizontal wooden\r\ncylinders rubbing on a plank; they are covered with hoop-iron, and set\r\nin motion by a water-wheel. The coffee is driven under the cylinder,\r\nand kept constantly moist; by being turned through the mill, the pulp\r\nis so bruised that the bean in the parchment falls from it into the\r\nbamboo open frame, which is placed in front of the mill. The coffee is\r\nthen pressed with the hand, and falls through the frame into a basket.\r\nThe pulp, and beans not rid of the pulp, remain on the frame; the\r\nfirst is cleared away, the rest passes a second time into the mill,\r\nand this operation is continued till all the coffee is stripped of\r\nthe pulp, and the parchment beans are in the basket. When the\r\nparchment coffee is thus separated from the outer skin, it is thrown\r\ninto the washing troughs, and remains there for twenty-four hours;\r\nthis drains from it the slimy substance adhering to it. After being\r\nthus steeped, it is washed with pure water two or three times in the\r\nbasket, so that it becomes quite free from slimy matter. The parchment\r\ncoffee is then spread out on drying frames, and exposed for six or\r\neight days to the heat of the sun, till the outside is perfectly dry.\r\nTo do this equally it must be stirred about every hour. These frames,\r\nwhich serve also to dry the coffee in the pulp, are made as\r\nfollows:--A bamboo roof is set up, resting on four wooden pillars, and\r\nsloping considerably; it is covered closely with reeds; its length is\r\nten feet, its breadth six feet; the pillars are from nine to ten feet\r\nhigh; a wooden framework is attached to this, about thirty feet long,\r\nor three times the length of the space covered by the roof. On this\r\nframe are brought out three platforms, one above the other, which are\r\npushed out by means of little rollers under them; they are ten feet\r\nlong by six broad, and six inches deep. The borders are of wood, and\r\nthe bottom of platted bamboo. In rainy weather, or when the drying\r\ncannot go on, the three platforms are pushed under the covered space.\r\nThese drying places are set up near the overseer's dwelling, where\r\nthey stand free, and are not shaded by trees or buildings. After this\r\nfirst drying on platforms, the parchment coffee is again dried inside\r\nthe house, and bamboo huts are for this purpose erected on each side\r\nof the outhouse of the planters. These huts have trays, divided into\r\ntwo or three compartments, one above the other, to keep the coffee\r\nseparate, according to the time of its having been picked. The\r\nparchment coffee is spread out as thin as possible, and turned over\r\nwith a small wooden rake every hour. In proportion to the dryness of\r\nthe weather, from one to two months are required to dry the coffee\r\nfully. In drying inside the houses, the greatest care must be taken to\r\nprevent heating the coffee; this is the great object of the West\r\nIndian system, as such heating is very prejudicial. On this account\r\nthe huts in which the platforms are placed must be very airy, so that\r\nthe wind may have good play among the trays, on which the coffee must\r\nbe thinly spread and frequently turned.\r\n\r\n_Pounding_.--Coffee in the pulp, as well as that in the parchment,\r\nmust, before being pounded, be exposed for some hours to the sun to\r\nmake it crisp and hard; but it must be allowed to cool again before\r\nthe pounding begins, or the beans will be liable to be broken.\r\n\r\nThe pounding is done in small baskets of a conical form, two feet\r\nhigh, at the top eighteen inches in diameter, and at the bottom one\r\nfoot. These baskets are, up to one-third of their height, thickly\r\nwoven round with coir, and fastened on the ground between four thick\r\nbamboo poles, and with the bottom half an inch in the ground itself.\r\nThe coffee is pounded by small quantities at a time with light, wooden\r\npestles; the baskets must not be more than half full. When the coffee\r\nis sufficiently pounded, the basket is lifted from between the poles\r\nand the beans are thrown into sieves, on which it is cleaned from\r\nskin, and white, black, or broken beans. According to the West Indian\r\nsystem, the coffee must now be instantly put in bags, to preserve its\r\ngreenish colour, which is very peculiar. If the green coffee is not\r\ninstantly sent to the packing stores to be bagged, it must be put up\r\nin a very dry place, and be turned over once every day, to prevent\r\nheating, which damps and discolors the berry.\r\n\r\nCoffee is grown to some extent in Celebes--the average crop being from\r\n10,000 to 12,000 piculs of 133 English pounds. The production has\r\nrather fallen off than increased during the last few years. The whole\r\nof the coffee grown must be delivered by the inhabitants to the\r\ngovernment exclusively, at twelve copper florins per picul. It is much\r\nprized in the Netherlands, and maintains a higher price in the market\r\nthan the best Java coffee. As the treatment of the product in Java\r\ndiffers wholly from that which is in vogue in Celebes, and this, in\r\nour eyes, is much inferior, I know not whether the higher price is\r\nascribable to the name, or to an intrinsic superiority in quality. It\r\nis certain that this cultivation is susceptible of much improvement,\r\nand might be advanced to a much higher condition.\r\n\r\nFrom tables given by M. Spreeuwenberg (\"Journal of the Indian\r\nArchipelago,\" vol. ii. p. 829) of the quantity of coffee delivered\r\nfrom each district of this island, for the years 1838 to 1842, it\r\nappears that the average annual delivery of coffee was 1,288,118 lbs.\r\n\r\nOf the production of Sumatra I have no details, but a very fair\r\nproportion is grown there--about five million pounds.\r\n\r\n_Production of America and the West Indies_.--The cultivation of the\r\ncoffee plant is largely carried on in South and Central America and\r\nthe West India Islands.\r\n\r\nIts culture has greatly increased within the last few years in\r\nVenezuela, particularly in the valleys and on the sides of the hills.\r\nThe exports from La Guayra, in 1833, were about twelve millions of\r\npounds, being nearly double the quantity exported in 1830. The price\r\nthere is about ten dollars the 100 lbs., which is still too high to\r\nenable it to enter into competition with the produce of Brazil or\r\nCuba.\r\n\r\nThe total produce of coffee in Venezuela in 1839 was 254,567 quintals.\r\nThe quintal is about 10 lbs. less than the English cwt.\r\n\r\n_La Guayra_.--The exports of coffee from this port in 1796, were 283\r\nquintals.\r\n\r\n              Quintals.\r\n  1843        164,066\r\n  1844        141,934\r\n  1845        134,585\r\n  1846        175,346\r\n  1847        130,671\r\n  1850        179,537\r\n\r\nThe exports of coffee from La Guayra have been declining within the\r\npast few years; the shipments were but 153,901 quintals in 1851, and\r\nonly 124,623 in 1852.\r\n\r\nCaracas coffee ranks in our market with good ordinary St. Domingo.\r\n\r\nThe decline in the produce of coffee in the British West India\r\npossessions has been very great. In 1838, we imported from the West\r\nIndia Islands and British Guiana 17½ million pounds of coffee, in 1850\r\nwe only received 4¼ million pounds from thence. The shipments from\r\nJamaica have decreased from about 15 million pounds in 1836, to 4\r\nmillion pounds in 1850; Berbice and Demerara, from 5 million pounds in\r\n1837, to about 8,000 pounds in 1850.\r\n\r\n_Production of coffee in the Brazils_.--Forty-two years ago the annual\r\ncrop of coffee in Brazil did not exceed 30,000 bags, and even in 1820\r\nit only reached 100,000 bags. About that time the high price of coffee\r\nin England, superadded to the diminished production in Cuba,\r\nstimulated the Brazilian planters to extend its cultivation, and in\r\n1830 they sent to market 400,000 bags, or 64,090,000 lbs., and in\r\n1847, the enormous quantity of 300,000,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nIt would seem from the annexed figures that the production of coffee\r\nin Brazil doubled every five years, up to 1840, since when it has\r\nincreased eighty per cent. The increase since 1835 has been upwards of\r\ntwo hundred millions of pounds, and of that increase the United States\r\nhave taken one half.\r\n\r\n                  lbs.\r\n  1820         15,312,000\r\n  1825         29,201,600\r\n  1830         62,685,600\r\n  1835        100,346,400\r\n  1840        170,208,800\r\n  1850        303,556,960\r\n\r\nThe sources from whence the United States derives its supplies of\r\ncoffee are shown in the following table:--\r\n\r\n  Years.

Since 1832 it has been free.\r\n\r\nThe population of the United States in 1840 was, in round numbers,\r\nseventeen millions; the average consumption of coffee for the three\r\nyears ending 1841, 98½ millions of pounds, which gave a consumption of\r\n5¾ lbs. per head. The average for the three years ending 1850, was 143\r\nmillions of pounds, and the population was twenty-three millions,\r\nwhich gave a consumption of 6¼ lbs. per head. In 1830 the consumption\r\nwas only 3 lbs. per head; but the price ruled nearly double what it\r\nwas in the three years preceding 1850.\r\n\r\nIn 1821 the consumption per head, to the inhabitants of the United\r\nStates, was 1 lb. 4 oz. In 1830, the proportion had increased to 3\r\nlbs. per head, the foreign price having fallen fifty per cent. The\r\nimportation in the year 1831 doubled, in consequence of the reduced\r\nduty; and the consumption per head for the four years ending with\r\n1842, averaged 6 lb. per head, having quadrupled to each inhabitant\r\nsince 1821. From 1820 to 1840, the Brazilian product increased 1,100\r\nper cent, or 155 million pounds. In the same time the consumption in\r\nthe United States increased 137 million pounds; leaving an increase of\r\neighteen million pounds of Rio coffee, besides the enhanced products\r\nof all countries, to supply the increased consumption of England and\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe consequence of the duty in England is, that while the United\r\nStates, with a population of seventeen millions, consumed, in 1844,\r\n149,711,820 lbs. of coffee, Great Britain, with a population of\r\ntwenty-seven millions, consumed 31,934,000 lbs. only, or less than\r\none-fourth the consumption of the United States. In 1851 the figures\r\nremained nearly the same, viz., 148,920,000 lbs. in the United States,\r\nand 32,564,000 lbs. for Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of coffee forms the present riches of Costa Rica, and\r\nhas raised it to a state of prosperity unknown in any other part of\r\nCentral America. It was begun about fifteen years ago; a few plants\r\nhaving been brought from New Granada, and the first trial being\r\nsuccessful, it has rapidly extended. All the coffee is grown in the\r\nplain of San Jose, where the three principal towns are situated--about\r\ntwo-thirds being produced in the environs of the capital, a fourth in\r\nthose of Hindia, and the remainder at Alhajuela, and its vicinity. The\r\nland which has been found by experience to be best suited to coffee is\r\na black loam, and the next best, a dark-red earth--soils of a brown\r\nand dull yellow color being quite unsuitable. The plain of San Jose is\r\nmostly of the first class, being, like all the soils of Central\r\nAmerica, formed with a large admixture of volcanic materials. Contrary\r\nto the experience of Java and Arabia Felix, coffee is here found to\r\nthrive much better, and produce a more healthy and equal berry on\r\nplain land, than upon hills, or undulating slopes, which doubtless\r\narises from the former retaining its moisture better, and generally\r\ncontaining a larger deposit of loam.\r\n\r\nI am inclined, in a great measure, to attribute the practice of sowing\r\ncoffee in sloping land in Java to this fact, that the plains are\r\nusually occupied by the more profitable cultivation of sugar-canes. In\r\nArabia, the plains are generally of a sandy nature (being lands which\r\nhave, apparently, at no very distant geological period, formed the bed\r\nof the sea), which may account for the plantations existing only upon\r\nthe low hills and slopes.\r\n\r\nA coffee plantation in Costa Rica produces a crop the third year after\r\nit is planted, and is in perfection the fifth year. The coffee trees\r\nare planted in rows, with a space of about three yards between each\r\nand one between each plant, resembling in appearance hedges of the\r\nlaurel bay. The weeds are cut down, and the earth slightly turned with\r\na hoe, three or four times in the year; and the plant is not allowed\r\nto increase above the height of six feet, for the facility of\r\ngathering the fruit. The coffee tree here begins to flower in the\r\nmonths of March and April, and the berry ripens in the plains of San\r\nJose in the months of November and December, strongly resembling a\r\nwild cherry in form and appearance, being covered with a similar sweet\r\npulp.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the crimson color assumed by the ripe fruit indicates the\r\ntime for cropping, numbers of men, women, and children are sent to\r\ngather the berry, which is piled in large heaps, to soften the pulp,\r\nfor forty-eight hours, and then placed in tanks, through which a\r\nstream of water passes, when it is continually stirred, to free it\r\nfrom the outer pulp; after which it is spread out on a platform, with\r\nwhich every coffee estate is furnished, to dry in the sun; but there\r\nstill exists an inner husk, which, when perfectly dry, is, in the\r\nsmaller estates, removed by treading the berry under the feet of oxen;\r\nand in the larger, by water-mills, which bruise the berry slightly to\r\nbreak the husk, and afterwards separate it by fanners. The entire cost\r\nof producing a quintal (101 1-5 lbs. British) of coffee, including the\r\nkeeping of the estate in order, cleaning and fanning the plants, and\r\ngathering and preparing the berries, is, at the present rate of wages\r\n(two rials, or about a shilling per day), calculated at two and a half\r\ndollars (equal to ten shillings); but the laborers are now hardly\r\nsufficient for working all the estates which are planted, so that the\r\nprice may probably rise a little, though the present rate of payment\r\nenables the natives to live much better than has been their wont.\r\n\r\nThe coffee tree bears flowers only the second year, and its blossoms\r\nlast only 24 hours. The returns of the third year are very abundant;\r\nat an average, each plant yielding a pound and a-half or two pounds of\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\nThe price of coffee in San Jose during the months of February, March\r\nand April, after which none can generally be met with, was, in 1846,\r\nabout 5 dollars cash per quintal, the duty (which is collected for the\r\nrepairs of the road) one rial more, so that the speculator makes at\r\nleast ten rials, or about 20 per cent., by purchasing and sending the\r\ncoffee to the port, on his outlay and charges; but it is often\r\nbartered for manufactured goods, and is also purchased before-hand,\r\nhalf being paid in imports and half in cash to the grower.\r\n\r\nThe largest coffee estates of Costa Rica are possessed by the family\r\nof Montealegre and Don Juan Moira. The principal of these I have\r\nexamined. They appear to be very carefully and judiciously managed,\r\npossessing good mills for cleaning and husking the coffee, worked by\r\nwater power; and annually producing 500 tons. The entire produce of\r\nthe year 1836, amounted to about 3,000 tons, and the crop of 1847\r\nexceeded 4,000 tons, near which quantity it will probably continue,\r\ntill the population gradually increases, the laborers, as already\r\nmentioned, being barely sufficient for the present cultivation. As the\r\nvalue at the present average price in the English market of 50s. a\r\ncwt., will give £200,000, the produce of the district will appear\r\npretty considerable for a petty American State, possessing only 80,000\r\ninhabitants, and just emerging from a half-savage\r\ncondition.--(Dunlop's \"Central America.\")\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of coffee on the plains of San Jose, in Costa Rica,\r\naccording to Stephens, has increased rapidly within a few years. Seven\r\nyears before, the whole crop was not more than 500 quintals, and in\r\n1844 it amounted to 90,000.\r\n\r\nDon Mariano Montealegre is one of the largest proprietors there, and\r\nhad three plantations in that neighbourhood. One, which Mr. Stephens\r\nvisited, contained 27,000 trees, and he was preparing to make great\r\nadditions the next year. He had expended a large sum of money in\r\nbuildings and machinery; and though his countrymen said he would ruin\r\nhimself, every year he planted more trees. His wife, La Senora, was\r\nbusily engaged in husking and drying the berries. In San Jose, by the\r\nway (he adds), all the ladies were what might be called good\r\nbusiness-men, kept stores, bought and sold goods, looked out for\r\nbargains, and were particularly knowing in the article of coffee.\r\n\r\nThe coffee at Surinam is suffered to grow in three stems from the\r\nroot, and when one of them does not produce plenty of berries, it is\r\ncast away, and the best shoot in appearance next the root is allowed\r\nto grow in its room. The trees are not permitted to rise higher than\r\nabout five feet, so that the negroes can very easily pluck the\r\nberries, for gathering which there are two seasons, the one in May, or\r\nthe beginning of June, and the other in October or the beginning of\r\nNovember. The berries are often plucked of unequal ripeness, which\r\nmust greatly injure the quality of the coffee. It is true when the\r\ncoffee is washed, the berries which float on the water are separated\r\nfrom the others; but they are only those of the worst quality, or\r\nbroken pieces, while the half-ripe beans remain at the bottom with the\r\nrest. Now, in the description I have given of the method of gathering\r\ncoffee in Arabia, it is seen that the tree is suffered to grow to its\r\nnatural height, and the berries are gathered by shaking the tree, and\r\nmaking them fall on mats placed for them. By this way the Arabians\r\nharvest only the beans perfectly ripe at the time, and which must give\r\nthe coffee a more delicate flavor. A tree will yield each time on an\r\naverage from 1 lb. to 1½ lb. of coffee, when pulped and perfectly\r\ndried. An acre of land planted with coffee, when favored by the\r\nweather, becomes more profitable than when it is planted with sugar\r\ncanes; but its crops are always very precarious, as the blossoms, and\r\neven the berries, are sometimes damaged by the heavy rains, which are\r\nmuch less injurious to sugar canes; wherefore a planter feels himself\r\nbest secured in his revenue, as soon as he can cultivate them both.\r\n\r\nNothing can exceed the beauty of the walks planted with coffee trees,\r\nfrom their pyramidical shape and from their glossy dark green leaves,\r\nshining with great brightness, amongst which are hanging the\r\nscarlet-coloured berries. Mr. Baird, in his \"Impressions of the West\r\nIndies,\" thus speaks of a coffee plantation:--\r\n\r\n    \"Anything in the way of cultivation more beautiful, or more\r\n    fragrant, than a coffee plantation, I had not conceived; and oft did\r\n    I say to myself, that if ever I became, from health and otherwise, a\r\n    cultivator of the soil within the tropics, I would cultivate the\r\n    coffee plant, even though I did so irrespective altogether of the\r\n    profit that might be derived from so doing. Much has been written,\r\n    and not without justice, of the rich fragrance of an orange grove;\r\n    and at home we ofttimes hear of the sweet odors of a bean-field. I\r\n    have, too, often enjoyed in the Carse of Stirling, and elsewhere in\r\n    Scotland, the balmy breezes as they swept over the latter,\r\n    particularly when the sun had burst out, with unusual strength,\r\n    after a shower of rain. I have likewise, in Martinique, Santa Cruz,\r\n    Jamaica, and Cuba, inhaled the gales wafted from the orangeries; but\r\n    not for a moment would I compare either with the exquisite aromatic\r\n    odors from a coffee plantation in full blow, when the\r\n    hill-side--covered over with regular rows of the tree-like shrub,\r\n    with their millions of jessamine-like flowers--showers down upon\r\n    you, as you ride up between the plants, a perfume of the most\r\n    delicately delicious description. 'Tis worth going to the West\r\n    Indies to see the sight and inhale the perfume.\"\r\n\r\nThe decline in the quantities of coffee drawn from the \"West Indies to\r\nsupply the great demand, is manifest in the following summary of\r\nimports from those islands:--\r\n\r\n                                                             lbs.\r\n  In 1828 they exported about                             30,000,000\r\n     1831 the imports from British West Indies were       20,017,623\r\n     1841          Ditto             Ditto                 9,904,230\r\n     1850, the last year in which distinct accounts        4,262,225\r\n           were kept\r\n                                                         -----------\r\n                                Decrease from 1831        15,755,398\r\n\r\n_Jamaica_.--The coffee plant was first introduced into Jamaica by Sir\r\nNicholas Lawes, in 1728, when it was cultivated on an estate called\r\nTemple Hall, in Liguanea, not far from Kingston. In 1752 there were\r\nexported 60,000 lbs.; and in 1775, 44,000 lbs. Until 1788 little\r\nattention was paid to this product. In the four years ending 30th\r\nSeptember, 1794, the average exportation of coffee was 1,603,000 lbs.;\r\nin 1804 it amounted to 22,000,000 lbs.; and during the three years\r\nending 30th September, 1807, the average annual exportation was more\r\nthan 28,500,000 lbs.; which, at £6 per cwt., its cost in Jamaica,\r\nproduced more than £1,700,000. It is calculated that £20,000,000 was\r\ninvested in coffee estates. The coffee plant thrives in almost every\r\nsoil about the mountains of Jamaica, and in the very driest spots has\r\nfrequently produced abundant crops. In 1844 there were 671 coffee\r\nplantations in the island. Coffee is grown in the vicinity of the Blue\r\nMountain Peak at a height of 4,700 feet above the level of the sea,\r\nand some of the finest and most productive plantations are in this\r\nlocality. The branches of a coffee tree, on Radnor estate, covered, in\r\n1851, a space of thirteen feet in diameter, and the tree was about\r\nthirteen years old.\r\n\r\nIn 1789 Hayti exported 77,000,000 lbs. of coffee, but in 1826 it had\r\ndeclined to 32,000,000 lbs., in 1837 it was 31,000,000 lbs., and the\r\nshipments of this staple are now very inconsiderable.\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies, I speak principally of Jamaica, where my\r\nexperience extended, the soil best adapted for the cultivation of\r\ncoffee is found to be loose gravelly or stony. A rich black mould will\r\nproduce a luxuriant bush, which will yield little fruit. Decomposing\r\nsandstone, and slate, known in Jamaica as rotten rock, mixed with\r\nvegetable mould, is one of the most favorable soils. The subsoil\r\nshould be also carefully examined by a boring augur, for a stiff moist\r\nclay, or marly bottom retentive of moisture, is particularly injurious\r\nto the plant. A dark, rusty-colored sand, or a ferruginous marl on a\r\nsubstratum of limestone, kills the tree in a few years. In virgin\r\nlands, after the wood has been felled and cleared, the land is lined\r\noff into rows of from six to seven feet square, and at each square a\r\nhole is made about eighteen inches deep, into which the young plant is\r\nplaced and the earth plied gently about it, leaving from six to eight\r\ninches of the plant above ground.\r\n\r\nNurseries for raising plants from seeds were formerly made, but for\r\nmany years this has been neglected, and plantations are set out now\r\nfrom suckers which are drawn and trimmed of their roots, and cut about\r\ntwo feet long.\r\n\r\nThe young plants require to be kept well clear from weeds, and four\r\ncleanings in the year may be deemed necessary, the plants which have\r\nfailed must be supplied in order to ensure uniformity of appearance.\r\n\r\nAll manure, whether fluid or solid, in warm climates should be applied\r\nin wet seasons, where it is not practicable to dig or turn it in to\r\nprevent the escape of its volatile and nutritive principles.\r\n\r\nAs respects situation, coffee thrives best on elevated situations,\r\nwhere the morning sun has most influence; and on lower mountains,\r\nwhere the temperature is higher, in situations facing the south-east,\r\nor where the sun does not act with such intensity. Low mountains, in\r\nwhich the thermometer ranges from 75 to 90 degrees Fahr., as well as\r\nthose exposed to sea breezes, are less suitable for the cultivation of\r\ncoffee than those districts where the temperature averages 65 to 80\r\ndegrees Fahr., and situated at higher elevations in the interior.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, it may be asserted that the elevation best adapted\r\nfor coffee is at an altitude ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 feet, at a\r\ntemperature from 70 to 75 degrees Fahr. A west or south-west aspect is\r\nthe best, and the field should be well sheltered from the north\r\nbreezes. As a general rule in planting in light soils and high\r\ntemperatures, trees may be placed at the distance of four or five\r\nfeet, while in stronger soils and lower temperatures the average\r\ndistance would be from five to seven feet.\r\n\r\n_Topping_.--The young tree shoots out its lateral branches at each\r\njoint, which follow in regular succession, till the tree attains the\r\nheight of about four feet six inches, when it is usual to top it down\r\nto four feet. But care should be taken that the wood has ripened,\r\nwhich is known by its assuming a brown and hard appearance, This\r\nstrengthens the vegetation of the branches, which begin to throw out\r\nbuds, and these shortly form collateral branches; in the course of\r\neighteen months after the tree will have arrived at its bearing point.\r\nTrees, after being topped, throw off suckers, which are called\r\ngormandizers, from each joint, but more especially at the head. They\r\nshould be plucked off with care, but not cut, as the sap would flow\r\nmore readily if cut.\r\n\r\nIn pruning, one of the main objects is the admission of a free\r\ncirculation of air and light through the branches to the root of the\r\ntree. No general rules can be laid down for pruning; much must depend\r\non judgment, experience, and a nice eye to appearance and preservation\r\nof primary branches for bearing and ripening wood for the ensuing\r\nyear, as well as to regulate and proportion the size of the tree to\r\nthe functions of the roots in supplying sustenance, and the\r\nconvenience of picking the berries when ripe. Every old bough which\r\nhas seen its day, every wilful shoot growing in a wrong direction,\r\nevery fork, every cross branch or dead limb, must be cut away.\r\n\r\n_The blossoming, and ripening_ of the fruit varies according to the\r\nsituation and temperature of the plantation. In low and hot\r\nsituations, where the thermometer ranges from 78 to 90 degrees, the\r\ntree shows its first blossoms when about two-and-a-half years old. In\r\nhigher and colder situations the tree will not blossom in profusion\r\nuntil the fourth or fifth year. If there be light showers, the\r\nblossoms will continue on the tree for a week or more, and by the\r\nsetting of the blossoms the planter can determine what germs will\r\nbecome fruit. The trees will blossom in low situations as early as\r\nMarch, but the April bloom is considered the most abundant. In higher\r\nelevations, the trees will bloom even so late as August or September.\r\nIn warm climates the fruit advances as rapidly, and in a month will\r\nhave attained the size of a pea; in more elevated and colder\r\nlocalities, it will take two months to arrive at this stage. The fruit\r\nwill be ripe in from six to eight months after the blossom has set; it\r\nripens in warm districts about the month of August, while in others\r\nthe crop will not be mature till February. An acre will usually\r\ncontain 1,200 trees in Jamaica, and the produce would be about 400\r\nlbs. of coffee an acre, or six ounces as the produce of each tree\r\nannually. In some instances, but very seldom, one pound a tree may be\r\nobtained. A bushel of cherry coffee will produce about ten or twelve\r\npounds of merchantable coffee.\r\n\r\nThe coffee berry, after being pulped and soaked for a day and night to\r\nfree it from the mucilage, is spread out on barbacues to dry; in ten\r\nor twelve days, if the weather has been good, it will be sufficiently\r\ncured for the peeling mill.\r\n\r\nMr. W.H. Marah, of Jamaica, in a Prize Essay on the Cultivation and\r\nManufacture of Coffee in that Island, published in my \"Colonial\r\nMagazine,\" makes some useful remarks:--\r\n\r\n    The manufacture of this staple commodity, with a view to its\r\n    improvement in quality, is a subject which demands our serious\r\n    attention; and when we observe the vast importance and pecuniary\r\n    advantage which accrue upon the slightest shade of improvement\r\n    either in colour or appearance, it becomes the more imperative on us\r\n    to use all those means which are available, in order to place\r\n    ourselves on a footing with the foreign grower. It is true that we\r\n    are unable to enter the contest with the East Indian or slave\r\n    cultivator, from the abundance and cheapness of labour which is\r\n    placed at their command; but by means of our skill and assiduity, we\r\n    can successfully compete with them by the manufacture of superior\r\n    produce.\r\n\r\n    To this portion of plantation management I have given an attentive\r\n    inquiry, and shall shortly proceed to state my views on the system\r\n    best adapted to the curing and preparing for market of good quality\r\n    produce.\r\n\r\n    The fruit should be gathered in when in a blood-ripe state, to all\r\n    appearance like cherries. The labourers are principally accustomed\r\n    to reap the crop in baskets, of which they carry two to the field;\r\n    and when the coffee is bearing heavily, and is at its full stage of\r\n    ripeness, the good pickers will gather in four bushels _per diem_,\r\n    and carry the same on their heads to the works.\r\n\r\n    The fruit is then measured and thrown into a loft above the pulper\r\n    in a heap. It should be submitted to the first process of machinery,\r\n    the pulper, within twenty-four hours after, if not immediately; but\r\n    it not unfrequently happens that the manager is unable to pulp his\r\n    coffee for two and sometimes three days, by which time fermentation\r\n    ensues, and it becomes impossible after pulping to wash off the\r\n    mucilage, which rather adheres to the outer envelope of the berry,\r\n    and gives the produce what is termed a \"red\" or \"blanketty\"\r\n    appearance when spread out on the barbacues. The produce is let down\r\n    by means of a small hole cut into the floor of the loft, or a\r\n    floating box, into the hopper of the pulper, and by means of a\r\n    grater forcing the fruit against the chops, the berries are\r\n    dislodged from the pulp and fall upon a sieve, which being shaken by\r\n    the machinery, lets the berries fall into the cistern, whilst the\r\n    grater catches the pulp and carries it backwards at each evolution\r\n    of the roller, around which it is encircled.\r\n\r\n    The fruit which might have passed through without being more than\r\n    half squeezed, and having only ejected one berry, is then returned\r\n    (after being shaken off by the sieve) into the hopper, to undergo\r\n    the process a second time. The pulped coffee is then permitted to\r\n    remain in the cistern for a day and a night, during which period it\r\n    undergoes a process of fermentation; it is then washed out in two or\r\n    three waters, and the whole of the mucilaginous stuff which had\r\n    risen from the berry by the fermentation is entirely washed off, and\r\n    the coffee presents a beautiful white appearance. From this the\r\n    produce is turned out to drain on a barbacue, sloped so as to throw\r\n    all the water to the centre, where a drain is placed to carry it all\r\n    off.\r\n\r\n    In an hour or so after, the coffee may be removed to the barbacues\r\n    for curing; it is there spread out thinly and exposed to the sun,\r\n    which, if shining strong, will in eight or nine hours absorb all the\r\n    water, and the coffee be fit for housing that day. I say fit for\r\n    housing, because I have repeatedly seen coffee washed out early in\r\n    the morning and put up the same evening. I cannot say I approve of\r\n    the system, though in fine weather it has been attended with\r\n    success. From the time the coffee is first exposed to the sun till\r\n    the silver skin starts, is the stage, in my opinion, during which\r\n    the produce suffers most injury. In the first instance, it should be\r\n    kept constantly turned, in order to get the water absorbed as early\r\n    as possible; and after it has been housed, the greatest precaution\r\n    should be taken to prevent its heating: and it is for this reason\r\n    that I disapprove of early housing, for if wet weather should\r\n    intervene, and the coffee cannot be turned out, it is sure to get\r\n    heated. From this neglect I have seen a perfect steam issuing from\r\n    the house in the morning when the doors have been opened; and I have\r\n    known, as a natural consequence, the adhesion of the silver skin to\r\n    the berry so firm, that it could not be removed by a sharp penknife\r\n    without slicing the berry.\r\n\r\n    In a succession of wet weather the produce has remained on the\r\n    barbacues for several weeks, without the slightest advance in\r\n    curing; and, unless it be frequently turned while in this wet\r\n    state, it is sure to germinate; the berries first swell, then a thin\r\n    white spire issues from the seam, and on opening the berry the young\r\n    leaves will be actually seen formed inside, so rapid is the course\r\n    of vegetation.\r\n\r\n    I am of opinion that coffee should not be housed till the silver\r\n    skin begins to start, when no danger can ensue; for if a few wet\r\n    days should intervene, by turning the coffee over in the house, and\r\n    allowing a current of air to pass through it, it will keep for\r\n    weeks. It is at this stage that the parchment skin begins to show\r\n    itself, for at first it adheres to the inner kernel, but the heat of\r\n    the sun starts it from its hold and it separates; thus, on shaking a\r\n    handful of the produce it will be heard to rattle, a sure indication\r\n    that the silver skin has risen from the bean, without even threshing\r\n    it to ascertain the fact. The bean is perfectly white till the\r\n    silver skin starts; it then begins gradually to assume the dark, or\r\n    what is called the half-cured appearance. A good day's strong sun\r\n    will then half cure it, and by subsequent exposure the produce takes\r\n    another stage, and gradually loses the half-cured, and assumes a\r\n    blue colour; and when the produce is properly cured and fit for the\r\n    mill, not the slightest dark spot will be perceptible in the bean,\r\n    but it will exhibit a horny blue colour.\r\n\r\n    It is within my observation that coffee has been gathered from the\r\n    field on the Monday, and prepared for market on the Saturday, in a\r\n    spell of dry weather; but I have known it also to lie on the\r\n    barbacues for as many weeks in contrary weather, before it had gone\r\n    through the same ordeal. With good weather and smooth terraces\r\n    whereon to cure, nothing but gross ignorance and unpardonable\r\n    carelessness can produce a bad quality of coffee. The difficulty\r\n    arises in wet weather, when one's skill and assiduity is called into\r\n    action to save the produce from being spoiled. After coffee has been\r\n    half-cured, the putting it up hot at an early period of the day has\r\n    the effect of curing it all night. I have noticed produce housed in\r\n    this manner, and requiring another day's exposure to fit it for the\r\n    mill, found perfectly cured next morning.\r\n\r\n    The barbacues should be kept in good order--all ruts and holes\r\n    neatly patched every crop, for to them and other roughnesses is to\r\n    be attributed the peeling of the berries, their being scratched, and\r\n    various injuries which the produce sustains. And while on the\r\n    subject of \"Works,\" I cannot help noticing the extreme carelessness\r\n    and inattention which, on visiting properties, the works and\r\n    buildings present to our view. It is utterly impossible to\r\n    manufacture good produce unless the machinery and buildings are kept\r\n    in good order; and the parsimony which is thus displayed in this\r\n    necessary outlay is fallacious, when one thinks of the result of one\r\n    or two shillings per 100 lbs. lost on a crop through this neglect.\r\n\r\n    When the coffee is perfectly cured--which is generally ascertained\r\n    by threshing out a few berries in one's hands, and seeing if it has\r\n    attained its horny blue colour--it is then fit for milling, which is\r\n    the second process of machinery which it has to undergo. Here the\r\n    parchment and silver skins are dislodged from the berry, by means of\r\n    the friction of a large roller passing over the produce in a wooden\r\n    trough. It is then taken out of the trough, and submitted to the\r\n    fanner or winnowing machine, when the trash is all blown away, and\r\n    the coffee, passing through two or three sieves, comes away\r\n    perfectly clean and partially sized. From this it is again sieved in\r\n    order to size it properly, hand-picked, put into bags, and sent on\r\n    mules' backs to the wharf. It is then put into tierces and sold in\r\n    the Kingston market, or shipped to Britain.\r\n\r\n    A variety of circumstances tend to injure the quality of the coffee,\r\n    which it is beyond human agency to control. Dry weather intervening\r\n    at the particular period when the berry is getting full, subjects it\r\n    to be stinted and shrivelled; and strong dry breezes happening at\r\n    the same period, will cause an adhesion of the silver skin which the\r\n    ordinary process of curing and manufacture will not remove. Late\r\n    discoveries in the latter have, however, shown the possibility of\r\n    divesting the produce of that silvery appearance, when brought about\r\n    under the foregoing circumstances. It is almost, unnecessary to\r\n    state that this improvement in manufacture refers to the inventions\r\n    of Messrs. Myers and Meacock, whose respective merits have already\r\n    undergone public revision. In reference to Mr. Myers' plan of\r\n    immersing coffee in warm water, I may be allowed to state that it\r\n    has come under my own observation, that produce which had previously\r\n    been heated through some carelessness in the curing, subsequently\r\n    was exposed to a slight sprinkling of rain, and when ground out and\r\n    fanned, was found to have lost its silvery appearance.\r\n\r\n    To the invention of Mr. Meacock, a preference has, however, been\r\n    given, in consequence of the impression that the produce thus\r\n    immersed in water will absorb a portion of the liquid, which will\r\n    deteriorate its quality in its passage across the Atlantic. Several\r\n    gentlemen have shipped coffee submitted to this process to England,\r\n    but I have not learnt the result.\r\n\r\n    It appears very manifest that a great deal might be done in the way\r\n    of machinery, to relieve produce of that silvery or foxy appearance\r\n    which is so prejudicial to its value in the British market, and\r\n    which appearances might accrue from a variety of incidents to which\r\n    all plantations are more or less subject.\r\n\r\n    A manifest preference is given in the leading European markets to\r\n    coffee which has gone through the pulping and washing process; but,\r\n    strange to say, the consumers of this beverage are totally ignorant\r\n    of the fact, that the produce which is cured in the pulp furnishes a\r\n    stronger decoction than an equal quantity of the same which has\r\n    undergone the other process. Many persons are of opinion that the\r\n    mucilaginous substance which is washed off in pulping is absorbed by\r\n    the bean when cured in the pulp, and which gives strength to the\r\n    produce and enhances its aromatic flavour. On most properties it has\r\n    been customary to cure the remnants of the crop in this way, for the\r\n    use of the plantation; and it has been well noticed by great\r\n    epicures in the flavour of the decoction, that the coffee thus cured\r\n    produced the strongest and best beverage.\"\r\n\r\n_Trinidad_.--The coffee plant does not succeed well in Trinidad, the\r\ntree giving but little fruit, and perishing at the end of ten or\r\ntwelve years; though the article is always of a superior quality, and\r\nhas the advantage over that of Martinique and the other Antilles of\r\nnot requiring age to produce an agreeable beverage. It is from the\r\nfault and obstinate attachment to old habits of the planters, that\r\nthis cultivation has not been more successful in Trinidad. Because\r\ncoffee trees thrive in St. Domingo, Guadalupe, Dominica, St. Lucia and\r\nMartinique, on the hills, they had concluded that it would be the same\r\nin Trinidad; without noticing that the hills of that island are\r\ncomposed only of schistus covered with gravel, on which lies a light\r\nlayer of vegetative earth, that the rain washes away after some years\r\nof cultivation; whilst the hills of the Antilles, much more high and\r\ncool, are covered with a deep bed of earth, which is retained by\r\nenormous blocks of stone, that at the same time maintain humidity and\r\nfreshness.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Branbrun, of Tacarigua, and Don Juan de Arestimuno, of\r\nCariaco, worthy and intelligent planters, some years ago adopted the\r\nplan of planting coffee trees on the plains, in the manner cacao trees\r\nare planted, that is, in the shade of the _Erythrina_, and this mode\r\nof cultivation has perfectly succeeded. It is to be hoped that their\r\nsuccess will encourage the cultivation of this valuable tree in the\r\nunited provinces of Venezuela, and in those parts of Trinidad which\r\nwere deemed unfavorable to it from the too great dryness of the\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nIn 1796, the year preceding its capture, there were 130 coffee\r\nplantations in Trinidad, which produced 330,000 lbs. of coffee. In\r\n1802, the produce had slightly increased to 358,660 lbs., but there\r\nwere two plantations less.\r\n\r\nIn the island of Grenada, according to the returns made to the local\r\nTreasury of the staple products raised, while there were 64,654 lbs.\r\nmade-in 1829, the quantity had decreased to 13,651 lbs. in 1837.\r\n\r\nThe colony of British Guiana was formerly noted for its produce of\r\ncoffee. The following figures mark the decline of the culture of this\r\nstaple, showing the exports in Dutch pounds:--\r\n\r\n         Demerara and Essequibo.

Its\r\n    extreme scarcity during the war enhanced its price so enormously,\r\n    that on the first announcement of peace in 1814, the plants were\r\n    multiplied to infinity, and coffee plantations were formed in every\r\n    possible situation--on the Coste Firme of South America, along the\r\n    Brazilian shores of that continent, and even at some points on the\r\n    coast of Southern Africa. To show the extreme rapidity with which\r\n    the cultivation has been extended, take the statistical returns of\r\n    La Guayra, the chief port of the State of Venezuela, from whence the\r\n    whole export of coffee in the year 1789 was not more than ten tons;\r\n    and of late years from that port alone, and in spite of the internal\r\n    disunions of the country, it has reached the enormous quantity of\r\n    2,500 tons. In the Isle of Bourbon (now Reunion), and the Mauritius\r\n    and Ceylon, the planters have also applied themselves to this branch\r\n    of industry; it has been prosecuted successfully in our Eastern\r\n    Possessions, and the French government, not content with the\r\n    natural influence of the universal demand for it, have been\r\n    endeavouring to stimulate the production by means of premiums and\r\n    other artificial advantages.\r\n\r\n    In forming a coffee plantation, the choice of situation and soil\r\n    becomes a consideration of the first importance. A very high\r\n    temperature is by no means a favourable condition. If a spot could\r\n    be found where the range of the Fahrenheit thermometer did not sink\r\n    below 75 degrees, nor rise above 80 degrees, and where the soil was\r\n    otherwise suitable, no planter could desire a more favourable\r\n    situation. In the mountainous islands of Jamaica and St. Domingo,\r\n    the nearest approach to this temperature is found where the\r\n    elevation is not less than 2,000, and not more than 3,000 feet above\r\n    the level of the sea; and it is most successfully cultivated in the\r\n    two islands I have named. The Island of Cuba being much less\r\n    mountainous, but at the same time being nearer the tropical limit,\r\n    the planter in seeking the degree of heat he requires is forced to\r\n    confine himself in a great measure to the northern side of the\r\n    island, where, accordingly, we find that the cultivation of coffee\r\n    is most successfully carried on.\r\n\r\n    The vicinity of the _cafetal_ to a convenient place of embarcation,\r\n    enters largely, of course, into the consideration of the planter\r\n    when choosing a suitable locality. A compact form is also thought\r\n    desirable, in order to save the time and labour of the negroes; and\r\n    the ordinary extent is about six caballerias, or something less than\r\n    200 English acres.\r\n\r\n    The locality being finally chosen, such open places are formed or\r\n    selected, from distance to distance, as may be found most suitable,\r\n    in respect to shade and moisture, for the establishment of\r\n    convenient nurseries. The fruit which has been gathered in the\r\n    beginning of the month of October, and which has been dried in the\r\n    shade, is preferred for seed. The seed is sown in drills half a yard\r\n    asunder, and introduced, two beans together, by means of a dibble,\r\n    into holes two inches deep and ten or twelve inches apart. The\r\n    extent of one of these nurseries is generally about 100 yards\r\n    square, which, with such intervals as I have mentioned, ought to\r\n    contain about 60,000 plants.\r\n\r\n    A quarter of a _caballeria_, or about eight English acres, is\r\n    visually set apart, in a central and convenient position, for the\r\n    site of the buildings, and for growing provisions for the use of the\r\n    labourers on the future plantation. In favourable seasons it is\r\n    found that heavier crops are obtained from coffee trees left wholly\r\n    unshaded; but, in the average of two years, it seems to be settled,\r\n    in the island of Cuba at least, that a moderate degree of protection\r\n    from the scorching rays of the sun produces a steadier, and, upon\r\n    the whole, a more advantageous return.\r\n\r\n    The distribution of the land into right-angled sections, and the\r\n    planting of the trees in straight lines, is so contrived as to\r\n    favour the future supervision of the labourers much more than from\r\n    any strict attention to mere symmetry. The distance of the trees\r\n    from each other ought to be regulated by the quality of the soil,\r\n    and the degrees of heat and shade they are to enjoy. The ranges from\r\n    north to south are usually four yards apart, and those from east to\r\n    west not more than three; but the lower the temperature the wider\r\n    should be the interval, because in that case the vegetation is more\r\n    active and more rapid, and the tree requires a wider space over\r\n    which to extend itself.\r\n\r\n    The best season for planting the trees is the middle of the month of\r\n    May, if there be then a sufficient degree of moisture; but the\r\n    operation is often performed successfully during the rainy month of\r\n    October; subject always to the risk, however, of serious injury to\r\n    the young plantation from the north winds which prevail at that\r\n    advanced season of the year. The holes prepared to receive the\r\n    plants are eighteen inches in diameter, and about two feet deep.\r\n\r\n    In the island of Cuba there are two rival modes of planting the\r\n    coffee tree. The one is called \"la siembra à la mota;\" the other \"la\r\n    siembra à la estaca.\"\r\n\r\n    By the method \"a la mota,\" a circle is formed around the plant in\r\n    the nursery, and care is taken to remove it without disturbing the\r\n    earth around the roots. The plants are then placed carefully in\r\n    willow baskets, prepared for the purpose, and carried to the holes\r\n    already opened for their reception; gathering up the earth around\r\n    the stem, and pressing it carefully down with the foot, in such a\r\n    manner as to form a basin or filter for the reception of the\r\n    rain-water, and for suffering it to percolate among the roots, and\r\n    also to provide a convenient place of deposit for the subsequent\r\n    application of manure.\r\n\r\n    The \"siembra à la estaca\" is differently executed. Such plants are\r\n    selected from the nursery as are of the thickness of the little\r\n    finger, or from that to an inch in diameter. In withdrawing them\r\n    from the ground, great care is taken not to injure or compress the\r\n    bulbs or buttons within, eight or ten inches of the level of the\r\n    soil, because these are to serve for the production of fresh roots\r\n    when the \"estaca\" is afterwards planted more deeply in its permanent\r\n    position. The greater part of the capillary roots are cut away with\r\n    a knife; but a few, together with the principal root, are suffered\r\n    to remain from four to six inches long. In planting them, from three\r\n    to four inches of the trunk are left above ground. The little basin\r\n    of earth for the reception and filtration of the rain-water, is not\r\n    so large in the stake system of planting as in that with the clod of\r\n    earth \"à la mota;\" but if the soil be poor, it must be\r\n    proportionably enlarged to admit the application of the necessary\r\n    quantity of manure.\r\n\r\n    The stake system, requiring much less labour than the other, is\r\n    generally preferred; but when there is abundance of shade to protect\r\n    the young plant from drought, and always, of course, in replacing\r\n    the decayed trees of an old plantation, it is considered more\r\n    desirable to remove the whole plant, its roots and branches entire,\r\n    with as much as possible of the adhering soil from the nursery,\r\n    according to the system \"à la mota.\"\r\n\r\n    In the third or fourth year of the plantation, the trees, according\r\n    to the best system of husbandry, are pruned down to the height of\r\n    three feet from the ground on the richest soil, and still lower in\r\n    proportion to its sterility. All the branches which are not as\r\n    nearly as possible at right angles with the trunk, are likewise\r\n    removed by the pruning-knife, so that in the following spring the\r\n    whole stem is covered with fresh shoots. By this operation the power\r\n    of nature seems to be exhausted, as for that year the trees in\r\n    general bear no fruit; but in subsequent seasons the loss is amply\r\n    repaid by a crop often greater than the branches can support, or\r\n    than the flow of nourishment is always able to bring to full size\r\n    and maturity.\r\n\r\n    The machinery for removing the external pulp of the coffee-bean is\r\n    seldom of a very perfect description in this island, and the loss\r\n    sustained in consequence is often very considerable. It is almost\r\n    uniformly moved by the power of horses or oxen, working in a gin,\r\n    and the name it bears is that of the _Descerecador_. The Barbecues,\r\n    when the coffee is laid out to dry, are called indiscriminately\r\n    _Tendales_ or _Secadores_. They are more numerous and of smaller\r\n    dimensions than is customary in the British colonies, where a single\r\n    barbecue, laid down with tiles or plaster, is considered sufficient\r\n    for a whole estate.\r\n\r\n    The warehouse for receiving the crop and preserving the coffee after\r\n    it is put into bags and ready for the market, is generally of such\r\n    limited dimensions as to be barely sufficient for the purposes for\r\n    which it is designed; so that, when the harvest has been abundant,\r\n    or when anything has occurred to interfere with the despatch of what\r\n    is ready for removal, the constant accumulation is attended with\r\n    serious inconvenience. In fact, the occupation of the coffee planter\r\n    has been for some time on the decline in the island, owing to the\r\n    superior rate of profit derived from the making of sugar; and\r\n    everything reminds you of it, the _moleno de pilar_, the\r\n    _aventador_, and the _separador_, down to the humblest implement of\r\n    husbandry on the estate.\r\n\r\n    The gathering of the fruit commences in Cuba in August; but November\r\n    and December are the most active and important months of the\r\n    harvests. The labourers are sent out with two baskets each, one\r\n    large, the other small. Every labourer has a file of coffee trees\r\n    assigned to him; the large basket he leaves near the place where his\r\n    work is to begin; the other he carries with him to receive the\r\n    berries from the trees; and as often as it is full he empties it\r\n    into the large one. The baskets are made of rushes, willows, or\r\n    bamboo; and the large one is of such a size that three of them ought\r\n    to fill the barrel, without top or bottom, which serves the purposes\r\n    of a measure at the _Tendal_ or Secador.\r\n\r\n    Three baskets, or one barrel-measure, of the newly-gathered coffee\r\n    berry, ought to produce thirty pounds after the process of drying,\r\n    the removal of the pulp, and the final preparation for the market.\r\n    When there is a sufficient number, or a sufficient space of\r\n    Barbecues or Secadors, sixty or seventy barrels only are put\r\n    together; but from want of room it often happens that the quantity\r\n    amounts to a hundred barrels. In either case, the whole is gathered\r\n    into two great heaps, and in this state it is allowed to remain for\r\n    four-and-twenty hours, in order to subject it to a certain degree of\r\n    fermentation. After this, it is spread out to dry over the whole\r\n    surface of the Barbecue, and until it is sufficiently so, it remains\r\n    there uncovered day and night. When the dessication is found to be\r\n    far enough advanced, it is no longer exposed during the night; nor\r\n    even during the day, if the weather be damp or unfavorable. The\r\n    subsequent operations are certainly not better, probably not so\r\n    well, conducted as in our own West India possessions.\r\n\r\n    In the fourth year, it is presumed that the agricultural produce of\r\n    the land, and the first returns of coffee, should be sufficient to\r\n    meet all the current expenses. At the end of the fifth year there\r\n    ought to be forty thousand coffee trees four years old on the\r\n    estate, 60,000 of three years, and 100,000 of two and one year, the\r\n    produce of which ought to be at least 400 quintals, which, at a\r\n    moderate estimate, should be worth 2,400 dollars. Thus the\r\n    calculation goes on until we arrive at the end of the seventh year,\r\n    when the estate ought to be in full bearing. The returns are\r\n    estimated at 3,000 arrobas, or 750 quintals, which, at eight dollars\r\n    per quintal delivered free on board, make 6,000 dollars. The minor\r\n    products of the estate, such as Indian corn, pigs, and oil, are\r\n    given at 1,130 dollars, making the gross returns 7,130 dollars; and,\r\n    after deducting the annual expenses, leaving 5,300 dollars as the\r\n    regular return on the capital invested, which, having been about\r\n    40,000 dollars, gives about thirteen per cent.; not certainly to be\r\n    considered extravagant in a country where twelve per cent, is the\r\n    regular rate of interest. The produce of coffee from each section is\r\n    given at 400 arrobas, or 3,500 arrobas for the whole of the nine\r\n    sections. The average price of coffee, free of the expense of\r\n    carriage, is assumed to be two dollars the arroba, or eight dollars\r\n    per quintal, which would give a return of 7,200 dollars, besides the\r\n    repayment of the rent by the colonists.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of coffee has been falling off in Cuba for several\r\nyears past, the crops it is asserted being too precarious there, and\r\nthe prices too low to encourage the continuance of planting. On the\r\nnorthern side of the island is where this decrease is most\r\nperceptible, several of the largest estates having been converted to\r\nthe growth of sugar and tobacco, others abandoned to serve as pasture\r\nfields, and the very few remaining yielding less and less every year.\r\nHenceforward the culture of this berry here is likely to be very\r\ninsignificant, and not many years will elapse before the amount\r\nproduced will merely suffice for the local consumption. About St. Jago\r\nde Cuba the cultivation is more attended to, the article forming still\r\ntheir principal export. Taking five quinquennial periods, the\r\nfollowing figures show the average annual exports of coffee:--\r\n\r\n                               arrobas.\r\n  1826 to 1830                1,718,865\r\n  1830 \"  1835                1,995,832\r\n  1835 \"  1840                1,877,646\r\n  1841 \"  1846                1,887,444\r\n  1846 \"  1851                  768,244\r\n\r\nThe better to exhibit the decrease of production throughout the\r\nisland, I may state that the export from 1839 to 1841 inclusive, was\r\nin the aggregate 1,332,221 quintals; 1842 to 1844, inclusive, was in\r\nthe aggregate 1,217,666 quintals; 1845 to 1847, inclusive, was in the\r\naggregate but 583,208 quintals. The exports of coffee for the whole\r\nisland, were, in 1840, 2,197,771 arrobas; in 1841, 1,260,920½ arrobas.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 there were 2,064 plantations under cultivation with coffee in\r\nCuba, in 1846 there were only 1,670. The production of 1849 was\r\n1,470,754 arrobas, valued at 2,206,131 dollars. From the year 1841 to\r\n1846, the average yearly production was 45,236,100 lbs.; but from 1846\r\nto 1851, it was only 19,206,100 lbs.; showing a falling off of 72 per\r\ncent.; the production still further decreased in 1851, it being only\r\n13,004,350 lbs., or 1.52 per cent. less than the preceding year. This\r\nenormous decline in the production of coffee has been caused by the\r\nlow price of the article in the markets of Europe and the United\r\nStates, coupled with the more remunerative price of sugar, during the\r\nsame period; causing capitalists rather to invest money in the\r\nformation of new sugar estates. As a consequence, many coffee\r\nplantations have been turned into cane cultivation; or, being\r\nabandoned, the slaves attached thereto were sold or leased to sugar\r\nplanters.\r\n\r\nThe following is private information from a correspondent:--\r\n\r\n    \"We generally plant about 200,000 trees within a space of 500 feet,\r\n    choosing the strongest soil. I have adopted a different system from\r\n    the one generally in use here, for they usually plant the trees too\r\n    near each other. I find by giving them space and air, that the plant\r\n    develops itself and yields more beans. It is very important to\r\n    protect the trees from the rays of the sun, for which purpose I\r\n    plant bananas at intermediate rows; their broad leaves, like\r\n    parasols, shed a delightful shade round the coffee plant, and tend\r\n    to accumulate the moisture which strengthens the roots of the young\r\n    tree.\r\n\r\n    When the tree is about two years old the top branches are lopped off\r\n    for the purpose of throwing the sap into the bean. Some planters cut\r\n    the trees so short, that they do not allow them to stand more than\r\n    five or six feet above the ground; but I allow mine to attain\r\n    greater height prior to lopping them, whereby they produce larger\r\n    crops. Nor do I allow my negroes to beat the trees, or force them to\r\n    pluck a certain quantity a day, for I discovered that they picked\r\n    the ripe and unripe beans indiscriminately--frequently injuring the\r\n    trees. I only allow them to shake the tree, and pick up the beans\r\n    that have fallen during the night.\"\r\n\r\nCoffee exports from the ports of Havana and Matanzas, in Cuba, for the\r\nyears ending December in\r\n\r\n                  Quintals.\r\n  1839             344,725\r\n  1840             402,135\r\n  1841             212,767\r\n  1842             314,191\r\n  1843             223,265\r\n  1844             186,349\r\n  1845              42,409\r\n  1846              65,045\r\n  1847             106,904\r\n  1848              31,674\r\n  1849              92,974\r\n  1852              42,510\r\n\r\nPorto Rico exported 85,384 cwt. of coffee in 1839.\r\n\r\n_Africa_.--Coffee will require some four years to grow before it will\r\ngive to the cultivator any income, but it should be known that after\r\nthat time the tree, with little or no labor bestowed on it, will yield\r\ntwo crops a year. The quality of coffee grown in the republic of\r\nLiberia, on the western coast of Africa, is pronounced by competent\r\njudges to be equal to any in the world. In numerous instances, trees\r\nfull of coffee, are seen at only three years old. 214 casks and bags\r\nof coffee were imported from the western coast of Africa in 1846.\r\n\r\nCoffee, it has been proved, can be cultivated with great ease to any\r\nextent in the republic of Liberia, being indigenous to the soil, and\r\nfound in great abundance. It bears fruit from thirty to forty years,\r\nand yields 10 lbs. to the shrub yearly! A single tree in the garden of\r\nColonel Hicks, a colonist at Monrovia, is said to have yielded the\r\nenormous quantity of 16 lbs. at one gathering. Judge Benson, in 1850,\r\nhad brought 25 acres under cultivation, and many others had also\r\ndevoted themselves to raising coffee. It was estimated there were\r\nabout 30,000 coffee trees planted in one of the counties, that of\r\nGrand Bassa, and the quality of the produce was stated to be equal to\r\nthe best Java.\r\n\r\nAbout the villages and settlements of the Sherbro river, and Sierra\r\nLeone, wild coffee-trees are very abundant. In several parts of the\r\ninterior, the natives make use of the shrub to fence their\r\nplantations.\r\n\r\nCoffee has been successfully grown at St. Helena, of an excellent\r\nquality, and might be made an article of export.\r\n\r\nPortugal sent to the Great Exhibition, in 1851, a very valuable series\r\nof coffees from many of her colonies; of ordinary description from St.\r\nThomas; tolerably good from the Cape de Verd islands; bad from Timor;\r\nworse (but curious from the very small size of the berry) from\r\nMozambique; good from Angola; and excellent from Madeira.\r\n\r\nAden, alias Mocha coffee, is, along with the other coffees of the Red\r\nSea, sent first to Bombay by Arab ships, where it is \"garbelled,\" or\r\npicked, previously to its being exported to England.\r\n\r\nAn excellent sample of coffee, apparently of the Barbera (Abyssinia)\r\nvariety, was contributed to the Great Exhibition from Norfolk Island.\r\nIt was of good color, well adapted for roasting, and a most desirable\r\nnovelty from that quarter.\r\n\r\nDr. Gardner, of Ceylon, has taken out a patent for preparing the\r\ncoffee leaf in a manner to afford a beverage like tea, that is by\r\ninfusion, \"forming an agreeable refreshing and nutritive article of\r\ndiet.\" An infusion of the coffee-leaf has long been an article of\r\nuniversal consumption amongst the natives of parts of Sumatra;\r\nwherever the coffee is grown, the leaf has become one of the\r\nnecessaries of life, which the natives regard as indispensable.\r\n\r\nThe coffee-plant, in a congenial soil and climate, exhibits great\r\nluxuriance in its foliage, throwing out abundance of suckers and\r\nlateral stems, especially when from any cause the main stem is thrown\r\nout of the perpendicular, to which it is very liable from its great\r\nsuperincumbent weight compared with the hold of its root in the\r\nground. The native planters, availing themselves of this propensity,\r\noften give this plant a considerable inclination, not only to increase\r\nthe foliage, but to obtain new fruit-bearing stems, when the old ones\r\nbecome unproductive. It is also found desirable to limit the height of\r\nthe plant by lopping off the top to increase the produce, and\r\nfacilitate the collecting it, and fresh sprouts in abundance are the\r\ncertain consequence. These are so many causes of the development of a\r\nvegetation, which becomes injurious to the quantity of the fruit or\r\nberry unless removed; and when this superabundant foliage can be\r\nconverted into an article of consumption, as hitherto the case in\r\nSumatra, the culture must become the more profitable; and it is\r\nclearly the interest of the planters of Ceylon to respond to the call\r\nof Dr. Gardner, and by supplying the leaf on reasonable terms, to\r\nassist in creating a demand for an article they have in abundance, and\r\nwhich for the want of that demand is of no value to them. It ought to\r\nbe mentioned also, that the leaves which become ripe and yellow on the\r\ntree and fall off in the course of nature, contain the largest portion\r\nof extract, and make the richest infusion; and I have no doubt, should\r\nthe coffee leaf ever come into general use, the ripe leaf will be\r\ncollected with as much care as the ripe fruit.\r\n\r\nThe mode of the preparation by the natives is this. The ends of the\r\nbranches and suckers, with the leaves on; are taken from the tree and\r\nbroken into lengths of from twelve to eighteen inches. These are\r\narranged in the split of a stick or small bamboo, side by side,\r\nforming a truss in such a manner, that the leaves all appear on one\r\nside, and the stalk on the other, the object of which is to secure\r\nequal roasting, the stalks being thus exposed to the fire together,\r\nand the leaves together. The slit being tied up in two or three\r\nplaces, and a part of the stick or bamboo left as a handle, the truss\r\nis held over a fire without smoke, and kept moving about, so as to\r\nroast the whole equally, without burning, on the success of which\r\noperation the quality and flavor of the article must depend. When\r\nsuccessfully roasted, the raw vegetable taste is entirely dissipated,\r\nwhich is not the ease if insufficiently done. When singed or overdone,\r\nthe extract is destroyed and the aroma lost. When the fire is smoky,\r\nthe flavor varies with the nature of the smoke. The stalks are roasted\r\nequally with the leaves, and are said to add fully as much to the\r\nstrength of the infusion. By roasting the whole becomes brittle, and\r\nis reduced to a coarse powder by rubbing between the hands. In this\r\nstate it is ready for use, and the general mode of preparing the\r\nbeverage is by infusion, as in the case of common tea.\r\n\r\nThat it would soon become a most valuable article of diet amongst the\r\nlaboring classes, and on ship board particularly, if, once brought\r\ninto use, there can be no doubt. The coffee-tree can be grown to\r\nadvantage for the leaf in the lowlands of every tropical country,\r\nwhere the soil is sufficiently fertile, whilst it requires a different\r\nsoil and climate to produce the fruit[7]. Dr. Hooker, in the Jury\r\nReports, observes upon the prepared coffee leaves, submitted by Dr.\r\nGardner, of Ceylon, to be used as tea leaves, that they are worthy of\r\nnotice as affording a really palatable drink when infused as tea is;\r\nmore so, perhaps, than coffee is to the uninitiated. That this\r\npreparation contains a considerable amount of the nutritious\r\nprinciples of coffee, is evident from the analysis; but as the leaves\r\ncan only be collected in a good state at the expense of the coffee\r\nbush, it is doubtful whether the coffee produced by the berries be\r\nnot, after all, the cheapest, as it certainly is the best.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEA.\r\n\r\nThe immense traffic in the produce of this simple shrub, the growth of\r\na remarkable country, hitherto almost entirely isolated from the\r\nwestern nations, is one of the most remarkable illustrations of the\r\nenterprise and energy of modern commerce. The trade in tea now gives\r\nemployment to upwards of 60,000 tons of British shipping, and about\r\nten millions sterling of English capital, producing a revenue to this\r\ncountry of nearly six millions sterling.\r\n\r\nEvery reflecting man will admit that articles of such vast consumption\r\nas tea and coffee (amounting together to more than 343,500 tons\r\nannually), forming the chief liquid food of whole nations, must\r\nexercise a great influence upon the health of the people.\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely any country in the world in which a dietetic drink\r\nor beverage resembling tea, is not prepared, and in general use, from\r\nsome exotic or indigenous shrub. The two chief plants laid under\r\ncontribution are, however, the Chinese tea-plant, and a species of\r\nholly peculiar to South America, producing the Paraguay tea. _Astoria\r\ntheiformis_ is used at Santa Fe as tea. The leaves of _Canothus\r\nAmericanus_, an astringent herb, have been used as a substitute, under\r\nthe name of New Jersey tea.\r\n\r\nIt has been a matter of surprise why tea should be so much sought\r\nafter by the poorer classes, since by many it is looked on more as a\r\nluxury than of use to the human system. The manner in which it acts,\r\nand the cause why it is so much in demand by all classes, is\r\nsatisfactorily explained by Liebig; and the benefit, therefore, which\r\nwill be conferred by selling it at a low rate, and thus placing it\r\nwithin the means of all, has at last come to be duly appreciated.\r\nLiebig says, without entering minutely into the medical action of\r\ncaffeine, theine, &c., it will surely appear a most striking fact,\r\neven if we were to deny its influence on the process of secretion,\r\nthat the substance, with the addition of oxygen and the elements of\r\nwater, can yield taurine, the nitrogenised compound peculiar to\r\nbile:--\r\n\r\n                                 Carbon.   Nitrogen. Hydrogen.  Oxygen.\r\n  1 atom caffeine or theine  =      8        2           5         2\r\n  9 atoms water              =     --       --           9         9\r\n  9 atoms oxygen             =     --       --          --         9\r\n                                   __        __         __        __\r\n            = 2 atoms taurine       8        2          14        20\r\n                             =      2        4           9        10\r\n\r\nTo see how the action of caffeine, theobromine, theine, &c., may be\r\nexplained, we must call to mind that the chief constituent of the\r\nbile contains only 3.8 per cent. of nitrogen, of which only the half,\r\nor 1.9 per cent., belongs to the taurine; bile contains, in its\r\nnatural state, water and solid matter, in the proportion of ninety\r\nparts by weight of the former, to ten of the latter. If we suppose\r\nthese ten parts, by weight of solid matter, to be chloric acid, with\r\n3.87 per cent. of nitrogen, then 100 parts of theine would contain\r\n0.171 of nitrogen in the shape of taurine. Now this quantity is\r\ncontained in 0.6 parts of theine, or 2 grains 8/10ths of theine can\r\ngive to an ounce of bile the nitrogen it contains in the form of\r\ntaurine.\r\n\r\nAlthough an infusion of tea contains no more than the one-tenth of a\r\ngrain of theine, still, if it contribute in point of fact to the\r\nformation of bile, the action even of such a quantity cannot be looked\r\nupon as a nullity. Neither can it be denied, that in the case of an\r\nexcess of non-azotised food, and a deficiency of motion, which is\r\nrequired to cause the change of matter of the tissues, and thus to\r\nyield the nitrogenised product which enters into the composition of\r\nthe bile, that in such a condition the health may be benefited by the\r\nuse of compounds which are capable of supplying the place of the\r\nnitrogenised substances produced in the healthy state of the body, and\r\nessential to the production of an important element of inspiration. In\r\na chronical sense, and it is this alone which the preceding remarks\r\nare intended to show, caffeine, or theine, &c., are, in virtue of\r\ntheir composition, better adapted to this purpose than all\r\nnitrogenised vegetable principles. The action of these substances in\r\nordinary circumstances is not obvious, but it unquestionably exists.\r\nTea and coffee were originally met with among nations whose diet was\r\nchiefly vegetable.\r\n\r\nConsiderable discussion has taken place regarding the tea plants; some\r\nsay that there is only one species; others that there are two or\r\nthree. Mr. Fortune, who visited the tea districts of Canton, Fokien,\r\nand Chekiang, asserts that the black and green teas of the northern\r\ndistricts of China are obtained from the same species or variety,\r\nknown under the name of _Thea Bohea_. Some make the Assam tea a\r\ndifferent species, and thus recognise three: _T. Cantoniensis_ or\r\n_Bohea_, _T. Viridis_, and _T. Assamica_. The quality of the tea\r\ndepends much on the season when the leaves are picked, the mode in\r\nwhich it is prepared, as well as the district in which it grows. The\r\ngreen teas include Twankay, Young Hyson, Hyson, Gunpowder, and\r\nImperial; while the black comprise Bohea, Congou, Souchong, Oolong,\r\nand Pekoe. The teas of certain districts, such as Anhoi, have peculiar\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nThe first tea imported into England was a package of two pounds, by\r\nthe East India Company, in 1664, as a present to the king; in 1667,\r\nanother small importation took place, from the company's factory at\r\nBantam. The directors ordered their servants to \"send home by their\r\nships 100 pounds weight of the best _tey_ they could get.\" In 1678\r\nwere imported 4,713 lbs.; but in the six following years the entire\r\nimports amounted to no more than 410 lbs. According to Milburn's\r\n\"Oriental Commerce,\" the consumption in 1711 was 141,995 lbs.; 120,595\r\nlbs. in 1715, and 237,904 lbs. in 1720. In 1745 the amount was 730,729\r\nlbs. For above a century and a half, the sole object of the East India\r\nCompany's trade with China was to provide tea for the consumption of\r\nthe United Kingdom. The company had the exclusive trade, and were\r\nbound to send orders for tea, and to provide ships to import the same,\r\nand always to have a year's consumption in their warehouses. The teas\r\nwere disposed of in London, where only they could be imported, at\r\nquarterly sales. The act of 1834, however, threw open the trade to\r\nChina.\r\n\r\nFrom a Parliamentary return, showing the quantity of tea retained for\r\nhome consumption in the United Kingdom, in each year, from 1740 to the\r\ntermination of the East India Company's sales, and thence to the\r\npresent time, it appears that in 1740, 1,493,695 lbs. of tea were\r\nretained for home consumption. Two years afterwards, the quantity fell\r\nto 473,868 lbs., and in 1767 only 215,019 lbs. were retained. Next\r\nyear the amount increased to 3,155,417 lbs.; in 1769 it was 9,114,854\r\nlbs.; in 1795, 21,342,845 lbs.; in 1836, 49,842,236 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe return in question also specifies the quantity of the various\r\nkinds of tea, with the average sale prices.\r\n\r\nAccording to the annual tea reports of Messrs. W.J. Thompson and Son,\r\nand Messrs. W.E. Franks and Son, the total imports of tea during the\r\nlast fifteen years were as follows, reckoned in millions of lbs.:--\r\n\r\n  Years.     Black.       Green.     Total.

It was 2s. 2d. per lb. until May, 1852, when 4d. per lb.\r\nwas taken off, and further annual reductions are to be made. Down to\r\nthe year 1834 the duty was an _ad valorem_ one of 96 per cent. on all\r\nteas sold under 2s. a lb., and of 100 per cent. on all that were sold\r\nat or above 2s., charged on the prices which they brought at the East\r\nIndia Company's sales. The _ad valorem_ duties ceased on the 22nd of\r\nApril, 1834, and under the act 3 and 4 William IV. c. 100, all tea\r\nimported into the United Kingdom for home consumption was charged\r\nwith a customs as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Bohea                                    1s. 6d. per lb.\r\n  Congou, twankay, hyson skin, orange\r\n    pekoe, and campoi                      2   2     \"\r\n  Souchong, flowery pekoe, hyson, young\r\n    hyson, gunpowder, imperial, and\r\n    other teas not enumerated              3   0     \"\r\n\r\nIn 1836, the uniform duty of 2s. 1d. per lb. on all descriptions of\r\ntea was imposed, which, with the additional 5 per cent, imposed in\r\n1840, made the total duty levied per lb. 2s. 2d. and a fraction.\r\n\r\nDuring the years from 1831 to 1841, in spite of an increase of nearly\r\nthree millions in the population of the country, and notwithstanding\r\nthe impetus given to the tea-trade by the abolition of the East India\r\nCompany's monopoly in 1833, the increased consumption was only\r\n6,675,566 lbs. Great as the increase has been of late years, however,\r\nit is very far short of what we might expect to see were the duty\r\nreduced to a moderate per centage on the value of the article as it\r\ncomes from the Chinese merchant. In Jersey and Guernsey, where there\r\nis no duty on tea, the average consumption is 4½ lbs. per head per\r\nannum. The same rate for the United Kingdom would require an annual\r\nimportation of nearly 150 million lbs. I asserted, many months ago, if\r\nthe duty could be gradually reduced from its present exorbitant amount\r\nto 1s. per lb., the revenue would not suffer much, whilst the comfort\r\nof the people would be much increased, and our trade with China\r\ngreatly improved.\r\n\r\n  Years.

The present Chinese duty of two\r\ntaels five mace, does not include shipping and other charges; the old\r\nduty was five taels, and included all charges paid the Hong merchants.\r\nThe export by sea is now about 97 millions of lbs.\r\n\r\nThe following was the returned value of the tea exported from the five\r\nChinese ports in 1844 and 1845:--\r\n\r\n                   1844.        1845.\r\n  Canton       £2,910,474    £3,429,790\r\n  Shanghae         67,115       462,746\r\n  Ningpo            2,000         2,000\r\n  Amoy                              544\r\n  Foo-chow-foo                      638\r\n                ---------     ---------\r\n               £2,979,589    £3,895,718\r\n\r\nThe average cost of tea in China at the ship's side is 10d. per pound,\r\nwhile it is confidently asserted that it could be produced in many\r\nparts of America at 5d. the pound. The great cost in China is owing to\r\nthe expensive transportation, the cultivation of the fuel used, the\r\nabsence of all economy of machinery, &c. It is only by adulteration\r\nthat tea is sold in China as cheap as 10d. In America the beating and\r\nrolling of the leaves (one half of the labor) could be done by the\r\nsimplest machinery, fuel could be economised by flues, &c.\r\n\r\nThe Russian teas, brought by caravans, are the most expensive and best\r\nteas used in Europe. The Chinese themselves pay 7½ dollars per pound\r\nfor the \"Yen Pouchong\" teas.\r\n\r\nFull chests were exhibited in 1851, by Mr. Ripley, of various Pekoe\r\nteas, some of which fetch 50s. per lb. in the China market; whilst 7s.\r\nis the very highest price any of the sort will fetch in England, and\r\nthis only as a fancy article. The plain and orange-scented Pekoes now\r\nfetch little with us; but as caravan teas, are purchased by the\r\nwealthier Russian families. The finest, however, never leave China,\r\nbeing bought up by the Mandarins; for though the transit expenses add\r\n3s. to 4s. per lb. to the value when sold in Russia, the highest\r\nmarket price in St. Petersburg is always under 50s. Among these\r\nscented teas are various caper teas, flavoured with chloranthus\r\nflowers and the buds of some species of plants belonging to the orange\r\ntribe, _magnolia fuscata_, olea flowers, &c. The Cong Souchong, or\r\nNing-young teas, are chiefly purchased for the American market. Oolong\r\ntea is the favourite drink in Calcutta, though less prized in England,\r\nits delicate flavor being injured by the length of the voyage. For\r\ndelicacy, no teas, approach those usually called \"Mandarin teas,\"\r\nwhich being slightly fired and rather damp when in the fittest state\r\nfor use, will bear neither transport nor keeping. They are in great\r\ndemand among the wealthy Chinese, and average 20s. per lb in the\r\nnative market.--(Jury Reports.)\r\n\r\nThe consumption of tea in the United Kingdom may now be fairly taken\r\nat fifty-four million pounds yearly, and sold at an average price to\r\nthe consumer of 4s. 6d., per pound. The money expended for tea is\r\nupwards of twelve millions sterling.\r\n\r\nThe expenditure of this sum is distributed as follows, in round\r\nnumbers:--\r\n\r\n  Net cost of 54,000,000 pounds, average 1s. per pound        £2,700,000\r\n  Export duty in China of 1½d. a lb.                             337,500\r\n  Shipping charges, &c., in China                                 25,000\r\n  Freight, &c., China to England, about 2d. per lb.              450,000\r\n  Insurance, ½d. per lb.                                         112,500\r\n  Commission, about ¼d. per lb.                                   56,250\r\n  Tasting charges, &c., about 1/8 of a penny per lb.              28,125\r\n  Interest for 6 months on £3,709,375 at 5 per cent.              92,734\r\n                                                               ---------\r\n  Total outlay in China                                       £3,802,109\r\n  Profit to exporters in China,(about 12 per cent.)              445,116\r\n  Landing charges, &c., in England                                39,000\r\n                                                              ----------\r\n  Cost price in bond in England                               £4,286,225\r\n  Duty received by government at 2s. 2½. per lb., about        5,985,482\r\n                                                              ----------\r\n                                                             £10,271,707\r\n  Profit divided among tea-brokers, wholesale and retail\r\n  dealers, &c                                                  1,878,293\r\n                                                              ----------\r\n  Total outlay by British public for tea, at 4s. 6d. per lb. £12,150,000\r\n\r\nThe tea imported into England in 1667 was only 100 lbs., while for the\r\nyear ending June 30, 1851, the export from China to Great Britain was\r\n64,020,000 lbs., employing 115 vessels in its transportation; and to\r\nthe United States, during the same time, 28,760,800 lbs., in\r\nsixty-four vessels. Within the last five years, the export has\r\nincreased 10,000,000 lbs. to the United States, and 17,000,000 to\r\nGreat Britain. These statistics will show the immense importance of\r\nthis article to commerce, and the vast amount of shipping it supports.\r\nBut let us follow out the statistics a little more in detail.\r\n\r\nThe population of the Chinese provinces, as quoted by Dr. Morison,\r\nfrom an official census taken in 1825, was 352,866,012, and we may\r\nfairly conclude that during the last twenty-eight years this\r\npopulation has extensively increased. If we assume the annual\r\nconsumption of tea at four lb. per head on the above population; and\r\nthis is no unreasonable assumption in a country, where, to quote from\r\nMurray's valuable work on China, tea \"is the national drink, which is\r\npresented on every occasion, served up at every feast, and even sold\r\non the public roads;\" we shall have a tolerably accurate result as to\r\nthe total consumption in the empire. Indeed this computation falls\r\nshort of the actual relative consumption in the island of Jersey,\r\nwhere, as we have seen, nearly five lbs. is the annual allowance of\r\neach individual.\r\n\r\nIf we multiply the population of China by four, we have--\r\n\r\n                                                                lbs.\r\n  Total consumption of tea in China                        1,411,464,048\r\n  Export of Great Britain and Ireland, for the year ending\r\n    June 30, 1851.                                            64,020,000\r\n  Export to the United States, same period                    28,760,800\r\n  Export to Holland, returned at 2,000,000 in Davis's\r\n    \"China\"                                                    3,000,000\r\n\r\n  Inland trade to Russia                                      15,000,000\r\n  Export to Hamburg, Bremen, Denmark, Sweden, &c.,\r\n    seven cargoes, about                                       3,000,000\r\n  Export to Sydney, and Australasian Colonies, at least        6,000,000\r\n  Export to Spain and France, four cargoes                     2,000,000\r\n                                                               ---------\r\n                                            Total lbs.     1,533,244,848\r\n\r\nThe above is exclusive of the heavy exportation in Chinese vessels to\r\nall parts of the east where Chinese emigrants are settled, such as\r\nTonquin, Cochin China, Cambodia, Siam, the Philippines, Borneo, and\r\nthe various settlements within the Straits of Malacca. In comparison\r\nwith such an enormous quantity, the 54 million lbs. consumed in the\r\nUnited Kingdom sink into insignificance.\r\n\r\n                                                                 £\r\n  The cost of tea to America, at the ship's side in China,\r\n    say 29,000,000 lbs., at an average of 1s. per lb.,\r\n    would be                                                 1,450,000\r\n  The cost to England, 64,000,000, at the same price         3,200,000\r\n  The cost to other places, say 25,000,000                   1,250,000\r\n  Russia, 15,000,000                                           750,000\r\n                                                            ----------\r\n                                               Total        £6,650,000\r\n\r\nIt is therefore clear, that were the demand to be doubled from Great\r\nBritain, it would make very little difference in the Chinese market;\r\nsince it would be only a question of letting us have six per cent, of\r\ntheir growth of the article, instead of three.\r\n\r\nWhen we remember that the tea plant attains to maturity in three\r\nyears, and its leaves are then fit for picking; and that there is a\r\nvast extent of country to which it is indigenous, growing in every\r\nclimate between the equator and the latitude of 45 degrees, it is\r\nevident that, were there a necessity for it, the actual production of\r\ntea in China could be increased to an almost unlimited extent in the\r\nspace of three or four years, an extent far more than compensating for\r\nthe extra three per cent., which might be, in the first instance,\r\nrequired by the British.\r\n\r\nThe certainty of an increased consumption following upon a reduction\r\nin the price of tea to the actual consumers of it, is so obvious as to\r\nrequire demonstration to those only who have not considered the\r\nsubject. The population of Great Britain and Ireland is, say in round\r\nnumbers 30,000,000, the actual consumption of tea is only 54,000,000\r\nlbs., or little more than one pound and three quarters for each\r\nindividual. In the neighbouring island of Jersey, there are nearly\r\nfive lbs. of tea consumed by every inhabitant yearly; and as we may\r\nfairly infer from analogy that similar results would arise from a\r\nsimilar cause, the consumption in the United Kingdom in the same ratio\r\nwould amount to no less than 150 millions of pounds annually.\r\n\r\nTea, observes a most competent authority (Mr. J. Ingram Travers), is\r\nthe favourite drink of the people: all desire to have it strong and\r\ngood, and none who can afford it are without it. But in the\r\nagricultural districts the laborers use but little; numbers of them\r\n\"make tea with burnt crusts, because the China tea is too dear.\" In\r\nIreland the consumption is greatly below that of England; there are\r\ncomparatively few people who do not, on company occasions, make their\r\ntea stronger than for ordinary use, and the general economy in the use\r\nof tea forms an exception to almost every other article of\r\nconsumption. As to the working classes in the manufacturing districts,\r\nMr. Bayley, President of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, himself a\r\nvery extensive manufacturer, and therefore well qualified to speak to\r\nthe fact, says:--\"The common calculation of two ounces per head per\r\nweek I should think is very much in excess of what the working classes\r\nconsume. Domestic servants, I believe, have that quantity allowed\r\nthem, but I should say that the working classes do not consume one\r\nquarter of that.\" And yet it is these classes who are the great\r\nconsumers of everything cheap enough to be within their reach. It is\r\nthis consumption that, under better earnings, has sustained the steady\r\nincrease of nearly two million pounds of tea per annum for the last\r\neight years, and still there is such ample room for increase that\r\ndomestic servants are allowed at least four times as much per head as\r\nthose working people who value, more than any other class, the\r\ncheerful refreshingness of tea, but who, stinted in its use by the\r\nexorbitant duty, are tempted and almost driven to the use, instead, of\r\ndegrading drinks.\r\n\r\nAnd if the general consumption of the population should rise to even\r\nhalf servants' allowance, or one ounce per head per week, the\r\nconsumption of tea would reach 97,500,000 lbs. per annum. And as to\r\nwhat might be used if the taste for it had free scope, some idea may\r\nbe formed from the fact that the consumption of such people as have\r\nfound their way from these countries, where the consumption is 1 lb. 9\r\nozs. per head, to Australia, has there risen to 7 lbs. per head, at\r\nwhich rate the consumption of the United Kingdom would be about\r\n210,000,000 lbs. per annum, and which, even at a 6d. duty, would\r\nproduce five millions and a half. There is nothing in the air of\r\nAustralia to give any especial impulse to tea drinking: on the\r\ncontrary; in this comparatively cold, damp climate, people would\r\nnaturally use a hot beverage more largely than in the dry warm climate\r\nof Australia; and, after all, great as the Australian consumption\r\nseems, it is scarcely more than a quarter of an ounce per head per\r\nweek above the allowance to English domestic servants.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of tea, notwithstanding the dicta of Mr. Montgomery\r\nMartin, is destined to a prodigious increase. Nor is it solely to an\r\nincrease in the consumption of tea, that we must look to prevent any\r\ndeficiency in the revenue, as there is no doubt that a reduction in\r\nthe price of the article would lead to a prodigious increase in the\r\nquantity of sugar consumed, especially by the lower classes, who\r\nseldom take the one without the other.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, merely that they would buy sugar in proportion to\r\nthe quantity of tea that they consume; the circumstance of a smaller\r\nsum being requisite for their weekly stock of tea, would enable them\r\nto spend a larger amount in other articles, among which sugar would,\r\nundoubtedly, be one of the most important. The merchant, shipowner,\r\nmanufacturer, and all connected with the trade between Great Britain\r\nand China, are in a position to see the prodigious advantages that\r\nsuch a measure as an extensive reduction of the impost on tea would\r\noccasion to the general trade of the country; and the public at large,\r\nwho are not practically familiar with the subject, only require it to\r\nbe brought before them in a distinct point of view, when the important\r\nresults of such a reduction cannot fail to be apparent to them.\r\n\r\nTea is not now within the reach of the poor man. A person taking tea\r\nonce a day, will consume about 7½ lbs. a year.\r\n\r\n                                                                       lbs.\r\nSay 500,000 persons take tea twice a day, or 15 lbs. a year, is    7,500,000\r\nSay 4,000,000 persons take tea once a day, or 7½ lbs. a year, is  30,000,000\r\nSay 12,000,000 persons take tea once a week, or 1 lb. a year, is  12,000,000\r\n                                                                  ----------\r\n                                                                  49,500,000\r\n\r\nWhich shows that, at present, only one person out of every sixty can\r\nhave tea twice a day; one of every seven only once a day; and that out\r\nof the remaining 13,500,000 persons, only five millions and a half can\r\nprocure it once in the week. The exact state of the case shows that\r\nonly eight millions of the people of the United Kingdom enjoy the use\r\nof tea, leaving the other twenty-two millions excluded. A Chinese will\r\nconsume thirty pounds of tea in the year.\r\n\r\nBut it is said we must not, if our accumulated stocks be drank off\r\nthis year, expect the Chinese to meet at once so huge an increase in\r\nthe demand as to supply us with as much next year.\r\n\r\nNow on no point of the case is the evidence so clear as upon the\r\ncapacity of the Chinese to furnish, within any year, any quantity we\r\nmay require. The Committee of 1847, on Commercial Relations with\r\nChina, state--\"That the demand for tea from China has been\r\nprogressively and rapidly rising for many years, with no other results\r\nthan that of diminished prices:\"--a fact to be accounted for only upon\r\nthe supposition that our ordinary demand is exceedingly small in\r\nproportion to the Chinese supply. Nor is it an unreasonable inference,\r\nthat if so much more than usual was to be had at a less price than\r\nbefore, any rise of price, however trivial it might be, would bring\r\nforward a much larger quantity:[8] a supposition which is completely\r\nconfirmed by a review of prices here, and exports from China within\r\nthe last four years; and in considering which it is important to bear\r\nin mind--1st, that our tea trade year, on which our account of import,\r\nexport, home consumption, and stock on hand is taken, is from January\r\nto January, and the Chinese tea year from July to July; 2nd, that a\r\nrise at the close of the last months of the year in England,\r\ninfluences the next year's exports from China; and 3rdly, that of late\r\nyears, since something of decrepitude has fallen upon the Chinese\r\nGovernment, smuggling there, to escape the export duty, has been\r\ncarried on largely and at an increasing rate, so that the return is\r\nconsiderably below the real export.\r\n\r\nIn the Chinese tea year, July to July, 1848-9, the price of good\r\nordinary congou, the tea of by far the largest consumption here, and\r\nwhich, in fact, rules the market, was 8½d. to 9-1/3d., and the export\r\nfrom China 47,251,000 lbs. The year closed with the higher price, and\r\nthe Chinese export from July 1849, to July 1850, was 54,000,000 lbs.,\r\nshowing an increase of export on the year of 6,750,000 lbs. Throughout\r\n1850, here, prices fluctuated a good deal. They were low in the\r\nearlier part of the year, but in January went up from 9½d. to 11½d.,\r\nand from July 1850, to July 1851, the export from China rose to\r\n64,000,000 lbs., being an increase of ten million pounds on a previous\r\nincrease of nearly seven million lbs. Prices here, during 1851, varied\r\nvery much: it was difficult to say whether any rise would be\r\nestablished, but the export still went up and reached, from July 1851,\r\nto July 1852, 67,000,000 lbs., giving a total increase in three years\r\nof 19,750,000 lbs. Nor was it pretended that in any of those years the\r\nChinese market showed even the least symptoms of exhaustion. \"We\r\nknow,\" say the Committee, \"that the Chinese market has never been\r\ndrained of tea in any one year, but that there has been always a\r\nsurplus left to meet any extraordinary demand.\" But the effect of the\r\nrise in price in 1850 is still more forcibly shown by a comparison of\r\nour total imports in that and the following year. In 1850 we imported\r\n48,300,000 lbs.; in 1851, 71,500,000 lbs., being an increase of\r\n23,200,000 lbs. Doubtless the Chinese export, if made up totally with\r\nour year, would not account for the whole quantity, part of which is\r\nto be set down to Chinese export-smuggling, and part to arrivals from\r\nAmerica and the Continent. The probability is that the increase of\r\nprice referred to above never reached the Chinese tea farmers; the\r\nsupply came from the merchants' stock on hand. The rise was, besides,\r\nuncertain, and from any established advance a much larger increase of\r\nexport might be looked for.\r\n\r\nBut the mistake made in England in estimating what tea we may look for\r\nfrom China goes upon the supposition that they grow expressly for us:\r\nthe fact being, as stated by Mr. Robt. Fortune, in his recently\r\npublished \"Tea Districts of China,\" \"that the quantity exported bears\r\nbut a small proportion to that consumed by the Chinese themselves.\" On\r\nthis point the report of the Parliamentary Committee is\r\nexplicit:--\"There is a population in China, commonly assumed at above\r\nthree hundred millions, at all hours in the day consuming tea, which\r\nonly requires some change of preparation to be fit for exportation;\r\nthus implying an amount of supply on which any demand that may be made\r\nfor foreign export can be, after a very short time, but slightly\r\nfelt.\" Mr. Fortune, in his evidence, says \"that the Chinese drink\r\nabout four times as much as we do: they are always drinking it.\" Four\r\ntimes as much is probably very much an under-estimate. With rich and\r\npoor of all that swarming population, tea, not such as our working\r\nclasses drink, but fresh and strong, and with no second watering,\r\naccompanies every meal. But even taking their consumption at four\r\ntimes as much per head as ours, and their population at the lowest\r\nestimate, at three hundred millions, their consumption, setting ours\r\nat 55,000,000 lbs., will be no less than two thousand two hundred\r\nmillions of pounds per annum, or forty times the quantity used in the\r\nUnited Kingdom. As reasonably might the few foreigners who visit the\r\nmetropolis in the summer expect to cause a famine of fruit and\r\nvegetables in London, as we that a doubling of our demand for tea\r\nwould be felt in China. The further fifty-five million pounds would be\r\nbut another fortieth of what they use themselves, and would have no\r\nmore effect upon their entire market than the arrival of some thousand\r\nstrangers within the year in London would have upon the supply of\r\nbread or butchers' meat. There is no need, therefore, to wait for the\r\nextension of tea plantations, and so far from taking for granted the\r\nstatement of the late Chancellor of the Exchequer, \"that time must be\r\ngiven to increase production, and that the point of its taking three\r\nor four years to make a tea-tree is to be considered in dealing with\r\nthe duties,\" we have the fact unmistakeably before us, that the\r\nproduction is already so vast, that any demand from us could have no\r\nappreciable effect. And as to future supplies, if we should come to\r\ndrink as much as the Chinese themselves, a matter not at all needful\r\nto be considered at present, the Committee report that \"the\r\ncultivation of the plant may be indefinitely extended;\" whilst Mr.\r\nFortune, who has been upon the spot, states \"that there is not the\r\nslightest doubt that there is a great part of the land which is nearly\r\nuncultivated now, which, were there a demand for tea, could be brought\r\ninto cultivation. The cost would be very little indeed; they would cut\r\ndown a quantity of brushwood, and probably dig over the ground and\r\nplant the bushes. They could clear and plant it in the same year, and\r\nin about two years they could get something from it.\" As, however,\r\nwithout this extension they have hitherto found enough for the\r\nincrease of their own vast population, for every extension of demand\r\nfrom us and every other foreign customer, whether by land or water,\r\nwithout the least tendency to an advance in price, there is no need\r\nto do more than thus touch upon the undeveloped resources of tea\r\nproduction.--_Travers on the Tea Duties_.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of tea in Russia is very great, as the middling\r\nclasses make a more frequent use of that beverage than the rest. Every\r\nyear 60,000 chests of tea arrive at Maimiatchin and Kiakhta, of the\r\ndeclared official value of £1,185,000 sterling; and to this may be\r\nadded £38,650 for inferior tea used by the people of the south, which\r\nmakes the total declared value of the tea introduced about one and a\r\nquarter million sterling. The consumption of Russia may be assumed at\r\nover fifteen millions of pounds, although we have no correct data, as\r\nin the case of shipping returns, to calculate from. In 1848, however,\r\nthe Russians took 136,217½ boxes of fine tea of the Chinese, for which\r\nthey paid 5,349,918 silver roubles--one million sterling. The quantity\r\nforwarded from Kiakhta into the interior consisted of--\r\n\r\n                                        Foods.\r\n  Flowery or Pekoe tea                  69,677\r\n  Ordinary tea                         183,752\r\n  Brick tea                            116,249\r\n    Equal to about fifteen million lbs. English.\r\n\r\n_Brick tea of Thibet._--A sample of this curious product was shown by\r\nthe East India Company in 1851. It is formed of the refuse tea-leaves\r\nand sweepings of the granaries, damped and pressed into a mould,\r\ngenerally with a little bullock's blood. The finer sorts are friable\r\nmasses, and are packed in papers; the coarser sewn up in sheep's skin.\r\nIn this form it is an article of commerce throughout Central and\r\nNorthern Asia and the Himalayan provinces; and is consumed by Mongols,\r\nTartars, and Tibetans, churned with milk, salt, butter, and boiling\r\nwater, more as a soup than as tea proper.

Koempfer says it is cultivated in\r\nJapan, as far north as 45 degrees. It seems to succeed best on the\r\nsides of mountains, among sandstone, schistus, and granite.\r\n\r\nIn 1834, the East India Company introduced the cultivation of tea in\r\nUpper Assam, where it is said to be indigenous; and they now ship\r\nlarge quantities of very excellent tea from thence.\r\n\r\nMr. Boyer, director of the museum at Port Louis, Mauritius, has\r\nsucceeded in rearing 40,000 tea-trees, and expresses an opinion, that\r\nif the island of Bourbon would give itself up to the cultivation, it\r\nmight easily supply France with all the tea she requires.\r\n\r\nThe culture has also been commenced on a small scale, in St. Helena,\r\nand the Cape Colony.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the tea-tree might be tried with probability of\r\nsuccess in Natal, and the Mauritius. The plant grows in every soil,\r\neven the most ungrateful; resists the hurricanes, and requires little\r\ncare. The picking of the leaves, like the pods of cotton, is performed\r\nby women, children, and the infirm, without much expense. The\r\npreparation is known to the greater part of the Chinese, of whom there\r\nare so many in Mauritius; besides, it is not difficult. A Mr. Duprat\r\nhas, I am informed, planted a certain extent of land in the\r\nneighbourhood of Cernpipe, in that island, but I have not yet learnt\r\nwith what success.\r\n\r\nThe tea-plant has been successfully cultivated, on a large scale, in\r\nthe island of Madeira, at an elevation of 3,000 feet above the level\r\nof the sea, by Mr. Hy. Veitch, British ex-Consul. The quality of the\r\nleaf is excellent. The whole theory of preparing it is merely to\r\ndestroy the herbaceous taste, the leaves being perfect, when, like\r\nhay, they emit an agreeable odor. But to roll up each leaf, as in\r\nChina, is found too expensive, although boys and girls are employed at\r\nabout two-pence or three-pence per day. Mr. Veitch has, therefore,\r\ntried the plan of compressing the leaves into small cakes, which can\r\nbe done at a trifling expense. It is performed when the leaf is dry;\r\nwhereas, the rolling requires moisture, and subsequent roasting on\r\ncopper plates is necessary to prevent mustiness. In this process the\r\nacid of the tea acts upon the copper, and causes that astringency\r\nwhich we remark in all the China teas.\r\n\r\nThe tea of Cochin China is considered inferior to that of China, being\r\nless strong and pleasant in flavour.\r\n\r\nAn inferior sort of tea, with a leaf twice or thrice as large as that\r\nof Bohea, grows wild in the hilly parts of Quang-ai, and is sold at\r\nfrom 12s. 6d. to 40s. the picul of 133lbs.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch have devoted much attention to tea cultivation in Java, and\r\nthe plantations are in fine order. Nearly a million lbs. of tea were\r\nshipped thence in 1848; but the tea is said to be of inferior quality,\r\nand grown and manufactured at considerable expense.\r\n\r\nJapan produces both black and green tea. The Japanese prefer the\r\nlatter to the Chinese green tea. The black tea is very bad. The\r\nJapanese tea-tree, is an evergreen, growing in the most sterile places\r\nto the height of about six feet. It is described as above, by\r\nKoempfer, as having leaves like the cherry, with a flower like the wild\r\nrose; when fresh, the leaves have no smell, but a very astringent\r\ntaste. Tea grows in all the southern provinces of Japan, but the best\r\ngreen is produced in the principality of Kioto, where it is cultivated\r\nwith great care.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, Messrs. Worms attempted the cultivation of tea in\r\nCeylon. The island, however, lies too far within the tropics to offer\r\na climate like Assam, which is situate without them. The plants may\r\nthrive to appearance, but that is not a demonstration of their\r\nquality. The tea-plant has reached upwards of six feet in height at\r\nPinang, and in as healthy a state as could be desired, but the leaf\r\nhad no flavor, and although thousands of Chinese husbandmen cultivate\r\nspices, and other tropical productions on that island, no one thinks\r\nit worth while to extend the cultivation of the tea-plant in Pinang.\r\nThe Chinese there laugh at the idea of converting the leaf into a\r\nbeverage.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the tea-plant has been introduced into the United\r\nStates, and those planters who have tried the experiment have\r\nsucceeded beyond their highest expectations. Dr. Junius Smith had\r\nsuccessfully cultivated the plant on his property called Golden grove,\r\nnear Grenville, in South Carolina. His plants were in full blossom,\r\nand as healthy and flourishing as those of China at the same stage of\r\ngrowth. Everything connected with them looked favorable, and Dr. Smith\r\nfelt abundantly encouraged to extend the culture of the several\r\ndescriptions of tea upon his property. It is stated that his\r\nexpectations were so great, that he contemplated to place fresh tea on\r\nthe tea-tables of England and Paris in twenty days, from the\r\nplantation. He had a large supply of plants, and tea seed enough for a\r\nmillion more. The black descriptions blossomed earlier than the green\r\nplant, but the latter also blossomed luxuriantly.\r\n\r\nHe introduced at first about 500 plants of from five to seven years'\r\ngrowth, overland from the north-west provinces of India, and some from\r\nChina direct.\r\n\r\nIn the close of 1849, he writes me:--\r\n\r\n    \"During the past year the tea-plant under my care has passed through\r\n    severe trials, from the injury received in transplanting, from the\r\n    heat generated in the packing-cases, from the want of shelter during\r\n    the severe frosts of February, from the excessive heat in June, and\r\n    from the drought of 58 days' continuance in July and August. The\r\n    plants were divested of their leaves and generally of their branches\r\n    and twigs in February, during my absence in New York. Knowing that\r\n    the plants were tender, and not fortified by age and mature growth\r\n    against severe weather, I had directed them to be covered in case a\r\n    material change of temperature should occur. But these orders were\r\n    neglected, and they consequently suffered from that cause.\r\n\r\n    The plant is sufficiently hardy to resist any weather occurring in\r\n    this part of the country, when seasoned for one year.\r\n\r\n    The plant has grown thrifty since April, and the quantity of\r\n    foliage, buds, and blossoms, show that the root has taken strong\r\n    hold, and is now fully equal to produce its fruit next autumn, which\r\n    always follows the year after the blossoms. I have a variety of both\r\n    black and green tea-plants. The buds and blossoms of the latter did\r\n    not appear until a fortnight after the black tea-plant. But the\r\n    blossoms were larger when they did appear in September, October,\r\n    November, and December. From present appearances, I think the\r\n    blossoms of some of the late plants will continue to unfold until\r\n    spring. It is not an unusual thing for the blossoms and the fruit to\r\n    appear at the same time upon the same plant. In this particular it\r\n    differs from any plant I have seen. As my chief object, at present,\r\n    is to cultivate and increase the tea-nut, it will be a year or two\r\n    perhaps before I attempt to convert the leaf into tea. The root\r\n    supports the leaf and fruit, and the leaf the root, so that neither\r\n    can be spared without detriment.\r\n\r\n    This climate appears congenial to the growth of the plant, and the\r\n    soil is so diversified in this mountainous district, that there is\r\n    no difficulty in selecting that best adapted to seed-growing plants,\r\n    or that designed for the leaf only. Upon the plantation purchased\r\n    this summer, I have light-yellow, dark-brown, and red clay subsoil,\r\n    of a friable character, with a surface soil sufficiently sandy to\r\n    answer the demands of the plant. I do not see any reason to doubt,\r\n    from a year's experience, that the tea-plant in its varieties will\r\n    flourish in what I heretofore denominated the tea-growing district\r\n    of the United States, as well as in any part of China.\r\n\r\n    The slowness of its growth requires patience. But when once\r\n    established, the tea-nuts will supply the means of extending\r\n    cultivation, and the duration of the plant for twenty years\r\n    diminishes the expense of labor. To illustrate the hardihood of the\r\n    plant, I may observe, that notwithstanding the zero severity of\r\n    February frost destroyed the leaves and branches of most of the\r\n    plants, and those now blooming in great beauty and strength are from\r\n    roots the growth of this summer, I have one green tea-plant the stem\r\n    and branches of which withstood the frost of February without the\r\n    slightest protection, and is now a splendid plant, covered with\r\n    branches and evergreen leaves, affording undeniable evidence not\r\n    only of its capability of resisting frost, but of its adaptation to\r\n    just such a degree of temperature.\r\n\r\n    I have often remarked that the tea-plant requires for its perfection\r\n    the influence of two separate and distinct climates, the heat of\r\n    summer and the cold of winter. The thermometer in this vicinity\r\n    during the heat of summer generally ranges from 74 at 6 o'clock a.m.\r\n    to 82 at 3 o'clock p.m., only one day during the summer so high as\r\n    86.\r\n\r\n    This is a most agreeable temperature, nights always cool, which the\r\n    tea-plant enjoys, and the days hot and fanned with the mountain\r\n    breeze.\r\n\r\n    The drought I found the most difficult point to contend with, owing\r\n    to the want of adequate means for irrigation. I lost 20 or 30 plants\r\n    through this, and learned that no tea plantation should he\r\n    established without irrigation. After two or three years there will\r\n    be little necessity for it, because the depth of the roots will\r\n    generally then protect the plant.\r\n\r\n    My plantation at Golden Grove is well supplied with water, or I\r\n    should not have purchased it at any price.\r\n\r\n    It is the first and most important point to secure a southern or\r\n    western aspect, a gentle declivity the second, salubrious air and\r\n    suitable soil the third.\r\n\r\n    Our country is filled with natural tea plantations, which are only\r\n    waiting the hand of the husbandman to be covered with this luxuriant\r\n    and productive plant.\r\n\r\n    I know the public is naturally impatient of delay. Like corn, it is\r\n    expected that the tea-nuts will be planted in the spring, and the\r\n    crop gathered in the autumn. But they forget that the tea-plant does\r\n    not interfere with any other crop, and when once planted it does not\r\n    soon require a renewal.\r\n\r\n    I have sometimes felt this impatience myself, and longed for a cup\r\n    of tea of my own growing, but I have never had one. As a husbandman,\r\n    I must wait some time longer, and let patience have her perfect\r\n    work.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, under date May 1, 1850, he states that he has succeeded\r\nadmirably in the culture. The plants bear the winter well, and their\r\nphysiology and general characteristics remain unchanged by the change\r\nof climate and soil. The leaf puts out at the same period of the year\r\nthat it does in China.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of May, 1850, Dr. Smith received a further batch of\r\ntrees, fresh, green and healthful, as if still growing in the\r\nplantations of China; after a passage of little more than five months.\r\nThese plants, together with the seedlings and nuts, were of the green\r\ntea species, and obtained from a quarter situated about 700 miles from\r\nCanton.\r\n\r\nIn a letter, dated Grenville, S.C., June 17th, 1850, with which I have\r\nbeen favored, he adds:--\r\n\r\n    \"I never heard of the failure of the tea-crop. All vegetation may be\r\n    retarded, or lessened, or augmented, in its production, in a slight\r\n    degree, by excessive rains, or drought, or cold, or heat, or\r\n    atmospheric action; but the tea-plant is sure to produce its leaf.\r\n    From all I have observed, a decided drought is the most detrimental\r\n    to the health of the tea plant. The almost continued rains which\r\n    marked the advance of the past spring, seemed perfectly agreeable to\r\n    the tea-plant, and facilitated the germination of the tea-nuts.\r\n    Where any vitality remained in the nut, it was sure to germinate.\r\n    Curiosity, on this point should be restrained, and no picking and\r\n    pawing up of the nuts permitted. I have seedlings with tap roots\r\n    four inches in length, where no appearance of germination is visible\r\n    upon the surface of the ground. The chances are ten to one that the\r\n    seedling would be destroyed by the tamperings of idle curiosity. Let\r\n    nature have her own most perfect work, and see that the enemy, the\r\n    drought, is vanquished by an abundant supply of water.\r\n\r\n    From experience, I notice that nothing is more congenial to the\r\n    germination of the tea-nut than a good stiff blue, clayed soil. The\r\n    marly colour of the soil is undoubtedly the result of a rich loam,\r\n    combined with the clay of a lighter hue. The adhesive nature of the\r\n    clay retains moisture in an eminent degree, and the fertilising\r\n    qualities of the loam are well known to every bottom land farmer.\r\n\r\n    Plants put out three weeks ago, after a long voyage from China, are\r\n    now taking root, and look fresh and vigorous, notwithstanding the\r\n    recent heat and dryness of the atmosphere. But I have taken\r\n    unwearied pains in the cultivation. Every plant is sheltered from\r\n    the scorching influence of the sun, now from 70 deg. to 86 deg. of\r\n    temperature. Although the soil is naturally moist and clayey, and\r\n    half bottom land, from the work of gentle acclivities, rising on\r\n    either hand, yet I have given the plants a liberal watering in the\r\n    evening. By last summer's drought of fifty-seven days, I was taught\r\n    the absolute necessity of deep digging and deep planting. None of my\r\n    plants, of this season's planting, are more than two or three inches\r\n    above the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\n    If any of the plants have leaves, as most of them have, below that\r\n    height, they are planted with the leaves retained; none are removed.\r\n    Some of the older plants have no leaves remaining, and looked like\r\n    dry sticks. Many of these are now beginning to break, and put forth\r\n    fresh leaves.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1851, Mr. Frank Bonynge set on foot a subscription list of fifty\r\ndollars each, to procure tea and various Indian plants for culture in\r\nAmerica. That tea can be grown successfully in Carolina, Georgia, and\r\nFlorida, is almost certain, because the experiment has been pretty\r\nfairly tried, as above shown, by Dr. Smith. The thermometer at\r\nShanghai indicates the cold as more severe by thirteen degrees than at\r\nCharleston, South Carolina. The cold winter of 1834-5, which destroyed\r\nthe oranges in Mr. Middleton's plantation, in Charleston, left his tea\r\nplants uninjured.\r\n\r\nThe question of cultivating tea in California has been seriously\r\ndiscussed, and will no doubt be gone into when the gold digging mania\r\nhas a little subsided. There is the necessary labor and experience on\r\nthe spot, in some 12,000 or 14,000 Chinese, most of whom doubtless\r\nunderstand the culture and manufacture. The climate, soil and surface\r\nof California exactly answer the requirements for the growth of this\r\nplant. The time may yet come when the vast ranges of hills that\r\ntraverse this State shall present terraces of tea gardens, cultivated\r\nby the laborious Chinese, and adding millions to the value of its\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nA company for the cultivation of tea, under the title of the Assam\r\nCompany, was established in March, 1839; and which, with a called-up\r\ncapital of £193,337, has made up to the present time very profitable\r\nprogress; having now got its plantations into excellent cultivation,\r\nand all its arrangements in admirable working order, it has sold teas\r\nto the amount of £90,000, and has a steam-boat, a considerable plant\r\nand machinery.\r\n\r\nIn the report of the Company, at their annual meeting, held at\r\nCalcutta, in Jan., 1850, it was stated, as the result of their\r\noperations, that during the year 1849, the manufacturing season was\r\nunusually cold and ungenial, in consequence of which the development\r\nof leaf for manufacture was much checked. Although some loss was\r\nsustained, there was considerable increase in the crop\r\nnotwithstanding, attributable to the continued improvements in the\r\nculture which had been obtained, and improvements over the previous\r\nseason in some departments of the manufacturing process. The gross\r\nquantity of unsorted tea manufactured in the southern division was\r\n207,982 lbs., being 2,673 lbs. less than that of the previous season,\r\nbut the actual net out-turn was expected to reach 200,000 lbs. As much\r\nas 157,908 lbs. of the crop had been already received and shipped to\r\nEngland. These teas consisted chiefly of the finer qualities. Whilst\r\nthe crops have been thus sensibly advancing in quantity and quality,\r\nand the value of the company's plantations permanently raised by\r\nextended and improved culture, and some increase to the sowings, the\r\ntotal outlay had been somewhat less than the previous year, the\r\nexpenditure being limited to £500 for a crop of 12,000 acres of tea.\r\nWith more extended gardens, the produce will be raised at a yet lower\r\nrateable cost than at present.\r\n\r\nThe number of acres in cultivation in 1849, was about 12,000; these\r\nwere not all in bearing, but would shortly be so, and the produce from\r\nthis extent might be estimated at 300,000 lbs., and the cost of\r\nproducing this would be about £11,000. 1,010 chests of the produce\r\nwere sold in London on the 13th of March, 1850, at a gross average of\r\n1s. 11½d. per lb. The produce of 1847, sold in England, was 141,277\r\nlbs., at a gross average of 1s. 8d. per lb.: that of 1848 was 176,149\r\nlbs. which sold at the average of 1s. 8½d. per lb. The produce of 1849\r\nwas 216,000 lbs., and there was every expectation of the average\r\nprices realised being higher than those of the previous years. The\r\nseason was cold and unfavorable, or the crop would have been 10,000\r\nlbs. more.\r\n\r\nThe exact amounts obtained for the Company's teas in the five years,\r\nending with 1851, will be seen from the following figures:--\r\n\r\n   Net produce, lbs.             Average price.    £\r\n  1847        144,164 at per lb.  ls. 7-1/16d.  11,513\r\n  1848        182,953     \"       ls. 8¼d.      15,436\r\n  1849        216,000     \"       ls. 9½d.      19,350\r\n  1850        253,427     \"       ls. 6-1/8d.   18,153\r\n  1851        271,427     \"       ls. 8½d.      22,152\r\n  1852 esmtd. 280,000\r\n\r\nThis exhibits a progressive increase in the aggregate value of the\r\nCompany's produce, and this has been effected, it is stated, without\r\nany sensible increase of the current expenditure. It exhibits also a\r\nrise in the value of the tea (157,942 lbs. having been sold at the\r\nhigh average price of 1s. 11¼d.), a fact strongly indicative of its\r\nincreasing excellence. The details of the crop of the season of 1849\r\nshowed a net produce of 237,000 lbs. of tea; so that the Company are\r\nincreasing their cultivation to the extent of nearly ten per cent, per\r\nannum, and the increase will doubtless proceed with greater rapidity,\r\nwhenever the increase of capital enables the directors to extend their\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nIn a report submitted to the Directors, by Mr. Burkinyoung, the\r\nmanaging director in Calcutta last year, he thus speaks of the\r\nCompany's field of operations and future prospects:--\r\n\r\n    \"The box-making is especially worthy of notice for its effective\r\n    organisation and economical arrangement; the work is performed\r\n    chiefly by Assamese boys instructed at the factory: the number of\r\n    boxes required for the year's consumption will not be short of four\r\n    thousand, the whole of which will be made at the factory,--an\r\n    achievement that cannot be too highly estimated in a country so\r\n    destitute of mechanical labor.\r\n\r\n    Notwithstanding the high standard of quality and strength to which\r\n    our teas have already attained, I am of opinion that, as experience\r\n    advances, and our knowledge and system of plucking and manufacturing\r\n    the crops become improved, and better organised, a higher standard\r\n    of quality and value may yet be realised; in this opinion the\r\n    superintendent concurs with me, and the attainment of this object is\r\n    one to which his attention's prominently directed.\r\n\r\n    In the course of my enquiries and trials of different samples of tea\r\n    in Assam, my attention was directed to one description of black tea,\r\n    of rough strong flavor, made by a quicker process than that\r\n    ordinarily used in the manufacture of black tea: under this mode of\r\n    manipulation, a quality of tea is produced sufficiently distinctive\r\n    in its flavor and appearance to render it worthy of attention and\r\n    trial, and I think, when perfected in the process of manufacture,\r\n    calculated to come into popular estimation. Samples of this tea the\r\n    superintendent will forward to the board for trial.\r\n\r\n    In conducting the operations in Assam, the chief difficulty of\r\n    importance which has not yet been effectually met is the paucity of\r\n    labor; this does not, however, exist to the extent of materially\r\n    checking any of the important operations connected with the\r\n    production of the tea, but it is felt in the arrear of various\r\n    descriptions of work, in providing bricks for building, and in the\r\n    preparation of a stock of seasoned timber and boards for building\r\n    and box-making; while the out factories would be benefited by a\r\n    larger proportion of agricultural labor. Great advance, however, has\r\n    been made by the superintendent in the employment of Assamese labor\r\n    in contract work: under the arrangement he has established, these\r\n    contracts are now, for the most part, fulfilled with much\r\n    punctuality, and there is reason to expect that this system of labor\r\n    will be further extended. The Kachorie Coolies are a valuable class\r\n    of laborers, but they do not appear to be sufficiently numerous, or\r\n    to emigrate in sufficient numbers to afford with the native Assamese\r\n    a supply of labor altogether equal to our wants, so as to render the\r\n    concern independent of Bengal labor.\r\n\r\n    The tea lands are for the most part advantageously situated, within\r\n    convenient reach of water-carriage, either by the 'Dickhoo,'\r\n    'Dêsang,' and 'Dehing' rivers, or by means of small streams leading\r\n    to them. The Plantations of the Satsohea and Rookang forests, and on\r\n    the banks of the Tingri in the Northern Division, are all valuable\r\n    centres of extension in each district. The lands suitable for tea\r\n    cultivation are ample in extent, and of the highest fertility; while\r\n    the Hill Factories of the Southern and Eastern Divisions, although\r\n    secondary in importance, are, as regards extent and quality of soil,\r\n    equally eligible as bases of extension.\r\n\r\n    The prospects of the future, I entertain no doubt, will keep pace\r\n    with the satisfactory results that have hitherto been realised,\r\n    looking to the sound organisation that now exists in our\r\n    establishment at Assam, an organisation that has already taken\r\n    healthy root, and must in its growth gain strength and permanence. I\r\n    think we may safely calculate, after the current year, upon an\r\n    annual increase in our production of 40,000 lbs. of tea, until a\r\n    larger system of operations can be matured, of which the basis is\r\n    already laid down, in the new lands cleared and sown during the past\r\n    cold season, averaging 225 to 250 poorahs; and this extended basis\r\n    will be doubtless followed up by annual extensions of similar, if\r\n    not larger, area. The concern is now taking a position which will\r\n    place it on a scale of working commensurate with the objects\r\n    entertained upon the first incorporation of the company, the profits\r\n    now likely to be realised being adequate to all the outlay\r\n    necessary.\"\r\n\r\nThe prices in the last two years in London have been fully maintained\r\nat 1s. 3d. to 4s. 4d., according to sorts. Of Assam tea, the sales in\r\nthe London market in 1851 amounted to 2,200 packages, against 1,900\r\npackages in 1850, and all were freely taken (on account of their great\r\nstrength) at very full prices. Seventy-six packages of Kumaon tea,\r\nboth black and green, grown by the East India Company, in the\r\nHimalayas, as an experiment, were also brought to sale. They were teas\r\nof high quality; but being of the light flavored class, and not duly\r\nesteemed in this market, they realised only about their relative value\r\nas compared with China teas of similar grade. The Souchong and\r\nPouchong sold at 1s. 1¼d. to 1s. 3½d.; the Hyson, Imperial, and\r\nGunpowder realised 1s. 7¾d. to 2s. 6½d.\r\n\r\nMr. Robert Fortune, who, in the service of the Horticultural Society\r\nof London, gave such satisfaction by his botanical researches in\r\nChina, was, on his return to England, in 1848, engaged by the\r\nDirectors of the East India Company to proceed again to the Celestial\r\nEmpire, and procure and transmit to India such a quantity and variety\r\nof the tea plant, that its cultivation in the north-western provinces\r\nwould be a matter of mere manual labor. Having penetrated about 300\r\nmiles into the interior, he left Hong Kong in the middle of 1851 for\r\nCalcutta, with a large quantity of choice plants, selected in the\r\ngreen tea districts, and these have flourished as well as could\r\npossibly be expected; so that, in the course of a few years, there is\r\nevery probability that tea will form a considerable article of export\r\nfrom our Indian Presidencies. Mr. Fortune secured the services of, and\r\ntook with him, eight Chinese, from the district of Wei-chow, under an\r\nagreement for three years, at the rate of fifteen dollars a month\r\neach. Six of these are regular tea-manufacturers; the other two are\r\npewterers, whose sole business is that of preparing lead casings for\r\ntea-chests.\r\n\r\nIn the British portion of the Punjaub, it has been resolved to expend\r\n£10,000 a year on the cultivation of the tea plant on the banks of the\r\nBeas, as well as at Anarkullee, and Kotghur in the Simla jurisdiction.\r\nBeyond the Beas there is a series of valleys on to Noonpoor, viz., the\r\nPalklun, Kangra, Rillo, &c., from 3,000 to 4,000 feet above the level\r\nof the sea, separated from each other by small ranges of hills. The\r\nvalleys are from three to four miles in breadth, and from sixty to\r\nseventy in length: they are sheltered on the north by high mountains.\r\nThey are described as admirably suited for the cultivation of the\r\nplant, now about to be attempted under the able management of Dr.\r\nJamieson. Should it prove successful, the benefits it will confer on\r\nthe country will be enormous. Tea is a favorite beverage everywhere\r\nwith the natives: at present their supplies come in scanty measure and\r\nbad condition, at extravagant charges, across the frontier.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the tea plant in the highlands of the Punjaub, is\r\nlikely to be successful, even beyond the hopes of its promoters.\r\nThousands of plants sown in 1849 have attained a height of four or\r\nfive feet, and there seems no reason why tea should not ultimately\r\nbecome an important article of trade in the Punjaub, as well as in\r\nKumaon. The Indian teas are already becoming popular in the English\r\nmarket, and the cultivators have the advantage of a demand which is\r\nalmost unlimited, and of prices which seldom fluctuate to any great\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nThe experiment of growing tea in the Madras Presidency has been often\r\nsuccessfully tried, on a small scale. A number of plants supplied by\r\ngovernment, through Dr. Wallich, were planted in the Shevaroy hills,\r\nabout twelve or fourteen years since, and have thriven well; but\r\nthough no doubt is entertained of the ease with which they could be\r\npropagated over a wide extent of country, no attempt has been made to\r\ngive the cultivation a practical turn, or to make a cup of tea from\r\nthe southern Indian tree. In Coorg, too, the experiment has been\r\ntested with like results, so that sufficient warranty exists to\r\njustify trials on the largest scale.\r\n\r\nTea plants grow in luxuriance in the open air, at the Botanical\r\nGardens, at Kew. Mr. Bonynge has seen this plant growing wild in N.\r\nlat. 27 deg. 30 min. on hills from three to 500 feet in height, where\r\ntoo, there was an abundance of frost, snow and hail.\r\n\r\nThose persons in England who possess tea plants, and who cultivate\r\nthem for pleasure, should always bear in mind that, even in the tea\r\ndistricts of China, this shrub will not succeed if it be planted in\r\nlow, wet land; and this is, doubtless, one of the reasons why so few\r\npersons succeed in growing it in this country. It ought always to be\r\nplanted on a warm sloping bank, in order to give it a fair chance of\r\nsuccess. If some of the warm spots of this kind in the south of\r\nEngland or Ireland were selected, who knows but that our cottagers\r\nmight be able to grow their own tea? at all events, they might have\r\nthe fragrant herb to look upon.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch made the first movement to break the charm of Chinese\r\nmonopoly, by introducing and cultivating the tea plant in their rich\r\nand fruitful colony of Java. That island lies between the sixth and\r\neighth degrees of south latitude.\r\n\r\nIn 1828, the first experiment in the cultivation of tea was made in\r\nthe garden of the Chateau of Burtenzorg, at Java, where 800 plants of\r\nan astonishing vigor, served as an encouragement to undertake this\r\nculture, and considerable plantations were made in many parts of the\r\nisland. The first trials did not answer to the expectations, as far as\r\nregards the quality of the article, the astringent taste and feeble\r\naroma of which caused the conjecture that the preparation of the leaf,\r\nand its final manipulation, are not exactly according to the process\r\nused in China. At present tea is cultivated in thirteen Residencies:\r\nbut the principal establishment, where the final manipulation is made,\r\nis in the neighbourhood of Batavia. The tea which Java now furnishes\r\nyearly to the markets of the mother country, may be stated at from\r\n200,000 to 300,000 pounds. It is intimated that the government intends\r\nto abandon this culture to the industry of private individuals, under\r\nthe guarantee of equitable contracts.\r\n\r\nThe mountain range, which runs through the centre of the island, is\r\nthe most productive, because the tea gardens, extending from near the\r\nbase, high up the mountains, reach an atmosphere tempered by\r\nelevation. The plant escapes the scorching heats of the torrid zone,\r\nand finds a climate, by height rather than by latitude, adapted to its\r\nnature. But the plant is not confined to lofty ridges. In the plains,\r\nthe hedges and fences, if one may so call them, are all planted with\r\nthe tea shrub, which flourish in greater or less perfection throughout\r\nthe island. But, as has already been intimated, the equatorial\r\nlatitudes are not the most auspicious for the vigorous growth of a\r\nplant that requires a temperature equally removed from the extremes of\r\nheat and cold, and the quality of the tea is as much affected by the\r\nclimate as the growth of the plant. A considerable quantity of tea is\r\nannually shipped from Java to Europe; but the extension of the\r\ncultivation is no doubt checked by the exceeding fertility of the\r\nsoil, and its adaptation to the growth of the rich products of\r\ntropical regions.\r\n\r\nMr. Jacobson, inspector of tea culture in Java, has published at\r\nBatavia a work in three volumes, upon the mode of cultivating this\r\nplant, upon the choice of grounds, and the best processes for the\r\npreparation and manipulation of the leaves. This book, the fruit of\r\nmany years of experience and care given to the subject, has been well\r\nreceived by the cultivators who devote themselves to this branch of\r\nindustry. If, by means of careful experiments and experience, the\r\ngovernment succeed in conferring on the island of Java this important\r\nbranch of commerce, she may hope to obtain brilliant results; at all\r\nevents, it will open to the country a new source of prosperity and\r\nriches.\r\n\r\nAn interesting account of the tea plants, and the manufacture of tea,\r\nwill be found in Fortune's \"Wanderings in China,\" in Ball's \"Account\r\nof the Cultivation and Manufacture of Tea,\" Boyle's \"Illustrations of\r\nHimalayan Botany,\" and his \"Productive Resources of India.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Fortune's \"Travels\" I take the following extract:--\r\n\r\n    \"There are few subjects connected with the vegetable kingdom which\r\n    have attracted such a large share of public notice as the tea-plant\r\n    of China. Its cultivation on the Chinese hills, the particular\r\n    species of variety which produces the black and green teas of\r\n    commerce, and the method of preparing the leaves, have always been\r\n    objects of peculiar interest. The jealousy of the Chinese government\r\n    in former times, prevented foreigners from visiting any of the\r\n    districts where tea is cultivated; and the information derived from\r\n    the Chinese merchants, even scanty as it was, was not to be depended\r\n    upon. And hence we find our English authors contradicting each\r\n    other; some asserting that the black and green teas are produced by\r\n    the same variety, and that the difference in colour is the result of\r\n    a different mode of preparation; while others say that the black\r\n    teas are produced from the plant called by botanists _Thea Bohea_,\r\n    and the green from _Thea viridis_, both of which we have had for\r\n    many years in our gardens in England. During my travels in China\r\n    since the last war, I have had frequent opportunities of inspecting\r\n    some extensive tea districts in the black and green tea countries of\r\n    Canton, Fokien, and Chekiang: the result of these observations is\r\n    now laid before the reader. It will prove that even those who have\r\n    had the best means of judging have been deceived, and that the\r\n    greater part of the black and green teas which are brought yearly\r\n    from China to Europe and America are obtained from the same species\r\n    or variety, namely, from the _Thea viridis_. Dried specimens of this\r\n    plant were prepared in the districts I have named, by myself, and\r\n    are now in the herbarium of the Horticultural Society of London, so\r\n    that there can be no longer any doubt upon the subject. In various\r\n    parts of the Canton provinces where I have had an opportunity of\r\n    seeing tea cultivated, the species proved to be the _Thea Bohea_, or\r\n    what is commonly called the black tea plant. In the green tea\r\n    districts of the north--I allude more particularly to the province\r\n    of Chekiang--I never met with a single plant of this species, which\r\n    is so common in the fields and gardens near Canton. All the plants\r\n    in the green tea country near Ningpo, on the islands of the Chusan\r\n    Archipelago, and in every part of the province which I have had an\r\n    opportunity of visiting, proved, without an exception, to be _Thea\r\n    viridis_. Two hundred miles further to the north-west, in the\r\n    province of Kiangnan, and only a short distance from the tea hills\r\n    in that quarter, I also found in gardens the same species of tea.\r\n    Thus far my actual observations exactly verified the opinions I had\r\n    formed on the subject before I left England, viz: that the black\r\n    teas were prepared from the _Thea Bohea_, and the green from _Thea\r\n    viridis_. When I left the north, on my way to the city of\r\n    Foo-chow-foo, on the river Min, in the province Fokien, I had no\r\n    doubt that I should find the tea hills there covered with the other\r\n    species, _Thea Bohea_, from which we generally suppose the black\r\n    teas are made; and this was the more likely to be the case as this\r\n    species actually derives its specific name from the Bohea hills in\r\n    this province. Great was my surprise to find all the plants on the\r\n    tea hills near Foo-chow exactly the same as those in the green tea\r\n    districts of the north. Here were, then, green tea plantations on\r\n    the black tea hills, and not a single plant of the _Thea Bohea_ to\r\n    be seen. Moreover, at the time of my visit, the natives were busily\r\n    employed in the manufacture of black teas. Although the specific\r\n    differences of the tea plant were well known to me, I was so much\r\n    surprised, and I may add amused, at this discovery, that I procured\r\n    a set of specimens for the herbarium, and also dug up a living\r\n    plant, which I took northward to Chekiang. On comparing it with\r\n    those which grow on the green tea hills, no difference whatever was\r\n    observed. It appears, therefore, that the black and green teas of\r\n    the northern districts of China (those districts in which the\r\n    greater part of the teas for the foreign market are made) are both\r\n    produced from the same variety, and that that variety is the _Thea\r\n    viridis_, or what is commonly called green tea plant. On the other\r\n    hand those black and green teas which are manufactured in\r\n    considerable quantities in the vicinity of Canton, are obtained\r\n    from the _Thea Bohea_, or black tea.\r\n\r\n    In the green tea districts of Chekiang, near Ningpo, the first crop\r\n    of leaves is generally gathered about the middle of April. This\r\n    consists of the young leaf buds just as they begin to unfold, and\r\n    forms a fine and delicate kind of young hyson, which is held in high\r\n    estimation by the natives, and is generally sent about in small\r\n    quantities as presents to their friends. It is a scarce and\r\n    expensive article, and the picking off the leaves in such a young\r\n    state does considerable injury to the tea plantation. The summer\r\n    rains, however, which fall copiously about this season, moisten the\r\n    earth and air; and if the plants are young and vigorous, they soon\r\n    push out fresh leaves. In a fortnight or three weeks from the time\r\n    of the first picking, the shrubs are again covered with fresh\r\n    leaves, and are ready for the second gathering, which is the most\r\n    important of the season. The third and last gathering, which takes\r\n    place as soon as new leaves are formed, produces a very inferior\r\n    kind of tea, which is rarely sent out of the district. The mode of\r\n    gathering and preparing the leaves of the tea plant is very simple.\r\n    We have been so long accustomed to magnify and mystify everything\r\n    relating to the Chinese, that in all their arts and manufactures we\r\n    expect to find some peculiar practice, when the fact is, that many\r\n    operations in China are more simple in their character than in most\r\n    parts of the world. To rightly understand the process of rolling and\r\n    drying the leaves, which I am about to describe, it must be borne in\r\n    mind that the grand object is to expel the moisture, and at the same\r\n    time to retain as much as possible of the aromatic and other\r\n    desirable secretions of the species. The system adopted to attain\r\n    this end is as simple as it is efficacious. In the harvest seasons,\r\n    the natives are seen in little family groups on the side of every\r\n    hill, when the weather is dry, engaged in gathering tea leaves. They\r\n    do not seem so particular as I imagined they would have been in this\r\n    operation, but strip the leaves off rapidly and promiscuously, and\r\n    throw them all into round baskets, made for the purpose out of split\r\n    bamboo or ratan. In the beginning of May, when the principal\r\n    gathering takes place, the young seed-vessels are about as large as\r\n    peas. These are also stripped off and mixed with the leaves; it is\r\n    these seed-vessels which we often see in our tea, and which has some\r\n    slight resemblance to capers. When a sufficient quantity of leaves\r\n    are gathered, they are carried home to the cottage or barn, where\r\n    the operation of drying is performed.\"\r\n\r\nThis is minutely described, and the author continues:--\r\n\r\n    \"I have stated that the plants grown in the districts of Chekiang\r\n    produce green teas, but it must not be supposed that they are the\r\n    green teas which are exported to England. The leaf has a much more\r\n    natural color, and has little or none of what we call the 'beautiful\r\n    bloom' upon it, which is so much admired in Europe and America.\r\n    There is now no doubt that all these 'blooming' green teas, which\r\n    are manufactured at Canton, are dyed with Prussian blue and gypsum,\r\n    to suit the taste of the foreign 'barbarians;' indeed the process\r\n    may be seen any day, during the season, by those who give themselves\r\n    the trouble to seek after it. It is very likely that the same\r\n    ingredients are also used in dyeing the northern green teas for the\r\n    foreign market; of this, however, I am not quite certain. There is a\r\n    vegetable dye obtained from _Isatis indigotica_ much used in the\r\n    northern districts, and called _Teinsing_; and it is not unlikely\r\n    that it may be the substance which is employed. The Chinese never\r\n    use these dyed teas themselves, and I certainly think their taste in\r\n    this respect is more correct than ours. It is not to be supposed\r\n    that the dye used can produce any very bad effects on the consumer,\r\n    for, had this been the case, it would have been discovered before\r\n    now; but if entirely harmless or inert, its being so must be\r\n    ascribed to the very small quantity which is employed in the\r\n    manufacture.\"\r\n\r\nIn short, the black and green teas which are generally exported to\r\nEngland and the United States from the northern provinces of China,\r\nare made from the same species; and the difference of color, flavor,\r\n&c., is solely the result of the different modes of preparation.\r\n\r\nI shall make an extract, also, from Williams's \"Middle Kingdom:\"--\r\n\r\n    \"The native names given to the various sorts of tea are derived for\r\n    the most part from their appearance or place of growth; the names of\r\n    many of the best kinds are not commonly known abroad. _Bohea_ is the\r\n    name of the Wu-i hills, (or Bu-i, as the people on the spot call\r\n    them,) where the tea is grown, and not a term for a particular sort\r\n    among the Chinese, though it is applied to a very poor kind of black\r\n    tea at Canton. _Sunglo_ is likewise a general term for the green\r\n    teas produced on the hills in Kiangsu. The names of the principal\r\n    varieties of black tea are as follows: _Pecco_, 'white hairs,' so\r\n    called from the whitish down on the leaves, is one of the choicest\r\n    kinds, and has a peculiar taste; _Orange Pecco_, called _shang\r\n    hiang_, or 'most fragrant,' differs from it slightly; _Hungmuey_,\r\n    'red plum blossoms,' has a slightly reddish tinge; the terms\r\n    _prince's eyebrows_, _carnation hair_, _lotus kernel_, _sparrow's\r\n    tongue_, _fir-leaf pattern_, _dragon's pellet_, and _dragon's\r\n    whiskers_, are all translations of the native names of different\r\n    kinds of Souchong or Pecco. _Souchong_, or _siau chung_, means\r\n    _little plant_ or sort, as _Pouchong_, or _folded sort_, refers to\r\n    the mode of packing it; _Campoi_ is corrupted from _kan pei_ i.e.\r\n    carefully fired; _Chulan_ is the tea scented with the chulan flower,\r\n    and applied to some kinds of scented green tea. The names of green\r\n    teas are less numerous: _Gunpowder_, or _ma chu_, i.e. hemp pearl,\r\n    derives its name from the form into which the leaves are rolled; _ta\r\n    chu_ or 'great pearl,' and _chu lan_, or 'pearl flower,' denote two\r\n    kinds of _Imperial_; _Hyson_, or _yu tsien_, i.e. before the rains,\r\n    originally denoted the tenderest leaves of the plant, and is now\r\n    applied to _Young Hyson_; as is also another name, _mei pein_, or\r\n    'plum petals;' while _hi chun_, 'flourishing spring,' describes\r\n    _Hyson_; _Twankay_ is the name of a stream in Chehkiang, where this\r\n    sort is produced; and _Hyson skin_, or _pi cha_, i.e. skin tea, is\r\n    the poorest kind, the siftings of the other varieties; _Oolung_,\r\n    'black dragon,' is a kind of black tea with green flavor. Ankoi teas\r\n    are produced in the district of Ngankí, not far from Tsiuenchau fu,\r\n    possessing a peculiar taste, supposed to be owing to the ferruginous\r\n    nature of the soil. De Guignes speaks of the Pu-'rh tea, from the\r\n    place in Kiangsu where it grows, and says it is cured from wild\r\n    plants found there; the infusion is unpleasant, and is used for\r\n    medical purposes. The Mongols and others in the west of China\r\n    prepare tea by pressing it, when fresh, into cakes like bricks, and\r\n    thoroughly drying it in that shape to carry in their wanderings.\r\n\r\n    \"Considering the enormous labor of preparing tea, it is surprising\r\n    that even the poorest kind can be afforded to the foreign purchaser\r\n    at Canton, more than a thousand miles from the place of its growth,\r\n    for 9d. and less a pound; and in their ability to furnish it at this\r\n    rate, the Chinese have a security of retaining the trade in their\r\n    hands, notwithstanding the efforts to grow the plant elsewhere.\r\n    Comparatively little adulteration is practised, if the amount used\r\n    at home and abroad be considered, though the temptation is great, as\r\n    the infusion of other plants is drunk instead of the true tea. The\r\n    poorer natives substitute the leaves of a species of Rhamnus or\r\n    Fallopia, which they dry; Camellia leaves are perhaps mixed up with\r\n    it, but probably to no great extent. The refuse of packing-houses is\r\n    sold to the poor at a low rate, under the name of tea endings and\r\n    tea bones; and if a few of the rarest sorts do not go abroad,\r\n    neither do the poorest. It is a necessary of life to all classes of\r\n    Chinese, and that its use is not injurious is abundantly evident\r\n    from its general acceptance and extending adoption; and the\r\n    prejudice against it among some out of China may be attributed\r\n    chiefly to the use of strong green tea, which is no doubt\r\n    prejudicial. If those who have given it up on this account will\r\n    adopt a weaker infusion of black tea, general experience is proof\r\n    that it will do them no great harm, and they may be sure that they\r\n    will not be deceived by a colored article; Neither the Chinese nor\r\n    Japanese use milk or sugar in their tea, and the peculiar taste and\r\n    aroma of the infusion is much better perceived without those\r\n    additions; nor can it be drunk so strong without tasting an\r\n    unpleasant bitterness, which the milk partly hides. The Japanese\r\n    sometimes reduce the leaves to a powder, and pour boiling water\r\n    through them in a cullender, in the same way that coffee is often\r\n    made.\"\r\n\r\nThe following valuable details as to the cultivation and manufacture\r\nof tea in British India, are from interesting reports by Dr. Jameson,\r\nSuperintendent of the Company's Botanical Gardens in the North West\r\nProvinces, published in 1847 in the Journal of the Agricultural and\r\nHorticultural Society of Calcutta;--and from Mr. Robert Fortune's\r\nreport to the Hon. East India Company:--\r\n\r\n    _The quantity manufactured_.--The quantity of tea manufactured from\r\n    five plantations, of 89 acres in all, amounted in 1845 to 610 lb. 2\r\n    oz., and in 1846, on 115 acres, to l,023 lb. ll oz. The small\r\n    nursery of Lutchmisser, consisting of three acres of land, gave a\r\n    return in 1845 of 216 lb., or 2 maunds and 56 pounds; in 1846 the\r\n    return was 272 lbs., or 3 maunds and 32 pounds.\r\n\r\n    The small plantation of Kuppeena, established in 1841-2, and then\r\n    consisting of three acres (but increased in 1844 to four), yielded\r\n    in 1845, 1 maund and 56 pounds, and in 1846, 2 maunds and 56 pounds.\r\n    Thus we have received from a plantation of only five years'\r\n    formation, and of four acres (one of these recently added), upwards\r\n    of 2½ maunds of tea, and from another, Lutchmisser, of three acres,\r\n    which was established in 1835-6, 3 maunds and 30 pounds, equal to\r\n    272 pounds. I have, in a former report, asserted that the minimum\r\n    return of tea for an acre of land may be estimated at 1 pucka maund,\r\n    or 80 lb. The only plantations that I can as yet bring forward in\r\n    favour of my assertion, are the two above-mentioned: Kuppeena has\r\n    not yielded the proportion mentioned, but it was only established in\r\n    1841-42, and the tea-plants do not come into full bearing until the\r\n    eighth year; on the other hand, Lutchmisser has given more than the\r\n    average return. I think, therefore, that the returns already yielded\r\n    are highly favorable, and that though the data are small, they are\r\n    very satisfactory.\r\n\r\n    _Soil best adapted for the tea-plant_.--The soil in which the\r\n    tea-plant is now thriving in the Himalayas and in the valley of\r\n    Deyrah Dhoon, varies exceedingly. At Bhurtpoor and Russiah it is of\r\n    a light silico-aluminous nature, and abounding with small pieces of\r\n    clay slate, which is the subjacent rock, and trap (green-stone),\r\n    which occurs in large dykes, cutting through and altering the strata\r\n    of clay slate; mixed with the stony soil, there is a small quantity\r\n    of vegetable matter. The clay slate is metamorphic, being almost\r\n    entirely composed of mica. In some places it is mixed with quartz,\r\n    forming mica slate. From the decomposition of these rocks, mixed\r\n    with a small quantity of vegetable matter, the soil is formed. At\r\n    Kuppeena and Lutchmisser, the soil is also very stony, formed from\r\n    the decomposition of clay slate, which, in many places, as at\r\n    Russiah and Bhurtpoor, passes into mica slate, or alternates with\r\n    it, and a little vegetable matter. The same remark applies to the\r\n    plantations of Guddowli, Kouth, and Rumaserai. At Huwalbaugh part of\r\n    the soil consists of a stiff clay, of a reddish-yellow colour, owing\r\n    to peroxide of iron. Here, too, the tea-plants, provided that the\r\n    ground around them is occasionally opened up, thrive well. In Mr.\r\n    Lushington's garden at Lobha, in Kumaon, and in Assistant\r\n    Commissioner Captain H. Ramsay's garden at Pooree, in Gurwahl,\r\n    plants are thriving well in a rich, black, vegetable mould. The soil\r\n    in the Deyrah Dhoon varies exceedingly from clayey and stiff soil to\r\n    sand and gravelly soil, or light and free. The soil at Kaolagir is a\r\n    compound of the two, neither clayey, nor free, nor light soil, but\r\n    composed partly of clay and sand, mixed with vegetable mould, and in\r\n    some places mixed with much gravel, consisting of limestone, marl,\r\n    sandstone, clay slate, and quartz rock, or of such rocks as enter\r\n    into the composition of the surrounding ranges of mountains, viz.,\r\n    the Sewalick range to the south, and the Himalayas, properly so\r\n    called, to the north, From the above statement, we find that the\r\n    tea-plant thrives well both in stiff and free soils, and in many\r\n    modifications of these. But the soil which seems best adapted to its\r\n    growth may be styled free soil, as at Russiah, or a mixture of both,\r\n    as at Kaolagir, in the Deyrah Dhoon.\r\n\r\n    In limestone districts, where the tea has been tried, if the\r\n    super-imposed soil has been thin and untransported, and this proved\r\n    from the decomposition of the subjacent rock, the plant has\r\n    generally failed; and this has been particularly the case where the\r\n    limestone, by plutonic action, has become metamorphic. These\r\n    districts, therefore, in forming plantations, are to be avoided.\r\n\r\n    From the writings of various authors, it appears that the districts\r\n    where the tea-plant thrives best in China, have a geological\r\n    structure very similar to that met with in many parts of the\r\n    Himalayas, being composed of primitive and transition rocks.\r\n\r\n    _Altitude above the sea best suited to the tea plant_.--To state\r\n    what altitude is best adapted to the growth of the tea-plant, and\r\n    for the production of the best kinds of tea, will require much more\r\n    observation. At present the tea-plant thrives equally well at\r\n    Kaolagir, in the Deyrah Dhoon; at Russiah, in the Chikata district;\r\n    at Huwalbaugh; at Kuppeena and Lutchmisser; and at Rumaserai, or at\r\n    heights ranging from 2,200 feet above the level of the sea to 6,000\r\n    feet.\r\n\r\n    Moreover, the tea manufactured from leaves procured from Kaolagir,\r\n    has been considered by the London brokers equal to that made from\r\n    leaves procured from Lutchmisser and Kuppeena.\r\n\r\n    _On the method of preparing ground prior to forming a\r\n    plantation_.--In forming a plantation, the first object of\r\n    attention, both in the hills and in the Deyrah Dhoon, is a _fence_.\r\n    In the former, to prevent the depredations of wild animals, such as\r\n    wild hog, deer, &c., which abound in the hills, and though they do\r\n    not eat tea leaves, yet hogs, in search of tubers, in the space of a\r\n    single night will do much damage by uprooting young shrubs--in the\r\n    latter, to prevent the straying of cattle. The first thing to be\r\n    done, therefore, is to dig a trench three feet broad and two deep,\r\n    and to plant a hedge, if in the hills, of black thorn (_Cratoegus_);\r\n    if in the plains, the different species of aloe are best adapted for\r\n    the purpose. The fence being formed, all trees and shrubs are then\r\n    to be uprooted; this is very heavy work, both in the hills and\r\n    plains, from the vast number of shrubs, allowed by natives (from\r\n    indolence to remove them) to grow everywhere throughout their\r\n    fields. Roads are then to be marked off.\r\n\r\n    After this has been accomplished, the land is to be drained, if\r\n    necessary, by open drains--under drainage, for want of means and the\r\n    expense, being impracticable--and then ploughed three or four times\r\n    over. The beds for young tea-plants are then to be formed; these\r\n    ought to be three feet in breadth, alternating with a pathway of two\r\n    feet in breadth. By arranging beds in this manner much time and\r\n    labour is saved in transplanting; in irrigation the water is\r\n    economised, and in plucking tea leaves a road is given to the\r\n    gatherer. In transplanting, each plant is allowed 4½ feet; this is\r\n    at once gained, the beds and pathways being formed by placing in one\r\n    direction the plant in the centre of the bed.\r\n\r\n    _Trenching_.--On the tea beds being marked off, they are to be\r\n    trenched to a depth of from two to three feet, in order to destroy\r\n    all the roots of weeds, which are to be carefully removed. The\r\n    trenching is to be performed by the _fowrah_, or Indian spade.\r\n\r\n    In the hills, in many places the _fowrah_ cannot be used, owing to\r\n    the number of stones. The work is then to be done by the _koatlah_,\r\n    a flat-pointed piece of iron, of about eight inches in length, which\r\n    is inserted into a wooden handle. It is in form like the pick, and\r\n    is much used in hill cultivation for weeding and opening up the\r\n    ground. It is, however, not much to be commended for trenching\r\n    purposes, as natives, in using it, never penetrate the ground beyond\r\n    a few inches. For weeding, however, it is particularly useful, and\r\n    to such soil is much better adapted than most other implements.\r\n\r\n    _Formation of roads and paths_.--In addition to the pathways of two\r\n    feet in breadth, recommended to be formed between each bed, there\r\n    ought, for general use, to be a four feet road carried round the\r\n    plantation, and one of 10 feet through the centre. This applies to a\r\n    limited plantation, that is, of from 200 to 400 acres. If, on the\r\n    other hand, it was on a more extensive scale, several hackery roads\r\n    of 10 feet in breadth would be necessary, in order to cart away\r\n    weeds, &c., or carry manure to seedling beds.\r\n\r\n    _On seeds when ripe, and method to be adopted to ascertain it_.--In\r\n    all September and October the tea seeds ripen, but in the more\r\n    elevated plantations, as at Rumaserai, many do not ripen until\r\n    November. The seeds are contained in a capsule, and vary in number\r\n    from one to seven; to ascertain that they are ripe, open the\r\n    capsule, although green, and if their color is a nut-brown, they are\r\n    sure to be so. If they are not ripe, they are of a reddish-brown\r\n    above, mixed with white. If the seeds are allowed to remain a short\r\n    time on the bushes, after they are ripe, the capsules burst, and\r\n    they fall out; it is necessary, therefore, to remove them before\r\n    this takes place.\r\n\r\n    _On the method of sowing seeds, and season, and on the treatment of\r\n    the young tea plants after they have germinated_.--The ground having\r\n    been first well trenched and manured, that is, from sixty to seventy\r\n    maunds of manure given to the acre, the seeds are, when ripe, to be\r\n    removed from the capsules, and immediately sown to the depth of one\r\n    inch, and very close, in drills 8 to 10 inches apart from each\r\n    other. The sooner that they are sown after being removed from the\r\n    capsules the better, as their germinating properties are apt to be\r\n    destroyed if they are kept for any length of time. Some germinate in\r\n    the space of a few weeks, others lie dormant until February and\r\n    March, and others do not germinate until the rains.\r\n\r\n    The method of sowing seeds in China is thus described, being similar\r\n    to the native plan of sowing mangoes in India. \"Several seeds are\r\n    dropped into holes four or five inches deep and three or four feet\r\n    apart, shortly after they ripen, or in November and December; the\r\n    plants rise up in a cluster when the rains come on. They are seldom\r\n    transplanted, but sometimes four to six are put quite close to form\r\n    a fine bush.\"[9] By this method nothing is gained, and the\r\n    expenditure of seeds great.\r\n\r\n    If the plants germinate in November, which, as already stated, many\r\n    do, they ought to be covered with a _chupper_ made of bamboo and\r\n    grass.\r\n\r\n    In the hills, everywhere at an elevation of 6,000 and 7,000 feet,\r\n    the ringal, a small kind of bamboo, of which there are several\r\n    species, is found in great abundance, and well adapted for the\r\n    purpose, and in the Deyrah Dhoon the bamboo occurs in vast quantity;\r\n    the market of the Upper Provinces being chiefly supplied from that\r\n    valley and other forests at the base of the Himalayas. Bamboos are\r\n    also met with to the height of six and seven thousand feet on the\r\n    Himalayas in the neighbourhood of Almorah. During the day, in the\r\n    cold weather, the _chuppers_ ought to be removed, and again replaced\r\n    at night; as the weather becomes hot, it is necessary to protect the\r\n    young plants from the heat of the sun, that is, in April and May,\r\n    and until the rains commence; the _chuppers_ at this time ought to\r\n    be put on about eight a.m., and removed again about four p.m.\r\n\r\n    _Method of rearing plantations by layers, and by cuttings_.--The\r\n    best season for laying down is when the sap is dormant, or in cold\r\n    weather; or when in full action, as in the rains. \"Laying,\" as\r\n    expressed by Dr. Lindley, \"is nothing but striking from cuttings,\r\n    which are still allowed to maintain their connection with the mother\r\n    plant by means of a portion of their stem.\" There are various\r\n    methods of making layers, but the most simple and efficient is to\r\n    bend down a branch, and sink it into the earth after having made a\r\n    slit or notch in the centre of the embedded portion. By so doing,\r\n    the descent of the sap is retarded, and thus the formation of\r\n    radicles or young roots is promoted; about five or six inches or\r\n    more, of the branch, is to be allowed to remain above ground, and in\r\n    a position as perpendicular to the point where the plant is notched\r\n    as possible. In three or four mouths these layers are ready to be\r\n    removed and transplanted; the removal of the layers is to be\r\n    gradual, that is, they ought first to be cut half through, then a\r\n    little more, and finally altogether separated.\r\n\r\n    The best season for propagating by cuttings is the cold weather,\r\n    that is, from November to February; they may also be propagated,\r\n    though not with the same success, during the rains; it is necessary\r\n    to protect them against frost in the cold weather, and from the rays\r\n    of the sun in the hot. Cuttings put in during the cold weather are\r\n    ready to transplant in the rains, and if put in during the rains,\r\n    they are generally fit for removal in February.\r\n\r\n    _On the method of transplanting and season_.--In transplanting young\r\n    tea-plants care should be taken to lift them with a good large ball\r\n    of earth attached to their roots, as they throw out a long central\r\n    or tap root, which, if cut through, invariably destroys the plant.\r\n    On being placed in the ground, the earth around them is to be well\r\n    pressed down and watered; the watering is to be continued every\r\n    third or fourth day, until the plants have taken hold of the ground.\r\n    During the rains, grass springs up with great rapidity, so as to\r\n    render it impossible for one man to keep three acres (the quantity\r\n    assigned by us) clean. This, however, is not necessary, if care be\r\n    taken to make a golah round each plant, and keep it clear of weeds;\r\n    these golahs ought always, in hill plantations where the ground is\r\n    irregular, to be connected by small _khauls_ or channels, in order\r\n    to make irrigation easy; by so doing too, water, if the supply be\r\n    scanty, which often happens in the hills in the hot weather, will be\r\n    economised.\r\n\r\n               +-----------------------------------------+\r\n               |  b                                   b  |\r\n               |         a          a          a         | a Tea plant.\r\n  Thus--       |         X----------X----------X         | b Bed\r\n               |              c          c               | c Watercourse\r\n               |  b                                   b  |\r\n               +-----------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n    We have already stated that 4½ square feet ought to be assigned to\r\n    each plant. In China, according to Professor Royle, three to four\r\n    feet are given; this, however, is too small a space to allow the\r\n    plant to grow freely. After the tea plants are transplanted, it is\r\n    not necessary to protect them.\r\n\r\n    The best seasons for transplanting are towards the end of February,\r\n    or as soon as the frost has ceased, and throughout March, and during\r\n    the rains, and until the end or middle of November, depending on the\r\n    season.\r\n\r\n    In transplanting, four parties ought to be employed; viz., one\r\n    person to dig holes, a second to remove plants, a third to carry\r\n    them to the ground where they are required, and a fourth to plant.\r\n    By this means, not only time is saved, but the plants have a much\r\n    better chance, when thus treated, of doing well. When the seedling\r\n    beds are extensive, so many of the plants ought not to be removed,\r\n    that is, a plant left every 4½ feet, and these beds added to the\r\n    plantation.\r\n\r\n    _On pruning, best season and mode_.--The plants do not require to be\r\n    pruned until the fifth year, as the plucking of leaves generally\r\n    tends to make the plants assume the basket shape, the form most to\r\n    be desired to procure the greatest quantity of leaves; if, however,\r\n    the plants show a tendency to run into weed, from central branches\r\n    being thrown out, this ought to be checked by removing the central\r\n    stem. In the fourth year a quantity of the old and hard wood ought\r\n    to be removed, to induce the plants to throw out more branches. The\r\n    best season for pruning is from November to March.\r\n\r\n    _On irrigation_.--To keep the tea-plants healthy, irrigation for two\r\n    or three years is absolutely necessary, and no land ought to be\r\n    selected for a tea plantation which cannot be irrigated.\r\n\r\n    On the other hand, land liable to be flooded during the rains, and\r\n    upon which water lies for any length of time, is equally detrimental\r\n    to the growth of the plant. This applies to a small portion of the\r\n    Kooasur plantation, which receives the drainage of the adjoining\r\n    hills, and the soil being retentive, keeps the water. Deep trenches\r\n    have been dug in order to drain it off--these, however, owing to the\r\n    lowness of the surrounding country, act badly. Three successive\r\n    seasons plants have been put into the ground, and as often have been\r\n    destroyed on the setting in of the rains, showing the necessity of\r\n    avoiding such kind of land for tea plantation.\r\n\r\n    To facilitate irrigation, &c., as already stated, in the Deyrah\r\n    Dhoon, I have limited the tea beds to three feet in breadth. This is\r\n    particularly requisite in land so constituted as that of the Deyrah\r\n    Dhoon, it being so porous, as mentioned by Major Cautley in his\r\n    \"Notes and Memoranda of Watercourses.\" This is caused by the\r\n    superincumbent soil not being more than from one to three feet\r\n    thick, in some places more, but varying exceedingly. Beneath this\r\n    there is a bed of shingle of vast thickness, through which the water\r\n    percolates; it is this that renders the sinking of wells so\r\n    difficult in the Deyrah Dhoon, and which has tended so much to\r\n    retard individuals from becoming permanent residents; at present\r\n    there are many tracts of several thousand acres in that valley\r\n    unoccupied from want of drinking water, as for instance, at\r\n    Innesphaeel.\r\n\r\n    Where the ground is very uneven, as is the case generally in the\r\n    hills, the _khaul_ system, already recommended, ought to be adopted.\r\n\r\n    _On the tea-plant; season of flowering, its characters and species,\r\n    and on the advantages to be derived from importing seeds from\r\n    China_.--From the importance of tea, as an article of commerce, the\r\n    plant has attracted much attention; and from few qualified Europeans\r\n    having travelled in the tea districts of China, there is much\r\n    difference of opinion as to the number of species belonging to the\r\n    genus Thea.\r\n\r\n    In the government plantations in Kumaon and Gurwahl, the plants\r\n    begin to flower about the end of August and beginning of September,\r\n    or, as the seeds of the former year begin to ripen. They do not all\r\n    come into flower at once, but some are in full blossom in September,\r\n    others in October, November, December and January. Some throw out a\r\n    second set of blossoms in March, April, and May, and during the\r\n    rains; so that from the same plant unripe or ripe seeds and flowers\r\n    may be collected at one and the same time.\r\n\r\n    To the genus Thea, which belongs to the order Ternstræmiaceæ, the\r\n    following characters have been ascribed: calyx persistent, without\r\n    bracts, five-leaved, leaflets imbricated and generally of the same\r\n    size. Petals of the corolla vary in number from five to nine,\r\n    imbricated, the inner ones much the largest. Stamens numerous, in\r\n    several rows adhering to the bottom of the petals. Filaments\r\n    filiform. Anthers incumbent, two-celled, oblong, with a thickish\r\n    connectivum. Cells opening longitudinally. Ovary free, three-celled;\r\n    ovules four in each cell, inserted internally into the central\r\n    angle, the upper ones ascending, the lower pendulous. Style trifid,\r\n    stigmas three, acute. Capsule spheroidal, 1-7-lobed with loculicidal\r\n    dehiscence, or with dessepiments formed from the turned-in edges of\r\n    the valves. Seeds solitary, or two in cells, shell-like testa,\r\n    marked with the ventral umbilicus. Cotyledons thick, fleshy, oily,\r\n    no albumen. Radicle very short, very near the umbilicus centripetal.\r\n    In the plantations there are two species, and two well marked\r\n    varieties.\r\n\r\n    The first is characterised by the leaves being of a pale-green\r\n    colour, thin, almost membraneous, broad lanceolate, sinatures or\r\n    edge irregular and reversed, length from three to six inches. The\r\n    color of the stem of newly-formed shoots is of a pale-reddish\r\n    colour, and green towards the end. This species is also marked by\r\n    its strong growth, its erect stem, and the shoots being generally\r\n    upright and stiff. The flowers are small, and its seeds but sparing.\r\n\r\n    In its characters this plant, received from Assam, agrees in part\r\n    with those assigned by Dr. Lettsom and Sir W. Hooker to the _Thea\r\n    viridis_, but differs in its branches being stiff and erect. The\r\n    flowers small, or rather much about the same size as the species\r\n    about to be described, and not confined to the upper axils of the\r\n    plant, and solitary, as stated by them.[10] By the Chinese\r\n    manufacturers it is considered an inferior plant for making tea, it\r\n    is not therefore grown to any extent.\r\n\r\n    The second species is characterised by its leaves being much\r\n    smaller, and not so broadly lanceolate; slightly waved, of a\r\n    dark-green color, thick and coriaceous, sinature or edge irregular,\r\n    length from one to three inches and a half. In its growth it is much\r\n    smaller than the former, and throws out numerous spreading branches,\r\n    and seldom presents its marked leading stem. This species,\r\n    therefore, in the above characters, agrees much with those that have\r\n    been assigned to _Thea Bohea_ by authors. The characters have been\r\n    mixed up in an extraordinary manner. Thus it has been stated, that\r\n    the _Thea viridis_ has large, strong growing, and spreading\r\n    branches, and that _Thea Bohea_ is a smaller plant, with branches\r\n    stiff and straight, and stem erect. No doubt the _Thea viridis_ is a\r\n    much larger and stronger growing plant than the _Thea Bohea_, or\r\n    rather the plant now existing in the different plantations is so;\r\n    but in the former the branches are stiff and erect, and in the\r\n    latter inclined and branches. The marked distinguishing characters\r\n    between the two species are the coriaceous dark-green leaves in the\r\n    _Thea Bohea_, and the large pale-green monhanæous leaves of the\r\n    _Thea viridis_. The manner, too, of growth is very striking, and on\r\n    entering the plantation the distinction is at once marked to the\r\n    most unobservant eye. This species of _Thea Bohea_ forms nearly the\r\n    whole of the plantations, and was brought from China by Dr. Gordon.\r\n\r\n    In the plantations there is a third plant, which, however, can only\r\n    be considered a marked variety of _Thea Bohea_. Its leaves are\r\n    thick, coriaceous, and of dark-green color, but invariably very\r\n    small, and not exceeding two inches in length, and thinly\r\n    lanceolate; the serratures, too, on the edge, which are straight,\r\n    are not so deep. In other characters it is identical. This marked\r\n    variety was received from Calcutta at the plantation in a separate\r\n    despatch from the others.\r\n\r\n    But in addition to these there are, no doubt, many more varieties,\r\n    and though it may be a fact that, in certain districts, green tea is\r\n    manufactured from a species differing from that from which black tea\r\n    is manufactured, yet, in other districts, green and black teas are\r\n    manufactured from one and the same plant. The Chinese manufacturers\r\n    now in Kumaon state that the plant is one and the same, and that it\r\n    can be proved by converting black tea into green. In manufacturing\r\n    teas now in the manufactory, if a large quantity of leaves are\r\n    brought in from the plantations, one half are converted into green,\r\n    and one half into black tea. This only shows that much of the green\r\n    and black teas of commerce are manufactured from one and the same\r\n    plant. The Assam plant is, from the characters given, quite a\r\n    distinct plant, and agrees, as already stated, most nearly with the\r\n    species described as _Thea viridis_. It would, therefore, be most\r\n    desirable to procure seeds of this so-called species, and also of\r\n    other varieties, of which, no doubt, there is a great variety. From\r\n    the northern districts of China in particular, seeds ought to be\r\n    imported, not, however, in large quantities, but in quantities of\r\n    two or three seers, so that they might, on arrival at Calcutta, be\r\n    sent up the country as quickly as possible, for, if the seeds are\r\n    kept long out of the ground, not one will germinate; such was the\r\n    fate of all the seeds contained in ten boxes imported by government\r\n    in 1845, not one having germinated, which was much to be regretted.\r\n    Had they been sent in small parcels, well packed in wax cloth, to\r\n    prevent them from being injured by moisture, and placed in an airy\r\n    part of the vessel in transmission from China to Calcutta, and, on\r\n    arrival there, sent by dâwk banghay direct to the plantation, they\r\n    would, I am confident, have reached in good condition. It is well\r\n    worthy of a trial and seeds ought, if possible, to be obtained from\r\n    every district celebrated for its teas. It is in this manner, by\r\n    obtaining seeds of the finest varieties of plants, that the finest\r\n    teas will be procured. I do not mean to infer that the tea plants\r\n    now under cultivation are not the produce of fine varieties, for\r\n    that has been proved by the undoubted testimony of the London\r\n    brokers, but only that there are, no doubt, many others well worthy\r\n    of introduction. In confirmation of what I have stated, I may quote\r\n    the words of my late friend Dr. Griffith, who, in his report on the\r\n    tea plant of Assam, says--\"I now come to the consideration of the\r\n    steps which, in my opinion, must be followed if any degree of\r\n    success in the cultivation of tea is to be expected; of these the\r\n    most important is the importation of Chinese seeds of\r\n    unexceptionable quality, and of small numbers of their sorts.\"[11]\r\n    Dr. Royle, too, who was the first person to point out that the\r\n    Himalayas were well adapted to tea cultivation, and to whom the\r\n    credit of recommending to government the introduction of the plant\r\n    into Northern India is due, strongly urges the necessity of\r\n    importing seeds from different localities in China celebrated for\r\n    their teas.\r\n\r\n    _Method and season for plucking and gathering leaves_.--The season\r\n    for picking leaves commences in April and continues until October.\r\n    The number of gatherings varies, depending on the moisture[12] or\r\n    dryness of the season. If the season be good, as many as seven\r\n    gatherings may be obtained. If, however, the rains are partial, only\r\n    four or five. These, however, may be reduced to their general\r\n    periods for gathering--that is, from April to June, from July to\r\n    15th August, and from September to the end of October. But few\r\n    leaves are collected after the 15th of the latter month. As soon as\r\n    the new and young leaves have appeared in April, the plucking takes\r\n    place, this being done by the Chinese, assisted by the Mallees. The\r\n    following is the method adopted:--A certain division of the\r\n    plantation is marked off, and to each man a small basket is given,\r\n    with instructions to proceed to a certain point, so that no plant\r\n    may be passed over. On the small basket being filled, the leaves are\r\n    emptied into another large one, which is put in some shady place,\r\n    and in which, when filled, they are conveyed to the manufactory. The\r\n    leaves are generally plucked with the thumb and forefinger.\r\n    Sometimes the terminal part of a branch, having four or five young\r\n    leaves attached, is plucked off. All old leaves are rejected, as\r\n    they will not curl, and therefore are of no use.\r\n\r\n    As the season advances, and manufactory and plantation works become\r\n    necessary, the Mallees are assisted in gathering leaves by Coolies.\r\n    The process is simple, and thus every man, woman, and child of\r\n    villages could be profitably employed, on the plantations being\r\n    greatly extended. Certain kinds of leaves are not selected in the\r\n    plantation, in order to make certain kinds of tea, but all new and\r\n    fresh leaves are indiscriminately collected together, and the\r\n    different kinds separated on the leaves being fired.\r\n\r\n    _Method of manufacturing black tea_.--The young and fresh leaves on\r\n    being picked (they only being used, the old ones being too hard, and\r\n    therefore unfit to curl), are carried to the manufactory, and spread\r\n    out in a large airy room to cool, and are there kept during the\r\n    night, being occasionally turned with the hand if brought in in the\r\n    afternoon; or, if brought in during the morning, they are allowed to\r\n    lie until noon. Early in the morning the manufacturers visit the\r\n    airing room, and pack up the leaves in baskets and remove them to\r\n    the manufacturing room. Each manufacturer takes a basketful, and\r\n    commences to beat them between the palms of his hands with a lateral\r\n    motion, in order to soften and make them more pliable for working,\r\n    and thus prevent them, when rolled, from breaking. This beating\r\n    process continues for about an hour, and it may either consist of\r\n    one or two processes; the Chinese sometimes finish the beating\r\n    process at once; at others, they allow the leaves, after being beat\r\n    for half an hour, to remain a time and then resume it. They now go\r\n    to breakfast, and in one hour and a half the leaves are ready for\r\n    the pan. The pans being heated by wood placed in the oven, so as to\r\n    feel hot to the hands, are filled to about two-thirds, or about\r\n    three seers of leaves are thrown in at a time--the quantity which a\r\n    manufacturer is capable of lifting with both hands. With the hands\r\n    the leaves are kept moving with a rotatory motion in the pan, and\r\n    when they become very hot, the motion is kept up with a pair of\r\n    forked sticks. This process is continued for three or four minutes,\r\n    depending on the heat of the pan, or until the leaves feel hot and\r\n    soft. They are then, with one sweep of a bamboo brush, swept into a\r\n    basket, and thrown on to the rolling-table, which is covered with a\r\n    coarse mat made of bamboo. Each manufacturer then takes as much as\r\n    he can hold in both hands, and forms a ball and commences to roll it\r\n    with all his might with a semicircular motion, which causes a\r\n    greenish yellow juice to exude. This process is continued for three\r\n    or four minutes, the balls being occasionally undone and made up\r\n    again. The balls are then handed to another party at the extremity\r\n    of the table, to undo them and spread the leaves out thinly on flat\r\n    baskets and expose them to the sun, if there is any; if not they are\r\n    kept in the manufactory. After all the leaves have gone through this\r\n    process, the first baskets are brought back, and the leaves again\r\n    transferred to the pan, worked up in a similar manner for the same\r\n    length of time, re-transferred to the table, and again rolled. This\r\n    being done, the leaves are again spread out on large flat baskets to\r\n    cool. On being cooled the leaves are collected together and thinly\r\n    spread out on flat wicker-worked sieve-baskets, which are placed in\r\n    others of a deep and of a double-coned shape. The choolahs being\r\n    lighted for some time, and the charcoal burning clear, they are now\r\n    ready to receive the coned baskets. The basket is placed over the\r\n    choolah and kept there for about five minutes. The leaves are then\r\n    removed, re-transferred to the flat baskets, and re-rolled for a few\r\n    minutes. This being done, the leaves are again brought together,\r\n    placed in the conical basket and kept over the charcoal fire for\r\n    about two minutes. The contents of the conical baskets are then all\r\n    collected together in a heap, and as much is placed in a conical\r\n    basket as it will hold, and it is again placed over the charcoal\r\n    choolah until the tea is perfectly dry. During this time the baskets\r\n    are frequently removed and the tea turned, in order to allow the\r\n    leaves to be completely and uniformly dried, and the basket too is\r\n    generally struck, on removal, a violent side blow with the hand, to\r\n    remove from the sieve any small particles that might otherwise fall\r\n    into the fire. Before removing the basket from the choolah, a flat\r\n    basket is always placed on the floor to receive it, and all the\r\n    particles which pass through, on the coned basket being struck, are\r\n    again replaced. On the conical basket being filled, before placing\r\n    it over the choolah, a funnel is made in the centre of the tea with\r\n    the hand, to allow the heated air to pass through. Sometimes a\r\n    funnel made of bamboo is made for this purpose. After the tea feels\r\n    perfectly dry, it is packed in boxes, and sent to the godown.\r\n\r\n    Next day the different kinds of tea are picked, and on being\r\n    separated they are again placed in the conical baskets and heated.\r\n    During this process the baskets are frequently removed from the\r\n    choolah in order to turn the tea, so that the heating may be general\r\n    and uniform. In doing this a flat basket is always placed on the\r\n    floor, as on the former day (and a flat basket, too, is placed on\r\n    the top to confine the heat), to receive the conical one, which\r\n    receive one or two blows to open the pores of the sieve. What passes\r\n    through is replaced amongst the tea. When it is perfectly dry it is\r\n    ready for finally packing.\r\n\r\n    The kinds of black tea at present manufactured are--Souchong,\r\n    Pouchong, Flowery Pekoe, and Bohea. The Flowery Pekoe is\r\n    manufactured in September.\r\n\r\n    _Method of manufacturing Green Tea_.--On the young and fresh leaves\r\n    being plucked they are spread out on the ground of the airing room\r\n    and allowed to cool. After remaining for about two hours, or (if\r\n    brought in late in the afternoon) during the night, they are removed\r\n    to the green tea room. The pans being properly heated, the leaves,\r\n    as in the case with the black tea, are thrown into the pans and kept\r\n    either with the hand or two forked sticks in constant motion for\r\n    three or four minutes, and are then removed to the rolling table,\r\n    and then rolled in the same manner in balls as the black tea. They\r\n    are then scattered most sparingly on large flat baskets and exposed\r\n    to the heat of the sun. If there is no sun the baskets are arranged\r\n    in frames, which are placed over the choolah, heated with charcoal.\r\n    During the drying the leaves are frequently made into balls and\r\n    rolled in the flat baskets, in order to extract the juice. The\r\n    drying process continues for about two hours, and on the leaves\r\n    becoming dry, those contained in two baskets are thrown together,\r\n    and then four basketsful into one, and so on until they are all\r\n    collected together. In this state the leaves still feel soft, damp,\r\n    and pliant to the hand, and are now brought back to the tea\r\n    manufacturing-room. Opposite to each of the inclined pans, which\r\n    have been properly heated so as to feel warm to the hand by wood\r\n    supplied to the ovens underneath, one of the Chinese stations\r\n    himself, and puts as many leaves into it as it will hold. He then\r\n    moves them in a heap gently, from before backward, making these\r\n    perform a circle, and presses them strongly to the sides of the pan.\r\n    As the leaves become hot he uses a flat piece of wood, in order that\r\n    he may more effectually compress them. This process continues for\r\n    about two hours, the leaves being compressed into at least half of\r\n    their bulk, and become so dry that when pressed against the back\r\n    part of the pan in mass, they again fall back in pieces. The tea, as\r\n    by this time it has assumed this appearance, is now placed in a bag\r\n    made of American drill or jean (the size depending on the quantity\r\n    of tea), which is damped, and one end twisted with much force over a\r\n    stick, and thus it is much reduced in size. After being thus\r\n    powerfully compressed and beaten so as to reduce the mass as much as\r\n    possible, the bag is exposed to the sun until it feels perfectly\r\n    dry. If there is no sun it is placed in the heated pan, and there\r\n    retained until it is so. This finishes the first day's process.\r\n\r\n    On the second day it is placed in small quantities in the heated\r\n    inclined pans, and moved up and down against the sides and bottom\r\n    with the palm of the hand, which is made to perform a semi circle.\r\n    This is continued for about six hours, and by so doing the colour of\r\n    the tea is gradually brought out.\r\n\r\n    The third day it is passed through sieve baskets of different\r\n    dimensions, then exposed to the winnowing machine, which separates\r\n    the different kinds of green teas. The winnowing machine is divided\r\n    into a series of divisions, which receive the different kinds\r\n    according to their size and weight. 1st. Coarsest Souchoo. This tea,\r\n    owing to its coarseness, is not marketable. 2nd. Chounchoo. This is\r\n    a large, round-grained tea. 3rd. Machoo. This is also a\r\n    round-grained tea, but finer than the former. 4th. Hyson. 5th.\r\n    Gunpowder Hyson. 6th. Chumat. This kind of tea consists of broken\r\n    particles of other kinds of tea.\r\n\r\n    On being separated, the different kinds are placed in baskets and\r\n    picked by the hand, all the old or badly curled and also\r\n    light-coloured leaves being removed, and others of different\r\n    varieties, which by chance may have become mixed. To make the bad or\r\n    light-colored leaves marketable, they undergo an artificial process\r\n    of coloring, but this I have prohibited in compliance with the\r\n    orders of the Court of Directors, and therefore do not consider this\r\n    tea at present fit for the market[13]. On the different teas being\r\n    properly picked, they are again placed in the heated inclined pans,\r\n    and undergo separately the process of being moved violently up and\r\n    down and along the bottom of the pan for three hours in the manner\r\n    already described. The color is now fully developed. If the tea\r\n    feels damp, it is kept longer than three hours in the pan. The tea\r\n    is now ready to be packed.\r\n\r\n    _Packing_.--As soon as the tea is prepared, boxes lined with sheet\r\n    lead ought to be ready to receive it. On being packed it is to be\r\n    firmly pressed down, and the lead is then to be soldered. Before the\r\n    sheet lead box is placed in the wooden one it is covered with paper,\r\n    which is pasted on to prevent any air acting on the tea through any\r\n    holes which might exist in the lead. The box is then nailed, removed\r\n    to the godown, papered, stamped, and numbered. It is then ready for\r\n    sale.\r\n\r\n    From what I have just stated, it will be perceived that box makers\r\n    and sheet lead makers are essential to form a complete tea\r\n    establishment. With reference to the box making it is unnecessary\r\n    for me to make any remark, further than that care is to be taken in\r\n    selecting wood for making boxes, as it ought to be free of all\r\n    smell. All coniferous (pine) woods are therefore unfit for the\r\n    purpose. In the hills the best woods are toon and walnut, and at\r\n    Deyrah the saul (_Shorea Robusta_).\r\n\r\n    _Manufacture of sheet lead_.--Sheet lead making is a much more\r\n    complicated process, and therefore requires more consideration. To\r\n    make sheet lead, the manufacturer mixes 1½ to 3 seers of block tin\r\n    with a pucka maund of lead, and melts them together in a cast metal\r\n    pan. On being melted, the flat stone slabs, under which it is his\r\n    intention to run the lead, are first covered with ten or twelve\r\n    sheets of smooth paper (the hill paper being well adapted to the\r\n    purpose), which are pasted to the sides, and chalked over. He then\r\n    places the under stone in a skeleton frame of wood, to keep it firm,\r\n    and above it the other stone. On the upper stone the manufacturer\r\n    sits, and gently raises it with his left hand, assisted by throwing\r\n    the weight of his body backwards. With his right hand he fills an\r\n    iron ladle with the molten matter, throws it under the raised slab,\r\n    which he immediately compresses and brings forward (it having been\r\n    placed back, and thus overlapping the under slab by about half an\r\n    inch) with his own weight. On doing so, the superabundant lead\r\n    issues in front and at both sides; what remains attached to the\r\n    slabs is removed by the iron ladle. The upper slab is now lifted,\r\n    and the sheet of lead examined. If it is devoid of holes it is\r\n    retained; if, on the other hand, there are several, which is\r\n    generally the case with the first two or three sheets run, or until\r\n    the slabs get warm, it is again thrown back to the melting pan.\r\n    After having run off a series of sheets the slabs are to be\r\n    examined, and, if the paper is in the least burnt, the first sheet\r\n    is to be removed, and the one underneath taking its place, and thus\r\n    securing an uniform smooth surface, is then to be chalked. According\r\n    to the size of the stone slabs used, so is the size of the sheet\r\n    lead. Those now in use are 16 inches square by 2 inches in\r\n    thickness, and are a composition, being principally formed of lime.\r\n\r\n    To make sheet lead boxes, a model one of wood (a little smaller than\r\n    the box for which the lead is intended) is formed, which has a hole\r\n    in the bottom, and a transverse bar of wood to assist in lifting it\r\n    up, instead of a lid. The lead is then shaped on this model and\r\n    soldered. This being done, the model is removed by the transverse\r\n    bar, and by pressing, if necessary, through the hole. The lead box\r\n    is then papered over, in case there should be any small holes in it,\r\n    to prevent the action of air on the tea, and, when dry, transferred\r\n    to the wooden box for which it was intended.\r\n\r\n    _The manufactory_.--The rooms of the manufactory ought to be large\r\n    and airy, and to consist of--1st, a black tea manufactory; 2nd, a\r\n    green tea manufactory; 3rd, winnowing room; and 4th, airing room. At\r\n    Almorah the black tea manufacturing room is 53 feet long by 20\r\n    broad, and the other three, 20 by 24. The walls are 18 feet in\r\n    height.\r\n\r\n    _Implements required in manufacturing_.--In the body of this report\r\n    I have noticed all the different kinds of implements required, I may\r\n    however, again briefly notice them, and give a short account of\r\n    each. Cast-iron Pans--In the manufactory there are two kinds in use,\r\n    one received from China, the other from England. Both are considered\r\n    equally good by the tea manufacturers, though in firing green tea\r\n    they prefer the Chinese ones, as they are thinner, and are thus by\r\n    them better able to regulate the heat. The Chinese pans are two feet\r\n    two inches in diameter, and 10 inches in depth, by about one-eighth\r\n    of an inch in thickness.\r\n\r\n    The English pans are two feet two inches in diameter, and eight\r\n    inches in depth, and rather thicker than the Chinese.\r\n\r\n    The oven for making black tea is made of kucha brick. In height it\r\n    is two feet nine inches, in length, three feet, and in breadth three\r\n    feet one inch. Door one foot five inches in height, and 11 inches in\r\n    breadth. The base of the oven is 10 inches elevated above the floor\r\n    of the manufacturing room.\r\n\r\n    The oven with double pans for manufacturing green tea, is also built\r\n    of kucha bricks. It is three feet in height and three feet in\r\n    breadth; base of oven one foot in height. Door one foot six inches\r\n    in height, and 10 inches in breadth. The pans are placed\r\n    horizontally.\r\n\r\n    A brush made of split bamboo, used in sweeping the tea leaves out of\r\n    the pans.\r\n\r\n    A basket for receiving tea from the pan when ready to be rolled. It\r\n    is 2 feet long, and 1½ feet broad, and gradually increases in depth\r\n    from before backwards to 6 inches. It is made of bamboo.\r\n\r\n    The mat made of bamboo for placing on the table when the tea leaves\r\n    are about to be rolled. It is 8 feet long and 4 feet broad.\r\n\r\n    A flat basket made of bamboo for spreading out the tea leaves when\r\n    they have been rolled on the mat. These flat baskets are of various\r\n    sizes, varying from 3 to 5 feet in diameter.\r\n\r\n    A flat sieve basket of 2 feet in diameter, made of bamboo, upon\r\n    which the rolled tea leaves are placed, and which is deposited in\r\n    the centre of the double-coned basket.\r\n\r\n    Double-coned baskets. The height of these baskets varies from 2 feet\r\n    2 inches to 2 feet 6 inches, external diameter 2 feet 8 inches. In\r\n    the centre there are some pegs of bamboo to support the flat sieve\r\n    basket on which the tea rests.\r\n\r\n    Forked sticks for turning leaves.\r\n\r\n    Choolahs. These are formed of kucha bricks, and are 10 inches high,\r\n    10½ inches deep, and generally about 2 feet in diameter.\r\n\r\n    Funnel made of bamboo to allow the heated air from the choolahs to\r\n    pass through the tea; it is seldom used; the Chinese tea\r\n    manufacturers preferring one made in the tea basket by the hand.\r\n\r\n    Oven for firing green tea made of kucha bricks. The pans are\r\n    inclined at an angle of 50. In front the oven is 3 feet 2 inches in\r\n    height, behind 4 feet 8 inches, length 5½ feet, breadth 3 feet. Door\r\n    10 inches from the base, 1 foot 2 inches high, and 7 inches wide.\r\n\r\n    Frames for placing baskets. The first being inclined.\r\n\r\n    Baskets for collecting leaves.\r\n\r\n    Shovel, &c., used in regulating the fire.\r\n\r\n    Winnowing machine. This is a common winnowing machine, with a box 2\r\n    feet 10 inches in length, 1 foot 2 inches in breadth, and 1 foot 3\r\n    inches in depth, attached to the bottom of the hopper, and closely\r\n    fitted into the middle of the circular apartment which contains the\r\n    fanners. This box is entirely closed above (unless at the small\r\n    opening receiving the hopper) and at the sides. At the base there\r\n    are two inclined boards which project from the side of the machine 6\r\n    inches, and are partly separated from each other by angular pieces\r\n    of wood. The end towards the fanners is open, the other is partly\r\n    closed by a semicircular box which is moveable.\r\n\r\n    I shall now give the dimensions of the different parts of this\r\n    machine, which may be useful to parties wishing to make up similar\r\n    ones to those employed in the manufactories.\r\n\r\n    External frame 7 feet 2 inches in length, 18 inches in breadth, and\r\n    5 feet 8 inches in height. Hopper 2 feet 10 inches above, and 1 foot\r\n    8 inches in depth. Frame of box for fanners 3 feet 9 inches in\r\n    diameter. Hopper frame 2 feet 7 inches. Semicircular box, in length\r\n    2 feet 5 inches and 7 inches in depth. Inclined plane at base, first\r\n    15 inches, second 13 inches.\r\n\r\n    I may briefly state how this machine acts. With the right hand the\r\n    fanners are propelled by the crank, and with the left hand the\r\n    bottom of the hopper is opened by removing the wood. The flat piece\r\n    of wood (the regulator) is held in the hand to regulate the quantity\r\n    of tea that passes down. An assistant then throws a quantity of tea\r\n    into the hopper which escapes through the apartment, and there meets\r\n    the air. The first kind of tea falls down the inclined plane into\r\n    one box which has been placed to receive them, the second are\r\n    propelled further on, and fall into another box, and the lighter\r\n    particles are propelled on to the semicircular end, and fall into a\r\n    third box.\r\n\r\n    _Note on the culture of the tea plant at Darjeeling, in 1847, by Dr.\r\n    A. Campbell, Superintendant_.--About six years ago I received a few\r\n    tea seeds from Dr. Wallich; they were of China stock, grown in\r\n    Kumaon. I planted them in my garden in November, 1841, and had about\r\n    a dozen seedlings in the month of May following, which were allowed\r\n    to grow where they had come up, and rather close together. The\r\n    plants were healthy from the commencement, and up to May, 1844, had\r\n    grown very well; at this period the ground passed into other hands\r\n    (Mr. Samuel Smith's), and I lost sight of them until last August,\r\n    when Mr. Macfarlane, from Assam, who was acquainted with the tea\r\n    plant in that province, arrived here. Being desirous of ascertaining\r\n    how far the climate and soil of Darjeeling were suitable to the tea,\r\n    I took him to examine the plants, and begged of him to record his\r\n    opinion on their growth and qualities, with reference to their age,\r\n    and his experience of the plant in Assam. The result was quite\r\n    satisfactory. Encouraged by this result, I determined to give an\r\n    extended trial to the plant, and through the kindness of Major\r\n    Jenkins and Captain Brodie, of Assam, I procured a supply of fresh\r\n    seed in October and November last, which was planted in November and\r\n    the early part of December.\r\n\r\n    The seed was of excellent quality. It commenced germinating in\r\n    March, a few plants appeared above ground in the early part of May,\r\n    and now I have upwards of 7,000 fine healthy seedlings in the\r\n    plantation.\r\n\r\n    For the information of those who may desire to try the tea culture\r\n    in this soil and climate, I have to state the mode of planting\r\n    pursued by me, and other particulars. The ground is a gentle sloping\r\n    bank, facing the north and west; the soil is a reddish clay mixed\r\n    with vegetable mould. After taking up a crop of potatoes, and\r\n    carefully preparing the ground, I put in the seeds in rows six feet\r\n    apart and six feet distance in the rows. The seeds were placed about\r\n    three inches under the surface, five in number, at each place about\r\n    four inches apart--thus : . : On an average, two out of five have\r\n    come up. The seedlings commenced appearing above ground early in\r\n    May, and continued to show until the end of July. The earliest were,\r\n    therefore, six months in the ground; the latest about eight months.\r\n\r\n    The seed was of China stock, grown in Assam, and of the Assam plant\r\n    mixed. I am anxious to have the China stock only, and purpose\r\n    separating the plants of the Assam stock as soon as I can\r\n    distinguish them, which Captain Brodie informs me can be readily\r\n    done as they grow up; the China plants begin of a darker color, and\r\n    smaller than the Assam ones.\r\n\r\n    I hope to have a supply of the seed of China stock from Kumaon next\r\n    November, and with it to cause the extension of the experiment at\r\n    this place.\r\n\r\n    I think that it is reasonable to expect quite as good tea to be\r\n    produced here as in Kumaon.[14] I have not tasted the Kumaon tea,\r\n    but, from the opinion expressed on it in England, I am satisfied\r\n    that it is a very drinkable beverage, and that with similar success\r\n    here, the tea will be a valuable addition to our products. I have\r\n    recently tried two kinds of the Assam tea presented by Mr. Stokes to\r\n    a friend. They are excellent teas, and I shall be well content to\r\n    have an equally good article manufactured here.\r\n\r\nMr. A. Macfarlane's report on the tea plants in Mr. Smith's ground is\r\nannexed:--\r\n\r\n    \"According to your request I have the pleasure of transmitting you\r\n    my opinion of the tea plants in your garden in this place. The two\r\n    larger plants have made very good progress, considering their\r\n    closeness to each other, which prevents them from throwing their\r\n    branches freely in every direction, but as they have attained so\r\n    great a size I would not recommend their being transplanted, because\r\n    let it be done ever so carefully, the roots must receive more or\r\n    less injury, and should the injury be great the death of the tree is\r\n    certain.\r\n\r\n    The smaller ones on the contrary are much stunted; this is caused by\r\n    their confined situation, being completely choked up by the rose\r\n    trees, which prevents their receiving a proper supply of light and\r\n    air, so necessary to vegetation. They are also planted too closely,\r\n    and, as the plants are still small, by availing yourself of the most\r\n    favourable season, and using great care in the operation, they might\r\n    he transplanted with safety, and should then be placed at a distance\r\n    of not less than six feet apart. The difficulty of transplanting is\r\n    occasioned by the depth to which the root penetrates, as it\r\n    generally grows downwards, and in a large tree is principally in the\r\n    subsoil. The larger plants should be pruned of their lower branches\r\n    to allow a free current of air. This operation is generally\r\n    performed in November, but any time during the cold season or before\r\n    the rains, while the plant is at rest, would answer: as I have no\r\n    knowledge of this climate, I would leave it to more experienced\r\n    persons to judge of the proper season. To conclude, the plants are\r\n    in a very healthy condition, and had they been in the hands of a\r\n    cultivator, would now have been giving a very fair supply of\r\n    produce.\r\n\r\n    The small sample I tried was of a very good flavor, but on account\r\n    of the defective manner of manufacture, for want of proper\r\n    materials, no proper judgment can be formed.\" (Simmonds's Col. Mag.,\r\n    vol. xvi. p. 44.)\r\n\r\nReport upon the Tea Plantations of Deyra, Kumaon and Gurhwal, by\r\nRobert Fortune, Esq., addressed to John Thornton, Esq., Secretary to\r\nthe Government, North Western Provinces, dated Calcutta, September\r\n6th, 1851:--\r\n\r\n    KAOLAGIR TEA PLANTATION.\r\n\r\n    1. _Situation and extent_.--The Deyra Doon, or Valley of Deyra, is\r\n    situated in latitude 3 deg. 18 min. north, and in longitude 78 deg.\r\n    east. It is about 60 miles in length from east to west, and 16 miles\r\n    broad at its widest part. It is bounded on the south by the Sewalick\r\n    range of hills, and on the north by the Himalayas proper, which are\r\n    here nearly 8,000 feet above the level of the sea. On the west it is\r\n    open to the river Jumna, and on the east to the Ganges, the distance\r\n    between these rivers being about 60 miles.\r\n\r\n    In the centre of this flat valley, the Kaolagir tea plantation has\r\n    been formed. Eight acres were under cultivation in 1847. There are\r\n    now 300 acres planted, and about 90 more taken in and ready for many\r\n    thousands of young plants raised lately from seeds in the\r\n    plantation.\r\n\r\n    2. _Soil and culture_.--The soil of this plantation is composed of\r\n    clay, sand, and vegetable matter, rather stiff, and apt to get\r\n    \"baked\" in dry weather, but free enough when it is moist or during\r\n    the rains. It rests upon a gravelly subsoil, consisting of\r\n    limestone, sandstone, clay-slate, and quartz rock, or of such rocks\r\n    as enter into the composition of the surrounding mountain ranges.\r\n    The surface is comparatively _flat_, although it falls in certain\r\n    directions towards the ravines and rivers.\r\n\r\n    The plants are arranged neatly in rows 6 feet apart, and each plant\r\n    is about 4½ feet from its neighbour in the row. A long, rank-growing\r\n    species of grass, indigenous to the Doon, is most difficult to keep\r\n    from over-topping the tea-plants, and is the cause of much extra\r\n    labor. Besides the labor common to all tea countries in China, such\r\n    as weeding, and occasionally loosening the soil, there is here an\r\n    extensive system of irrigation carried on. To facilitate this, the\r\n    plants are planted in trenches, from four to six inches below the\r\n    level of the ground, and the soil thus dug out is thrown between the\r\n    rows to form the paths. Hence the whole of the plantation consists\r\n    of numerous trenches of this depth, and five feet from centre to\r\n    centre. At right angles with these trenches a small stream is fed\r\n    from the canal, and, by opening or shutting their ends, irrigation\r\n    can be carried on at the pleasure of the overseer.\r\n\r\n    3. _Appearance and health of plants_.--The plants generally did not\r\n    appear to me to be in that fresh and vigorous condition which I had\r\n    been accustomed to see in good Chinese plantations. This, in my\r\n    opinion, is caused, 1st, by the plantation being formed on _flat\r\n    land_; 2nd, by the system of _irrigation_; 3rd, by too early\r\n    plucking; and 4th, by hot drying winds, which are not unfrequent in\r\n    this valley from April to the beginning of June.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GUDDOWLI PLANTATION (NEAR PAORIE).\r\n\r\n    1. _Situation and extent_.--This plantation is situated in the\r\n    Province of Eastern Gurhwal, in latitude 30 deg. 8 min. north, and\r\n    in longitude 78 deg. 45 min. east. It consists of a large tract of\r\n    terraced land, extending from the bottom of a valley or ravine to\r\n    more than 1,000 feet up the sides of the mountain. Its lowest\r\n    portion is about 4,300 feet, and its highest 5,300 feet above the\r\n    level of the sea; the surrounding mountains appear to be from 7,000\r\n    to 8,000. The plantation has not been measured, but there are,\r\n    apparently, fully one hundred acres under cultivation.\r\n\r\n    There are about 500,000 plants already planted, besides a large\r\n    number of seedlings in beds ready for transplanting. About 3,400 of\r\n    the former were planted in 1844, and are now in full bearing; the\r\n    greater portion of the others are much younger, having been planted\r\n    out only one, two, and three years.\r\n\r\n    2. _Soil and culture_.--The soil consists of a mixture of loam,\r\n    sand, and vegetable matter, is of a yellow colour, and is most\r\n    suitable for the cultivation of the tea-plant. It resembles greatly\r\n    the soil of the test tea districts in China. A considerable quantity\r\n    of stones are mixed with it, chiefly small pieces of clay-slate, of\r\n    which the mountains here are composed. Large tracts of equally good\r\n    land, at present covered with jungle, are available in this district\r\n    without interfering in any way with the rights of the settlers.\r\n\r\n    I have stated that this plantation is formed on the hill side. It\r\n    consists of a succession of terraces, from the bottom to the top, on\r\n    which the tea bushes are planted. In its general features it is very\r\n    like a Chinese tea plantation, although one rarely sees tea lands\r\n    terraced in China. This, however, may be necessary in the Himalayas,\r\n    where the rains fall so heavily. Here, too, the system of irrigation\r\n    is carried on, although to a small extent only, owing to the\r\n    scarcity of water during the dry season.\r\n\r\n    3. _Appearance and health of plants_.--This plantation is a most\r\n    promising one, and I have no doubt will be very valuable in a few\r\n    years. The plants are growing admirably, and evidently like their\r\n    situation. Some of them are suffering slightly from the effects of\r\n    hard-plucking, like those at Kaolagir; but this can easily be\r\n    avoided in their future management. Altogether, it is in a most\r\n    satisfactory condition, and shows how safe it is in matters of this\r\n    kind to follow the example of the Chinese cultivator, who never\r\n    makes his tea plantations on _low rice land, and never irrigates_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    HAWULBAUGH PLANTATION (NEAR ALMORAH).\r\n\r\n    _1st. Situation and extent_.--This tea farm is situated on the banks\r\n    of the river Kosilla, about six miles north-west from Almorah, the\r\n    capital of Kumaon. It is about 4,500 feet above the level of the\r\n    sea. The land is of an undulating character, consisting of gentle\r\n    slopes and terraces, and reminded me of some of the best tea\r\n    districts in China. Indeed, the hills themselves, in this part of\r\n    the Himalayas, are very much like those of China, being barren near\r\n    their summit and fertile on their lower sides.\r\n\r\n    Thirty-four acres of land are under tea cultivation here, including\r\n    the adjoining farm of Chullar. Some of the plants appear to have\r\n    been planted in 1844; but, as at Paorie, the greater number are only\r\n    from one to three years old.\r\n\r\n    2_nd. Soil and culture_.--The soil is what is usually called a sandy\r\n    loam; it is moderately rich, being well mixed with vegetable matter.\r\n    It is well suited for tea cultivation. The greater part of the farm\r\n    is terraced as at Guddowli, but some few patches are left in natural\r\n    slopes in accordance with the Chinese method. Irrigation is\r\n    practised to a limited extent.\r\n\r\n    3_rd. Appearance and health of the plants_.--All the young plants\r\n    here are in robust health and are growing well, particularly where\r\n    they are growing on land where water cannot flood or injure them. As\r\n    examples of this, I may point out a long belt between Dr. Jameson's\r\n    house and the flower garden, and also a piece of ground a little\r\n    below the house in which the Chinese manufacturers live. Some few of\r\n    the older bushes appear rather stunted; but this is evidently the\r\n    result of water remaining stagnant about the roots, and partly also\r\n    of over plucking; both defects, however, admit of being easily\r\n    cured.\r\n\r\n\r\n    LUTCHMISSER AND KUPPEENA PLANTATIONS.\r\n\r\n    1_st. Situation and extent_.--These plantations are on the hill side\r\n    near Almorah, and about 5,000 feet above the level of the sea. The\r\n    situation is somewhat steep, but well adapted to the growth of tea.\r\n    The former contains three acres, and the latter four acres under\r\n    cultivation.\r\n\r\n    2_nd. Soil and culture_.---The soil is light and sandy, and much\r\n    mixed with particles of clay-slate, which have crumbled down from\r\n    the adjoining rocks. I believe these plantations are rarely\r\n    irrigated, and the land is steep enough to prevent any stagnant\r\n    water from remaining about the roots of the plants.\r\n\r\n    3_rd. Appearance and health of plants_.--Most of the bushes here are\r\n    fully grown, and in full bearing, and generally in good health. On\r\n    the whole, I consider these plantations in excellent order.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BHEEMTAL PLANTATIONS.\r\n\r\n    The lake of Bheemtal is situate in latitude 29 deg. 20 min. north,\r\n    and in longitude 79 deg. 30 min. east. It is 4,000 feet above the\r\n    level of the sea, and some of the surrounding mountains are said to\r\n    be 8,000 feet. These form the southern chain of the Himalayas, and\r\n    bound the vast plain of India, of which a glimpse can be had through\r\n    the mountain passes. Amongst these hills there are several _tals_ or\r\n    lakes, some flat meadow-looking land, and gentle undulating slopes,\r\n    while higher up we have steep and rugged mountains. It is amongst\r\n    these hills, that the Bheemtal tea plantations have been formed.\r\n    They may be classed under three heads, viz.--\r\n\r\n    1_st. Anoo and Kooasur plantations_.--These adjoin each other, are\r\n    both formed _on low flat land_, and together cover about forty\r\n    acres. The plants do not seem healthy or vigorous; many of them have\r\n    died out, and few are in that state which tea plants ought to be in.\r\n    Such situations never ought to be chosen for tea cultivation. The\r\n    same objection applies to these as to those at Deyra, but in a\r\n    greater degree. No doubt, with sufficient drainage, and great care\r\n    in cultivation, and the tea plant might be made to exist in such a\r\n    situation; but I am convinced it would never grow with that\r\n    luxuriance which is necessary in order to render it a profitable\r\n    crop. _Besides, such lands are valuable for other purposes_. They\r\n    are excellent rice lands, and as such of considerable value to the\r\n    natives.\r\n\r\n    2_nd. Bhurtpoor plantation_.--This plantation covers about four and\r\n    a half acres of terraced land on the hill side, a little to the\r\n    eastward of those last noticed. The soil is composed of a light\r\n    loam, much mixed with small pieces of clay-slate and trap or\r\n    green-stone, of which the adjacent rocks are composed. It contains a\r\n    small portion of vegetable matter or _humus_. Both the situation and\r\n    soil of this plantation are well adapted to the requirements of the\r\n    tea shrub, and consequently we find it succeeding here as well as at\r\n    Guddowli, Hawulbaugh, Almorah, and other places where it is planted\r\n    on the slopes of the hills.\r\n\r\n    3_rd. Russia plantation_.--This plantation extends over seventy-five\r\n    acres, and is formed on sloping land. The elevation is somewhat less\r\n    than Bhurtpoor, and although terraced in the same way, the angle is\r\n    much lower. In some parts of the farm the plants are doing well, but\r\n    generally they seemed to be suffering from too much water and hard\r\n    plucking. I have no doubt, however, of the success of this farm,\r\n    when the system of cultivation is improved. I observed some most\r\n    vigorous and healthy bushes in the overseer's garden, a spot\r\n    adjoining the plantation, which could not be irrigated, and was\r\n    informed they \"never received any water, except that which fell from\r\n    the skies.\"\r\n\r\n    In the Bheemtal district, there are large tracts of excellent tea\r\n    land. In crossing over the hills towards Nainee Tal, with J.H.\r\n    Batten, Esq., Commissioner of Kumaon, I pointed out many tracts\r\n    admirably adapted for tea cultivation, and of no great value to the\r\n    natives; generally, those lands on which the mundoca is cultivated\r\n    are the most suitable.\r\n\r\n    I have thus described all the Government plantations in Gurhwal and\r\n    Kumaon. Dr. Jameson, the superintendent, deserves the highest praise\r\n    for the energy and perseverance with which he has conducted his\r\n    operations. I shall now notice the plantations of the zemindars,\r\n    under the superintendence of the commissioner and\r\n    assistant-commissioner of Kumaon and Gurhwal.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ZEMINDAREE TEA PLANTATIONS.\r\n\r\n    1_st, at Lohba_.--This place is situated in eastern Gurhwal, about\r\n    50 miles to the westward of Almorah, and is at an elevation of 5,000\r\n    feet above the level of the sea. It is one of the most beautiful\r\n    spots in this part of the Himalayas. The surrounding mountains are\r\n    high, and in some parts precipitous, while in others they are found\r\n    consisting of gentle slopes and undulations. On these undulating\r\n    slopes, there is a great deal of excellent land suitable for tea\r\n    cultivation. A few tea bushes have been growing vigorously for some\r\n    years in the commissioner's garden, and they are now fully ten feet\r\n    in height. These plants having succeeded so well, naturally induced\r\n    the authorities of the province to try this cultivation upon a more\r\n    extensive scale. It appears that in 1844, about 4,000 young plants\r\n    were obtained from the Government plantations, and planted on a\r\n    tract of excellent land, which the natives wished to abandon.\r\n    Instead of allowing the people to throw up their land, they were\r\n    promised it rent-free upon the condition that they attended to the\r\n    cultivation of the tea, which had been planted on a small portion of\r\n    the ground attached to the village.\r\n\r\n    This arrangement seems to have failed either from want of knowledge,\r\n    or from design, or perhaps partly from both of these causes. More\r\n    lately, a larger number of plants have been planted, but I regret to\r\n    say with nearly the same results.\r\n\r\n    But results of this discouraging kind are what any one, acquainted\r\n    with the nature of the tea plant, could have easily foretold, had\r\n    the treatment, intended to be given it, been explained to him. Upon\r\n    enquiry, I found the villagers had been managing the tea lands just\r\n    as they had been doing their rice fields, that is, a regular system\r\n    of irrigation was practised. As water was plentiful, a great number,\r\n    indeed nearly all, the plants seem to have perished from this cause.\r\n    The last planting alluded to had been done late in the spring, and\r\n    just at the commencement of the dry weather, and to these plants\r\n    little or no water seems to have been given; so that, in fact, it\r\n    was going from one extreme to another equally bad, and the result\r\n    was of course nearly the same.\r\n\r\n    I have no hesitation in saying that the district in question is well\r\n    adapted for the cultivation of tea. With judicious management, a\r\n    most productive farm might be established here in four or five\r\n    years. Land is plentiful, and of little value either to the natives\r\n    or to the Government.\r\n\r\n    2_nd, at Kutoor_.--This is the name of a large district 30 or 40\r\n    miles northward from Almorah, in the centre of which the old town or\r\n    village of Byznath stands. It is a fine undulating country,\r\n    consisting of wide valleys, gentle slopes, and little hills, while\r\n    the whole is intersected by numerous streams, and surrounded by high\r\n    mountains. The soil of this extensive district is most fertile, and\r\n    is capable of producing large crops of rice, on the low irrigable\r\n    lands, and the dry grains and tea on the sides of the hills. From\r\n    some cause, however, either the thinness of population or _the want\r\n    of a remunerative crop_,[15] large tracts of this fertile district\r\n    have been allowed to go out of cultivation. Everywhere I observed\r\n    ruinous and jungle-covered terraces, which told of the more extended\r\n    cultivation of former years.\r\n\r\n    Amongst some hills near the upper portion of this district, two\r\n    small tea plantations have been formed under the patronage and\r\n    superintendence of Captain Ramsey, Senior Assistant Commissioner of\r\n    Kumaon. Each of them cover three or four acres of land, and had been\r\n    planted about a year before the time of my visit. In this short\r\n    space of time the plants had grown into nice strong bushes, and were\r\n    in the highest state of health. I never saw, even in the most\r\n    favoured districts in China, any plantations looking better than\r\n    these. This result, Captain Ramsay informed me, had been attained in\r\n    the following simple manner:--All the land attached to the two\r\n    villages with which the tea farms are connected, is exempted from\r\n    the revenue tax, a sum amounting only to 525 Rs. per annum. In lieu\r\n    of this, the assamees (cultivators) of both villages assist with\r\n    manure, and at the transplanting season, as well as ploughing and\r\n    preparing fresh land. In addition to this, one chowdree and four\r\n    prisoners are constantly employed upon the plantations. The chief\r\n    reason of the success of these plantations, next to that of the land\r\n    being well suited for tea cultivation, may, no doubt, be traced to a\r\n    good system of management; that is, the young plants have been\r\n    carefully transplanted at the proper season of the year, when the\r\n    air was charged with moisture, and they have not been destroyed by\r\n    excessive irrigation afterwards. The other zemindaree plantation at\r\n    Lohba might have been now in full bearing had the same system been\r\n    followed.\r\n\r\n    From the description thus given, it will be observed that I consider\r\n    the Kutoor plantations in a most flourishing condition. And I have\r\n    no doubt they will continue to flourish, and soon convince the\r\n    zemindars of the value of tea cultivation, providing three things,\r\n    intimately connected with the success of the crop are strongly\r\n    impressed upon their minds; viz., the unsuitableness of low wet\r\n    lands for tea cultivation; the folly of irrigating tea as they would\r\n    do rice, and the impropriety of commencing the plucking before the\r\n    plants are strong, and of considerable size. I am happy to add, that\r\n    amongst these hills there are no foolish prejudices in the minds of\r\n    the natives against the cultivation of tea. About the time of my\r\n    visit, a zemindar came and begged two thousand plants, to enable him\r\n    to commence tea growing on his own account.\r\n\r\n    It is of great importance, that the authorities of a district, and\r\n    persons of influence, should show an interest in a subject of this\r\n    kind. At present the natives do not know its value; but they are as\r\n    docile as children, and will enter willingly upon tea cultivation,\r\n    providing the \"Sahib\" shows that he is interested in it. In a few\r\n    years the profits received will be a sufficient inducement.\r\n\r\n    In concluding this part of my Report, I beg to suggest the propriety\r\n    of obtaining some of the _best varieties_ of the tea plant which\r\n    have been introduced lately into the government plantations from\r\n    China. Dr. Jameson could, no doubt, spare a few, but they ought to\r\n    be given to those zemindars only who have succeeded with the\r\n    original variety.\r\n\r\n    Having described in detail the various government plantations, and\r\n    also those of the zemindars which came under my notice in the\r\n    Himalayas, I shall now make some general remarks upon the\r\n    cultivation of tea in India, and offer some suggestions for its\r\n    improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GENERAL REMARKS.\r\n\r\n    1. _On land and cultivation_.--From the observations already made\r\n    upon the various tea farms which I have visited in the Himalayas, it\r\n    will be seen that I do not approve of _low flat lands_ being\r\n    selected for the cultivation of the tea shrub. In China, which at\r\n    present must be regarded as the model tea country, the plantations\r\n    are never made in such situations, or they are so rare as not to\r\n    have come under my notice. In that country they are usually formed\r\n    on the lower slopes of the hills, that is, in such situations as\r\n    those at Guddowli, Hawulbaugh, Almorah, Kutoor, &c., in the\r\n    Himalayas. It is true that in the fine green tea country of\r\n    Hwuy-chow, in China, near the town of Tunche, many hundred acres of\r\n    flattish land are under tea cultivation. But this land is close to\r\n    the hills, which jut out into it in all directions, and it is\r\n    intersected by a river whose banks are usually from 15 to 20 feet\r\n    above the level of the stream itself, not unlike those of the Ganges\r\n    below Benares. In fact, it has all the advantages of hilly land such\r\n    as the tea plant delights in. In extending the Himalaya plantation\r\n    this important fact ought to be kept in view.\r\n\r\n    There is no scarcity of such land in these mountains, more\r\n    particularly in Eastern Gurhwal and Kumaon. It abounds in the\r\n    districts of Paorie, Kunour, Lohba, Almorah, Kutoor, and Bheemtal,\r\n    and I was informed by Mr. Batten, that there are large tracts about\r\n    Gungoli and various other places equally suitable. Much of this land\r\n    is out of cultivation, as I have already stated, while the\r\n    cultivated portions yield on an average only two or three annas per\r\n    acre of revenue.\r\n\r\n    Such lands are of less value to the zemindars than low rice land,\r\n    where they can command a good supply of water for irrigation. But I\r\n    must not be understood to recommend poor worn out hill lands for tea\r\n    cultivation,--land on which nothing else will grow. Nothing is\r\n    further from my meaning. Tea in order to be profitable requires a\r\n    good sound soil,--a light loam, well mixed with sand and vegetable\r\n    matter, moderately moist, and yet not stagnant or sour. Such a soil,\r\n    for example, as on these hill sides produces good crops of mundooa,\r\n    wheat or millet, is well adapted for tea. It is such lands which I\r\n    have alluded to as abounding in the Himalayas, and which are, at\r\n    present, of so little value either to the Government, or to the\r\n    natives themselves.\r\n\r\n    _The system of Irrigation_ applied to tea in India is never\r\n    practised in China. I did not observe it practised in any of the\r\n    great tea countries which I visited. On asking the Chinese\r\n    manufacturers whom I brought round, and who had been born and\r\n    brought up in these districts, whether they had seen such a\r\n    practice, they all replied, \"_no, that is the way we grow rice: we\r\n    never irrigate tea_.\" Indeed, I have no hesitation in saying that,\r\n    in nine cases out of ten, the effects of irrigation are most\r\n    injurious. When tea will not grow without irrigation, it is a sure\r\n    sign that the land employed is not suitable for such a crop. It is\r\n    no doubt an excellent thing to have a command of water in case of a\r\n    long drought, when its agency might be useful in saving a crop which\r\n    would otherwise fail, but irrigation ought to be used only in such\r\n    emergent cases.\r\n\r\n    I have already observed that good tea land is naturally moist,\r\n    although not stagnant; and we must bear in mind that the tea shrub\r\n    is _not a water plant_, but is found in a wild state on the sides of\r\n    hills. In confirmation of these views, it is only necessary to\r\n    observe further, that all the _best Himalayan plantations are those\r\n    to which irrigation has been most sparingly applied_.\r\n\r\n    In cultivating the tea shrub, much injury is often done to a\r\n    plantation by _plucking leaves from very young plants_. In China\r\n    young plants are never touched until the third or fourth year after\r\n    they have been planted. If growing under favorable circumstances,\r\n    they will yield a good crop after that time. All that ought to be\r\n    done, in the way of plucking or pruning before that time, should be\r\n    done with a view to _form the plants_, and make them _bushy_ if they\r\n    do not grow so naturally. If plucking is commenced too early and\r\n    continued, the energies of the plants are weakened, and they are\r\n    long in attaining any size, and consequently there is a great loss\r\n    of produce in a given number of years. To make this more plain, I\r\n    will suppose a bush that has been properly treated to be eight years\r\n    of age. It may then be yielding from two to three pounds of tea per\r\n    annum, while another of the same age, but not a quarter of the size,\r\n    from over-plucking, is not giving more than as many ounces.\r\n\r\n    The same remarks apply also to plants which become unhealthy from\r\n    any cause; leaves ought never to be taken from such plants; the\r\n    gatherers should have strict orders to pass them over until they get\r\n    again into a _good state_ of health.\r\n\r\n    2_nd. On climate_.--I have already stated that eastern Gurhwal and\r\n    Kumaon appear to me to be the most suitable for the cultivation of\r\n    the tea plant in this part of the Himalayas. My remarks upon climate\r\n    will therefore refer to this part of the country.\r\n\r\n    From a table of temperature kept at Hawulbaugh from November 28th,\r\n    1850, to July 13th, 1851, obligingly furnished me by Dr. Jameson, I\r\n    observed that the climate here is extremely mild. During the winter\r\n    months, the thermometer [Fahr.] at sunrise was never lower than 44\r\n    deg., and only on two occasions so low, namely on the 15th and 16th\r\n    of February, 1851. Once it stood so high as 66 deg. on the morning\r\n    of February 4th, but this is full ten degrees higher than usual. The\r\n    minimum in February must, however, be several degrees lower than is\r\n    shown by this table, for ice and snow were not unfrequent; indeed,\r\n    opposite the 16th of February in the column of remarks, I find\r\n    written down _a very frosty morning_. This discrepancy no doubt\r\n    arises either from a bad thermometer being used, or from its being\r\n    placed in a sheltered verandah. We may, therefore, safely mark the\r\n    minimum as 32 deg. instead of 44 degrees.\r\n\r\n    The month of June appears to be the hottest in the year. I observe\r\n    the thermometer on the 5th, 6th and 7th of that month stood at 92\r\n    deg. at 3 P.M., and this was the highest degree marked during the\r\n    year. The lowest, at this hour, during the month was 76 deg., but\r\n    the general range in the 3 P.M. column of the table is from 80 deg.\r\n    to 90 degrees.\r\n\r\n    _The wet and dry seasons_ are not so decided in the hills as they\r\n    are in the plains. In January, 1861, it rained on five days and ten\r\n    nights, and the total quantity of rain which fell, as indicated by\r\n    the rain gauge, during this month, was 5.25 inches; in February,\r\n    3.84 fell; in March, 2.11; in April, 2.24; in May, none; and in June\r\n    6.13. In June there are generally some days of heavy rain, called by\r\n    the natives Chota Bursaut, or small rains, after this there is an\r\n    interval of some days of dry weather before the regular \"rainy\r\n    season\" commences. This season comes on in July and continues until\r\n    September. October and November are said to be beautiful months with\r\n    a clear atmosphere and cloudless sky. After this fogs are frequent\r\n    in all the valleys until spring.\r\n\r\n    In comparing the climate of these provinces with that of China,\r\n    although we find some important difference, yet upon the whole there\r\n    is a great similarity. My comparisons apply, of course, to the best\r\n    tea districts only, for although the tea shrub is found cultivated\r\n    from Canton in the south to Tan-chowpoo in Shan-tung, yet the\r\n    provinces of Fokein, Kainsee and the southern parts of Kiangnan,\r\n    yield nearly all the finest teas of commerce.\r\n\r\n    The town of Tsong-gan, one of the great black tea towns near the far\r\n    famed Woo-e-shan, is situated in latitude 27 deg. 47 min, north.\r\n    Here the thermometer in the hottest months, namely in July and\r\n    August, rarely rises above 100 deg. and ranges from 92 deg. to 100\r\n    deg., as maximum; while in the coldest months, December and January,\r\n    it sinks to the freezing point and sometimes a few degrees lower. We\r\n    have thus a close resemblance in temperature between Woo-e-shan and\r\n    Almorah, The great green tea district being situated two degrees\r\n    further north, the extremes of temperature are somewhat greater. It\r\n    will be observed, however, that while the hottest month in the\r\n    Himalayas is June, in China the highest temperature occurs in July\r\n    and August: this is owing to the rainy season taking place earlier\r\n    in China than it does in India.\r\n\r\n    In China rain falls in heavy and copious showers in the end of\r\n    April, and these rains continue at intervals in May and June. The\r\n    first gathering of tea-leaves, those from which the Pekoe is made,\r\n    is scarcely over before the air becomes charged with moisture, rain\r\n    falls, and the bushes being thus placed in such favourable\r\n    circumstances for vegetating are soon covered again with young\r\n    leaves, from which the main crop of the season is obtained.\r\n\r\n    No one, acquainted with vegetable physiology, can doubt the\r\n    advantages of such weather in the cultivation of tea for mercantile\r\n    purposes. And these advantages, to a certain extent at least, seem\r\n    to be extended to the Himalayas, although the regular rainy season\r\n    is later than in China. I have already shown, from Dr Jameson's\r\n    table, that spring showers are frequent in Kumaon, although rare in\r\n    the plains of India; still, however, I think it would be prudent to\r\n    adopt the gathering of leaves to the climate, that is to take a\r\n    moderate portion from the bushes before the rains, and the main crop\r\n    after they have commenced.\r\n\r\n    _3rd. On the vegetation of China and the Himalayas_. One of the\r\n    surest guides from which to draw conclusions, on a subject of this\r\n    nature, is found in the indigenous vegetable productions of the\r\n    countries. Dr. Royle, who was the first to recommend the cultivation\r\n    of tea in the Himalayas, drew his conclusions, in the absence of\r\n    that positive information from China which we possess now, not only\r\n    from the great similarity in temperature between China and these\r\n    hills, but also from the resemblance in vegetable productions. This\r\n    resemblance is certainly very striking. In both countries, except in\r\n    the low valleys of the Himalayas (and these we are not considering),\r\n    tropical forms are rarely met with. If we take trees and shrubs, for\r\n    example, we find such genera as pinus, cypress, berberis, quercus,\r\n    viburnam, indigofera, and romeda, lonicera, deutzia, rubus, myrica,\r\n    spiræ, ilex, and many others common to both countries.\r\n\r\n    Amongst herbaceous plants we have gentiana, aquilegia, anemone,\r\n    rumex, primula, lilium, loutodon, ranunculus, &c. equally\r\n    distributed in the Himalayas and in China, and even in aquatics the\r\n    same resemblance may be traced, as in nelumbium, caladium &c. And\r\n    further than this, we do not find plants belong to the same genera\r\n    only, but in many instances the identical species are found in both\r\n    countries. The indigofera, common in the Himalayas, abounds also on\r\n    the tea hills of China, and so does _Berberis nepaulencis_,\r\n    _Lonicera diversifolia_, _Myrica sapida_, and many others.\r\n\r\n    Were it necessary, I might now show that there is a most striking\r\n    resemblance between the geology of the two countries as well as in\r\n    their vegetable productions. In both the black and green tea\r\n    countries which I have alluded to, clay-slate is most abundant. But\r\n    enough has been advanced to prove how well many parts of the\r\n    Himalayas are adapted for the cultivation of tea; besides, the\r\n    flourishing condition of many of the plantations is, after all, the\r\n    best proof, and puts the matter beyond all doubt.\r\n\r\n    _4th. Concluding Suggestions_.--Having shown that tea can be grown\r\n    in the Himalayas, and that it would produce a valuable and\r\n    remunerative crop, the next great object appears to be the\r\n    production of superior tea, by means of fine varieties and improved\r\n    cultivation. It is well known that a variety of the tea plant\r\n    existed in the southern parts of China from which inferior teas only\r\n    were made. That, being more easily procured than the fine northern\r\n    varieties, from which the great mass of the best teas are made, was\r\n    the variety originally sent to India. From it all those in the\r\n    Government plantations have sprung.\r\n\r\n    It was to remedy this, and to obtain the best varieties from those\r\n    districts which furnish the trees of commerce, that induced the\r\n    Honourable Court of Directors to send me to China in 1848. Another\r\n    object was to obtain some good manufacturers and implements from the\r\n    same districts. As the result of this mission, nearly twenty\r\n    thousand plants from the best black and green tea countries of\r\n    Central China, have been introduced to the Himalayas. Six first-rate\r\n    manufacturers, two lead men, and a large supply of implements from\r\n    the celebrated Hwuy-chow districts were also brought round and\r\n    safely located on the Government plantations in the hills.\r\n\r\n    A great step has thus been gained towards the objects in view. Much,\r\n    however, remains still to be done. The new China plants ought to be\r\n    carefully propagated and distributed over all the plantations; some\r\n    of them ought also to be given to the zemindars, and more of these\r\n    fine varieties might be yearly imported from China.\r\n\r\n    The Chinese manufacturers, who were obtained some years since from\r\n    Calcutta or Assam, are, in my opinion, far from being first-rate\r\n    workmen; indeed, I doubt much if any of them learned their trade in\r\n    China. They ought to be gradually got rid of and their places\r\n    supplied by better men, for it is a great pity to teach the natives\r\n    an inferior method of manipulation. The men brought round by me are\r\n    first-rate green tea makers, they can also make black tea, but they\r\n    have not been in the habit of making so much black as green. They\r\n    have none of the Canton illiberality or prejudices about them, and\r\n    are most willing to teach their art to the natives. I have no doubt\r\n    some of the latter will soon be made excellent tea manufacturers.\r\n    And the instruction of the natives is, no doubt, one of the chief\r\n    objects which ought to be kept in view, for the importation of\r\n    Chinese manipulators at high wages can only he regarded as a\r\n    temporary measure; ultimately the Himalayan tea must be made by the\r\n    natives themselves; each native farmer must learn how to make tea\r\n    as well as how to grow it; he will then make it upon his own\r\n    premises, as the Chinese do, and the expenses of carriage will be\r\n    much less than if the green leaves had to be taken to the market.\r\n\r\n    But as the zemindars will be able to grow tea long before they are\r\n    able to make it, it would be prudent, in the first instance, to\r\n    offer them a certain sum for green leaves brought to the government\r\n    manufactory.\r\n\r\n    I have pointed out the land most suitable for the cultivation of\r\n    tea, and shown that such land exists in the Himalayas to an almost\r\n    unlimited extent. But if the object the government have in view be\r\n    the establishment of a company to develop the resources of these\r\n    hills, as in Assam, I would strongly urge the propriety of\r\n    concentrating, as much as possible, the various plantations. Sites\r\n    ought to be chosen which are not too far apart, easy of access, and,\r\n    if possible, near rivers; for, no doubt, a considerable portion of\r\n    the produce would have to be conveyed to the plains or to a\r\n    sea-port.\r\n\r\n    In my tour amongst the hills, I have seen no place so well adapted\r\n    for a central situation as Almorah, or Hawulbaugh. Here the\r\n    government has already a large establishment, and tea lands are\r\n    abundant in all directions. The climate is healthy, and better\r\n    suited to a European constitution than most other parts of India.\r\n    Here plants from nearly all the temperate parts of the world are\r\n    growing as if they were at home. As examples, I may mention myrtles,\r\n    pomegranates, and tuberoses from the south of Europe; dahlias,\r\n    potatoes, aloes, and yuccas from America; Melianthus major and bulbs\r\n    from the Cape; the cypress and deodar of the Himalayas, and the\r\n    lagerstroemias, loquats, roses and tea of China.\r\n\r\n    In these days, when tea has become almost a necessary of life to\r\n    England and her wide-spreading colonies, its production upon a large\r\n    and cheap scale is an object of no ordinary importance. But to the\r\n    natives of India themselves, the production of this article would be\r\n    of the greatest value. The poor _paharie_, or hill farmer, at\r\n    present has scarcely the common necessaries of life, and certainly\r\n    none of its luxuries. The common sorts of grain which his lands\r\n    produce will scarcely pay the carriage to the nearest market town,\r\n    far less yield a profit of such a kind as will enable him to\r\n    purchase some few of the necessary and simple luxuries of life. A\r\n    common blanket has to serve him for his covering by day and for his\r\n    bed at night, while his dwelling-house is a mere mud-hut, capable of\r\n    affording but little shelter from the inclemency of the weather.\r\n    Were part of these lands producing tea, he would then have a healthy\r\n    beverage to drink, besides a commodity which would be of great value\r\n    in the market. Being of small bulk compared with its value, the\r\n    expense of carriage would be trifling, and he would return home with\r\n    the means in his pocket of making himself and his family more\r\n    comfortable and more happy.\r\n\r\n    Were such results doubtful, we have only to look across the\r\n    frontiers of India into China. Here we find tea one of the\r\n    necessaries of life, in the strictest sense of the word. A Chinese\r\n    never drinks cold water, which he abhors, and considers unhealthy.\r\n    Tea is his favorite beverage from morning until night; not what we\r\n    call tea, mixed with milk and sugar, but the essence of the herb\r\n    itself, drawn out in pure water. One acquainted with the habits of\r\n    this people can scarcely conceive the idea of the Chinese empire\r\n    existing were it deprived of the tea plant; and I am sure that the\r\n    extensive use of this beverage adds much to the health and comfort\r\n    of the great body of the people.\r\n\r\n    The people of India are not unlike the Chinese in many of their\r\n    habits. The poor of both countries eat sparingly of animal food, and\r\n    rice, with other grains and vegetables, form the staple articles on\r\n    which they live; this being the case, it is not at all unlikely the\r\n    Indian will soon acquire a habit which is so universal in the sister\r\n    country. But in order to enable him to drink tea, it must be\r\n    produced at a cheap rate; he cannot afford to pay at the rate of\r\n    four or six shillings a pound. It must be furnished to him at four\r\n    _pence_ or six _pence_ instead; and this can be done easily, but\r\n    only on his own hills. If this is accomplished, and I see no reason\r\n    why it should not be, a boon will have been conferred upon the\r\n    people of India, of no common kind, and one which an enlightened and\r\n    liberal government may well be proud of conferring on its subjects.\"\r\n\r\nI shall now add a description of the Chinese method of making black\r\ntea in Upper Assam, by Mr. C.A. Bruce, superintendent of tea\r\nculture:--\r\n\r\n    \"In the first place, the youngest and most tender leaves are\r\n    gathered; but when there are many hands and a great quantity of\r\n    loaves to be collected, the people employed nip off with the\r\n    forefinger and thumb the fine end of the branch, with about four\r\n    leaves on, and sometimes even more if they look tender. These are\r\n    all brought to the place where they are to be converted into tea:\r\n    they are then put into a large, circular, open worked bamboo basket,\r\n    having a rim all round, two fingers broad. The leaves are thinly\r\n    scattered in these baskets, and then placed in a framework of\r\n    bamboo, in all appearance like the sides of an Indian hut, without\r\n    grass, resting on posts, 2 feet from the ground, with an angle of\r\n    about 25 deg. The baskets with leaves are put in this frame to dry\r\n    in the sun, and are pushed up and brought down by a long bamboo with\r\n    a circular piece of wood at the end. The leaves are permitted to dry\r\n    about two hours, being occasionally turned; but the time required\r\n    for this process depends on the heat of the sun. When they begin to\r\n    have a slightly withered appearance, they are taken down and brought\r\n    into the house, when they are placed on a frame to cool for half an\r\n    hour; they are then put into smaller baskets of the same kind as the\r\n    former, and placed on a stand. People are now employed to soften the\r\n    leaves still more, by gently clapping them between their hands, with\r\n    their fingers and thumbs extended, and tossing them up and letting\r\n    them fall, for about five or ten minutes. They are then again put on\r\n    the frame during half an hour, and brought down and clapped with the\r\n    hands as before. This is done three successive times, until the\r\n    leaves become to the touch like soft leather; the beating and\r\n    putting away being said to give the tea the black color and bitter\r\n    flavor. After this the tea is put into hot cast-iron pans, which are\r\n    fixed in a circular mud fireplace, so that the flame cannot ascend\r\n    round the pan to incommode the operator. This pan is well heated by\r\n    a straw or bamboo fire to a certain degree. About two pounds of the\r\n    leaves are then put into each hot pan, and spread in such a manner\r\n    that all the leaves may get the same degree of heat. They are every\r\n    now and then briskly turned with the naked hand, to prevent a leaf\r\n    from being burnt. When the leaves become inconveniently hot to the\r\n    hand, they are quickly taken out and delivered to another man with a\r\n    close-worked bamboo basket, ready to receive them. A few leaves that\r\n    may have been left behind are smartly brushed out with a bamboo\r\n    broom: all this time a brisk fire is kept up under the pan. After\r\n    the pan has been used in this manner three or four times, a bucket\r\n    of cold water is thrown in, and a soft brick-bat and bamboo broom\r\n    used, to give it a good scouring out; the water is thrown out of the\r\n    pan by the brush on one side, the pan itself being never taken off.\r\n    The leaves, all hot in the bamboo basket, are laid on a table that\r\n    has a narrow rim on its back, to prevent these baskets from slipping\r\n    off when pushed against it. The two pounds of hot leaves are now\r\n    divided into two or three parcels, and distributed to as many men,\r\n    who stand up to the table with the leaves right before them, and\r\n    each placing his legs close together, the leaves are next collected\r\n    into a ball, which he gently grasps in his left hand, with the thumb\r\n    extended, the fingers close together, and the hand resting on the\r\n    little finger. The right hand must be extended in the same manner as\r\n    the left, but with the palm turned downwards resting on the top of\r\n    the ball of tea leaves. Both hands are now employed to roll and\r\n    propel the ball along; the left hand pushing it on, and allowing it\r\n    to revolve as it moves; the right hand also pushes it forward,\r\n    resting on it with some force, and keeping it down to express the\r\n    juice which the leaves contain. The art lies here in giving the ball\r\n    a circular motion, and permitting it to turn under and in the hand\r\n    two or three whole revolutions, before the arms are extended to\r\n    their full length, and drawing the ball of leaves quickly back\r\n    without leaving a leaf behind, being rolled for about five minutes\r\n    in this way. The ball of tea leaves is from time to time delicately\r\n    and gently opened with the fingers lifted as high as the face, and\r\n    then allowed to fall again. This is done two or three times to\r\n    separate the leaves; and afterwards the basket with the leaves is\r\n    lifted up as often, and receives a circular shake to bring these\r\n    towards the centre. The leaves are now taken back to the hot pans\r\n    and spread out in them as before, being again turned with the naked\r\n    hand, and when hot taken out and rolled; after which, they are put\r\n    into a drying basket and spread on a sieve, which is in the centre\r\n    of the basket, and the whole placed over a charcoal fire. The fire\r\n    is very nicely regulated; there must not be the least smoke, and the\r\n    charcoal should be well picked.\r\n\r\n    When the fire is lighted it is fanned until it gets a fine red\r\n    glare, and the smoke is all gone off; being every now and then\r\n    stirred, and the coals brought into the centre, so as to leave the\r\n    outer edge low. When the leaves are put into the drying basket, they\r\n    are gently separated by lifting them up with the fingers of both\r\n    hands extended far apart, and allowing them to fall down again; they\r\n    are placed three or four inches deep on the sieve, leaving a passage\r\n    in the centre for the hot air to pass. Before it is put over the\r\n    fire, the drying basket receives a smart slap with both hands in the\r\n    act of lifting it up, which is done to shake down any leaves that\r\n    might otherwise drop through the sieve, or to prevent them from\r\n    falling into the fire and occasioning a smoke, which would affect\r\n    and spoil the tea. This slap on the basket is invariably applied\r\n    throughout the stages of tea manufacture. There is always a large\r\n    basket underneath to receive the small leaves that fall, which are\r\n    afterwards collected, dried, and added to the other tea; in no case\r\n    are the baskets or sieves allowed to touch or remain on the ground,\r\n    but always laid on a receiver, with three legs. After the leaves\r\n    have bean half-dried in the drying-basket, and while they are still\r\n    soft, they are taken off the fire and put into large open-worked\r\n    baskets, and then put on the shelf, in order that the tea may\r\n    improve in color.\r\n\r\n    Next day the leaves are all sorted into large, middling, and small;\r\n    sometimes there are four sorts. All these, the Chinese informed me,\r\n    become so many different kinds of teas; the smallest leaves they\r\n    call Pha-ho, the second Pow-chong, the third Souchong, and the\r\n    fourth, or the largest leaves, Zoy-chong. After this assortment they\r\n    are again put on the sieve in the drying-basket (taking care not to\r\n    mix the sorts), and on the fire, as on the preceding day; but now\r\n    very little more than will cover the bottom of the sieve is put in\r\n    at one time; the same care of the fire is taken as before, and the\r\n    same precaution of tapping the drying basket every now and then. The\r\n    tea is taken off the fire with the nicest care, for fear of any\r\n    particles of the tea falling into it. Whenever the drying-basket is\r\n    taken off, it is put on the receiver, the sieve in the drying-basket\r\n    taken out, the tea turned over, the sieve replaced, the tap given,\r\n    and the basket placed again over the fire. As the tea becomes crisp,\r\n    it is taken out and thrown into a large receiving-basket, until all\r\n    the quantity on hand has become alike dried and crisp, from which\r\n    basket it is again removed into the drying-basket, but now in much\r\n    larger quantities. It is then piled up eight and ten inches high on\r\n    the sieve in the drying-basket; in the centre a small passage is\r\n    left for the hot air to ascend; the fire that was before bright and\r\n    clear has now ashes thrown on it to deaden its effect, and the\r\n    shakings that have been collected are put on the top of all; the tap\r\n    is given, and the basket, with the greatest care, is put over the\r\n    fire. Another basket is placed over the whole, to throw back any\r\n    heat that may ascend. Now and then it is taken off, and put on the\r\n    receiver; the hands, with the fingers wide apart, are run down the\r\n    sides of the basket to the sieve, and the tea gently turned over,\r\n    the passage in the centre again made, &c., and the basket again\r\n    placed on the fire. It is from time to time examined, and when the\r\n    leaves have become so crisp that they break by the slightest\r\n    pressure of the fingers, it is taken off, when the tea is ready. All\r\n    the different kinds of leaves underwent the same operation. The tea\r\n    is now, little by little, put into boxes, and first pressed down\r\n    with the hands and then with the feet (clean stockings having been\r\n    previously put on).\r\n\r\n    There is a small room inside of the tea-house, seven cubits square,\r\n    and five high, having bamboos laid across on the top to support a\r\n    network of bamboo, and the sides of the room smeared with mud to\r\n    exclude the air. When there is wet weather, and the leaves cannot be\r\n    dried in the sun, they are laid out on the top of this room, on the\r\n    network, on an iron pan, the same as is used to heat the leaves;\r\n    some fire is put into it, either of grass or bamboo, so that the\r\n    flame may ascend high; the pan is put on a square wooden frame, that\r\n    has wooden rollers on its legs, and pushed round and round this\r\n    little room by one man, while another feeds the fire, the leaves on\r\n    the top being occasionally turned; when they are a little withered,\r\n    the fire is taken away, and the leaves brought down and manufactured\r\n    into tea, in the same manner as if it had been dried in the sun. But\r\n    this is not a good plan, and never had recourse to if it can\r\n    possibly be avoided.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1810, a number of tea plants were introduced into Brazil, with a\r\ncolony of Chinese to superintend their culture. The plantation was\r\nformed near Rio Janeiro and occupied several acres. It did not,\r\nhowever, answer the expectations formed of it, the shrubs became\r\nstunted, cankered and moss grown, and the Chinese finally abandoned\r\nthem. The culture was again tried in 1817. The plantations lie between\r\nthe equator and 10 deg. south latitude, nearly parallel with Java, and\r\nof course are exposed to the same intemperate climate, and suffer in a\r\nsimilar manner. In addition to these physical disabilities, the\r\nenterprise has had to contend with the natural indolence of the\r\nnatives, the universal repugnance to labor, the crushing effect of\r\ncommitting so important a work to the superintendence of slaves and\r\noverseers, the amazing fertility of the soil, the extent of\r\nunappropriated land, the ease with which subsistence can be obtained\r\nand the low degree of personal enterprise. These are frowning\r\nfeatures, and would rather seem to indicate a failure, before the\r\nattempt at cultivation was made. But, nevertheless, the plant does\r\nnourish to some extent, even in Brazil, under all the disparaging\r\ncircumstances which surround it. From the Brazilian Consul General, I\r\nlearn that although the plant for some years after its introduction\r\nreceived but little attention and was almost abandoned, yet within the\r\nlast few years the cultivation has revived and is now prosecuted with\r\nenergy and with a corresponding success. Some of the large and wealthy\r\nland proprietors of Brazil have directed their attention to tea\r\nculture, and one gentleman has given up his coffee plantation and\r\ndirected his attention exclusively to the cultivation of the tea\r\nplant. The market of Rio Janeiro is said to be largely and almost\r\nentirely supplied with tea of domestic growth, and the public mind is\r\nawakened to the prominent fact, that no plant cultivated in Brazil is\r\nmore profitable and none is deserving more decided attention.\r\n\r\n_Experimental cultivation of the tea plant in Brazil_.--I now proceed\r\nto notice the report of M. Guillemin, presented in 1839 to the French\r\nMinister of agriculture and commerce, on the culture and preparation\r\nof the tea plant in Brazil--in a climate of the southern hemisphere\r\njust equivalent to that of Cuba in the northern. The report enters\r\nvery minutely into the incidents of temperature and cultivation, and\r\ncannot fail to strike the attention when disclosing the important\r\nfact, that the tea plant grows luxuriantly with the coffee and other\r\nvaluable plants of the equatorial regions, and even on low-lying\r\nlands, on a level with the sea, and exposed to the full rays of a\r\nburning sun.\r\n\r\n    \"As the tea shrub,\" says M. Guillemin, \"is grown in several\r\n    plantations about two days' journey distant from Rio, in different\r\n    directions, I hired a lodging at St. Theresa, sufficiently\r\n    contiguous to all the establishments I meant to visit, and further\r\n    recommended by having a small garden attached to the house, where I\r\n    could deposit the growing plants of tea, and sow seeds. During the\r\n    month of November, except when hindered by slight indispositions\r\n    incidental to the Brazilian climate, I pursued my researches, and\r\n    principally in the charming valleys of the Tijuka and Gavia\r\n    mountains. There, together with coffee, their principal product, the\r\n    most valuable plants of the equatorial region are cultivated.\r\n\r\n    In the middle of November I had an opportunity of observing the\r\n    method pursued when culling the tea, which is performed by black\r\n    slaves, chiefly women and children. They carefully selected the\r\n    tenderest and pale-green leaves, nipping off with their nails the\r\n    young leaf bud, just below where the first or second leaf was\r\n    unfolded. One whole field had already undergone this operation;\r\n    nothing but tea shrubs stripped of their foliage remained. The\r\n    inspector assured me that the plant received no injury from this\r\n    process, and that the harvest of leaves was to become permanent by\r\n    carefully regulating it, so that the foliage should have grown again\r\n    on the first stripped shrubs at the period when the leaves of the\r\n    last plant were pulled off. About 12,000 tea shrubs are grown in\r\n    this garden: they are regularly planted in quincunxes, and stand\r\n    about one metre distant from each other; the greater number are\r\n    stunted and shabby looking, probably owing to the aspect of the\r\n    ground, which _lies low, on the level of the sea, and exposed to the\r\n    full rays of a burning sun_; perhaps the quality of the soil may\r\n    have something to do with it, though this is apparently similar to\r\n    what prevails in the province of Rio Janeiro. This soil, which is\r\n    highly argillaceous, and strongly tinged with tritoxyde of iron, is\r\n    formed by the decomposition of gneiss or granite rocks. The flat\r\n    situation of this tea ground is unfavorable to the improvement of\r\n    the soil, for the heavy rains which wash away the superfluous sand\r\n    from slanting situations, of course only consolidate more strongly\r\n    the remaining component parts, where the land lies perfectly level,\r\n    and thus the tea plants suffer from this state of soil.\r\n\r\n    The kindness of M. de Brandao, director of the Botanic Garden,\r\n    induced him to invite me, shortly after I had seen the above\r\n    described tea ground, that I might inspect all the operations for\r\n    the preparation of tea. I found that the picking of the leaves had\r\n    been commenced very early in the morning, and two kilogrammes were\r\n    pulled that were still wet with dew. These were deposited in a\r\n    well-polished iron vase, the shape being that of a very broad flat\r\n    pan, and set on a brick furnace, where a brisk wooden fire kept the\r\n    temperature nearly up to that of boiling water. A negro, after\r\n    carefully washing his hands, kept continually stirring the leaves in\r\n    all directions, till their external dampness was quite evaporated,\r\n    and the leaves acquired the softness of linen rag, and a small pinch\r\n    of them, when rolled in the hollow of the hand, became a little ball\r\n    that would not unroll. In this state the mass of tea was divided\r\n    into two portions, and a negro took each and set them on a hurdle,\r\n    formed of strips of bamboo, laid at right angles, where they shook\r\n    and kneaded the leaves in all directions for a quarter of an hour,\r\n    an operation which requires habit to be properly performed, and on\r\n    which much of the beauty of the product depends. It is impossible to\r\n    describe this process; the motion of the hands is rapid and very\r\n    irregular, and the degree of pressure requisite varies according to\r\n    circumstances; generally speaking, the young negro women are\r\n    considered more clever at this part of the work than older persons.\r\n    As this process of rolling and twisting the leaves goes on, their\r\n    green juice is drained off through the hurdle, and it is essential\r\n    that the tea be perfectly divested of the moisture, which is acrid,\r\n    and even corrosive, the bruising and kneading being especially\r\n    designed to break the parenchyma of the leaf, and permit the escape\r\n    of the sap.\r\n\r\n    When the leaves have been thus twisted and rolled, they are replaced\r\n    in the great iron pan, and the temperature raised till the hand can\r\n    no longer bear the heat at the bottom. For upwards of an hour the\r\n    negroes are then constantly employed in separating, shaking, and\r\n    throwing the foliage up and down, in order to facilitate the\r\n    dessication, and much neatness and quickness of hand were requisite,\r\n    that the manipulators might neither burn themselves nor allow the\r\n    masses of leaves to adhere to the hot bottom of the pan. It is easy\r\n    to see that, if the pan was placed within another pan filled with\r\n    boiling water, and the leaves were stirred with an iron spatula,\r\n    much trouble might be obviated. Still, the rolling and drying of the\r\n    leaves were successfully performed; they became more and more crisp,\r\n    and preserved their twisted shape, except some few which seemed too\r\n    old and coriaceous to submit to be rolled up. The tea was then\r\n    placed on a sieve, with wide apertures of regular sizes, and formed\r\n    of flat strips of bamboo. The best rolled leaves, produced from the\r\n    tips of the buds and the tenderest leaves, passed through this\r\n    sieve, and were subsequently fanned, in order to separate any\r\n    unrolled fragments which might have passed through them; this\r\n    produce was called _Imperial_, or _Uchim Tea_. It was again laid in\r\n    the pan till it acquired the leaden grey tint, which proved its\r\n    perfect dryness, and any defective leaf which had escaped the\r\n    winnowing and sifting was picked out by hand. The residue, which was\r\n    left from the first fanning, was submitted to all the operations of\r\n    winnowing, sifting, and scorching, and it then afforded the _Fine\r\n    Hyson Tea_ of commerce; while the same operations performed on the\r\n    residuum of it yielded the _Common Hyson_; and the refuse of the\r\n    third quality again afforded the _Coarse Hyson_.--Finally, the\r\n    broken and unrolled foliage, which were rejected in the last\r\n    sittings, furnish what is called _Family Tea_, and the better kind\r\n    of which is called _Chato_, and the inferior _Chuto_. The latter\r\n    sort is never sold, but kept for consumption in the families of the\r\n    growers.\r\n\r\n    Such is the mode of preparation pursued at Rio Janeiro, though I\r\n    must add that the process employed at the Botanic Garden being most\r\n    carefully performed in order to serve as a model for private\r\n    cultivators of tea, the produce is superior to the generality, so\r\n    that we dare not judge of all Brazilian tea by what is raised at the\r\n    garden of Rio. I was also assured, that at Saint Paul each grower\r\n    had his own peculiar method, influencing materially the quality of\r\n    the tea, which decided me to visit that province, where I hoped to\r\n    gain valuable information respecting the culture and fabrication of\r\n    tea, especially considered as an article of commerce.\r\n\r\n    In the interim, the month of December proving excessively hot and\r\n    rainy, so as to forbid any distant excursions, I turned my attention\r\n    to the important object of procuring _tea plants_ in number and\r\n    state fit for exportation; and, observing that almost all the shrubs\r\n    I saw were too large for this purpose, I applied to M. de Brandao\r\n    for his help and advice. This gentleman, in the most courteous\r\n    manner, offered me either seeds or slips from his own tea shrubs.\r\n    The striking of the latter was, he owned, a hazardous and uncertain\r\n    affair, though it had the probable advantage of securing a finer\r\n    kind of plant than could with certainty be raised from seed. I,\r\n    however, began by asking him for newly gathered seeds, in order to\r\n    set them in my little nursery garden at Santa Theresa, and he\r\n    obligingly gave me a thousand of the seeds, perfectly ripe and\r\n    sound, which is easily known by the purplish-brown color of their\r\n    integument. M. Houlet immediately set about preparing the soil in\r\n    which to plant these seeds, and the earth being excessively\r\n    argillaceous and hard, much digging, manuring, and dressing were\r\n    needful; in a word, we neglected no precautions which could\r\n    contribute to the growth of our seeds. In the interim I allowed not\r\n    a single dry day to elapse without visiting the country house near\r\n    Rio, in all of which I saw something more or less interesting,\r\n    either in the culture of tea, or other vegetable productions of\r\n    commercial value.\r\n\r\n        *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n    I detected, growing not unfrequently in the environs of Rio, the\r\n    _Ilex Paraguayensis_ of M. Auguste de St. Hilaire, perfectly\r\n    identical with the tree which the Jesuits planted in the missions of\r\n    Paraguay, and whose foliage is an article of great importance\r\n    throughout Spanish America, and vended under the name of _Paraguay\r\n    Tea_. A living plant of this shrub was brought home by me, and\r\n    placed in the Royal Garden at Paris, as well as a species of\r\n    Vanilla, and many other rare and interesting plants. I also made a\r\n    valuable collection of woods employed for dyeing, building, and\r\n    cabinet work, with samples of their flowers, fruits, and leaves, to\r\n    facilitate botanical determination.\r\n\r\n    Early in January, 1839, M. Houlet began anew sowing tea, not only in\r\n    the open ground in our little garden, but also in pans, in order to\r\n    facilitate the lifting of the young plants, and putting them into\r\n    the cases that I had brought for the purpose. The heat being\r\n    excessive, we purchased mats, that we might shelter them from the\r\n    sun, and we gave them water far more frequently. Many of the seeds\r\n    that we had sown a month previously, were already appearing above\r\n    the ground, but the soil being of too compact a nature, some did not\r\n    come up, which warned us to make choice in future of a lighter kind\r\n    of soil.\r\n\r\n    The period now arrived when I was to visit the tea plantations in\r\n    the province of St. Paul; and hoping that the cultivators would give\r\n    me some of the young shrubs, I took M. Houlet with me, leaving the\r\n    charge of our collections and seedlings to M. Pissis, a French\r\n    geologist and engineer, with whom I had formed an intimate\r\n    acquaintance, and who most obligingly offered to attend to them\r\n    during my absence. Many were the influential persons at Rio Janeiro,\r\n    who gave me introductory letters to the proprietors and tea growers\r\n    of St. Paul.\r\n\r\n    We started on the 15th January, by steam-boat, and in two days\r\n    reached Santos, the principal port in the province of St. Paul;\r\n    thence crossing the great chain of mountains, named the Serra do\r\n    Mar, in caravans drawn by mules, we reached the city of St. Paul on\r\n    the 20th January, where I experienced the warmest reception from the\r\n    governor, two ex-governors, and some other gentlemen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Accompanied by M.J. Gomez and a M. Barandier, an historical painter,\r\n    whom the desire to visit a new country, and to see its inhabitants,\r\n    had induced to become _my compagnon de voyage_, we visited almost\r\n    immediately a M. Feigo, ex-Regent of the Empire, and now President\r\n    of the Provincial Senate. We found this venerable ecclesiastic at\r\n    his country-house, two leagues distant from the city, and here we\r\n    saw all the process pursued on the tea leaf, commencing by the\r\n    bruising, drying, and scorching of a large quantity of foliage\r\n    picked the preceding evening. The chief difference that struck me in\r\n    the mode here adopted, was, that the tender, flexible, and not\r\n    brittle leaves, were gathered with the petiole and tip extremity of\r\n    every bud, and that some water was put with them into the iron pan,\r\n    in which the negresses twisted, squeezed, broke and shook the masses\r\n    of foliage. The operation was, on the whole, more neatly performed\r\n    than at Rio. When the tea was perfectly dry and removed from the\r\n    pan, it was placed aside in a box, shaded from the air and light,\r\n    and was considered ready for present use, on the spot; but M. Feigo\r\n    informed me, that when sent to a distance, the cases were\r\n    hermetically closed, and the tea underwent an extra dessication over\r\n    the fire.\r\n\r\n    The plantations belonging to M. Feigo, and surrounding his chagara,\r\n    are extensive, containing about 20,000 tea shrubs, of fine growth\r\n    and high vigor, most of them six or eight years old, set in regular\r\n    lines, a metre asunder from each other, and the lines with a metre\r\n    and a half between them. The soil is excellent,\r\n    argillaceo-ferruginous, as is generally the case near St. Paul.\r\n\r\n    In the Botanic Garden at St. Paul, some squares are devoted to the\r\n    growth of tea; but I am not aware that the leaves are ever subject\r\n    to preparation.\r\n\r\n    M. da Luz had invited us to inspect his tea-grounds near Nossa\r\n    Senhora da Penha, and I went thither, accompanied by Messrs.\r\n    Barandier and Houlet. The cultivation is admirable, the soil\r\n    excellent, and the tea-plants peculiarly vigorous. Each shrub was so\r\n    placed that a man can easily go all round it, and _young plants,\r\n    self-sown, were springing up below every old one_; of these offsets,\r\n    I was made welcome to as many as I could take away, and should have\r\n    had a great stock, but that the ground had been very recently\r\n    cleared. M. da Luz showed me his magazines of prepared tea, which\r\n    were extensive and well stocked.\r\n\r\n    Hence I went to the property of a lady, Donna Gertrude Gedioze\r\n    Larceda, situated at the foot of Jarigur, a mountain famed for its\r\n    gold mines, and passed two days in exploring this celebrated\r\n    locality, and then visited the Colonel Anastosio on my way back to\r\n    St. Paul. These plantations are in the most prosperous condition,\r\n    situated on a sloping and well-manured tract behind the habitations.\r\n    The shrubs are generally kept low, and frequently cut, so as to,\r\n    make them branching, by which the process of picking the leaves is\r\n    rendered easier. There may be 60,000 or 70,000 plants, but a third\r\n    of them were only set a year before. Every arrangement is\r\n    excellently conducted here; the pans kept very clean, though perhaps\r\n    rather thin from long use and the fierceness of the fires. But the\r\n    general good order that prevails, speaks much in favor of the tea\r\n    produced in this neighbourhood. The colonel showed me his warehouse,\r\n    where the tea is stored in iron jars, narrow-necked and closed by a\r\n    tight fitting stopper. I ventured to put some questions to Colonel\r\n    Anastosio respecting the sale of the produce. He gave me to\r\n    understand that he was by no means eager to sell; but, confident of\r\n    the good quality, he waited till application was made to him for it,\r\n    as the tea is thought to improve by time, and the price is kept up\r\n    by there being a small supply. With respect to the cost of its\r\n    production in Brazil, he said, this was so great that, to make it\r\n    answer to the grower, a price of not less than 2,000 reis, about six\r\n    francs (5s.), must be got for each pound. The whole labor in Brazil\r\n    is done by slaves, who certainly do not cost much to keep, but who,\r\n    on the other hand, work as little as they can help, having no\r\n    interest in the occupation. The slaves, too, bear a high price, and\r\n    the chances of mortality, with the exorbitant value of money in\r\n    Brazil, augment their selling value.\r\n\r\n    The Major da Luz kindly presented me with 300 young tea-plants,\r\n    which he had caused his negroes to pull up for me; and in an\r\n    adjoining farm, where an immense tract planted with tea is now\r\n    allowed to run to waste, being no object of value to the proprietor,\r\n    I was permitted to take all I could carry away; and in a single\r\n    day's time, M. Houlet and I, aided by some slaves, succeeded in\r\n    possessing ourselves of 3,000 young plants, which we carefully\r\n    arranged in bamboo baskets (here called cestos). To diminish the\r\n    weight, M. Houlet removed as little soil as possible; but carefully\r\n    wetted the roots before closing the baskets, and covered them with\r\n    banana leaves. In one garden, the largest I have seen devoted to the\r\n    growth of tea, but which is not particularly well kept, I saw that\r\n    the spaces between the shrubs were planted with _maize_, and the\r\n    bordering of the squares which intersect this vast plantation, and\r\n    the whole of which is inclosed with valleys of _Araucaria\r\n    Brasiliensis_, is formed of little dwarf tea-plants, which are kept\r\n    low by cutting their main shoots down to the level of the soil.\r\n\r\n    On the 8th of February I again embarked in the steam-boat to return\r\n    to Rio Janeiro, and when we came in sight of St. Sebastian, I left\r\n    M. Houlet to proceed to the city alone, charging him to take the\r\n    very greatest care of our package of tea-plants, as well as of the\r\n    nursery-ground at St. Theresa, while I should visit the flourishing\r\n    colony of Ubatuba, inhabited by French families, who cultivate most\r\n    successfully _coffee_, and other useful vegetables. After a\r\n    delightful sail through an archipelago of enchanting islands, I\r\n    landed at Pontagrossa, where I was most kindly received, and spent a\r\n    week, obtaining much and varied information, both respecting\r\n    cultivated plants and the kinds of trees which grow spontaneously in\r\n    the virgin forests of this lovely land, and afford valuable woods\r\n    for building, cabinet work, and dyeing. Finally, I visited the tea\r\n    plantations of M. Vigneron, which are remarkably fine, though their\r\n    owner finds a much more profitable employment in the growth of\r\n    _coffee_, which is very lucrative. He kindly gave me a quantity of\r\n    young tea-plants and chocolate trees. Reluctantly quitting these\r\n    worthy colonists, I re-embarked in a Brazilian galliot, which took\r\n    me back to Rio Janeiro in the close of February. There I found the\r\n    tea-plants from St. Paul, set by M. Houlet, in our garden at St.\r\n    Theresa, and I added to them the stock I had brought from Ubatuba.\r\n    All the very young ones had perished on the way, from the excessive\r\n    heat, and M. Houlet had much difficulty in saving the others.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    M. Guillemin concludes his interesting narration with this partially\r\n    discouraging fact;--that though the culture of the tea-shrub\r\n    succeeds perfectly well in Brazil; though the gathering of the\r\n    foliage proceeds with hardly any interruption during the entire\r\n    year; though the quality (setting aside the aroma, which is believed\r\n    to be artificially added) is not inferior to that of the finest tea\r\n    from China--still the growers have not realised any large profits.\r\n    They have manufactured an immense quantity of tea, to judge by what\r\n    he saw in the warehouses at St. Paul, but they cannot afford to sell\r\n    it under six francs for the half kilogramme (a pound weight), which\r\n    is higher than Chinese tea of equally good quality. This is,\r\n    however, precisely one of those commodities in which free labour,\r\n    that is, the labor of a free peasant's family, the wife and\r\n    children, the young and the old, can successfully compete with slave\r\n    labor, and considerably undersell it. It is manifest, from the\r\n    remarks of M. Guillemin, that the cost for plantation slaves, under\r\n    a system apparently so profitable as labor without wages, is a dead\r\n    weight on the Brazilian planter.\"\r\n\r\n_Paraguay Tea._--A species of holly (_Ilex Paraguensis_), which grows\r\nspontaneously in the forest regions of Paraguay, and the interior of\r\nSouth America, furnishes the celebrated beverage called _Yerba Mate_,\r\nin South America. The evergreen leaf of this plant is from four to\r\nfive inches long; when prepared for use as tea it is reduced to\r\npowder, and hence the decoction has to be quaffed by means of a tube\r\nwith a bulb perforated with small holes.\r\n\r\nThe leaves yield the same bitter principle called theine, which is\r\nfound in the leaf of the Chinese tea-plant, the coffee berry, &c.\r\nVarious other species of Ilex are sometimes employed in other parts of\r\nSouth America for a similar purpose. Although the leaves may not\r\ncontain as much of the agreeable narcotic oil as those of the China\r\nshrub, in consequence of the rude way in which it is collected and\r\nprepared for use, yet it is much relished by European travellers in\r\nSouth America, and would doubtless enter largely into consumption if\r\nimported into this country at a moderate rate of duty.\r\n\r\nThe consumption in the various South American Republics is estimated\r\nat thirty or forty millions of pounds annually. It is generally drank\r\nwithout sugar or milk.\r\n\r\nThere are no correct data for calculating the exports, but some\r\nauthorities state the amount sent to Santa Fe and Buenos Ayres at\r\neight millions of pounds.\r\n\r\nA great trade is carried on with it at Sta. Fe, where it is brought\r\nfrom the Rio de la Plata. There are two sorts, one called \"Yerba de\r\nPalos,\" the other, which is finer, \"Yerba de Carnini.\" Frezier tells\r\nus that, in the earlier part of the 17th century, above 50,000\r\narrobas, or more than 12,000 cwt. of this herb were brought into Peru\r\nfrom Paraguay, exclusive of about 25,000 arrobas taken to Chile; and\r\nFather Charleroix, in his \"History of Paraguay,\" states the quantity\r\nshipped to Peru annually at 100,000 arrobas, or nearly 2,500,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nMy friend, Mr. W.P. Robertson, has favored me with some details as to\r\nthe production of Paraguay tea. His brother has graphically described\r\na visit he paid to the wastes or woods of the Yerba tree, with a\r\ncolony of manufacturers from Assumption. These woods were situated\r\nchiefly in the country adjacent to a small miserable town called Villa\r\nReal, about 150 miles higher up the river Paraguay than Assumption.\r\nThe master manufacturer, with about forty or fifty hired peons or\r\nservants, mounted on mules, and a hundred bulls and sumpter mules, set\r\nout on their expedition, and having discovered in the dense wood a\r\nsuitable locality, forthwith a settlement is established, and the\r\nnecessary wigwams for dwellings, &c., run up. The next step is the\r\nconstruction of the \"tatacua.\" This was a small space of ground,\r\nabout six feet square, of which the soil was beaten down with heavy\r\nmallets, till it became a hard and consistent foundation. At the four\r\ncorners of this space, and at right angles, were driven in four very\r\nstrong stakes, while upon the surface of it were laid large logs of\r\nwood. This was the place at which the leaves and small sprigs of the\r\nyerba tree, when brought from the woods, were first scorched--fire\r\nbeing set to the logs of wood within it. By the side of the tatacua\r\nwas spread an ample square net of hidework, of which, after the\r\nscorched leaves were laid upon it, a peon gathered up the four corners\r\nand proceeded with his burthen on his shoulders to the second place\r\nconstructed, the barbacue. This was an arch of considerable span, and\r\nof which the support consisted of three strong trestles. The centre\r\ntrestle formed the highest part of the arch. Over this superstructure\r\nwere laid cross-bars strongly railed to stakes on either side of the\r\ncentral supports, and so formed the roof of the arch. The leaves being\r\nseparated after the tatacua process, from the grosser boughs of the\r\nyerba tree, were laid on this roof, under which a large fire was\r\nkindled. Of this fire the flames ascended, and still further scorched\r\nthe leaves of the yerba. The two peons beneath the arch, with long\r\npoles, took care, as far as they could, that no ignition should take\r\nplace; and in order to extinguish this, when it did occur, another\r\npeon was stationed at the top of the arch. Along both sides of this\r\nthere were two deal planks, and, with a long stick in his hand, the\r\npeon ran along these planks, and instantly extinguished any incipient\r\nsparks of fire that appeared.\r\n\r\nWhen the yerba was thoroughly scorched, the fire was swept from the\r\nbarbacue or arch; the ground was then swept, and pounded with heavy\r\nmallets, into the hardest and smoothest substance. The scorched leaves\r\nand very small twigs were then thrown down from the roof of the arch,\r\nand, by means of a rude wooden mill, ground to powder.\r\n\r\nThe yerba or tea was now ready for use; and being conveyed to a larger\r\nshed, previously erected for the purpose, was then received, weighed,\r\nand stored by the overseer. The next and last process, and the most\r\nlaborious of all, was that of packing the tea. This was done by first\r\nsewing together, in a square form, the half of a bull's hide, which\r\nbeing still damp, was fastened by two of its corners to two strong\r\ntrestles, driven far into the ground. The packer then, with an\r\nenormous stick, made of the heaviest wood, and having a huge block at\r\none end, and a pyramidal piece to give it a greater impulse at the\r\nother, pressed, by repeated efforts, the yerba into the hide sack,\r\ntill he got it full to the brim. It then contained from 200 to 250\r\npounds, and being sewed up, and left to tighten over the contents as\r\nthe hide dried, it formed at the end of a couple of days, by exposure\r\nto the sun, a substance as hard as stone, and almost as weighty and\r\nimpervious too.\r\n\r\nHaving described the process of making ready the yerba for use, we\r\nwill now accompany Mr. Robertson to the woods, to see how it is\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\n    \"After all the preparations which I have detailed were completed\r\n    (and it required only three days to finish them), the peons sallied\r\n    forth from the yerba colony by couples. I accompanied two of the\r\n    stoutest and best of them. They had with them no other weapon than a\r\n    small axe; no other clothing than a girdle round their waist and a\r\n    red cap on their head; no other provision than a cigar, and a cow's\r\n    horn filled with water; and they were animated by no other hope or\r\n    desire, that I could perceive, than those of soon discovering a part\r\n    of the wood thickly studded with the yerba tree. They also desired\r\n    to find it as near as possible to the colonial encampment, in order\r\n    that the labor of carrying the rough branches to the scene of\r\n    operations might be as much as possible diminished.\r\n\r\n    We had scarcely skirted for a quarter of a mile the woods which shut\r\n    in the valley where we were bivouacked, when we came upon numerous\r\n    clumps of the yerba tree. It was of all sizes, from that of the\r\n    shrub to that of the full-grown orange tree; the leaves of it were\r\n    very like those of that beautiful production. The smaller the plant,\r\n    the better is the tea which is taken from it considered to be.\r\n\r\n    To work with their hatchets went the peons, and in less than a\r\n    couple of hours they had gathered a mountain of branches, and piled\r\n    them up in the form of a haystack. Both of them then filled their\r\n    large ponchos with the coveted article of commerce in its raw state,\r\n    and they marched off with their respective loads. Having deposited\r\n    this first load within the precincts of the colony, the peons\r\n    returned for a second, and so on till they had cleared away the\r\n    whole mass of branches and of leaves cut and collected during that\r\n    day. When I returned to the colony I found the peons coming by two\r\n    and two, from every part of the valley, all laden in the same way.\r\n    There were twenty tatacuas, twenty barbacues, and twenty pies of the\r\n    yerba cut and ready for manufacture. Two days after that the whole\r\n    colony was in a blaze, tatacuas and barbacues were enveloped in\r\n    smoke; on the third day all was stowed away in the shed; and on the\r\n    fourth the peons again went out to procure more of the boughs and\r\n    leaves.\"--(_Letters on Paraguay_, vol. ii. p. 142-147).\r\n\r\nEach peon or laborer, going into the woods for six months, can procure\r\neight arrobas, or 200 lbs. of yerba a day. This, at the rate of two\r\nrials, or 1s. for each arroba, would make his wages per day 8s.; and\r\nthis for six months' work, at six days in the week, would produce to\r\nthe laborer a sum of £57 12s.\r\n\r\nWilcockes, in his \"History of Buenos Ayres,\" published in 1807,\r\nstates:--\"Though the herb is principally bought by the merchants of\r\nBuenos Ayres, it is not to that place that it is carried, no more\r\nbeing sent thither than is wanted for the consumption of its\r\ninhabitants and those of the vicinity; but the greatest part is\r\ndispatched to Santa Fe and Cordova, thence to be forwarded to Potosi\r\nand Mendoza. The quantity exported to Peru is estimated at 100,000\r\narrobas, and to Chile 40,000. The remainder is consumed in Paraguay,\r\nTucuman, and the other provinces. It is conveyed in parcels of six or\r\nseven arrobas, by waggons, from Santa Fe to Jugui, and thence by mules\r\nto Potosi, La Paz, and into Peru proper. About four piastres per\r\narroba is the price in Paraguay, and at Potosi it fetches from eight\r\nto nine, and more in proportion as it is carried further.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGAR.\r\n\r\nSugar is obtained from many grasses; and, indeed, is common in a large\r\nnumber of plants. It is procured in Italy from _Sorghum saccharatum_;\r\nin China, from _Saccharum sinense_; in Brazil, from _Gynerium\r\nsaccharoides_; in the West Indies, from _saccharum violaceum_; and in\r\nmany other parts of the world from _S officinarrum_. The last two are\r\ncommonly known as sugar canes, and they are generally considered as\r\nvarieties of a single species, _S. officinarum_, which is now widely\r\nspread over different parts of the world.\r\n\r\nSome curious specimens of palm sugars were exhibited at the Great\r\nExhibition of 1851, among others,--gomuti palm sugar (_Arenga\r\nsaccharifera_) from Java; date palm sugar, from the Deccan; nipa\r\nsugar, from the stems of _Nipa fruticans_, and sugar from the fleshy\r\nflowers of _Bassia latifolia_,--an East Indian tree.\r\n\r\nAmong the other sugars shown were beet root sugar, maple sugar, date\r\nsugar, from Dacca, sugar from the butter tree (_Bassia butyracea_),\r\nproduced in the division of Rohekkund, in India; and sugar candy,\r\ncrystallized by the natives of Calcutta and other parts of India.\r\n\r\nSugar and molasses from the grape, were also shown from Spain, Tunis\r\nand the Zollverein.\r\n\r\nSugar, or sugar candy, has been made in China from very remote\r\nantiquity, and large quantities have been exported from India, in all\r\nages, whence it is most probable that it found its way to Rome.\r\n\r\nThe principal impurities to be sought for in cane sugar are inorganic\r\nmatter, water, molasses, farina, and grape, or starch sugar. The\r\nlatter substance is occasionally, for adulterating purposes, added in\r\nEurope to cane sugar; it may be detected by the action of concentrated\r\nsulphuric acid and of a solution of caustic potassa; the former\r\nblackens cane sugar, but does not affect the starch sugar, while\r\npotassa darkens the color of starch sugar, but does not alter that of\r\ncane sugar. But the copper test is far more delicate. Add to the\r\nsolution to be tested, a few drops of blue vitriol, and then a\r\nquantity of potassa solution, and apply heat; if the cane sugar is\r\npure, the liquor will remain blue, while, if it be adulterated with\r\nstarch sugar, it will assume a reddish yellow color.\r\n\r\nInorganic matter is determined by incineration, farina by the iodine\r\ntest, water by drying at 210 deg., and molasses by getting rid of it\r\nby re-crystalization from alcohol, as also by the color and moisture\r\nof the article.\r\n\r\nThe natural impurities of sugar are gum and tannin; gum is detected by\r\ngiving a white precipitate with diacetate of lead, and tannin by\r\ngiving a black coloration or precipitate with persulphate of iron.\r\n\r\nAn experienced sugar dealer easily judges of the value of sugar by the\r\ntaste, smell, specific gravity, moisture and general appearance.\r\n\r\nThe value of molasses may be determined by drying at 220 degs., and by\r\nthe taste.\r\n\r\nThe commercial demand for sugar is mainly supplied from the juice of\r\nthe cane, which contains it in greater quantity and purity than any\r\nother plant, and offers the greatest facilities for its extraction.\r\n\r\nAlthough sugar, identical in its character, exists in the maple, the\r\ncoco-nut, maize, the beet root, and mango, and is economically\r\nobtained from these to a considerable extent, yet it is not\r\nsufficiently pure to admit of ready separation from the foreign matter\r\ncombined with it, at least by the simple mechanical means, the\r\nordinary producers usually have at command; unless carried onto a\r\nlarge extent, and with suitable machinery and chemical knowledge and\r\nappliances.\r\n\r\nThe different species of commercial sugar usually met with in this\r\ncountry, are four, viz:--brown, or muscovado sugar (commonly called\r\nmoist sugar); clayed sugar, refined or loaf sugar, and sugar candy;\r\nthese varieties are altogether dependent on the difference in the\r\nmethods employed in their manufacture.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the sugar cane, and the manufacture of sugar, were\r\nintroduced into Europe from the East, by the Saracens, soon after\r\ntheir conquests, in the ninth century. It is stated by the Venetian\r\nhistorians, that their countrymen imported sugar from Sicily, in the\r\ntwelfth century, at a cheaper rate than they could obtain it from\r\nEgypt, where it was then extensively made. The first plantations in\r\nSpain were at Valencia; but they were extended to Granada, Mercia,\r\nPortugal, Madeira, and the Canary Islands, as early as the beginning\r\nof the fifteenth century. From Gomera, one of these islands, the sugar\r\ncane was introduced into the West Indies, by Columbus, in his second\r\nvoyage to America in 1493. It was cultivated to some extent in St.\r\nDomingo in 1506, where it succeeded better than in any of the other\r\nislands. In 1518, there were twenty-eight plantations in that colony,\r\nestablished by the Spaniards, where an abundance of sugar was made,\r\nwhich, for a long period, formed the principal part of the European\r\nsupplies. Barbados, the oldest English settlement in the West Indies,\r\nbegan to export sugar in 1646, and as far back as the year 1676 the\r\ntrade required four hundred vessels, averaging one hundred and fifty\r\ntons burden.\r\n\r\nThe common sugar cane is a perennial plant, very sensitive to cold,\r\nand is, therefore, restricted in its cultivation to regions bordering\r\non the tropics, where there is little or no frost. In the Eastern\r\nhemisphere its production is principally confined to situations\r\nfavorable to its growth, lying between the fortieth parallel of north\r\nlatitude and a corresponding degree south. On the Atlantic side of\r\nthe Western continent, it will not thrive beyond the thirty-third\r\ndegree of north latitude and the thirty-fifth parallel south. On the\r\nPacific side it will perfect its growth some five degrees further\r\nnorth or south. From the flexibility of this plant, it is highly\r\nprobable that it is gradually becoming more hardy, and will eventually\r\nendure an exposure and yield a profitable return much further north,\r\nalong the borders of the Mississippi and some of its tributaries, than\r\nit has hitherto been produced. In most parts of Louisiana the canes\r\nyield three crops from one planting. The first season is denominated\r\n\"plant cane,\" and each of the subsequent growths, \"ratoons.\" But,\r\nsometimes, as on the prairies of Attakapas and Opelousas, and the\r\nhigher northern range of its cultivation, it requires to be replanted\r\nevery year. Within the tropics, as in the West Indies and elsewhere,\r\nthe ratoons frequently continue to yield abundantly for twelve or\r\nfifteen years from the same roots.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of this plant is principally confined to the West\r\nIndies, Venezuela, Brazil, Mauritius, British India, China, Japan, the\r\nSunda, Phillippine, and Sandwich Islands, and to the southern\r\ndistricts of the United States. The varieties most cultivated in the\r\nlatter are the striped blue and yellow ribbon, or Java, the red\r\nribbon, violet, from Java, the Creole, crystalline or Malabar, the\r\nOtaheite, the purple, the yellow, the purple-banded, and the grey\r\ncanes. The quantity of sugar produced on an acre varies from five\r\nhundred to three thousand pounds, averaging, perhaps, from eight\r\nhundred to one thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nSix to eight pounds of the saccharine juice of the plant, yield one\r\npound of raw sugar; from 16 to 20 cart-loads of canes, ought to make a\r\nhogshead of sugar, if thoroughly ripe. The weight necessary to\r\nmanufacture 10,000 hhds of sugar, is usually estimated at 250,000\r\ntons, or 25 tons per hhd. of 15 or 16 cwt.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of sugar now produced in our colonies is in excess of the\r\ndemands of the consumers, that is, of their demands cramped as they\r\nare by the duties still levied on sugar consumed in Great Britain,\r\nimposed for the purposes of revenue; the high duty on all other but\r\nindigenous sugar, consumed all over the continent, imposed to promote\r\nthe manufacture of beet-root sugar, and the legal duty levied on all\r\nother than indigenous sugar used in the United States, for the purpose\r\nof protecting the sugar production of that country; and so long as\r\nthat excess exists---until a further reduction of duties shall\r\nincrease consumption and cause sugar to be used for many purposes\r\nwhich the present high rates prohibit its being applied to--any\r\nimprovement which may be effected in the quality--any increase which\r\nmay take place in the quantity of colonial sugar--will only result\r\ninfinitely more to the benefits of the consumers than the producers.\r\nIn 1700 the quantity consumed in Great Britain and Ireland was only\r\nabout 200,000 cwt. In 1852, including molasses, &c., it was not less\r\nthan 8,000,000 cwt., a forty-fold increase in the century and a-half.\r\nTaking the whole population last year, it was nearly 28 lbs. per\r\nhead. In 1832 the consumption in Great Britain alone was put down by\r\nMr. M'Culloch at 23 lbs.; and as my estimate includes Ireland, where\r\nthe consumption is notoriously small, we may infer that it has\r\nincreased in Great Britain since 1832 at least 5 lb. per head. As the\r\nallowance to servants is from ¾ lb. to 1 lb. per week, it may be\r\nassumed that 50 lb. a year, at least, is not too much for grown\r\npersons. In sugar-producing countries the quantity consumed is\r\nenormous; the labourers live on it in the manufacturing season; and a\r\nDuke of Beaufort, who died about 1720, consumed one pound daily for\r\nforty years, and enjoyed excellent health till he was seventy years of\r\nage. The consumption of sugar has increased considerably since it has\r\nbecome cheap; and we may expect, therefore, that the consumption will\r\nextend more rapidly than ever. The whole quantity consumed in Europe\r\nlast year, including beet-root sugar, was not less than 16,000,000\r\ncwt. If peace be preserved and prosperity continue, the market for\r\nsugar will extend amazingly, and force the cultivation by free men in\r\nall tropical countries.\r\n\r\n             British    East India and   Total of B.P.\r\n  Years.

The greatest impetus was given to foreign sugar\r\nwhen the duties were reduced, in 1846.\r\n\r\nThe extension of sugar cultivation in various countries where the\r\nclimate is suitable, has recently attracted considerable attention\r\namong planters and merchants. The Australian Society of Sydney offered\r\nits Isis Gold Medal recently to the person who should have planted,\r\nbefore May, 1851, the greatest number of sugar canes in the colony. I\r\nhave not heard whether any claim was put in for the premium, but I\r\nfear that the gold fever has diverted attention from any new\r\nagricultural pursuit, and that honorary gold medals are therefore\r\nunappreciated. Moreton Bay and the northern parts of the colony of New\r\nSouth Wales, are admirably suited to the growth of all descriptions of\r\ntropical products.\r\n\r\nThe Natal Agricultural Society is also making great exertions to\r\npromote sugar culture in that settlement. Mr. E. Morewood, one of the\r\noldest colonists, has about 100 acres under cultivation with the cane,\r\nand I have seen some very excellent specimens of the produce,\r\nnotwithstanding the want of suitable machinery to grind the cane and\r\nboil the juice. Many planters from the East Indies and Mauritius are\r\nsettling there. His Royal Highness Prince Albert awarded, through the\r\nSociety of Arts, a year or two ago, a gold medal, worth 100 guineas,\r\nto Mr. J.A. Leon, for his beautiful work descriptive of new and\r\nimproved machinery and processes employed in the cultivation and\r\npreparation of sugar in the British colonies, designed to economise\r\nlabor and increase production.\r\n\r\nThe centrifugal machines, recently brought into use, for separating\r\nthe molasses from the sugar, more quickly than the old-fashioned\r\nmethod of coolers, have tended to cheapen the production and simplify\r\nthe processes of sugar making. The planters object, however, to the\r\nhigh prices which they are charged for these machines, so simple in\r\ntheir construction; and that they are not allowed, by the patent laws,\r\nto obtain them in the cheaper markets of France and Belgium.\r\n\r\nGreat loss has hitherto taken place annually, in the sugar colonies,\r\nthrough the drainage of the molasses, resulting from the imperfect\r\nprocesses in use; but this can now be obviated, by the use of the\r\ncentrifugal machine. It is a modification of the \"hydro-extractor,\"\r\nand is the invention of Mr. Finzel, of Bristol.\r\n\r\nThe machine being filled with sugar, appropriately placed, is rapidly\r\nrevolved, and a powerful ceutrifugal force generated; the moisture is\r\nspeedily removed to the circumference of the revolving vessel, and\r\npasses off through apertures adapted for the purpose.\r\n\r\nVarious other improvements in the making of sugar have been carried\r\ninto effect within the last few years, by Dr. Scoffern, Messrs. Oxland\r\nand M. Melsens, but the description of these would occupy too much of\r\nmy space, and those who are desirous of growing sugar on an extensive\r\nscale, I must refer to Dr. Evans' \"Sugar Planter's Manual,\" Mr. Wray's\r\n\"Practical Sugar Planter,\" Agricola's \"Letters on Sugar Farming,\" and\r\nother works which treat largely and exclusively of the subject.\r\n\r\nAn announcement has recently been made, that a Mr. Ramos, of Porto\r\nRico, has discovered some new dessicating agent, to be used in sugar\r\nmaking, which is to cost next to nothing, but improves most materially\r\nthe quality of the sugar made, and also increases considerably the\r\nquantity obtained by the ordinary process.\r\n\r\nThe average annual quantity of cane sugar produced and sent into the\r\nmarkets of the civilised world, at the present time, may be taken at\r\n1,500,000 tons, exclusive of the amount grown and manufactured for\r\nlocal consumption in India, China, Cochin-China, and the Malay\r\nArchipelago, of which no certain statistics exist, but which has been\r\nestimated at about another million tons.\r\n\r\nSo far back as 1844, the Calcutta \"Star,\" in an article on sugar,\r\nestimated the domestic consumption in India, at 500,000 tons. This is\r\nconsiderably below the mark, even if India is taken in its limited\r\nsignification, as including only British subjects. On this estimate\r\nthe 94,000,000 of British subjects, men, women and children, would not\r\nindividually consume more than one pound avoirdupois by the month. A\r\nfat, hungry Brahmin, at any of the festivals given by the great, will\r\ndigest for his own share four pounds, without at all embarrassing his\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nAssuming the million and a half of tons that find their way into\r\ncivilized markets, to represent an average value at the place of\r\nproduction of £15 per ton, we have here the representation of\r\n£22,500,000 sterling. But this value may fairly be increased by\r\none-fourth.\r\n\r\nThe whole exportable production of the sugar-growing countries was\r\nfound to be, in 1844, about 780,000 tons, of which Cuba furnished\r\n200,000 tons. In 1845, notwithstanding Cuba only produced 80,000 tons,\r\nthe increase from other sources was so considerable (namely:--the\r\nBritish Colonial supply 40,000, United States 40,000, Porto Rico\r\n15,000, Brazil 10,000 tons) that the total produce fell very little\r\nshort of the previous year--having reached 764,000 tons.\r\n\r\nThe present SUPPLY of sugar to the markets of Europe, is nearly as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n                                Cwts.\r\n  England                    8,000,000\r\n  France                     2,550,000\r\n  German League              1,350,000\r\n  Prussia                      220,000\r\n  Austria, (ten Provinces)     560,000\r\n  Belgium                      294,000\r\n  Other States not defined.\r\n\r\nThe present DEMAND, according to the estimated consumption per head\r\n(28 lbs.), found to exist in England, where taxation is favorable, and\r\nthe price moderate, would be about 3¼; million tons, viz.:--\r\n\r\n                               Cwts.\r\n  England                    8,000,000\r\n  France                     8,875,000\r\n  Germany                    5,750,000\r\n  Prussia                    4,100,000\r\n  Austria                    8,642,857\r\n  Belgium                    1,250,000\r\n  Russia                    15,250,000\r\n  Rest of Europe            12,500,000\r\n\r\nThe whole annual PRODUCTION of the world is estimated by another party\r\nat 1,471,000,000 lbs., of which the United States produce 150,000,000\r\nlbs., including 40,000,000 lbs. of maple sugar. Of the whole amount of\r\nsugar produced, Europe consumes about 648,700 tons, divided nearly as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n                               lbs.\r\n  Great Britain             803,360,096\r\n  France                    160,080,000\r\n  Belgium                    19,840,000\r\n  Netherlands                42,000,000\r\n  Russia                     70,000,000\r\n  Denmark and Sweden         22,000,000\r\n  German Zollverein         101,300,000\r\n  Other parts of Germany    160,000,000\r\n  Austria                    50,000,000\r\n                          -------------\r\n                          1,428,580,096\r\n\r\nThe following figures show the quantities of raw sugar in general, in\r\ntons, imported into the British markets for the last five years,\r\ncompared with consumption:--\r\n\r\n               Entire          British\r\n  Years.

The American\r\nconsumption, which in 1851 amounted to 133,000 tons of sugar cane\r\nreached last year a total of 321,000 tons, almost as much as England\r\nconsumed--358,000--and more than the consumption of 100,000,000 of\r\npersons on the continent.\r\n\r\nThe whole production of tropical sugar, is about one million and\r\na-half tons, while the consumption is probably two million tons; but\r\nthe manufacture of sugar from beet root, maple and other sources,\r\nsupplies the deficiency.\r\n\r\nThe total quantities of sugar, and molasses as sugar, consumed in the\r\nUnited Kingdom in the last six years, were, according to a\r\nParliamentary paper, No. 292, of the last session, as follows:--\r\n\r\n            Cwt. sugar.      Cwt. molasses.\r\n  1847       4,723,232         1,256,421\r\n  1848       5,003,318           865,752\r\n  1849       5,283,729         1,021,065\r\n  1850       5,570,461           752,027\r\n  1851       5,043,872         1,522,405\r\n  1852       7,203,631           799,942\r\n\r\nThe returns further specify that the annual average consumption of\r\n_British colonial sugar_, in the five years ending 1851, was 5,124,922\r\ncwt.; and in the five years ending 1846, was 4,579,054 cwt.; the\r\naverage consumption of British colonial sugar, has, therefore,\r\nexceeded in the five years since the duties were reduced, in 1846, the\r\naverage consumption for the five previous years by 545,868 cwt. per\r\nannum; or in the aggregate in the five years, the excess has been\r\n3,239,338 cwt. The quantity consumed in the year ending December,\r\n1852, was 4,033,879 cwt.[16] There can be no doubt whatever, that the\r\nconsumption of sugar in Great Britain is capable of very large\r\nincrease; moderate cost, and the removal of restrictions to its\r\ngeneral use, being the main elements required to bring it about. The\r\nquestion of revenue must of course be a material consideration with\r\nGovernment; but recent experience certainly leads to the conclusion\r\nthat it would not suffer under a further reduction of duty.\r\n\r\nThe revenue derived from sugar before the reduction of the duty, was\r\nfive millions per annum; in the past two years it reached nearly four\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\nThe reduction in duties which took place in 1845, may be said to have\r\nanswered the expectations formed of it, as regards the increase of\r\nconsumption, which there is no doubt would have even gone beyond the\r\nestimate, if the failure in the crop of sugar in Cuba--that most\r\nimportant island, which usually yields one-fifth of the cane crop of\r\nthe whole world--had not driven up prices in the general market of the\r\ncontinent, and, in consequence, diverted the supply of free labor\r\nsugar from this country. As it was, however, the consumption of the\r\nUnited Kingdom, which in 1844 was 206,472 tons, in 1845 was not less\r\nthan 243,000--Sir Robert Peel's estimate was 250,000 tons--the average\r\nreduction in price to the consumer during the latter year having been\r\n20 per cent. The large increase in subsequent years I have already\r\nshown.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of sugar we find, then, has been steadily and rapidly\r\nincreasing in this country, and if we add together to the refined and\r\nraw sugar and molasses used, it will be seen that the consumption of\r\n1852 amounted to 400,178 tons; which is at the rate of 29 lbs. per\r\nhead of the population per annum. Whilst the quantity retained for\r\nhome consumption in the United Kingdom, in 1844; was but 4,130,000\r\ncwt., the amount had risen in 1852 to upwards of 8,000,000 cwt.\r\n\r\nSugar unrefined, entered for home consumption.\r\n\r\n               Colonial Raw.

The\r\nplanters complain of the fall of price; and the only question in\r\ndispute is whether the fall has been occasioned by the reduction of\r\nthe duties. Now the reduction of duties subsequent to 1846 and to\r\n1851, was, on brown Muscovado sugar, from 13s. to 10s., or 3s.; and on\r\nforeign, from 21s. 7d. to 16s. 4d., or 5s. 3d. At the same time there\r\nwas a very large increase of consumption, and the price, as of almost\r\nall articles, would not have been reduced to the full extent of the\r\nreduction of the duties, and certainly not reduced in a much greater\r\ndegree, had there not been other causes at work to reduce the price.\r\nBetween 1846 and 1851 freight from the Mauritius fell from £4 1s. 8d.\r\nto £2 13s. 9d., or 35 per cent.; and that reduction of price was not\r\nmade from the planter. In the interval, too, great improvements were\r\nmade in the manufacture of sugar; and in proportion as the article was\r\nproduced cheaper, it could be sold cheaper, without any loss to him.\r\n\r\nI shall now take a separate review of the capabilities and progress of\r\nthe leading sugar producing countries.\r\n\r\n_Production in the United States_.--Sugar cultivation, in the United\r\nStates, is a subject of increasing interest. The demand is rapidly\r\nadvancing. Its production in the State of Louisiana, to which it is\r\nthere principally confined, is a source of much wealth. In 1840, the\r\nnumber of slaves employed in sugar culture was 148,890, and the\r\nproduct, 119,947 hhds. of 1,000 lbs. each; besides 600,000 gallons of\r\nmolasses. Last year, the crop exceeded 240,000 hhds., worth 12,000,000\r\nof dollars. The capital now employed, is 75,000,000 of dollars. The\r\nprotection afforded by the American tariff, has greatly increased the\r\nproduction of sugar in the United States. From 1816 to 1850, this\r\nincrease was from 15,000 hhds. to 250,000 hhds.\r\n\r\nIn 1843, the State of Louisiana had 700 plantations, 525 in\r\noperation, producing about 90,000 hhds. In 1844, the number of\r\nhogsheads was 191,324, and of pounds, 204,913,000; but this was\r\nexclusive of the molasses, rated at 9,000,000 gallons. In 1845 there\r\nwere in Louisiana 2,077 sugar plantations, in 25 parishes; 1,240 sugar\r\nhouses, 630 steam power, 610 working horse power; and the yield of\r\nsugar was 186,650 hhds., or 207,337,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the sugar cane into Florida, Texas, California,\r\nand Louisiana, probably dates back to their earliest settlement by the\r\nSpaniards or French. It was not cultivated in the latter, however, as\r\na staple product before the year 1751, when it was introduced, with\r\nseveral negroes, by the Jesuits, from St. Domingo. They commenced a\r\nsmall plantation on the banks of the Mississippi, just above the old\r\ncity of New Orleans. The year following, others, cultivated the plant\r\nand made some rude attempts at the manufacture of sugar. In 1758, M.\r\nDubreuil established a sugar estate on a large scale, and erected the\r\nfirst sugar mill in Louisiana, in what is now the lower part of New\r\nOrleans. His success was followed by other plantations, and in the\r\nyear 1765 there was sugar enough manufactured for home consumption;\r\nand in 1770, sugar had become one of the staple products of the\r\ncolony. Soon after the revolution a large number of enterprising\r\nadventurers emigrated from the United States to Lower Louisiana,\r\nwhere, among other objects of industry, they engaged in the\r\ncultivation of cane, and by the year 1803 there were no less than\r\neighty-one sugar estates on the Delta alone. Since that period, while\r\nthe production of cane sugar has been annually increasing at the\r\nsouth, the manufacture of maple sugar has been extending in the north\r\nand west.\r\n\r\nHitherto, the amount of sugar and molasses consumed in the United\r\nStates has exceeded the quantities produced--consequently there has\r\nbeen no direct occasion for their exportation. In the year 1815 it was\r\nestimated that the sugar made on the banks of the Mississippi amounted\r\nto 10,000,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nAccording to the census of 1840, the amount of cane and maple sugar\r\nproduced in the United States was 155,100,089 lbs., of which\r\n119,947,720 lbs. were raised in Louisiana. By the census of 1850, the\r\ncane sugar made in the United States was 247,581,000 lbs., besides\r\n12,700,606 gallons of molasses; maple sugar, 34,249,886 lbs., showing\r\nan increase, in ten years, of 126,730,077 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe culture and manufacture of sugar from the cane, with the exception\r\nof a small quantity produced in Texas, centres in the State of\r\nLouisiana--where the cane is now cultivated and worked into sugar in\r\ntwenty-four parishes. The extent of sugar lands available in those\r\nparishes is sufficient to supply the whole consumption of the United\r\nStates. Sugar cultivation was carried on in Louisiana to a small\r\nextent before its cession to the United States. In 1818 the crop had\r\nreached 25,000 hogsheads. In 1834-35 it was 110,000 hogsheads, and in\r\n1844-45 204,913 hogsheads. Each hogshead averaging 1,000 lbs. net,\r\nand yielding from 45 to 50 gallons of molasses.\r\n\r\nThe number of sugar estates in operation in 1830, was 600. The manual\r\npower employed on these plantations, was 36,091 slaves, 282\r\nsteam-engines, and 406 horse power. The capital invested being\r\nestimated at 50 million dollars. In 1844 the estates had increased to\r\n762, employing 50,670 slaves, 468 steam-engines, 354 horse power.\r\n\r\nThe sugar-cane is now cultivated on both branches of the Mississippi\r\nfrom 57 miles below New Orleans to nearly 190 miles above. The whole\r\nnumber of sugar houses in the State is 1,536, of which 865 employ\r\nsteam, and the rest horse power.\r\n\r\nThe crop of 1849-50 was 247,923 hhds. of 1,000 lbs., which, at an\r\naverage of 3½ cents., amounted to nearly 9½ million dollars. The\r\nquantity of molasses produced was more than 12 million gallons, worth,\r\nat 20 cents the gallon, about 2,400,000 dollars, giving a total value\r\nof close upon 12 million dollars, or an average to each of the 1,455\r\nworking sugar houses of 8,148 dollars.\r\n\r\nThe overflow of the Mississippi and Red Rivers in 1850, shortened the\r\ncrop near 20,000 hhds., and was felt in subsequent years. Since 1846,\r\nnot less than 355 sugar mills and engines have been erected in this\r\nState. The sugar crop of 1851-52 was 236,547 hhds., produced by 1,474\r\nsugar houses, 914 of which were worked by steam, and the rest by\r\nhorse-power. Texas raises about 8,000 to 10,000 hhds. of sugar, and\r\nFlorida and Georgia smaller quantities.\r\n\r\nIn the year ending December, 1851, there were taken for consumption in\r\nthe United States about 132,832 tons of cane sugar, of which 120,599\r\nwere foreign imported. The quantity consumed in 1850 was 104,071 tons,\r\nof which 65,089 was foreign.\r\n\r\n_Production in Cuba_.--The average yearly production of sugar in Cuba\r\nhas been, in the five years from 1846 to 1850, 18,690,560 arrobas,\r\nequal to 467,261,500 lbs., or 292,031 hhds. of 1,600 lbs. weight. The\r\ncrop of 1851 was estimated at twenty-one and a-half million arrobas,\r\nequal to about 335,937 West India hhds. Thus, the increase from 1836\r\nto 1841, has been as 29 per cent.; from 1841 to 1846, as 25 per cent.;\r\nand from 1846 to 1851, as 45 per cent. A portion of sugar is also\r\nsmuggled out, to evade the export duty, and by some this is set down\r\nas high as a fourth of the foregoing amounts.\r\n\r\nIn the three years ending 1841, the exports of the whole island were\r\n2,227,624 boxes; in the three years ending 1844, 2,716,319 boxes; in\r\nthe three years ending with 1847, 2,805,530 boxes.\r\n\r\nBetween 1839 and 1847, the exports had risen from 500,000 to 1,000,000\r\nboxes. The following table exhibits the quantity shipped from the\r\nleading port of Havana, to different countries:--\r\n\r\n  Countries.

From 1804 to 1808, Jamaica exported, on\r\nthe average, annually 135,331 hhds., and from 1844 to 1848, it had\r\ndecreased to 41,872 hhds. The exports from the single port of Havana,\r\nwhich in the first named period were 165,690 boxes, rose during the\r\nlatter period to 635,185 boxes; so that the shipments of sugar from\r\nJamaica, which were in 1804 to 1808 double those of Havana--in the\r\nperiod from 1844 to 1848, were five times less!\r\n\r\nCuba will be able to withstand the crisis of the low price of sugars,\r\nbetter than the emancipated British Colonies, for the following\r\nreasons:--\r\n\r\n1. It will find, in its present prosperity, a power of resistance that\r\nno longer exists in the British sugar-growing colonies.\r\n\r\n2. Because it enjoys in the Spanish markets a protection for at least\r\n16,955 tons of its sugar, or about eight-tenths of its total\r\nexportation.\r\n\r\n3. Because it has secured a very strong position in the markets of the\r\nUnited States; and both from its proximity to, and its commercial\r\nrelations with that country, as also from the better quality of its\r\nsugar, will command the sale of at least 33,500 tons, or about 16 per\r\ncent. of its total production.\r\n\r\n4. Because in 1854, after the duties shall have been equalized, it\r\nwill be enabled to undersell the British article in its own market.\r\n\r\n5. Because, not being an exclusively sugar-growing colony, as are\r\nalmost all British West India Islands, it may suffer from the present\r\ndepressed condition of the sugar market, but cannot be entirely\r\nruined, owing to its having commanding resources, and many other\r\nvaluable staples,--coffee, copper, cotton, &c.\r\n\r\n6. Because, by improving its agriculture and introducing useful\r\nmachinery, railroads, &c., for which it has large available capital,\r\nit can produce sugar at a diminished cost.\r\n\r\n7. And lastly, because the proprietors have _continuous_ labour at\r\ncommand, until slavery be abolished--of which there seems no present\r\nprospect. The slave population numbers about 350,000, and the free\r\ncoloured population, about 90,000.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of sugar, during 1847, very singularly tallied with\r\nthe production of the British Colonies that year--being exactly\r\n289,000 tons; but as 50,000 tons of foreign sugar were consumed, an\r\naccumulation of British plantation sugar necessarily remained on hand.\r\n\r\nThe production of the French colonies was 100,000 tons, of which\r\nFrance received nine-tenths.\r\n\r\nIn 1836, Jamaica made 1,136,554 cwt. of sugar. In 1840, its produce\r\nhad fallen off to 545,600 cwt.; but in the same years, Porto Rico had\r\nincreased its sugar crop, from 498,000 cwt., to 1,000,000 cwt. In\r\n1837, Cuba made 9,060,058 arrobas of sugar, equal to 132,765 hhds.; in\r\n1841, it had increased to 139,000 hhds.

Notwithstanding its\r\nimmense crops, scarcely more than three-fifths of the island is yet\r\nunder cultivation; but it has the advantage of a cheap and abundant\r\nsupply of labor, and much improved machinery has been introduced. The\r\nplanters first commenced introducing Coolies in 1835, and were for\r\nsome time restricted to the single port of Calcutta for their supply.\r\n\r\nThe recent advices from Mauritius furnish some interesting information\r\nregarding the progress making in the sugar production of that colony.\r\nIn reference to the cultivation of the cane, it is stated that by the\r\nintroduction of guano upon several estates in the interior, the\r\nproduction has been very largely increased; but as the value and\r\neconomy of manure has not been hitherto sufficiently estimated, its\r\nintroduction has not been so general as could be desired. The\r\nimportance of free labor to the cultivation of the estates, has now\r\nbecome fully appreciated by the planters; it being found that an equal\r\namount of work can be obtained by this means from a less number of\r\nhands, and that at lower rates of wages than were current in previous\r\nyears, the average of which is shown in the following table:--\r\n\r\n  +--------+-----------------+------------------+--------------+\r\n  |        |    Number of    |    Aggregate     |   Average    |\r\n  | Years. |     Coolies     | amount of wages  |wages per head|\r\n  |        |    employed.    |  paid per week.  |  per week.   |\r\n  +--------+-----------------+------------------+--------------+\r\n  |        |                 |        £         |    s.  d.    |\r\n  |  1846  |      47,733     |      33,484      |    14   0    |\r\n  |  1847  |      48,314     |      35,338      |    14   9    |\r\n  |  1848  |      41,777     |      26,627      |    12   9    |\r\n  |  1849  |      45,384     |      27,625      |    12   2    |\r\n  |  1850  |      47,912     |      31,664      |    12   3    |\r\n  |  1851  |      42,275     |      27,832      |    12   2    |\r\n  +--------+-----------------+------------------+--------------+\r\n\r\nIn 1826, to make from 25 to 30,000,000 lbs. of sugar, it required\r\n30,000 laborers (slaves); at the present time, with less than 45,000\r\n(from which number fully 5,000 must be deducted as absent from work\r\nfrom various causes), 135,000,000 lbs. are produced, or about five\r\ntimes the quantity under slavery. The coolies are found to be an\r\nintelligent race, who have become inured to the work required, and by\r\nwhose labor this small island can produce the fifth part of the\r\nconsumption of the United Kingdom, and that with only about 70,000\r\nacres under cane cultivation. About 10,000 male immigrants, introduced\r\nsince 1843, are not now working under engagement, but are following\r\nother occupations, and thus become permanent consumers. Some cultivate\r\nland on a small scale, on their own account, but very few plant canes,\r\nas it requires from eighteen to twenty months before they obtain any\r\nreturn for their labor; but the most important fact established by\r\nthis and other official statements is, that only a small number of\r\nimmigrants leave the colony at the expiration of their industrial\r\nresidence. In the manufacture of sugar from the cane, considerable\r\nimprovement has been effected by the introduction of new methods of\r\nboiling and grinding. The vacuum pan and the system of Wetsell are all\r\ntending to economise the cost of production, and to save that loss\r\nwhich for years amounted, in grinding alone, to nearly one-third of\r\nthe juice of the cane. The planters begin to find that they can\r\nincrease the value of their sugar 30 to 40 per cent. by these\r\nimprovements, and that their future prosperity depends upon carrying\r\nthem out. Unfortunately, however, here, as in many other of our\r\ncolonies, a very large number of planters do not yet appreciate the\r\nadvantages to be obtained by the adoption of improved machinery and\r\nmanufacture, or by improved cultivation, and still struggle on under\r\nthe old system of waste and negligence, which can only result in the\r\nruin and destruction of their property.\r\n\r\nIn 1827, the number of sugar estates in operation in Mauritius, were\r\n49 worked by water power, 50 by cattle or horses, and 22 by\r\nsteam--total 111; in 1836, this number had increased to 186, viz.--64\r\nmoved by water power, 10 by horse, and 112 by steam. In 1839, the\r\nnumber was 211, of which 138 were worked by steam power--70,292 acres\r\nwere then under cultivation with sugar. There are now about 490 sugar\r\nestates, whereof only 231 have mills--42 are worked by water power,\r\nthe rest by steam.\r\n\r\nThe annual Mauritius crops, as exported, for the last ten years, have\r\nbeen as follows. The shipments frequently extend beyond a year, hence\r\na discrepancy sometimes between the year's crop and the year's\r\nexport:--\r\n\r\n                  Tons,\r\n  1842-43        24,400\r\n  1843-44        28,600\r\n  1844-45        37,600\r\n  1845-46        49,100\r\n  1846-47        64,100\r\n  1847-48        59,021\r\n  1848-49        50,782\r\n  1849-50        51,811\r\n  1850-51        55,000\r\n  1851-52        65,080\r\n\r\nBesides its exports to Great Britain, Mauritius ships large\r\nquantities of sugar to the Cape of Good Hope and Australia.\r\n\r\nIts local consumption is moreover set down at about 2,500 tons.\r\n\r\nThe progressive increase in its exports is marked by the following\r\nreturn of imports into Great Britain from the island:--\r\n\r\n               Cwt.\r\n  1826         93,723\r\n  1827        186,782\r\n  1828        204,344\r\n  1829        361,325\r\n  1830        297,958\r\n  1831        485,710\r\n  1832        517,553\r\n  1833        521,904\r\n  1834        516,077\r\n  1835        553,891\r\n  1836        558,237\r\n  1837        497,302\r\n  1838        537,455\r\n  1839        604,671\r\n  1840        690,294\r\n  1841        545,356\r\n  1842        716,009\r\n  1843        696,652\r\n  1844        545,415\r\n  1845        716,173\r\n  1846        845,197\r\n  1847      1,193,571\r\n  1848        886,184\r\n  1849        893,524\r\n  1850      1,003,296\r\n  1851        999,337\r\n\r\n_East Indies_.--Sugar is a very old and extensive cultivation in\r\nIndia. It would probably be within the mark, to estimate the annual\r\nproduce of the country at a million of tons. An official return shows\r\nthat the quantity of sugar carried on one road of the interior, for\r\nprovincial consumption, is about equal to the whole quantity shipped\r\nfrom Calcutta--some 50,000 or 60,000 tons.\r\n\r\nIndia is fast becoming a great sugar producing country, although its\r\nproduce and processes of manufacture are rude and imperfect. The\r\nCoolies who return from time to time to the Indian ports, bring with\r\nthem much acquired knowledge and experience from the Mauritius.\r\n\r\nIn 1825, the import of sugar from the East Indies was but 146,000\r\ncwt., and it fluctuated greatly in succeeding years, being\r\noccasionally as low as 76,600 cwt. In 1837 the quantity imported was\r\njust double what it was in 1827. In 1841, it had reached as high as\r\n1,239,738 cwt., and subsequently kept steady for a few years at\r\n1,100,000 cwt.--and for the last four years has averaged 1,400,000\r\ncwt.\r\n\r\n_Java_.--Attention has been withdrawn, in a great measure, from sugar\r\ncultivation in Java, owing to coffee being found a more remunerative\r\nstaple.

There is now an increased demand for the Australian\r\ncolonies, consequent upon the large influx of population to that\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nExport of sugar from Manila in 1850.\r\n\r\n                                        Piculs.\r\n  To Great Britain                      146,926\r\n  \"  Continent of Europe                 50,830\r\n  \"  Australian Colonies                142,359\r\n  \"  Singapore, Batavia, and Bombay      12,749\r\n  \"  California and the Pacific          29,144\r\n  \"  The United States                   77,919\r\n                                        -------\r\n                                        459,927\r\n\r\nThe sugar cane occurs in a wild state on many of the islands of the\r\nPacific, but in no part of the American continent, notwithstanding a\r\ncontrary opinion has been expressed.\r\n\r\nThe following are the chief varieties cultivated in the West Indies,\r\nLouisiana, the East Indies, and Mauritius:--\r\n\r\n1. Common or creole cane, so called from being introduced from the New\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\n2. Yellow Bourbon.\r\n\r\n3. Yellow Otaheite.\r\n\r\n4. Otaheite with purple bands.\r\n\r\n5. Purple Otaheite.\r\n\r\n6. Ribbon cane.\r\n\r\nMy friend, Mr. L. Wray, in his \"Practical Sugar Planter,\" considers\r\nthe Bourbon, and yellow, or straw-coloured Otaheite cane, as\r\nidentical, but merely altered by change of soil and climate. The yield\r\nfrom these cane-plants seems to be about the same in either Indies,\r\nviz., in good land about two-and-a-half tons of dry sugar per\r\nacre--sometimes three tons.\r\n\r\nA very large species of red cane, grown at Gowhatty, in Assam, is\r\nmade favorable mention of for its strength of growth, early maturity,\r\nand juiciness; and Mr. Wray strongly recommends the introduction into\r\nthe West Indies of another fine variety, generally grown in the\r\nStraits' settlements, where it is known by the name of the Salangore\r\ncane. He considers they would ratoon better than any other cane, and\r\nthe return from it is on the average 3,600 lbs. of dry sugar to the\r\nacre.\r\n\r\n    \"For my own part, I have always reckoned as an average, 3,600 lbs.\r\n    of dry sugar to the acre as the return this cane will give, on\r\n    anything like good land, in the Straits, according to the present\r\n    imperfect mode of expressing and manufacture; but, considering the\r\n    surpassing richness of land in the West India Islands, Demerara, and\r\n    Mauritius, I should not be in any way surprised to find that it\r\n    would there give even three tons an acre.\r\n\r\n    The Salangore cane grows firm and strong; stands upright much better\r\n    than the Otaheite; gives juice most abundantly, which is sweet and\r\n    easy of clarification, boils well, and produces a very fine, fair\r\n    sugar, of a bold and sparkling grain.\"\r\n\r\nMuch discussion has arisen on the subject of raising the sugar cane\r\nfrom seed, and the possibility has been universally denied among the\r\nplanters and agricultural societies of the West India colonies. Mr.\r\nPritchard, a sugar planter of Louisiana, in the \"United States Patent\r\nReport for 1850,\" however, states:--\r\n\r\n    \"It is an error to suppose that the cane cannot be propagated from\r\n    the seed. This may be the case when the seed is obtained from plants\r\n    that have been produced for a number of years from buds, or eyes.\r\n    All plants that have been produced in this way for a series of\r\n    years, lose the faculty of forming prolific seeds; and the sugar\r\n    cane is governed by the same laws which govern the whole vegetable\r\n    kingdom. It cannot, therefore, be expected to produce seeds after it\r\n    has been cultivated for a great length of time.\"\r\n\r\nThe sugar cane is composed of water, woody fibre, and soluble matter,\r\nor sugar. In round numbers it may be stated that the proportions are\r\n72 per cent. of water, 10 per cent. of woody fibre, and 18 per cent.\r\nof sugar.\r\n\r\nThe fluid contents of a cane, according to Dr. Evans, contain 90 per\r\ncent. of the entire structure of the stem.\r\n\r\n1,000 grains of sugar cane, being burnt, gave 7½ grains of ash, which,\r\non analysis, furnished the following components:--\r\n\r\n  Silica                        1.78\r\n  Phosphate of lime             3.41\r\n  Red oxide of iron and clay     .17\r\n  Carbonate of potash           1.46\r\n  Sulphate of potash             .15\r\n  Carbonate of magnesia          .43\r\n  Sulphate of lime                 6\r\n                                ----\r\n                                7.46\r\n\r\nThe following is the quantative analysis of a portion of soil taken\r\nfrom the surface of a cane field, on the Diamond estate, in St.\r\nVincent, West Indies: --\r\n\r\n  Alumina soluble in acids                    12.87\r\n  Organic matter                              11.26\r\n  Gypsum                                        .23\r\n  Carbonate of lime                           12.52\r\n  ---- of magnesia                              .71\r\n  Oxide of iron                                8.51\r\n  Oxide of manganese                            .33\r\n  Insoluble silicious and aluminous matter    53.57\r\n                                             ------\r\n                                             100.00\r\n\r\nThe sugar of the cane and grape sugar are distinguished by the\r\nfollowing difference in their elements, as proved by analysis:--\r\n\r\n              Cane sugar.     Grape sugar.\r\n  Carbon          12               12\r\n  Hydrogen        10               12\r\n  Oxygen          10               12\r\n  Water            1                2\r\n\r\nThere is a remarkable difference, however, between their fermentable\r\nproperties. When a solution is made of the same quantities of these\r\ntwo sugars, in equal proportions of distilled water, it will be\r\nnecessary to add eight times as much of the same ferment to induce\r\nalcoholic fermentation in the solution of cane sugar, as in that of\r\ngrape sugar. Under the action of a larger quantity of ferment, cane\r\nsugar is transformed into grape sugar.\r\n\r\nIf you cut a sugar cane in two, and examine the interior part of it\r\nwith a magnifying glass, you perceive the crystals of sugar as\r\ndistinct and as white as those of double-refined sugar. The object of\r\nthe operator should be then either to extract those crystals without\r\naltering their color, or, if that be found impracticable, to separate\r\nthem from the impurities mixed with them, while the juice is in its\r\nnatural state, and yet contains but little coloring matter. Instead of\r\nthis, the juice is limed while all the impurities are in it. In\r\nseparating the feculencies from the juice and uniting them in large\r\nflakes, lime dissolves a portion of them and forms with them coloring\r\nmatter, which we all know at once discolors the juice, when lime is\r\nused in excess. Afterwards heat is applied, either in clarifiers or in\r\nthe grand copper, but most of the impurities found in the juice will\r\ndecompose, and burn at a degree of heat far below the boiling point,\r\nsay at 120 deg. of Fahrenheit. This is shown by the thick scales\r\ncontinually forming in the grande. From that degree of heat the\r\ndecomposition goes on in the clarifier till the juice is drawn, and\r\ncontinues in the grande so long as there are feculencies left. This\r\ndecomposition greatly increases the quantity of coloring matter, so\r\nthat, as the juice is being clarified, it loses in color what it gains\r\nin purity. And here let me show the relative value of the \"grande\" and\r\nof clarifiers as agents of clarification. In the grande, if it is well\r\nattended to, the scummings are taken up as soon as they rise. A\r\nportion of them is removed before they begin to decompose, and the\r\nprocess goes on, so that before the juice reaches the boiling point\r\nnearly all the feculencies are removed, and the source of coloring\r\nmatter is removed with them. Clarifiers reach the boiling point much\r\nquicker, and cannot easily be scummed. The general practice is to\r\nbring them to that point without scumming, to let the feculencies\r\nseparate from the juice by cooling and by rest, and to wash out the\r\nclarifiers every second or third time they are filled. Heat and\r\nalkalies acting in them upon the accumulated feculencies of one, two,\r\nor three charges, dissolve a much larger portion of those feculencies\r\nthan they can possibly do in the grande. The formation of coloring\r\nmatter continues during the time of rest, and accordingly planters,\r\nafter repeated trials, generally agree that juice well clarified in\r\nthe grande, has a lighter and brighter color, and makes better sugar\r\nthan that obtained from clarifiers.\r\n\r\nThe first object of research should be to find means of clarifying the\r\njuice without creating coloring matter. It is said that presses\r\nsomething like those used to press cotton, have lately been\r\nsuccessfully employed in the West Indies, instead of rollers; that the\r\njuice obtained is much purer, and that a much larger quantity of it is\r\nextracted from the cane. If so, this will be a great improvement, and\r\nthe first step of the process I should recommend. From juice thus\r\nobtained, I have no doubt that all impurities less soluble than itself\r\nmay be separated by mechanical means before heat and alkalies are\r\napplied, or at least with a very small quantity of alkalies. All other\r\nliquids, all fatty substances and oils, except cotton seed oil, are\r\nclarified by a very rapid process. Cane juice can no doubt be\r\nclarified by similar means, and if this were accomplished the process\r\nof sugar making would be very much simplified.\r\n\r\nThe clarified juice might then be placed in an evaporator, heated by\r\nthe waste steam of the engine; then be limed and scummed if necessary,\r\nand concentrated to fifteen or sixteen of the prese sirop; then\r\npurified by filtration through animal charcoal, if white sugar was\r\nwanted, or by rest for other qualities; and finally concentrated in\r\nvacuum pans of great power, such pans as Mr. Thomas A. Morgan, of\r\nLouisiana, now uses, and which, I am informed, are only made in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe superiority of the vacuum pan is not universally admitted, and we\r\nare told that in France it is superseded by open pans, similar to\r\nthose called in America \"Mape's Evaporators.\" However this may be, I\r\ncannot help believing that the vacuum pan has many decided advantages\r\nover all others. One is manifest; the sugar may be grained in the pan,\r\nand the granulation is completely under the control of the operator.\r\nHe may accelerate or retard it at pleasure; he may carry it so far\r\nthat sugar will not run from the pan, and will have to be taken out of\r\nit; he may so conduct the operation as to increase, almost at will,\r\nthe size and hardness of the crystals. This last is an indispensable\r\nrequisite if the practice of draining sugar in pneumatic pans should\r\nbe adopted.\r\n\r\nThe atmospheric pressure is made too powerful for sugars boiled in any\r\nother manner; it breaks and destroys the crystals, and in a very few\r\ndays sets the sugar to fermenting.\r\n\r\nThe pneumatic draining of sugar has many things to recommend it--the\r\nusual loss by drainage is avoided, sugar is got ready for market day\r\nby day, as it is made, and it may be bleached by pouring white syrup\r\nover it and forcing it through the mass. It is said that the process\r\nis attended with considerable loss in weight, but as all that drains\r\nfrom the pan may be boiled over once or twice, it is not easy to\r\nconceive how the loss can occur.\r\n\r\nCane juice contains many ingredients besides sugar, the principal of\r\nwhich are albumen, gluten, gum, starch, resin, wax, coloring matter,\r\nand certain salts, all of which, either collectively or individually,\r\nhave the power of preventing granulation, as may be proved by their\r\naddition to a syrup of pure sugar, which will then defy all attempts\r\nto make it crystallise. If, therefore, we want to make good sugar, we\r\nmust endeavour to free our cane juice as much as possible from those\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nNow, cane juice is no more the sap of the cane, than apple juice is\r\nthat of the apple tree; it is the natural product of the cane, and, in\r\nall probability, would contain but a small proportion of these foreign\r\nmatters if it could be expressed without being accompanied by the sap,\r\nthey being the natural constituents of the last-named fluid. A patent\r\nhas, I believe, been lately taken out for separating the cane juice\r\nwithout the sap. However, in the absence of such an improvement, much\r\nmay be done by care and attention at the mill; the green bands and\r\ntrash which usually accompany the canes from the field, should,\r\ntherefore, be carefully removed before they are passed through, as\r\nthey contain no saccharine matter, abound in the deleterious\r\nsubstances already mentioned, and communicate a bad color to the\r\njuice; therefore, _the ripe cane only should pass through the mill_.\r\nThere are but few planters who have not had to contend with sour\r\njuice, and they attribute the difficulty they experience in making\r\nsugar therefrom, to the presence of acetic acid, or vinegar; but this\r\nis quite an erroneous idea, as the acetic acid is very volatile, and\r\nevaporates quickly on the application of heat, which may be proved by\r\nthrowing a gallon of strong vinegar into a pan of liquor; it will do\r\nno harm, provided it be boiled before tempering; on the contrary, the\r\neffect, if it be properly done, will be beneficial, as it will promote\r\nthe coagulation of the albumen; it is the gum which is always formed\r\nduring the acetous fermentation of sugar that prevents granulation;\r\nhence, then, acidity is strictly to be guarded against, as\r\nfermentation once commenced, it will be impossible to make good sugar,\r\nit will continue throughout the process, and even in the hogshead; so\r\nthat canes should be ground as soon as possible after they are cut,\r\nand all rat-eaten and broken ones carefully excluded. Canes may,\r\nhowever, be kept some days without fermenting, provided they be not\r\nbroken or damaged, it being, as we said before, the mixture of the sap\r\nand the cane juice that makes the liquid so prone to fermentation; and\r\nthe mill, gutters, and everything with which the juice is likely to\r\ncome in contact, should be kept carefully clean, and whitewashed\r\nimmediately after, and the whitewash removed before use, as acetate of\r\nlime being an exceedingly soluble and deliquescent salt, will not\r\nimprove the quality of the sugar; whilst the gutter should be short,\r\nand sheltered from the sun's rays, they having the effect of greatly\r\nexpediting chemical action.\r\n\r\nI shall say no more on this subject, but will proceed to consider the\r\nmode of tempering and clarifying cane juice, and the action of lime on\r\nthe various substances contained therein. The expression \"tempering\"\r\nhas, I presume, been, adopted in consequence of the use of tempered\r\nlime for the purpose of precipitating the feculencies, held in\r\nsolution in the cane juice, into a state of suspension; and\r\nclarification is the process by which we afterwards clear the liquor\r\nof these and other foreign matter. Now, as I before observed,\r\n\"fermentation should be most strictly guarded against;\" our first\r\nefforts should be directed to free the cane juice from those\r\nsubstances most conducive to that process; and on inquiry we find\r\nthese to be albumen and gluten; so far, however, from getting rid of\r\nthem in cold tempering, we adopt a course which retains them\r\npermanently in solution, as lime has the power of rendering them\r\npermanently soluble, and of forming soapy compounds with resin, wax,\r\nand chlorophyle, or the green coloring matter of leaves, forming an\r\ninsoluble compound with and precipitating only the starch, and\r\nconverting at the same time the green color of the chlorophyle (which\r\nis, in all probability, attached to the resin), into a dark brown, of\r\na greater or less intensity, according to the composition of the cane\r\njuice, and, consequently, the quantity of lime required; it follows,\r\ntherefore, as a matter of course, that if juice be tempered before\r\nthese substances have been removed, they must be permanently retained,\r\nand they have all the power of preventing granulation.\r\n\r\nAlbumen, and gluten are both coagulable by heat; if, therefore, we\r\nraise the liquor to the boiling point prior to applying the lime,\r\ntaking care to remove the scum as soon as it shows signs of breaking,\r\nand continuing the boiling until the scum thrown to the surface\r\nbecomes inconsiderable, we shall find that the albumen and gluten, in\r\ncoagulating and rising, have carried with them the small particles of\r\nwoody fibre, the wax, and a large proportion of the coloring matter,\r\nand that the lime will now throw down the starch, and any other little\r\nimpurities remaining in suspension in the liquor, leaving it perfectly\r\nclear and bright. Tempering is an exceedingly delicate chemical\r\noperation, and I have no hesitation in saying, that on its proper\r\nperformance depends the quality of the produce. The following simple\r\nexperiments, which all have it in their power to try, will, if they\r\ngive themselves the trouble, fully satisfy them of two important\r\npoints--the superiority of the hot over the cold mode, and the\r\nnecessity for great attention to the operation of tempering. Let them\r\ntake a tumbler of cane-juice and a bottle containing lime water, add\r\nthe latter to the former by drops, pausing and stirring between each,\r\nand they will find that, after the addition of a certain quantity, the\r\nopaque gummy appearance of the liquor undergoes a change, and the\r\nimpurities contained in it separate into flakes, which increase in\r\nsize with each drop of lime added, until they become extinct, and the\r\nsupernatant liquor perfectly transparent; this is the precise point at\r\nwhich the liquor is tempered, and each drop of lime added after this,\r\ncauses the flakes to diminish rapidly in size, at last entirely to\r\ndisappear (being re-dissolved), and the liquor to resume its former\r\ngummy appearance; it is, therefore, evident that there should be no\r\nsuch expressions as tempering high or low.\r\n\r\nThe reason why some liquor is so difficult to clean is, that it is\r\neither tempered high or low; if it be exactly tempered, the impurities\r\ncontained in it being entirely separated and thrown out of solution,\r\nrise to the surface immediately on the application of heat, and are\r\neasily removed; but if there be too little lime, a great portion\r\nremains in solution, and if too much, a proportional quantity is\r\nre-dissolved; and in either case cannot be removed by any mechanical\r\nmeans. It is, therefore, necessary to have some precise test for the\r\napplication of lime.\r\n\r\nAs regards the superiority of the hot over the cold tempering, let any\r\none take, in separate vessels, two gallons of cane-juice, and temper\r\none, adding the lime in small quantities--say, of three grains at a\r\ntime--and keeping an account of the quantity used; he will find that\r\nthe first portions produce no effect whatever, and that it is only\r\nafter the addition of a considerable quantity that the desired\r\nprecipitation of the impurities manifest itself. Why is this? Because\r\nalbumen, gluten, resin, and chlorophyle, being soluble in lime, lime\r\nis equally so in them, and they must first be saturated before it will\r\nproduce any other effect. Let the liquor thus tempered, be then placed\r\non one side. Put the other gallon over a fire, and boil it, removing\r\nthe scum just before, and during, ebullition; let it then be taken off\r\nthe fire, and tempered in the same way as the other. The very first\r\nquantity of lime added causes the appearance of the floccy\r\nprecipitate; and if the addition of the lime be continued until it be\r\nprecisely tempered, it will be found that the hot possesses the\r\nfollowing advantages over the cold-tempered liquor:--In a quarter of\r\nan hour its impurities will have subsided to a sixteenth of its bulk,\r\nleaving the supernatant liquor as bright and clear as pale brandy;\r\nwhile those in the other have only sunk to one-quarter of its bulk.\r\nThe color of the former clear liquor will not be less than one-half\r\nthe intensity of that of the latter. The lime used in the hot has been\r\nless by one-third than the quantity used in the cold tempering.\r\n\r\nOf course, on level estates there is little difficulty in tempering\r\nliquor, but on hilly properties scarcely two pans will require the\r\nsame quantity.\r\n\r\nIt is generally believed that the object of adding lime to cane-juice\r\nis for the purpose of neutralising an acid, and it is to the reception\r\nof this fallacious idea that it is indebted for its long and continued\r\nuse, and the present backward state of sugar manufacture is\r\nattributable: I unhesitatingly assert that, if there be an acid\r\npresent in the cane-juice, the addition of lime to it will be\r\ninjurious instead of beneficial. There are only four acids that we\r\ncould expect to find in cane juice--mucous, saccholactic or saclactic,\r\noxalic, and acetic acids. The three first named of these, however,\r\nhave never been traced, even in the most minute quantities; and if the\r\nlatter be present, which, unfortunately, is but too often the case,\r\nthe addition of lime would only result in the formation of acetate of\r\nlime, which is, as I have already observed, an exceedingly difficult\r\ncrystallisable, very soluble, and deliquescent salt. It has a bitter,\r\nsaline taste; 100 parts consist of 64.5 acid, 35.5 lime, and it is\r\neasily recognisable by its taste in the molasses made from sour\r\ncane-juice: so that, supposing the cane-juice sour, every pint of acid\r\npresent would require nearly half a pound of lime for its\r\nneutralisation, independent of the quantity required for the tempering\r\nor precipitation of the feculencies contained in it, and would result\r\nin the formation of one-and-a-half pound of the above mentioned highly\r\ndeleterious salt.\r\n\r\nSuppose we boil the cane-juice prior to tempering it, we then drive\r\noff a great portion of acetic acid, much less lime will be required,\r\nand if we could, by filtration or subsidence, get rid of the\r\nprecipitated feculencies, we should make a tolerably good sugar; but\r\nas, under the present plan, we have no means of so doing, the acetic\r\nacid, which is forming during the whole process of evaporation (as\r\nfermentation still goes on), unites with the lime before it can be\r\ndissipated by the heat, and thus not only forms acetate of lime, but\r\ncauses the re-solution of the precipitated feculencies, thus rendering\r\nit necessary to add a fresh portion of lime in the tache, a proceeding\r\nalways to be avoided, if possible, but generally necessary in boiling\r\ndown sour liquor. Take a small portion of cane-juice (hot or cold) in\r\na tumbler, and temper it with lime until the feculencies are\r\nprecipitated and the flakes perfectly visible, then add vinegar by\r\ndrops, and it will be found that the flakes will speedily disappear\r\nand be re-dissolved, showing that lime has a greater affinity for\r\nacetic acid than starch, and that, although when added to sour\r\ncane-juice, it neutralises the acidity, still that result is a\r\nconsequence, not the cause, of the application, and is highly\r\ninjurious. Lime is one of the greatest known solvents of vegetable\r\nmatter; it dissolves albumen, gluten, gum and lignin, or woody fibre,\r\nforming soapy compounds with wax, resin, and, chlorophyle. Ordinary\r\ncane-juice contains about three parts of resin to every 100 of sugar,\r\nand the projection of a small piece of soap into a tache full of\r\ngranulating syrup will soon convince any one of the effect likely to\r\nresult from the presence of that material. Although, by tempering hot,\r\nwe get rid of a very great quantity of the substances on which lime\r\nacts injuriously, a considerable portion of them remain in suspension,\r\nthe quantity of albumen contained in the cane-juice not being\r\nsufficient to carry them all off by coagulation; on the addition of\r\nthe lime, however, they are entirely dissolved and as the impurities\r\nleft behind consist chiefly of gluten, the liability of the liquor to\r\nferment is greatly increased by its retention, that being the\r\nfermenting principle contained in wheat and other vegetable\r\nproductions prone to that process.\r\n\r\nOne hundred parts of Albumen consist of Carbon, 52.88; Oxygen, 23.88;\r\nHydrogen, 7-54; Nitrogen, 15.70.

In chemistry we are able, to a certain extent, to\r\nimitate the operations of nature; but we must follow in the same\r\ncourse laid down by her; thus, we can convert woody fibre, or sawdust\r\nand starch, into sugar, gum, alcohol, and acetic acid; but we cannot\r\nconvert alcohol, acetic acid, or gum into sugar, starch or woody\r\nfibre; and of such importance is a slight alteration of the\r\nproportions of these elements--carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen--that the\r\nabstraction of carbon from sugar, and the addition of a portion of the\r\nprime support of life, vegetation and combustion, oxygen, changes the\r\nharmless sugar into the most violent of poisons, oxalic acid, which\r\nconsists of 26.57 carbon, 70.69 oxygen, and 2.74 hydrogen.\r\n\r\nLet us now examine the action of lime on sugar, and we shall find it\r\nequally, if not more, injurious than on the other substances. Sugar is\r\ncapable of dissolving half its weight of lime, by which its sweet\r\ntaste is destroyed, and it becomes converted into gum; the lime\r\nabstracting carbonic acid from it to form a carbonate of lime or\r\nchalk. It will be seen by the above table that--\r\n\r\n  100 parts of sugar contain    42.47 carbon.\r\n  100 parts of gum contain      42.23 ditto.\r\n                                -----\r\n                  Difference       24\r\n\r\nSo that, if we extract 24-100ths of a grain of carbon from 100 grains\r\nof sugar, we convert them into gum. Let us suppose that about two\r\nounces of lime, or say 1,000 grains, remain in solution in a pan, (say\r\n200 gallons of liquor,) those 1,000 grains of lime will require 761 of\r\ncarbonic acid to convert them into carbonate of lime or chalk, 100\r\ngrains of which consist of 56.2 lime and 43.8 carbonic acid. So that\r\n1,761 grains of chalk consist of 1,000 lime and 761 carbonic acid. Now\r\n100 grains of carbonic add consist of 27.53 carbon and 72.47 oxygen;\r\ntherefore 761 grains will consist of 209.50 carbon and 551.53 oxygen.\r\n\r\nConsequently, 1,000 grains of lime will require 209.50 grains of\r\ncarbon to convert them into carbonate of lime; and as we have seen\r\nthat the abstraction of 24 from 100 grains of sugar convert them into\r\ngum, it follows, that the abstraction of 209.50 grains would have a\r\nsimilar effect on 87,000 grains, or about 15 lbs. of sugar, which,\r\nbeing converted into gum, would prevent the crystallisation of several\r\ntimes its weight of sugar; and this is the cause of the formation of\r\nmolasses. The loss of sugar is not the only bad consequence of the use\r\nof lime, as the greater the quantity of gum in the liquor, the more it\r\nmust be boiled--the more it is boiled the darker it gets--and the\r\nhigher the temperature at which the skip is struck, the smaller the\r\ngrain. The following is a good proof that lime dissolves albumen, and\r\nbecomes converted into chalk:--Take a spoonful of syrup out of the\r\ntache of any estate on which the liquor is tempered cold; it will be\r\nfound filled with small flakes; these are albumen set free from its\r\nsolution in the lime by the conversion of the latter into carbonate of\r\nlime, and coagulated by heat. It is perfectly possible to temper\r\nliquor, so that scarcely any uncrystallisable sugar will remain; but\r\nplanters do not like this; they must have molasses for the\r\nstill-house; they could, however, boil low, by which the grain and\r\ncolor would be improved, and plenty of uncrystallised, although not\r\nuncrystallisable, syrup would be left to take the place of molasses.\r\n\r\nI think I have now fully proved the following facts, viz.:--That the\r\nuse of lime in sugar-making is not to neutralise an acid; that if\r\nacidity be present, the application of lime is injurious; that its\r\naction on gluten, albumen, wax, resin, and chlorophyle is equally so;\r\nthat by decomposing the sugar and forming gum, the quantity of\r\nmolasses or uncrystallisable sugar is much increased, whereby high\r\nboiling is rendered necessary, with its consequent heightening of\r\ncolor and injury to the grain of the produce, and that therefore it is\r\nperfectly unfit for the purpose of tempering cane-juice.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Thomas Begg and Co., of London, have procured from E.F.\r\nTelchemacher and J. Denham Smith, an analysis of one gallon of\r\nordinary plantain juice, and one gallon of Ramos' prepared plantain\r\njuice \"for the purpose of ascertaining whether any substance can be\r\nused which, in conjunction with water, will answer as a substitute for\r\nthe plantain juice in the receipt which accompanied the samples.\" The\r\nchemists say they find that one gallon of ordinary plantain juice\r\nholds in solution;--\r\n\r\n  Extract similar to tannin              25.60 grains\r\n  Vegetable extract and fatty matter     57.70    \"\r\n  Carbonate of potash                   150.40    \"\r\n  Muriate of potash                      33.60    \"\r\n  Muriate of soda                         2.00    \"\r\n  Silica                                  1.20    \"\r\n                                        -------------\r\n  Contents of one imperial gallon       270.50 grains\r\n\r\n--whilst one gallon of \"Ramos' prepared plantain juice\" contains,\r\nbesides vegetable extract, 226 grains of solid matter, consisting of\r\nsulphuret and potash, in the following proportions:--\r\n\r\n  Sulphur         40 grains\r\n  Lime           156    \"\r\n  Potash          30    \"\r\n                 ----------\r\n                 226 grains\r\n\r\nThey do not think it likely that the potash exists in fresh plantain\r\njuice as carbonate, but rather that this salt is the product of\r\ndecomposition, arising from a compound of potash and a vegetable acid,\r\nsuch as tartaric or oxalic acid present in the fresh juice; be this as\r\nit may, any utility derivable from the plantain juice is evidently\r\nowing to the potash it contains.\r\n\r\nThey then give as a substitute for Ramos' liquid, and to be used in a\r\nsimilar way, the following--\r\n\r\nTake of subcarbonate of potash 2 ounces, avoirdupois; sulphur, 2¼\r\nounces; best British lime slaked, 1½ lb.; mix them into a paste in an\r\nearthen pan or wooden tub, with one quart of water (warm) and when\r\nthoroughly mixed, pour in ten gallons of boiling water--rain water is\r\nthe best to use--and stir from time to time until it has cooled, when\r\nit may be drawn off from the sediment and kept for use. If rain water\r\ncannot be obtained, the purest water obtainable may be used.\r\n\r\nOne of the causes most fatal to West Indian prosperity, is that\r\nexuberance of advantages which they enjoy from serenity of climate and\r\nfertility of soil--causes which, in the absence of proper stimulus to\r\nindustry and improvement, have led to an improvident system of\r\ncultivation, and to a blind and ignorant adherence to wasteful methods\r\nof manufacture.\r\n\r\nThe cane is believed to contain from 90 to 95 per cent. of its own\r\nweight of saccharine juice; and yet (as Mr. Fownes, a Professor of\r\nPractical Chemistry in University College, London, informs us, in an\r\nexcellent paper \"On the Manufacture of Sugar in Barbados,\"[17] from\r\nwhich much of what follows has been borrowed) owing to the defective\r\nconstruction of the mills, hardly so much as 50 per cent. is obtained,\r\nalthough he believes it practicable, by an improvement in the mills,\r\nto obtain from 70 to 75 per cent.; and of the remaining 10 or 15 per\r\ncent. which he regards it as impossible to extract, much, if not the\r\nwhole, might, I conceive, be obtained, by macerating the pressed canes\r\nor megass, as it issues from the mill, and repassing it through the\r\nrollers; and, be it remembered, that from 40 to 45 per cent. of\r\nsaccharine juice is nearly, if not altogether, equivalent to a similar\r\nper centage of sugar; so that by these initiatory improvements alone,\r\nand with little additional trouble, the produce of sugar might be\r\nnearly doubled from any given quantity of canes.\r\n\r\nFrom the action of lime-water when added in a slight excess to the\r\ncane juice or raw liquor, as it is vernacularly termed, immediately on\r\nissuing from the mill, as well as from the effect produced by ammonia\r\nor potash, this liquid appears to contain a considerable quantity of\r\ncane sugar, mixed with much glucose, or that saccharine matter which\r\nis found in fruits; gum or dextrine, phosphates, and probably malates\r\nof lime and magnesia, with sulphates and chlorides, potash and soda,\r\nand a peculiar azotised matter, allied to albumen, which forms an\r\ninsoluble compound with lime, is not coagulable by heat or acids, and\r\nruns readily into putrefactive fermentation.\r\n\r\nTo free it from these constituents, and enable it to yield pure and\r\ncrystallisable sugar, the liquor, on entering the boiling-house, is\r\nreceived into the first of three clarifiers, of the capacity of from\r\nthree hundred to a thousand gallons each. Here it is subjected to the\r\naction of lime-water, which checks the tendency to fermentation, and\r\nneutralises any free acid which it may contain. \"The common defection\r\nprocess,\" says Mr. Fownes, \"in careful hands, seems susceptible of\r\nlittle improvement. Many other substances than lime have been proposed\r\nand tried with more or less success, some of which, in particular\r\nstates of the cane juice, may prove very useful; but, for general\r\npurposes, nothing seems to answer so well as neutralisation by lime,\r\neither in the form of lime-water or milk of lime, added until the\r\nslightest possible tendency to alkalinity, as ascertained by delicate\r\nreddened litmus paper, is perceived. The juice should be somewhat\r\nheated before the lime is added, and afterwards raised quite to the\r\nboiling point. The fire is then to be withdrawn, and the whole allowed\r\nto rest a short time.\" Such is Mr. Fownes' description of the process\r\nof clarification; to which I will venture to add, upon the authority\r\nof those who have experienced its good effects, the joint use of the\r\nmucilage of the _Guazuma ulmifolia_, or gun-stock tree, as it is\r\npopularly termed in Nevis from the use to which its timber has been\r\napplied. This is the bastard cedar of Jamaica, or Orme d'Amerique, and\r\nBois d'Orme of the French, which may be found described by Lunan, in\r\nthe first volume of his \"Hortus Jamaicensis,\" page 59, under the name\r\nof _Bubroma Guazuma_.\r\n\r\nThis tree presents in the interval between its outer bark of sap-wood,\r\na mass of fibrous matter about half an inch in thickness, richly\r\nimpregnated with mucilage, which is obtained by macerating the fibrous\r\nmass, conveniently divided into small shreds, for about twelve hours,\r\nin warm water, in the proportion of about two handsful to eight\r\ngallons of water. Of this solution, which is of a light, straw color,\r\nand somewhat thickened, one gallon is to be added for every hundred\r\ngallons of cane juice, after the clarifier has been charged with the\r\nproper quantity of lime-water, and has become lukewarm. The mixture\r\nshould then be stirred, and afterwards allowed to settle till the scum\r\nhas risen to the surface. The fire must next be cautiously and\r\ngradually raised to the point of boiling, when it must again be\r\nslackened, and the whole left to stand for about forty minutes, by\r\nwhich time the mass of feculencies will have risen to the surface,\r\nwhen the clear liquor underneath may either be drawn off by a siphon\r\nor cock; the whole may be filtered as Mr. Fownes recommends, by which\r\nmeans the liquor would be more effectually clarified, and much, if not\r\nall, the subsequent labour of skimming dispensed with. The matter\r\nremaining on the filter may be employed, either as a ferment in the\r\nstill-house, or added to the manure heap. Much of the beneficial\r\neffect of the mucilage of the _guazuma_ arises probably from an\r\nadmixture of tannin, or some other astringent; for I have often been\r\nstruck with the peculiar whiteness of the potted sugar in the\r\ncuring-house, in the immediate vicinity of the Banana stalks,\r\nresulting, no doubt, from their powerful astringency; and tannin has\r\nalready been found useful in the manufacture of sugar from beet-root\r\nin France, and is no doubt equally applicable to cane-sugar.\r\n\r\nThe liquor, when clarified in the manner described, must be\r\nconcentrated, by regulated evaporation, to the degree requisite for\r\ncrystallisation. This Mr. Fownes advises to be done by steam of a\r\nmoderate pressure circulating in a spiral of copper-pipe laid at the\r\nbottom of the evaporating vessels, which should be large and shallow,\r\nand wholly unlike those in present use. Here it may be rapidly boiled\r\ndown till the heat rises to about 225 deg., without risk of burning.\r\nWhen cold, it should have a density of about 1.38, and mark the 38th\r\ndegree of Baume's hydrometer; beyond which point of inspissation it\r\nwould be dangerous to go. The remaining concentration will be most\r\nsafely conducted in the vacuum pan, where a scarcity of water does\r\nnot, as in Barbados, militate against its use.\r\n\r\nMr. Fownes exposes the absurdity of using shallow coolers, exposing a\r\nlarge surface, and producing a rapid evaporation, for the process of\r\ncrystallisation. By the use of the shallow coolers formerly, and, I\r\nbelieve, yet to be found on most estates, from the rapidity of the\r\nevaporation, the sugar is obtained in a mass of confused and\r\nimperfectly-formed crystals, entangling in their interstices a\r\nconsiderable quantity of molasses, which impairs the color of the\r\nproduct, and escaping slowly, and with difficulty, is, to a\r\nconsiderable extent, lost on the homeward voyage by drainage into the\r\nhold, occasioning much positive loss to the owner, and giving the\r\nbilge-water a most offensive odor. He therefore recommends the use of\r\ndeep vessels, and avoidance of all agitation in this part of the\r\nprocess, so as to enable the crystallisable portion of the syrup to\r\neffect a more complete separation from the uncrystallisable portion or\r\nthe molasses. By this simple method, not only sugar of a finer and\r\nwhiter quality would be obtained, but a large per centage of loss both\r\nof crystallisable and uncrystallisable sugar at present caused by the\r\nleakage of the hogshead into the hold, would be prevented, not only to\r\nthe great advantage of the planter, but to the great comfort of the\r\ncaptain, passengers, and crew of the vessel freighted with it.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that, by re-boiling the molasses in the\r\nvacuum-pan, and employing tannin in the manner adopted in the process\r\nfor making sugar from beet-root, from one to five per cent. of\r\ncrystallisable sugar could be recovered from it, and this per centage\r\nmight possibly even be found to admit of increase by the further\r\ntreatment with lime-water and the gun-stock tree s already suggested,\r\nfor the first clarification of the liquor received from the mill. With\r\nthis view, Mr. Fownes recommends the substitution of puncheons, or\r\ncasks, for the molasses cisterns ordinarily employed in the\r\ncuring-house, to receive the molasses as it drains from the new sugar,\r\nand thus retaining it until after the busy period of crop time has\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\nShould sugar of a whiter quality than the ordinary muscovado of\r\ncommerce be desired, this advantage may be readily obtained, as Mr.\r\nFownes judiciously observes, by filtering the thin syrup, ready for\r\nthe vacuum-pan, through a bed of fine charcoal, as is done by the\r\nsugar refiners, and afterwards washing the crystals of sugar with\r\nwhite syrup, when the molasses has thoroughly drained from them. By\r\nthis process, which, however, is attended with some increase of\r\nexpense, and may not, in consequence, be always advisable, muscovado\r\nsugar may be obtained, of a quality hardly inferior to that of refined\r\nsugar. Mr. Fownes thus sums up the principal points to which he is\r\ndesirous of calling the attention of the intelligent and enterprising\r\nplanter.\r\n\r\n1. \"To obtain, by the use of a properly-constructed mill, the greatest\r\npossible amount of juice from the cane.\"\r\n\r\nBy this, according to Mr. Fownes, a gain of from 20 to 30 per cent.,\r\nequivalent to as much marketable sugar, may be obtained without any\r\nadditional expense; but as, from Mr. Fownes' own showing, there is a\r\nresiduum of 10 to 15 per cent of liquor obstinately retained by the\r\nmegass, or cane trash, after the most powerful pressure to which it\r\ncan be subjected; much, if not all, even of this loss might be\r\nprevented by subjecting the megass, on issuing from between the\r\nrollers, to the action of water for a brief time, passing it once more\r\nthrough the mill, and adding the saccharine solution so obtained, or\r\nthat obtained directly from the cane on its first crushing. The water\r\nthus employed would serve for many successive portions of megass,\r\nuntil at length it became so richly loaded with saccharine matter as\r\nto be worth attention in the boiling-house; or, at all events, it\r\nwould be serviceable for the cattle, who would fatten rapidly upon it.\r\nBy this additional process a further gain of at least five per cent.\r\nmight be expected, raising the total gain from improvements in this\r\n_first_ stage of the process, to from 25 to 35 per cent.\r\n\r\n2. \"To clarify and filter this juice with expedition, and to evaporate\r\nit rapidly, either over the open fire or by steam heat, as far as it\r\ncan be done with safety.\"\r\n\r\nBy the use of steam, not only is a vast economy of fuel effected, but\r\nthe temperature is maintained at a uniform and sufficient standard,\r\nand the liquor effectually guarded against the risks of carelessness\r\nor ignorance. Coal may be obtained on far cheaper terms, in exchange\r\nfor produce, from the United States or from Cape Breton, than from\r\nEngland; and as colliers from those quarters would find it their\r\ninterest to bring cargoes at their own risk, and take return cargoes\r\nof sugar, rum, or molasses, at the market price, the planter will be\r\ndoubly a gainer by the system, obtaining his fuel at a reduced rate,\r\nand having his trash and megass left free as manure for the use of his\r\ncane fields.\r\n\r\n3. \"To complete the concentration in a vacuum pan, or by other means,\r\nat a moderate temperature, not hurtful to the sugar, and facilitate\r\nthe natural process of crystallisation, so as to obtain sugar of a\r\nlarge and distinct grain.\"\r\n\r\n4. \"To drain and dry the sugar perfectly, and to save all the\r\nmolasses.\"\r\n\r\nThe advantages to be anticipated from these improvements, superadded\r\nto an improvement in cultivation, cannot be estimated at less, upon a\r\nmoderate calculation, than from 150 to 200 per cent. of increase in\r\nthe production of sugar, with hardly an appreciable increase of labor\r\nor expense; for we have, in the first place, a gain by improved\r\nculture of, at least, two hogsheads an acre in sugar, equivalent to\r\n100 per cent.; in the next, by employing improved mills and extracting\r\nthe residuum, 30 per cent.; by conducting the process of manufacture\r\nmore judiciously, 10 per cent.; and by the prevention of waste during\r\nthe transit to market, 10 per cent., making a total of at least 150\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nThe common sugar-mill consists of three cylinders, tightened either by\r\nwedges, if in a wooden frame, or by screws in a cast-iron frame. If in\r\nan iron frame, the above-mentioned noise is obviated, but the friction\r\nand loss of power is the same, which is ascertainable by subsequent\r\ninvestigation. The cylinders or rollers, which are moving either\r\nhorizontally or vertically, are from eighteen to twenty-four inches in\r\ndiameter, with bearings or shafts of one fourth of their diameter. If\r\nthe bearings or shafts of the cylinders were of less substance, they\r\ncould not resist the great strain to which they are subjected when in\r\noperation. The whole of the prime mover (steam-engine, water-wheel, or\r\nanimals), minus the friction of intermediate machinery, is transmitted\r\nto the plains of these rollers and resisted by their bearings; hence\r\nthe action is equal to a weight moving on low wheels of eighteen or\r\ntwenty-four inches in diameter, on axles of from four to six inches\r\nthickness, which weight is equal to the force applied; consequently,\r\nif the strain is greater than the resistance of the rollers or the\r\nbearings, they must be wrenched off, or if greater than the force\r\napplied, the mill will be stopped. The power necessary to move weights\r\nupon wheels, on a smooth and level surface, is in proportion to the\r\nrespective diameters of wheels and axles. The same pull which moves\r\none ton at a given velocity upon a wheel of two feet, with an axle of\r\nsix inches, will move four tons, if on a wheel of four feet diameter,\r\nwith an axle of six inches. Consequently, cylinders of small diameter,\r\nwith strong and substantial bearings, are only admissible as working\r\nmachines, if no other mechanical means are applicable, as, for\r\ninstance, in rolling out metals, compressing the surface of various\r\nbodies for a glossy appearance, or, generally speaking, to produce a\r\ncertain and equal form of the substance which is pressed and passed\r\nbetween them. They compress the atoms of bodies, and for this reason\r\nalone are ill suited to separate the fibres of the sugar canes, and to\r\nexpress effectively the saccharine matter between them. A practical\r\nproof of this demonstration is furnished by every sugar cane which has\r\ngone through the mill. Fresh megass is at present better suited for\r\nfattening animals than for fuel under the sugar pans.\r\n\r\nThe loss of material thus sustained, which is, on an average, equal in\r\nevery mill, whether driven by steam, water, or animal power, is\r\nentirely chargeable to the construction of the mill, and amounts to\r\nabout ten per cent. of the saccharine matter contained in the sugar\r\ncanes.\r\n\r\nM. Duprez, an agent of the French Government, having experimented on\r\nthe canes in Guadaloupe, found the quantity of juice in every 100 lbs.\r\ncrushed--\r\n\r\n                                                lbs.\r\n  1 By mills having horizontal rollers; the\r\n    motive power not stated                     61.2\r\n  2 By mills, motive power, steam               60.9\r\n  3 By mills, motive power, wind and steam      59.3\r\n  4 By mills, having vertical rollers           59.2\r\n  5 By mills, motive power, cattle              58.5\r\n  6 By mills, motive power, wind *              56.4\r\n\r\n  [* Dr. Evans' \"Treatise on Sugar,\" p. 75.]\r\n\r\nThe average of all these experiments being 56 per cent. only. The\r\nresult of M. Avequin, on Louisiana cane, was 50 per cent. Mr.\r\nThompson, of Jamaica, states 50 per cent. as the average throughout\r\nthe island of Martinique. Dr. Evans ventures 47 per cent. as the\r\nlowest, and 61 per cent. as the highest in the West Indies. A mill in\r\nMadeira gave 47.5 and 70.2 of juice--the larger yield being obtained\r\nby bracing the horizontal rollers more than usually tight, and\r\nintroducing only a few canes at a time, the motive power being cattle.\r\n\r\nThe three roller mill has the disadvantage of re-absorbing a part of\r\nthe cane juice in the spongy megass, (or trash as it is termed in the\r\nWest Indies), and a loss of power.\r\n\r\nThose with five rollers have been used in Cuba, Bourbon and the\r\nMauritius, which gave 70 per cent., but a great increase of motive\r\npower is necessary. Four roller mills, two below and two above,\r\nrequiring little more motive power than three rollers, have given 70\r\nto 75 per cent of juice.\r\n\r\nSome years since, the East India Company instituted inquiries relative\r\nto the cultivation of the sugar cane in Hindostan, and the information\r\nobtained was published in a large folio volume. The Reports furnished\r\nby their officers, from almost every district, concur in stating that\r\nthere were three kinds cultivated:--1. The purple. 2. The white. 3. A\r\nvariety of the white, requiring a large supply of water. The epitome\r\nof the Reports affords this information:--\r\n\r\n1. The purple colored cane yields a sweeter, richer juice, than the\r\nyellow or light colored, but in less quantity, and is harder to press.\r\nGrows on dry lands. Scarce any other sort in Beerbhoom, much in\r\nRadnagore, some about Santipore, mixed with light colored cane. Grows\r\nalso near Calcutta; in some fields separate, in others mixed with\r\npooree or light colored cane. When eaten raw, is more dry and pithy in\r\nthe mouth, but esteemed better sugar than the pooree, and appears to\r\nbe the superior sort of cane. Persons who have been West Indian\r\nplanters do not know it as a West Indian cane.\r\n\r\n2. The light colored cane, yellow, inclining to white; deeper yellow\r\nwhen ripe, and on rich ground, it is the same sort as that which grows\r\nin the West India Islands; softer, more juicy than the Cadjoolee, but\r\njuice less rich, and produces sugar less strong; requires seven maunds\r\nof pooree juice to make as much goor or inspissated juice as is\r\nproduced from six of the Cadjoolee. Much of this kind is brought to\r\nthe Calcutta markets, and eaten raw.\r\n\r\n3. The white variety, which grows in swampy, lands, is light colored,\r\nand grows to a great height. Its juice is more watery, and yields a\r\nweaker sugar than the Cadjoolee. However, as much of Bengal consists\r\nof low grounds, and as the upland canes are liable to suffer from\r\ndrought, it may be advisable to encourage the cultivation of it,\r\nshould the sugar it produces be approved, though in a less degree than\r\nother sugars, in order to guard against the effects of dry seasons.\r\nExperience alone can determine how far the idea of encouraging this\r\nsort may answer.\r\n\r\nBesides the foregoing, several kinds are now known to the Indian\r\nplanter. One of them, the China sugar cane, was considered by Dr.\r\nRoxburgh to be a distinct species, and distinguished by him as\r\n_Saccharum sinensis_. It was introduced into India in 1796, by Earl\r\nCornwallis, as being superior to the native kinds. It is characterised\r\nby a hardness which effectually resists most of the country rude\r\nmills; but this hardness is importantly beneficial, inasmuch as that\r\nit withstands the attack of the white ants, hogs, and jackals, which\r\ndestroy annually a large portion of the common cane.[18] Dr. Buchanan\r\nfound that four kinds are known in Mysore. Two of these are evidently\r\nthe purple and white generally known; but as this is not distinctly\r\nstated, I have retained the form in which he notices them. _Restali_,\r\nthe native sugar of the Mysore, can only be planted in the last two\r\nweeks of March and two first of April. It completes its growth in\r\ntwelve months, and does not survive for a second crop. Its cultivation\r\nhas been superseded by the other.\r\n\r\n_Putta-putti_.--This was introduced from Arcot, during the reign of\r\nHyder Ali. It is the only one from which the natives can extract\r\nsugar; it also produces the best _Bella_ or _Jaggery_. It can be\r\nplanted at the same season as the other, as well as at the end of July\r\nand beginning of August. It is fourteen months in completing its\r\ngrowth; but the stools produce a second crop, like the ratoons of the\r\nWest Indies, which ripen in twelve months.\r\n\r\n_Maracabo_, _Cuttaycabo_.--These two are very small, seldom exceeding\r\nhalf an inch in diameter; yet in some districts of Mysore, as about\r\nColar, the last-named is the variety usually cultivated; but this\r\narises from its requiring less water than the larger varieties.\r\n\r\nThe best varieties are those introduced from the Islands of Otaheite\r\nand Bourbon. Hindostan is indebted for their introduction to Captain\r\nSleeman, who brought them hither from the Mauritius in 1827. He\r\ncommitted them to Dr. Wallich, under whose care, at the Botanic\r\nGarden, they have flourished, and been the source from whence the\r\nbenefit has been generally diffused. Their superiority over those\r\nwhich have been usually cultivated by the natives has been completely\r\nestablished. The largest of the Hindostan canes, ripe and trimmed\r\nready for the mill, has never been found to exceed five pounds; but it\r\nis not uncommon for an Otaheite cane,[19] under similar circumstances,\r\nto weigh seven pounds. The extra weight arises proportionately from an\r\nincreased secretion of superior sap. The sugar is more abundant,\r\ngranulates more readily, and has less scum. Other superior qualities\r\nare, that the canes ripen earlier, and are less injured by the\r\noccurrence of protracted dry weather.\r\n\r\nOf the history of the sugar cane a popular tradition obtains amongst\r\nthe natives, that, in very ancient times, a vessel belonging to their\r\ncountry chanced by accident to leave one of her crew, under a\r\ndesperate fit of sickness, at a desert island, at a considerable\r\ndistance in the Eastern Seas, and that, returning by the same route,\r\ncuriosity prompted them to inquire after the fate of their companion,\r\nwhen, to their utter astonishment, the man presented himself to their\r\nview, completely recovered from his sickness, and even in a state of\r\nmore than common health. With anxiety they inquired for the physic he\r\nhad so successfully applied, and were conducted by him to the sugar\r\ncane, on which he acquainted them he had solely subsisted from the\r\ntime of their departure. Attracted by such powerful recommendation,\r\nevery care and attention was bestowed, we may suppose, to convey such\r\nan invaluable acquisition to their own lands, where the soil and\r\nclimate have mutually since contributed to its present prosperity.\r\n\r\n_Soil_.--The soil best suiting the sugar cane is aluminous rather than\r\nthe contrary, tenacious without being heavy, readily allowing\r\nexcessive moisture to drain away, yet not light. One gentleman, Mr.\r\nBallard, has endeavoured to make this point clear by describing the\r\nmost favorable soils about Gazepore as \"_light clays_,\" called there\r\n_Mootearee_, or _doansa_, according as there is more or less sand in\r\ntheir composition.--_Trans. Agri-Hort. Soc._ i. 121.\r\n\r\nMr. Peddington seems to think that calcareous matter, and iron in the\r\nstate of _peroxide_, are essential to be present in a soil for the\r\nproduction of the superior sugar cane. There can be no doubt that the\r\ncalcareous matter is necessary, but experience is opposed to his\r\nopinion relative to the peroxide.\r\n\r\nThe soil preferred at Radnagore is there distinguished as the soil of\r\n\"two qualities,\" being a mixture of rich clay and sand, and which Mr.\r\nTouchet believed to be known in England as a light brick mould.\r\n\r\nAbout Rungpore, Dinajpoor, and other places where the ground is low,\r\nthey raise the beds where the cane is to be planted four or five feet\r\nabove the level of the land adjacent.\r\n\r\nThe experience of Dr. Roxburgh agrees with the preceding statements.\r\nHe says, \"The soil that suits the cane best in this climate is, a rich\r\nvegetable earth, which on exposure to the air readily crumbles down\r\ninto very fine mould. It is also necessary for it to be of such a\r\nlevel as allows of its being watered from the river by simply damming\r\nit up (which almost the whole of the land adjoining to this river, the\r\nGodavery, admits of), and yet so high as to be easily drained during\r\nheavy rains. Such a soil, and in such a situation, having been well\r\nmeliorated by various crops of leguminous plants, or fallowing, for\r\ntwo or three years, is slightly manured, or has had for some time\r\ncattle pent upon it. A favourite manure for the cane with the Hindoo\r\nfarmer is the rotten straw of green and black pessaloo (_Phaseolus\r\nMungo max_).\"[20] Many accordant opinions might be added to the\r\npreceding, but it seems only necessary to observe further, that \"the\r\nsugar cane requires a soil sufficiently elevated to be entirely free\r\nfrom inundation, but not so high as to be deprived of moisture, or as\r\nto encourage the production of white ants (_termes_).\"\r\n\r\nThe sugar cane is an exhausting crop, and it is seldom cultivated by\r\nthe ryot more frequently than once in three or four years on the same\r\nland. During the intermediate period, such plants are grown as are\r\nfound to improve the soil, of which, says Dr. Tennant, the Indian\r\nfarmer is a perfect judge. They find the leguminous tribe the best for\r\nthe purpose. Such long intervals of repose from the cane would not be\r\nrequisite if a better system of manuring were adopted.\r\n\r\nMr. J. Prinsep has recorded the following analysis of three soils\r\ndistinguished for producing sugar. They were all a soft, fine-grained\r\nalluvium, without pebbles. No. 1 was from a village called Mothe, on\r\nthe Sarjee, about ten miles north of the Ganges, at Buxar, and the\r\nothers from the south bank of the Ganges, near the same place. There\r\nis a substratum of _kunkar_ throughout the whole of that part of the\r\ncountry, and to some mixture of this earth with the surface soil the\r\nfertility of the latter is ascribed:--\r\n\r\n                                                       1     2     3\r\n  Hygrometric moisture, on drying at 212 deg.         2.5   2.1   3.6\r\n  Carbonaceous and vegetable matter, on calcination   1.8   2.1   4.0\r\n  Carbonate of lime (No. 3 effervesced)               1.6   0.6   3.9\r\n  Alkaline salt, soluble                              1.0   1.1   0.3\r\n  Silex and alumina                                  94.1  94.1  88.2\r\n                                                    ----- ----- -----\r\n                                                    100.0 100.0 100.0\r\n\r\nThe earths unfortunately were not separated. Mr. Prinsep says the two\r\nfirst were chiefly of sand, and the third somewhat argillaceous. The\r\nformer required irrigation, but the other was sufficiently retentive\r\nof moisture to render it unnecessary.--(Journ. Asiatic Soc., ii. 435.)\r\n\r\n_Manures_.--The sugar cane being one of the most valued crops of the\r\nryot, he always devotes to it a portion of the fertilising matters he\r\nhas at command, though in every instance this is too small.\r\n\r\nIn the Rajahmundry district, previously to planting, the soil is\r\nslightly manured, either by having cattle folded upon it, or by a\r\nlight covering of the rotten straw of the green and black pessalloo,\r\nwhich is here a favourite fertiliser. In some parts of Mysore the mud\r\nfrom the bottom of tanks is employed, and this practice is more\r\ngenerally adopted in other places. Thus the fields being divided by\r\ndeep ditches in Dinajpoor, the mud from which is enriched by the\r\nremains of decayed aquatic plants and animals, forms an excellent\r\nmanure for the sugar cane, and of this the ryots make use, spreading\r\nit over the surface before the ploughing is commenced; and when that\r\noperation is completed, the soil is further fertilised by a dressing\r\nof oil-cake and ashes.\r\n\r\nCrushed bones would unquestionably be of the greatest benefit if\r\napplied to the sugar cane crop. Not only would their animal matter\r\nserve as food for the plants, but the phosphate of lime of the bones\r\nis one of the chief saline constituents of the sugar cane.\r\n\r\nSalt is another valuable manure for this crop. Dr. Nugent, in a Report\r\nmade to the Agricultural Society of Antigua, observes that salt has\r\nbeen found a valuable auxiliary in cultivating the sugar cane. Many\r\ntrials of it, he says, have been made during successive seasons,\r\napplied generally to the extent of about nine or ten bushels per acre.\r\nIt destroys grubs and other insects, and gives the canes an increased\r\nvigor and ability to resist drought. It is a singular remark of the\r\nintelligent traveller, M. de Humboldt, while speaking of the practice\r\nadopted in the Missions of the Orinoco, when a coco-nut plantation is\r\nmade, of throwing a certain quantity of salt into the hole which\r\nreceives the nut; that of all the plants cultivated by man there are\r\nonly the sugar cane, the plantain, the mammee, and the Avocado pear,\r\nwhich endure equally irrigation with fresh and salt water.\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies, when the cane is affected by what is called there\r\nthe _blast_, which is a withering or drying up of the plants, an\r\nunfailing remedy is found to be watering them with an infusion of dung\r\nin salt water.[21] _Preparation of soil_.--In the Rajahmundry\r\ndistrict, during the months of April and May, the ground is frequently\r\nploughed, until brought into a very fine tilth. About the end of May,\r\nor beginning of June, the rains usually commence, and the canes are\r\nthen to be planted. If the rains do not set in so early, the land is\r\nflooded artificially, and when converted into a soft mud, whether by\r\nthe rain or by flooding, the canes are planted.\r\n\r\nIn Mysore the ground is watered for three days, and then, after drying\r\nfor the same period, ploughing commences, this operation being\r\nrepeated five times during the following eight days. The clods during\r\nthis time are broken small by an instrument called _colkudali_. The\r\nfield is then manured and ploughed a sixth time. After fifteen days it\r\nis ploughed again, twice in the course of one or two days. After a\r\nlapse of eight days it is ploughed a ninth time. Altogether these\r\noperations occupy about forty-four days.\r\n\r\nFor planting, which is done six days, an implement called _yella\r\nkudali_ is employed.\r\n\r\nIn Dinajpoor, \"the field, from about the middle of October until about\r\nthe 10th of January, receives ten or twelve double ploughings, and\r\nafter each is smoothed with the _moyi_. During the last three months\r\nof this time it is manured with cow-dung and mud from ponds and\r\nditches. On this account, the land fit for sugar cane is generally\r\ndivided into fields by wide ditches, into which much mud is washed by\r\nthe rain, and is again thrown on the fields when the country dries,\r\nand leaves it enriched by innumerable aquatic vegetables and animals\r\nthat have died as the water left them. When the ploughing has been\r\ncompleted, the field is manured with ashes and oil-cake.\"\r\n\r\nAbout Malda, \"the land is first ploughed in the month of Cartick,\r\nlength and breadth ways, and harrowed in like manner; four or five\r\ndays after it is again ploughed and harrowed, as before, twice. In the\r\nmonth of Aghun, the whole land is covered with fresh earth, again\r\ntwice ploughed, and harrowed in different directions, and then manured\r\nwith dung. Fifteen or twenty days afterwards it is to be twice\r\nploughed, as before; eight or ten days after which, it is to be\r\nslightly manured with dung, and the refuse of oil, mixed together;\r\nthen twice ploughed and harrowed in different directions, so that the\r\nclods of earth brought be well mixed together with the land. This\r\npreparation continues until the 20th or 25th of the month Pows.\"\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of Dacca, during \"Cautic or Augun (October, November)\r\nthe Ryots begin to prepare their ground. They first dig a trench round\r\ntheir fields, and raise a mound of about three feet in height. If the\r\nground to be cultivated is waste, about nine inches of the surface\r\nare taken off, and thrown without the enclosure. The ground is\r\nploughed to the depth of nine inches more. The clods are broken, and\r\nthe earth made fine. In Maug or Faugun (January, February) the sugar\r\ncane is planted; a month afterwards earth is raised about the plants;\r\nafter another month this is repeated. The crop is cut in Poous and\r\nMaug (December, January). If the ground be not waste, but cultivated,\r\nthe surface is not taken off. After cutting the crop, it is not usual\r\nagain to grow sugar cane on the same ground for eighteen months, on\r\naccount of the indifferent produce afforded by a more early planting.\r\n\r\nIn the Zillah, North Mooradabad, the land is broken up at the end of\r\nJune. After the rains have ceased it is manured, and has eight or ten\r\nploughings. This clears it of weeds. In February it is again manured\r\nand ploughed four or five times, and just before the sets are planted,\r\nsome dung, four cart-loads to each cutcha beegah of low land, and five\r\ncart-loads to high land, are added. The land is well rolled after the\r\nfour last ploughings, and again after the cuttings are set.\r\n\r\nAbout Benares and the neighbouring districts, Mr. Haines says, that\r\nowing to the hot winds which prevail \"from March until the setting in\r\nof the annual rains in June or July, the lands remain fallow till that\r\nperiod. In the mean time, those fields that are selected for sugar\r\ncane are partially manured by throwing upon them all manner of rubbish\r\nthey can collect, and by herding their buffaloes and cattle upon them\r\nat night, though most of the manure from the latter source is again\r\ncollected and dried for fuel.\r\n\r\nWhen the annual rains have fairly set in, and the Assarree crops sown\r\n(in some instances I have seen an Assarree crop taken from the lands\r\nintended for sugar cane), they commence ploughing the cane lands, and\r\ncontinue to do so four or five times monthly (as they consider the\r\ngreater number of times the fields are turned up at this period of the\r\nseason, the better the crop of cane will be), till the end of October,\r\ncontinuing to throw on the little manure they can collect.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of October, and in November, their ploughs are much\r\nengaged in sowing their winter (or rubbee) crops of wheat, barley,\r\ngrain, &c.; and at this period they make arrangements with the\r\nshepherds who have large flocks of sheep, to fold them upon the fields\r\nat night, for which they pay so much per beegah in grain.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of November, and early in December, the fields\r\nare again ploughed well, and all grass, weeds, &c., removed with the\r\nhoe; then the surface of the field is made as smooth as possible by\r\nputting the hengah (a piece of wood eight to ten feet in length, and\r\nfive to six inches in breadth, and three or four inches in thickness,\r\ndrawn by two pairs of bullocks, and the man standing upon the wood to\r\ngive it weight), over several times for three or four days in\r\nsuccession. This makes the surface of the field very even and somewhat\r\nhard, which prevents the sun and dry west wind from abstracting the\r\nmoisture, which is of great importance at this period of the season,\r\nfor, should there be no rain, there would not be sufficient moisture\r\nat the time of planting the cane to cause vegetation.\r\n\r\nIn this state the land remains till the time of planting the cane\r\ncuttings, which is generally the 1st to the 15th of February; but\r\nshould there have been a fall of rain in the mean time, or excess of\r\nmoisture appear, the field is again ploughed, and the hengah put over\r\nas before.\r\n\r\nA day or two previous to planting the cane, the field is ploughed and\r\nthe hengah lightly put over.\"--(Trans. Agri-Hort. Soc. vi. 4, 5.)\r\n\r\n_Sets_.--When the canes are cut at harvest time, twelve or eighteen\r\ninches of their tops are usually taken off, and stored, to be employed\r\nfor sets. Each top has several joints, from each of which a shoot\r\nrises, but seldom more than one or two arrive at a proper growth.\r\n\r\nWhen first cut from the stem, the tops intended for plants are tied in\r\nbundles of forty or fifty each, and are carefully kept moist. In a few\r\ndays they put forth new leaves: they are then cleared of the old\r\nleaves, and separately dipped into a mixture of cow-dung, pressed\r\nmustard seed, and water. A dry spot is prepared, and rich loose mould\r\nand a small quantity of pressed mustard-seed; the plants are\r\nseparately placed therein, a small quantity of earth strewed amongst\r\nthem, and then covered with leaves and grass to preserve them from\r\nheat. Ten or twelve days afterwards they are planted in the fields.\r\n\r\nIn Burdwan, the tops, before they are planted, are cut into pieces\r\nfrom four to six inches long, so that there are not more than four\r\nknots in each. Two or three of these plant tops are put together in\r\nthe ground, and a beegah requires from 7,500 to 10,240 plants.\r\n\r\nIn Rungpore and Dinajpoor, about 9,000 plants are required for a\r\nbeegah, each being about a foot in length.\r\n\r\nIn Beerbhoom, 3,000 plants are said to be requisite for a beegah, each\r\ncane top being about fifteen inches long.\r\n\r\nNear Calcutta, from 3,000 to 8,000 plants are required for a beegah,\r\naccording to the goodness of the soil, the worst soil needing most\r\nplants. In Mysore an acre contains 2,420 stools, and yields about\r\n11,000 ripe canes.\r\n\r\nNear Rajahmundry, about 400 cuttings are planted on a cutcha beegah\r\n(one-eighth of an acre). In Zilla, North Mooradabad, 4,200 sets, each\r\neight inches long, are inserted upon each cutcha beegah of low land,\r\nand 5,250 upon high land.\r\n\r\nIn the district of Gollagore the Ryots cut a ripe cane into several\r\npieces, preserving two or three joints to each, and put them into a\r\nsmall bed of rich mould, dung, and mustard-seed from which the oil has\r\nbeen expressed. At Radnagore, when the time of cutting the canes\r\narrives, their tops are taken off, and these are placed upright in a\r\nbed of mud for thirty or forty days, and covered with leaves or straw.\r\nThe leaves are then stripped from them, and they are cut into pieces,\r\nnot having less than two nor more than four joints each. These sets\r\nare kept for ten or fifteen days in a bed prepared for them, from\r\nwhence they are taken and planted in rows two or three together,\r\neighteen inches or two feet intervening between each stool.\r\n\r\n_Planting_.--The time and mode of planting vary. In the Rajahmundry\r\nCircar, Dr. Roxburgh says, that \"during the months of April and May\r\nthe land is repeatedly ploughed with the common Hindoo plough, which\r\nsoon brings the loose rich soil (speaking of the Delta of the\r\nGodavery) into very excellent order. About the end of May and\r\nbeginning of June, the rains generally set in, in frequent heavy\r\nshowers. Now is the time to plant the cane; but should the rains hold\r\nback, the prepared field is watered or flooded from the river, and,\r\nwhile perfectly wet, like soft mud, the cane is planted.\r\n\r\n\"The method is most simple. Laborers with baskets of the cuttings, of\r\none or two joints each, arrange themselves along one side of the\r\nfield. They walk side by side, in as straight a line as their eye and\r\njudgment enable them, dropping the sets at the distance of about\r\neighteen inches asunder in rows, and about four feet from row to row.\r\nOther laborers follow, and with the foot press the set about two\r\ninches into the soft, mud-like soil, which, with a sweep or two with\r\nthe sole of the foot, they most easily and readily cover.\"--(Roxburgh\r\non the Culture of Sugar.)\r\n\r\nAbout Malda, in the month of Maug (January, February), the land is to\r\nbe twice ploughed, and harrowed repeatedly, length and breadth ways;\r\nafter which it is furrowed, the furrows half a cubit apart, in which\r\nthe plants are to be set at about four fingers' distance from each\r\nother, when the furrows are filled up with the land that lay upon its\r\nridges. The plants being thus set, the land is harrowed twice in\r\ndifferent directions; fifteen or twenty days afterwards the cane\r\nbegins to grow, when the weeds which appear with it must be taken up;\r\nten or twelve days after this the weeds will again appear. They must\r\nagain be taken up, and the earth at the roots of the canes be removed,\r\nwhen all the plants which have grown will appear.\r\n\r\nAt Ghazepore the rains set in at the beginning of March, and planting\r\nthen commences. Near Calcutta the planting takes place in May and\r\nJune. In Dinajpoor and Rungpore the planting time is February.\r\n\r\nAbout Commercolly it is performed in January. The field is divided\r\ninto beds six cubits broad, separated from each other by small\r\ntrenches fourteen inches wide and eight inches deep. In every second\r\ntrench are small wells, about two feet deep. The irrigating water\r\nflowing along the trenches fills the wells, and is taken thence and\r\napplied to the canes by hand.\r\n\r\nEach bed has five rows of canes. The sets are planted in holes about\r\nsix inches in diameter, and three deep; two sets, each having three\r\njoints, are laid horizontally in every hole, covered slightly with\r\nearth, and over this is a little dung.\r\n\r\nWhen, the canes are planted in the spring, the trenches must be\r\nfilled with water, and some poured into every hole. At the other\r\nseason of planting the trenches are full, it being rainy weather; but\r\neven then the sets must be watered for the first month.\r\n\r\nMr. Haines says that in Mirzapore and the neighbouring districts, \"in\r\nplanting the cane they commence a furrow round the field, in which\r\nthey drop the cuttings. The second furrow is left empty; cuttings\r\nagain in the third; so they continue dropping cuttings in every second\r\nfurrow till the whole field is completed, finishing in the centre of\r\nthe field. The field remains in this state till the second or third\r\nday, when for two or three days in succession it is made even and hard\r\nupon the surface with the hengah, as before stated.\"--(Trans.\r\nAgri-Hort. Soc. vi. 5.)\r\n\r\nMr. Vaupell, in describing the most successful mode of cultivating the\r\nMauritius sugar cane in Bombay, says, that \"after the ground is\r\nlevelled with the small plough, called 'paur,' in the manner of the\r\ncultivators, pits of two feet in diameter, and two feet in depth,\r\nshould be dug throughout the field at the distance of five feet apart,\r\nand filled with manure and soil to about three inches of the surface.\r\nSet in these pits your canes, cut in pieces about a foot and a half\r\nlong, laying them down in a triangular from, thus /\\. Keep as much of\r\nthe eyes or shoots of the cane uppermost as you can; then cover them\r\nwith manure and soil; beds should next be formed to retain water,\r\nhaving four pits in each bed, leaving passages for watering them. The\r\ncutting should be watered every third day during hot weather, and the\r\nfield should always be kept in a moist state.\"--(Ibid. iii. 43.)\r\n\r\nAbout Benares, the sets require, after planting, from four to six\r\nwaterings, until the rains commence, and as many hoeings to loosen the\r\nsurface, which becomes caked after every watering. The moister nature\r\nof the soil renders these operations generally unnecessary in Bengal.\r\n\r\n_After-culture._--In Mysore, the surface of the earth in the hollows\r\nin which the sets are planted is stirred with a stick as soon as the\r\nshoots appear, and a little dung is added. Next month the daily\r\nwatering is continued, and then the whole field dug over with the hoe,\r\na cavity being made round each stool, and a little dung added. In the\r\nthird month water is given every second day: at its close, if the\r\ncanes are luxuriant, the ground is again dug; but if weakly, the\r\nwatering is continued during the fourth month, before the digging is\r\ngiven. At this time the earth is drawn up about the canes, so as to\r\nleave the hollows between the rows at right angles with the trenches.\r\nNo more water is given to the plants, but the trenches between the\r\nbeds are kept full for three days. It is then left off for a week, and\r\nif rain occurs, no further water is requisite; but if the weather is\r\ndry, water is admitted once a week during the next month. The digging\r\nis then repeated, and the earth levelled with the hand about the\r\nstools.\r\n\r\nThe stems of each stool are ten or twelve in number, which are\r\nreduced to five or six by the most weakly of them being now removed.\r\nThe healthy canes are to be tied with one of their own leaves, two or\r\nthree together, to check their spreading; and this binding is repeated\r\nas required by their increased growth.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of rain, the trenches are filled with water once a\r\nfortnight.\r\n\r\nWhen the _Putta-putti_ is to be kept for a second crop, the dry leaves\r\ncut off in the crop season are burnt upon the field, and this is dug\r\nover, and trenches filled with water, and during six weeks the plants\r\nwatered once in every six or eight days (unless rain falls), and the\r\ndigging repeated three times, dung being added at each digging. The\r\nafter-culture is the same as for the first crop.\r\n\r\nIn the Upper Provinces, Dr. Tennant says, if moderate showers occur\r\nafter planting, nothing more is done until the shoots from the sets\r\nhave attained a height of two or three inches. The soil immediately\r\naround them is then loosened with a small weeding iron, something like\r\na chisel; but if the season should prove dry, the field is\r\noccasionally watered; the weeding is also continued, and the soil\r\noccasionally loosened about the plants.\r\n\r\nIn August, small trenches are cut through the field, with small\r\nintervals between them, for the purpose of draining off the water, if\r\nthe season is too wet. This is very requisite, for if the canes are\r\nnow supplied with too much moisture, the juice is rendered watery and\r\nunprofitable. If the season happens to be dry, the same dikes serve to\r\nconduct the irrigating water through the field, and to carry off what\r\ndoes not soak into the earth in a few hours. Stagnant water they\r\nconsider very injurious to the cane, and on the drains being well\r\ncontrived depends in a great measure the future hope of profit.\r\nImmediately after the field is trenched, the canes are propped. They\r\nare now about three feet high, and each set has produced from three to\r\nsix canes. The lower leaves of each are first carefully wrapt up\r\naround it, so as to cover it completely in every part; a small strong\r\nbamboo, eight or ten feet long, is then inserted firmly in the middle\r\nof each stool, and the canes tied to it. This secures them in an erect\r\nposition, and facilitates the circulation of the air.\r\n\r\nHoeing cannot be repeated too frequently. This is demonstrated by the\r\npractice of the most successful cultivators. In Zilla, N. Mooradabad,\r\nin April, about six weeks after planting, the earth on each side of\r\nthe cane-rows is loosened by a sharp-pointed hoe, shaped somewhat like\r\na bricklayer's trowel. This is repeated six times before the field is\r\nlaid out in beds and channels for irrigation. There, likewise, if the\r\nseason is unusually dry, the fields in the low ground are watered in\r\nMay and June. This supposes there are either nullahs, or ancient pucka\r\nwells, otherwise the canes are allowed to take their chance, for the\r\ncost of making a well on the uplands is from ten to twenty rupees--an\r\nexpense too heavy for an individual cultivator, and not many would dig\r\nin partnership, for they would fight for the water.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of Benares, as the canes advance in growth, they\r\ncontinue to wrap the leaves as they begin to wither up round the\r\nadvancing stem, and to tie this to the bamboo higher up. If the\r\nweather continue wet, the trenches are carefully kept open; and, on\r\nthe other hand, if dry weather occurs, water is occasionally supplied.\r\nHoeing is also performed every five or six weeks. Wrapping the leaves\r\naround the cane is found to prevent them cracking by the heat of the\r\nsun, and hinders their throwing out lateral branches.\r\n\r\nIn January and February the canes are ready for cutting. The average\r\nheight of the cane is about nine feet, foliage included, and the naked\r\ncane from one inch to one inch and a quarter in diameter.\r\n\r\nNear Maduna, the hand-watering is facilitated by cutting a small\r\ntrench down the centre of each bed. The beds are there a cubit wide,\r\nbut only four rows of canes are planted in each.\r\n\r\nIt is deserving of notice, that the eastern and north-eastern parts of\r\nBengal are more subject to rain at every season of the year, but\r\nespecially in the hot months, than the western; which accounts for the\r\nland being prepared and the plants set so much earlier in Rungpore\r\nthan in Beerbhoom. This latter country has also a dryer soil\r\ngenerally; for this reason, so much is said in the report from thence\r\nof the necessity of watering.\r\n\r\nThe Benares country is also dryer than Bengal, therefore more\r\nwaterings are requisite.\r\n\r\nAt Malda, ten or fifteen days after the earth has been removed from\r\nthe roots of the canes and the plants have appeared, the land is to be\r\nslightly manured, well cleared of weeds, and the earth that was\r\nremoved again laid about the canes; after which, ten or fifteen days,\r\nit must be well weeded, and again twenty or twenty-five days\r\nafterwards. This mode of cultivation it is necessary to follow until\r\nthe month of Joystee. The land must be ploughed and manured between\r\nthe rows of canes in the month of Assaar; after which, fifteen or\r\ntwenty days, the canes are to be tied two or three together with the\r\nleaves, the earth about them well cleaned, and the earth that was\r\nploughed up laid about the roots of the canes something raised. In the\r\nmonth of Saubun, twenty or twenty-five days from the preceding\r\noperation, the canes are tied as before, and again ten or fifteen days\r\nafterwards; which done, nine or ten clumps are then to be tied\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nIn the Rojahmundry Circar, on the Delta of the Godavery, Dr. Roxburgh\r\nstates, \"that nothing more is done after the cane is planted, if the\r\nweather be moderately showery, till the young shoots are some two or\r\nthree inches high; the earth is then loosened for a few inches round\r\nthem with the weeding iron. Should the season prove dry, the field is\r\noccasionally watered from the river, continuing to weed and to keep\r\nthe ground loose round the stools. In August, two or three months from\r\nthe time of planting, small trenches are cut through the field at\r\nshort distances, and so contrived as to serve to drain off the water,\r\nshould the season prove too wet for the canes, which is often the\r\ncase, and would render their juices weak and unprofitable. The farmer,\r\ntherefore, never fails to have his field plentifully and judiciously\r\nintersected with drains while the cane is small, and before the usual\r\ntime for the violent rains. Immediately after the field is trenched,\r\nthe canes are all propped; this is an operation which seems peculiar\r\nto these parts.\r\n\r\nIn Dinajpoor, in about a month after planting, \"the young plants are\r\ntwo or three inches high; the earth is then raised from the cuttings\r\nby means of a spade, and the dry leaves by which they are surrounded\r\nare removed. For a day or two they remain exposed to the air, and are\r\nthen manured with ashes and oil-cake, and covered with earth. Weeds\r\nmust be removed as they spring; and when the plants are about a cubit\r\nhigh, the field must be ploughed. When they have grown a cubit higher,\r\nwhich is between the 13th of June and 14th of July, they are tied\r\ntogether in bundles of three or four, by wrapping them round with\r\ntheir own leaves. This is done partly to prevent them from being laid\r\ndown by the wind, and partly to prevent them from being eaten by\r\njackals. During the next month three or four of these bunches are tied\r\ntogether; and about the end of September, when the canes grow rank,\r\nthey are supported by bamboo stakes driven in the ground. They are cut\r\nbetween the middle of December and the end of March.\"\r\n\r\nIf the canes grow too vigorously, developing a superabundance of\r\nleaves, it is a good practice to remove those leaves which are\r\ndecayed, that the stems may be exposed fully to the sun. In the West\r\nIndies, this is called _trashing_ the canes. It requires discretion;\r\nfor in dry soils or seasons, or if the leaves are removed before\r\nsufficiently dead, more injury than benefit will be occasioned.\r\n\r\n_Harvesting_.--The season in which the canes become ripe in various\r\ndistricts has already been noticed when considering their cultivation.\r\nIn addition I may state, that in the Rajahmundry Circar, about the\r\nmouth of the Godavery, Dr. Roxburgh adds, \"that in January and\r\nFebruary the canes begin to be ready to cut, which is about nine\r\nmonths from the time of planting. This operation is the same as in\r\nother sugar countries--of course I need not describe it. Their height,\r\nwhen standing on the field, will be from eight to ten feet (foliage\r\nincluded), and the naked cane from an inch to an inch and a quarter in\r\ndiameter.\"\r\n\r\nIn Malda, the canes are cut in January and February. In N. Mooradabad,\r\nupon the low land, the canes are ripe in October, and upon the high\r\nlands a month later. The fitness of the cane for cutting may be\r\nascertained by making an incision across the cane, and observing the\r\ninternal grain. If it is soft and moist, like a turnip, it is not yet\r\nripe; but if the face of the cut is dry, and white particles appear,\r\nit is fit for harvesting.--(_Fitzmaurice on the Culture of the Sugar\r\nCane_.)\r\n\r\n_Injuries_.--1. _A wet season_, either during the very early or in the\r\nconcluding period of the cane's vegetation, is one of the worst causes\r\nof injury. In such a season, the absence of the usual intensity of\r\nlight and heat causes the sap to be very materially deficient in\r\nsaccharine matter. But, on the other hand,\r\n\r\n2. _A very dry season_, immediately after the sets are planted, though\r\nthe want of rain may in some degree be supplied by artificial means,\r\ncauses the produce to be but indifferent. These inconveniences are of\r\na general nature, and irremediable.\r\n\r\n3. _Animals_.--In India not only the incursions of domesticated\r\nanimals, but in some districts of the wild elephant, buffalo, and hog,\r\nare frequent sources of injury. Almost every plantation is liable,\r\nalso, to the attack of the jackal, and rats are destructive enemies.\r\n\r\n4. _White Ants_.--The sets of the sugar cane have to be carefully\r\nwatched, to preserve them from the white ant (_Termes fatalis_), to\r\nattacks from which they are liable until they have begun to shoot. To\r\nprevent this injury, the following mixture has been recommended:--\r\n\r\n  Asafoetida (hing),                    8 chittacks.\r\n  Mustard-seed cake (sarsum ki khalli), 8 seers.\r\n  Putrid fish,                          4 seers.\r\n  Bruised butch root,                   2 seers;\r\n     or muddur,                         2 seers.\r\n\r\nMix the above together in a large vessel, with water sufficient to\r\nmake them into the thickness of curds; then steep each slip of cane in\r\nit for half an hour after planting; and, lastly, water the lines three\r\ntimes previous to setting the cane, by irrigating the water-course\r\nwith water mixed up with bruised butch root, or muddur if the former\r\nbe not procurable.[22] A very effectual mode of destroying the white\r\nant, is by mixing a small quantity of arsenic with a few ounces of\r\nburned bread, pulverised flour, or oatmeal, moistened with molasses,\r\nand placing pieces of the dough thus made, each about the size of a\r\nturkey's egg, on a flat board, and covered over with a wooden bowl, in\r\nseveral parts of the plantation. The ants soon take possession of\r\nthese, and the poison has a continuous effect, for the ants which die\r\nare eaten by those which succeed them.[23] They are said to be driven\r\nfrom a soil by frequently hoeing it. They are found to prevail most\r\nupon newly broken-up lands.\r\n\r\nIn Central India, the penetration of the white ants into the interior\r\nof the sets, and the consequent destruction of the latter, is\r\nprevented by dipping each end into buttermilk, asafoetida, and\r\npowdered mustard-seed, mixed into a thick compound.\r\n\r\n5. _Storms_.--Unless they are very violent, Dr. Roxburgh observes,\r\n\"they do no great harm, because the canes are propped. However, if\r\nthey are once laid down, which sometimes happens, they become branchy\r\nand thin, yielding a poor, watery juice.\"\r\n\r\n6. _The Worm_ \"is another evil, which generally visits them every few\r\nyears. A beetle deposits its eggs in the young canes; the caterpillars\r\nof these remain in the cane, living on its medullary parts, till they\r\nare ready to be metamorphosed into the chrysalis state. Sometimes this\r\nevil is so great as to injure a sixth or an eighth part of the field;\r\nbut, what is worse, the disease is commonly general when it\r\nhappens--few fields escaping.\"\r\n\r\n7. _The Flowering_ \"is the last accident they reckon upon, although it\r\nscarce deserves the name, for it rarely happens, and never but to a\r\nvery small proportion of some few fields. Those canes that flower have\r\nvery little juice left, and it is by no means so sweet as that of the\r\nrest.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Brazils, the fact of the slave trade being at an end must\r\ninfluence the future produce of sugar, and attention has been lately\r\nchiefly directed to coffee, cotton, and other staples. The exports of\r\nthat empire in 1842, were 59,000 tons; in 1843, 54,500; in 1844,\r\n76,400; in 1845, 91,000; average of these four years 69,720. The\r\nexports in the next four years averaged 96,150 tons, viz:--76,100, in\r\n1846; 96,300, in 1847; 112,500, in 1848; and 99,700, in 1849.\r\n\r\n_Mode of Cultivation in Brazil_.--The lands in Brazil are never\r\ngrubbed up, either for planting the sugar cane, or for any other\r\nagricultural purposes. The inconveniences of this custom are\r\nperceivable more particularly in high lands; because all of these that\r\nare of any value are naturally covered with thick woods. The cane is\r\nplanted amongst the numerous stumps of trees, by which means much\r\nground is lost, and as the sprouts from these stumps almost\r\nimmediately spring forth (such is the rapidity of vegetation) the\r\ncleanings are rendered very laborious. These shoots require to be cut\r\ndown sometimes, even before the cane has found its way to the surface\r\nof the ground. The labor likewise is great every time a piece of land\r\nis to be put under cultivation, for the wood must be cut down afresh;\r\nand although it cannot have reached the same size which the original\r\ntimber had attained, still as several years are allowed to pass\r\nbetween each period at which the ground is planted, the trees are\r\ngenerally of considerable thickness. The wood is suffered to remain\r\nupon the land until the leaves become dry; then it is set on fire, and\r\nthese are destroyed with the brush wood and the smaller branches of\r\nthe trees. Heaps are now made of the remaining timber, which is\r\nlikewise burnt. This process is universally practised in preparing\r\nland for the cultivation of any plant. I have often heard the method\r\nmuch censured as being injurious in the main to the soil, though the\r\ncrop immediately succeeding the operation may be rendered more\r\nluxuriant by it. I have observed that the canes which grew upon the\r\nspots where the heaps of timber and large branches of trees had been\r\nburnt, were of a darker and richer green than those around them, and\r\nthat they likewise over-topped them. After the plant-canes, or those\r\nof the first year's growth, are taken from the lands, the field-trash,\r\nthat is the dried leaves and stems of the canes which remain upon the\r\nground, are set fire to, with the idea that the ratoons,--that is, the\r\nsprouts from the old roots of the canes,--spring forth with more\r\nluxuriance, and attain a greater size by means of this practice. The\r\nratoons of the first year are called in Brazil, _socas_; those of the\r\nsecond year, _resocas_; those of the third year, _terceiras socas_,\r\nand so forth. After the roots are left unencumbered by burning the\r\nfield-trash, the mould is raised round about them; indeed, if this was\r\nneglected, many of those roots would remain too much exposed to the\r\nheat of the sun, and would not continue to vegetate.\r\n\r\nSome lands will continue to give ratoons for five, or even seven\r\nyears; but an average may be made at one crop of good ratoons fit for\r\ngrinding, another of inferior ratoons fit for planting, or for making\r\nmolasses to be used in the still-house, and a third which affords but\r\na trifling profit, in return for the trouble which the cleanings give.\r\n\r\nI have above spoken more particularly of high lands. The low and\r\nmarshy grounds, called in Brazil, _varzeas_, are, however, those which\r\nare the best adapted to the cane; and, indeed, upon the plantations\r\nthat do not possess some portions of this description of soil the\r\ncrops are very unequal, and sometimes almost entirely fail, according\r\nto the greater or less quantity of rain, which may chance to fall in\r\nthe course of the year. The _varzeas_ are usually covered with short\r\nand close brushwood, and as these admit, from their rank nature, of\r\nfrequent cultivation, they soon become easy to work. The soil of\r\nthese, when it is new, receives the name of _paul_; it trembles under\r\nthe pressure of the feet, and easily admits of a pointed stick being\r\nthrust into it; and though dry to appearance requires draining. The\r\n_macape_ marl is often to be met with in all situations; it is of a\r\ngreenish white color, and if at all wet, it sticks very much to the\r\nhoe; it becomes soon dry at the surface, but the canes which have been\r\nplanted upon it seldom fail to revive after rain, even though a want\r\nof it should have been much felt. The white marl, _barro branco_, is\r\nless frequently found; it is accounted extremely productive. This clay\r\nis used in making bricks and coarse earthenware, and also for claying\r\nthe sugar. Red earth is occasionally met with upon sides of hills near\r\nto the coast; but this description of soil belongs properly to the\r\ncotton districts. Black mould is common, and likewise a loose brownish\r\nsoil, in which a less or greater proportion of sand is intermixed. It\r\nis, I believe, generally acknowledged that no land can be too rich for\r\nthe growth of the sugar cane. One disadvantage, however, attends soil\r\nthat is low and quite new, which is, that the canes run up to a great\r\nheight without sufficient thickness, and are thus often lodged (or\r\nblown down) before the season for cutting them arrives. I have seen\r\nrice planted upon lands of this kind on the first year to decrease\r\ntheir rankness, and render them better adapted to the cane on the\r\nsucceeding season. Some attempts have been made to plant cane upon the\r\nlands which reach down to the edge of the mangroves, and in a few\r\ninstances pieces of land heretofore covered by the salt water at the\r\nflow of the tide, have been laid dry by means of draining for the same\r\npurpose; but the desired success has not attended the plan, for the\r\ncanes have been found to be unfit for making sugar; the syrup does not\r\ncoagulate, or at least does not attain that consistence which is\r\nrequisite, and therefore it can only be used for the distilleries.\r\n\r\nThe general mode of preparing the land for the cane is by holing it\r\nwith hoes. The negroes stand in a row, and each man strikes his hoe\r\ninto the ground immediately before him, and forms a trench of five or\r\nsix inches in depth; he then falls back, the whole row doing the same,\r\nand they continue this operation from one side of the cleared land to\r\nthe other, or from the top of a hill to the bottom. The earth which is\r\nthrown out of the trench remains on the lower side of it. In the\r\nBritish West India colonies this work is done in a manner nearly\r\nsimilar, but more systematically. The lands in Brazil are not\r\nmeasured, and everything is done by the eye. The quantity of cane\r\nwhich a piece will require for planting is estimated by so many\r\ncart-loads; and nothing can be more vague than this mode of\r\ncomputation, for the load which a cart can carry depends upon the\r\ncondition of the oxen, upon the nature of the road, and upon the\r\nlength of the cane. Such is the awkward make of these vehicles, that\r\nmuch nicety is necessary in packing them, and if two canes will about\r\nfit into a cart lengthways, much more will be conveyed than if the\r\ncanes are longer and they double over each other.\r\n\r\nThe plough is sometimes used in low lands, upon which draining has not\r\nbeen found necessary; but such is the clumsy construction of the\r\nmachine of which they make use, that six oxen are yoked to it. A\r\nplough drawn by two oxen, constructed after a model which was brought\r\nfrom Cayenne, has been introduced in one or two instances. Upon high\r\nlands the stumps of the trees almost preclude the possibility of thus\r\nrelieving the laborers. The trenches being prepared, the cuttings are\r\nlaid longitudinally in the bottom of them, and are covered with the\r\ngreatest part of the mould which had been taken out of the trench. The\r\nshoots begin to rise above the surface of the ground in the course of\r\ntwelve or fourteen days. The canes undergo three cleanings from the\r\nweeds and the sprouts proceeding from the stumps of the trees; and\r\nwhen the land is poor, and produces a greater quantity of the former,\r\nand contains fewer of the latter, the canes require to be cleaned a\r\nfourth time. The cuttings are usually 12 to 18 inches in length, but\r\nit is judged that the shorter they are the better. If they are short,\r\nand one piece of cane rots, the space which remains vacant is not so\r\nlarge as when the cuttings are long, and they by any accident fail.\r\nThe canes which are used for planting are generally ratoons, if any\r\nexist upon the plantation; but if there are none of these, the\r\ninferior plant canes supply their places. It is accounted more\r\neconomical to make use of the ratoons for this purpose; and many\r\npersons say that they are less liable to rot than the plant canes. In\r\nthe British sugar islands the cuttings for planting are commonly the\r\ntops of the canes which have been ground for sugar. But in Brazil the\r\ntops of the canes are all thrown to the cattle, for there is usually a\r\nwant of grass during the season that the mills are at work. In the\r\nBritish colonies, the canes are at first covered with only a small\r\nportion of mould, and yet they are as long in forcing their way to the\r\nsurface as in Brazil, though in the latter a more considerable\r\nquantity of earth is laid upon them. I suppose that the superior\r\nrichness of the Brazilian soil accounts for this. Upon rich soils the\r\ncuttings are laid at a greater distance, and the trenches are dug\r\nfarther from each other, than upon those which have undergone more\r\nfrequent cultivation, or which are known to possess less power from\r\ntheir natural composition. The canes which are planted upon the former\r\nthrow out great numbers of sprouts, which spread each way; and,\r\nalthough when they are young, the land may appear to promise but a\r\nscanty crop, they soon close, and no opening is to be seen. It is\r\noften judged proper to thin the canes, by removing some of the suckers\r\nat the time that the last cleaning is given; and some persons\r\nrecommend that a portion of the dry leaves should also be stripped off\r\nat the same period, but on other plantations this is not practised.\r\n\r\nThe proper season for planting is from the middle of July to the\r\nmiddle of September, upon high lands, and from September to the middle\r\nof November in low lands. Occasionally, the great moisture of the soil\r\ninduces the planter to continue his work until the beginning of\r\nDecember, if his people are sufficiently numerous to answer all the\r\nnecessary purposes. The first of the canes are ready to be cut for the\r\nmill in September of the following year, and the crop is finished\r\nusually in January or February. In the British sugar islands the canes\r\nare planted from August to November, and are ripe for the mill in the\r\nbeginning of the second year. Thus this plant in Brazil requires from\r\nthirteen to fifteen months to attain its proper state for the mill;\r\nand in the West India islands it remains standing sixteen or seventeen\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nThe Otaheitan, or the Bourbon cane, has been brought from Cayenne to\r\nPernambuco since the Portuguese obtained possession of that\r\nsettlement. I believe the two species of cane are much alike, and I\r\nhave not been able to discover which of them it is. Its advantages are\r\nso apparent, that after one trial on each estate, it has superseded\r\nthe small cane which was in general use. The Cayenne cane, as it is\r\ncalled in Pernambuco, is of a much larger size than the common cane;\r\nit branches so very greatly, that the labor in planting a piece of\r\ncane is much decreased, and the returns from it are at the same time\r\nmuch more considerable. It is not planted in trenches, but holes are\r\ndug at equal distances from each other, in which these cuttings are\r\nlaid. This cane bears the dry weather better than the small cane; and\r\nwhen the leaves of the latter begin to turn brown, those of the former\r\nstill preserve their natural color. A planter in the _Varzea_ told me\r\nthat he had obtained four crops from one piece of land in three years,\r\nand that the soil in question had been considered by him as nearly\r\nworn out, before he planted the Cayenne cane upon it.--(\"Koster's\r\nTravels in Brazil,\" vol. 2.)\r\n\r\nMr. E. Morewood, of Compensation, Natal, who has paid much attention\r\nto sugar culture in that colony, has favored me with the following\r\ndetails, which will be useful for the guidance of others, as being the\r\nresults of his own experience:--\r\n\r\n                                                                    lbs.\r\n  Produce of one acre of sugar cane                               72,240\r\n  Juice expressed, (or 64 per cent.)                              46,308\r\n  Dry sugar                                                        7,356\r\n  Green syrup or molasses                                          2,829\r\n  This syrup carrying with it a good deal of sugar out of the\r\n  coolers, contains fully 75 per cent. of crystalizable sugar, or  2,121\r\n  Thus the total amount of sugar per acre is                       9,477\r\n\r\n    The average density of the cane juice was 12 degrees Beaume, or 21\r\n    per cent. All the improved cane mills are now constructed to give at\r\n    least 75 per cent. of juice. With such a mill, an acre would yield\r\n    11,075 lbs. of sugar. With proper cultivation I have no doubt the\r\n    produce could be largely increased; for, as the numerous visitors\r\n    who have seen this place can testify, my cane fields were not\r\n    attended to.\r\n\r\n    To enable me to show the cost of producing a crop of canes, you must\r\n    allow me to go into the expense of cultivating the land first.\r\n\r\n    To keep one ploughman going, a person requires--\r\n\r\n  20 Oxen at £3                    £60  0  0\r\n  1 Plough                           7 10  0\r\n  1 set Harrows                      7 10  0\r\n  Yokes, Trektows, Reins, &c.        5  0  0\r\n                                  ----------\r\n                                   £80  0  0\r\n\r\n    Then the expenses per month will be:--\r\n\r\n  Ploughman's wages                £2  10  0\r\n  Board                             1  10  0\r\n  1 Driver, 10s., Leaders, 5s.      0  15  0\r\n  Food for two natives              0  10  0\r\n  Wear and tear of oxen and gear,\r\n  at 25 per cent. per annum         1  10  4\r\n                                   ---------\r\n                                   £6  18  4\r\n\r\n    These two spans of oxen will comfortably plough and harrow twenty\r\n    acres per month, and the cost will thus be about 7s. per acre.\r\n\r\n    Now, let us suppose that a person wishes to put in twenty acres of\r\n    canes, the expense would be about as follows:--\r\n\r\n  4 Ploughings and harrowings, 80 acres at 7s.          £28  0  0\r\n  Drawing canefurrows, 4 acres per day, 5 days at 6s.     1 10  0\r\n  2,000 Cane tops per acre, at 50s.                     100  0  0\r\n  4 Horsehoeings, at 2s. 6d.                             10  0  0\r\n  4 Handweedings in the rows, at 2s. 6d.                 10  0  0\r\n  Cutting and carrying out canes, at 30s.                30  0  0\r\n  Carriage to Mill, thirty tons per acre, at 2s.         60  0  0\r\n                                                       ----------\r\n                                                       £239 10  0\r\n\r\n    or £12 per acre. To this must be added the rent of land, say 10s.\r\n    per acre, with right of grazing cattle, for two years, when the\r\n    first crop will come in, would bring the expense to £13 per acre.\r\n    The cane yielding say only three tons of sugar per acre, of which\r\n    the planter would, most likely, have to give the manufacturer\r\n    one-third, he will receive forty tons of sugar, costing him £6 10s.\r\n    per ton, and worth on the spot, according to advices received from\r\n    England and the Cape, £15 per ton, at the lowest estimate, or £600.\r\n\r\n    The greatest expense, you will perceive, is the article of tops for\r\n    planting; but this ought not to discourage persons. The plants which\r\n    I imported from the Mauritius some years ago, cost me, on account of\r\n    many of them not vegetating, at the rate of £30 per acre. Parties\r\n    who begin planting now have the great advantage that they can get\r\n    plants, every one of which, if properly treated, will grow, at\r\n    one-sixth of that price.\r\n\r\n    How many crops cane will give on good soil in Natal, I am of course\r\n    unable to state, as the oldest cane I have got has been cut only\r\n    three times--the last yield (second ratoons) was much finer than the\r\n    preceding ones, and by adopting the improved manner of cane\r\n    cultivation, viz., returning all but the cane juice to the soil, I\r\n    am confident that replanting will be found quite unnecessary; the\r\n    expenses for the second and following years will therefore be very\r\n    trifling.\r\n\r\nComparative Statement of the ruling Prices at Natal and the Mauritius\r\nof Land, Live Stock, Implements, Labor, and other requirements\r\nconnected with the cultivation of the Sugar Cane.\r\n\r\n                MAURITIUS                             NATAL\r\n                             £   s. d. |                        £  s. d.\r\n                                       |\r\n  LAND, per acre, £3 10s. to 20  0  0  | LAND, per acre, 10s.\r\n                                       | to                     1  0  0\r\n  RENT OF LAND.

the\r\ncontinent, especially in France, Belgium, Germany, Austria, and\r\nRussia, and its recent introduction and cultivation as an article of\r\ncommerce in Ireland, renders the detail of its culture and manufacture\r\non the continent interesting. I have, therefore, been induced to\r\nbestow some pains on an investigation of the rise and progress of its\r\nproduction and consumption in those countries.\r\n\r\nDuring the past three years, the smallest estimate which can be formed\r\nof the quantity of cane sugar that has been replaced by beet root\r\nsugar in the chief European countries, is about 80,000 tons annually,\r\nwith the certainty that, year after year, the consumption will become\r\nexclusively confined to the former, to the greater exclusion of the\r\nlatter; unless some great change shall take place in the relative\r\nperfection and manufacture of the two different descriptions of\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\nAlthough, observes the _Economist_, the beet root sugar produced in\r\nFrance, Belgium, Germany, and other parts of the continent is not\r\nbrought into competition in our own markets with the produce of the\r\nBritish colonies, yet it must be plain that the exclusion of so much\r\nforeign cane sugar from the continent, which was formerly consumed\r\nthere, must throw a much larger quantity of Cuba and Brazilian sugar\r\nupon this market; and by this means the increased production of beet\r\nroot sugar, even in those countries where it is highly protected, does\r\nindirectly increase the competition among the producers of cane sugar\r\nin our market.\r\n\r\nSo early as 1747, a chemist of Berlin, named Margraf, discovered that\r\nbeet root contained a certain quantity of sugar, but it was not until\r\n1796 that the discovery was properly brought under the attention of\r\nthe scientific in Europe by Achard, who was also a chemist and\r\nresident of Berlin, and who published a circumstantial account of the\r\nprogress by which he extracted from 3 to 4 per cent. of sugar from\r\nbeet root.\r\n\r\nSeveral attempts have been made, from time to time, to manufacture\r\nbeet root sugar in England, but never, hitherto, on a large and\r\nsystematic scale. Some years ago a company was established for the\r\npurpose, but they did not proceed in their operations.\r\n\r\nA refinery of sugar from the beet root was erected at Thames Bank,\r\nChelsea, in the early part of 1837. During the summer of 1839 a great\r\nmany acres of land were put into cultivation with the root, at\r\nWandsworth and other places in the vicinity of the metropolis. The\r\nmachinery used in the manufacture was principally on the plan of the\r\nvacuum pans, and a fine refined sugar was produced from the juice by\r\nthe first process of evaporation, after it had undergone\r\ndiscolorization. Another part of the premises was appropriated to the\r\nmanufacture of coarse brown paper from the refuse, for which it is\r\nextensively used in France.\r\n\r\nA refinery was also established about this period at Belfast, in the\r\nvicinity of which town upwards of 200 acres of land were put into\r\ncultivation with beet root for the manufacture of sugar.\r\n\r\nThe experience of France ought to be a sufficient guarantee that the\r\nmanufacture of beet root sugar is not a speculative but a great staple\r\ntrade, in which the supply can be regulated by the demand, with a\r\nprecision scarcely attainable in any other ease, and when, in\r\naddition, this demand tends rather to increase than to diminish. That\r\nthe trade is profitable there can also be no doubt from the large\r\ncapital embarked in it on the Continent--a capital which is steadily\r\nincreasing even in France, where protection has been gradually\r\nwithdrawn, and where, since 1848, it has competed upon equal terms\r\nwith colonial sugars.\r\n\r\nThe produce of France in 1851 was nearly 60,000 tons. The beet root\r\nsugar made in the Zollverein in 1851 was about 45,000 tons. Probably\r\nhalf as much more as is made in France and the Zollverein, is made in\r\nall the other parts of the Continent. In Belgium, the quantity made is\r\nsaid to be 7,000 tons; in Russia, 35,000; making a total of beet root\r\nsugar now manufactured in Europe of at least 150,000 and probably\r\nmore, or nearly one-sixth part of the present consumption of Europe,\r\nAmerica, and our various colonies. In 1847 this was estimated at\r\nupwards of 1,000,000 tons; and, as the production has increased\r\nconsiderably since that period, it is now not less than 1,100,000\r\ntons. The soil of the Continent, it is said, will give 16 tons to the\r\nacre, and that of Ireland, 26 tons to the acre. The former yields from\r\n6 to 7 per cent.--the latter from 7 to 8 per cent. as the extreme\r\nmaximum strength of saccharine matter. The cost of the root in\r\nIreland--for it is with that, and not with the cost of the Continental\r\nroot, with which the West Indies will have to contend--is said to be\r\nat the rate of 16s. per ton this; but will probably be 13s. next\r\nseason. The cost of manufacture is set down at £7 5s. per ton.\r\nCalculating the yield of the root to be 7½ lbs. to every 100 lbs., for\r\n26 tons the yield would be nearly 2 tons of sugar, which would give\r\nabout £9 10s. per ton, putting down the raw material to cost 14s, 6d.\r\nper ton, the medium between 16s. and 13s. Thus a ton of Irish-grown\r\nand manufactured beet root sugar, would cost £16 15s. per ton. Mr.\r\nSullivan, the scientific guide to those who are undertaking to make\r\nbeet root sugar at Mountmellick, Queen's County, Ireland, estimates\r\nthe cost of obtaining pure sugar at from £16 17s. to £19 18s. per ton,\r\naccording to the quantity of sugar in the root.\r\n\r\nBeet root is a vegetable of large circumference, at the upper end nine\r\nto eleven inches in diameter. There are several kinds. That which is\r\nconsidered to yield the most sugar is the white or Silesian beet\r\n(_Beta alba_). It is smaller than the mangel wurzel, and more compact,\r\nand appears in its texture to be more like the Swedish turnip. For the\r\nmanufacture of sugar, the smaller beets, of which the roots weigh only\r\none or two pounds, were preferred by Chaptal, who, besides being a\r\ncelebrated chemist, was also a practical agriculturist and a\r\nmanufacturer of sugar from beet root. After the white beet follows the\r\nyellow (_beta major_), then the red (_beta romana_), and lastly the\r\ncommon or field beet root (_Beta sylvestris_). Margraf, as we have\r\nseen, was the first chemist who discovered the saccharine principle in\r\nbeet root; and Achard, the first manufacturer who fitted up an\r\nestablishment (in Silesia) for the extraction of sugar from the root.\r\nIt was not before 1809 that this manufacture was introduced into\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture sprung up there in consequence of Bonaparte's scheme\r\nfor destroying the colonial prosperity of Great Britain by excluding\r\nBritish colonial produce. It having been found that from the juice of\r\nthe beet root a crystallizable sugar could be obtained, he encouraged\r\nthe establishment of the manufacture by every advantage which monopoly\r\nand premiums could give it. Colonial sugar was at the enormous price\r\nof four and five francs a pound, and the use of it was become so\r\nhabitual, that no Frenchman could do without it. Several large\r\nmanufactories of beet root were established, some of which only served\r\nas pretexts for selling smuggled colonial sugar as the produce of\r\ntheir own works. Count Chaptal, however, established one on his own\r\nfarm, raising the beet root, as well as extracting the sugar. The\r\nroots are first cleaned by washing or scraping, and then placed in a\r\nmachine to be rasped and reduced to a pulp. This pulp is put into a\r\nstrong canvas bag and placed under a powerful press to squeeze out the\r\njuice. It is then put into coppers and boiled, undergoing certain\r\nother processes. Most of the operations are nearly the same as those\r\nby which the juice of the sugar cane is prepared for use; but much\r\ngreater skill and nicety are required in rendering the juice of the\r\nbeet root crystallizable, on account of its greater rawness and the\r\nsmaller quantity of sugar it contains. But when this sugar is refined,\r\nit is impossible for the most experienced judge to distinguish it from\r\nthe other, either by the taste or appearance; and from this arose the\r\nfacility with which smuggled colonial sugar was sold in France, under\r\nthe name of sugar from beet root. Five tons of clean roots produce\r\nabout 4½ cwt. of coarse sugar, which give about 160 lbs. of double\r\nrefined sugar, and 60 lbs. of inferior lump sugar. The rest is\r\nmolasses, from which a good spirit is distilled. The dry residue of\r\nthe roots, after expressing the juice, consists chiefly of fibre and\r\nmucilage, and amounts to about one-fourth of the weight of the clean\r\nroots used. It contains all the nutritive part of the root, with the\r\nexception of 4½ per cent. of sugar, which has been extracted from the\r\njuice, the rest being water.\r\n\r\nAs the expense of this manufacture greatly exceeded the value of the\r\nsugar produced, according to the price of colonial sugar, it was only\r\nby the artificial encouragement of a monopoly and premiums that it\r\ncould be carried on to advantage. The process is one of mere curiosity\r\nas long as sugar from the sugar cane can be obtained cheaper, and the\r\nimport duties laid upon it are not so excessive as to amount to a\r\nprohibition; and in this case it is almost impossible to prevent its\r\nclandestine introduction.\r\n\r\nAnother mode of making sugar from beet root, practised in some parts\r\nof Germany, is as follows, and is said to make better sugar than the\r\nother process:--The roots having been washed, are sliced lengthways,\r\nstrung on packthread, and hung up to dry. The object of this is to let\r\nthe watery juice evaporate, and the sweet juice, being concentrated,\r\nis taken up by macerating the dry slices in water. It is managed so\r\nthat all the juice shall be extracted by a very small quantity of\r\nwater, which saves much of the trouble of evaporation. Professor\r\nLampadius obtained from 110 lbs. of roots 4 lbs. of well-grained white\r\npowder-sugar, and the residuum afforded 7 pints of spirit. Achard says\r\nthat about a ton of roots produced 100 lbs. of raw sugar, which gave\r\n55 lbs. of refined sugar, and 15 lbs. of treacle. This result is not\r\nvery different from that of Chaptal. 6,000 tons of beet root it is\r\nsaid will produce 400 tons of sugar and 100 tons of molasses.\r\n\r\nBeet root sugar in the raw state contains an essential oil, the taste\r\nand smell of which are disagreeable. Thus the treacle of beet root\r\ncannot be used in a direct way, whereas the treacle of cane sugar is\r\nof an agreeable flavor, for the essential oil which it contains is\r\naromatic, and has some resemblance in taste to vanilla. But beet root\r\nsugar, when it is completely refined, differs in no sensible degree\r\nfrom refined cane sugar. In appearance it is quite equal to cane\r\nsugar, and the process of refining it is more easy than for the\r\nlatter. Samples made in Belgium were exhibited at a late meeting of\r\nthe Dublin Society. It was of the finest appearance, of strong\r\nsweetening quality, and in color resembling the species of sugar known\r\nas crushed lump. The most singular part of the matter is, that it was\r\nmanufactured in the space of forty-five minutes--the entire time\r\noccupied from the taking of the root out of the ground and putting it\r\ninto the machine, to the production of the perfect article. It was\r\nsaid that it could be produced for 3d. per lb. An acre of ground is\r\ncalculated to yield 50 tons of Silesian beet, which, in France and\r\nBelgium, give three tons of sugar, worth about £50; the refuse being\r\napplied in those countries to feeding cattle. But from the superior\r\nfitness of the Irish soil, as shown by experience to be the case, it\r\nis confidently affirmed by persons competent to form an opinion, that\r\n8 per cent. of sugar could be obtained there on the raw bulk.\r\n\r\nThe following figures are given as illustrative of the expense of the\r\ncultivation of one acre of beet-root in Ireland:--\r\n\r\n  Two ploughings and harrowing       £1  1  0\r\n  Expense of manure and carting       5  0  0\r\n  Hoeing and seed                     0  6  0\r\n  Drilling and sowing                 0  5  0\r\n  Rent                                2  0  0\r\n                                      -------\r\n                                     £8 12  0\r\n\r\nAn average produce of 20 tons, at £15 per ton, would leave a profit of\r\n£6 8s. per acre, leaving the land in a state fit for the reception, at\r\nlittle expense, of a crop of wheat, barley, or oats for the next year,\r\nand of hay for the year ensuing; a consideration of no small\r\nimportance to the farmer. The following estimates, recently given, are\r\nnot by any means exaggerated:--\r\n\r\n  61,607 tons of beet, at 10s.                     £30,803 10  0\r\n  Cost of manufacture, at 11s. per ton.             33,883 17  0\r\n                                                   -------------\r\n                                                    64,687  7  0\r\n  Produce 7 per cent of sugar, at 28s. per cwt.    136,767 10  0\r\n                                                   -------------\r\n  Estimated profit                                 £72,080  3  0\r\n\r\nThe quantity of sugar made from beet-root in France in 1828, was about\r\n2,650 tons; in 1830, its weight was estimated at 6 million\r\nkilogrammes[24] (5,820 tons); in 1834, at 26 million kilogrammes\r\n(24,000 tons); in 1835, 36,000 tons; in 1836, 49,000 tons. At the\r\ncommencement of the year 1837, the number of refineries at work or\r\nbeing built was 543; on an average 20 kilogrammes of beet-root are\r\nrequired for the production of one kilogramme of sugar. The sugar\r\nmanufactured from the beet-root in France a few years ago was stated\r\nto amount to 55,000 tons, or one half of the entire consumption of the\r\nkingdom. The _Courrier Francais_ calculated that the beet-root sugar\r\nmade in France in 1838 amounted to 110 million lbs., and the journal\r\nadded, there is no doubt that, in a few years, the produce will be\r\nequal to the entire demand. The cultivation then extended over 150,000\r\nacres, and in the environs of Lille and Valenciennes it has sometimes\r\nbeen as high as 28,000 lbs. per acre.\r\n\r\nFrom returns of the produce and consumption of beet-root sugar\r\npublished in the _Moniteur_, it appears that on the 1st Dec. 1851,\r\nthere were 335 manufactories in operation, or 81 more than in the\r\ncorresponding period of 1850. The quantity of sugar made, including\r\nthe portion lying over from the previous year, amounted to 19,625,386\r\nkilogrammes, and that stored in the public bonding warehouse to\r\n10,556,847. At the end of June, 1852, 329 manufactories were at work,\r\nor two more than at the same period in 1851. The quantity sold was\r\n62,211,663 kilogrammes, or 9,167,018 less, as compared with the\r\ncorresponding period of the previous year. There remained in stock in\r\nthe manufactories 91,434,070 kilogrammes, and in the entrepot\r\n4,597,829 kilogrammes, being an increase of 2,568,662 kilogrammes in\r\nthe manufactories, and a decrease of 1,292,962 in the entrepots. The\r\nmanufacture of beet-root sugar is every year assuming in France\r\nincreased importance, and attracts more and more the attention of\r\npolitical economists as a source of national wealth, and of\r\ngovernment, as affording matter of taxation. Thirty new factories, got\r\nup upon a very extensive scale, are enumerated as going into operation\r\nthis year. They are located, with but two exceptions, in the north of\r\nFrance; fifteen of them are in the single department of Nord. Indeed,\r\nthe manufacture of beet-root sugar is confined, almost exclusively, to\r\nthe five northern adjacent departments of Nord, Pas de Calais, Somme,\r\nAisne, and Oise. The best quality retails at 16 cents the pound.\r\n\r\nI take from a table in the _Moniteur_ the following statement of the\r\nnumber of factories and their location, with the amount of production\r\nup to the 31st May, 1851.

Fould, Minister of Finance, upon the\r\nintroduction of a bill making an appropriation for the purchase of 455\r\n_saccharometers_, which had become necessary by reason of the late law\r\nordering that from and after the 1st of January, 1852, the beet sugars\r\nwere to be taxed according to their saccharine richness. The Minister\r\ndeclared that at that date there would be in active operation in\r\nFrance 334 sugar factories and 84 refining establishments.\r\n\r\nThe _Moniteur Parisien_ has the following:--\r\n\r\n    \"Notwithstanding the advantages accorded to colonial sugar, and the\r\n    duties which weigh on beet-root sugar, the latter article has\r\n    acquired such a regular extension that it has reached the quantity\r\n    of 60,000 tons--that is to say, the half of our consumption. France\r\n    (deducting the refined sugar exported under favour of the drawback)\r\n    consumes 120,000 tons, of which 60,000 are home made, 50,000\r\n    colonial, and 10,000 foreign. The two sugars have been placed on the\r\n    same conditions as to duties, but it is only from the 1st inst.\r\n    (Jan. 1852), that the beet-root sugar will pay a heavier duty than\r\n    our colonial sugar. In spite of this difference we are convinced\r\n    that the manufacture of beet-root sugar, which is every day,\r\n    improved by new processes, will be always very advantageous, and\r\n    will attain in some years the total quantity of the consumption. In\r\n    Belgium the produce of the beet-root follows the same progress. The\r\n    consumption of sugar there was, in 1850, 14,000 tons, of which 7,000\r\n    was beet-root, made in 22 manufactories. This year there are 18 new\r\n    ones, and although their organisation does not allow of their\r\n    manufacturing in the same proportion as the 22 old ones, they will\r\n    furnish at least 3,000 tons. The quantity of foreign sugar in that\r\n    market does not reckon more than 4,000 tons. This conclusion is the\r\n    more certain, as in 1848-1849, the beet-root only stood at 4,500\r\n    tons in the general account. It may therefore be seen from these\r\n    figures what progress has been made. The same progressive movement\r\n    is going on in Germany. In 1848 it produced 26,000 tons, and in\r\n    1861, 43,000. The following table shows the importance of this\r\n    improvement. It comprises the Zollverein, Hanover, and the Hanse  Towns:--\r\n\r\n          Cane Sugar.    Beet-root.   Totals.\r\n            Tons.          Tons.

The consumption of Russia is estimated at\r\n    85,000 tons, of which 35,000 is beet-root, and what proves that the\r\n    latter every day gains ground is, that the orders to the Havana are\r\n    constantly decreasing, and prices are getting lower. In 1848 Austria\r\n    consumed 40,000 tons, of which 8,000 were beet-root. Last year\r\n    (1851,) she produced 15,000 tons. The production of the continent\r\n    rising to 200,000 tons, and the consumption remaining nearly\r\n    stationary, it is evident that Brazilian and Cuban sugars will\r\n    encumber the English market, independently of the refined sugar of\r\n    Java, which Holland sends to Great Britain. When the continental\r\n    system was established by the decrees of Milan and Berlin, the\r\n    Emperor Napoleon asked the savans to point out the means of\r\n    replacing the productions which he proscribed: it is to the active\r\n    and useful impulse which his genius impressed on all minds, that\r\n    France and Europe owe this fresh manufacture--a creation the more\r\n    valuable as its fortunate development required the co-operation of\r\n    chemical science and agricultural improvement.\"\r\n\r\nThe quantity of sugar extracted from beet-root in the commencement of\r\nthe process, amounted to only 2 per cent.; but it was afterwards made\r\nto yield 5 per cent., and it was then supposed possible to extract 6\r\nper cent. On this calculation the fiscal regulations for the\r\nprotection of colonial sugars in France were founded; but recent\r\nexperiments have been made, by means of which as much as ten and a\r\nhalf per cent. of sugar has been obtained. The following notice of the\r\nimproved process is given in a number of the _Constitutionnel_:--\r\n\r\n    \"It appears that a great improvement is likely to be made in the\r\n    manufacture of beet-root sugar. Those who are acquainted with the\r\n    process of this manufacture, are aware that M. de Dombasle has the\r\n    last six years exclusively devoted himself to bring to perfection\r\n    the process of maceration, of which he is the inventor. Adopting\r\n    recent improvements, this process is materially altered, and has now\r\n    arrived at such a point of perfection that it could scarcely be\r\n    exceeded. The Society for the Encouragement of National Industry\r\n    recently appointed committees to examine the effect produced in the\r\n    manufactory of Roville. They witnessed the entire progress of the\r\n    work, every part of which was subjected to minute investigation.\r\n    Similar experiments have been made in the presence of many\r\n    distinguished manufacturers. We have not the least intention to\r\n    prejudge the decision which may be made on this subject by the\r\n    society we have alluded to; but we believe we are able to mention\r\n    the principal results that have regularly attended the works of the\r\n    manufactory this year. The produce in coarse sugar has been more\r\n    than eight per cent. of the first quality, and more than two per\r\n    cent. of the second quality, in all nearly ten and a half per cent.\r\n    of the weight of beet-root used; and the quality of these sugars has\r\n    been considered by all the manufacturers superior to anything of the\r\n    kind that has hitherto been made, and admits of its being converted\r\n    into loaf-sugar of the first quality. The progress of these\r\n    operations is as simple as possible, and the expenses attending the\r\n    manufacture are considerably less than that of the process hitherto\r\n    adopted.\"\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the beet in France appears likely to prove still\r\nmore advantageous, in consequence of the discovery that the molasses\r\ndrawn from the root may be, after serving for the manufacture of\r\nsugar, turned to farther advantage. It appears that potash may be made\r\nfrom it, of a quality equal to foreign potash. A Monsieur Dubranfaut\r\nhas discovered a method of extracting this substance from the residue\r\nof the molasses after distillation, and which residue, having served\r\nfor the production of alcohol, was formerly thrown away. To give some\r\nidea of the importance of the creation of this new source of national\r\nwealth (remarks the _Journal des Debats_), it will be sufficient to\r\nsay that the quantity of potash furnished by M. Dubranfaut's process\r\nis equal to l/6th of the quantity of sugar extracted from the beet.\r\nThus, taking the amount of indigenous sugar manufactured each year at\r\nseventy million kilogrammes (each kil. equal to 2 lbs. 2 oz. avoird.),\r\nthere may besides be extracted from this root, which has served for\r\nthat production, twelve million kilogrammes of saline matter,\r\ncomparable to the best potash of commerce; and this, too, without, the\r\nloss of the alcohol and the other produce, the fabrication of which\r\nmay be continued simultaneously. According to the present prices, the\r\ntwelve millions of kilogrammes represent a value of from fourteen to\r\nfifteen million francs.\r\n\r\nThe States composing the German Union possessed towards the close of\r\n1838, 87 manufactories of beet-root sugar in full operation, viz.,\r\nPrussia, 63; Bavaria, 5; Wurtemburg, 3; Darmstadt, 1; other states,\r\n15; besides 66 which were then constructing.\r\n\r\nThe only returns given for Prussia and Central Germany are 1836 to\r\n1838, and the annual production of sugar was then estimated at eleven\r\nmillion pounds. The quantity now made is, of course, much greater.\r\n\r\nAt the close of 1888, Austria produced nine million pounds; she now\r\nmakes fifteen thousand tons.\r\n\r\nThe growth of beet-root in Hungary, during the years 1837 and 1838,\r\nwas extremely favorable, and the manufacture of sugar from it has\r\nbecome very extensive. It has been greatly encouraged by the Austrian\r\ngovernment. It was estimated that fifty millions of pounds were\r\nmanufactured in Prussia and Germany in 1839. In Bohemia there were, in\r\n1840, fifty-two factories of beet-root sugar, and nine for the making\r\nof syrup out of potato meal. In 1838, the number was as high as\r\neighty-seven.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch papers state that in a single establishment in Voster Vick,\r\nin Guilderland, about five million pounds' weight of the beet-root are\r\nconsumed in the manufacture of sugar.\r\n\r\nThe following is a Comparative Statement of the number of Sugar\r\nManufactories, and the Quantity of Beet-root upon which duty was paid\r\nfor the Manufacture of Sugar in the Zollverein during the years ending\r\nthe 31st of August, 1846 and 1847:--\r\n\r\n  -------------------+-------------+-------------------------------------\r\n                     |             |Quantity of Beet-root upon which duty\r\n                     |             |was paid for the Manufacture of Sugar.\r\n                     |             +---------+---------+-----------------\r\n                     |  Number of  |         |         |  Comparison in\r\n  Name of the State  |Manufactories|         |         | 1846-7 with the\r\n  of the Zollverein  |             | 1845-6  | 1846-7  | preceding year.\r\n                     +------+------+         |         +---------+-------\r\n                     |      |      |         |         | More in |Less in\r\n                     |1845-6|1846-7|         |         | 1846-7  |1846-7\r\n  -------------------+------+------+---------+---------+---------+-------\r\n       Prussia       |      |      |Cwts. ** |  Cwts.  |  Cwts.  | Cwts.\r\n  Eastern Prussia    |   2  |   2  |   12,393|   29,941|   17,548|  --\r\n  Western Prussia    |  --  |  --  |    --   |    --   |    ---  |  --\r\n  Posen              |   7  |   8  |  101,422|  121,914|   20,492|  --\r\n  Pomerania          |   5  |   4  |   89,865|  121,061|   31,196|  --\r\n  Silesia            |  16  |  22  |  590,545|  711,632|  121,087|  --\r\n  Brandenburg        |   3  |   3  |  140,421|  148,066|    7,645|  --\r\n  Prussian Saxony    |  38  |  42  |2,676,084|3,547,891|  871,817|  --\r\n  Duchies of Anhalt  |   4  |   5  |  266,345|  288,082|   21,737|  --\r\n  Westphalia         |  --  |  --  |    --   |    --   |    --   |  --\r\n  Rhenish Provinces  |   2  |  --  |    2,479|    --   |    --   |  2,479\r\n  -------------------+------+------+---------+---------+---------+-------\r\n  Total in Prussia   |  77  |  86  |3,879,554|4,968,587|1,079,043|\r\n  -------------------+------+------+---------+---------+---------+-------\r\n  Luxemburg          |  --  |  --  |    --   |    --   |    --   |  --\r\n  Bavaria, Kingdom of|   8  |   7  |   50,952|   46,142|    --   |  4,810\r\n  Saxony,     \"      |   1  |   2  |   20,887|   34,230|   13,343|  --\r\n  Wurtemburg, \"      |   2  |   2  |   59,521|  141,366|   81,845|  --\r\n  Baden, Grand Duchy |   2  |   2  |  316,968|  328,608|   11,640|  --\r\n  Hesse, Electorate  |   2  |   3  |   25,376|   23,529|    --   |  1,847\r\n  Hesse, Grand Duchy |  --  |  --  |    --   |    --   |    --   |  --\r\n  Thuringia          |   2  |   3  |   36,127|   38,218|    2,091|  --\r\n  Brunswick, Dukedom |   2  |   2  |   65,707|   52,796|    --   | 12,911\r\n  Nassau, Dukedom    |  --  |  --  |    --   |    --   |    --   |  --\r\n  Frankfort, FreeCity|  --  |  --  |    --   |    --   |    --   |  --\r\n                     +------+------+---------+---------+---------+-------\r\n  Total, exclusively }      |      |         |         |         |\r\n    of Prussia       }  19  |  21  |  575,538|  664,889|   89,351|\r\n                     +------+------+---------+---------+---------+-------\r\n  Total in the       |      |      |         |         |         |\r\n    Zollverein       |  96  | 107  |4,455,092|5,633,476|1,168,394|\r\n  -------------------+------+------+---------+---------+---------+-------\r\n  [** Prussian cwts. are equal to 80 English cwts.]\r\n\r\nThis statement proves that the cultivation of the beet-root, and the\r\nsubsequent manufacture into sugar, has greatly increased in the\r\nZollverein. Eleven manufactories had been added to the number in the\r\nprevious year, and an increase of 26 per cent. took place in the\r\nquantity of beet-root which was manufactured into sugar. Each\r\nmanufactory used, upon an average, the following quantity during the\r\nundermentioned years:--\r\n\r\n                                     1841-2   1844-5   1846-7\r\n                                      Cwts.

If we compare the quantity of\r\nbeet-root employed in Saxony with that of the whole Zollverein, we\r\nfind that the former province requires 63 per cent, of the whole\r\nquantity used for the manufacture of sugar.

The works where draught cattle are employed have\r\ndecreased, and are only in use where the manufacture of beet root\r\nsugar is combined with a farm.\r\n\r\nIn Russia, in 1832, there existed only 20 manufacturers of beet root\r\nsugar, but this number subsequently increased to 100, and they\r\nannually produced the twelfth of the total quantity of sugar which\r\nRussia receives from foreign parts. The number of those manufactories\r\nin 1840, was 140, and the importation of sugar, which reached to\r\n1,555,357 lbs. in 1837, amounted to only 1,269,209 lbs. in 1839. The\r\nproduction of indigenous sugar is now set down at 35,000 tons.\r\n\r\nIn France, for many years past, the production of beet-root sugar has\r\nbeen rapidly increasing, in spite of a gradual reduction of the\r\nprotection which it enjoyed against colonial and foreign sugar, until\r\nit has reached a quantity of 60,000 tons, or fully one half of the\r\nentire consumption. Independent of the refined sugar exported under\r\ndrawback, the consumption of France may be now estimated at 120,000\r\ntons, of which 60,000 tons are of beet-root, 60,000 tons of French\r\ncolonial, and 10,000 tons at the outside of foreign sugar. The\r\nbeet-root and the French colonial sugars are now placed on the same\r\nfooting as regards duty, and a law was recently passed, subjecting\r\nbeet-root sugar, from the 1st of January, 1852, to even a higher duty\r\nthan French colonial sugar. Nevertheless, it is admitted that the\r\nmanufacture of beet-root sugar is highly profitable and rapidly\r\nincreasing, so that it is likely in a very short time to exclude\r\nforeign sugar from French consumption altogether.\r\n\r\nIn Belgium, the production of beet-root sugar is also rapidly\r\nincreasing; in 1851 the entire consumption of sugar was estimated at\r\n14,000 tons, of which 7,000 tons were of beet-root, and 7,000 tons of\r\nforeign cane sugar. The number of beet-root factories to supply that\r\nquantity was _twenty-two_, but this number has, already increased in\r\nthe present year to _forty_. Many of these will be but imperfectly at\r\nwork during this season, but it is estimated that of the entire\r\nconsumption of 14,000 tons, at least 10,000 tons will consist of\r\nbeet-root, and only 4,000 tons of foreign cane sugar. And from present\r\nappearances the manufacture of beet-root is likely to increase so much\r\nas to constitute nearly the entire consumption. So lately as 1848 and\r\n1849 the production of beet-root sugar was only 4,500 tons.\r\n\r\nIn Austria, the consumption of sugar in 1841 was 40,000 tons, of which\r\n8,000 tons were of beet-root, and 32,000 tons of foreign cane sugar.\r\nBut the production of beet-root has increased so fast that it is\r\nestimated to produce in the present year 15,000 tons; and as no\r\nincrease has taken place in the entire consumption, the portion of\r\nforeign cane sugar required in the present year will be reduced from\r\n32,000 tons to 25,000 tons.\r\n\r\nThe following information, with regard to the state of the manufacture\r\nof beet-root sugar on the Continent last year, has been furnished by\r\nMr. C.J. Ramsay, of Trinidad.\r\n\r\n    \"My first start was for Paris, where I remained a week, procuring\r\n    the necessary letters of introduction, to enable me to see some of\r\n    the sugar works in the provinces. Whilst there I called upon Messrs.\r\n    Cail and Co., the principal machine makers in France, mentioned the\r\n    subject of my visit, and requested their assistance. Nothing could\r\n    have been more liberal than the way in which they treated me. I was\r\n    at once asked to look over their establishment and requested to call\r\n    the next day, when letters of introduction to their branch\r\n    establishments at Valenciennes and Brussels would be ready for me.\r\n    This I of course did, and received not only these letters but some\r\n    others, to sugar manufacturers in the neighbourhood of Valenciennes.\r\n    Thus provided, and with letters from Mr. D'Eickthal, a banker in\r\n    Paris, to Mr. Dubranfaut, the chemist, to Mr. Grar, a refiner of\r\n    Valenciennes, to Mr. Melsens of Brussels, and to another sugar maker\r\n    near Valenciennes, whose name I forget, and who was the only man\r\n    from whom I did not receive the greatest politeness, I started for\r\n    Valenciennes. My first essay was upon the latter personage, who\r\n    evidently with a considerable grudge showed me a simple room in his\r\n    works where four centrifugal machines were at work--raised the cry\r\n    of ruin, if the French improvements were introduced in the West\r\n    Indies, and informed me he had nothing else worth seeing. I returned\r\n    to Valenciennes, thinking if this is the way I was to be treated, I\r\n    might as well have stayed at home. That this was a solitary instance\r\n    of illiberality, you will presently see. I next called upon Mr.\r\n    Grar, by whom I was received in a very different manner; he at once\r\n    offered to show me over his works, and especially that part of them\r\n    where a new process, discovered by Mr. Dubranfaut, was carried on,\r\n    every part of which was fully explained, Mr. Dubranfaut's laboratory\r\n    is connected with these works, and having inspected the working part\r\n    of the establishment Mr. G. then took me there, and introduced me to\r\n    that gentleman, with whom I passed the remainder of the afternoon,\r\n    receiving a full explanation of his new process, which is this:--a\r\n    solution of hydrate of barytes is made in boiling water--the\r\n    saccharine solution to be treated is heated to the same degree, and\r\n    the two mixed together in the proportions of 46 parts of hydrate of\r\n    barytes to every 100 parts of sugar contained in the solution, which\r\n    has previously been ascertained by polariscopic examination. A\r\n    saccharate of barytes is immediately formed in the shape of a\r\n    copious precipitate; this, after being thoroughly washed and thus\r\n    freed from all soluble impurities, is transferred into large, deep\r\n    vats, and a stream of carbonic acid gas forced into it, which\r\n    decomposes the saccharate of barytes, forming carbonate of barytes,\r\n    and liberating the sugar in the shape of a perfectly pure solution\r\n    of sugar in water, of the density of 20 to 23 degrees Baumé; the\r\n    carbonate of barytes being thoroughly washed is again converted into\r\n    caustic barytes by burning, so that there is little loss in the\r\n    operation. The whole process is certainly very beautiful, and its\r\n    economic working has been tried for a year, on a sufficiently large\r\n    scale to leave no doubt as to the economy of the process in refining\r\n    molasses, which is the only purpose it has yet been applied to.\r\n\r\n    The Messrs. Grar were so thoroughly satisfied with it, that when I\r\n    was there they had taken down their original apparatus, and were\r\n    re-erecting it on such a scale as to work up all the molasses by it,\r\n    equal to almost five tons of sugar daily. Owing to this\r\n    circumstance, I had not an opportunity of seeing the process on a\r\n    working scale, but was shown the whole proceedings in the\r\n    laboratory.\r\n\r\n    The only difficulties I see in applying this process at once to the\r\n    cane juice, are the large quantity of barytes required, the expense\r\n    of re-burning it and the entire change in works that would be\r\n    necessary before it could be introduced. The advantage would be, the\r\n    obtaining the whole sugar contained in the juice, free from all\r\n    impurities, consequently white, and in the shape of a syrup marking\r\n    20 to 23 degrees instead of 8 or 10 degrees, thus saving fully half\r\n    the evaporation now required. The sugar made in this way, I was\r\n    told, contains no trace of barytes.\r\n\r\n    To show you the degree of economy practised in such establishments\r\n    in France, I may mention that the washings of the saccharate of\r\n    barytes are sold to the makers of potash and soda, who make a profit\r\n    by boiling them down to obtain what salts they contain.\r\n\r\n    The carbonic acid is obtained by the combustion of charcoal in a\r\n    closed iron furnace into which air is forced by an air pump,\r\n    requiring, I believe, about one horse power. From the top of the\r\n    furnace a pipe leads into a washing vessel, from which the gas is\r\n    led into the bottom of the vats by pipes.\r\n\r\n    At Valenciennes I met with Mr. Cail, who, beside being an engineer\r\n    and machine-maker, is interested in sugar-making, both in France and\r\n    in the West Indies, and most thoroughly understands the subject. He\r\n    invited me to accompany him to Douai, to see a new set of works\r\n    which had been set agoing this month. I was of course too glad to\r\n    accept his invitation, and started with him at six next morning,\r\n    reached Douai at eight, and then proceeded to the works, which are a\r\n    few miles out of town. In this work a new process is also employed;\r\n    it is that of Mr. Rouseau, and is said to answer well. The beet root\r\n    juice, as soon as possible after expression, is thrown up by a\r\n    montjus into copper clarifiers with double bottoms, heated by steam\r\n    at a pressure of five atmospheres. To every hundred litres of juice\r\n    (=22 gals.) two kilogrammes of lime are added (about four and a half\r\n    pounds English weight). The lime is most carefully prepared and\r\n    mixed with large quantities of hot water till it forms a milk\r\n    perfectly free from lumps. The steam is turned off, and the juice\r\n    heated to 90 deg. A complete defecation has taken place, the steam\r\n    is shut off, and the juice left a short time, to allow the heavier\r\n    impurities to subside. It is then run off in the usual manner,\r\n    undergoes a slight filtration through a cotton cloth placed over a\r\n    layer of about four inches thick of animal charcoal, and runs into a\r\n    second set of copper vessels placed on a lower level than the\r\n    clarifiers; these vessels are heated by means of a coil of steam\r\n    piping sufficient to make them boil. A second pipe passes into them,\r\n    making a single turn at the bottom of the vessel; this is pierced on\r\n    the lower side with small holes, through which a stream of carbonic\r\n    acid gas is forced.\r\n\r\n    This decomposes the saccharate of lime, which has been formed in\r\n    consequence of the large excess of lime added to the clarifiers.\r\n\r\n    The lime is precipitated as carbonate. When precipitation has\r\n    ceased, steam is turned on, and the whole made to boil; this expels\r\n    any excess of carbonic acid; the liquor is then run off, undergoes a\r\n    similar partial filtration to that mentioned above, and is then\r\n    passed through the charcoal filters to be decomposed. The sugar made\r\n    by this process, directly from the beet-root juice, is nearly white.\r\n    The molasses is re-boiled as often as six times; each time\r\n    undergoing a clarification and filtration through animal charcoal.\r\n    And the proceeds of the last re-boiling is certainly in appearance\r\n    not worse than a great deal of muscovado I have seen shipped from\r\n    Trinidad.\r\n\r\n    In this work there are about 150 people employed. The work goes on\r\n    night and day, one gang replacing the other. The whole evaporation\r\n    is done by two vacuum pans, each 6½ feet in diameter, 80,000\r\n    kilogrammes of beet-root are used daily, from which about 6,000\r\n    kilogrammes of sugar are obtained, equal to about 6 tons English\r\n    weight.\r\n\r\n    In these and every other works I visited--eight in all--the\r\n    centrifugal machines were in use, and had in most cases been so for\r\n    two years; those lately made have been much simplified in\r\n    construction, and work admirably. Cail & Co., of Paris, are the\r\n    makers; their charge is 3,000 francs for each machine (£120 stg.).\r\n    They require about one and a half horse power each. As they are\r\n    wrought in France, one machine is about equal to work off a ton and\r\n    a half of sugar daily, working all the 24 hours. Mr. Cail recommends\r\n    a separate engine for those machines; so that they can be used at\r\n    any time, independent of the other machinery. The charge put into a\r\n    machine is about 80 kilogrammes, from which about 30 to 35\r\n    kilogrammes of dry sugar is obtained; the calculation is, I believe,\r\n    40 per cent. I weighed some of the baskets of sugar taken out after\r\n    drying, and found them 35 kilogrammes. Sugar intended for the\r\n    machine is never concentrated beyond 41 degrees Baumè; that made\r\n    from the juice direct is allowed 18 to 34 hours to crystallize, and\r\n    is put into the machine in a semi-liquid state; the motion at first\r\n    is comparatively slow; in about three minutes the sugar appears\r\n    nearly dry; about three-fourths of a gallon of brown syrup is then\r\n    poured into the machine whilst in motion, and the speed brought up\r\n    to its highest, about 1200 revolutions a minute; in 3 or 4 minutes\r\n    more the machine is stopped, the sugar scooped out and thrown into\r\n    baskets, the inside of the revolving part, and especially the wire\r\n    cloth, carefully washed with a brush and water, and a fresh charge\r\n    put in. The whole time betwixt each charge is about 15 minutes. From\r\n    the large proportion of molasses you will see very plainly that\r\n    those who do not intend to re-boil, need not think of centrifugal\r\n    machines. The sugar dried in this way is not altogether white, but\r\n    has a slight greyish yellow tinge.\r\n\r\n    Of the other sugar works which I visited, the only one of peculiar\r\n    interest was that of Mr. Dequesne, near Valenciennes. Here the roots\r\n    are first cut into small pieces by an instrument similar to a turnip\r\n    slicer, then dried in a species of kiln, and stored up till\r\n    required. In this way I was told beet-root could be preserved with\r\n    very little deterioration for a full year, and this enables Mr.\r\n    Dequesne to go on making sugar all the year round. When the sugar is\r\n    to be extracted, the dried cuttings are put into a series of closed\r\n    vessels connected by pipes, and by a system of continuous filtration\r\n    of warm water through these vessels the solution of sugar is\r\n    obtained, of a density equal, I believe, to 25 degrees Baumè; it is\r\n    a good deal colored, and requires filtration through animal\r\n    charcoal. Mr. Dequesne informed me that for five years he had been\r\n    unable to make this mode of sugar-making cover its expenses, owing\r\n    to the loss occasioned by fermentation taking place in the\r\n    beet-root; but that he has now entirely overcome that difficulty; by\r\n    what means I was not told.\r\n\r\n    The number of macerating vessels is fourteen, ten of which are\r\n    working at a time, the other four filling and emptying.\r\n\r\n    A greater number of vessels, Mr. Dequesne thinks, would be\r\n    advantageous, as cold instead of hot water could then be employed.\r\n    He thinks a similar plan might be introduced in the West Indies with\r\n    great advantage, and that by employing the proper means to prevent\r\n    fermentation the sun's heat would be quite sufficient to dry the\r\n    cane slices.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Dubranfaut and Mr. Rouseau's processes are patented in England.\r\n    The terms for the use of the former would, I was told, be made so\r\n    moderate, as to offer no obstruction to its being used in the\r\n    colonies. What Mr. Rouseau's terms are I could not learn.\r\n\r\n    There are now 288 works making beet root sugar in France, and over\r\n    30 in Belgium. The same manufacture is rapidly spreading in Germany\r\n    and Russia, and is now being introduced in Italy. Whilst at\r\n    Valenciennes, I learned that two English gentlemen had just preceded\r\n    me in visiting the works in that neighbourhood, mentioning that they\r\n    had in view introducing the beet root sugar manufacture in Ireland.\r\n\r\n    The sugar crop of France was last year over 60,000,000 of\r\n    kilogrammes (60,000 tons). For two years _Belgium has been\r\n    exporting_ to the Mediterranean. One maker told me that he had last\r\n    year exported a considerable part of his crop. It would therefore\r\n    appear, that even beet root sugar can compete in _other than the\r\n    producing country_ with the sugar of the tropics--a most significant\r\n    hint that, unless the cane can be made to yield more and better\r\n    sugar than is now generally got from it, there is some risk of its\r\n    being ultimately beaten by the beet root, the cultivation of which\r\n    is now carried on with so much profit that new works are springing\r\n    up every year, in almost every country of the continent.\r\n\r\n    In going through the French works, I made inquiries as to how far\r\n    the procedé Melsens had been adopted, and was everywhere told it was\r\n    a total failure. I, however, determined to see Mr. Melsens and judge\r\n    for myself how far it might be applicable to the cane, even if a\r\n    failure with regard to the beet root. I, therefore, went on to\r\n    Brussels, enclosed my letters of introduction and card, and received\r\n    in return a note, appointing to meet me next morning. I found him\r\n    one of the best and most obliging of men. He immediately offered to\r\n    go over some experiments on beet root juice with me at his\r\n    laboratory, where I accordingly spent the greater part of two days\r\n    with him, and went over a variety of experiments; and from what I\r\n    saw and assisted in doing, I feel strongly inclined to think that,\r\n    notwithstanding the French commission at Martinique report\r\n    otherwise, some modification of Mr. Melsens' process may be most\r\n    advantageously employed in making cane sugar if not as a defecator,\r\n    at least to prevent fermentation, and, probably, also as a\r\n    decolorising agent.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Melsens showed me letters he had received from Java from a\r\n    person with whom he had no acquaintance, stating that he had used\r\n    the bisulphate of lime with complete success; and whilst I was with\r\n    him he again received letters from the same person, stating that by\r\n    its use he had not only improved the quality of sugar, but had\r\n    raised the return to 9 per cent. of the weight of cane. From the\r\n    letters which I saw, the process appears to have been tried on a\r\n    very large scale, with the advantage of filters and a vacuum pan.\r\n    Where the old mode of leaving half the dirt with the sugar, and\r\n    boiling up to a temperature of 340 degrees or thereby, is continued,\r\n    I fear there is not much chance of either bisulphate or anything\r\n    else making any very great improvement.\r\n\r\n    The use of bisulphate of lime is patented in England and the\r\n    colonies, but I believe I may state the charge for the right of\r\n    using it will be made extremely moderate.\r\n\r\n    The points which appeared to me worthy of remark in visiting the\r\n    beet-root sugar works are, the extreme care that nothing shall be\r\n    lost--the great attention paid to cleanliness in every part of the\r\n    process, besides the particular care given to defecation. No vessel\r\n    is ever used twice without being thoroughly washed. Such a thing as\r\n    the employment of an open fire in any part of the manufacture is\r\n    quite unknown. Everything is done by steam, of a pressure of from 4\r\n    to 5 atmospheres. In the more recently started works, the\r\n    evaporation is entirely carried on in vacuum. In some of the older\r\n    works copper evaporators, heated by coils of steam piping, and\r\n    having covers, with chimneys to carry off the vapor, are still used;\r\n    but of the eight works I visited I only saw them in use in one of\r\n    them, and they are nowhere used excepting to evaporate to the point\r\n    when the second filtration takes place.\r\n\r\n    The coolers I saw were invariably made of iron, and varied in depth\r\n    from 2 to over 6 feet. These very deep vessels are used for the\r\n    crystallization of sugar, made of the fourth, fifth and sixth\r\n    re-boilings of molasses, which requires from three to six months.\r\n\r\n    One thing struck me forcibly in going over the French and Belgian\r\n    works; it was the extreme liberality with which I was allowed to go\r\n    over every part of them; to remain in them as long as I pleased; had\r\n    all my inquiries answered, and every explanation given; in most\r\n    striking contrast to the grudging manner in which I have been\r\n    trotted over some of the refineries in England, as if those who\r\n    showed them were afraid I should gain any information on the subject\r\n    of their trade.\r\n\r\nMr. H. Colman, speaking of the agriculture of the Continent, gives\r\nsome information he obtained on the comparative cost of producing beet\r\nand cane sugar. A hectare (two and a half acres) produces, in the Isle\r\nof Bourbon, about 76,000 kilogrammes (a kilogramme is nearly two and\r\none-fifth pounds) of cane, which will give 2,200 kilogrammes of sugar,\r\nand the cost for labor is 2,500 francs. A hectare of beet root\r\nproduces 40,000 kilogrammes of roots, which yield 2,400 kilogrammes of\r\nsugar, and the expense of the culture is 354 francs. The cost of the\r\ncane sugar in this case is 27 centimes, and of the beet sugar 14\r\ncentimes only, per kilogramme.\r\n\r\nThese are extraordinary statements, and will be looked at by the\r\npolitical economist and the philanthropist with great interest. There\r\nare few of the northern states of Europe, or of the United States,\r\nwhich might not produce their own sugar; and when we take into account\r\nthe value of this product, even in its remains after the sugar is\r\nextracted, for the fattening of cattle and sheep, and of course for\r\nthe enrichment of the land for the succeeding crops, its important\r\nbearing upon agricultural improvement cannot be exaggerated.\r\n\r\nAccording to M. Peligot, the average amount of sugar in beets is 12\r\nper cent.; but, by extraction, they obtain only 6 per cent. The cane\r\ncontains about 18 per cent. of saccharine matter, but they get only\r\nabout 7½. The expense of cultivating a hectare of beets, according to\r\nDombasle, is 354 francs. An hectare of cane, which produces 2,200\r\nkilogrammes of sugar, in the Island of Bourbon, and only 2,000 in\r\nFrench Guiana, demands the labor of twelve negroes, the annual expense\r\nof each of whom is 250 francs, according to M. Labran.--(Commission of\r\nInquiry in 1840.)\r\n\r\nSugar has become not only an article of luxury, but of utility, to\r\nsuch a degree, that a supply of it constitutes an important article\r\nof importation, and is of national consequence. For sugar the world\r\nhas hitherto relied on the cane, with the exception of some parts of\r\nIndia, where the sugar palm yields it much more cheaply. The sugar\r\ncane is, however, a tropical plant, and, of course, its cultivation\r\nmust of necessity be limited to such hot countries. France, during the\r\nwars of Napoleon, shut out from her Indian possessions or deprived of\r\nthem, commenced making sugar from beets, and it proving unexpectedly\r\nsuccessful and profitable, it has as we have just seen, extended not\r\nonly over that empire, but nearly the whole of continental Europe,\r\nwhere it forms an important item in their system of cultivation and\r\nprofit. The manufacture has been attempted in the United States; but\r\nthough the facts of the ease and certainty with which the beets may be\r\ngrown and their great value for stock has been fully ascertained,\r\nstill little progress in the production of sugar from them has been\r\nmade there.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAPLE SUGAR.\r\n\r\nThere are few trees in the American forest of more value than the\r\nmaple (_Acer saccharinum_). As an ornamental tree, it is exceeded by\r\nfew; its ashes abound in alkali, and from it a large proportion of the\r\npotash of commerce is produced; and its sap furnishes a sugar of the\r\nbest quality, and in abundance. It likewise affords molasses and an\r\nexcellent vinegar. In the maple the sugar amounts to five per cent. of\r\nthe whole sap. There is no tree whose shape and whose foliage is more\r\nbeautiful, and whose presence indicates a more generous, fertile, and\r\npermanent soil than the rock maple: in various cabinet-work its timber\r\nvies with black walnut and mahogany for durability and beauty; and as\r\nan article of fuel its wood equals the solid hickory. Its height is\r\nsometimes 100 feet, but it usually grows to a height varying from\r\nforty to eighty feet. It is bushy, therefore an elegant shade tree.\r\nThe maple is indigenous to the forests of America, and wherever there\r\nhas been opportunity for a second growth, this tree attains to a\r\nconsiderable size much sooner than might be imagined. In the course of\r\nten or fifteen years the maple becomes of a size to produce sugar. The\r\ntrees which have come up since the first clearing, produce sap that\r\nyields much more saccharine than the original forest maples.\r\n\r\nThe whole interior of the northern part of the United States have\r\nrelied, and still rely, more on their maple woodlands for sugar than\r\non any other source; and as a branch of domestic manufacture and home\r\nproduction, the business is of no little consequence. The time\r\noccupied too in the manufacture is very limited, and occurs at a\r\nseason when very little other labor can be performed.\r\n\r\nHitherto but comparatively little attention has been bestowed upon\r\nthis important branch of industry in Canada. The inhabitants of that\r\nprovince might doubtless manufacture a sufficient quantity of maple\r\nsugar to supply the demand or consumption in this article for the\r\nwhole population of the country. This variety of sugar may be refined,\r\nand made as valuable for table use as the finest qualities of West\r\nIndia sugar. On the south shore of Lake Huron, and the islands of\r\nthat inland sea, there are forests of sugar\r\n\r\nmaple unsurveyed capable of producing a supply for the whole\r\npopulation. The Indians upon those islands have lately turned their\r\nattention pretty largely to the manufacture of sugar from the maple;\r\nand many tons have been exported from this source. If the Indians\r\ncould obtain a fair value for their sugar, say seven or eight dollars\r\nper 100 lbs., they would extend their operations upon a large scale.\r\nUpon these islands alone, there are upwards of a million of full-grown\r\nmaple trees, capable of yielding each from two and a half to three\r\npounds of excellent sugar per annum; and if proper attention were\r\ngiven to this branch of production in that quarter, I see no reason\r\nwhy a most profitable business could not be carried on. Every farmer\r\nwho has a grove of sugar maple, should endeavour to manufacture at\r\nleast sufficient for the consumption of his own family. In most cases\r\n150 trees of medium growth would yield an amount of sap that would\r\nmake 300 lbs. of sugar, twenty-five gallons of molasses, and a barrel\r\nof vinegar. The labor required to manufacture this amount of sugar,\r\nmolasses, and vinegar, would scarcely be felt by the well-organised\r\ncultivator, as the season for the business is at the close of the\r\nwinter, and opening spring, when no labor can be done upon the land.\r\nIn proportion to the amount of labor and money expended in the\r\nproduction of maple sugar, it is as capable of yielding as large a\r\nreturn of profits as any other branch of farm business. It is\r\ncertainly an object of great national interest to the inhabitants of\r\nour North American Colonies, that they should supply their own market\r\nwith such products as their highly-favored country is capable of\r\nproducing. Sugar is an article which will ever find a ready sale at\r\nhighly-remunerating prices, provided that it be properly manufactured\r\nand brought into market in good condition. It requires a little outlay\r\nat first to purchase buckets, cisterns, and boilers, to stock a sugar\r\nbush; but by carefully using the above necessary apparatus, they will\r\nlast for a very long period. A farmer can supply himself with the\r\nsuitable materials for performing the sugar business without any cost\r\nfurther than his own labor. The spring is the season of the year that\r\neverything should be put in readiness,--even the wood should be\r\nchopped and drawn to the spot, so that when the sap commences to run,\r\nthere may be no impediments in the way to hinder the complete success\r\nof the business.\r\n\r\nLarge tracts of land in the Ottawa district are covered with the true\r\nsugar maple. It is found in great numbers in the eastern townships of\r\nLower Canada, where considerable forests of miles in extent contain\r\nnothing else, and in other places it is mixed with various trees.\r\nThere is scarcely a spot in Lower Canada where it is not to be met\r\nwith. Capt. Marryatt has stated that there were trees enough on the\r\nshores of Lakes Huron and Superior, to supply the whole world with\r\nsugar. In the United States, the manufacture of the sugar was first\r\nattempted about the year 1752, by some farmers of New England, as a\r\nbranch of rural economy. This gradually spread wherever the tree was\r\nknown. Now it forms an article of food throughout a large portion of\r\nthe country. Almost every farmer prepares sugar enough from the trees\r\nin his neighbourhood for the consumption of his family during the\r\nyear, and has often a surplus for sale. It is much cheaper than\r\nmuscovado, being sold at from 2d. to 3½d. per pound, whilst common\r\nmuscovado cannot be bought for less than 4½d. to 5d. per pound.\r\n\r\nThe province of Canada produced nearly ten million pounds in 1852,\r\n6,190,694 being made in Lower Canada, and 3,581,505 in Upper Canada.\r\nThe quantity made in Lower Canada in 1849 was only about 1,537,093\r\nlbs. The maple sugar product of the Canadas in 1848 was officially\r\nstated as follows:--\r\n\r\n                          lbs.\r\n  Upper Canada          4,160,667\r\n  Lower Canada          2,303,158\r\n                        ---------\r\n                        6,463,835\r\n\r\nThis product is therefore of immense importance to the British North\r\nAmerican provinces, all of which, under a judicious system, might be\r\nmade to produce vastly increased quantities of this wholesome and\r\nvaluable commodity.\r\n\r\nThe importation of sugar in Canada may very safely be computed at\r\n£40,000 per annum, and the whole of this amount of money could be\r\nretained in the country if the people would only look well to the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nIn tapping the tree, the gouge is the best implement that can be used,\r\nprovided it is an object to save the timber. It is usual, when using\r\nthe gouge, to take out a chip about an inch and a half in diameter;\r\nbut this system is objectionable where the maple is not abundant, as\r\nit subjects the timber to decay; it is a better course to make an\r\nincision by holding the gouge obliquely upwards an inch or more in the\r\nwood. A spout, or spile, as it is termed, about a foot long, to\r\nconduct off the sap, is inserted about two inches below this incision\r\nwith the same gouge. By this mode of tapping, the wound in the tree is\r\nso small that it will be perfectly healed or grown over in two years.\r\nA boiler, of thick sheet-iron, made to rest on the top of an arch, by\r\nwhich the sides would be free from heat, and only the bottom is\r\nexposed, is doubtless a secure and rapid process of evaporation. The\r\nsides and ends of the boiler may be made of well-seasoned boards,\r\nwhich will answer the same purpose as if made solely of sheet-iron.\r\nWhen the sap is boiled down into syrup or thin molasses, it must be\r\ntaken out of the boiler and strained through a flannel cloth into a\r\ntub, where it should settle about twenty-four hours. The clear syrup\r\nshould be separated from the sediment, which will be found in the\r\nbottom of the tub. The pure syrup must be boiled down into sugar over\r\na slow fire. A short time, however, before the syrup is brought to a\r\nboiling heat, to complete the clarifying process, the whites of five\r\neggs well beaten, about one quart of new milk, and a spoonful of\r\nsaleratus, should be all well mixed with a sufficient amount of syrup,\r\nto make 100 lbs. of sugar. The scum which would rise on the top must\r\nbe skimmed off. Caution is to be observed in not allowing the syrup to\r\nboil until the skimming process is completed. To secure a good\r\narticle, the greatest attention must be bestowed in granulating the\r\nsyrup. The boxes or tubs for draining should be large at the top and\r\nsmall at the bottom. The bottom of the tubs should be bored full of\r\nsmall holes, to let the molasses drain through. After it has nearly\r\ndone draining, the sugar may be dissolved, and the process of\r\nclarifying, granulating, and draining repeated, which will give as\r\npure a quality of sugar as the best refined West India article.\r\n\r\nThe greatest objections that are advanced against maple sugar are,\r\nthat the processes made use of in preparing the sugar for market are\r\nso rude and imperfect that it is too generally acid, and besides\r\ncharged with salts of the oxide of iron, insomuch that it ordinarily\r\nstrikes a black color with tea. These objections may be removed\r\nwithout any comparative difficulty, as it has been proved to\r\ndemonstration, by the application of one ounce of clear lime-water to\r\na gallon of maple sap, that the acidity will be completely\r\nneutralised, and the danger of the syrup adhering to the sides of the\r\nboiler totally removed. The acid so peculiar to the maple sugar, when\r\ncombined with lime in the above proportion, is found to be excessively\r\nsoluble in alcohol; so much so, that yellow sugar can be rendered\r\nwhite in a few minutes by placing it in an inverted cone, open at the\r\ntop, with small holes at the bottom, and by pouring on the base of the\r\ncone a quantity of alcohol. This should filtrate through until the\r\nsugar is white; it should then be dried and re-dissolved in boiling\r\nwater, and again evaporated until it becomes dense enough to\r\ncrystallise. Then pour it into the cones again, and let it harden. By\r\nthis process a very white sample of sugar may be made, and both the\r\nalcohol and acids will be thoroughly dispelled with the vapor.\r\n\r\nThe process of making maple sugar it will be seen is very simple and\r\neasily performed. The trees must be of suitable size, and within a\r\nconvenient distance of the place where the operations of boiling, &c.,\r\nare to be performed. When gathered, the sap should be boiled as early\r\nas possible, as the quality of the sugar is in a great degree\r\ndependent on the newness or freshness of the sap. There is a tendency\r\nto acidity in this fluid which produces a quick effect in preventing\r\nthe making of sugar; and which, when the sap is obliged to be kept for\r\nmany hours in the reservoirs, must be counteracted by throwing into\r\nthem a few quarts of slaked lime. During the time of sugar making,\r\nwarm weather, in which the trees will not discharge their sap,\r\nsometimes occurs, and the buckets become white and slimy, from the\r\nsouring of the little sap they contain. In this case they should be\r\nbrought to the boiler and washed out carefully with hot water, and a\r\nhandful of lime to each.\r\n\r\nIn reducing the sap, the great danger to be apprehended is from\r\nburning the liquid after it is made to the consistence of molasses,\r\nsince, when this is done, it is impossible to convert it into sugar; a\r\ntough, black, sticky mass, of little value, being the result. Indeed,\r\nconstant care and attention is required to produce a first-rate\r\narticle: for though sugar may be made in almost any way where the sap\r\ncan be procured, yet unless the strictest care is observed in the\r\nprocesses, in gathering and boiling the sap, clarifying the syrup, and\r\nin converting the syrup to sugar, a dirty inferior article will be\r\nmade, instead of the beautiful and delicious sweet which the maple,\r\nproperly treated, is sure to yield.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of sugar produced in a year varies considerably from the\r\nsame trees. The cause of this difference is to be found in the depth\r\nof snow, continued cold, or a sudden transition from cold to warm,\r\nthus abridging the period of sugar-making. A sharp frost at night,\r\nwith clear warm days, is the most favorable to the sugar-maker.\r\nPerhaps four pounds of sugar from a tree may be a pretty fair average\r\nof seasons generally, although we have known the growth to exceed six\r\npounds, and sink as low as three. A man will take care of one hundred\r\ntrees easily, during the season of sugar, which usually lasts from\r\nabout the middle of March into April, perhaps employing him twenty\r\ndays in the whole. Dr. Jackson, in his Report of the Maine Geological\r\nSurvey, gives the following instances of the production of sugar in\r\nthat State:--\r\n\r\n                                                     Lbs. of Sugar.\r\n  At the Forks of the Kennebec, twelve persons made    3,605\r\n  On No. 1, 2d range, one man and a boy made           1,000\r\n  In Farmington, Mr. Titcomb made                      1,500\r\n  In Moscow, thirty families made                     10,500\r\n  In Bingham, twenty-five families made                9,000\r\n  In Concord, thirty families made                    11,000\r\n\r\nA cold and dry winter is followed with a greater yield of sugar from\r\nthe maple than a season very moist and variable. Trees growing in wet\r\nplaces will yield more sap, but much less sugar from the same\r\nquantity, than trees on more elevated and drier ground. The red and\r\nwhite maple will yield sap, but it has much less of the saccharine\r\nquality than the rock or sugar maple.\r\n\r\nThe work begins usually about the first of March. The tree will yield\r\nits sap long before vegetation appears from the bud: frequently the\r\nmost copious flow is before the snow disappears from the ground.\r\n\r\nSome persons have a camp in their maple orchards, where large\r\ncauldrons are set in which to boil down the sap to the consistency of\r\na thick syrup: others take the liquid to their houses, and there boil\r\ndown and make the sugar.\r\n\r\nThe process begins by the preparation of spouts and troughs or tubs\r\nfor the trees: the spouts or tubes are made of elder, sumach, or pine,\r\nsharpened to fit an auger hole of about three-fourths of an inch in\r\ndiameter. The hole is bored a little upward, at the distance\r\nhorizontally of five or six inches apart, and about twenty inches from\r\nthe ground on the south or sunny side of the tree. The trough, cut\r\nfrom white maple, pine, ash, or bass wood, is set directly under the\r\nspouts, the points of which are so constructed as completely to fill\r\nthe hole in the tree, and prevent the loss of the sap at the edges,\r\nhaving a small gimlet or pitch hole in the centre, through which the\r\nentire juice discharged from the tree runs, and is all saved in the\r\nvessels below. The distance bored into the tree is only about one-half\r\nan inch to give the best run of sap. The method of boring is far\r\nbetter for the preservation of the tree than boxing, or cutting a hole\r\nwith an axe, from the lower edge of which the juice is directed by a\r\nspout to the trough or tub prepared to receive it. The tub should be\r\nof ash or other wood that will communicate no vicious taste to the\r\nliquid or sugar.\r\n\r\nThe sap is gathered daily from the trees and put in larger tubs for\r\nthe purpose of boiling down. This is done by the process of a steady\r\nhot fire. The surface of the boiling kettle is from time to time\r\ncleansed by a skimmer. The liquid is prevented from boiling over by\r\nthe suspension of a small piece of fat pork at the proper point. Fresh\r\nadditions of sap are made as the volume boils away. When boiled down\r\nto a syrup, the liquor is set away in some earthen or metal vessel\r\ntill it becomes cool and settled. Again the purest part is drawn off\r\nor poured into a kettle until the vessel is two-thirds full. By a\r\nbrisk and continual fire, the syrup is further reduced in volume to a\r\ndegree of consistence best taught by a little experience, when it is\r\neither put into moulds to become hard as it is cooled, or stirred\r\nuntil it shall be grained into sugar. The right point of time to take\r\nit away from the fire may be ascertained by cooling and graining a\r\nsmall quantity. The sediment is strained off and boiled down to make\r\nmolasses.\r\n\r\nThe following is from a Massachusetts paper:--\r\n\r\n    The maple produces the best sugar that we have from any plant.\r\n    Almost every one admires its taste. It usually sells in this market\r\n    (Boston) nearly twice as high as other brown sugar. Had care been\r\n    taken from the first settlement of the country to preserve the sugar\r\n    maple, and proper attention been given to the cultivation of this\r\n    tree, so valuable for fuel, timber, and ornament, besides the\r\n    abundant yield of saccharine juice, we could now produce in New\r\n    England sugar enough for our own consumption, and not be dependent\r\n    on the labour of those who toil and suffer in a tropical sun for\r\n    this luxury or necessary of life. But, for want of this friendly\r\n    admonition,\r\n\r\n    \"Axeman, spare that tree,\"\r\n\r\n    the sturdy blows were dealt around without mercy or discretion; and\r\n    the very generation that committed devastation in the first\r\n    settlements in different sections of our country, generally lived to\r\n    witness a scarcity of fuel; and means were resorted to for the\r\n    purchase of sugar, that were far more expensive than would have been\r\n    its manufacture, under a proper mode of economy in the preservation\r\n    of the maple, and the production of sugar from its sap.\r\n\r\n    Those who have trees of the sugar maple, should prepare in season\r\n    for making sugar. In many localities, wood is no object, and a rude\r\n    method of boiling is followed; but where fuel is very scarce, a\r\n    cheap apparatus should be prepared that will require but little\r\n    fuel. In some sections, broad pans or kettles have been made of\r\n    sheet-iron bottoms, and sides of plank or boards, care being taken\r\n    (continued) to allow the fire to come into contact with the iron\r\n    only. These pans cost but a trifle, and, owing to their large\r\n    surface, the evaporation is rapid.\r\n\r\n    Another cheap construction for boiling with economy is, to make a\r\n    tight box of plank, some four or five feet square--the width of a\r\n    wide plank will answer, and then put into it, almost at the bottom,\r\n    a piece of large copper funnel, say ten or twelve inches at the\r\n    outer part, and then smaller. This funnel, beginning near one end,\r\n    should run back nearly to the opposite side, then turn and come put\r\n    at the opposite end, or at the side near the end, as most\r\n    convenient, being in only two straight parts, that the soot may be\r\n    cleared out. Each end should be made tight, with a flange nailed to\r\n    the box. At the mouth of the large part there should be a door, to\r\n    reduce the draught; here make the fire, and at the other end have a\r\n    funnel to carry off the smoke. In this case, there is only sheet\r\n    copper between the fire and the sap which surrounds the funnel, so\r\n    that the heat is readily taken up by the liquid, and very little\r\n    escapes. This is an economical plan for cooking food for stock,\r\n    steaming timber, &c.\r\n\r\n    For catching the sap, various kinds of vessels are used. The\r\n    cheapest are made of white birch, which last one season, or less.\r\n    Troughs of pine, or linden or bass wood, may be made for a few cents\r\n    each, and they will last for a number of years, if inverted in the\r\n    shade of trees. But these are inconvenient; and, after the first\r\n    year, they become dirty, and clog the sap. Pails with iron hoops are\r\n    the best, and, eventually, the cheapest. By painting and carefully\r\n    preserving them, they will cost, for a course of years, about one\r\n    cent each for a year.\r\n\r\nMr. Alfred Fitch, in the \"Genesee Farmer,\" says:--\r\n\r\n    In clarifying, I use for 50 lbs. of sugar one pint of skimmed milk,\r\n    put into the syrup when cold, and place it over a moderate fire\r\n    until it rises, which should occupy thirty or forty minutes; then\r\n    skim and boil until it will grain; after which I put it into a tub,\r\n    and turn on a little cold water, and in a few days the molasses will\r\n    drain out, and leave the sugar dry, light, and white.\r\n\r\nMr. E.W. Clark, of Oswego, furnishes the following:--\r\n\r\n    _On Fining Maple Sugar_.--The sweet obtained from the maple tree is\r\n    undoubtedly the purest known; but from mismanagement in the\r\n    manufacture it frequently becomes very impure. Its value is\r\n    lessened, while the expense of making it increases. I am sensible\r\n    that the method which I shall recommend is not altogether a new one,\r\n    and that it is more by attending to some apparently minute and\r\n    trivial circumstances, than to any new plan, that my sugar is so\r\n    good. Much has been written upon, and many useful improvements been\r\n    made in, that part of the process which relates to tapping the\r\n    trees, and gathering and evaporating the sap, &c.; but still, if the\r\n    final operation is not understood, there will be a deficiency in the\r\n    quality of the sugar. I shall confine myself to that part of the\r\n    operation which relates to reducing the syrup to sugar, as it is of\r\n    the first importance. My process is this:--When the syrup is reduced\r\n    to the consistence of West India molasses, I set it away till it is\r\n    perfectly cold, and then mix with it the clarifying matter, which is\r\n    milk or eggs. I prefer eggs to milk, because when heated the whole\r\n    of it curdles; whereas milk produces only a small portion of curd.\r\n    The eggs should be thoroughly beaten and effectually mixed with the\r\n    syrup while cold. The syrup should then be heated till just before\r\n    it would boil, when the curd rises, bringing with it every impurity,\r\n    even the coloring matter, or a great portion of that which it had\r\n    received from the smoke, kettles, buckets, or reservoirs. The\r\n    boiling should be checked, and the scum carefully removed, when the\r\n    syrup should be slowly turned into a thick woollen strainer, and\r\n    left to run through at leisure. I would remark, that a great\r\n    proportion of the sugar that is made in our country is not strained\r\n    after cleansing. This is an error. If examined in a wine-glass,\r\n    innumerable minute and almost imperceptible particles of curd will\r\n    be seen floating in it, which, if not removed, render it liable to\r\n    burn, and otherwise injure the taste and color of it.\r\n\r\n    A flannel strainer does this much better than a linen one. It is,\r\n    indeed, _indispensable_. As to the quantity of eggs necessary, one\r\n    pint to a pailful of syrup is amply sufficient, and half as much\r\n    will do very well. I now put my syrup into another kettle, which has\r\n    been made perfectly clean and _bright_, when it is placed over a\r\n    quick but solid fire, and soon rises, but is kept from overflowing\r\n    by being ladled with a long dipper. When it is sufficiently reduced,\r\n    (I ascertain this by dropping it from the point of a knife, while\r\n    hot, into one inch of cold water--if done, it will not immediately\r\n    mix with the water, but lies at the bottom in a round flat drop,) it\r\n    is taken from the fire, and the foaming allowed to subside. A thick\r\n    white scum, which is useable, is removed, and the sugar turned into\r\n    a cask, placed on an inclined platform, and left undisturbed for six\r\n    weeks or longer, when it should be tapped in the bottom and the\r\n    molasses drawn off. It will drain perfectly dry in a few days.\r\n\r\n    The sugar made in this manner is very nearly as white as lump sugar,\r\n    and beautifully grained. We have always sold ours at the highest\r\n    price of Muscovadoes; and even when these sugars have sold at\r\n    eighteen cents, ours found a ready market at twenty. Two hands will\r\n    sugar off 250 lbs. in a day. From the scum taken off in cleansing, I\r\n    usually make, by diluting and recleansing, one-sixth as much as I\r\n    had at first, and of an equal quality.\r\n\r\n    It is not of much consequence as regards the quality of the sugar,\r\n    whether care be taken to keep the sap clean or not. The points in\r\n    which the greatest error is committed, are, neglecting to use a\r\n    flannel strainer, or to strain after cleansing--to have the sugar\r\n    kettle properly cleaned--and to remove the white scum from the\r\n    sugar.\r\n\r\nAn important process of manufacturing maple sugar, which produces a\r\nmost beautiful article, is also thus described in a communication by\r\nthe gentleman who gained the first premium at the State Fair at\r\nRochester in 1843, to the Committee on Maple Sugar of the New York\r\nState Agricultural Society.\r\n\r\n    In the first place, I make my buckets, tubs, and kettles all\r\n    perfectly clean. I boil the sap in a potash kettle, set in an arch\r\n    in such a manner that the edge of the kettle is defended all around\r\n    from the fire. I boil through the day, taking care not to have\r\n    anything in the kettle that will give color to the sap, and to keep\r\n    it well skimmed. At night I leave fire enough under the kettle to\r\n    boil the sap nearly or quite to syrup by the next morning. I then\r\n    take it out of the kettle, and strain it through a flannel cloth\r\n    into a tub, if it is sweet enough; if not, I put it in a cauldron\r\n    kettle, which I have hung on a pole in such a manner that I can\r\n    swing it on or off the fire at pleasure, and boil it till it is\r\n    sweet enough, and then strain it into the tub, and let it stand till\r\n    the next morning. I then take it and the syrup in the kettle, and\r\n    put it altogether into the cauldron, and sugar it off. I use, to\r\n    clarify say 100 lbs. of sugar, the whites of five or six eggs well\r\n    beaten, about one quart of new milk, and a spoonful of saleratus,\r\n    all we'll mixed with the syrup before it is scalding hot. I then\r\n    make a moderate fire directly under the cauldron, until the scum is\r\n    all raised; then skim it off clean, taking care not to let it boil\r\n    so as to rise in the kettle before I have done skimming it. I then\r\n    sugar it off, leaving it so damp that it will drain a little. I let\r\n    it remain in the kettle until it is well granulated. I then put it\r\n    into boxes made smallest at the bottom, that will hold from fifty to\r\n    seventy lbs., having a thin piece of board fitted in, two or three\r\n    inches above the bottom, which is bored full of small holes, to let\r\n    the molasses drain through, which I keep drawn off by a tap through\r\n    the bottom. I put on the top of the sugar, in the box, a clean damp\r\n    cloth; and over that, a board, well fitted in, so as to exclude the\r\n    air from the sugar. After it has done draining, or nearly so, I\r\n    dissolve it, and sugar it off again; going through with the same\r\n    process in clarifying and draining as before.\r\n\r\nThe following remarks from Dr. Jackson, of Boston, may be of interest\r\nto the sections of the country where maple sugar is made:--\r\n\r\n    The northern parts of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York,\r\n    have dense forests of the sugar maple, and at present only very rude\r\n    processes are made use of in preparing the sugar for market, so that\r\n    it is too generally acid and deliquescent, besides being charged\r\n    with salts of the oxide of iron, insomuch that it ordinarily strikes\r\n    a black color with tea. To remedy these difficulties was the object\r\n    of my researches; while, at the same time, I was engaged in\r\n    ascertaining the true composition of the sap, with a view to the\r\n    theory of vegetable nutrition.\r\n\r\n    I received several gallons of freshly-drawn maple sap from\r\n    Northampton, Warner, and Canterbury, and made analyses of each lot,\r\n    separating the acids, salts, and the sugar. I also analysed the sap\r\n    of the yellow and white birch, which do not give any crystallisable\r\n    sugar, but an astringent molasses.\r\n\r\n    I shall now communicate to you the process by which I manufactured\r\n    sugar maple sap, received from the Shakers of Canterbury, who\r\n    collected it with care in a clear glass demijohn, and sent it\r\n    forthwith, so that it came to me without any change of composition,\r\n    the weather being cold at the time. The evaporation was carried on\r\n    in glass vessels until the sap was reduced to about one-eighth its\r\n    original bulk, and then it was treated with a sufficient quantity of\r\n    clear lime-water to render it neutral, and the evaporation was\r\n    completed in a shallow porcelain basin. The result was, that a\r\n    beautiful yellow granular sugar was obtained, from which not a\r\n    single drop of molasses drained, and it did not deliquesce by\r\n    exposure to the air. Another lot of the sap, reduced to sugar\r\n    without lime-water, granulated, but not so well, was sour to the\r\n    taste, deliquesced by exposure, and gave a considerable quantity of\r\n    molasses.\r\n\r\n    Having studied the nature of the peculiar acid of the maple, I found\r\n    that its combinations with lime were excessively soluble in alcohol,\r\n    so that the yellow sugar first described could be rendered white in\r\n    a few minutes, by placing it in an inverted cone open at the bottom,\r\n    and pouring a fresh quantity of alcohol upon it, and allowing it to\r\n    filtrate through the sugar. The whitened sugar was then taken and\r\n    re-dissolved in boiling water and crystallised, by which all the\r\n    alcoholic flavour was entirely removed, and a perfectly fine\r\n    crystallised and pure sugar resulted. Now, in the large way, I\r\n    advise the following method of manufacturing maple sugar. Obtain\r\n    several large copper or brass kettles, and set them up in a row,\r\n    either by tripods with iron rings, or by hanging them on a\r\n    cross-bar; clean them well, then collect the sap in buckets, if\r\n    possible, so that but little rain-water will be mixed with the sap,\r\n    and take care not to have any dead leaves in it. For every gallon of\r\n    the maple sap _add one measured ounce_ of clear lime-water, pass the\r\n    sap into the first kettle and evaporate; then, when it is reduced to\r\n    about one-half, dip it out into the second kettle, and skim it each\r\n    time; then into the next, and so on, until it has reached the last,\r\n    where it is reduced to syrup, and then may be thrown into a trough,\r\n    and granulated by beating it up with an oar.\r\n\r\n    As soon as the first kettle is nearly empty, pour in a new lot of\r\n    the sap, and so continue working it forward exactly after the manner\r\n    of the West India sugar-boilers. The crude sugar may be refined\r\n    subsequently, or at the time of casting it into the cones made of\r\n    sheet iron, well painted with white lead and boiled linseed oil, and\r\n    thoroughly dried, so that no paint can come off. These cones are to\r\n    be stopped at first, until the sugar is cold; then remove the\r\n    stopper and pour on the base of the cone a quantity of strong\r\n    whiskey, or fourth proof rum. Allow this to nitrate through, until\r\n    the sugar is white; dry the loaf, and redissolve it in boiling hot\r\n    water, and evaporate it until it becomes dense enough to\r\n    crystallise. Now pour it into the cones again, and let it harden. If\r\n    any color remains, pour a saturated solution of refined white sugar\r\n    on the base of the cone, and this syrup will remove all traces of\r\n    color from the loaf.\r\n\r\n    One gallon of pasture maple sap yielded 3,451 grains of pure sugar.\r\n    One gallon of the juice of the sugar cane yields, on an average, in\r\n    Jamaica, 7,000 grains of sugar. Hence, it will appear that maple sap\r\n    is very nearly half as sweet as cane juice; and since the maple\r\n    requires no outlay for its cultivation, and the process may be\r\n    carried on when there is little else to be done, the manufacture of\r\n    maple sugar is destined to become an important department of rural\r\n    economy. It is well known, by the Report of the Statistics of the\r\n    United States, that Vermont ranks next to Louisiana as a sugar\r\n    state, producing (if I recollect correctly) 6,000,000 of pounds in\r\n    some seasons, though the business is now carried on in a very rude\r\n    way, without any apparatus, and with no great chemical skill; so\r\n    that only a very impure kind of sugar is made, which, on account of\r\n    its peculiar flavor, has not found its way into common use, for\r\n    sweetening tea and coffee. It would appear worth while, then, to\r\n    improve this manufacture, and to make the maple sugar equal to any\r\n    now in use. This can be readily accomplished, if the farmers in the\r\n    back country will study the process of sugar-making, for cane and\r\n    maple sugar are, when pure, absolutely identical. It should be\r\n    remarked, that forest maples do not produce so much sugar as those\r\n    grown in open fields or in groves, where they have more light, the\r\n    under-brush being cleared away.\r\n\r\n    In Farmington, on the Sandy River, in Maine, I have seen a very fine\r\n    grove of maples, but thirty years old, which produced a large yield\r\n    of very good sugar. A man and two boys made 1,500 lbs. of sugar from\r\n    the sap of these trees in a single season. The sap was boiled down\r\n    in potash kettles, which were scoured bright with vinegar and sand.\r\n    The sugar was of a fine yellow color, and well crystallised. It was\r\n    drained of its molasses in casks, with a false bottom perforated\r\n    with small holes--the cask having a hole bored at the bottom, with a\r\n    tow plug placed loosely in it, to conduct off the molasses. This\r\n    method is a good one, but the sap ought to be limed in boiling, as I\r\n    have described; then it will not attach to the iron or copper\r\n    boilers. The latter metal must not be used with acid syrup, for\r\n    copper salts are poisonous.\r\n\r\nThere are several towns in the northern sections of Maine, New\r\nHampshire, and Vermont, that produce more than sufficient sugar for\r\nthe consumption of their inhabitants. A lot of good sugar trees will\r\naverage four pounds to the tree, in a favorable season. Many farmers\r\nhave orchards that will yield five hundred to a thousand pounds of\r\nsugar in a year. As this is made at a season interfering very little\r\nwith the general business of the farm, the sugar that the farmer makes\r\nis so much clear gain.\r\n\r\nThere is, on almost every hill-farm, some place favorable for the\r\ngrowth of a maple orchard--some rocky spots yielding little grass, and\r\nimpervious for the plough. Such spots may be favorably chosen for the\r\ngrowth of a maple orchard; and whether the increase be used for\r\nmanufacturing sugar or molasses, or for timber or fuel, the proprietor\r\nof the land will find a profit better than money at interest in the\r\ngrowth of this beautiful tree, which will spontaneously propagate\r\nitself in many positions.\r\n\r\nIts great excellence consists in yielding sap for the manufacture of\r\nvast quantities of maple sugar in the country during the months of\r\nspring. An open winter, constantly freezing and thawing, is a\r\nforerunner of a bountiful crop of sugar. The orchard of maple trees is\r\nalmost equal to a field of sugar cane of the same area, in the\r\nproduction of sugar. This tree reaches an age of 200 years.\r\n\r\nVermont is the second sugar-producing State in the Union. The amount\r\nof maple sugar produced there in 1840 was over 2,550 tons, being more\r\nthan 17¾ pounds to each inhabitant, allowing a population of 291,948.\r\nAt five cents a pound, this is worth. 255,963 dols. 20 cents.\r\n\r\nThe Statistics of the United States census for 1850, show that about\r\nthirty-five millions of pounds (15,250 tons) of maple sugar were\r\nmanufactured in that year:--\r\n\r\n  Maine                     97,541\r\n  New Hampshire          1,392,489\r\n  Massachusetts            768,596\r\n  Vermont                5,159,641\r\n  Connecticut               37,781\r\n  New York              10,310,764\r\n  New Jersey                 5,886\r\n  Pennsylvania           2,218,641\r\n  Maryland                  47,740\r\n  Virginia               1,223,908\r\n  North Carolina            27,448\r\n  South Carolina               200\r\n  Georgia                       50\r\n  Alabama                      473\r\n  Mississippi                  110\r\n  Louisiana                    260\r\n  Arkansas                   8,825\r\n  Tennessee                159,647\r\n  Kentucky                 388,525\r\n  Ohio                   4,528,548\r\n  Michigan               2,423,897\r\n  Indiana                2,921,638\r\n  Illinois                 246,078\r\n  Missouri                 171,942\r\n  Iowa                      70,684\r\n  Missouri                 661,969\r\n  Minnesota                  2,950\r\n                        -----------\r\n  Total                  32,776,671\r\n\r\nThere is a balance of about two million pounds produced by Rhode\r\nIsland, Texas, Oregon, California, Utah, New Mexico, Delaware, and\r\nFlorida. The above statement does not include the sugar made by the\r\nIndians, east of the Mississippi river, which may be set down at\r\n10,000,000 lbs., and west of that river 2,000,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nBesides the above sugar crop, there was a yield by the sugar maple in\r\nthe United States in 1850, of 40,000,000 gallons of maple molasses.\r\n\r\n_Maize Sugar_.--The stem and branches of Indian corn, during the time\r\nthat its grain is filling, abounds with sugar, even when grown in this\r\ncountry; so much so, that it might be turned to account by those of\r\nthe peasantry who have small plots of ground attached to their\r\ncottages; and I applied a simple method by which a rich syrup may be\r\nobtained from it, equal in sweetness to treacle, and superior to it in\r\nflavor. The proper time for cutting down the plant (which should be\r\ndone within an inch of the ground), is when the corn in the ear is\r\nsmall and full of a milky juice. All the large and old leaves should\r\nbe stripped off, leaving only the young and tender ones; they should\r\nthen be cut into short lengths, thoroughly bruised, and the juice\r\nentirely pressed out from them. Where the means cannot be obtained for\r\nexpressing the juice by this method, the following may be\r\nemployed:--After the plants have been cut into small pieces, put them\r\ninto a large pot or copper, with only just sufficient water to extract\r\nthe juice; boil for one hour, and then strain off the liquor; to each\r\ngallon of this liquor add a wine-glass full of lime-water whilst warm;\r\nbut if it be the expressed juice, obtained as above mentioned, add\r\ndouble the quantity of lime-water. When the liquor is cold, for every\r\nthree gallons beat up an egg with some of the liquor; put altogether\r\ninto a boiler, and boil gently till the syrup acquires the consistence\r\nof treacle. Whilst this is going on, the liquor should every now and\r\nthen be well stirred, and the scum which rises to the surface taken\r\noff. This syrup, which will be found a better substitute for sugar\r\nthan treacle, and more wholesome, should be kept in lightly-covered\r\nvessels, in a dry place.\r\n\r\nMy own observations, twelve years ago, acquainted me with the fact,\r\nthat when the grain in the ear has acquired one half of the full size,\r\nthe quantity of sugar in the sap has passed its maximum, or begun to\r\ndecrease, and continues to do so until it disappears entirely. Lopping\r\noff the young ears makes shorter work of it. It is like taking the\r\nyoung from an animal giving suck, in which case the milk soon ceases\r\nto flow into the breast, and that which produced it is elaborated into\r\nother fluids necessary to the nourishment of the different parts of\r\nthe body of the parent. In the corn-stalk, when deprived of its ears,\r\nthe elements of sugar are dissipated by increasing the size of the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nSugar may also be obtained from the carrot and the parsnip, as well as\r\nfrom all sweet fruits. It is abundant throughout the vegetable\r\nkingdom; it forms the first food of plants when they germinate in the\r\nseed; when the first little sprout is projected from a grain of corn,\r\na portion of the farina, or starch, is changed into sugar, which may\r\nbe called the blood of the plant, and from it is drawn the nourishment\r\nnecessary to its expansion and appearance above the surface of the\r\nearth. In the latter growth of many plants an inverse process is\r\ncarried on, as in the Indian corn, which I have just spoken of. In\r\nthis instance, as also numberless others, sugar is formed in large\r\nquantities in the body of the plant, and elaborated into farina, or\r\nstarch, in the ear. The elements of which sugar and starch are\r\ncomposed are the same; the only difference is in their proportions.\r\nChemists, being aware of this, have converted starch into sugar; and\r\ncould do it with certainty to any extent, were any advantage to be\r\ngained by it; but hitherto starch has been higher in price than sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.\r\n\r\nTHE GRAIN CROPS, EDIBLE ROOTS, AND FARINACEOUS PLANTS FORMING THE\r\nBREAD STUFFS OF COMMERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vegetable substances, from which man derives his principal\r\nsustenance, such as the nutritious cereal grains, the tuberous rooted\r\nplants and the trees yielding farina, are very widely diffused, and\r\nnecessarily occupy the main attention of the cultivator; their\r\nproducts forming the most important staples of domestic and foreign\r\ncommerce. The cereal grasses and roots, cultivated in temperate\r\nregions, such as wheat, barley, oats, rye, and the potato, are so well\r\nknown, and have been so fully described by agricultural writers that I\r\nshall not go much into details as to their varieties, culture, &c.,\r\nbut confine myself chiefly to their distribution, produce, statistics,\r\nand commercial importance. The food plants may be most conveniently\r\narranged under three heads. Firstly--the Grain crops and legumes,\r\nwhich comprises the European cultivated grasses, wheat, barley, oats,\r\n&c.; and the tropical ones of rice, maize, millet, Guinea corn, &c.\r\nSecondly--Palms and other trees yielding farina, including the sago\r\npalms, plantain and banana, and the bread fruit tree. And Thirdly--the\r\nedible Root crops and Starch producing plants, which are a somewhat\r\nextensive class, the chief of which, however, are the common potato,\r\nyams, cocos or eddoes, sweet potatoes, the bitter and sweet cassava or\r\nmanioc, the arrowroot and other plants yielding starch in more or less\r\npurity.\r\n\r\nThere is a great diversity of food, from the humble oak bark bread of\r\nthe Norwegian peasant, or the Brahmin, whose appetite is satisfied\r\nwith vegetables, to the luxurious diet of a Hungarian Magnate at\r\nVienna.\r\n\r\nThe bread stuffs, as they are popularly termed, particularly wheat and\r\nwheat flour, maize, and rice, form very important articles of\r\ncommerce, and enter largely into cultivation in various countries for\r\nhome consumption and export. Russia, India, and the United States,\r\ncarry on a very considerable trade in grain with other countries. Our\r\nlocal production being insufficient for food and manufactures, we\r\nimport yearly immense quantities of grain and flour. In the four years\r\nending 1852, the annual quantity of corn, of various, kinds, imported\r\ninto the United Kingdom, exclusive of flour and meal, rice, sago, &c.,\r\naveraged 8,085,903 quarters.\r\n\r\nThe flour and meal imported, omitting sago, arrowroot and other\r\nstarches, averaged in the same period 4,143,603 cwts. annually.\r\n\r\nThe annual imports of breadstuffs for food, taking the average of the\r\nfour years ending with 1852, may be thus summed up--\r\n\r\n                                                                 Tons.\r\n  Corn and grain, 8,085,903 quarters, at 60 lb. the bushel      173,270\r\n  Flour and meal                                                207,180\r\n  Rice                                                           40,817\r\n  Potatoes                                                       42,440\r\n  Sago, arrowroot, &c.                                            5,000\r\n                                                                -------\r\n                      Total                                     468,707\r\n\r\nSome portion of this quantity is doubtless consumed in the arts--as\r\nstarch for stiffening linens, &c., and for other purposes not coming\r\nunder the term of food, but I have purposely left out in the\r\ncalculation about 30,000 to 40,000 quarters of rice in the husk\r\nannually imported.\r\n\r\nIreland took, in 1849, of foreign grain 2,115,129 quarters; 1,683,687\r\nquarters in 1850; and 2,504,229 in 1851; as well as 256,837 cwts. of\r\nvarious kinds of meal and flour in 1849; 220,107 cwts. in 1850; and\r\n341,680 cwts. in 1851. England also supplied her with about 500,000\r\nquarters of grain and 350,000 cwts. of meal in each of those years.\r\n\r\nThe comparative returns of the importations of grain into the United\r\nKingdom for the last four years, are as follows, in quarters:--\r\n\r\n                  1852.       1851.       1850.       1849.\r\n  Wheat         3,068,892   3,812,009   3,738,995   3,845,378\r\n  Barley          656,737     829,564   1,035,903   1,381,008\r\n  Oats            995,480   1,198,529   1,154,473   1,267,106\r\n  Rye              10,023      24,609      98,836     240,566\r\n  Beans           371,250     318,502     443,306     457,933\r\n  Peas            107,017      99,399     181,419     234,366\r\n  Maize         1,479,891   1,807,636   1,277,071   2,224,459\r\n  Other sorts       8,085       3,432         868       1,150\r\n                ---------   ---------   ---------   ---------\r\n  Quarters      6,667,375   8,124,280   7,930,871   9,651,966\r\n\r\nThe meal and flour imported in the same years, in cwts., were as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n                  1852.       1851.       1850.       1849.\r\n  Wheat         3,889,583   5,314,414   3,819,440   3,349,839\r\n  Barley              212          34         108         224\r\n  Oats                521       2,525       5,999      40,230\r\n  Rye                  92       6,493         964      18,468\r\n  Indian corn         742       9,561      11,334     101,683\r\n  Other sorts          54         343         163       1,396\r\n                ---------   ---------   ---------   ---------\r\n  Cwts.         3,891,195   5,323,370   3,838,008   3,511,840\r\n\r\nBefore the famine in Ireland the imports seldom reached 20 millions of\r\nbushels of grain and meal of all kinds. In 1848 our imports were\r\nabout 60 millions; in 1849, 85 millions; in 1850, 68 millions; in\r\n1851, 75½ millions; in 1852, 69 millions, with good wheat harvests;\r\nshowing the great shock received and the slowness of recovery.\r\n\r\nWith a rapidly increasing population in all parts of the civilized\r\nworld, the production of bread is obviously the first object to be\r\nsought after, alike by the statesman and the peasant. I scarcely dare\r\ngive the calculation of the immense amount which would be realised in\r\nany great country, by the single saving of a bushel to an acre, in the\r\nquantity of seed ordinarily sown. The same result would follow if an\r\nadditional bushel could be produced in the annual average yield of the\r\nwheat crop.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. H. Colman, the annual amount of seed for wheat sown\r\nin France is estimated at 32,491,978 bushels. If we could suppose a\r\nthird of this saved, the saving would amount to 10,863,959 bushels per\r\nyear. Suppose an annual increase of the crops of five bushels per\r\nacre, this would give an increase of production of 54,319,795 bushels.\r\nAdd this, under improved cultivation, to the amount of seed saved, and\r\nthe result would be 65,183,754 bushels--I believe under an improved\r\nagriculture this is quite practicable.\r\n\r\nAn eminent agricultural writer placed the average yield in England at\r\neighteen bushels per acre; some years since a man of sanguine\r\ntemperament rated it at over thirty bushels. In France it is stated,\r\nin the best districts, to average twenty-two bushels. These evidently\r\nare wholly conjectural estimates. In England Mr. Colman states that\r\nfifty bushels per acre were reported to him on the best authority, as\r\nthe yield upon a large farm in a very favorable season. More than\r\neighty bushels have been returned, upon what is deemed ample\r\ntestimony, to the Royal Agricultural Society of England, as the\r\nproduct of a single acre. In France Mr. Colman had, upon credible\r\nauthority, reports of forty, forty-four and seventy-two bushels. It\r\nwould be of immense importance to any government to know the exact\r\nproduce grown in any county, or district, or in the whole country; and\r\nthis might be obtained by compelling, on the part of the owner or\r\ncultivator, an actual return of his crop; but it is of little use to\r\nfound such returns on estimates purely conjectural.\r\n\r\nFrom the best statistical accounts that can be obtained, the wheat\r\nannually produced in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n  England, Scotland, Ireland is          111,681,320 bushels.\r\n  In France it is                        198,660,000    \"\r\n  United States                          100,503,899    \"\r\n\r\nThe amount of seed ordinarily sown to the acre in France is from two\r\nto three bushels. The return of crop for the seed sown is represented\r\nas in the best districts averaging 6.25 for one; in the least\r\nproductive 5.40 for one. My readers may be curious to know the\r\ncalculations which have been made in some other countries in regard to\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\n                              CENTRAL EUROPE\r\n                                                            Increase\r\n                     Countries.

Some beautiful specimens of wheat were exhibited from South\r\nAustralia, weighing seventy pounds a bushel; which were eagerly sought\r\nafter for seed wheat by our farmers and the colonists of Canada and\r\nthe United States. But as is well observed by Professor Lindley, it\r\nhas no peculiar constitutional characteristics by which it may be\r\ndistinguished from other wheats. Its superior quality is entirely\r\nowing to local conditions; to the peculiar temperature, the brilliant\r\nlight, the soil, and those other circumstances which characterise the\r\nclimate of South Australia.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of wheat contain water in greater or lesser quantities. Its\r\namount is greater in cold countries than in warm. In Alsace from 16 to\r\n20 per cent.; England from 14 to 17 per cent.; United States from 12\r\nto 14 per cent.; Africa and Sicily from 9 to 11 per cent. This\r\naccounts for the fact, that the same weight of southern flour yields\r\nmore bread than northern, English wheat yields 13 lbs. more to the\r\nquarter than Scotch. Alabama flour, it is said, yields 20 per cent.\r\nmore than that of Cincinnati. And in general American flour, according\r\nto one of the most extensive London bakers, absorbs 8 or 10 per cent.\r\nmore of its own weight of water in being made into bread than the\r\nEnglish. The English grain is fuller and rounder than the American,\r\nbeing puffed up with moisture.\r\n\r\nEvery year the total loss in the United States from moisture in wheat\r\nand flour is estimated at four to five million dollars. To remedy this\r\ngreat evil, the grain should be well ripened before harvesting, and\r\nwell dried before being stored in a good dry granary. Afterwards, in\r\ngrinding and in transporting, it should be carefully protected from\r\nwet, and the flour be kept from exposure to the atmosphere. The best\r\nprecaution is kiln-drying. By this process the wheat and flour are\r\npassed over iron plates heated by steam to the boiling point. From\r\neach barrel of flour 16 or 17 pounds of water are thus expelled,\r\nleaving still four or five per cent. in the flour, an amount too small\r\nto do injury. If all the water be expelled, the quality of the flour\r\nis deteriorated.\r\n\r\nThe mode of ascertaining the amount of water in flour is this; take a\r\nsmall sample, say five ounces, and weigh it carefully; put it into a\r\ndry vessel, which should be heated by boiling water; after six or\r\nseven hours, weigh it; its loss of weight shows the original amount of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe next object is to ascertain the amount of gluten. Gluten is an\r\nadhesive, pasty mass, and consists of several different principles,\r\nthough its constitution has not yet been satisfactorily determined. It\r\nis chiefly the nutritious portion of the flour. The remaining\r\nprinciples are mostly starch, sugar and gum. On an average their\r\nrelative amount in 100 parts are about as follows:--\r\n\r\n                     Average.     Kobanga wheat, the best.\r\n  Water                13                 12\r\n  Gluten               12                 16\r\n  Starch               67                 60\r\n  Sugar and Gum         8                  8\r\n                      ---                ---\r\n                      100                 97\r\n\r\nProfessor Beck examined thirty-three different samples from various\r\nparts of the United States and Europe, and he gives the preference to\r\nthe Kobanga variety from the south of Russia. There would probably be\r\na prejudice against it in this country, from the natural yellowish hue\r\nof its flour and bread.\r\n\r\nThe value of the vegetable food, grain, potatoes, rice and apples\r\nexported from the United States within the past few years is thus set\r\ndown:--\r\n\r\n                  Dollars.\r\n  1847           57,970,356\r\n  1848           25,185,647\r\n  1849           25,642,362\r\n  1850           15,822,273\r\n\r\nTo this has to be added nine or ten million dollars more for tobacco,\r\n72 million dollars for cotton, and 180,000 dollars for hops and other\r\nminor agricultural staples--making the value of the raw vegetable\r\nexports about 98 million dollars. There is further the value of the\r\nproducts of the forest, timber, ashes and bark, tar, &c., which are\r\nequal to nearly seven millions more, as shown by the following\r\nfigures:--\r\n\r\n                 Dollars.\r\n  1847          5,248,928\r\n  1848          6,415,297\r\n  1849          5,261,766\r\n  1850          6,590,037\r\n\r\nIt appears from an official document of the American Treasury\r\nDepartment, that the average value of the breadstuffs and provisions\r\nannually exported from the United States from 1821 to 1836 inclusive,\r\nwas 12,792,000 dolls.; in 1837 and 1838, about 9,600,000 dolls.; from\r\n1839 to 1846, 16,176,000 dolls.; and for the last seven years as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n                 Dollars.\r\n  1846          27,701,121\r\n  1847          68,701,921\r\n  1848          37,472,751\r\n  1849          38,155,507\r\n  1850          26,051,373\r\n  1851          21,948,651\r\n  1852          25,857,027\r\n\r\nOut of the wheat crop in the United States in 1846 of 110 million\r\nbushels raised, 10 millions were used for seed, starch, &c.; 72\r\nconsumed for food, and 28 million exported. The 460 million bushels of\r\nIndian corn raised, were thus disposed of; exported to foreign\r\ncountries 22 million bushels; sold to and consumed by non-producers,\r\n100 million; consumed on the farms and plantations of the producers\r\nfor human and animal food, seed, &c., 338 million bushels.\r\n\r\nThe United States now produce about 120 million bushels of wheat, and\r\nnearly 600 million bushels of corn. Their surplus of wheat, for\r\nexport, may be taken at 20 million bushels, and of Indian corn an\r\nalmost unlimited quantity. They export about one and a quarter million\r\nbarrels of flour, and about one million of bushels of wheat to other\r\nmarkets besides those of Great Britain or her North American colonies,\r\nviz., to Europe, Asia, Africa, the West Indies and South America,\r\nCalifornia and Australia, manufactured flour being the article\r\nrequired for these latter markets. Nearly four million bushels of\r\nIndian corn, and 300,000 barrels of corn meal, are exported from the\r\nUnited States to the West Indies and other foreign markets.\r\n\r\nFrom the abstracts of statistical returns prepared at the American\r\nCensus office, it appears that Pennsylvania, in 1850, was the largest\r\nwheat producing State of the Union. I have had the curiosity to\r\ncompare the most prominent States in respect to this crop, and give\r\nthem below, with the crop of each, as shown by the returns:--\r\n\r\n                         Bushels.\r\n  Pennsylvania          15,482,191\r\n  Ohio                  14,967,056\r\n  Virginia              14,516,900\r\n  New York              13,073,000\r\n  Michigan               4,918,000\r\n  Maryland               4,494,680\r\n\r\nThat the United States could export 6,000,000 bushels of wheat, and\r\nits equivalent in flour in 1845; 13,000,000 in 1846, 26,000,000 in\r\n1847, and then fell back to 13,000,000 in 1848, and 6,000,000 in 1849,\r\nwith their production of wheat constantly increasing throughout this\r\nperiod, shows a wonderful elasticity, and extensive home market. If\r\nthe price of wheat is higher in proportion than for corn, the\r\nAmericans export the former and consume the latter; if the demand for\r\ncorn be also great, they kill their hogs and export corn, for the pork\r\nwill keep. If there be no great demand for either, they eat their\r\nsurplus wheat, feed their hogs with the corn, and export pork as\r\nhaving the greatest value in the least bulk.\r\n\r\n        DESTINATION OF FLOUR SHIPPED FROM THE UNITED STATES.\r\n  -------------------------+---------+---------+---------+---------\r\n          WHERE TO.        |  1847   |  1849   |  1850   |  1851\r\n  -------------------------+---------+---------+---------+---------\r\n  Swedish West Indies      |    7,366|    7,573|    8,757|    5,315\r\n  Danish ditto             |   52,150|   49,568|   44,802|   60,102\r\n  Dutch East Indies        |    1,150|    4,625|    1,600|    1,873\r\n  Dutch West Indies        |   11,387|   17,221|   18,354|   19,217\r\n  Holland and Belgium      |   73,871|      727|    1,177|      594\r\n  England                  |2,475,076|  953,815|  369,777|1,004,783\r\n  Gibraltar                |   23,974|    6,265|    2,543|      195\r\n  British East Indies      |    3,034|      791|    1,646|    1,600\r\n  British West Indies      |  320,363|  303,551|  250,776|  294,731\r\n  British American Colonies|  272,299|  294,891|  244,072|  252,380\r\n  France                   |  612,641|    --   |    --   |    --\r\n  French West Indies       |   28,966|    5,554|    5,480|    7,902\r\n  Hayti                    |   40,257|   10,903|   31,504|   43,867\r\n  Cuba                     |   50,046|    7,154|    5,584|    5,611\r\n  Spanish West Indies      |   17,780|    6,429|    7,074|    2,285\r\n  Madeira                  |    4,856|    4,358|    6,321|    7,006\r\n  Cape de Verds            |    1,634|      501|      455|      838\r\n  Mexico                   |    5,928|   11,633|    9,736|   14,964\r\n  Honduras                 |   10,686|    4,125|    4,725|    5,912\r\n  Central America          |      550|    4,180|      746|    2,573\r\n  Columbia                 |   39,403|   32,251|   41,072|   47,477\r\n  Brazil                   |  270,473|  328,129|  295,415|  374,711\r\n  Argentine Republic       |   10,684|    6,599|    4,901|   22,612\r\n  Chili                    |    5,977|    5,129|    2,848|    4,327\r\n  South America            |    2,128|    --   |       40|      200\r\n  West Indies              |    4,902|    3,984|    1,702|    4,079\r\n  Africa                   |   25,728|    4,617|    5,524|    5,430\r\n  North-west Coast         |      764|    1,180|      858|    2,593\r\n  Other ports              |   29,866|   35,017|   18,949|   19,158\r\n                           |---------|---------|---------|---------\r\n  Total--Barrels           |4,382,496|2,108,013|1,385,448|2,202,335\r\n                           |---------|---------|---------|---------\r\n  Average price            |     5.95|     5.35|     5.00|     4.77\r\n  -------------------------+---------+---------+---------+---------\r\n\r\nWheat, where the soil and the climate are adapted to its growth, and\r\nthe requisite progress has been made in its culture, is decidedly\r\npreferred to all other grains, and, next to maize, is the most\r\nimportant crop in the United States, not only on account of its\r\ngeneral use for bread, but for its safety and convenience for\r\nexportation. It is not known to what country it is indigenous, any\r\nmore than any other cultivated cereals, all of which, no doubt, have\r\nbeen essentially improved by man. By some, wheat is considered to have\r\nbeen coeval with the creation, as it is known that upwards of a\r\nthousand years before our era it was cultivated, and a superior\r\nvariety had been attained. It has steadily followed the progress of\r\ncivilisation from the earliest times, in all countries where it would\r\ngrow. In 1776 there was entailed upon America an enduring calamity, in\r\nconsequence of the introduction of the Hessian or wheat fly, which was\r\nsupposed to have been brought from Germany in some straw, employed in\r\nthe debarkation of Howe's troops on the west end of Long Island. From\r\nthat point the insect gradually spread in various directions, at the\r\nrate of twenty or thirty miles a year, and the wheat of the entire\r\nregions east of the Alleghanies is now more or less infested with the\r\nlarva, as well as in large portions of the States bordering on the\r\nOhio and Mississippi, and on the great Lakes; and so great have been\r\nthe ravages of these insects that the cultivation of this grain has in\r\nmany places been abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe geographical range of the wheat region in the Eastern Continent\r\nand Australia, lies principally between the 30th and 60th parallels of\r\nnorth latitude, and the 30th and 40th degrees south, being chiefly\r\nconfined to France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Sicily, Greece, Turkey,\r\nRussia, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Poland, Prussia, Netherlands,\r\nBelgium, Great Britain, Ireland, Northern and Southern Africa,\r\nTartary, India, China, Australia, Van Diemen's Land, and Japan. Along\r\nthe Atlantic portions of the Western Continent, it embraces the tract\r\nlying between the 30th and 50th parallels, and in the country\r\nwestward of the Rocky Mountains, one or two more degrees further\r\nnorth. Along the west coast of South America, as well as in situations\r\nwithin the torrid zone, sufficiently elevated above the level of the\r\nsea, and properly irrigated by natural or artificial means, abundant\r\ncrops are often produced.\r\n\r\nThe principal districts of the United States in which this important\r\ngrain is produced in the greatest abundance, and where it forms a\r\nleading article of commerce, embrace the States of New York, New\r\nJersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky,\r\nMichigan, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Wisconsin, and Iowa. The chief\r\nvarieties cultivated in the Northern and Eastern States are the white\r\nflint, tea, Siberian, bald, Black Sea, and the Italian spring wheat.\r\nIn the middle and Western States, the Mediterranean, the Virginia\r\nwhite May, the blue stem, the Indiana, the Kentucky white bearded, the\r\nold red chafet, and the Talavera. The yield varies from ten to forty\r\nbushels and upwards per acre, weighing, per bushel, from fifty-eight\r\nto sixty-seven pounds.\r\n\r\nIt appears that on the whole crop of the United States there was a\r\ngain during the ten years ending 1850, of 15,645,373 bushels. The crop\r\nof New England decreased from 2,014,000 to 1,078,000 bushels,\r\nexhibiting a decline of 936,000 bushels, and indicating the attention\r\nof farmers has been much withdrawn from the culture of wheat. Grouping\r\nthe States from the Hudson to the Potomac, including the district of\r\nColumbia, it appears that they produced, in 1849, 35,085,000 bushels,\r\nagainst 29,936,000 in 1839. In Virginia there was an increase of\r\n1,123,000 bushels. These States embrace the oldest wheat-growing\r\nregion of the country, and that in which the soil and climate seem to\r\nbe adapted to promote the permanent culture of the grain. The increase\r\nof production in the ten years has been 6,272,000 bushels, equal to\r\n15.6 per cent. The area tilled in these States is 36,000,000 acres,\r\nonly thirty per cent. of the whole amount returned, while the\r\nproportion of wheat produced is forty-six per cent. In North Carolina\r\nthere has been an increase of 170,000 bushels, but in the Southern\r\nStates generally there was a considerable decrease. Indiana, Illinois,\r\nMichigan, and Wisconsin contributed to the general aggregate under the\r\nsixth census only 9,800,000 bushels; under the last they are shown to\r\nhave produced upwards of 25,000,000 bushels, an amount equal to the\r\nwhole increase in the United States for the period.\r\n\r\nWhen we see the growth of wheat keeping pace with the progress of\r\npopulation in the oldest States of the Union, we need have no\r\napprehension of a decline in the cultivation of this important crop.\r\n\r\nThe amount of flour exported from New Jersey in 1751, was 6,424\r\nbarrels. From Philadelphia in 1752,125,960 barrels, besides 85,500\r\nbushels of wheat; in 1767, 198,816 barrels, besides 367,500 bushels of\r\nwheat; in 1771, 252,744 barrels. From Savannah, in 1771, 7,200 lbs.\r\nFrom Virginia, for some years annually preceding the revolution,\r\n800,000 bushels of wheat. The total exports of flour from the United\r\nStates:\r\n\r\nin 1791 were  619,681 barrels, besides 1,018,339 bushels of wheat;\r\nin 1800,      653,052 barrels, besides    26,853 bushels of wheat;\r\nin 1810,      798,431 barrels, besides   325,924 bushels of wheat;\r\nin 1820-21, 1,056,119 barrels, besides    25,821 bushels of wheat;\r\nin 1830-31, 1,806,529 barrels, besides   408,910 bushels of wheat;\r\nin 1840-41, 1,515,817 barrels, besides   868,585 bushels of wheat;\r\nin 1845-46, 2,289,476 barrels, besides 1,613,795 bushels of wheat;\r\nin 1846-47, 4,382,496 barrels, besides 4,399,951 bushels of wheat;\r\nin 1850-51, 2,202,335 barrels, besides 1,026,725 bushels of wheat.\r\n\r\nIn the London Exhibition very little wheat was exhibited equal to that\r\nfrom the United States, especially that from Genessee county, in the\r\nState of New York--a soft white variety, to the exhibitor of which a\r\nprize medal was awarded by the Royal Commissioners. The red\r\nMediterranean wheat exhibited from the United States attracted much\r\nattention. The wheat from South Australia was probably superior to any\r\nexhibited, while much from the United States fell but little behind,\r\nand was unquestionably next in quality.\r\n\r\nFrom the Second Report on the Breadstuffs of the United States, made\r\nto the Commissioner of Patents, by Lewis C. Beck, M.D., I am induced\r\nto make some extracts. He states:--\r\n\r\n    The analyses of several samples, the growth of various foreign\r\n    countries, have afforded me an opportunity of comparing the American\r\n    and foreign wheats and flours. With a few exceptions of peculiar\r\n    varieties, it will be seen from the results that with ordinary care\r\n    the wheat of this country will compare advantageously with that of\r\n    any other. Indeed, on reviewing my analyses, I question whether\r\n    there is any part of the world where this grain is generally of a\r\n    finer quality than it is in the United States. But all the\r\n    advantages which we possess in this respect will be of little avail\r\n    so long as inferior and damaged breadstuffs are shipped from our\r\n    ports.\r\n\r\n    In addition to the analyses which I have executed of the various\r\n    samples of wheat and wheat flour according to the mode heretofore\r\n    pursued, I have performed a series of experiments for the purpose of\r\n    settling the important question in regard to the relative value of\r\n    the fine flour of wheat, and the \"whole meal.\" I have also consulted\r\n    every work within my reach which could throw any light upon the\r\n    different points that have presented themselves during the progress\r\n    of the investigation.\r\n\r\n    The large number of samples of wheat and wheat flour which have been\r\n    placed in my hands for examination, have left me no time for the\r\n    analysis of our other breadstuffs.\r\n\r\n    It cannot be denied that the amount shipped to foreign ports during\r\n    1849 is considerably less than for the two preceding years. In the\r\n    meantime, however, a new and important market has been opened in our\r\n    territories on the Pacific. It may also be safely affirmed that the\r\n    causes for foreign demand, and which must hereafter operate, still\r\n    remain. These are the cheapness of land in this country, and the\r\n    peculiar adaptation of our soil and climate to the growth of the two\r\n    important cereals, wheat and maize.\r\n\r\n    Another fact, it seems to me, is of sufficient interest in\r\n    connection with this subject, to be here noticed. The failure of the\r\n    potato crop in various parts of the world for several years past has\r\n    engaged the attention of scientific and practical men.\r\n    Unfortunately, the nature of the blight which has seized upon this\r\n    tuber has eluded the most careful inquiries; but it has been shown\r\n    by well-conducted analyses that potatoes at their late prices are\r\n    the most expensive kind of farinaceous food. This will be evident\r\n    from the following statement:--\r\n\r\n    \"Potatoes contain from about seventy to seventy-nine per cent. of\r\n    water, while the proportion in wheat flour is from twelve to\r\n    fourteen per cent; and while the gluten and albumen in potatoes\r\n    scarcely rise to one per cent., in wheat flour the range may be set\r\n    down at from nine to thirteen per cent. Again, the non-nitrogenous\r\n    principles are as about seventy-five per cent. in wheat flour\r\n    against fifteen or sixteen in potatoes. In short, whilst potatoes\r\n    supply only twenty per cent. of heat-forming and nutritious\r\n    principles, taken together, wheat supplies more than seventy per\r\n    cent. of the former, and more than tea of the latter. The value of\r\n    wheat to potatoes, therefore, is at least four to one; or, if wheat\r\n    sells at fifteen shillings sterling per cwt., potatoes to be equally\r\n    cheap, ought to sell at between three and four shillings.\"\r\n\r\n    The preceding results, for which I am principally indebted to Dr.\r\n    Daubeny, Professor of Chemistry at Oxford,[25] show that unless a\r\n    great change occurs in the culture of the potato, there must be an\r\n    increased demand for other kinds of farinaceous food. And it is\r\n    worthy of notice that while this blight is one of the causes which\r\n    bring to our shores the starving population of Europe, the raising\r\n    of the cereals not only furnishes profitable employment to the\r\n    emigrant, but enables him to make the best return to those who are\r\n    still obliged to remain.\r\n\r\n    _Adaptation of the soil and climate of the United States to the\r\n    culture of the cereals_.--That the soil and climate of many portions\r\n    of the United States are well adapted to the cultivation of the more\r\n    important cereals, is fully shown by the results of all the\r\n    researches which have thus far been prosecuted. I have indeed seen\r\n    it asserted that the climate of England is the best for the\r\n    cultivation of wheat, and preferable to any in our country; its\r\n    humidity being the peculiarity to which this superiority is\r\n    ascribed.[26] But this is undoubtedly the testimony of a too partial\r\n    witness. A recent statement by an English author is the result of a\r\n    more correct knowledge of the facts. He acknowledges that there is\r\n    no ground for the expectation which has been entertained concerning\r\n    the advantageous growth of maize in England. \"Nor is ours,\" says he,\r\n    \"the most favorable country for wheat, but skill in husbandry has\r\n    overcome great difficulties.\"[27] The mistake on this subject may\r\n    have originated from the occurrence of a larger and plumper grain in\r\n    the more humid climate; but analysis shows that the small grain\r\n    raised in the hotter and drier air oftentimes greatly surpasses the\r\n    former in its nutritious value.\r\n\r\n    Russia is said to be the great rival of this country in the growth\r\n    of wheat, but I think it doubtful whether she possesses superior\r\n    natural advantages; and I am sure she will find it difficult to\r\n    compete with the industry and skill which here characterize the\r\n    operations of husbandry, and the manufacture and shipment of\r\n    breadstuffs.\r\n\r\n    _Export of sophisticated and damaged flour_.--It is a matter of deep\r\n    regret that circumstances have occurred which must have a most\r\n    injurious influence upon the trade in breadstuffs between this\r\n    country and Great Britain. I refer to the mixtures of damaged,\r\n    inferior, and good kinds of flour, which it appears on authentic\r\n    testimony have been largely exported during the past year. Whether\r\n    this fraudulent operation, which is said to have been principally\r\n    confined to New York, is the result of the change in the inspection\r\n    laws, as some assert, I am unable to say. But it requires no great\r\n    foresight to predict that, if continued, it will create a distrust\r\n    of our breadstuffs in foreign ports which it will be very difficult\r\n    to remove. It cannot but excite the indignation of the many\r\n    honorable dealers, that the unworthy cupidity of a few individuals\r\n    should lead to such disastrous consequences.\r\n\r\n    I have as yet been unable to obtain samples of these sophisticated\r\n    flours, and the only information which I have in regard to them is\r\n    the general fact above stated, and concerning the truth of which\r\n    there can be little doubt. No means should be left untried to\r\n    devise some mode by which these frauds can be easily and certainly\r\n    detected.\r\n\r\n    _Injury sustained by breadstuffs during their transport and\r\n    shipment._--During the past year, I have had abundant means of\r\n    determining the nature of the injuries which are often sustained by\r\n    our breadstuffs in their transport from the particular districts in\r\n    which they are grown and manufactured to our commercial depots, and\r\n    in their shipment to foreign ports. As this is one of the most\r\n    important points connected with these researches, I have devoted\r\n    much time to its investigation. From the results of numerous\r\n    analyses, I think it may be safely asserted, that of the wheat flour\r\n    which arrives in England from various ports of the United States, a\r\n    large proportion is more or less injured during the voyage. The same\r\n    remark may be made in regard to many of the samples sent from the\r\n    Western States to the city of New York. Their nutritive value is\r\n    considerably impaired, and without more care than is usually\r\n    exercised, they are entirely unfit for export.\r\n\r\n    In my former report, I adverted to one of the great causes of the\r\n    deterioration which our breadstuffs often suffer during their\r\n    transport and shipment. This was the undue proportion of the great\r\n    disorganizing substance, water, under the influence of what usually\r\n    occurs, viz., an elevation of temperature above the ordinary\r\n    standard. My recent investigations have served only to strengthen\r\n    these views. There is no doubt that these are the conditions which\r\n    cause the change of the non-nitrogenous principles into acids (the\r\n    lactic or acetic), while a portion of the gluten is thus also\r\n    consumed.\r\n\r\n    I have tried a series of experiments in reference to the action of\r\n    moisture upon various samples of wheat and wheat flour. The samples\r\n    were placed for twelve hours in the oven of a bath with a double\r\n    casing, containing a boiling saturated solution of common salt, the\r\n    temperature of which was about 220 deg. Fahr. Subjected to this\r\n    test,\r\n\r\n  100 grains of Milwaukie wheat lost                 12.10 grains.\r\n   \"    \"       Guilderland (Holland) wheat lost      9.35     \"\r\n   \"    \"       Polish Odessa red wheat      \"       10.55     \"\r\n   \"    \"       Soft Russian wheat           \"        8.55     \"\r\n   \"    \"       Kobanga wheat                \"        8.15     \"\r\n\r\n    After an exposure of the dried samples to the air for two or three\r\n    days, they increased in weight from one to three grains in the\r\n    hundred originally employed.\r\n\r\n    Nineteen different samples of wheat flour, which lost by exposure to\r\n    the above heat from ten to fourteen grains in the one hundred, when\r\n    similarly exposed to the air for eighteen hours, again increased in\r\n    weight from 8.40 to 11.60 in the hundred grains originally employed.\r\n\r\n    These experiments show, what might indeed have been predicted as to\r\n    the general result, that wheat in grain, if not less liable to\r\n    injury than flour, yet if once properly dried, suffers much less\r\n    from a subsequent exposure to air and moisture.\r\n\r\n    It is now ascertained that in presence of a considerable proportion\r\n    of water, wheat flour under the influence of heat undergoes a low\r\n    degree at least of lactic fermentation, which will account for the\r\n    _souring_ of the ordinary samples when exposed to warm or humid\r\n    climates. The same result will inevitably follow from their careless\r\n    exposure in the holds of vessels. That this is particularly the case\r\n    with many of the cargoes of wheat flour shipped to Great Britain,\r\n    there is little reason to doubt. This may be partly owing to the\r\n    great humidity of the English climate, as the deterioration is\r\n    observed as well in the flour which is the produce of that country\r\n    as in that which is received from abroad.\r\n\r\n    It is stated by Mr. Edlin, quoted in an article on Baking, in the\r\n    _Encyclopædia Britannica_, that, \"as a general rule, the London\r\n    flour\" is decidedly bad. The gluten generally wants the adhesiveness\r\n    which characterizes the gluten of good wheat.\"\r\n\r\n    I have observed that, in the analyses of some of the samples of\r\n    damaged flour, the proportions of what is set down under the head of\r\n    glucose and dextrine are unusually large. This is perhaps due to the\r\n    change produced in the starch by the action of diastase, and which\r\n    may under certain circumstances be formed in wheat flour. It would\r\n    seem, according to M. Guérin, that starch may thus be acted on even\r\n    at slightly elevated temperatures. In one of his experiments, at a\r\n    temperature no higher than 68 deg. Fahr., a quantity of starch, at\r\n    the end of twenty-four hours, was converted into syrup, which\r\n    yielded seventy-seven per cent. of saccharine matter.[28] It may be\r\n    thought that I have overrated the importance of this subject, but it\r\n    is believed that a careful examination of the facts will relieve me\r\n    from this charge. I am now satisfied that, if the proportion of\r\n    water in our exported breadstuffs could be reduced to about five or\r\n    six per cent., one of the great causes of complaint in regard to\r\n    them would be completely removed.\r\n\r\n    _Kiln-drying of breadstuffs, and exclusion of air_.--The injury\r\n    which our breadstuffs sustain by the large proportion of water can\r\n    of course be prevented only by careful drying before shipment, and\r\n    by the employment of barrels rendered as impervious as possible to\r\n    the influence of atmospheric moisture.\r\n\r\n    In my first report, I have spoken favorably of the process of drying\r\n    by steam, according to the plan patented by Mr. J.R. Stafford. I\r\n    still think this mode possesses great advantages over those\r\n    previously followed, and which almost always injured the quality of\r\n    the grain or flour: but from some trials which I have made during\r\n    the past year, it is inferred that the exposure to the heat is\r\n    perhaps usually not sufficiently prolonged to answer the purpose\r\n    intended by the operation. I have often observed that samples of\r\n    wheat flour, after being exposed to the heat of the salt water-bath\r\n    oven (220 deg. Fahr.) for two or three hours, lost weight by a\r\n    further continuance of the heat. An apparatus has been patented by\r\n    Mr. J.H. Tower, of Clinton, N.Y., consisting of a cylinder of square\r\n    apartments or tubes, into which the grain or flour is introduced,\r\n    and subjected to heat while in rapid revolution. I examined samples\r\n    which had been subjected to this operation, and ascertained that\r\n    wheat flour, originally containing 14.80 per cent. of water, had the\r\n    proportion reduced to 10.25 per cent., while in wheat the proportion\r\n    of water was reduced from 14.75 to 8.55 per cent.\r\n\r\n    Now it is probable that by either of the above modes, and perhaps by\r\n    many others, the various kinds of breadstuffs may be brought to that\r\n    degree of dryness which, with ordinary care, shall protect them from\r\n    subsequent injury; but in order to secure this advantage, the\r\n    operation must be carefully performed, and experiments must be made\r\n    to ascertain how long an exposure to heat is necessary to bring the\r\n    sample to the proper degree of dryness, and to determine whether in\r\n    any respect its quality is impaired. It has already been stated that\r\n    absolute desiccation is not necessary, even were it attainable; but\r\n    any process in order to be effective should reduce the proportion of\r\n    water to about six, or at most seven per cent.\r\n\r\n    I have heretofore adverted to the great care employed in the drying\r\n    of grain in various foreign countries, and to which the preservation\r\n    of it for a great number of years is to be ascribed.\r\n\r\n    The operation is not conducted in the hurried manner which is here\r\n    thought to be so essential, but is continued long enough to effect\r\n    the intended object. Thorough ventilation, as well as the proper\r\n    degree of drying, and which is equally important, is thus secured.\r\n\r\n    It is said that in Russia the sheaves of wheat, carried into the\r\n    huts, are suspended upon poles and dried by the heat of the oven.\r\n    The grain shrinks very much during this process, but it is supposed\r\n    to be less liable to the attacks of insects, and preserves its\r\n    nutritive qualities for many years. During the winter, it is sent to\r\n    market.--(\"The Czar, his Court and People.\" By John S. Maxwell, p.\r\n    272.)\r\n\r\n    With all the necessary attention which may be paid to the proper\r\n    drying of our breadstuffs intended for export, another point is of\r\n    equal importance, viz., the shipment in vessels rendered as\r\n    impervious as possible to the influence of atmospheric moisture. For\r\n    however carefully and thoroughly the drying, especially of wheat\r\n    flour or maize meal, may have been performed, it will be nearly\r\n    useless if the shipment is afterwards made in the barrels commonly\r\n    employed.[29] And it is very certain that the transport and shipment\r\n    of grain in bulk, as usually conducted, are attended with great\r\n    loss. This difficulty might be removed at a trifling expense by\r\n    adopting the plan suggested in the preceding report, and to which I\r\n    would again respectfully call the attention of those who are engaged\r\n    in this branch of trade.\r\n\r\n    I might here adduce a mass of testimony showing the importance of\r\n    the matters just referred to, but will only advert to the following\r\n    statements, which although made in allusion principally to maize,\r\n    are equally applicable to our other breadstuffs. Maize meal, if kept\r\n    too long, \"is liable to become rancid, and it is then more or less\r\n    unfit for use. In the shipments made to the West Indies, the meal is\r\n    commonly kiln-dried, to obviate as much as possible this tendency to\r\n    rancidity.\" \"When ground very fine, maize meal suffers a change by\r\n    exposure to the air. It is oxygenated. It is upon the same principle\r\n    that the juice of an apple, after a little exposure to the air, is\r\n    oxygenated, and changes its character and taste. If the flour could\r\n    be bolted _in vacuo_, it would not be changed.\" \"Intelligent writers\r\n    speak of the necessity of preparing corn for exportation by\r\n    kiln-drying as indispensable. Without that process, corn is very\r\n    liable to become heated and musty, so as to be unfit for food for\r\n    either man or beast. The kiln-dried maize meal from the Brandywine\r\n    Mills, &c., made from the yellow corn, has almost monopolized the\r\n    West India trade. This process is indispensable, if we export maize\r\n    to Europe. James Candy says that from fifty years experience he has\r\n    learned the necessity of this process with corn intended for\r\n    exportation.\" \"I have often found the corn from our country when it\r\n    reached its destination, ruined by heating on the voyage. It had\r\n    become musty and of little or no value. Kiln-drying is absolutely\r\n    necessary to preserve it for exportation. We must learn and practice\r\n    the best mode of kiln-drying it.[30]\"\r\n\r\n     _The nutritious value of the \"whole meal\" of Wheat, as compared\r\n     with that of the fine flour_.--The question whether what is\r\n     called the whole meal of wheat, or that which is obtained by the\r\n     mixture of the bran, contains more nutritious matter than the\r\n     fine flour, is one of great importance. In my former report, I\r\n     adverted to the statement made in regard to it by Professor\r\n     J.F.W. Johnston, and which seemed to be almost conclusive in\r\n     favor of the value of the whole meal. During the past year,\r\n     however (1849), M. Eug. Peligot, an eminent French chemist, in an\r\n     elaborate article \"On the Composition of Wheat,\" to which more\r\n     particular reference will be made hereafter, combats the opinion\r\n     that the bran is an alimentary substance. He observes that \"the\r\n     difficulty of keeping the bran in flour intended for the\r\n     manufacture of bread of good quality appears to result much less\r\n     from the presence of the cellulose (one of the constituents of\r\n     woody matter) contained in wheat than that of the fatty matter.\r\n     This is found in the bran in a quantity at least triple of that\r\n     which remains in the flour, and the bolting separates it from the\r\n     ground wheat not less usefully than the cellulose itself.\"[31] M.\r\n     Millon objects entirely to the views of M. Peligot on this point,\r\n     and states some facts which are especially worthy of\r\n     consideration. He asserts that, according to the views of the\r\n     last named chemist, the separation at most of one part of fatty\r\n     matter sacrifices fifteen, twenty, and even twenty-five per cent.\r\n     of substances which are of the highest nutritive value. This\r\n     abstracts from wheat, for the whole amount raised in France, the\r\n     enormous sum of about two hundred millions of pounds annually.\r\n\r\n    It seems that in France the question whether the bolting of flour is\r\n    advantageous has always been decided in the most arbitrary manner.\r\n    An ordinance of Louis XIV., issued in 1658, prohibited, under a very\r\n    heavy penalty, the regrinding of the bran and its mixture with the\r\n    flour; this, with the mode of grinding then in use, caused a loss of\r\n    more than forty per cent.--(Comptes Rendus, February 19th, 1849.)\r\n\r\n    In large cities and elsewhere, there seems for some time to have\r\n    been a growing prejudice against the use of brown bread; and it is\r\n    said that now nearly all the peasantry of France bolt their flour.\r\n    The increase of this practice, according to M. Millon, threatens\r\n    the nation with an annual loss of from two to three hundred millions\r\n    of francs. If the bran was entirely valueless, there would be a loss\r\n    of more than one million a day.\r\n\r\n    It is quite difficult to determine the precise amount of bran which\r\n    may have been removed from wheat, for various samples contain such a\r\n    different proportion of bran that in the one case a removal of ten\r\n    per cent, leaves more bran in the flour than a bolting of five per\r\n    cent. in another.\r\n\r\n    The following is an analysis of bran by M. Millon; the sample being\r\n    a soft French wheat grown in 1848:--\r\n\r\n  Starch, dextrine and sugar                                   53.00\r\n  Sugar of liquorice                                            1.00\r\n  Gluten                                                       14.90\r\n  Fatty matter                                                  3.60\r\n  Woody matter                                                  9.70\r\n  Salts                                                          .50\r\n  Water                                                        13.90\r\n  Incrusting matter and aromatic principles (by difference)     3.40\r\n                                                              ------\r\n                                                              100.\r\n\r\n    The conclusion to be drawn from this analysis is, that bran is an\r\n    alimentary substance. If it contains six per cent. more of woody\r\n    matter than the rough, flour, it has also more gluten, double that\r\n    of fatty matter, besides two aromatic principles which have the\r\n    perfume of honey, and both of which are wanting in the fine flour.\r\n    Thus by bolting, wheat is impoverished in its most valuable\r\n    principles, merely to remove a few hundredths of woody matter.\r\n\r\n    The economical suggestion which springs from these views is, that\r\n    the bran and coarse flour should be reground and then mixed with the\r\n    fine flour. Millon states that he has ascertained, by repeated\r\n    experiments, that bread thus made is of superior quality, easily\r\n    worked, and not subject to the inconvenience of bread manufactured\r\n    from the rough flour, such as is made in some places, and especially\r\n    in Belgium.\r\n\r\n    Opinions similar to those above noticed are entertained by Professor\r\n    Daubeny. \"The great importance attached to having bread perfectly\r\n    white is a prejudice,\" he says, \"which leads to the rejection of a\r\n    very wholesome part of the food, and one which, although not\r\n    digestible alone, is sufficiently so in that state of admixture with\r\n    the flour in which nature has prepared it for our use.\" After\r\n    quoting the remarks of Professor Johnston on the same side of the\r\n    question, he adds, \"that according to the experiments of Magendie,\r\n    animals fed upon fine flour died in a few weeks, whilst they thrived\r\n    upon the whole meal bread.\" Brown bread, therefore, should be\r\n    adopted, not merely on a principle of economy, but also as providing\r\n    more of those ingredients which are perhaps deficient in the finer\r\n    parts of the flour.--(\"Gardeners' Chronicle,\" January 27th, 1849, p.\r\n    53.)\r\n\r\n    The remarks of Dr. Robertson may also be here introduced. \"The\r\n    advantage,\" he observes, \"of using more or less of the coverings of\r\n    the grain in the preparation of bread has often been urged on\r\n    economical principles. There can be no doubt that a very large\r\n    proportion of nutritive matter is contained in the bran and the\r\n    pollard; and these are estimated to contain about one-fifth part of\r\n    the entire weight of the wheat grain. It is, unquestionably, so far\r\n    wasteful to remove these altogether from the flour; and in the case\r\n    of the majority of people, this waste may be unnecessary, even on\r\n    the score of digestibility.\"[32] This subject can also be rendered\r\n    apparent to the eye. If we make a cross section of a grain of wheat,\r\n    or rye, and place it under the microscope, we perceive very distinct\r\n    layers in it as we examine from without inwards. The outer of them\r\n    belong to the husk of the fruit and seed, and are separated as bran,\r\n    in grinding. But the millstone does not separate so exactly as the\r\n    eye may by means of the microscope, not even as accurately as the\r\n    knife of the vegetable anatomist, and thus with the bran is removed\r\n    also the whole outer layer of the cells of the nucleus, and even\r\n    some of the subjacent layers. Thus the anatomical investigations of\r\n    one of these corn grains at once explains why bread is so much the\r\n    less nutritious the more carefully the bran has been separated from\r\n    the meal.[33] There can therefore be little doubt that the removal\r\n    of the bran is a serious injury to the flour; and I have presented\r\n    the above array of evidence on this point in the hope of directing\r\n    public attention to it here, as has been done in various foreign\r\n    countries.\r\n\r\n    After this, it will easily be inferred that I am not disposed to\r\n    look with much favor upon the plan proposed by Mr. Bentz for taking\r\n    the outer coating or bran from wheat and other grains previously to\r\n    grinding.[34] Independently of the considerations which have already\r\n    been presented, it is far from being proved, as this gentlemen\r\n    asserts, that the mixture of the bran with the meal which results\r\n    from the common mode of grinding is the chief cause of the _souring_\r\n    of the flour in hot climates. On the contrary, the bran is perhaps\r\n    as little liable to undergo change as the fine flour, and then the\r\n    moistening to which, as I am informed, the grain is subjected\r\n    previously to the removal of the husk, is still further\r\n    objectionable, and must be followed by a most carefully-conducted\r\n    process of kiln-drying.\r\n\r\n    _Nutritious properties of various articles of food_.--There seems to\r\n    be some difference of opinion in regard to the nutritious properties\r\n    of various kinds of food. It is generally, however, agreed that\r\n    those which contain the largest proportion of nitrogenous matters\r\n    are the most nutritious. It is on this account that haricots, peas,\r\n    and beans, form, in some sort, substitutes for animal food. Tubers,\r\n    roots, and even the seeds of the cereal grasses, are but moderately\r\n    nutritious. If we see herbivorous animals fattening upon such\r\n    articles, it is because, from their peculiar organisation, they can\r\n    consume them in large quantities. It is quite doubtful whether a man\r\n    doing hard work could exist on bread exclusively. The instances\r\n    which are given of countries where rice and potatoes form the sole\r\n    articles of food of the inhabitants, are believed to be incomplete.\r\n    Boussingault states that in Alsace, for example, the peasantry\r\n    always associate their potato dish with a large quantity of sour or\r\n    curdled milk; in Ireland with buttermilk. \"The Indians of the Upper\r\n    Andes do not by any means live on potatoes alone, as some travellers\r\n    have said they do: at Quito, the daily food of the inhabitants is\r\n    _lorco_, a compound of potatoes and a large quantity of cheese. Rice\r\n    is often cited as one of the most nourishing articles of diet. I am\r\n    satisfied, however, after having lived in countries where rice is\r\n    largely consumed, that it is anything but a substantial, or, for its\r\n    bulk, nutritious article of sustenance.\"--(\"Rural Economy,\" Amer.\r\n    edition, p. 409.) These statements are further confirmed by the\r\n    observations of M. Lequerri, who, during a long residence in India,\r\n    paid particular attention to the manners and customs of the\r\n    inhabitants of Pondicherry. \"Their food,\" he states, \"is almost\r\n    entirely vegetable, and rice is the staple; the inferior castes only\r\n    ever eat meat. But all eat _kari_ (curry), an article prepared with\r\n    meat, fish, or vegetable, which is mixed with the rice, boiled in\r\n    very little water. It is requisite to have seen the Indians at their\r\n    meals to have any idea of the enormous quantity of rice which they\r\n    will put into their stomachs. No European could cram so much at a\r\n    time; and they very commonly allow that rice alone will not nourish\r\n    them. They very generally still eat a quantity of bread.\"[35] In\r\n    regard to the proportion of nutritious matter contained in grains of\r\n    various kinds, it may be remarked that the tables which have been\r\n    constructed as the results of various experiments are liable to an\r\n    objection, which will be more particularly adverted to under another\r\n    head. For example, two substances, by the process of ultimate\r\n    analysis, may exhibit the same proportion of nitrogenous matter, and\r\n    still differ very materially in their value as articles of food.\r\n    Much depends on the digestibility of the form in which this matter\r\n    is presented to the digestive organs. A strong illustration is\r\n    afforded in the case of hay, the proportion of nutritive matter of\r\n    which, about 9.71, would certainly not represent its power of\r\n    affording nourishment to the human system. It is in truth quite\r\n    impossible to arrive at any other than approximate results from the\r\n    operations of chemistry, as to the amount of nutriment contained in\r\n    a given quantity or weight of any article of food.[36] It is perhaps\r\n    not irrelevant to notice in this place some of the researches which\r\n    have recently been made upon fermentation, and particularly its\r\n    effects in the manufacture of bread. It appears that when this\r\n    process is brought about by the addition of yeast or leaven to the\r\n    paste or dough, the character of the mass is materially altered. A\r\n    larger or smaller proportion of the flour is virtually lost.\r\n    According to Dr. William Gregory the loss amounts to the very large\r\n    proportion of one-sixteenth part of the whole of the flour. He says,\r\n    \"To avoid this loss, bread is now raised by means of carbonate of\r\n    soda, or ammonia and a diluted acid, which are added to the dough,\r\n    and the effect is perfectly satisfactory. Equally good or better\r\n    bread is obtained, and the quantity of flour which will yield\r\n    fifteen hundred loaves by fermentation, furnishes sixteen hundred by\r\n    the new method, the sugar and fibrin (gluten) being\r\n    saved.\"--(\"Outlines of Chemistry,\" p. 352.)\r\n\r\n    Another author, Dr. R.D. Thomson, states, as the results of his\r\n    experiments upon bread produced by the action of hydrochloric acid\r\n    upon carbonate of soda, \"that in a sack of flour there was a\r\n    difference in favor of the unfermented bread to the amount of thirty\r\n    pounds thirteen ounces, or in round numbers, a sack of flour would\r\n    produce one hundred and seven loaves of unfermented bread, and only\r\n    one hundred loaves of fermented bread of the game weight. Hence it\r\n    appears that in the sack of flour by the common process of baking,\r\n    seven loaves, or six-and-a-half per cent, of the flour are driven\r\n    into the air and lost.\"--(\"Experimental Researches on the Food of\r\n    Animals,\" &c., p. 183.)\r\n\r\n    The only objection to the general introduction of this process seems\r\n    to be the degree of care and accuracy required in properly adjusting\r\n    the respective qualities and quantities of acid and alkali, and\r\n    which could seldom be attained even by those who are largely engaged\r\n    in the manufacture of bread.\r\n\r\n    I cannot leave this subject without adverting to a practice which\r\n    has prevailed in England and France, and perhaps also in this\r\n    country, of steeping wheat before sowing it in solutions of arsenic,\r\n    sulphate of copper, and other poisonous preparations.\r\n\r\n    The result has been that injurious effects have often followed, both\r\n    to those who are employed in sowing such grain, and to those who\r\n    have used the bread manufactured from it. The great importance of\r\n    the subject led to the appointment of a commission at Rouen, in\r\n    France, in December, 1842, having for its object to determine the\r\n    best process of preventing the smut in wheat, and to ascertain\r\n    whether other means less dangerous than those above noticed were\r\n    productive of equally good results. The labors of this commission\r\n    extended over the years 1843-'44-'45, and the experiments were\r\n    repeated two years following on the farm of Mr. Fauchet, one of the\r\n    commission, at Boisquilaume, in the department of the Seine\r\n    Inferieure.\r\n\r\n    The results arrived at by this commission are--1st. That it is not\r\n    best to sow seed without steeping. 2nd. That it is best to make use\r\n    of the sulphate of soda and lime process, inasmuch as it is more\r\n    simple and economical, in no way injurious to the health, and yields\r\n    the soundest and most productive wheat. 3rd. That the use of\r\n    arsenic, sulphate of copper, verdigris, and other poisonous\r\n    preparations, should be interdicted by the government.--(\"Gardeners'\r\n    Chronicle,\" January 6th, 1849, pp. 10 and 11.)\r\n\r\n    _Composition of wheat and wheat flour, and the various modes of\r\n    determining their nutritive value_.--In my former report it was\r\n    stated that the analyses of the various samples of wheat, the\r\n    results of which were there given, had been chiefly directed to the\r\n    determining the amount of rough _gluten_ which they contained. My\r\n    reasons for adopting this plan, and the arguments in favor of its\r\n    general accuracy, as compared with other modes of analysis, and\r\n    especially that by which the ultimate composition is ascertained,\r\n    were also detailed. A more full examination of this subject has\r\n    served only to strengthen the opinion already expressed, that for\r\n    the great purpose to be answered by these researches, the process\r\n    which I have adopted is, to say the least, as free from objection\r\n    as any other, and if carefully and uniformly carried out, will truly\r\n    represent the relative values of the several samples of wheat flour.\r\n    As this is a matter of much consequence in a practical point of\r\n    view, I trust I shall be excused for introducing some additional\r\n    facts in regard to it.\r\n\r\n    The term _gluten_ was originally applied to the gray, viscid,\r\n    tenacious, and elastic matter, which is obtained by subjecting wheat\r\n    flour to the continuous action of a current of water. But it appears\r\n    that this is a mixture of fibrine and caseine, with what is now\r\n    called _glutine_, and a peculiar oily or fatty matter. Now these\r\n    substances may be separated from each other, but the processes\r\n    employed for this purpose are tedious, and to insure accuracy the\r\n    various solvents must be entirely pure--a point which, especially in\r\n    the case of alcohol and ether, is not ordinarily easy to be\r\n    attained. This will be rendered still more evident by a reference to\r\n    a French process, which will hereafter be noticed.\r\n\r\n    But were it much less difficult in every case accurately to separate\r\n    the constituents of gluten, it would not, in my opinion, be of the\r\n    least practical utility. It is to the peculiar mechanical property\r\n    of this gluten that wheat flour owes its superior power of detaining\r\n    the carbonic acid engendered by fermentation, and thus communicating\r\n    to it the vesicular spongy structure so characteristic of good\r\n    bread.[37] It may also be added, that the results of more than one\r\n    hundred trials have satisfied me that a diminution or loss of\r\n    elasticity in the gluten is the surest index of the amount of injury\r\n    which the sample of flour has sustained. Whether, therefore, the\r\n    sample contains a certain proportion of nitrogen, or whether it\r\n    contains albumen, fibrine, and caseine in sufficient quantity, it\r\n    may still want the very condition which is essential to the\r\n    manufacture of good bread. My objection, therefore, to the mere\r\n    determination, however accurate, of the proportion of nitrogen\r\n    contained in wheat flour, or of the various principles which form\r\n    the gluten, is, that it does not represent the value of the various\r\n    samples for the only use to which they are applied, viz., the making\r\n    of bread. The remarks of Mulder, the celebrated Dutch chemist, upon\r\n    the subject of manures, are so applicable to this point that I\r\n    cannot refrain from quoting them. \"It has,\" he says, \"become almost\r\n    a regular custom to determine the value of manures by the quantity\r\n    of nitrogen they yield by ultimate analysis. This method is entirely\r\n    erroneous; for it is based upon the false principle, that by\r\n    putrefaction all nitrogeneous substances are immediately converted\r\n    into ammonia, carbonic acid, and water! But these changes sometimes\r\n    require a number of years. Morphine, for example, is prepared by\r\n    allowing opium to putrefy; and the process for preparing leucin, a\r\n    substance which contains 10.72 of nitrogen, is to bring cheese into\r\n    putrefaction. Cheese, therefore, does not perhaps in a number of\r\n    years resolve itself into carbonic acid, ammonia, and water, but\r\n    produces a crystalline substance, which contains no ammonia. Hence\r\n    the proportion of nitrogen yielded by manures is not a proper\r\n    measure of their value, and therefore this mode of estimating that\r\n    value ought to be discontinued.\"[38] We infer, therefore, that the\r\n    proportion of nitrogen furnished by food of various kinds is not the\r\n    true measure of their nutritious value, and cannot for practical\r\n    purposes take the place of that process by which the amount of rough\r\n    gluten is determined.\r\n\r\n    No better illustration can be given of the uncertainty which attends\r\n    the inferences drawn from the ultimate composition, than the fact\r\n    heretofore stated in regard to hay, the nutritive value of which is\r\n    placed in the tables containing the results of these analyses, at a\r\n    figure nearly the same as that of ordinary wheat flour.[39] In the\r\n    paper on the \"Composition of Wheat,\" by M. Peligot--(\" Comptes\r\n    Rendus,\" February 5th, 1849)--to which I have already referred, the\r\n    author gives the results of the various analyses which he has made,\r\n    and details the process he adopted.\r\n\r\n    Aware of the complex and difficult nature of the examination as\r\n    conducted by him, he seems to doubt in regard to some of the results\r\n    given in his tables In the fourteen samples which he analysed, the\r\n    proportion of water ranges from 13.2 to 15.2, which is a rather\r\n    higher average than is yielded by our American samples, especially\r\n    those which have not been shipped across the Atlantic. Of the\r\n    nitrogenous matter, soluble and insoluble, the proportions range\r\n    from 9.90 per cent, to 21.50 per cent.; the former being from a\r\n    sample of very soft and white French wheat; the latter from a very\r\n    hard wheat with long grains, from Northern Africa, cultivated at\r\n    Verriéres. Another sample from Egypt yielded 20.60 per cent, of\r\n    these nitrogenous matters, both of which are very remarkable\r\n    proportions.\r\n\r\n    In describing the process for ascertaining the amount of insoluble\r\n    nitrogenous matters, this author adverts to their estimation either\r\n    by the quantity of nitrogen gas furnished, or of ammonia formed, the\r\n    last being preferred for substances, which, like wheat, contain only\r\n    a few hundredths of nitrogen. The results which he obtained by this\r\n    method were compared with those yielded by the direct extraction of\r\n    the gluten by softening the farina under a small stream of water.\r\n    \"These results,\" says he, \"differ but little from each other when we\r\n    operate upon wheat in good condition, although the gluten which we\r\n    thus obtain holds some starch and fatty matter, while the starch\r\n    which is carried away by the water contains also some gluten.\" The\r\n    loss and gain, as I have already explained, and as has been proved\r\n    by these and other comparisons, are nearly balanced, and the amount\r\n    of rough gluten will therefore afford a fair exhibit of that of the\r\n    insoluble nitrogenous matters in this grain.\r\n\r\n    The salts in the samples of wheat analysed by M. Peligot, were\r\n    either wanting or were in small proportion; while the amount of\r\n    fatty matter ranged from 1.00 to 1.80 and 1.90 per cent.\r\n\r\n    These results agree very well with those which I have obtained. But\r\n    it is probable that the proportion is liable to great variation,\r\n    inasmuch as it is inferred that the fatty matter originates from\r\n    starch through its exposure to the general deoxidising influence\r\n    which prevails in plants.[40] There are also many difficulties\r\n    attending the accurate determination of this matter, and which are\r\n    probably the cause of the higher proportion often given. It is\r\n    properly remarked by M. Peligot that the ether employed in this\r\n    process should be free from water, and that the flour ought also to\r\n    be very dry. By neglecting these precautions, we separate not only\r\n    the fatty matter, but also a certain amount of matters soluble in\r\n    the water, which is furnished as well by the wheat as by the ether.\r\n\r\n    It would not, I think, be difficult to point out some incorrect\r\n    views entertained by this chemist, and more especially those which\r\n    relate to the fatty matter. Some of his processes for the separation\r\n    of various substances, if not faulty, require so many conditions for\r\n    success as to render the results, at least in other hands,\r\n    exceedingly uncertain.\r\n\r\n    But the capital error which he has committed is that concerning the\r\n    bran, already adverted to, which he considers injurious to the\r\n    flour, chiefly in consequence of the large proportion of fatty\r\n    matter which it contains.\r\n\r\n    In regard to the soluble nitrogenous matter usually called albumen,\r\n    from its resemblance to the animal substance of the same name, I\r\n    have to remark that in my trials the proportion has been found to be\r\n    considerably less than that often given in tables of the composition\r\n    of wheat. In one sample it was found to be as low as 0.15 per cant.,\r\n    in another it did not rise above 0.20 per cent. The amount was\r\n    usually so inconsiderable, that I did not think it worth while to\r\n    retard the progress of the work by following out processes which\r\n    could add little to the utility of these investigations.\r\n\r\n    Although much time and labor have been expended upon the analyses of\r\n    the ash of plants, I have but slight confidence in the results\r\n    heretofore given. The difficulties which attend the obtaining the\r\n    ash in a proper condition, and the fact that the products of all the\r\n    organs and parts of the plants have been analysed together, must\r\n    necessarily impair the accuracy of the experiments, and render the\r\n    inferences drawn from them of uncertain value. Much, indeed I may\r\n    say almost everything, still remains to be done in this department\r\n    of agricultural chemistry.\r\n\r\n    _Weight of wheat as an index to its value_.--Much has been said in\r\n    regard to the relative weights of the bushel of wheat of different\r\n    varieties or under different modes of culture.\r\n\r\n    As ordinarily determined, this weight ranges from fifty-six to\r\n    sixty-five or sixty-six pounds, being in a few cases set down\r\n    somewhat higher. It is said also that the bushel of wheat weighs\r\n    less in some years than it does in others, and that the difference\r\n    often amounts to two, or three, or even four pounds. Though this may\r\n    seem of comparatively little consequence for a few bushels, yet, for\r\n    the aggegate of the wheat crop of the United States, or for a State,\r\n    or even a county, it makes a great difference. Thus, were we to\r\n    estimate the product of one year in the United States at one hundred\r\n    and ten million bushels, weighing fifty-six pounds to the bushel,\r\n    and another year at one hundred and eight million bushels, weighing\r\n    sixty-two pounds, the difference in favor of the latter, though the\r\n    least in quantity, would amount to five hundred and thirty-six\r\n    million pounds in weight, or more than one million and a quarter of\r\n    barrels of flour.--(Report of the American Commissioner of Patents\r\n    for 1847, p. 117.)\r\n\r\n    It may be remarked, however, that it is not after all so easy to\r\n    determine with accuracy the weight of a bushel of wheat, nor to\r\n    decide upon the circumstances which have an influence in increasing\r\n    the density of a grain of wheat. If the microscopical\r\n    representations of wheat are to be relied on, it is probable that\r\n    the increase in the density of wheat depends upon the increase in\r\n    the proportion of gluten. I have found in several cases that, the\r\n    proportion of water being the same, those samples of wheat which\r\n    contain the largest proportion of gluten exhibit the highest\r\n    specific gravity, or, in other words, will yield the greatest number\r\n    of pounds to the bushel. But the weight of wheat will be influenced\r\n    by the proportion of water which it contains; the drier the grain,\r\n    the greater is its density; a fact which may account for the\r\n    difference which has been observed in the weight of wheat in\r\n    different seasons. If this is the cause, the calculation above given\r\n    in reference to the United States is fallacious--but if the amount\r\n    of gluten is _actually_, instead of _relatively_, increased by\r\n    peculiarities in seasons, it is no doubt correct.\r\n\r\n    I have devised a series of experiments to test the accuracy of the\r\n    statements made upon this point, but have not yet had leisure to\r\n    complete them.\r\n\r\n    _General conditions from the analyses of wheat flour_.--The large\r\n    number of analyses which I have made, and the uniformity of the\r\n    processes pursued, enable me to draw some general conclusions which\r\n    it may be useful to present in a connected form.\r\n\r\n    1. In the samples from the more northern wheat-growing States, there\r\n    seems to be little difference in the proportion of nutritive matter\r\n    that can be set down to the influence of climate. Thus, the yield of\r\n    the wheat from Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa, is scarcely inferior to\r\n    that from New York, Indiana, and Illinois, although the two latter\r\n    are somewhat farther south. Local causes, and more especially the\r\n    peculiarities of culture and manufacture, have more influence,\r\n    within these parallels of latitude, than the difference of mean\r\n    temperature.\r\n\r\n    2. The samples from New Jersey, Lower Pennsylvania, the southern\r\n    part of Ohio, Maryland (probably Delaware), Virginia, the Carolinas,\r\n    and Georgia,[41] contain less water and more nutritive matter than\r\n    those from the States previously enumerated. That the samples from\r\n    Missouri, which is included within nearly the same parallels of\r\n    latitude as Virginia, do not exhibit so high an average of nutritive\r\n    matter as those from the latter State, must be ascribed principally\r\n    to a want of care in the management of the crop, and perhaps also in\r\n    the manufacture of the flour. Virginia flour, for obvious reasons,\r\n    maintains a high reputation for shipment.\r\n\r\n    3. The difference in the nutritive value of the various samples of\r\n    wheat depends greatly upon the variety, and mode of culture,\r\n    independently of climate. The correctness of the former statement is\r\n    shown by the much larger proportions of gluten yielded by many of\r\n    the samples of _hard_ wheat from abroad, the Oregon wheat in\r\n    Virginia, and a variety of Illinois wheat, &c. And in regard to the\r\n    effect of particular modes of culture, the various analyses of\r\n    Boussingault may be referred to, and that in my table of a sample\r\n    from Ulster county, New York.\r\n\r\n    4. The deterioration of many of the samples of wheat and wheat flour\r\n    arises in most cases from the presence of a too large per centage of\r\n    water. This is often the result of a want of proper care in the\r\n    transport, and is the principal cause of the losses which are\r\n    sustained by those who are engaged in this branch of business.\r\n\r\n    5. There seems to be little doubt that a considerable portion of the\r\n    wheat and wheat flour, as well as of other breadstuffs, shipped from\r\n    this country to England, is more or less injured before it reaches\r\n    that market. It is also shown that this is mostly to be ascribed to\r\n    the want of care above noticed, and to the fraudulent mixture of\r\n    good and bad kinds. The remedy in the former case is the drying of\r\n    the grain or flour before shipment, by some of the modes proposed,\r\n    and the protection of it afterwards as completely as possible from\r\n    the effect of moisture. The frauds which are occasionally practised\r\n    should be promptly exposed, and those who are engaged in them held\r\n    up to merited reproach.\r\n\r\n    6. It has been fully shown, by the results of many trials, that the\r\n    flour obtained by the second grinding of wheat, or the whole meal,\r\n    contains more gluten than the fine flour. Hence the general use of\r\n    the latter, and the entire rejection of the bran, is wasteful, and\r\n    ought in every way to be discouraged.\r\n\r\n    7. It cannot but be gratifying to us that the average nutritive\r\n    value of the wheat and wheat flour of the United States is shown by\r\n    these analyses to be fully equal to, if not greater than, that\r\n    afforded by the samples produced in any other part of the world. And\r\n    it will, in my opinion, be chiefly owing to a want of proper care\r\n    and of commercial honesty, if the great advantages which should\r\n    accrue to this country from the export of these articles are either\r\n    endangered or entirely lost.\r\n\r\n    TABLE EXHIBITING THE PER CENTAGE COMPOSITION OF VARIOUS SAMPLES OF\r\n     AMERICAN AND FOREIGN WHEAT FLOUR, BY LEWIS C.

To grow this grain on fresh land,\r\n    adapted to the peculiar habits and wants of the plant is an easy\r\n    task. But such fields, except in rare instances, fail sooner or\r\n    later to produce sound and healthy plants, which are little liable\r\n    to attacks from the malady called \"rust,\" or which give lengthened\r\n    ears or \"heads,\" well filled with plump seeds.\r\n\r\n    Having long resided in the best wheat-growing district in the Union,\r\n    the writer has devoted years of study and observation to all the\r\n    influences of soil, climate, and constitutional peculiarities, which\r\n    affect this bread-bearing plant. It is far more liable to smut,\r\n    rust, and shrink in some soils than in others. This is true in\r\n    western New York, and every other section where wheat has long been\r\n    cultivated. As the alkalies and other fertilizing elements become\r\n    exhausted in the virgin soils of America, its crops of wheat not\r\n    only become smaller on an average, but the plants fail in\r\n    constitutional vigor, and are more liable to diseases and attacks\r\n    from parasites and destructive insects. Defects in soil and improper\r\n    nutrition lead to these disastrous results. Soils are defective in\r\n    the following particulars:\r\n\r\n    1. They lack soluble silica, or flint in an available form, with\r\n    which to produce a hard glassy stem that will be little subject to\r\n    \"rust.\" Soluble flint is never very abundant in cultivated soils;\r\n    and after they have been tilled some years, the supply is deficient\r\n    in quantity. It is not very difficult to learn with considerable\r\n    accuracy the amount of silica which rain-water as it falls on the\r\n    earth will dissolve out of 1,000 grains of soil in the course of\r\n    eight or ten days. Hot water will dissolve more than cold; and water\r\n    charged with carbonic acid more than pure water which has been\r\n    boiled. The experiments of Prof. Rogers of the University of\r\n    Virginia, as published in Silliman's Journal, have a direct bearing\r\n    on this subject. The researches of Prof. Emmons of Albany, in his\r\n    elaborate and valuable work on \"Agriculture,\" as a part of the\r\n    Natural History of New York, show that 10,000 parts of soil yield\r\n    only from one to three parts of soluble silica. The analyses of Dr\r\n    Jackson, as published in his Geological Survey of New Hampshire,\r\n    give similar results. Earth taken from an old and badly exhausted\r\n    field in Georgia, gave the writer only one part of soluble flint in\r\n    100,000.\r\n\r\n    What elements of crops rain water, at summer heat, will dissolve out\r\n    of ten or twenty pounds of soil, in the course of three months, is a\r\n    point in agricultural science which should be made the subject of\r\n    numerous and rigid experiments. In this way, the capabilities of\r\n    different soils and their adaptation to different crops may be\r\n    tested, in connection with practical experiments in field culture,\r\n    on the same kind of earth.\r\n\r\n    Few wheat-growers are aware how much dissolved flint an acre of good\r\n    wheat demands to prevent its having coarse, soft, and spongy stems,\r\n    which are anything but a healthy organization of the plant. In the\r\n    Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England, vol. 7, there\r\n    is an extended \"Report on the Analysis of the Ashes of Plants, by\r\n    Thomas Way, Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Agricultural\r\n    College, Cirencester,\" which gives the result of sixty-two analyses\r\n    of the ash of wheat, from as many samples of that grain, mostly\r\n    grown on different soils and under different circumstances.\r\n\r\n    In this report are given the quantity of wheat per acre, the weight\r\n    of straw cut close to the ground to the acre, and also that of the\r\n    chaff. These researches show, that from ninety-three to one hundred\r\n    and fifty pounds of soluble flint are required to form an acre of\r\n    wheat; and I will add from my own investigations, that three-fourths\r\n    of this silica is demanded by nature during the last sixty days\r\n    preceding the maturing of the crop. This is the period in which the\r\n    stem acquires its solidity and strength, and most of its\r\n    incombustible earthy matter. The quantity of this varies from three\r\n    to fifteen per cent. of the weight of the straw. Prof. Johnston and\r\n    Sir Humphry Davy give instances in which more than fifteen per cent.\r\n    of ash was found; and Prof. Way gives cases where less than three\r\n    per cent. were obtained. The mean of forty samples was four and a\r\n    half per cent. Dr. Sprengel gives three and a half as the mean of\r\n    his analyses. M. Boussingault found an average of seven per cent. As\r\n    flint is truly the _bone_ of all the grass family, imparting to them\r\n    strength, as in cane, timothy, corn, oats, rye, rice, millet, and\r\n    the proportion of this mineral varies as much in wheat-straw, as\r\n    bone does in very lean and very fat hogs or cattle.\r\n\r\n    A young growing animal, whether a child or a colt, that is kept on\r\n    food which lacks _bone-earth_, (phosphate of lime,) will have soft\r\n    cartilaginous bones. Nature cannot substitute _iron_ or any other\r\n    mineral in the animal system, out of which to form hard strong\r\n    bones; nor can any other mineral in the soil perform the peculiar\r\n    function assigned to silica in the vital economy of cereal plants.\r\n    To protect the living germs in the seeds of wheat, corn, oats, rye,\r\n    barley, &c, the cuticle or bran of these seeds contains considerable\r\n    flint. The same is true of chaff.\r\n\r\n    The question naturally arises,--How is the farmer to increase the\r\n    quantity of soluble silica or flint in his soil? This is a question\r\n    of the highest practical importance. There are three principal ways\r\n    in which the object named may be attained. First, by keeping fewer\r\n    acres under the plough. Land in pasture, if well managed, will gain\r\n    its fertility, and in the process accumulate soluble silica in the\r\n    surface soil. In this way more wheat and surer crops may be made by\r\n    cultivating a field in wheat two years than four or six. If the\r\n    field in the mean time be devoted to wool-growing, butter or\r\n    cheese-making, or to stock-raising, particular care must be taken to\r\n    make great crops of grass or clover to grow on the land, and have\r\n    all the manure, both solid and liquid, applied to its surface.\r\n\r\n    There are many counties in England that yield an average of\r\n    thirty-two bushels of wheat per acre for ten crops in succession.\r\n    There are but few of the old counties in the United States which\r\n    average the half of that quantity: and yet America has greater\r\n    agricultural capabilities than that of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n    Another way to increase soluble silica in the soil, is to grow such\r\n    crops, in rotation with wheat culture, as will best prevent the loss\r\n    of dissolved flint, at any time by leaching and washing, through the\r\n    agency of rain water. This remark is intended to apply more\r\n    particularly to those large districts devoted to cotton and tobacco\r\n    culture, plants that take up no considerable amount of silica, and\r\n    which by the constant stirring of the earth, and the clean tillage\r\n    which they demand, favor the leaching of the soil. To keep too much\r\n    of a plantation of these crops, is to lessen its capabilities for\r\n    producing good crops of corn, wheat, and barley, at a small expense.\r\n    Corn plants, well managed, will extract more pounds of silica in\r\n    three or six months from the soil, than any other. As not an ounce\r\n    of this mineral is needed in the animal economy of man or beast, it\r\n    can all be composted in cornstalks, blades, and cobs, or in the dung\r\n    and urine derived from corn, and be finally reorganized in the stems\r\n    of wheat plants. Corn culture and wheat culture, if skilfully and\r\n    scientifically conducted, go admirably together. Of the two, more\r\n    bread, more meat, and more _money_ can be made from the corn than\r\n    from the wheat plant in this country. But so soon as what is called\r\n    \"high farming\" in England, shall be popular in the United States,\r\n    the crops both of wheat and corn grown here will demonstrate how\r\n    little we appreciate the vast superiority of our climate for the\r\n    economical feeding and clothing of the human family, over that of\r\n    our \"mother country.\" In several counties in England, it takes from\r\n    twelve to fourteen months to make a crop of wheat, after the seed is\r\n    put into the ground. At or near the first of December, 1847, Mr.\r\n    M.B. Moore, of Augusta, Ga., sowed a bushel of seed wheat on an acre\r\n    and a half of ground, which gave him over thirty bushels by the\r\n    middle of May following. This ground was then ploughed, and a fine\r\n    crop of hay made and cut in July. After this, a good crop of peas\r\n    was raised, and harvested in October, before it was time to seed\r\n    with wheat again, as was done. While the mean temperature of England\r\n    is so low, that corn plants will not ripen, in Georgia one can grow\r\n    a crop of wheat in the winter, and nearly two crops of corn in\r\n    succession in the summer and autumn, before it is time to sow wheat\r\n    again. No writer, to my knowledge, has done full justice to the vast\r\n    agricultural resources of the southern portion of the American\r\n    confederacy. But there is much of its soil which is not rich in the\r\n    elements of bread. Nothing but the careful study of these elements,\r\n    and of the natural laws by which they are governed, can remedy\r\n    defects in wheat culture anywhere, but especially on very poor land.\r\n\r\n    All alkaline minerals, such as potash, soda, lime, ammonia, and\r\n    magnesia, hasten the solution of the several insoluble compounds of\r\n    silica in the soil. This fact should be remembered by every farmer.\r\n    To undertake an explanation of the various ways in which alkalies,\r\n    oxides, and acids act and re-act upon each other in the surface of\r\n    the earth, when subject to tillage, would be out of place in this\r\n    outline view of wheat-growing in the United States. I may state the\r\n    fact, however, as ascertained by many analyses, that a cubic foot of\r\n    good wheat soil in the valley of the Genesee, contains twenty times\r\n    more lime than do the poorest soils in South Carolina and Georgia.\r\n    The quantity of gypsum, bone-earth, and magnesia, available as food\r\n    for plants, varies in an equal degree. Not only lime, but phosphoric\r\n    acid, potash, and magnesia are lacking in most soils, if one desires\r\n    to raise a large crop of wheat, and have the seeds of the grain\r\n    weigh as much as the straw. In a number of the specimens of wheat\r\n    analyzed by Prof. Way, when cut close to the roots, the dry wheat\r\n    outweighed the dry straw.\r\n\r\n    Having secured the growth of a bright, hard, glassy stem, the next\r\n    thing is to develop a long, well-filled ear. To this end, available\r\n    ammonia or nitrogen, phosphorus, potash, and magnesia are\r\n    indispensable. Ammonia (spirits of hartshorn) is necessary to aid in\r\n    forming the combustible part of the seed. The other ingredients\r\n    named are required to assist in making the incombustible part of the\r\n    grain. In 100 parts of the ash of wheat, there are the following\r\n    substances,  viz.:--\r\n\r\n  Silica                       2.28\r\n  Phosphoric acid             45.73\r\n  Sulphuric acid               0.32\r\n  Lime                         2.06\r\n  Magnesia                    10.94\r\n  Peroxide of iron             2.04\r\n  Potash                      32.24\r\n  Soda                         4.06\r\n  Chloride of sodium           0.27\r\n                              -----\r\n  Total                       99.94\r\n\r\n    The quantity of ash in wheat varies from 1¼ to 2½ per cent.; the\r\n    average is about 1.69. The amount of phosphoric acid in any given\r\n    quantity of the ash of wheat varies from forty to fifty per cent. of\r\n    the same.\r\n\r\n    Seeds that have a thick cuticle or bran, and little gluten, contain\r\n    a smaller per centage of phosphoric acid, and more silica. About\r\n    one-third of the ash is potash; in nearly all cases magnesia varies\r\n    from nine to fourteen per cent.; lime from one and a half to six per\r\n    cent. Peroxide of iron is seldom as abundant as in the ash above\r\n    given, and the same is true of soda. Chloride of sodium is common\r\n    salt, and exists in a small quantity. Salt is beginning to be much\r\n    used as a fertilizer on wheat lands in western New York. It operates\r\n    indirectly to increase the crop.\r\n\r\n    The following may be taken as about the average composition of the\r\n    ash of wheat-straw.

As the stems and leaves of wheat\r\n    plants grow before their seeds, if all the phosphoric acid, potash,\r\n    and lime available in the soil is consumed before the organization\r\n    of the seeds begin, from what source is nature to draw her supply of\r\n    these ingredients to form a good crop of wheat? If the farmer could\r\n    reverse the order of nature, and grow a good supply of seeds first,\r\n    and make straw afterwards, then many a one would harvest more wheat\r\n    and less straw. But the cultivator must grow the stems, roots, and\r\n    leaves of wheat, corn, and cotton, before nature will begin to form\r\n    the seeds of these several plants: and every one should know that\r\n    the atoms in the soil, which are consumed in organizing the bodies\r\n    of cultivated plants, are, in the main, identical in kind with those\r\n    required to make their seeds. The proportions, however, differ very\r\n    considerably. Thus, while 100 parts of the ash of wheat contain an\r\n    average of 45 parts of phosphoric acid, 100 of the ash of the wheat\r\n    straw contain an average of only 5 parts. The difference is as 9 to\r\n    1. In magnesia the disparity is only a little less striking.\r\n\r\n    In what are called the organic elements of wheat (the combustible\r\n    part) there are seven times more nitrogen in 100 pounds than in a\r\n    like weight of straw. Hence, if the farmer converts straw into\r\n    manure or compost, with the view ultimately of transforming it into\r\n    wheat, it will take 7 pounds of straw to yield nitrogen enough to\r\n    form one pound of wheat. Few are aware how much labor and money is\r\n    annually lost by the feeding of plants on food not strictly adapted\r\n    to the peculiar wants of nature in organizing the same. It is true,\r\n    that most farmers depend on the natural fertility of the soil to\r\n    nourish their crops, with perhaps the aid of a little stable and\r\n    barn-yard manure, given to a part of them. As the natural resources\r\n    of the land begin to fail, the supply must be drawn from other\r\n    quarters than an exhausted field, or its cultivator will receive a\r\n    poor return for the labor bestowed.\r\n\r\n    In Great Britain, where the necessity for liberal harvests and\r\n    artificial fertilizing is far greater than in this country, the\r\n    yield of wheat is said to be governed in a good degree by the amount\r\n    of ammonia available as food for growing plants. This opinion is\r\n    founded not at all on theory, but altogether on the teachings of\r\n    experience. But in England, limeing and manuring are so much matters\r\n    of constant practice, that few soils are so improverished as many\r\n    are in the United States, With land as naked and sterile as is much\r\n    that can be found in the whole thirteen colonies between Maine and\r\n    Alabama, English farmers could hardly pay their tithes and poor\r\n    rates, to say nothing of other taxes, rent, and the coat of\r\n    producing their annual crops.\r\n\r\n    The first step towards making farming permanently profitable in all\r\n    the older States, is to accumulate in a cheap and skilful manner the\r\n    raw material for good harvests in the soil.\r\n\r\n    Over a territory so extensive as the United States, it is extremely\r\n    difficult to lay down any rule that will be applicable even to a\r\n    moiety of the republic. There are, however, many beds of marl,\r\n    greensand, gypsum, limestone, saline and vegetable deposits\r\n    available for the improvement of farming lands, in the Union. In\r\n    addition to these, there are extraneous resources, the ocean with\r\n    its fish, its shells, its sea-weeds, and its fertilizing salts,\r\n    which will yield an incalculable amount of bread and meat. In the\r\n    subsoil and the atmosphere, every agriculturist has resources which\r\n    are not duly appreciated by one in a thousand.\r\n\r\n    As a general rule, the soil must be _deepened_ before it can be\r\n    permanently improved. One acre of soil 12 inches deep is worth more\r\n    to make money from, by cultivating it, than four acres 6 inches in\r\n    depth. Thus, admit that a soil 6 inches deep will produce 14 bushels\r\n    of wheat, and that 12 bushels will pay all expenses and give 2 for\r\n    profit. Four acres of this land will yield a net income of only 8\r\n    bushels. Now double the depth of the soil and the crop: making the\r\n    latter 28 bushels, instead of 14 per acre, and the former 12 inches\r\n    deep, in the place of 6. Fifteen bushels instead of twelve, will now\r\n    pay all annual expenses, and leave a net profit not of _two_ but of\r\n    _thirteen_ bushels per acre. If small crops will pay expenses, large\r\n    ones will make a fortune; provided the farmer knows how to enrich\r\n    his land in the most economical way. It is quite as easy to pay too\r\n    dear for improving lands, as to lose money at any other business\r\n    whatever.\r\n\r\n    The first thing for the operator to do is to acquire all the\r\n    knowledge within his reach, from the experience of others who have\r\n    done for their soils what he proposes to accomplish for his. Twenty\r\n    or fifty dollars, invested in the best agricultural works in the\r\n    English language, may save him thousands in the end, and double his\r\n    profits in two years. The Agricultural Journals of the United States\r\n    abound in information most useful to the practical farmer: and the\r\n    back volumes, if collected and bound, will form a library of great\r\n    value.\r\n\r\n    _Rotation of Crops in connexion with Wheat Culture_.--A system of\r\n    tillage and rotation which will pay best in one locality, or on one\r\n    quality of soil, and in a particular climate, will be found not at\r\n    all adapted to other localities, different soils and latitudes.\r\n    Hence, no rule can be laid down that will meet the peculiar\r\n    exigencies of a farming country so extensive as the thirty States\r\n    east of the Rocky Mountains. There are soils in Western New York,\r\n    known to the writer, which have borne good crops of wheat every\r\n    other year for more than twenty years, and produce better now than\r\n    at the beginning of their cultivation. The resources of the earth in\r\n    supplying the elements of wheat and corn are extremely variable.\r\n    There are friable shaley rocks in Livingstone county, N.Y., which\r\n    crumble and slake when exposed to the air, that abound in all the\r\n    earthy minerals necessary to form good wheat. These rocks are\r\n    hundreds of feet in thickness, and have furnished much of the soil\r\n    in the valley of the Genesee. The Onondaga Salt Group, and other\r\n    contiguous strata, which extend into Canada West, form soils of\r\n    extraordinary capacity for growing wheat. Indeed, the rocks and\r\n    \"drift\" of a district give character to its arable surface.\r\n\r\n    Nothing is more needed at this time than a good geological map of\r\n    the United States, accompanied by an accurate and popularly arranged\r\n    work on agricultural geology. The writer had hoped to give such a\r\n    map in this report; but it is thought best to devote another year to\r\n    the collection of geological surveys and facts, and to the making of\r\n    more critical and extended researches before publishing.\r\n\r\n    In the matter of rotation of crops in connection with wheat culture,\r\n    clover and corn are generally preferred in all the Northern, and\r\n    most of the Middle States. In New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania,\r\n    Michigan, Wisconsin, Northern Indiana, and Illinois, so far as the\r\n    writer is acquainted, a crop of wheat is made in rotation, either\r\n    every third, fourth, or fifth year. Wherever wool growing is united\r\n    with wheat culture, clover and wheat are the staple crops of the\r\n    farm. Wool and superfine flour are exported; farmers taking nearly\r\n    all the bran and shorts of the millers who purchase their wheat.\r\n\r\n    The offal of wheat makes not a little feed with chaff and cut straw.\r\n    Many agriculturists grow peas, beans, turnips, beets, and carrots in\r\n    large quantities, as well as clover, corn, oats, and barley. Peas\r\n    and beans, both stems and pulse, when well cured, are excellent feed\r\n    for sheep; and on good land they are easily grown. They prepare the\r\n    soil well for wheat.\r\n\r\n    All the manure derived from sheep is husbanded with extreme care by\r\n    the farmers who are gradually enriching their lands. On a deep,\r\n    rich, arable soil, quite a number of sheep may be kept per acre, if\r\n    highly cultivated; and their manure prepares the land for producing\r\n    generous crops of wheat at a small expense. Of all business men,\r\n    farmers should be the closest calculators of _profit_ and _loss_.\r\n\r\n    Great care should be taken to sow good and clean seed on clean land.\r\n    Previous to putting the seed in the ground (drilling is preferable\r\n    to sowing broadcast), wheat should be soaked five or six hours--not\r\n    longer--in strong brine. After this, add a peck or more of recently\r\n    slaked lime to each bushel, and shovel it over well, that the lime\r\n    may cover each seed. It is now ready to commit to the earth. Most\r\n    good farmers roll the earth after seeding: some before.\r\n\r\n    In the Southern States, planters are in the habit of permitting\r\n    their wheat to remain too long in the field after it is cradled, and\r\n    in small shocks. Good barns are too scarce in all the planting\r\n    States, and in some others.\r\n\r\n    _Summer fallowing_ is generally abandoned, except in cases where old\r\n    pastures and meadows, new prairie, or bushy bad fields are to be\r\n    subdued. As a general rule, friable soils need not be ploughed long\r\n    before the intended crop is expected to begin to grow. Among\r\n    fertilizers, wood ashes, salt, bones, lime, guano, and poudrette\r\n    have been used in wheat culture with decided advantage. In Great\r\n    Britain, manure derived from the consumption of turnips and other\r\n    root crops by sheep and neat cattle, is much used in preparing land\r\n    for wheat. Sheep, clover and peas, corn and hogs, rotate well to\r\n    insure the economical production of this staple. Manure is usually\r\n    applied to the crop preceding wheat.\r\n\r\n    It may be interesting to some readers to see in this place the mean\r\n    result of several organic analyses of wheat made by M. Boussingault.\r\n    Wheat, dried at 230 deg. _in vacuo_, was found to contain:\r\n\r\n  Carbon          46.1\r\n  Oxygen          43.4\r\n  Hydrogen         5.8\r\n  Nitrogen         2.3\r\n  Ash              2.4\r\n                 -----\r\n  Total          100.0\r\n\r\n    Charcoal may be regarded as a fair representative of carbon, and\r\n    water as the representative of both oxygen and hydrogen. It will be\r\n    seen by the above figures, that over 95 per cent. of wheat is made\r\n    up of elements which greatly abound in nature in an available\r\n    condition; and the same is true of all other plants. It is doubtless\r\n    owing to this circumstance, that a comparatively small quantity of\r\n    guano and other highly concentrated fertilizers are able to produce\r\n    crops five, ten, and fifty times greater than their own weight.\r\n    Azote, or nitrogen, in the form of ammonia, or nitric acid, (aqua\r\n    fortis), and the incombustible part of plants are the elements which\r\n    least abound in soils, and should be husbanded with the greatest\r\n    care.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. C.P. Holcomb, of Delaware, furnishes some interesting remarks\r\non the wheat crop of the United States:--\r\n\r\n    A short wheat crop in England, Mr. Webster says, affects the\r\n    exchanges of the civilized world. In the vast increase of population\r\n    in the absence of long wars and famines, the importance of this\r\n    staple is constantly increasing. Its cultivation is the most\r\n    attractive and pleasant of all descriptions of husbandry; and its\r\n    rewards are generally remunerating, when the soil and climate are\r\n    favorable, and the markets are not too distant.\r\n\r\n    It is important to know what our relation is to this staple of the\r\n    world, and what is, and what is likely to be, our contribution to\r\n    the great aggregate of production. Beyond feeding our own great and\r\n    rapidly increasing population, it probably will not soon, if ever,\r\n    be very great. It is a mistake, I apprehend, to suppose our country\r\n    is naturally a great wheat-producing country. The wheat district at\r\n    present, in comparison to the whole extent of our territory, is\r\n    limited. It is confined, so far as any appreciable amount is grown,\r\n    to about ten degrees of latitude and twenty degrees of longitude,\r\n    and embracing about one half the number of the States. The crop of\r\n    1848 is estimated by the Commissioner of Patents at one hundred and\r\n    twenty-six millions, and our population at twenty-two millions. This\r\n    gives a less number of bushels, per head, to our population than the\r\n    consumption of Great Britain, which is generally set down at one\r\n    hundred and sixty millions, or six bushels to each inhabitant. But\r\n    with us Indian corn is a great substitute; so are potatoes and oats\r\n    in Ireland and Scotland. Still our consumption of wheat, including\r\n    the black population, is undoubtedly less, per head, than theirs.\r\n    But in the absence of any certain data, to ascertain either the\r\n    actual production, or our consumption, our only safe course is to\r\n    take the actual excess, or the amount exported, after supplying our\r\n    own wants. This, for the fiscal year 1848, being the crop of 1847,\r\n    amounted, in flour and wheat, to twelve millions two hundred and\r\n    ninety-four thousand one hundred and seventy-five bushels, although\r\n    Mr. Burke's figures would show a surplus of some forty millions!\r\n    That there was not, and never has been any such surplus in the\r\n    country is very evident, for the foreign demand was all the time\r\n    good, and drew away all we had to part with.\r\n\r\n    The crop of 1848 was, undoubtedly, one of the best and largest we\r\n    have ever grown; yet I have ascertained, by application at the\r\n    registrar's office, that the exports for the fiscal year 1842,\r\n    amounted in wheat to but 1,527,534 bushels, and in flour to\r\n    2,108,013 barrels, or less by 226,676 bushels than the exports of\r\n    1848. Twelve millions is comparatively a small surplus in a\r\n    favorable season, for a country with a population of twenty-two\r\n    millions of inhabitants. The loss of a small per cent. in an\r\n    unfavorable season would at once sink this excess.\r\n\r\n    Let us now notice more in detail the different sections of our\r\n    country as adapted to the growth of wheat.\r\n\r\n    The New England States, some of them aided in their recent\r\n    enterprises by bounties offered by the state governments, have\r\n    failed to insure such success as is likely to encourage them to\r\n    continue the culture of wheat; or, at all events, to induce them to\r\n    aim at increasing their product to any considerable extent, since,\r\n    as one of their own farmers candidly states, \"the attempt to grow a\r\n    crop of wheat is an experiment.\"\r\n\r\n    The States south of North Carolina, and inclusive of a part of\r\n    Delaware, have never heretofore succeeded in growing wheat to any\r\n    considerable extent, though there were periods in their\r\n    history--before the general introduction of the culture of\r\n    cotton--when, if it had been practicable to make the cereal one of\r\n    their staples, they would certainly have done so. Besides the common\r\n    dangers from rust and blight, the fly, and sometimes the frost--as\r\n    the past season--they have a most formidable enemy in the weevil. In\r\n    Upper Georgia, in the Cherokee country in particular, wheat will\r\n    probably be cultivated to some extent, and a limited cultivation of\r\n    it by the planters for their own use will probably continue in\r\n    several of the southern states. But the cotton, rice, and sugar\r\n    states, like the manufacturing states of New England, will not soon,\r\n    if ever, add much to the supply of wheat; the rich staples of the\r\n    former, and the varied husbandry and grazing of the latter, suited\r\n    to supply the immediate wants of a manufacturing population, will be\r\n    likely to receive their attention in preference.\r\n\r\n    Kentucky and Tennessee, though their agricultural history dates back\r\n    beyond the settlement of the north-western states, have already been\r\n    out-stripped by at least two of them. In neither of these states has\r\n    the culture of wheat ever been put forward, and regarded as one of\r\n    their best staples, or as very favorably adapted to their soil and\r\n    climate. Still, notwithstanding the formidable danger from rust, the\r\n    production of Tennessee is estimated to be equal to nine bushels to\r\n    each person, and Kentucky about seven and a half bushels. Missouri\r\n    may be classed with Kentucky and Tennessee, which she much resembles\r\n    in soil, climate, and productions, except that she raises much less\r\n    wheat than either, her crop being placed by the Commissioner of\r\n    Patents at only two millions, or less than four bushels to each\r\n    resident of the state. But, besides that the experience of the past\r\n    discourages the idea that these fine states are likely to become\r\n    great wheat-producing states, the fact that the staple of cotton may\r\n    be cultivated over a considerable portion of one of them, and that\r\n    hemp and tobacco are among the valuable products of the other two;\r\n    that Tennessee is the very largest corn-producing state in the\r\n    Union, showing her soil and climate are particularly adapted to this\r\n    description of grain, and that Kentucky and Missouri are unsurpassed\r\n    as grazing countries, and there is little ground to suppose that any\r\n    change in their husbandry will very greatly or suddenly augment the\r\n    production of wheat. Let us come now to the States of Indiana,\r\n    Illinois, Wisconsin, and Iowa, and that _fabulous_ wheat district or\r\n    territory to the west of these again, from which, according to the\r\n    vaticinations of some, may be drawn supplies of wheat to feed the\r\n    population of both Europe and America, or fill warehouses that would\r\n    sustain our people through a longer famine than that which afflicted\r\n    the people of Egypt! I cannot help thinking that, to some extent,\r\n    this generally fertile district of country has, so far as the\r\n    production of wheat is concerned, been \"shouted forth in\r\n    acclamations hyperbolical.\" My own impression in regard to it is,\r\n    including the states last named, derived in part from observation,\r\n    from intercourse and correspondence with intelligent agriculturists\r\n    of these states, and from a careful examination of a geological\r\n    survey of two of them, that the soil and climate of this whole\r\n    district of country are _not_ particularly favorable to the\r\n    production of wheat. The popular idea I know to be otherwise. I am\r\n    not going to dwell upon it, or to examine the subject at any length.\r\n    There is a single remark that may help to explain the reputation\r\n    that has gone abroad in reference to the wheat-producing qualities\r\n    of these lands. The prairie sod, when first broken up, generally\r\n    produces wheat well, often most abundantly, provided it escapes the\r\n    rust, insect, &c. But, when this ground has been much furrowed,\r\n    becomes completely pulverized by exposure to the atmosphere, the\r\n    light and friable mould, of which most of it is composed, drenched,\r\n    as a good deal of it is, at times, with surface water, fails to hold\r\n    or sustain the roots of the plant, it is thrown out, or\r\n    winter-killed; and \"winter-killed,\" \"winter-killed,\"\r\n    \"winter-killed,\" we all know, is among the catalogue of disasters\r\n    that almost annually reach us. Sometimes, when escaping the winter,\r\n    the high winds of spring blow this light soil from the roots,\r\n    exposing them to such an extent, that, in a dry time in particular,\r\n    the wheat often perishes. When breaking up fresh prairies, there was\r\n    much encouragement and promise of hope, but which, I believe, has\r\n    not been, nor is likely to be, realized by their husbandmen, in the\r\n    degree that early experiments induced them to look for.\r\n\r\n    As appears by the last report of the Commissioner of Patents, the\r\n    crop of Illinois, in reference to population and production, is\r\n    below that of Kentucky, and both Indiana and Illinois are below that\r\n    of Tennessee. The crop of Indiana is set down at 8,300,000, her\r\n    population at 1,000,000, or equal to 8½ bushels a-head. The\r\n    production of Illinois is stated at 5,400,000, her population at\r\n    800,000, or less than seven bushels to each inhabitant--and both\r\n    these \"fair and fertile plains\" are still farther behind the old\r\n    \"battered moors\" of Maryland and Virginia.\r\n\r\n    Much of their wheat, too, is spring wheat, sown often on land where\r\n    the fall crop had winter-killed, increasing the number of bushels\r\n    much more than the value of the crop. I have heard it estimated\r\n    that full one-third of all the wheat shipped from Chicago was of\r\n    this description. Chicago is their great wheat depot. Several\r\n    millions of bushels are shipped from this point, _the contributions\r\n    from parts of three States_, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Illinois; and\r\n    which concentration of their joint product at this new western city,\r\n    or something else, seems to have imparted to each and all these\r\n    states the reputation of great wheat-growing states, though they\r\n    are, in fact, with the advantage of a virgin soil, behind several of\r\n    the western states, and two at least of the eastern or Atlantic\r\n    States. The geological explorations of the Hon. Robert Dale Owen,\r\n    undertaken under the authority of Congress, throws much light on the\r\n    character of the soil of Wisconsin and Iowa, and the description\r\n    given undoubtedly characterizes much of that region of country. The\r\n    specific gravity of the soil, Mr. Owen states to be remarkably\r\n    _light_; but what he represents to be a \"striking feature in the\r\n    character of the Iowa and Wisconsin soils, is the _entire absence,\r\n    in the most of the specimens of clay, and in a large proportion of\r\n    silex_.\" Again, he speaks of their being particularly adapted to the\r\n    growth of the sugar-beet, which he truly says, \"flourishes best in a\r\n    _loose fertile mould_.\" Again, he detected no phosphates; but they\r\n    might be there, as the _virgin_ soil produced good wheat. So does\r\n    the virgin soil of most of the prairie land.--\"The soil was rich in\r\n    geine,\" &c. But I submit that this does not describe a wheat soil,\r\n    hardly in any one particular. Liebig tells us, that \"however great\r\n    the proportion of _humus_ in a soil, it does not necessarily follow\r\n    it will produce wheat\"--and cites the country of Brazil.\r\n\r\n    Again, he adds, \"how does it happen that wheat does not flourish on\r\n    a sandy soil (which much of the soil of these states is described to\r\n    be), and that a calcareous soil is also unsuitable to its growth,\r\n    unless it be mixed with a considerable quantity of clay?\"\r\n\r\n    The late Mr. Colman, in his _European Agriculture_, states, that\r\n    \"the soil preferred for wheat (in England) is a strong soil with a\r\n    large proportion of clay. But the question after all is, not whether\r\n    these States cannot grow wheat, and in comparatively large\r\n    quantities, for we know that while their lands are fresh, they can\r\n    and do--but whether, considering the hazard of the crop from\r\n    winter-killing, the rust, the fly--the risk from the two former\r\n    being equal to a large per cent. premium of insurance, they are not\r\n    likely to find their interest in grazing, in raising and feeding\r\n    stock, instead of attempting to extend their wheat husbandry. Lord\r\n    Brougham has said, that grazing countries are always the most\r\n    prosperous, and their population the most contented and happy. The\r\n    meat markets of Great Britain are likely to prove better and more\r\n    stable for us, than their grain markets.\r\n\r\n    The Hon. Henry L. Ellsworth, a distinguished citizen, and large\r\n    farmer of Indiana--distinguished throughout the Union for his zeal\r\n    in the cause of agriculture--thus expresses himself on this subject:\r\n    \"After a full consideration of the subject, I am satisfied that\r\n    stock-raising at the West is much more profitable than raising\r\n    grain. Indeed, an examination of the north-western States shows a\r\n    vast difference in the wealth of the grazier over those who crop\r\n    with grain. The profits of wheat appear well in expectation on\r\n    paper, but the prospect is blasted by a severe winter, appearance of\r\n    insects, bad weather in harvesting, in threshing, for there are but\r\n    few barns at the West, or transporting to market, or last, a\r\n    fluctuation in the market itself.\"\r\n\r\n    Such is the opinion of Mr. Ellsworth, the result of observation and\r\n    experience, himself largely interested in ascertaining the safest\r\n    and surest course to be pursued. The destiny he has indicated for\r\n    this beautiful fertile region of country, will undoubtedly be\r\n    fulfilled; it will become a great pastoral, stock-raising, and\r\n    stock-feeding country.\r\n\r\n    Ohio stands now, as she did at the census of 1840, at the head of\r\n    all the wheat States, in the aggregate of production; her crop of\r\n    1848 being estimated at 20,000,000, which is about equal to 10½\r\n    bushels per head of her population. The geological survey of this\r\n    State, and the character of the soil, as described in the Reports of\r\n    the Board of Agriculture, in a large range of her counties, as a\r\n    \"clayey soil,\" \"clayey loam,\" \"clay subsoil,\" &c., shows Ohio to\r\n    possess a fine natural wheat soil, if indeed, alter thirty years of\r\n    a generally successful wheat husbandry, such additional testimony or\r\n    confirmation was necessary.\r\n\r\n    Michigan has also been successful in the cultivation of wheat. Her\r\n    burr-oak openings are unsurpassed in producing wheat. They are\r\n    intervening ridges between low grounds, or marshes and bodies of\r\n    water, and their location not generally considered very healthy. A\r\n    doubt has also been suggested as to whether this soil, being a\r\n    clayey loam, resting on a sandy and gravelly subsoil, is likely to\r\n    wear as well as some other portions of the fertile soil of the\r\n    State. The Commissioner of Patents puts her crop for 1848 at\r\n    10,000,000 of bushels, which is equal to 23½ bushels to each\r\n    inhabitant! By the census of 1840, the population of Michigan was\r\n    212,267; number of bushels of wheat, 2,157,108. Her population in\r\n    1848 is estimated at 412,000. While she has barely doubled her\r\n    population, she has, according to the above estimate, more than\r\n    _quadrupled_ her production of wheat--increased it at the rate of\r\n    about one million bushels a year for eight consecutive years, making\r\n    the quantity she grows to each head of her population _more than\r\n    double_ that of any State in the Union.\r\n\r\n    We can at least say, and appeal to the past history of the country\r\n    to show it, that for a period of more than one hundred years, the\r\n    supply of the Atlantic wheat States has generally been constant, and\r\n    for the most part abundant. They have furnished the \"staff of life\"\r\n    to several generations of men, and cotemporary with it, an annual\r\n    amount for export, that materially assisted in regulating the\r\n    exchanges of the country.\r\n\r\nEngland requires for her own consumption, upon the average of years,\r\nsomewhere about 32,000,000 bushels of wheat more than she produces.\r\nThe average annual entries of foreign wheat for consumption in the\r\nUnited Kingdom, for the sixteen years ending with 1845, were about\r\nnine and a half million bushels. Inasmuch as the average number of\r\nacres in wheat crop were in 1846 about 4,600,000, the average produce\r\n142,200,000 bushels, or over 30 bushels to the acre--an improvement in\r\nthe harvest to the extent of two bushels per acre, will destroy the\r\ndemand, and a deficiency to that extent will double it. Now as there\r\nis an available surplus at the neighbouring ports in Europe, in the\r\nBaltic and the Black Sea, of about 18,000,000 of bushels only,\r\nwhenever there is a demand for home consumption, for, say 20,000,000\r\nbushels, as was the case in each of the five years from 1838 to 1843,\r\nlarger shipments from America will take place; but whenever there are\r\ngood harvests, as in the six years from 1831 to 1837, in which the\r\ndeficiency only ranged from 230,000 to 1,000,000 bushels, the trade is\r\nnot worth notice. It must be remarked, however, that in a country like\r\nBritain, where capital is abundant, consumption great, speculation\r\nrife, the harvest so uncertain, and the stake so great that a cloudy\r\nday transfers thousands from one broker to another, the importation\r\ncannot be closely assimilated to the actual wants of the country. The\r\nordinary yield of grain in the United Kingdom after deductions for\r\nseed, is about 400,000,000 bushels, and as nearly 100,000,000 bushels\r\nof grain and meal were imported in 1847, there must have been a\r\ngeneral deficiency of nearly twenty-five per cent.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Statistics of the British Empire,\" the average extent of land\r\nunder grain culture, &c., in 1840, was estimated as follows:--\r\n\r\n                            ENGLAND AND WALES.\r\n                                    Produce per Acre.

At the rate of three\r\nhectolitres (1 qr. ¼ bush.) to each individual, every family would\r\nrequire thirteen to fourteen hectolitres, costing 210 to 280 francs\r\n(£8 15s. to £11 10s.) according as the price varies, between its\r\npresent value fifteen francs, and its occasional cost twenty francs.\r\nIn the reign of Louis XVI, Arthur Young referred with horror to the\r\nblack bread eaten by the French. Since that time half a century has\r\npassed, and whilst the agricultural produce in France has tripled in\r\nvalue, the labourers who produce it continue, from custom and\r\nnecessity, to eat a detestable bread made from rye, barley, or peas\r\nand potatoes; and, to make the matter still worse, it is badly baked,\r\nwithout yeast, and being sometimes kept for weeks, it becomes covered\r\nwith mould, and altogether presents an appearance enough to turn the\r\nstomach of a savage.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. McGregor's estimate some ten or twelve years ago, the\r\nland under wheat culture was 13,808,171 acres, producing 191,000,000\r\nbushels; and 11,715 acres with spelt, or red wheat, the yield of which\r\nwas 374,000 bushels.\r\n\r\nThe other crops were--\r\n\r\n               Acres       Crops, bushels\r\n  Maslin     2,251,438       32,000,000\r\n  Rye        6,369,879       76,000,000\r\n  Barley     2,936,453       45,000,000\r\n  Oats       7,416,297      134,000,000\r\n  Maize      1,561,372       20,000,000\r\n\r\nWheat and oats are grown all over Russia, which is the greatest corn\r\nland in the world.\r\n\r\nIn Austrian Italy the yield of grain has been reckoned at three\r\nmillion quarters, but this seems rather low. About one-half of this is\r\nmaize and rye, and a quarter wheat.\r\n\r\nIt is reckoned that eight million quarters of grain are raised yearly\r\nin Denmark, but this seems doubtful. In 1839, a million quarters of\r\ngrain, however, were shipped from that kingdom.\r\n\r\nBRITISH AMERICAN PROVINCES.\r\n\r\nAccording to the census return of 1852, the number of acres under\r\ngrain crops, and the produce in Canada, were as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Lower Canada--Produce.

In like manner, the acres are taken\r\nin arpents. An arpent is about one-seventh less than an acre; and a\r\nminot about one-eighth (some say one-twelfth) more than a bushel.\r\n\r\nDuring the years 1850-1, Western Canada exported upwards of two\r\nmillion barrels of flour, and three million bushels of wheat, being\r\nequivalent to 13,600,000 bushels of wheat. The value of the wheat and\r\nflour exported in 1851 was £404,033.

Nevertheless, I cannot\r\nconceal a doubt whether all the elements of comparison have been duly\r\nweighed. The result, especially as regards wheat, is so contrary to\r\npre-conceived opinions, that further investigations should be made. Is\r\nit not possible that, while an equality of expense in preparing the\r\nland for a wheat crop appears to have been assumed, the great care and\r\nexpense necessary in New Brunswick to prepare the land, and an\r\noccasional succession of minimum returns would, to a very considerable\r\nextent, account for the supposed discrepancy?\r\n\r\nWheat has, from time immemorial, been a staple crop in the plains of\r\nNorthern India, and especially in the Punjaub. The climate and soil\r\nare well fitted for this cereal, but owing to defects and carelessness\r\nin the agriculture and harvesting, the crops, though excellent, fall\r\nshort of what most corn-growing countries produce. Further--owing to\r\nfoul boats and granaries, and to the moist heat of the months\r\nimmediately succeeding harvest, the wheat reaches England in a state\r\ntoo dirty and weevelled for market. The hard wheat is preferred by the\r\nnatives in India to the soft, probably for no better cause than that\r\nthe hardness of the grain more closely resembles their favorite food,\r\nrice.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARLEY.\r\n\r\nOats, rye and barley, are the staple crops of northern and mountainous\r\nEurope and Asia. In England barley is grown principally in the eastern\r\nand some of the midland counties, and chiefly for malting. It is most\r\nextensively cultivated in the Himalaya and Thibet, replacing in many\r\ndistricts the wheat, and producing an admirable flour.\r\n\r\nSince the establishment of the studs at Buxar, Ghazepore, &c., oats\r\nhave been extensively cultivated. It is a winter crop.\r\n\r\nAlthough believed to have been indigenous to the countries bordering\r\non the torrid zone, this grain possesses the remarkable flexibility of\r\nmaturing in favorable seasons and situations on the eastern continent\r\nas far north as 70 deg., and flourishes well in lat. 42 deg. south.\r\nAlong the Atlantic side of the continent of America, its growth is\r\nrestricted to the tract lying between the 30th and 50th parallels of\r\nnorth latitude, and between 30 and 40 deg. south. Near the westerly\r\ncoast, its range lies principally between latitude 20 and 62 deg.\r\nnorth. The barley chiefly cultivated in the United States is the\r\ntwo-rowed variety which is generally preferred from the fulness of its\r\ngrain and its freedom from smut. Barley has never been much imported\r\nfrom that country, as the Americans have been rather consumers than\r\nproducers. The consumption of barley there in 1850 in the manufacture\r\nof malt and spirituous liquors amounted to 3,780,000 bushels, and\r\naccording to the census returns, the quantity of barley raised was\r\n4,161,504 bushels in 1840, and 5,167,213 bushels in 1850. In this\r\ncountry barley is extensively used for malting, distilling, and making\r\nbeer; large quantities are consumed in Scotland, or carried into\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIn Prussia, about ten and a half million hectolitres of barley are\r\nannually raised. In the Canary Isles, about 354,000 bushels are\r\nannually exported. In Van Diemen's Land in 1844, 174,405 bushels of\r\nbarley were grown on 12,466 acres.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of barley made into malt in the United Kingdom in the\r\nyear ending 10th October, 1850, was 5,183,617 quarters, of which about\r\nfour million quarters were used by 8,500 maltsters. The quantity of\r\nmalt charged with duty in the year ending 5th January, 1851, was\r\n636,641 tons; the average price per quarter, 26s. 2d.\r\n\r\nBarley is at present extensively cultivated in the temperate districts\r\nand islands of Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. In Spain, Sicily,\r\nthe Canaries, Azores and Madeira, two crops are produced in a year.\r\nIn North America its growth is principally confined to Mexico, the\r\nmiddle, western, and northern States of the Union, and to the British\r\nNorth American provinces. The introduction of barley into the American\r\ncolonies may be traced back to the period of their settlement. By the\r\nyear 1648 it was raised in abundance in Virginia, but soon after its\r\nculture was suffered to decline, in consequence of the more profitable\r\nand increased production of tobacco. It has also been sparingly\r\ncultivated in the regions of the middle and northern States for\r\nmalting and distillation, and has been employed, after being malted,\r\nas a substitute for rice.\r\n\r\nBarley, like wheat, has been cultivated in Syria and Egypt for more\r\nthan 3,000 years, and it was not until after the Romans adopted the\r\nuse of wheaten bread, that they fed their stock with this grain. It is\r\nevidently a native of a warm climate, as it is known to be the most\r\nproductive in a mild season, and will grow within the tropics at an\r\nelevation of 3,000 to 4,000 feet above the level of the sea. It is one\r\nof the staple crops of northern and mountainous Europe and Asia. It is\r\nthe corn that, next to rice, gives the greatest weight of flour per\r\nacre, and it may be eaten with no other preparation than that of\r\nboiling. It requires little or no dressing when it is sent to the\r\nmill, having no husk, and consequently produces no bran. In this\r\ncountry barley is chiefly used for malting and distilling purposes. In\r\nthe year 1850, 40,745,050 bushels of malt paid duty, the number of\r\nmaltsters in the United Kingdom being from 8,000 to 9,000. About one\r\nand a half million quarters of barley were imported in 1849, and a\r\nlittle over a million quarters in 1850, principally from Denmark and\r\nPrussia. The counties in England where this grain is chiefly\r\ncultivated are Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridge, Bedford, Herts, Leicester,\r\nand Nottingham. The produce of barley on land well prepared, is from\r\nthirty to fifty bushels or more per statute acre, weighing from 45 to\r\n55 lbs. per bushel, according to quality. It is said to contain 65 per\r\ncent. of nutritive matter, while wheat contains 78 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe estimated average produce of barley in this country may be stated\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n                       Acres.

The prices of barley per\r\nquarter have ranged, in England, from 36s. 5d. in 1840, to 27s. 6d. in\r\n1842. In 1847 barley reached 44s. 2d., and gradually declined to 23s.\r\n5d, in 1850.\r\n\r\n\r\nOATS.\r\n\r\nOats are principally in demand for horses, and the extraordinary\r\nincrease of the latter has occasioned a proportional increase in the\r\nculture of oats. They are grown more especially in the north and\r\nnorth-eastern counties; in the midland counties their culture is less\r\nextensive, but it is prevalent throughout most parts of Wales.\r\n\r\nNearly twice as much oats as wheat is raised in the United Kingdom,\r\nbut the proportion grown in Scotland is not so large as is supposed.\r\nThe following is a fair estimate of the comparative production:--\r\n\r\n                     Acres.           Produce.\r\n  England          2,500,000         12,500,000\r\n  Ireland          2,300,000         11,600,000\r\n  Scotland         1,300,000          6,500,000\r\n                   ---------          ---------\r\n  Total            6,100,000         30,500,000\r\n\r\nWe import annually about l¼ million quarters from foreign countries\r\nand nearly three-fourths of a million quarters from Ireland. The\r\naverage produce per acre throughout the kingdom is five quarters. The\r\nprice within the last 10 years has ranged from 28s. 7d. per quarter\r\n(the famine year) to 17s. 6d.\r\n\r\nThe oat, when considered in connection with the artificial grasses,\r\nand the nourishment and improvement it affords to live stock, may be\r\nregarded as one of the most important crops produced. Its history is\r\nhighly interesting, from the circumstance that in many portions of\r\nEurope it is formed into meal, and forms an important aliment for man;\r\none sort, at least, has been cultivated from the days of Pliny, on\r\naccount of its fitness as an article of diet for the sick. The country\r\nof its origin is somewhat uncertain, though the most common variety is\r\nsaid to be indigenous to the Island of Juan Fernandez. Another oat,\r\nresembling the cultivated variety, is also found growing wild in\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nThis plant was introduced into the North American Colonies soon after\r\ntheir settlement by the English. It was sown by Gosnold on the\r\nElizabeth Islands in 1602; cultivated in Newfoundland in 1622, and in\r\nVirginia, by Berkley, prior to 1648.\r\n\r\nThe oat is a hardy grain, and is suited to climates too hot and too\r\ncold either for wheat or rye. Indeed, its flexibility is so great,\r\nthat it is cultivated with success in Bengal as low as latitude\r\ntwenty-five degrees North, but refuses to yield profitable crops as we\r\napproach the equator. It flourishes remarkably well, when due regard\r\nis paid to the selection of varieties, throughout the inhabited parts\r\nof Europe, the northern and central portions of Asia, Australia,\r\nSouthern and Northern Africa, the cultivated regions of nearly all\r\nNorth America, and a large portion of South America.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the growth of the oat is confined principally to\r\nthe Middle, Western and Northern States. The varieties cultivated are\r\nthe common white, the black, the grey, the imperial, the Hopetown, the\r\nPolish, the Egyptian, and the potato oat. The yield of the common\r\nvarieties varies from forty to ninety bushels and upwards per acre,\r\nand weighing from twenty-five to fifty pounds to the bushel. The\r\nEgyptian oat is cultivated south of Tennessee, which after being sown\r\nin autumn, and fed off by stock in winter and spring, yields from ten\r\nto twenty bushels per acre. In the manufacture of malt and spirituous\r\nliquors oats enter but lightly, and their consumption for this purpose\r\ndoes not exceed 60,000 bushels annually in the United States.\r\n\r\nIn 1840, Ireland exported 2,037,835 quarters of oats and oatmeal, but\r\nin 1846, on account of the dearth, the grain exports fell off\r\ncompletely. Most of the grain grown in Ireland requires to be\r\nkiln-dried, and is, therefore, of lower value.\r\n\r\nThe oat, like rye, never has entered much into our foreign commerce,\r\nas the domestic consumption has always been nearly equal to the\r\nquantity produced. The annual average exports from the United States\r\nfor several years preceding 1817, were 70,000 bushels.\r\n\r\nBy the census returns of 1840, the total produce of the United States\r\nwas 123,071,341 bushels; of 1850, 146,678,879 bushels.\r\n\r\nIn Prussia 43 million hectolitres of oats are annually raised.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of oats imported into the United Kingdom, has been\r\ndeclining within the last few years. In 1849, we imported 1,267,106\r\nquarters; in 1850, 1,154,473; in 1851, 1,209,844; in 1852, 995,479. In\r\n1844, 221,105 bushels of oats were raised in Van Diemen's Land on\r\n13,864 acres.\r\n\r\n\r\nRYE.\r\n\r\nRye (_Secale cereale_) is scarcely at all raised in this country for\r\nbread, except in Durham and Northumberland, where, however, it is\r\nusually mixed with wheat, and forms what is called \"maslin,\"--a bread\r\ncorn in considerable use in the north of Europe.\r\n\r\nGeographically rye and barley associate with one another, and grow\r\nupon soils the most analogous, and in situations alike exposed. It is\r\ncultivated for bread in Northern Asia, and all over the Continent of\r\nEurope, particularly in Russia, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Germany and\r\nHolland; in the latter of which it is much employed in the manufacture\r\nof gin. It is also grown to some extent in England, Scotland and\r\nWales. With us it is little used as an article of food compared with\r\nwheat and oats, though in the north of Europe and in Flanders it forms\r\nthe principal article of human subsistence, but generally mixed with\r\nwheat, and sometimes, also with barley; 100 parts of the grain consist\r\nof 65.6 of meal, 24.2 of husk, and 10.2 of water. The quantity of rye\r\nwe import seldom reaches 100,000 quarters per annum.\r\n\r\nThe straw is solid, and the internal part, being, filled with pith,\r\nis highly esteemed for Dunstable work, for thatching and litter, and\r\nit is also used to stuff horse collars.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland there are 21,000 acres under culture with rye, producing\r\n105,000 quarters.\r\n\r\nIn North America rye is principally restricted to the Middle and\r\nEastern States, but its culture is giving place to more profitable\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\nIn Bohemia, as in most parts of Germany, rye forms the principal crop,\r\nthe product being about 3,250,000 quarters annually.\r\n\r\nThe three leading varieties cultivated in the United States are the\r\nspring, winter, and southern; the latter differing from the others\r\nonly from dissimilarity of climate. The yield varies from 10 to 30 or\r\nmore bushels per acre, weighing from 48 to 56 pounds to the bushel.\r\nThe production of rye has decreased 4,457,000 bushels in the\r\naggregate, but in New York it is greater by the last decennial census\r\nthan in 1840, by about 40 per cent. Pennsylvania, which is the largest\r\nproducer, has fallen off from 6,613,373 to 4,805,160 bushels. Perhaps\r\nthe general diminution in the quantity of this grain now produced may\r\nbe accounted for, by supposing a corresponding decline in the demand\r\nfor distilling purposes, to which a larger part of the crop is applied\r\nin New York. This grain has never entered largely into its foreign\r\ncommerce, as the home consumption for a long period nearly kept pace\r\nwith the supply. The amount exported from the United States in 1801,\r\nwas 392,276 bushels; in 1812, 82,705 bushels; in 1813, 140,136\r\nbushels. In 1820-1 there were exported 23,523 barrels of rye flour; in\r\n1830-1, 19,100 barrels; in 1840-1 44,031; in 1845-6, 38,530 barrels;\r\nin 1846-7, 48,892 barrels; in 1850-1, 44,152 barrels. During the year\r\nending June 1, 1850, there were consumed of rye about 2,144,000\r\nbushels in the manufacture of malt and spirituous liquors.\r\n\r\nAccording to the American census returns of 1840, the product of the\r\ncountry was 18,645,567 bushels; in 1850, 14,188,637 bushels. We\r\nimported 246,843 quarters of rye and rye meal, in 1849, equivalent to\r\n49,368 tons; but in 1850 the imports were only 94,078 quarters and in\r\n1851 they were but 26,323 quarters. About 20,000 acres are under\r\ncultivation with rye in Ireland, the produce of which is 100,000\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUCKWHEAT.\r\n\r\nBuckwheat belongs to the temperate and arctic climates, and is\r\ncultivated in Northern Europe, Asia, and America for the farinaceous\r\nalbumen of its seeds, which, when properly cooked, affords a delicious\r\narticle of food to a large portion of the human race. It also serves\r\nas excellent fodder to milch cows, and the straw, when cut green and\r\nconverted into hay, and the ripened seeds, are food for cattle,\r\npoultry, and swine.\r\n\r\nIt is raised most abundantly in Central Asia and the Himalaya. In the\r\nlatter country the different varieties are grown at various\r\nelevations, between 4,000 and 12,000 feet. The finest samples\r\nexhibited in 1851 were from Canada, but some of excellent quality was\r\nalso shown by the United States, Russia, and Belgium. The common\r\nvariety grown in Europe is the _Polygonum fagopyrum_, and _P.\r\nemarginatum_ is grown in China and the East. In this country the\r\nproduce varies from 2 to 4 quarters per acre. The quantity of seed\r\nsown is 5 to 8 pecks the acre. Vauquelin found 100 parts of its straw\r\nto contain 29.5 of carbonate of potash, 3.8 of sulphate of potash,\r\n17.5 of carbonate of lime, 13.5 of carbonate of magnesia, 16.2 of\r\nsilica, 10.5 of alum, and 9 of water.\r\n\r\nIt is believed to be a native of Central Asia, as it is supposed to\r\nhave been first brought to Europe in the early part of the twelfth\r\ncentury, at the time of the crusades for the recovery of Syria from\r\nthe dominion of the Saracens; while others contend that it was\r\nintroduced into Spain by the Moors, four hundred years before.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of buckwheat, in one or other of its species, is\r\nprincipally confined to Great Britain, France, Switzerland, Italy,\r\nNetherlands, Germany, Sweden, Russia, China, Tartary, Japan, Algeria,\r\nCanada, and the middle and northern portions of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn America from 30 to 45 bushels per acre may be considered as an\r\naverage yield in favorable seasons and situations, but 60 or more\r\nbushels are not unfrequently produced.\r\n\r\nAccording to the census returns of 1840, the annual quantity raised in\r\nthe United States was 7,291,743 bushels; of 1850, 8,950,916 bushels.\r\n\r\nThe average annual imports of buckwheat into this country have not\r\nexceeded 1,000 quarters, until last year (1852), when they reached\r\n8,085 quarters. A small quantity of the meal is also annually\r\nimported.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIZE.\r\n\r\nMaize (_Zea Mays_), is the common well-known Indian corn forming one\r\nof the most important of the grain crops, and has a greater range of\r\ntemperature than the other cereal grasses. It was found cultivated for\r\nfood by the Indians of both North and South America, on the first\r\ndiscovery of that continent, and thence derived its popular name.\r\nMaize succeeds best in the hottest and dampest parts of tropical\r\nclimates. It may be reared as far as 40 degrees north and south\r\nlatitude on the American continent; while in Europe it can grow even\r\nto 50 degrees or 52 degrees of latitude, some of the numerous\r\nvarieties being hardy enough to ripen in the open air, in England and\r\nIreland. It is now cultivated in all regions in the tropical and\r\ntemperate zones, which are colonized by Europeans. It is most largely\r\ngrown, however, about the Republics bordering on the northern shores\r\nof South America, California, the United States and Canada, the West\r\nIndia islands and Guiana, on the coasts of the Mediterranean, and\r\npartially in India, Africa, and Australia. We see the singular fact in\r\nMexico of land which, after perhaps thousands of years' culture, is so\r\nlittle exhausted, that with a very little labor bestowed on it, a bad\r\nmaize harvest will yield two hundredfold profit, while a good crop\r\nreturns 600 fold.\r\n\r\nThis grain adopts itself to almost every variety of climate, and is\r\nfound growing luxuriantly in the low countries of tropical Mexico, and\r\nnearly equally well on the most elevated and coldest regions of the\r\ntable-land; in the rich valleys of the Cordilleras or the Andes, and\r\non the sandy heights of those mountains wherever a rill of water can\r\nbe brought to nourish its roots. In short, it ripens under the sun of\r\nAmerica, in every part of both continents.\r\n\r\nThough wheat is characterised as the most nutritious food for man in\r\nall quarters of the world, yet the Indian corn crop of the United\r\nStates is not second in value to any product of the earth; cultivated\r\nin the middle and Eastern States, nay, even in the rich cotton-growing\r\ndistricts, Indian corn is fast rising in importance, and will soon\r\nequal in value that important commercial staple. This indigenous grain\r\nyields to the nation an annual average of five hundred millions of\r\nbushels, and has, within the last five years, attracted much attention\r\nas a life-sustaining food, more particularly at the period of\r\nIreland's severe suffering, in 1847, and the following years. Nations,\r\nas well as statesmen and farmers, have found it an object worthy of\r\ntheir consideration and esteem.\r\n\r\nWhen due regard is paid to the selection of varieties, and cultivated\r\nin a proper soil, maize may be accounted a sure crop in almost every\r\nportion of the habitable globe, between the 44th degree of north\r\nlatitude and a corresponding parallel south. Among the objects of\r\nculture in the United States, it takes precedence in the scale of\r\ncereal crops, as it is best adapted to the soil and climate, and\r\nfurnishes the largest amount of nutritive food. Besides its production\r\nin the North American Republic, its extensive culture is limited to\r\nMexico, the West Indies, most of the States of South America, France,\r\nSpain, Portugal, Lombardy, and Southern and Central Europe generally.\r\nIt is, however, also cultivated with success in Northern, Southern,\r\nand Western Africa, India, China, Japan, Australia, and the Sandwich\r\nIslands, the groups of the Azores, Madeira, the Canaries, and numerous\r\nother oceanic isles.\r\n\r\nMaize is not a favorite grain as bread-corn with the European nations,\r\nfor although it abounds in mucilage, it is asserted to contain less\r\ngluten, and is not likely to be much used by those who can procure\r\nwheaten flour, or even rye bread.\r\n\r\nThe large importations which were made by our Government during the\r\nprevalence of the potato disease, brought it into more general use\r\namong some classes, and the imports for home consumption are still\r\nextensive, having been as follows in the last few years:--\r\n\r\n                                     1848.                 1849.\r\n  Indian corn, quarters            1,582,755             2,249,571\r\n    \"    meal, cwts.                 233,880               102,181\r\n\r\n                                     1850.                 1851.\r\n  Indian corn, quarters            1,286,264             1,810,425\r\n    \"    meal, cwts.                  11,401\r\n\r\nThe trade in maize, or Indian corn, is totally new since 1846. The\r\nfamine in Ireland in that year, and the potato rot in almost every\r\nsuccessive year since, have now fully established it. Like the gold\r\ndiscoveries, the potato rot may be regarded as a providential means of\r\neffecting a great change in the condition of society. Those\r\ndiscoveries are not without their influence in the East, and, combined\r\nwith the potato rot, they have rapidly increased the commerce between\r\nthe East and West of Europe, while they are spreading broad paths\r\nbetween all Europe and the lands in the Southern Ocean. The imports of\r\nmaize from all parts, in 1852, amounted to 1,550,000 quarters, of\r\nwhich about 1,100,000 quarters arrived in vessels from the\r\nMediterranean, &c., calling at Queenstown or Falmouth for orders. The\r\nbalance consisted of imports from America, France, Portugal, &c., and\r\nalso of cargoes addressed direct to a port of discharge, without first\r\ncalling off the coast for orders. The quantities received in 1851 and\r\n1852 from the Mediterranean were as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                     1852.             1851.\r\n  Received from                       qrs.              qrs.\r\n    Galatz                          223,000           286,067\r\n    Ibraila                         362,600           211,779\r\n    Salonica                         35,640            95,377\r\n    Odessa                          219,170            74,065\r\n    Egypt                            50,960            86,260\r\n    Italy                             8,250           162,544\r\n    Constantinople, Malta,\r\n      Trieste, and other\r\n      ports in the Mediterranean    190,720           286,358\r\n                                  ---------         ---------\r\n                                  1,090,340         1,202,450\r\n\r\nThe various quarters from whence we derive supplies of this grain, are\r\nshown in the following table of the imports for the last three years,\r\nwhich I have compiled from the most recent Parliamentary returns.\r\n\r\n               INDIAN CORN AND MEAL IMPORTED INTO THE UNITED KINGDOM.\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                        |       1849.     |       1850.    |       1851.\r\n                        |-----------------|----------------|---------------\r\n           PLACES.      |  Corn.  | Meal. |  Corn.  | Meal.|  Corn.  |Meal.\r\n                        |   qrs.  | cwts. |   qrs.  | cwts.|   qrs.  |cwts.\r\n  ----------------------|---------|-------|---------|------|---------|-----\r\n  Russian Ports in      |         |       |         |      |         |\r\n    Black Sea           |   25,519|       |   19,721|      |   98,176|\r\n  Denmark               |    1,300|       |      250|      |        5|\r\n  Hanover               |    1,344|       |         |      |         |\r\n  Belgium               |       67|       |         |      |         |\r\n  France                |  135,115|    510|  102,978|    26|  164,128|   29\r\n  Portugal Proper       |   61,446|       |   67,518|    53|   21,922|\r\n  Azores and Madeira    |   17,214|      7|    7,794|     6|    4,356|    1\r\n  Spain and Bahama      |         |       |         |      |         |\r\n    Islands             |   26,856|     48|   19,982|    48|   34,771|\r\n  Sardinian Territories |   13,357|       |       25|     2|    1,302|    1\r\n  Tuscany               |   11,481|     95|   15,612|    94|   34,760|\r\n  Papal Territories     |    8,927|       |    1,876|      |   75,588|\r\n  Naples and Sicily     |       18|       |   10,066|      |  101,489|\r\n  Austrian Territories  |   90,540|       |   45,748|      |   73,966|\r\n  Malta and Gozo        |   18,198|       |    4,969|      |   11,002|\r\n  Ionian Islands        |    5,390|       |    7,324|      |    5,967|\r\n  Greece                |   57,520|       |    8,712|      |    3,252|\r\n  Egypt                 |   12,767|       |   71,808|      |  127,692|\r\n  Turkish dominions,    |         |       |         |      |         |\r\n    including Wallachia,|         |       |         |      |         |\r\n    Moldavia and Syria  |  563,799|       |  348,456|      |  748,180|\r\n  Morocco               |      760|       |         |      |         |\r\n  West Coast of Africa  |      889|       |    2,322|      |         |\r\n  B.N.A.

The offal of the grain is given to hogs, 500 to 600\r\nhead being annually fattened therewith. The quality of the starch is\r\nsaid to be superior to that of wheat, and commands a higher price in\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\nA corn plant, fifteen days after the seed was planted, cut on the 3rd\r\nJune close to the ground, gave of--\r\n\r\n  Water                 86.626\r\n  Dry matter            10.374\r\n  Ash                    1.354\r\n  Ash calculated dry    13.053\r\n\r\nBy the above figures it will be seen that nearly 90 per cent, of the\r\nyoung plant is water; and that in proportion to the dry matter, the\r\namount of earthy minerals which remain, as ash, when the plant is\r\nburnt, is large. This excess of water continues for many weeks. Thus,\r\non the 5th July, thirty-three days from planting, the relations stood\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n  Water                   90.518\r\n  Dry matter               9.482\r\n  Ash                      1.333\r\n  Ash calculated dry      14.101\r\n  (Ash very saline.)\r\n\r\nBefore green succulent food of this character is fit to give to cows,\r\noxen, mules, or horses, it should be partly dried. Plants that contain\r\nfrom 70 to 75 per cent. of water need no curing before eaten. The\r\nyoung stalk cut July 12, gave over 94 per cent. of water. Such food\r\nused for soiling without drying would be likely to scour an animal,\r\nand give it the cholic.\r\n\r\nThe root at this time (July 12) gave of--\r\n\r\n  Water                     81.026\r\n  Dry matter                18.974\r\n  Ash                        2.222\r\n  Ash calculated dry        11.711\r\n  (Ash tastes of caustic potash.)\r\n\r\nAsh of the whole plant above ground, 6.77 grains. Amount of ash in all\r\nbelow ground, 3.93 grains.\r\n\r\nSo late as July 26, the proportion of water in the stalk was 94 per\r\ncent.; and the ash calculated dry 17.66 per cent. The plant gained\r\n21.36.98 grains in weight in a week preceding the 6th September. This\r\nwas equal to a gain of 12.72 grains per hour.\r\n\r\nThe rapid growth of corn plants, when the heat, light, and moisture,\r\nas well as the soil are favorable, is truly wonderful. A deep, rich,\r\nmellow soil, in which the roots can freely extend to a great distance\r\nin depth and laterally, is what the corn-grower should provide for his\r\ncrop. The perviousness of river bottoms contributes largely to their\r\nproductiveness of this cereal. A compact clay, which excludes alike\r\nair, water, and roots, forbidding all chemical changes, is not the\r\nsoil for Indian corn.\r\n\r\nWhen farmers sell corn soon after it is ripe, there is considerable\r\ngain in not keeping it long to dry and shrink in weight. Corn grown by\r\nMr. Salisbury, which was ripe by the 18th October, then contained 37\r\nper cent. of water, which is 25 per cent. more than old corn from the\r\ncrib will yield. The mean of man experiments tried by the writer has\r\nbeen a loss of 20 per cent. in moisture between new and old corn. The\r\nbutts of cornstalks contain the most water, and husks or shucks the\r\nleast, when fully matured and not dried. The latter have about 30 per\r\ncent, of dry matter when chemically desiccated.\r\n\r\n         COMPOSITION OF THE ASH OF THE LEAVES AT DIFFERENT STAGES.\r\n\r\n                   July 19.

It will be seen\r\nthat the increase of silica or flint in the leaf is steadily\r\nprogressive from 13½ per cent. at July 19, to 58.65 at October 18.\r\n\r\nFlint is substantially the _bone earth_ of all grasses. If one were\r\nto analyse the bones of a calf when a day old, again when thirty days\r\nof age, and when a year old, the increase of phosphate of lime in its\r\nskeleton would be similar to that witnessed in the leaves and stems of\r\nmaize. In the early stages of the growth of corn, its leaves abound in\r\nphosphates; but after the seeds begin to form, the phosphates leave\r\nthe tissues of the plant in other parts, and concentrate in and around\r\nthe germs in the seeds. On the 23rd of August, the ash of the whole\r\nstalk contained 19½ per cent. of phosphates; and on the 18th of\r\nOctober, only 15.15 per cent. In forming the cobs of this plant,\r\nconsiderable potash is drawn from the stalk, as it decreases from\r\n35.54 per cent. August 16, to 24.69 October 18. When the plant is\r\ngrowing fastest, its roots yield an ash which contains less than one\r\nper cent. of lime; but after this development is nearly completed, the\r\nroots retain, or perhaps regain from the plant above, over 4½ per\r\ncent. of this mineral. Soda figures as high as from 20 to 31 per cent.\r\nin the ash obtained from corn roots. Ripe seeds gave the following\r\nresults on the analysis of their ash:--\r\n\r\n  Silica               0.850\r\n  Phosphoric acid     49.210\r\n  Lime                 0.075\r\n  Magnesia            17.600\r\n  Potash              23.175\r\n  Soda                 3.605\r\n  Sodium               0.160\r\n  Chlorine             0.295\r\n  Sulphuric acid       0.515\r\n  Organic acids        5.700\r\n                      ------\r\n                      99.175\r\n\r\nThe above table shows a smaller quantity of lime than is usually found\r\nin the ash of this grain. It is, however, never so abundant as\r\nmagnesia; and Professor Emmons has shown that the best corn lands in\r\nthe State of New York contain a considerable quantity of magnesia. All\r\nexperience, as well as all chemical researches, go to prove that\r\n_potash_ and phosphoric acid are important elements in the\r\norganisation of maize. Corn yields more pounds of straw and grain on\r\npoor land than either wheat, rye, barley, or oats; and it does\r\ninfinitely better on rich than on sterile soils. To make the earth\r\nfertile, it is better economy to plant thick than to have the rows\r\nfive feet apart each way, as is customary in some of the Southern\r\nStates, and only one stalk in a hill. This gives but one plant to\r\ntwenty-five square feet of ground. Instead of this, three square feet\r\nare sufficient for a single plant; and from that up to six, for the\r\nlargest varieties of this crop.\r\n\r\nMr. Humboldt states the production of maize in the Antilles as 300 for\r\none; and Mr. H. Colman has seen in several cases in the New England\r\nStates of America, a return of 400 for one; that is to say, the hills\r\nbeing three feet apart each way, a peck of Indian corn would be\r\nsufficient seed for an acre. If 100 bushels of grain is in such case\r\nproduced by an acre--and this sometimes happens--this is clearly a\r\nreturn of 400 for one.\r\n\r\nOf the whole family of cereals, _Zea Mays_ is unquestionably the most\r\nvaluable for cultivation in the United States. When the time shall\r\ncome that population presses closely on the highest capabilities of\r\nAmerican soil, this plant, which is a native of the New World, will be\r\nfound greatly to excel all others in the quantity of bread, meat,\r\nmilk, and butter which it will yield from an acre of land. With proper\r\nculture, it has no equal for the production of hay, in all cases where\r\nit is desirable to grow a large crop on a small surface.\r\n\r\nAlthough there has been much written on the Eastern origin of this\r\ngrain, it did not grow in that part of Asia watered by the Indus, at\r\nthe time of Alexander the Great's expedition, as it is not among the\r\nproductions of the country mentioned by Nearchus, the commander of the\r\nfleet; neither is it noticed by Arian, Diodorus, Columella, nor any\r\nother ancient author; and even as late as 1491, the year before\r\nColumbus discovered America, Joan di Cuba, in his \"Ortus Sanitatis,\"\r\nmakes no mention of it. It has never been found in any ancient\r\ntumulus, sarcophagus, or pyramid; nor has it ever been represented in\r\nany ancient painting, sculpture, or work of art, except in America.\r\nBut in that country, according to Garcilaso de la Vega, one of the\r\nancient Peruvian historians, the palace gardens of the Incas, in Peru,\r\nwere ornamented with maize, in gold and silver, with all the grains,\r\nspikes, stalks, and leaves; and in one instance, in the \"garden of\r\ngold and silver,\" there was an entire cornfield, of considerable size,\r\nrepresenting the maize in its exact and natural shape; a proof no less\r\nof the wealth of the Incas, than their veneration for this important\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\nIn further proof of the American origin, it may be stated that this\r\nplant is still found growing, in a wild state, from the Rocky\r\nmountains in North America, to the humid forests of Paraguay, where,\r\ninstead of having each grain naked, as is always the case after long\r\ncultivation, it is completely covered with glumes or husks. It is,\r\nfurthermore, a well authenticated fact, that maize was found in a\r\nstate of cultivation by the aborigines, in the island of Cuba, on its\r\ndiscovery by Columbus, as well as in most other places in America,\r\nfirst explored by Americans.\r\n\r\nThe first successful attempt to cultivate this grain in North America,\r\nby the English, occurred on James' river, in Virginia, in 1608. It was\r\nundertaken by the colonists sent over by the Indian company, who\r\nadopted the mode then practised by the natives, which, with some\r\nmodifications, has been pursued throughout this country ever since.\r\nThe yield, at this time, is represented to have been from two hundred\r\nto more than one thousand fold. The same increase was noted by the\r\nearly settlers in Illinois. The present yield, east of the Rocky\r\nMountains, when judiciously cultivated, varies from 20 to 135 bushels\r\nto an acre.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of Indian corn are very numerous, exhibiting every\r\ngrade of size, color, and conformation, between the \"chubby reed\"\r\nthat grows on the shores of Lake superior--the gigantic stalks of the\r\nOhio valley--the tiny ears, with flat, close, clinging grains, of\r\nCanada--the brilliant, rounded little pearl--the bright red grains and\r\nwhite cob of the eight-rowed hæmatite--the swelling ears of the big\r\nwhite and the yellow gourd seed of the South. From the flexibility of\r\nthis plant, it may be acclimatised, by gradual cultivation, from Texas\r\nto Maine, or from Canada to Brazil; but its character, in either case,\r\nis somewhat changed, and often new varieties are the result. The\r\nblades of the plant are of great value as food for stock, and is an\r\narticle but rarely estimated sufficiently, when considering of the\r\nagricultural products of the Southern and Southwestern States\r\nespecially.\r\n\r\nTo supply slaves on plantations with bread, including old and young,\r\nrequires from twelve to thirteen bushels of corn each a year. Taking\r\nthirteen bushels as the average consumption of breadstuffs by the\r\n22,000,000 of people in the United States, the aggregate is\r\n286,000,000 bushels per annum.\r\n\r\nThe increase of production, from 1840 to 1850, was 214,000,000\r\nbushels, equal to 56 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe production of New England advanced from 6,993,000 to 10,377,000\r\nbushels, showing an increase of 3,384,000 bushels, nearly fifty per\r\ncent. New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland,\r\nincreased 20,812,000 bushels, more than fifty per cent. In the\r\nproduction of this crop no State has retrograded. Ohio, which in 1840\r\noccupied the fourth place as a corn-producing State, now ranks as the\r\nfirst. Kentucky is second, Illinois third, Tennessee fourth. The crop\r\nof Illinois has increased from 2,000,000 to 5,500,000 bushels, or at\r\nthe rate of 160 per cent. in ten years.\r\n\r\nOf the numerous varieties some are best adapted to the Southern\r\nStates, while others are better suited for the Northern and Eastern.\r\nThose generally cultivated in the former are the Southern big and\r\nsmall yellow, the Southern big and small white flint, the yellow\r\nPeruvian, and the Virginian white gourd seed. In the more Northerly\r\nand Easterly States they cultivate the golden sioux, or Northern\r\nyellow flint, the King Philip, or eight-rowed yellow, the Canadian\r\nearly white, the Tuscarora, the white flour, and the Rhode Island\r\nwhite flint.\r\n\r\nThe extended cultivation of this grain is chiefly confined to the\r\nEastern, Middle, and Western States, though much more successfully\r\ngrown in the latter. The amount exported from South Carolina, in 1748,\r\nwas 39,308 bushels; from North Carolina, in 1753, 61,580 bushels; from\r\nGeorgia, in 1755, 600 bushels; from Virginia, for several years\r\npreceding the revolution, annually 600,000 bushels; from Philadelphia,\r\nin 1765-66, 54,205 bushels; in 1771, 259,441 bushels.\r\n\r\nThe total amount exported from America in 1770, was 573,349 bushels;\r\nin 1791, 2,064,936 bushels, 351,695 of which were Indian meal; in\r\n1800, 2,032,435 bushels, 338,108 of which were in meal; in 1810,\r\n1,140,960 bushels, 86,744 of which were meal. In 1820-21, there were\r\nexported 607,277 bushels of corn, and 131,669 barrels of Indian meal;\r\nin 1830-31, 571,312 bushels of corn, and 207,604 barrels of meal; in\r\n1840-41,535,727 bushels of corn, and 232,284 barrels of meal; in\r\n1845-46, 1,286,068 bushels of corn, and 298,790 barrels of meal; in\r\n1846-47 16,326,050 bushels of corn, and 948,060 barrels of meal; in\r\n1850-51, 3,426,811 bushels of corn, and 203,622 barrels of meal. More\r\nthan eleven millions of bushels of Indian corn were consumed in 1850,\r\nin the manufacture of spirituous liquors.\r\n\r\nAccording to the census of 1840, the corn crop of the United States\r\nwas 377,531,875 bushels; in 1850, 592,326,612 bushels.\r\n\r\nThe increase in the production of corn in Ohio has been (in ten years)\r\n66 per cent. I have also before me the auditor's returns for the crop\r\nof 1850, as taken by assessors, and the number of acres planted. The\r\nauditor's returns are:--\r\n\r\n  Seventy-three counties           55,079,374\r\n  Darke county                        524,484\r\n  Twelve counties, average          8,400,000\r\n                                   ----------\r\n         Total                     64,003,858\r\n\r\nThis is an advance of 15 per cent. on the crop of 1840, and it is\r\nknown that the crop of 1850 was better than that of 1849. The number\r\nof acres planted, and the average production was:--\r\n\r\nAcres planted         1,810,947\r\nBushels produced     64,003,858\r\nAverage per acre     35-3/8   bush.\r\n\r\nConsidering how large a portion of hill land is planted, and how many\r\nfields are ill cultivated, the average is high. Many persons have\r\nbelieved that taking all years and all lands into view, the average of\r\ncorn lands was not more than thirty bushels. But the immense fertility\r\nof _bottom_ lands on the rivers and creeks of Ohio make up for bad\r\ncultivation and inferior soil. We may see something of the differences\r\nin the production of corn, by taking the averages of different\r\ncounties, thus:--\r\n\r\n               Acres.       Crop.       Average.\r\n  Butler       62,031     2,646,353       42½\r\n  Warren       42,322     1,757,409       42\r\n  Pickaway     65,860     2,627,727       40\r\n  Ross         69,520     2,918,958       42\r\n\r\nCompare the average of these counties, which embrace some of the best\r\nlands in the State, with the following:--\r\n\r\n               Acres.       Crop.       Average.\r\n  Carroll      10,107       316,999       32\r\n  Jackson      15,680       439,850       30\r\n  Monroe       23,375       728,242       31\r\n  Portage      10,426       329,529       32\r\n  Vinton       11,413       345,470       30\r\n\r\nThe last counties contain but little bottom land, and hence the\r\naverage of corn is reduced one-fourth in amount. Of these counties,\r\ntwo are full of coal and iron. The resources of the last are more slow\r\nto develop, but in the end will be equally valuable.\r\n\r\nBut a small quantity of the corn of Ohio is exported _as grain_. It is\r\nfirst manufactured into other articles, and then exported in another\r\nform. The principal part of these are hogs, cattle, and whiskey. It is\r\ndifficult to say exactly how much corn is _in this way exported_, but\r\nthe following is an approximation--\r\n\r\n                      Bushels.\r\n  In Fat Cattle      4,000,000\r\n  In Fat Hogs       10,000,000\r\n  In Whiskey         2,500,000\r\n                    ----------\r\n      Total         16,500,000\r\n\r\nTaking into view the export of corn meal--about twenty millions of\r\nbushels--the residue goes to the support of the stock animals on hand,\r\nof which there are near three millions, exclusive of those fatted for\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nThe exported corn in the shape of cattle, hogs, and whiskey, is worth\r\nabout thirty cents cash, while on the farm it is not worth\r\ntwenty--thus proving that it is more profitable to consume corn on the\r\nfarm, than to export it in bulk. This fact is well known to good\r\nfarmers, who seldom attempt to sell corn as a merchantable article.\r\n\r\nNo mining in the world has ever been equal to mining in a fertile\r\nsoil, and no treasury is so reliable as a granary of surplus products.\r\n\r\nIndian corn and meal generally find a market in the West Indies,\r\nNewfoundland, Spain, and Portugal. It commands a good price, and finds\r\na ready sale in the ports which are open to its reception.\r\n\r\nDeducting one-sixteenth for the amount exported, and one-tenth for\r\nseed, the quantity of maize annually consumed for food in the United\r\nStates by a family of five persons is 85 bushels.\r\n\r\nMaize may be considered as the great staple of the agricultural\r\nproducts of the States. It is exported in large quantities, in a raw\r\nstate, or when manufactured into meal. Before it is manufactured into\r\nmeal it is dried by a fire, in a kiln prepared for that purpose. By\r\nthis process the meal is much less liable to become sour on the\r\nvoyage, and can be preserved much longer in a warm climate.

In Illinois, North Carolina,\r\nGeorgia, Alabama, Missouri, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, New York,\r\nMaryland, Arkansas, and the New England States, it appears to be a\r\nvery favorite crop. In Massachusetts, the most Northern and least\r\nfavorable State on that account, being cold, a fair proportion is\r\ngrown, the aggregate produce being greater there than in any of the\r\ngrains, except oats; more, indeed, than might be expected, were not\r\nlabor somewhat cheaper than in more Southern States, where the climate\r\nis more congenial. The ordinary produce is twenty-five bushels per\r\nacre; forty bushels is often raised, and in prize crops the weight has\r\ncome up to 100 bushels per acre. In Ohio the average is fifty-five\r\nbushels to the acre. The eight and twelve-rowed varieties of Indian\r\ncorn are those most usually grown in New York, and the average produce\r\nof a good field in that State is from forty to sixty bushels; on\r\nordinary ground twenty-five to thirty is a fair crop. The same returns\r\nappeared to be derived from ground in New Jersey. Mr. Doubleday, of\r\nBinghampton, New York, estimates the produce of that neighbourhood at\r\nforty bushels, and the expense of raising the crop as follows,\r\nestimating the worth of the land at twenty-five dollars (say £5) per\r\nacre:--\r\n\r\n                                                   Dollars.

(1s.\r\n4½d.) per bushel.\r\n\r\nNothing is here put down for manure or cartage, because the fodder,\r\ncut up and saved, as usually adopted, is equal to the manure required.\r\nIt is looked upon that the preparation of ground for corn costs less\r\nthan wheat; the approved plan is to plant on sward ground, ploughing\r\nat once, and turning the ground completely over, then harrowing\r\nlongitudinally until, a good tilth is obtained. Should the soil not be\r\nrich enough, stable manure is first spread on the land.\r\n\r\nNow suppose the corn to sell at seventy-five cents the bushel, the\r\naccount would stand thus:--\r\n\r\n                                                    Dollars.

This low cost was owing to the fact of\r\nno manure being used; and while it speaks volumes as to the natural\r\nfertility of American soils, yet it reflects very disgracefully upon\r\nthe careless system adopted there, as under such treatment no land\r\ncould continue, after some years, to produce a crop which could come\r\ninto competition with those from newer and less exhausted lands; but\r\nif under a good system of tillage the ground was yearly renewed with\r\nmanure, and those amendments which every soil requires, after a crop\r\nhas been raised from it, added to the soil in top-dressing and in\r\nploughing-in, we should never hear of the exhausted state of New\r\nEngland land, or see the sons of the soil moving west and cultivating\r\nnewer soils, thus removing much of the capital and intelligence of a\r\ncountry away from it.\r\n\r\nSupposing the corn of Monroe county sold at seventy cents per bushel,\r\nthe balance would appear thus:--\r\n\r\n                                         Dollars.

Durand, an experienced\r\nagriculturist:--If the soil selected is light and mellow, it should be\r\nploughed and subsoiled in the spring, first spreading on the coarse\r\nunfermented manure which is to be ploughed in. For marking the rows\r\nfor planting, a \"corn marker\" may be used to advantage. It is made by\r\ntaking a piece of scantling, three inches square and ten to twelve\r\nfeet long, with teeth of hickory or white oak inserted at distances of\r\ntwo to four feet, according to the width designed for the rows. Then\r\nan old pair of waggon-thills and a pair of old plough-handles are put\r\nto it, and your marker is done. With a good horse to draw this\r\nimplement, the ground may be made ready for planting very rapidly. It\r\nis better to leave the ground flat than to ridge it, for the latter\r\nmode has no advantage, except when the ground is wet. The difference\r\nin the two modes is chiefly this:--When the ground is ridged, the corn\r\nbeing planted between the edges of the furrows, it comes immediately\r\nin contact with the manure, springs up and grows rapidly the fore part\r\nof the season. When the ground is left flat, and the manure turned\r\nunder the furrows, the corn will often look feeble at first, and in\r\ngrowth will frequently be much behind that on the ridges; and the\r\ninference early in the season is, that the ridged ground will give the\r\nbest crop, but as soon as the roots of the corn on the flat ground get\r\nhold of the manure (say about the 20th of July), the corn will shoot\r\nrapidly ahead, and the full force of the manure will be given to the\r\nstalk just at the time of forming the grain. Corn cultivated in this\r\nway, if the soil is deeply tilled, will often keep green, while that\r\non ridges is dried up.\r\n\r\nMany farmers, at planting, shell the corn off the cob, and plant it\r\ndry. Others soak it a few days in warm water. But when the seed is\r\nonly treated in this way, it is very likely to be pulled up by birds\r\nand injured by worms. The best way to prevent this is to first soak\r\nthe corn in a strong solution of saltpetre; then take a quantity of\r\ntar, and having warmed it over a fire, pour it on the corn, and stir\r\nwith a stick or paddle till the grain is all smeared with the tar;\r\nthen add gypsum or plaster till the corn will separate freely, and no\r\nbirds will touch the grain.\r\n\r\nThe time of planting, in the United States, varies with the season and\r\nthe section of the country. In New England it may generally be planted\r\nfrom the 15th to the 25th May. Where the ground is flat, a light\r\nharrow or a cultivator is much better to go between the rows than the\r\nplough. Formerly a great deal of useless labor was spent in hilling up\r\ncorn; in dry seasons this was worse than useless. The earth hauled\r\nround the stalk does not assist its growth, nor aid in holding it up;\r\nthe brace roots, which come out as the stalk increases in height,\r\nsupport it; and it has been observed, that in a heavy storm and\r\nthunder gust, corn that is hilled will be broken down more than that\r\nwhich is not hilled. The ground which is kept level has also the\r\nadvantage of more readily absorbing rain, rendering the crop less\r\nliable to suffer from drought. The field should have two or three\r\nregular hoeings, and the weeds be carefully kept under.\r\n\r\nIn harvesting the following will be found a good plan:--Let two hands\r\ntake five rows, cutting the corn close to the ground. A hill should be\r\nleft standing to form the centre of the shock, placing the stalks\r\nround it, so that they may not lie on the ground. After the shock is\r\nmade of sufficient size, take a band of straw, and having turned down\r\nthe tops of the stalks, bind them firmly, and the work is done.\r\n\r\nMaize may be cut as soon as the centre of the grain is glazed, even if\r\nthe stalks are green. There will be sufficient nutriment in the stalk\r\nto perfect the ear, and the fodder is much better than when it gets\r\ndry before it is cut. If the shocks are well put up, they may stand\r\nfour or five weeks. The corn may then be knocked out, and the fodder\r\nsecured for winter use.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Ohio Board of Agriculture for 1849, contains many\r\ninteresting statements in reference to maize culture, made by the\r\nofficers of numerous county agricultural societies. In Miami county,\r\n2,030,670 bushels were grown, at an average yield of fifty-five\r\nbushels per acre. Three varieties are cultivated: the common gourd\r\nseed, for cattle; the yellow Kentucky, for hogs and distilling; and\r\nthe white, for grinding and exportation. According to the returns from\r\nGreen county, which produced 1,250,000 bushels of corn in 1849, \"a\r\nregular rotation of clover, corn, wheat, and clover again, is best for\r\ncorn; and no crop pays better for extra culture.\" The Harrison county\r\nAgricultural Society reports the pork crop at 4,800,000 pounds; and it\r\ngave its first premium for corn to Mr. S.B. Lukens, whose statement is\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"The ground had been in meadow ten years, was ploughed six inches\r\n    deep about the middle of April, was harrowed twice over on the 9th\r\n    May, and planted on the 11th four feet by two feet. It came up well,\r\n    was cultivated and thinned when ten inches high; three stalks were\r\n    left in a hill. About two weeks afterward it was again cultivated,\r\n    and the suckers pulled off. About the last of June it was again\r\n    cultivated, making three times the same way, as it was laid off but\r\n    one way.\r\n\r\n                                                        d.     c.\r\n  Expense of culture, gathering, and cribbing, was      17     10\r\n  Produce of 374-3/8 bushels, at 31¼ cents             117     10\r\n                                                       ----------\r\n  Profit on three acres                                100     00\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evidence on which a premium was awarded was such as should satisfy\r\nany one that 374 bushels were grown on three acres of land, and at a\r\ncost not exceeding 17 dollars 10 cents, delivered in the crib. This is\r\nproducing corn at less than 5 cents a bushel.\r\n\r\nWhether the statement be true to the letter or not, it shows\r\nconclusively the great value of a _rich soil_ for making cheap corn.\r\nThe Board of Agriculture estimates the crop of Ohio last year at\r\n70,000,000 of bushels. Taking the United States as a whole, probably\r\nthe crop of corn was never better than in the year 1849. One that has\r\nrich land needs only to plough it deep and well, plant in season, and\r\ncultivate the earth properly with a plough or cultivator, to secure\r\nthe growth of a generous crop. On poor soils the case is very\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nTo raise a good crop of corn on poor land, and at the least possible\r\nexpense, requires some science and much skill in the art of tillage.\r\nTake the same field to operate in, and one farmer will grow 100\r\nbushels of corn at half the cost per bushel that another will expend\r\nin labor, which is money. It unfortunately happens that very skilful\r\nfarmers are few in number, in comparison with those who have failed to\r\nstudy and practice all attainable improvements. To produce cheap corn\r\non poor land, one needs a clear understanding of what elements of the\r\ncrop air and water will furnish, and what they cannot supply. It\r\nshould be remembered that the atmosphere is precisely the same over\r\nground which yields 100 bushels of corn per acre, that it is over that\r\nwhich produces only five bushels per acre. Now, the whole matter which\r\nforms the stems, leaves, roots, cobs, and seeds of corn, where the\r\ncrop is 100 bushels per acre, is not part and parcel of the soil. A\r\nharvest equal to fifty bushels per acre can be obtained without\r\nconsuming over ten per cent, of earth, as compared with the weight of\r\nthe crop. No plant can imbibe more of the substance of the soil in\r\nwhich it grows, than is dissolved in water, or rendered gaseous by the\r\ndecomposition of mould.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of matter dissolved, whether organic or inorganic, during\r\nthe few weeks in which corn plants organise the bulk of their solids,\r\nis small. From 93 to 97 parts in 100 of the dry matter, in a mature,\r\nperfect plant, including its seeds, cob, stems, leaves, and roots, are\r\ncarbon (charcoal) and the elements of water. It is not only an\r\nimportant, but an exceedingly instructive fact, that the most\r\neffective fertilisers known in agriculture are those that least abound\r\nin the elements of water and carbon. The unleached dry excrements of\r\ndunghill fowls and pigeons, have five times the fertilising power on\r\nall cereal plants that the dry dung of a grass-fed cow has, although\r\nthe latter has five times more carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, per 100\r\npounds, than the former. Although it is desirable to apply to the soil\r\nin which corn is to grow as much of organised carbon and water as one\r\nconveniently can, yet, where fertilisers have to be transported many\r\nmiles; it is important to know that such of the measure as would form\r\n_coal_, if carefully burnt, can best be spared. The same is true of\r\nthose elements in manure which form vapor or water, when the\r\nfertiliser decomposes in the ground.\r\n\r\nCarbonic acid and nascent hydrogen evolved in rotting stable manure\r\nare truly valuable food for plants, and perform important chemical\r\noffices in the soil; but they are, nevertheless, not so indispensable\r\nto the economical production of crops, as available nitrogen, potash,\r\nsilica, magnesia, sulphur, and phosphorus. These elements of plants\r\nbeing less abundant in nature, and quite indispensable in forming\r\ncorn, cotton, and every other product of the soil, their artificial\r\nsupply in guano, night soil, and other highly concentrated\r\nfertilisers, adds immensely to the harvest, through the aid of a small\r\nweight of matter. In all sections where corn is worth 30 cents and\r\nover a bushel, great benefits may be realised by the skilful\r\nmanufacture and use of poudrette. This article is an inodorous\r\ncompound of the most valuable constituents of human food and clothing.\r\nIt is the raw material of crops.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to restore to a cornfield all the matter removed\r\nin the crop to maintain its fertility. A part of each seed, however,\r\nought to be carried back and replaced in the soil, to make good its\r\nloss by the harvest.\r\n\r\nIn every barrel of meal or flour sent to market (196 pounds), there\r\nare not far from 186 pounds of carbon (coal), and the elements of\r\nwater. When a bird eats wheat or corn, I have reason to believe, from\r\nseveral experiments, that over 80 per cent, of the food escapes into\r\nthe air through its capacious lungs in the process of respiration; and\r\nyet the 20 per cent, of guano left will re-produce as much wheat or\r\ncorn as was consumed. Imported guano, which has been exposed to the\r\nweather for ages, often gives an increase in the crop of wheat equal\r\nto three pounds of seed to one of fertiliser; while it has given a\r\ngain of seven to one of corn, and fifty to one of green turnips.\r\n\r\nLike other grains that have been long cultivated, Indian corn abounds\r\nin varieties. In Spain they count no less than 130, and in the United\r\nStates the number is upwards of forty. The difference consists in\r\nsize, color, period of maturation, and hardness and weight of grain.\r\nOf size there exists a considerable variety, from Zea Curagua of\r\nChili, and the Egyptian or chicken corn, both extremely diminutive, to\r\nthe large white flint, and ground seed corn of the United States. The\r\ndifferences in color are the red, yellow, and white. The period of\r\nmaturation varies, apparently, very considerably; but it is\r\nquestionable whether this variation is real, and independent of\r\nclimate. In the Northern States of America, Indian corn ripens in a\r\nshorter period of time than it does in the South, owing, possibly, to\r\nthe greater length of the summer day in those latitudes.\r\n\r\nIn selecting varieties, some experienced and judicious farmers prefer\r\nthat which yields the greater number of ears, without regard to their\r\nsize, or number of rows. Others prefer that which furnishes one or two\r\nlarger ears, having from twelve to twenty-four rows. In the Northern\r\nStates of America the yellow corn bears the highest price in the\r\nmarket, and is considered the most prolific and best suited to feed\r\ncattle and hogs. For bread, the white Button is preferred at the\r\nNorth, and the white ground seed is used for that purpose in other\r\nquarters. Preference, however, is most frequently given to white flint\r\ncorn, which is unquestionably the heaviest, and contains the greatest\r\nproportion of farina.\r\n\r\nIn Mississippi many varieties are grown, principally those known as\r\nflint and bastard flint. The gourd-seed varieties are very\r\nobjectionable in that climate, principally on account of their\r\nsoftness rendering them unfit for bread, and open to the attacks of\r\ninsects in the field and the crib. They require a grain, _white_,\r\n_hard_, and rather flinty--_white_ because of its great consumption in\r\nbread and hommony, in the preparation of both of which their cooks\r\ngreatly excel. When meal is ground for bread, the mill is set rather\r\nwide, that the flinty part of the grain may not be cut up too fine,\r\nthis being sifted out for \"small hommony;\" the farinaceous part of the\r\ngrain is left for bread. This hommony is a beautiful and delicious\r\ndish. On most plantations the negroes have it for supper, with\r\nmolasses or buttermilk. A _hard flinty_ grain is necessary to head the\r\nweevil, with which not only the cribs but the heads of corn in the\r\nfield are infested. These are the _Calandra oryzæ_, the true rice\r\nweevil, distinguished from his European cousin by the two reddish\r\nspots on each _elytra_ or wing-cover, and known in America as the\r\n\"black weevil;\" also a little brown insect, not a true weevil, but a\r\n_Sylvanus_. This sylvanus, and another of the same genus, most\r\nprobably the _S. surinamensis_, attack the corn in the field before it\r\nbecomes hard, causing serious damage--but nothing to equal that\r\noccasioned by the black weevil.\r\n\r\nI know of no generally successful method of staying or even checking\r\nthe injury caused by the insects, though much might be written in the\r\nway of suggestion.\r\n\r\nIn Michigan, the _dent_ variety in dry seasons produces the best crops\r\non sandy loam, as its roots run deeper than the common _eight-rowed_\r\nyellow or white. In moist seasons the latter varieties usually do\r\nwell. They are grown most generally in the Northern part of the State,\r\nwhile in the Southern section the Ohio dent is principally raised. The\r\nshuck and blade are much used as fodder for cattle, in the early part\r\nof winter.\r\n\r\nIndian corn is very liable to change of character from soil and\r\nclimate, growing smaller the farther North it is raised. The mixing of\r\nthe eight-rowed yellow with the Ohio dent has, so far as my experience\r\ngoes, been beneficial in increasing the yield. Sandy loam, or clay, is\r\nconsidered the soil best adapted to corn. It is usually planted in\r\nMay, and harvested in September. The blade is not taken off there as\r\nat the South; some farmers cut up their corn when ripe, put it into\r\nshocks, and husk it late in the fall; others cut the stalks, bind them\r\nin sheaves, and stack them for winter in the fields, or put them away\r\nin barns or sheds; while others husk the corn on the hill without\r\ncutting the stalks, and late in the fall turn their cattle into the\r\nfield to eat the fodder. Of these different modes the preference is\r\nusually given to cutting the stalks and putting them under cover\r\nafter being well cured, and busting the corn on the hill. The corn is\r\nthought to ripen better in this way, and to keep better in the cribs.\r\nThe Ohio dent, having a smaller ear containing less moisture than\r\nother varieties, ripens quicker and keeps better. This crop ranges\r\nfrom 25 to 65 bushels per acre, and the difference in the yield is to\r\nbe attributed to the manner of cultivation. My experience shows that a\r\ncrop of 45 bushels per acre costs 13 cents a bushel, including\r\ninterest on land. Corn is principally raised in Michigan for home\r\nconsumption, and the stalks and shucks, if well cured, are worths\r\ndollars per acre, compared with hay at 5 dollars per ton.\r\n\r\nAs much as 134 bushels per acre have been obtained, in some instances,\r\nin Massachusetts; till the last 20 years 35 bushels was considered an\r\naverage crop, but by a due rotation of crops, and ploughing in long\r\nmanure, at least 75 bushels to the acre are now raised. The kinds\r\npreferred there, are an eight-rowed variety, procured originally from\r\nCanada; the Cass corn, another eight-rowed variety, and the Dutton\r\ncorn, each of which averages about 60 lbs. to the bushel.\r\n\r\nMaize is a principal crop in the Connecticut River Valley, Western\r\nVermont, and along the Lake shore; but in the high dividing ridge, and\r\nin the Northern counties bordering on Canada, the climate is too\r\nsevere for its profitable cultivation.\r\n\r\n    \"The kind mostly grown (observes Mr. Colburn, of Vermont) is the\r\n    yellow eight-rowed, though some prefer the twelve and sixteen-rowed,\r\n    known here by the name of the Button corn; but my experience in\r\n    cultivating the different kinds for the last twenty-four years, has\r\n    forced me to the conclusion that the common eight-rowed, mixed with\r\n    a kind called the Brown corn, does the best; the kernel of\r\n    the-latter bearing upon a chocolate hue, and the mixture of these\r\n    two kinds of seed imparting a deep rich color to the whole, when\r\n    they become blended, and enhancing the yield whenever the soil is in\r\n    high tilth. Of this kind, the writer has raised, the past season,\r\n    upon eleven acres on the Connecticut River alluvium, over eight\r\n    hundred bushels shelled corn, four acres of which, with extra\r\n    preparation, produced four hundred and sixteen bushels.\r\n\r\n    It will never do to carry seed corn from South to North, as it will\r\n    not mature in a higher or colder climate than that from which it has\r\n    been taken. Even half a degree of latitude sensibly affects the\r\n    maturing of the blade, and renders it an uncertain crop in our high\r\n    northern latitudes. To insure an extra yield of this valuable grain,\r\n    the soil must be highly manured, deeply ploughed, thorough\r\n    cultivated and hoed, and top-dressed with lime, house ashes, and\r\n    plaster. This done, it is the most remunerative and profitable of\r\n    all grain crops.\"\r\n\r\nIn Delaware there are many varieties, and everybody esteems his own\r\nkind the best. The grain varies from pure \"flint\" to pure \"gourd\r\nseed\"--of course the mixtures which are between these two varieties\r\nare most common--it inclines more to gourd seed than to flint. Mint\r\nweighs full standard fifty-six, the gourd seed from forty-nine to\r\nfifty-two pounds, and the mixtures range between. Flint ripens from\r\nten days to two weeks earlier. It will not produce as many pounds per\r\nacre as the lighter gourd seed. Soil exerts its influence over the\r\ncharacter of corn, a heavy soil tending to produce flint--light soil,\r\ngourd seed.\r\n\r\nThe corn is \"cut up\" in the fall, and after curing in the shuck, is\r\nhusked; the shuck remaining on the stalk with the blades.\r\n\r\nThe average yield, on improved land, is fifty bushels; though crops\r\nof one hundred and twelve, and one hundred and sixty bushels per acre\r\nare reported to have been raised in the county, in 1849. The yield\r\nincreases from year to year. A general and rapid improvement of the\r\nState is in progress, and in nothing is this seen more clearly than in\r\nthe corn crop. Mossy \"old sedge\" fields, which have been laid out for\r\nyears, are broken up, and will yield, if it be a good season, from\r\nfive to ten bushels per acre; fence them, lime them with twenty to\r\nthirty bushels, and seed the oat crop with clover, and in two years\r\nthe clover sod will return eighteen to twenty bushels of corn. Another\r\ndressing of lime, or its equivalent in marl, of which there is an\r\nabundance in the lower half of Newcastle County, will show thirty\r\nbushels of corn; and of wheat, if the farm manure be used on it, nine\r\nto twelve bushels will not be too much to expect.\r\n\r\nIn Arkansas, Indian corn is regarded as the \"king of grains.\" It\r\nconstitutes the chief food of every animal, from man down to the\r\nmarauding rat, while its dried blade furnishes seven-tenths of the\r\nlong food for working animals. The _large white_ is the variety most\r\nesteemed, and most generally cultivated, for the reasons that it\r\nyields more grain and fodder, makes, when ground into meal, whiter and\r\nsweeter bread, and is less liable to injury from the weevils. The\r\nblade is usually esteemed the best long food for horses, exceeding in\r\nprice the best Northern hay; the average price may be stated at about\r\nseventy cents per cwt. The shuck is fed to cows and young mules, they\r\neat it, but with less relish than they do the blades, which are\r\nsweeter and more nutritious. The former are much used for mattresses,\r\nbeing preferred to moss, as they are cleaner, and easier manufactured.\r\nWhen mixed with coarse cotton, and properly prepared, they will make a\r\nmattress but little inferior to curled hair: price about fifty cents\r\nper cwt. The average price of this grain may be set down at forty\r\ncents per bushel; and the yield on upland in some parts of the State\r\nmay be stated at thirty bushels per acre.\r\n\r\nFive varieties of maize are grown in Peru. One is known by the name of\r\n_chancayano_, which has a large semi-transparent yellow grain; another\r\nis called _morocho_, and has small yellow grain of a horny appearance;\r\n_amarello_, or the yellow, has a large yellow opaque grain, and is\r\nmore farinaceous than the two former varieties; _blanco_, white--this\r\nvariety is large, and contains more farina than the former; and\r\n_cancha_, or sweet maize. The last is only cultivated in the colder\r\nclimates of the mountains; it grows about two feet high, the cob is\r\nshort, and the grains large and white; when green, it is very bitter,\r\nbut when ripe and roasted, it is particularly sweet, and so tender\r\nthat it may be reduced to flour between the fingers. In this roasted\r\nstate it constitutes the principal food of the mountaineers of several\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\nThe natives remove the husk from the maize by putting it into water\r\nwith a quantity of wood ashes, exposing it to a boiling heat, and\r\nwashing the grain in running water, when the husk immediately\r\nseparates from the grain.\r\n\r\nIn Jamaica I found maize to produce two crops in the year, and often\r\nthree. It is usually grown there on the banks or ridges of the cane\r\nfields. It may be planted at any time when there is rain, and it\r\nyields from fifteen to forty bushels per acre, according to the\r\nrichness of the soil, and the more or less close manner in which it is\r\nplanted.\r\n\r\nIn the colony of New South Wales, including the district of Port\r\nPhillip, there were 20,798 acres under cultivation with maize in 1844,\r\nthe produce from which was returned at 575,857 bushels; 27,058 bushels\r\nof maize were exported from Sydney in 1848.\r\n\r\n_Culture in the East Indies_.--The growers on the hills of Nepaul\r\nreckon three kinds of maize: a white grained species, which is\r\ngenerally grown on the hill sides; a yellow grained one, grown in the\r\nlow and hot valleys; and a smaller one, called \"Bhoteah,\" or \"Murilli\r\nMakii,\" which is considered the sweetest of the three, but from being\r\nless productive is not generally grown on good lands. Maize thrives\r\nbest on a siliceous, well-drained, rich soil. A correspondent in my\r\n\"Colonial Magazine,\" vol. ii. p. 309, says the finest Indian corn he\r\never saw was in the Himalayas of the Sikim-range, where the soil\r\nconsists of a substratum of decomposed _mica_ from the under or rocky\r\nstratum, with a superstratum of from three to six inches of decayed\r\nvegetable matter, from leaves, &c., of the ancient forests.\r\n\r\nThroughout Hindostan, June is the usual time for sowing. In Behar,\r\nabout two seers are usually sown upon a beggah; in Nepaul, twenty-four\r\nseers upon an English acre; in the vicinity of Poonah, one and a-half\r\nseer per beggah. Before the seed is sown the land is usually ploughed\r\ntwo or three times, and no further attention given to the crop than\r\ntwo hoeings. In Nepaul, where it is the principal crop cultivated, the\r\nseed is sown, after one delving and pulverisation of the soil, in the\r\nlatter end of May and early part of June, in drills, the seeds being\r\nlaid at intervals of seven or eight inches in the drills, and the\r\ndrills an equal space apart. The drills are not raised as for turnip\r\nsowing, but consist merely of rows of the plant on a level surface.\r\nThe seed is distributed in this manner with the view of facilitating\r\nthe weeding of the crop, not for the purpose of earthing up the roots,\r\nwhich seems unnecessary. The Indian corn sowing resembles that of the\r\n_gohya_ (or upland) rice, in the careful manner in which it is\r\nperformed; the sower depositing each grain in its place, having first\r\ndibbled a hole for it five or six inches deep, with a small hand hoe,\r\nwith which he also covers up the grain.\r\n\r\nThe after-culture of this crop is performed with great care in the\r\nvalleys, but much neglected in the hills, especially on new and strong\r\nlands. In the former it undergoes repeated weeding during the first\r\nmonth of its growth, the earth being loosened round the roots, at each\r\nweeding, with the hand hoe. After the first loosening of the soil,\r\nwhich is performed as soon as the plants are fairly above ground, a\r\ntop dressing of ashes or other manure is given. By this mode the crop\r\ngets the immediate benefit of the manure, which otherwise, from the\r\nextraordinary rapidity of its growth, could not be obtained by it. In\r\nthree months from the time of sowing, the seed is ripe. The crop is\r\nharvested by cutting off the heads. In Nepaul these are either heaped\r\non a rude scaffolding, near the cultivator's house, or, more commonly,\r\nthey are suspended from the branches of the trees close by, where,\r\nexposed to wind and weather, the hard and tough sheath of the seed\r\ncones preserves the grain for many months uninjured.\r\n\r\nCattle are voraciously fond of the leaves and stems, which are very\r\nsweet, and even the dry straw, which Dr. Buchanan surmises may be the\r\nreason why it is not more generally cultivated by the natives, as the\r\ndifficulty would be great to preserve the crop. So slow is the\r\nprogress of changes in the regions of India, that near Kaliyachak,\r\nthough the people give all other straw to their cattle, yet they burn\r\nthat of maize as unfit for fodder. In Nepaul the stalks, with the\r\nleaves attached, often twelve feet long, cut by the sickle, are used\r\nas fodder for elephants, bedding for cattle, and as fuel. The maize\r\ncrop within the hills of Nepaul suffers much from the inroads of\r\nbears, which are very numerous in these regions, and extremely partial\r\nto this grain. The average return from this crop is seldom below fifty\r\nseers, ranging frequently far above it.[42] Maize is increasing in\r\ncultivation in Java, and some of the Eastern islands. It is found to\r\nhave the advantage there over mountain rice, of being more fruitful\r\nand hardy, and does not suffer from cold until the mean temperature\r\nfalls to 45 deg. of Fahrenheit, and no heat is injurious to it.\r\nSeveral varieties of it are known, but for all practical purposes\r\nthese resolve themselves into two kinds: one, a small grain, requiring\r\nfive months to ripen, and a larger one, which takes seven to mature.\r\nIn some provinces of Java it yields a return of 400 or 500 fold. Mr.\r\nCrawfurd found, from repeated trials, that in the soil of Mataram, in\r\nJava, an acre of land, which afforded a double crop, produced of the\r\nsmaller grain 848½ lbs. annually.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICE.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most extensively diffused and useful of grain\r\ncrops, and supports the greatest number of the human race. The\r\ncultivation prevails in Eastern and Southern Asia, and it is also a\r\ncommon article of subsistence in various countries bordering on the\r\nMediterranean. It is grown in the Japan Islands, on all the sea coasts\r\nof China, the Philippine and other large Islands of the Indian\r\nArchipelago, partially in Ceylon, Siam, India, both shores of the Red\r\nSea, Egypt, the shores of the Mozambique Channel, Madagascar, some\r\nparts of Western Africa, South Carolina, and Central America. Three\r\nspecies only are enumerated by Lindley:--_Oryza sativa_, the common\r\nrice, a native of the East; _O. latifolia_, a species having its\r\nhabitat in South America; and _O. Nepalensis_, common in Nepaul. But\r\nthere are a host of varieties known in the East; these, however, may\r\nfor all practical purposes, be resolved into two kinds--the upland or\r\nmountain rice (_O. Nepalensis_, the _O. mutica_, of Roxburgh), and the\r\nlowland or aquatic species (_O. sativa_).\r\n\r\n_Zizania aquatica_ is exceedingly prolific of bland, farinaceous\r\nseeds, which afford a kind of rice in Canada and North-West America,\r\nwhere it abounds wild in all the shallow streams. The seeds contribute\r\nessentially to the support of the wandering tribes of Indians, and\r\nfeed immense flocks of wild swans, geese, and other water fowl.\r\nPinkerton says, this plant seems intended to become the bread-corn of\r\nthe North. Two other species of Zizania are common in the United\r\nStates of America.\r\n\r\nRice, the chief food, perhaps, of one-third of the human race,\r\npossesses the advantage attending wheat, maize, and other grains, of\r\npreserving plenty during the fluctuations of trade, and is also\r\nsusceptible of cultivation on land too low and moist for the\r\nproduction of most other useful plants. Although cultivated\r\nprincipally within the tropics, it flourishes well beyond, producing\r\neven heavier and better filled grain. Like many other plants in common\r\nuse, it is now found wild [it is to be understood that the wild rice,\r\nor water oat (_Zizania aquatica_), already referred to, which grows\r\nalong the muddy shores of tide waters, is a distinct plant from the\r\ncommon rice, and should not be confounded with it], nor is its native\r\ncountry known. Linnæus considers it a native of Ethiopia, while others\r\nregard it of Asiatic origin.\r\n\r\nThe chief variety of this cereal is cultivated throughout the torrid\r\nzone, wherever there is a plentiful supply of water, and it will\r\nmature, under favorable circumstances, in the Eastern continent, as\r\nhigh as the 45th parallel of north latitude, and as far south as the\r\n38th. On the Atlantic side of the Western continent, it will flourish\r\nas far north as latitude 38 degrees, and to a corresponding parallel\r\nsouth. On the Western coast of America, it will grow so far north as\r\n40 or more degrees. Its general culture is principally confined to\r\nIndia, China, Japan, Ceylon, Madagascar, Eastern Africa, the South of\r\nEurope, the Southern portions of the United States, the Spanish Main,\r\nBrazil, and the Valley of Parana and Uruguay.\r\n\r\nIn 1834, 29,583 bags of rice were shipped from Maranham, but I am not\r\naware what have been the exports since.\r\n\r\nAt the Industrial Exhibition in London, in 1851, there were displayed\r\nmany curious specimens and varieties of rice, grown without\r\nirrigation, at elevations of three thousand to six thousand feet on\r\nthe Himalaya, where the dampness of the summer months compensates for\r\nthe want of artificial moisture. Among these American rice received\r\nnot only honorable mention for its very superior quality, but the\r\nCarolina rice, exhibited by E.I. Heriot, was pronounced by the jury\r\n\"magnificent in size, color, and clearness,\" and it was awarded a\r\nprize medal. The jury also admitted that the American rice, though\r\noriginally imported from the Old World, is now much the finest in\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nThis grain was first introduced into Virginia by Sir William Berkeley,\r\nin 1647, who received half a bushel of seed, from which he raised\r\nsixteen bushels of excellent rice, most or all of which was sown the\r\nfollowing year. It is also stated that a Dutch brig, from Madagascar,\r\ncame to Charleston in 1694, and left about a peck of paddy (rice in\r\nthe husk), with Governor Thomas Smith, who distributed it among his\r\nfriends for cultivation. Another account of its introduction into\r\nCarolina is, that Ashley was encouraged to send a bag of seed rice to\r\nthat province, from the crops of which sixty tons were shipped to\r\nEngland in 1698. It soon after became the chief staple of the colony.\r\nIts culture was introduced into Louisiana in 1718, by the \"Company of\r\nthe West.\"\r\n\r\nThe present culture of rice in the United States is chiefly confined\r\nto South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas.\r\nThe yield per acre varies from twenty to sixty bushels, weighing from\r\nforty-five to forty-eight pounds when cleaned. Under favorable\r\ncircumstances as many as ninety bushels to an acre have been raised.\r\n\r\nJudge Dougherty, who resides near the borders of Henderson county,\r\nTexas, has raised a crop of several hundred bushels of upland rice.\r\nThe crop averages thirty bushels to the acre. He thinks rice can be\r\nraised there as easily as Indian corn, and will be far more\r\nprofitable.\r\n\r\nAnother variety is cultivated in America to a limited extent, called\r\nCochin-China, dry, or mountain rice, from its adaptation to a dry\r\nsoil, without irrigation. It will grow several degrees further north\r\nor south than the Carolina rice, and has been cultivated with success\r\nin the Northern provinces of Hungary, China, Westphalia, Virginia and\r\nMaryland; but the yield is much less than that already stated, being\r\nonly fifteen to twenty bushels to an acre. It was first introduced\r\ninto Charleston, from Canton, by John Brodly Blake, in 1772.\r\n\r\nThe American crop of rice in 1848, reached 162,058 tierces in market,\r\nand of these 160,330 tierces were exported from South Carolina. The\r\nlargest rice crop grown in South Carolina for the past thirty years,\r\nwas in 1847, when 192,462 tierces were raised; 140,000 to 150,000 is\r\nabout the average, and it has only exceeded 170,000 on four occasions.\r\n\r\nThe amount of rice exported from South Carolina in 1724, was 18,000\r\nbarrels; in 1731, 41,957 barrels; in 1740, 90,110 barrels; in 1747-48,\r\n55,000 barrels; in 1754, 104,682 barrels; in 1760-61, 100,000 barrels;\r\nfrom Savannah, in 1755, 2,299 barrels, besides 237 bushels of paddy or\r\nrough rice; in 1760, 3,283 barrels, besides 208 bushels of paddy; in\r\n1770, 22,120 barrels, besides 7,064 bushels of paddy; from\r\nPhiladelphia, in 1771, 258,375 pounds. The amount exported from the\r\nUnited States, in 1770, was 150,529 barrels; in 1791, 96,980 tierces;\r\nin 1800, 112,056 tierces; in 1810, 131,341 tierces; in 1820-21, 88,221\r\ntierces; in 1830-31, 116,517 tierces; in 1840-41, 101,617 tierces; in\r\n1845-46, 124,007 tierces; in 1846-47, 144,427 tierces; in 1850-51,\r\n105,590 tierces.\r\n\r\nAccording to the census of 1840, the rice crop of the United States\r\namounted to 80,841,422 lbs.; in 1850, 215,312,710 lbs.\r\n\r\nRice being an aquatic plant, is best grown in low moist lands, that\r\nare easily inundated.\r\n\r\nThe ground is ploughed superficially, and divided into squares of from\r\ntwenty to thirty yards in the sides, separated from each other by\r\ndykes of earth about two feet in height, and sufficiently broad for a\r\nman to walk upon. These dykes are for retaining the water when it is\r\nrequired, and to permit of its being drawn off when the inundation is\r\nno longer necessary. The ground prepared, the water is let on, and\r\nkept at a certain height in the several compartments of the rice\r\nfield, and the seedsman goes to work. The rice that is to be used as\r\nseed must have been kept in the husk; it is put into a sack, which is\r\nimmersed in the water until the grain swells and shows signs of\r\ngermination; the seedsman, walking through the inundated field,\r\nscatters the seed with his hand, as usual; the rice immediately sinks\r\nto the bottom, and many even penetrate to a certain depth in the mud.\r\nIn Piedmont, where the sowing takes place at the beginning of April,\r\nthey generally use about fifty-five pounds of seed per acre. The rice\r\nbegins to show itself above the surface of the water at the end of a\r\nfortnight; as the plant grows, the depth of the water is increased, so\r\nthat the stalks may not bend with their own weight. About the middle\r\nof June this disposition is no longer to be apprehended; the rice is\r\nnot so flexible as it was, so that the water can be drawn off for a\r\nfew days to permit hoeing; after which the water is again let on, and\r\nmaintained to the height of the plant. In July it is usual to top the\r\nstalks, an operation which renders the flowering almost simultaneous.\r\n\r\nRice generally flowers in the beginning of the month of August, and a\r\nfortnight later the grain begins to form. It is at this period\r\nespecially that the stalks require to be supported, and this is\r\neffectually done by keeping the water at about half their height. The\r\nrice field is emptied when the straw turns yellow. The harvest\r\ngenerally takes place at the end of September. In the Isle of France\r\nrice is cultivated in very damp soils, upon which a great deal of rain\r\nfalls, but which are not flooded, as in other tropical countries: but\r\nthe process is not so certain nor the crop so great, as when\r\ninundation is employed. In Piedmont the usual return of a rice field\r\nis reckoned at about fifty for one. At Munzo, in New Granada, the\r\npaddy fields which are not inundated, under the influence of a mean\r\ntemperature of 26 deg. centrigrade (79.0 deg. Fahrenheit), yield 100\r\nfor 1.--(Simmonds's \"Colonial Magazine,\" vol. xi., p. 92.)\r\n\r\nThe rice now grown about New Orleans is as sweet, if not sweeter,\r\nthan that imported from South Carolina, but it is deficient in\r\nhardness and brightness when ready for market, a defect owing entirely\r\nto two causes, neither of which is beyond the control of the planter.\r\nThe one cause is the mode of culture, it being generally grown without\r\ndue attention to the seed--seeded at too late a period of the season,\r\nand allowed to become _rare-ripe_ upon the stalk. The other cause is\r\nthe very imperfect mode of its preparation for market; this being\r\ninvariably accomplished by the primitive pestle and mortar, or the\r\nold-fashioned \"pecker mill.\" The same seed is planted in the same soil\r\nfrom year to year, a system which, it is generally conceded, will\r\ndeteriorate the quality and production of any grain crop. A very large\r\nproportion of the rice grown in Carolina is prepared for market at the\r\nsteam toll-mills, in the vicinity of Charleston; and a mill of this\r\ndescription near New Orleans, would remedy the greatest defect in the\r\nrice of the country, greatly increase the demand for the article, and\r\nundoubtedly yield a large return for the investment. The toll mills at\r\nand around Charleston are, and always have been, prosperous. The mills\r\nof Mr. Lucas, in England, erected to clean \"paddy,\" _i.e._ \"rough\r\nrice,\" sent there in bulk from Carolina, have succeeded also, and have\r\nincreased the consumption of the article in that country. The \"rough\r\nrice,\" \"paddy,\" or grain, as it comes from the ear, is composed,\r\nfirst, of a rough, silicious outer covering, impervious to water,\r\nwhich is very useful in the neighbourhood of cities, for filling up\r\nlow lots or pools, for horse beds, and for packing crockery and _ice_,\r\nbeing far better for the latter purpose than the sawdust used; second,\r\na brown flour or bran, lying directly under the outer covering; and\r\nthird, of the clean or white rice. There is no question that, as a\r\ncommon diet, it is better adapted to the climate of Louisiana than\r\nIndian corn; and it can be grown on the hitherto _waste lands of the\r\nsugar plantations_; it is always substituted by the physician, when\r\npracticable, as the food best adapted to the laborer, in seasons of\r\ndiarrhoea and other similar diseases, is _preferred_ before any other\r\ngrain by the negro; and if the clean rice be ground and bolted, a meal\r\nis produced which can be made up into various forms of cake and other\r\nbread, of unrivalled sweetness and delicacy. The outer flour, or brown\r\nbran, which is separated from the chaff at the toll mill, is known as\r\n\"rice flour,\" and corresponds to the \"bran\" of wheat, it is a most\r\nexcellent food for horses, poultry, pigs and _milch cows_, and would\r\nalways command a ready sale in New Orleans. It is used extensively for\r\nthese purposes at and around Charleston, and is shipped thence, by the\r\ncargo, to Boston and other Northern ports.\r\n\r\nNo portion of the globe is better adapted to the growth of this grain\r\nthan the delta of the Mississippi. The river is _always_ \"up and\r\nready\" to do the all-important duty of irrigation in March, April,\r\nMay, and June, in which period of the year the crop ought to be made;\r\nand I am informed, and doubt not, that _two_ cuttings can be obtained\r\nfrom the same plants, between March and the killing frosts of the\r\nsucceeding November.\r\n\r\nAn interesting report by Dr. E. Elliot, on the Cultivation of Rice,\r\nwas read before the Pendleton Farmer's Society, South Carolina, at a\r\nrecent annual meeting, from which I shall make an extract.\r\n\r\n    In \"Ramsay's History of South Carolina\" it is stated:--\"Landgrave\r\n    Thomas Smith, who was Governor of the Province in 1693, had been at\r\n    Madagascar before he settled in Carolina. There he observed that\r\n    rice was planted and grew in low moist ground. Having such ground in\r\n    his garden, attached to his dwelling in East Bay, Charleston, he was\r\n    persuaded that rice would grow therein, if seed could be procured.\r\n    About this time a vessel from Madagascar, being in distress, came to\r\n    anchor near Sullivan's Island. The master inquired for Mr. Smith, as\r\n    an old acquaintance. An interview took place. In the course of\r\n    conversation Mr. Smith expressed a wish to obtain some seed rice to\r\n    plant in his garden. The cook being called, said that he had a small\r\n    bag of rice suitable for the purpose. This was presented to Mr.\r\n    Smith, who sowed it in a low spot in Longitude Lane. From this small\r\n    beginning did one of the great staple commodities of South Carolina\r\n    takes its rise, which soon became the chief support of the colony,\r\n    and its great source of opulence.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Such is the historical account of the introduction of rice into\r\n    South Carolina; and from that day to this, it has constituted one of\r\n    her staple articles of production. Although the climate and soil\r\n    were found admirably suited to the plant, the planters encountered\r\n    incredible difficulty in preparing or dressing the rice for market.\r\n    From the day of its introduction, to the close of the Revolution,\r\n    the grain was milled, or dressed, partly by hand and partly by\r\n    animal power. But the processes were imperfect, very tedious, very\r\n    destructive to the laborer, and very exhausting to the animal power.\r\n    The planter regarded a good crop as an equivocal blessing, for as\r\n    the product was great so in proportion was the labor of preparing it\r\n    for market. While matters stood thus, the planters were released\r\n    from their painful condition by a circumstance so curious that it\r\n    deserves a place in the history of human inventions. A planter from\r\n    the Santee, whilst walking in King-street, Charleston, noticed a\r\n    small windmill perched on the gable end of a wooden store. His\r\n    attention was arrested by the beauty of its performance. He entered\r\n    the store and asked who the maker was. He was told that he was a\r\n    Northumbrian, then resident in the house--a man in necessitous\r\n    circumstances, and wanting employment. A conference was held; the\r\n    planter carried the machine to the Santee, pointed out the\r\n    difficulties under which the planters labored, and the result was\r\n    the rice pounding-mill. This man was the first Mr. Lucas, and to his\r\n    genius South Carolina owes a large debt of gratitude. For what the\r\n    cotton planter owes to Eli Whitney, the rice planter owes to Mr.\r\n    Lucas. His mills were first impelled by water, but more recently by\r\n    steam, and though much mechanical ingenuity and much capital have\r\n    been expended in improving them, the rice pounding-mill of this day,\r\n    in all essential particulars, does not differ materially from the\r\n    mill as it came from the hands of Mr. Lucas.\r\n\r\n    This great impediment being removed, one formidable difficulty still\r\n    remained in the way of the rice planters, and that was the threshing\r\n    of the crop by flail. The labor requisite to accomplish this was so\r\n    great, that we once heard a distinguished planter say, while having\r\n    one large crop threshed out by flail, that he would regard another\r\n    large crop as a calamity. Previous to 1830 threshing mills had been\r\n    tried by various individuals, but with no apparent success. In that\r\n    year the attempt was renewed, and we were present and witnessed the\r\n    first trial of a thresher, constructed in New York, and which was\r\n    tested on Savannah river, under the auspices of General Hamilton.\r\n    The machinery was driven by apparatus similar to that employed for\r\n    driving the cotton gin. The result was not very satisfactory, but\r\n    there was ground for hope, and after an outlay of very large sums,\r\n    and after many disappointments, the happy expedient was thought of,\r\n    of testing the mill with steam instead of animal power. The\r\n    experiment was completely successful, and it was manifest at once\r\n    that the difficulties had not been in the imperfect construction, of\r\n    the thresher, but in the insufficiency of the moving power.\r\n\r\n    It is now twenty years since we witnessed the working of the small\r\n    mill alluded to, and the rice threshing-mill, with steam-engine\r\n    attached, is now a splendid piece of operative machinery. The rice\r\n    in sheaf is taken up to the thresher by a conveyor, it is threshed,\r\n    the straw taken off, then thrice winnowed and twice screened, and\r\n    the result in some cases exceeds a thousand bushels of clean rough\r\n    rice, the work of a short winter day.\r\n\r\n    Humanity rejoices at these inventions--at this transfer to water and\r\n    steam, of processes so slow and so exhausting to the human as well\r\n    as to the animal frame--and in this feeling we are confident every\r\n    planter deeply sympathises. Moreover, the relief they have afforded\r\n    in other respects has been perfectly indescribable. Previous to\r\n    these improvements all the finer portions of the winter were\r\n    appropriated exclusively to the milling and the threshing of the\r\n    crop with the flail, yet it is manifest they added not one particle\r\n    to the value of the property; indeed, while going on, all other\r\n    work, and all preparation for another crop had to be suspended, so\r\n    that the condition of the plantation was not progressive, but\r\n    retrograde.\r\n\r\n    A short recapitulation will show what has been accomplished by the\r\n    enterprise of our planters in the last seventy years. At the close\r\n    of the Revolution it is believed the rice fields were poorly\r\n    drained, and when broken up were chiefly turned with the hoe, then\r\n    trenched with the hoe; then came three or four hoeings and as many\r\n    pickings. The rice was then cut with the sickle and carried in on\r\n    the head, then threshed with the flail, then milled and dressed, in\r\n    some cases wholly by human labor, and in others by a rude machine,\r\n    called a pecker mill. Now, in 1852, the hoeing, the pickings, and\r\n    the cutting with the sickle remain unchanged; but the lands are\r\n    better drained, and in the turning the plough has superseded the\r\n    hoe; the trenching, when, necessary, is done by animal power; the\r\n    rice, when cut, is carried in on a flat and wagon, then threshed and\r\n    milled by machinery, so perfect that it is difficult to imagine how\r\n    it can be surpassed.\r\n\r\n    It is one hundred and fifty-nine years since the introduction of\r\n    rice into Carolina, and there are grounds for supposing that our\r\n    people have accomplished more during that period, in the cultivation\r\n    and preparation of this grain, than has been done by any of the\r\n    Asiatic nations who have been conversant with its growth for many\r\n    centuries. We had the rare opportunity, a few years since, of seeing\r\n    a Chinese book on rice planting, which contained many engravings.\r\n    The language we could not read, but we comprehended a sufficient\r\n    number of the engravings to institute a comparison between their\r\n    system and our own, and the result was, in our method of irrigation\r\n    we were their equals, while in economy of cultivation, and in the\r\n    preparation of the grain for market and for use, we are greatly\r\n    their superiors. Again, some six or seven years since the East India\r\n    Company, of London, sent an agent to this country to procure\r\n    American cotton seed, gins, and overseers, for the purpose of\r\n    testing the practicability of raising cotton by our method in India.\r\n    This agent, Captain Bayles, when in Savannah, was heard to say that\r\n    he had especial directions from the Company to inform himself\r\n    minutely of our system of rice culture. Here, then, was an embassage\r\n    from the banks of the Ganges, a spot where rice has been cultivated\r\n    probably for twenty centuries, to inquire into the method of\r\n    cultivation and preparation, of a people amongst whom the grain had\r\n    no existence one hundred and sixty years ago.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is the mode of culture for rice in Carolina:--It is\r\nsowed as soon as it conveniently can be after the vernal equinox, from\r\nwhich period until the middle, and even the last of May, is the usual\r\ntime of putting it in the ground. It grows best in low marshy land,\r\nand should be sowed in furrows twelve inches asunder; it requires to\r\nbe flooded, and thrives best if six inches under water; the water is\r\noccasionally drained off, and turned on again to overflow it, for\r\nthree or four times.\r\n\r\nWhen ripe the straw becomes yellow, and it is either reaped with a\r\nsickle, or cut down with a scythe and cradle, some time in the month\r\nof September; after which it is raked and bound, or got up loose, and\r\nthreshed or trodden out, and winnowed in the same manner as wheat or\r\nbarley.\r\n\r\nHusking it requires a different and particular operation, in a mill\r\nmade for that purpose. This mill is constructed of two large flat\r\nwooden cylinders, formed like mill-stones, with channels or furrows\r\ncut therein, diverging in an oblique direction from the centre to the\r\ncircumference, made of a heavy and exceedingly hard timber, called\r\nlightwood, which is the knots of the pitch pine. This is turned with\r\nthe hand, like the common hand-mills. After the rice is thus cleared\r\nof the husks, it is again winnowed, when it is fit for exportation.\r\n\r\nA bushel of rice will weigh about sixty or sixty-six pounds, and an\r\nacre of middling land will produce twenty-five bushels.\r\n\r\nVarious machines have been contrived for cleaning rice, of which one\r\nsecured by patent to Mr. M. Wilson, in 1826, and thus described by Dr.\r\nUre, may be regarded as a fair specimen:--It consists of an oblong\r\nhollow cylinder, laid in an inclined position, having a great many\r\nteeth stuck in its internal surface, and a central shaft, also\r\nfurnished with teeth. By the rapid revolution of the shaft, its teeth\r\nare carried across the intervals of those of the cylinder, with the\r\neffect of parting the grains of rice, and detaching whatever husks or\r\nimpurities may adhere to them. A hopper is set above to receive the\r\nrice, and conduct it down into the clean cylinder. About eighty teeth\r\nare supposed to be set in the cylinder, projecting so as to reach very\r\nnearly the central shaft, in which there is a corresponding number of\r\nteeth, that pass freely between the former.\r\n\r\nThe cylinder may also be placed upright, or horizontal if preferred,\r\nand mounted in any convenient framework. The central shaft should be\r\nput in rapid rotation, while the cylinder receives a slow motion in\r\nthe opposite direction. The rice, as cleaned by that action, is\r\ndischarged at the lower end of the cylinder, where it falls into a\r\nshute, and is conducted to the ground. The machine may be driven by\r\nhand, or by any other convenient motive power.[43] The growth of rice\r\nin North America is almost wholly confined to two States; nine-tenths\r\nof the whole product, indeed, being raised in the States of South\r\nCarolina and Georgia. A little is grown in North Carolina, Louisiana,\r\nand Mississippi.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate crop, for 1843, amounted to 89,879,185 lbs., while in\r\n1847 it had risen to 103,000,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nBesides the rice which is raised in the water, there is also the dry,\r\nor mountain rice, which is raised in some parts of Europe on the sides\r\nof the hills. It is said to thrive well in Cochin China, in dry light\r\nsoils, not requiring more moisture than the usual rains or dews\r\nsupply. By long culture the German rice, raised by the aid of water,\r\nis stated to have acquired a remarkable degree of hardness and\r\nadaptation to the climate. The upland rice of the United States is\r\nthought by some to be only a modified description of the swamp rice.\r\nIt will grow on high and poor land, and produce more than Indian corn\r\non the same land would do, even fifteen bushels, when the corn is but\r\nseven bushels. The swamp rice was originally cultivated on high land,\r\nand is not so now, because it is more productive in the swamp, in the\r\nproportion, as is said, of twenty to sixty bushels per acre; and the\r\nuse of water likewise, it is stated, makes it easier of cultivation,\r\nby enabling the planter to kill the grasses. It is thought that on\r\nrich high land, rice may be made to produce twenty-five or thirty\r\nbushels to an acre in a good season. A letter from a gentleman in\r\nNorth Carolina gives the following account of some rice raised there.\r\nHe says:--\r\n\r\n    \"I have planted it the two past years with a view to private\r\n    consumption only; not, however, with the success of my neighbours,\r\n    who are famous, and have the things under their own management. They\r\n    make from forty to fifty, and some, sixty bushels to the acre, on\r\n    fine land that produces ordinarily from ten to fifteen bushels of\r\n    Indian corn or maize. It is a larger grain than the gold or swamp\r\n    rice, and very white; hence it is commonly called here the 'white\r\n    rice.' It is planted generally about the middle of March, or 1st of\r\n    April, in small ridges two-and-a-half feet apart, in chops at\r\n    intervals of about eighteen inches, on the top of the ridge, ten or\r\n    twelve seeds in each chop. A season that will make Indian corn,\r\n    will, if long enough, make this rice; but it requires about four or\r\n    five weeks more than the corn to mature. It ought to be cut before\r\n    quite ripe, as it threshes off very easily, and is liable to great\r\n    waste. Instead of the flail, we take the sheaf in the hand, and whip\r\n    it across a bench in a close room until the rice leaves the straw.\r\n    It does not stand the pestle as well as the swamp rice, but breaks a\r\n    good deal in the beating; this, however, I have heard attributed to\r\n    the dry culture.\"\r\n\r\nA new variety of rice is mentioned as having been discovered in South\r\nCarolina, in 1838, called the big-grained rice. It has been proved to\r\nbe unusually productive. One gentleman, in 1840, planted not quite\r\nhalf an acre with this seed, which yielded forty-nine and a half\r\nbushels of clean winnowed rice. In 1842, he planted 400 acres, and in\r\n1843, he sowed his whole crop with this seed. His first parcel when\r\nmilled, was eighty barrels, and netted half a dollar per cwt. over the\r\nprimest rice sold on the same day. Another gentleman also planted two\r\nfields in 1839, which yielded seventy-three bushels per acre. The\r\naverage crop before from the same fields of fifteen and ten acres, had\r\nonly been thirty-three bushels per acre.\r\n\r\nThe following were the returns of produce on some of the leading\r\nestates of South Carolina, in 1848:--\r\n\r\n  -----------------+----------+-----------+---------+------------+----------\r\n                   | Barrels  |           |         |            |\r\n                   | Shipped  |  Barrels  |         |Average Net |Net Income\r\n      Plantation   |__________|    of     |         |  Produce   |  Amount\r\n                   |Whole|Half|600 lbs.net| Weight  |per barrel. | Dollars\r\n  -----------------+-----+----+-----------+---------+------------+----------\r\n  1.

These plantations were all on the river Waccamaw. The expenses\r\nof a well supplied rice plantation may be stated at 33-1/3 per cent. on\r\nthe net income.\r\n\r\nA gentleman from the United States, named Colvin, proposes to\r\nestablish the cultivation of rice in the colony of Demerara. This is\r\nno new experiment, rice having been already grown with success in\r\nseveral parts of the colony--for instance, in Leguan, up the Canje\r\nCreek, and elsewhere; and some of it is of superior quality,\r\npreferable, indeed, to that imported. If Mr. Colvin's object be not\r\nmerely to demonstrate the practicability of rice being grown in\r\nBritish Guiana, but to promote its cultivation on such a scale as may\r\ntend to render it in time one of the staples of the colony, he is\r\ndeserving of support, and I hope that his efforts will be crowned with\r\ncomplete success.\r\n\r\nThe editor of the _Gazeta_, a local paper, has been shown some sprigs\r\nof rice raised near Matanzas, in Cuba, the smallest of which contains\r\nat least three hundred grains, perfectly opened, and of a larger size\r\nthan is usually produced on the island. He observes that this\r\nphenomenon is not limited to a certain number of sprigs, but that the\r\nwhole crop is similar--that this excess of production is to be\r\nattributed to the extraordinary abundance of rain this year. \"Here we\r\nhave a specimen,\" says the editor, \"of the enormous production that\r\ncould be raised in our fields of this excellent and nutritious grain,\r\nif it were cultivated in places contiguous to the rivers, where it\r\ncould be flowed during drought.\"\r\n\r\nThe experiment of cultivating rice in France appears to have succeeded\r\nperfectly. A piece of ground of 100 hectares in extent (250 acres) was\r\nsown with rice last year in the lands of Arcachon, near Bordeaux, and\r\nthe crop proved a highly satisfactory one. The seed is sown about the\r\nmiddle of April, and almost immediately appears above ground.\r\n\r\nRice may be kept a very long period in the rough--I believe a\r\nlifetime. After being cleaned, if it be prime rice, and well milled,\r\nit will keep a long time in this climate; only when about to be used\r\n(if old) it requires more careful washing to get rid of the must,\r\nwhich accumulates upon it. Some planters--the writer among the\r\nnumber--prefer for table use rice a year old to the new. The grain is\r\nsuperior to any other provisions in this respect. If a laborer in the\r\ngold diggings, or elsewhere, takes with him two days' or a week's\r\nprovisions, in rice, and his wallet happens to get wet, he has only to\r\nopen it to the sun and air, and he will find it soon dries, and is not\r\nat all injured for his purpose. Rough rice may remain under water\r\ntwenty-four hours without injury, if dried soon after.\r\n\r\nPassing eastward, rice begins to be found cultivated in Egypt, becomes\r\nmore general in Northern India, and holds undisputed rule in the\r\npeninsulas of India, in China, Japan, and the East India\r\nislands--shares it in the west coast of Africa with maize, which, on\r\nthe other hand, is the exclusively cultivated corn plant of the\r\ngreatest part of tropical America, with only some unimportant\r\nexceptions. On the coast of Africa rice ripens in three months; they\r\nput it under water when cut, where it keeps sound and good for some\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nRice is now the staple commodity of Bourbon, and it produces about\r\n26,000 quintals annually. It forms, together with maize and mandioc,\r\nthe principal article of food amongst the negroes and colored people.\r\n\r\n_The Bhull rice lands of Lower Sind_.--Like all large rivers which\r\nflow through an alluvial soil, for a very lengthened course, the Indus\r\nhas a tendency to throw up patches of alluvial deposit at its mouth;\r\nand these are in Sind called _bhulls_, and are in general very\r\nvaluable for the cultivation of the red rice of the country. These\r\n_bhulls_ are large tracts of very muddy swampy land, almost on a level\r\nwith the sea, and exposed equally to be flooded both by it and the\r\nfresh water; indeed on this depends much of the value of the soil, as\r\na _bhull_ which is not at certain times well covered with salt water,\r\nis unfit for cultivation. They exist on both sides of the principal\r\nmouths of the Indus, in the Gorabaree and Shahbunder pergunnas, which\r\npart of the province is called by the natives \"Kukralla,\" and was in\r\nolden days, before the era of Goolam Shah Kalora, a small state almost\r\nindependent of the Ameers of Sind. On the left bank of the mouths of\r\nthe river these _bhulls_ are very numerous and form by far the most\r\nfertile portion of the surrounding district. They bear a most dreary,\r\ndesolate, and swampy appearance--are intersected in all directions by\r\nstreams of salt and brackish water, and are generally surrounded by\r\nlow dykes or embankments, in order to regulate the influx and reflux\r\nof the river and sea. Yet from these dreary swamps a very considerable\r\nportion of the rice consumed in Sind is produced; and the Zemindars,\r\nwho hold them, are esteemed amongst the most respectable and wealthy\r\nin Lower Sind.\r\n\r\nTo visit a _bhull_ is no easy matter. Route by land there is none, and\r\nthe only way is to go by boat, in which it is advisable to take at\r\nleast one day's provisions and water, as the time occupied in the\r\ninspection will be regulated entirely by the state of the tide and\r\nweather. Very difficult is it too, to land on any of these places, the\r\nmud being generally two or three feet deep, and it is only here and\r\nthere that a footing can be secured, in the embankment surrounding the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nLet me now describe the mode of cultivating these anomalous islands,\r\nfloating as it were in the ocean, and deriving benefit both from it\r\nand the mighty river itself, whose offspring they are. Should the\r\nriver during the high season have thrown up a _bhull_, the Zemindar\r\nselecting it for cultivation, first surrounds it with a low bund of\r\nmud, which is generally about three feet in height. When the river has\r\nreceded to its cold weather level, and the _bhull_ is free of fresh\r\nwater (for be it remembered, that these _bhulls_ being formed during\r\nthe inundation, are often considerably removed from the river branches\r\nduring the low season), he takes advantage of the first high spring\r\ntide, opens the bund and allows the whole to be covered with the salt\r\nwater. This is generally done in December. The sea water remains on\r\nthe land for about nine weeks, or till the middle of February, which\r\nis the proper time for sowing the seed. The salt water is now let out,\r\nand as the ground cannot, on account of the mud, be ploughed,\r\nbuffaloes are driven over every part of the field, and a few seeds of\r\nthe rice thrown into every footmark; the men employed in sowing being\r\nobliged to crawl along the surface on their bellies, with the basket\r\nof seed on their backs; for were they to assume an upright position,\r\nthey would inevitably be bogged in the deep swamp. The holes\r\ncontaining the seed are not covered up, but people are placed on the\r\nbunds to drive away birds, until the young grain has well sprung up.\r\nThe land is not manured, the stagnant salt water remaining on it being\r\nsufficient to renovate the soil. The rice seed is steeped in water,\r\nand then in dung and earth for three or four days, and is not sown\r\nuntil it begins to sprout. The farmer has now safely got over his\r\nsowing, and as this rice is not as in other cases transplanted, his\r\nnext anxiety is to get a supply of fresh water; and for this he\r\nwatches for the freshes which usually come down the river about the\r\nmiddle and end of February, and if the river then reaches his _bhull_,\r\nhe opens his bund, and fills the enclosure with the fresh water. The\r\nsooner he gets this supply the better, for the young rice will not\r\ngrow in salt water, and soon withers if left entirely dry.\r\n\r\nThe welfare of the crop now depends entirely on the supply of fresh\r\nwater. A very high inundation does not injure the _bhull_ cultivation,\r\nas here the water has free space to spread about. In fact the more\r\nfresh water the better. If, however, the river remains low in June,\r\nJuly, and August, and the south-west monsoon sets in heavily on the\r\ncoast, the sea is frequently driven over the _bhulls_ and destroys the\r\ncrops. It is in fact a continual struggle between the salt water and\r\nthe fresh. When the river runs out strong and full, the _bhulls_\r\nprosper, and the sea is kept at a distance. On the other hand, the\r\nsalt water obtains the supremacy when the river is low, and then the\r\nfarmer suffers. In this manner much _bhull_ crop was destroyed in the\r\nmonsoons of 1851 and 1852, during the heavy gales which prevailed in\r\nthose seasons. The rice is subject to attacks also of a small black\r\nsea crab, called by the natives _Kookaee_, and which, without any\r\napparent cause, cuts down the growing grain in large quantities, and\r\noften occasions much loss.\r\n\r\nThe crop when ripe, which, if all goes well will be about the third\r\nweek in September, is reaped in the water by men, either in boats, or\r\non large masses of straw rudely shaped like a boat, and which being\r\nmade very tight and close, will float for a considerable time. The\r\nrice is carried ashore to the high land, where it is dried, and put\r\nthrough the usual harvest process of division, &c.: and the _bhull_ is\r\nthen on the fall of the river again ready for its annual pickling.\r\n\r\nThe process of preparing the field for rice culture, in the Kandian\r\ncountry, Ceylon, is very simple.\r\n\r\nWhen the paddy is to be cultivated in mud, a piece of ground is\r\nenclosed in a series of squares or terraces, by ridges raised with mud\r\nand turf; a quantity of water is directed into the field from an\r\nadjacent stream or tank, and is allowed to remain on it for fifteen\r\ndays; at the expiration of this time the field is ploughed with a yoke\r\nof buffaloes, which operation is repeated at the end of fifteen days\r\nmore, when, by the rotting of the weeds and other matter, the field\r\nhas become manured. After another interval of fifteen days the field\r\nis again ploughed and the broken ridges are repaired. Eight days after\r\nthe field is harrowed, and subsequently rolled or levelled; and when\r\nthe water has been let out the seed is sown, having in most instances\r\nbeen previously made to germinate, by being spread on platforms and\r\nkept wet.\r\n\r\nThe water is turned in during night, to prevent crabs and insects from\r\ndestroying the seedlings, and let out during the day; and this they\r\ncontinue to do till the plants attain the height of one foot. Water is\r\nonly retained in the field until the ears are half ripe, otherwise\r\nthey would ripen indifferently and be destroyed by vermin. A variety\r\nof coast paddy, called \"moottoo samboo,\" was introduced into the\r\nKandian province in 1832, which was found to produce a more abundant\r\ncrop, by one third, than the native. It is of six months growth.\r\n\r\nIn Kashmir rice is the staple of cultivation, and the practice adopted\r\nthere is thus described by a writer in my \"Colonial Magazine,\" vol. x.\r\np. 130. It is sown in the beginning of May, and is fit to cut about\r\nthe end of August. The grain is either sown broadcast in the place\r\nwhere it is intended to stand till it is ripe, or thickly in beds,\r\nfrom which it is transplanted when the blade is about a foot high. As\r\nsoon as the season will admit after the 21st of March, the land is\r\nopened by one or more ploughings, according to its strength, and the\r\nclods are broken down by blows with wooden mattocks, managed in\r\ngeneral by women, with great regularity and address; after which water\r\nis let in upon the soil, which for the most part of a reddish clay, or\r\nfoxy earth, is converted into a smooth soft mud. The seed grain, put\r\ninto a sack of woven grass, is submerged in a running stream until it\r\nbegins to sprout, which happens sooner or later, according to the\r\ntemperature of the water and of the atmosphere, but ordinarily takes\r\nplace in three or four days. This precaution is adopted for the\r\npurpose of getting the young shoots as quickly as possible out of the\r\nway of a small snail, which abounds in some of the watered lands of\r\nKashmir, but sometimes proves insufficient to defend it against the\r\nactivity of this destructive enemy. When the farmer suspects, by the\r\nscanty appearance of the plants above the water in which the grain has\r\nbeen sown, and by the presence of the snail drawn up in the mud, that\r\nhis hopes of a crop are likely to be disappointed, he repeats the\r\nsowing, throwing into the water some fresh leaves of the Prangos\r\nplant, which either poison the snails or cause them to descend out of\r\nthe reach of its influence. The seed is for the most part thrown\r\nbroadcast into about four or five inches of water, which depth is\r\nendeavoured to be maintained. Difference of practice exists as to\r\nwatering, but it seems generally agreed that rice can scarcely have\r\ntoo much water, provided it be not submerged, except for a few days\r\nbefore it ripens, when a dried state is supposed to hasten and to\r\nperfect the maturity, whilst it improves the quality of the grain. In\r\ngeneral the culture of rice is attended with little expense, although\r\ndearer in Kashmir than Hindostan, from its being customary in the\r\nformer country to manure the rice-lands, which is never done in the\r\nlatter. This manure, for the most part, consists of rice straw\r\nrejected by the cattle, and mixed with cow-dung. It is conveyed from\r\nthe homestead to the fields by women, in small wicker baskets, and is\r\nset on the land with more liberality than might have been expected\r\nfrom the distance it is carried. Many of the ripe lands are situated\r\nmuch higher than might be thought convenient in Hindostan, and are\r\nrather pressed into this species of culture than naturally inviting,\r\nbut still yield good crops, through the facility with which water is\r\nbrought upon them from the streams which fall down the face of the\r\nneighbouring hills. In common seasons the return of grain is from\r\nthirty to forty for one, on an average, besides the straw.\r\n\r\nThe rice of Bengal, by the exercise of some care and skill, has\r\nrecently been so far improved as nearly to equal that of the\r\nCarolinas. Dr. Falconer has introduced into India the numerous and\r\nfine varieties of rice cultivated in the Himalayas; of these some of\r\nthe best sorts were at his suggestion distributed to cultivators along\r\nthe Doab canal.\r\n\r\nA species of hill rice grows on the edge of the Himalaya mountains.\r\nThe mountain rices of India are grown without irrigation, at\r\nelevations of 3,000 to 6,000 feet on the Himalaya, where the dampness\r\nof the summer months compensates for the want of artificial moisture.\r\nThe small reddish Assamese rices, which become gelatinous in boiling,\r\nand the large, flat-grained, soft, purple-black Ketana rice, of Java\r\nand Malacca, shown at the Great Exhibition, were curious.\r\n\r\nThe fertility of the province of Arracan is very great, its soil being\r\nfit for the culture of nearly all tropical productions; rice, however,\r\nis alone cultivated to any great extent; the low alluvial soil which\r\nextends over the whole country, from the foot of the mountains to the\r\nsea, being admirably suited for its growth. About 115 square miles are\r\nunder culture with rice. The export trade in rice of the district, is\r\nseen by the following statistical return; and it gives employment to\r\nfrom 400 to 700 vessels, aggregating 60,000 to 80,000 tons.\r\n\r\n   QUANTITY OF PADDY AND RICE EXPORTED FROM AKYAB, THE PORT OF ARRACAN.\r\n  -------+---------+-------+---------+----------------------------------\r\n         |         |       |         |Average price per 100 baskets\r\n         |         |       |  Total  |   of 12 seers, in Rupees\r\n         |Maunds of|Maunds |  value  +------------------+---------------\r\n         |  Paddy  |of rice| Rupees  |     Rice         |     Paddy\r\n  -------+---------+-------+---------+------------------+---------------\r\n  1831-32|  380,600| 28,970|  130,591|   15.4 to 16.6   | 8   to  9\r\n  1832-33|  502,740|175,560|  232,915|   16      17     | 7.5     8\r\n  1833-34|  555,540|418,950|  430,830|   19      20     | 9      10\r\n  1834-35|  127,050|260,650|  176,717|   18      19     | 8       9\r\n  1835-36|  783,870|548,460|  354,791|   10      11     | 5       5.8\r\n  1836-37|1,737,841|641,010|  666,732|   10.8    12     | 5       6\r\n  1837-38|1,621,566|248,783|  650,385|   21      23     | 9      10.8\r\n  1838-39|1,364,100|332,380|  821,168|   24      25.1   | 8.8    11.12\r\n  1839-40|2,033,698|529,961|1,121,311|   21.8    23     | 9.8    10\r\n  1840-41|2,212,068|446,941|1,131,087|   20      21.8   |10      11\r\n  1841-42|1,265,388|270,000|  553,014|   19      20     | 8       9\r\n  1842-43|1,310,900|393,900|  472,889|   14      15     | 7.8     8\r\n  1843-44|  848,922|707,780|  633,710|   17      18     | 7       8\r\n  -------+---------+-------+---------+------------------+----------------\r\n  (\" Colonial Magazine,\" vol. vi., p. 348.)\r\n\r\n\r\n            EXPORT OF RICE FROM MOULMEIN\r\n\r\n                     Baskets           Value\r\n       1840           67,318           38,708\r\n       1841           11,175            6,900\r\n       1842           64,055           40,034\r\n       1843           35,635           35,289\r\n       1844           71,822           44,529\r\n       1845          149,815           73,034\r\n       1846          193,267          101,465\r\n\r\n  --(Simmonds's \"Colonial Magazine,\" vol. xii., p. 462.)\r\n\r\nFrom Tavoy and Mergui rice was also exported, equal in value to 41,000\r\nrupees, in 1846; 100 baskets of 12 seers each, are equal to 30 Bengal\r\nmaunds. The basket of rice named above, is equal to 55½ lbs. English.\r\n\r\nPaddy means rice in the husk--rice, the grain when unhusked--a\r\ndistinction to be kept in mind.\r\n\r\nThe daily average consumption of rice in a family of five, is rated in\r\nthe Straits' settlements at three and a quarter chupahs.\r\n\r\nThe Burmese and Siamese are the grossest consumers of rice. A common\r\nlaboring Malay requires monthly 30 chupahs, or 56 pounds of rice,\r\nvalue 3s. 9d. or 4s. The Burmese and Siamese about 34 chupahs, or 64\r\npounds. Rice land in Penang yields a return which cannot be averaged\r\nhigher than seventy-five fold--or nearly thirty guntangs of paddy for\r\neach orlong (1-1/3 acres); but it has been considered advisable to rate\r\nit here at sixty fold only.\r\n\r\nThe rice land of Province Wellesley gives an average return of 117½\r\nfold; the maximum degree of productiveness being 600 guntangs of paddy\r\nto an orlong of well flooded, alluvial land, or 150 fold, equal to 300\r\nguntangs of clean rice, weighing nearly 4,520 English pounds. The\r\npresent average produce has been very moderately estimated at 470\r\nguntangs the orlong of paddy. The quantity of seed invariably allotted\r\nfor an orlong of land is four guntangs. In Siam forty fold is\r\nestimated a good average produce. At Tavoy, on the Tenasserim coast,\r\nthe maximum rate of productiveness of the rice land was, in 1825, and\r\nis still believed to be, nearly the same as the average of Siam; while\r\ntheir _average_ was only twenty-fold.--(Low, on \"Straits\r\nSettlements.\")\r\n\r\nRice in Cochin-China is the \"staff of life,\" and forms the main\r\narticle of culture. There are six different sorts grown; two on the\r\nuplands, used for confectionery, and yielding only one crop annually;\r\nthe other sorts affording from two to five crops a year; but generally\r\ntwo, one in April and another in October; or three when the\r\ninundations have been profuse.\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. Gutzlaff stated, at a meeting of the Statistical Society\r\nof London, that the population of China was about 367,000,000, and the\r\nreturns of the land subject to tax as used in rice cultivation there,\r\ngave nearly half an acre to each living person; and he further stated\r\nthat in the southern and well watered provinces, it is anything but\r\nuncommon to take two crops of rice, one of wheat, and one of pulse,\r\nfrom the same land in a single season. Rice is the only article the\r\nChinese ever offer a bounty for; the price fluctuates according to the\r\nseasons, from one and three-quarter dollars to eight dollars per\r\npicul. Siam and the Indian Islands, particularly Bali and Lombok,\r\nsupply the empire occasionally with large quantities.\r\n\r\nThe price of rice in China varies according to the state of the canals\r\nleading to the interior; if they are full of water the prices rise; if\r\non the contrary they are low, prices fall in proportion at the\r\nproducing districts. The amount of consumption is controlled, in a\r\nconsiderable degree, by the cost of transit; when this is cheap prices\r\nrise from the general demand; but when land-carriage to any extent has\r\nto be resorted to, they fall; it raises prices so much at any great\r\ndistance, that rice must be used very sparingly, from its enhanced\r\nprice. It is obvious that if the waters are sufficiently high to allow\r\na boat to pass fully loaded, she does so at an expense of nearly 50\r\nper cent, less than she would do, if, from want of water, she could\r\nonly take half the quantity; when transport is cheap every one obtains\r\na full supply; when it is dear the rice districts have more than they\r\ncan consume.\r\n\r\nAt home we are so much accustomed to the facilities of transit offered\r\nby railroads, canal boats, &c., that we do not readily take into\r\nconsideration, that in China, except by water, all articles are\r\nconveyed from one place to another on men's shoulders. Taking the\r\npopulation of Canton at the usual estimate of a million, and allowing\r\nto each a catty a day, the quantity of rice required for one day's\r\nconsumption alone in that city would be 10,000 piculs, of 133 lbs.\r\neach = 1,340,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nJava is the granary of plenty for all the Eastern Archipelago; and the\r\nDutch East India Company occupies itself in this culture with\r\nsolicitude, well persuaded that a scarcity of rice might be fatal to\r\nits power. Ordinances to encourage and increase this branch of\r\nagriculture, have been promulgated at different times by an authority\r\ncalled to watch over the physical well-being of many millions of\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nAs an evident proof that the culture of rice, of which it would be\r\ndifficult to fix the quantity produced annually, increases\r\nconsiderably, I may mention that the exportation from Java, in 1840,\r\nwas 1,488,350 piculs of 125 Dutch lbs.\r\n\r\nRice is cultivated in Java in three systems. The name of _sawah_ is\r\ngiven to the rice fields, which can be irrigated artificially;\r\n_tepar_, or _tagal_, are elevated but level grounds; and _gagah_, or\r\n_ladang_, are cleared forest grounds. The two last only give one crop;\r\na second crop may be obtained from the _sawah_, which then most\r\ncommonly consists of _katjang_, from which oil is extracted, in\r\n_kapus_ or fine cotton, and in _ubie_, a kind of potato.\r\n\r\nThere are, says Mr. Crawfurd, two distinct descriptions of rice\r\ncultivated throughout the Indian islands, one which grows without the\r\nhelp of immersion in water, and another for which that immersion is\r\nindispensably requisite. In external character there is very little\r\ndifference between them, and in intrinsic value not much. The marsh\r\nrice generally brings a somewhat higher price in the market. The great\r\nadvantage of this latter consists in its superior fecundity. Two very\r\nimportant varieties of each are well known to the Javanese husbandman,\r\none being a large productive, but delicate grain, which requires about\r\nseven months to ripen, and the other a small, hardy, and less fruitful\r\none, which takes little more than five months. The first we constantly\r\nfind cultivated in rich lands, where one annual crop only is taken;\r\nand the last in well watered lands, but of inferior fertility, where\r\ntwo crops may be raised.\r\n\r\nBoth of these, but particularly the marsh rice, is divided into a\r\ngreat number of sub-varieties, characterised by being awned or\r\notherwise, having a long or round grain, or being in color black, red,\r\nor white. The most singular variety is the _O. glutinosa_, of\r\nRumphius. This is never used as bread, but commonly preserved as a\r\nsweetmeat. The rudest, and probably the earliest practised mode of\r\ncultivating rice, consists in taking from forest lands a fugitive\r\ncrop, after burning the trees, grass, and underwood. The ground is\r\nturned up with the mattock, and the seed planted by dibbling between\r\nthe stumps of trees. The period of sowing is the commencement of the\r\nrains, and of reaping that of the dry season. The rice is of course of\r\nthat description which does not require immersion.\r\n\r\nThe second description of tillage consists also in growing mountain or\r\ndry land rice. This mode is usually adopted on the common upland\r\narable lands, which cannot conveniently be irrigated. The grain is\r\nsown in the middle of the dry season, either broadcast or by dibbling,\r\nand reaped in seven or five months, as the grain happens to be the\r\nlarger or the smaller variety.\r\n\r\nThe culture of rice by the aid of the periodical rains forms the\r\nthird mode. The grain being that kind which requires submersion, the\r\nprocess of sowing and reaping is determined with precision by the\r\nseasons. With the first fall of the rains the lands are ploughed and\r\nharrowed. The seed is sown in beds, usually by strewing very thickly\r\nthe corn in the ear. From these beds the plants, when 12 or 14 days\r\nold, are removed into the fields and thinly set by the hand. They are\r\nthen kept constantly immersed in water until within a fortnight of the\r\nharvest, when it is drawn off to facilitate the ripening of the grain.\r\n\r\nThe fourth mode of cultivating rice is by forcing a crop by artificial\r\nirrigation, at any time of the year; thus, in one field, in various\r\nplots, the operations of sowing, ploughing, transplanting, and reaping\r\nmay be seen at the same period.\r\n\r\nThe fertile, populous, and industrious countries of the Eastern\r\nArchipelago export rice to their neighbours. The most remarkable of\r\nthese are Java, Bali, some parts of Celebes, with the most fertile\r\nspots of Sumatra, and of the Malay Peninsula. Rice is generally\r\nimported to these western countries from those farther east, such as\r\nthe Spice Islands. Java is the principal place of production for the\r\nconsumption of the other islands, and the only island of the\r\nArchipelago that sends rice _abroad_. The rice of the eastern\r\ndistricts is generally superior to that of the western. The worst rice\r\nis that of Indramayu, which is usually discolored. The subdivision of\r\nthe province of Cheribon, called Gabang, yields rice of fine white\r\ngrain, equal to that of Carolina. The rice of Gressie preserves best.\r\nAll Indian rice is classed, in commercial language, into the three\r\ndescriptions of table rice, white rice, and cargo rice. From the\r\nlimited demand for the first, it is only to be had in Java, in small\r\nquantity. For the same reason the second is not procurable in large\r\nquantity, unless bespoken some time before-hand; but the third may be\r\nhad at the shortest notice in any quantity required. Java rice is\r\ninferior in estimation to that of Bengal or Carolina in the markets of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe following statistics show the extent and progress of the culture\r\nin Java:--\r\n\r\n                                                          In 1840.

These results have been obtained by the attention paid to\r\nthe proper irrigation of the soil fit for this culture; and to the\r\nhydraulic works which the Government executes on its own account in\r\nthe parts of the island where rice fields can be established, and\r\nwhere they are required to feed a population whose number is still\r\nincreasing yearly.\r\n\r\nI have seen, continues Mr. Crawfurd, lands which have produced, from\r\ntime beyond the memory of any living person, two yearly crops of rice.\r\nWhen this practice is pursued, it is always the five-months grain\r\nwhich is grown. The rapid growth of this variety, has, indeed, enabled\r\nthe Javanese husbandman, in a few happy situations, to urge the\r\nculture to the amount of six crops in two years and a half. Rice\r\ncultivated in a virgin soil, where the wood has been burnt off, will,\r\nunder favorable circumstances, give a return of twenty-five and thirty\r\nfold. Of mountain rice, cultivated in ordinary upland arable lands,\r\nfifteen fold may be looked upon as a good return. In fertile soils,\r\nwhen one crop only is taken in the year, marsh rice will yield a\r\nreturn of twenty-five seeds. When a double crop is taken, not more\r\nthan fifteen or sixteen can be expected. In the fine province of Kadu,\r\nan English acre of good land, yielding annually one green crop and a\r\ncrop of rice, was found to produce of the latter 641 lbs. of clean\r\ngrain. In the light sandy, but well watered lands of the province of\r\nMataram, where it is the common practice to exact two crops of rice\r\nyearly without any fallow, an acre was found to yield no more than 285\r\nlbs. of clean rice, or an annual produce of 570 lbs. --(\"History of\r\nthe Indian Archipelago.\")\r\n\r\nThe low estimation of Java rice is not attributable to any real\r\ninferiority in the grain, but to the mode of preparing it for the\r\nmarket. In husking it, it is, for the want of proper machinery, much\r\nbroken, and, from carelessness in drying, subject to decay from the\r\nattack of insects and worms. When in the progress of improvement more\r\nintelligent methods are pursued in preparing the grain for the market,\r\nit will equal the grain of any other country. Machinery must be\r\nemployed for husking the grain, and some degree of kiln drying will be\r\nnecessary to ensure its preservation in a long voyage.\r\n\r\nI know nowhere that rice is so cheap as in Java, except in Siam,\r\nwhence it is exported at one-third less cost. A great deal of rice is\r\nexported from Siam to China by the junks, and also occasionally a\r\nlittle from Java.\r\n\r\n  The quantity exported from Java in 1830      was      13,521 coyans.\r\n\r\n              \"          \"           1835       \"       25,577    \"\r\n\r\n              \"          \"           1839       \"    1,103,378 piculs\r\n\r\n              \"          \"           1841       \"      676,213    \"\r\n\r\n              \"          \"           1843       \"    1,108,774    \"\r\n\r\nRice is grown to some extent in the Dutch portion of Celebes; it\r\nyields at a minimum one hundred and fifty fold. The average annual\r\ndelivery of rice to the Government, from 1838 to 1842, was 3,390,119\r\nlbs. At present the Government pays sixty cents for a measure of forty\r\npounds. That which is sold for the consumption of the inhabitants may\r\nbe procured at the public warehouse for a guilder the 35½ lbs.; and\r\nthat which is sold for export may be had at public auction for 125\r\nflorins the coyan of 3,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe following description of some varieties of rice cultivated in the\r\nPhilippine islands, is given by Mr. Rich, botanist to the United\r\nStates Exploring Expedition. The varieties are very numerous; the\r\nnatives distinguish them by the size and shape of their grain:--\r\n\r\n    _Binambang_.--Leaves slightly hairy; glumes whitish; grows to the\r\n    height of about five feet; flowers in December: aquatic.\r\n\r\n    _Lamuyo_ greatly resembles the above; is more extensively\r\n    cultivated, particularly in Batangas, where it forms the principal\r\n    article of food of the inhabitants of the coast: aquatic.\r\n\r\n    _Malagcquit_.--This variety derives its name from its being very\r\n    glutinous after bailing; it is much used by the natives in making\r\n    sweet or fancy dishes; and also used in making a whitewash, mixed\r\n    with lime, which is remarkable for its brilliancy, and for\r\n    withstanding rain, &c.: aquatic.\r\n\r\n    _Bontot Cabayo_.--Common in Ilocos, where it is cultivated both\r\n    upland and lowland; it produces a large grain, and is therefore much\r\n    esteemed, but has rather a rough taste.\r\n\r\n    _Dumali, or early rice_.--This rice is raised in the uplands\r\n    exclusively, and derives its name from ripening its grain three\r\n    months from planting; the seed is rather broader and shorter than\r\n    the other varieties; it is not extensively cultivated, as birds and\r\n    insects are very destructive to it.\r\n\r\n    _Quinanda_, with smooth leaves.--This variety is held in great\r\n    estimation by the people of Batangas, as they say it swells more in\r\n    boiling than any other variety; it is sown in May, and gathered in\r\n    October: upland.\r\n\r\n    _Bolohan_.--This variety has very hairy glumes; it is not held in\r\n    much esteem by the natives, but it is cultivated on account of its\r\n    not being so liable to the attacks of insects and diseases as most\r\n    of the other upland varieties.\r\n\r\n    _Malagcquit_.--With smooth leaves, and red glumes (all the preceding\r\n    are whitish); possesses all the qualities of the aquatic variety of\r\n    the same name--that of being very glutinous after boiling. This rice\r\n    is said to be a remedy for worms in horses, soaked in water, with\r\n    the hulls on; it is given with honey and water.\r\n\r\n    _Tangi_.--Leaves slightly hairy, glumes light violet color. This\r\n    upland variety is held in much esteem for its fine flavor.\r\n\r\n435,067 arrobas of rice were exported from Manilla in 1847.\r\n\r\nA simple but rude mill is in use in Siam, and many parts of India, for\r\nhulling paddy, which is similar to those used 4,000 years ago. It\r\nconsists of two circular stones, two feet in diameter, resting one on\r\nthe other; a bamboo basket is wrought around the upper one, so as to\r\nform the hopper. A peg is firmly set into the face of the upper stone,\r\nhalf way between its periphery and centre, having tied to it by one\r\nend a stick three feet long, extended horizontally, and attached by\r\nthe other to another stick pending from the roof of the shed under\r\nwhich the mill is placed. This forms a crank, by which the upper stone\r\nis made to revolve on the other set firmly on the ground. The motion\r\nthrows the rice through the centre of the stone, and causes it to\r\nescape between the edges of the two.\r\n\r\nMore starch is contained in this grain than in wheat. Braconnet\r\nobtained from Carolina rice 85.07, and from Piedmont rice 83.8 per\r\ncent. of starch. Vogel procured from a dried rice no less than 98 per\r\ncent. of starch. There are several patent processes in existence for\r\nthe manufacture of rice-starch, which are accomplished chiefly by\r\ndigesting rice in solutions, more or less strong, of caustic alkali\r\n(soda), by which the gluten is dissolved and removed, leaving an\r\ninsoluble matter composed of starch, and a white substance technically\r\ncalled fibre. Under Jones's patent, the alkaline solution employed\r\ncontains 200 grains of real soda in every gallon of liquor, and 150\r\ngallons of this liquor are requisite to convert 100 lbs. of rice into\r\nstarch. In manufacturing rice-starch on a large scale, Patna rice\r\nyields 80 per cent, of marketable starch, and 8.2 per cent. of fibre,\r\nthe remaining 11.8 per cent. being made up of gluten, gruff, or bran,\r\nand a small quantity of light starch carried off in suspension by the\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nJones's process may be thus described:--100 lbs. of rice are macerated\r\nfor 24 hours in 50 gallons of the alkaline solution, and afterwards\r\nwashed with cold water, drained, and ground. To 100 gallons of the\r\nalkaline solution are then to be added 100 lbs. of ground rice, and\r\nthe mixture stirred repeatedly during 24 hours, and then allowed to\r\nstand for about 70 hours to settle or deposit. The alkaline solution\r\nis to be drawn off, and to the deposit cold water is to be added, for\r\nthe double purpose of washing out the alkali and for drawing off the\r\nstarch from the other matters. The mixture is to be well stirred up\r\nand then allowed to rest about an hour for the fibre to fall down. The\r\nliquor holding the starch in suspension is to be drawn off and allowed\r\nto stand for about 70 hours for the starch to deposit. The waste\r\nliquor is now to be removed, and the starch stirred up, blued (if\r\nthought necessary), drained, dried, and finished in the usual way.[44]\r\nRice is imported into this country in bags of 1½ cwt., and tierces of\r\n6 cwt., not only for edible purposes, but, when ground into flour, for\r\ncotton manufactures, in aiding to form the weaver's dressings for\r\nwarps. Rice-meal is commonly used for feeding pigs.\r\n\r\n                        Imported.\r\n                 British                           Retained for home\r\n               Plantation.

The aggregate imports range from 40,000 to 80,000 tons\r\nannually, of which about 500 to 800 tons are in the husk.\r\n\r\nAmong culmiferous plants and legumes used in the East, are the\r\n_Panicum italicum_, _P. miliaceum_, _Eleusine coracana_ (the meal of\r\nwhich is baked and eaten in Ceylon under the name of Corakan flour),\r\nand _Paspalum_ of several varieties. The pigeon pea (_Cytisus Cajan_),\r\nand a very valuable and prolific species of bean, called the Mauritius\r\nblack bean (_Mucuna utilis_), growing even in the poorest soil, is\r\ncultivated in India and Ceylon. _Sorghum vulgare_ is the principal\r\ngrain of Southern Arabia, and the stems are also used extensively for\r\nfeeding cattle. The plant bears its Indian name of joar, or juri, and\r\nis cultivated throughout Western Hindostan. Job's tears (_Croix\r\nlachryma_) is another cereal grass, native of the East Indies.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILLET.\r\n\r\nMillet of different kinds is met with in the hottest parts of Africa,\r\nin the South of Europe, in Asia Minor, and in the East Indies. It is a\r\nsmall yellowish seed, growing in dense panicles or clusters, the\r\nproduce of a grassy plant with large and compact seeds, growing to the\r\nheight, in India, of seven or eight feet.\r\n\r\nThe millets, known to Europeans as _petit mais_, are tropical or\r\nsub-tropical crops. In India they hold a second rank to rice alone;\r\nand in Egypt, perhaps, surpass all other crops in importance. In\r\nWestern Africa they are the staff of life. The red and white millets\r\nshown by Austria, Russia, and the United States, at the Great\r\nExhibition, were beautiful, and Ceylon exhibited fair samples. Turkey\r\nabounds in small grains.\r\n\r\n_Panicum miliaceum_ and _P. frumentaceum_ are the species grown in the\r\nEast Indies. Loudon says there are three distinct species of millet;\r\nthe Polish, the common or German, and the Indian. _Setaria Germanica_\r\nyields German millet. The plants are readily increased by division of\r\nthe roots or by seed, and will grow in any common soil. The native\r\nWest Indian species are _P. fascisculatwm_ and _oryzoides_. Millet\r\nreceives some attention in New South Wales. In 1844 there were 100\r\nacres of land under cultivation with it, and the amount grown in some\r\nyears in this colony has been about 3,500 bushels.\r\n\r\nIn the United States millet is chiefly grown for making hay, being\r\nfound a good substitute for clover and the ordinary grasses. It is a\r\nplant which will flourish well on rather thin soils, and it grows so\r\nfast that when it is up and well set it is seldom much affected by\r\ndrought. It is commonly sown there in June, but the time of sowing\r\nwill vary with the latitude. Half a bushel of seed to the acre is the\r\nusual quantity, sown broadcast and harrowed in. For the finest\r\nquantity of hay, it is thought advisable to sow an additional quantity\r\nof three or four quarts of seed. The ordinary yield of crops may be\r\nput at from a ton to a ton and a half of hay to the acre. It should be\r\ncut as soon as it is out of blossom; if it stands later, the stems are\r\nliable to become too hard to make good hay. The variety known as\r\nGerman millet is that most common in North America. It grows\r\nordinarily to the height of about three feet, with compact heads from\r\nsix to nine inches in length, bearing yellow seed. There are some\r\nsub-varieties of this, as the white and purple-seeded.\r\n\r\nThe Italian millet, _Setaria italica_, is larger than the preceding,\r\nreaching the height of four feet in tolerable soil, and its leaves are\r\ncorrespondingly larger and thicker. The heads are sometimes a foot or\r\nmore in length, and are less compact than the German, being composed\r\nof several spikes slightly branching from the main stem. It is said to\r\nderive its specific name from being cultivated in Italy, though its\r\nnative habitat is India. It is claimed by some that this variety will\r\nyield more seed than any other, and the seed is rather larger, but the\r\nstalk is coarser, and would probably be less relished by stock.\r\n\r\nIf the greatest amount of seed is desired from the crop, it is best to\r\nsow it in drills, two to two-and-a-half feet apart, using a seed drill\r\nfor the purpose. This admits of the use of a small harrow or\r\ncultivator between the rows, while the plants are small, which keeps\r\nout the weeds. The crop will ripen more uniformly in this way than\r\nbroadcast, and enables the cultivator to cut it when there will be the\r\nleast waste. The seed shatters out very easily when it is ripe, and\r\nwhen the crop ripens unequally it cannot be cut without loss, because\r\neither a portion of it will be immature, or, if left till it is all\r\nripe, the seed of the earliest falls out. It should be closely\r\nwatched, and cut in just about the same stage that it is proper to cut\r\nwheat, while the grain may be crushed between the fingers. It may be\r\ncut with a grain cradle, and, when dry, bound and shocked like grain;\r\nbut it should be threshed out as soon as practicable, on account of\r\nits being usually much attacked by birds, many kinds of which are very\r\nfond of the seed. In particular localities they assail the crop in\r\nsuch numbers, from the time it is out of the \"milk,\" till it is\r\nharvested and carried off the field, that it is no object to attempt\r\nto ripen it. This crop is sometimes sown in drills, when it is only\r\nintended for fodder, being cut and cured in bundles, as the stalks of\r\nIndian corn are. It is best to pass it through a cutting machine\r\nbefore feeding it to stock; indeed, all millet hay will be fed with\r\nless loss in this way, than if fed to animals without cutting.\r\n\r\nThe seed is used in various European countries as a substitute for\r\nsago, for which it is considered excellent. It is likewise a valuable\r\nfood for poultry, particularly for young chickens, which from the\r\nsmallness of the grain can eat it readily, and it appears to be\r\nwholesome for them.\r\n\r\nIn some countries millet seed is ground into flour and converted into\r\nbread; but this is brown and heavy. It is, however, useful in other\r\nrespects, as a substitute for rice. A good vinegar has been made from\r\nit by fermentation, and, on distillation, it yields a strong spirit.\r\nMillet seed--the produce of _H. saccharatum_--is imported into this\r\ncountry from the East Indies for the purpose chiefly of puddings; by\r\nmany persons it is preferred to rice. It is cultivated largely in\r\nChina and Cochin-China. The stalks, if subjected to the same process\r\nthat is adopted with the sugar-cane, yield a sweet juice, from which\r\nan excellent kind of sugar may be made.\r\n\r\nMillet will grow best on light, dry soils. The ground being first well\r\nprepared, half a bushel of seed to the acre is ploughed in at the\r\ncommencement of the rains, in India. The crop ripens within three\r\nmonths from the time of sowing. The usual produce is about 16 bushels\r\nto the acre. The Canary Islands export annually about 212,400 bushels\r\nof millet.\r\n\r\n_Great Indian Millet, or Guinea Corn_.--This is a native of India (the\r\n_Sorghum vulgare_, the _Andropogon Sorghum_ of Roxburgh), which\r\nproduces a grain a little larger than mustard or millet seed. It is\r\ngrown in most tropical countries, and has peculiar local names. In the\r\nWest Indies, where it is chiefly raised for feeding poultry, it is\r\ncalled Guinea corn. In Egypt it is known as Dhurra, in Hindostan and\r\nBengal as Joar, and in some districts as Cush.\r\n\r\nIn Lower Scinde joar is very extensively cultivated, as well as bajree\r\n(_H. spicatus_). It is harvested in December and January; requires a\r\nlight soil, and is usually grown in the east, after _Cynosurus\r\ncorocanus_.\r\n\r\nGuinea corn is extensively cultivated in some parts of Jamaica. I did\r\nnot, however, find it thrive on the north side of the island. It is\r\nbest planted in the West Indies between September and November, and\r\nripens in January. It ratoons or yields a second crop, when cut. The\r\nreturns are from 30 to 60 bushels an acre, but the crops are\r\nuncertain.\r\n\r\nMr. C. Bravo tried Guinea corn at St. Ann's, Jamaica, as a green crop,\r\nsown broadcast, for fodder, and it answered admirably, the produce\r\nbeing very considerable. It was weighed, and yielded 14 tons of fodder\r\nper acre, and was found very palatable and nutritious for cattle. It\r\nwas grown on a very poor soil, which had, previously to ploughing,\r\ngiven nothing but marigolds and weeds. The luxuriant growth of the\r\ncorn completely kept under the weeds. A great number of the stalks\r\nwere measured, and they averaged 10 feet from the root to the top of\r\nthe upper leaf. It had been planted 10 weeks, and had, therefore,\r\ngrown a foot a month. Mr. Bravo is of opinion, that sown broadcast it\r\nwould answer either as a grain crop, as fodder, or ploughed in to\r\nincrease the fertility of the soil.\r\n\r\nDr. Phillips, of Barbados, being of opinion that it might be\r\nadvantageously employed as human food, requested Dr. Shier, the\r\nanalytical chemist, of Demerara, to determine in his laboratory its\r\nrichness in protein compounds (the muscle-forming part of vegetable\r\nfood) in comparison with Indian corn. He, therefore, caused a sample\r\nof each to be burned for nitrogen, when the following results were\r\nobtained:--\r\n\r\n                          Indian corn.     Guinea corn.\r\n  Water, per cent.           12.81            13.76\r\n  In ordinary state--\r\n    Nitrogen, per cent.       1.83             1.18\r\n    Protein compounds        11.51             7.42\r\n  In dry state--\r\n    Nitrogen, per cent.       2.10             1.36\r\n    Protein compounds        13.20             8.60\r\n\r\nAccording to these results, the Guinea corn is less rich in nitrogen\r\nor protein compounds than Indian corn, though not much less so than\r\nsome varieties of English wheat.\r\n\r\nIndian corn meal, analysed by Mr. Hereford, from two localities, gave\r\nin the ordinary state of dryness 11.53 and 12.48 per cent. of protein\r\ncompounds--results which come very near to that obtained by Dr. Shier.\r\n\r\n_Sorghum avenaceum_, or _Holcus avenaceus_, is a native of the Cape.\r\n\r\nSeveral species and varieties of sorghum have been introduced, and\r\nmore or less cultivated in the United States. It is often popularly\r\ntermed Egyptian corn. It is closely allied to broom corn (_S.\r\nsaccharatum_), the head being similar in structure, and the seed\r\nsimilar, except that in most varieties of sorghum, the outer covering\r\ndoes not adhere as in broom corn. The plant bears a strong\r\nresemblance, while growing, to maize or Indian corn. There is also\r\nsome similarity in the grain, and it is extensively used as food by\r\nmany oriental nations.\r\n\r\nA variety, under the name of African purple millet, was some years\r\nsince introduced into North America, and recommended for cultivation\r\nas a soiling crop; but this, as well as other varieties, do not\r\npossess any advantages over Indian corn.\r\n\r\nThe natives of Mysore reckon three kinds, known as white, green, and\r\nred. The red ripens a month earlier than the rest, or about four\r\nmonths from the time of sowing. Near Bengal, Bombay, and elsewhere, in\r\nEastern India, sowing is performed at the close of May or early in\r\nJune. A gallon and a third of seed is sown per acre, and the produce\r\naverages 16 bushels. This grain, though small, and the size of its\r\nhead diminutive, compensates for this deficiency by the great hulk\r\nand goodness of its straw, which grows usually to the height of 8 or\r\n10 feet. It is sometimes sown for fodder in the beginning of April,\r\nand is ready to cut in July. It is said to be injurious to cattle, if\r\neaten as green provender, the straw is therefore first dried, and is\r\nthen preferable to that of rice.\r\n\r\nThis grain is frequently fermented to form the basis, in combination\r\nwith goor or half made sugar, of the common arrack of the natives, and\r\nin the hills is fermented into a kind of beer or sweet wort, drank\r\nwarm.\r\n\r\n_Holcus spicatus_, the _Panicum spicatum_ of Roxburgh, is cultivated\r\nin Mysore, Behar, and the provinces more to the north. From one to\r\nfour seers are sown on a biggah of land, and the yield is about four\r\nmaunds per acre. It is sown after the heavy rains commence, and the\r\nplough serves to cover the seed. The crop is ripe in three months, and\r\nthe ears only are taken off at first. Afterwards the straw is cut down\r\nclose to the surface of the soil, to be used for thatching, for it is\r\nnot much in request as fodder. Being a grain of small price, it is a\r\ncommon food of the poorer class of natives, and really yields a sweet\r\npalatable flour. It is also excellent as a fattening grain for\r\npoultry.\r\n\r\nThe _Poa Abyssinica_is one of the bread-corns of Abyssinia. The bread\r\nmade from it is called _teff_, and is the ordinary food of the\r\ncountry, that made from wheat being only used by the higher classes.\r\nThe way of manufacturing it is by allowing the dough to become sour,\r\nwhen, generating carbonic acid gas, it serves instead of yeast. It is\r\nthen baked in circular cakes, which are white, spongy, and of a hot\r\nacid taste, but easy of digestion. This bread, carefully toasted, and\r\nleft in water for three or four days, furnishes the _bousa_, or common\r\nbeer of the country, similar to the _quas_ of Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROOM CORN.\r\n\r\nThe production of broom corn is rapidly extending, and corn brooms are\r\ndriving broom sedge, as an article for sweeping floors, out of every\r\nhumble dwelling in the United States. There are about 1,000 acres of\r\nit under culture in one county (Montgomery) alone, and it brings 30\r\ndollars per acre in the field.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Van Eppes, of Schenectady, have been engaged in the broom\r\nmanufactory business about eleven years. They have a farm of about 300\r\nacres, 200 of which are Mohawk flats. A large portion of the flats was\r\nformerly of little value, in consequence of being kept wet by a\r\nshallow stream which ran through, it, and which, together with several\r\nsprings that issue from the sandy bluff on the south side of the\r\nflats, kept the ground marshy, and unfit for cultivation. By deepening\r\nthe channel of the stream, and conducting most of the springs into it,\r\nmany acres, which were formerly almost worthless, have been made\r\nworth 125 dollars per acre. They have also, by deepening the channel,\r\nsaving the water of the springs, and securing all the fall, made a\r\nwater privilege, on which they have erected an excellent mill, with\r\nseveral run of stones, leaving besides sufficient power to carry saws\r\nfor cutting out the handles of brooms, &c.\r\n\r\nThey have about 200 acres of the flats in broom-corn. The cultivation\r\nof this article has within a few years been simplified to almost as\r\ngreat a degree as its manufacture. The seed is sown with a seed-barrow\r\nor drill, as early in the spring as the state of the ground will\r\nadmit, in rows 3½ feet apart. As soon as the corn is above ground, it\r\nis hoed, and soon after thinned, so as to leave the stalks two or\r\nthree inches apart. It is only hoed in the row, in order to get out\r\nthe weeds that are close to the plants, the remaining space being left\r\nfor the harrow and cultivator, which are run so frequently as to keep\r\ndown the weeds. The cultivation is finished by running a small, double\r\nmould-board plough, rather shallow, between the rows.\r\n\r\nThe broom corn is not left to ripen, as formerly, but is cut when it\r\nis quite green, and the seed not much past the milk. It was formerly\r\nthe practice to lop down the tops of the corn, and let it hang some\r\ntime, that the brush might become straightened in one direction. Now,\r\nthe tops are not lopped till the brush is ready to cut, which, as\r\nbefore stated, is while the corn is green. A set of hands goes\r\nforward, and lops or bends the tops to one side, and another set\r\nfollows immediately and cuts off the tops at the place at which they\r\nare bent, and a third set gathers the cut tops into carts or waggons,\r\nwhich take them to the factory. Here they are first sorted over, and\r\nparcelled out into small bunches, each bunch being made up into brush\r\nof equal length. The seed is then taken off by an apparatus with\r\nteeth, like a hatchet. The machine is worked by six horses, and cleans\r\nthe brush very rapidly. It is then spread thin to dry, on racks put up\r\nin buildings designed for the purpose. In about a week, with ordinary\r\nweather, it becomes so dry that it will bear to be packed closely.\r\n\r\nThe stalks of the corn, after the tops have been cut off, are five or\r\nsix feet high, and they are left on the ground, and ploughed in the\r\nnext spring. It is found that this keeps up the fertility of the soil,\r\nso that the crop is continued for several years without apparent\r\ndiminution. It should be observed, however, that the ground is\r\noverflowed every winter or spring, and a considerable deposit left on\r\nthe surface, which is undoubtedly equivalent to a dressing of manure.\r\n\r\nThis may be inferred from the fact that some of the flats have been in\r\nIndian corn every year for forty or fifty years, without manure, and\r\nwith good cultivation have seldom produced less than sixty bushels per\r\nacre, and with extra cultivation from eighty to ninety bushels have\r\nbeen obtained.\r\n\r\nIn case of need, the stalks would furnish a large amount of good food\r\nfor cattle. They are full of leaves which are nutritive, and whether\r\ncut and dried for winter, or eaten green by stock turned on the ground\r\nwhere they grow, would be very valuable in case of deficiency of\r\ngrass.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Van Eppes employ twenty hands during the summer; and in\r\nautumn, when the brush is being gathered and prepared, they have\r\nnearly a hundred, male and female. They are mostly Germans, who come\r\nto Schenectady with their families during the broom corn harvest, and\r\nleave when it is over.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of brooms is carried on mostly in the winter season.\r\nThe quantity usually turned out by Messrs. Van Eppes is 150,000 dozen\r\nper annum.--(\"Albany Cultivator.\")\r\n\r\n\r\nCHENOPODIUM QUINOA.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty-eight years ago this plant was introduced into Britain\r\nfrom Peru, where the seeds are used as food, under the name of petty\r\nrice. Attention was drawn to it by Loudon, in his \"Gardener's\r\nMagazine,\" in 1834, and in 1836 it was cultivated on a large scale by\r\nSir Charles Lemon. This plant and the lentil are two of the most\r\npromising exotics that have been recommended for field culture. There\r\nare two varieties of quinoa, the white and the red seeded; the red has\r\nbitter properties, and is only used for medicine. In North America the\r\nseeds of the former are used as a substitute for maize and the potato.\r\nA white meal is obtained from it, having a tinge of yellow. It\r\ncontains scarcely any gluten, but, like oatmeal, makes very good\r\nporridge and cakes. Its nutritive qualities are proved by the analysis\r\nof Dr. Voelcker (\"Journal of Agriculture of Scotland,\" October, 1850),\r\nwhich states it to yield 3.66 per cent. of nitrogen, equal to 2.87 per\r\ncent. of protein compounds. In this respect the meal appears to be\r\nsuperior to rye, barley, rice, maize, the plantain, and potato. It has\r\nlong furnished the food of millions in South America; and in Scotland\r\nand Ireland the plant would find a congenial climate and rich soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nFUNDI OR FUNDUNGI.\r\n\r\nThis is an hitherto undescribed species of African grain (probably the\r\n_Paspalum exile_), much cultivated and esteemed in Sierra Leone, and\r\nother places on the African coast, where it is known by the Foulahs,\r\nJoloffs, and other native tribes, under the local name of Hungry rice.\r\nIt is a slender grass with digitate spikes, which have much of the\r\nhabit of _Digitaria_, but which, on account of the absence of the\r\nsmall outer glume existing in that genus, Mr. Keppist, Librarian of\r\nthe Linnean Society, of London, refers to _Paspalum_. It produces a\r\nsemi-transparent cordiform grain, about the size of a mignionette\r\nseed; the ear consists of two conjugate spikes, the grain being\r\narranged on the outer edge of either spike, and alternated; they are\r\nattached by a peduncle to the husk. The èpicarp, or outer membrane, is\r\nslightly rugous.\r\n\r\nThe ground is cleared for its reception by burning down the copse wood\r\nand hoeing between the roots and stumps. It is sown in the months of\r\nMay and June, the ground being slightly opened, and again lightly\r\ndrawn together over the seeds with a hoe. In August, when it shoots\r\nup, it is carefully weeded. It ripens in September, growing to the\r\nheight of about 18 inches, and its stems, which are very slender, are\r\nbent to the earth by the mere weight of the grain. The patch of land\r\nis then either suffered to lie fallow, or is planted with yams or\r\ncassava in rotation. Experienced cultivators of this Lilliputian grain\r\nassert that manure is unnecessary, as it delights in light soils, and\r\nit is even raised on rocky situations, which are most frequent about\r\nKissy. When cut down, it is tied up in small sheafs and placed in a\r\ndry situation within the hut; for if allowed to remain on the ground\r\nand to become wet, the grains are agglutinated to their coverings. The\r\ngrain is trodden out with the feet, and is then parched or dried in\r\nthe sun, to allow the more easy removal of the chaff in the process of\r\npounding, which is performed in wooden mortars. It is afterwards\r\nwinnowed with a kind of cane fanner or mats.\r\n\r\nThis grain could be raised in sufficient quantities to become an\r\narticle of commerce, and I have no doubt would prove a valuable\r\naddition to the list of light farinaceous articles of food in use\r\namong the delicate or convalescent. In preparing this delicious grain\r\nfor food, it is first put into boiling water, in which it is\r\nassiduously stirred for a few minutes; the water is then poured off,\r\nand the Foulahs, Joloffs, &c., add to it palm oil, butter, or milk;\r\nbut Europeans and negroes connected with Sierra Leone prepare it as\r\nfollows:--To the grain cooked as above mentioned, fowl, fish, or\r\nmutton, with a piece of salt pork for the sake of flavor is added, the\r\nwhole being then stewed in a close saucepan. This makes a very good\r\ndish, and thus prepared resembles \"_Kous-kous_.\" The grain is\r\nsometimes made into puddings, with the usual condiments, and eaten\r\neither hot or cold, with milk. By the few natives of Scotland in the\r\ncolony, it is occasionally dressed as milk porridge.\r\n\r\nThe negroes also eat it in the same way as they do rice, with palaver\r\nsauce. Fundi ought to be well washed in cold water, and afterwards\r\nrewashed in boiling water. If properly prepared it will be white, and\r\nperfectly free from gritty matter.\r\n\r\nCanary-seed, obtained from _Phalaris canariensis_, is grown rather\r\nlargely in Kent, the Isle of Thanet, and other parts of the south of\r\nEngland, as much as 500 tons being annually consumed here for feeding\r\nsinging birds. The produce is three to five quarters the acre, and it\r\nis sold at about £25 the ton. We receive foreign supplies of the seed\r\nfrom Germany and the Mediterranean, and the duty on imports is 2s. 6d.\r\nper bushel.\r\n\r\n\r\nPULSE.\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of pulses and leguminous seeds extensively\r\ncultivated as food for both man and cattle, and which form an\r\nimportant article in the husbandry of tropical countries. The\r\nimportance of peas and beans is well appreciated, both by the\r\nhorticulturists and agriculturists in Europe and our temperate\r\ncolonies, where, however, they are comparatively of less importance\r\nthan the smaller pulses and grains are in various tropical countries,\r\nsuch as haricots in the Brazils and West Indies; ground or earth nuts\r\nin South America, and especially in Western Africa; beans of different\r\nkinds amongst the miners of Peru; gram (_Ervum lens_), and dholl\r\n(_Cajanus_), with innumerable varieties of beans and small lentils\r\namong the natives of India and Egypt; and the Carob bean, or St.\r\nJohn's bread (_Ceratonia siliqua_), in the Mediterranean\r\ncountries.--(\"Jury Reports.\")\r\n\r\nOf leguminous grains there are various species cultivated and used by\r\nthe Asiatics, as the _Phaseolus Mungo_, _P. Max_ and _P. radiatus_,\r\nwhich contain much alimentary matter; the earth-nut (_Arachis\r\nhypogæa_), which buries its pods under ground after flowering.\r\n\r\nThe gram (_Cicer arictinum_) which is mentioned by Dr. Christie\r\n(\"Madras Journal of Science,\" No. 13) as exuding oxalic acid from all\r\nparts of the plant. It is used by the ryots in their curries instead\r\nof vinegar. It is the chick pea of England, and _chenna_ of Hindostan.\r\n\r\nAmong the most commonly cultivated leguminous plants are the lentil\r\n(_Ervum lens_), horse gram (_Dolichos biflorus_, Linn), various\r\nspecies of _Cytisus_ and _Cajanus_, &c. Many of these are grown in\r\nIndia as fodder plants; others for their seeds, known as gram, dholl,\r\n&c. The _Cajanus flavus_, of Decandolle (_Cytisus Cajan_), is very\r\ngenerally cultivated along the Western coast of Africa, and continues\r\nto bear for three years. Several species of dolichos are used as food\r\nin various countries, as _D. ensiformus_ in Jamaica, _D. tuberosus_ in\r\nMartinique, _D. bulbosus_ and _D. lignosus_ in the East Indies.\r\n\r\nThe vessels of the North bring to Shanghae a great quantity of a dry\r\npaste, known under the name of tanping, the residuum or husk of a\r\nleguminous plant called Teuss, from which the Chinese extract oil, and\r\nwhich is used, after being pressed, as manure for the ground. Captain\r\nH. Biggs, in a communication to the Agri.-Hort. Soc. of India, in\r\n1845, states that of the esculents a large white pea forms the staple\r\nof the trade of Shanghae, or nearly so, to the astonishing amount of\r\ntwo and a-half millions sterling. This he gives on the authority of\r\nthe Rev. Mr. Medhurst, of Shanghae, and Mr. Thorns, British Consul at\r\nNingpo. These peas are ground in a mill and then pressed, in a\r\nsomewhat complicated, though, as usual in China, a most efficient\r\npress, by means of wedges driven under the outer parts of the\r\nframework with mallets. The oil is used both for eating and burning,\r\nmore for the latter purpose, however, and the cake, like large\r\nGloucester cheese, or small grindstones in circular shape, is\r\ndistributed about China in every direction, both as food for pigs and\r\nbuffaloes, as also for manure.\r\n\r\nWe import on the average about 20,000 quarters of beans, peas, &c.,\r\nfrom Ireland, 450,000 quarters of beans and 200,000 quarters of peas\r\nfrom foreign countries.\r\n\r\nThe land under cultivation with pulse, and the crops raised, have been\r\nestimated as follows:--\r\n\r\n                         Acres.          Quarters.\r\n  England               500,000          1,875,000\r\n  Ireland               130,000            540,000\r\n  Scotland               50,000            150,000\r\n                        -------          ---------\r\n                        680,000          2,565,000\r\n\r\nThis is of course exclusive of garden cultivation. The average produce\r\nof beans per acre in England is 3¾ quarters, 3½ in Ireland, and three\r\nin Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe price of beans per quarter in the last ten years has ranged from\r\n39s. to 27s. the quarter; peas from 40s. 6d. to 27s. 6d.\r\n\r\n_Algaroba beans_.--The seed pods or bean of the carob-tree (_Ceratonia\r\nsiliqua_, or _Prosopis pallida_?) a tree common in the Levant and\r\nSouth of Europe, are used as food. The pods contain a large proportion\r\nof sweet fecula, and are frequently used by singers, being considered\r\nto improve the voice. The name of St. John's Head has been applied to\r\nthem, from the supposition that they were the wild honey spoken of in\r\nScripture as the food of John the Baptist. About 40,000 quintals of\r\nthese carobs are annually exported from Crete. During the Peninsular\r\nwar, the horses of our cavalry were principally fed upon these\r\nalgaroba seeds. The pods of the West India locust tree, _Hymenæa\r\ncourbaril_, also supply a nutritious matter.\r\n\r\nThat well known sauce, Soy, is made in some parts of the East, from a\r\nspecies of the Dolichos bean (_Soja hispida_), which grows in China\r\nand Japan. In Java it is procured from the _Phaseolus radiatus_. The\r\nbeans are boiled soft, with wheat or barley of equal quantities, and\r\nleft for three months to ferment; salt and water are then added, when\r\nthe liquor is pressed and strained. Good soy is agreeable when a few\r\nyears old; the Japan soy is superior to the Chinese. Large quantities\r\nare shipped for England and America. The Dolichos bean is much\r\ncultivated in Japan, where various culinary articles are prepared from\r\nit; but the principal are a sort of butter, termed _mico_, and a\r\npickle called _sooja_.\r\n\r\n1,108 piculs of soy were shipped from Canton in 1844, for London,\r\nBritish India, and Singapore. 100 jars, or about 50 gallons of soy,\r\nwere received at Liverpool in 1850. The price is about 6s. per gallon\r\nin the London market.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SAGO PALMS, BREAD-FRUIT, &c.\r\n\r\nSago, and starchy matter allied to it, is obtained from many palms. It\r\nis contained in the cellular tissue of the stem, and is separated by\r\nbruising and elutriation. From the soft stem of _Cycas circinalis_, a\r\nkind of sago is produced in the East and West Indies. The finest is,\r\nhowever, procured from the stems of _Sagus lævis_ (_S. inermis_, of\r\nRoxburgh), a native of Borneo and Sumatra; and _Arenga saccharifera_,\r\nor _Gomutus saccharifus_, of Rumphius. The _Saguerus Rumphii_, or\r\n_Metroxylon Sagus_, which is found in the Eastern Islands of the\r\nIndian Ocean, yields a feculent matter. After the starchy substance is\r\nwashed out of the stems of these palms, it is then granulated so as to\r\nform sago. The last-mentioned palm also furnishes a large supply of\r\nsugar. Sago as well as sugar, and a kind of palm wine, are procured\r\nfrom _Caryota urens_.\r\n\r\nIn China sago is obtained from _Rhapis flabelliformis_, a dwarfish\r\npalm; and some sago is made from it for native use in Travancore,\r\nMysore, and Wynaad, and the jungles in the East Indies.\r\n\r\nThe trunk of the sago palm is five or six feet round, and it grows to\r\nthe height of about 20 feet. It can only be propagated by seed. It\r\nflourishes best in bogs and swampy marshes; a good plantation being\r\noften a bog, knee deep. The pith producing the sago is seldom of use\r\ntill the tree is fourteen or fifteen years old; and the tree does not\r\nlive longer than thirty years. Mr. Crawfurd says there are four\r\nvarieties of this palm; the cultivated, the wild, one distinguished by\r\nlong spines on the branches, and a fourth destitute of these spines,\r\nand called by the natives female sago. This and the cultivated species\r\nafford the best farina; the spiny variety, which has a slender trunk,\r\nand the wild tree, yield but an inferior quality of sago. The\r\nfarinaceous matter afforded by each plant is very considerable, 500\r\nlbs. being a frequent quantity, while 300 lbs. may be taken as the\r\ncommon average produce of each tree.\r\n\r\nSupposing the plants set at a distance of ten feet apart, an acre\r\nwould contain 435 trees, which, on coming to maturity in fifteen\r\nyears, would yield at the before-mentioned rate 120,500 lbs. annually\r\nof farinaceous matter. The sago meal, in its raw state, will keep good\r\nabout a month. The Malays and natives of the Eastern Islands, with\r\nwhom it forms the chief article of sustenance, partially bake it in\r\nearthenware moulds into small hard cakes, which will keep for a\r\nconsiderable time. In Java the word \"saga\" signifies bread. The sago\r\npalm (_Metroxylon Sagus_) is one of the smallest of its tribe, seldom\r\nreaching to more than 30 feet in height, and grows only in a region\r\nextending west to Celebes and Borneo, north to Mindanao, south to\r\nTimor, and east to Papua. Ceram is its chief seat, and there large\r\nforests of it are found. The edible farina is the central pith, which\r\nvaries considerably in different trees, and as to the time required\r\nfor its attaining proper maturity. It is eaten by the natives in the\r\nform of pottage. A farina of an inferior kind is supplied by the\r\nGomuti palm (_Borassus gomutus_), another tree peculiar to the Eastern\r\nArchipelago growing in the valleys of hilly tracts.\r\n\r\nAt so great a distance it is difficult to decide as to which of these\r\ntrees really produce the ordinary sagos of commerce, for there are\r\nseveral kinds. Planche, in an excellent memoir on the sagos, has\r\ndescribed six species, which he distinguishes by the names of the\r\nplaces from which they come. Preferring to classify them according to\r\ntheir characters, M. Mayet distinguishes only three species.\r\n\r\nThe first he denominates Ancient sago, which comes from different\r\nparts, and varies much in color. It comprehends--1st, Maldivian sago\r\nof Planche, in spherical globules, of two or three millimetres in\r\ndiameter, translucid, of an unequal pinkish white color, very hard and\r\ninsipid. 2nd, New Guinea sago, of Planche, in rather smaller globules,\r\nof a bright red color on one side, and white on the other. 3rd. Grey\r\nsago of the Moluccas or brown sago of the English; of unequal\r\nglobules, from one to three millimetres in diameter, opaque, of a dull\r\ngrey color on one side, and whitish on the other. This grey color\r\nprobably arises from long keeping and humidity. 4th. Large grey sago\r\nof the Moluccas, exactly resembling No. 3, only that the globules are\r\nfrom four to eight millimetres in diameter. 5th. Fine white sago of\r\nthe Moluccas; entirely resembling No. 3, only that it is purely white,\r\nowing to the complete edulcoration of the fecula of which it is made.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the places of origin of these sagos, they all possess\r\nthe following characters--\r\n\r\nRounded globules, generally spherical, all isolated, very hard,\r\nelastic, and difficult to break or powder. The globules put into\r\nwater, generally swell to twice their original size, but do not adhere\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n_Second sage_.--This species corresponds with the pinkish sago of the\r\nMoluccas of Planche. It is in very small globules, less regular than\r\nthose of the \"first sago,\" and sometimes stuck together to the number\r\nof two or three. Soaked in water, it swells to double its volume.\r\n\r\nThird Species.--_Tapioca sago_.---This name has been applied to a\r\nspecies of sago now abundant in commerce, because it bears the same\r\nrelation to the ancient or first sago, and even to the preceding sago,\r\nthat tapioca bears to \"Moussache,\" which is the fecula of the manioc,\r\n_Janipha manihot (Manihot utilissima_).\r\n\r\nWhilst the two preceding species of sago, whatever may have been\r\nstated to the contrary, have been neither baked nor submitted to any\r\nheating process, as is proved by the perfect state of nearly all their\r\ngrains of fecula, this species has been subjected to the action of\r\nheat while in a state of a moist paste. This sago is not in spherical\r\nglobules, like the two preceding species, or at least there are but\r\nfew of the globules of that form; it is rather in the form of very\r\nsmall irregular tubercular masses, formed by the adherence of\r\ndifferent numbers of the primary globules. The facility with which\r\nthis sago swells and is divided by water, has occasioned it to be\r\npreferred as an article of food to the ancient sago. It has been\r\ndescribed by Planche under the name of the white sago of the Moluccas,\r\nand by Dr. Pereira under the name of pearl sago.\r\n\r\nBennet, in his work on \"Ceylon and its Capabilities,\" (1843), states\r\nthat sago is procured from the granulated pith of the talipot palm,\r\n_Corypha umbraculifera_.\r\n\r\nThe _Sagus Rumphii_, Willdenow, and _S. farinifera_, Gaertner.--Before\r\nmaturity, and previous to the formation of the fruit, the stem\r\nconsists of a thin hard wall, about two inches thick, and of an\r\nenormous volume of tissue (commonly termed the _medulla_ or _pith_),\r\nfrom which the farina or sago is obtained. As the fruit forms, the\r\nfarinaceous medulla disappears, and when the tree, attains full\r\nmaturity, the stem is no more than a hollow shell. Sago occurs in\r\ncommerce in two states, pulverulent and granulated. 1. The meal or\r\nflour as imported in the form of a fine amylaceous powder. It is\r\nwhitish, with a buffy or reddish tint. Its odor is faint, but somewhat\r\nunpleasant and musty. 2. Granulated sago is of two kinds, pearl and\r\ncommon brown. The former occurs in small hard grains, not exceeding in\r\nsize that of a pin's head, inodorous, and having little taste. They\r\nhave a brownish or pinkish yellow tint, and are somewhat translucent.\r\nBy the aid of a solution of chloride of lime they can be bleached, and\r\nrendered perfectly white. The dealers, it is said, pay £7 per ton for\r\nbleaching it. Common sago occurs in larger grains, about the size of\r\npearl barley, which are brownish white.\r\n\r\nSago is an article of exportation to Europe, and is also shipped to\r\nIndia, principally Bengal, and to China. It is in its granulated form\r\nthat it is usually sent abroad. The best sago is the produce of Siak,\r\non the north coast of Sumatra. This is of a light brown color, the\r\ngrains large, and not easily broken. The sago of Borneo is the next in\r\nvalue; it is whiter, but more friable. The produce of the Moluccas,\r\nthough greatest in quantity, is of the smallest estimation. The cost\r\nof granulated sago, from the hands of the grower or producer, was,\r\naccording to Mr. Crawfurd, only a dollar a picul. It fetches in the\r\nLondon market--common pearl, 20s. to 26s. the cwt., sago flour, 20s.\r\nthe cwt. The Chinese of Malacca and Singapore have invented a process\r\nby which they refine sago, so as to give it a fine pearly lustre, and\r\nit is from thence we now principally derive our supplies of this\r\narticle. The exports from Singapore in 1847 exceeded 6½ million\r\npounds, but are now much larger.\r\n\r\nThe following is a description of the manufacture of this important\r\narticle of commerce:--The tree being cut down, the exterior bark is\r\nremoved, and the heart, or pith of the palm, a soft, white, spongy and\r\nmealy substance is gathered; and for the purpose of distant\r\ntransportation, it is put into conical bags, made of plantain leaves,\r\nand neatly tied up. In that state it is called by the Malays _Sangoo\r\ntampin_, or bundles of sago; each bundle weighs about 30 lbs.\r\n\r\nOn its arrival at Singapore it is purchased by the Chinese\r\nmanufacturers of sago, and is thus treated:--Upon being carried to the\r\nmanufactory, the plantain-leaf covering is removed, and the raw sago,\r\nimparting a strong acid odor, is bruised, and is put into large tubs\r\nof cold spring water, where it undergoes a process of purification by\r\nbeing stirred, suffered to repose, and again re-stirred in\r\nnewly-introduced water. When well purified thus, it is taken out of\r\nthe tubs by means of small vessels; and being mixed with a great deal\r\nof water, the liquid is gently poured upon a large and slightly\r\ninclined trough, about ten inches in height and width; and in the\r\ndescent towards the depressed end, the sago is deposited in the bottom\r\nof the trough, whilst the water flows into another large tub, where\r\nwhat may remain of sago is finally deposited. As the strata of\r\ndeposited sago increases in the trough, small pieces of slates are\r\nadjusted to its lower end to prevent the escape of the substance. When\r\nby this pouring process the trough becomes quite full of sago, it is\r\nthen removed to make room for a fresh one, whilst the former one is\r\nput out into the air, under cover, for a short time; and on its being\r\nwell dried, the sago within is cut into square pieces and taken out to\r\nbe thoroughly dried, under cover, to protect it from the sun. It has\r\nthen lost the acid smell already noticed, and has become quite white.\r\nAfter one day's drying thus, it is taken into what may be called the\r\nmanufactory, a long shed, open in front and on one side, and closed at\r\nthe other and in the rear. Here the lumps of sago are broken up, and\r\nare reduced into an impalpable flour, which is passed through a sieve.\r\nThe lumps, which are retained by the sieve are put back to be\r\nre-bruised, whilst that portion which has passed is collected, and is\r\nplaced in a long cloth bag, the gathered ends of which, like those of\r\na hammock, are attached to a pole, which pole being suspended to a\r\nbeam of the building by a rope, one end of it is sharply thrown\r\nforward with a particular jerk, by means of which the sago within is\r\nshortly granulated very fine, and becomes what is technically termed\r\n\"pearled.\" It is then taken out and put into iron vessels, called\r\n_quallies_, for the purpose of being dried. These quallies are small\r\nelliptical pans, and resemble in form the sugar coppers of the West\r\nIndies, and would each hold about five gallons of fluid. They are set\r\na little inclining, and in a range, over a line of furnaces, each one\r\nhaving its own fire. Before putting in the sago to be dried, a cloth,\r\nwhich contains a small quantity of hog's-lard, or some oily substance,\r\nis hastily passed into the qually, and the sago is equally quickly put\r\ninto it, and a Chinese laborer who attends it, commences stirring it\r\nwith a _pallit_, and thus continues his labor during the few minutes\r\nnecessary to expel the moisture contained in the substance. Thus each\r\nqually, containing about ten pounds of sago, requires the attendance\r\nof a man. The sago, on being taken off the fire, is spread out to cool\r\non large tables, after which it is fit to be packed in boxes, or put\r\ninto bags for shipment; and is known in commerce under the name of\r\n\"pearl sago.\" Thus the labor of fifteen or twenty men is required to\r\ndo that which, with the aid of simple machinery, might be done much\r\nbetter by three or four laborers. A water-wheel would both work a\r\nstirring machine and cause an inclined cylinder to revolve over a\r\nfire, for the purpose of drying the sago, in the manner used for corn,\r\nmeal, and flour in America, or for roasting coffee and chicory in\r\nEngland. But the Chinese have no idea of substituting artificial\r\nmeans, when manual ones are obtainable.\r\n\r\nA considerable quantity of sago is exported from Singapore in the\r\nstate of flour. The whole quantity made and exported there exceeds, on\r\nthe average, 2,500 tons annually. The quantity shipped from this\r\nentrepot is shown by the annexed returns, nearly all of which was\r\ngrown and manufactured in the settlement. The estimated value for\r\nexport is set down at 14s. per picul of 1¼ cwt.\r\n\r\n      EXPORTS FROM SINGAPORE.\r\n                           Piculs\r\n  1840-41   Pearl sago     41,146\r\n     \"      Sago flour     33,552\r\n  1841-42   Pearl sago     46,225\r\n     \"      Sago flour      7,447\r\n  1842-43   Pearl sago     25,306\r\n     \"      Sago flour      4,838\r\n  1843-44   Pearl sago     14,266\r\n     \"      Sago flour     14,067\r\n  1844-45   Pearl sago     18,472\r\n     \"      Sago flour     36,141\r\n  1845-46   Pearl sago     19,333\r\n     \"      Sago flour     26,925\r\n  1846-47   Pearl sago     40,765\r\n     \"      Sago flour      9,025\r\n\r\nImports of sago into the United Kingdom, and quantity retained for\r\nhome consumption:--\r\n\r\n            Imports.

In the West Indies and the Indian\r\nIslands, where it has been introduced from its native place, the South\r\nSea Islands, it is held in very little consideration, the graminea,\r\ntuberous roots, and farinaceous plants being more easily and readily\r\ncultivated. There are two or three varieties known in the Asiatic\r\nregions. The properties of this tree are thus enumerated by\r\nHooker:--The fruit serves for food; clothes are made from the fibres\r\nof the inner bark; the wood is used for building houses and making\r\nboats; the male catkins are employed as tinder; the leaves for table\r\ncloths and for wrapping provisions in; and the viscid milky juice\r\naffords birdlime.\r\n\r\n_A. integrifolia_is the Jack or Jacca, the fruit of which attains a\r\nlarge size, sometimes weighing 30 lbs., but is inferior in quality to\r\nthe bread-fruit.\r\n\r\nThe nuts or fruit of _Brosimum Alicastrum_, an evergreen shrub, native\r\nof Jamaica, are nutritious and agreeable articles of food. When boiled\r\nwith salt fish, pork or beef, they have frequently been the support of\r\nthe negroes and poorer sorts of white people in times of scarcity, and\r\nproved a wholesome and not unpleasant food; when roasted it eats\r\nsomething like our common chesnut, and is called bread-nut.\r\n\r\n_Kafir Bread_.--According to Thunberg, the Hottentots being very\r\nlittle acquainted with agriculture, or with the use of the cerealia,\r\nand subsisting principally upon wild bulbs and fruits, obtain food\r\nalso from _Encephalartos caffer_, a species of _Zamia_, with a\r\ncylindrical trunk, the thickness of a man's body, and about seven feet\r\nhigh. Having cut down a tree, they took out the pith, that nearly\r\nfills its trunk, and which abounds in mucilage and an amylaceous\r\nfluid; after keeping this for some time buried under ground in the\r\nskin of an animal, they reduced it by pounding and kneading into a\r\nkind of paste; and then baked it in hot ashes, in the form of round\r\ncakes, nearly an inch thick. The Dutch colonists, in consequence of\r\nthis practice of the natives, called the plant brood-boon, which\r\nsignifies literally bread tree.\r\n\r\nTHE PLANTAIN AND BANANA.\r\n\r\nThe several varieties of the edible plantain which are known and\r\ncultivated throughout the West Indies, Africa, and in the East are all\r\nreducible to two classes, viz., the Plantain and the Banana (_Musa\r\nParadisiaca_and _sapientum_). The difference between these two plants\r\nis even so slight as to be scarcely specific; it is therefore most\r\nprobable that there was originally but one stock, from which they\r\nhave, by cultivation and change of locality, been derived.\r\n\r\nThe tiger plantain (_M. maculata_) and the black ditto (_M.\r\nsylvestris_) are cultivated in Jamaica. The whole of the species and\r\nvarieties of the tribe are what are called polygamous monoecious\r\nplants, each individual tree bearing the male and female organs of\r\nreproduction.\r\n\r\nThe plantain and its varieties invariably bear male, female and\r\nhermaphrodite flowers within the same spathe, all of them being\r\nimperfect and consequently unproductive of seed. An individual may,\r\neven from excess of culture, moisture, &c., be entirely incapable of\r\nflowering. During the prevalence of a disease or blight among the\r\nplantain walks of Demerara in the years 1844 and 1845, it was\r\nseriously proposed to introduce male plantains, or obtain fresh stock\r\nby seed.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, necessary to determine with exactness, if possible,\r\nwhether the Plantain or Banana, (whichever be the parent stock) exists\r\nanywhere at present, or has been known to have existed as a perfect\r\nplant, that is bearing fertile seeds; or, whether it has always\r\nexisted in the imperfect state, that is, incapable of being procreated\r\nby seed, the only state in which it at present exists in our colonies.\r\n\r\nWhether Linnæus be right in his conjecture (Spec. Plant, 1763) that\r\nthe \"Bihai\" (_Heliconia humilis_), a native of Caraccas, which\r\nproduces fertile seeds, is the stock plant of the plantain, it is\r\nalmost impossible to ascertain; but the absence of any description of\r\na wild seed-bearing plantain, renders it highly probable that the\r\ncultivated species are hybrids produced long ago. The banana, from\r\ntime immemorial, has been the food of the philosophers and sages of\r\nthe East, and almost all travellers throughout the tropics have\r\ndescribed these plants exactly as they are known to us, either as\r\nsweet fruit eaten raw, or a farinaceous vegetable roasted or boiled.\r\nIt is remarkable that the plantain and banana should be indigenous, or\r\nat all events cultivated for ages both in the Old and New World.\r\nNumerous South American travellers describe some one of these plants\r\nas being indigenous articles of food among the natives, thus showing\r\n(if the plantain and its varieties be hybrids) a communication between\r\nthe tropics of America, Asia and Africa, long before the time of\r\nColumbus. The older writers on the colony of Guiana, as Hartsinck,\r\nBellin and others, consider the plantain to be a native. It is\r\nremarkable that Sir R. Schomburgk, during his travels, found a large\r\nspecies of edible plantain far in the interior. It appears, therefore,\r\nfrom all the investigations that have been made, that the plantain is\r\neither a hybrid, or its power of production from seed has been\r\ndestroyed long ago by cultivation, and that it is not known to exist\r\nanywhere in a perfect state; in which case any attempt to improve the\r\npresent stock by the introduction of suckers from elsewhere, must be\r\ntotally futile. Mr. A. Garnett recommends the following system of\r\ncultivation, as calculated to prevent the blight. The walk or\r\nplantation is to be formed into beds 36 feet wide, divided by open\r\ndrains 30 inches deep. Two rows of plantains to be planted upon each\r\nbed at 18 feet distance, both between and along the rows, to afford a\r\nclear ventilation to the enlarging plants, and so soon as the\r\nplantation has been established, the space of land between each row to\r\nbe shovel-ploughed 12 inches deep; the same to be repeated annually,\r\nand upon the interspace may be planted maize, yams, sugar cane, or\r\neddoes, and the whole kept clear at all times. Thus, with the\r\nconjoined principles of good tillage, free ventilation, and mixed\r\ncrops, the blight may yet be successfully combated.\r\n\r\nA great diminution in the cultivation of the plantain has been\r\noccasioned in British Guiana by this blight or disease, which first\r\nmade its destructive appearance in Essequibo, upwards of thirty years\r\nago, where its ravages increased with such fatal intensity as to\r\nrender the profitable growth of the plant almost hopeless; and up to\r\nthis hour no one has been able to discover the immediate or remote\r\ncause of this extraordinary vegetable endemic; whether arising from\r\nthe action of insects among the sheathes of the petioles of the\r\nleaves, or in the soil, or from organic decay of the plant, remains\r\nwithout solution. The last-named cause seems to be rejected, by the\r\nfact that the fructification of the plant is as healthy and abundant\r\nin parts of the colony where the blight does not prevail, both in\r\nnumber and size of the fruit upon the spike, as at any former period.\r\nOn the east coast of Demerara, both the plantain and banana have been\r\ngrown for more than twenty years upon the same land, without any\r\nattack of the disease, and without any extraneous manure or even lime\r\nhaving been applied, and the plants still exhibit great luxuriance,\r\nand produce their former weight of fruit.\r\n\r\nThe foliage of the plantain affords food and bedding, and is used for\r\nthatch, making paper, and basket making; and from its petioles is\r\nobtained a fine and durable thread. The tops of the young plants are\r\neaten as a delicate vegetable; the fermented juice of the trunk\r\nproduces an agreeable wine.\r\n\r\nThe abundance and excellence of the nutritive food which the plants of\r\nthis valuable genus supply are well known; but of the numerous uses to\r\nwhich they are applied I may mention, the following:--\r\n\r\nThe fruit is served up both raw and stewed; slices fried are also\r\nconsidered a delicacy. Plantains are sometimes boiled and eaten with\r\nsalt meat, and pounded and made into puddings, and used in various\r\nother ways. In their ripe state these fruits contain much starchy\r\nmatter. From their spurious stems, the fibres of the spiral vessels\r\nmay be pulled out in such quantity as to be used for tinder. _M.\r\ntextilis_ yields a fibre which is used in India in the manufacture of\r\nfine muslins, and the coarser woody tissue is exported in large\r\nquantities from Manila, under the name of white rope or Manila hemp.\r\nHorses, cattle, swine, and other domestic animals are fed upon the\r\nfruit, leaves, and succulent trunks.\r\n\r\nThe same extent of ground which in wheat would only maintain two\r\npersons, will yield sustenance under the banana to fifty. That eminent\r\nnaturalist and elegant writer, the Baron Von Humboldt, states\r\n(\"Political Essay on New Spain,\" vol. ii.) that an acre of land\r\ncultivated with plantains produces nearly twenty times as much food as\r\nthe like space sown with corn in Europe. He refers to a place in\r\nVenezuela, where the most careful tillage was rendered to a piece of\r\nland, yielding produce supporting a humble population residing in\r\nhuts, each placed in the centre of an enclosure, growing the sugar\r\ncane, Indian corn, the Papaw tree, and the Musa--a tropical\r\ngarden!--upon the elaborate culture of which a whole family relied for\r\nsubsistence.\r\n\r\nAlthough from the extensive plantain walks in our colonies--which are\r\nseldom cultivated with a garden-like care--so large an average\r\nproportion may not be obtained as twenty times the production of wheat\r\nin Europe, yet I have had practical experience of the prodigious\r\nquantity of farinaceous matter obtainable from an acre of tolerably\r\nwell-cultivated plantains, and no esculent plant requires less labor\r\nin its culture upon land suitable for its production. They are readily\r\nincreased by suckers, which the old plants produce in abundance.\r\n\r\nLindley enumerates ten species of Musa, some of which grow to the\r\nheight of 25 or 30 feet, but that valuable species _M. Cavendishii_,\r\ndoes not grow more than four or five feet high.\r\n\r\nThe bananas of the family of the Musaceæ, appear to be natives of the\r\nsouthern portion of the Asiatic continent (R. Brown, \"Bot. of Congo,\"\r\np. 51). Transplanted at an unknown epoch into the Indian Archipelago\r\nand Africa, they have spread also into the, New World, and in general\r\ninto all intertropical countries, sometimes before the arrival of\r\nEuropeans.\r\n\r\nAccording to Humboldt it affords, in a given extent of ground,\r\nforty-four times more nutritive matter than the potato, and 133 times\r\nmore than wheat. These figures must be considered as only\r\napproximative, since nothing is more difficult than to estimate the\r\nnutritive qualities of different aliments.\r\n\r\n_Musa paradisiaca_ is cultivated in Syria, to latitude 34 deg.\r\nHumboldt says it ceases to yield fruit at a height of 3,000 feet,\r\nwhere the mean annual temperature is 68 deg., and where, probably, the\r\nheat of summer is deficient.\r\n\r\nThe banana seems, however, to be found no higher than 4,600 feet in a\r\nstate of perfection.\r\n\r\nNo fruit is so easily cultivated as are the varieties of the plantain.\r\nThere is hardly a cottage in the tropics that is not partly shaded by\r\nthem; and it is successfully grown under other fruit trees, although\r\nit is independent of shelter. Its succulent roots and dew-attracting\r\nleaves render it useful in keeping the ground moist during the\r\ngreatest heats. The plantain may be deemed the most valuable of\r\nfruits, since it will, in some measure, supply the place of grain in\r\ntime of scarcity. To the negroes in the West Indian Islands the\r\nplantain is invaluable, and, like bread to the Europeans, is with them\r\ndenominated the staff of life. In Jamaica, Demerara, Trinidad, and\r\nother principal colonies, many thousand acres are planted with these\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation of this tree is so rapid that if a line of thread be\r\ndrawn across, and on a level with the top of one of the leaves, when\r\nit begins to expand, it will be seen, in the course of an hour, to\r\nhave grown nearly an inch. The fruit when ripe is of a pale yellow,\r\nabout a foot in length and two inches thick, and is produced in\r\nbunches so large as each to weigh 40 lbs. and upwards.\r\n\r\nThe soil best suited to the growth of the plantain is found in the\r\nvirgin land most recently taken in from the forest, having a formation\r\nof clay and decomposed vegetable substances. A large portion of\r\norganic matter is required, as well as clay or other ponderous strata,\r\nto afford the greatest production of fruit. I have known good\r\nplantains produced in the West Indies, upon land considerably\r\nexhausted by the culture of cotton, but which was enriched by the\r\napplication of a quantity of the decomposed seed of that shrub near\r\nthe roots of the young plantains.\r\n\r\nIn the Straits' settlements of the East, the following are the most\r\napproved varieties:--The royal plantain, which fruits in eight months;\r\none which bears in a year, the milk plantain, the downy plantain, and\r\nthe golden plantain or banana. A species termed _gindy_ has been\r\nlately imported from Madras, where it is in great request. It has this\r\nadvantage over the other kinds, that it can be stewed down like an\r\napple while they remain tough.\r\n\r\nThe Malays allege that they can produce new varieties, by planting\r\nthree shoots of different sorts together, and by cutting the shoots\r\ndown to the ground three successive times, when they have reached the\r\nheight of nine or ten inches.\r\n\r\nAbout 144 suckers of the plantain are set on an orlong (1-1/3 acres),\r\neach of which spreads into a group of six or eight stems, of about six\r\ninches to one foot in diameter, which yield each a bunch of fruit, and\r\nare then cut down, when fresh shoots succeed. In very rich soils the\r\nplant will continue to bear for twenty years, but otherwise it is dug\r\nup after the seventh or eighth year. The cost of cultivating 100\r\norlongs of land exclusively with plantains, will be nearly 2,000\r\nSpanish dollars until produce be obtained. About 43,200 bunches may be\r\nhad afterwards yearly, which might give a return of 2,160 dollars, or,\r\ndeducting the cost of cultivation and original expenses, a profit per\r\nannum of 1,450 dollars.\r\n\r\nThe plantain has frequently been suggested as an article of export\r\nfrom our colonies. A few bunches are occasionally brought over by the\r\nRoyal West India Mail Company's steamers running to Southampton, but\r\nmore as a curiosity than as articles of commerce.\r\n\r\nIn its ripe state no unexceptionable and sufficiently cheap method of\r\npreserving it has yet been suggested.\r\n\r\nIn some districts of Mexico it is, indeed, dried in the sun, and in\r\nthis state forms a considerable article of internal commerce under the\r\nname of \"plantado pasado.\"\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes so abundant and cheap in Demerara, Jamaica, Trinidad,\r\nand other of our colonies, that it might, if cut and dried, in its\r\ngreen state, be exported with advantage.\r\n\r\nIt is in the unripe state that it is so largely used by the peasantry\r\nof the colonies as an article of food. It has always been believed to\r\nbe highly nutritive, but Dr. Shier states that, in any sample of the\r\ndried plantain which he analysed, he could not find a larger amount\r\nthan 88 per cent of nitrogen, which corresponds with about 5½ per\r\ncent. of proteine compounds.\r\n\r\nWhen dried, and reduced to the state of meal, it cannot, like wheat\r\nflour, be manufactured into maccaroni or vermicelli, or at least the\r\nmaccaroni made from it falls to powder when put into hot water. The\r\nfresh plantain, however, when boiled whole, forms a pretty dense firm\r\nmass, of greater consistency and toughness than the potato. The mass,\r\nbeaten in a mortar, constitutes the _foo-foo_ of the negroes. The\r\nplantain meal cannot be got into this state unless by mixing it up\r\nwith water to form a stiff dough, and then boiling it in shapes or\r\nbound in cloths.\r\n\r\nPlantain meal is prepared by stripping off the husk of the plantain,\r\nslicing the core, and drying it the sun. When thoroughly dry it is\r\npowdered and sifted. It is known among the Creoles of the West Indies\r\nunder the name of _Conquin tay_. It has a fragrant odour, acquired in\r\ndrying, somewhat resembling fresh hay or tea. It is largely employed\r\nas the food of infants, children, and invalids. As food for children\r\nand convalescents, it would probably be much esteemed in Europe, and\r\nit deserves a trial on account of its fragrance, and its being\r\nexceedingly easy of digestion. In respect of nutritiveness, it\r\ndeserves a preference over all the pure starches on account of the\r\nproteine compounds it contains.\r\n\r\nThe plantain meal would probably be best and freshest were the sliced\r\nand dried plantain cores exported, leaving the grinding and sifting to\r\nbe done in Europe. The flavor of the meal depends a good deal on the\r\nrapidity with which the slices are dried; hence the operation is only\r\nfitted for dry weather, unless indeed, when there was occasion for it,\r\nresource were had to a kiln or stove. Above all, the plantain must not\r\nbe allowed to approach too closely to yellowness or ripeness,\r\notherwise it becomes impossible to dry it. The color of the meal is\r\ninjured when steel knives are used in husking or slicing, but silver\r\nor nickel blades do not injure the color. On the large scale a\r\nmachine, on the principle of the turnip slicer, might be employed. The\r\nhusking could be greatly facilitated by a very simple machine. Were\r\nthe plantain meal to come into use in England, and bear a price in any\r\nway approaching to that of Bermuda arrowroot, it would become an\r\nextensive and very profitable export. Full-sized and well-filled\r\nbunches give 60 per cent. of core to 40 of husk and top-stem, but in\r\ngeneral it would be found that the core did not much exceed 50 per\r\ncent., and the fresh core will yield 40 per cent. of dry meal, so that\r\nfrom 20 to 25 per cent. of meal is obtained from the plantain, or 5\r\nlbs. from an average bunch of 25 lbs.; and an acre of plantain walk of\r\naverage quality, producing during the year 450 such bunches, would\r\nyield a ton and 10 lbs. of meal, which, at the price of arrowroot,\r\nnamely, 1s. per lb., would be a gross return of £112 10s. per acre. A\r\nnew plantain walk would give twice as much. Even supposing the meal\r\nnot to command over half the price of arrowroot, it would still form\r\nan excellent outlet for plantains whenever, from any cause, the price\r\nin the colony sank unusually low.\r\n\r\nIn respect of the choice of a situation for establishing a plantain\r\nwalk, with a mill, boiling-house and drying ground, it will be\r\nnecessary to fix upon new land with plenty of moisture, and flat if\r\npossible, in order that there may be no difficulty in making roads to\r\ncarry the trees; whilst a deep river traversing the land, where there\r\nis no tide or danger of salt water--where facility would be afforded\r\nin making the basins wherein to wash the fibre; where a sea port would\r\nbe near at hand for shipping the produce--where workmen, provisions,\r\nand fuel would be readily obtained, and where the climate is\r\nparticularly healthy, should be especially sought after.\r\n\r\nThe plantain grows in profusion between the tropics in all parts of\r\nthe world; but as it is an object to have the London market available\r\nfor the prepared fibre, the following places may be mentioned as best\r\ncalculated to produce a good and constant supply, viz:--the West India\r\nColonies, the British Colonies in Africa, the South American\r\nRepublics, along the Mosquito shore, and other places on the Continent\r\nof America, including Porto Rico, Hayti, and Cuba. The advantages to\r\nthe paper manufacturer in employing the prepared fibre instead of\r\nrags, will be numerous, for the fibre is equal in texture, clean, and\r\naromatic; whilst rags are dirty, full of vermin, and very often\r\npestilential.\r\n\r\nA large stock of the plantain can always be secured, without fear of\r\nits being injured by keeping. The paper will be superior to that made\r\nof rags, and the process of making it will be more economical,\r\ninasmuch as the _sorting_ of the material will not be required.\r\nAnother advantage is, that a new article of commerce will be opened\r\nfor the benefit of the colonial shipping interests, and a stimulus\r\nwill be given to the cultivation of a fruit which is the favorite food\r\nof large masses of the population.\r\n\r\nThe following is a \"specification\" of articles requisite for making\r\nthree tons of prepared fibre in a day:--\r\n\r\nFour wooden boilers lined with lead, in the form of coolers, 7 feet\r\ndeep by 6 in diameter. One hydraulic press, from 400 to 500 tons. One\r\nstout screw press, to compress the fibre before it is submitted to the\r\nhydraulic press. One iron mill with horizontal cylinders. Six waggons;\r\ntwenty mules. Utensils, such as spatulas, cutlasses, hoes, rakes, &c.\r\n&c. One lever, to take out the fibre from the boilers. One steam\r\nboiler, equal to 12-horse power, to steam the four wooden boilers.\r\n\r\nIt being very desirable that the works should be in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of a river, the machinery should be worked by\r\nwater-power; but if this mode should be inconvenient, a steam engine\r\nin addition must be obtained, of about 8 or 10-horse power; or if one\r\nsteam engine of 20-horse power were employed, it would be sufficient\r\nfor all purposes. Thirty men are required to make three tons of fibre\r\nin a day.\r\n\r\n_Buildings_.--A store, 100 feet long by 25 feet broad, in wood,\r\ncovered with straw, to contain the dried fibre and the presses. One\r\nopen shed of the same dimensions, covered with straw for the boilers.\r\n\r\n_Capital required_.--It is ascertained that the following outlay will\r\nbe sufficient:--\r\n\r\n  The materials will cost        £2,000\r\n  Buildings                         500\r\n  Purchase of land                1,500\r\n  Working capital                 1,000\r\n                                 ------\r\n                                 £5,000\r\n\r\nThe estimated expense in cultivating one quarree, or 5 1-5th English\r\nacres, in plantains, will be £30, as the work can be easily performed\r\nby one laborer in 300 days, at 2s. sterling per day.\r\n\r\nA quarree will produce 18 tons of mill fibre, the cost of the\r\npreparation of which is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  For workmen's wages, soda, lime, and fuel, at £3 per ton       £54\r\n  Freight to Europe at £4 per ton                                 72\r\n  Managers                                                        30\r\n  Duty, insurance, office fees, &c., at £1 per ton                18\r\n                                                                ----\r\n                                                                £174\r\n\r\nThus, making the total expense of producing 18 tons of fibre £174, or\r\n£9 13s. 4d. per ton. In 1848 Manila rope, or plantain fibre of good\r\nquality, was worth £38 per ton.\r\n\r\nA correspondent in Jamaica, who has devoted much attention to the\r\nsubject, has furnished me with some very valuable detailed\r\ninformation, the most complete and practical that has ever yet\r\nappeared:--\r\n\r\n    _Cultivation_.--The first care of a planter in superintending the\r\n    cultivation of the banana tree, with the two-fold object of\r\n    collecting both fibre and fruit, will be to study the nature of the\r\n    tree to which he will give the preference. A number of experiments\r\n    have been made upon different species of the banana with a view of\r\n    obtaining therefrom the largest quantity and the best color of\r\n    fibre, as well as the finest fruit. Those experiments were very\r\n    tedious and minute, but were absolutely necessary, in order to\r\n    arrive at the most economical and advantageous method of rendering\r\n    the fibre into a state fit for shipment to Europe. At the same time,\r\n    it was of the utmost importance to find out the best description of\r\n    tree, for producing the strongest, the most abundant, and the most\r\n    silky fibre--for containing the least quantity of juice, for\r\n    producing the color sufficiently white to facilitate the operation\r\n    of bleaching, for bearing fruit of the most esteemed quality, and,\r\n    therefore, the most favorable for general consumption.\r\n\r\n    A banana tree, which seemed at first sight to possess all those good\r\n    qualities--being of a large size, with whitish or flaxen colored\r\n    fibre, and producing very savoury fruit, only gave 2 per cent, of\r\n    fibre after preparation; that is to say, 100 lbs. in its raw state,\r\n    only gave two pounds of fibre after it was boiled. In endeavoring to\r\n    find out the cause of such a small result, it was discovered that\r\n    this specimen of banana (commonly called the \"pig banana,\")\r\n    contained a larger proportion of water than of fibre, compared with\r\n    other sorts--that the heart was too large, and that the inside\r\n    leaves were so tender that they almost dissolved in the process of\r\n    boiling. These were the greatest inconveniences of this species of\r\n    tree. There was also another disadvantage, in the quality of its\r\n    fruit, which was yellow in color, and not so useful as those\r\n    descriptions of banana which are generally eaten as a substitute for\r\n    bread. The results of several experiments made upon various\r\n    descriptions of banana, demonstrated the properties of each species,\r\n    both as regarded fibre and fruit. The most profitable in both\r\n    respects is undoubtedly the yellow banana, or common plantain. This\r\n    tree grows to the height of about fifteen feet, it is nine or ten\r\n    inches in diameter, its fibre is firm and abundant, and its fruit is\r\n    used both in a green and ripe state. This plantain abounds on the\r\n    continent of Spanish America and between the tropics, where the\r\n    natives cultivate it as producing the most nutricious fruit of its\r\n    kind. Cargoes of the fruit are frequently exported from Surinam and\r\n    Demerara. On the Spanish part of the American continent, land is\r\n    measured by _fanegas_, each fanega containing twelve _quarrees_, and\r\n    each quarree five and one-fifth English acres. A quarree measures\r\n    one hundred geometrical paces, or three hundred square feet.\r\n\r\n    In the first instance, the suckers of the plantain (the tree being\r\n    propagated by cuttings or suckers which shoot up from the bulb),\r\n    should be set at ten feet distance from each other; this proposition\r\n    gives 300 plants on one line of trees, or 900 on the surface of one\r\n    quarree of land. Each plant propagates itself and gives upon an\r\n    average ten trees of the same size and bearing. On one quarree of\r\n    land, therefore there would be 9,000 trees, yielding four pounds of\r\n    fibre and one bunch of fruit each, which is 9,000 bunches of fruit,\r\n    and 36,000 lbs. nett of fibre, in the whole. In good ground the same\r\n    plant will last fifteen years without any further trouble. Flat\r\n    lands ought to be cultivated in preference to any other. The\r\n    plantain thrives with the root in the water, and the head to the\r\n    sun. On the borders of the river Orinoco it grows to the height of\r\n    twenty feet, is one foot in diameter, and the stalks of the branches\r\n    are three inches in circumference.\r\n\r\n    _Cutting_.--The tree which has not produced its ripe fruit ought to\r\n    be cut, for two reasons--first, that the fruit be not lost; and\r\n    secondly, that the tree will not have arrived at its full growth and\r\n    ordinary size, and the fibres will be too tender. In cutting it\r\n    down, take it off six inches above the surface of the ground, then\r\n    divide it longitudinally into four parts, take out the heart, which\r\n    must be left to serve for manure, and if fermentation is decided\r\n    upon, leave the pieces at the foot of the tree, otherwise take them\r\n    to the mill to be crushed. The tree being very tender, may, on being\r\n    bent down, be cut asunder with a single stroke of a hatchet,\r\n    cutlass, or other convenient instrument. One man can cut down 800\r\n    trees, and split them in a day.\r\n\r\n    _Carrying_.--The trees being thus divided, may be immediately\r\n    carried to the mill to be crushed, or may remain until the\r\n    fermentation separates the juice of sap from the fibres and the\r\n    pith. By fermenting the trees, their weight will be so much reduced\r\n    as to render their carriage considerably lighter than if taken away\r\n    when first cut down. A wagon, with oxen or mules, can carry about a\r\n    ton per day, and one man can load the wagon and drive the cattle.\r\n\r\n    _Crushing_.--If the tree is carried from the plantation without\r\n    being subjected to fermentation, it must be passed through a mill,\r\n    the rollers of which, if made about three feet in length, and one\r\n    foot in diameter, will be found a very convenient size. In this\r\n    operation, care should be taken, first of all, to separate the\r\n    tender from the harder or riper layers of fibre. The tree is\r\n    composed of different layers of fibre, which may be divided into\r\n    three sorts; those of the exterior, having been exposed to the\r\n    atmosphere, possess a great degree of tenacity--whilst those of the\r\n    interior, having been secluded from the air, are much more soft and\r\n    tender. If, therefore, the layers of the plantain are passed\r\n    indiscriminately through the mill, those which are hard or firm will\r\n    not be injured by the pressure, whilst those which are soft will be\r\n    almost reduced to pulp. Therefore, the rollers of the mill should be\r\n    always placed horizontally, and upon passing the trees lengthways\r\n    through the mill, the pressure will be uniform and the fibre\r\n    uninjured. In this manner, pass the different sorts of layers\r\n    separately, and the produce will be about four pounds of fibre from\r\n    each tree. The stalks of the branches of the plantain give the best\r\n    fibre, and a large quantity, as compared with the body of the tree;\r\n    100 lbs. of the stalk will give 15 lbs. nett of fibre. In general,\r\n    if a tree will give 4 lbs. nett of fibre, the stalks will give 1 lb.\r\n    out of the 4 lbs. The stalks ought also to be crushed separately,\r\n    because they are harder than the exterior layers of the tree. About\r\n    3,000 trees may be passed through the mill in a day. Whilst the\r\n    experiments were in progress it was ascertained that with a single\r\n    horse, 100 plantain trees on an average were crushed in twenty\r\n    minutes, giving five minutes rest for the horse.\r\n\r\n    _Fermentation_.--This operation may be performed in several ways. If\r\n    the trees are allowed to ferment upon the spot after being cut, a\r\n    great saving will occur in respect of _carriage_; this matter ought\r\n    to be carefully studied, because, on an extensive scale of\r\n    manufacture, it is of serious importance. It is found that the trees\r\n    when cut and heaped up, are subject to a drainage of juice, which,\r\n    having a tanning property, discolors those pieces which lie at the\r\n    bottom; hence much time is consumed in afterwards restoring the\r\n    fibre to its natural color. The cut plants should be removed from\r\n    the stumps of the trees, and then placed in heaps, shaded from the\r\n    sun by laying the leaves over them. They will take several weeks to\r\n    ferment. To pursue this process in the immediate vicinity of the\r\n    establishment, would give rise to many inconveniences, in\r\n    consequence of the very large space of ground that would thereby be\r\n    occupied. Fermentation requires a mean temperature. A tree cut down\r\n    and exposed to the sun, would be nearly dry at about 30 deg.\r\n    centigrade, showing a result quite different to that which ought to\r\n    be obtained; whilst a tree placed on a wet soil, and open for the\r\n    fresh air to circulate between the plants, covered at the same time\r\n    with its own leaves, and shaded by the foliage of the plantation,\r\n    would be decomposed at the desired point of about 22 degrees. The\r\n    different modes of fermentation require the same proportions. If the\r\n    cut plants be covered with a thick layer of earth, they will not\r\n    decompose in six _months_; but if, on the contrary, they are covered\r\n    slightly, so that they may receive the freshness of the earth, and\r\n    the heat of the air, they will decompose in six _weeks_. It is the\r\n    same with the fermentation of alkaline baths. Baths at only _one_\r\n    degree will produce decomposition, whilst baths at _three_ degrees\r\n    will not produce any decomposition. The stuff after being passed\r\n    through the mill, or after fermentation, will be put into the\r\n    chemical baths, or vats, or chemical liquor, and the persons in\r\n    charge of the mill and boilers will do this work. Fermentation may\r\n    be advantageously used, in cases where the trees are grown at a\r\n    distance from the establishment--but, where they are in the\r\n    immediate vicinity of the works, it will be best to crush them by\r\n    the mill. The principal saving that is occasioned by fermentation,\r\n    will be found in the carriage, as the substance will be much reduced\r\n    in weight by that process. In an establishment where the manufacture\r\n    is carried on upon a very large scale, trees cut down at a distance\r\n    can be fermented, whilst those produced near the mill can be\r\n    crushed.\r\n\r\n    _Chemical Agents._--For decomposing the gluten in the trees during\r\n    the process of boiling, soda, carbonate of soda, and quick lime, are\r\n    used. The proportions herein given, are those requisite for making\r\n    three tons of fibre per day, upon which scale the cost price of the\r\n    fibre in a prepared state for bleaching, is subsequently calculated.\r\n    To make three tons of fibre per day, it is necessary to have four\r\n    boilers of 800 gallons each, and give five boilings in a day, or\r\n    1,650 lbs. of nett fibre for each boiler, or 6,600 lbs. for the four\r\n    boilers per day. After having put into the boiler a sufficient\r\n    quantity of water to cover the material, wait until the water begins\r\n    to boil, and then add the chemical agents.\r\n\r\n                                                          lbs.\r\n  To the first boiling of a copper, put of soda            60\r\n  To the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th boilings of the same\r\n    copper, 15 lbs., each making                           60\r\n                                                        -----\r\n                                                          120\r\n                                                        -----\r\n  Therefore the four boilings will take of soda           480\r\n  The same liquid will serve for two other days, by\r\n    adding 15 lbs. to each fresh boiling, say, in the\r\n    whole, 40 lbs., or                                    600\r\n  It will consume in soda for nine tons made in three\r\n    days                                                1,080\r\n  Or 360 lbs. for three tons made in one day.\r\n\r\n    On the fourth day commence again in the same manner, and go on for\r\n    the two remaining days as above, producing eighteen tons in the six\r\n    days. The quick lime is to be employed in each of the boilings, in\r\n    the proportion of one-third less than the quantity of soda. Crude\r\n    soda may be used in the boilings, without previously discarbonising\r\n    it, and quick lime reduced to lime water; but, to render the action\r\n    of the chemical ingredients more quick and certain, it is better to\r\n    discarbonise the soda before it is put into the boiler. This may be\r\n    done by preparing in a small separate boiler the quantity of liquid\r\n    necessary for a day's consumption, which is prepared in about an\r\n    hour. The carbonisation is effected in the following  manner:--\r\n\r\n  Ten parts of salt of soda.           }\r\n  Six parts of quick lime.             }  In weight.\r\n  Seventy parts of water (never less.) }\r\n\r\n    _Boiling_.--This is a most important operation. By it the gluten and\r\n    coloring matter are separated from the fibres, which separation is\r\n    absolutely necessary, in order to prepare the fibre to receive the\r\n    bleaching. It is necessary to observe that the three several sorts\r\n    of layers which are found in the tree, and which, under the head of\r\n    \"crushing,\" are recommended to be _pressed_ separately, should be\r\n    also _boiled_ separately, because the outermost layer has more\r\n    coloring matter than the next under it, which again has more than\r\n    the innermost layer. As they are boiled so will they be dried and\r\n    shipped, and each sort will have a different price in the market;\r\n    that fibre which is lightest in color bearing the preference, in\r\n    consequence of its not requiring more than _six_ hours to\r\n    bleach--whilst the darkest will, probably from its greater tenacity,\r\n    take _twelve_ to _eighteen_ hours. It is advisable to place over\r\n    each boiler the means of lifting the mass of fibre when boiled, and\r\n    suffering it to drain into the boiler before it is carried away to\r\n    be washed. This is easily effected by a chain from the roof, to\r\n    which may be hung a lever, having at that end over the boiler some\r\n    hooks attached to it, whereby the mass is lifted out of the boiler,\r\n    and the liquor thus preserved for the next boiling.\r\n\r\n    _Washing_.--It is absolutely necessary that the fibre should be well\r\n    washed after being taken out of the boiler, in order that all\r\n    extraneous matter may be separated therefrom. In choosing the site\r\n    for an establishment of this kind, care must always be taken to make\r\n    choice of a spot in the immediate neighbourhood of a large river, or\r\n    other plentiful supply of fresh clean water. The machinery necessary\r\n    for cleansing and washing the fibre may be of various descriptions;\r\n    but, perhaps a selection from one of the three following sorts will\r\n    be found to answer every purpose, viz., those used by paper\r\n    manufacturers in England, and by coffee planters and arrowroot\r\n    growers in the West Indies.\r\n\r\n    _Drying_.--The washed fibre, when hung over lines made of the\r\n    twisted fibre, or any other convenient material, will be\r\n    sufficiently dry in a few hours to be taken down, when more can be\r\n    hung up, and then several batches can be dried in a day; and it will\r\n    be necessary to have the drying ground as near the water as\r\n    possible, in order to save weight in carriage.\r\n\r\n    _Pressing_.--When the fibre is perfectly dry, it must be well\r\n    pressed, for the convenience of packing, carriage, and shipment. The\r\n    hydraulic press is the best machine that can be used for the\r\n    purpose; but in the absence of that, the lever and screw will make a\r\n    large amount of pressure available. A hydraulic press of from 400 to\r\n    500 tons, will press bales of from four to five hundred weight each,\r\n    which will not be too large for shipment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARCH-PRODUCING PLANTS INVESTIGATED.\r\n\r\nStarch is one of the constituent parts in all mealy farinaceous seeds,\r\nfruits, roots, and other parts of plants, and is in large demand for\r\ndomestic use, the arts, &c. Our common starch is made from wheat, and\r\na good deal from potatoes. Pure fecula is separated by art from a\r\nvariety of plants.\r\n\r\nOf plants yielding starch we have the Indian arrowroot, which is the\r\nfecula in the rhizomata of several species of the Marantaceæ. In the\r\nWest Indies it is obtained from the _Maranta arundinacea_, _Allomyca_\r\nand _nobilis_, and also from various species of _Canna_ called _Tous\r\nles mois_, and in the East Indies from species of _Curcuma_, and from\r\n_Maranta ramossissima_ in Silhet.\r\n\r\nThe bread fruit (_Artocarpus incisa_), already alluded to, yields a\r\nlarge quantity of starch; as do the sweet potato (_Convolvulus\r\nBatatas_, or _Batatas edulis_). The pith or farinaceous part of the\r\ntrunk of the _Caryota urens_, is almost equal to the finest sago. In\r\nAssam the sago of this palm is much used.\r\n\r\nThe two varieties of the Cassava afford a very superior fecula, which\r\nis imported under the name of Brazilian arrowroot. 8,354 bags of\r\ntapioca and farina were imported from Maranham in 1834. Some excellent\r\nstarch from Norfolk Island was shown at the Great Exhibition.\r\n\r\nThe Cycadaceous family yields much starchy matter, along with\r\nmucilage. From the soft stems of _Cycas revoluta_ and _C. circinalis_,\r\nnatives of China and the East Indies, a kind of sago is made. These\r\nplants are propagated by suckers. _Zamia pumila_, a native of the Cape\r\nof Good Hope, and other species of this remarkable genus of plants,\r\nwhich is nearly related to both ferns and palms, supply an amylaceous\r\nmatter, which has been sold as arrowroot. A similar product is\r\nobtained from _Alstroemeria pallida_, a perennial plant, with pink red\r\nflowers, growing in Chili. From the nuts of the _Cycas circinalis_,\r\nthe Singalese prepare an inferior kind of starch, by pounding the\r\nfresh kernels. These are cut in slices, and well dried in the sun\r\nbefore they are fit for use, otherwise when eaten they are\r\nintoxicating, and occasion vomiting and purging.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of starch in a plant varies according to the period of\r\ngrowth. The results of examination on the comparative yield of starch\r\nin the potato, showed that while it abounded towards the latter part\r\nof the season, it decreased when the tubers began to germinate in the\r\nspring. It was found by Professor Balfour that 240 lbs. of potatoes\r\nleft in the ground, contained of starch--\r\n\r\n                        lbs.

These being well washed and scraped, were grated, in each case\r\ninto two gallons of clear rain-water, and the whole then filtered\r\nthrough a clean linen strainer, after which it was left to settle;\r\nwhen the amylaceous matter had wholly subsided the supernatant liquor\r\nwas carefully decanted, and fresh water added, which process was\r\nrepeated until every foreign substance appeared to be removed; the\r\nproduce of these several operations was then carefully collected and\r\ndried with a temperature of about 110 deg. Fahrenheit, and, when dry,\r\nweighed. In this manner the results given in the following table were\r\nobtained:--\r\n\r\n  PRODUCE FROM FIVE POUNDS OF THE\r\n                                                   Oz. Drms.

The sweet potato and the yam, both of which\r\nare considered to be less nutritious than the arrowroot, rank above it\r\nin the centesimal proportion of their amylaceous produce. Upon what,\r\nthen, do the nutritive properties of these various substances depend?\r\nIs it upon a gluten which was overlooked by Mr. Harris, in his\r\nexperiments, or, if not, may we not suspect some inaccuracy in the\r\nproportion of starch assigned by him to each? It is to be wished that\r\nsimilar experiments were repeated with care in different quarters, and\r\nthe list extended to other tropical products applicable to human\r\nsustenance, especially the roots which yield the farinaceous starch of\r\nthe South Sea islanders, to the achira of Choco, &c.\r\n\r\nI shall extract largely from a very valuable report drawn up by Dr.\r\nJohn Shier, agricultural chemist, of Demerara, and submitted to the\r\nGovernor of that colony in 1847, on the starch-producing plants, which\r\nis deserving of more widely extended publicity than the merely local\r\ncirculation it has received. The remarks and results of experiments\r\nare worthy of deep consideration; and although they were meant to\r\napply specially to British Guiana, they are equally pertinent to the\r\nWest India colonies generally, our African and Australian settlements,\r\nand many other of our foreign possessions.\r\n\r\nFor many reasons it is desirable that the number of the staples of\r\ncultivation and export of our colonies should be increased. It is the\r\ngeneral experience of British agriculturists, that the mixed system of\r\nagriculture is more profitable to the farmer and safer for the land,\r\nthan the continued cultivation of any single crop, or indeed of\r\nnearly allied crops; and although fewer valid objections can be urged\r\nagainst the continued cultivation of the sugar cane, when properly\r\nconducted, than against that of grain crops, it is nevertheless\r\ncertain that a well-arranged alternation or rotation of crops would be\r\nbetter. When an efficient system of covered drainage is adopted in\r\nBritish Guiana, there can be no doubt that the sugar cane will be\r\nreplanted at shorter intervals of time than at present, and that other\r\ncrops, such as provender crops for cattle, and provision crops for the\r\ncolonial and perhaps the home market, will be made to alternate in\r\ncultivation with the cane. When the cane rows are as far apart as they\r\nrequire to be, to admit of sufficient tillage with the plough and\r\nother implements, it will also be possible to intercalate crops of\r\nrapidly growing plants; and were this done, as it easily might, in\r\nsuch a manner as to prevent undue exhaustion of the land, or\r\nimpoverishment of the sugar crop, the returns could not fail to be\r\nmaterially increased. It would then probably be found that the\r\nfluctuations in prices would be less felt, for they would not likely,\r\nat the same time, affect different crops in the same manner.\r\n\r\nIt has been ascertained, in regard to some plants at least, that a\r\nmuch larger return can be obtained in the colonies than can be grown\r\nin temperate countries, however fertile. This is partly owing to the\r\ngreater fertility of the soil under powerful tropical atmospheric\r\ninfluences, and partly to the fact that vegetation is continuous\r\nthroughout the year, so that slow growing plants can do more within\r\nthe time, from their functions not being arrested by the chill of\r\nwinter; and of many rapidly growing plants, two successive crops can\r\nbe grown within the year.\r\n\r\nStarch is a substance easily manufactured, and being largely used in\r\nseveral of the arts, as well as an article of diet, there consequently\r\nexists a considerable demand for it in England. It may be obtained\r\nfrom a great variety of plants, and many of the most productive of it\r\nare natives of the tropics.\r\n\r\nThe high prices commanded by grain and breadstuffs in Europe, renders\r\nthe present a remarkably favorable time to ascertain what can be done\r\nin this branch of tropical agriculture; for should the potato disease\r\nreturn, or this root be less extensively planted than hitherto, starch\r\nmust maintain a high price, and it will be worth ascertaining whether\r\nsome of the superior starch-producing plants of the tropics might not\r\nbe cultivated to such an extent as to supply the English market, and\r\nthus be at once profitable to the colonies and advantageous to the\r\nmother country.\r\n\r\nBefore entering on such a cultivation, however, various points require\r\ninvestigation. We ought to be able to answer such questions as the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n1. What differences exist between the characters of starch produced by\r\ndifferent plants?\r\n\r\n2. What are the qualities or properties that lead\r\nmanufacturers--calico printers for example--to prefer one variety to\r\nanother?\r\n\r\n3. For culinary purposes, and as an article of diet, what qualities\r\nor characters obtain a preference?\r\n\r\n4. Can the starches from different plants be distinguished from one\r\nanother by distinct and well marked characters, so that the\r\nsubstitution of a less esteemed variety for a more esteemed one, or\r\nthe adulteration of a high priced variety with a cheaper one, could be\r\nreadily detected?\r\n\r\n5. What plants produce the most esteemed varieties?\r\n\r\n6. What plants produce it in the largest quantity?\r\n\r\n7. What plants produce the largest yield per acre?\r\n\r\n8. From what plants is it most easily manufactured?\r\n\r\n9. Is the process attended with any particular difficulties that ought\r\nto deter the East and West India planters from engaging in it?\r\n\r\nIn the following observations (continues Dr. Shier) I shall be able to\r\nreply to several of these questions, especially those capable of being\r\nsettled in the laboratory. On other points, particularly those\r\nrelating to the returns per acre, I am at present but imperfectly\r\ninformed, in consequence of the limited extent to which these plants\r\nhave hitherto been cultivated in this colony (Demerara), and from the\r\ntotal absence of authentic data regarding the amount of yield.\r\n\r\n_Characters of starch produced from different plants_.--Starches from\r\ndifferent plants are best distinguished from one another by\r\nexamination under a good miscroscope. The grains or globules may be\r\nexamined either as transparent or opaque objects; and although in the\r\nsame species there are considerable differences in size and form, the\r\ndifferent kinds are, on the whole, quite distinguishable. One of the\r\nbest ways of examining the form of the globules, under the microscope,\r\nis to lay them on a plate of glass and cover them with a drop of\r\naqueous solution of iodine, which renders them gradually blue and\r\nopaque. When the difference in size and form between the globules of\r\ndifferent species is considerable, as between the _Tous les mois_\r\nstarch and cassava starch, or even between the arrowroot starch and\r\ncassava starch frequently used to adulterate it, it is not difficult,\r\nwith a little practice, to detect the fraud.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE SIZE AND FORM OF THE STARCH GLOBULES OF\r\nVARIOUS PLANTS.\r\n\r\n1. Tous-les-mois (_Canna coccinea_).--Grown in Grenada, 1-300 to\r\n1-2,000 of an inch; general size, 1-500; form of the globules, large,\r\nelliptical and ovate, and remarkably transparent.\r\n\r\n2.

Form of globules,\r\nspherical and slightly elliptical, some very small; range, 1-2,000 to\r\n1-6,000, the former the general size.\r\n\r\n19. Maize (_Zea Mays_).--Grown in the colony, but locality uncertain.\r\nGlobules, approaching to spherical, much aggregated; range, 1-2,000 to\r\n1-4,000; general size, 1-3,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom an inspection of this list, it does not appear that the species\r\nwould be easily distinguishable, and it is not easy briefly to\r\ndescribe the differences; in practice, however, and especially when\r\nthe observer has a number of pure and authentic specimens before him,\r\nto have recourse to as standards of comparison, the discrimination is\r\nby no means difficult.\r\n\r\n_Specific gravity of starch derived from various plants_.--Of many\r\nbodies the determination of the specific gravity is one of the best\r\nmodes of distinguishing the purity. With the view of ascertaining\r\nwhether the different varieties of starch have all the same density,\r\nas has been asserted by some, trials were carefully made of as many\r\nspecimens as I could procure.

When sun dried, the masses were broken down, and the\r\nstarches freely exposed to the air in the shade for ten days. Any\r\nadherent masses were then rubbed to powder by light pressure in a\r\nglazed mortar, and the whole sifted. Portions of each of these\r\nstarches, and of others for the sake of comparison, were then dried,\r\nat 212 degrees Fahrenheit, in a current of dry air, and the loss\r\ndetermined:--\r\n\r\n    TABLE No. II.--SHOWING THE HYGROSCOPIC WATER CONTAINED BY STARCH\r\n                     PRODUCED FROM DIFFERENT PLANTS.\r\n\r\n                     Per centage of water.

The mixture was then heated and boiled briskly for\r\nthree minutes, with constant stirring, and was immediately poured into\r\na conical test-glass,[45] which the jelly nearly filled. The time at\r\nwhich each glass was filled was noted, and exactly two hours were\r\nallowed for the contents to cool in a current of air. The glass is\r\nthen set on a plate of glass, supported on a ring of a retort stand,\r\nand the weight ascertained, which was necessary to force a metallic\r\ndisc, of ascertained size, through the jelly. The most convenient way\r\nof doing this was by using a piece of apparatus of the form rudely\r\nrepresented on the margin. The rectangular frame is of thin brass\r\nwire, and the slightly cup-shaped disc, _d d_, is soldered to a wire,\r\nattached to the upper short side of the rectangle. From the opposite\r\nor lower side of the rectangle a small glass cup, _c._, is suspended,\r\ninto which weights are put as soon as the disc has been made to rest\r\non the surface of the jelly, _pp_ is the plate of glass on which the\r\ntest-glass is set. Whenever the disc tears the skin of the jelly and\r\nbegins to sink in it, no further addition, of weights is made, and\r\nthe weight of the disc, framework, and cup being known, we have an\r\nestimate of the tenacity of the jelly. This process is but\r\napproximative, and some practice is necessary before the operator\r\nsucceeds in getting uniform results from the same series of specimens.\r\n\r\n    +--------------------+\r\n    |          |         |\r\n    |          |         |\r\n    |          |         |\r\n    |    d  \\_____/  d   |\r\n    |                    |\r\n    |                    |\r\n    |                    |\r\n    |  p--------------p  |\r\n    |                    |\r\n    |                    |\r\n    +--------------------+\r\n               |\r\n               |\r\n               |\r\n               |\r\n           ---------\r\n               c.\r\n\r\nThe following statement shows the results on such specimens as I could\r\nprocure.

At first I thought it probable that the tenacity of the\r\njelly would bear some relation to the size of the globules, and it is\r\ntrue that we find the Grenada Tous les mois, the largest globule, next\r\nthe top, and the cassava among the smallest, at the bottom of the\r\nscale. But, on the other hand, we have the Buck yam starch, a large\r\nsized globule, very high; together with many other exceptions.\r\n\r\nAs an article of diet, the most tenacious varieties of starch are\r\npreferred, on account of the economy of employing an article of which\r\na less quantity will suffice; and the same is true when applied to\r\nstarching linen, provided the jelly be not deficient in clearness.\r\n\r\n_Clearness of jellies_.--When starch jelly is used for the purpose of\r\nstarching, or glazing linen, or cotton goods, those varieties that are\r\nmost transparent are understood to be preferred, provided, at the same\r\ntime, they possess the requisite tenacity. This and other matters\r\nwill be best determined by practical men in England; but having had\r\noccasion many times to prepare specimens for trying the tenacity, the\r\nopportunity was always taken of arranging the specimen of jellies in\r\nthe order of their clearness, or, to speak more accurately, of their\r\ntranslucency. In this respect also they exhibit considerable\r\ndifferences, varying, when prepared according to the formula described\r\nunder the head of tenacity, from very translucent approaching to\r\nopaque. The order is shown in the annexed list, which begins with the\r\nclearest.\r\n\r\n  TABLE NO.

The quantity of starch, even in the same\r\nplants, the potato for instance, varies with the season, the soil,\r\nclimate, age, ripeness, length of time the roots have been out of the\r\nground, &c.\r\n\r\nIn the following table I have given the result of a series of trials\r\nmade in the Colonial Laboratory, Demerara. The roots were all fresh\r\ndug, and, with two exceptions, noticed in the remarks, were fair\r\naverage specimens. The process was the common one. The grater or\r\nrasping machine was of copper, to avoid injuring the color of some of\r\nthe starches, which an iron grater is liable to do:--\r\n\r\n  TABLE NO.

A third, from a dark colored variety   14.83\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing list it appears that the sweet and bitter cassava\r\nmerit attention as starch-producing plants. They are occasionally\r\ngrown for this purpose in the colonies, and yield a large per centage\r\nof starch; but there exists an opinion, whether well or ill founded,\r\nthat it is liable to rot linen, and the preference is given here to\r\nthe starch of arrowroot. It remains to be seen, however, what estimate\r\nwill be formed of this starch in England, for if it should prove an\r\nesteemed variety, there can be no doubt of its proving a highly\r\nprofitable cultivation. Cassava grows readily in almost any soil, and\r\nwhen the drainage is tolerable, two crops of the sweet variety can, it\r\nis stated be grown in a year. I have seen it growing luxuriantly in\r\nthe light soils of the interior, as well as in the stiff clay soils of\r\nthe coasts. It is considered an excellent preparatory crop in new and\r\nstiff land, on account of its tendency to loosen the soil. Were the\r\nbitter variety fixed on, the preparation of _Casareep_ might be\r\ncombined with the preparation of starch; and as that substance is one\r\nof the most esteemed bases for the preparation of various sauces, it\r\nis probable that this might turn out the most profitable part of the\r\nproduce. At all events, bitter cassava would have this advantage over\r\nall other starch-producing roots, that the juice of the roots could be\r\nturned, to account as well as the starch.\r\n\r\nOf all the plants mentioned in the list, starch is most readily\r\nseparated from the arrowroot, in consequence of the tissue being more\r\nfibrous, and yielding little or no cellular tissue requiring to be run\r\noff the starch. Time and water are thus saved in the process, and were\r\nthe fibrous residue pressed and dried, it could probably be turned to\r\ngood account in the manufacture of paper.\r\n\r\nIn respect of facility of preparation, the plantain starch, though of\r\nexcellent quality, ranks lowest, for the flesh-colored tissue in which\r\nthe starch is embedded is somewhat denser than the starch, and settles\r\ndown under it, and it is not a little difficult to arrange the process\r\nso as completely to separate the finer parts of this matter from the\r\nstarch, and hence its color is never perfectly white.\r\n\r\n_Yield of starch-producing plants per acre_.--On this subject, as\r\nalready remarked, I do not at present possess sufficiently accurate\r\ndata.\r\n\r\nIn England ten tons of potatoes are not unfrequently produced per\r\nacre; now assuming 15 the per centage of starch, there would be a\r\nyield of one-and-a-half tons per acre, which, at the-lowest quotation,\r\n28s. a cwt., would give £42 per acre; and were the starch to rank with\r\nthat prepared from wheat, it would produce £40 per ton, or £60 per\r\nacre. In the thorough drained land of Demerara, and under a good\r\nsystem of cultivation, I have no doubt that ten tons of cassava could\r\neasily be grown, and if it yielded 25 per cent. of starch, it would be\r\na return of 2½ tons, or of £62 10s. per acre, reckoned at the price of\r\npotato starch.\r\n\r\nOf the yield of the plantain we possess much more accurate\r\ninformation. A new plantain walk in this colony (British Guiana) will\r\nyield 450 bunches, of 50 lbs. each, of which, as nearly as possible,\r\n50 per cent. will be of core, containing 17 per cent. of starch, thus\r\nproducing 17 cwt. of starch per acre. But an old plantain walk, even\r\nwhen free from disease, could not be reckoned to yield more than half\r\nthis quantity, namely, 8½ cwt. per acre. Considering the value that is\r\nset on the plantain as an article of food, and the difficulties\r\nincident to the process of making starch from it, it is by no means\r\nprobable that it will ever be used as a source from which to obtain\r\nstarch.\r\n\r\nOf the quantity of arrowroot that can be grown per acre, I have been\r\nable (continues Dr. Shier) to procure no information; but from the\r\nprice it commands in the market, the facility with which it can be\r\ngrown, and the ease with which the process of separating the starch\r\ncan be carried on, it deserves a fair trial here. To cultivate it to\r\nadvantage it ought to be done on thorough-drained and well-tilled\r\nland, planted at the proper season, and not dug till ripe and in dry\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nOf the Tous les mois, I have only been able to procure a single plant,\r\nfor which I am indebted to the kindness of the Hon. John Croal. As the\r\nroot was immature, it would be unfair to deduce from the quantity of\r\nstarch obtained, the per centage generally contained by the plant. Its\r\nimmaturity was also indicated by the globules being smaller than in\r\nthe specimen obtained from Grenada; in other respects, however, such\r\nas the tenacity of its jelly, it stands highest. It is altogether one\r\nof the most promising starch-producing plants, and obviously deserves\r\na careful trial. It is a plant that expends a good deal of matter in\r\nmaturing a considerable quantity of dense and bulky seeds, but as it\r\npropagates both by root and seed, it is probable that, as a root-crop,\r\nit would be highly advantageous to procure a variety that does not\r\nflower.\r\n\r\nBoth the tannia and the sweet potato can be readily grown, and the\r\nproduce per acre is large; but from the foregoing tables it would\r\nappear that there are other plants whose starch is likely to be held\r\nin greater estimation.\r\n\r\n_Difficulties attendant on the process of preparing starch_.--Were the\r\nmanufacture of superior starch to be carried out in this colony\r\n(British Guiana) on a large scale and profitably, recourse would\r\nrequire to be had to all the well-known means of economising labor. In\r\nthe cultivation as much as possible would require to be done by cattle\r\nand implement labor, and this would be the easier to accomplish,\r\ninasmuch as, to grow roots to great advantage, the land would require\r\nto be thorough drained. When the produce was brought to the buildings,\r\nmachinery similar to what is already in use in Europe, for the\r\npurpose of washing and rasping roots, and of separating and washing\r\nstarch, would suffice with comparatively little manual labor. An\r\nordinary amount of judgment being exercised in determining the proper\r\nperiod of ripeness of the roots, and in selecting seasons when the\r\nweather is usually most suitable for conducting the process of\r\nmanufacture, it does not appear that any unusual difficulty would have\r\nto be encountered by growers or manufacturers, unless as regards the\r\nobtaining of a sufficient supply of good water; for that is essential\r\nto the production of good starch.\r\n\r\nThe creek water of the colony is generally too brown, and the trench\r\nwater too muddy, and contains often too much salt to produce starches\r\nof the finest color, hence recourse would require to be had to rain\r\nwater, or Artesian water. The first is remarkably pure, and it\r\ncertainly does not appear that were sufficiently capacious reservoirs\r\nbuilt, or ponds dug, and protected from infiltration by the usual\r\nwell-known means, there would be great difficulty in getting a\r\nsufficient supply of rain water. It is done in Bermuda, and why not\r\nhere? On the other hand, almost all the Artesian wells in the colony\r\ncontain a large quantity of oxide of iron held in solution by carbonic\r\nacid, and which separates as an ochrey deposit on free exposure to the\r\nair. Were this water used in the starch process, it would certainly\r\ninjure the color materially; but by a chemical process, exceedingly\r\nsimple, inexpensive, and easy of application, it is possible to purify\r\nthe Artesian water, and render it almost as fit as rain water for the\r\npurpose of manufacturing starch.\r\n\r\nIn some of the other colonies a great deal of the best starch is\r\nproduced by the holders of small lots of land, and many parts of the\r\nlabor being light, and suited for women and children, it is one of the\r\nmost desirable cultivations for small holders, and would be very\r\nbeneficial for Demerara, where the lands of the peasantry too\r\ngenerally lie in a state of utter neglect; yet small holders could not\r\nbe expected to be able to compete with those who should grow starch on\r\nthe large scale, and prepare it with the best machinery.\r\n\r\n_Cassava meal, plantain meal, &c., as articles of export_.--It may\r\nsoon become an important question whether the plantain, or some of the\r\nedible roots grown in the tropics, might not be sent to Europe in a\r\nfresh state as a substitute for the potato. Many of them, the buck yam\r\nand the cassava, for instance, ought to be used when fresh dug, for\r\nevery day they are out of the ground they deteriorate. This, however,\r\nis not so much the case with some of the larger yams. It is worth\r\ntrying whether the finer sorts that deteriorate by keeping, might not,\r\nafter being sliced and dried in the sun, become articles of export,\r\neither in that state or when ground to meal. For this purpose the\r\nbitter cassava, the plantain, and the buck yam are the most promising.\r\n\r\nOf the bitter cassava mention has already been made as a substance\r\nfrom which the starch and _casareep_ might be prepared. In this case,\r\nhowever, the woody and cellular tissue, with the small quantity of\r\nstarch left in it by the ordinary starch process, would form far too\r\npoor an article of diet to constitute part of the food of man. But the\r\nroots might be used as a medium from which to prepare cassava meal,\r\n_casareep_, and the very small quantity of starch which is expressed\r\nalong with the juice, leaving all the rest of the starch to form part\r\nof the meal. It is of such meal that the cassava cakes of the Indians\r\nare prepared; and although by no means so nutritive as Indian corn\r\nmeal[46], there can be little doubt that in the Scotch and Irish\r\nmarkets the cassava meal would obtain a preference; and were it\r\nexported in quantity it would probably come into extensive use among\r\nall classes.\r\n\r\nThe process would be as follows:--After washing in a revolving\r\napparatus, by which means the adherent earth would be got quit of, and\r\nalmost the whole of the thin dark colored cuticle become detached, the\r\nroots could be reduced to pulp in a rasping-mill, without the use of\r\nwater; the pulp might be compressed in bags by hydraulic pressure,\r\nwhereby the juice, together with a small portion of the starch, would\r\nbe expressed. After allowing the starch to subside, the juice should\r\nbe concentrated to about the density of 1.4. The starch would be\r\nwashed, purified, and dried. The contents of the bags would then be\r\nbroken up and dried in the sun or in a current of air, after which the\r\nmeal would be sifted through a coarse sieve to separate the coarser\r\nparts, which, if their amount was considerable, could be ground and\r\nadded to the rest. In this state of rough meal it is fit for making\r\nthe cassava cakes. If ground to flour it might be used to mix with\r\nwheat, rye, or barley flour.\r\n\r\nThe process is usually conducted as follows:--The squeezed pulp is\r\nbroken up, sifted, and exposed to the sun on trays or mats till it is\r\nfully more than half dry. An iron hoop of the size and thickness of\r\nthe cake to be made is then laid on a griddle or hot plate, and the\r\nspace within the hoop is filled evenly with the somewhat moist meal,\r\nno previous kneading or rolling having been employed. As soon as the\r\ncoarse meal coheres, the ring is lifted and the cake is turned and\r\nheated on the opposite side. The heat should not be sufficient to\r\nbrown the cake. The cakes are finally dried by exposure to the sun.\r\nFrom the dry cassava meal cakes may be prepared by sprinkling it with\r\nas much cold water as to moisten it to the proper point, and then\r\nproceeding as above. Hot water cannot be employed, neither can\r\nkneading, or any considerable degree of compression be used, otherwise\r\nthe water does not evaporate readily enough; the starch gets too much\r\naltered by the heat, and the cake becomes tough.\r\n\r\nIf an acre of well-tilled thorough-drained land yield 10 tons of fresh\r\nroots, and I have every reason to believe that such a return might be\r\nobtained, I have ascertained that the produce would be 3½ tons of\r\nmeal, 598 lbs. of _casareep_, and 2 cwt. of starch; and estimating the\r\nmeal at 1d. per lb., the _casareep_ at 1s. 5d. per lb., and the starch\r\nat 40s. per cwt., the gross amount would be £78 13s. 4d. per acre. In\r\nascertaining these proportions, very simple machinery was employed,\r\nand had the pulp been better pressed the quantity of _casareep_ would\r\nhave been considerably greater.\r\n\r\nFrom the table given in a former note it will be seen that the cassava\r\nmeal prepared in this way contains but a very small proportion of\r\nmatter nutritive in the sense of contributing to the formation of\r\nblood, and that the expressed juice carries off fully one-half of the\r\nproteine compounds contained in the plant.\r\n\r\nLichenin is a variety of starch occurring in _Cetraria islandica_, or\r\nIceland moss.\r\n\r\n_Indian corn starch_.--The advance of science has recently brought to\r\nour knowledge the preparation and use of another article, not only\r\nimportant as food, but also essential in the arts. I have had occasion\r\nto mention the high value of the Indian corn, and I might with\r\nadvantage allude to many of its uses and properties; at present I must\r\nconfine my remarks to a product from this valuable grain, known as\r\ncorn starch, and yet another as the fecula of maize. In the close of\r\n1849, Mr. Willard and his associates, of Auburn, established extensive\r\nworks at Oswego, for the preparation of these important products,\r\ntheir establishment covering an area of 49,000 square feet. As the\r\nproprietors have to some extent held unrevealed the process by which\r\nthey produce a starch more pure than the starch of commerce, we may\r\nnot indulge in speculative curiosity; yet I can hardly doubt their\r\ngreat success is mainly attributable to perfect machinery, guided by\r\nscience and talent. The rapid and extended demand for these new\r\nproducts presents sufficient evidence of their character, as we are\r\ntold that about three millions of pounds of this corn starch are\r\ndemanded annually by the trade, notwithstanding the usual supply of\r\nwheat starch is undiminished. A remarkable feature of maize starch is\r\nthe absence of impurities; upon being subjected to analysis, it is\r\nfound that only 2 76-100 parts in 1000 are of other matter than pure\r\nstarch. According to Dr. Ure, wheat yields only 35 to 40 per cent, of\r\ngood starch, a material extensively used in arts and manufactures.\r\n\r\nIn addition to starch, the Oswego starch-factory produces from Indian\r\ncorn a fecula, peculiarly adapted to culinary purposes, presenting to\r\nour domestic economy one of the most acceptable, pure, and nutritious\r\narticles of food. Already has it become an indispensable household\r\narticle, and is consumed largely at home and abroad. The factory,\r\nthough in its infancy, consumes annually 150,000 bushels of corn,\r\nequal to about nine millions of pounds in weight. Hitherto the\r\nquantities of starch used for laundry purposes and in the\r\nmanufactories of America, have been produced from costly wheats,\r\nthough it may be found in many vegetable substances, such as potatoes,\r\nthe horse chesnut and other seeds. In England, where breadstuffs,\r\nparticularly wheat, have been raised in quantities inadequate to the\r\ndemand for food, attempts have been made to convert the viscid matter\r\nof lichens into a gum, for the use of calico printers, paper-makers,\r\nand ink makers; for the stiffening of silks, crapes, and the endless\r\nvariety of dry goods, which, by means of these gums or starch, are\r\nmade to appear of greater consistency. Most of these attempts had\r\npartial success, yet the making of starch from wheat has not been\r\narrested.\r\n\r\nThe Oswego starch factory has happily introduced the use of Indian\r\ncorn, as a grain producing a larger proportion of pure amylaceous\r\nproperties than any other known vegetable substance, proffering to the\r\nAmerican manufacturer another economic advantage, sustaining, in a\r\nmost legitimate matter, sound rivalry and competition with all the\r\nworld. I am not aware whether the Oswego factory has converted its\r\nstarch into gum--a process easily accomplished by heat, and thus\r\nrendered soluble in cold water, which cannot be done while in its\r\ncondition of starch. Here is another result of vast importance\r\nderivable from Indian corn; and we can well conceive that, in a short\r\nperiod of time, the advantages now derived from the production of corn\r\nstarch, may have grown into a national benefit.\r\n\r\nRice (according to Prof. Solly) contains on an average about 84 per\r\ncent of starch; but till comparatively a few years ago, no starch was\r\nmanufactured from it, notwithstanding its low price, and the large\r\nquantity of starch which exists in it. The reason of this was, that\r\nthe old process of fermentation, by means of which starch is procured\r\nfrom grain, was not found to be applicable to rice; and hence the\r\nlatter only became available as a source of starch in 1840, when Mr.\r\nOrlando Jones introduced his new process, for which he obtained a\r\npatent. This process consisted in macerating the rice for about 20\r\nhours in a dilute solution of caustic potash, containing about 200\r\ngrains of the alkali in every gallon; the liquor is then drawn off,\r\nthe rice dried, reduced to powder by grinding, then a second time\r\ndigested in a similar alkaline lye for 24 hours, repeatedly agitated.\r\nAfter this it is allowed to settle, and well washed with pure cold\r\nwater. A prize medal was awarded for this rice starch at the Great\r\nExhibition.\r\n\r\nMr. S. Berger, of Bromley, also received a prize medal. He adopts a\r\ndifferent mode of preparation. In place of employing a dilute solution\r\nof caustic potash to dissolve the gluten and other insoluble matters\r\nof the grain, Mr. Berger uses a solution of carbonate of soda,\r\ncontaining half a pound to the gallon. The rice is steeped, in cold\r\nwater for 48 hours, levigated in a suitable mill, and the pulp thus\r\nformed is treated with the solution of carbonate of soda for 60 or 70\r\nhours, being repeatedly stirred; it is then allowed to settle for some\r\nhours, the alkaline liquor is drawn off, and the starch is washed and\r\npurified. This process was patented by Mr. Berger, in December, 1841.\r\nA third process was patented in February, 1842, by Mr. J. Colman; he\r\nuses dilute muriatic acid for the same purpose as Messrs Jones and\r\nBerger.\r\n\r\n\r\nARROWROOT, EAST AND WEST INDIAN.\r\n\r\nThe genuine arrowroot of commerce is the produce of the tuberous\r\nrhizomata of _Maranta arundinacea_, a native of South America, and _M.\r\nindica_, indigenous to the West Indies, but also cultivated in the\r\nEast. The best West Indian arrowroot comes from Bermuda. Its globules\r\nare much smaller and less glistening than those of _Tous-les-mois_, or\r\npotato starch.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar characteristics of the starch obtained from various\r\nplants has been particularised and described already in the elaborate\r\ninvestigation of the commercial yield and value of the\r\nstarch-producing plants. Amylaceous matter of a similar kind to\r\narrowroot is obtained from other species of Maranta, as from some\r\nspecies of _Canna_, well known under the popular name of Indian shot,\r\nfrom the similarity of their round black seeds.\r\n\r\nThe arrowroot plant (_M. arundinacea_) is a perennial, its root is\r\nfleshy and creeping, and very full of knots and numerous long white\r\nfibres. Arising from the root are many leaves, spear-shaped, smooth on\r\nthe upper surface and hairy beneath. The length of the leaf is about\r\nsix or seven inches, and the breadth about three towards their base,\r\nthe color and consistence resembling those of the seed. From the root\r\narise slender petioles upon which the leaves stand, and several\r\nherbaceous erect stalks come out between them, rising to the height of\r\nabout two feet. A loose bunch of small white flowers is succeeded by\r\nthree-cornered capsules, each containing one hard rough seed.\r\n\r\nThe propagation and culture of this plant are of the simplest kinds.\r\nThe roots should be parted, and the most suitable soil is a rich loam.\r\n\r\nIn the Bermudas, a deep rich soil, or one in which marsh or peat\r\nprevail, is alone adapted for growing arrowroot in perfection.\r\n\r\nA correspondent from the Bermudas, (where arrowroot forms the great\r\nstaple crop of the islands), informs me that he ploughed up a small\r\npiece of land, twenty rods (or the eighth part of an acre), with a\r\nsmall plough and one horse. He ploughed it over three times, and the\r\nthird time planted the arrowroot as he ploughed it. The land had not\r\nbeen turned up before for twenty years.\r\n\r\nThe expenses and profits stand thus:--\r\n\r\n                                EXPENSE.\r\n                                                               £. s. d.\r\n  To the ploughman, harrowing and planting the\r\n    arrowroot                                                  1  0  0\r\n  Arrowroot plants                                               16  0\r\n  Digging it up                                      £1  0 0\r\n  Deduct half, as the land was planted for the next\r\n    year                                              0 10 0   0 10  0\r\n  Balance carried down, being net profit                       5 14  0\r\n                                                              --------\r\n                                                               8  0  0\r\n                                      PRODUCE.\r\n  By 2,000 lbs. of root at 8s. per 100 lbs.                    8  0  0\r\n  By balance brought down as net profit                        5 14  0\r\n\r\nThe above £5 14s. clear profit on the 20 rods, is at the rate of £45\r\n12s. profit for one acre. Now, if a small cultivator were to plant\r\nthree or four acres, and get only one-half of the above profit, it\r\nwould give a good return, and would be well worth the trial.\r\n\r\nArrowroot requires a good rich red soil, of which there is still much\r\nlying waste. The best time for planting it is in April, but it can be\r\nplanted in March, or indeed at any time after the first of the year,\r\ntill May: though if taken up and planted before Christmas, you may\r\ndepend it will not come to any perfection. Arrowroot can be planted in\r\nmany ways; either in holes made with a hoe, ploughed under, or in\r\ndrills like Irish potatoes. Now the way I prefer is to prepare the\r\nland, then strike the line at two feet apart, and make holes with a\r\npointed stick or dibble six inches apart, putting in each hole one\r\nstrong plant or two small ones, then cover them up. This is more\r\ntrouble than the old way, but it gives an excellent crop. It can also\r\nbe planted like Irish potatoes in drills, two feet apart in the rows,\r\nand six inches between the plants. It should be hand-weeded in the\r\nspring, because if it is hoed, most likely you will cut some of it off\r\nwhich may be springing under ground, and it will never come up so\r\nstrong again. Arrowroot requires very strong ground and plenty of\r\nmanure. Farm yard manure is the best; next to that green seaweed\r\ndripping with salt water--this is an excellent manure, and should be\r\ndug in the ground as the arrowroot is taken up. I have no doubt that\r\nit would be of great advantage to the planter, if he were to put a\r\ncask in a cart, fill it with salt water, and put it on the land a few\r\nweeks before it is planted. Some people say that arrowroot does not\r\npay so well, because it has to stay in the ground a whole year; but\r\nthen if you have onions you can plant them over it, and so obtain a\r\ncrop which will pay much better than the arrowroot itself. If you have\r\na large piece of arrowroot ground, take up one half early, and plant\r\nit out with Irish potatoes; then take up the other half later, and\r\nwith the plants set out your potato ground, that is if you have taken\r\nup your potatoes; if not, plant the arrowroot between the rows, in\r\nholes; so that when you take up the potatoes, you clean the arrowroot\r\nand loosen the ground, which will give a good crop; or you can plant\r\nIndian corn very thin over the arrowroot ground (if you have nothing\r\nelse), but be sure to cut it up before it ripens corn, or it will\r\ninjure your arrowroot crop; or you may plant a few melon seeds over\r\nit, and you will have a fine crop of fruit.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 I planted, in the months of January and February, a quarter of\r\nan acre of good land, in arrowroot and onions.\r\n\r\nThe expense and profit stand as follow.--\r\n\r\n                           EXPENSE\r\n                                                  £. s. d.\r\n  To digging the ground                            1  0  0\r\n  Planting arrowroot                               0  6  0\r\n  Twelve load of seaweed, at 1s.                   0 12  0\r\n  Rotten manure for onions, 10 loads, at 2s.       1  0  0\r\n  One bottle onion seed                            0 16  0\r\n  Sowing onion seed and keeping the plants clean   0 10  0\r\n  Planting out onions                              1  0  0\r\n  Cleaning onions after set out                    0 15  0\r\n  Tops and making basket                           1  8  0\r\n  Pulling, cutting, and basketing                  0 18  0\r\n  Carting and shipping                             0  8  0\r\n  Digging arrowroot                                2  0  0\r\n                                                  --------\r\n                                                  10 13  0\r\n  Clear profit on quarter acre                    22 13  9\r\n                                                  --------\r\n                                                  33  6  9\r\n                           PRODUCE\r\n  By onions sold                                  20 16  0\r\n  By arrowroot                                    12 10  9\r\n                                                  --------\r\n                                                  33  6  9\r\n\r\nThis is at the rate of £90 15s. clear profit per acre, which is more\r\nthan double the worth of the land. I have not named the arrowroot\r\nplants, because I have planted my land with them again, but they might\r\nbe fairly put to the credit of the account. The above statement shows\r\nwhat may be done with good land and good management; but even if a man\r\ncan only clear £10 on an acre of land, he ought not to grumble.\r\n\r\nDr. Ure gives a most interesting and lucid account of the mode of\r\nmanufacture in the island of St. Vincent, where the plant is now\r\ncultivated with great success, and the root manufactured in a superior\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nIt grows there to the height of about three feet, and it sends down\r\nits tap root from twelve to eighteen inches into the ground. Its\r\nmaturity is known by the flagging and falling down of the leaves, an\r\nevent which takes place when the plant is from ten to twelve months'\r\nold. The roots being dug up with the hoe, are transported to the\r\nwashing-house, where they are thoroughly freed from all adhering\r\nearth, and next taken individually into the hand and deprived, by a\r\nknife, of every portion of their skins, while every unsound part is\r\ncut away. This process must be performed with great nicety, for the\r\ncuticle contains a resinous matter, which imparts color and a\r\ndisagreeable flavor to the fecula, which no subsequent treatment can\r\nremove. The skinned roots are thrown into a large cistern, with a\r\nperforated bottom, and there exposed to the action of a copious\r\ncascade of pure water, till this runs off quite unaltered. The\r\ncleansed roots are next put into the hopper of a mill, and are\r\nsubjected to the powerful pressure of two pairs of polished rollers of\r\nhard brass; the lower pair of rollers being set much closer together\r\nthan the upper. The starchy matter is thus ground into a pulp, which\r\nfalls into the receiver placed beneath, and is thence transferred to\r\nlarge fixed copper cylinders, tinned inside, and perforated at the\r\nbottom with numerous minute orifices, like a kitchen drainer. Within\r\nthese cylinders, wooden paddles are made to revolve with great\r\nvelocity, by the power of a water-wheel, at the same time that a\r\nstream of pure water is admitted from above. The paddle-arms beat out\r\nthe fecula from the fibres and parenchyma of the pulp, and discharge\r\nit in the form of a milk through the perforated bottom of the\r\ncylinder. This starchy water runs along pipes, and then through\r\nstrainers of fine muslin into large reservoirs, where, after the\r\nfecula has subsided, the supernatant water is drawn off, and fresh\r\nwater being let on, the whole is agitated and left again to repose.\r\nThis process of ablution is repeated till the water no longer acquires\r\nanything from the fecula. Finally, all the deposits of fecula of the\r\nday's work are collected into one cistern, and being covered and\r\nagitated with a fresh change of water, are allowed to settle till next\r\nmorning. The water being now let off, the deposit is skimmed with\r\npalette knives of German silver, to remove any of the superficial\r\nparts, in the slightest degree colored; and only the lower, purer, and\r\ndenser portion is prepared by drying for the market.\r\n\r\nOn the Hopewell estate, in St. Vincent, where the chief improvements\r\nhave been carried out, the drying-house is constructed like the\r\nhot-house of an English garden. But instead of plants it contains\r\nabout four dozen of drying pans, made of copper, 7½ feet by 4½ feet,\r\nand tinned inside. Each pan is supported on a carriage having iron\r\naxles, with _lignum vitæ_ wheels, like those of a railway carriage,\r\nand they run on rails. Immediately after sunrise, these carriages,\r\nwith their pans, covered with white gauze to exclude dust and insects,\r\nare run out into the open air, but if rain be apprehended they are run\r\nback under the glazed roof. In about four days the fecula is\r\nthoroughly dry and ready to be packed, with German silver shovels,\r\ninto tins or American flour barrels, lined with paper, attached with\r\narrowroot paste. The packages are never sent to this country in the\r\nhold of the ship, as their contents are easily tainted by noisome\r\neffluvia, of sugar, &c.\r\n\r\nArrowroot is much more nourishing than the starch of wheat or\r\npotatoes, and the flavor is purer. The fresh, root consists, according\r\nto Benzon, of 0.07 of volatile oil; 26 of starch (23 of which are\r\nobtained in the form of powder, while the other 3 must be extracted\r\nfrom the parenchyma in a paste, by boiling water); 1.48 of vegetable\r\nalbumen; 0.6 of a gummy extract; 0.25 of chloride of calcium; 6 of\r\ninsoluble fibrine; and 65.6 of water.\r\n\r\nArrowroot is often adulterated in this country with potato flour and\r\nother ingredients.\r\n\r\nDr. Lankester asserts that the value of arrowroot starch, as an\r\narticle of diet, is not greater than that of potato starch, and that\r\nthe yield of starch is not greater from the arrowroot than from\r\npotatoes; but this I must decidedly deny. Chemical analysis and\r\nexperience are proofs to the contrary.\r\n\r\nThe analogy arrowroot has to potato starch, has induced many persons\r\nto adulterate the former substance with it; and not only has this been\r\ndone, but I have known instances in which potato starch alone has been\r\nsold for the genuine foreign article. There is no harm in this, to a\r\ncertain extent; but it certainly is a very great fraud upon the public\r\n(and one for which the perpetrators ought to be most severely\r\npunished), to sell so cheap an article at the same price as one which\r\nis comparatively costly. There is, moreover, in potato starch, a\r\npeculiar taste, bringing to mind that of raw potatoes, from which the\r\ngenuine arrowroot is entirely free. This fraud, however, can be\r\nreadily detected; arrowroot is not quite so white as potato starch,\r\nand its grains are smaller, and have a pearly and very brilliant\r\nlustre; and further, it always contains peculiar clotted masses, more\r\nor less large, which have been formed by the adhesion of a multitude\r\nof grains during the drying. These masses crush very readily when\r\npressed between the fingers, and as before stated, arrowroot is free\r\nfrom that peculiar odor due to potato starch. This may be most readily\r\ndeveloped by mixing the suspected sample with hot water; if it be\r\ngenuine arrowroot, the mixture is inodorous, if potato starch, the\r\nsmell of raw potatoes is immediately developed. If a mixture of\r\narrowroot and potato starch be minutely observed by means of a good\r\nmicroscope, the grains of arrowroot may be readily detected; they are\r\nvery small and exceedingly regular in shape, whilst those of potato\r\nstarch are much larger, and very irregular in shape. But the most\r\nconvenient and delicate test of all, is that proposed by Dr.\r\nScharling, of Copenhagen. After mentioning the test by the microscope,\r\nhe goes on to state that he has obtained more favorable results by\r\nemploying diluted nitric acid; and that, if arrowroot or potato starch\r\nbe mixed with about two parts of concentrated nitric acid, both will\r\nimmediately assume a tough gelatinous state. This mass, when potato\r\nstarch is employed, is almost transparent, and when arrowroot is used,\r\nis nearly opaque, as in the case above mentioned, in which\r\nhydrochloric acid is substituted. A mixture of nitric acid and water,\r\nhowever, operates very differently on these two kinds of starch. The\r\nglutinous mass yielded by the potato starch, becomes in a very brief\r\nperiod so tough that the pestle employed for stirring the mixture is\r\nsufficiently agglutinated to the mortar, that the latter may be lifted\r\nfrom the table by its means. Arrowroot, on the other hand, requires\r\nfrom twenty-five to thirty minutes to acquire a like tenacity.\r\n\r\nThe _Lancet_ recently stated that, on a microscopical analysis of 50\r\nsamples of arrowroot, purchased indiscriminately of various London\r\ntradesmen, 22 were found to be adulterated. In 16 cases this\r\nadulteration consisted in the addition of a single inferior product\r\nmuch cheaper in price, such as potato flour, sago meal, or tapioca\r\nstarch, while in other instances there was a combination of these\r\narticles, potato flour being usually preponderant. Ten of the mixtures\r\ncontained scarcely a particle of the genuine Maranta or West India\r\narrowroot, for which they were sold. One consisted almost wholly of\r\nsago meal; two of potato flour and sago meal; two of potato flour,\r\nsago meal, and tapioca starch; one of tapioca starch; and four of\r\npotato arrowroot, or starch entirely. The worst specimens were those\r\nwhich were done up in canisters especially marked as \"Genuine West\r\nIndia arrowroot,\" or as being \"warranted free from adulteration;\" and\r\none, which contained a considerable quantity of potato flour, was\r\nparticularly recommended to invalids, and certified as the finest\r\nquality ever imported into this country. The profits to the vendors of\r\nthe inferior compounds are to be estimated from the fact that the\r\nprice of sago meal and potato starch is about 4d. per lb., while the\r\ngenuine Maranta arrowroot is from 1s. to 3s. 6d. per lb.\r\n\r\nThe arrowroot of Bermuda has long borne a high reputation, being\r\nmanufactured on a better principle and being therefore of superior\r\nquality to that produced in Antigua, St. Vincent, and other West\r\nIndian islands. The process is tedious and requires a good deal of\r\nlabor. There is no doubt, however, that the quality of the water has a\r\ngreat deal of influence on the fecula. Bermuda arrowroot is\r\nnecessarily made from rain water collected in tanks or reservoirs, and\r\nthe lime and the deposit from houses, &c., may alter its properties.\r\nAfter the root is taken from the ground it is placed in a mill, and is\r\nthereby cleansed of its exterior excrescences; it is then thoroughly\r\nwashed, when it is ready for the large machine, the principle of which\r\nis similar to the \"treadmill.\" A horse is placed on something like a\r\nplatform, and as he prances up and down, the machinery is set in play.\r\nA person stands at the end, and places the root in the wheel of the\r\nmachine, which, after being ground, falls into a trough of water.\r\nAfter going through this process, it is rewashed and then placed in\r\nvessels to dry in the sun. It is packed in boxes lined with blue paper\r\nor tin, and sent to the markets in England and America, where it\r\ngenerally meets with ready sale.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Agricultural Society of Bermuda, held in May,\r\n1840, Mr. W.M. Cox submitted a new arrowroot strainer which he had\r\ninvented. It consists of two cloth strainers fixed to hoops from 15 to\r\n20 inches in diameter. The strainers working one within the other, are\r\nkept in motion by a lever, moved by hand. The whole apparatus is not\r\nan expensive one, and is well adapted for aiding the manufacture of\r\narrowroot upon an expeditious and economical plan.\r\n\r\nA simple method by which starch may be extracted from the fecula with\r\nmuch purity consists in enclosing the flour in a muslin bag and\r\nsqueezing it with the fingers while submerged in clean water, by which\r\nprocess the starch passes out in a state of white powder and subsides.\r\nTwo essential constituents of flour are thus separated from each\r\nother; a viscid substance remains in the bag, which is called gluten,\r\nand the white powder deposited is starch.\r\n\r\nThe principal quarters from whence the supply is derived, are the\r\nBermudas, St. Vincent, Barbados and Grenada, in the West Indies;\r\nCeylon, and some other parts of the East--and a few of our settlements\r\non the West coast of Africa. The annual imports for home consumption\r\naverage 500 tons.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of arrowroot for the production of starch in St.\r\nVincent has increased enormously of late years. In 1835, the island\r\nproduced 41,397 lbs.; in 1845 it exported 828,842 lbs. The exports to\r\n15th June, 1851, were, 2,934 barrels, 2,083 half barrels, 5,610 tins.\r\nThe culture is year by year extending, and as, unlike that of the\r\nsugar cane, it may be carried on on a small scale with very little\r\noutlay of capital, we may reasonably anticipate a still further\r\nprogressive extension for some years to come. Arrowroot, when once\r\nestablished in virgin soil, produces several crops with very little\r\nculture. In the first half of 1851, 25,027 lbs. were shipped from\r\nMontego Bay, Jamaica. The quantity of arrowroot on which duty of 1s.\r\nper cwt. was paid in the six years ending 1840, was as follows:--\r\n\r\n               Cwts.\r\n  1835         3,581\r\n  1836         3,280\r\n  1837         2,858\r\n  1838         2,538\r\n  1839         2,264\r\n  1840         2,124\r\n\r\nThe imports in the last few years have been in\r\n\r\n               Cwt.\r\n  1847         8,040\r\n  1848        10,580\r\n  1849         9,252\r\n  1850        15,980\r\n  1851\r\n\r\nAbout 500 cwt. are re-exported.\r\n\r\nEast India arrowroot is procured in part from _Curcuma angustifolia_,\r\nknown locally as Tikoor in the East, and a similar kind of starch is\r\nyielded by _C. Zerumbet_, _C. rubescens_, _C. leucorhiza_, and\r\n_Alpinia Galanga_, the Galangale root of commerce. _C. angustifolia_\r\ngrows abundantly on the Malabar coast, and is cultivated about the\r\ndistricts of Patna, Sagur and the south-west frontier, Mysore,\r\nVizigapatam, and Canjam, Cochin and Tellicherry. It was discovered but\r\na few years ago growing wild in the forests extending from the banks\r\nof the Sona to Nugpore.\r\n\r\nThe particles of East India arrowroot are very unequal in size, but on\r\nthe average are larger than those of West India arrowroot.\r\n\r\nDr. Taylor, in his Topography of Dacca, speaks of fecula or starch\r\nbeing obtained from the Egyptian lotus (_Nymphæa lotus_), which is\r\nused by the native practitioners as a substitute for arrowroot.\r\n\r\nChinese arrowroot is said to be made from the root of _Nelumbium\r\nspeciosum_.\r\n\r\nThe original Indian arrowroot is extracted at Travancore, according to\r\nAinslie, from the root of the _Curcuma angustifolia_. It is easily\r\ndistinguished by its form, which is sometimes ovoid, sometimes\r\nelongated, of considerable size, rounded at one of the extremities,\r\nand terminating in a point at the other, often resembling a grain of\r\nrice.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of arrowroot on the southern borders of the\r\nEverglades, at Key West, Florida, bids fair to become as extensive and\r\nas profitable as at Bermuda, whence, at present, we receive the bulk\r\nof our supplies. The wild root, which the Indians call Compti, grows\r\nspontaneously over an immense area of otherwise barren land. It is\r\neasily gathered, and is first peeled in large hoppers ingeniously\r\ncontrived, and thrown into a cylinder and ground into an impalpable\r\npulp. It is then washed and dried in the sun, baked and broken into\r\nsmall lumps, when it is ready for the market. The article is\r\nextensively used in the Eastern woollen and cotton establishments, as\r\nwell as for family use. Arrowroot is cultivated in the interior of\r\nEast Florida with great success. It is also cultivated to a\r\nconsiderable extent in Georgia, and is, I understand, a profitable\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\nThe following is the process of manufacture:--The roots, when a year\r\nold, are dug up, and beaten in deep wooden mortars to a pulp; which is\r\nthen put into a tub of clean water, well washed, and the fibrous part\r\nthrown away. The milky liquor being passed through a sieve or coarse\r\ncloth, is suffered to settle, and the clean water is drawn off; at the\r\nbottom of the vessel is a white mass, which is again mixed with clean\r\nwater, and drained; lastly the mass is dried in the sun, and is pure\r\nstarch. Arrowroot can be kept without spoiling for a very long time.\r\n\r\nA considerable quantity of arrowroot is now produced in the Sandwich\r\nIslands. In 1841 arrowroot to the value of 3,320 dolls. was shipped,\r\nand in 1843, 35,140 lbs., valued at £1,405, was exported, principally\r\nto Tepic and San Blas, where it is used as starch for linen.\r\n\r\nA kind of arrowroot of very good quality was sent to the Great\r\nExhibition of 1851, by Sir R. Schomburgk, which is obtained in St.\r\nDomingo from the stems of a species of Zamia, called there Guanjiga;\r\nand the _Zamia Australis_, of Western Australia, yields even better\r\nfecula. The taste was unpleasant and salt, as if it had been immersed\r\nin lime. The other starch, from the Western Australian Zamia, in\r\nquality rivalled arrowroot. This fecula hangs together in chains,\r\nquite unlike the ordinary appearance of arrowroot when seen under the\r\nmicroscope.\r\n\r\nThe following figures show the exports of arrowroot from Bermuda:--\r\n\r\n             lbs.

In 1842, 150 boxes were\r\nexported; in 1843, 200; in 1844, 300; in 1845, 600 boxes.\r\n\r\nFrom Africa we now import a large quantity: 250 boxes were received in\r\n1846. Not unfrequently arrowroot from Africa has been sent to the West\r\nIndies in the ships with the liberated Africans, and thence\r\nre-exported to England, as of St. Vincent or Bermuda growth. The duty\r\non arrowroot, under the new tariff, is equalised on all kinds to 4½d.\r\nper lb.\r\n\r\nThe imports and home consumption of arrowroot have increased very\r\nlargely, as may be seen from the following figures:--\r\n\r\n                         Retained for home\r\n            Imports         consumption\r\n              lbs.              lbs.\r\n  1826       318,830           358,007\r\n  1830       449,723           516,587\r\n  1834       837,811           735,190\r\n  1835       287,966           895,406\r\n  1838       404,738           434,574\r\n  1839       303,489           224,792\r\n  1840       408,469           330,490\r\n  1841          --             454,893\r\n  1842       890,736           846,832\r\n  1846       905,072           981,120\r\n  1847     1,185,968         1,211,168\r\n  1848       906,304           933,744\r\n  1849     1,036,185         1,032,992\r\n  1850     1,789,774         1,414,669\r\n  1851     2,083,681         1,848,778\r\n  1852     2,139,390         2,024,316\r\n\r\nSALEP is the prepared and dried roots of several orchideous plants,\r\nand is sometimes sold in the state of powder. Indigenous salep is\r\nprocured, according to Dr. Perceval from _Orchis mascula_, _O.\r\nlatifolia_, _O. morio_, and other native plants of this order. On the\r\ncontinent it is obtained from _O. papilionaceo_, and _militaris_.\r\nOriental salep is procured from other orchideoe. Professor Royle states\r\nthat the salep of Kashmir is obtained from a species of Eulophia,\r\nprobably _E. virens_. Salep is also obtained from the tuberous roots\r\nof _Tacca pinnatifida_, and other species of the same genus, which are\r\nprincipally natives of the East Indies and the South Sea Islands.\r\n\r\nThe large fleshy tubers of tacca, when scraped and frequently washed,\r\nyield a nutritious fecula resembling arrowroot.\r\n\r\nSalep consists chiefly of bassorin, some soluble gum, and a little\r\nstarch. It forms an article of diet fitted for convalescents when\r\nboiled with water or milk. The price of salep is about eight guineas\r\nper cwt. in the London market. A little is exported from\r\nConstantinople, as I noticed a shipment of 66 casks in 1842; excellent\r\nspecimens from this quarter were shown in the Egyptian department of\r\nthe Great Exhibition in 1851. It was formerly a great deal used, but\r\nhas latterly been much superseded by other articles.\r\n\r\nMajor D. Williams (\"Journal of the Agri. and Hort. Soc. of India,\"\r\nvol. iv., part I), states that the tacca plant abounds in certain\r\nparts of the province of Arracan, where the Mugs prepare the farina\r\nfor export to the China market.\r\n\r\nAfter removing the peel, the root is grated on a fish-skin, and the\r\npulp having been strained through a coarse cloth, is washed three or\r\nfour times in water, and then dried in the sun.\r\n\r\nAccording to a recent examination of the plant by Mr. Nuttall\r\n(\"American Journal of Pharmacy,\" vol. ix., p. 305), the Otaheite salep\r\nis obtained from a new species of tacca, which he names _T. oceanica_.\r\n\r\nFor many years we have obtained from Tahiti, and other islands of the\r\nSouth Seas, this fecula, known by the name of Tahiti arrowroot,\r\nprobably the produce of _Tacca pinnatifida_. It is generally\r\nspherical, but also often ovoid, elliptic, or rounded, with a\r\nprolongation in the form of a neck, suddenly terminated by a plane.\r\n\r\nThe tacca plant grows at Zanzibar, and is found naturalised on the\r\nhigh islands of the Pacific. The art of preparing arrowroot from it is\r\naboriginal with the Polynesians and Feejeeans.\r\n\r\nAt Tahiti the fecula is procured by washing the tubers, scraping off\r\ntheir outer skin, and then reducing them to a pulp by friction, on a\r\nkind of rasp, made by winding coarse twine (formed of the coco-nut\r\nfibre) regularly round a board. The pulp is washed with sea water\r\nthrough a sieve, made of the fibrous web which protects the young\r\nfrond of the coco-nut palm. The strained liquor is received in a\r\nwooden trough, in which the fecula is deposited; and the supernatant\r\nliquor being poured off, the sediment is formed into balls, which are\r\ndried in the sun for twelve or twenty-four hours, then broken and\r\nreduced to powder, which is spread out in the sun further to dry. In\r\nsome parts of the world cakes of a large size are made of the meal,\r\nwhich form an article of diet in China, Cochin-Caina, Travancore, &c.,\r\nwhere they are eaten by the natives with some acid to subdue their\r\nacrimony.\r\n\r\nSome twenty varieties of the Ti plant (_Diacaena terminalis_) are\r\ncultivated in the Polynesian islands. There is, however, but one which\r\nis considered farinaceous and edible. In Java the root is considered a\r\nvaluable medicine in dysentery.\r\n\r\nWithin the last three or four years, considerable quantities of a\r\nfeculent substance, called Tous les mois, have been imported from the\r\nWest Indies. It is cultivated in Barbados, St. Kitts, and the French\r\nislands, and is said to be prepared by a tedious and troublesome\r\nprocess from the rhizomes of various species of _Canna Coccinea_,\r\n_Achiras_, _glauca_, and _edulis_. It approaches more nearly to potato\r\nstarch than to any other fecula, but its particles are larger. Like\r\nthe other amylaceous substances, it forms a valuable and nutritious\r\narticle of food for the invalid.\r\n\r\nThe large tuberous roots of the Canna are equal in size to the human\r\nhead. The plant attains in rich soils a stature of fourteen feet, and\r\nis identical, it is supposed, with the Achira of Choco, which has an\r\nesculent root highly esteemed; and my friend, Dr. Hamilton, of\r\nPlymouth, has named it provisionally, in consequence, _Canna achira_.\r\nThe starch of this root, he asserts, is superior to that of the\r\n_Maranta_.\r\n\r\n\r\nROOT CROPS.\r\n\r\nAmongst tuberous rooted plants, which serve as food for man in various\r\nquarters of the globe, the principal are the common potato, yam,\r\ncocoes or eddoes, sweet potatoes, taro, tacca, arrowroot, cassava, or\r\nmanioc, and the Apios (_Arracacha esculenta_). There are others of\r\nless importance, which may be incidentally mentioned. The roots of\r\n_Tropæolum tuberosum_ are eaten in Peru, those of _Ocymum tuberosum_\r\nin Java. In Kamschatka they use the root of the _Lilium Pomponium_ as\r\na substitute for the potato. In Brazil the _Helianthus tuberosus_. The\r\nrhizomæ and seed vessels of the Lotus form the principal food of the\r\naborigines of Australia. As a matter of curious information, I have\r\nalso briefly alluded to many other plants and roots, furnishing\r\nfarinaceous substance and support in different countries.\r\n\r\nThe comparative amount of human food that can be produced upon an acre\r\nfrom different crops, is worthy of great consideration. One hundred\r\nbushels of Indian corn per acre is not an uncommon crop. One peck per\r\nweek will not only sustain life, but give a man strength to labor, if\r\nthe stomach is properly toned to the amount of food. This, then, would\r\nfeed one man 400 weeks, or almost eight years! 400 bushels of potatoes\r\ncan also be raised upon an acre. This would give a bushel a week for\r\nthe same length of time; and the actual weight of an acre of sweet\r\npotatoes (_Convolvulus batatas_) is 21,344 lbs., which is not\r\nconsidered an extraordinary crop. This would feed a man (six pounds a\r\nday) for 3,557 days, or nine and two-third years!\r\n\r\nTo vary the diet we will occasionally give rice, which has been grown\r\nat the rate of 93 bushels to the acre, over an entire field. This, at\r\n45 lbs. to the bushel, would be 4,185 lbs.; or, at 28 lbs. to the\r\nbushel when husked, 2,604 lbs., which, at two pounds a day, would feed\r\na man 1,302 days, or more than three-and-a-half years!\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTATOES.\r\n\r\nThe common English or Irish potato (_Solanum tuberosum_), so\r\nextensively cultivated throughout most of the temperate countries of\r\nthe civilised globe, contributing as it does to the necessities of a\r\nlarge portion of the human race, as well as to the nourishment and\r\nfattening of stock, is regarded as of but little less importance in\r\nour national economy than wheat or other grain. It has been found in\r\nan indigenous state in Chili, on the mountains near Valparaiso and\r\nMendoza; also near Monte Video, Lima, Quito, as well as in Santa Fe de\r\nBogota, and more recently in Mexico, on the flanks of Orizaba.\r\n\r\nThe history of this plant, in connection with that of the sweet\r\npotato, is involved in obscurity, as the accounts of their\r\nintroduction into Europe are somewhat conflicting, and often they\r\nappear to be confounded with one another. The common kind was\r\ndoubtless introduced into Spain in the early part of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, from the neighbourhood of Quito, where, as well as in all\r\nSpanish countries, the tubers are known as papas. The first published\r\naccount of it we find on record is in \"_La Cronica del Peru_,\" by\r\nPedro de Cieca, printed at Seville, in 1553, in which it is described\r\nand illustrated by an engraving. From Spain it appears to have found\r\nits way into Italy, where it assumed the same name as the truffle. It\r\nwas received by Clusius, at Vienna, in 1598, in whose time it spread\r\nrapidly in the South of Europe, and even into Germany. It is said to\r\nhave found its way to England by a different route, having been\r\nbrought from Virginia by Raleigh colonists, in 1586, which would seem\r\nimprobable, as it was unknown in North America at that time, either\r\nwild or cultivated; and besides, Gough, in his edition of Camden's\r\n\"Britannia,\" says it was first planted by Sir Walter Raleigh, on his\r\nestate at Youghal, near Cork, and that it was cultivated in Ireland\r\nbefore its value was known in England. Gerarde, in his \"Herbal,\"\r\npublished in 1597, gives a figure of this plant, under the name of\r\n_Batata Virginiana_, to distinguish it from the _Batata edulis_, and\r\nrecommends the root to be eaten as a \"delicate dish,\" but not as a\r\ncommon food. \"The sweet potato,\" says Sir Joseph Banks, \"was used in\r\nEngland as a delicacy, long before the introduction of our potatoes.\r\nIt was imported in considerable quantities from Spain and the\r\nCanaries, and was supposed to possess the power of restoring decayed\r\nvigor.\" It is related that the common potato was accidentally\r\nintroduced into England from Ireland, at a period somewhat earlier\r\nthan that noticed by Gerarde, in consequence of the wreck of a vessel\r\non the coast of Lancashire, which had a quantity on board. In 1663 the\r\nRoyal Society of England took measures for the cultivation of this\r\nvegetable, with the view of preventing famine.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding its utility as a food became better known, no high\r\ncharacter was attached to it; and the writers on gardening towards the\r\nend of the seventeenth century, a hundred years or more after its\r\nintroduction, treated of it rather indifferently. \"They are much used\r\nin Ireland and America as bread,\" says one author, \"and may be\r\npropagated with advantage to poor people.\"\r\n\r\nThe famous nurserymen, Loudon and Wise, did not consider it worthy of\r\nnotice in their \"Complete Gardener,\" published in 1719. But its use\r\ngradually spread as its excellencies became better understood. It was\r\nnear the middle of the last century before it was generally known\r\neither in Britain or North America, since which it has been most\r\nextensively cultivated.\r\n\r\nThe period of the introduction of the common potato into the British\r\nNorth American colonies, is not precisely known. It is mentioned among\r\nthe products of Carolina and Virginia in 1749, and by Kalm as growing\r\nin New York the same year.\r\n\r\nThe culture of this root extends through the whole of Europe, a large\r\nportion of Asia, Australia, the southern and northern parts of Africa,\r\nand the adjacent islands. On the American continent, with the\r\nexception of some sections of the torrid zone, the culture ranges from\r\nLabrador on the east, and Nootka Sound on the west, to Cape Horn. It\r\nresists more effectually than the cereals the frosts of the north. In\r\nthe North American Union it is principally confined to the Northern,\r\nMiddle, and Western States, where, from the coolness of the climate it\r\nacquires a farinaceous consistence highly conducive to the support of\r\nanimal life. It has never been extensively cultivated in Florida,\r\nAlabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, probably from the greater\r\nfacility of raising the sweet potato, its more tropical rival. Its\r\nperfection, however, depends as much upon the soil as on the climate\r\nin which it grows; for in the red loam, on the banks of Bayou Boeuf, in\r\nLouisiana, where the land is new, it is said that tubers are produced\r\nas large, savory, and as free from water as any raised in other parts\r\nof the world. The same may be said of those grown at Bermuda, Madeira,\r\nthe Canaries, and numerous other ocean isles.\r\n\r\nThe chief varieties cultivated in the Northern States of America are\r\nthe carter, the kidneys, the pink-eyes, the mercer, the orange, the\r\nSault Ste. Marie, the merino, and Western red; in the Middle and\r\nWestern States, the mercer, the long red, or merino, the orange, and\r\nthe Western red. The yield varies from 50 to 400 bushels and upwards\r\nper acre, but generally it is below 200 bushels.\r\n\r\nWithin the last ten years an alarming disease, or \"rot,\" has attacked\r\nthe tubers of this plant, about the time they are fully grown. It has\r\nnot only appeared in nearly every part of America, but has spread\r\ndismay, at times, throughout Great Britain and Ireland, and has been\r\nfelt more or less seriously in every quarter of the globe.\r\n\r\nTo the greater uncertainty attending its cultivation of late years,\r\nmust be attributed the deficiency of the United States crop of 1849,\r\nas compared with that of 1839. This is one of the four agricultural\r\nproducts which, by the last census, appears smaller than ten years\r\nsince.--(\"American Census Reports for 1850.\")\r\n\r\nThe crops in Ireland, where the potato is the principal object of\r\nculture, vary from 1½ to 10½ tons per acre, according to the season;\r\nbut in the average of three years ending 1849, the annual growth of\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland amounted to nine million tons, which, at £3\r\nper ton, exhibits the value at £27,000,000 sterling. Ireland produced\r\nin 1847 a little over two million tons, the yield being 7¼ tons per\r\nacre. In 1848 the produce was 2,880,814 tons, averaging only four tons\r\nto the acre. In 1849, 4,014,122 tons, averaging 5½ tons to the acre.\r\nIn 1850, 3,954,990 tons; and in 1851, 4,441,022 tons; the average\r\nyield per acre not stated. In many parts of Scotland 24 tons to the\r\nacre are raised. The sales of potatoes in the principal metropolitan\r\nmarkets exceed 140,000 tons a year, which are irrespective of the\r\nsales which take place at railway stations, wharfs, shops, &c. The\r\nimports into the United Kingdom average about 70,000 tons annually.\r\nPotatoes are exported to the West Indies, Mediterranean, and other\r\nquarters. For emigrant ships, preserved or dried potato flour is now\r\nmuch used.\r\n\r\nThe following quantities of potato flour were imported from France in\r\nthe last few years:--\r\n\r\n             Cwts.\r\n  1848      17,222\r\n  1849       3,858\r\n  1850      12,591\r\n  1851       2,631\r\n\r\nWe also imported the following quantities of potatoes in the last\r\nfive years:--\r\n\r\n                Cwts.\r\n  1848          940,697\r\n  1849        1,417,867\r\n  1850        1,348,867\r\n  1851          636,771\r\n  1852          773,658\r\n\r\nThoroughly dried potatoes will always produce a crop free from\r\ndisease. Such is the positive assertion of Mr. Bollman, one of the\r\nprofessors in the Russian Agricultural Institution, at Gorigoretsky.\r\nIn a very interesting pamphlet[47] by this gentleman, it is asserted,\r\nas an unquestionable fact, that mere drying, if conducted at a\r\nsufficiently high temperature, and continued long enough, is a\r\ncomplete antidote to the disease.\r\n\r\nThe account given by Professor Bollman of the accident which led to\r\nthis discovery is as follows:--He had contrived a potato-setter, which\r\nhad the bad quality of destroying any sprouts that might be \"on the\r\nsets, and even of tearing away the rind. To harden the potatoes so as\r\nto protect them against this accident, he resolved to dry them. In the\r\nspring of 1850, he placed a lot in a very hot room, and at the end of\r\nthree weeks they were dry enough to plant. The potatoes came up well,\r\nand produced as good a crop as that of the neighbouring farmers, with\r\nthis difference only, that they had no disease, and the crop was,\r\ntherefore, upon the whole, more abundant. Professor Bollman tells us\r\nthat he regarded this as a mere accident; he, however, again dried his\r\nseed potatoes in 1851, and again his crop was abundant and free from\r\ndisease, while everywhere on the surrounding land they were much\r\naffected. This was too remarkable a circumstance not to excite\r\nattention, and in 1852 a third trial took place. All Mr. Bollman's own\r\nstock of potatoes being exhausted, he was obliged to purchase his\r\nseed, which bore unmistakable marks of having formed part of a crop\r\nthat had been severely diseased; some, in fact, were quite rotten.\r\nAfter keeping them about a month in a hot room, as before, he cut the\r\nlargest potatoes into quarters, and the smaller into halves, and left\r\nthem to dry for another week. Accidentally the drying was carried so\r\nfar that apprehensions were entertained of a very bad crop, if any.\r\nContrary to expectation, however, the sets pushed promptly, and grew\r\nso fast that excellent young potatoes were dug three weeks earlier\r\nthan usual. Eventually nine times the quantity planted was produced,\r\nand although the neighbouring fields were attacked, no trace of\r\ndisease could be found on either the herbage or the potatoes\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThis singular result, obtained in three successive years, led to\r\ninquiry as to whether any similar cases were on record. In the course\r\nof the investigation two other facts were elicited. It was discovered\r\nthat Mr. Losovsky (living in the government of Witebsk, in the\r\ndistrict of Sebege), had for four years adopted the plan of drying his\r\nseed potatoes, and that during that time there had been no disease on\r\nhis estate. It was again an accident which led to the practice of this\r\ngentleman. Five years ago, while his potatoes were digging, he put one\r\nin his pocket, and on returning home threw it on the stove (poele),\r\nwhere it remained forgotten till the spring. Having then chanced to\r\nobserve it, he had the curiosity to plant it, all dried up as it was,\r\nand obtained an abundant, healthy crop; since that time the practice\r\nof drying has been continued, and always with great success. Professor\r\nBollman remarks that it is usual in Russia, in many places, to\r\nsmoke-dry flax, wheat, and rye; and in the west of Russia, experienced\r\nproprietors prefer, for seed, onions that have been kept over the\r\nwinter in cottages without a chimney. Such onions are called _dymka_,\r\nwhich may be interpreted smoke-dried.\r\n\r\nThe second fact is this:--Mr. Wasileffsky, a gentlemen residing in the\r\ngovernment of Mohileff, is in the habit of keeping potatoes all the\r\nyear round, by storing them in the place where his hams are smoked. It\r\nhappened that in the spring of 1852 his seed potatoes, kept in the\r\nusual manner, were insufficient, and he made up the requisite quantity\r\nwith some of those which had been for a month in the smoking place.\r\nThese potatoes produced a capital crop, very little diseased, while at\r\nthe same time the crop from the sets which were not smoke-dried was\r\nextensively attacked by disease. Professor Bollman is of opinion that\r\nthere would have been no disease at all if the sets had been better\r\ndried.\r\n\r\nThe temperature required to produce the desired result is not very\r\nclearly made out. Mr. Bollman's room, in which his first potatoes were\r\ndried, was heated to about 72 degrees, and much higher. By way of\r\nexperiment he placed others in the chamber of the stove itself, where\r\nthe thermometer stood at 136 degrees, and more. He also ascertained\r\nthat the vitality of the potato is not affected, even if the rind is\r\ncharred. Those who have the use of a malt-kiln, or even a lime-kiln,\r\nmight try the effect of excessive drying, for a month seems to be long\r\nenough for the process.--(Gardener's Chronicle.)\r\n\r\nA Mr. Penoyer, of Western Saratoga, Illinois, publishes the following,\r\nwhich he recommends as a perfect cure and preventive of the potato\r\nrot, having tested it thoroughly four years with perfect success;\r\nwhile others in the same field, who did not use the preventive, lost\r\ntheir entire crop by the rot. It not only prevents the rot, but\r\nrestores the potato to its primitive vigor, and the product is not\r\nonly sound, but double the size, consequently producing twice the\r\nquantity on the same ground, and the vines grow much larger, and\r\nretain their freshness and vitality until the frost kills them. Aside\r\nfrom the cure of the rot, the farmers would be more than doubly\r\ncompensated for their trouble and expense in the increase and quality\r\nof the crop. The remedy or preventive is as follows:--\"Take one peck\r\nof fine salt and mix it thoroughly with half a bushel of Nova Scotia\r\nplaster or gypsum (the plaster is the best), and immediately after\r\nhoeing the potatoes the second time, or just as the young potato\r\nbegins to set, sprinkle on the main vines, next to the ground, a\r\ntablespoon full of the above mixture to each hill, and be sure to get\r\nit on the main vines, as it is found that the rot proceeds from a\r\nsting of an insect in the vine, and the mixture coming in contact with\r\nthe vine, kills the effect of it before it reaches the potato.\" I\r\ncannot but consider Professor Bollman's as the most important of the\r\ntwo remedies suggested.\r\n\r\nThe potato crop of the United States exceeds 100 million bushels,\r\nnearly all of which are consumed in the country; the average exports\r\nof the last eight years not having exceeded 160,000 bushels per annum.\r\n\r\nAccording to the census returns of 1840, the quantity of potatoes of\r\nall sorts raised in the Union, was 108,298,060 bushels; of 1850,\r\n104,055,989 bushels, of which 38,259,196 bushels were sweet potatoes.\r\n\r\nLast year (1852) there was under cultivation with potatoes in Canada,\r\nthe following extent of land:--\r\n\r\n                   Acres.                 Bushels.\r\n  Upper Canada     77,672     Produce     498,747\r\n  Lower Canada     73,244     Produce     456,111\r\n\r\nAbout 782,008 cwts. of potatoes are annually exported from the Canary\r\nIslands. In Prussia, 153 million hectolitres of potatoes were raised\r\nin 1849. In 1840 Van Diemen's Land produced 15,000 tons of potatoes,\r\non about 5,000 acres of land.\r\n\r\nThe potato is not yet an article of so much importance in France, as\r\nin England or the Low Countries, but within the last twenty years its\r\ncultivation has increased very rapidly. It is mostly grown where corn\r\nis the least cultivated. The quantity raised in 1818, was 29,231,867\r\nhectolitres, which had increased in 1835 to 71,982,814 hectolitres.\r\nAbout 2,000,000 hectolitres of chesnuts are also annually consumed in\r\nFrance, a portion of the rural population in some of the Central and\r\nSouthern Departments living almost entirely on them for half the year.\r\n\r\nIn Peru dried potatoes are thus prepared:--Small potatoes are boiled,\r\npeeled, and then dried in the sun, but the best are those dried by the\r\nsevere frosts on the mountains. In the Cordilleras they are covered\r\nwith ice, until they assume a horny appearance. Powdered, it is called\r\n_chimo_. They will keep for any length of time, and when used required\r\nto be bruised and soaked. If introduced as a vegetable substance in\r\nlong sea voyages, the potato thus dried would be found wholesome and\r\nnourishing. A large and profitable business is now carried on, in what\r\nis called \"preserved potatoes,\" for ships' use, prepared by Messrs.\r\nEdwards and Co., which are found exceedingly useful in the Royal Navy,\r\nin emigrant ships, for troops and other services, from their\r\nportability, nutritious properties, and being uninjured by climate.\r\n\r\nFew persons are probably aware of the quantity of potatoes used in\r\nEngland, America and the Continent, in the manufacture of starch,\r\narrowroot, and tapioca, &c., A starch manufactory in Mercer, Maine,\r\nUnited States, grinds from 16,000 to 24,000 bushels annually of\r\npotatoes, and makes 140,000 to 240,000 lbs. of starch, which finds a\r\nready market at Boston, at four dollars the hundred pounds. The New\r\nEngland manufacturers prefer it to Poland starch. Another starch\r\nmanufacturer, in Hampden, America, consumes 2,500 bushels per day. In\r\na single district in Bavaria, in Germany, 400,000 lbs. of sago and\r\nstarch are manufactured from potatoes; 100 lbs. of potatoes are said\r\nto yield 12 lbs. of starch. From experiments made in America, with\r\nthree varieties of potatoes, the long reds, Philadelphia, and\r\npink-eyes, it was found that the former yielded the most starch, viz.,\r\nabout 6 lbs. to the bushel. A bushel of potatoes weighs about 64 lbs.\r\nThe following table from Accum, gives the rate of starch and component\r\nparts per cent. in different varieties:--\r\n\r\n  +-------------------+--------+-------+---------+------+---------+------+\r\n  |       Sort.       |Fibrine.|Starch.|Vegetable| Gum. |Acids and|Water.|\r\n  |                   |        |       | Albumen.|      |  Salts. |      |\r\n  +-------------------+--------+-------+---------+------+---------+-------\r\n  |Red potatoes       |   7.0  |  15.0 |   1.4   |  4.1 |   5.1   | 75.0 |\r\n  |Ditto germinated   |   6.8  |  12.2 |   1.3   |  3.7 |         | 73.0 |\r\n  |Potato sprouts     |   2.8  |   0.4 |   0.4   |  3.3 |         | 93.0 |\r\n  |Kidney potatoes    |   8.8  |   9.1 |   0.8   |      |         | 81.3 |\r\n  |Large red ditto    |   6.0  |  12.9 |   0.7   |      |         | 78.0 |\r\n  |Sweet ditto        |   8.2  |  15.1 |   0.8   |                | 74.3 |\r\n  |Potato of Peru     |   5.2  |  15.0 |   1.9   |     1.9        | 76.0 |\r\n  |Ditto of England   |   6.8  |  12.9 |   1.1   |     1.7        | 77.5 |\r\n  |Onion potato       |   8.4  |  18.7 |   0.9   |     1.7        | 70.3 |\r\n  |Voigtland          |   7.1  |  15.4 |   1.2   |     2.0        | 74.3 |\r\n  |Cultivated in the  |        |       |         |                |      |\r\n  |  environs of Paris|   6.8  |  13.3 |   0.9   |  3.3 |   1.4   | 73.1 |\r\n  +-------------------+--------+-------+---------+------+---------+------+\r\n\r\nThe first six varieties were analysed by Einhoff, the next four by\r\nLamped, and the last named by Henry.\r\n\r\n\r\nYAMS.\r\n\r\nThe different species of yams have a wide range. In the West Indies\r\nthere are several varieties, having distinctive names, according to\r\nquality, color, &c., as the white yam, the red yam, the negro yam, the\r\ncreole yam, the afoo yam, the buck yam (_Dioscorea triphylla_), which\r\nis found wild in Java and the East; the Guinea yam, the Portuguese\r\nyam, the water yam, and the Indian yam, &c. The last is considered the\r\nmost farinaceous and delicate in its texture, resembling in size the\r\npotato; most of the other sorts are coarse, but still very nutritive\r\nand useful. The common yam (_Dioscorea sativa_) is indigenous to the\r\nEastern Islands and West Indies. The Guinea yam (_D. aculeata_) is a\r\nnative of the East. The Barbados or winged yam (_D. alata_?) has a\r\nwidely extended range, being common to India, Java, Brazil, and\r\nWestern Africa. The yam species are climbing plants, with handsome\r\nfoliage, of the simplest culture, which succeed well in any light,\r\nrich, or sandy soil, and are readily increased by dividing the\r\ntuberous roots. The Indian, Barbados, and red yams are planted in the\r\nWest Indies early in May, and dug early in the January following. If\r\nnot bruised, they will keep well packed in ashes, the first nine, and\r\nthe second and last twelvemonths. The Portuguese and Guinea yams are\r\nplanted early in January and dug in September. Creole yams and Tanias\r\nare dug in January. Sweet potatoes from January to March. In most of\r\nour colonies large crops of the finest descriptions of yams, cocos,\r\n&c., could be obtained, but the planting of ground provisions is too\r\nmuch neglected by all classes. From the tubers of yams of all sorts,\r\nand particularly the buck yam, starch is easily prepared, and of\r\nexcellent quality. Some varieties of the buck yam are purple-fleshed,\r\noften of a very deep tint, approaching to black, and although this is\r\nan objection, because it renders more washing necessary, yet even from\r\nthese the starch is at last obtained perfectly white.\r\n\r\nAs an edible root the buck yam, especially when grown in a light soil,\r\nis equal to the potato, if not superior to it. It does not, however,\r\nkeep for any length of time, and therefore could not be exported to\r\nEurope, unless the roots were sliced and dried.\r\n\r\nYams and sweet potatoes thrive well in the northern parts of\r\nAustralia; indeed the former are indigenous there, and constitute the\r\nchief article of vegetable food used by the natives. The yam was\r\nintroduced into Sweden, where it succeeded well, and bread, starch,\r\nand brandy were made from it, but it prefers a warmer climate.\r\n\r\nYams are occasionally brought to this country. When cooked, either by\r\nroasting or boiling, the root is even more nutritious than the potato,\r\nnor is it possessed of any unpalatable flavor, the pecularity being\r\nbetween that of rice and the potato. Dressed in milk, or mashed, they\r\nare absolutely a delicacy; and from the abundance in which they are\r\ncultivated in the West Indies and other parts, they promise to become\r\na most economical and nutritious substitute for the potato.\r\n\r\nThe yam frequently grows to the enormous size of forty or fifty pounds\r\nweight, but in this large state it is coarse-flavored and fibrous.\r\n\r\nAn acre of land is capable of producing 4½ tons of yams, and the same\r\nquantity of sweet potatoes, within the twelve months, or nine tons per\r\nacre for both, being nearly as much as the return obtained at home in\r\nthe cultivation of potatoes; and I have the authority of all\r\nanalytical chemists for saying that in point of value, as an article\r\nof food, the superiority is as two to one in favor of the tropical\r\nroots.\r\n\r\nThe kidney-rooted yam (_D. pentaphylla_), is indigenous to the\r\nPolynesian islands, and is sometimes cultivated for its roots. It is\r\ncalled _kawaii_ in the Feejee islands. _D. bulbifera_, a native of the\r\nEast, is also abundantly naturalised in the Polynesian islands, but is\r\nnot considered edible.\r\n\r\nThere are seven or eight kinds of yams grown in India. Two are of a\r\nremarkably fine flavor, one weighing as much as eighteen pounds, the\r\nother three pounds. These are found in the Tartar country.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOCOS OR EDDOES\r\n\r\n_Arum esculentum_.--This root has not hitherto been considered of\r\nsufficient importance to demand particular care in its cultivation,\r\nexcept by those who are engaged in agricultural pursuits, and derive\r\ntheir subsistence from the production of the soil. But though the\r\ncultivation of the root is almost unknown to the higher classes in\r\nsociety, and little regarded by planters in the colonies, it is a most\r\nvaluable article of consumption. Amongst the laboring population it is\r\nthe principal dependence for a supply of food. Long droughts may\r\ndisappoint the hopes of the yam crop, storms and blight may destroy\r\nthe plantain walks, but neither dry or wet weather materially injure\r\nthe coco; it will always make some return, and though it may not\r\nafford a plentiful crop, it will yield a sufficiency until a supply\r\ncan be had from other sources. For this reason the laborer in the West\r\nIndies always takes care to put in a good plant of cocos to his\r\nprovision ground as a stand by, and knowing their value, is perhaps\r\nthe only person who bestows any degree of care or attention upon them.\r\nPrevious to their emancipation, whole families of negroes lived upon\r\nthe produce of one provision ground, and the coco formed the main\r\narticle of their support. Where the soil is congenial to the white and\r\nblack Bourbon coco, the labor of one industrious person once a\r\nfortnight will raise a supply sufficient for the consumption of a\r\nfamily of six or seven persons. The coco begins to bear after the\r\nfirst year, and with common care and cultivation the same plant ought\r\nto give annually two or three returns for several years. In Jamaica, a\r\ndisease something similar to that affecting the potato, has been found\r\ninjurious to the coco root. This disease, which has baffled all\r\ninquiry as to its origin, affects the plants in and after the second\r\nyear of their being planted. The first indication of it is the change\r\nin the leaves, which gradually turn to a yellow hue, have a sickly\r\nappearance, and at length drop off at the surface of the earth. The\r\nstock or \"coco head,\" as it is called, below ground, having become\r\nrotten, nothing but a soft pulpy mass remains. In some fields every\r\nthird or fourth root is thus affected, in others much greater numbers\r\nare destroyed, so much so that the field requires to be almost\r\nentirely replanted, by which not only an expense is entailed, but a\r\nheavy loss sustained, from the field being thrown out of its regular\r\nbearing. The black coco seems to suffer less than the white.\r\n\r\nAnother species, the Taro (_Arum Colocasia_, _Colocasia esculenta_ and\r\n_macrorhizon_), is an important esculent root in the Polynesian\r\nislands. In the dry method of culture practised on the mountains of\r\nHawaii, the roots are protected by a covering of fern leaves. The\r\ncultivation of taro is hardly a process of multiplication, for the\r\ncrown of the root is perpetually replanted. As the plant endures for a\r\nseries of years, the tuberous roots serve at some of the rocky groups\r\nas a security against famine. It is also extensively cultivated in\r\nMadeira and Zanzibar, and has even withstood the climate of New\r\nZealand. It is grown also in Egypt, Syria, and some of the adjacent\r\ncountries, for its esculent roots. A species is cultivated in the\r\nDeccan, for the sake of the leaves, which form a substitute for\r\nspinach. Farina is obtained from the root of _Arum Rumphii_ in\r\nPolynesia.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET POTATOES.\r\n\r\nThe batatas, or camote of the Spanish colonies (_Convolvulus batatas_,\r\nLinn; _Batatas edulis_, of Choisy, and the _Ipomæa Batatas_ of other\r\nbotanists), belongs to a family of plants which has been split into\r\nseveral genera. It is a native of the East Indies, and of\r\nintertropical America, and was the \"potato\" of the old English writers\r\nin the early part of the fourteenth century. It was doubtless\r\nintroduced into Carolina, Georgia, and Virginia soon after their\r\nsettlement by the Europeans, being mentioned as one of the cultivated\r\nproducts of those colonies as early as the year 1648. It grows in\r\nexcessive abundance throughout the Southern States of America, and as\r\nfar north as New Jersey, and the southern part of Michigan. The\r\nvarieties cultivated there are the purple, the red, the yellow, and\r\nthe white, the former of which is confined to the South.\r\n\r\nThe amount of sweet potatoes exported from South Carolina in 1747-48,\r\nwas 700 bushels; that of the common potato exported from the United\r\nStates, 1820-21, 90,889,000 bushels; in 1830-31, 112,875,000 bushels;\r\nin 1840-41, 136,095,000 bushels; in 1850-51, 106,342,000 bushels.\r\n\r\nThe sweet potato is cultivated generally in all the intertropical\r\nregions, for the sake of its roots, and as a legume in temperate\r\ncountries. In the Southern States of North America, the culture ceases\r\nin Carolina under latitude 36 degs.; in Portugal and Spain it reaches\r\nto latitude 40 and 42 deg.; and as a legume its cultivation is\r\nattempted to the vicinity of Paris. In India it is a very common crop;\r\nits tubers are very similar to the potato, but have a sweeter taste,\r\nwhence the common name; but it must not be confounded with the\r\ntopinambur (_Helianthus tuberosus_), a native of Brazil, which is less\r\ncultivated. The root contains much saccharine and amylaceous matter.\r\n\r\nSeveral marked varieties of the sweet potato are raised in the\r\nPolynesian groups. In some islands it forms the principal object of\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nIt is grown in the Northern districts of New Zealand, at Zanzibar,\r\nMonomoisy, Bombay, and other parts of the East Indies. They are\r\nraised on the bare surface of the rock in some parts of the Hawaiian\r\nislands, and a sourish liquor is procured from them. It was early\r\ncultivated on the Western Coast of Africa, for the Portuguese Pilot\r\n(who set out on his voyages to the colony at St. Thomas, in the Gulf\r\nof Guinea) speaks of this plant, and states that it is called \"batata\"\r\nby the aboriginals of St. Domingo. They are abundant at Mocha and\r\nMuscat. Sweet potatoes form a principal and important crop in the\r\nBermudas.\r\n\r\nA valuable addition has lately been made to the votaries of the sweet\r\npotato in Alabama, supposed to be from Peru. A letter describing it\r\nsays:--\"It is altogether different and equally superior to any variety\r\nof this root hitherto known. It is productive, and attains a\r\nprodigious size, even upon the poorest sandy land, and the roots\r\nremain without change from the time of taking them out of the ground\r\nuntil the following May. The plant is singularly easy of cultivation,\r\ngrowing equally well from the slip or vine, the top or vine of the\r\nfull-grown plant being remarkably small; the inside is as white as\r\nsnow. It is dry and mealy, and the saccharine principle contained\r\nresembles in delicacy of flavor fine virgin honey.\"\r\n\r\nThere is in general a great error in cultivating this root, as most\r\npeople still plant in the old way, two or three sets in the hole,\r\nwhich is a great deal too close.\r\n\r\nWhen a piece of land is to be planted in sweet potatoes, it should be\r\ntop-dressed with some manure, to be dug or ploughed under a week or\r\ntwo before it is to be planted. Drills should be made two feet apart,\r\nand the potatoes placed in the drill about one foot asunder. From\r\neight to twelve to the pound are the best size for planting. The\r\n\"white upright\" kind, when intended for sets, should be taken up early\r\nin March, and kept about a month, so as to be quite dry before\r\nplanting. Abundant crops can rarely be raised from the stem of the\r\n\"uprights;\" the old potato, however, grows to a large size. I have\r\nplanted a potato weighing about an ounce, and dug it up in August,\r\nweighing over two pounds. The drills can be made with a small plough\r\nto great advantage, when a person understands it.\r\n\r\nThe best manure for the sweet potato is anything green, such as fresh\r\nseaweed, green oats, bushes, or anything of the kind, put in in\r\nabundance.\r\n\r\nCare should be taken to get early and good strong slips. A slip with\r\nabout six joints is quite long enough; three or four joints to be put\r\nunder ground, and the rest above. For slips, the land must be prepared\r\nas already described for the potatoes; this should be done before the\r\nslips are ready to cut.\r\n\r\nThe best way to plant slips is to drill, the same way as for the\r\npotatoes, only a little closer; then put the end of the slip in,\r\nleaving about two joints out of ground, placing them one foot apart.\r\nThe drills can be made in dry weather, so as not to have any delay\r\nwhen it rains; by this means a great many can be planted in a day.\r\n\r\nThe best land for sweet potatoes is the light sandy kind; a rich\r\nfriable black mould, or a rocky substratum; for hill sides, rocky\r\nravines, and places which would be called barren and unprofitable for\r\nother crops, are found to yield a good return when planted with sweet\r\npotatoes. The best time to plant slips to get stock from, is the\r\nlatter end of August or early in September, as the season may suit.\r\n\r\nThe sweet potato of Java, says Mr. Crawfurd, is the finest I ever met\r\nwith. Some are frequently of several pounds weight, and now and then\r\nhave been found of the enormous weight of 50 lbs. The sweetness is not\r\ndisagreeable to the palate, though considerable, and they contain a\r\nlarge portion of farinaceous matter, being as mealy as the best of our\r\nown potatoes. In Java it is cultivated in ordinary upland arable, or\r\nin the dry season as a green crop in succession to rice.\r\n\r\nA tuberous root (_Ocymum tuberosum_), an inhabitant of the hot plains,\r\nis frequently cultivated in Java. It is small, round, and much\r\nresembling in appearance the American potato, but has no great flavor.\r\nIts local name is _kantang_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASSAVA OR MANIOC.\r\n\r\nOf this plant, which is a shrub about six feet high, extensively grown\r\nfor its farinaceous root, there are several species, nearly all\r\nnatives of America, principally of Brazil, whence it derives one of\r\nits common names of Manihot or Mandioc. Two species of Manihot have\r\nbeen found indigenous in South Australia. The varieties commonly\r\ncultivated for their roots, are the sweet and the bitter.\r\n\r\n1. Sweet cassava (_Janiphi_ (or _Jatropha_,) _Loeflingii_, Kunth;\r\n_Manihot Aipi_, of Pohl).--This species has a spindle-shaped root\r\nbrown externally, about six or seven ounces or more in weight, which\r\ncontains amylaceous matter, without any bitterness, and is used as\r\nfood, after being rasped and washed, so as to cleanse it from the\r\nfibrous matter, in the same manner as arrowroot is prepared. It is\r\ndistinguished from the bitter cassava by a tough ligneous fibre, which\r\nruns through the heart of the tuber. Manihot starch is sometimes\r\nimported into Europe under the name of Brazilian arrowroot. The\r\ncassava is known in Peru as _yucca_.\r\n\r\nA dry mixed soil is best suited to its culture. So exhausting is this\r\ncrop, that it cannot be raised more than two or three times\r\nsuccessively on the same land. The roots arrive at maturity in eight\r\nor nine months after planting, but may be kept in the ground a much\r\nlonger time without injury. Sweet cassava might be sliced, dried in\r\nthe sun, and sent to Europe in that state. In dry weather the process\r\nsucceeds remarkably well, and the dried slices keep for a considerable\r\ntime. Dr. Shier ascertained that when these sliced and dried roots\r\nwere first steeped and then boiled, they return to very nearly their\r\noriginal condition, and make an excellent substitute for the potato.\r\n\r\nThe plant thrives on even the poorest soil; the mode of planting is\r\nsimple. It consists in laying cuttings a foot long in square pits a\r\nfoot deep, and covering them with mould, leaving the upper ends open.\r\nFrom two to four pieces may be placed in each square. The planting\r\nought to be in the rainy season. The cuttings must be made from the\r\nfull-grown stem. A humid soil causes the root to decay, a dry soil is\r\ntherefore more adapted for its cultivation. As blossoms are\r\noccasionally plucked from potato plants, so the manihot or cassava is\r\ndeprived of its buds to increase the size of its roots. The raw root\r\nof the bitter species, when taken out of the ground, is poisonous--if\r\nexposed, however, to the sun for a short time, it is innocuous, and\r\nwhen boiled is quite wholesome.\r\n\r\nThe starch of the root of the manioc is prepared in the following\r\nmanner, as described by Dr. Ure:--\" The roots are washed and reduced\r\nto a pulp by means of a rasp or grater. The pulp is put into coarse\r\nstrong canvas bags, and thus submitted to the action of a powerful\r\npress, by which it parts with most of its noxious juice. As the active\r\nprinciple of this juice is volatile, it is easily dissipated by baking\r\nthe squeezed cakes of pulp upon a plate of hot iron. The pulp thus\r\ndried concretes into lumps, which become hard and friable as they\r\ncool. They are then broken into pieces, and laid out in the sun to\r\ndry. In this state they are a wholesome nutriment. These cakes\r\nconstitute the only provisions laid in by the natives, in their\r\nvoyages upon the Amazon. Boiled in water, with a little beef or\r\nmutton, they form a kind of soup similar to that of rice.\r\n\r\nThe cassava cakes sent to Europe are composed almost entirely of\r\nstarch, along with a few fibres of the ligneous matter. It may be\r\npurified by diffusion in warm water, passing the milky mixture through\r\na linen cloth, evaporating the straining liquid over the fire, with\r\nconstant agitation. The starch, dissolved by the heat, thickens as the\r\nwater evaporates, but on being stirred it becomes granulated, and must\r\nbe finally dried in a proper stove.\r\n\r\n2. Bitter cassava (_Janipha Manihot_, of Kunth; _Jatropha Manihot_, of\r\nLinnæus; and _Manihot utilissima_, Pohl).--This species has a knotty\r\nroot, black externally, which is occasionally 30 lbs. in weight. In\r\nthe root there is much starchy matter deposited, usually along with a\r\npoisonous narcotic substance, which is said to be hydrocyanic acid.\r\nThe juice of the plant, when distilled, affords as a first product a\r\nliquor which, in the dose of thirty drops, will cause the death of a\r\nman in six minutes. It is doubted whether this acid pre-exists in the\r\nplant; some suppose it to be generated after it is grated down into a\r\npulp. It can be driven off by roasting, and then the starch is used in\r\nthe form of cassava bread. It is principally from the starch of the\r\nbitter cassava that tapioca is prepared by elutriation and granulating\r\non hot plates. This serves to agglutinate it into the form of\r\nconcretions, constituting the tapioca of commerce. This being starch\r\nvery nearly pure, is often prescribed by physicians as an aliment of\r\neasy digestion. A tolerably good imitation of it is made by beating,\r\nstirring, and drying potato starch in a similar way.\r\n\r\nThe grated starch of the roots, floated in water, is spontaneously\r\ndeposited, and when repeatedly washed and dried in the sun, forms\r\ncassava flour, called \"Moussache\" by the French.\r\n\r\nThe juice of the bitter cassava, mixed with molasses and fermented,\r\nhas been made into an intoxicating liquor, which is much relished by\r\nthe negroes and Indians.\r\n\r\nThe concentrated juice of the bitter cassava, under the name of\r\ncassareep, forms the basis of the West India dish, \"pepper pot.\" One\r\nof its most remarkable properties is its highly antiseptic power,\r\npreserving meat that has been boiled in it for a much longer period\r\nthan can be done by any other culinary process. Cassareep was\r\noriginally an Indian preparation.\r\n\r\nThe manioc or cassava is cultivated in America, on both sides of the\r\nequator, to about latitude 30 degrees north and south. Among the\r\nmountains of intertropical America, it reaches to an elevation of\r\n3,200 feet. It is cultivated also in great abundance on the island of\r\nZanzibar, and among the negro tribes of Eastern Africa to the\r\nMonomoesy, inclusive; on the west coast of Africa, in Congo and\r\nGuinea. It appears not to have been introduced into Asia. The farina\r\nof the manioc is almost the only kind of meal used in Brazil, at least\r\nin the north, near the equator. An acre of manioc is said to yield as\r\nmuch nutriment as six acres of wheat. Meyen states, \"It is not\r\npossible sufficiently to praise the beautiful manioc plant.\" The\r\nIndians find in this a compensation for the rice and other cerealia of\r\nthe Old World. It has been carried from Brazil to the Mauritius and\r\nMadagascar.\r\n\r\nThe following quantities of Brazilian arrowroot, or tapioca, were\r\nimported in the undermentioned years:--\r\n\r\n                Cwts.\r\n  1833            942\r\n  1834            888\r\n  1835          1,663\r\n  1836          3,735\r\n  1837          2,142\r\n  1838            462\r\n  1839            402\r\n  1840            983\r\n  1841          1,870\r\n  1843          2,325\r\n\r\nSt. Lucia grows a considerable quantity of manioc; it exported of\r\ncassava flour in--\r\n\r\n              Barrels.\r\n  1827            8\r\n  1828          814\r\n  1829          279\r\n  1830           99\r\n  1831           59\r\n  1834          713\r\n\r\nThe cassava root grows abundantly in most of the West India islands\r\nand tropical America; the trouble of planting is inconsiderable, and\r\nthe profit arising from its manufacture, even by the common process of\r\nhand-grating, is immense. I should be glad if I could induce the\r\nenterprising of our colonial settlers to give this a fair trial, as\r\nwell as encourage the present growers to increase their crops and\r\nimprove the quality of the article, so as to render it suitable for\r\nthe English market. The manufacture of starch will one of these days\r\nbecome a productive source of colonial wealth. Since cassava was first\r\ngrown in the West, its capabilities as a starch-producer have, to a\r\ncertain extent, been known, and for that purpose it has been in\r\nlimited use.\r\n\r\nMr. James Glen, of Haagsbosch plantation, Demerara, has recently\r\ntested its value as an article of export, and added it to the other\r\nindustrial resources of that colony.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman, by erecting machinery on his plantation for grinding\r\nthe root and preparing the starch of the bitter cassava, has already\r\nshipped the article in considerable quantities to Europe, and it has\r\nbeen sold at a price which puts the profit upon sugar cultivation\r\ncompletely to the blush. His agent in Glasgow writes, that any\r\nquantity (like that already shipped) can command a ready sale at 9d.\r\nper lb. Its use is co-extensive, or nearly so, with that of sugar. The\r\nproductive capabilities of the soil are not perhaps generally known;\r\nnor is it necessary that, to pay the grower there, it should bring\r\neven half that price. A sample of a ton, which was prepared at\r\nHaagsbosch in 1841, was submitted for examination to Dr. Shier, at the\r\ncolonial laboratory, Georgetown, who admitted it to be a beautiful\r\nspecimen of starch, although it had undergone but _one_ washing. The\r\nroot from which it was made, was planted eight or nine months\r\npreviously, upon an acre of soil, which had never undergone any\r\npreparation of ploughing, or been broken and turned up in any way. The\r\nplants were never weeded after they had begun to spring, nor were they\r\ntended or disturbed until they were ripe and pulled up. The expense of\r\nplanting the acre was five dollars, and reaping this crop would, I\r\nsuppose, amount to as much more, say £2 in all. The green cassava was\r\nnever weighed, but the acre yielded fully a ton of starch--equal, at\r\n9d. per lb., to £84.\r\n\r\nThe experimental researches of Dr. Shier have led him to believe that\r\nthe green bitter cassava will give one-fifth its weight of starch. If\r\nthis be the case the return per acre would, under favorable\r\ncircumstances, when the land is properly worked, be enormous. On an\r\nestate at Essequibo, a short time ago, an acre of cassava, grown in\r\nfine permeable soil, was lifted and weighed; it yielded 25 tons of\r\ngreen cassava. Such a return as this per acre would enable our West\r\nIndia colonies to inundate Great Britain with food, and at a rate\r\nwhich would make flour to be considered a luxury. Dr. Shier is\r\nconvinced that, in thorough drained land, where the roots could\r\npenetrate the soil, and where its permeability would permit of their\r\nindefinite expansion, a return of 25 tons an acre might uniformly be\r\ncalculated upon. What a blessing, not only for those colonies, but for\r\nthe world, would the introduction be of this cheap and nutritious\r\nsubstitute for the potato.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW TUBEROUS PLANTS RECOMMENDED AS SUBSTITUTES FOR THE POTATO.\r\n\r\nIn the present disturbed state of the grain markets of Europe, the\r\nadvantage of cultivating plants which directly or indirectly can form\r\na substitute for the potato, admits of no doubt. It appears to me,\r\nmoreover, that when the way is once opened up, even under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, the tropical colonies of Great Britain, without\r\ndiminishing the quantity of sugar and coffee they produce, could\r\nadvantageously supply the British market with the purest starches, and\r\npossibly also with various other articles of farinaceous food.\r\nAnything that will lead the planters to a more varied cultivation than\r\nthe present uniform and persistent one, will be advantageous to our\r\ncolonies; and the growth of farinaceous root crops for exportation,\r\ncannot fail to produce most beneficial effects on that class of the\r\npeasantry in the British possessions, who are owners of small lots of\r\nland, which at present they either totally neglect, or cultivate most\r\nimperfectly.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, Dr. A. Gesner, one of my correspondents, called attention, in\r\nmy \"Colonial Magazine,\" to two indigenous roots of North America,\r\nwhich he thought deserving special attention. These were _Apios\r\ntuberosa_, and _Claytonia acutiflora_, _or Virginiana_.\r\n\r\n1. _A. tuberosa_ (Boerhave), or _Glycine Apios_.--This plant is common\r\nthroughout the Northern and Southern States of America, and is also\r\nmet with in the lower British North American Provinces. It is known\r\nunder the native name of _Saa-ga-ban_ by the Micmac Indians, by whom\r\nthe pear-shaped roots are used as an article of food. Like the\r\n_Arachis hypogæa_, it belongs to the Leguminosæ family. The fruit and\r\nflower resemble those of the wood vetch. It is thus described in\r\nProfessor Eaton's \"Manual of Botany for North America,\" published in\r\n1836:--\"Color of corolla, blue and purple; time of flowering, July\r\n(and August in Nova Scotia), perennial; stem, twining; leaves,\r\npinnate, with seven lance-ovate leaflets; racemes shorter than the\r\nleaves, axillary; root, tuberous. Root very nutritive; ought to be\r\ngenerally cultivated.\"\r\n\r\nThe average size of the tubers is that of cherries, but a few are\r\nfound of much larger dimensions. In their appearance they resemble the\r\ncommon potato, having apparently the peculiar indentations called\r\neyes. The skin of the tuber is of a rusty or blackish brown color. The\r\ninterior is very white, and the root has the taste and odor of the\r\ncommon potato. The Indians state that the roots, if kept either in a\r\ndry or moist state, will not suffer any decay for a lengthened period.\r\nThey are very farinaceous, and contain a large per centage of starch,\r\nwhich resembles that of wheat; by being dried the tuber shrinks a\r\nlittle, but it immediately expands on being thrown into warm water. It\r\ncontains much nutritive matter, is wholesome, and I have no doubt, if\r\nproperly cultivated, it will prove to be very prolific. The tubers are\r\nsituated a few inches below the surface of the soil, and are strung\r\ntogether like beads by a strong ligament.\r\n\r\nA similar kind of earth-nut, or tuberous root, probably the _Glycine\r\nsubterranea_ of Linnæus, the Voandzou of Madagascar, is extensively\r\ncultivated in various parts of Africa.\r\n\r\n2. _Claytonia acutiflora_ or _Virginiana_, the Musquash of the Micmac\r\nIndians, is found throughout the Northern and Southern States of North\r\nAmerica. It is thus described by Prof. Eaton, \"Man. Bot. N.A.\"--\"Color\r\nof corolla, white and red; situation, alpine, perennial; leaves,\r\nlinear, lance-ovate; petals, obovate, retuse; leaves of the calyx,\r\nsomewhat acute; root, tuberous. It blossoms in May. The seed is ripe\r\nin June, when the plant disappears.\"\r\n\r\nThese roots may be collected along the sea coasts and principal lakes\r\nand rivers of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward's Island,\r\nalthough they are not plentiful, for they are greedily devoured by\r\nsome of the wild animals, and wherever swine have been permitted to\r\nrun at large they have been destroyed.\r\n\r\nDr. Gesner shipped several bushels of the saa-ga-ban to the principal\r\nagricultural societies in Great Britain, also to Halifax, and Nova\r\nScotia. The ordinary potato of this country does not yield more than\r\n14 per cent. of starch, and it contains 76 per cent. of water. From\r\nthe best saa-ga-ban Dr. Gesner obtained 21 per cent. of starch, and\r\nthe quantity of water is reduced to 50 per cent. It also contains\r\nvegetable albumen, gum, and sugar. From these facts it is evident that\r\nthe saa-ga-ban is much more nutritive than the potato, and the weight\r\nof the tubers, in their wild state, compared with the weight of the\r\nslender vine in the best samples, is equal in proportion to the common\r\ncultivated potato in its ordinary growth. The starch is very white,\r\nand closely resembles that made from the arrowroot. It is not\r\nimprobable that the quantity of water in the tuber will be increased\r\nby cultivation; yet the fibrous parenchyma will be reduced, and taken\r\naltogether, the nutritive properties will be increased; if the plant\r\nimprove as much by cultivation as the potato and many others have\r\ndone, its success is certain.\r\n\r\nThe North American Indians have several wild roots which they dig up\r\nfor sustenance when other food is exhausted. Among these are--1st, the\r\nmendo, or wild sweet potato; 2nd, the tip-sin-ah, or wild prairie\r\nturnip; 3rd, the omen-e-chah, or wild bean. The first is found\r\nthroughout the valleys of the Mississippi and St. Peter's, about the\r\nbasis of bluffs, in rather moist but soft and rich ground. The plant\r\nresembles the sweet potato, and the root is similar in taste and\r\ngrowth. It does not grow so large or long as the cultivated sweet\r\npotato, but I should have thought it the same, were it not that the\r\nwild potato is not affected by the frost. A woman will dig from a peck\r\nto half a bushel a day.\r\n\r\nThe Indians eat them, simply boiled in water, but prefer them cooked\r\nwith fat meat.\r\n\r\nThe wild potato, of the north-west of America, is a general article of\r\nfood; it is called by them wabessepin; it resembles the common potato,\r\nis mealy when boiled, and grows only in wet clay ground, about one and\r\na half feet deep. The crane potato, called sitchauc-wabessepin, is of\r\nthe same kind, but inferior in quality. The Indians use these for food\r\nas well as the memomine, and another long and slender root called\r\nwatappinee. Probably it is the first of these that is referred to by\r\nNicollet, as the prairie potato. \"All the high prairies (he says)\r\nabound with the silver-leafed _Psoralia_, which is the prairie turnip\r\nof the Americans, the _pomme des prairies_ of the Canadians, and\r\nfurnishes an invaluable food to the Indians.\" There are several\r\nspecies of _Psoralia_, viz., _esculenta_, _argophylla_, _cuspidata_,\r\nand _lanceolata_.\r\n\r\nThe prairie turnip grows on the high dry prairies, one or two\r\ntogether, in size from that of a small hen's egg to that of a goose\r\negg, and of the same form. They have a thick black or brown bark, but\r\nare nearly pure white inside, with very little moisture. They are met\r\nwith four to eight inches below the surface, and are dug by the women\r\nwith a long pointed stick, forced into the ground and used as a lever.\r\nThey are eaten boiled and mashed like a turnip, or are split open and\r\ndried for future use. In this state they resemble pieces of chalk. It\r\nis said that when thus dried they may be ground into flour, and that\r\nthey make a very palatable and nutritious bread. M. Lamare Picot, a\r\nFrench naturalist, has lately incurred a very considerable expense to\r\nobtain the seed, which he has carried to France, believing that it is\r\ncapable of cultivation, and may form a substitute both for potato and\r\nwheat.\r\n\r\nThe wild bean is found in all parts of the valleys where the land is\r\nmoist and rich. It is of the size of a large white bean, with a rich\r\nand very pleasant flavor. When used in a stew, I have thought it\r\nsuperior to any garden vegetable I had ever tasted. The Indians are\r\nvery fond of them, and pigeons get fat on them in spring. The plant is\r\na slender vine, from two to four feet in height, with small pods two\r\nto three inches long, containing three to five small beans. The pod\r\ndries and opens, the beans fall to the ground, and in spring take root\r\nand grow again. The beans on the ground are gathered by the Indians,\r\nwho sometimes find a peck at once, gathered by mice for their winter\r\nstore.\r\n\r\nThere are also several kinds of edible roots growing in the ponds or\r\nsmall lakes, which are gathered by the Indians for food.\r\n\r\nThe _psui-cinh-chah_, or swamp potato, is found in mud and water,\r\nabout three feet deep. The leaf is as large as the cabbage leaf. The\r\nstem has but one leaf, which has, as it were, two horns or points. The\r\nroot is obtained by the Indian women; they wade into the water and\r\nloosen the root with their feet, which then floats, and is picked up\r\nand thrown into a canoe. It is of an oblong shape, of a whitish\r\nyellow, with four black rings around it, of a slightly pungent taste,\r\nand not disagreeable when eaten with salt or meat.\r\n\r\nThe _psui-chah_, with a stem and leaf similar to the last, has a root\r\nabout the size of a large hickory-nut. They grow in deep water, and\r\nbeing smaller are much more difficult to get, but the Indians prefer\r\nthem; they have an agreeable taste, and are harder and firmer when\r\ncooked. Both these roots are found in large quantities in the musk-rat\r\nlodges, stored by them for winter use.\r\n\r\nThe _ta-wah-pah_, with a stem, leaf, and yellow flower, like the\r\npond-lily, is found in the lakes, in water and mud, from four to five\r\nfeet deep. The Indian women dive for them, and frequently obtain as\r\nmany as they are able to carry. The root is from one to two feet in\r\nheight, very porous; there are as many as six or eight cells running\r\nthe whole length of the root. It is very difficult to describe the\r\nflavor. It is slightly sweet and glutinous, and is generally boiled\r\nwith wild fowl, but is occasionally roasted.\r\n\r\nIn his exploring expedition into the interior of Guiana, in the region\r\nof the Upper Essequibo, Sir E. Schomburgk notices the discovery of a\r\nvariety of Leguminosæ, whose tubers grow to an enormous size, fully\r\nequal to the largest yam. These roots were not, at the time he was\r\nthere, in full perfection, but their taste was somewhat between the\r\nyam and the sweet potato. The Taruma Indians called them Cuyupa. The\r\nroots are considered fit for use when the herb above ground dies. Sir\r\nRobert brought a few of the seeds of the plant with him on his return\r\nto Demerara.\r\n\r\nTwo interesting productions have been recently introduced into the\r\nJardin des Plantes, at Paris, from the Ecuador, by M. Bourcier,\r\nformerly Consul-General of France in that country. One is the red and\r\nyellow _ocas_, which is of the form of a long potato, and has the\r\ntaste of a chesnut; the other is the _milloco_, which has the taste\r\nand form of our best potatoes. These two roots, which are found in\r\ngreat abundance in the neighbourhood of Quito, grow readily in the\r\npoorest land. The _oca_ is cultivated in the fields of Mexico, but\r\nonly succeeds in the warmer districts. From the bulbous roots of the\r\ncacomite, a species of _Tigridia_, a good flour is also prepared\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nStevenson (\"Travels in South America,\" vol. ii., p. 55) says, a root\r\ncalled the oca is cultivated in several of the colder provinces of\r\nPeru. \"This plant,\" he states, \"is of a moderate size, in appearance\r\nsomewhat like the acetous trefoil; the roots yellow, each about five\r\nor six inches long, and two in circumference. They have many eyes, and\r\nthe roots, several of which are yielded by one plant, are somewhat\r\ncurved. When boiled it is much sweeter than the camote or batata;\r\nindeed it appears to contain more saccharine matter than any root I\r\never tasted; if eaten raw it is very much like the chesnut. The roots\r\nmay be kept for many months in a dry place. The transplanting of the\r\noca (he adds) to England, where I am persuaded it would prosper, would\r\nadd another agreeable and useful esculent to our tables.\"\r\n\r\nThe Brussels paper, _L'Emancipation_, mentions that a root has been\r\ndiscovered by the Director of the Museum of Industry, in that place,\r\ndestined to take the place of the potato. It is the _Lathyrus\r\ntuberosus_, called by the peasants the earth mouse, on account of its\r\nform, and the earth chesnut on account of its taste. This plant exists\r\nonly in some localities of Lorraine and Burgundy. The Lathyrus has\r\nnever been cultivated, and it is thought that it will attain, with\r\ncultivation, the size of the potato. The French peasants have a\r\nprejudice against cultivating it, because they say it walks under\r\nground, and leaves the place it is planted in to go into the\r\nneighbouring field. The fact is, that it grows in a chaplet, of which\r\nthe bulbs are arranged along a root running horizontally, of which the\r\ntwo extremities are very rarely found, so that on taking up the\r\nhinder tubercles it continues its growth in front, which gives rise to\r\nthe saying that if the plant had only time enough, it would make the\r\ntour of the world.\r\n\r\nThe bulb of _Gastrodia sesamoides_ (R. Brown), a curious herbaceous\r\nspecies of orchis, native of New Holland, is edible, and preferred by\r\nthe aborigines to potatoes and other tuberous roots. Some of my\r\naccredited informants believe it might be turned to profitable\r\naccount, but being a parasitic plant, it could scarcely be\r\nsystematically cultivated. It flourishes in its wild state on loamy\r\nsoil in low or sloping grounds. The first indication of its vegetation\r\nin the spring, is the appearance of a whitish bulb above the sward, of\r\nan hemispherical shape, and about the size of a small egg. The dusky\r\nwhite covering resembles a fine white net, and within it is a pellucid\r\ngelatinous substance. Again within this is a firm kernel, about as\r\nlarge as a Spanish nut, and from this a fine fibrous root descends\r\ninto the soil. It is known in Van Diemen's Land, and other parts of\r\nAustralia, by the common name of native bread. Captain Hunter, in his\r\nJournal of the Transactions at Port Jackson on the first settlement of\r\nthe Convict Colony, speaks of finding large quantities of \"wild yams,\"\r\non which the natives fed, but the roots were not bigger than a walnut;\r\ntherefore it was probably this plant.\r\n\r\n_Arracacha esculenta_, of Bancroft and Decandolle (_Conium\r\nArracacha_).--This perennial herb is a native of South America, which,\r\nfrom its salubrious qualities, is extensively cultivated in the\r\nmountains of Venezuela and other parts of tropical and Southern\r\nAmerica, for culinary purposes. It is propagated by planting pieces of\r\nthe tuberous root, in each of which is an eye or shoot. The late Baron\r\nde Shack introduced it into Trinidad, from Caraccas, and it has thence\r\nbeen carried to the island of Grenada. It throve there remarkably\r\nwell, but has been unaccountably neglected. He also sent roots of this\r\nvaluable plant to London, Liverpool, and Glasgow. Although it bears\r\ncold better than the potato, it requires a warmer and more equal\r\ntemperature than most of the countries of Europe afford. It would,\r\nhowever, make an excellent addition to the culinary vegetables of many\r\ntropical countries, uniting the taste of the potato and parsnip, but\r\nbeing superior to both.\r\n\r\nThe arracacha has been introduced into the South of Europe, not as a\r\nsubstitute for, but as a provision against a failure of the potato\r\ncrop. It is highly recommended by the Rev. J.M. Wilson, in the \"Rural\r\nEncyclopædia.\"\r\n\r\nStevenson (\"Travels in South America,\" vol. ii., p. 383) says the\r\nyucas (cassava), camotes (sweet potatoes), and yams cultivated at\r\nEsmeraldas and that neighbourhood, were the finest he ever saw. \"It is\r\nnot uncommon for one of these roots to weigh upwards of twenty pounds.\r\nAt one place I saw a few plants of the yuca that had stood upwards of\r\ntwenty years, the owner having frequently bared the bottom of the\r\nplants and taken the ripe roots, after which, throwing up the earth\r\nagain, and allowing a sufficient time for new roots to grow, a\r\ncontinual succession of this excellent nutritious food was procured.\"\r\n\r\nThe Aipi grows in Brazil, and according to T. Ashe, may be eaten raw,\r\nand, when pressed, yields a pleasant juice for drink; or being\r\ninspissated by the heat of the sun, is kept either to be boiled and\r\neaten, or dissolved and drank. The tapinambar grows in Chili, and is\r\nused by the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe tapioca, or bay rash, a plant which grows about the out-islands of\r\nthe Bahamas group, was found of great use as a food plant to the\r\ninhabitants of Long Island, during a scarcity of food occasioned by\r\nthe drought in 1843. This root grows in the form of a large beet, and\r\nis from twelve to sixteen inches in length. It is entirely\r\nfarinaceous, and, when properly ground and prepared, makes good bread.\r\nIt fetches there four to six cents a pound.\r\n\r\nThe root of the kooyah plant (_Valeriana edulis_) is much used by some\r\nof the North American Indians as food. The root is of a very bright\r\nyellow color, with a peculiar taste and odor, and hence is called\r\n\"tobacco root.\" It is deprived of its strong poisonous qualities by\r\nbeing baked in the ground for about two days. A variety of other roots\r\nand tubers furnish them with food. Among these are kamas root\r\n(_Camassia esculenta_), which is highly esteemed; the bulb has a sweet\r\npleasant flavor, somewhat of the taste of preserved quince. It is a\r\nstrikingly handsome bulbous plant, with large beautiful purple\r\nflowers. Yampah root (_Anethum graveolens_) is a common article of\r\nfood with the Indians of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nThe roots of a thistle (_Cersium virginianium_, or _Carduus\r\nvirginianus_), which are about the ordinary size of carrots, are also\r\neaten by them. They are sweet and well flavored, but require a long\r\npreparation to fit them for use.\r\n\r\nThe people of Southern India and Ceylon have for many hundred years\r\nbeen in the habit of eating the bulb or root, which is the first shoot\r\nfrom the Palmyra nut, which forms the germ of the future tree, and is\r\nknown locally as _Pannam kilingoes_. It is about the size of a common\r\ncarrot, though nearly white. It forms a great article of food among\r\nthe natives for several months in the year; but Europeans dislike it\r\nfrom its being very bitter. Recent experiments have proved that a\r\nfarina superior to arrowroot can be obtained from it, prepared in the\r\nsame way; and 100 roots, costing 2½d., yield one and a-half to two\r\npounds of the flour.\r\n\r\nFrom the boiled inner bark of the Russian larch, mixed with rye flour,\r\nand afterwards buried a few hours in the snow, the hardy Siberian\r\nhunters prepare a sort of leaven, with which they supply the place of\r\ncommon leaven when the latter is destroyed, as it frequently is by the\r\nintense cold. The bark is nearly as valuable as oak bark. From the\r\ninner bark the Russians manufacture fine white gloves, not inferior to\r\nthose made of the most delicate chamois, while they are stronger,\r\ncooler, and more pleasant for wearing in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the _Cycas angulata_ forms the principal food of the\r\nAustralian aborigines during a portion of the year. They cut it into\r\nthin slices, which are first dried, afterwards soaked in water, and\r\nfinally packed up in sheets of tea-tree bark. In this condition it\r\nundergoes a species of fermentation; the deleterious properties of the\r\nfruit are destroyed, and a mealy substance with a musty flavor\r\nremains, which the blacks probably bake into cakes. They appear also\r\nto like the fruit of the _Pandanus_, of which large quantities were\r\nfound by Dr. Leichardt in their camps, soaking in water, contained in\r\nvessels formed of stringy bark.\r\n\r\nThe flour obtained from the seeds of Spurry (_Spergula sativa_), when\r\nmixed with that of wheat or rye, produces wholesome bread, for which\r\npurpose it is often used in Norway and Gothland. In New Zealand,\r\nbefore the introduction of the potato, the roots of the fern were\r\nlargely consumed.\r\n\r\nMany species of _Bolitus_ are used as food by the natives in Western\r\nAustralia, according to Drummond.\r\n\r\nThe thick tuberous roots of a climbing species of bean (_Pachyrhizus\r\nangulatus_, or _Dolichos bulbosus_) are cultivated and eaten in some\r\nparts of the Polynesian islands. The bulbous roots of some species of\r\nOrchideæ are eagerly sought after in New South Wales by the natives,\r\nbeing termed \"boyams,\" and highly esteemed as an article of food for\r\nthe viscid mucilage which they contain. The root of the Berar\r\n(_Caladium costatum_) is eaten by the natives of the Pedir coast\r\n(Achin), after being well washed.\r\n\r\nThe pignons or edible seeds of _Pinus Pinea_ are consumed occasionally\r\nin Italy. In Chili the cone or fruit of the _pehuen_, or _pino de la\r\ntierra_, are considered a great delicacy. The _pinones_ are sometimes\r\nboiled, and afterwards, by grinding them on a stone, converted into a\r\nkind of paste, from which very delicate pastry is made. The pine is\r\ncultivated in different parts of this province on account of its\r\nvaluable wood and the pinones. The seeds from the cones of the\r\nAuracanean pine, collected in autumn, furnish the Pawenches (from\r\n_pawen_ pine) and Auracanians with a very nutritious food. When\r\ncooked, the flavor is not unlike that of the chesnut, and as they will\r\nkeep for some time, they constitute, when the gathering season has\r\nbeen favorable, a great part of their diet.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of the cones of the nut pine (_Pinus monophyllus_), a new\r\nspecies described by Dr. Torrey, and alluded to by Col. Fremont in his\r\nexploring expedition to the Rocky Mountains, are largely used by the\r\nNorth American Indians. The nut is oily, of a most agreeable flavor,\r\nand must be very nutritious as it constitutes the principal\r\nsubsistence of many of the native tribes.\r\n\r\nThe cone of another magnificent pine (_Auracaria Bidwillii_),\r\nindigenous to the Eastern coast of Australia, about the Moreton Bay\r\ndistrict, is frequently met with twelve inches in diameter, and\r\ncontaining 150 edible seeds as large as a walnut. The aborigines\r\nroast these seeds, crack the husk between two stones, and eat them\r\nhot. They taste something like a yam or hard dry potato. The trees\r\nbear cones only once in four years, during a period of six months.\r\nThis season is held as a great festival by the aborigines of that\r\nlocality, called by them Bunga Bunga, and they congregate in greater\r\nnumbers than is known in any other part of Australia, frequently\r\ncoming from a distance of 300 miles. They grow sleek and fat upon this\r\ndiet. An Act has been passed by the legislature of the colony,\r\nprohibiting, under heavy pains and penalties, the demolition of those\r\ntrees, being the natural food of the natives.\r\n\r\nThe common people eat the seeds of the red sandal wood (_Adenanthera\r\nPavonina_) in the South of India. The pulp of the fruit of the\r\n_Adansonia digitata_, or monkey bread, is also used as an article of\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nSINGHARA OR WATER NUTS.--The large seeds of _Trapa bicornis_, a native\r\nof China, and of _T. bispinosa_ and _natans_, species indigenous to\r\nIndia, are sweet and eatable, and the aquatic plants which furnish\r\nthem are hence an extensive article of cultivation. In Cashmere and\r\nother parts of the East they are common food, and known under the name\r\nof Singhara nuts. In Cashmere the government obtains from these nuts\r\n£12,000 of annual revenue. Mr. Moorcroft mentions that Runjeet Sing\r\nderived nearly the same sum. From 96,000 to 128,000 loads of this nut\r\nare yielded annually by the lake of Ooller alone. The nut abounds in\r\nfecula. In China the kernel is used as an article of food, being\r\nroasted or boiled like the potato. The seeds of various species of\r\n_Nelumbium_, natives of the East Indies, Jamaica, and the United\r\nStates, also form articles of food. The fruit of _N. speciosum_ is\r\nsupposed to be the Egyptian bean of Pythagoras. The petioles and\r\npeduncles contain numerous spiral vessels, which have been used for\r\nwicks of candles. The fruit of _Willughbeia edulis_, a native of the\r\nEast, as its name implies, is eatable. The kernel of the mango can be\r\nreduced to an excellent flour for making bread.\r\n\r\nNot only from the Lichen tribe, but also from the Algæ, fungi, mosses\r\nand ferns man derives nutriment and valuable products. Some of the\r\ncryptogamic plants form considerable articles of commerce,\r\nparticularly as food plants, affording gelatinous and amylaceous\r\nmatter, and being useful in medicine and the arts.\r\n\r\n_Nostoe eduli_ is used in China as food; _Gelidium corneum_ enters\r\ninto the formation of the edible swallows' nests of the Japanese\r\nislands. Agar-agar moss is shipped from Singapore to the extent of\r\n13,000 tons a-year. Irish moss, Iceland moss, Ceylon moss, and some\r\nothers, are also of some importance. Iodine and kelp are prepared to a\r\nconsiderable extent from sea weeds; one species (_Fucus tenax_)\r\nfurnishes large supplies of glue to the Canton market, and the\r\norchilla weed is of great importance to the dyer. It is principally as\r\nfood that I have to speak of them in this section.\r\n\r\nIn some of the islands off the Scotch coasts, sea-wrack (_Fucus\r\nvesiculosus_) forms the chief support of horses and cattle in the\r\nwinter months. _F. serratus_ is similarly employed in Norway.\r\n\r\nThe _Laminaria saccharina_ is interesting from the fact of its\r\ncontaining sugar. It is highly esteemed in Japan, where it is\r\nextensively used as an article of diet, being first washed in cold\r\nwater and then boiled in milk or broth.\r\n\r\nCARRAGEEN, or IRISH ROCK MOSS, _Sphæroccus_ (_Chondus_) _crispus_,\r\nabounds on the Western Coast of Ireland, round the Orkneys, Hebrides,\r\nScilly Islands, &c. It is purplish white, and nearly transparent, and\r\nis largely imported to feed cattle and pigs in Yorkshire. It is also\r\nused for dressing the warp of webs in the loom, and mixing with the\r\npulp for sizing paper in the vat. It swells up like tragacanth in\r\nwater; and, by long decoction, affords a considerable quantity of a\r\nlight, nutritious, but nauseous jelly. It is sometimes sold as pearl\r\nmoss, and is employed in the place of gelatine or isinglass for\r\npreparing blanc-manges, jellies, &c. It fetches about £7 the ton.\r\n\r\nAGAR-AGAR, a sort of edible seaweed, or tripe de roche, is found\r\ngrowing on the rocks about the eastern islands that are covered by the\r\ntide. It is much used for making a kind of jelly, which is highly\r\nesteemed both by Europeans and natives for the delicacy of its flavor.\r\nThe first quality is worth about 30s. the picul (133 lbs.). An\r\ninferior kind is collected on the submerged banks in the neighbourhood\r\nof Macassar (Celebes), by the Bajow Laut, or Sea Gipsies. It is also\r\ncollected on the rocks about the settlement of Singapore, for export\r\nto China, where it is much used as a size for stiffening silks and for\r\nmaking jellies. It constitutes the bulk of the cargoes of the Chinese\r\njunks on their return voyage. The quantity shipped from Singapore is\r\nabout 10,000 piculs (12,500 tons) annually.\r\n\r\nICELAND MOSS (_Cetraria islandica_) combines valuable alimentary and\r\nmedicinal properties. It is imported in bags and barrels from Hamburg\r\nand Gothenburg, and is said to be the produce of Norway and Iceland.\r\nThe quantity consumed varies; in 1836, 20,599 lbs. paid duty; in 1840,\r\n6,462 lbs. In Carniola, swine, oxen, and horses, are fattened on it.\r\nBoiled in water or milk, and flavored to the palate with sugar, wine,\r\nand aromatics, it forms a very agreeable diet for invalids.\r\n\r\nCEYLON MOSS (_Gracelaria_, or _Gigartina, lichenoides_), a small and\r\ndelicate fucus, is well known for the amylaceous property it\r\npossesses, and the large proportion of true starch it furnishes. The\r\nfronds are filiform; the filaments much branched, and of a light\r\npurple color. It grows abundantly in the large lake or back-water\r\nwhich extends between Putlam and Calpentyr, Ceylon. It is collected by\r\nthe natives principally during the south-west monsoon, when it becomes\r\nseparated by the agitation of the water. The moss is spread on mats\r\nand dried in the sun for two or three days. It is then washed several\r\ntimes in fresh water, and again exposed to the sun, which bleaches it,\r\nafter which it is collected in heaps for exportation.\r\n\r\nProfessor O'Shaughnessy has given the best analysis of this moss,\r\nwhich he described under the name of _Fucus amylaceus_; 100 grains\r\nweight yielded the following proportions:--\r\n\r\n  Vegetable jelly                  54.50\r\n  True starch                      15.00\r\n  Ligneous fibre                   18.00\r\n  Sulphate and muriate of soda      6.50\r\n  Gum                               4.00\r\n  Sulphate and phosphate of lime    1.00\r\n                                   -----\r\n  Total                            99.00\r\n  With a trace of wax and iron.\r\n\r\nI observe among the imports into New Orleans, 911 bushels of Spanish\r\nmoss in 1849, and 1,394 bushels in 1848. I do not know precisely its\r\nuse, or from whence derived, but I believe it is chiefly used for\r\nstuffing cushions, mattresses, &c.\r\n\r\nFERN.--The rhizome of _Pteris esculenta_ is used as food in Australia,\r\nand that of _Marattia alata_ in the Sandwich Islands. The trunks of\r\nthe _Alsophila_, or tree fern, of the western side of Van Diemen's\r\nLand, and of the common tree fern, _Cibotium Billardieri_ (the\r\n_Dicksonia antarctica_, of Labillardiere), contain the edible pith or\r\nbread-fruit eaten by the natives. Many other species of ferns are\r\nesculent. Typha bread is prepared in Scinde from the pollen of the\r\nflowers of the _Typha elephantina_, and in New Zealand from another\r\nspecies of bulrush (_Typha utilis_).\r\n\r\n\"It must not be supposed, as some have believed, that the fern root,\r\nwherever it grows, is fit for food. On the contrary, it is only that\r\nfound in rich loose soils which contains fecula in sufficient quantity\r\nfor this purpose: in poorer ground the root contains proportionally\r\nmore fibre. We were now encamped on an alluvial flat in the valley of\r\nthe river, thirty or forty feet below the general level of the plain;\r\nand I observed that, even in this favourable spot, a great deal of\r\ndiscrimination was used in selecting the best roots, which was\r\ndiscoverable by their being crisp enough to break easily when bent:\r\nthose which would not stand this test being thrown aside. Here a\r\nquantity sufficient for several days was procured, and was packed in\r\nbaskets, to last till another spot equally favourable could be\r\nreached.\r\n\r\n\"The process of cooking fern root is very simple; for it is merely\r\nroasted on the fire, and afterwards bruised by means of a flat stone\r\nsimilar to a cobbler's lap-stone, and a wooden pestle. The long fibres\r\nwhich run like wires through the root are then easily drawn out; and\r\nthe remainder is pounded till it acquires the consistence of tough\r\ndough, in which state it is eaten, its taste being very like that of\r\ncassava bread. Sometimes it is sweetened with the juice of the 'tutu.'\r\n\r\n\"The natives consider that there is no better food than this for a\r\ntraveller, as it both appeases the cravings of hunger for a longer\r\nperiod than their other ordinary food, and renders the body less\r\nsensible to the fatigue of a long march. It is in this respect to the\r\nhuman frame, what oats or beans are to the horse. They have a song in\r\npraise of this root, which I have once or twice heard chanted on\r\noccasions of festivals, by a troop of young women who carry baskets of\r\nthe food intended for the guests.\"--(\"Shortland's New Zealand.\")\r\n\r\nI ought not to omit noticing the _Tuber cibarium_, a plant of the\r\nmushroom family, growing under ground, which furnishes the famous\r\ntruffle, so celebrated in the annals of cooking, of which immense\r\nquantities are imported, chiefly from the South of France. It is\r\ncommon also in Italy and Germany, and is often found in\r\nNorthamptonshire, and some other of our own counties. The \"kemmayes,\"\r\na desert plant of the truffle kind, is a great favorite with the\r\nArabs.\r\n\r\nIn Terra del Fuego the only vegetable food of the natives, besides a\r\nfew berries of a dwarf arbutus, is a species of globular bright yellow\r\nfungus (_Cyttaria Darwinii_), which grows in vast numbers on the beech\r\ntrees. In its tough and mature state it is collected in large\r\nquantities by the women and children, and eaten uncooked. It has a\r\nslightly sweet mucilaginous taste, with a faint smell like that of a\r\nmushroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.\r\n\r\nSPICES, AROMATIC CONDIMENTS, FRAGRANT WOODS, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe various spices and condiments which form so large an item in our\r\ncommercial imports, are obtained from the barks, the dried seeds, the\r\nfruit, flower-buds, and root-stocks, of different plants. The chief\r\naromatic barks comprise the cinnamon, cassia lignea, cascarilla, and\r\ncanella alba. The medicinal barks will be noticed elsewhere. The seeds\r\nand fruits include pepper, pimento, cardamoms, anise, nutmegs,\r\nchillies. The flower-buds of some furnish cloves and cassia buds; the\r\nroots supply ginger, galangale, turmeric, and ginseng. A few other\r\nuseful substances, such as vanilla, the costus, or putchuk, mace, soy,\r\nand some of the odoriferous woods I have included under this section.\r\n\r\n\r\nCINNAMON.\r\n\r\nThe true cinnamon of commerce is obtained from the inner bark of\r\n_Cinnamonum verum_, R. Brown; or _C. zeylanicum_; the _Laurus\r\ncinnamonum_, of Linnæus, a handsome looking tree, native of the East\r\nIndies. The island of Ceylon is the chief seat of its cultivation, and\r\nfor a long time the Dutch depended solely for their supply of this\r\nbark for the home market on the produce of the wild cinnamon trees in\r\nthe King of Kandy's territories there. At last, from the increasing\r\ndemand, they resorted to the growth and more careful culture of the\r\ntree themselves. About the year 1794, the cultivation had succeeded so\r\nwell that they were enabled to meet the demand for the spice from\r\ntrees of their own growth, independent of any supplies from the\r\nKandian monarch's territory.\r\n\r\nIn 1796, when this island fell into our hands, the local government\r\nendeavoured, after the former fashion of the Dutch, to restrain the\r\nproduction of this article of commerce within due bounds, by\r\ndestroying all above a certain quantity.\r\n\r\nGeneral Maitland, in 1805, and his successors in the government,\r\nseeing the folly of such a ridiculous policy, very wisely fostered and\r\npromoted the extended cultivation of cinnamon plantations.\r\n\r\nIn the island of Java, and in Cochin-China, cinnamon culture has\r\nwithin the last few years made considerable progress.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of the cinnamon tree are more or less acuminated, from five\r\nto eight inches long, by about three broad, growing in pairs opposite\r\neach other. They have three principal ribs, which come in contact at\r\nits base, but do not unite. The leaves, when first developed, are of a\r\nbright red hue, then of a pale yellow, and lastly of a dark shining\r\ngreen; when mature, they emit a strong aromatic odor if broken or\r\nrubbed in the hands, and have the pungent taste of cloves. The young\r\ntwigs of the true cinnamon tree are not downy, like those of the\r\ncassia bark. The plant blooms in January and February, and the seeds\r\nripen in July and August.\r\n\r\nThe blossoms grow on slender foot-stalks, of a pale yellow color, from\r\nthe axillæ of the leaves and the extremity of the branches. They are\r\nnumerous clusters of small white flowers, having a brownish shade in\r\nthe centre, about the same size as the lilac, which it resembles. The\r\nfruit is a drupe, about the size of a small hedge strawberry,\r\ncontaining one seed, and of the shape of an acorn, which when ripe is\r\nsoft and of a dark purple color.\r\n\r\nThe roots are fibrous, hard, and tough, covered with an odoriferous\r\nbark; on the outside of a greyish brown, and on the inside of a\r\nreddish hue. They strike about three feet into the earth, and spread\r\nto a considerable distance. Many of them smell strongly of camphor,\r\nwhich is sometimes extracted from them.\r\n\r\nThe trees in their wild state will grow ordinarily to the height of 30\r\nfeet. The trunk is about three feet in circumference, and throws out a\r\ngreat number of large spreading horizontal branches, clothed with\r\nthick foliage. When cultivated for their bark, the trees are not\r\npermitted to rise above the height of ten feet.\r\n\r\nThe true cinnamon tree (according to Mr. Crawfurd) is not a native of\r\nthe islands of the Eastern Archipelago; but Marshall, in his\r\ndescription and history of the tree (\"Annals of Philos,\" vol. x.)\r\nassigns very extensive limits to its cultivation. He asserts that it\r\nis found on the Malabar coast, in Cochin-China, and Tonquin, Sumatra,\r\nthe Soolo Archipelago, Borneo, Timor, the Nicobar and Philippine\r\nIslands. It has been transplanted, and grows well in the Mauritius,\r\nBourbon and the eastern coast of Africa; in the Brazils, Guiana, in\r\nSouth America, and Guadaloupe, Martinique, Tobago, and Jamaica; but\r\nproduces in the West a bark of very inferior quality to the Oriental.\r\n\r\nRumphius has remarked, that the trees which yield cinnamon, cassia,\r\nand clove bark (_Cinnamonum Culilaban_), though so much alike, are\r\nhardly ever found in the same countries.\r\n\r\nThe term clove bark has been applied to the barks of two different\r\ntrees belonging to the natural order _Laurineæ_. One of these barks is\r\nfrequently called \"Culilaban bark.\" It consists of almost flat\r\npieces, and is obtained from _Cinnamonum Culilaban_, a tree growing in\r\nAmboyna, and probably other parts of the Moluccas.\r\n\r\nThe other bark, known as clove bark, occurs in quills, which are\r\nimported from South America. Murray says it is produced by the _Myrtus\r\ncarophyllata_, a tree termed by Decandolle _Syzgium carophyllæum_. It\r\nappears, however, that this is an error, for both Nees and Von Martius\r\ndeclare it to be the produce of _Dicypellium caryophyllatum_; and the\r\nlast quoted authority states that this tree is the noblest of all the\r\nlaurels found in the Brazils, where it is called \"Pao Cravo.\" It grows\r\nat Para and Rio Negro.\r\n\r\nCinnamon may be propagated by seeds, plants, or layers; roots also, if\r\ncarefully transplanted, will thrive in favorable localities, and yield\r\nuseful shoots in twelve months. It is usually cultivated from suckers,\r\nwhich should not have more than three or four leaves, and require\r\ncontinual watering. If raised from seed, the young plants are kept in\r\na nursery for a year or two, and then transplanted; but the trees from\r\nseeds are longer arriving at maturity. The plants are kept well\r\nearthed about the roots to retain the moisture, and coco-nut husks are\r\nplaced above them, which in time form an excellent compost.\r\n\r\nA cinnamon plantation, even in a favorable locality, seldom yields\r\nmuch return until eight or nine years have elapsed.\r\n\r\nThe mode of cultivation pursued by the natives differs from that\r\nfollowed in the plantations of the Europeans. The native system is to\r\nallow the cinnamon to grow large before cutting; the European practice\r\nis to cut it young. The result is that the native produces quantity,\r\nbut coarse; the European produces quality, but less in quantity. I\r\nhave found, in conversation with the native growers, that they\r\nconsider the bush or tree decidedly weakened by its being kept down by\r\nconstant cutting twice a year; and that their plants are stronger and\r\nbetter. It is not absolutely an original opinion, but I think the two\r\nsystems might be judiciously blended. In cutting the cinnamon sticks\r\nfor peeling, as the Europeans do it twice a year, there is always risk\r\nof losing much valuable young wood, which is destroyed in slashing\r\ninto the bushes with _catties_ (bill-hooks) to take out that which is\r\nin a fit state for peeling, all of which is so much loss from the next\r\ncutting; and on this ground I should be inclined to advocate cutting\r\nonce a year. There are, I know, other considerations than the mere\r\ngrowth of the sticks to be taken into account. Of these may be named\r\nthe time when the bark peels best from the stick, which of course must\r\ndepend upon age as well as season, the excited or unexcited state of\r\nthe shoots, and their several effects upon the quality of the spice.\r\n\r\nWeeding the plantations does not seem to be of so much consequence, if\r\nthe shrub gets plenty of free air all round it.\r\n\r\nCinnamon land continues to yield abundantly crop after crop, not for\r\nyears, but for scores of years. The greater portion of the late\r\npreserved plantations in Ceylon were planted by the Dutch, one hundred\r\nyears ago, and the bushes are stated to be as vigorous as ever, and\r\nquite likely to go on yielding crops till the year 2000. This\r\nproductiveness can only be accounted for on Liebig's principle of\r\nreturning to the soil a portion of what we take from it. In the\r\noperation of peeling cinnamon, the tops and lateral branches are cut\r\noff, and left by the peelers on the ground close to the bushes. These,\r\nno doubt, furnish a considerable quantity of manure to the plants.\r\n\r\nThe general appearance of the plantation is that of a copse, with\r\nlaurel leaves and stems, about the thickness of hazel; occasionally a\r\ntree may be seen which, having been allowed to grow for seed, has\r\nreached a height of forty or fifty feet, with a trunk eighteen inches\r\nin diameter. When in full bloom, the cinnamon bushes have a very\r\nbeautiful appearance, the small white petals affording a most\r\nagreeable contrast with the flame-colored extremities of the upper,\r\nand the dark green of the inferior foliage, with the blossoms of\r\nvarious lovely parasitical plants.\r\n\r\nThe cinnamon tree flourishes only in a small portion of the island of\r\nCeylon. It is chiefly confined to the south-west angle, formed by the\r\nsea coast, from Tangalle in the south to Chilaw on the west. It is in\r\na climate of agreeable temperature, which is at once hot and moist;\r\nhot from its tropical position, and moist from the frequency and\r\nplentifulness of rains. The general level of the country is low, in\r\nthe midst of fresh-water lakes, divided from the sea by a narrow\r\nriband of land. And the water in the soil of the cinnamon gardens is\r\nof extraordinary purity, so as to be for that reason much in request\r\nin the neighbouring city as a beverage. This exact combination of\r\ninfluences does not occur anywhere else in the island, at least not in\r\nthe same degree.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation principally centres round Colombo, the capital and\r\nprincipal port.\r\n\r\nOn the hills and valleys, in the neighbourhood of Kandy, which have a\r\ntemperate climate, the tree flourishes well; a rather elevated\r\nsituation, with shelter, contributing to the luxuriance of the plants.\r\nThe best soil for it appears to be a pure quartz sand, which in some\r\nplaces rests on black moss or mould. From the surface to the depth of\r\na few inches, this sand is as fine in its nature and as pearly white\r\nin its appearance as the best table salt; but below that depth, and\r\nnear the roots of the bushes, the sand is greyish.\r\n\r\nA specimen of this soil being carefully dried by Dr. Davy, was found\r\nto consist of 98.5 silicious sand, 0.5 vegetable matter, and 1.1\r\nwater--in 100 parts. This circumstance impresses one very strongly on\r\nvisiting the cinnamon gardens; it seems so strange to see a plain of\r\npure quartz sand whitened in the sun, and yet covered over with a\r\nluxuriant growth of trees. In richer soils the aroma does not seem to\r\ndevelop itself in the same concentrated form.\r\n\r\nA mixture of loam and peat, with sand, is said, however, to form a\r\ngood soil in some localities. These plantations may well suggest a\r\ndoubt as to the truth of the proposition so unqualifiedly laid down by\r\nsome authors, that \"earth destitute of organic matter cannot sustain\r\nvegetation.\" Certainly it is not organic matter which supports the\r\ncinnamon trees of Colombo.\r\n\r\n_Peeling_.--The best cinnamon is obtained from the stalks or twigs,\r\nwhich shoot up in a cluster of eight or ten together from the roots,\r\nafter the parent bush or tree has been cut down. These shoots are cut\r\nonce in about three years, close to the ground. Great care is\r\nrequisite, both as to the exact size and age; for if the bark is too\r\nyoung, it has a green taste, if too old it is rough and gritty. These\r\nshoots yield an incomparably fine cinnamon bark. When cut for peeling\r\nthey are of various sizes and lengths, depending on the texture of the\r\nbark. These rods afford the hazel-like walking-sticks so much esteemed\r\nby strangers, and which, though difficult to be procured during the\r\nprevalence of the oppressive cinnamon regulations, may now be very\r\neasily obtained from proprietors of grounds producing that spice.\r\nCinnamon is barked at two periods of the year, between April and\r\nDecember. Those suckers which are considered fit for cutting, are\r\nusually about three-fourths of an inch in diameter, and five feet or\r\nmore long. The first operation is to strip them of the outside\r\npellicle of bark. The twigs are then ripped up lengthwise with the\r\npoint of a knife, and the liber or inner bark gradually loosened, till\r\nit can be entirely taken off. While drying they are cut up into long\r\nnarrow rolls, called \"quills,\" then stuck into one another, so as to\r\nform pipes about three or four feet long, which are afterwards made up\r\nin round bundles.\r\n\r\nDuring the first day the cinnamon is suspended under shelter upon open\r\nplatforms, and on the second day it is placed on wicker-work shelves,\r\nand exposed to the sun until sufficiently dry to be examined and\r\nsorted for shipment.\r\n\r\nIt is brought home in bags or bales of 80 or 90 lbs. weight, and\r\nclassed before export into three sorts; first, second, and third\r\nquality. The different kinds of cinnamon bark may be thus classified,\r\naccording to quality--\r\n\r\n1. That which ranks above all others in quality, is known by the\r\nSinghalese name of _penne_ or _rasse kuroondu_, sharp sweet, or honey\r\ncinnamon.\r\n\r\n2. _Naya kuroondu_, snake cinnamon.\r\n\r\n3. _Kapoorn kuroondu_, camphorated cinnamon, from the very strong\r\nsmell of camphor which it possesses. This variety is principally\r\nobtained from the plantations of the interior.\r\n\r\n4. _Kahate_ or _canalle kuroondu_, astringent cinnamon. In this\r\nspecies the bark peels off very easily, and smells agreeably when\r\nfresh, but it has a bitter taste.\r\n\r\n5. _Savel kuroondu_, mucilaginous or glutinous cinnamon. This sort\r\nacquires a very considerable degree of hardness, which the chewing of\r\nit sufficiently proves. It has otherwise little taste, and an\r\nungrateful smell; but the color is very fine, and it is often mixed\r\nwith the first and best sort; the color being much alike, excepting\r\nonly that in the good sort some few yellowish spots appear towards the\r\nextremities.\r\n\r\n6. _Dawool kuroondu_, or drum cinnamon. The wood of this tree, when\r\ngrown hard, is light and tough, and the natives make some of their\r\nvessels and drums of it. The bark is of a pale color.\r\n\r\n7. _Nika kuroondu_, wild cinnamon, whose leaf resembles that of the\r\nnicasol (_Vitex Negundo_). The bark of this tree has neither taste or\r\nsmell when peeled, and is made use of by the natives only in physic,\r\nand to extract an oil from to anoint their bodies.\r\n\r\n8. _Mal kuroondu_, flowering cinnamon, because this tree is always in\r\nblossom. The substance of the wood never becomes so solid and weighty\r\nin this as in the other named species, which are sometimes nine or ten\r\nfeet in circumference. If this ever-flowering cinnamon be cut or\r\nbored, a limpid water will issue out of the wound; but it is of use\r\nonly for the leaves and bark.\r\n\r\n9. _Toupat kuroondu_, trefoil cinnamon, of which there are three\r\nvarieties, which grow in the mountains and valleys of the interior\r\nabout Kandy.\r\n\r\n10. _We kuroondu_, white ant's cinnamon.\r\n\r\nThe first-named four of these are, however, alone varieties of the\r\n_Cinnamonum verum_.\r\n\r\nGood cinnamon is known by the following properties:--It is thin and\r\nrather pliable; it ought to be about the substance of royal paper, or\r\nsomewhat thicker. It admits of a considerable degree of pressure, and\r\nbends before it breaks; the fracture is then splintering. It is of a\r\nlight color, approaching to yellow, bordering but little upon the\r\nbrown; it possesses a sweetish taste, at the same time it is not\r\nstronger than can be borne without pain, and is not succeeded by any\r\nafter-taste. The more cinnamon departs from these characteristics, the\r\ncoarser and less serviceable it is esteemed; and it should be rejected\r\nif it be hard, and thick as a half-crown piece; if it be very dark\r\ncolored or brown; if it be very pungent and hot on the tongue, with a\r\ntaste bordering upon that of cloves, so that it cannot be suffered\r\nwithout pain. Particular care should be taken that it is not\r\nfalse-packed, or mixed with cinnamon of a common sort.\r\n\r\nThe following remarks, by Mr. Dunewille, of Malacca, as to the\r\nsuitability of the Straits' Settlements for cinnamon culture, are\r\ninteresting, although in some instances a repetition of previous\r\nobservations:--\r\n\r\n    It appears, from experience, that the soil of Ceylon is more\r\n    favorable to the growth of cinnamon than to that of any other\r\n    aromatic plant, and I find the climate of Ceylon, if at all, differs\r\n    but in a very slight degree from that of the Straits. I therefore\r\n    conclude that the spice, if cultivated in the Straits, will prove\r\n    superior to that of Ceylon, if one may judge from the various spices\r\n    that grow here almost wild, and it would moreover yield a better\r\n    return than in Ceylon. My supposition is confirmed from having seen\r\n    the spice which was prepared last year in Pringet by the Honorable\r\n    Resident Councillor of Malacca, and which I found to be equally as\r\n    good in every respect as that grown and cultivated in the maritime\r\n    provinces in Ceylon.\r\n\r\n    A sandy soil is that which is generally selected for cinnamon, but\r\n    other soils may be chosen also, such as a mixture of sandy with red\r\n    soil, free from quartz, gravel, or rock, also red and dark brown\r\n    soils. Such land in a flat country is preferable to hilly spots,\r\n    upon which, however, cinnamon also grows, and are known by the name\r\n    of the \"Kandyan Mountains.\" The soil that is rocky and stony under\r\n    the surface is bad, and not adapted for the cultivation of cinnamon,\r\n    as the trees would neither grow fast, nor yield a remunerative\r\n    return.\r\n\r\n    When a tract of land of the above description is selected, the whole\r\n    of the ground should be cleared, leaving a few trees for shade, to\r\n    which the laborers might return for rest and relaxation; these may\r\n    be from 50 to 60 feet apart. The trees felled should be well lopped,\r\n    burnt and cleared away, the stumps should be removed with roots,\r\n    after which they may be allowed to remain, in order to save expense\r\n    of carriage, merely by observing some degree of order in the\r\n    disposition, by forming regular rows, of which the intervening\r\n    spaces are planted with cinnamon. The ground being thus cleared,\r\n    holes may be dug at eight to ten feet apart, and of one foot square;\r\n    the distance from each plant will depend upon the nature of the\r\n    soil--that is, the poorer the soil, the nearer to each other should\r\n    the trees be planted, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\n    When this operation is over, should the holes be intended for\r\n    cinnamon roots, or stumps, the latter must be carefully removed with\r\n    as much earth as can be carried up with them and placed in the\r\n    holes, taking care not to return the earth removed originally in\r\n    digging the holes, which are to be filled with the soil scraped from\r\n    the surface, which has been previously burnt, exposed, and formed\r\n    into manure. Should no rain have fallen after the placing of the\r\n    roots in the holes, the stumps should be well covered, and watered\r\n    morning and evening, until such time as the sprouts shoot out fresh\r\n    buds, which will be in a fortnight or so from the time they were\r\n    transplanted, when the watering may be discontinued. In a month the\r\n    new shoots will be three or four inches high; this much depends upon\r\n    the weather.\r\n\r\n    If the holes be intended for young plants or seedlings, the plants\r\n    must be removed with boles of earth from the nurseries, and placed\r\n    in the holes, taking the same care as with the stumps, both in\r\n    watering and covering, in the event of its being dry weather. When\r\n    the seedlings take root, the coverings should not be removed until\r\n    the plants throw out a new pair of leaves from the buds, which is a\r\n    sign of their having taken root.\r\n\r\n    When a plantation is formed of old stumps, all the branches should\r\n    be cut down within six inches from the ground; this should be done\r\n    with one stroke of a sharp instrument, in order to avoid the\r\n    splitting of the stem. From these stumps cinnamon may be cut and\r\n    peeled within eighteen months from the time of transplanting. Often\r\n    this is done after the lapse of twelve months from the time of\r\n    transplanting.\r\n\r\n    From seedlings one cannot expect to gather a crop before two or\r\n    three years from the time the plants were transplanted, when there\r\n    will be but one or a single tree, which, when cut down as already\r\n    shown, four or six inches to the ground, ought to be covered with\r\n    fresh earth gathered from the space between the rows, and formed in\r\n    a heap round the plant. The next crop will be three or four times as\r\n    much as the first, from the number of sprouts the stem will throw\r\n    out, and so on every year, the crop increasing according to the\r\n    number of sprouts each stem will throw out yearly from the cuttings.\r\n    In the course of seven or eight years, the space left between the\r\n    rows will only admit the peelers and others to go round the bushes,\r\n    weed, clear and remove cuttings, as the branches from each bush will\r\n    almost touch each other at their ends.\r\n\r\n    It is essentially necessary to take every care not to allow any\r\n    creepers or other weeds to grow, the former interfere with the\r\n    growth of the bushes by entangling, because it not only takes out so\r\n    much of the support feeding the cinnamon trees, but interferes with\r\n    the peelers during the cutting season, and prevents the branches\r\n    growing up straight with a free circulation of air. The plantation\r\n    ought to be kept clean and free from weeds; the cinnamon requires no\r\n    manuring, but when the plantation is weeding the bushes should be\r\n    covered with the surface soil and raising the ground round the bush\r\n    by making a heap of the earth, which answers well in lieu of manure.\r\n    This operation must be attended to as soon as the cinnamon sticks\r\n    are removed for peeling. The plantation requires weeding three or\r\n    four times a year during the first two or three years, then twice a\r\n    year will answer the purpose; as by that time the trees will form\r\n    into bushes and destroy the seeds of the weeds on the ground.\r\n\r\n    The forming of a nursery is necessary, for which a space of ground,\r\n    say an acre, should be selected in a rich bit of soil free from\r\n    stones. Clear the whole brushwood, only leaving the large trees for\r\n    shade, remove all stones, stumps, and roots, dig the place well six\r\n    or eight inches deep, then form into long beds of three or four feet\r\n    wide, put the seeds down nine or twelve inches apart, cover them\r\n    eight or twelve inches above the ground by a platform, and water\r\n    them every other day until the seeds grow up and give one pair of\r\n    leaves, then leave off watering (unless great dry weather prevail,\r\n    then it ought to be continued) but not uncover until the plants grow\r\n    up six or eight inches high, and can bear the sun; these seedlings\r\n    will be ready for transplanting after three months from the time\r\n    they were sown.\r\n\r\n    The forming of nurseries is done at the close of the year, before\r\n    December. When this is done first, the party commences clearing and\r\n    preparing the land during the dry season, which is from the\r\n    beginning of December up to the end of March following. April will\r\n    set in with heavy rain (it is generally so in Ceylon), and it will\r\n    continue wet weather till the end of August, very often till\r\n    September and October, and you have the benefit of four or five\r\n    months rain.\r\n\r\n    The cinnamon seeds are to be gathered when they are fully ripe, they\r\n    must be heaped up in a shady place, to have the outside red pulp\r\n    rotted, when it turns quite black, then have the seeds trampled or\r\n    otherwise freed from the decomposed pulp, without injuring the\r\n    seeds, and well washed in water (just as is done to cherry coffee,\r\n    before they are made into parchment in the whole shell). Finally,\r\n    have the seeds[48] well dried in the air without exposing them to\r\n    the sun, and then put them in on the ground prepared for their\r\n    reception. In washing the seeds, those that float on the surface\r\n    should be rejected.\r\n\r\n    There are five different sorts of cinnamon, viz.:--\r\n\r\n  1st is called Panny  Meers Carundoo.\r\n  2nd           Tittha   \"      \"\r\n  3rd           Kahatte  \"      \"\r\n  4th           Wallee   \"      \"\r\n  5th           Savell   \"      \"\r\n\r\n    Of these, the first kind is the best of all, the 2nd and 3rd,\r\n    although inferior, are peeled likewise, the 4th and 5th are\r\n    spurious.\r\n\r\n    The distinction in the cinnamon can be known both by taste, the\r\n    shape of the leaves on the tree, and an experienced \"Challya\" man\r\n    will judge the cinnamon by first sight.\r\n\r\n    The quality of the bark depends upon its situation in the branch,\r\n    that peeled from the middle of the bush or branch being the _most\r\n    superior_, and classed as 1st sort, that taken from the upper end is\r\n    the 2nd quality, while the bark removed from the base of the branch,\r\n    or the thickest end, is the inferior, and called the 3rd sort.\r\n\r\n    From the cinnamon bark refused in the sorting store of all kinds, in\r\n    separating the first, second and third qualities and in making bales\r\n    for exportation, the refuse is collected, and by a chemical process\r\n    cinnamon oil is extracted, which sells very high, with an export\r\n    duty of 3s. or l½ rupees on each ounce, exclusive of the British\r\n    duties payable in England for importation, which is at present one\r\n    shilling and three pence per pound.[49] Of the cinnamon roots\r\n    camphor is made, which sells well both in Ceylon and other parts of\r\n    the world.\r\n\r\nCinnamon, as a medicine, is a powerful stimulant, but it is not much\r\nused alone. It is generally united with other tonics and stimulants,\r\nbut its ordinary use is to mask the disagreeable odor and taste of\r\nother medicines. The oil of cinnamon is prepared by being grossly\r\npowdered and macerated in sea water for two days and two nights, and\r\nboth are put into the still. A light oil comes over with the water,\r\nand floats on its surface; a heavy oil sinks to the bottom of the\r\nreceiver, four hours before the light oil separates from the water,\r\nand whilst the heavy oil continues to be precipitated for ten,\r\ntwelve, or sometimes fourteen days. The heavy oil, which separates\r\nfirst, is about the same color as the light oil, but sometimes the\r\nportion which separates last has a browner shade than the supernatant\r\noil. The same water can be used advantageously in a second\r\ndistillation. Professor Duncan informs us that 80 lbs. of\r\nnewly-prepared cinnamon yield about 2½ ozs. of oil, which floats upon\r\nthe water, and 5½ of heavy oil. The same quantity of cinnamon, if kept\r\nin store for many years, yields 2 ozs. of light oil and 5 ozs. of\r\nheavy oil.\r\n\r\nCinnamon oil is obtained from the fragments of bark which remain after\r\npeeling, sorting, and packing. It is distilled over with difficulty,\r\nand the process is promoted by the addition of salt water, and the use\r\nof a low still. The oil thus obtained by distillation is at first of a\r\nyellow color, but soon assumes a reddish brown hue. It has an odor\r\nintermediate between that of cinnamon and vanilla, but possesses in a\r\nhigh degree both the sweet burning taste and the agreeable aromatic\r\nsmell of cinnamon. It is heavier than water, its specific gravity\r\nbeing 1.035.\r\n\r\nThe ripe fruit of this tree yields a concrete oil called cinnamon\r\nsuet, which was formerly employed to make candles for the Kandian\r\nkings. An oil, called clove oil, is also distilled from the leaf,\r\nwhich is said to be equal in aromatic pungency to that made from the\r\nclove at the Moluccas.\r\n\r\nThe following were the quantities sold, and the average prices\r\nrealised during the Dutch rule in Ceylon:--\r\n\r\n                               s.  d.\r\n  1690    3,750  bales sold at  4   8  all round.\r\n  1709    3,750        \"        4   6      \"\r\n  1710    3,500        \"        4   4      \"\r\n  1720    5,000        \"        4   4      \"\r\n  1740    4,000        \"        9   3      \"\r\n  1760    5,000        \"        8   5      \"\r\n  1780    2,500        \"       12   6      \"\r\n  1784    2,500        \"       17   4      \"\r\n\r\nThe last quotation appears to have been the highest ever obtained for\r\ncinnamon, for 17s. 8d. average would give about 22s. for the first\r\nsort.

This duty was first imposed in 1832, on the\r\nabolition of the Grovernment monopoly, and was then fixed at the rate\r\nof 3s. per lb. on all qualities. From the 19th April, 1835, it was\r\nfixed at 3s. per lb. on the best, and 2s. on the second quality. It\r\nwas reduced in January, 1837, to 2s. 6d. on the first and second\r\nsorts, and 2s. on the third; and in June, 1841, to 2s. on all\r\nqualities; in 1843, to 1s.; and in September, 1848, to 4d. per lb.\r\nSuch a rate of export duty could be maintained only on an article for\r\nwhich there was a considerable demand, and which could not be supplied\r\nfrom other places, and this was for a long time the case. The\r\ncircumstances are now different, and the abolition of the duty, which\r\nhas so repeatedly been brought under the notice of the Treasury, has\r\nat length been determined on. The quantity of cinnamon, &c., taken for\r\nconsumption in the United Kingdom, scarcely amounts to 2,800 bales per\r\nannum. The sale and consumption is nearly stationary, and cinnamon is\r\nonly in demand for those finer purposes for which cassia, its\r\ncompetitor, cannot be used. Whilst we imported the large amount of\r\n700,095 lbs. in 1850, only 28,347 lbs. went into consumption. The\r\nconsumption has declined in the last two years to about 21,500 lbs.\r\nCinnamon is now imported into the United Kingdom duty free.\r\n\r\nThe land under cultivation with cinnamon in Ceylon is about 13,000\r\nacres, principally in the western and southern provinces. The number\r\nof gardens being eleven at Kaderane, seven at Ekelli, seven at\r\nMorotto, six at Marandham, and two at Willisene. Several enterprising\r\nplanters have recently commenced the cultivation of this spice at\r\nSingapore and Malacca. The plants already promise well. Indeed there\r\ncan be little doubt of its thriving, as the tree has been long grown\r\nin gardens and pleasure grounds in those settlements, as an ornamental\r\nplant, and has always flourished.\r\n\r\nThe Ceylon article is being supplanted in the continental markets by a\r\ncheaper one, of China and Malabar growth. The Javanese, tempted by the\r\nfatally high prices caused by the excessive duties on our Colonial\r\nspice, smuggled a quantity of seed, and with it a cinnamon cultivator,\r\nout of the island, and have since paid considerable attention to its\r\ngrowth. The Dutch have at present more than five millions of plants,\r\nequal to upwards of 5,000 acres, the greater part of which are in\r\ntolerably full bearing.\r\n\r\nThe cinnamon trees in Java begin to blossom in the month of March.\r\nThey do not all flower at the same time, but in succession. The fruit\r\nbegins to ripen in October in the same manner, so that the crop lasts\r\nfrom October to February. In Ceylon the blossom begins to appear in\r\nNovember. The seeds when plucked ought to be fully ripe, and after\r\nbeing separated from the outer pulpy covering, should be dried in the\r\nshade. They can be kept for two or three months in dry sand or ashes,\r\nbut must not be exposed to the sun, as they would split, and thus be\r\nrendered useless.\r\n\r\nThe plants in nurseries must be well sheltered from the sun and heavy\r\nrains, but the plants are strengthened by the covers being removed at\r\nnight when heavy rains are not expected to fall, and in the day time\r\nwhen only light rains prevail. The mode of planting out, cultivation,\r\npreparing the bark, &c., appears to be the same in Java as that\r\npractised in Ceylon. The only difference is, that while in Ceylon the\r\ncinnamon, when ready for market, is packed in \"gunny\" or canvass bags,\r\nin Java it is put into boxes, made of wood free from any smell or\r\nflavor which would injure the spice. The inferior cinnamon, however,\r\nis packed in straw mats.\r\n\r\nThe following is a return of the extent of cinnamon culture in Java\r\n:--\r\n\r\n                                                  In 1840.

It\r\ndiffers from the true cinnamon tree in many particulars. Its leaves\r\nare oblong-lanceolate; they have three ribs, which coalesce into one\r\nat the base; its young twigs are downy, and its leaves have the taste\r\nof cinnamon.\r\n\r\nMalabar cassia appears to be the produce of another species of\r\n_Cinnamonum_, probably _C. eucalyptoides_, or _Malabatrum_.\r\n\r\nDr. Wight, of the Madras Medical Service, in a report to the East\r\nIndia Company, expresses his belief that the cassia producing plants\r\nextend to nearly every species of the genus. \"A set of specimens (he\r\nobserves) submitted for my examination, of the trees furnishing cassia\r\non the Malabar coast, presented no fewer than four distinct species;\r\nincluding among them the genuine cinnamon plant, the bark of the older\r\ntrees of which, it would appear, are exported from the coast as\r\ncassia. Three or four more species are natives of Ceylon, exclusive of\r\nthe cinnamon proper, all of which greatly resemble the cinnamon plant,\r\nand in the woods might easily be mistaken for it and peeled, though\r\nthe produce would be inferior. Thus we have from Western India and\r\nCeylon alone, probably not less than six plants producing cassia; add\r\nto these nearly twice as many more species of _Cinnamonum_, the\r\nproduce of the more eastern states of Asia, and the Islands of the\r\nEastern Archipelago, all remarkable for their striking family\r\nlikeness; all, I believe, endowed with aromatic properties, and\r\nprobably the greater part, if not the whole, contributing something\r\ntowards the general result, and we at once see the impossibility of\r\nawarding to any one individual species the credit of being the source\r\nwhence the _Cassia lignea_ of commerce is derived; and equally the\r\nimpropriety of applying to any one of them the comprehensive specific\r\nappellation of cassia, since all sorts of cinnamon-like plants,\r\nyielding bark of a quality unfit to bear the designation of cinnamon\r\nin the market, are passed off as cassia.\"\r\n\r\nThe cassia tree, according to Mr. Crawfurd, is found in the more\r\nnorthern portion of the Indian isles, as in the Philippines,\r\nMajindanao, Sumatra, Borneo, and parts of Celebes. It is also grown on\r\nthe western coast of Africa. The principal seat of its culture is,\r\nhowever, the Malabar coast, and the provinces of Quantong and Kingse,\r\nin China.\r\n\r\nThe famous cassia of China is incomparably superior in perfume and\r\nflavor to any spice of its class. Its native place is unknown, though\r\nsupposed to be the interior provinces of China. The market price is\r\nsaid to be £5 per lb.\r\n\r\nThe Malabar sort brought from Bombay is thicker, darker colored, and\r\ncoarser than that from China, and is more subject to foul packing. A\r\nsmall quantity of cassia is brought from Mauritius and Brazil, and a\r\nlarge amount from the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\nCassia bark fetches from 80s. to 105s. per cwt. in the London market,\r\naccording to quality. The imports appear on the decline. In 1843 and\r\n1844 we imported nearly two millions of pounds. The quantity imported\r\nand retained for home consumption in the past four years are shown in\r\nthe following figures:--\r\n\r\n             Imported.      Retained for consumption.\r\n               lbs.                   lbs.\r\n  1848       510,247                76,152\r\n  1849       472,693                83,500\r\n  1850     1,050,008                97,178\r\n  1851       267,582                82,467\r\n\r\nThe cheaper Indian barks, as well as the cinnamon of the East, seemed\r\nat one time to be fast driving out of the market the superior class\r\ncinnamon of Ceylon.\r\n\r\nIn 1841 Java exported 400 cwts. of cinnamon; and the quantity of\r\ncassia imported into the United Kingdom from India and the Philippine\r\nIslands, in the five years ending with 1844, was--\r\n\r\n                lbs.\r\n  1840        329,310\r\n  1841      1,261,648\r\n  1842      1,312,804\r\n  1843      2,470,502\r\n  1844      1,278,413\r\n\r\n40,000 lbs. were received from India in 1848; and 3,795 arrobas of\r\ncassia were exported from Manila in 1847. In 1852, 2,806 cwts. of\r\ncassia were received at Singapore from China, and 1,380 cwts. exported\r\nfrom that settlement to the Continent, against 903 cwts. shipped in\r\nthe previous year.\r\n\r\nWhat the Ceylon spice-grower wants, is an extended field of\r\noperation--a larger class of consumers to take off his cinnamon, and\r\nthis can only be obtained by bringing it within the means of the great\r\nmass of cassia buyers.\r\n\r\nLook at the quantity of cinnamon exported by the Dutch in the middle\r\nof the eighteenth century. Eight or nine thousand bales a year were\r\nexported, and now, after a lapse of a hundred years, Ceylon hardly\r\nsends away half that quantity. Yet the consumption of spice must have\r\nkept pace with the increased population of countries using it, and so\r\nit has. But the difference is made up, and more than made up, by\r\ncassia from China, Java, Sumatra, Malabar Coast, &c., and though the\r\nnew article is not equal to the cinnamon of Ceylon, yet the vast\r\ndifference in the price obtains for it the preference. Now what the\r\nCeylon planter wants, is to be allowed to produce a spice on equal\r\nterms, and of a superior quality to cassia, which might be done under\r\nan _ad valorem_ export duty of 5 per cent. Spice of this description\r\nof course could not afford the high cultivation bestowed on the fine\r\nqualities, neither would it be required. In fact little or no\r\ncultivation need be given it. At present anything inferior to the\r\nthird sort is not worth producing, because it cannot stand the\r\nshilling export duty. But under a more enlightened system of things,\r\nwith a low duty such as I suggest, myriads of bushes would spring up\r\non those low, sandy, and at present unprofitable wastes that skirt the\r\nsea-coast of the western province, around Negombo and Chilaw.\r\n\r\nThe difference of duty would be more than made up by the diffusion of\r\ncapital in planting, the employment of vast numbers of laborers, the\r\npurchase from Government of many thousand acres of now valueless\r\nflats, and all the attendant benefits arising out of the development\r\nof a new field of operation for the colonial industrial resources.[50]\r\nThe cassia tree grows naturally to the height of 50 or 60 feet, with\r\nlarge, spreading, horizontal branches. The peelers take off the two\r\nbarks together, and separating the rough outer one, which is of no\r\nvalue, they lay the inner bark to dry, which rolls up and becomes the\r\n_Cassia lignea_ of commerce. It resembles cinnamon in taste, smell and\r\nappearance. The best is imported from China, either direct from\r\nCanton, or through Singapore, in small tubes or quills, sometimes the\r\nthickness of the ordinary pipes of cinnamon and of the same length;\r\nbut usually they are shorter and thicker, and the bark itself coarser.\r\nIt is of a tolerably smooth surface and brownish color, with some cast\r\nof red, but much less so than cinnamon. The exports from China are\r\nsaid to be about five million pounds annually; price about 32s. per\r\ncwt. In 1850, 6,509 piculs of cassia lignea (nearly one million\r\npounds), valued at 87,850 dollars, were shipped from the single port\r\nof Canton. Cassia bark is of a less fibrous texture, and more brittle,\r\nand it is also distinguished from cinnamon by a want of pungency, and\r\nby being of a mucilaginous or gelatinous quality.\r\n\r\nCASSIA BUDS are the dried flower buds (perianth and ovary) of the\r\ncassia tree, and are mostly brought from China. They bear some\r\nresemblance to a clove, but are smaller, and when fresh have a rich\r\ncinnamon flavor. They should be chosen round, fresh, and free from\r\nstalk and dirt. They are used chiefly in confectionery, and have the\r\nflavor and pungency of cassia. The exports from Canton in 1844 were\r\n21,500 lbs.; in 1850, 44,140 lbs., valued at 7,400 dollars. The\r\naverage quantity of cassia buds imported into the United Kingdom, in\r\neach of the thirteen years ending with 1842, was 40,231 lbs.; the\r\naverage quantity entered for home consumption in these years was 6,610\r\nlbs., and the average annual amount of duty received was £312.\r\n\r\nCassia bark yields a yellow volatile oil, called oil of cassia, the\r\nfiner kind of which differs but little in its properties from that of\r\ncinnamon, for which it is generally substituted; it has a specific\r\ngravity of 1071. The best is manufactured in China, where the wood,\r\nbark, leaves and oil are all in request. The cassia oil is rated at\r\n150 dollars per picul, and the trade in this article reaches about\r\n250,000 dollars.\r\n\r\nCANELLA ALBA, or wild cinnamon, is a valuable and ornamental tree,\r\ngrowing about fifteen feet high, which is cultivated in South America\r\nand the West Indies for its pungent bark, which is shipped to this\r\ncountry in bales or cases, in long quills and flat pieces, something\r\nlike cinnamon. Large old cuttings root readily in the sand. It is\r\ngrown chiefly in the Bahama Islands, from whence we derive our\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\nBy the Caribs, the ancient natives of the West Indies, and the\r\nnegroes, it was first employed as a condiment. In this country it is\r\nchiefly used as an aromatic stimulant and tonic, ranking between\r\ncinnamon and cloves. The bark possesses, however, no other quality\r\nthan its hot spicy flavor and strong aromatic odor when exposed to the\r\naction of heat.\r\n\r\nCASCARILLA BARK is obtained chiefly from the _Croton cascarilla_, a\r\nsmall shrub growing at St. Domingo, the Bahama Islands, and the\r\nAntilles. The chief portion comes from Eleuthera. In Hayti a pleasant\r\nkind of tea is made from the leaves. Other species of the family\r\nsupply some of the bark of commerce.\r\n\r\nFrom its strong and aromatic properties it has been found very\r\nefficacious in all febrile diseases, and vies with the Jesuits' bark;\r\nas a tonic it has very wholesome qualities, a pleasant and strong\r\nbitterness, and was for some time held in considerable repute among\r\nthe faculty.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty years ago, large shipments were made from the Bahamas.\r\nIt was found, upon adulteration with hops, to reduce the cost of that\r\narticle, and for the encouragement of the hop grower a prohibitory\r\nimpost was laid upon it by the Home Government, consequently it became\r\nan unsaleable product.\r\n\r\nThe sea-side balsam, or sweet wood (_Croton Eleuteria_), from which\r\nsome cascarilla bark is obtained, grows in the Bahama Islands and\r\nJamaica, but almost all the bark imported comes from Nassau, New\r\nProvidence. In 1840, 15,000 lbs. were imported for home consumption.\r\n\r\nThis bark produces the combined effect of an aromatic and of a\r\nmoderately powerful tonic; but it does not possess any astringency. It\r\nhas been employed as a substitute for cinchona. When burned it gives\r\nout a musky odor, and is often used in pastiles.\r\n\r\nThe value of this bark ranges, according to quality, from 17s. 6d. to\r\n43 s. per cwt.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOVES.\r\n\r\nThe cloves of commerce are obtained from the flower buds of\r\n_Caryophyllus aromaticus (Eugenia caryophyllata_), which was\r\noriginally a native of the Moluccas, but is now cultivated in several\r\nparts of the East and West Indies. They have the form of a nail, and\r\nwhen examined are seen to consist of the tubular calyx with a roundish\r\nprojection, formed by the unopened petals. It is a very handsome tree,\r\ngrowing to the height of about twenty feet. The trunk is straight, and\r\nrises four or five feet before it throws out branches. The bark is\r\nsmooth, thin, of a grey color, and the wood of the trunk too hard for\r\nordinary cabinet work.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are opposite, smooth, narrow, pointed, of a rupous color\r\nabove, and green on the under side. They have a very aromatic odor\r\nwhen bruised between the fingers. The flowers produced in branched\r\npeduncles, at the extremity of the bough, are of a delicate peach\r\ncolor. The elongated calyx, forming the seed vessel, first changes to\r\nyellow, and, when ripe, red, which is from October to December, and in\r\nthis state it is fit to gather. If left for a few weeks longer on the\r\ntrees, they expand, and become what are termed \"mother cloves,\" fit\r\nonly for seed or for candying. The ground under the tree is first\r\nswept clean, or else a mat or cloth is spread. The nearest clusters\r\nare taken off with the hand, and the more distant by the aid of\r\ncrooked sticks. Great care should be taken not to injure the tree, as\r\nit would prevent future bearing.\r\n\r\nThe cloves are then prepared for shipment by smoking them on hurdles\r\nnear a slow wood fire, to give them a brown color, after which they\r\nare further dried in the sun. They may then be cut off from the flower\r\nbranches with the nails, and will be found to be purple colored\r\nwithin, and fit to be baled for the European market. In some places\r\nthey are scalded in hot water before being smoked, but this is not\r\ncommon. The tree may be propagated either from layers or seed. Layers\r\nwill root in five or six months if kept moist.\r\n\r\nA strong dark loam, a gravelly, sandy, or clayey soil, but one not\r\nretentive of moisture, seems that best suited for its successful\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nIt does not thrive well near the sea, nor in the higher mountains, the\r\nspray of the sea and the cold being found injurious. The plants at\r\nfirst require the shade of other trees, such as the mango, coco-nut,\r\n&c. Although generally a hardy plant, it suffers from excessive\r\ndrought. They should be planted about twenty feet apart. In its native\r\ncountry the tree begins to yield fruit in the sixth year, but a crop\r\ncan seldom be looked for in other quarters under eight years. It is\r\nvery long lived, sometimes attaining the age of 130 years.\r\n\r\nThere appears, according to Mr. Crawfurd, to be five varieties of the\r\nclove, viz.--the ordinary cultivated clove; a kind called the female\r\nclove by the natives, which has a pale stem; the kiri or loory clove;\r\nthe royal clove, which is very scarce, and the wild clove. The three\r\nfirst are equally valuable as spices, the female clove being\r\nconsidered fittest for the distillation of essential oil. The wild\r\nclove, having scarcely any aromatic flavor, is valueless.\r\n\r\nThe produce which may be expected from the tree seems to be uncertain;\r\nit may, however, be averaged at five or six pounds. A clove tree, well\r\nweeded and taken care of, will produce from five to twenty pounds. On\r\nthe other hand, a tree that is neglected will not give above two or\r\nthree pounds. At intervals of from three to six years they usually\r\nproduce one extraordinary crop, but then a year now and then\r\nintervenes, when they yield none at all; in others they will afford a\r\ndouble harvest.\r\n\r\nThe clove tree was originally confined to the five principal Molucca\r\nislands, and chiefly to Machean. From these it was conveyed to\r\nAmboyna, a very short time only before the arrival of the Portuguese.\r\nBy them the cultivation was strictly restricted to Amboyna, every\r\neffort being made to extirpate the plant elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIt has now, however, spread to Java, Singapore, and the Straits'\r\nSettlements, Ceylon, the Mauritius and Seychelles, Bourbon, Zanzibar,\r\nCayenne, Dominica, Martinique, St. Kitts, St. Vincent, and Trinidad.\r\n\r\nCloves contain a volatile oil, associated with resinous, gummy, and\r\nastringent matter, which is yielded in larger proportion than by any\r\nother plant. Neuman obtained by distillation two ounces and two\r\ndrachms from sixteen ounces of cloves. On an average cloves yield from\r\n17 to 22 per cent. of oil, including the heavy and light oils. The oil\r\nis aromatic and acrid, and has been used as a condiment and a\r\nstimulant carminative. It is also extensively used by distillers and\r\nsoap makers.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the clove does not thrive well on the soil of Java,\r\nthe plantations of which trial had been made not having succeeded to\r\nthe extent expected, although they were directed by skilled persons\r\nfrom Amboyna; the places they made choice of did not differ materially\r\nas to soil and climate from those of the Moluccas.\r\n\r\nM. Teysman, Director of the Botanical Gardens at Batavia, seems to\r\nhave bestowed much attention on the subject. The exports however from\r\nthe island have been considerable. In 1830, there were 803 piculs\r\nshipped; in 1835, 4,566; in 1839, 2,334; in 1843, 2,027 piculs of 133\r\nlbs.\r\n\r\nM. Buee, who introduced the culture of the clove in the island of\r\nDominica, about 1789, thus describes the results of his experience,\r\nwhich may be useful to other experimental cultivators. He obtained a\r\nfew plants from Cayenne, and raised 1,600 trees from seed, which, in a\r\nyear from the first sowing, were transplanted. The seeds were sown at\r\nabout six inches apart from each other, in beds; over these beds small\r\nframes were erected about three feet from the ground, and plantain\r\nleaves were spread on the top, in order to shelter the young plants\r\nfrom the sun. The leaves were allowed gradually to decay, and at the\r\nend of nine months the young plants, which by that time were strong,\r\nwere permitted to receive the benefit of the sun; but if not protected\r\nfrom it when very young, they were found to droop and die.\r\n\r\nWhen transplanted, the trees were placed at sixteen feet apart from\r\neach other. They grew very luxuriantly, and at the end of fifteen\r\nmonths after their removal, attained the height of from three to four\r\nfeet. The ground wherein they were planted had been a coffee\r\nplantation during forty years. The coffee trees had decayed, and an\r\nattempt had been made to replace them; but they refused to grow;\r\nwhereas the clove plants flourished as if on congenial soil, and a\r\ncrop was gathered on some of them when they were not more than six\r\nyears old, which period is two or three years earlier than the usual\r\ntime for gathering.\r\n\r\nThe cloves sent from St. Vincent to England in 1800, were obtained\r\nfrom trees eight feet high, having a stem only two inches in diameter.\r\nTrial was made in that island of the relative growth of the plant on\r\ndifferent soils; it grew sickly on land which was not manured, but on\r\nland which had received this preparation it flourished.\r\n\r\nIn Singapore, about ten years ago, there were then about 15,000 clove\r\ntrees planted out, a few of which only had come in bearing. If these\r\nplantations had proved equally productive with those of the sister\r\nsettlement of Pinang, it would have been able to export 60,000 lbs. of\r\ncloves, its own produce; but this expectation, it will be seen, has\r\nnot been realised. In the season of 1841-42, there was 1000 piculs of\r\ncloves shipped from Pinang, but none were exported in the two previous\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of land under cultivation with cloves there, in 1843, was\r\n463 orlongs in Prince of Wales Island, and 517 in Province Wellesley.\r\nThe number of trees planted out in the former island was 72,779; in\r\nthe latter province 7,639. There were in the island 25,161 plants in\r\nnursery.\r\n\r\nThe trees in bearing were--In Prince of Wales Island, 28,739; not\r\nbearing, 44,040; produce in 1843, 87 piculs, 50 catties; gross value,\r\n3,399 dollars; estimated produce of cloves for 1844, 469 piculs. In\r\nProvince Wellesley--Trees in bearing, 1,073; not bearing, 6,566;\r\nproduce in 1843, 1 picul, 13 catties; gross value 45 dollars.\r\n\r\nThe export of cloves from Pinang was, in 1849, 24,000 lbs.; in 1850,\r\n52,400; in 1851, 27,866; in 1852, 45,087.\r\n\r\nFrom tabular statements drawn up in 1844, by Mr. F.S. Brown, Chairman\r\nof the Pinang Chamber of Commerce, it appears that there were, in\r\n1843, in that island and Province Wellesley adjoining, 96 clove\r\nplantations, containing 80,418 clove trees; besides many young trees\r\nin nurseries ready to be planted out. The produce of cloves there, in\r\n1842, was 11,813 lbs., and this was a very short crop, it having that\r\nyear proved a complete failure; the average crop for some years\r\nprevious had been 46,666 lbs. Pinang only began to export this spice\r\nin 1832. Of the clove trees in Pinang there were then only 29,812 in\r\nbearing, leaving 75,767 in that settlement alone to come to maturity;\r\nestimated to yield about 300,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nNo success has attended repeated trials of cloves in Singapore. Until\r\nthe trees reach the age of bearing, they grow and look extremely well;\r\nbut any expectation of a crop that may have been raised by their\r\nhitherto fine condition, ends in disappointment, for just then the\r\ntrees assume the appearance of sudden blight, as if\r\nlightning-stricken, and then die. 125 clove plants and 350 seedlings\r\nwere sent to Singapore from Bencoolen, by Sir T. Raffles, in the close\r\nof 1819; but although every care was paid them--while the nutmegs\r\nwhich accompanied them throve amazingly well--little or no progress\r\nhas been made with clove culture. Two or three hundred-weight were\r\nshipped in 1845, but since then hardly any mention is made of the\r\nspice.\r\n\r\nIn a petition presented by the spice planters of Pinang and Province\r\nWellesley, to the authorities at home, in 1844, praying that the duty\r\non British Colonial nutmegs, mace, and cloves might be reduced to 1s.\r\n9d., 1s. 3d., and 3d. respectively, on importation into England, in\r\norder to compete with foreign produce, it was stated that a few years\r\nhence Prince of Wales Island might be expected to produce 600,000 lbs.\r\nof nutmegs, 200,000 lbs. of mace, and 300,000 lbs. of cloves; whilst\r\nSingapore, if equally successful in the culture of the same, would\r\nyield yearly 137,000 lbs. of nutmegs, 45,000 lbs. of mace, and 60,000\r\nlbs. of cloves. In short, the planters needed only encouragement to\r\nproduce in the course of a few years a full supply of those valuable\r\nspices for the whole consumption of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nDr. Ruschenberger, who visited Zanzibar in 1835, thus speaks of the\r\nclove plantations there:--\"As far as the eye could reach over a\r\nbeautifully undulated land, nothing was to be seen but clove trees of\r\ndifferent ages, varying in height from five to twenty feet. The form\r\nof the tree is conical, the branches grow at nearly right angles with\r\nthe trunk, and they begin to shoot a few inches above the ground. The\r\nplantation contains nearly four thousand trees, and each tree yields\r\non an average six pounds of cloves a year; they are carefully picked\r\nby hand, and then dried in the shade; we saw numbers of slaves\r\nstanding on ladders gathering the spice, while others were at work\r\nclearing the ground of dead leaves. The whole is in the finest order,\r\npresenting a picture of industry and of admirable neatness and beauty.\r\nThey were introduced into Zanzibar in 1818, from Mauritius, and are\r\nfound to thrive so well that almost everybody in the island is now\r\nclearing away the cocoa nut to make way for them. The clove bears in\r\nfive or six years from the seed; of course time enough has not yet\r\nelapsed for the value and quantity of Zanzibar cloves to be generally\r\nknown; they are worth, however, in the Bombay market, about 30s. the\r\nSurat maund of 39¼ lbs.; the price for Molucca cloves in the Eastern\r\nmarket is from 28 to 30 dollars per picul of 133 lbs.; for those of\r\nMauritius, 20 to 24 dollars per picul.\"\r\n\r\nThe average annual consumption of cloves in the United Kingdom, in the\r\nfour years ending 1841, was 49,000 lbs. The largest quantity of cloves\r\nimported during the past twenty-five years was 1,041,171 lbs., in\r\n1847. The quantities imported and entered for home consumption in the\r\nlast five years have been as follows:--\r\n\r\n                 Imports.       Home consumption.\r\n                   lbs.               lbs.\r\n  1848           117,433             126,691\r\n  1849           274,713             133,713\r\n  1850           749,646             159,934\r\n  1851           253,439             138,132\r\n  1852           313,949             175,287\r\n\r\nIn 1848 we received 60,000 lbs. of cloves from British India.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NUTMEG.\r\n\r\n_Myristica moschata_, _M. officinalis_, or _aromatica_.--This tree is\r\nof a larger growth than the clove, attaining a height of thirty feet,\r\nand has its leaves broader in proportion to their length; the upper\r\nsurface of these is of a bright green, the under of a greyish color.\r\nIt is a dioecious plant, having male or barren pale yellow flowers upon\r\none tree, and female or fertile flowers upon another. The fruit is\r\ndrupaceous, and opens by two valves when ripe, displaying the\r\nbeautiful reticulated scarlet arillus, which constitutes mace. Within\r\nthis is a hard, dark brown, and glossy shell, covering the kernel,\r\nwhich is the nutmeg of the shops.\r\n\r\nThe kernels of _M. tomentosa_ are also used as aromatics, under the\r\nname of wild or male nutmegs.\r\n\r\nLindley describes two other species, _M. fatua_, a native of Surinam,\r\nwith greenish white flowers, and _M. sebifera_ or _Virola sebifera_, a\r\nnative of Guiana, with yellowish green flowers.\r\n\r\nBy expression, nutmegs are made to yield a concrete oil, called\r\n_Adeps Myristicæ_, or sometimes erroneously oil of mace. A volatile\r\noil is also procured by distillation. Nutmegs and mace are used\r\nmedicinally as aromatic stimulants and condiments. In large doses they\r\nhave a narcotic effect. The fleshy part of the fruit is used as a\r\npreserve.\r\n\r\nDr. Oxley has given such an admirable account of the nutmeg and its\r\ncultivation, as the result of 20 years experience in Singapore, that I\r\nshall draw largely from his valuable paper, which is contained in the\r\nsecond volume of \"The Journal of the Indian Archipelago,\" page 641.\r\n\r\nThe nutmeg tree, like many of its class, has a strong tendency to\r\nbecome monoecious, and planters in general are well pleased at this\r\nhabit, thinking they secure a double advantage by having the male and\r\nfemale flowers on the same plant. This is, however, delusive, and\r\nbeing against the order of nature, the produce of such trees is\r\ninvariably inferior, showing itself in the production of double nuts\r\nand other deformities. It is best, therefore, to have only female\r\ntrees, with a due proportion of males.\r\n\r\nThe female flowers, which are merely composed of a tripid calyx and no\r\ncorolla, when produced by a tree in full vigor are perfectly\r\nurceolate, slightly tinged with green at the base, and well filled by\r\nthe ovary, whereas the female flowers of weakly trees are entirely\r\nyellow, imperfectly urceolate, and approach more to the staminiferous\r\nflowers of the male.\r\n\r\nThe shape of the fruit varies considerably, being spherical, oblong,\r\nand egg-shaped, but the nearer they approach sphericity of figure, the\r\nmore highly are they prized.\r\n\r\nThere is also a great variety in the foliage of different trees, from\r\nelliptic, oblong and ovate, to almost purely lanceolate-shaped leaves.\r\nThis difference seems to indicate in some measure the character of the\r\nproduce; trees with large oblong leaves appearing to have the largest\r\nand most spherical fruit, and those with small lanceolate leaves being\r\nin general more prolific bearers, but of inferior quality.\r\n\r\nWhilst its congener the clove has been spread over Asia, Africa, and\r\nthe West Indies, the nutmeg refuses to flourish out of the Malayan\r\nArchipelago, except as an exotic, all attempts to introduce it largely\r\ninto other tropical countries having decidedly failed. The island of\r\nTernate, which is in about the same latitude as Singapore, is said to\r\nhave been the spot where it was truly indigenous, but no doubt the\r\ntree is to be found on most of the Moluccas. At present the place of\r\nits origin is unproductive of the spice, having been robbed of its\r\nrich heritage by the policy of the Dutch, who at an early period\r\nremoved the plantations to the Banda isles for better surveillance,\r\nwhere they still remain and flourish. But although care was formerly\r\ntaken to extirpate the tree on the Moluccas, the mace-feeding pigeons\r\nhave frustrated the machinations of man, and spread it widely through\r\nthe Archipelago of islands extending from the Moluccas to New Guinea.\r\nIts circle of growth extends westward as far as Pinang, or Prince of\r\nWales Island, where, although an exotic, it has been cultivated as a\r\nmercantile speculation with success for many years. Westward of Pinang\r\nthere are no plantations, looking at the subject in a mercantile point\r\nof view. The tree is to be found, indeed, in Ceylon, and the West\r\nCoast of India, but to grow it as a speculation out of its indigenous\r\nlimits, is as likely to prove successful as the cultivation of apples\r\nand pears in Bengal.\r\n\r\nIn the Banda Isles, where the tree may be considered as indigenous, no\r\nfurther attention is paid to its cultivation than setting out the\r\nplants in parks, under the shade of large forest trees, with long\r\nhorizontal branches, called \"Canari\" by the natives. There it attains\r\na height of 50 feet and upwards, whereas from 20 to 30 feet may be\r\ntaken as a fair average of the trees in the Straits' Settlements; but\r\nnotwitstanding our pigmy proportions (adds Dr. Oxley), it does not\r\nappear, from, all I could ever learn, that we are relatively behind\r\nthe Banda trees, either in quantity or quality of produce, and I am\r\nstrongly impressed with the idea that the island of Singapore can\r\ncompete with the Banda group on perfectly even terms. Our climate is\r\nquite unexceptionable for the growth of the nutmeg, being neither\r\nexposed to droughts or high winds; and although we may lose by\r\ncomparison of soils, we again gain by greater facilities of sending\r\nour products to market, by the facility of obtaining abundant supplies\r\nof manure, and any amount of free and cheap labor.\r\n\r\nA nutmeg plantation, well laid out and brought up to perfection, is\r\none of the most pleasing and agreeable properties that can be\r\npossessed. Yielding returns, more or less daily, throughout the year,\r\nthere is increasing interest, besides the usual stimulus to all\r\nagriculturists of a crop time, when his produce increases to double\r\nand quadruple the ordinary routine.\r\n\r\nTrees having arrived at fifteen years growth, there is no incertitude\r\nor fear of total failure of crop, only in relative amount of produce,\r\nand this, as will be seen, is greatly in the planter's own power to\r\ncommand. It is against reason to suppose that a tree in flower and\r\nfruit will not expend itself if left to unaided nature: it must be\r\nsupplied with suitable stimuli to make good the waste, therefore he\r\nwho wants nuts must not be sparing of manure.\r\n\r\nThe first requisite for the planter is choice of location. It is true\r\nthat the nutmeg tree, aided by manure, will grow in almost any soil\r\nwhere water does not lodge, but it makes a vast difference in the\r\ndegree of success, whether the soil be originally good, or poor and\r\nimproved by art. The tree does not thrive in white or sandy soils, but\r\nprefers the deep red and friable soils formed by the decomposition of\r\ngranite rocks and tinged with iron, and the deeper the tinge the\r\nbetter. I am therefore inclined to think, that iron in the soil is\r\nalmost necessary for the full development of the plant. If under the\r\nbefore-mentioned soil there be a rubble of iron-stone at four or five\r\nfeet from the surface (a very common formation in Singapore), forming\r\na natural drainage, the planter has obtained all that he can desire\r\nin the ground, and needs only patience and perseverance to secure\r\nsuccess. The form of the ground ought to be undulating, to permit the\r\nrunning off of all superfluous water, as there is no one thing more\r\ninjurious to the plant than water lodging around its roots, although,\r\nin order to thrive well, it requires an atmosphere of the most humid\r\nsort, and rain almost daily. Besides the form of the ground, situation\r\nis highly desirable, particularly as regards exposure. A spot selected\r\nfor a nutmeg plantation cannot be too well sheltered, as high winds\r\nare most destructive to the tree, independently of the loss occasioned\r\nby the blowing off of fruit and flower.\r\n\r\nAt present there is abundant choice of land in Singapore, the greater\r\nportion of the island being as yet uncultivated, and much answering to\r\nthe above description. The land can be purchased from Government at\r\nthe rate of from 10s. to 20s. per acre in perpetuity. I would advise\r\nthe man who wishes to establish a plantation, to select the virgin\r\nforest, and of all things let him avoid deserted gambier plantations,\r\nthe soil of which is completely exhausted, the Chinese taking good\r\ncare never to leave a spot until they have taken all they can out of\r\nit. A cleared spot has a great attraction for the inexperienced, and\r\nit is not easy to convince a man that it is less expensive to attack\r\nthe primitive forest, than to attempt to clear an old gambier\r\nplantation, overrun with lalang grass; but the cutting down and\r\nburning of large forest trees is far less expensive than the\r\nextirpation of the lalang, and as the Chinese leave all the stumps of\r\nthe large trees in the ground, it is almost more difficult to remove\r\nthem in this state than when you have the powerful lever of the trunk\r\nto aid you in tearing up the roots, setting aside the paramount\r\nadvantage that, in the one case you possess a fresh and fertile soil,\r\nin the other an effete and barren one.\r\n\r\nForest land, or \"jungle,\" as it is called in the East, can be cleared\r\nfor about 25 to 30 dollars (£5 to £6) per acre, by contract, but the\r\nplanter had better be careful to have every stump and root of tree\r\nremoved, ere he ventures to commence planting, or the white ants,\r\nattracted by the dead wood, will crowd into the land, and having\r\nconsumed the food thus prepared for them, will not be slow in\r\nattacking the young trees. Whilst the planter is thus clearing the\r\nground, he may advantageously at the same time be establishing\r\nnurseries; for these the ground ought to be well trenched and mixed\r\nwith a small quantity of thoroughly decomposed manure and burned\r\nearth, making up the earth afterwards into beds of about three feet\r\nwide, with paths between them for the convenience of weeding and\r\ncleaning the young plants. Of course if the planter can obtain really\r\ngood plants, the produce of well-selected seed, it will be a great\r\nsaving of time and expense to him, but unless the seed be carefully\r\nchosen, I would prefer beginning my own nurseries, and in the\r\nselection of seed would recommend the most perfectly ripe and\r\nspherical nuts. Oval long nuts are to be rejected, particularly any\r\nof a pale color at one end.\r\n\r\nThe planter having selected his seed, which ought to be put in the\r\nground within twenty-four hours after being gathered, setting it about\r\ntwo inches deep in the beds already prepared, and at the distance of\r\ntwelve to eighteen inches apart, the whole nursery to be well shaded\r\nboth on top and sides, the earth kept moist and clear of weeds, and\r\nwell smoked by burning wet grass or weeds in it once a week, to drive\r\naway a very small moth-like insect that is apt to infest young plants,\r\nlaying its eggs on the leaf, when they become covered with yellow\r\nspots, and perish if not attended to speedily.\r\n\r\nWashing the leaves with a decoction of the Tuba root is the best\r\nremedy I know of, but where only a few plants are affected, if the\r\nspots be numerous, I would prefer to pluck up the plant altogether,\r\nrather than run the risk of the insect becoming more numerous, to the\r\ntotal destruction of the nursery. The nuts germinate in from a month\r\nto six weeks, and even later, and for many months after germination\r\nthe seed is attached to the young plant, and may be removed apparently\r\nas sound as when planted, to the astonishment of the unlearned, who\r\nare not aware of the great disproportion in size between the ovule and\r\nalbumen, the former of which is alone necessary to form the plant. The\r\nplant may be kept in nursery with advantage for nearly two years.\r\nShould they grow rapidly, and the interspaces become too small for\r\nthem, every second plant had better be removed to a fresh nursery; and\r\nset out at a distance of a couple of feet from each other. When\r\ntransplanted, either in this way or for their ultimate position in the\r\nplantation, care should be taken to remove them with a good ball of\r\nearth, secured by the skin of the plantain, which prevents the ball of\r\nearth falling to pieces. The nurseries being established, the ground\r\ncleared and ready, the next proceeding is to lay out and dig holes\r\nabout 26 or 30 feet apart, and as the quincunx order has so many\r\nadvantages, it is the form I would recommend for adoption. The holes\r\nshould be at least six feet in diameter, and about four feet deep, and\r\nwhen refilled the surface soil is to be used, and not that which is\r\ntaken out of the hole. Each hole should be filled up about one foot\r\nhigher than the surrounding ground, to allow for the settling of the\r\nsoil and the sinking of the tree, which, planted at this height, will\r\nin a few years be found below the level. Over each hole thus filled\r\nup, a shed, made of Attap leaves or other shelter, closed on two\r\nsides, east and west, and proportioned to the size of the plant, is to\r\nbe erected. It is not a bad plan to leave an open space in the centre\r\nof the top of each shed, about twelve inches wide, by which the young\r\nplant can obtain the benefit of the dew and gentle rains, which more\r\nthan compensates for the few rays of sun that can only fall upon it\r\nwhilst that body is vertical. After the sheds have been completed,\r\neach hole should have added to it a couple of baskets of well\r\ndecomposed manure, and an equal quantity of burned earth, when all is\r\nready for the reception of the plant, which, having been set out, if\r\nthe weather be dry will require watering for ten days or a fortnight\r\nafter, in fact until it takes the soil.\r\n\r\nThe planter having set out all his trees must not deem his labors\r\ncompleted, they are only commencing. To arrive thus far is simple and\r\neasy, but to patiently watch and tend the trees for ten years after,\r\nrequires all the enthusiasm already mentioned. About three months\r\nafter planting out, the young trees will receive great benefit if a\r\nsmall quantity of liquid fish manure be given them. In the first six\r\nyears they ought to be trenched round three times, enlarging the\r\ncircle each time, the trenches being dug close to the extremities of\r\nthe roots, which generally correspond to the ends of the branches, and\r\neach new trench commencing where the old one terminated. They must of\r\ncourse greatly increase in size as the circle extends, requiring a\r\nproportionate quantity of manure, but the depth ought never to be less\r\nthan two feet.\r\n\r\nThe object of trenching is to loosen the soil and permit the roots to\r\nspread, otherwise the tree spindles instead of becoming broad and\r\numbrageous. Manure is beyond all other considerations the most\r\nimportant to the welfare of the estate; it is that which gives\r\nquantity and quality of produce, and without it a plantation cannot be\r\ncarried on. The want of it must limit the cultivation in the Straits'\r\nSettlements, and will arrest many a planter, who, having got his\r\nplantation to look well up to the eighth year with very little manure,\r\nthinks he can go on in the same manner. The nutmeg tree likes well all\r\nsorts of manures, but that which is best suited for it seems to be\r\nwell-rotted stable and cow-yard manure, mixed with vegetable matter,\r\nand when the tree is in bearing the outer covering of the nut itself\r\nis about one of the very best things to be thrown into the dung-pit.\r\nDead animals buried not too near the roots, also blood, fish, and oil\r\ncakes are beneficial. Guano is of no use.\r\n\r\nBut although manuring is the chief element in successful cultivation,\r\nthere are many other matters for the planter to attend to during the\r\nperiod that the trees are growing. All obnoxious grasses must be\r\ncarefully kept out of the plantation, at least from between the trees,\r\nand the harmless grasses rather encouraged, as they keep the surface\r\ncool. The trunk of the tree ought to be carefully washed with soap and\r\nwater once a year to keep it clear of moss; this has been ridiculed as\r\na work of supererogation, but let those who think so omit the\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nParasitical plants of the genus Loranthus are very apt to attach\r\nthemselves to the branches, and if not removed do great injury.\r\n\r\nThe insect enemies of the tree are not very numerous, but it has a\r\nfew, white ants among the number. They seldom attack a vigorous plant;\r\nit is upon the first symptoms of weakness or decay that they commence\r\ntheir operations. Their nests may be dislodged from the roots of the\r\nplant by a dose of solution of pig dung, to which they have a great\r\naversion.\r\n\r\nThere are several species of insects which lay their eggs on the\r\nleaves, and unless carefully watched and removed, they commit great\r\nhavoc amongst the trees. For this purpose it is necessary to wash the\r\nleaves with a decoction of Tuba root, and syringe them by means of a\r\nbamboo with lime and water, of the consistence of whitewash; this\r\nadheres to the leaves, and will remain even after several heavy\r\nshowers.\r\n\r\nAnother nuisance is the nest of the large red ant; these collect and\r\nglue the leaves together, forming a cavity for the deposition of their\r\n_larvæ_. The best mode of destroying them is to hang a portion of some\r\nanimal substance, such as the entrails of a fowl, fish, &c., to the\r\nend of a pole, thrust through and protruding from the branches; the\r\nants will run along the pole and collect in immense quantities around\r\nthe bait, when, by a lighted faggot, they can be burned by thousands.\r\nThis repeated once or twice a day for a week or so, will soon rid the\r\ntree of the invaders.\r\n\r\nThe number of men to be kept on an estate to preserve it in first-rate\r\norder after it has come into bearing, must depend of course upon the\r\nsize of the plantation, but in general one man for every one hundred\r\ntrees will be found sufficient, provided there be some four or five\r\nthousand trees. On a small scale the proportion must be greater.\r\n\r\nThe nutmeg planter is under the necessity of keeping up nurseries\r\nthroughout the whole of his operations for the replacement of bad\r\nplants and redundant males. Of the latter ten per cent. seems to be\r\nabout the best proportion to keep, but I would have completely\r\ndioecious trees. No person can boast to get a plantation completely\r\nfilled up and in perfect order much sooner than fifteen years. Of the\r\nfirst batch planted, not more than one-half will turn out perfect\r\nfemales, for I do not take into account monoecious trees, which I have\r\nalready condemned. The tree shows flower about the seventh year, but\r\nthe longer it is before doing so, the better and stronger will it be.\r\nI cannot refrain from a smile when a sanguine planter informs me with\r\nexultation that he has obtained a nut from a tree only three or four\r\nyears planted out; so much the worse for his chance of success, too\r\ngreat precocity being incompatible with strength and longevity.\r\n\r\nThe best trees do not show flower before the ninth year, and one such\r\nis worth a score of the others. This will be evident when it is stated\r\nthat I have seen several trees yield more than 10,000 nuts each in one\r\nyear, whereas I do not believe that there is a plantation in the\r\nStraits' that averages 1,000 from every tree. This very great\r\ndisparity of bearing shows plainly that the cultivation of the plant\r\nis not yet thoroughly understood, or greater uniformity would prevail,\r\nand I think it clearly enough points out that a higher degree of\r\ncultivation would meet its reward.\r\n\r\nThe tree has not been introduced into the Straits' sufficiently long\r\nto determine its longevity, but those introduced and planted in the\r\nbeginning of the present century, as yet show no symptoms of decay.\r\nThe experiment of grafting the trees, which at first view presents so\r\nmany advantages, both in securing the finest quality of nut and the\r\ncertainty of the sex, has still to be tried in this cultivation. Some\r\nthree years ago (continues Dr. Oxley), I succeeded in grafting several\r\nplants by approach; these are not sufficiently old for me to decide\r\nwhether it be desirable or not, for although the plants are looking\r\nwell and growing, they as yet have thrown out their branches in a\r\nstraggling irregular manner, having no leaders, and consequently they\r\ncannot extend their branches in the regular verticles necessary for\r\nthe perfect formation of the tree, without which they must ever be\r\nsmall and stunted, and consequently incapable of yielding any quantity\r\nof produce. The grafts have succeeded so far as stock and scion\r\nbecoming one, and in time a perpendicular shoot from the wood may\r\nappear. If after that it should increase in size and strength, so as\r\nto form a tree of full dimensions, the advantage gained would be worth\r\nany trouble, the quality of some nuts being so far above that of\r\nothers, it would make a difference beyond present calculation; in\r\nshort, 1,000 such picked trees at the present prices would yield\r\nsomething equivalent to £4,000 a year, for £4 per tree would be a low\r\nestimate for such plants. If this ever does occur, it will change the\r\naspect of cultivation altogether, and I see no good reason why it\r\nshould not, except that those possessing trees of the quality alluded\r\nto, would not very willingly permit others to graft from them, so it\r\nis only the already successful planter who can try the experiment\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\nAn acre of land contains on an average 92 trees, and it is calculated\r\nan outlay of 300 dollars is required upon every acre to bring the tree\r\nto maturity; but as not more than one-half of the trees generally turn\r\nout females, and as many others are destroyed by accident and diseases\r\nto which this plant is very liable, it makes the cost of each tree, by\r\nthe time it yields fruit, about eight dollars. The nutmeg tree begins\r\nto bear when about eight years old, but it gives no return for several\r\nyears longer; and therefore to the expense of cultivation must be\r\nadded the interest of the capital sunk. The plant being indigenous in\r\nthe Moluccas, the expense of cultivation there is greatly less, and\r\nthis consequently forms a strong ground of claim to the British\r\nplanter for protective duties to their spices from the British\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe planter having his tree arrived at the agreeable point of\r\nproducing, has but slight trouble in preparing his produce for market.\r\nAs the fruit is brought in by the gatherers, the mace is carefully\r\nremoved, pressed together and flattened on a board, exposed to the sun\r\nfor three or four days, it is then dry enough to be put by in the\r\nspice-house until required for exportation, when it is to be screwed\r\ninto boxes, and becomes the mace of commerce. The average proportion\r\nof mace yielded in Singapore is one pound for every 433 nuts.\r\n\r\nThe nutmeg itself requires more care in its curing, it being necessary\r\nto have it well and carefully dried ere the outer black shell be\r\nbroken. For this purpose the usual practice is to subject it for a\r\ncouple of months to the smoke of slow fires kept up underneath, whilst\r\nthe nuts are spread on a grating about eight or ten feet above. The\r\nmodel of a perfect drying-house is easily to be obtained. Care should\r\nbe taken not to dry the nuts by too great a heat, as they shrivel and\r\nlose their full and marketable appearance. It is therefore desirable\r\nto keep the nuts, when first collected, for eight or ten days out of\r\nthe drying-house, exposing them at first for an hour or so to the\r\nmorning sun, and increasing the exposure daily until they shake in the\r\nshell. The nuts ought never to be cracked until required for\r\nexportation, or they will be attacked and destroyed by a small\r\nweasel-like insect, the larvæ of which is deposited in the ovule, and,\r\nbecoming the perfect insect, eats its way out, leaving the nut bored\r\nthrough and through, and worth less as a marketable commodity. Liming\r\nthe nuts prevents this to a certain extent, but limed nuts are not\r\nthose best liked in the English market, whereas they are preferred in\r\nthat state in the United States. When the nuts are to be limed, it is\r\nsimply necessary to have them well rubbed over between the hands with\r\npowdered lime. By the Dutch mode of preparation, they are steeped in a\r\nmixture of lime and water for several weeks. This no doubt will\r\npreserve them, but it must also have a prejudicial effect on the\r\nflavor of the spice.\r\n\r\nAfter the nuts are thoroughly dried, which requires from six weeks to\r\ntwo months smoking, they cannot be too soon sent to market. But it is\r\notherwise with the mace; that commodity, when fresh, not being in\r\nesteem in the London market, seeing that they desire it of a golden\r\ncolor, which it only assumes after a few months, whereas at first when\r\nfresh it is blood red; now red blades are looked upon with suspicion,\r\nand are highly injurious to the sale of the article.\r\n\r\nThis is one of those peculiar prejudices of John Bull, which somewhat\r\nimpugns his wisdom; but it must be attended to, as John is very ready\r\nto pay for his caprice; therefore those who provide for him have no\r\nright to complain, although they may smile.\r\n\r\nThe nutmeg tree was sent from Bencoolen to Singapore, the latter end\r\nof 1819, so that thirty-four years have elapsed since its first\r\nintroduction. Sir Stamford Raffles shipped to the care of the resident\r\ncommandant, Major Farquhar, 100 nutmeg plants, 25 larger ditto, and\r\n1,000 nutmeg seeds, which were committed to the charge of Mr. Brooks,\r\na European gardener, who was specially engaged by the East India\r\nCompany to look after their embryo spice plantations here. Some of\r\nthese plants were set out in rather a bad soil and locality, but\r\nseveral of them are at present, and have been for the last ten years,\r\nfine fruitful trees. 315 of the trees in the Government garden\r\nyielded, in 1848, 190,426 nuts, or at the average of 604 for each\r\ntree; but of these not over 50 were of the old stock, most having been\r\nplanted since 1836; so that a planter may safely calculate on having a\r\nbetter average than is here set forth, provided he attends to his\r\ncultivation, and his trees are brought up to the age of fifteen\r\nyears. If a plantation be attended to from the commencement after the\r\nmanner I have endeavoured to explain, and the trees be in a good\r\nlocality, the planter will undoubtedly obtain an average of 10 lbs. of\r\nspice from each tree from the fifteenth year; this, at an average\r\nprice of 2s. 6d. per lb., is 25s. per annum. He can have about seventy\r\nsuch trees in an acre, so that there is scarcely any better or more\r\nremunerative cultivation when once established. But the race is a long\r\none, the chances of life, and a high rate of interest in the country,\r\nmake it one of no ordinary risk, and it is one that holds out no\r\nprospect of any return in less than ten years.\r\n\r\nA person commencing and stopping short of the bearing point, either by\r\ndeath or want of funds, will suffer almost total loss, for the value\r\nof such a property brought into a market where there are no buyers\r\nmust be purely nominal. Again, if the property has arrived at the\r\npaying point, almost any person of common honesty can take charge of\r\nand carry it on, for the trees after twelve years are remarkably\r\nhardy, and bear a deal of ill treatment and neglect; not that I would\r\nrecommend any person to try the experiment. But it is some consolation\r\nfor the proprietor to know that stupidity will not ruin him, and that\r\neven at the distance of thousands of miles he can give such\r\ndirections, as, if attended to, will keep his estate in a flourishing\r\nand fruitful state.\r\n\r\nThe total number of nutmeg trees in Singapore in 1848 was 55,925, of\r\nwhich 14,914 only were in bearing. The produce of that year was\r\n4,085,361 nutmegs, or 33,600 lbs. in weight. The greater number of the\r\ntrees, it will be perceived, have not come into full bearing, but the\r\nproduce is increasing rapidly, and in 1849 it amounted to fully 66,670\r\nlbs.\r\n\r\nAmong the principal growers in that island are Dr. Oxley, Mr. C.R.\r\nPrinsep, and Mr. W. Montgomerie, who have each large plantations, with\r\nfrom 2,000 to 5,000 bearing trees on them. Others, as Sir. J.\r\nd'Almeida, Mr. Nicol, and one or two more, have planted extensively,\r\nbut have not yet got their trees to the bearing point.\r\n\r\nA large supply of nutmeg and clove plants arrived at Pinang in 1802,\r\nfrom the Molucca Islands. There were 71,266 nutmeg and 55,264 clove\r\nplants; allowing one half of the former to have been male trees, there\r\nwould only have been 35,633 useful nutmeg plants. It is believed that\r\na mere fraction of these ever reached maturity, but they served to\r\nintroduce the cultivation permanently. Plants were likewise sent to\r\nCeylon and Cape Comorin. It does not appear that the climates of these\r\ntwo localities suit the nutmeg tree, as it requires rain, or at least\r\na very damp climate throughout the year. The East India Company's\r\nspice plantations in Pinang were sold in 1824, and the trees were\r\ndispersed over the island.\r\n\r\nThe spice cultivators of the Straits' Settlements have for some time\r\nsought a further protective duty on nutmegs, and the extension of a\r\nsimilar protection to mace and cloves, the produce of these\r\nsettlements; for singularly enough the present tariff affords no\r\nprotection to mace, the growth of British possessions. From tabular\r\nstatements, furnished by the Chamber of Commerce of Pinang, drawn up\r\napparently with great care, it appears that in 1843 there were 3,046\r\nacres cultivated with spice trees in Pinang and province Wellesley,\r\ncontaining 233,995 nutmegs, and 80,418 clove trees, besides 77,671\r\ntrees in nurseries ready to be planted out; and by a similar statement\r\nfrom Singapore, which is however not so complete, that 743 acres are\r\ncultivated, containing 43,544 nutmeg trees. The island of Pinang is\r\nestimated to contain 160 square miles, nearly the whole of which, with\r\nthe exception perhaps of summits of the hills, is well adapted to\r\nspice growing. Province Wellesley is of much greater extent, and the\r\nsoil of it has already been proved to be equally well fitted for that\r\nkind of cultivation; and the settlements of Malacca and Singapore are\r\nsaid to be admirably suited, in many places, for that species of\r\nproduce, the latter of which has already several plantations fast\r\napproaching to maturity.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation is capable of great extension; encouragement is only\r\nrequired to be held out, and new plantations will be rapidly formed in\r\nthese settlements. The same tables show that the produce in 1842 was,\r\nin Pinang and Province Wellesley, 18,560,281 nutmegs, 42,866 lbs. of\r\nmace, and 11,813 lbs. of cloves[51]; and in Singapore, 842,328\r\nnutmegs, and 1,962 lbs. of mace. Thus making the produce from the two\r\nsettlements 19,408,608 nutmegs in number (or in weight 147,034 lbs.),\r\n44,822 lbs. of mace, and 11,813 lbs. of cloves. Now the consumption of\r\nthese spices in Great Britain was, on an average of four years ending\r\n1841, as follows:--Nutmegs, 121,000 lbs.; mace, 18,000 lbs.; cloves,\r\n92,000 lbs. Showing, therefore, that the Straits' Settlements already\r\nproduce more than sufficient of the two former to supply the home\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nIn the course of four or five years more, Pinang alone will more than\r\ndouble the present quantity of nutmegs and mace produced in the\r\nStraits, and the produce of cloves will be more than tripled.\r\n\r\nI have been able, from several elaborate papers in my \"Colonial\r\nMagazine,\" to condense details, showing the progress of spice\r\nplantations in Prince of Wales Island and Province Wellesley. In the\r\nclose of 1843 there were 64,902 nutmeg trees in bearing in the island;\r\n39,209 male trees, 103,982 not bearing; making a total of 208,093\r\ntrees planted out, besides 52,510 plants in nursery. The quantity of\r\nground under cultivation was 2,282 orlongs. The produce in 1842 was\r\n15,116,591 good nuts, 1,461,229 inferior nuts, and 38,260 lbs. of\r\nmace. The gross value of the produce in 1843, reckoning the good nuts\r\nat five dollars per thousand, and the inferior at one dollar, was\r\n76,944 dollars. The estimated number of nuts in 1843 was 12,458,762;\r\nin 1844, 25,429,000.\r\n\r\nIn Province Wellesley there were 247 orlongs under cultivation with\r\nthe nutmeg, on which were 10,500 bearing trees, 8,095 male trees, and\r\n7,307 not yet bearing, making in all 25,902 trees planted out. The\r\nproduce was in 1842, 1,969,619 good nuts, 18,842 inferior ditto, and\r\n4,500 lbs. of mace. The value of the produce of nutmegs was 9,867\r\ndollars. The estimated number of nuts in 1843 was 1,980,000; in 1844,\r\n2,958,000. There were in all 423 nutmeg plantations on the island and\r\nmain land.\r\n\r\nThere were annually exported in the four years ending 1850, 48,000\r\nlbs. of nutmegs from Pinang, and 57,400 lbs. of mace.\r\n\r\nThe French at an early period cultivated the nutmeg at the Mauritius,\r\nand from thence they carried it to Cayenne. In Sumatra it appears to\r\nhave been grown successfully, and according to Sir S. Raffles, there\r\nwas in 1819 a plantation at Bencoolen of 100,000 nutmeg trees,\r\none-fourth of which were bearing. Attempts have been made in Trinidad\r\nand St. Vincent to carry out the culture, but for want of enterprise\r\nvery little progress seems to have been made in the matter.\r\n\r\nUnder the new duties which came into operation this year, nutmegs,\r\ninstead of standing at 1s. per pound all round, have been classified,\r\nand the so-called \"wild\" nutmegs of the Dutch islands are to pay only\r\n5d per pound. This deprives the Straits' produce of its last\r\nprotection against that of the Banda plantations, where the tree grows\r\nspontaneously, while it gives the long Dutch nut a high protection. If\r\nan alteration in this suicidal measure is not speedily obtained, the\r\nStraits' planters will be ruined. The Dutch have the power of\r\ninundating the market with the long aromatic nut. If the original plan\r\nof putting all British and all foreign nutmegs on the same footing had\r\nbeen adhered to, the Straits' planters would not have complained, as\r\nthey would have trusted to their superior skill and care to compensate\r\nfor the grand advantage the Dutch have in their rich soils.\r\n\r\nOn observing this alteration of duty, Mr. Crawfurd and Mr. Gilman\r\nimmediately prepared the following memorandum for the Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer, which however failed to influence that Minister:--\r\n\r\n    \"MEMORANDUM ON THE DUTIES ON NUTMEGS.\r\n\r\n    \"The duty proposed to be levied on nutmegs is 1s. per pound for\r\n    cultivated, and 5d. per pound for those commonly called wild. The\r\n    ground on which this distinction is founded, is said to be that the\r\n    market value of the one is but half that of the other, and that the\r\n    Customs can readily distinguish between them.\r\n\r\n    Now it is admitted, on all sides, that there is but one species of\r\n    culinary nutmeg, the _Myristica Moschata_ of botanists, although at\r\n    least a score of the same genus, all unfit for human food. The\r\n    parent country of the aromatic nutmegs extends from the Molucca\r\n    Islands to New Guinea, inclusive. In this they grow with facility\r\n    and even in the Banda Islands, where there are parks of them, they\r\n    hardly undergo any cultivation, and may truly be said, even there,\r\n    to be a wild product. It is only when grown as exotics, as in the\r\n    British settlements of Pinang and Singapore, that they require\r\n    cultivation, and that a more careful and expensive one than any\r\n    other produce of the soil.\r\n\r\n    Aromatic nutmegs are sometimes large and sometimes small--sometimes\r\n    round, sometimes oblong, and sometimes long, and this will be found\r\n    the case whether cultivated or uncultivated. How, then, the Customs\r\n    are able to distinguish them it is difficult to understand. In the\r\n    ordinary Prices Current no mention whatever is made of the wild and\r\n    cultivated, the lowest quality being quoted in the most recent at\r\n    2s. per pound, and the highest at 3s. 10d.,--the best of what are\r\n    called wild fetching a higher price than the lower qualities of what\r\n    are called cultivated.\r\n\r\n     But suppose the distinction could be made with the most perfect\r\n     certainty, to make it would be a palpable departure from the\r\n     principle adopted with every other commodity, of charging a\r\n     uniform rate of duty on quality. To give an example, the present\r\n     price of black pepper is 3-5/8d. to 4d. per pound, while that of\r\n     white pepper is 8½d. to 1s. 2d. per pound, both paying the same\r\n     duty of 6d.; yet nothing can be more easily distinguished than\r\n     these two commodities, which, except as to curing, are the same\r\n     article.\r\n\r\n    Tea is a still more striking example. The duty is the same on all\r\n    qualities, though prices range from 1l½d. to 3s. 6d. per pound. It\r\n    was the very circumstance of the difficulty of distinguishing\r\n    between the different kinds of tea, especially between Bohea and\r\n    Congou, which, after an eighteen months trial, overthrew the system\r\n    of rated duties of 1s. 6d., 2s., and 3s., adopted on the abolition\r\n    of the East India Company's monopoly in 1833.\r\n\r\n    Unless the duty on nutmegs is equalised there will be no end of\r\n    trouble and disputes, and however expert the Customs may be, they\r\n    will certainly be outwitted, and long-shaped and small nutmegs,\r\n    although really cultivated, will be introduced at the lower duty, by\r\n    unscrupulous traders, as wild ones.\r\n\r\n    It may be added that duties of 12d. and 5d. do not, even if a\r\n    departure from the principle of charging on quality were\r\n    justifiable, represent the just proportional rates which ought to be\r\n    levied upon what are supposed to be, respectively, cultivated and\r\n    wild, as they are represented in the ordinary Price Current by the\r\n    highest and lowest prices, which are 3s. 10d. and 2s. The just\r\n    proportional duty ought to be on the lowest, not 5d., but 7d. The\r\n    duty, as first proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, of 1s.\r\n    per pound on nutmegs, without distinction, was perfectly\r\n    satisfactory to the planters, merchants, and the trade in general.\r\n\r\n    It is a mistake to suppose that a duty of 1s. would exclude the\r\n    so-called wild nutmegs. They would be imported in large quantities,\r\n    as the cost is low. In quantity it was 17 Spanish dollars per picul,\r\n    and there is no reason to suppose it would be more now. The finest\r\n    picked cost say 34 Spanish dollars.\r\n\r\n    In Pinang and Singapore for cultivated the price is 65 to 70\r\n    dollars.\r\n\r\n    The planters for the most part do not sell on the spot, but consign\r\n    here for sale on their own account.\r\n\r\n    London, May 23rd, 1853.\r\n\r\n\r\n    NUTMEGS IMPORTED AND EXPORTED TO AND FROM SINGAPORE.\r\n\r\n                                            Value of the\r\n         Imported.

It is also grown in China. In the young state the\r\nrhizomes are fleshy and slightly aromatic, and they are then used as\r\npreserves, or prepared in syrup; in a more advanced stage the aroma is\r\nfully developed, their texture is more woody, and they become fit for\r\nordinary ginger. The inferior sorts, when dried after immersion in hot\r\nwater, form black ginger. The best roots are scraped, washed, and\r\nsimply dried in the sun with care, and then they receive the name of\r\nwhite ginger. The rhizome contains an acid resin and volatile oil,\r\nstarch and gum. It is used medicinally as a tonic and carminative, in\r\nthe form of powder, syrup, and tincture.\r\n\r\nThe root stocks of _Alpinia racemosa_, _A. Galanga_, and many other\r\nplants of the order, have the same aromatic and pungent properties as\r\nginger.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of ginger is about 13,000 or 14,000 cwt. a year. Of\r\n16,004 cwt. imported in 1840, 5,381 came from the British West Indies,\r\n9,727 from the East India Company's possessions and Ceylon, and 896\r\ncwt. from Western Africa.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the black and white ginger of the shops is\r\nascribed by Dr. P. Browne and others to different methods of curing\r\nthe rhizomes; but this is scarcely sufficient to account for them, and\r\nI cannot help suspecting the existence of some difference in the\r\nplants themselves. That this really exists is proved by the\r\nstatements of Rumphius (\"Herb. Amb.,\" lib. 8, cap. xix., p. 156), that\r\nthere are two varieties of the plant, the white and the red. Moreover\r\nDr. Wright (\"Lond. Med. Journal,\" vol. viii.) says that two sorts are\r\ncultivated in Jamaica, viz., the white and the black; and, he adds,\r\n\"black ginger has the most numerous and largest roots.\"\r\n\r\nThe rhizome, called in commerce ginger root, occurs in\r\nflattish-branched or lobed palmate pieces, called _races_, which do\r\nnot exceed four inches in length. Several varieties, distinguished by\r\ntheir color and place of growth, are met with. The finest is that\r\nbrought from Jamaica. A great part of that found in the shops has been\r\nwashed in whiting and water, under the pretence of preserving it from\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nThe dark colored kinds are frequently bleached with chloride of lime.\r\nBarbados ginger is in shorter flatter races, of a darker color, and\r\ncovered with a corrugated epidermis. African ginger is in smallish\r\nraces, which have been partially scraped, and are pale colored. East\r\nIndia ginger is unscraped; its races are dark ash colored externally,\r\nand are larger than those of the African ginger. Tellichery ginger is\r\nin large plump races, with a remarkable reddish tint externally.\r\n\r\nJamaica black ginger is not frequently found in the shops. The Malabar\r\ndark ginger is in unscraped short pieces, which have a horny\r\nappearance internally, and are of a dirty brown color both internally\r\nand externally.\r\n\r\nGinger is imported in bags weighing about a hundred-weight.\r\n\r\nThe Malabar ginger exported from Calicut is the produce of the\r\ndistrict of Shernaad, situated in the south of Calicut; a place\r\nchiefly inhabited by Moplas, who look upon the ginger cultivation as a\r\nmost valuable and profitable trade, which in fact it is. The soil of\r\nShernaad is so very luxuriant, and so well suited for the cultivation\r\nof ginger, that it is reckoned the best, and in fact the only place in\r\nMalabar where ginger grows and thrives to perfection. Gravelly grounds\r\nare considered unfit; the same may be said of swampy ones, and whilst\r\nthe former check the growth of the ginger, the latter tend in a great\r\nmeasure to rot the root; thus the only suitable kind of soil is that\r\nwhich, being red earth, is yet free from gravel, and the sod good and\r\nheavy. The cultivation generally commences about the middle of May,\r\nafter the ground has undergone a thorough process of ploughing,\r\nharrowing, &c.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the monsoons, beds of ten or twelve feet long\r\nby three or four feet wide are formed, and in these beds small holes\r\nare dug at three-fourths to one foot apart, which are filled with\r\nmanure. The roots, hitherto carefully buried under sheds, are dug out,\r\nthe good ones picked from those which are affected by the moisture, or\r\nany other concomitant of a half-year's exclusion from the atmosphere,\r\nand the process of clipping them into suitable sizes for planting\r\nperformed by cutting the ginger into pieces of an inch and a half to\r\ntwo inches long. These are then buried in the holes, which have been\r\npreviously manured, and the whole of the beds are then covered with a\r\ngood thick layer of green leaves, which, whilst they serve as manure,\r\nalso contribute to keep the beds from unnecessary dampness, which\r\nmight otherwise be occasioned by the heavy falls of rain during the\r\nmonths of June and July. Rain is essentially requisite for the growth\r\nof the ginger; it is also however necessary, that the beds be\r\nconstantly kept from inundation, which, if not carefully attended to,\r\nthe crop is entirely ruined; great precaution is therefore taken in\r\nforming drains between the beds, and letting water out, thus\r\npreventing a superfluity. On account of the great tendency some kinds\r\nof leaves have to breed worms and insects, strict care is observed in\r\nthe choosing of them, and none but the particular kinds used in\r\nmanuring ginger are taken in, lest the wrong ones might fetch in\r\nworms, which, if once in the beds, no remedy can be resorted to\r\nsuccessfully to destroy them; thus they in a very short time ruin the\r\ncrop. Worms bred from the leaves laid on the soil, though highly\r\ndestructive, are not so pernicious to ginger cultivation as those\r\nwhich proceed from the effect of the soil. The former kind, whilst\r\nthey destroy the beds in which they once appear, do not spread\r\nthemselves to the other beds, be they ever so close, but the latter\r\nkind must of _course_ be found in almost all the beds, as they do not\r\nproceed from accidental causes, but from the nature of the soil. In\r\ncases like these, the whole crop is oftentimes ruined, and the\r\ncultivators are thereby subjected to heavy losses.\r\n\r\nGinger is extensively diffused throughout the Indian isles, it being\r\nespecially indigenous to the East, and of pretty general use among the\r\nnatives, who neglect the finer spices. The great and smaller varieties\r\nare cultivated, and the sub-varieties distinguished by their brown or\r\nwhite colors. There is no production which has a greater diversity of\r\nnames. This diversity proves, as usual, the wide diffusion of the\r\nplant in its wild state. The ginger of the Indian Archipelago is\r\nhowever inferior in quality to that of Malabar or Bengal. In the\r\ncultivation of ginger great improvement may be adopted and expense\r\nsaved. The garden plough and small harrow should be used.\r\n\r\nThe present mode of preparing the land for this crop in the West\r\nIndies, is by first carefully hoeing off all bush and weeds from the\r\npiece you intend to plant; the workmen are then placed in a line, and\r\ndig forward the land to the full depth of the hoe, cutting the furrow\r\nnot more than from five to six inches thick. The land is then allowed\r\nto pulverise for a short time; you then prepare it for receiving the\r\nplants by opening drills with the hoe, from ten to twelve inches\r\napart, and the same in depth, chopping or breaking up any clods that\r\nmay be in the land. Two or three women follow and drop the plants in\r\nthe drills, say from nine to ten inches apart. The plants or sets are\r\nthe small knots or fingers broken off the original root, as not worth\r\nthe scraping. The plants are then covered in with a portion of the\r\nearth-bank formed in drilling. It requires great care and attention in\r\nkeeping them clean from weeds until they attain sufficient age. It\r\nthrows out a pedicle or foot stalk in the course of the second or\r\nthird week, the leaves of which are of similar shape to that of the\r\nGuinea grass.\r\n\r\nGinger is a delicate plant, and very liable to rot, particularly if\r\nplanted in too rich a soil, or where it may be subject to heavy rains.\r\nThe general average of yield is from 1,500 to 2,000 lbs. per acre in\r\nplants, although I have known as much as 3,000 lbs. of ginger cured\r\nfrom an acre of land. The planting season generally commences in\r\nJamaica in February and March, and the crop is got in in December and\r\nJanuary, when the stalks begin to wither. The ginger is taken from the\r\nground by means of the hoe, each laborer filling a good-sized basket,\r\nat the same time breaking off the small knots or knobs for future\r\nplanting.\r\n\r\nA good scraper of ginger will give you from 30 to 40 lbs. of ginger\r\nper day. It is then laid on barbacues (generally made of boards) to\r\ndry. It takes from six to ten days to be properly cured. The average\r\nyield in weight is about one-third of what is scraped. When intended\r\nfor preserving, the roots must be taken up at the end of three or four\r\nmonths, while the fibres are tender and full of sap.\r\n\r\nThe ginger grown in the West Indies is considered superior in quality\r\nto that of the East, doubtless because more care is paid to the\r\nculture and drying of the root, but it is of less importance to\r\ncommerce. The quantities imported from these two quarters is however\r\nbecoming more equal, and Africa is coming into the field as a\r\nproducer, 1,545 casks and packages having arrived from the western\r\ncoast in 1846. The annual average export of ginger from Barbados\r\nbetween the years 1740 and 1788, was 4,667 bags; between 1784 and\r\n1786, 6,320 bags; in 1788, 5,562 cwt. were shipped; in 1792, 3,046\r\nbags and barrels. In 1738, so widely was the culture of this root\r\ndiffused in Jamaica, that 20,933 bags, of one cwt. each, and 8,864\r\nlbs. in casks were shipped. The exports may now be taken on an average\r\nat 4,000 cwt.; but, like all the other staple products of the island,\r\nthis has fallen off one-half since the emancipation of the negro\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nIn the three years which preceded the abolition of slavery, 5,719,000\r\nlbs. of ginger were shipped from Jamaica. In the three years ending\r\nwith 1848, the quantity shipped had decreased 2,612,186 lbs., as will\r\nbe seen by the following returns:--\r\n\r\n                     GINGER SHIPPED.\r\n                   lbs.                          lbs.\r\n  1830          1,748,800   |   1846          1,462,000\r\n  1831          1,614,640   |   1847          1,324,480\r\n  1832          2,355,560   |   1848            320,340\r\n                ---------   |                 ---------\r\n                5,719,000   |                 3,106,820\r\n\r\nIn 1843 there were shipped from Jamaica 3,719 casks and bags; in 1844,\r\n3,692 casks and 1730 bags; in 1845, 3,506 casks, valued at £4 10s.\r\neach, and 1,129 bags, valued at £2 each, equal in all to £18,037.\r\nFrom the island of Hayti 8,769 lbs. of ginger were exported in 1835,\r\nand 15,509 lbs. in 1836. 39 packages of ginger were shipped from\r\nBarbados in 1851.\r\n\r\nIn Maranham and one or two other provinces of Brazil, ginger of an\r\nexcellent quality is grown, and a good deal is exported. It was very\r\nearly an article of culture in South America. According to Acosta, it\r\nwas brought to America by one Francisco de Mendoza, from Malabar, and\r\nso rapidly did its cultivation spread, that as far back as 1547,\r\n22,053 cwt. were shipped to Europe. Southey, in his \"History of\r\nBrazil\" (vol. i., p. 320), says, \"Ginger had been brought from the\r\nisland of St. Thomas, and throve so well that in the year 1573, 4,000\r\narrobas of 25 lbs. each were cured; it was better than what came from\r\nIndia, though the art of drying it was not so well understood. Great\r\nuse was made of this root in preserves, but it was prohibited, as\r\ninterfering with the Indian trade in that wretched species of policy\r\nwhich regards immediate revenue as its main object.\"\r\n\r\nGinger was worth in the London market 25s. to 60s. the cwt. in bond;\r\nmiddling and fine qualities, 80s. to 160s.

It is the rhizoma of _Alpinia Galanga_. Its taste is peppery and\r\naromatic. Externally the color of the root-stocks is reddish brown,\r\ninternally pale reddish white.\r\n\r\n1,280 cwt. of galangale root, valued at 2,880 dollars, was exported\r\nfrom Canton in 1850.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARDAMOMS.\r\n\r\nCardamoms are the production of various species of plants of the same\r\ntribe as the ginger, and might be profitably cultivated with that\r\naromatic root, as well as the Turmeric (_Curcuma longa_), which see.\r\n\r\nVarious species of _Alpiniæ_, _Amomum_, _Elettaria_, _and Renealmia_,\r\nappear to furnish the cardamoms of the shops, which consist of the\r\noval, trivalvular capsules containing the seeds. The bright yellow\r\nseeds are used in medicine as aromatic tonics and carminatives; and\r\nfor curries, ketchups, soups, &c. Their active ingredient is a pungent\r\nvolatile oil. The least dampness injures the finer sorts. About 688\r\ncwts. of cardamoms, and 5,000 cwts. of bastard cardamoms are annually\r\nexported from Siam, \"We imported about 300 tons in 1849. The price\r\nranges from 1s. 6d. to 3s. the pound. The estimated value of the\r\ncardamoms and pepper shipped from Ceylon in the past few years was as\r\nfollows:--1846, £208; 1847, £246; 1848, £205; 1849, £454; 1850, £960;\r\n1851, £771; 1852, £590. The\" following are some of the plants from\r\nwhich cardamoms are procured.\r\n\r\n1. _Amomum Cardamomum_, a Java plant, supplies the round cardamoms. It\r\nhas pale brown flowers. The fruit varies in size from that of a black\r\ncurrant to a cherry.\r\n\r\n_2. A. angustifolium_ (Pereira), a plant having red blossoms;\r\nfurnishes the large Madagascar cardamoms, and also supplies some of\r\nthe seeds called \"Grains of Paradise,\" which are, however, larger than\r\nthose imported under that name.\r\n\r\nThis species is found in Abyssinia, according to my friend Mr. Chas.\r\nJohnston, author of \"Travels in Abyssinia,\" who favored me with some\r\nspecimens. The seeds are pale olive brown, devoid of the fiery peppery\r\ntaste of the grains of paradise.\r\n\r\n3. _A. maximum_, the great winged amomum, produces the Java cardamoma\r\nof the London market, and is also grown extensively in Ceylon, the\r\nMalay islands, Nepaul, Sumatra, and other islands of the Eastern\r\nArchipelago. There were exported from Ceylon in 1842, 5,364 lbs.; in\r\n1843, 9,632 lbs.; 1844, 7,280 lbs.; and in 1845, 11,812 lbs. The pods\r\nare large and long, and dark colored, approaching to black, the taste\r\nnauseous and disagreeable, not the least resembling that of the\r\nMalabar cardamoms. It is propagated by cuttings of the rhizoma. The\r\nplants yield in three years, and afterwards give an annual crop. They\r\nare not used here, but sent to the continent.\r\n\r\n4. _Alpinia Cardamomum_.--This is the source of the clustered\r\ncardamoms, and furnishes the best known sort. Its produce is in great\r\nrequest throughout India, fetching as much as £30 the candy of 600\r\nLbs. About 192 candies are grown annually in Travancore, and the usual\r\ncrop in Malabar is reckoned at 100 candies annually. It flourishes on\r\nthe mountainous parts of the Malabar coast, and among the western\r\nmountains of Wynaad. The bulbous plants, which grow three or four feet\r\nhigh, are produced in the recesses of the mountains by felling trees,\r\nand afterwards burning them, for wherever the ashes fall in the\r\nopenings or fissures of the rocks, the plant naturally springs up. In\r\nthe third year the plants come to perfection, bearing abundantly for a\r\nyear or two, and then die. In Soonda Balagat, and other places where\r\ncardamoms are planted, they are much inferior to those grown in the\r\nwild state. It may be propagated by cuttings or divisions of the\r\nroots. Not more than one-hundredth part of the cardamoms raised in\r\nMalabar are used in the country. They are sent in large quantities to\r\nthe ports on the Red Sea, and the Persian Gulf, up the Indus to\r\nScinde, to Bengal and Bombay. The price of Malabar cardamons at\r\nMadras, in June, 1853, was about £3 the maund of 25 lbs. They fetch in\r\nthe Bombay market £4 10s. the maund of 40 lbs. Cardamoms form a\r\nuniversal ingredient in curries, pillaus, &c. The seed capsules are\r\ngathered as they ripen, and when dried in the sun are fit for sale.\r\nThey should be chosen full, plump, and difficult to be broken; of a\r\nbright yellow color, and piercing smell; with an acrid bitterish,\r\nthough not very unpleasant taste, and particular care should be taken\r\nthat they are properly dried.\r\n\r\n_5. Amomum Grana-Paradisi_, which is indigenous to the islands of\r\nMadagascar and Ceylon, yields an inferior sort of cardamoms, known by\r\nthe names of grains of paradise, or Meleguetta pepper. These are worth\r\nin the English market only from 1s. 2d. to 1s. 4d. per pound, while\r\nthe long and Malabar cardamoms fetch 2s. 8d. to 3s. 3d. the pound.\r\nThis plant is a native of Guinea, and the western parts of Africa\r\nabout Sierra Leone. We imported from thence in 1841, 7,911 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe taste of these Guinea grains is aromatic and vehemently hot or\r\npeppery. They are imported in casks from Africa, and are principally\r\nused in veterinary medicine, and to give an artificial strength to\r\nspirits, wine, beer, &c. The average quantity on which duty was paid\r\nin the six years ending with 1840, was 16,000 lbs. per annum. They are\r\nesteemed in Africa the most wholesome of spices, and generally used by\r\nthe natives to season their food.\r\n\r\nDr. Pereira, from a careful examination and close inquiry, is of\r\nopinion that the _Amomum Grana-Paradisi_ of Smith, and the _Amamum\r\nMelegueta_ of Roscoe, are identical species.\r\n\r\nIn the second volume of the \"Pharmaceutical Journal,\" Dr. Pereira\r\nstates that the term \"grains of paradise,\" or Melegueta, has been\r\napplied to the produce of no less than six scitamineous plants. At the\r\npresent time, and in this country, the term is exclusively given to\r\nthe hot acrid seeds imported into England from the coast of Guinea,\r\nand frequently called Guinea grains; and by the Africans Guinea\r\npepper.\r\n\r\n_Elettaria Cardomomum_, Don.--The fruit of this species constitutes\r\nthe true, small, officinal Malabar cardamoms. It is an ovate oblong,\r\nobtusely triangular capsule, from three to ten lines long, rarely\r\nexceeding three lines in breadth, coriaceous, ribbed, greyish or\r\nbrownish yellow. It contains many angular, blackish or reddish brown\r\nrugose seeds, which are white internally, have a pleasant aromatic\r\nodor, and a warm agreeable taste. 100 parts of the fruit yield 74\r\nparts of seeds, and 26 parts of pericarpal coats.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be identical with _Amomum Cardamomum_.\r\n\r\n_Elettaria major_, is a perennial, native of Ceylon, which grows in\r\nshady situations in a rich mixed soil. The dried capsules are known in\r\ncommerce as wild or Ceylon cardamoms, and are of less value in the\r\nmarket than those of Malabar (_Elettaria Cardamomum_, Maton). It is\r\nchiefly grown about the Kandyan district; and in the eight years\r\nending with 1813, the average export was nine and a-half candies per\r\nannum. The seeds in taste resemble our carraways, and are used for\r\nseasoning various dishes.\r\n\r\nCeylon cardamoms are now worth in the London market (Sept., 1853) 1s.\r\nto 1s. 3d. per lb.; Malabar ditto, 2s. 3d. to 3s.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEPPER.\r\n\r\nThe black pepper of commerce is obtained from the dried unripe fruit\r\n(drupes) of _Piper nigrum_, a climbing plant common in the East\r\nIndies, and of the simplest culture, being multiplied with facility by\r\ncuttings or suckers. The ripe fruit, when deprived of its outer fleshy\r\ncovering by washing, forms the white pepper of the shops. The dried\r\nfruiting spikes of _P. longum_, a perennial shrub, native of Malabar\r\nand Bengal, constitute long pepper. The fruit of _Xylopia aromatica_\r\nis commonly called Ethiopian pepper, from being used as pepper in\r\nAfrica. The seeds of some species of fennel-flower (_Nigella sativa_\r\nand _arvensis_), natives of the south of Europe, were formerly used\r\ninstead of pepper, and are said to be still extensively employed in\r\nadulterating it. In Japan, the capsules of _Xanthoxylum piperitum_, or\r\n_Fagara Piperita_, are used as a substitute for pepper, and so is the\r\nfruit of _Tasmannia aromatica_ in Van Diemen's Land. According to Dr.\r\nRoxburgh, _P. trioicum_ is cultivated in the East, and yields an\r\nexcellent pepper.\r\n\r\nThe pepper vine rises about two feet in the first year of its growth,\r\nand attains to nearly six feet in the second, at which time, if\r\nvigorous and healthy, the petals begin to form the corolla or blossom.\r\nAll suckers and side shoots are to be carefully removed, and the vines\r\nshould be thinned or pruned, if they become bushy at the top. Rank\r\ncoarse weeds and parasitical plants should be uprooted. The vine would\r\nclimb, if permitted, to the elevation of twenty feet, but is said to\r\nbear best when kept down to the height of ten or twelve feet. It\r\nproduces two crops in the year. The fruit grows abundantly from all\r\nthe branches, in long small clusters of from 20 to 50 grains; when\r\nripe it is of a bright red color. After being gathered, it is spread\r\non mats in the sun to dry, when it becomes black and shrivelled. The\r\ngrains are separated from the stalks by hand rubbing. The roots and\r\nthickest parts of the stems, when cut into small pieces and dried,\r\nform a considerable article of commerce all over India, under the name\r\nof _Pippula moola_.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the plants of the family _Piperaceæ_ have a strong aromatic\r\nsmell and a sharp burning taste. This small group of plants is\r\nconfined to the hottest regions of the globe; being most abundant in\r\ntropical America and in the East Indian Archipelago, but more rare in\r\nthe equinoctial regions of Africa. The common black pepper, _P.\r\nnigrum_, represents the usual property of the order, which is not\r\nconfined to the fruit, but pervades, more or less, the whole plant. It\r\nis peculiar to the torrid zone of Asia, and appears to be indigenous\r\nto the coast of Malabar, where it has been found in a wild state. From\r\nthis it extends between the meridians of longitude 96 deg. and 116\r\ndeg. S. and the parallels of latitude 5 deg. S. and 12 deg. N., beyond\r\nwhich no pepper is found. Within these limits are the islands of\r\nSumatra and Borneo, with the Malay peninsula and part of Siam. Sumatra\r\nproduces by far the greatest quantity of pepper. In 1842, the annual\r\nproduce of this island was reckoned at 30,000,000 lbs., being more\r\nthan the amount furnished by all the other pepper districts in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nA little pepper is grown in the Mauritius and the West India Islands,\r\nand its cultivation is making some progress on the Western Coast of\r\nAfrica, as we imported from thence 2,909 bags and casks in 1846, and\r\nabout 110,000 lbs. in 1847.\r\n\r\nMr. J. Crawfurd, F.R.S., one of the best authorities on all that\r\nrelates to the commerce and agriculture of the Eastern Archipelago,\r\nrecently estimated the produce of pepper as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                                lbs.\r\n  Sumatra (West Coast)                       20,000,000\r\n     \"    (East Coast)                        8,000,000\r\n  Islands in the Straits of Malacca           3,600,000\r\n  Malay Peninsula                             3,733,333\r\n  Borneo                                      2,666,667\r\n  Siam                                        8,000,000\r\n  Malabar                                     4,060,000\r\n                                             ----------\r\n  Total                                      50,000,000\r\n\r\n  If we add to this\r\n\r\n  Western Coast of Africa and B.W.

In the first\r\nintercourse of the Dutch and English with India, it constituted the\r\nmost considerable and important staple of their commerce. The\r\nproduction of pepper is confined in a great measure to the western\r\ncountries of the Eastern Archipelago, and among these to the islands\r\nin the centre and to the northern quarter, including the Peninsula. It\r\nis obtained in the ports on both sides of the coast of the latter, but\r\nparticularly the north-eastern coast. The principal quarters\r\n(according to Mr. Crawfurd, my authority on this subject), are Patani,\r\nTringanu, and Kalantin. In the Straits a large quantity is produced in\r\nthe island of Singapore, and above all in Pinang, where the capital of\r\nEuropeans and the skill and industry of the Chinese have been\r\nsuccessfully applied to its culture. The western extremity of Sumatra,\r\nand the north-west coast of that island, are the most remarkable\r\nsituations in it for the production of pepper, and here we have\r\nAcheen, Tikao, Bencoolen, Padang, and the country of the Lampungs. The\r\nproduction of the eastern extremity of Sumatra or Palembang is\r\nconsiderable, but held of inferior quality. In the fertile island of\r\nJava, the quantity of pepper grown is inconsiderable, nor is it\r\nremarkable for the goodness of its quality.\r\n\r\nThe province of Bantam has always furnished, and still continues to\r\nproduce, the most pepper; but the culture of this creeper is fast\r\ngiving place in Java to staples affording higher profits and requiring\r\nless care. The exports were, in the following years:--\r\n\r\n             piculs.  |              lbs.\r\n  1830         6,061  |  1843     3,737,732\r\n  1835        11,868  |  1848       461,680\r\n  1839        11,044  |  1851        95,037\r\n  1841        13,477  |  1852       135,690\r\n\r\nThe number of pepper vines in the district of Bencoolen, in the close\r\nof last year, 1852, was as follows:--1,571,894 young vines; 2,437,052\r\nbearing ditto; total, 4,008,946.\r\n\r\nUp to the end of September there had been delivered to the Government\r\n1,145 piculs white pepper, and 1,128 piculs black pepper, while of the\r\nharvest of 1852 there were still probably to be received 330 piculs\r\nwhite, and 4,967 piculs black pepper.\r\n\r\nThe south, the west, and the north coasts of the great island of\r\nBorneo produce a large quantity of pepper; as early as 1721 it was a\r\nstaple commodity of this island. Banjarmassin is the most productive\r\nplace on the south coast, and the State of Borneo Proper on the north\r\ncoast. The best pepper certainly does not grow in the richest soils,\r\nfor the peppers of Java and Palembang are the worst of the\r\nArchipelago, and that of Pinang and the west coast of Sumatra are the\r\nbest. Care in culture and curing improves the quality, as with other\r\narticles, and for this reason chiefly it is that the pepper of Pinang\r\nis more in esteem than that of any other portion of the Archipelago.\r\nFrom the ports and districts of Siam 3,500 to 4,000 tons are exported\r\nannually.\r\n\r\nThe duty at present levied on pepper in England is 6d. per lb., while\r\nthe wholesale price for that of Pinang, Malabar, and Sumatra is about\r\n4d. per lb. White pepper ranges from 9d. to 1s. 6d. per lb. The prime\r\ncost in Singapore is not more than 1½d. per lb.\r\n\r\nAbout 70,000 or 80,000 piculs of pepper are annually exported from\r\nSingapore, of which between 30,000 and 40,000 piculs have, until\r\nwithin the last two years, gone on to Great Britain. More than\r\none-half of the pepper exported from Singapore is grown in the island\r\nby Chinese settlers.\r\n\r\nThe low selling price of the article in the English market, the high\r\nduty levied upon it, and the large freight paid for its carriage to\r\nGreat Britain, now leave so small a price to the cultivator in\r\nSingapore, that the cultivation ceases to be remunerative, and is\r\ncarried on at a loss; and has consequently within the last year or two\r\nbegun to decrease rapidly, involving the Chinese growers, who are\r\ngenerally of the poorest class, and without capital, in great\r\ndistress. A reduction in the duty on pepper has always been followed\r\nby a very large increase in the consumption of the article, as will\r\nappear from the following table, showing the importation and\r\nconsumption in Great Britain during some of the first and last years\r\nof the different rates of duty:--\r\n\r\n                               Duty              Singapore price\r\n  Year    Quantity consumed    s.  d.         s.  d.        s.  d.\r\n  1811        1,457,383        1  10½         0   7½   to   0   7¾\r\n  1814          941,569        1  10½         0  11     \"   1   1\r\n  1820        1,404,021        2   6          0   6½    \"   0   6¾\r\n  1824        1,447,030        2   6          0   4¾    \"   0   5½\r\n  1826        2,529,027        2   0          0   4     \"   0   4½\r\n  1836        2,749,491        1   0          0   0     \"   0   0\r\n  1837        2,625,075        0   6          0   0     \"   0   0\r\n  1845        3,210,415        0   6          0   2¼    \"   0   4¾\r\n\r\nIn a memorial from the mercantile community of Singapore, sent home in\r\n1848, it is asserted that a reduction in the duty of pepper being\r\nalways attended by a large increase in the consumption, would not lead\r\nto any serious loss in the revenue, while it would confer a great boon\r\non the poorer classes, to whom it has now become a necessary article\r\nof life. The reduction would also be of great advantage to British\r\nmanufacturers, as well as to our Indian possessions, by giving rise to\r\nan increased demand or British goods and productions, and of the\r\nhighest benefit to the agricultural settlers in the island of\r\nSingapore, by enabling them to procure for their labor an honest means\r\nof livelihood.\r\n\r\nThe pepper vines, which are allowed to climb poles or small trees, are\r\ntolerably productive at Singapore; and pepper planting is esteemed by\r\nthe Chinese to be a profitable speculation, particularly if they are\r\nenabled to evade the payment of quit-rent. An acre of pepper vines\r\nwill yield 1,161 lbs. of clean pepper. In Sumatra a full grown plant\r\nhas been known to produce seven pounds; in Pinang the yield is much\r\nmore. The average produce of one thousand vines is said, however, to\r\nbe only about 450 lbs.\r\n\r\nColonel Low, in his \"Dissertation on Pinang,\" published at Singapore\r\nsome years ago, gives an interesting account of the culture:--\r\n\r\n    \"Pepper was, during many years, the staple product of Pinang soil,\r\n    the average annual quantity having been nearly four millions of\r\n    pounds; but previous to the year 1810, the above amount had\r\n    decreased to about two-and-a-half millions of pounds, which was the\r\n    result of the continental system.\r\n\r\n    The price having fallen at length to three and three-and-a-half\r\n    dollars the picul--with only a few occasional exceptions of\r\n    rises--the cultivation of this spice was gradually abandoned, and\r\n    the total product at this day does not exceed 2,000 piculs. The\r\n    original cost, when pepper was at a high price, together with\r\n    charges of transporting it to Europe, amounted to £36,357 for every\r\n    five hundred tons, and the loss by wastage was estimated at £5,405.\r\n    In 1818 there remained on the island 1,480,265 pepper vines in\r\n    bearing, and the average value of exports of pepper from Pinang,\r\n    including that received from other places, was averaged at 106,870\r\n    Spanish dollars.\r\n\r\n    As might have been foreseen, the fall of prices has so greatly\r\n    diminished the cultivation of pepper to the eastward, that a\r\n    reaction is likely to take place; and has in fact partly shown\r\n    itself already. Some Chinese in Pinang and Province Wellesley seem\r\n    to be preparing to renew the cultivation. There is abundant scope\r\n    for the purpose on both sides of the harbour, and every facility is\r\n    at hand for carrying it on.\r\n\r\n    The pepper plant or vine requires a good soil, the richer the\r\n    better, but the _red_ soil of the higher hills is not congenial, the\r\n    Chinese think, to it. The undulations skirting the bases of the\r\n    hills, and the deep alluvial lands, where not saturated with water,\r\n    or liable to be overflowed, are preferred.\r\n\r\n    The Chinese have always been the chief cultivators, and when the\r\n    speculation flourished they received advances from the merchants,\r\n    which they paid back in produce at fixed rates.\r\n\r\n    When pepper was extensively cultivated on Prince of Wales Island,\r\n    the European owner of the land had the forest cleared by contract,\r\n    and the vines planted by contract, and when the vines came into\r\n    bearing the plantation was farmed to the Chinese from year to year,\r\n    on payment of a specific quantity of pepper. Any other plan would\r\n    have ruined the capitalist, as the culture is almost entirely in\r\n    their hands in the Straits' Settlements, and they will not work so\r\n    well for others as when they are specially interested.\r\n\r\n    The plants are set out at intervals, _every way_, of from seven to\r\n    twelve feet, according to the degree of fertility of the soil, so\r\n    that there are from 800 to 1,000 vines in one orlong of land; to\r\n    each vine is allotted a prop of from ten to thirteen feet high, cut\r\n    from the thorny tree called _dadap_, or where that is scarce, from\r\n    the less durable _boonglai_; these props take root, thus affording\r\n    both shade and support to the plant. The plant may be raised from\r\n    seed pepper, but the plan is not approved of, cuttings being\r\n    preferable, as they soonest come into bearing. The pits in which\r\n    these cuttings are set should be a foot-and-a-half square, and two\r\n    feet in depth; manure is not often applied, and then it is only some\r\n    turf ashes. However unpicturesque a pepper plantation may be, still\r\n    its neat and uniform appearance renders the landscape lively, and\r\n    there can be little doubt that the island has suffered in its\r\n    salubrity since the jungle usurped the extensive tracts formerly\r\n    under pepper cultivation.\r\n\r\n    When the vine has reached the height of three or four feet, it is\r\n    bent down and laid in the earth, and about five of the strongest\r\n    shoots which now spring up are retained and carefully trained up the\r\n    prop, to which they are tied by means of ligatures of some creeping\r\n    plants.\r\n\r\n    One Chinese, after the plantation has been formed, can take care of\r\n    two orlongs of land. The usual mode is this:--an advance is made by\r\n    the capitalist to the laborer for building a house, and for\r\n    agricultural implements; he then receives two dollars monthly to\r\n    subsist on, until the end of the third year, when the estate or\r\n    plantation is equally divided betwixt the contracting parties.\r\n\r\n    The Chinese and even European cultivators used formerly to engage\r\n    the Chinese who had just arrived from China; they paid off their\r\n    passage-money, and then allowed them two dollars monthly, for\r\n    provisions, for one year; with a suit of clothes, by which means the\r\n    cost of the labor of one man averaged about three dollars monthly;\r\n    but this plan is attended with risks.\r\n\r\n    The cost attendant on the cultivation of two orlongs of land, with\r\n    pepper, for three years--the Chinese laborer receiving the usual\r\n    hire of _five_ Spanish dollars monthly--will be nearly as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                                   Spanish dollars.\r\n  Price of land, clearing, and planting                   40\r\n  Quit rent, at 75 cents per annum per orlong              9\r\n  Two thousand plants                                      4\r\n         \"     dadap props                                 6\r\n  Implements                                               6\r\n  House                                                   10\r\n  Labor                                                  200\r\n  Interest, loosely calculated at                         30\r\n                                                         ---\r\n               Total Spanish dollars                     305\r\n\r\n    In a very good soil a pepper vine will yield about one-eighth of a\r\n    pound of dry produce at the end of the first year; at the end of the\r\n    second, about a quarter of a pound; and at the expiration of the\r\n    third, probably one pound; at the end of the fourth, from three to\r\n    three-and-a-half pounds; ditto fifth, from eight to ten pounds.\r\n    After the fifth year up to the fifteenth, or even the twentieth\r\n    year, about ten pounds of dry merchantable produce may be obtained\r\n    from each vine, under favorable circumstances. The Chinese\r\n    speculator used to rent out his half-share of a new plantation for\r\n    five years, to his cultivating partner, after the expiration of the\r\n    first three years, at the rate of thirty piculs per annum; the total\r\n    produce of these five years giving about fifty-six piculs annually\r\n    as an average.\r\n\r\n    A pepper plantation never survives the thirtieth year, unless in\r\n    extremely rich soil, and then it is unproductive; nor will the young\r\n    vine thrive on an old worn out pepper land, a peculiarity which is\r\n    applicable to the coffee tree. The chief crop lasts from August to\r\n    February. Four pounds of dry produce, for ten of green, is\r\n    considered a fair estimate. Great care is requisite in the\r\n    management of the vine, and especially in training and tying it on\r\n    the props. It is subject to be injured by the attacks of a small\r\n    insect. The green pepper dries in two or three days, and if it is\r\n    intended that it shall be black, it is pulled before it is quite\r\n    ripe. To make white pepper, the berry is allowed to remain somewhat\r\n    longer on the vine; it is, when plucked, immersed in boiling water,\r\n    by means of which process and subsequent friction, before drying,\r\n    the husk is separated.\r\n\r\n    The exports of pepper from Pinang in the last four years have\r\n    been--In 1849, 2,591,233 lbs.; in 1850, 6,397,733 lbs.; in 1851,\r\n    2,366,933 lbs.; in 1852, 2,112,133 lbs.\"\r\n\r\nA small quantity of pepper seems to be annually exported from Ceylon,\r\nwhich I presume is the growth of that island; thus there were:--\r\n\r\n   54 cwts. shipped in   1842\r\n   83  \"        \"        1843\r\n  102  \"        \"        1844\r\n\r\nIn the Customs' returns of Ceylon, it is classed with cardamoms, and\r\n160 to 170 cwt. of the two were shipped in each of the years 1850 and\r\n1851. Last year the quantity was smaller.\r\n\r\nPepper cultivation has been introduced into the Mauritius, and in 1839\r\nmore than 500,000 lbs. were imported from thence, but as the shipments\r\nhave since decreased, I presume it has given place to the more\r\nprofitable staple sugar. I have been able to glean no information as\r\nto the progress it has made in the West Indies. In Cayenne it has\r\nbeen successfully carried on for many years; and large shipments of\r\npepper have been made thence to France.\r\n\r\n            BLACK PEPPER EXPORTED FROM SINGAPORE.\r\n\r\n                               Piculs.

This voyage, which in\r\nour times can be performed in a month, most probably then took\r\neighteen. Transit and customs duties must have been paid over and over\r\nagain, and there must have been plenty of extortion. All this will\r\nexplain how pepper could not be sold in the Roman market under\r\nfifty-six times its prime cost. Immediately previous to the discovery\r\nof the route to India by the Cape of Good Hope, we find that the price\r\nof pepper in the markets of Europe had fallen to 6s a pound, or 3s.\r\n4d. less than in the time of Pliny. What probably contributed to this\r\nfall, was the superior skill in navigation of the now converted Arabs,\r\nand the extension of their commerce to the islands of the Eastern\r\nArchipelago, which abounded in pepper. After the great discovery of\r\nVasco de Gama, the price of pepper fell to about 1s. 3d. a pound, a\r\nfall of 8s. 1d. from that of the time of Pliny, and of 4s. 9d. from\r\nthat of the Mahommedan Arabs, Turks, and Venetians.\r\n\r\nIn 1826, 14,000,000 lbs. of pepper were imported into the United\r\nKingdom, of which about 5,500,000 were re-exported. In 1841,\r\n15,000,000 lbs. were imported, of which 6,500,000 were re-shipped to\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\nThe home consumption, it will be seen, now averages about 3,250,000\r\nlbs.:--\r\n\r\n              Imports        Home consumption\r\n                lbs.               lbs.\r\n  1845       9,852,984          3,209,718\r\n  1846       5,906,586          3,299,955\r\n  1847       4,669,930          2,966,022\r\n  1848       8,125,545          3,185,337\r\n  1849       4,796,042          3,257,911\r\n  1850       8,028,319          3,170,883\r\n  1851       3,996,496          3,303,403\r\n  1852       6,641,699          3,524,501\r\n\r\nThe following return shows the number of bags of pepper imported into\r\nthe United Kingdom, with the quantity retained for home consumption:--\r\n\r\n             Imports.

When this fruit is fresh, it\r\nhas a penetrating acrid smell; to the taste it is extremely pungent,\r\nand produces a most painful burning in the mouth. They are\r\noccasionally imported dry, and form the basis of Cayenne pepper; put\r\nin vinegar when green or ripe, they are an acceptable present in\r\nEurope. In Bengal the natives make an extract from the chillies, which\r\nis about the consistence and color of treacle.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of chillies in India is immense, as both rich and poor\r\ndaily use them, and it is the principal ingredient in all chutnies and\r\ncurries; ground into a paste, between two stones, with a little\r\nmustard, oil, ginger, and salt, it forms the only seasoning which the\r\nmillions of poor in that country can obtain to eat with their insipid\r\nrice. They are worth in the Bombay market about 40s. the candy of 600\r\nlbs.\r\n\r\nImmense quantities of the capsicum are used by the native population\r\nof the West Indies, Africa, and Mexico; the consumption as a condiment\r\nbeing almost universal, and perhaps equal in quantity to salt. Ten\r\nbarrels of these peppers were shipped from Montego Bay, Jamaica, in\r\nthe first six months of 1851.\r\n\r\nThe wholesale price of chillies in the London market is from 15s. to\r\n25s. the cwt., and there is a duty of 6d. per pound on them. Cayenne\r\nfetches 9d. to 2s. the pound.\r\n\r\nChilli is the Mexican name for all varieties of _Capsicum_. They are\r\nnatives of the East and West Indies, and other hot climates. _C.\r\nannuum_ is the species commonly noticed, but there seems to be\r\nnumerous varieties, which by many are reckoned species. Thus, _C.\r\nfrutescens_ is a shrubby plant, which, along with _C. minimum_,\r\nsupplies the variety called bird-pepper, it grows to a larger and more\r\nbushy size; _C. baccatum_ has a globular fruit, and furnishes cherry\r\nor berry capsicum. They are all of the simplest culture, and may even\r\nbe grown with very little care in England. Culture appears to increase\r\nthe size, but to diminish the pungency of the fruit. In capsicums\r\nirritant properties prevail so as to obscure the narcotic action.\r\nTheir acridity is owing to an oleaginous substance called capsicin.\r\nCayenne pepper is used in medicine chiefly in the form of tincture, as\r\na rubefacient and stimulant, especially in cases of ulcerated sore\r\nthroat. It acts on the stomach as an aromatic condiment, and when\r\npreserved in acetic acid it forms chilli vinegar.\r\n\r\nRed pepper may be considered one of the most useful vegetables in\r\nhygiene. As a stimulant and auxiliary in digestion it has been\r\nconsidered invaluable, especially in warm countries. A kind called the\r\ntobacco red pepper, is said to possess the most pungent properties of\r\nany of the species. It yields a small red pod, less than an inch in\r\nlength, and longitudinal in shape, which is so exceedingly hot that a\r\nsmall quantity of it is sufficient to season a large dish of any food.\r\nOwing to its oleaginous character, it has been found impossible to\r\npreserve it by drying, but by pouring strong boiling vinegar on it a\r\nsauce or decoction can be made, which possesses in a concentrated form\r\nall the essential qualities of the vegetable. A single drop of this\r\nsauce will flavor a whole plate of soup or other food.\r\n\r\nThe \"wort\" or Cayenne pottage may be termed the national dish of the\r\nAbyssinians, as that, or its basis \"dillock,\" is invariably eaten with\r\ntheir ordinary diet, the thin crumpet-like bread of teff or wheat\r\nflour. Equal parts of salt and the red cayenne pods are well powdered\r\nand mixed together with a little pea or bean meal to make a paste.\r\nThis is called \"dillock,\" and is made in quantities at a time, being\r\npreserved in a large gourd-shell, generally suspended from the roof.\r\nThe \"wort\" is merely a little water added to this paste, which is then\r\nboiled over the fire, with the addition of a little fat meat and more\r\nmeal to make a kind of porridge, to which sometimes is also added\r\nseveral warm seeds, such as the common cress or black mustard, both of\r\nwhich are indigenous in Abyssinia.--(\"Johnston's Abyssinia.\")\r\n\r\nA great quantity of Agi or Guinea pepper is grown in Peru, the natives\r\nbeing very fond of this condiment. It is not uncommon for an American\r\nIndian to make a meal of twenty or thirty pods of capsicum, a little\r\nsalt, and a piece of bread, washed down by two or three quarts of\r\nchica, the popular beverage.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIMENTO.\r\n\r\nThe pimento, _Eugenia Pimento_ (_Myrtus Pimenta_), is a native of\r\nMexico, and the West Indies. It flourishes spontaneously and in great\r\nabundance on the north side of the island of Jamaica; its numerous\r\nwhite blossoms mixing with the dark green foliage, and with the\r\nslightest breeze diffusing around the most delicious fragrance, give a\r\nbeauty and a charm to nature rarely equalled, and of which he who has\r\nnot visited the shady arbors and perfumed groves of the tropics can\r\nhave little conception. This lovely tree, the very leaf of which when\r\nbruised emits a fine aromatic odor, nearly as powerful as that of the\r\nspice itself, has been known to grow to the height of from 30 to 40\r\nfeet, exceedingly straight, and having for its base the spinous ridge\r\nof a rock, eight or ten feet above the surface of the hill or\r\nmountain. A single tree has frequently produced 150 lbs. of the raw,\r\nor 100 lbs. of the dried fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit has an aromatic odor, and its taste combines that of\r\ncinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves; hence its common name of allspice. The\r\nfruit of _Eugenia acris_ is used for pimento.\r\n\r\nThe trunk is of a grey color, smooth and shining, and altogether\r\ndestitute of bark. It is luxuriantly clothed with leaves of a deep\r\ngreen, somewhat like those of the bay tree, and these leaves are, in\r\nthe months of July and August, beautifully contrasted and relieved by\r\nan exuberance of white flowers. The leaves yield by distillation a\r\ndelicate odoriferous oil, which is said to be sometimes passed off for\r\noil of cloves.\r\n\r\nThe berries are gathered before they are ripe, and spread on a\r\nterrace, exposed to the sun for about a week, during which time they\r\nlose their green color, and acquire that reddish brown tint which\r\nrenders them marketable. Some planters kiln-dry them. Like many of the\r\nminor productions of the tropics, pimento is exceedingly uncertain,\r\nand perhaps a very plenteous crop occurs but once in five years.\r\n\r\nIn 1800 there were 12,759 bags and 610 casks of pimento imported from\r\nJamaica; in 1824 there were 33,308 bags and 599 casks shipped from the\r\nisland; in 1829 the quantity exported was 6,069,127 lbs.\r\n\r\nIn the year ending October 1843, the export of pimento from Jamaica\r\nwas 29,322 bags and 156 casks; in the year ending October 1844, 12,055\r\nbags and 88 casks; in the year ending October 1845, 233 casks, valued\r\nat 30s. each, and 59,494 bags, valued at 20s.\r\n\r\nFrom 1st January to 1st August, 1851, 128,277 lbs. pimento were\r\nshipped from the port of Montego Bay, Jamaica.\r\n\r\nThere was a very considerable pimento plantation made in Tobago, some\r\nyears ago, by a Mr. Franklin, but it was abandoned by his sons, that\r\nthey might attend the more exclusively to sugar culture.\r\n\r\nJamaica exported nearly two millions of pounds of pimento less, in\r\nthe three years ending 1848, than she did in the three previous to the\r\nemancipation of the slaves. The number of pounds shipped annually, in\r\nthese periods, is shown by the following figures:--\r\n\r\n  Year.         lbs.\r\n  1830       5,560,620\r\n  1831       3,172,320\r\n  1832       4,024,800\r\n  1846       2,997,060\r\n  1847       2,800,140\r\n  1848       5,231,908\r\n\r\nPimento is imported into this country in bags of about 100 lbs. each.\r\nThe imports have been:--\r\n\r\n  Year.

The duty is\r\n5s. per cwt.\r\n\r\n\r\nVANILLA.\r\n\r\nThe fleshy, pod-like, odoriferous fruit of different species of\r\n_Epidendrum_ constitute the substance called vanilla, which is used in\r\nconfectionery for giving a delicious perfume to chocolate, liqueurs,\r\n&c. As an aromatic it is much sought after by confectioners, for\r\nflavoring ices and creams; and also by perfumers, liqueurists, and\r\ndistillers. The best comes from the forests round the village of\r\nZurtila, in the intendancy of Oaxaca, on the eastern slopes of the\r\nCordillera of Anahuac, between the parallels of 19 deg. and 20 deg. N.\r\nAll the vanilla which is used in Europe is imported from Mexico,\r\nVenezuela, and Vera Cruz.\r\n\r\nIt is a native of tropical America, and grows wild in Brazil, Peru,\r\nthe banks of the Orinoco, and all places where heat, shade, and\r\nmoisture prevail. There are many species indigenous to the Bahamas,\r\nTrinidad, Jamaica, Cuba, Dominica, Martinique and St. Vincent, which\r\nwould produce considerable gain to the inhabitants if they would give\r\nthemselves the trouble of cultivating or collecting its fruit.\r\n\r\nThis parasitical plant has a trailing stem, not unlike the common ivy,\r\nbut not so woody, by which it attaches itself to the trunks of trees,\r\nand sucks the moisture which their bark derives from the lichens and\r\nother cryptogamia, but without drawing nourishment from the tree\r\nitself, like the misletoe and loranthus. The Indians in Mexico\r\npropagate it by planting cuttings at the foot of trees selected for\r\nthat purpose. It rises to the height of 18 or 20 feet; the flowers are\r\nof a greenish yellow, mixed with white. The plant is subcylindrical\r\nabout eight or ten inches long, of a yellow color when gathered, but\r\ndark brown or black when imported into Europe. It is one-celled\r\nsiliquose, and pulpy within, wrinkled on the outside, and full of a\r\nvast number of seeds like grains of sand, having when properly\r\nprepared, a peculiar and delicious fragrance. It should be gathered\r\nbefore it is fully ripe.\r\n\r\nDifferent species of vanilla are natives of Guiana, and it is found in\r\nlarge quantities along the banks of its rivers, and in the wooded\r\ndistricts which intersperse the savannahs. The oily and balsamic\r\nsubstance which the minute seeds possess, may be found to have\r\nmedicinal qualities. Its cultivation can be connected with no\r\ndifficulties; it needs only to plant the slips among trees, and to\r\nkeep them clear of weeds. It would prove therefore a great addition to\r\na cocoa plantation. In 1825 the price was, in Germany, sixty-six\r\ndollars (equal to £9) per pound, and twenty-five to thirty dollars are\r\npaid for it in Martinique.\r\n\r\nHumboldt states that the annual value of vanilla exported from the\r\nstate of Vera Cruz was 40,000 dollars, £8,000 sterling. Some vanilla\r\nis exported from Maranham. The cultivation of vanilla, which was\r\nintroduced into Java in the year 1847, is said to have made\r\nconsiderable progress, there being now no fewer than thirty\r\nplantations.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of this orchideous plant is entirely neglected in the\r\nprovince of Caracas, though abundant crops of it might be gathered on\r\nthe humid coast between Porto Cabello and Ocumare, especially at\r\nTuriamo, where the pods attain the length of nearly a foot. The\r\nEnglish and American merchants often seek to make purchases at the\r\nport of La Guayra, but with difficulty procure it in small quantities.\r\n\r\nIn the valleys that descend from the chain of coast towards the\r\nCaribbean sea, in the province of Truxillo, as well as in the mission\r\nof Guiana, near the cataracts of the Orinoco, a great quantity of the\r\nvanilla pods might be collected, the produce of which would be still\r\nmore abundant, if, according to the practice of the Mexicans, the\r\nplant were disentangled from time to time from the other creepers,\r\nwith which it is intertwined and stifled.\r\n\r\nWhen collected to prepare it for the market, about 12,000 of the pods\r\nare strung like a garland by their lower end, as near as possible to\r\ntheir foot-stalk; the whole are plunged for an instant into boiling\r\nwater to blanch them; they are then hung up in the open air and\r\nexposed to the sun for a few hours. By some they are wrapped in\r\nwoollen cloths to sweat. Next day they are lightly smeared with oil,\r\nby means of a feather or the fingers, and are surrounded with oiled\r\ncotton to prevent the valves from opening. As they become dry, on\r\ninverting their upper end they discharge a viscid liquor from it, and\r\nthey are pressed several times with oiled fingers to promote its flow.\r\nThe dried pods, like the berries of pepper, change color under the\r\ndrying operation, grow brown, wrinkled, soft, and shrink to one-fourth\r\nof their original size. In this state they are touched a second time\r\nwith oil, but very sparingly, because with too much oil they would\r\nlose some of their delicious perfume.\r\n\r\nThey are then packed for the market in small bundles of 50 or 100 in\r\neach, enclosed in lead foil, or tight metallic cases.\r\n\r\nThere are four local varieties, all differing in price and excellence;\r\nviz., the vanilla _fina_, the _zacate_, the _rezacate_, and the\r\n_vasura_.\r\n\r\nOne pod of vanilla is sufficient to perfume a pound and a half of\r\ncacao. It is with difficulty reduced to fine particles, but it may be\r\nsufficiently attenuated by cutting it into small bits, and grinding\r\nthese along with sugar.\r\n\r\nAs it comes to us, vanilla is a capsular fruit, of the thickness of a\r\nswan's quill; straight, cylindrical, but somewhat flattened, truncated\r\nat the top, thinned off at the ends, glistening, wrinkled, furrowed\r\nlengthwise, flexible, from five to ten inches long, and of a reddish\r\nbrown color. It contains a pulpy parenchyma, soft, unctuous, very\r\nbrown, in which are embedded black, brilliant, very small seeds.\r\n\r\nThe kind most esteemed in France is called _leq_ vanilla; it is about\r\nsix inches long, from one-fourth to one-third of an inch broad,\r\nnarrowed at the two ends and curved at the base; somewhat soft and\r\nviscid, of a dark reddish color, and of a most delicious flavor, like\r\nthat of balsam of Peru. It is called vanilla _giorees_, when it is\r\ncovered with efflorescences of benzcoin acid, after having been kept\r\nin a dry place, and in vessels not hermetically closed.\r\n\r\nThe second sort, called _vanilla simarona_, or bastard, is a little\r\nsmaller than the preceding, of a less deep brown hue, drier, less\r\naromatic, destitute of efflorescence. It is said to be the produce of\r\nthe wild plant, and is brought from St. Domingo.\r\n\r\nA third sort, which comes from Brazil, is the _vanillon_, or large\r\nvanilla of the French market; the _vanilla pamprona_ or _bova_ of the\r\nSpaniards. Its length is from five to six inches, its breadth from\r\none-half to three-fourths of an inch. It is brown, soft, viscid,\r\nalmost always open, of a strong smell, but less agreeable than the\r\n_leq_. It is sometimes a little spoiled by an incipient fermentation.\r\nIt is cured with sugar, and enclosed in tin plate boxes, which contain\r\nfrom 20 to 60 pods[52]. The average annual import of vanilla into\r\nHavre, in the five years ending 1841, was about 16 boxes; in 1842 it\r\nwas 30 packages.\r\n\r\nTONQUIN BEANS.--The seeds of the Tongo tree (_Dipterix odorata_), a\r\nnative of Guiana, are the well-known tonquin beans used to give a\r\npleasant flavor to snuff.\r\n\r\n\r\nTURMERIC.\r\n\r\nThis article of commerce is furnished by the branches of the rhizome\r\nor root-stock of the _Curcuma longa_, and _C. rotunda_, plants which\r\nare natives of Eastern Asia, but have been grown in England and the\r\nWest Indies. They thrive well in a rich light soil, and are readily\r\nincreased by offsets from the roots.\r\n\r\nIn the East Indies, where it is known as Huldee, turmeric is much\r\nemployed in dyeing yellow, principally silks, but the color is very\r\nfugitive. It is also used medicinally as an aromatic carminative, and\r\nas a condiment; it enters into the composition of curry sauce or\r\npowder, and many other articles of Indian cookery. It is cordial and\r\nstomachic, and considered by the native doctors of India an excellent\r\napplication in powder for cleansing foul ulcers.\r\n\r\nIt is grown in, and exported chiefly from, Bengal and Malabar, Madras,\r\nJava, and China. The turmeric of Java is in high estimation in the\r\nEuropean markets, ranking next to that of China, and being much\r\nsuperior to that of Bengal. The seeds of _Anethum Sowa_, from their\r\ncarminative properties, form an ingredient in curry powder.\r\n\r\nThe price of turmeric in London is from 12s. to 20s. per cwt.,\r\naccording to quality. The entries for home consumption are about 4,000\r\nto 5,000 cwts. annually. It is better shipped in casks or cases than\r\nin bags.\r\n\r\nA kind of arrowroot is prepared from _C. angustifolia_, another\r\nspecies of this tribe of plants.\r\n\r\n_Amaranthus gangiticus_, and another species, are much cultivated by\r\nthe Hindoos for their stews and curries.\r\n\r\nThe quantity and value of the curry stuff imported into Ceylon,\r\nchiefly from India, has been in the last few years as follows:--\r\n\r\n              Quantity.\r\n  Years.      cwts.  packages.     Value.\r\n   1847                            6,866\r\n   1848                            9,981\r\n   1849      26,347     109        9,664\r\n   1850      24,396     300        7,267\r\n   1851      32,550                9,446\r\n   1852                            9,039\r\n\r\nWhat is comprised under the term \"curry stuff,\" I am not aware, but\r\nit appears to be a bulky article, for it was imported to the extent of\r\n32,000 cwt. in 1852.\r\n\r\nThere are two varieties of turmeric usually sent into Europe from the\r\nEast (whence all the turmeric imported into Europe is obtained), the\r\n\"long\" turmeric (_Curcuma longa_), and the \"round,\" or as it is better\r\nknown the \"Chinese turmeric.\" The latter description is very rare, the\r\nformer is the common article of commerce. According to one of my\r\ncorrespondents, Mr. Hepburn, chemist, of Falmouth, Jamaica, the common\r\nor long turmeric is indigenous to that island, growing luxuriantly in\r\nthe mountainous districts, in rather damp soils, its locality being in\r\nthe vicinity of rivers, water-courses and springs. In this respect it\r\ndiffers from ginger, which requires a rather dry soil for its culture.\r\nI am not aware that this plant possesses the property of impoverishing\r\nthe soil like the ginger. From the general habits of the plant in its\r\nnatural state, we may gather the following rules for our guidance in\r\nits culture. The plants should be laid down in rows of five or six\r\ninches distant from each other, in a soil moderately damp, of an\r\naluminous or clayey nature, and free to a great extent of the more\r\nsoluble alkalies, potash and soda, as these, by absorption, may\r\ndestroy the coloring matter of the plant, and so diminish its value as\r\na dye-stuff. Finally, in preparing the roots for exportation, they\r\nshould be cleansed from all earthy particles, exposed for drying in\r\nthe shade, and without any further preparation bagged for shipment.\r\n\r\nThe coloring matter of turmeric is of an orange yellow color\r\nexceedingly delicate and capable of change, either from the action of\r\nlight or of alkalies, which turn it to a dark brown color. It is\r\nslightly soluble in water, and readily soluble in an alkaline\r\nsolution, becoming dark brown. Alcohol extracts the coloring matter.\r\nThe uses to which turmeric is applied are two: as an ingredient in the\r\ncurry powder and paste, and as a dye for silk. It was some time ago\r\nused as a medicine; but though retained in the \"Pharmacopoeias\" of the\r\npresent day, it is entirely discarded by the practitioner as a\r\ncurative agent. The best Bengal and Malabar turmeric fetches a price\r\nnearly as high as that of ginger, and I see no reason why the West\r\nIndia planter could not send it into the British market quite as cheap\r\nas the East India trader. According to Dallas, 397 bags of turmeric\r\nwere exported from Jamaica in 1797.\r\n\r\nTurmeric is grown about the city of Patna and Behar. It is much\r\ncultivated about Calcutta and all parts of Bengal. One acre yields\r\nabout 2,000 lbs. of the fresh root. It is also grown on the central\r\ntable land of Afghanistan. The exports from Calcutta in 1841 were\r\n11,000 Indian maunds, and 28,137 in 1842. The value of that exported\r\nfrom Madras in 1839 was 40,000 rupees, or £4,000; in 1840, £4,200. The\r\nquantity shipped from that Presidency in 1850 was 6,877 bags.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Dacca about 200 lbs. of seed is sown to the\r\nbeegah, measuring 80 cubits by 80, and the yield is from 640 to 800\r\nlbs.\r\n\r\n140 tons were imported into Liverpool in 1849, for dyeing and for\r\ncurries; 414 tons in 1850; 11,554 bags and packages in 1851; and only\r\n3,595 ditto in 1852. The price in January 1853 was, for Bengal, 10s.\r\nto 12s.; China, 12s. to 14s., and Malabar 9s. to 12s. the cwt. The\r\nimports into London were 18 tons in 1848, 191 in 1849, and 980 in\r\n1850. The deliveries for consumption, 192 tons in 1848, 270 in 1849,\r\nand 870 tons in 1850.\r\n\r\nIn China turmeric is used with Prussian blue in coloring and facing\r\ntea.\r\n\r\n\r\nGINSENG\r\n\r\nThe produce of this plant, as an article of commerce, is confined to\r\nour transatlantic neighbours, who have the monopoly of the supply to\r\nChina.\r\n\r\nThe root of _Panax quinquefolium_, the American ginseng, is much\r\nesteemed by the Chinese, for certain supposed beneficial effects upon\r\nthe nerves, and for other presumed virtues; but our physicians have\r\nnot discovered any proofs of its efficacy in Europe. The plant is an\r\nherbaceous perennial, growing upon the confines of Tartary and China,\r\nnear the great wall. It is found wild, flourishing in moist\r\nsituations, and attains the height of from two to three feet; it is\r\nalso now produced largely in the northern, middle, and western States\r\nof the Union, particularly Virginia, Louisiana, and Pennsylvania, and\r\na considerable trade is carried on with it to China. A variety of the\r\nplant was discovered, a few years ago, in the Himalaya mountains, and\r\nsmall quantities have been thence sent to Canton. It is also found\r\ngrowing in Canada. The root is about three or four inches in length,\r\nand one inch in thickness. It resembles a small carrot, but not so\r\ntaper at the end, and is sometimes single, sometimes divided into two\r\nbranches. The stem is striated, without branches, and of a red color\r\nnear the root. The leaves, from four to six of which surround the stem\r\nwhere they form sheaths (bracteal), are simply pinnate. The flower\r\nstalk is long and green, the inflorescence a simple umbel. The fruit\r\nis a berry of a red color, and contains two seeds of the size of\r\nmustard seed. The officinal root differs in appearance, according to\r\nthe country from which it is brought. In Korea and China it is white,\r\ncorrugated when dry, and covered with a powder resembling starch. In\r\nMandscharia and Dauria it is yellow, smooth and transparent, and when\r\ncut resembles amber. The taste of the root is bitter. Crude ginseng\r\nnow sells in the Canton market at 70 to 80 dollars per picul of 133\r\nlbs., and cured or clarified root at 130 to 140 dollars.\r\n\r\nThe stem of the plant, which is renewed every year, leaves, as it\r\nfalls off, an impression upon the neck of the root, so that the number\r\nof these rings or marks indicates the age of the plant, and the value\r\nof the root increases accordingly. The Chinese government were\r\nformerly in the habit of sending out annually 30,000 Tartar soldiers\r\nto search for the plant, and each was obliged to bring home two ounces\r\nof the root gratis, and for all above that quantity he was paid its\r\nweight in silver. The Asiatic ginseng is said to be obtained from the\r\nroot of _P. Schinseng_ of Nees von Esenbeck, _P. Pseudo ginseng_ of\r\nWallich. This root might be procured in Prince Edward's Island and\r\nsome of the other British North American colonies.\r\n\r\nI have been able to trace, after some labor and research, the\r\nprogressive exports of this curious article of trade from the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIn 1790, 813 casks, of the value of 47,025 dollars, were exported; and\r\nin 1791, 29,208 lbs. From 1803 to 1807, the annual value of ginseng\r\nshipped was about 123,000 dollars, and from 1820 to 1830, it averaged\r\n157,000 dollars.\r\n\r\nThe following figures show the value of the article in subsequent\r\nyears:--1831, 115,921 dollars; year ending 30th September, 1835,\r\n94,960 dollars; 1837, 212,899 lbs., valued at 108,548 dollars; 1840,\r\n22,728 dollars; 1841, 437,245 dollars.\r\n\r\nThe quantity shipped in 1839, from Philadelphia alone, was 317,443\r\nlbs. In 1841, 637,885 lbs. were exported from the United States.\r\n\r\nThe value of that exported in the years ending 30th June, was 1844,\r\n95,008 in dollars, and in 1845, 117,146 dollars; 110,000 lbs. were\r\ncollected at Toledo, Ohio, in 1845. The value of the exports in the\r\nfollowing years, ending June 30th, were--1847, 64,466 dollars; 1849,\r\n162,640; 1849, 182,966; 1850, 122,916 dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORIANDER, CARRAWAY, AND OTHER SEEDS.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of anise, carraway, coriander, &c., (erroneously called\r\nseeds,) are in demand for various purposes.\r\n\r\nCARRAWAY SEED is imported to the extent of 500 tons annually from\r\nGermany and Holland, the price being about 33s. per cwt. It is also\r\nnow much grown in Essex and Kent. In the years 1848 and 1849, 7,000\r\ncwt. of this seed was imported, of which nearly the whole quantity was\r\nretained for home consumption.\r\n\r\nCORIANDER SEED is chiefly used by distillers, to produce an aromatic\r\noil. The quantity imported annually does not exceed 50 tons, and it is\r\nbrought principally to the port of Hull. It is also cultivated in\r\nSuffolk, Essex and Kent.\r\n\r\nOf MUSTARD SEED the aggregate quantity imported annually is about\r\n2,000 tons for home consumption, and the flour is used as a well-known\r\ncondiment to food, &c., and in medicine; the average price being about\r\n9d. per pound.\r\n\r\nANISE.--The fruit of _Pimpinilla anisum_, under the name of aniseed,\r\nis principally imported from Alicant and Germany (the first is\r\npreferred), but some is also brought from the East Indies. It is an\r\nannual plant, largely cultivated in Spain, Malta, and various parts of\r\nGermany, and also in the island of Scio, Egypt, and parts of Asia. The\r\nimports are not large; 192 cwts. paid duty in 1833, and 315 cwts. in\r\n1840. About 60 cwts. are annually received at Hull from Germany. It is\r\nused to flavor liqueurs, sweetmeats, and confectionery of various\r\nkinds. Oil of aniseed is obtained by distillation from the fruit, and\r\n1,544 lbs. were imported in 1839. About two pounds of oil are obtained\r\nfrom one hundred-weight of seed.\r\n\r\nSTAR ANISE, _Illicum anisatum_, is a native of the countries extending\r\nfrom 23½ deg. to 35 deg. of north latitude, or from Canton to Japan.\r\nThe capsules constitute in India a rather important article of\r\ncommerce, and are sold in all the bazaars. Large quantities are also\r\nused in Europe in the preparation of liqueurs. 695 piculs of star\r\naniseed were exported from Canton in 1850, valued at 8,200 Spanish\r\ndollars. 81 piculs of oil of aniseed were exported from Canton in\r\n1845, and 105 piculs in 1850, valued at 11,900 dollars. 3,000 piculs\r\nof aniseed are exported annually from Cambodia.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUTCHUK, OR COSTUS.\r\n\r\nThe substance called costus was highly prized by the ancients, and\r\nspecimens may be met with at a few of the London drug-houses. It has\r\nbeen shown by Dr. Falconer to be the produce of a genus of the thistle\r\ntribe, to which he has given the name of _Aucklandia_. The root of _A.\r\nCostus_ is supposed to be the _Costus Arabicus_, on the following\r\ngrounds:--It corresponds with the descriptions given by the ancient\r\nauthors, and is used at the present day for the same purposes in\r\nChina, as costus was formerly applied to by the Greeks. The\r\ncoincidence of the names--in Cashmere the root is called koot, and the\r\nArabic synonym is said to be _koost_. It grows in immense abundance on\r\nthe mountains which surround Cashmere. It is a gregarious herb, about\r\nsix or seven feet high, with a perennial thick branched root, with an\r\nannual round smooth stem, large leaves and dark purple flowers. The\r\nroots are dug up in the months of September and October, when the\r\nplant begins to be torpid; they are chopped up into pieces, from two\r\nto six inches long, and are exported without further preparation. The\r\nquantity collected, according to Dr. Falconer, is very large,\r\namounting to about two million pounds per annum. The cost of its\r\ncollection and transport to a mercantile depot in Cashmere, is about\r\n2s. 4d. the cwt. The commodity is laden on bullocks and exported to\r\nthe Punjaub, whence the larger portion goes down to Bombay, where it\r\nis shipped for the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, and China; a portion of\r\nit finds its way across the Sutlej and Jumna into Hindostan Proper,\r\nwhence it is taken to Calcutta, and bought up there with avidity under\r\nthe name of putchuk. The value is enhanced at Jugadree, on the Jumna,\r\nto about 16s. 9d. or 23s. 4d. per cwt. In the Chinese ports it\r\nfetches nearly double that price the cwt. The Chinese burn the roots\r\nas an incense in the temples of their gods, and they also attach great\r\nefficacy to it as an aphrodisiac. The imports into Canton in 1848 were\r\n414 piculs; in 1850, 854 piculs; valued at 5,150 dollars. In Cashmere\r\nit is chiefly used for the protection of bales of shawls from insects.\r\nThe exports from the port of Calcutta were, in 1840-41, 19,660 maunds;\r\nin 1841-42, 12,847; in 1847-48, 2,050¼; in 1848-49, 2,110¾;--worth\r\nabout £1,500 annually.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of amboyna wood, the odoriferous sandal wood from Timor,\r\nclove wood, and other choice woods from the Moluccas and Prince of\r\nWales Island, were sent home to the Great Exhibition in 1851.\r\n\r\nLIGNUM ALOES, the eagle wood and Calambak of commerce, yielding an\r\naromatic perfume, is furnished by the _Aquilaria malaccensis_, and\r\n_agallocha_, in Silhet, an ornamental evergreen shrub. A very high\r\nartificial value is placed on the better qualities of this product by\r\nthe natives of the East; the best quality being worth about £14 the\r\npicul of 133 lbs.\r\n\r\nThis fragrant wood is probably the lign aloes of the Bible.\r\n\r\nIncense to the value of nearly one million and a quarter francs was\r\nexported from Alexandria in 1837.\r\n\r\nCalambak or eagle wood, the true lignum aloes so highly esteemed in\r\nthe East as a perfume or incense, is said to be produced by the\r\n_Aloexylum agallochum_, Lour. This remarkable wood contains a large\r\nquantity of an odoriferous oleo-resin; when heated it undergoes a sort\r\nof imperfect fusion, and exhales a fragrant and very agreeable odor.\r\nIts price in Sumatra is about £30 per cwt. Inferior specimens are\r\nobtained at Malacca. Eagle wood is also obtained from several other\r\ntrees. The true eagle wood is however very scarce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.\r\n\r\nDYES AND COLORING STUFFS, AND TANNING SUBSTANCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the several classes of materials collected at the Industrial\r\nExhibition in Hyde Park, in 1851, few possessed so much importance in\r\nthe eyes of the textile and leather manufacturer and chemist as the\r\ndifferent products used in the arts and manufactures for coloring and\r\ntanning purposes. These were in a great measure lost sight of by the\r\npublic at large, being scattered about in small quantities in a great\r\nnumber of directions; and, from the minute samples shown, were in many\r\ninstances overlooked altogether. Besides furnishing some novel and\r\ngeneral statistical facts, which may prove interesting, I propose also\r\nin this section to draw attention more prominently to some of these\r\nproducts, which are at present little known or appreciated.\r\n\r\nColoring substances for staining and dyeing are obtained indifferently\r\nfrom the animal, mineral, and vegetable kingdoms, but it is of the\r\nlast alone that I shall have to speak. The importance of a more\r\ncareful consideration of this subject will be admitted, if we consider\r\nhow much the prosperity and extent of our cotton, silk, woollen, and\r\nleather manufactures depends on a liberal and cheap supply of dyes and\r\ntannin, to give beauty and color to the fabrics, and substance and\r\nutility to the skins. Even oil colors, for painters' purposes, which\r\ndo not come within the scope of my remarks, form an item in our yearly\r\nexports of the value of £250,000, and when we calculate the large\r\namount of cotton, silk and wool worked up, most of which requires\r\nvarious coloring agents, gums, starches, and mordants;--that nearly\r\n30,000 tons of hides are annually imported, exclusive of those\r\nobtained from our now slaughter-houses, besides goat, seal, and other\r\nskins--and that the exports of our various manufactures of cotton,\r\nlinen, silk, wool and leather in 1852, setting aside our home\r\nconsumption, amounted to nearly fifty millions sterling, we shall be\r\nable to form a better estimate of the importance of the various\r\nsubjects we are about to notice.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain does not pay less than £600,000 annually for the dried\r\ncarcasses of the tiny cochineal insect, while the produce of another\r\nsmall insect, that which produces the lac dye, is scarcely less\r\nvaluable. Then there are the gall nuts used for dyeing and making\r\nblack ink. Upwards of £3,000,000 is paid for barks of various kinds\r\nfor tanners' purposes, about one million for other tanning substances\r\nand heavy dye woods, besides about £200,000 for various extracts of\r\ntannin, such as Gambier, Cutch, Divi-divi, and Kino. The aggregate\r\nvalue of the dye stuffs and gum it is difficult to estimate.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful specimens of materials imported from China, India, New\r\nZealand, the Continent, and other countries, and exhibited at the\r\nCrystal Palace, proves to us that we have yet much to learn from other\r\nnations in the art of fixing colors and obtaining brilliant dyes. The\r\nFrench are much our superiors in dyeing and the production of fast and\r\nbeautiful colors. Their chemical researches and investigations are\r\ncarried out more systematically and effectively than our own. Russia\r\nimports dyewoods and dye-stuffs to the value of five millions and a\r\nhalf of silver roubles annually.\r\n\r\nIt was well observed by the Jury Reporters at the Great Exhibition,\r\nthat \"a vast number of new coloring materials have been discovered or\r\nmade available, and improved modes have been devised of economically\r\napplying those already in use; so that the dyer of the present time\r\nemploys many substances of the very existence of which his practical\r\npredecessors were wholly ignorant. From the increased use of many of\r\nthe vegetable colors, and from the improved modes of applying the\r\ncoloring matters, a demand has naturally sprung up for various dye\r\nstuffs; and at the present time, many of the dyeing materials of\r\ndistant countries are beginning to excite the attention of practical\r\nmen; for though they have been acquainted with many of these\r\nsubstances, it is only recently that the progress of the art has\r\nrendered their use desirable or even practicable.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be quite impossible, within the limits which I have assigned\r\nmyself, to make even a bare enumeration of the various plants and\r\ntrees from which coloring substances and dye stuffs can be obtained, I\r\nmust, therefore, be content to specify only a few.\r\n\r\nThe roots of some species of Lithospermum afford a lac for dyeing and\r\npainting. Dried pomegranates are said to be used in Tunis for dyeing\r\nyellow; the rind is also a tanning substance.\r\n\r\nSir John Franklin tells us that the Crees extract some beautiful\r\ncolors from several of their native vegetables. They dye a beautiful\r\nscarlet with the roots of two species of bed-straw, _Galium\r\ntinctorium_ and _boreale_. They dye black, with an ink made of elder\r\nbark and a little bog-iron ore dried and powdered, and they have\r\nvarious modes of producing yellow. They employ the dried roots of the\r\ncowbane (_Cicuta virosa_), the bruised buds of the Dutch myrtle, and\r\nhave discovered methods of dyeing with various lichens.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Comptes Rendus,\" xxxv., p. 558, there is an account by M.J.\r\nPersoz, of a green coloring matter from China, of great stability,\r\nfrom which it appears that the Chinese possess a coloring substance\r\nhaving the appearance of indigo, which communicates a beautiful and\r\npermanent sea green color to mordants of alumina and iron, and which\r\nis not a preparation of indigo, or any derivative of this dyeing\r\nprincipal. As furnished to M. Persoz by Mr. Forbes, the American\r\nconsul at Canton, it was in thin plates of a blue color, resembling\r\nJapanese indigo, but of a finer grain, differing also from indigo in\r\nits composition and chemical properties. On infusing a very small\r\nquantity of it in water, this fluid soon acquired a deep blue color\r\nwith a greenish tinge; upon boiling and immersing a piece of calico on\r\nwhich the mordants of iron and alumina had been printed, it was dyed a\r\nsea green color of greater or less intensity according to the strength\r\nof the mordant--the portions not coated remaining white.\r\n\r\nA berry called _Makleua_ grows on a large forest tree at Bankok, which\r\nis used most extensively by the Siamese as a vegetable black dye. It\r\nis merely bruised in water, when a fermentation takes place, and the\r\narticle to be dyed is steeped in the liquid and then spread out in the\r\nsun to dry. The berry, when fresh, is of a fine green color, but after\r\nbeing gathered for two or three days it becomes quite black and\r\nshrivelled like pepper. It must be used fresh, and whilst its mixture\r\nwith water produces fermentation. The bark of _Datisca cannabina_ also\r\ndyes yellow. It contains a bitter principle, like quassia.\r\n\r\nA coloring matter is prepared from the dried fruit of the _Rottlera\r\ntinctoria_, by the natives of the East, to dye orange, which is a\r\nbrilliant and tolerably permanent dye. It is apparently of a resinous\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nA small quantity of Alkanet root (_Anchusa tinctoria_), is imported\r\nfrom the Levant and the south of France, and is used to color gun\r\nstocks, furniture, &c., of a deep red mahogany and rosewood color. It\r\nis brought over in packages weighing about two cwt., the price being\r\n40s. or 50s. per cwt.\r\n\r\nTurmeric is now imported to the extent of upwards of 800 tons, a\r\nportion of this is used in dyeing. The culture and commerce has been\r\nalready noticed in Section III.\r\n\r\nThe bark and roots of the berberry are used in the East to dye yellow;\r\nthe color is best when boiled in ley. Some of the species of\r\nSymplocos, as _S. racemosa_, known as lodh about the Himalaya\r\nmountains, and _S. tinctoria_, a native of Carolina, are used for\r\ndyeing. The scarlet flowers of _Butea frondosa_ (the Dhaktree), and\r\n_B. superba_, natives of the Indian jungles, yield a beautiful dye,\r\nand furnishing a species of kino (_Pulas kino_), are also used for\r\ntanning. _Althea rosea_, the parent of the many beautiful varieties of\r\nhollyhock, a native of China, yields a blue coloring matter equal to\r\nindigo. Indigo of an excellent quality has been obtained in the East\r\nfrom a twining plant, _Gymnema tingens_ or _Asclepias tingens_.\r\n\r\nThe juice of the unripe fruit of _Rhamnus infectorius_, _catharticus_\r\nand _virigatius_, known as Turkey or French berries, is used for\r\ndyeing leather yellow. When mixed with lime and evaporated to\r\ndryness, it forms the color called sap-green. A great quantity of\r\nyellow berries are annually shipped from Constantinople; 115 tons were\r\nimported into Liverpool last year. The average annual imports into the\r\nUnited Kingdom are about 450 tons. They come from the Levant in hair\r\nbales weighing three and a quarter cwt., or in tierces of four to five\r\ncwt., and are used by calico printers for dyeing a yellow color. They\r\nare sometimes called Persian berries.\r\n\r\nIt is a subject of surprise that the common betel-nut of the East has\r\nnever been introduced for dyeing purposes. The roots of the awl tree\r\nof Malabar and other parts of India, _Morinda citrifolia_, and of _M.\r\ntinctoria_, found abundant in all the Asiatic islands, are extensively\r\nused as a dye stuff for giving a red color. It is usually grown as a\r\nprop and shade for the pepper vine and coffee tree. The coloring\r\nmatter resides principally in the bark of the roots, which are long\r\nand slender, and the small pieces are the best, fetching 8s. to 10s. a\r\nmaund. It is exported in large quantities from Malabar to Guzerat, and\r\nthe northern parts of Hindostan, but seldom finds its way to Europe.\r\n\r\nThe wood and roots of another species, _M. umbellata_, known in the\r\neastern islands as \"Mangkudu,\" are used extensively for their red dye,\r\nin Celebes and Java. Specimens of all these, and of the Lopisip bark,\r\nbunchong bulu wood, and the gaju gum (from undescribed plants), have\r\nbeen introduced into England. They are said to furnish excellent dyes\r\nin the Asiatic islands. Native dyes from Arracan have also been\r\nimported, viz., thit-tel and the-dan yielding red dyes, ting-nget and\r\nreros, affording dark purple dyes; and thit-nan-weng, a chocolate dye.\r\nThese would be worth enquiry, and particulars of the plants yielding\r\nthem, the quantities available, and the prices might be procured. Dyes\r\nand colors from the following plants are obtained in India: several\r\nspecies of _Terminalia_, _Sinecarpus Anacardium_, _Myrica Sapide_,\r\n_Nelumbium speciosus_, _Butea frondosa_, and _Nyctanthes\r\narboretristis_. The bunkita barring, obtained from an undescribed\r\nplant in Borneo, produces a dark purple or black dye. A species of\r\nruellia, under the name of \"Room,\" is employed in its raw state by the\r\nKhamptis and Lingphos to dye their clothes of a deep blue. It is\r\ndescribed by the late Dr. Griffiths as \"a valuable dye, and highly\r\nworthy of attention.\" It might, perhaps, be usefully employed as the\r\nground for a black dye. In Nepaul they use the bark of _Photinia\r\ndubia_ or _Mespilus Bengalensis_ for dyeing scarlet. The bark of the\r\nblack oak, _Quercus tinctoria_ and its varieties, natives of North\r\nAmerica, are used by dyers under the name of quercitron.\r\n\r\nIn the south of Europe, _Daphne Gnidium_ is used to dye yellow. The\r\nroot of reilbon, a sort of madder in Chili, dyes red. A purple tint or\r\ndye is obtained from the bark of an undescribed tree, known under the\r\nname of \"_Grana ponciana_,\" growing about Quito; and Stevenson\r\n(Travels in South America) says, \"if known in Europe, it would\r\nundoubtedly become an article of commerce.\" Another much more\r\nexpensive species of coloring matter (red) is obtained in various\r\nparts of South America from the leaves of the _Bignonia Chica_, a\r\nclimbing evergreen shrub, native of the Orinoco country, with large\r\nhandsome panicles of flowers. The coloring substance is obtained by\r\ndecoction, which deposits, when cool, a red matter; this is formed\r\ninto cakes and dried. Dr. Ure thinks it might probably be turned to\r\naccount in the arts of civilization. The order of plants to which it\r\nbelongs, contains a vast number of species, all natives of tropical\r\nregions, and their value for the production of coloring substances may\r\nbe worth investigation.\r\n\r\nIt is met with in British Guiana, and the Indian tribes of that\r\ndistrict prepare the pigment with which they stain their skin from it;\r\nit is called by them \"Caraveru.\" The coloring matter is used as a dye\r\nin the United States, and for artistical purposes would rival madder.\r\nSir Robert Schomburgk thinks it might form an article of export if it\r\nwere sufficiently known, as its preparation is extremely simple. The\r\nleaves are dried in the sun, and at the first exposure, after having\r\nbeen plucked from the vine which produces them, they show the abundant\r\nfeculent substance which they contain.\r\n\r\nLANA DYE.--A beautiful bluish-black color, known as \"Caruto,\" is\r\nprocured in Demerara and Berbice from the juice of the fruit of the\r\n_Genipa Americana_, Linn.--a tree very common in the colony. The\r\nIndians use it for staining their faces and persons. The Lana dye was\r\nhonorably mentioned by the jurors at the Great Exhibition in 1851. The\r\nbluish-black color obtained from it is remarkably permanent, a fact\r\nwhich has very long been known, though hardly any attempt appears to\r\nhave been made to introduce it to the notice of European dyers.\r\nAnother pigment is prepared by them from arnotto, mixed with turtle\r\noil, or carap oil, obtained from the seeds of the _Carapa guianensis_\r\n(Aubl.). The wild plantain (_Urania guianensis_) and the cultivated\r\nplantain (_Musa paridisiaca_), the Mahoe (_Thespesia populnea_), and\r\nthe pear seed of the Avocado (_Persea gratissima_), furnish dyes in\r\nvarious parts of the West Indies; specimens of many of these have been\r\nimported from British Guiana and Trinidad.\r\n\r\nRussia produces good specimens of the wood of _Statice coriaria_, the\r\nleaves and bark of sumach, the bark of the wild pomegranate, yellow\r\nberries, _Madia sativa_, saffron, safflower and madder roots for\r\ndyeing purposes.\r\n\r\n_Avicenna tomentosa_, a species of mangrove, is very common about the\r\ncreeks of Antigua, Jamaica, and other West India islands, where it is\r\nused for dyeing and tanning.\r\n\r\nIn New Zealand, the natives produce a most brilliant blue-black dye\r\nfrom the bark of the Eno, which is in great abundance. Some of the\r\nborders of the native mats, of a most magnificent black, are dyed with\r\nthis substance. It has been tried in New South Wales; but, as with\r\nother local dyes, although found well suited for flax, hemp, linen,\r\nor other vegetable productions, it could not be fixed on wools or\r\nanimal matter. Dr. Holroyd, of Sydney, some time since, imported a ton\r\nof it for a friend near Bathurst. It is of great importance that\r\nchemical science should be applied to devise some means of fixing this\r\nvaluable dye on wool. As the tree is so common, the bark could be had\r\nin any quantity at about £3 10s. a ton; and our tweed manufacturers\r\nare in great want of a black dye for their check and other cloths.\r\n\r\nThe principal heavy woods used for dyeing are fustic, logwood,\r\nNicaragua wood, barwood, camwood, red Sanders wood, Brazil wood, and\r\nsappan wood. All the dyewoods are nearly £2 per ton higher than last\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nCommon Spanish fustic which in September, 1852, was only £3 10s. per\r\nton, now fetches £6 10s. in the Liverpool market; and there is a great\r\ndemand for all kinds of dyewoods. Tampico and Puerto Cabello fustic\r\nare now worth £6 10s. to £7 the ton, Cuba ditto, £9 10s. to £10.\r\n\r\nSappan wood is £4 higher than last year; barwood has risen cent per\r\ncent; logwoods are £2 per ton higher.\r\n\r\nThe following were the prices of the different dyewoods in the\r\nLiverpool market, on the 1st September, 1853, per ton:--\r\n\r\n                               £   s. d.       £   s. d.\r\n  FUSTIC, common Spanish       5  10  0   to   6  10  0\r\n    Tampico                    6  10  0        7   0  0\r\n    Puerto Cabello             6  10  0        7  10  0\r\n    Cuba                       8   0  0        9  10  0\r\n  LOGWOOD, Jamaica             5   0  0        5   5  0\r\n    St. Domingo                5   5  0        5  10  0\r\n    Campeachy, direct          7  12  6        8   0  0\r\n    Indirect and Tobasco       6  10  0        7   0  0\r\n  NICARAGUA.

It only yields its color to ether or alcohol. The tree, which is\r\na lofty one, is common about Madras and other parts of India; it is\r\nalso indigenous to Ceylon, Timor, and other Eastern islands. The\r\nexports of this wood from Madras in one year have been nearly 2,000\r\ntons.\r\n\r\nThe imports of red Sanders wood from Calcutta and Bombay chiefly into\r\nLondon are to the extent of 700 or 800 tons a year, worth £6 to £9 per\r\nton.\r\n\r\nOf FUSTIC we import from 1,500 to 2,000 tons annually. We derive our\r\nsupplies from Brazil, Tampico, Puerto Cabello, Cuba, and Jamaica. The\r\nbest is obtained from Cuba; for while the common white fustic from\r\nJamaica and the Spanish Main fetches only £5 10s. to £6 10s. the ton,\r\nthat of Cuba realizes from £8 to £9 10s. the ton.\r\n\r\nSAPPAN WOOD (_Cæsalpinia Sappan_) is an article of considerable\r\ncommerce in the East. It is the bukkum wood of Scinde, and is procured\r\nin Mergui, Bengal, the Tenasserim Provinces, Malabar and Ceylon. In\r\n1842 as much 78,000 cwts. were shipped from Ceylon, but the export\r\nfrom thence has decreased. This island, however, ships dyewoods\r\nannually to the amount of £2,000. A large quantity is exported from\r\nSiam and the Philippine Islands; as much as 200,000 piculs annually\r\nfrom the former, and 23,000 piculs from Manila. 3,524 piculs were\r\nshipped from Singapore in 1851, and 4,074 piculs in 1852. The picul is\r\nabout one cwt. and a quarter. Sappan wood yields a yellowish color,\r\nlike that of Brazil wood (_C. brasiliensis_) but it does not afford of\r\ndye matter so much in quantity or so good in quality.\r\n\r\nIt forms a large export from Ceylon: the shipments from thence were,\r\nin 1842, 77,694 cwt.; in 1843, 1,692; in 1844, 2,592; in 1845, 2,854.\r\nI have no detailed returns at hand, but in 1837, 23,695 piculs of\r\nsappan wood, and 2,266 piculs of roots of ditto were shipped, and in\r\nthe first six months of 1843, 22,326 piculs were exported from Manila;\r\na large portion of this comes to Europe, but some goes to China, the\r\nUnited States, Singapore, &c. 15,500 piculs were shipped from Manila\r\nin 1844, 5,250 ditto in 1845; and 1,210 tons in 1850. About 3,000\r\npiculs of sappan wood and the same quantity of other dye-stuffs are\r\nannually imported into Shanghae. The price of straight sappan wood at\r\nShanghae in July, last year, was thirty dollars per picul.\r\n\r\nIn Calcutta, in June last year, 4,000 piculs of the root of Manila\r\nsappan wood sold freely at about 7s. 6d. per factory maund, Siam ditto\r\n6s.\r\n\r\n75 tons were imported into Liverpool in 1849; and 120 tons in 1850,\r\nfrom Calcutta. The imports of sappan wood into the United Kingdom, in\r\n1850, amounted to 3,670 tons, worth £8 to £12 the ton, and this\r\ncontinued the price in January 1853.\r\n\r\nCamwood, red sanders wood, barwood, and other dye woods, are found in\r\ngreat quantities in many parts of Africa. The dyes of Africa are found\r\nto resist both acids and light, properties which no other dyes seem to\r\npossess in the same degree. About thirty miles east of Bassia Cove, in\r\nthe republic of Liberia, is the commencement of a region of unknown\r\nextent, where scarcely any tree is seen except the camwood. This\r\nboundless forest of wealth, as yet untouched, is easily accessible\r\nfrom that settlement; roads can be opened to it with little expense,\r\nand the neighbouring kings would probably give their co-operation to a\r\nmeasure so vastly beneficial to themselves. It is impossible to\r\nascertain the exact amount of export of these commodities to Europe\r\nand the United States, but it is very great, and employs a large\r\namount of vessels. One Liverpool house imported 600 tons in a single\r\nyear, worth £9,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1841 upwards of 3,000 tons of dye woods were imported into\r\nLiverpool from the western coast of Africa.\r\n\r\nCAMWOOD (_Baphia nitida_) is used as a mordant and for producing the\r\nbright red color seen in English bandana handkerchiefs. The imports\r\nfrom Sierra Leone to Liverpool in 1849 were 216 tons, worth £20 to £25\r\nper ton.\r\n\r\nGaboon barwood is another variety of this dyewood which is imported\r\nfrom the west coast of Africa, in straight flat pieces, from three to,\r\nfive feet in length; the average annual import being about 2,000 tons,\r\nof the value of £4 a ton.\r\n\r\nThe imports of barwood into Liverpool were in--\r\n\r\n           Tons.\r\n  1835     2,000\r\n  1836     1,000\r\n  1837     1,150\r\n  1838       650\r\n  1839       350\r\n  1841     2,012\r\n  1850     1,710\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Dyewoods imported in 1850.

In\r\nAmerica the seeds are called achote or roucou. From the port of\r\nBarcelona, in Venezuela, about 2,000 quintals are annually exported.\r\nThe species grown for its dye is the _Bixa orellana_. It is used to\r\nimpart a bright orange color to silk goods, and to afford a deeper\r\nshade to simple yellows. The dry hard paste is also found to be the\r\nbest of all ingredients for giving a golden tint to cheese or butter.\r\nA convenient liquid preparation is now sold to dairymen. The Spanish\r\nAmericans mix it with their chocolate, to which it gives a beautiful\r\nrich hue.\r\n\r\nIt is of two sorts, viz.:--\r\n\r\n1. Flag or cake arnotto, which is by far the most important article in\r\na commercial point of view, is furnished almost wholly by Cayenne. It\r\nis imported in square cakes, weighing two or three pounds each,\r\nwrapped in banana leaves, packed in casks.\r\n\r\n2. Roll arnotto is principally brought from Brazil. The rolls are\r\nsmall, not exceeding two or three ounces in weight. It is hard, dry,\r\nand compact, brownish on the outside, and of a beautiful red color\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\nThe dye is usually prepared by macerating the pods in boiling water\r\nfor a week or longer. When they begin to ferment, the seeds ought to\r\nbe strongly stirred and bruised with wooden pestles to promote the\r\nseparation of the red skins. This process is repeated several times,\r\ntill the seeds are left white. The liquor passed through close cane\r\nsieves, pretty thick, of a deep red color, and a very bad smell, is\r\nreceived into coppers. In boiling, it throws up its coloring matter to\r\nthe surface in the form of scum, which is taken off, saved in large\r\npans, and afterwards boiled down to a due consistence, and then made\r\nup, when soft, into balls or cakes of two or three pounds weight.\r\n\r\nThe following description of the manufacture is from Dr. Ure:--\r\n\r\n\"The pods of the tree being gathered, their seeds are taken out and\r\nbruised; they are then transferred to a vat, which is called the\r\nsteeper, where they are mixed with as much water as covers them. Here\r\nthe substance is left for several weeks or even months; it is now\r\nsqueezed through sieves placed above the steeper, that the water\r\ncontaining the coloring matter in suspension may return into the vat.\r\nThe residuum is preserved under the leaves of the pine-apple shrub,\r\ntill it becomes hot by fermentation. It is again subjected to the same\r\noperation, and this treatment is continued till no more color remains.\r\n\r\n\"The substance thus extracted is passed through sieves, in order to\r\nseparate the remainder of the seeds, and the color is allowed to\r\nsubside. The precipitate is boiled in coppers till it be reduced to a\r\nconsistent paste; it is then suffered to cool, and dried in the shade.\r\nInstead of this long and painful labor, which occasions diseases by\r\nthe putrefaction induced and which affords a spoiled product, Leblond\r\nproposes simply to wash the seeds of arnotto till they be entirely\r\ndeprived of their color, which lies wholly on their surface; to\r\nprecipitate the color by means of vinegar or lemon juice, and to boil\r\nit up in the ordinary manner, or to drain it in bags as is practised\r\nwith indigo.\r\n\r\n\"The experiments which Vauquelin made on the seeds of arnotto imported\r\nby Leblond, confirmed the efficacy of the process which he proposed;\r\nand the dyers ascertained that the arnotto obtained in this manner was\r\nworth at least four times more than that of commerce; that, moreover,\r\nit was more easily employed; that it required less solvents; that it\r\ngave less trouble in the copper, and furnished a purer\r\ncolor.\"--(\"Dict. of Arts.\")\r\n\r\nOur imports of arnotto for home consumption are from 200,000 to\r\n300,000 lbs. per annum. The plant is grown in Dacca and other parts of\r\nIndia, and the eastern Archipelago. At the Hawaiian Islands,\r\nTongataboo, Rio Janeiro, Peru and Zanzibar, the arnotto is an\r\nindigenous shrub which rises to the height of seven or eight feet,\r\nproducing oblong heavy pods, somewhat resembling those of a chesnut.\r\nWithin these there are generally thirty or forty irregularly-formed\r\nseeds, which are enveloped in a pulp of a bright red color, and a\r\nfragrant smell.\r\n\r\nThe imports of arnotto have been as follows:--\r\n\r\n                          Retained for\r\n             lbs.       home consumption.\r\n  1834      252,981             --\r\n  1835      163,421             --\r\n  1839      303,489          224,794\r\n  1840      408,469          330,490\r\n  1847      270,000          296,821\r\n  1849      162,400          145,824\r\n  1850      301,504          231,280\r\n\r\nThe price of flag arnotto in the London market, in June 1853, was 1s.\r\nper lb.\r\n\r\nWe imported from France, in 1850, 1,924 cwt. of roll or flag arnotto,\r\nof the official value of £21,499; and in 1851, 1,253 cwt., worth\r\n£13,968.\r\n\r\nWood dye exported from Ceylon--\r\n\r\n            Value      Quantity\r\n              £          cwts.\r\n  1848      1,359          --\r\n  1849      2,035          --\r\n  1850      1,766        5,206\r\n  1851        259          776\r\n  1852        770        2,396\r\n\r\nCHAY-ROOT.--There is a plant called chay, the _Oldenlandia umbellata_,\r\nwhich is extensively cultivated as a dye plant in the East, especially\r\non the coasts of Coromandel, Nellore, Masulipatam, Malabar, and other\r\nparts of India. The outer bark of the roots furnishes the coloring\r\nmatter for the durable red for which the chintzes of India are famous.\r\nChay-root forms a considerable article of export from Ceylon. The wild\r\nplant there is considered preferable; the roots, which are shorter,\r\nyielding one-fourth part more coloring matter, and the right to dig it\r\nis farmed out. It grows spontaneously on light, dry, sandy ground on\r\nthe sea coast; the cultivated roots are slender, with a few lateral\r\nfibres, and from one to two feet long. The dye is said to have been\r\ntried in Europe, but not with very advantageous effect. Dr. Bancroft\r\nsuspects it may be injured by the long voyage, but he adds that it\r\ncannot produce any effect which may not be more cheaply obtained from\r\nmadder.\r\n\r\nThis red dye, similar to Munjeet, is used to a great extent in the\r\nsouthern parts of Hindostan by the native dyers.\r\n\r\nIt is not held in very good estimation in Europe but seems to deserve\r\na better reputation than it at present possesses. Attention was drawn\r\nto it as a dye-stuff in 1798, by a special minute of the Board of\r\nTrade recommending its importation; but Dr. Bancroft, who made some\r\nexperiments with a sample of damaged chay-root, considered it inferior\r\nto madder and hence discouraged its further importation.\r\n\r\nThe bark and root of various species of Morinda (_M. citrifolia_ and\r\n_tinctoria_) are used in different parts of the East Indies, and\r\nconsidered a very valuable red dye. The colors dyed with it are for\r\nthe most part exceedingly brilliant, and the coloring matter is far\r\nmore permanent than many other red colors are, with improved\r\nmanagement it would probably rival that of madder, and is, therefore,\r\nworthy more attention from dyers.\r\n\r\nMANGROVE BARK (_Rhizophora mangle_), is used to dye a chocolate color\r\nin the East and West Indies. This was one of the colors introduced by\r\nDr. Bancroft, and for the exclusive use of which he obtained an Act of\r\nParliament. It is procured in plenty at Arracan, Malabar, and\r\nSingapore in the East.\r\n\r\nSHUMAC or SUMACH, sometimes called young fustic, is the powder of the\r\nleaves, peduncles, and young branches of a small deciduous plant\r\n(_Rhus coriaria_), native of the South of Europe, but which is also\r\ngrown in Syria and Palestine, for its powerful astringent properties,\r\nwhich renders it valuable for tanning light-colored leather, and it\r\nimparts a beautiful bright yellow dye to cottons, which is rendered\r\npermanent by proper mordants. It is principally imported from the\r\nIonian Islands and the Morea. The species grown for the purpose in\r\nSpain, Portugal, and Italy is _R. Cotinus_, a shrub with pale purple\r\nflowers, whereas _R. coriaria_ has greenish yellow blossoms. They may\r\nbe propagated by cuttings of the roots and layers. _R. typhina_, and\r\n_R. glabia_, with their varieties, are North American species, which\r\nare also used for tanning purposes. In Montpellier and the South of\r\nFrance the twigs and leaves are known under the name of _redoul_ or\r\n_roudo_. They are gathered every year, and the shoots are chipped or\r\nreduced to powder by a mill.\r\n\r\nThe imports into the United Kingdom were in 1846,10,256 tons; in 1847,\r\n11,975 tons; in 1848, 9,617 tons; in 1849, 12,590 tons; in 1850,\r\n12,929 tons, and in 1852, 9,758; which were all retained for\r\nconsumption. In 1841, we received about 9,000 tons from the port of\r\nLeghorn. There were exported from Sicily in 1842, 123,305 tons, valued\r\nat £68,894. It is imported in packages of about a cwt., wrapped in\r\ncloth. America takes a large quantity of sumach. The imports into the\r\nport of Boston alone, were 19,070 bags in 1847; 34,524 in 1848; and\r\n30,050 in 1849.\r\n\r\nThe prices in Liverpool, duty paid, in the close of this year, are per\r\ncwt.:--\r\n\r\n                        s.  d.      s.  d.\r\n  Sicily, Messina       10  0   to  10  6\r\n    \"     Palermo       12  0    \"  13  0\r\n    \"     Trieste        7  0    \"   7  6\r\n    \"     Verona         5  6    \"   6  6\r\n    \"     Tyrolese       8  0    \"   9  0\r\n\r\nSAFFLOWER.--The dried flowers of _Carthamus tinctorius_ yield a pink\r\ndye, which is used for silks and cottons, and the manufacture of\r\nrouge; the color, however, is very fugitive. It is an annual plant,\r\ncultivated in China, India, Egypt, America, Spain, and some of the\r\nwarmer parts of Europe; and is indigenous to the whole of the Indian\r\nArchipelago. A large quantity is grown in and exported from Bali. The\r\nChinese safflower is considered the best, and that from Bombay is\r\nleast esteemed. The annual quantity exported from the district of\r\nDacca averages about 150 tons. The shipments from Calcutta exceed 300\r\ntons to various quarters. Our imports are on the decline, and are now\r\nonly about 1,200 cwt. per annum. Safflower was shown in the Great\r\nExhibition from Celebes, Assam, the vicinity of Calcutta, Dacca, the\r\nstates of Rajpootana, and other places.\r\n\r\nThere are two species: _C. tinctorius_, which has small leaves and an\r\norange flower; and _C. oxyacantha_, with larger leaves and a yellow\r\nflower, a native of Caucasus. The former is cultivated in Egypt, the\r\nLevant, &c., where it forms a considerable article of commerce. 6,633\r\ncwts. of safflower were imported into the United Kingdom in 1835, of\r\nwhich about one-half was retained for home consumption. Of 5,352 cwts.\r\nimported in 1840, nearly the whole came from our possessions in the\r\nEast. In 1847, about 405 tons were imported; in 1848, 506 tons; in\r\n1849, 407 tons; in 1850, 522 tons. The price of safflower varies from\r\n£1 to £8 per cwt., according to quality. That from Bombay is least\r\nesteemed, fetching only 20s. to 30s.\r\n\r\nThe annual quantity of safflower, according to Dr. Taylor, exported\r\nfrom the district of Dacca for eight years ending with 1839, amounted\r\nto 4,000 maunds, or about 149 tons. The exports through the Calcutta\r\nCustom House are occasionally large: in 1824-25 there were about 316\r\ntons; 8,500 Indian maunds were shipped from Calcutta in each of the\r\nyears 1841 and 1842.\r\n\r\nThe prices in the Liverpool market, in January 1853, were for Bengal,\r\ngood and fine, £6 to £7 10s. per cwt.; middling, £4 to £4 10s.;\r\ninferior and ordinary, £2 10s. to £3.\r\n\r\nGAMBOGE is extensively used as a pigment, from its bright yellow\r\ncolor. There are two kinds known in commerce, the Ceylon and the Siam.\r\nThe former is procured from the _Hebradendron Cambogoides_, Graham; a\r\ntree which grows wild on the Malabar and Ceylon coasts, and affords\r\nthe coarsest kind. The pipe gamboge of Siam is said to be obtained\r\nfrom the bruised leaves and young branches of _Stalagmites\r\ncambogoides_. The resinous sap is received into calabashes, and\r\nallowed to thicken, after which it is formed into rolls. Several other\r\nplants, as the _Mangostana Gambogia_, Gaertner, and the _Hypericum\r\nbacciferum_ and _Cayanense_, yield similar yellow viscid exudation,\r\nhardly distinguishable from gamboge and used for the same purpose by\r\npainters. The _Garcinia elliptica_, Wallich, of Tavoy and Moulmein,\r\naffords gamboge, and approaches very closely in its characters to\r\nGraham's _Hebradendron_. In like manner the Mysore tree bears an\r\nexceedingly close resemblance to that species. It is common in the\r\nforests of Wynaad in the western part of Mysore, and has been named by\r\nDr. Christison _Hebradendron pictorium_. Another gamboge tree has\r\nrecently been found inhabiting the western Burmese territories. Both\r\nthese seem to furnish an equally fine pigment. As it can be obtained\r\nin unlimited quantity, it might be introduced into European trade, if\r\nthe natives learn how to collect it in a state of purity, and make it\r\nup in homogenous masses in imitation of pipe gamboge, the finest Siam\r\nvariety. It seems to possess more coloring matter, more resin and less\r\ngum than the ordinary gamboge of commerce. Gamboge owes its color to\r\nthe fatty acid. The resin must be regarded as the chief constituent,\r\nand is most abundant in that imported from Ceylon, which contains\r\nabout 76 per cent., and is therefore best adapted for painting.\r\nGamboge also has its medicinal uses.\r\n\r\nVarious species of _Lecanora_, particularly _L. tartarea_, known as\r\ncudbear, are used in dyeing woollen yarn. The _Rocella tinctoria_ and\r\n_fusiformis_ furnish the orchil, or orchilla weed of commerce, which\r\nis sometimes sold as a moist pulp, but usually in the form of dry\r\ncakes, known under the name of _litmus_; it produces a fine purple\r\ncolor. Our imports, which have amounted to 6,000 or 7,000 cwts.\r\nannually, are derived chiefly from the Canary, Azores, and Cape Verd\r\nIslands. Rock orchilla was shown at the Exhibition, from the Berlingen\r\nIsles, from Angola, Madeira and the Cape de Verds. Orchilla weed is\r\nvery plentiful about the shores of the islands of New Zealand, some\r\nbeing sent from thence to the Exhibition; but from a want of knowledge\r\nas to the time at which it should be gathered, and the mode of\r\npreparing it for the market, it has not yet become a saleable\r\ncommodity there. The rich varieties of lichens on the rocks and plains\r\nof Australia have not been tested, as they ought to be, with Helot's\r\nlichen test. Various lichens, and _Rocella tinctoria_, from Tenasserim\r\nand other parts of India, have been introduced by the East India\r\nCompany. In the Admiralty instructions given to Capt. Sir James C.\r\nRoss, on his Antarctic voyage, a few years ago, his attention was\r\nspecially called to the search and enquiry for substitutes for the\r\n_Rocella_, which is now becoming scarce. A prize medal was awarded, in\r\n1851, to an exhibitor from the Elbe for specimens of the weed, and an\r\nextract of red and violet orchil. Specimens of varieties of the\r\nlichens used in the manufacture of cudbear, orchil and litmus, and of\r\nthe substance obtained, were also shown in the British department,\r\nwhich were awarded prize medals.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of the dyes given by common materials, in the Highlands of\r\nScotland, to some of the cloths which were exhibited, should lead our\r\nbotanists and chemists to examine, more closely than they have\r\nhitherto done, the dye-stuffs that might be extracted from British\r\nplants. Woad (_Isatis tinctoria_) and the dyers' yellow woad (_Reseda\r\nlutea_), are both well known. A piece of tweed, spun and woven in\r\nRoss-shire, was dyed brown and black, by such cheap and common dyes as\r\nmoss and alder bark, and the colors were unexceptionable.\r\n\r\nSutherlandshire tweed and stockings, possessing a rich brown color,\r\nwere produced with no more valuable dye than soot; in another piece,\r\nbeautifully dyed, the yellow was obtained from stoney rag, brown from\r\nthe crops of young heather, and purple from the same, but subjecting\r\nthe yarn to a greater action of the dye than was necessary to produce\r\nbrown. There is very little doubt but that beautiful and permanent\r\ndyes, from brown to a very rich purple, might be cheaply procured by\r\nscientific preparations of the common heather (_Genista tinctoria_).\r\nThe inhabitants of Skye exhibited cloth with a peculiarly rich dye,\r\nobtained from the \"crobal\" moss. In the Spanish department, specimens\r\nof vegetable dyes from many cultivated and wild plants were furnished\r\nby the Agricultural Board of Saragossa, and of several of these it\r\nwould be important to obtain descriptions and particulars.\r\n\r\nGums are of essential importance to the dyer, and the imports of\r\nthese, therefore, are large, averaging about 8,000 tons.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIGO.\r\n\r\nThe plants which afford this dye grow chiefly in the East and West\r\nIndies, in the middle regions of America, in Africa and Europe. They\r\nare all species of the genera _Indigofera_, _Isatis_ and _Nerium_.\r\n_Indigofera tinctoria_ or _coerulea_, furnishes the chief indigo of\r\ncommerce, and affords in Bengal, Malabar, Madagascar, the Isle of\r\nFrance, and St. Domingo, an article of middling quality, but not in\r\nlarge quantity. The _Indigofera disperma_, a plant cultivated in the\r\nEast Indies and America, grows higher than the preceding, is woody,\r\nand furnishes a superior dye-stuff. The Guatamela indigo comes from\r\nthis species.\r\n\r\n_Indigofera Anil_ grows in the same countries, and also in the West\r\nIndies. The _Indigofera Argentea_, which flourishes in Africa, yields\r\nlittle indigo, but it is of an excellent quality. _I.\r\npseudotinctoria_, cultivated in the East Indies, furnishes the best of\r\nall. _I. glauca_ is the Egyptian and Arabian species. There are also\r\nthe _cinerea_, _erecta_ (a native of Guinea), _hirsuta_, _glabra_,\r\nwith red flowers, species common to the East, and several others.\r\n\r\nThe _Wrightia tinctoria_, of the East Indies, an evergreen, with white\r\nblossoms, affords some indigo, as does the _Isatis tinctoria_, or,\r\nWoad, in Europe, and the _Polygonum tinctorium_, with red flowers, a\r\nnative of China. _Baptisia tinctoria_ furnishes a blue dye, and is the\r\nwild indigo of the United States.\r\n\r\nSOURCES OF SUPPLY.--Indigo is at present grown for commercial purposes\r\nin Bengal, and the other provinces of that Presidency, from the 20th\r\nto the 30th deg. of north latitude; in the Province of Tinnevelly; in\r\nthe Madras Presidency; in Java, in the largest of the Philippine\r\nislands, in Guatemala, Caraccas, Central America and Brazil. Bengal\r\nis, however, the chief mart for indigo, and the quantity produced in\r\nother places is comparatively inconsiderable. It is also still\r\ncultivated in some of the West India islands, especially St. Domingo,\r\nbut not in large quantities. Indigo grows wild in several parts of\r\nPalestine, but attention seems not to have been given to its\r\ncultivation or collection. On most parts of the eastern and western\r\ncoasts of Africa, it is indigenous; at Sierra Leone, Natal, and other\r\nplaces it is found abundant.\r\n\r\nIn our settlements of Honduras, Demerara, and various portions of the\r\nAmerican continent, it would amply reward the labor of the cultivator;\r\nseveral inferior sorts of Indigofera being found there indigenous, and\r\nonly requiring care and culture to improve them.\r\n\r\nThe quality of indigo depends upon the species of the plant, its\r\nripeness, the soil and climate of its growth, and the mode of\r\nmanufacture. The East India, and Brazilian indigo arrives here packed\r\nin chests, the Guatemala in ox-hides, called serons.\r\n\r\nThe indigo imported from the western hemisphere was for some time\r\nconsidered superior in quality to that of the East. Its cultivation,\r\nhowever, has been neglected, and the Bengal indigo is preferred at\r\npresent to any imported from South America, where it is now only\r\ncultivated by the Brazilians and Colombians. If proper attention were\r\npaid to the cultivation of the plant, and to the preparation of the\r\ndye, it is very likely part of that important trade would be brought\r\nback. It thrives best in a moist climate, and the interior of Guiana,\r\nchiefly newly-cleared land, would be well adapted for it.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. Dunlop (\"Travels in Central America\") gives an\r\ninteresting description, which, at the risk of repetition in some\r\npoints, I shall give entire.\r\n\r\n\"Several vessels generally arrive at the Union from South America at\r\nthe time of the periodical fairs, where nearly all the indigo (the\r\nonly produce of any importance), is disposed of; formerly it reached\r\n10,000 bales, but at present it does not at most exceed 3,000 bales of\r\n150 lbs. each.\r\n\r\nThe indigo well known in Europe by the name of Guatemala indigo, was\r\nnever cultivated in that province (in the same manner as not a grain\r\nof the Honduras cochineal is grown there), being entirely grown in the\r\nstate of San Salvador, in the vicinity of San Miguel, San Vicenti, and\r\nthe City of Salvador, with the exception of a small quantity of very\r\nsuperior quality grown in the state of Nicaragua, and a few bales in\r\nCosta Rica, which is all consumed in the State. Under the government\r\nof Spain, the produce of the state of San Salvador alone had reached\r\n10,000 bales, and that of Nicaragua 2,000; the produce of San Salvador\r\nin 1820, two years before its independence, being 8,323 bales. But\r\nsince 1822 the annual produce had gradually declined, and in 1846 it\r\ndid not exceed 1,000 to 1,200 bales, nearly all the indigo estates\r\nbeing abandoned, partly, no doubt, from the great fall in the price of\r\nthe article, but more on account of the impossibility of getting\r\nlaborers to work steadily.\r\n\r\nThe plant cultivated in Central America for the manufacture of indigo,\r\nis the triennial plant, supposed to be a native of America; but there\r\nis also an indigenous perennial plant, abounding in many parts of\r\nCentral America, which produces indigo of a very superior quality, but\r\ngives less than half the weight which is produced by the cultivated\r\nspecies. The ground for sowing the indigo seed is prepared in\r\nApril,--a piece of good forest land near one of the towns being\r\nselected, a part is cut to make a rude fence, and the remainder burnt,\r\nwhich is easily accomplished, as everything is very dry at that\r\nseason; and the ground is afterwards scratched with two sticks,\r\nfastened crosswise, to resemble somewhat the shape of a plough, and\r\nthe seed scattered over it by hand. The rainy season always commences\r\nearly in May, and the indigo is ready for cutting about the middle of\r\nJuly, taking about two and a half months to come to perfection. The\r\ngrowing crop somewhat resembles lucerne, and is in the best state for\r\nmaking indigo, when it becomes covered with a sort of greenish farina.\r\n\r\nThe crop of the first year is small, and sometimes not worth\r\nmanufacturing; that of the second year is the best, and the third is\r\nalso very good, if it has been carefully weeded; but many indigo\r\nfields have lasted more than ten years without being re-sown, as the\r\nseed which falls naturally springs up again, and where the land is\r\ngood yields nearly as large a crop as a new sown field. When the plant\r\nis ready for manufacturing, a number of men are collected, each of\r\nwhom is either provided with, or brings his own mule or horse, if he\r\nhas one. Two men always go together, cut the plant, then about the\r\nheight of full-grown red clover, and take it to the vats, which are\r\nlarge tanks made of brick and lime, holding at least 1,000 gallons,\r\nand some as much as 10,000. Into these the plant is thrown till they\r\nare nearly full, when weights are put above it to prevent its\r\nfloating; and the vats filled with water till it covers the mass of\r\nthe indigo plant. After remaining from twelve to twenty-four hours,\r\naccording to the state of the plant, weather, and other circumstances\r\n(the time required being determined by the color which the water\r\nassumes), the herb is taken out, and the water beaten with paddles in\r\nthe very small vats, and by a wheel suspended above and turned by men\r\nor horses in the larger ones, till it changes from a green color,\r\nwhich it has acquired ere the removal of the herb, to a fine blue,\r\nwhen it is allowed to stand for some hours, till the coloring matter\r\nhas settled to the bottom of the tank, a process which is generally\r\nhastened by throwing in an infusion of certain herbs to facilitate its\r\nsettlement, or as the natives term it curdle (_cuajar_) the colored\r\nwater. As soon as all the color has settled, the water is drawn off,\r\nand the blue, which is of the consistency of thick mud, is taken out\r\nof the vat and spread upon cotton, or coarse woollen cloth, and dried\r\nin the sun. The color in a great measure depends upon removing the\r\nherb exactly at the proper time, and upon properly beating the water,\r\nneither too long, or too short. Unless these processes are properly\r\nperformed, the indigo will not be of first-rate quality; but some\r\nestates will never produce the best indigo, whatever care may be\r\nbestowed on the manufacture.\r\n\r\nA _mansana_, of 100 yards square, which is nearly two British statute\r\nacres, produces generally about 100 to 120 lbs. of indigo, the\r\ncarriage and cutting of the herb costing about twenty dollars, and the\r\ncleaning of the field and all other expenses connected with it,\r\nincluding the manufacture of the indigo, about as much more.\r\n\r\nThe indigo of Central America is not put into moulds when drying, as\r\nthat of Bengal, but is allowed to remain in the rough shape in which\r\nit dries, and without further preparation is ready for baling and\r\nexportation.\r\n\r\nThe bales are generally made up in 150 lbs. each, and the quality is\r\nclassed by numbers, from 1 to 9; Nos. 1 to 3 being of the quality\r\ncalled _cobres_ in Europe; Nos. 4 to 6 of that called _cortes_, and\r\nNos. 7 to 9 of that called _flores_; Nos. 1 to 6 do not at present pay\r\nthe expenses of manufacture, and are never intentionally made. No\r\ndoubt, with a little more skill in the manufacture, the whole might,\r\nas in Bengal, be made of the quality called _flores_; but such\r\nimprovements cannot be expected till a new race of people inhabit\r\nCentral America. At present about one-half of the indigo produced is\r\nunder No. 7, and as the cultivation is said not to pay at the present\r\nprices--and, indeed, hardly can be supposed to compete with Bengal, a\r\ncountry where labor is so much cheaper, and capital abundant--it is\r\nprobable, that the cultivation will shortly be entirely abandoned,\r\nunless the price should again rise in Europe.\" In 1846, 21,933 lbs. of\r\nindigo were exported from Angostura.\r\n\r\nThe following particulars were contributed to my \"Colonial Magazine,\"\r\nby the late Dr. Edward Binns, of Jamaica:--\r\n\r\n    The species generally cultivated is the _I. tinctoria_, which\r\n    requires a rich moist soil and warm weather. The seed, which is at\r\n    first sight not unlike coarse gunpowder, is sown three or four\r\n    inches deep, in straight lines, twelve or fifteen inches apart. The\r\n    shoots appear above ground in about a week; at the end of two months\r\n    the plant flowers, when it is fit for cutting, which is done with a\r\n    pruning knife. It must be mentioned that great care is requisite in\r\n    weeding the indigo field when plants first shoot through the earth.\r\n    In the State of St. Salvador, large vats made of mahogany, or other\r\n    hard wood, are constructed for the reception of the plant, where it\r\n    is allowed to undergo maceration and fermentation. In a short time\r\n    the water becomes greenish, and emits a strong pungent smell, while\r\n    carbonic acid gas is freely evolved. In about twenty-four hours it\r\n    is run off into large flat vessels, and stirred about until a blue\r\n    scum appears, when additional water is added, and the blue flakes\r\n    sink to the bottom. The supernatant water has now acquired a\r\n    yellowish tinge, when it is run off carefully, and the blue deposit\r\n    or sediment put into bags to drain. It is subsequently dried in the\r\n    shade, or sometimes in the sun, then placed in cotton bags and\r\n    carried to the indigo fair, or forwarded to the city of Guatemala.\r\n\r\n    The East Indian mode of manufacturing the indigo differs materially,\r\n    and many suppose it preferable to the Salvador. It consists in\r\n    _steaming_ the fermented mass in large pipes enclosed in huge\r\n    boilers. I am inclined to believe this to be the most economical, if\r\n    not the best way of manufacturing indigo. From Guatemala alone, it\r\n    is computed that from 6,000 to 8,000 serons of indigo are exported\r\n    annually; while San Miguel, Chalatenaugo, Tejulta, Secatecolnea, St.\r\n    Vincent, Sensuntepepe, not only, it is said, produce a larger\r\n    quantity, but the four last-mentioned places have the advantage as\r\n    to quality. The _Belize Advertiser_ stated, some time since, that\r\n    the value of this dye from one State in 1830 produced 2,000,000\r\n    dollars, the minimum of an immense sum which has been most unjustly\r\n    and unwisely wrested from the people of Jamaica, and the West India\r\n    islands.\r\n\r\n    Bridges (\"Annals of Jamaica,\" p. 584, Append.), speaking of the vast\r\n    returns of an indigo plantation, says, \"The labour of a single negro\r\n    would often bring to his owner £30 sterling per annum clear\r\n    profit,--a sum which was at the time the laborer's highest price. It\r\n    continued the _staple_ of Jamaica till an intolerable tax oppressed\r\n    it, while its price was lowered by the competition of other\r\n    colonies.\r\n\r\n    Its cultivation immediately declined throughout them all, but\r\n    nowhere so rapidly as here. The financial error was quickly\r\n    discovered,--a remedy was attempted by a bounty; but it came too\r\n    late, the plantations were thrown up, and the planters, attracted by\r\n    the temporary gain, abused the tardy boon, by introducing, as of\r\n    their own growth, large quantities of foreign indigo.\" As Bridges\r\n    may be said in this passage to be merely a commentator on Edwards,\r\n    who has entered more largely upon the subject, I shall condense from\r\n    the latter, statements connected with the manufacture and decay of\r\n    this branch of industry, once the staple of Jamaica.\r\n\r\n    Edwards (\"West Indies,\" vol. ii., p. 275, 2nd edition) reckons three\r\n    kinds of indigo--the wild, Guatemala, and French. The first is the\r\n    hardest, and the dye extracted from it of the best quality as\r\n    regards color and grain; but one or other of the two species is\r\n    commonly preferred by the planter, as yielding a greater return. Of\r\n    these the French surpasses the Guatemala in quantity, but yields to\r\n    it in fineness of grain and beauty of color. The indigo thrives\r\n    almost on any land, though the richest soils produce the most\r\n    luxuriant plants, and the longest dry weather will not kill it. The\r\n    cultivation and manufacture our author thus describes:--\"The land\r\n    being prepared, trenches, two or three inches in depth, are made by\r\n    the hoe. These are ten or twelve inches asunder. The seeds are then\r\n    strewed in the trenches by the hand, and slightly covered with\r\n    mould. When the plants shoot, they are carefully weeded, and kept\r\n    constantly clean, until they rise high enough to cover the ground. A\r\n    bushel of seed is sufficient for four or five acres. The best season\r\n    for planting is March; but if the land be good, it may be sown at\r\n    any time, and in three months the plants attain maturity. In\r\n    seasonable situations, they have four cuttings in the year. The\r\n    subsequent growths from the plants ripen in six or eight weeks; but\r\n    the produce diminishes after the second cutting, so that the seeds\r\n    should be sown every second year. A species of grub, or worm, which\r\n    infests the plant on the second year is avoided by changing the\r\n    soil; or, in other words, by a rotation of crops. The produce per\r\n    acre of the first cutting is about 60 lbs. It is nearly as much in\r\n    North America; but when the thermometer falls to sixty, the returns\r\n    are very uncertain, that degree of heat being too low for the\r\n    necessary vegetation, maceration, and fermentation. The yieldings\r\n    for the subsequent cuttings somewhat diminish; but in Jamaica and\r\n    St. Domingo, if the land is new, about 300 lbs. per acre of the\r\n    second quality may be expected annually from all the cuttings\r\n    together; and four negroes are sufficient to carry on the\r\n    cultivation of five acres, besides doing other occasional work,\r\n    sufficient to reimburse the expenses of their maintenance and\r\n    clothing.\"\r\n\r\n    The process for obtaining the dye, according to the same author, was\r\n    conducted through the means of two cisterns, the one elevated above\r\n    the other, in the manner of steps. The higher, which was also the\r\n    longer, was named the _sleeper_--its dimensions sixteen feet square\r\n    and two and a half in depth. The second, into which the fluid was\r\n    discharged, was called the _battery_; it was about twelve feet\r\n    square, and four and a half in depth. These cisterns were of stone;\r\n    but strong timber answered remarkably well. There was also a\r\n    lime-vat, six feet square and four feet deep, the plug of which was\r\n    at least eight inches from the bottom. This was for the purpose of\r\n    permitting the lime to subside, before the lime-water was withdrawn.\r\n    The plants then being ripe, or fit for cutting, were cut with\r\n    reaping-hooks, or sickles, a few inches from the ground--six was the\r\n    minimum--and placed by strata in the _sleeper_, until it was about\r\n    three parts full. They were then pressed with boards, either loaded\r\n    with weights or wedged down, so as to prevent the plants from\r\n    floating loosely; and as much water was admitted as they would\r\n    imbibe, until it covered the mass four or five inches deep. In this\r\n    state it was allowed to ferment until the water had extracted the\r\n    pulp. To know when this had been thoroughly effected, required\r\n    extreme attention and great practical knowledge; for if the fluid\r\n    were drawn off too soon, much of the pulp was left behind; and if\r\n    the fermentation continued too long, the tender tops of the plants\r\n    were decomposed, and the whole crop lost. When the tincture or\r\n    extract was received in the battery, it was agitated or churned\r\n    until the dye began to granulate, or float in little flakes upon the\r\n    surface. This was accomplished at one period in Jamaica by paddles,\r\n    worked by manual labor, and, in the French islands, by buckets or\r\n    cylinders, worked by long poles; but subsequently--that is, at the\r\n    time Edwards wrote--convenient apparatus was constructed, the levers\r\n    of which were worked by a cog-wheel, kept in motion by a horse or\r\n    mule. When the fluid had been churned for fifteen or twenty minutes,\r\n    a small quantity was examined in a cup or plate, and if it appeared\r\n    curdled or coagulated, strongly impregnated lime-water was gradually\r\n    added, not only with a view to promote separation, but to prevent\r\n    decomposition. Browne remarks (\"Civil and Nat. Hist. of Jamaica,\"\r\n    art. \"Indigo\"), the planters \"must carefully distinguish the\r\n    different stages of this part of the operation also, and attentively\r\n    examine the appearance and color as the work advances,--for the\r\n    grain passes gradually from a greenish to a fine purple, which is\r\n    the proper color when the liquor is sufficiently worked,--too small\r\n    a degree of agitation leaving the indigo green and coarse, while too\r\n    vigorous an action brings it to be almost black.\" The liquor being\r\n    then, as we shall suppose, properly worked, and granulation\r\n    established, it was left undisturbed until the flakes settled at the\r\n    bottom, when the liquor was drawn off, and the sediment (which is\r\n    the indigo) placed in little bags to drain, after which it was\r\n    carefully packed in small square boxes, and suffered to dry\r\n    gradually in the shade.\r\n\r\n    Such is the account, nearly word for word, which Edwards gives of\r\n    the mode of manufacturing indigo. I shall now quote his remarks upon\r\n    the outlay and gain upon the article _verbatim_.--\"To what has been\r\n    said above of the nature of the plant suiting itself to every soil,\r\n    and producing four cuttings in the year, if we add the cheapness of\r\n    the buildings, apparatus, and labor, and the great value of the\r\n    commodity, there will seem but little cause for wonder at the\r\n    splendid accounts which are transmitted down to us concerning the\r\n    great opulence of the first indigo-planters. Allowing the produce of\r\n    an acre to be 300 lbs., and the produce no more than 4s. per pound,\r\n    the gross profit of only twenty acres will be £1,200, produced by\r\n    the labor of only sixteen negroes, and on capital in land and\r\n    buildings scarce deserving consideration.\" Yet, notwithstanding this\r\n    statement, the author informs us afterwards that he knew, in the\r\n    course of eighteen years' residence in the West Indies, upwards of\r\n    twenty persons who tried to re-establish indigo manufactories, but\r\n    failed. This appears strange, since it is plain that what has once\r\n    been done can be done again, but especially in the manufacture of an\r\n    article requiring a capital so very small in proportion to the\r\n    profits as almost to tempt the most cautious and the most timid man\r\n    to embark in it.\r\n\r\n    I quote the following passage from the same author, for the purpose\r\n    of showing the very loose manner in which statements are made on the\r\n    authority of others, who are as incompetent to decide the merits of\r\n    a question as the party himself chronicling their opinion. Speaking\r\n    of the twenty unfortunate indigo-planters, our author thus\r\n    writes:--\"Many of them were men of foresight, knowledge, and\r\n    property. That they failed is certain; but of _the causes of their_\r\n    FAILURE _I confess I can give no satisfactory account._ I was told\r\n    that disappointment trod close upon their heels at every stop. At\r\n    one time the fermentation was too long continued, at another the\r\n    liquor was drawn off too soon; now the pulp was not duly granulated,\r\n    and now it was worked too much. To these inconveniences, for which\r\n    practice would doubtless have found a remedy, were added others of a\r\n    much greater magnitude--the mortality of the negroes, from the\r\n    vapour of fermented liquor (an alarming circumstance, that, I am\r\n    informed, both by the French and English planters, constantly\r\n    attends the process), the failure of the seasons, and the ravages of\r\n    the worm. These, or some of these evils, drove them at length to\r\n    other pursuits, where industry might find a surer recompense.\"--(p.\r\n    283.)\r\n\r\n    The fallacy of much of this requires no comment, as it must strike\r\n    even the most careless reader,--for if the so-called indigo-growers\r\n    did not know the process of manufacturing the commodity, then it\r\n    could not be surprising that they failed. Thus the cause of their\r\n    failure required no comment, and no explanation. Were a ploughman\r\n    taken from the field and placed at the helm of a ship, and the\r\n    vessel in consequence wrecked, would any one be astonished but at\r\n    the folly of those who placed him there? This was the case with the\r\n    indigo-growers,--they attempted what they did not understand, and,\r\n    consequently, lost their labor and their money. The mortality of the\r\n    negroes employed, stated as another reason for abandoning the\r\n    attempt, requires a somewhat more lengthy notice.\r\n\r\n    I can briefly say, that I have learned that in the Central States of\r\n    America, deaths among indigo-laborers are not more frequent than in\r\n    other branches of tropical industry; and I never heard or have read\r\n    that the _original_ growers complained of the mortality attending\r\n    the progress. The truth is, that this statement is not founded on\r\n    fact. There is nothing whatever in the manufacture of indigo, either\r\n    in the cultivation or the granulation, or even the maceration and\r\n    fermentation of the plant, which is directly or indirectly, _per\r\n    se_, injurious to human life. I have certainly never seen the indigo\r\n    plant macerated on a large scale; but I have myself steeped much of\r\n    it in water, and allowed it even to rot, and found nothing in the\r\n    mass differing in any marked degree from decomposed vegetable\r\n    matter. It seems to me that this idea of the manufacture of indigo\r\n    being especially inimical to human life, is as unfounded as the\r\n    belief, even by Humboldt, up to a very recent period, that none of\r\n    the Cerealia would grow in tropical climates. In conversing with an\r\n    old gentleman in Jamaica, some twelve years since, who had tried the\r\n    manufacture of indigo, and with every prospect of success, but\r\n    abandoned it, as he confessed, for the cultivation of the sugar\r\n    cane, since it was then more profitable, he suggested the solution,\r\n    that as the manufacture was light work, probably aged and\r\n    debilitated, in place of youthful and vigorous slaves, were too\r\n    frequently employed in the process--hence the mortality. This may be\r\n    correct to a certain extent; but I am also inclined to think that\r\n    another cause of mortality might be found in the mode and manner in\r\n    which the negro was fed and clothed, and not because aged persons\r\n    were exclusively engaged in the manufacture. I believe I may state,\r\n    without fear of contradiction, that the real cause of the decline\r\n    and consequent abandonment of the indigo plant was the monstrous\r\n    duty levied upon it by the English government. Indeed, this has been\r\n    already stated in the extract from Bridges; while the cause of the\r\n    failure of the attempt to renew it, over and above the reasons we\r\n    have given, was the greater temptation to embark capital in sugar\r\n    plantations,--the West Indies enjoying a monopoly in this article,\r\n    while they had competitors in the Southern States of America in the\r\n    other. I have, therefore, no hesitation in saying, that, with a\r\n    trifling capital, under prudent management, indigo might be\r\n    cultivated to a very great extent, and with considerable profit,\r\n    even now, in Jamaica. But the adventurer is not to expect to count\r\n    his gains, as the original growers did, by thousands; he must be\r\n    content with hundreds, if not fifties; for at the present day every\r\n    branch of industry is laden with difficulties, encumbered by\r\n    taxation, and obstructed by competition. There are two objections,\r\n    however, which I have not removed,--I allude to \"the failure of the\r\n    seasons and the ravages of the worm.\" Very little need be said to\r\n    combat these. Seasons are mutable, and the same heaven that frowns\r\n    this year on the labors of the husbandman, may smile the next; while\r\n    a remedy for the \"ravages of the worm\" may be found in the mutation\r\n    of the soil, the destruction of the grub, or the rotation of\r\n    crops,--accessories to success which seem not to have entered into\r\n    the vocabularies of the twenty pseudo indigo-growers, \"many of them\r\n    men of knowledge, foresight and property.\"\r\n\r\n    The following passage from Bryan Edwards will corroborate much that\r\n    I have endeavored to enforce. It furnishes not only a solution which\r\n    has been hinted at before, of the enigma why indigo ceased to be\r\n    cultivated in Jamaica, but also _an incentive_ to re-introduce the\r\n    culture. He says (p. 444), \"It is a remarkable and well-known\r\n    circumstance, after the cultivation of indigo was suppressed by an\r\n    exorbitant duty of near £20 the hundred-weight, Great Britain was\r\n    compelled to pay her rivals and enemies £200,000 annually for this\r\n    commodity, so essential to a great variety of her most important\r\n    manufactures. At length, the duty being repealed, and a bounty some\r\n    time after substituted in its place, the States of Georgia and South\r\n    Carolina entered upon, and succeeding in the culture of this\r\n    valuable plant, supplied at a far cheaper rate than the French and\r\n    Spaniards (receiving too our manufactures in payment) not only the\r\n    British consumption, but also enabled Great Britain to export a\r\n    surplus at an advanced price to foreign markets.\"--It is therefore\r\n    plain that the manufacture of indigo was lost to Jamaica, not from\r\n    any difficulty in growing the plant, or from any loss of life\r\n    attending the process of manufacturing it, but from the ruinously\r\n    heavy duty of £20 the hundred-weight--and that now, when no duty\r\n    exists, it might be again cultivated with great advantage.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of indigo has been repeatedly attempted in Cuba, but\r\nnever with much success; although the shrub called the Xiquilite, from\r\nwhich it is extracted, grows wild in several districts of the island,\r\nbut more especially towards the eastern extremity. The first\r\n_anileria_, or manufactory of indigo, was established in 1795, under\r\nthe patronage of the _Ayuntamento_ of the Havana, who made an advance\r\nof 3,500 dollars, without interest, to the party engaging in the\r\nspeculation, in order to encourage the enterprise; but the undertaking\r\nproved unsuccessful, and the same fate has befallen every subsequent\r\nattempt to introduce this branch of industry. In 1827, the whole\r\nproduce amounted only to 56 arrobas. In 1837 the imports of indigo\r\ngreatly exceeded the exports; the former having amounted to 121,350\r\nlbs., and the latter to 82,890 lbs. In 1833, 5,184 lbs. reached the\r\nUnited Kingdom from the Havana, and in 1843, 62,675 lbs.\r\n\r\nIn 1826 British Honduras exported 358,552 lbs.; in 1830, 2,650 serons;\r\nin 1844, 1,247 serons; and in 1845, 1,052 serons.\r\n\r\nThe indigo shrub is one of the most common bushes in Trinidad, where\r\nit grows wild on almost all the indifferent soils. In 1783, there were\r\nseveral plantations and manufactories of indigo established in\r\nTrinidad; these were subsequently abandoned, on account of a\r\nsupposition that they were unhealthy. Prior to 1783, the colonists had\r\na kind of simple process by which they extracted sufficient coloring\r\nmatter to serve domestic consumption. This process is at present\r\nunknown, hence all the indigo used there is imported from Europe,\r\nalthough the plant from which it can be made vegetates in every\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nIn 1791 Hayti imported 930,016 lbs. of indigo, while in 1804 the\r\nexport had dwindled to 35,400 lbs.\r\n\r\nIndigo, as I have already stated, was once a most important crop in\r\nSouth Carolina, some attention has recently again been given to it by\r\nan individual or two in Louisiana, and the enterprise is said to\r\npromise success; enough might undoubtedly be raised in the United\r\nStates to supply the home market. Some indigo produced at Baton Rouge\r\nwas pronounced to have been equal to the best Caraccas, which sells at\r\ntwo dollars per pound; and the gentleman who cultivated it remarks,\r\nthat one acre of ground there, well cultivated, will yield from 40 to\r\n60 lbs.; that it requires only from July to October for cultivating\r\nit; that there is not connected with it one-third of the expense or\r\ntime that is generally required for the cultivation of cotton.\r\n\r\nI take the following from Smyth's \"Tour in the United States.\"\r\n\r\n\"This plant is somewhat like the fern when grown, and when young is\r\nhardly distinguishable from lucern grass, its leaves in general are\r\npinnated, and terminated by a single lobe; the flowers consist of five\r\nleaves, and are of the papilonaceous kind, the uppermost petal being\r\nlonger and rounder than the rest, and lightly furrowed on the side,\r\nthe lower ones are short and end in a point; in the middle of the\r\nflower is formed the style, which afterwards becomes a pod containing\r\nthe seeds.\r\n\r\n\"They cultivate three sorts of indigo in Carolina, which demand the\r\nsame variety of soils. First, the French or Hispaniola indigo, which\r\nstriking a long tap root will only flourish in a deep rich soil, and\r\ntherefore, though an excellent sort, is not so much cultivated in the\r\nmaritime parts of the State, which are generally sandy, but it is\r\nproduced in great perfection one hundred miles backwards; it is\r\nneglected too on another account, for it hardly bears a winter so\r\nsharp as that of Carolina. The second sort, which is the false\r\nGuatemala, or true Bahamas, bears the winter better, is a more tall\r\nand vigorous plant, is raised in greater quantities from the same\r\ncompass of ground, is content with the worst soil in the country, and\r\nis therefore more cultivated than the first soil, though inferior in\r\nthe quality of its dye.\r\n\r\n\"The third sort is the wild indigo, which is indigenous here; this, as\r\nit is a native of the country, answers the purposes of the planter\r\nbest of all, with regard to the hardiness of the plant, the easiness\r\nof the culture, and the quantity of the produce. Of the quality there\r\nis some dispute not yet settled amongst the planters themselves; nor\r\ncan they distinctly tell when they are to attribute the faults of\r\ntheir indigo to the nature of the plant, to the seasons, which have\r\nmuch influence upon it, or to some defect in the manufacture.\r\n\r\n\"The time of planting the indigo is generally after the first rains\r\nsucceeding the vernal equinox; the seed is sown in small straight\r\ntrenches, about eighteen or twenty inches asunder; when it is at its\r\nheight, it is generally eighteen inches tall. It is fit for cutting,\r\nif all things answer well, in the beginning of July.\r\n\r\n\"Towards the end of August a second cutting is obtained, and if they\r\nhave a mild autumn, there is a third cutting at Michaelmas. The indigo\r\nland must be weeded every day, the plants cleansed from worms, and the\r\nplantation attended with the greatest care and diligence. About\r\ntwenty-five hands may manage a plantation of fifty acres, and complete\r\nthe manufacture of the drug, besides providing their own necessary\r\nsubsistence and that of the planter's family.\r\n\r\n\"Each acre yields, if the land be very good, 60 or 70 lbs. weight of\r\nindigo, at a medium the produce is 50 lbs. This however, is reckoned\r\nby many skilful planters but a very indifferent crop.\r\n\r\n\"When the plant is beginning to blossom it is fit for cutting, and\r\nwhen cut great care ought to be taken to bring it to the steeper\r\nwithout pressing or shaking it, as great part of the beauty of the\r\nindigo depends upon the fine farina, which adheres to the leaves of\r\nthis plant. The apparatus for making indigo is inconsiderable and not\r\nexpensive, for besides a pump, the whole consists only of vats and\r\ntubs of cypress wood, common and cheap in this country.\r\n\r\n\"The indigo, when cut, is first laid in a vat, about twelve or\r\nfourteen feet long and four feet deep, to the height of about fourteen\r\ninches, to macerate and digest; then this vessel, which is called the\r\n_steeper_, is filled with water; the whole having laid from about\r\ntwelve to sixteen hours, according to the weather, begins to ferment,\r\nswell, rise, and grow sensibly warm. At this time spars of wood are\r\nrun across, to mark the highest point of its ascent; when it falls\r\nbelow this mark, they judge that the fermentation has attained its due\r\npitch, and begins to abate; this directs the manager to open a cock,\r\nand let off the water into another vat, which is called the _beater_;\r\nthe gross matter that remains in the first vat is carried off to\r\nmanure the ground, for which purpose it is excellent, and new cuttings\r\nare put in, as long as the harvest of the weed continues. When the\r\nwater, strongly impregnated with the particles of indigo, has run into\r\nthe second vat or beater, they attend with a sort of bottomless\r\nbuckets, with long handles, to work and agitate it, when it froths,\r\nferments, and rises above the rim of the vessel that contains it. To\r\nallay this violent fermentation, oil is thrown in as the froth rises,\r\nwhich instantly sinks it. When this beating has continued for twenty,\r\nthirty, or thirty-five minutes, according to the state of the weather\r\n(for in cool weather it requires the longest continued beating), a\r\nsmall muddy grain begins to be formed; the salts and other particles\r\nof the plant united, dissolved, and before mixed with the water, are\r\nnow re-united together, and begin to granulate. To discover these\r\nparticles the better, and to find when the liquor is sufficiently\r\nbeaten, they take up some of it from time to time on a plate, or in a\r\nglass; when it appears in a hopeful condition, they let loose some\r\nlime water from an adjacent vessel, gently stirring the whole, which\r\nwonderfully facilitates the operation; the indigo granulates more\r\nfully, the liquor assumes a purplish color, and the whole is troubled\r\nand muddy; it is now suffered to settle; then the clearer part is\r\npermitted to run off into another succession of vessels, from whence\r\nthe water is conveyed away as fast as it clears on the top, until\r\nnothing remains but a thick mud, which is put into bags of coarse\r\nlinen. These are hung up and left for some time until the moisture is\r\nentirely drained off.\r\n\r\n\"To finish the drying, this mud is turned out of the bags, and worked\r\nupon boards of some porous timber, with a wooden spatula; it is\r\nfrequently exposed to the morning and evening sun, but for a short\r\ntime only; and then it is put into boxes or frames, which is called\r\nthe curing, exposed again to the sun in the same cautious manner,\r\nuntil, with great labor and attention the operation is finished, and\r\nthe valuable drug fitted for the market. The greatest skill and care\r\nis required in every part of the process, or there may be great danger\r\nof ruining the whole; the water must not be suffered to remain too\r\nshort or too long a time, either in the steeper or beater; the beating\r\nitself must be nicely managed, so as not to exceed or fall short; and\r\nin the curing the exact medium between too much or too little drying\r\nis not easily attained. Nothing but experience can make the overseers\r\nskilful in these matters. There are two methods of trying the goodness\r\nof indigo; by fire and by water. If it swims it is good, if it sinks\r\nit is inferior, the heavier the worse; so if it wholly dissolves in\r\nwater it is good. Another way of proving it, is by the fire ordeal; if\r\nit entirely burns away it is good, the adulterations remain\r\nuntouched.\"\r\n\r\nIndigo to the extent of 220,000 lbs. per annum is grown in Egypt. The\r\nleaves are there thrown into earthen vessels, which are buried in pits\r\nand filled with water; heat is applied, and the liquid is boiled away\r\nuntil the indigo becomes of a fit consistence, when it is pressed into\r\nshape and dried. Many Armenians have been invited from the East Indies\r\nto teach the fellahs the best mode of preparation, and, in\r\nconsequence, nine indigo works have been established belonging to the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe indigo plant is found scattered like a weed abundantly over the\r\nface of the country in the district of Natal, Eastern Africa. It is\r\nsaid that there are no less than ten varieties of the plant commonly\r\nto be met with there. Mr. Blaine submitted, in 1848, to the Manchester\r\nChamber of Commerce, a small specimen of this dye-stuff, which had\r\nbeen extracted by a rude process from a native plant, which was\r\npronounced by good authority to be of superior quality, and worth 3s.\r\n4d. per pound. Mr. W. Wilson, a settler at Natal, in a letter to the\r\neditor of the _Natal Witness_, thus speaks of the culture:--\r\n\r\n    \"My attention was first forcibly drawn to the cultivation of indigo\r\n    by some seed imported by Mr. Kinlock, from India. This seed, on\r\n    trial, I found to grow luxuriantly; and after a few experiments I\r\n    succeeded in manufacturing the dye. The success which thus attended\r\n    my first attempts has encouraged me to try indigo planting on a more\r\n    extensive scale. For this purpose I am allowing all the plants of\r\n    this season to run to seed, and intend to plant equal quantities of\r\n    Bengal and native indigo.\r\n\r\n    While my attention was engaged in these preliminary experiments, I\r\n    observed that the country abounded in a variety of species of\r\n    indigo, and by a series of experiments found it rich and abundant,\r\n    and have since learnt that it is known and in use among the natives,\r\n    and called by them Umpekumbeto.\r\n\r\n    This of course induced further inquiry, and on consulting different\r\n    works I find that the Cape of Good Hope possesses more species of\r\n    indigo than the whole world besides. Now I take it for granted that\r\n    if Providence has placed these materials within our reach, it was\r\n    evidently intended that we should, by the application of industry,\r\n    appropriate them to our use. It becomes, then, a matter of necessity\r\n    that indigo must thrive, this being its native soil and climate; and\r\n    the experiments I have successfully made, go to support me in the\r\n    opinion that the cultivation of indigo will bring an ample reward.\r\n    Indeed it seems contrary to the laws of nature that it should be\r\n    otherwise.\r\n\r\n    I have obtained from the 140th part of an acre the proportion of 300\r\n    lbs. of indigo per acre. That the plant will cross successfully, I\r\n    have also ascertained.\"\r\n\r\n_Cultivation in India._--During the nine years which preceded the\r\nopening of the trade with India in 1814, the annual average produce of\r\nindigo in Bengal, for exportation, was nearly 5,600,000 lbs. But since\r\nthe ports were opened, the indigo produced for exportation has\r\nincreased fully a third; the exports during the sixteen years ending\r\nwith 1829-30, being above 7,400,000 lbs. a year.\r\n\r\nThe consumption in the United Kingdom has averaged, during the last\r\nten years, about 2,500,000 lbs. a year.\r\n\r\nIn 1839-40 the export of indigo from Madras amounted to 1,333,808\r\nlbs. A small quantity is also exported from the French settlement of\r\nPondicherry. In 1837 the export from Manila amounted to about 250,000\r\nlbs. The export from Batavia in 1841 amounted to 913,693 lbs., and the\r\nproduction in 1843 was double that amount. The annual exports of\r\nindigo, from all parts of Asia and the Indian Archipelago, were taken\r\nby M'Culloch, in 1840, to be 12,440,000 lbs. The imports are about\r\n20,000 chests of Bengal, and 8,000 from Madras annually, of which\r\n9,000 or 10,000 are used for home consumption, and the rest\r\nre-exported.\r\n\r\nThe total crop of indigo in the Bengal Presidency has ranged, for the\r\nlast twenty years, at from 100,000 to 172,000 factory maunds; the\r\nhighest crop was in 1845. The factory maund of indigo in India is\r\nabout 78 lbs.\r\n\r\nIn the delta of the Ganges, where the best and largest quantity of\r\nindigo is produced, the plant lasts only for a single season, being\r\ndestroyed by the periodical inundation; but in the dry central and\r\nwestern provinces, one or two _ratoon_ crops are obtained.\r\n\r\nThe culture of indigo is very precarious, not only in so far as\r\nrespects the growth of the plant from year to year, but also as\r\nregards the quantity and quality of the drug which the same amount of\r\nplant will afford in the same season.\r\n\r\nThe fixed capital required, as I have already shown, in the\r\nmanufacture of indigo, consists simply of a few vats of common masonry\r\nfor steeping the plant, and precipitating the coloring matter; a\r\nboiling and drying house, and a dwelling for the planter. Thus a\r\nfactory of ten pair of vats, capable of producing, at an average,\r\n12,500 lbs. of indigo, worth on the spot £2,500, will not cost above\r\n£1,500 sterling. The buildings and machinery necessary to produce an\r\nequal value in sugar and rum, would probably cost about £4,000.\r\n\r\nThe indigo of Bengal is divided into two classes, called, in\r\ncommercial language, Bengal and Oude; the first being the produce of\r\nthe southern provinces of Bengal and Bahar, and the last that of the\r\nnorthern provinces, and of Benares. The first class is in point of\r\nquality much superior to the other. The inferiority of the Oude indigo\r\nis thought to be more the result of soil and climate, than of any\r\ndifference in the skill with which the manufacture is conducted. The\r\nindigo of Madras, which is superior to that of Manila, is about equal\r\nto ordinary Bengal indigo. The produce of Java is superior to these.\r\n\r\nLarge quantities of indigo, of a very fine quality, are grown in\r\nScinde. I have to acknowledge the receipt, from the Indian Government,\r\nof an interesting collection of documents on the culture and\r\nmanufacture of indigo in Upper Scinde. The papers are chiefly from the\r\npen of Mr. Wood, Deputy Collector of Sukkur, though there are several\r\nothers, perhaps of much value, from various other of the revenue\r\nofficers of Scinde.\r\n\r\nMr. Wood is of opinion that Scinde is much better suited than Bengal\r\nfor the production of this dye-stuff--the alluvial soil on the banks\r\nof the Indus is equal in richness to that on those of the Ganges, and\r\nthe climate seems equally well suited for the growth of the plant. But\r\nin two years out of three, the crops of the Bengal planter are injured\r\nby excessive inundations, while the work of gathering and manipulation\r\nis necessarily performed, during the rainy season, under the greatest\r\nimaginable disadvantages. In Scinde, on the other hand, the inundation\r\nof the river is produced almost solely from the melting of the snows\r\nin the Himalayas, and it is not liable to those excessive fluctuations\r\nin amount, or that suddenness in appearance peculiar to inundations\r\nchiefly arising from falls of rain. The Granges sometimes rises ten\r\nfeet in four-and-twenty hours, and at some part of its course its\r\ndepth is at times forty feet greater during a flood than in fair\r\nweather, while the Indus rarely rises above a foot a day, its extreme\r\nflood never exceeding fifteen feet, the limits and amount of the\r\ninundation being singularly uniform over a succession of years.\r\nMoreover, as rain hardly ever falls in Scinde, and when it does so\r\nonly continues over a few days, and extends to the amount of three or\r\nfour inches, no danger or inconvenience from this need be apprehended.\r\nMr. Wood mentions that hemp may be grown in profusion on the indigo\r\ngrounds, and that were the production of the dye once introduced, it\r\nwould bring hundreds of thousands of acres now barren into\r\ncultivation, and secure the growth or manufacture of a vast variety of\r\nother commodities for which the country is eminently fitted. An\r\nexperimental factory might, it is believed, be set up for from two to\r\nthree thousand pounds, but this appears to be an amount of adventure\r\nfrom which the Government shrinks.\r\n\r\nThe districts of Kishnagar, Jessore, and Moorshedabad, in Bengal,\r\nranging from 88 to 90 degs. E. latitude, and 22½ to 24 degs. N.\r\nlongitude, produce the finest indigo. That from the districts about\r\nBurdwan and Benares is of a coarser or harsher grain. Tirhoot, in\r\nlatitude 26 degs., yields a tolerably good article. The portion of\r\nBengal most propitious to the cultivation of indigo, lies between the\r\nriver Hooghly and the main stream of the Ganges.\r\n\r\nIn the East Indies, after having ploughed the ground in October,\r\nNovember, and the beginning of December, they sow the seed in the last\r\nhalf of March and the beginning of April, while the soil, being\r\nneither too hot nor too dry, is most propitious to its germination. A\r\nlight mould answers best; and sunshine, with occasional light showers,\r\nare most favorable to its growth. Twelve pounds of seed are sufficient\r\nfor sowing an acre of land. The plants grow rapidly, and will bear to\r\nbe cut for the first time at the beginning of July; nay, in some\r\ndistricts so early as the middle of June. The indications of maturity\r\nare the bursting forth of the flower buds, and the expansion of the\r\nblossoms; at which period the plant abounds most in the dyeing\r\nprinciple. Another indication is taken from the leaves, which, if\r\nthey break across when doubled flat, denote a state of maturity. But\r\nthis character is somewhat fallacious, and depends upon the poverty or\r\nrichness of the soil. When much rain falls, the plants grow too\r\nrapidly, and do not sufficiently elaborate the blue pigment. Bright\r\nsunshine is most advantageous to its production.\r\n\r\nThe first cropping of the plants is the best; after two months a\r\nsecond is made; after another interval a third, and even a fourth; but\r\neach of these is of diminished value.\r\n\r\n_Culture in India._--For the following excellent account of the modes\r\nof culture, and practice, &c., in Bengal, and other parts of India, I\r\nam indebted to Mr. G. W. Johnson, one of the correspondents of my\r\n\"Colonial Magazine.\" Mr. Johnson, besides his own Indian experience,\r\nhas consulted all the best authorities, and the opinions of\r\ncontributors to the leading periodicals of Calcutta on this important\r\nsubject:--\r\n\r\n    When America became known to Europeans, its indigo became to them a\r\n    principal object of cultivation, and against their skill the native\r\n    Hindostanee had nothing to oppose, but the cheapness of his simple\r\n    process of manufacture. The profit and extent of the trade soon\r\n    induced Europeans to brave the perils of distance and climate to\r\n    cultivate the plant in Hindostan; but these obstacles, added to the\r\n    superior article manufactured by the French and Spaniards in the\r\n    West Indies, would long have held its produce in India in\r\n    subordination, if the anarchy and wars incident to the French\r\n    Revolution, especially when they reached St. Domingo, had not almost\r\n    annihilated the trade from the West, and consequently proportionally\r\n    fostered that in the East. The indigo produce of St. Domingo was\r\n    nearly as large as that of all the other West India islands\r\n    together. From the time that the negroes revolted in that island,\r\n    the cultivation of indigo has increased in Hindostan, until it has\r\n    become one of its principal exports, and the quality of the article\r\n    manufactured is not inferior to that of any other part of the world.\r\n\r\n    The most general mode of obtaining the necessary supply of _weed_,\r\n    as it is called by the planter, is as follows:--The land attached to\r\n    the factory is parcelled out among the ryots or farmers, who\r\n    contract to devote a certain portion of their farm to the\r\n    cultivation of indigo, and to deliver it, for a fixed price per\r\n    bundle, at the factory; a sum of money, usually equal to half the\r\n    probable produce, has to be advanced to the ryot by the planter, to\r\n    enable him to accomplish the cultivation, and to subsist upon until\r\n    the crop is ready for cutting.\r\n\r\n    If, as is generally the case, sufficient land is not attached to the\r\n    factory to supply it with plant, the owner obtains what he requires\r\n    by inducing the ryots in his vicinity to cultivate it upon a part of\r\n    their land. Yet it is with them far from a favorite object of\r\n    cultivation; and, indeed, if it were not for the money advanced to\r\n    each ryot by the planter, to provide seed, &c., and which gives him\r\n    a little ready money, bearing no interest, it is doubtful whether he\r\n    would engage in the cultivation at all. Even this advance of money\r\n    does not induce him to appropriate it to any but the worst part of\r\n    his farm, nor to bestow upon it more than the smallest possible\r\n    amount of labor. The reasons for this neglect are valid, for the\r\n    grain crops are more profitable to the ryot, and indigo is one of\r\n    the most precarious of India's vegetable products.\r\n\r\n    In Bengal the usual terms of contract between the manufacturer and\r\n    the ryot are, that the latter, receiving at the time a certain\r\n    advance of money, perhaps one rupee (2s.) per biggah, with promise\r\n    of a similar sum at a more advanced period of the season, undertakes\r\n    to have a certain quantity of land suitably and seasonably prepared\r\n    for sowing, to attend and receive seed whenever occasion requires,\r\n    and to deliver the crop, when called upon, at the factory, at a\r\n    specified price per bundle or 100 bundles. The particular conditions\r\n    of these contracts vary generally in Bengal; they amount to\r\n    advancing the ryot two rupees for every biggah of land, furnishing\r\n    him with seed at about one-third its cost, on an engagement from\r\n    him to return whatever his lands may produce (which, as has been\r\n    said, is generally none at all), at the price charged, and receiving\r\n    the plant from him at six, seven, eight, or sometimes nine bundles\r\n    for a rupee--much oftener the former than the latter rates. A ryot\r\n    cultivating alluvial lands, and having no seed, can hardly ever\r\n    repay his advances; but it does not follow that he has been a loser,\r\n    for he, perhaps, could not value his time, labor, and rent\r\n    altogether at half the amount; and as long as this system is kept\r\n    within moderate bounds, it answers much better than private\r\n    cultivation to the manufacturer, and has many contingent advantages\r\n    to the cultivator.\r\n\r\n    In Tirhoot similar engagements are entered into with the ryots, who\r\n    are there called _Assamees_. These engagements with Assamees are\r\n    generally made in the month of September, on a written instrument\r\n    called a _noviskaun_, by which they agree for a certain quantity of\r\n    land, for five years, to be cultivated with indigo plant, and for\r\n    which they are to be paid at the rate of six rupees per biggah, for\r\n    every full field of plant measured by a luggie or measuring-rod. The\r\n    luggie, it must be observed, varies in size throughout the district.\r\n    In the southern and eastern divisions of Tirhoot and Sarun it is\r\n    eight-and-a-half to ten feet long; and in the northern and western\r\n    from twelve to fourteen feet. The Assamee receives, on the day of\r\n    making his _bundobust_, or settlement, three rupees advance on each\r\n    biggah he contracts for, another rupee per biggah when the crop is\r\n    fit to weed, and the remaining two rupees at the ensuing settlement\r\n    of accounts. Exclusive of the price of his maul or plant, the\r\n    Assamee is entitled to receive two or three rupees per biggah (as\r\n    may be agreed on) for gurkee, or lands that have failed, as a\r\n    remuneration for his trouble, and to enable him to pay his rent. The\r\n    foregoing are the principal stipulations of the noviskaun, but the\r\n    Assamee further engages to give you such land as you may select,\r\n    prepare it according to instructions from the factory, sow and weed\r\n    as often as he is required, cut the plant and load the hackeries at\r\n    his own cost, and in every other respect conform to the orders of\r\n    the planter or his aumlah (managing man). The Assamee is not charged\r\n    for seed, the cartage of his plants, or for the cost of drilling. I\r\n    should mention that a penalty is attached to the non-fulfilment of\r\n    the Assamees engagements, commonly called _hurjah_, viz., twelve\r\n    rupees for every biggah short of his agreement, and this for every\r\n    year that the noviskaun has to run. This is, however, seldom\r\n    recoverable, for if you sue the Assamee in court and obtain a decree\r\n    (a most expensive and dilatory process), he can in most instances\r\n    easily evade it by a fictitious transfer of his property to other\r\n    hands.\r\n\r\n    The planter generally finds it his interest to get the Zemindar of\r\n    the village in which he proposes cultivating, to join in the\r\n    noviskaun, as a further security; or he engages with a jytedar, or\r\n    head Assamee, having several others subordinate to him, and for\r\n    whose conduct he is responsible. But a still better system is lately\r\n    gaining ground in this district, I mean that of taking villages in\r\n    ticka, or farm, by far the best and cheapest plan that has ever been\r\n    resorted to for the cultivation of indigo.\r\n\r\n    When the planter cultivates the ground himself, it is called in\r\n    Tirhoot _Zerant_ cultivation. _Zerants_, or _Neiz_, are taken on a\r\n    pottah or lease for five years, at the average rent of three rupees\r\n    per biggah. The heavy cost attending this cultivation has occasioned\r\n    its decrease in most factories in Tirhoot and particularly since the\r\n    fall in prices. About a third, I believe, was the proportion it\r\n    formerly bore to the whole cultivation of the district, but of late\r\n    such factories only have retained it as cannot procure sufficient\r\n    good land under the Assamewar system; but now that the plan of\r\n    taking villages in farm is becoming more and more prevalent here, it\r\n    is very likely that Zerants will be entirely abandoned. From all the\r\n    information I have been able to collect, the cost of a biggah of\r\n    Zerant (ten feet luggie) may be estimated at sixteen rupees; that of\r\n    Assamewar is generally twenty-five per cent. less, both exclusive of\r\n    interest, agents' charges, and private expenses.\r\n\r\n    It can only be the reluctance of the ryot to cultivate indigo that\r\n    induces a manufacturer to grow it himself, for it has been found an\r\n    expensive plan, profitable only when the dye is at its highest rate,\r\n    and even then scarcely furnishing an adequate return. They not only\r\n    could not cultivate so cheaply as the native laboring husbandman,\r\n    but ordinarily had to engage extensive tracts of land, much of\r\n    which was not suitable for their purpose, or, perhaps, for any\r\n    other, and consequently, although the average rate of rent was even\r\n    low on the whole, it constituted a very heavy charge on the portion\r\n    from which they obtained their return.\r\n\r\n    In Oude there are three systems of obtaining a supply of the plant,\r\n    viz., _Kush Kurreea_, _Bighowty_, and _Nij_; but the latter is a\r\n    mere trifle in proportion to the others, and is, therefore, not\r\n    worth mentioning. On the _Bighowty_ system, which prevails chiefly\r\n    in the Meerut and Mooradabad districts, the planter advances for a\r\n    biggah of _Jumowah_ (irrigated sowings) nine rupees, and for a\r\n    biggah of _Assaroo_ (rain sowings) five rupees four annas. The next\r\n    year's plant, or _khoonti_, becomes his on an additional payment of\r\n    eight annas per biggah. He also supplies the seed at the rate of six\r\n    seers per biggah, being almost double the quantity made use of in\r\n    Bengal, but which is necessary to make up for the destruction of the\r\n    plant the year following by the frost, white ants, hot winds, grass\r\n    cutters, and, I may add, the village cattle, which are let loose to\r\n    graze on the khoonte during the latter period, when not a blade of\r\n    grass or vegetation is to be seen anywhere left.\r\n\r\n    The Bighowty system is a sadly ruinous one, as, independently of the\r\n    attempts to assimilate Assaroo, at five rupees four annas, with\r\n    _Jumowah_, at nine rupees per biggah, which is very easily effected\r\n    if the planter is not very vigilant, he is obliged to maintain an\r\n    extensive and imposing establishment of servants, not only to\r\n    enforce the sowings, weeding, and cutting, but also to look after\r\n    his khoonte, and protect it from being destroyed by bullocks and\r\n    grass cutters, or from being ploughed up clandestinely by the\r\n    Zemindars themselves.\r\n\r\n    The Kush Kurreea system again has its evils, as the planter never\r\n    gets plant for the full amount of his advances, and hence often\r\n    leads to his ruin.\r\n\r\n    _Soils._--Indigo delights in a fresh soil; new lands, of similar\r\n    staple to others before cultivated, always surpass them in the\r\n    amount and quality of their produce. Hence arises the superior\r\n    productiveness of the lands annually overflowed by the Ganges, the\r\n    earthy and saline deposits from which in effect renovate the soil.\r\n    The further we recede from the influence of the inundation, the less\r\n    adapted is the soil for the cultivation of indigo. The staple of the\r\n    soil ought to be silicious, fertile, and deep. Mr. Ballard, writing\r\n    on the indigo soils of Tirhoot, says that high \"soomba,\" or light\r\n    soils, are generally preferred, being from their nature and level\r\n    less exposed to the risk of rain or river inundation; but they are\r\n    difficult to procure, and, moreover, require particular care in the\r\n    preparation. Next in estimation is \"doruss,\" a nearly equal mixture\r\n    of light earth and clay; a soil more retentive of moisture in a dry\r\n    season than any other. \"Muttyaur,\" or heavy clay soils, are\r\n    generally avoided, although in certain seasons, with mild showers of\r\n    rain, they have been known to answer. The safest selection I should\r\n    conceive to be an equal portion of soomba and doruss. In a country,\r\n    however, interspersed with jheels and nullahs, it is difficult to\r\n    form a cultivation without a considerable mixture of low lands, more\r\n    or less, according to the situation of the Assamee's fields. Great\r\n    care should be taken, at all events, to guard against oosur lands,\r\n    or such as abound with saltpetre; these can be most easily detected\r\n    in the dry months. _Puchkatak_, that is, lands slightly touched with\r\n    _oosur_, have been known to answer, as partaking more of the nature\r\n    of _doruss_ soil; but the crop is generally thin, although strong\r\n    and branchy.\r\n\r\n    There is another description of land that should be cautiously\r\n    avoided. It goes by the name of _jaung_, and is a light soil, with a\r\n    substratum of sand from six to twelve inches below the surface. The\r\n    plant generally looks very fine in such fields till it gets a foot\r\n    high, when the root touching the sand, and having no moisture to\r\n    sustain it, either dies away altogether, or becomes so stunted and\r\n    impoverished as to yield little or nothing in the cutting. Of the\r\n    _daub_ or _dearab_ (alluvial) land, says Mr. Ballard, there is\r\n    scarcely any in the district except what falls to the lot of my own\r\n    factories, being situated on the banks of the Ganges and Great\r\n    Gunduck. Of _bungur_, a stiff reddish clay soil, there is little in\r\n    Tirhoot; it pervades the western provinces, and is best adapted for\r\n    Assaroo sowings, which do not succeed in Tirhoot.\r\n\r\n    _Preparation of the soil._--The root of the indigo plant being\r\n    fusiform, and extending to about a foot in length, requires the soil\r\n    to be loosened thoroughly to that depth at least. Experience\r\n    teaches that the fineness of the tilth to which the soil is reduced\r\n    previously to the seed being committed to it, is one very\r\n    influential operation for the obtaining a productive crop. Yet in\r\n    some districts of Bengal, particularly about Furudpore, the sowing\r\n    is performed without any previous ploughing. This is where the\r\n    river, when receded, has left the soil and deposit so deep, that\r\n    about October, or a little later, the seed being forcibly discharged\r\n    from the sower's hand, buries itself, and requires no after covering\r\n    by means of the rake or harrow.\r\n\r\n    In Tirhoot they are indefatigable in this first step of the\r\n    cultivation. Mr. Ballard says, that the preparation of indigo lands\r\n    should commence in September, as soon as the cessation of the rains\r\n    will permit; and as we do not rely on rain for our sowings (as is\r\n    the custom in Bengal and elsewhere, and irrigation is never resorted\r\n    to, from the heavy expense attending it), our principal aim is to\r\n    preserve as much moisture in the fields as possible. They should\r\n    receive, for this purpose, not less than eight ploughings, besides a\r\n    thorough turning up with the spade, after the fourth ploughing, to\r\n    clear the field from stubble, grass and weeds. It is absolutely\r\n    indispensable to get all this done on our light soils, especially\r\n    before the end of October, and have the land carefully harrowed\r\n    down, so as to prevent the moisture escaping.\r\n\r\n    Should there be heavy rains between the interval of preparing and\r\n    sowing, it will be necessary to turn the fields up with either one\r\n    or two ploughings, and harrow them down as before. If only a slight\r\n    shower, running the harrow over them will be sufficient to break the\r\n    crust formed on the surface, and which, if allowed to remain, would\r\n    quickly exhaust the moisture. This, with the occasional use of the\r\n    weeding-hook, is all that the lands will require till the time of\r\n    sowing.--(\"Transactions of the Agri.-Hort. Society of Calcutta,\"\r\n    vol. ii., p. 22.)\r\n\r\n    _Sowing_.--The time when the seed is committed to the soil varies in\r\n    different parts of India, and, even in the same place, admits of\r\n    being performed at two different seasons. The periods of sowing in\r\n    Bengal are first immediately after the rains, from about the latter\r\n    end of October. The rivers are then rapidly retiring within their\r\n    beds, and as soon as the soft deposit of the year has drained itself\r\n    into a consistency, though not solid enough to keep a man from\r\n    sinking up to his knees in it, they begin to scatter the seed\r\n    broadcast. This is continued until the ground has become too hard\r\n    for the seed to bury itself; the plough is then used to loosen the\r\n    crust, and the sowing continued to about the middle, or even the end\r\n    of November, from which period the weather is considered too cold,\r\n    until February. These autumnal sowings are called October sowings,\r\n    from the month in which they generally commence. Much of the plant\r\n    perishes during the months of December and January, and more again\r\n    in the spring, unless there are early and moderate showers. The crop\r\n    that remains is not so productive ordinarily in the vat, as that\r\n    obtained from spring sowings, and some think the quality of the\r\n    produce inferior. But there is no expense of cultivation, and the\r\n    liabilities of the crop to failure are such a discouragement to cost\r\n    and labor in rearing it, that the October sowing is followed by most\r\n    planters who can obtain suitable land. The second period of sowing\r\n    is the spring, with the first rains of March, or even the end of\r\n    February. The land having been measured and placed under its slight\r\n    course of tillage during the two or three preceding mouths, is sown\r\n    broadcast as soon as the ground has been well moistened, or even in\r\n    prospect of approaching rain. The quantity of seed used for this\r\n    autumn sowing is generally more than what is considered requisite\r\n    for spring sowing; six seers at the former and four at the latter\r\n    season per biggah, in Bengal, is the quantity usually allowed.\r\n\r\n    Some cultivators commence the autumn sowing as early as at the close\r\n    of September, or as soon as the low lands are in a state to permit\r\n    the operation after the inundation has subsided. This seed time may\r\n    be said to continue until the end of December, and the crops from\r\n    these sowings often yield an average produce, if the lands are not\r\n    very low and wet. If they are, the sowing had better be delayed\r\n    until January, or even February, for the crops from these latter\r\n    sowings are usually the most productive, and the dye obtained from\r\n    them the finest. The object for thus delaying the sowing is, that\r\n    the young plants may have a more genial season for vegetation. Those\r\n    who prefer sowing earlier, and yet are aware of the importance of\r\n    saving the young plants as much as possible from the comparative low\r\n    temperature of the season, sow some other crop with their indigo.\r\n    Til, the country linseed, is good for this purpose in high lying\r\n    soils. But I never knew an intermixture of crops that was not\r\n    attended by inconveniences and injuries more than was compensated by\r\n    the advantages gained.\r\n\r\n    The success of sowings during March and April is very doubtful. It\r\n    depends entirely upon the occurrence of rain, which in those months\r\n    is proverbially uncertain. If the season should be sufficiently wet,\r\n    the sowing may be performed in May; but a June sowing is very rarely\r\n    remunerating. The rains setting in during the latter part of this\r\n    month so promote the growth of weeds, that the young plants are\r\n    choked and generally destroyed. The exceptions only occur in high\r\n    lands, in unusually propitious seasons, and ought never to be relied\r\n    upon except when the earlier sowings have failed. To protract the\r\n    manufacturing season, some planters begin sowing upon low lying\r\n    lands in the hot season, for the chance of a crop at the\r\n    commencement of the rains; and they sow at the close of the rains\r\n    with the hope of, as it were, stealing another in the next year. In\r\n    the western provinces sowing necessarily occurs in the dry weather,\r\n    usually in March and April, though occasionally either a little\r\n    earlier or later.\r\n\r\n    In Tirhoot the sowings commence about the latter end of February or\r\n    the beginning of March, if by that time there is sufficient warmth\r\n    in the atmosphere to ensure a healthy vegetation. Light soils are\r\n    sown on one close ploughing; heavy soils on two, with from four to\r\n    eight seers of seed, in proportion to the size of the biggah. After\r\n    strewing the seed, the field should be harrowed down by two turns of\r\n    the harrow, and then again by two turns more after the third day. In\r\n    case of rain before the plant appears (which it ought to do on the\r\n    sixth or seventh day), if a slight shower, the harrow should be used\r\n    again; if very heavy, it were best to turn up the ground and re-sow.\r\n    If rain fall after the appearance of the plant, and before it has\r\n    got past four leaves, and attained sufficient strength to resist the\r\n    hard crust before alluded to, immediate recourse must be had to\r\n    drilling. In fact, the closest attention is required to watch the\r\n    state of the young crop for a month at least after the sowings; if\r\n    it yield the least, or assume a sickly appearance, drills are the\r\n    only resource. These, if applied in time, in all March, for\r\n    instance, or before the middle of April at latest, are generally\r\n    successful, not only in restoring plants, but recovering such as may\r\n    have become sickly from want or excess of moisture, or any other\r\n    cause. In dry seasons they have been known to give a crop when\r\n    broadcast sowings have failed. Each drill, with a good pair of\r\n    bullocks, should do five biggahs a day. They are regulated to throw\r\n    from three to four seers per biggah, but the quantity can be\r\n    increased or diminished at pleasure. The natives do not employ them\r\n    in their grain sowings, but commonly adopt a contrivance with their\r\n    own plough for sowing in furrows, whenever their fields are\r\n    deficient in moisture. The drill employed in Tirhoot resembles\r\n    considerably the implement known by that name in England. It is\r\n    found not only to effect a great saving of seed, ten seers being\r\n    there sown broad-cost on a biggah of 57,600 feet square, and only\r\n    seven seers by this drill; but also materially to improve the\r\n    quality and regularity of the growth of the plant. Experience has\r\n    demonstrated, that the more lateral room the plants have, the more\r\n    abundant is their produce of leaves, in which the coloring matter\r\n    chiefly resides. The seed employed should always be as new as\r\n    possible, for though, if carefully preserved, it vegetates when one\r\n    year old, and even when nearly two years old has produced a moderate\r\n    crop, yet this has been under circumstances of an unusually\r\n    favorable season and soil. The plants from old seed rarely attain a\r\n    height of more than a foot before they wither and die. As frauds are\r\n    very likely to be practised by giving old seed the glossiness and\r\n    general appearance of new, great circumspection should be shown by\r\n    the planter, who does not grow his own, in obtaining seed from known\r\n    parties.\r\n\r\n    Planters in the lower provinces are induced to use up-country seed,\r\n    because, coming from a colder climate, it vegetates, and the plants\r\n    ripen rapidly, so as to be harvested more certainly before the\r\n    annual inundation, but they employ one-fourth more. Three seers per\r\n    Bengal biggah are sufficient, if it is \"Dassee\" seed; but four is\r\n    not too much if it is up-country seed. A Bengal biggah is only a\r\n    third of the size of that of Tirhoot. If the weather is dry, the\r\n    seed very often does not germinate until the occurrence of rain, and\r\n    it has been known in a dry, light soil, to remain in the ground\r\n    without injury for six weeks. If seasonable showers occur, the\r\n    plants make their appearance in four days, or even less; and they\r\n    must be watched, in order that they may be weeded on the earliest\r\n    day that they are sufficiently established to allow the operation to\r\n    be safely performed. In dry weather, it must not be done while they\r\n    are very young, otherwise many of the seedlings will have their\r\n    roots disturbed, and perish from the drought. However, not more than\r\n    a fortnight should be allowed to pass, after the seedlings have\r\n    appeared, before the weeds are carefully removed, and this clearing\r\n    should be frequently repeated until the plants so overshadow the\r\n    ground that they of themselves keep back the advance of the weeds.\r\n    The first weeding is best performed immediately after a shower of\r\n    rain.\r\n\r\n    Irrigation is rarely adopted for the indigo crops in the lower\r\n    provinces of Bengal, unless they happen to be grown in some\r\n    situation very favorable to the operation, such as the bank of a\r\n    river. It is much more attended to in the western provinces, and in\r\n    Oude, the water being obtained from wells, which are dug in nearly\r\n    every cultivated plot. In Oude, Mr. Ballard says that a biggah of\r\n    land employs three persons to irrigate it, and occupies never less\r\n    than six days. The ryot, or cultivator, requires for the work a pair\r\n    of bullocks, which cost him at least 32s., a bucket made of a white\r\n    bullock hide, at 2s., and a rope for 2s. more, both of which do not\r\n    last him above a year. He never pays less than 8s. for the rent of a\r\n    biggah of land near a well.\r\n\r\n    In Bengal the plant requires three months to attain its highest\r\n    state of perfection for manufacturing, but is often cut, from\r\n    necessity, within half that time; for the approach of the river\r\n    compels the premature removal of the crop, unless, indeed, its\r\n    growth has been so retarded that it would not pay the expense of\r\n    working. Most indigo factories have consequently to begin in June,\r\n    or early in July, whenever they may have effected their spring\r\n    sowings, and the labors of the season are commonly terminated by the\r\n    middle or end of August.\r\n\r\n    When the plants begin to flower is considered the best time for\r\n    cutting them, and this is just what the botanist would have\r\n    suggested, because then the proper sap of all plants is most\r\n    abundant, and most rich in their several peculiar secretions. A\r\n    vividly green, abundant and healthy foliage, downy at the back, is\r\n    the surest intimation of the plants being rich in indigo. Plants\r\n    that are ready for cutting in July and August, are usually the most\r\n    productive.\r\n\r\n    In the western provinces from sixteen to twenty maunds of plant is\r\n    considered a good produce per biggah. In the upper provinces the\r\n    produce of the best crop, which is sown directly the rains commence,\r\n    is not more then ten maunds per biggah. The factory maund is equal\r\n    to about seventy-eight pounds. One thousand maunds of plant are\r\n    considered as producing quite an average quantity of indigo if this\r\n    amounts to four maunds. Adopting another mode of estimate, Mr.\r\n    Ballard says, that in Bengal an average crop may he considered to be\r\n    from ten to twelve bundles, over an extensive cultivation, in a good\r\n    season, from each Bengal biggah; the sheaf or bundle being measured\r\n    by a six-feet cord or chain. Speaking of the produce in Tirhoot, the\r\n    same gentleman says the \"luggie,\" or measuring rod, varies\r\n    throughout the district. The common Tirhoot biggah, is, I believe,\r\n    equal to two-and-a-half or three Bengal biggahs (about an English\r\n    acre). Its produce varies according to the size of the luggie, the\r\n    fertility of the soil, and accidents of season; eight to ten hackery\r\n    loads, however, is generally considered a good average return. South\r\n    and east of Tirhoot, one hundred maunds from six hundred biggahs,\r\n    including \"khoonti,\" or a second cutting, is reckoned a successful\r\n    result. In another part of the district, including Sarun, where the\r\n    \"luggie\" is larger, the average produce is about one-third better.\r\n    As we measure our plant on the ground (he adds), the bundle system\r\n    is unknown here; but, I believe, forty-five or fifty Tirhoot hackery\r\n    loads of plants (estimated to yield a maund of dry indigo), will be\r\n    found equal to two hundred Bengal bundles.--(\"Trans. Agri. Hort.\r\n    Soc., vol. ii. p. 23.\")\r\n\r\n    In Oude the _jamowah_, or crop sown in May, yields on an average\r\n    twenty maunds, or say thirteen bundles, per biggah (160 feet\r\n    square). The \"assaroo,\" or rain sowings, producing a very inferior\r\n    plant, the average return is not more than three maunds, or two\r\n    bundles. The \"khoonti,\" or crop of the next year from the same\r\n    plants, averages fifteen maunds, or ten bundles per biggah.\r\n\r\n    In Central and Western India, the plants are allowed to produce the\r\n    second and even the third year, according to some statements; but in\r\n    Bengal the same stocks are rarely suffered to yield a second crop:\r\n    being nearly all on lands that are under water in the height of the\r\n    inundation, the stock is rotted in the ground. Mr. Ballard, speaking\r\n    of the duration of the plant, says that, as for three years' plant\r\n    and \"khoonti,\" it is a mere chimera, like the many others with which\r\n    the planters have hitherto deluded themselves, and which it only\r\n    requires a little reflection to overthrow. A biggah may be cut here\r\n    and there, on an extensive cultivation, but it can never be relied\r\n    upon as forming a part of the cultivation.\r\n\r\n    The uncertainty of the indigo crop has been already noticed, and is,\r\n    indeed, as proverbial as that from the hop plant in England. In\r\n    Bengal the crop is particularly subject to be destroyed by the\r\n    annual inundation of the river, if it occurs earlier than usual. A\r\n    storm of wind, accompanied by rain and hail, as completely ruins the\r\n    crop as if devoured by the locust; neither from this latter scourge\r\n    is the crop exempt.\r\n\r\n    This proneness to injury extends throughout its growth. The\r\n    seedlings are liable to be destroyed by an insect closely resembling\r\n    the turnip-fly, as well as by the frog. Caterpillars feed upon the\r\n    leaves of older plants, and the white ant destroys them by consuming\r\n    their roots. To these destructive visitations are to be added the\r\n    more than ordinary liability of the plant to injury, not merely from\r\n    atmospheric commotions, but even from apparently less inimical\r\n    visitations. Thus not only do storms of wind, heavy rains, and hail,\r\n    destroy the indigo planter's prospects, but even sunshine, if it\r\n    pours out fervently after showers of rain, is apt, as it is properly\r\n    termed, to _scorch_ the plants; and if it occurs during the first\r\n    month of their growth, is most injurious to their future advance.\r\n    The reason of this effect appears to be the violent change from a\r\n    state of imbibing to a rapid transpiration of moisture. No human\r\n    invention or foresight can preserve the crop from the atmospheric\r\n    visitations. To destroy and drive away the little coleopterous\r\n    insects which attack the seedlings, it would be a successful method\r\n    to spread dry grass, &c., over the surface intended to be\r\n    cultivated, and to burn the litter immediately before the sowing.\r\n    The heat and smoke produced has been found perfectly efficacious\r\n    against the turnip-fly in England. To destroy the caterpillar,\r\n    slacked lime dusted over the leaves, while the dew is upon them, is\r\n    an effectual application. The white ants may be driven away or\r\n    destroyed by frequent hoeings, which is the best preventive of the\r\n    scorching, for hoeing preserves the soil in an equable and fitting\r\n    state of moisture.\r\n\r\n    The great supply of seed for Bengal cultivation is obtained from the\r\n    western provinces, and forms an article of trade of no\r\n    inconsiderable magnitude. The stubble in the low lands of Bengal is\r\n    generally submerged before it has time to throw out fresh shoots, on\r\n    which the blossom and subsequent seed-pod are formed. There are,\r\n    however, some high tracts reserved for that purpose, and on these\r\n    the plant is found well in flower in September, and the seed fit to\r\n    gather in November or early in December.\r\n\r\nTwo methods are pursued to extract the indigo from the plant; the\r\nfirst effects it by fermentation of the fresh leaves and stems; the\r\nsecond, by maceration of the dried leaves; the latter process being\r\nmost advantageous. They are thus described by Dr. Ure, in his\r\n\"Dictionary of Arts and Manufactures:\"--\r\n\r\n    1. _From the recent leaves._--In the indigo factories of Bengal,\r\n    there are two large stone-built cisterns, the bottom of the first\r\n    being nearly upon a level with the top of the second, in order to\r\n    allow the liquid contents to be run out of the one into the other.\r\n    The uppermost is called the fermenting vat, or the steeper; its\r\n    area is twenty feet square, and its depth three feet; the lowermost,\r\n    called the beater or beating vat, is as broad as the other, but\r\n    one-third longer. The cuttings of the plant, as they come from the\r\n    field, are stratified in the steeper, till this be filled within\r\n    five or six inches of its brim. In order that the plant, during its\r\n    fermentation, may not swell and rise out of the vat, beams of wood\r\n    and twigs of bamboo are braced tight over the surface of the plants,\r\n    after which water is pumped upon them till it stands within three or\r\n    four inches of the edge of the vessel. An active fermentation\r\n    speedily commences, which is completed within fourteen or fifteen\r\n    hours; a little longer or shorter, according to the temperature of\r\n    the air, the prevailing winds, the quality of the water, and the\r\n    ripeness of the plants. Nine or ten hours after the immersion of the\r\n    plant, the condition of the vat must be examined; frothy bubbles\r\n    appear, which rise like little pyramids, are at first of a white\r\n    colour, but soon become grey, blue, and then deep purple red. The\r\n    fermentation is at this time violent, the fluid is in constant\r\n    commotion, apparently boiling, innumerable bubbles mount to the\r\n    surface, and a copper colored dense scum covers the whole. As long\r\n    as the liquor is agitated, the fermentation must not be disturbed,\r\n    but when it becomes more tranquil, the liquor is to be drawn off\r\n    into the lower cistern. It is of the utmost consequence not to push\r\n    the fermentation too far, because the quality of the whole indigo is\r\n    deteriorated; but rather to cut it short, in which case there is,\r\n    indeed, a loss of weight, but the article is better. The liquor\r\n    possesses now a glistening yellow color, which, when the indigo\r\n    precipitates, changes to green. The average temperature of the\r\n    liquor is commonly 85 deg. Fahr.; its specific gravity at the\r\n    surface is 1.0015; and at the bottom 1.003.\r\n\r\n    As soon as the liquor has been run into the lower cistern, ten men\r\n    are set to work to beat it with oars, or shovels four feet long,\r\n    called _busquets_. Paddle wheels have also been employed for the\r\n    same purpose. Meanwhile two other laborers clear away the\r\n    compressing beams and bamboos from the surface of the upper vat,\r\n    remove the exhausted plant, set it to dry for fuel, clean out the\r\n    vessel, and stratify fresh plants in it. The fermented plant appears\r\n    still green, but it has lost three-fourths of its bulk in the\r\n    process, or from twelve to fourteen per cent. of its weight, chiefly\r\n    water and extractive matter.\r\n\r\n    The liquor in the lower vat must be strongly beaten for an hour and\r\n    a half, when the indigo begins to agglomerate in flocks, and to\r\n    precipitate. This is the moment for judging whether there has been\r\n    any error committed in the fermentation, which must be corrected by\r\n    the operation of beating. If the fermentation has been defective,\r\n    much froth rises in the beating, which must be allayed with a little\r\n    oil, and then a reddish tinge appears. If large round granulations\r\n    are formed, the beating is continued, in order to see if they will\r\n    grow smaller. If they become as small as fine sand, and if the water\r\n    clears up, the indigo is allowed quietly to subside. Should the vat\r\n    have been over-fermented, a thick fat-looking crust covers the\r\n    liquor, which does not disappear by the introduction of a flask of\r\n    oil. In such a case the beating must be moderated. Whenever the\r\n    granulations become round, and begin to subside, and the liquor\r\n    clears up, the beating must be discontinued. The froth or scum\r\n    diffuses itself spontaneously into separate minute particles, that\r\n    move about the surface of the liquor, which are marks of an\r\n    excessive fermentation. On the other hand, a rightly fermented vat\r\n    is easy to work; the froth, though abundant, vanishes whenever the\r\n    granulations make their appearance. The color of the liquor, when\r\n    drawn out of the steeper into the beater, is bright green; but as\r\n    soon as the agglomerations of the indigo commence, it assumes the\r\n    color of Madeira wine; and speedily afterwards, in the course of\r\n    beating, a small round grain is formed, which, on separating, makes\r\n    the water transparent, and falls down, when all the turbidity and\r\n    froth vanish.\r\n\r\n    The object of the beating is three-fold; first, it tends to\r\n    disengage a great quantity of carbonic acid present in the liquor;\r\n    secondly, to give the newly-developed indigo its requisite dose of\r\n    oxygen by the most extensive exposure of its particles to the\r\n    atmosphere; thirdly, to agglomerate the indigo in distinct flocks or\r\n    granulations. In order to hasten the precipitation, lime water is\r\n    occasionally added to the fermented liquor in the progress of\r\n    beating, but it is not indispensable, and has been supposed capable\r\n    of deteriorating the indigo. In the front of the beater a beam is\r\n    fixed upright, in which three or more holes are pierced, a few\r\n    inches in diameter. These are closed with plugs during the beating,\r\n    but two or three hours after it, as the indigo subsides, the upper\r\n    plug is withdrawn to run off the supernatant liquor, and then the\r\n    lower plugs in succession. The state of this liquor being examined,\r\n    affords an indication of the success of both the processes. When the\r\n    whole liquor is run off, a laborer enters the vat, sweeps all the\r\n    precipitate into one corner, and enters the thinner part into a\r\n    spout which leads into a cistern, alongside of a boiler, twenty feet\r\n    long, three feet wide, and three feet deep. When all this liquor is\r\n    once collected, it is pumped through a bag, for retaining the\r\n    impurities, into the boiler, and heated to ebullition. The froth\r\n    soon subsides, and shows an oily looking film on the liquor. The\r\n    indigo is by this process not only freed from the yellow extractive\r\n    matter, but is enriched in the intensity of its color, and increased\r\n    in weight. From the boiler the mixture is run, after two or three\r\n    hours, into a general receiver called the _dripping vat_, or table,\r\n    which, for a factory of twelve pairs of preparation vats, is twenty\r\n    feet long, ten feet wide, and three feet deep, having a false bottom\r\n    two feet under the top edge. This cistern stands in a basin of\r\n    masonry (made water-tight with Chunam, hydraulic cement), the bottom\r\n    of which slopes to one end, in order to facilitate the drainage. A\r\n    thick woollen web is stretched along the bottom of the inner vessel,\r\n    to act as a filter. As long as the liquor passes through turbid, it\r\n    is pumped back into the receiver; whenever it runs clear, the\r\n    receiver is covered with another piece of cloth to exclude the dust,\r\n    and allowed to drain at its leisure. Next morning the drained magma\r\n    is put into a strong bag, and squeezed in a press. The indigo is\r\n    then carefully taken out of the bag, and cut with a brass wire into\r\n    bits, about three inches cube, which are dried in an airy house,\r\n    upon shelves of wicker work. During the drying a whitish\r\n    effloresence comes upon the pieces, which must be carefully removed\r\n    with a brush. In some places, particularly on the coast of\r\n    Coromandel, the dried indigo lumps are allowed to effloresce in a\r\n    cask for some time, and when they become hard they are wiped and\r\n    packed for exportation.\r\n\r\n    2. _Indigo from dried leaves._--The ripe plant being cropped, is to\r\n    be dried in sunshine from nine o'clock in the morning till four in\r\n    the afternoon, during two days, and threshed to separate the stems\r\n    from the leaves, which are then stored up in magazines till a\r\n    sufficient quantity he collected for manufacturing operations. The\r\n    newly dried leaves must be free from spots, and friable between the\r\n    fingers. When kept dry, the leaves undergo, in the course of four\r\n    weeks, a material change, their beautiful green tint turning into a\r\n    pale blue-grey, previous to which the leaves afford no indigo by\r\n    maceration in water, but subsequently a large quantity. Afterwards\r\n    the product becomes less considerable.\r\n\r\n    The following process is pursued to extract indigo from the dried\r\n    leaves:--They are infused in the steeping vat with six times their\r\n    bulk of water, and allowed to macerate for two hours, with continual\r\n    stirring, till all the floating leaves sink. The fine green liquor\r\n    is then drawn off into the beater vat, for if it stood longer in the\r\n    steeper, some of the indigo would settle among the leaves and be\r\n    lost. Hot water, as employed by some manufacturers, is not\r\n    necessary. The process with dry leaves possesses this advantage,\r\n    that a provision of the plant may be made at the most suitable\r\n    times, independently of the vicissitudes of the weather, and the\r\n    indigo may be uniformly made; and, moreover, that the fermentation\r\n    of the fresh leaves, often capricious in its course, is superseded\r\n    by a much shorter period of simple maceration.\r\n\r\n  PRODUCTION  OF INDIGO  IN  INDIA.\r\n\r\n             maunds.\r\n\r\n  1840      120,000\r\n  1841      162,318\r\n  1842       79,000\r\n  1843      143,207\r\n  1844      127,862\r\n  1845      127,862\r\n  1846      101,328\r\n  1847      110,000\r\n  1848      126,565\r\n  1849      126,000\r\n\r\nAverage of the ten years 126,744 maunds.\r\n\r\nThe yield from the different districts in 1849, was nearly as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n                maunds.\r\n  Bengal        84,500\r\n  Tirhoot       24,500\r\n  Benares        9,500\r\n  Oude           6,500\r\n              ---------\r\n               125,000\r\n\r\nIn 1790 the general object of cultivation in Mauritius was indigo, of\r\nwhich from four to five crops a year were procured. One person sent to\r\nEurope 30,000 lbs., in 1789, of very superior quality.\r\n\r\nCEYLON.--Indigo, though indigenous in Ceylon, is still imported from\r\nthe adjoining continent, but its growth in this island would be\r\nsubject to none of the vicissitudes of climate, that in the course of\r\na single night have devastated the most extensive plantations in\r\nBengal, and annihilated the hopes and calculations of the planter at a\r\ntime when they had attained all the luxuriance of approaching\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\nThe district of Tangalle, in the southern province, is the best\r\nadapted to the culture and manufacture of indigo for various reasons,\r\nsuch as the abundance of the indigenous varieties of the plant, the\r\nsimilarity of the climate to that of the coast of Coromandel, where\r\nthe best indigo is produced; facility of transport by water to either\r\nof the ports of export, Galle or Colombo, during the south-east, or to\r\nTrincomalee by the south-west monsoon; every necessary material is at\r\nhand for building a first rate indigo factory, including drying yards,\r\nleaf godowns (stores), steeping vats and presses, except roof and\r\nfloor tiles--which may be obtained in any quantity from Colombo,\r\nduring the south-west monsoon, at a moderate rate, compared with their\r\ncost at home.\r\n\r\nIn 1817 an offer was made to the Grovernment to introduce the\r\ncultivation of indigo, on condition of a free grant of the land\r\nrequired for the purpose and freedom from taxation for thirty years,\r\nafter which the usual tax was to be levied; and in case the\r\ncultivation were abandoned, the land was to revert to the Crown. But\r\nwhether from the disturbed state of the colony at the time or from\r\nincredulity on the part of the Government, as to the capability of the\r\ncolony in this respect, the application was unheeded. A subsequent\r\nproposal, emanating from a Swedish gentleman of great ability, skill\r\nand enterprise, was defeated by his death, although a company was on\r\nthe point of formation to carry out the scheme. It would not be\r\ndifficult, says Mr. Barrett, to select 500,000 acres, the property of\r\nthe Crown, which at a comparatively small expenditure might be brought\r\ninto a proper state of cultivation for the reception of indigo seed;\r\nfor very little would be required to be done beyond clearing the land\r\nof weeds, burning the grass, and then lightly ploughing and levelling\r\nthe ground; and whenever manure might be requisite, the fecula of the\r\nleaf affords one of the richest that could be employed. Ceylon\r\nproduces two other plants from which a very valuable blue dye may be\r\nobtained by a similar process to that of making indigo. The Singhalese\r\nhead men of the Tangalle district have long been anxious for the\r\nestablishment of an indigo plantation there, and would readily take\r\nshares in a company established for that purpose. Indigo would seem to\r\nhave been exported by the Dutch from Ceylon so late as 1794. The wild\r\nvarieties of indigo which grow on the sea-shore are used by the dobies\r\n(_washermen_).\r\n\r\nIndigo grows in a wild state in Siam, and all the dye used in the\r\ncountry is manufactured from these plants. The extensive low grounds\r\nare admirably suited for the cultivation of this plant.\r\n\r\nA large quantity is raised in Manila, but I have no full details of\r\nthe cultivation in the Philippines. However, in the first six months\r\nof 1843, 1,039 piculs of indigo were shipped to Europe, and about 650\r\nto other quarters--equal in all to about 226,000 lbs. in the half\r\nyear. In the year 1847 the exports of indigo were 30,631 arrobas,\r\nequal to about 7,658 cwt.; in 1850 the total exports from Manila were\r\n4,225 quintals.\r\n\r\nJAVA.--The cultivation of indigo was introduced into Java in the time\r\nof the company. It was so much neglected during the administration of\r\nGovernor Daendels, that the exportation ceased. It however revived\r\nsubsequently, and in 1823 the exports were close upon 17,000 lbs. In\r\n1826 it had risen to 46,000 lbs. In the single province of Westbaglen,\r\nabout 60 square miles in extent, 86 indigo factories were established\r\nin the course of seven or eight years. In 1839, the exports of this\r\ndye-stuff from Java were 588,764 kilogrammes, valued at 7½ million\r\nfrancs.\r\n\r\nIt has been found by experience that a good soil is essentially\r\nnecessary for the plant, and the indigo transplanted from elevated\r\ngrounds to the rice fields succeeds better and yields more coloring\r\nmatter than when raised direct on the spot from the seed. The\r\nresidencies of Cheribon, Baglen and Madura, are those in which the\r\ncrop succeeds best. From being so exhausting a crop, and finding it\r\nprejudicial to their rice grounds, they are gradually abandoning\r\nindigo culture in Java, and about two-thirds of the indigo plantations\r\nhave within the, last year or two been replaced with sugar.\r\n\r\nThe value of the Java indigo is set down at 250 rupees (£25) per\r\nmaund. If this be the average price, and it cannot be manufactured\r\nlower, Bengal has little to fear from Javanese competition. The\r\nproduct of indigo rose from 276 maunds in 1825, to 28,000 in 1842, and\r\nthe quantity sold by the Dutch Trading Company in the last-named year\r\nwas 10,500 chests, of about the same dimensions as those usually\r\nexported from Calcutta.\r\n\r\nSome further statistics of the culture in Java are shown in the\r\nfollowing returns of the quantity exported:--\r\n\r\n                  lbs.\r\n  1830          22,063\r\n  1835         535,753\r\n  1839         595,818\r\n  1841         913,693\r\n  1843       1,890,429\r\n  1851         769,580\r\n  1852         838,288\r\n\r\nThe produce in 1848 was 1,151,368 lbs.\r\n\r\n                                                            1840.       1841.\r\n  Residencies in which this culture is introduced               9          10\r\n  Number of factories                                         728         728\r\n  Families occupied with this culture                     197,085     192,159\r\n  Extent of fields where the cutting has been made\r\n     in _bahas_ of 71 decametres                           40,844      38,829\r\n  Quantity  of _bahus_ planted before the gathering           317         538\r\n  Quantity of indigo crop in pounds                     2,032,097   1,663,427\r\n  \"           average pounds per _bahu_                       49¾          43\r\n\r\nThe extent of fields destined for the crop of 1842 was 37,970 bahus,\r\nand the amount of the crop was calculated by approximation at\r\n1,862,000.\r\n\r\nThe gradual increase of the export in the eighteen years ending 1842,\r\nis shown as follows:--\r\n\r\n            Maunds.\r\n  1825          76\r\n  1826         126\r\n  1827         109\r\n  1828         310\r\n  1829         600\r\n  1830         480\r\n  1831         563\r\n  1832       2,213\r\n  1833       2,861\r\n  1834       3,310\r\n  1835       7,023\r\n  1836       5,365\r\n  1837      10,822\r\n  1838       9,788\r\n  1839      15,680\r\n  1840      27,946\r\n  1841      24,044\r\n  1842      28,000\r\n\r\nTotal imports of indigo into the United Kingdom, and quantity retained\r\nfor home consumption:--\r\n\r\n               Imports.

Our principal supplies of this\r\nimportant article of commerce are obtained from Holland, Belgium,\r\nFrance, Turkey, Spain, and the Balearic Isles, the Italian States,\r\nIndia, and Ceylon.\r\n\r\nThe plant is generally raised from seed, and requires three years to\r\ncome to maturity. It is, however, often pulled in eighteen months\r\nwithout injury to the quality; the quantity only is smaller. A rich\r\nsoil is necessary for its successful cultivation, and when the soil is\r\nimpregnated with alkaline matter, the root acquires a red color; in\r\nother cases it is yellow. The latter is preferred in England, from the\r\nlong habit of using Dutch madder, which is of this color, but in\r\nFrance the red sells at two francs per cwt. higher, being used for the\r\nTurkey-red dye. Madder does not deteriorate by keeping, provided it be\r\nkept dry. It contains three volatile coloring matters, madder purple,\r\norange, and red. The latter is in the form of crystals, having a fine\r\norange red color, and called Alizaine. This is the substance which\r\nyields the Turkey-red dye. The chay root is employed in the East\r\nIndies as a substitute for madder, and so is the root of _Morinda\r\ncitrifolia_, under the name of Sooranjee.\r\n\r\nTurkey madder roots realise about 30s. per cwt. About 1,100 tons are\r\nannually shipped from Naples, worth about £30 per ton.\r\n\r\nMadder has become an article of great request, on account of the fine\r\nscarlet color produced from its roots, and is so essential to dyers\r\nand calico printers that without it they cannot carry on their\r\nmanufactures. It is cultivated extensively in Holland, from whence it\r\nis imported in large quantities into both England and France, though\r\nit is cultivated to some extent in both countries. It has also been\r\nraised as a soiling crop, but the coloring matter is of so penetrating\r\nand subtile a character, that the flesh, milk, and even the bones of\r\nanimals fed upon it are said to be tinged to a considerable degree\r\nwith it. The soils best adapted, and which should be selected for its\r\ncultivation, are dry, fertile, and deep sandy loams; the roots are\r\nlong and fibrous, and descend to a depth of from two to three feet. It\r\nmay be propagated by seed, which, by some, is thought the best\r\nmethod, but the more usual mode is by the division of, and\r\ntransplanting, the roots. The ground should be thoroughly and deeply\r\npulverised, clean, and well-manured for the preceding crop, that the\r\nmanure may be thoroughly rotted and incorporated with the soil: in\r\nApril or May the suckers will be fit for taking from the older\r\nplantations--those of two or three years producing the best. The sets\r\nshould have roots four or five inches long. Mark out rows two feet\r\napart, with a line, and set the plant with a dibble, one foot apart in\r\nthe rows. The roots should be dipped in a puddle of fine rich earth\r\nand water, beaten to the consistence of cream, previous to planting;\r\nlet the crown of the plant be clearly over ground, and secure the\r\nearth well around the root, to keep out drought. The plantation\r\nrequires nothing more but to be kept perfectly clean and well-hoed\r\nduring the summer months; and after the top decays in the autumn, to\r\nbe earthed up by the plough for the winter, each year, till the plants\r\nare three years old, when they are of the proper size and age for\r\nlifting, which must be done by trenching the land two feet\r\ndeep--several hands accompanying the digger to pick out the roots,\r\nwhich must be thoroughly cleaned and dried on a kiln till they are so\r\nbrittle as to break across, when they are fit to be packed in bags,\r\nand sold to the dye-stuff manufacturers who grind and reduce them to\r\npowder for use. The produce is variable; usually from eight to twenty\r\ncwt. per acre, but as much as 3,000 to 6,000 lbs. is frequently\r\nobtained. The forage amounts to about 15,000 lbs. the first year, and\r\n7,500 lbs. the second year. In a new and good soil manure may be\r\ndispensed with for the first crop. Some cultivators interline and grow\r\nother crops between the rows, but the best cultivators state that such\r\na practice is objectionable. The breadth of land under this crop in\r\nEngland is much reduced, in consequence of the reduction in price from\r\nthe competition of the Dutch growers.\r\n\r\nMadder is extensively grown on the central table land of Afghanistan,\r\nforming one of the leading products of Beloochistan.; and, according\r\nto Mr. Pottinger, it sells in the Kelat Bazaar at about 10 lbs. for\r\n2s. The cultivation there pursued is as follows:--The ground is\r\nrepeatedly ploughed, and laid out finally in small trenches, in which\r\nthe seed is sown, covered slightly with earth, and then the whole is\r\nflooded. Whilst thus irrigated, the trenches are filled with a mixture\r\nof rich manure and earth. The plants appear in about ten days, and\r\nattain a height of three or four feet during the first summer. They\r\nare cut down in September and used as fodder for cattle. Subsequently,\r\nand until spring arrives, the ground is manured and repeatedly\r\nflooded. During the second year's growth, the plants which are\r\nintended to produce seed are set apart, but the stems of the remainder\r\nare cut every four or six weeks, in order to increase the size and\r\ngoodness of the roots.\r\n\r\nMadder is said to repay a nett profit of 200 dollars to the acre,\r\nwhen properly managed. It produced on the farm of a gentleman, who\r\nhas devoted some attention to this product in Ohio, at the rate of\r\n2,000 lbs. per acre, and it may be made to produce 3,000 lbs., which\r\nis a greater yield than the average crops of Germany and Holland. Nine\r\nacres were planted by another person in the United States, in 1839,\r\nwhich he harvested in 1842. The labor required is said to be from 80\r\nto 100 days work per acre.\r\n\r\nIn the third year the stems are pruned as in the two preceding, and in\r\nSeptember the roots are dug up. The roots are fusiform and thin,\r\nwithout any ramifications, and usually from three to five feet long.\r\nAs soon as raised, they are immediately cut into small pieces and\r\ndried, and are then merchantable.\r\n\r\nMr. Joseph Swift, an enterprising American farmer, of Erie county,\r\nOhio, who occupies about 400 acres of choice land, mostly alluvial, in\r\nthe valley of the Vermilion river, seven miles from Lake Erie, has\r\ndetailed his practice in the \"New Genesee Farmer\" (an agricultural\r\nperiodical), for March, 1843. His directions must be understood as\r\nintended for those who wish to cultivate only a few acres, and cannot\r\nafford much outlay of capital. Those who desire to engage in the\r\nbusiness on an extensive scale, would need to adopt a somewhat\r\ndifferent practice:--\r\n\r\n    _Soil and preparation._--\" The soil should be a deep, rich, sandy\r\n    loam, free from weeds, roots, stones, &c., containing a good portion\r\n    of vegetable earth. Alluvial \"bottom\" land is the most suitable, but\r\n    it must not be wet. If old upland is used, it should receive a heavy\r\n    coating of vegetable earth, from decayed wood and leaves. The land\r\n    should be ploughed very deep in the fall, and early in the spring\r\n    apply about one hundred loads of well-rotted manure per acre, spread\r\n    evenly, and ploughed in deeply; then harrow till quite fine and free\r\n    from lumps. Next plough the land into beds four feet wide, leaving\r\n    alleys between three feet wide, then harrow the beds with a fine\r\n    light harrow, or rake them by hand, so as to leave them smooth and\r\n    even with the alleys; they are then ready for planting.\r\n\r\n    _Preparing sets and planting._--Madder sets or seed roots are best\r\n    selected when the crop is dug in the fall. The horizontal uppermost\r\n    roots (with eyes) are the kind to be used; these should be separated\r\n    from the bottom roots, and buried in sand in a cellar or pit. If not\r\n    done in the fall, the sets may be dug early in the spring, before\r\n    they begin to sprout. They should be cut or broken into pieces,\r\n    containing from two to five eyes each; _i.e._, three to four inches\r\n    long. The time for planting is as early in the spring as the ground\r\n    can be got in good order, and severe frosts are over, which in this\r\n    climate (America) is usually about the middle of April. With the\r\n    beds prepared as directed, stretch a line lengthwise the bed, and\r\n    with the corner of a hoe make a drill two inches deep along each\r\n    edge and down the middle, so as to give three rows to each bed,\r\n    about two feet apart. Into these drills drop the sets, ten inches\r\n    apart, covering them two inches deep. Eight or ten bushels of sets\r\n    are requisite for an acre.\r\n\r\n    _After culture._--As soon as the madder plants can be seen, the\r\n    ground should be carefully hoed, so as to destroy the weeds and not\r\n    injure the plants; and the hoeing and weeding must be repeated as\r\n    often as weeds make their appearance. If any of the sets have failed\r\n    to grow, the vacancies should be filled by talking up parts of the\r\n    strongest roots and transplanting them; this is best done in June.\r\n    As soon as the madder plants are ten or twelve inches high, the tops\r\n    are to be bent down on the surface of the ground, and all except the\r\n    tip end covered with earth, shovelled from the middle of the alleys.\r\n    Bend the shoots outward and inward in every direction, so as in time\r\n    to fill all the vacant space on the beds, and about one foot on each\r\n    side. After the first time covering, repeat the weeding when\r\n    necessary, and run a single horse plough through the alleys several\r\n    times to keep the earth clean and mellow. As soon as the plants\r\n    again become ten or twelve inches high, bend down and cover them as\r\n    before, repeating the operation as often as necessary, which is\r\n    commonly three times the first season. The last time may be as late\r\n    as September, or later if no frosts occur. By covering the tops in\r\n    this manner, they change to roots, and the design is to fill the\r\n    ground as full of roots as possible. When the vacant spaces are all\r\n    full, there is but little chance for weeds to grow; but all that\r\n    appear must be pulled out.\r\n\r\n    _The second year._--Keep the beds free from weeds; plough the alleys\r\n    and cover the tops, as before directed, two or three times during\r\n    the season. The alleys will now form deep and narrow ditches, and if\r\n    it becomes difficult to obtain good earth for covering the tops,\r\n    that operation may be omitted after the second time this season.\r\n    Care should be taken, when covering the tops, to keep the edges of\r\n    the beds as high as the middle; otherwise the water from heavy\r\n    showers will run off, and the crop suffer from drought.\r\n\r\n    _The third year._--Very little labor or attention is required. They\r\n    will now cover the whole ground. If any weeds are seen, they must be\r\n    pulled out; otherwise their roots will cause trouble when harvesting\r\n    the madder. The crop is sometimes dug the third year; and if the\r\n    soil and cultivation have been good, and the seasons warm and\r\n    favorable, the madder will be of a good quality; but generally it is\r\n    much better in quality, and more in quantity, when left until the\r\n    fourth year.\r\n\r\n    _Digging and harvesting._--This should be done between the 20th of\r\n    August and the 20th of September. Take a sharp shovel or shovels,\r\n    and cut off and remove the tops with half an inch of the surface of\r\n    the earth; then take a plough of the largest size, with a sharp\r\n    coulter and a double team, and plough a furrow outward, beam-deep,\r\n    around the edge of the bed; stir the earth with forks, and carefully\r\n    pick out all the roots, removing the earth from the bottom of the\r\n    furrow; then plough another furrow beam-deep, as before, and pick\r\n    over and remove the earth in the same manner; thus proceeding until\r\n    the whole is completed.\r\n\r\n    _Washing and drying._--As soon as possible after digging, take the\r\n    roots to some running stream to be washed. If there is no running\r\n    stream convenient, it can be done at a pump. Take large round\r\n    sieves, two-and-a-half or three feet in diameter, with the wire\r\n    about as fine as wheat sieves; or if these cannot be had, get from a\r\n    hardware store sufficient screen wire of the right fineness, and\r\n    make frames or boxes, two-and-a-half feet long and the width of the,\r\n    wire, on the bottom of which nail the wire. In these sieves or\r\n    boxes, put half a bushel of roots at a time, and stir them about in\r\n    the water, pulling the branches apart so as to wash them clean;\r\n    then, having a platform at hand, lay them onto dry. (To make the\r\n    platform, take two or three common boards, so as to be about four\r\n    feet in width, and nail deals across the under side). On these\r\n    spread the roots about two inches thick for drying in the sun. Carry\r\n    the platforms to a convenient place, not far from the house, and\r\n    place them side by side, in rows east and west, and with their ends\r\n    north and south, leaving room to walk between the rows. Elevate the\r\n    south ends of the platforms about eighteen inches, and the north\r\n    ends about six inches from the ground, putting poles or sticks to\r\n    support them--this will greatly facilitate drying. After the second\r\n    or third day's drying, the madder must be protected from the dews at\r\n    night, and from rain, by placing the platforms one upon another to a\r\n    convenient height, and covering the uppermost one with board. Spread\r\n    them out again in the morning, or as soon as danger is over. Five or\r\n    six days of ordinarily fine weather will dry the madder\r\n    sufficiently, when it may be put away till it is convenient to\r\n    kiln-dry and grind it.\r\n\r\n    _Kiln-drying,_--The size and mode of constructing the kiln may be\r\n    varied to suit circumstances. The following is a very cheap plan,\r\n    and sufficient to dry one ton of roots at a time. Place four strong\r\n    posts in the ground, twelve feet apart one way, and eighteen the\r\n    other; the front two fourteen feet high, and the other eighteen; put\r\n    girts across the bottom, middle, and top, and nail boards\r\n    perpendicularly on the outside as for a common barn. The boards\r\n    must be well seasoned, and all cracks or holes should be plastered\r\n    or otherwise stopped up. Make a shed-roof of common boards. In the\r\n    inside put upright standards about five feet apart, with\r\n    cross-pieces to support the scaffolding. The first cross-pieces to\r\n    be four feet from the floor; the next two feet higher, and so on to\r\n    the top. On these cross-pieces lay small poles, about six feet long\r\n    and two inches thick, four or fire inches apart. On these scaffolds\r\n    the madder is to be spread nine inches thick. A floor is laid at the\r\n    bottom to keep all dry and clean. When the kiln is filled, take six\r\n    or eight small kettles or hand-furnaces, and place them four or five\r\n    feet apart on the floor (first securing it from fire with bricks or\r\n    stones), and make fires in them with charcoal, being careful not to\r\n    make any of the fires so large as to scorch the madder over them. A\r\n    person must be in constant attendance to watch and replenish the\r\n    fires. The heat will ascend through the whole, and in ten or twelve\r\n    hours it will all be sufficiently dried, which is known by its\r\n    becoming brittle like pipe stems.\r\n\r\n    _Breaking and grinding._--Immediately after being dried, the madder\r\n    must be taken to the barn and threshed with flails, or broken by\r\n    machinery (a mill might easily be constructed for this purpose), so\r\n    that it will feed in a common grist-mill. If it is not broken and\r\n    ground immediately, it will gather dampness so as to prevent its\r\n    grinding freely. Any common grist-mill can grind madder properly.\r\n    When ground finely it is fit for use, and may be packed in barrels\r\n    like flour for market.\r\n\r\n    _Amount and value of product, &c._--Mr. Swift measured off a part of\r\n    his ground, and carefully weighed the product when dried, which he\r\n    found to be over two thousand pounds per acre, notwithstanding the\r\n    seasons were mostly dry and unfavorable. With his present knowledge\r\n    of the business, he is confident that he can obtain at least three\r\n    thousand pounds per acre, which is said to be more than is often\r\n    obtained in Germany. The whole amount of labor he estimates at from\r\n    eighty to one hundred days' work per acre. The value of the crop, at\r\n    the usual wholesale price (about fifteen cents per pound), from\r\n    three to four hundred dollars. In foreign countries it is customary\r\n    to make several qualities of the madder, which is done by sorting\r\n    the roots; but as only one quality is required for the western\r\n    market, Mr. Swift makes but one, and that is found superior to most\r\n    of the imported, and finds a ready sale.\r\n\r\nMadder is produced in Middle Egypt to some extent, for the consumption\r\nof the country, principally for dyeing the _tarbouche_ or skull caps\r\nwhich are universally worn. Its culture was introduced in 1825. In\r\n1833, 300 acres in Upper Egypt, and 500 in the Delta and the Kelyout,\r\nwere devoted to madder roots.\r\n\r\nNew South Wales is eminently suited to the culture of this valuable\r\nroot, and as the profits upon its cultivation are very large, I would\r\nstrongly recommend it to the attention of agriculturists there. The\r\narticle produces to France an annual sum of one million sterling; the\r\nprice of the finest quality in the English market being £60 per ton.\r\nIts yield varies from £40 to £50 per acre, and the expenses upon its\r\nproper culture should not exceed one-half that amount. The colonists\r\nwould find it to their interest to turn their attention to such\r\narticles as this, for which there is an extensive demand at home,\r\ninstead of confining themselves exclusively to the commoner and\r\nbulkier products, which they export at a much less profit, and which\r\nwhen once the market is fully supplied, may fall to a price at which\r\nthey cannot afford to sell.\r\n\r\nThe following is a calculation of the expenses generally supposed to\r\nattend a crop according to the mode of cultivation practised in\r\nVaucluse:--\r\n\r\n  Rent per hectare (2½ English acres), 3 years, at                 £ s. d.\r\n             165 francs                                           19 17  6\r\n  Manure, 440 francs                                   £17 12  6\r\n  Carriage of ditto, 132 francs                          3  5 10\r\n                                                       ---------  22 18  4\r\n                                                                 ---------\r\n                                                                 £42 15 10\r\n\r\nThese expenses may almost be dispensed with in our colonies, as the\r\nsoil at Vaucluse has long been exhausted.\r\n\r\n  Two and a-half acres require 170 lbs. seed, at 2½d. per pound,\r\n  which, with the labor afterwards bestowed, including the\r\n  cost of spade trenching, will be                                30  0  0\r\n                                                                 ---------\r\n                                                                 £72 15 10\r\n\r\nThe average produce per hectare is 77 cwt., which, at £1 4s. 2d. per\r\ncwt. (the price on the spot), is £93. The price is now much lower, but\r\nstill it is clear a most profitable return would be derived from the\r\nfirst crop, and a proportionably larger one afterwards.\r\n\r\nA considerable portion of the madder roots, instead of being ground\r\nand exported in that form, as heretofore, is now exposed, after being\r\ninvested with dilute sulphuric acid, to a boiling heat by means of\r\nsteam, by which the coloring matter is considerably altered and\r\nimproved in quality for some dyeing processes, while the quantity\r\nrendered soluble in water is greatly increased. The madder so prepared\r\nis known as \"garancine,\" and forms an important branch of manufacture\r\nin the south of France, which was well illustrated at the Great\r\nExhibition in 1851, by a collection of specimens supplied by the\r\nChamber of Commerce of Avignon. The spent madder, after being used in\r\ndyeing, is now also converted by Mr. H. Steiner, of Accrington, into a\r\ngarancine (termed _garanceuse_ by the French) by steaming it with\r\nsulphuric acid in the same manner as the fresh madder, and thus a\r\nconsiderable quantity of coloring matter is recovered and made\r\navailable which was formerly thrown away in the spent madder. Both\r\nvarieties of garancine give a more scarlety red than the unprepared\r\nmadder, and also good chocolate and black, without soiling the white\r\nground, but are not so well fitted, particularly the garancine of\r\nspent madder, for dyeing purples, lilacs, and pinks. The value of the\r\ngarancine imported from France in 1848 was £59,554, and of that\r\nimported in 1851 £93,818. This preparation of ground madder is\r\nimported into Liverpool to the extent of from 500 to 600 tons annually\r\nfrom Marseilles, for the use of calico printers in the manufacturing\r\ndistricts. The price is £7 to £8 the ton.\r\n\r\nThis important root is already cultivated to a considerable extent in\r\nRussia but not nearly in sufficient quantity to meet the local demand;\r\nso that large quantities are imported from Holland and elsewhere,\r\nevery year.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of madder, madder-root, and garaneine annually imported\r\ninto the United Kingdom is exceedingly large, over 15,000 tons, as is\r\nshown by a reference to the following figures:--\r\n\r\n          Madder.

A small quantity is\r\nexported from China and India; about 338 Indian maunds were shipped\r\nfrom Calcutta in 1840, and 2,328 in 1841. It fetches in the London and\r\nLiverpool markets from 20s. to 25s. and 30s. per cwt., duty free; 405\r\ntons were imported into Liverpool from Bombay and Calcutta, in 1849,\r\nand 525 tons in 1850, but none was imported in 1851 and 1852.\r\n\r\nIt was remarked by the Jury in 1851, at the Great Exhibition, that\r\nthis is a valuable dye-stuff, and hitherto not so well appreciated as\r\nit deserves, for some of the colors dyed with it are quite as\r\npermanent as those dyed with madder, and even more brilliant. Its use\r\nhowever is gradually increasing, and it is unquestionably well worthy\r\nthe attention of dyers.\r\n\r\nLOGWOOD.--The logwood of commerce is the red heart wood, or duramen,\r\nof a fine lofty growing tree (_Haematroxylon Campechianum_), growing\r\nin Campeachy and the bay of Honduras, and which is also now common in\r\nthe woods of Jamaica and St. Domingo. It is principally imported as a\r\ndye wood, cut into short lengths. We chip, grind, and pack it into\r\ncasks and bags, ready for the dyers, hatters, and printers' use, who\r\nesteem it as affording the most durable deep red and black dyes. It is\r\nsometimes used in medicine as an astringent. That grown in Jamaica is\r\nleast valued that of Honduras, Tobasco, and St. Domingo, fetches a\r\nsomewhat higher price; but that imported from Campeachy direct, is the\r\nmost esteemed. The annual imports into Liverpool are about 1,300 tons\r\nfrom Honduras, 100 from Tobasco, and 1,800 from Campeachy.\r\n\r\nIt thrives best in a damp tenacious soil, with a small proportion of\r\nsand. It is imported in logs, which are afterwards chipped, and is of\r\ngreat commercial importance from its valuable dyeing properties. Old\r\nwood is preferred; it is so hard as almost to be indestructible by\r\nthe atmosphere. The albumen is of a yellowish color, and is not\r\nimported. The bark and wood are slightly astringent. The imports of\r\nlogwood into the United Kingdom, were 23,192 tons in 1848, 23,996 tons\r\nin 1849, and 34,090 tons in 1850, of which 3,484 tons were re-exported\r\nin 1848, and 2,307 tons in 1849. The imports in the past two years of\r\n1852 and 1853, have averaged 20,000 tons, of which about 3,000 tons\r\nwere re-exported. It is increasing in use, for in 1837, the quantity\r\nretained for home use was only 14,677½ tons. The price varies\r\naccording to quality from £4 to £7 per ton.\r\n\r\nWe received from Honduras 5,401 tons in 1844; and 55,824 tons in 1845.\r\nFrom Montego Bay, Jamaica, 398 tons were shipped between January and\r\nJuly 1851.\r\n\r\nFUSTIC.--This is the common name of a species of dye wood in extensive\r\nuse, which is obtained from _Maclura tinctoria_, or _Broussonitia\r\ntinctoria_, Kunth, a large and handsome evergreen tree, growing in\r\nSouth America and the West Indies. The wood is extensively used as an\r\ningredient in the dyeing of yellow, and is largely imported for that\r\npurpose. The quantity entered for home consumption in the United\r\nKingdom was 1,731 tons in 1847, 1,653 in 1848, and 1,842 tons in 1849.\r\n\r\nNinety-one tons were shipped from Montego Bay, Jamaica, in the first\r\nsix months of 1851.\r\n\r\nQUERCITRON.---This bark furnishes a yellow dye, of which about 3,500\r\ntons are annually imported in hogsheads of from half a ton to a ton.\r\n296 tons were imported into Liverpool from Philadelphia in 1849, and\r\n514 tons in 1850.\r\n\r\nBRAZIL WOOD.--This very ponderous wood is obtained in Brazil from the\r\n_Cæsalpina Braziliensis_, which yields a red or crimson dye, when\r\nunited with alum or tartar, and is used by silk dyers. It is imported\r\nprincipally from Pernambuco, 1,200 quintals having been shipped to\r\nLondon in 1835, but about 500 tons, worth about £4 a ton, were\r\nimported from Costa Rica in 1845.\r\n\r\nThe tree is large, crooked, and knotty, and the bark is thick, and\r\nequals the third or fourth of its diameter.\r\n\r\nThe imports may be stated at about 600 tons annually, the average\r\nprice being £50 per ton.\r\n\r\nBrazil wood is found in the greatest abundance and of the best\r\nquality, in the Province of Pernambuco, but being a government\r\nmonopoly it has been cut down in so improvident a manner, that it is\r\nnow seldom seen within several leagues of the coast.\r\n\r\nAmong the Cuba dye woods is Copey _(Clusia rosea_, Linn).\r\n\r\nBraziletto, obtained from _C. Crista_, is one of the cheapest and\r\nleast esteemed of the red dye woods, imported from Jamaica and other\r\nWest India islands to the extent of 150 tons per annum, fetching £6 to\r\n£8 per ton. 2,361 tons of Nicaragua wood were imported in 1848, 2,701\r\ntons in 1849, and 6,130 tons in 1850.\r\n\r\nSpain exhibited various vegetable dyes obtained from cultivated and\r\nwild plants furnished by the Agricultural Board of Saragossa.\r\n\r\n\r\nLICHENS.\r\n\r\nThe chief lichens employed in the manufacture of orchil and cudbear\r\nare the following:--\r\n\r\nAngola weed (_Ramalina furfuracea_).\r\n\r\nMauritius weed (_Rocella fusiformis_), which comes also from\r\nMadagascar, Lima, and Valparaiso, and then bears the distinctive\r\ncommercial name of the port of shipment.\r\n\r\nCape weed (_Rocella tinctoria_), from the Cape de Verd Islands.\r\n\r\nCanary Moss (_Parmelia perlata_).\r\n\r\nTartareous Moss (_Parmelia tartarea_).\r\n\r\nPustulatus Moss (_Umbilicaria pustulata_).\r\n\r\nVelvet Moss (_Gyrophora murina_).\r\n\r\nThe last three are imported from Sweden.\r\n\r\nOf these lichens, the first, which is the richest in coloring matter,\r\ngrows as a parasite upon trees; all the remainder upon rocks.\r\n\r\n_Rocella corallina_, _Variolaris lactea_ and _dealbata_, have been\r\nalso resorted to.\r\n\r\nAbout 130 tons of cudbear are imported annually from Sweden.\r\n\r\nThese lichens are found on rocks, on the sea coast. The modes, of\r\ntreating them for the manufacture of the different dyes is the same in\r\nprinciple, though varying slightly in detail. They are carefully\r\ncleaned and ground into a pulp with water, an ammoniacal liquor is\r\nfrom time to time added, and the mass constantly stirred in order to\r\nexpose it as much as possible to the air. Peculiar substances existing\r\nin these plants are, during this process, so changed by the combined\r\naction of the atmosphere, water, and ammonia, as to generate the\r\ncoloring matter, which, when perfect, is pressed out, and gypsum,\r\nchalk, or other substances, are then added, so as to give it the\r\ndesired consistency; these are then prepared for the market under the\r\nforms of cudbear or litmus.\r\n\r\nHENNA (_Lawsonia inermis_), is an important dye-stuff, and the\r\ndistilled water of the flowers is used as a perfume. The Mahomedan\r\nwomen in India use the shoots for dyeing their nails red, and the same\r\npractice prevails in Arabia. In these countries the manes and tails of\r\nthe horses are stained red in the same manner. The _Genista tomentosa_\r\nyields red petals used in dyeing, and containing much tannic acid.\r\n\r\nORCHILLA WEED.--The fine purple color which the orchilla weed yields,\r\nis in use as an agent for coloring, staining, and dyeing. About 30,000\r\nlbs. is obtained annually in the island of Teneriffe. 460 arrobas (or\r\n115 cwt.) of orchilla were exported from the Canary Isles in 1833. In\r\n1839, 6,494 cwts. paid duty, and 4,175 cwts. in 1840. The average\r\nimports of the three years ending with 1842, was 6,050 cwt. A little\r\ncomes in from Barbary and the islands of the Archipelago.\r\n\r\nDr. W.L. Lindley, in a very interesting paper, read before the\r\nBotanical Society of London, in December, 1852, on the dyeing\r\nproperties of the lichens, stated--\r\n\r\n    The subject of the _colorific_ and _coloring_ principles of the\r\n    lichen has, within the last few years, attracted a due share of that\r\n    attention which, has been increasingly devoted to organic chemistry.\r\n    Since 1830, Heeren, Kane, Schunck, Rochleder and Heldt, Knop,\r\n    Stenhouse, Laurent and Gerhardt, have published valuable papers on\r\n    these principles; but, here again, we have to regret the great\r\n    discrepancy in the various results obtained, and there is therefore,\r\n    here also, imperatively demanded re-investigation and correction\r\n    before _any_ of the results already published can he implicitly\r\n    relied upon, and before we can have safe data from which to\r\n    generalise. I have no doubt that a great proportion of the obscurity\r\n    overhanging this subject depends on the circumstance that many of\r\n    the chemists, who have devoted attention to the color-educts and\r\n    products of the lichens, were not themselves botanists, and have\r\n    therefore probably, in some cases at least, analysed species under\r\n    erroneous names, and also because their investigations have\r\n    comprehended a much too limited number of species.\r\n\r\n    Their utility in the arts, and especially in dyeing--including the\r\n    collection of a series of the commercial dye lichens, _i.e._, those\r\n    used by the manufacturers of London, &c., in the making of orchil,\r\n    cudbear, litmus, and other lichen dyes. While investigating the\r\n    dyeing properties of the lichens, I made experiments, with a view to\r\n    test their colorific power, on as many species as I could obtain in\r\n    sufficient quantity, to render it at all useful to operate on--that\r\n    number, however, being very limited (between forty and fifty).\r\n\r\n    Dr. Lindley adds, many parties may be able to aid his\r\n    investigations, by furnishing information on their economic uses,\r\n    and on their special applications in dyeing and other\r\n    arts--(particularly on their employment, as dye agents, by the\r\n    natives of Britain and other countries)--with specimens of the\r\n    lichens so used, and their common names--specimens of fabrics dyed\r\n    therewith--notes of the processes employed for the elimination of\r\n    the dyes, &c. Parties resident in, or travelling through our western\r\n    Highlands and Islands, the northern Highlands, Ireland, Wales,\r\n    Norway, Iceland, and similar countries, are most likely to be able\r\n    to afford this description of information--many native lichens being\r\n    still used by the peasantry of these countries to dye their homespun\r\n    yarn, &c.\r\n\r\n    He proceeded to treat--1. The vast importance of this humble tribe\r\n    of plants in the grand economy of nature, as the pioneers and\r\n    founders of _all_ vegetation. 2. Their importance to man and the\r\n    lower animals, as furnishing various articles of food. 3. Their\r\n    importance in medicine, and especially in its past history, at home\r\n    and abroad. 4. Their importance in the useful and fine arts, and\r\n    especially in the art of dyeing. 5. Their affinities and analogies\r\n    to other cryptogamic families, and to the Phanerogamia. 6. Their\r\n    value as an element of the picturesque in nature; and, 7. Their\r\n    typical significance.\r\n\r\n    He then adverted more especially to the subject of his\r\n    communication, under the ten following heads:--\r\n\r\n   I. The colors of the Thallus and apothecia of Lichens--their causes, and\r\n      the circumstances which modify and alter them.\r\n\r\n  II. History of the application of their coloring matters to the art of dyeing.\r\n\r\n III. Chemical nature and general properties of these coloring matters.\r\n\r\n  IV. Tests and processes for estimating qualitatively, and quantitatively the\r\n      colorific powers of individual species--with their practical applications.\r\n\r\n   V. Processes of manufacture of the Lichen-dyes, on the large and small\r\n      scale in different countries--with the principles on which they are founded.\r\n\r\n  VI. Nomenclature of the dye-Lichens, and of the Lichen-dyes.\r\n\r\n VII. Botanical and commercial sources of the same.\r\n\r\nVIII. Special applications of the Lichen-dyes in the arts.\r\n\r\n  IX. Commercial value of the dye-Lichens, and their products.\r\n\r\n   X. Geographical distribution of the dye-Lichens--with the effect of climate;\r\n      situation, &c., on their colorific materials.\r\n\r\n    Of the four first sections of his paper, the following is a very\r\n    short summary or synopsis:--\r\n\r\n    Under the first head, the author spoke of chlorophylle and various\r\n    organic and inorganic substances, which enter into the formation of\r\n    the colors of the thallus and apothecia of lichens, and of the\r\n    modifications of these colors depending on various degrees of--1.\r\n    Exposure to air and light. 2. Temperature. 3. Moisture, &c. 4.\r\n    Atmospheric vicissitudes. 5. Season of the year. 6. Nature of the\r\n    Gonidic reproduction (_i.e._, gemmation). 7. Nature of habitat. 8.\r\n    Organic decomposition. 9. Coalescence of parts, monstrosities, &c.\r\n\r\n    Under the second section, he traced historically the manufacture of\r\n    Lichen-dyes, and the native use of Lichens as dye agents, among\r\n    different nations, from the times of Theophrastus, Dioscorides, and\r\n    Pliny, down to the present day, sketching briefly the ancient end\r\n    modern history of orchil, cudbear, and litmus, and specifying the\r\n    native use of lichen-dyes in different, countries of Europe, Asia,\r\n    and America. He alluded more particularly to their application to\r\n    the dyeing of yarns, &c., by the Scotch Highlanders, under the name\r\n    of \"_Crottles_.\" \"The process of the manufacture of the various\r\n    crottles, generally consisted in macerating the powdered lichen for\r\n    two or three weeks, in stale urine, exposing the mass freely to the\r\n    air by repeated stirring, and adding lime, salt, alum, or\r\n    argillaceous and other substances, either to heighten the color or\r\n    impart consistence. To such an extent did this custom at one time\r\n    prevail, that, in several of our northern counties each farm and\r\n    cottage had its tank or barrel of putrefying urine, a homely but\r\n    perfectly efficient mode of generating the necessary amount of\r\n    ammonia. In the county of Aberdeen, in particular, every homestead\r\n    had its reservoir of \"Graith,\"[53] and the \"Lit-pig,\"[54] which\r\n    stood by every fireside, was as familiar an article of furniture in\r\n    the cots of the peasantry, as the \"cuttie-stool,\" or the \"meal\r\n    girnel.\" So lately as 1841 (and I presume the practice continues to\r\n    the present day), Mr. Edmonston stated that, of four or five native\r\n    dyes, used by the Shetlanders to color cloth and yarns, two at least\r\n    were furnished by lichens, viz., a _brown dye_ from _Parmelia\r\n    saxatilis_, under the name of \"Scrottyie,\" and a _red_ one from\r\n    _Lecanora tartarea_, under that of \"Korkalett.\" It is very probable,\r\n    however, that steam and free trade have gradually dispelled this\r\n    good old custom, even in the remoter corners of our island;\r\n    machinery-made articles being now readily supplied, at a rate so\r\n    extraordinarily cheap, as to render it absolutely expensive (as to\r\n    time, if not also as to money) to prepare colors, even by a process\r\n    so simple and inexpensive as that just mentioned.\"\r\n\r\n    Under the third head, he examined, in a general way, the chemistry\r\n    of the colorific and coloring matters of the lichens and the results\r\n    to which it has led, avoiding as much as possible the technicalities\r\n    inseparable from such a subject, and giving a short _vise_ of the\r\n    researches of Heeren, Kane, Rochleder, and Heldt, Stenhouse,\r\n    Schunck, Laurent, and Gerhardt, and others. \"Our untaught senses\r\n    should undoubtedly lead us to expect the lichens, whose thallus\r\n    exhibits the brightest tints, to yield the finest dyes, and these,\r\n    too, of a color similar to that of the thallus, but experience\r\n    teaches us that the beautiful reddish or purplish coloring-matters\r\n    are producible in the greatest abundance by the very species from\r\n    which we should least expect to derive any, viz., in those most\r\n    devoid of external color. This, though at first sight very\r\n    remarkable, is easily explicable, when we remember that, in most of\r\n    the so-called dye-lichens, colorific principles exist in a colorless\r\n    form, and only become converted into colored substances under a\r\n    peculiar combination of circumstances.\r\n\r\n    \"Some lichens contain coloring matters, ready formed, and these\r\n    exhibit themselves in the tint of the thallus of the plants, _e.g._\r\n    chrysophanic [or parietinic] acid in _Parmelia parietina_, and\r\n    vulpinic acid in _Evernia vulpina_. In other species we find\r\n    principles, which, while in the plant, and unacted on by chemical\r\n    re-agents, are colorless, but which, when the lichens are exposed to\r\n    the combined influence of atmospheric air, water, and ammonia, yield\r\n    colored substances. This series of colored products is usually\r\n    comprehended more for convenience sake than on account of chemical\r\n    identity, under the generic term orceine.\"\r\n\r\n    The whole subject of the chemistry of these bodies is at present in\r\n    a most unsatisfactory condition, demanding fresh investigation and\r\n    research, in illustration of which, the author exhibited tables of\r\n    the colorific and coloring principles, so far as they are at present\r\n    known, showing their chemical formulæ and the authority therefor,\r\n    and various relative information. \"It is highly probable that when\r\n    the chemistry of the lichens has been more fully studied, and the\r\n    whole subject of their color-educts and products better understood,\r\n    we shall begin to reduce the present confused mass of complex\r\n    substances, and find the same principles more extensively diffused\r\n    through different lichen species.\" Dr. L. entered somewhat minutely\r\n    on the chemical reactions of the better known colorific and coloring\r\n    principles, and their derivatives, so far at least as these throw\r\n    any light on the production and transmutation of the red or purple\r\n    colors extracted from what may be termed _par excellence_, the\r\n    _dye-lichens_. After a few remarks on the chemical constitution of\r\n    orchil and litmus, as given by Kane, Gelis, Pereira, and others, he\r\n    discussed the subject of decolorisation of weak infusions of orchil\r\n    and litmus by exclusion of atmospheric air, and by various\r\n    deoxidising agents, and the different theories as to the causation\r\n    of this phenomenon. \"I have repeatedly had occasion to notice that,\r\n    when weak infusions of these substances are excluded for some time\r\n    from atmospheric air, in a bottle, with a tightly fitting cork, they\r\n    gradually lose color, but rapidly regain it on re-exposure. It is\r\n    curious that both orchil and litmus are what are called transient or\r\n    false colors, _i.e._, they slowly lose their bloom and tint by long\r\n    exposure to the atmosphere; the coloring matter, therefore, appears\r\n    to be decolorised both by exposure to, and exclusion from the air,\r\n    phenomena apparently of very opposite characters. The cause of the\r\n    latter phenomenon has never, so far as I am aware, been quite\r\n    satisfactorily explained; but it has been variously supposed to be\r\n    due:--\r\n\r\n    1. To the mere negation of oxygen.\r\n\r\n    2. To the development, in the liquids, of various substances,\r\n    capable of exerting a decolorising influence on the coloring matter.\r\n\r\n    3. To deoxidation of the coloring matter by substances, which have a\r\n    great tendency to become oxidised or peroxised; _e.g._ hydrogen, in\r\n    the case of decolorisation by sulphuretted hydrogen, nascent\r\n    hydrogen, and the protoxides of iron and tin, &c.\r\n\r\n    4. To the fixation of an additional amount of hydrogen in a new\r\n    colorless body, formed by the union of the sulphuretted hydrogen or\r\n    other substances with the coloring matter of the liquid. This view\r\n    is chiefly supported by Kane, who says, \"that precisely as the\r\n    coloring matters combine with water, to form different shades of\r\n    red-colored bodies--with ammonia to produce a series of bodies,\r\n    which are blue and purple--so they combined with sulphuretted\r\n    hydrogen to form colorless compounds in solution, which, if solid,\r\n    very probably would be white.\" He supposes, in a word, that for\r\n    every colored substance existing in orchil and litmus, there is a\r\n    corresponding white one, producible by the action of sulphuretted\r\n    hydrogen, &c.; and, in proof of this theory, he mentions having\r\n    obtained from Azolitmine and Betaorceine colorless bodies, to which\r\n    he gave the respective names of Leuco-litmine and Leuco-orceine.\r\n\r\n    The author then gave a short summary of Dr. Westring's experiments\r\n    on the dyeing powers of the Swedish lichens, which he found might be\r\n    conveniently divided into four classes, according to the degree of\r\n    heat employed in their maceration, viz.:--\r\n\r\n    1. Lichens, whose coloring matter was easily extractable by _cold_\r\n    water alone.\r\n\r\n    2. Those which required for the elimination of their coloring\r\n    matter, maceration in _tepid_ water (_i.e._ below 258 degs. Swedish\r\n    thermometer).\r\n\r\n    3. Those which required maceration in _warm_ water (_i.e._between 50\r\n    and 60 degs. Swedish thermometer).\r\n\r\n    4. Those requiring _boiling_ water alone, or with the aid of\r\n    solvents.\r\n\r\n    \"It must be admitted that our knowledge of the true nature of the\r\n    colorofic and coloring principles of the lichens is, as yet, very\r\n    imperfect and confused, and one great cause of the dubity and\r\n    obscurity overhanging the subject, is the fact that different\r\n    analysts have arrived at most opposite results, even in the\r\n    examination of the same species. For instance, in _Rocella\r\n    tinctoria_, which has, of all the dye-Lichens, been most frequently\r\n    selected for analytical investigation, on account of its important\r\n    product orchil, the discrepancies between the results obtained are\r\n    very striking. In it Heeren discovered his _Erythrine_; Kane his\r\n    _Erythriline_; Schunk his _Erythric acid_; and Stenhouse three\r\n    different substances in as many varieties of the plant; all of these\r\n    bodies differing more or less from each other in composition and\r\n    properties (at least, if we are to assume, as correct, the\r\n    descriptions given of them by their respective discoverers\").\r\n\r\n    \"I have already hinted that there is no ratio between the external\r\n    and internal color or structure of a lichen, and the kind or amount\r\n    of coloring matter it will be found to yield. It is exceedingly\r\n    natural to suppose that such a ratio should exist; but, proceeding\r\n    for some time on this supposition, I was frequently disappointed in\r\n    my results--the most showy and brilliantly colored lichens often\r\n    furnishing the dullest and most worthless colors. For instance, the\r\n    bright yellow thallus of _Parmelia parietina_, and the beautiful\r\n    scarlet apothecia of _Scyphophorus cocciferus_, instead of producing\r\n    a rich yellow in the one case, and a deep crimson in the other,\r\n    yielded, respectively, only dirty greenish-yellow and brownish\r\n    colors. As a general rule I should almost be inclined to say that\r\n    the finer the color of the thallus of any given lichen, the more is\r\n    that lichen to be suspected of poverty in valuable coloring matters;\r\n    and that, on the other hand, the palest pulverulent or crustaceous\r\n    species, especially such as are saxicolous, may be expected to yield\r\n    the most beautiful and valuable pigments (_e.g._ the Rocellas and\r\n    Lecanoras). In such circumstances it is necessary to have some test,\r\n    of easy applicability, of the kind and amount of colorific\r\n    properties of any lichen, and this fortunately is readily\r\n    attainable.\"\r\n\r\n    The fourth section of the paper was devoted to the consideration of\r\n    the various tests of colorific power, which have been recommended by\r\n    different authors. \"Of these, the greater number proceed on the\r\n    principle of developing the coloring matter by some alkali, in\r\n    conjunction with the decomposing action of atmospheric oxygen and\r\n    water; others are founded on the reaction between colorific\r\n    principles of certain of the dye lichens and some of our ordinary\r\n    chemical re-agents.\" The author noticed in particular--\r\n\r\n    1.  Helot's test,      }\r\n    2.  Westring's tests,  }qualitative.\r\n    3.  Stenhouse's test,  }\r\n    4.             \"        quantitative.\r\n\r\n    Helot's test consists in digesting the dried and powdered lichen or\r\n    a few hours, at a temperature of 130 degs., in a weak solution of\r\n    ammonia, sufficiently strong, however, to be tolerably pungent. One\r\n    that is fit for the dyer will yield a rich violet red liquor.\r\n\r\n    Dr. Westring recommended simply macerating three or four drachms of\r\n    the lichen in cool spring water, assisting, perhaps, the solvent\r\n    action of the water by minute quantities of common salt, nitre,\r\n    quicklime, sulphate of copper or iron, or similar re-agents. If\r\n    these means failed, after a sufficient length of time had been\r\n    allowed for the development of color, he digested a fresh portion of\r\n    the pulverised lichen in water, containing small quantities of\r\n    sal-ammoniac and quicklime [in the proportion of 25 parts of water,\r\n    1-10th lime, and 1-20th sal-ammoniac for every part of lichen], for\r\n    a period varying from eight to fourteen days, and by this process,\r\n    he says, he never failed to develop all the color which the plant\r\n    was capable of yielding.\r\n\r\n    Dr. Stenhouse, of London, one of our latest and best authorities on\r\n    the chemistry of the lichens, adds to an alcoholic infusion of the\r\n    lichen, a solution of common bleaching powder (chloride of lime),\r\n    whereby, if it contain certain colorific principles capable of\r\n    developing, under the joint action of air, water, and ammonia, red\r\n    coloring matters, a fugitive but distinct _blood-red color_ will be\r\n    exhibited. The amount of this colorific matter may be estimated\r\n    quantitatively by noting the quantity of the chloride of lime\r\n    solution required to destroy this blood-red color in different\r\n    cases: or the same result may be obtained by macerating for a short\r\n    period in milk of lime--filtering--precipitating the filtered liquor\r\n    by acetic or muriatic acid--collecting this precipitate on a weighed\r\n    filter--drying at ordinary temperatures and again weighing.\r\n\r\n    The author entered into a full analysis of these tests and\r\n    processes--pointing out their respective advantages and\r\n    disadvantages--and showing their practical value and applications.\r\n    He stated that he had made use of these, and various other tests, in\r\n    upwards of 300 experiments, and the one which he employed to the\r\n    greatest extent, because most uniformly applicable, was Helot's\r\n    ammonia test. The following combination is that most favorable for\r\n    the development of the coloring matter of the lichens--viz., the\r\n    presence\r\n\r\n    1.  Of _water_ as a solvent menstruum.\r\n    2.  Of  atmospheric _oxygen_.\r\n    3.  Of _ammonia_, in the state of vapor or in solution, and\r\n    4.  Of a moderate degree of _heat_;\r\n\r\n    And according as the proportion of these combining elements varies,\r\n    so do the kind and amount of color educed by them. This combination\r\n    is the foundation of all the processes for the manufacture of the\r\n    lichen dyes throughout the world, however different these may appear\r\n    to be in detail or results.\r\n\r\n    I believe it may come to be a matter of great commercial importance\r\n    to discover, at home or abroad, some cheap and easily-procurable\r\n    substitute for the _Roccellas_, which are gradually becoming scarce,\r\n    and consequently valuable in European commerce, having sometimes\r\n    fetched, in times of scarcity, no less than £1,000 per ton. No\r\n    plants can be so easily collected and preserved as\r\n    lichens--requiring merely to be cleaned, dried, pulverised, and\r\n    packed; and if their bulk be an objection to transport, their whole\r\n    colorific matter may be collected in the way I have already\r\n    mentioned. Ascending to the verge of eternal snows, and descending\r\n    to the ocean level--with a geographical diffusion that is\r\n    co-extensive with the surface of our earth, it is difficult to say\r\n    where lichens shall not be found. There are myriads of small rocky\r\n    islets in the boundless ocean, and there are thousands of miles of\r\n    barren rocky coast and sterile mountain range in every part of the\r\n    world, which, though at present unfit to bear any of the higher\r\n    members of the vegetable kingdom, are yet carpeted and adorned with\r\n    a rich covering of lichens, and of those very species too, which I\r\n    have already spoken of as prolific in colorific materials. I\r\n    sincerely believe, therefore, that a more general attention to the\r\n    very simple tests just enumerated, would ultimately result in a\r\n    greatly extended use of the lichens as dye agents. What renders it\r\n    very probable that efforts in this direction are likely to meet with\r\n    success is the great similarity of species found all over the world.\r\n    It has been repeatedly noticed that the European species, which, of\r\n    course, are best known, differ little from those of North America.\r\n    Dr. Robert Brown remarked the same fact with regard to New Holland\r\n    species, and Humboldt also recognised the similarity in natives of\r\n    the South American Andes. Of a large collection made by Professor\r\n    Royle, in the Himalayas, Don pronounced almost every one to be\r\n    identical with European species. From examining the raw vegetable\r\n    products, sent by different countries to the Great Exhibition of\r\n    1851, I am satisfied that, even now, there are many fields open for\r\n    the establishment of an export trade in _Roccellas_ and other\r\n    so-called orchella weeds.\" I there saw specimens of good dye lichens\r\n    from almost every part of the world, including our own young\r\n    colonies; and as a single instance of their probable value, I may\r\n    introduce here the copy of a note appended to a specimen of orchella\r\n    weed from the island of Socotra, contained in the Indian collection\r\n    of that exhibition, \"_abundant_, but _unknown_ as an article of use\r\n    or commerce. Also abundant on the hills around (Aden) and _might_ be\r\n    made an article of trade.\" Roccellas from this source are estimated\r\n    as worth £190 to £380 per ton. I believe that a similar statement\r\n    might be made with regard to the countless islands of the broad\r\n    Atlantic and Pacific, which may, at some future period, perhaps not\r\n    far distant, be found to be rich depots of orchella weeds, just as\r\n    some of them are, at present, rich fields of guano, and may, as\r\n    such, become new nuclei of British commerce and enterprise. Even at\r\n    home, in the immediate vicinity of Edinburgh, or, to restrict our\r\n    limits still more narrowly, within the compass of Arthur's Seat,\r\n    there are not a few very good dye-lichens, which require merely to\r\n    be scraped with an old knife or similar instrument, from the rocks\r\n    to which they adhere, and subjected to the ammonia process already\r\n    mentioned. Of twelve specimens thus collected at random one morning,\r\n    I found no less than three yielded beautiful purple-red colors,\r\n    apparently as fine as orchil or cudbear, while the others furnished\r\n    rich and dark tints of brownish-red, brown and olive-green.\r\n\r\n    Dr. Lindley's communication was illustrated with specimens of\r\n    coloring matters yielded by various lichens collected in the\r\n    neighbourhood of Edinburgh, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARKS FOR TANNING.\r\n\r\nLet us now take a brief review of the sources from whence tanning\r\nmaterials may be obtained, which will also enable us to form a fair\r\nestimate of the prospect of future supplies. Only one medal was\r\nawarded, at the Great Exhibition, for tanning substances, viz., to\r\nMessrs. Curtis, Brothers (United Kingdom, No. 126), but honorable\r\nmention was made of the following competitors:--One from Tunis, one\r\nfrom Van Diemen's Land, one from New Zealand, one from Belgium, one\r\nfrom the Cape of Good Hope, one from Canada, and one from the United\r\nKingdom.\r\n\r\nThe substance from which pure tannin is most frequently obtained for\r\nchemical purposes is nutgalls, for tannin constitutes above 40 per\r\ncent, of their weight. It may be procured also from several other\r\nsources, such as oak, horse chestnut, sumach, and cinchona barks,\r\ncatechu, kino, &c.\r\n\r\nThe basis of the skins of animals is composed of a substance to which\r\nthe name of gelatine is given. One of the properties of this substance\r\nis, that when combined with tannin, it forms the compound of tannate\r\nof gelatine, or leather, a substance which is so useful to mankind.\r\nFrom time immemorial, the substance employed to furnish the tannin to\r\nthe hides of animals, in order to convert them into leather, has been\r\noak bark. But as the purpose for which oaks are grown is their timber,\r\nand not their bark, the supply of oak bark cannot be calculated upon,\r\nand this is, perhaps, one of the causes why tanning as an art is in\r\nsuch a backward state.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of tannin required in the leather manufacture may be\r\nestimated from the fact that more than 672,000 cwts. of raw hides were\r\nimported in 1851, besides the hides of the cattle, &c., consumed in\r\nthe United Kingdom. On the Continent and in the United States the\r\nconsumption of bark for this purpose is also considerable.\r\n\r\nThe imports of bark for the use of tanners and dyers has amounted\r\nyearly to the very large quantity of 380,674 cwt., besides what we\r\nobtain at home. Oak bark contains usually the largest proportion of\r\ntannin, and according to Davy's experiments eight-and-a-half pounds of\r\noak bark are equivalent for tanning purposes to two-and-a-quarter of\r\ngalls, three of sumach, seven-and-a-half of Leicester willow, eleven\r\nof Spanish chesnut, eighteen of elm, and twenty-one of common willow\r\nbark. Tannin obtained from these sources, however, differs materially\r\nin some of its characters. The tannin of nutgalls, which is that\r\ngenerally employed for chemical purposes, is sometimes called\r\ngallo-tannic acid, to distinguish it from other species.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the number of different substances which have from\r\ntime to time been introduced for the use of tanners, it is,\r\nnevertheless, pretty generally acknowledged that there is nothing\r\nsuperior, or even equal, to good oak bark, and that all attempts to\r\nhurry the process beyond a certain point by the use of concentrated\r\nsolutions of tan, &c., are for the most part failures, as the\r\nmanufacture of good leather, to a great extent, depends on the process\r\nbeing conducted in a slow and gradual, but--at the same time--thorough\r\nand complete matter.\r\n\r\nOak bark is, however, by no means the only astringent bark well suited\r\nto the use of the tanner, and in various parts of the world other\r\nsimilar substances are used with very great success. All these tanning\r\nmaterials, though they may not be considered by the English tanner\r\nequal to the best oak bark, are, nevertheless, of great value to him;\r\nthey may be employed in conjunction with oak bark, or even as a\r\nsubstitute in times of scarcity, or when the price of oak bark is\r\nhigh; in fact the very existence of such substances tends to keep down\r\nand equalise the price of bark, and to prevent it from undergoing\r\nthose great fluctuations in value which would necessarily occur were\r\nit the only tanning material available to our manufacture--(\"Prof.\r\nSolly in Jury Reports of Great Exhibition.\")\r\n\r\nThere are a vast number of bark and other substances useful for\r\ntanning purposes, which are found in the tropics, that are\r\ncomparatively unknown or little regarded in Europe; but which might be\r\nreadily obtained in large quantities and at a trifling cost. The bark\r\nof many species of _Acacia_ furnishes the tanning principle in a great\r\ndegree, particularly that of _A. arabica_, which, under the name of\r\nBabul wood, is largely used about Scinde, Biliary, Gruzerat, and other\r\nparts of India; where it is regarded as a powerful tonic. The fruit of\r\n_A. vera_, termed Egyptian and Senegal \"bablah,\" has been employed in\r\ntanning and dyeing. Numerous species of this tribe are found abundant\r\nin New South Wales and the Cape Colony, and these, particularly the\r\nwattle bark of Australia, are in common use for tanning, from their\r\nastringent properties. The bark and rind of the fruit of the\r\npomegranate (_Pumica Granata_) have similar properties.\r\n\r\nThe bark of _Avicenna tomentosa_ is in great use in the Brazils for\r\ntanning. So are the curved pods of _Cæsalpinia Coriari_, in the East\r\nand West Indies, under the name of Divi-divi. _Coriaria myrtifolia_ is\r\nnot only used in tanning leather, but also for staining black. It is\r\nworth £9 to £10 per ton. _Pterocarpus marsupium_ furnishes about\r\nTellicherry the concrete exudation called kino, a powerful astringent\r\nused for tanning.\r\n\r\nThe plants of the mangrove tribe, _Rhizophora Mangle_, and other\r\nallied species, have frequently an astringent bark, which is in many\r\ncases used for tanning and dyeing black. This tree is very common in\r\nmost tropical countries, where it forms dense thickets on the muddy\r\nbanks of rivers and the sea shores. The bark of _Bauhinia variegata_,\r\nis made use of in Scinde and other parts of Asia. The bitter\r\nastringent bark and the galls of several of the Tamarisk tribe are\r\nalso well suited for the purpose.\r\n\r\n_Mesembryanthemum nodiflorum_, one of the numerous indigenous species\r\nof the Cape, is used in making morocco leather.\r\n\r\nThe extract procured from the bark of the _Butea_, that of the\r\n_Buchanania latifolia_, the _Scyzgium_ (_Calyptranthes_), _Jambolana_,\r\n&c., are likely to be of consequence to the tanners, and could be\r\nproduced in India in large quantities. Specimens of these, and of the\r\nbark of the Saul tree, of _Nychanthes arbortrista, Terminalia\r\nangustifolia_, and of the gaub fruit (_Diospyros glutinosa_), were\r\nshown by the East India Company. The bark of the hemlock tree is\r\nextensively employed for tanning in New Brunswick.\r\n\r\nThe bark of yellow hercules (_Xanthoxylum ochroxylon_), and the pods\r\nof _Acacia tortuosa_ are used for tanning in the West Indies.\r\n\r\nIn the instructions given by the Admiralty to Sir James Boss, when\r\nproceeding on his Antarctic Expedition, his attention was particularly\r\ncalled to the astringent substances adapted for tanning, and to the\r\nvarious extracts of barks, &c., imported into England from our\r\nAustralian settlements, and which are employed by the tanner. Little\r\nsterling information has as yet been obtained as to the qualities of\r\nthe astringent gums, barks, and dyes, yielded in such abundance by the\r\ntrees of those colonies, and the proportion of tannin they contained.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, 563 tons of bark for tanning were exported from Port Phillip.\r\n\r\nA large quantity of tannin is extracted from various species of\r\nEucalyptus, the gigantic gum trees in Australia and Van Diemen's Land\r\n(of which quarter all the species are natives), and sent to the\r\nEnglish market; it is said to be twice as powerful in its operations\r\nas oak bark. Some of these trees attain a height of 200 feet. Their\r\nbark separates remarkably into layers. A sort of kino gum, an\r\nastringent resinous-like substance, is also extracted from _E.\r\nresinifera_, the brown gum-tree of New Holland, which is sold in the\r\nmedicine bazaars of India. It exudes in the form of red juice from\r\nincisions in the bark. A single tree will often yield 60 gallons. In\r\nBrazil they use the bark of _Luhea panicata_, an evergreen climber,\r\nfor tanning leather; and in Peru the bark of some species of\r\n_Weinmaunia_ serve the same purpose. Among other powerful astringents\r\nI may notice the root of a species of Sea Lavender (_Statice\r\nCaroliniana_), _Myrica cerifera_, and _Heuchera Americana_, all\r\nnatives of North America. Also the petals of _Hibiscus Rosa-sinensis_,\r\na native of Asia.\r\n\r\nThe sea-side grape (_Coccolaba uvifera_) yields an astringent\r\nsubstance, known as Jamaica kino.\r\n\r\nThe bark of the _Cassia auriculata_, and the milky juice of the\r\n_Asclepias gigantea_, are used for tanning in India.\r\n\r\nThe red astringent gum obtained from _Butea frondosa_, a middling\r\nsize tree, common in Bengal and the mountainous parts of India, is\r\nused by the natives for tanning. English tanners, however, object to\r\nits use on account of the color which it communicates to the leather.\r\n\r\nThe barks of the _Mora excelsa_, Benth; Courida (_Avicenna nutida_),\r\ncashew (_Anicardium occidentale_), guava and hog-plum (_Spondius\r\nlutea_, Linn.), have all been successfully used for tanning in\r\nDemerara and the West India Islands, where they are very abundant.\r\nSpecimens were sent from British Guiana.\r\n\r\nThe root of the Palmetto palm (_Chaemaerops Palmetto_) is stated to be\r\nvaluable for the purposes of tanning. The leaves of _Nerium Oleander_\r\ncontain tannic acid. The bark of a species of Malphigia is much used\r\nby the Brazilians.\r\n\r\nThe panke (_Gunnera scabra_) is a fine plant, growing in Chili, on the\r\nsandstone cliffs, which somewhat resembles the rhubarb on a gigantic\r\nscale. The inhabitants eat the stalks, which are subacid, tan leather\r\nwith the roots, and also prepare a black dye from them. The leaf is\r\nnearly circular, but deeply indented on its margin. Mr. Darwin\r\nmeasured one which was nearly eight feet in diameter, and therefore no\r\nless than twenty-four in circumference. The stalk is rather more than\r\na yard high, and each plant sends out four or five of these enormous\r\nleaves, presenting together a very noble appearance.\r\n\r\nThe barks replete with the tanning principle should be stripped with\r\nhatchets and bills from the trunk and branches of trees in spring,\r\nwhen their sap flows most freely. The average quantity of oak bark\r\nobtained from our forests is estimated at 150,000 tons annually, of\r\nwhich Ireland and Scotland furnish but a very small quantity.\r\n\r\nThe following table, given by Dr. Ure, shows the quantity of\r\nextractive matter and tannin yielded by different substances:--\r\n\r\n                      In 480 parts         In 100 parts\r\n                        by Davy.            by Cadet.\r\n  Sicilian sumach          78                  --\r\n  Malaga ditto             79                  --\r\n  Souchong tea             48                  --\r\n  Green tea                41                  --\r\n  Bombay catechu          261                  --\r\n  Bengal ditto            231                  --\r\n  Nutgalls                127                  46\r\n  Bark of pomegranate      --                  32\r\n    \"   Virginian sumach   --                  10\r\n    \"   Carolina ditto     --                   5\r\n\r\nCatechu and Gambier are very valuable for tanning, and are alluded to\r\nunder the heads GAMBIER and ARECA PALM.\r\n\r\nCATECHU is obtained from the _Acacia Catechu_, an arboreous tree\r\ngrowing from fifteen to twenty feet high, with a brown and scabrous\r\nbark. The interior wood is brown, dark red or blackish, and the\r\nexterior white, one or two inches thick. It inhabits various parts of\r\nthe East Indies, of which it is a native, and is also now common in\r\nJamaica. It bears whitish or pale yellow flowers.\r\n\r\nThe catechu obtained from this tree in Pegu, is celebrated throughout\r\nIndia, and fetches £4 to £5 more per ton than gambier and other\r\nastringent extracts. When of good quality, catechu is more powerful as\r\nan astringent than kino. Of all the astringent substances we know,\r\ncatechu appears to contain the largest proportion of tannin, and Mr.\r\nPurkis found that one pound was equivalent to seven or eight of oak\r\nbark for tanning leather.\r\n\r\nThe term catechu, observes Dr. Pereira, is applied to various\r\nastringent extracts imported from India and the neighbouring\r\ncountries. A few years ago the terms catechu, terra japonica, and\r\ncutch were employed synonymously; they are now, however, for the most\r\npart used in trade somewhat distinctively, though not uniformly in the\r\nsame sense. The manufacture of catechu from the _Acacia catechu_ as\r\npractised in Canara and Behar, has been described by Mr. Kerr (\"Med.\r\nObs. and Inquiries,\" vol. v.), and Dr. Hamilton (\"Journey through\r\nMysore,\" &c., vol. iii.), while Professor Royle has explained the\r\nprocess followed in Northern India. According to the last-mentioned\r\ngentleman, \"the kutt manufacturers move to different parts of the\r\ncountry in different seasons, erect temporary huts in the jungles, and\r\nselecting trees fit for their purpose, cut the inner wood into small\r\nchips. These they put into small earthen pots, which are arranged in a\r\ndouble row, along a fireplace built of mud; water is then poured in\r\nuntil the whole are covered; after a considerable portion has boiled\r\naway, the clear liquor is strained into one of the neighbouring pots,\r\nand a fresh supply of the material is put into the first, and the\r\noperation repeated until the extract in the general receiver is of\r\nsufficient consistence to be poured into clay moulds, which, in the\r\nKheree Pass and Doon, where I have seen the process, are generally of\r\na quadrangular form. This catechu is usually of a pale red color, and\r\nis considered there to be of the best quality. By the manufacturers it\r\nis conveyed to Saharunpore and Moradabad, whence it follows the course\r\nof commerce down the Ganges, and meets that from Nepaul, so that both\r\nmay be exported from Calcutta.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGAMBIER.\r\n\r\nThe Gambier plant (_Uncaria Gambler_, Roxburgh, _Nauclea Gambir_,\r\nHunter), has been described by Rumphius under the name of _Funis\r\nuncatus_. It is a stout, scandent, evergreen shrub, which strongly\r\nresembles the myrtle. It is generally cultivated in the same\r\nplantation with pepper, as the leaves and shoots, after undergoing the\r\nprocess by which their juice is extracted, to furnish a kind of\r\ncatechu, are found to be an excellent manure for the pepper vines. The\r\nleaves and young shoots of the gambier plant are collected as soon as\r\nthey have attained a sufficient size, and boiled in iron pans until\r\nthe juice acquires the consistence of treacle. The decoction is poured\r\nout into narrow troughs, dried, and afterwards cut up into small\r\ncakes, and packed in baskets for exportation. The gambier extract,\r\nwhich is of a yellowish brown color, and has the consistence of hard\r\ncheese, is much esteemed by the Malays for mixing with the preparation\r\nof betel, which they are in the habit of chewing; and considerable\r\nquantities have lately been imported to this country, where it is used\r\nfor dyeing colors, and for tanning leather. The demand for gambier\r\nhere is on the increase; and when better known to our chemists, it\r\nwill probably be found applicable to many other purposes than those to\r\nwhich it is at present applied.\r\n\r\nThere were, in 1850, 400 gambier and pepper plantations on the island\r\nof Singapore; each measures or occupies on an average an area of 500\r\nfathoms square, and employs eight to ten hands to cultivate and\r\nmanufacture the gambier and pepper. There are some pepper plantations\r\nin addition, and they have been found to answer very well without any\r\ngambier being cultivated with them. Gambier cultivation is generally a\r\nlosing undertaking, but it is adopted to obtain the refuse of the\r\nleaves for manuring the pepper vines, and also to employ the people in\r\nthe plantations; it besides affords the proprietors the means of\r\ngetting monthly sums to carry on the cultivation of pepper, which\r\naffords two crops yearly. There were formerly 600 plantations in\r\nSingapore, but the reason already assigned, and the formation of spice\r\nplantations contiguous have caused the abandonment of all those near\r\nthe town. Each plantation must have an equal extent of forest land to\r\nthat cultivated with gambier and pepper, to enable the manufacture of\r\nthe gambier being carried on, and each gambier plantation, of 500\r\nfathoms square, contains about 3,500 pepper vines, which yield on an\r\naverage two catties per vine, or 70 piculs of pepper, and about 170\r\npiculs of gambier annually;--a good plantation will, however, yield\r\nsometimes as much as 120 piculs of pepper, and 200 piculs of gambier,\r\nand a bad one as little as 40 to 50 piculs of pepper, and 60 to 80\r\npiculs of gambier. Were it not for the enormous commission charged by\r\nthe agents of these plantations, from whom the cultivators get all the\r\nadvances, it would prove a profitable cultivation. The rates of\r\ncommission charged generally are as follows:--Per picul of gambier,\r\nfifteen to twenty-five cents; per picul of pepper, thirty to forty\r\ncents; and if the price of the former is below one-and-a-half dollars,\r\nand the latter below three-and-a-half dollars per picul, a small\r\nreduction is made in the rates of commission. On every picul of rice\r\nsupplied to the planters twenty to twenty-five cents commission is\r\ncharged; this includes the interest of money advanced, which is never\r\ncharged. A gambier and pepper plantation is valued or estimated at\r\nabout 400 dollars on an average. The following is supposed to be a\r\ncorrect estimate, on an average, of the yearly expenditure and returns\r\nof a gambier and pepper plantation of 500 fathoms square, viz:--\r\n\r\n                                EXPENDITURE.\r\n                                                   drs. c.   men.   drs. c.\r\n  Eight men at 3½ dollars and 7 Java rupees per\r\n  month, wages for  headman and labourers\r\n  respectively                                      22.70     12     272.40\r\n  Five piculs of rice, including commission, say     6.50     12      81.60\r\n  Fish, &c.                                          5        12      60.0\r\n  Boat or cart hire to carry rice and produce        1¾       12      21.0\r\n                                                                     ------\r\n                                                                     435.0\r\n\r\n                                 PRODUCE.\r\n\r\n  170 piculs of gambier, valued at l dollar 45 cents\r\n  per picul, less 15 cents commission chargeable,\r\n  nett                                              221.30    --     ---\r\n  70 piculs of pepper, at 4½ dollars, less 40 cents\r\n  per picul commission, nett                        287.0     --    508.0\r\n\r\nYearly profit, 73 dollars, or about £15.\r\n\r\nSeveral gambier and pepper plantations have been abandoned in\r\nSingapore, partly from the ground being impoverished, but more\r\nparticularly from the exhaustion of the forest adjacent to their\r\nestates. The exhaustion of the trees by yearly consumption deprives\r\nthe planters of the necessary fire wood which is used for the boiling\r\ndown of the gambier. A gambier plantation gets exhausted in fifteen\r\nyears, either from the want of firewood or the land getting\r\nimpoverished.\r\n\r\nThere are about 200 plantations at Johore, and the produce of gambier\r\nfor the season of 1851 was calculated at 30,000 piculs.\r\n\r\nThis shrub was, at one period, cultivated with success at Pinang and\r\nother places to the eastward, but as Java was the principal market for\r\nthe produce, and the Dutch had levied a duty of twelve Java rupees per\r\npicul on it, the cultivation at the former island did not repay its\r\ncost, and it was accordingly abandoned. Prices have been lately\r\nadvancing, and the Chinese are talking of trying it again. The plant\r\nis partial to hilly land or slopes at the skirts of hills. Two hundred\r\nplants are usually placed on one orlong of land, being six feet\r\nasunder. They are raised from seed, and are topped to eight or ten\r\nfeet, when the gambier is to be prepared. The Chinese dry the seed\r\nslightly, and sow in rainy weather.\r\n\r\nThe seeds vegetate in forty days, and are planted out in the second or\r\nthird month afterwards.\r\n\r\nAt the expiration of fourteen months, the first cutting of the\r\nbranches, with the leaves on, is made. These are put into a boiler,\r\nand when the juice has been extracted, the branches and refuse are\r\nthrown away, and the boiling is continued until the liquor has\r\nobtained the proper consistence, when it is put into shallow troughs,\r\ndried, and cut into slices for sale. The second cutting takes place\r\neight months subsequently to the first. The plant now grows strong and\r\nadmits of frequent cropping, and it will endure for twenty years. No\r\nmanure is used, but the plantation is kept clean.\r\n\r\nEstimated cost of cultivating ten orlongs, about 13 acres, according\r\nto Colonel Low:--\r\n\r\n                                     Spanish dollars.\r\n  Value of cleared land, ten orlongs       200\r\n  Six laborers per annum                   360\r\n  Quit rent                                  7\r\n  Boilers, firewood, and implements         20\r\n  Houses                                    50\r\n  Incidental                                30\r\n                                          ----\r\n  Total first year                         667\r\n  Second year                              397\r\n                                          ----\r\n                                         1,064\r\n\r\nThe six laborers on the plantation will, after the above period, be\r\nconstantly employed in cutting and preparing the gambier: the average\r\nproduct will be 15 piculs monthly, which, at two dollars per picul,\r\nwill be 30 dollars monthly, or 360 dollars per annum. This is the\r\naccount obtained by collating different Chinese statements.\r\n\r\nThe _Nauclea Gambir_ is placed by Jussieu under the natural order\r\n_Rubiaceæ_; it is a shrub attaining the height of six to eight feet,\r\nbranchy; the leaves are ovate, pointed, smooth, waving, distinctly\r\nveined transversely underneath, of dark green color, and, when chewed,\r\nthey have a bitter astringent taste, leaving however, afterwards, a\r\nsweetish taste in the mouth, not unlike liquorice; the flowers are\r\naggregate, globular, composed of numerous florets, crowded on a\r\nglobular naked receptacle; tubes of the corolla of a pinkish color;\r\nthe upper part of the corolla fine, cleft, and of a greenish yellow\r\ncolor; the staminæ are five in number, and short; the pistil is longer\r\nthan the corolla; the flowers are destitute of fragrance; the capsules\r\n(as correctly stated by Mr. Hunter) are stalked oblong, incrusted, and\r\ncrowned with a calyx; tapering to a point below; two celled, two\r\nvalved, the valves adhering at the apex, splitting at the sides; seeds\r\nvery numerous, oblong, very small, compressed, furnished at both ends\r\nwith a membraneous pappus.\r\n\r\nThe gambier plant is propagated either by seeds or cuttings, but the\r\nlatter are preferred. It is cultivated to some extent at Singapore,\r\nbut it is said that the gambier can be imported cheaper from the\r\nislands in the vicinity, more especially at the Dutch settlement at\r\nRhio. The extract is used extensively by the natives of India, Eastern\r\nArchipelago, Cochin-China, and Cambodia, as a masticatory, wrapped up\r\nwith the betel.\r\n\r\nThere are three different qualities of extract; the first and best is\r\nwhite, brittle, and has an earthy appearance when rubbed between the\r\nfingers (which earthy appearance gave it the name of Terra Japonica,\r\nbeing supposed, at first also, to come from Japan), and is formed into\r\nvery small round cakes. This is the dearest sort, and most refined,\r\nbut it is not unfrequently adulterated with sago; this kind is brought\r\nin the greatest quantity from the island of Sumatra. The second\r\nquality is of a brownish yellow color, is formed into oblong cakes,\r\nand, when broken, has a light brown earthy appearance; it is also made\r\ninto a solid cube form; it is sold in the bazars in small packets,\r\neach containing five or six. The third quality contains more\r\nimpurities than the preceding, is formed into small circular cakes,\r\nand is sold in packages of five or six in the bazar.\r\n\r\nThe method employed in preparing the extract is thus correctly related\r\nby Finlayson:--\"The leaves are collected three or four times a year;\r\nthey are thrown into a large cauldron, the bottom of which is formed\r\nof iron, the upper part of bark, and boiled for five or six hours,\r\nuntil a strong decoction is obtained; the leaves are then withdrawn,\r\nand allowed to strain over the vessel, which is kept boiling for as\r\nmany hours more, until the decoction is inspissated; it is then\r\nallowed to cool, when the catechu subsides, The water is drawn off; a\r\nsoft soapy substance remains, which is cut into large masses; these\r\nare further divided by a knife into small cubes, about an inch square,\r\nor into still smaller pieces, which are laid in frames to dry. This\r\ncatechu has more of a granular, uniform appearance than that of\r\nBengal; it is, perhaps, also less pure.\"\r\n\r\nThe younger leaves of the shrub are said to produce the whitest and\r\nbest gambier; the older, a brown and inferior sort. There are other\r\nspecies of _Nauclea_ indigenous to Singapore, but they do not produce\r\nany extract.\r\n\r\nDr. Bennett has particularised four qualities of gambier:--\r\n\r\n1. Small round cakes, about the size of a small lozenge. Color pale,\r\npurplish, yellowish, white.\r\n\r\n2. Cubes, in which shape it is principally imported into England, and\r\nsquare prisms, or oblong pieces.\r\n\r\n3. Circular discs, or short cylindrical pieces.\r\n\r\n4. Cubical amylaceous pieces, of a darker brown than the other kinds.\r\n\r\nGambier is one of the most powerful of the pure astringents.\r\n\r\nThe chief places of manufacture are Saik, Malacca, Singapore, and Rhio\r\nor Bintang. Bennett, in his \"Wanderings,\" says there are 60,000\r\nplantations of gambier on this island. After that of Rhio, the next\r\nbest gambier is that of Lingin. That used by the Malays, with the\r\nleaves of betel, in the same manner as cutch in other parts of India,\r\nis the finest and whitest; the red being stronger tasted and rank, is\r\nexported to Batavia, China, and England, for the purposes of tanning\r\nand dyeing. It is frequently adulterated with sago powder, but it may\r\nbe detected by solution in water.\r\n\r\nLarge quantities of gambier are imported, under the corrupted name of\r\ncutch, into Calcutta, from Pegu. The quantity of gambier produced in\r\nRhio, by the Chinese settlers, amounts to about 4,600 tons a year,\r\nabout 2,000 of which are exported for the consumption of Java, the\r\nrest being sent to Cochin-China and other neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\nTwo methods of obtaining gambier are described. One consists in\r\nboiling the leaves in water, and in inspissating the decoction; the\r\nother, which yields the best gambier, consists in infusing the leaves\r\nin warm water, by which a fecula is obtained, which is inspissated by\r\nthe heat of the sun, and formed into cakes.\r\n\r\nThe injudicious practice adopted by the Land Office in Singapore, of\r\ngranting indiscriminate licenses, or \"cutting papers\" as they are\r\nformed, seems open to objection, and is driving many of the Chinese\r\ncultivators to the neighbouring island of Johore, where they readily\r\nobtain permission to cultivate, without obstruction, this important\r\narticle of commerce. Parties of 300 or 400 at a time left in 1846. It\r\nappears that, under his permissive license, the squatter obtains\r\npermission to clear as much land as he possibly can, but the order\r\ndoes not define any extent beyond which no cutting should take place.\r\nThe squatter clears as much land as the means at his disposal will\r\nallow, in the hope and expectation that the jungle contiguous to the\r\ncleared ground will be at his command for fuel--a supply of fuel, easy\r\nof access, and adequate to the number of plants grown, being\r\nindispensable to the culture and manufacture of gambier. When the time\r\nfor gathering the leaves arrives, another squatter (perhaps from\r\nmotives of envy or malice) obtains a \"cutting paper,\" and commences\r\nclearing in close proximity to the already-formed gambier plantation;\r\nobviously depriving the owner of the fuel he has reasonably calculated\r\nupon. The established planter cannot of course eject the intruder from\r\nthe land, since the latter possesses an equal right to it, in virtue\r\nof his \"cutting paper,\" which, as it specifies no limits, leaves him\r\nthe disposer or destroyer of the crop of the industrious planter.\r\nInstead of the present system, a better practice ought to be\r\nintroduced, defining the boundaries to be included in a \"cutting\r\npaper,\" and effectually preventing a trespass on the fuel-land of the\r\nindustrious planter. This might easily be effected by specifying the\r\nnumber of acres, as well as the direction, in every clearing paper\r\ngranted.\r\n\r\nThe average produce of gambier in Singapore is between 7,000 and 8,000\r\npiculs monthly. The ordinary price is about 1¼ dollars per picul. A\r\ndeficiency of rain, labor, or other causes, will occasionally reduce\r\nthe annual produce from 90,000 or 100,000 piculs, to 60,000 or 70,000,\r\nand this diminished supply will raise the market price of the article\r\nprobably 35 cents per picul. But, in addition to the effect occasioned\r\nby a deficient supply, there are other causes in operation exercising\r\na powerful influence in reducing prices. Gambier was first exported in\r\n1830, from Singapore, to the extent of 2,587 piculs, at 4½ dollars per\r\npicul. As a rival to bark it failed at so costly a price to meet with\r\nencouragement; the culture and manufacture consequently declined until\r\n1834, when 1,858 piculs were shipped to England at a somewhat lower\r\nrate. The demand then became active, the exportations were at first\r\nmultiplied, then doubled every succeeding year, until they reached, in\r\n1846-47 no less than 173,117 piculs. The price has gradually declined\r\nto 1¼ dollars per picul, at which rate it displaces its rival, bark.\r\nThis price, however, is unremunerative to the grower, so that, unless\r\nmore encouragement offers, the supply will decline.\r\n\r\nThe number of Chinese employed in the cultivation, &c., of gambier\r\nand pepper in Singapore is about 11,000. Their rate of wages\r\nfluctuates with the price of gambier. If a picul of gambier realizes\r\n1½ dollars, the monthly pay will be about three dollars; if gambier\r\nfetches two dollars, their pay will amount to four dollars in the\r\nmonth. The workmen who clean the plantation always receive a dollar\r\nless than those who cut and boil the gambier.\r\n\r\nA good deal of gambier seems now to be grown in Java, for 58,305\r\npiculs were exported from that island in 1843. A small quantity is\r\ntaken by the Chinese ports, but whether as a masticatory or for\r\ntanning and dyeing I am not aware.\r\n\r\n  VALUE OF THE TERRA JAPONICA IMPORTED INTO CEYLON.\r\n               £\r\n  1840        611\r\n  1841      1,053\r\n  1842        768\r\n  1843        471\r\n  1844      1,153\r\n  1845        537\r\n  1846        824\r\n  1847      1,549\r\n  1848      1,095\r\n  1849        896\r\n  1850        265\r\n  1851        386\r\n\r\nIn the Customs' returns of imports to this country, two articles are\r\nenumerated, under the separate names of cutch and terra japonica; the\r\nformer is catechu and the latter the produce of the gambier plant.

About 450 cwt. of terra japonica or gambier is annually\r\nimported into Hull from the East Indies. The imports of the two\r\nsubstances into Liverpool is about 900 tons. Gambier is only worth £13\r\nto £14 the ton; a few years ago it fetched 26s. the cwt. The imports\r\ninto the port of London average 1,500 tons annually.\r\n\r\n4,679 bales, and 14,436 baskets of terra japonica were imported into\r\nLiverpool in 1851, and 14,000 bales and baskets in 1852. The imports\r\nof cutch were 10,290 bags, and 2,592 baskets, in 1851, and 11,873 bags\r\nand baskets in 1852; the prices, which were from 16s. 6d. to 18s. per\r\ncwt. for each article, in 1851, were rapidly run up in Liverpool, in\r\n1853, owing to short supplies, to 25s. for gambier, and 22s. to 24s.\r\nper cwt. for cutch, or catechu.\r\n\r\n  EXPORTS OF GAMBIER FROM SINGAPORE, WITH THE OFFICIAL VALUE IN RUPEES.\r\n\r\n                                  Piculs.

Its tannin differs materially from that of nutgalls. The\r\nquantity of mucilage which it contains precludes it from the use of\r\ndyers; but, as it furnishes nearly 50 per cent. of tannin, it is\r\nlargely used by curriers. It is imported into Liverpool from Rio de la\r\nHacha, Maracaibo, and Savanila. 400 tons of the seed pods and bark of\r\nthe Algaroba, or Locust-tree (_Prosopis pallida_) were imported in\r\n1849 into Liverpool from Valparaiso, as a substitute for divi-divi in\r\ntanning. 3,200 lbs. of divi-divi were exported from the port of\r\nAugostara, in 1846.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of divi-divi which had been raised at Calcutta were shown in\r\nthe Indian department of the Great Exhibition.\r\n\r\nDr. Hamilton states that, according to some admirably conducted\r\nexperiments of Mr. Rootsey, of Bristol, undertaken at his request, the\r\npods of divi-divi contain above 50 per cent. of tannin. It appears\r\nalso, from trials made, that one part of divi-divi is sufficient for\r\ntanning as much leather as four parts of bark, and the process\r\noccupies but one-third of the time.\r\n\r\nThe average produce of pods from a full-grown tree has been estimated\r\nat 100 lbs. weight, one-fourth of which consists of seeds or refuse,\r\nleaving about 75 lbs. of marketable matter.\r\n\r\nAt an interval of six feet apart, an acre of ground will contain 1,210\r\ntrees, yielding an average of 810 cwts., and 30 pounds, or above 40½\r\ntons of marketable matter, worth, at only £5 per ton, £200. Should the\r\ninterval between the trees be extended two feet more, we shall still\r\nhave 680 to the acre, the produce of which would not improbably be\r\nincreased by the increased space given for the extension of the\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nThe ground in which this tree admits of being cultivated is that which\r\nis least adapted to the staple products of tropical agriculture;\r\nguinea grass may be profitably raised beneath its shade and as with\r\nthe exception of the three years which precede the commencement of its\r\nbearing, there is hardly any deduction to be made from its returns, it\r\npromises to be among the most valuable objects of a planter's\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nJacquin describes the _Cæsalpinia coriaria_ as a handsome branching\r\ntree, of about fifteen feet in stature, covered with a dark spotted\r\nbark. Its leaves are doubly pinnate, and the leaflets of twelve pair\r\nwithout a terminal one; they are oblong, obtuse, smooth, very entire.\r\nThe flowers are disposed in spikes issuing from the extremities of the\r\nbranches; they are small, yellowish, and slightly fragrant. To these\r\nsucceed oblong, compressed, somewhat obtuse pods, curved laterally,\r\nthe inner side being concave and the other convex. The seeds rarely\r\nexceed three or four in each pod, and are of a brownish color.\r\n\r\nDivi-divi resembles a dried pea-shuck curled up, filled with yellow\r\npowder, and a few dark brown seeds. The price ranges from £8 to £13\r\nper ton.\r\n\r\nThe imports into the United Kingdom in 1844, were 3,900 tons; in 1845\r\nand 1846, about 1,400 tons each year; during the subsequent three\r\nyears the imports were merely nominal, but in 1850 a renewed demand\r\nseems to have sprung up, for 2,770 tons were imported into Liverpool,\r\nand a few tons into London.\r\n\r\nCORK-TREE BARK (_Quercus suber_) has been imported into Ireland to a\r\nconsiderable extent, frequently to the amount of 1,500 tons annually.\r\nThe quantity of cork imported annually into the United Kingdom is\r\nabout 3,000 tons. It is brought from Spain, Italy, and Barbary. Oak\r\nbark and valonia being very cheap and plentiful, the price of cork\r\nhark is only nominal, being, for Spanish cork-tree bark, £7 10s. to £8\r\nper ton; Leghorn ditto, £6 to £7 per ton. It is less astringent than\r\noak bark, and is more generally useful for stoppers of bottles and\r\nbungs for casks. 160 tons of cork-tree bark were imported into\r\nLiverpool from Rabat in 1849, and 150 tons in 1850.\r\n\r\n1,867 cwts. of bark for tanning were imported from Chili in 1844, of\r\nwhich 292 were Quillai bark.\r\n\r\nMIMOSA BARK.--The bark of the _Mimosa decurrens_, which abounds in\r\nAustralia and Van Diemen's Land, is found to be a very powerful\r\ntanning agent.\r\n\r\nThe first shipment of tannin was made from Sydney to England as far\r\nback as 1823, in the shape of an extract of the bark of two species of\r\nmimosa, which was readily purchased by the tanners at the rate of £50\r\nper ton. One ton of bark had produced four cwts. of extract of the\r\nconsistency of tar.\r\n\r\nIn 1843, 3,078 tons of mimosa bark was shipped from Port Phillip to\r\nGreat Britain. The price then realised in the London market was £12 to\r\n£14 per ton, but it has since declined to £8 a ton. The quantity of\r\nthis bark to be procured in the colony is quite inexhaustible. The\r\nprice of chopped mimosa bark in Australia, for export, in the close of\r\n1846, was £2 5s. per ton. Bark valued at £912 was exported from Van\r\nDiemen's Land in 1848.\r\n\r\nThe imports of mimosa bark have only been to a limited extent within\r\nthe last few years, reaching 350 tons in 1850, against 110 tons in\r\n1849, 230 tons in 1848, and 600 tons in 1847. The prices realised were\r\n£10 to £11 for chopped, £12 to £12 10s. for ground, and £8 to £9 per\r\nton for unchopped bark. Whilst the imports were 3,900 tons in 1814,\r\nthey dwindled to less than 400 tons in 1850.\r\n\r\nFrom an experiment, conducted by Professor Brandt, the strength of the\r\nmimosa bark, as compared with that of young English oak bark, is found\r\nto be in the proportion of 57 to 39, so that the mimosa bark is half\r\nas strong again as the best English bark.\r\n\r\nMr. Samuel Mossman, in a communication to the Botanic Society of\r\nEdinburgh, in 1851, stated that the bark of _A. dealbata_ pays to ship\r\nto England, notwithstanding the distance, from the fact of its\r\ncontaining a greater per centage of tannin than any other bark. It is\r\na handsome tree, from fifteen to thirty feet high, forming luxuriant\r\ngroves on the banks of streams, most abundant in Port Phillip and\r\nTwofold Bay, between the parallels of latitude 34 and 30 degrees.\r\n\r\nNew Zealand is rich in barks and dyes. The bark of the Tanahaka\r\n(_Phyllodadus trichomanoides_, of Don) is used by the natives as a red\r\ndye for the ornamental parts of their kaitahas, their best border\r\ngarments. There is also another red dye, called Tawaivwai, the bark of\r\nwhich is very profuse. A black dye is procured from the hinau. They\r\nare of a rich hue, and exceedingly fast colors. The barks are to be\r\nfound all over the colony. The hinau and tanahaka are employed in\r\ntanning, all the leather used in the colony being tanned either at the\r\nBay of Islands or Port Nicholson.\r\n\r\nThe bark of the Rimu or red pine (_Dacrydium Cupressinum_, of\r\nSolander), a very common tree, possesses tanning qualities far\r\nsuperior to any of the Australian barks. One pound of the bark yields\r\n85 grains of extract.\r\n\r\nThe native tanning barks of New Zealand are various and easily\r\nobtained. Specimens of the bark and dye, &c., of most of these trees\r\nwere sent home to the Great Exhibition. One pound of the Tanahaka bark\r\nis said to yield 63 grains of tannin. The sails of boats are dyed with\r\nit to preserve them. The Towai (_Licospermum racemosum_, of Don,\r\n_Weinmaunia racemosa_, Decandole), is supposed to be valuable for the\r\npurposes of the tanner, and is said to yield 104 grains of tannin for\r\nevery pound of bark. The bark of the Pohutu kawa of the natives, the\r\n_Metrosideros tomentosa_of Richard, and _Callistemon ellipticum_ of\r\nAllan Cunningham, would also be useful for tanning, one pound of it\r\nfurnishing about 60 grains of tannin.\r\n\r\nThe bark of the Hino tree, the _Elæocarpus hinau_ of Cunningham, the\r\n_Dicera dentata_ of Forster, is used by the natives for dyeing black.\r\n\r\nThe black mangrove (_Rhizophora mangle_) is a tree attaining an\r\naltitude of from 30 to 50 feet, and occupying marshy situations in the\r\nvicinity of the sea. Almost every part of the mangrove--the bark,\r\nroots, and the fruit more particularly--abounds in an astringent\r\nprinciple, which is successfully applied to the purposes of tanning.\r\nAs the tree is so abundant within the tropics, it might be worth the\r\nwhile of some practical speculator to make an extract on the spot, and\r\nintroduce it into the English market, for the use of tanners and\r\ndyers. For tanning, the mangrove is said to be infinitely superior to\r\noak bark, completing in six weeks an operation which with the latter\r\noccupies at least six months, and the sole-leather so tanned is said\r\nto be more durable than any other. The bark and leaves, which contain\r\nnearly as much tannin as the oak, are made use of in the West Indies,\r\nas well as in Scinde and other parts of Asia.\r\n\r\n3,713 piculs of mangrove bark, valued at £819, were shipped from\r\nShanghae, one of the Chinese ports, in 1849.\r\n\r\nMYROBALANS.--This is a name applied to the almond-like kernels of a\r\nnut or dried fruit of the plum kind, of which there are several sorts\r\nknown in the East. They are the produce of various species of\r\n_Terminalia_, as _T. Bellerica, chebula, citrina_, and _angustifolia_.\r\nThey vary from the size of olives to that of gall nuts, and have a\r\nrough, bitter, and unpleasant taste. Many of the trees of this tribe,\r\nwhich are all natives of the tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and\r\nAmerica, are used for tanning, and some for dyeing. They are highly\r\nvalued by dyers, creating, when mixed with alum, a durable dark brown\r\nyellow. Myrobalans fetch in the Bombay market 8s. to 26s. the Surat\r\ncandy of 821 lbs. The bark and leaves of _T. Catappa_ yield a black\r\npigment, with which Indian ink is made; the seeds are eaten like\r\nalmonds. A milky juice is said to flow from _T. angustifolia_, which,\r\nwhen dried, is fragrant, and, resembling Benzoin, is used as a kind of\r\nincense in the Catholic churches in the Mauritius. The fruit of _T.\r\nBellerica_, and of _T. Chebula_, both useful timber trees, indigenous\r\nto the East Indies, are used medicinally as a tonic and astringent.\r\n117 cwts. of myrobalans were shipped from Ceylon in 1845.\r\n\r\nThe annual imports of myrobalans into Hull, amount to about 1,600\r\ncwts. The quantity which arrived at Liverpool was 185 tons in 1849,\r\n851 tons in 1850; 27,212 bags in 1851, and 19,946 bags in 1852; they\r\ncome from Calcutta and Bombay, and are also used for dyeing yellow and\r\nblack. The price in January, 1853, was 6s. to 12s. per cwt. The\r\naverage annual imports into the United Kingdom may be taken at 1,200\r\ntons.\r\n\r\nKINO.--The Kino, of Botany Bay and Van Diemen's Land, is the produce\r\nof the iron bark tree, _Eucalyptus resinifera_. White (\"Journal of a\r\nVoyage to New South Wales\"), says this tree sometimes yields, on\r\nincision, 60 gallons of juice. Kino is imported in boxes. The\r\ntincture of kino is used medicinally, but an inconvenience is\r\nfrequently found to arise, from its changing to the gelatinous form.\r\nDr. Pereira seems to think this species of kino consists principally\r\nof pectin and tannic acid. That chiefly used as East Indian kino, is\r\nan extract formed by inspissating a decoction of the branches and\r\ntwigs of the gambler plant. Vauquelin analysed it, and found it to\r\nconsist of, tannin and peculiar extractive matter, 75; red gum, 24;\r\ninsoluble matter, 1.\r\n\r\nThe East Indian kino, imported from Bombay and Tellicherry, is the\r\nproduce of _Pterocarpus marsupium_, a lofty, broad-spreading forest\r\ntree, which blossoms in October and November. The bark is of a greyish\r\ncolor, and is upwards of half an inch in thickness on the trunk. When\r\ncut, a blood-red juice speedily exudes and trickles down; it soon\r\nthickens, and becomes hard in the course of fifteen or sixteen hours.\r\nThe gum is extracted in the season when the tree is in blossom, by\r\nmaking longitudinal incisions in the bark round the trunk, so as to\r\nlet the gum ooze down a broad leaf, placed as a spout, into a\r\nreceiver. When the receiver is filled it is removed. The gum is dried\r\nin the sun until it crumbles, and then filled in wooden boxes for\r\nexportation.\r\n\r\n_P. erinaceus_, a tree 40 to 50 feet in height, a native of the woods\r\nof the Gambia and Senegal, furnishes kino, but none is collected in or\r\nexported from Africa. _Butea frondosa_, or the dhak tree of the East\r\nIndies, furnishes a similar product, in the shape of a milky, colored,\r\nbrittle, and very astringent gum. Kino is used as a powerful\r\nastringent, and is administered in the form of powder and tincture.\r\nSome specimens of Butea kino, analysed by Prof. Solly, after the\r\nimpurities had been separated, yielded 73¼ per cent. of tannin.\r\n\r\nVALONIA is the commercial name of the cupula or cup of the acorn,\r\nproduced by the _Quercus ægilops_ and its varieties, the Balonia or\r\nValonia oak, natives of the Levant, from whence, and the Morea, they\r\nform a very considerable article of export; containing abundance of\r\ntannin they are largely used by tanners. The tannin differs materially\r\nfrom that of nutgalls. The bark of _Q. tinctorea_, a native of North\r\nAmerica, yields a yellow dye.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of valonia imported for home consumption, in 1836, was\r\n80,511 cwts., of which Turkey furnished 58,724 cwts., and Italy and\r\nthe Ionian islands 7,209 cwts. Of 163,983 cwts. imported in 1840,\r\n143,095 cwts. were brought from Turkey, 15,195 cwts. from Italy, and\r\nthe residue from Greece and the Ionian Islands. The entries for home\r\nconsumption in the three years ending with 1842, amounted to about\r\n8,200 tons a year. The increase since has been considerable, the\r\nimports having been, in 1848, 10,237 tons; in 1849, 16,671 tons; in\r\n1850, 12,526 tons; in 1851, 10,639 tons; in 1852, 13,870 tons. We\r\nreceive about 14,000 to 20,000 cwts. annually from Leghorn. The\r\nimports into the port of Hull are 3,900 cwts. per year.\r\n\r\nThe prices of Smyrna valonias are from £13 to £14 per ton; those of\r\npicked Morea, £10 per ton. The duty received on valonias imported in\r\n1842 was about £4,000.\r\n\r\nThe annual produce is sufficient to meet the wants of all Europe. It\r\ncan be had in Turkey to any extent and at all periods. Many cargoes\r\nare sent to Dublin, and the German markets. A little valonia is\r\nexported from Manila, the shipments having been about 150 tons per\r\nannum.\r\n\r\nCamata and Camatina are two varieties of very young valonias, which\r\nare found more valuable for some processes of tanning than the common\r\nkinds.\r\n\r\nExtensive as has been the enumeration of the vegetable substances used\r\nin the various branches of art and manufacture which have formed the\r\nprincipal subjects of this section, it is probable that with the\r\nprogress of knowledge, of scientific experiment, and of investigation\r\ninto the properties of given commodities, the list will be\r\nindefinitely increased. What I have stated will suffice to give the\r\nreader an idea of the surprising variety of sources from which we\r\nreceive the raw materials which enable us to perfect some of the most\r\nelegant processes of manufacturing skill and ingenuity, and will\r\nfurther afford some criterion--though, of course, not a perfect\r\none--for estimating the relative importance of the tanning and dyeing\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V.\r\n\r\nOLEAGINOUS PLANTS, AND THOSE YIELDING FIXED OR ESSENTIAL OILS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew cultivators are probably aware of the great importance of oil to\r\nthis country, and the number of purposes for which it is employed in\r\nthe arts and manufactures. It is extensively used for candle and soap\r\nmaking, for burning in lamps, for diminishing friction in machinery of\r\nall kinds, and especially for locomotives--in wool-dressing, in the\r\nmanufacture of paints and varnishes, as an article of food, for\r\nmedicinal purposes, &c.\r\n\r\nSo important are vegetable oils deemed, that the Society of Arts, in\r\nits prize list for 1851, offered gold medals for the importation or\r\nintroduction into this country of any new plants or trees from China,\r\nIndia, or elsewhere, producing oils or fatty substances, such as can\r\nbe used as food, or are applicable to manufacturing purposes; and also\r\nto the person who shall manufacture and import the finest specimen of\r\noil, not less than ten gallons, the produce of olives grown in any\r\nBritish colony in Africa or Australasia.\r\n\r\nThe time of burning of equal quantities of the following oils has been\r\nfound to be--\r\n\r\n                                     Hours.\r\n  Oil of poppy                        14\r\n    \"    sunflower                    13\r\n    \"    rape                         11\r\n    \"    mustard                      11½\r\n    \"    flax seed                    10\r\n    \"    gold of pleasure\r\n        (_Camelina sativa_)       9½\r\n    \"    olives                        9\r\n    \"    hemp seed                     8\r\n    \"    tallow                       10½\r\n\r\n\r\n                     FOREIGN VEGETABLE  OILS   IMPORTED.\r\n\r\n                       1821.         1845.         1850.\r\n                       tuns.         tuns.         tuns.\r\n  Coco-nut oil          --           2,148        98,040\r\n  Olive oil           1,900         12,315        20,783\r\n  Palm oil            3,200         25,285       448,589 cwts.\r\n  Rape seed oil         800          3,973          --\r\n  Linseed oil        10,500         38,634          --\r\n                     ------         ------       -------\r\n                     16,400         82,355\r\n  Fish oils          32,356         22,626        21,328\r\n\r\nThe total quantity of all kinds of wool annually consumed in England\r\nand Wales, in 1843, was estimated at 801,566 packs. Now, five gallons\r\nof olive, rapeseed or other oils, being used in the preparation of\r\nevery pack of wool, for cloth (independent of the quantity used in\r\nsoap, applicable to the woollen manufactures), it follows that five\r\ngallons on 801,566 packs are equal to 4,007,830 gallons, or 15,904\r\ntuns; and adding for olive or sperm oil used in machinery 1-11th of\r\nthe whole, 1,446 tuns, the total quantity consumed is 17,350\r\ntuns.--(\"Enderby on the South Whale Fishery.\")\r\n\r\n_Fixed oils_ are found in the cells and intercellular spaces of the\r\nfruit, leaves, and other parts of plants.\r\n\r\nSome of these are drying oils, as linseed oil, from _Linum\r\nusitatissimum_; some are fat oils, as that from olives (fruit of _Olea\r\nsativa_ or _Europæa_); whilst others are solid, as palm oil.\r\n\r\nThe solid oils or fats procured from plants are, butter of cacao, from\r\n_Theobroma cacao_; of cinnamon from _Cinnamomum verum_; of nutmeg,\r\nfrom _Myristica moschata_; of coco-nut, from _Cocos nucifera_; of\r\nlaurel, from _Laurus nobilis_; of palm oil, from _Elais guianiensis_;\r\nShea butter, from _Bassia Parkii_; Galam butter, or Ghee, from _Bassia\r\nbutyracea_; and vegetable tallow, from _Stillingia sebifera_ in China,\r\nfrom _Vateria indica_ in Canara and China, and from _Pentadesma\r\nbutyracea_ in Sierra Leone, and from the almond.

In addition to this there are cottonseed oil,\r\nused for their lamps. Castor oil and Argemone seed, similarly used.\r\nOil obtained from the fruit of _Melia Azadriachta_, for medicine and\r\nlamps. Apricot oil in the Himalayas, sunflower oil, oil of\r\ncucumber-seed for cooking and lamps, oil of colocynth seed, a lamp\r\noil.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of bastard saffron (_Carthamus tinctorius_) yield oil.\r\n\r\nMustard oil, the produce of various species of _Sinapis_, &c. Shanghae\r\noil, from _Brassica Chinensis_. Illiepie oil, from _Bassia\r\nlongifolia_, which is used for frying cakes, &c., in Madras; and\r\nMuohwa oil, from another species of the same genus in Bengal, _B.\r\nlatifolia_. Oil is expressed from the seeds of _Cæsalpina oleosperma_,\r\na native of the East. The neem tree seeds afford a very clear or\r\nbitter oil, used for burning.\r\n\r\nWood oil is a remarkable substance, obtained from several species of\r\n_Dipterocarpus_, by simply tapping the tree.\r\n\r\nThe horse-eyes and cacoons of Jamaica (_Fevillea scandens_) yield a\r\nconsiderable quantity of oil or fat, as white and hard as tallow. It\r\nhas been employed for similar purposes on the Mosquito shores.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of the _Argemone mexicana_, and of the _Sanguinaria\r\ncanadensis_, also contain a bland, nutritious, colorless, fixed oil.\r\nThe mass from which the seed is expressed is found to be extremely\r\nnutritious to cattle.\r\n\r\nThe _Camelina sativa_ is cultivated in Europe, for the extraction of\r\nan oil used only by the soap makers, and for lamps.\r\n\r\nA solid oil, of a pale greenish color, a good deal resembling the oils\r\nof the Bassia in character, though rather harder, and approaching more\r\nin properties to myrtle wax, was shown at the Great Exhibition, from\r\nSingapore. It is supposed to be the produce of the tallow tree of\r\nJava, called locally \"kawan,\" probably a species of Bassia. It is very\r\neasily bleached; indeed, by exposure to air and light, it becomes\r\nperfectly white; if not too costly, it promises to become a valuable\r\noil.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Low, there are several varieties of solid oil\r\ncommonly used in the Islands of the Archipelago, and obtained from the\r\nseeds of different species of _Dipterocarpus_.\r\n\r\nPiney tallow is obtained from the fruit of the _Vateria Indica_, a\r\nlarge and quick-growing tree, abundant in Malabar and Canara. It is a\r\nwhite solid oil, fusible at a temperature of 97 degrees, and makes\r\nexcellent candles, especially when saponified and distilled in the\r\nmanner now adopted with palm oil, &c. It has one great advantage over\r\ncoco-nut oil, that the candles made of it do not give out any\r\nsuffocating acrid vapors when extinguished, as those made with the\r\nlatter oil do.\r\n\r\nAn oil is produced from the inner shell of the cashew-nut (_Anacardium\r\noccidentale_ var. _indicum_), in the East.\r\n\r\nIn Japan a kind of butter, called _mijo_, is obtained from a species\r\nof the Dolichos bean (_Dolichos soya_).\r\n\r\nThe kernel of the seeds of the tallow tree of China, _Stillingia\r\nsebifera_, an evergreen shrub, contains an oil, which, when expressed,\r\nconsolidates through the cold to the consistence of tallow, and by\r\nboiling becomes as hard as bees' wax. The plant also yields a bland\r\noil. A similar fatty product is obtained from a shrub in British\r\nGuiana, the _Myristica (Virola) sebifera_.\r\n\r\nOil is obtained in South America from the sand box tree _(Hura\r\ncrepitans_), and from the _Carapa guianensis_.\r\n\r\nA fatty oil is obtained in Demerara from the seeds of the butter tree,\r\n_Pekea_ (?) _Bassia butyrosa_, and also from the Saouari (_P.\r\ntuberculosa_).\r\n\r\nThe fleshy seeds contained in the woody capsules of the Monkey pot\r\n(_Lecythis Tabucajo_), which derive their generic name from their\r\nsimilarity to an oil jar, are common in the West India Islands and\r\nSouth America, and yield a considerable quantity of oil.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of the plants of the cucumber family frequently supply a\r\nbland oil, which is used in the East as a lamp oil and for cooking.\r\nAmong the vegetable oils imported into Ningpo, and other Chinese\r\nports, from Shantong, Leatong, and Teisin, are oil of teuss, obtained\r\nfrom green and dried peas; black oil of the fruit of the tree _kin_\r\n(?) and oil from the pea of suchau.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of _Spergula saliva_, a large, smooth-seeded variety of the\r\ncommon cow spurrey, which is cultivated in Flanders as a pasture grass\r\nand green crop, afford, on expression, a good lamp oil.\r\n\r\nA pale brownish yellow oil is obtained from the seeds of _Carthamus\r\ntinctorius_, in Bombay; the seeds contain about 28 per cent. of oil.\r\n\r\nExcellent oil is expressed in various parts of India from the seeds of\r\ndifferent species of _Sinapis_, especially from the black mustard\r\nseed. _S. glauca, S. dichotorna_, and _S. juncea_ are extensively\r\ncultivated in the East for their oil. The _Erysimum perfoliatum_ is\r\ncultivated in Japan for its oil-seeds.\r\n\r\nA beautiful pale yellow oil is procured from the seeds of the\r\nangular-leaved physic nut, _Jatropha curcas_, a shrub which is often\r\nemployed in the tropics as a fence for enclosures. It is used by the\r\nnatives in medicine and as a lamp oil. About 700 tons of this oil was\r\nimported into Liverpool in 1850 from Lisbon, for the purpose of\r\ndressing cloth, burning, &c.\r\n\r\nA rich yellow oil, perfectly clear and transparent, is obtained from\r\nthe seeds of _Bergera koenigii_.\r\n\r\nRAPE OIL.--The imports of rape oil, from _Brassica napus_, into\r\nLiverpool, are about 15 to 20 tuns annually.\r\n\r\nRape oil has been found to be better suited than any other oil for the\r\nlubrication of machinery, when properly purified from the mucilage,\r\n&c., which it contains in the raw state. Rape oil is now used\r\nextensively for locomotives, for marine engines, and also for burning\r\nin lamps. It is stated that a locomotive consumes between 90 and 100\r\ngallons of oil yearly; and the annual consumption of oil by the London\r\nand North-Western Railway, for this purpose alone, is more than 40,000\r\ngallons. The oil obtained from good English rape seed is purer and of\r\nsuperior quality to that from foreign or colonial seed; and as an acre\r\nof land yields nearly five quarters of seed, which is worth at present\r\n50s. per quarter, it is a profitable crop.\r\n\r\nRape seed is now largely imported for expressing oil. The imports,\r\nwhich in 1847 were but 87,662 quarters, weighing 17,532 tons, had\r\nreached, in 1851, 107,029 quarters, weighing 21,606 tons. The price of\r\nnew seed is £25 to £27 the last of ten quarters. The oil is £34 per\r\ntun.\r\n\r\nThe refuse cake, after the seed is crushed for oil, is in demand as\r\nfood for cattle, being worth £4 the ton.\r\n\r\nWe imported in 1851, from Trance, 289 tuns of rapeseed oil, worth\r\nabout £17,000, on which there was no duty levied.\r\n\r\nThere are exported annually from Hesse Darmstadt, 34,660 cwts. of\r\npoppy and rape oils.\r\n\r\nThe oil of the colza is much used in Europe, and highly prized. In\r\nFrance it has been adopted for all the purposes of lighthouses. In\r\nthis country it has lately come into extensive domestic use, for\r\nburning in the French moderateur lamps, being retailed at from 3s. 4d.\r\nto 4s. the gallon.\r\n\r\nDOMBA OIL.--The Poonay or Palang tree (_Calophyllum Inophyllum_), the\r\nAlexandrian laurel, is a beautiful evergreen, native of the East\r\nIndies, which flourishes luxuriantly on poor sandy soils, in fact\r\nwhere scarcely anything else will grow. The seeds or berries contain\r\nnearly 60 per cent. of a fragrant, fixed oil, which is used for\r\nburning as well as for medicinal purposes, being considered a cure for\r\nthe itch. As commonly prepared it has a dark green color. It is\r\nperfectly fluid at common temperatures, but begins to gelatinise when\r\ncooled below 50 degrees.\r\n\r\nTHE EARTH-NUT (_Arachis hypogæa, or hypocarpogea_).--This very\r\nsingular plant has frequently been confounded with others, partly\r\nthrough the carelessness of travellers, and by the improper use of\r\nnames, which tended to mislead and confuse. Its common appellative,\r\nthe earth-nut, has led to the conclusion that it was a species of nut,\r\nsuch as is known in England under the name of \"pig nut,\" \"hawk nut,\"\r\nand \"ground nut.\" This, as well as the \"earth chesnut,\" belongs to a\r\ntotally different genera. On the Continent and in the East Indies a\r\nsimilar confusion had long existed by the appellation of \"ground\r\npistachio,\" which caused the fruit to be confounded with the nut of\r\nthe tree _Pistacia vera_. Some resemblance, on the other hand,\r\nexisting between these--as well as from their being eaten by different\r\nnations, and used as an article of food, and also for producing\r\noil--rendered the true description still more difficult. Botanists\r\nare, however, no longer at a loss, having well established the nature\r\nand character of all these plants. The Arachis \"nut\" partakes of the\r\nnature of the pea or bean of our own country, and is a low annual\r\nplant of the order _Diadelphia decandria_ of Linn.; originally from\r\nAfrica, but now extensively cultivated in every quarter of the globe.\r\nIt has been naturalised in Europe, and with the climate of the South\r\nof France it may be turned to good account.\r\n\r\nIt has been said to be indigenous in Florida, Peru, Brazil, and\r\nSurinam; but the plant may be grown on a light sandy soil, under a\r\nmoderate heat, equal to that of Italy or the South of France. The\r\nclass to which it belongs approaches to the pea tribe; but its\r\nremarkable difference to this, as to the pulse we know as a bean, is\r\nthe circumstance of its introducing its fruit or pod--if we may so\r\ncall it--into the earth, for the purpose of ripening its seed. The\r\nArachis, or earth nut, has obtained its name from this operation. The\r\nflowers, leaves, and stems are produced in the ordinary manner we see\r\nin the pea tribe. When the yellow flower has withered and the seed\r\nfertilised, there is nothing left but the bare stem which had\r\nsupported it. This stem, in which is the germ of the future fruit and\r\npod, now grows rapidly in a curved manner, with a tendency to arrive\r\nshortly on the surface of the ground, into which it penetrates this\r\nnow naked stem, and sinks into the earth several inches. It is in this\r\nobscure position that the fruit takes its ripened form, and is either\r\ngathered from its hiding place or left to the future season, when its\r\ntime of rising into new existence calls it from what was thought its\r\nunnatural position.\r\n\r\nWhen mature, it is of a pale yellow color, wrinkled, and forms an\r\noblong pod, sometimes contracted in the middle; it contains generally\r\ntwo seeds. The nuts or peas are a valuable article of food in the\r\ntropical parts of Africa, America, and Asia. They are sweetish and\r\nalmond-like, and yield an oil, when pressed, not inferior in use and\r\nquality to that obtained from the olive. The leaf resembles that of\r\nclover, and, like it, affords excellent food for cattle. The cake,\r\nafter the oil is expressed, forms an excellent manure.\r\n\r\nThe Arachis is usually sown in dry, warm weather, from May to June,\r\nand are placed at the distance of eighteen inches from each other.\r\nInsects are fond of them; and if the season is cold and unfavorable to\r\nthem, or the growth retarded, they become musty and bad, or are eaten\r\nby insects.\r\n\r\nThe mode of obtaining the oil is nearly the same as for other pulse or\r\nseeds; and under favorable circumstances the Arachis will produce half\r\nits weight of oil. When heated and pressed the quantity is very\r\nconsiderably increased. This oil is good for every purpose for which\r\nolive or almond oil is used. For domestic purposes it is esteemed, and\r\nit does not become rancid so quickly as other oils. Experiments have\r\nbeen made on its inflammable properties, and it is proved that the\r\nbrilliancy of light was superior to that of olive oil, and its\r\ndurability was likewise proved to be seven minutes per hour beyond the\r\ncombustion of the best olive oil, with the additional advantage of\r\nscarcely any smoke. In Cochin-China and India it is used for lamps. It\r\nis known as Bhoe Moong or Moong Phullee in Bengal, and as Japan or\r\nChinese pulse in Java.\r\n\r\nFrom China this plant was probably introduced into the continent of\r\nIndia, Ceylon, and the Malayan Archipelago, where it is generally\r\ncultivated.\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina the seed is roasted and used as chocolate. The\r\nleaves are used medicinally.\r\n\r\nIt is grown in Jamaica, and there called Pindar nut.\r\n\r\nThat the culture of the Arachis in warm climates, or even in a\r\ntemperate one, under favorable circumstances, should be encouraged,\r\nthere can be but one opinion. And when it is considered that its\r\nqualities are able to supersede that of the olive and the almond,\r\nwhich are but precarious in their crops--to which may be added, that\r\nas a plant it is greedily devoured in the green state by cattle--how\r\nmuch may it not serve to assist the new settler in regions of the\r\nworld which have a climate suited to it.\r\n\r\nIt is known by various local names--such as _mani manoti_ by the\r\nSpaniards, and has obtained also that of _cacahuete_ in some\r\ncountries. It has the additional term _hypogea_ attached to it, which\r\nliterally signifies subterranean. This is apt to mislead; for the\r\nplant grows above ground as other pulse, whereas only its seed and\r\npericarp are inserted, after blooming, into the earth. Hence the\r\nbetter term _hypocarpogea_.\r\n\r\nIt appears to form an important article of cultivation along the whole\r\nof the west coast of Africa, and probably on the east coast, on\r\nseveral parts of which it was found by Loureiro (\"Flor. Cochin,\" p.\r\n430). It was doubtless carried from Africa to various parts of\r\nequinoctial America, for it is noticed in some of the early accounts\r\nof Peru and Brazil. 800 quarters of this nut were imported into\r\nLiverpool from the West Coast of Africa, in 1849, for expressing oil,\r\nand about half that quantity in 1850.\r\n\r\nEighty to 90 tuns of the expressed oil are now annually imported. The\r\nseeds contain about 44 per cent. of a clear pale yellow oil, which is\r\nlargely used in India as food, and for lamps, particularly at Malwa\r\nand Bombay, &c. Two varieties are grown in Malacca, the white seed and\r\nthe brown seed, and also in Java, in the vicinity of sugar\r\nplantations; the oil cake being used as manure. It is there known as\r\nkatjang oil.\r\n\r\nThis plant, which seems to be a native of many parts of Asia, has\r\nwithin the last ten years been much cultivated about Calcutta. The\r\nseeds contain abundance of fixed oil, have a faint odor, and very mild\r\nagreeable taste; 1,950 parts of seed, separated from their coverings\r\nand blanched, give 1,405 of kernels, from which, by cold pressure,\r\n703 parts of oil are procured. The seeds are consumed as a cheap\r\npopular luxury, being half roasted, and then eaten with salt. The oil\r\nis calculated to serve as an efficient and very cheap substitute for\r\nolive oil, for pharmaceutical purposes. It burns with little smoke,\r\nwith a clear flame, and affords a very full bright light, answering\r\nperfectly in Argand lamps.\r\n\r\nThe oil cake affords, also, an excellent food for cattle.\r\n\r\nThe ground nut has of late become of considerable importance as an\r\narticle of exportation, by English houses; yet more so by French\r\nhouses at Ghent, Rouen, and Bordeaux; some of whom have contracted\r\nwith the merchants of the African colonies for large quantities,\r\nsending shipping for the cargoes. One house alone contracted for\r\n60,000 bushels in the years 1844 and 1845. This nut oil is so very\r\nuseful to machinery that the naval steam cruisers on the coast have\r\nadopted it. A ground-nut oil factory exists in the colony of Sierra\r\nLeone; but from the want of steam power and proper machinery, and from\r\nbad management, together with the inferior attainments of the African\r\nartisan, when compared with the European mechanic, and their\r\nfacilities in quantity or quality, there is abundant scope for\r\nimprovement. The price in the colony is 4s. 6d. per gallon. It is\r\ncapable of being refined so as to answer the purpose of a salad oil;\r\nthe nut is prolific, and eaten by the natives and Europeans, boiled,\r\nroasted, or in its raw state; and frequently introduced at the table\r\nas we do the Spanish Barcelona nut at dessert. It grows in the rainy\r\nseason, and is collected in the dry, and sold in the colony for one\r\nshilling to eighteen-pence per bushel, in goods and cash. Form of the\r\nnut, long, light shell, contains two kernels covered with a brown\r\nrind, when shelled white in appearance.\r\n\r\nIt is a low creeping plant, with yellow flowers; after they drop off,\r\nand the pods begin to form, they bury themselves in the earth, where\r\nthey come to maturity. The pod is woody and dry, containing from one\r\nto three peas, or nuts, as they are called, hence the common names,\r\nground-nut or pea-nut. They require to be parched in an oven before\r\nthey are eaten, and form a chief article of food in many parts of\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nFrom a narrow strip of land, extending about 40 miles northerly from\r\nWilmington (North Carolina), comes nearly the entire quantity of earth\r\nnuts (known as pea-nuts) grown in the United States for market. From\r\nthat tract and immediate vicinity, 80,000 bushels have been carried to\r\nWilmington market in one year.\r\n\r\nThe plant has somewhat the appearance of the dwarf garden-pea, though\r\nmore bushy. It is cultivated in hills. The pea grows on tendrils,\r\nwhich put out from the plant and take root in the earth, where the nut\r\nis produced and ripened. The fruit is picked from the root by hand,\r\nand the vines are a favorite food for horses, mules, and cattle. From\r\n30 to 80 bushels are produced on an acre. There are some planters who\r\nraise from 1,000 to 1,500 bushels a year.--(\"Hunt's Merchant's\r\nMagazine,\" vol. xv., p. 426.)\r\n\r\nThe ground-nut is exceedingly prolific, and requires but little care\r\nand attention to its culture, while the oil extracted from it is quite\r\nequal to that yielded by the olive. Almost any kind of soil being\r\nadapted for it, nothing can be more simple than its management. All\r\nthat is required is the soil to be turned over and the seed sown in\r\ndrills like potatoes; after it begins to shoot it may be earthed with\r\na hoe or plough. In many parts of Western Australia they are now grown\r\nin gardens for feeding pigs, the rich oil they are capable of yielding\r\nbeing entirely overlooked. In regard to their marketable value at\r\nhome, I will give a copy of a letter of a friend of mine, received\r\nfrom some London brokers, largely engaged in the African trade:--\r\n\r\n    \"Wilson and Rose present compliments to Mr. N., and beg to inform\r\n    him the price of African ground nuts is as under:--Say for River\r\n    Gambia, £11 per ton here. Say for Sierra Leone, £10 per ton here.\r\n    For ground nuts free on board at the former port, £8 per ton is\r\n    demanded; these are the finest description of nut, the freight would\r\n    be about £4 per ton; the weight per bushel imperial measure, and in\r\n    the shell, is about 25 lbs.\"\r\n\r\nThe following, also, is an extract from a letter written in 1842, by\r\nMr. Forster (the present M.P. for Berwick), an eminent African\r\nmerchant. Speaking of the staple of Africa, he says:--\r\n\r\n    \"I have lately been attempting to obtain other oils from the coast,\r\n    and it was only yesterday I received from the hands of the oil\r\n    presser the result of my most recent experiment on the ground nut,\r\n    which I am happy to say is encouraging. I send you a sample of the\r\n    oil extracted from them. They are from the Gambia. It is a pure\r\n    golden colored oil, with a pleasant flavor, free from the frequent\r\n    rancidity of olive oil.\"\r\n\r\nSince then the cultivation has gone on, and the exportation largely\r\nincreased. The French also have entered into the trade, and several\r\nvessels are exclusively employed in exporting this product from the\r\nriver Gambia, conveying it to oil factors on the continent, who\r\nextract its oil. Seeing, then, the many advantages the cultivation of\r\nsuch a product bestows, and its adaptation to the soil and climate of\r\nAustralia, I cannot refrain from expressing a hope that some of the\r\ninfluential landowners in the cultivated districts will give the\r\nmatter their consideration.\r\n\r\nI am informed by an American merchant that he cleared 12,000 dollars\r\nin one year, on the single article of ground or pea nuts obtained from\r\nAfrica. Strange as it may appear, nearly all these nuts are\r\ntranshipped to France, where they command a ready sale; are there\r\nconverted into oil, and thence find their way over the world in the\r\nshape of olive oil; the skill of the French chemists enabling them to\r\nimitate the real Lucca and Florence oil, so as to deceive the nicest\r\njudges. Indeed, the oil from the pea nuts possesses a sweetness and\r\ndelicacy that cannot be surpassed.\r\n\r\nAdvices from the West Coast of Africa to the 16th August, 1853, report\r\nthat the ground nut season had closed; the quantity shipped during the\r\nseason having exceeded 900,000 bushels. The yield has increased 20 per\r\ncent, each year for the last three years, and it is expected the\r\nincrease will be still greater in the forthcoming season.\r\n\r\nTEUSS OIL.--The Chinese use what is called teuss or tea oil, for food\r\nand other purposes. I have alluded to it under the head of pulse, at\r\npage 312. It is obtained, however, from a species of the ground nut,\r\nand is sold in Hong Kong, at 2s. 6d. the gallon, being imported from\r\nthe main land. By a local ordinance it is imperative on every\r\nhouseholder at Victoria, Hong-Kong, to have a lamp burning over his\r\ndoor at night. When burning, this oil affords a clear, bright light,\r\nand is not so offensive to the smell as train and other common lamp\r\noils.\r\n\r\nTOBACCO SEED OIL.--A discovery, which may prove of some commercial\r\nimportance, appears to have been made by a British resident in Russia,\r\nnamely, that the seed of the tobacco plant contains about fifteen per\r\ncent. of an oil possessing peculiar drying properties, calculated to\r\nrender it a superior medium, especially for paints and varnishes. The\r\nprocess employed for the extraction of the oil is to reduce the seed\r\nto powder, and knead it into a stiff paste with _quantum sufficit_ of\r\nhot water, and then submit it to the action of strong fires. The oil\r\nthus obtained is exposed to a moderate heat, which, by coagulating the\r\nvegetable albumen of the seed, causes all impurities contained in the\r\noil to form a cake at the bottom of the vessel employed, leaving the\r\noil perfectly limpid and clear.\r\n\r\nPOPPY OIL.--About 80 cwt. of poppy seed is imported annually into\r\nHull, and small quantities come into other ports to be crushed into\r\noil. The seeds of the poppy yield, by expression, 56 per cent. of a\r\nbland and very valuable oil, of a pale golden color, fluid to within\r\nten degrees of the freezing point of water. It dries easily, is\r\ninodorous, and of an agreeable flavor like olive oil.\r\n\r\nDr. J.V.C. Smith, writing from Switzerland, to the editor of the\r\n\"Boston Medical Journal,\" says:--\r\n\r\n    \"Immense crops are raised here of articles wholly unknown to the\r\n    American farmers, and perhaps the kinds best fitted to particular\r\n    localities where grain and potatoes yield poorly under the best\r\n    efforts. One of these is poppies. Thousands of acres are at this\r\n    moment ready for market--which the traveller takes for granted, as\r\n    he hurries by, are to be manufactured into opium. They are not,\r\n    however, intended for medical use at all, but for a widely different\r\n    purpose. From the poppy seed a beautiful transparent oil is made,\r\n    which is extensively used in house painting. It is almost as\r\n    colorless as water, and possesses so many advantages over the flax\r\n    seed oil that it may ultimately supersede that article. Where flax\r\n    cannot be grown poppies often can be, in poor sandy soil. Linseed\r\n    oil is becoming dearer, and the demand for paint is increasing. With\r\n    white lead, poppy oil leaves a beautiful surface, which does not\r\n    afterwards change, by the action of light, into a dirty yellow.\r\n    Another season some one should make a beginning at home in this\r\n    important branch of industry. The oil may be used for other\r\n    purposes, and even put in the cruet for salads.\"\r\n\r\nTALLICOONAH or KUNDAH OIL, is obtained from the seeds of the _Carapa\r\nTouloucouna_ (of the Flore de Senegambie). The tree grows to the\r\nheight of 40 feet; the fruit is a large, somewhat globular five-celled\r\ncapsule. The seeds (of which there are from 18 to 30 in each capsule),\r\nvary in size from that of a chesnut to a hen's egg. They are\r\nthree-cornered, of a brownish or blackish red color. It is found\r\nabundantly in the Timneh country, and over the colony of Sierra Leone.\r\nIt is manufactured in the following manner:--The nuts having been well\r\ndried in the sun, are hung up in wicker racks or hurdles, and exposed\r\nto the smoke of the huts, after which they are roasted and subjected\r\nto trituration in large wooden mortars, until reduced to a pulp. The\r\nmass is then boiled, when the supernatant oil is removed by skimming.\r\nThe natives principally prepare the oil to afford light; the leaves\r\nare used by the Kroomen as a thatch. It is held in high estimation as\r\nan anthelmintic. The oil is sold in Sierra Leone at 2s. a gallon, and\r\ncould be procured in abundance from the coast as an article of\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nCARAP or CRAB OIL (_Carapa guianensis_).--This is a sort of vegetable\r\nbutter, being sometimes solid and sometimes half fluid, which is\r\nobtained from the seed of a large tree abundant in the forests of\r\nGuiana, and also found in Trinidad. It is said to turn rancid very\r\nsoon when exposed to the air, but this is probably caused by the\r\npresence of impurities, arising from the crude and imperfect way in\r\nwhich it is prepared by the natives, who boil the kernels, leave them\r\nin a heap for a few days, then skim them, and lastly reduce them into\r\na paste in a wooden mortar, which is then spread on an inclined board,\r\nand exposed to the heat of the sun, so that the oil may melt and\r\ngradually trickle down into a vessel placed below to receive it. A\r\nprize medal was awarded for this oil at the Great Exhibition in 1851.\r\n\r\nCarap oil in Trinidad is highly esteemed as an unguent for the hair,\r\nand also for applying to the wounds of animals, for destroying ticks\r\nand other insects which infest cattle--also for the cure of\r\nrheumatism. An oil called Carap oil is also obtained in the East, from\r\nthe almonds of _Xylocarpus granatum_, or _Carapa Molluccensis_, of\r\nLanark, which is used by the natives to dress the hair and anoint the\r\nskin, so as to keep off insects.\r\n\r\nCacao fat, the butter-like substance obtained from the seeds of\r\n_Theobroma cacao_, is esteemed as an emollient.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the Great Macaw tree (_Acrocomia fusiformis_), a majestic\r\nspecies of palm, furnishes much oil. This tree is the _Cocos\r\nfusiformis_, of Jacquin, and other intertropical botanists. It is a\r\nnative of Trinidad and Jamaica, and is found also very commonly in\r\nSouth America.\r\n\r\nThe method of extracting the oil is as follows:--The nut or kernel is\r\nslightly roasted and cleaned, then ground to a paste, first in a mill,\r\nand then on a livigating stone. This paste, gently heated and mixed\r\nwith 3-10ths of its weight of boiling water, is put into a bag, and\r\nthe oil expressed between two heated plates of iron; it yields about\r\n7-10ths or 8-10ths of oil. If discolored it can be purified, when\r\nmelted, by filtration. It is then of the consistence of butter, of a\r\ngolden yellow hue, the odor that of violets, and the taste sweetish.\r\nIf well preserved it will keep several years without spoiling, which\r\nis known to have taken place by the loss of its golden hue and\r\ndelightful aroma.\r\n\r\nIt is frequently sold in the shops as palm oil, and of late has\r\nentered largely into the composition of toilet soaps. As an emollient\r\nit is said to be useful in some painful affections of the joints; the\r\nnegroes deem it a sovereign remedy in \"bone ache.\" The nut itself is\r\nsometimes fancifully carved by the negroes, and is highly ornamental,\r\nbeing of a shining jet black, and susceptible of a very high polish.\r\nThis tree may be increased from suckers.\r\n\r\n_A. sclerocarpa_ is the Macahuba palm of Brazil.\r\n\r\nTHE AGAITI, as it is called by the Portuguese, or napoota by the\r\nnatives and Arabs (_Didynamia Gymosperma?_), much cultivated in all\r\nEastern Africa for its oil, which is considered equal to that of\r\nolives, and fetches as high a price in the Indian market. The plant,\r\nwhich is as tall and rank as hemp, and equally productive, having\r\nnumerous pods throughout the stems, is found everywhere in a wild as\r\nwell as cultivated state.\r\n\r\nThe \"Cape Shipping Gazette,\" of August, 1850, says:--\r\n\r\n    \"The attention of the George Agricultural and Horticultural Society\r\n    having been drawn to the fact that an excellent oil, equal to the\r\n    olive oil of Italy, can be extracted from the kernel of the fruit\r\n    known by the name of \"T Kou Pijte\" and \"Pruim Besje,\" they have\r\n    offered a reward of £10 for the best sample, not less than a half\r\n    aum of this oil--and £15 if it shall be adjudged equal to the best\r\n    oil of Italy. This fact is deserving of notice, as an instance of\r\n    the advantages which are likely to result from the attention now\r\n    being devoted to the natural productions of the colony.\"\r\n\r\n_Madia sativa_ is a handsome annual plant, native of Chili, which has\r\nbeen naturalised in Europe. It grows about two feet high, and produces\r\nflowers in July and August, of a pale yellow color.\r\n\r\nThe whole plant is viscid and exhales a powerful odor, which is\r\nsomewhat like heated honey. It requires rather a rich soil, of a\r\nferruginous character. The root is fusiform, the stem cylindrical, and\r\nfurnished with sessile, three to five longitudinally-nerved leaves,\r\nwhich are apposite on the lower portion of the stem, and alternate on\r\nthe upper. M. Victor Pasquier, who has written on the culture of the\r\nplant, analysed the seed, and found 100 parts to consist of 26.5 of\r\ntesta, and 73.5 of kernel; 100 parts of the latter yielded 31.3 of\r\nvegetable albumen, gum, and lignine, 56.0 of _fixed oil_, and 12.5 of\r\nwater. In dry seasons the oil is both more abundant and better than in\r\ndamp seasons. The produce of oil, compared with that of the poppy, is\r\nequal; with colza, as 32 to 28; with linseed, 32 to 21; with the\r\nolive, 32 to 16.\r\n\r\nThe leaves and stems of this plant are rejected by cattle; but the\r\noil-cake, which always contains a considerable portion of the oil,\r\nforms a nutritive food, of which they are very fond. The oil expressed\r\nwithout heat is transparent, of a golden yellow color, inodorous,\r\nrather fatter than the oil of rape or olives, and of a soft,\r\nagreeable, nutty taste. It is fit to be employed in the preparation of\r\nfood, in salads, and for all the purposes of the best and mildest\r\nfixed oils. It burns with a brilliant, reddish-white flame, and leaves\r\nno residue. It is little liable to become rancid, and is completely\r\ndecolorised by animal charcoal.\r\n\r\nThe oil of the seeds of this plant, now extensively cultivated in\r\nFrance, will yield, according to the observations of Braconnet, a\r\nsolid soap, similar to that made from olive oil. Boussingault obtained\r\nfrom the oil a solid, as well as a fluid acid. The solid one is\r\nprobably palmic acid, it fuses at exactly 140 degrees of Fahrenheit.\r\nThe fluid acid in its properties resembles the oleic acid discovered\r\nby Chevreul, and seems to dry easily.\r\n\r\nThe following is the composition of each, as determined by his\r\nanalysis:--\r\n\r\n                  Solid acid.     Fluid acid.\r\n  Carbon             74.2            76.0\r\n  Hydrogen           12.0            11.0\r\n  Oxygen             13.8            13.0\r\n                    ------          ------\r\n                    100.            100.\r\n\r\nCOCUM OIL, or butter, is obtained from the seeds of a kind of\r\nmangosteen (_Garcinia purpurea_), and used in various parts of India\r\nto adulterate ghee or butter. It is said to be exported to England for\r\nthe purpose of mixing with bears' grease in the manufacture of\r\npomatum. It is a white, or pale greenish yellow, solid oil, brittle,\r\nor rather friable, having a faint but not unpleasant smell, melting at\r\nabout 95 degrees, and when cooled after fusion remaining liquid to 75\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\nAn excellent solid oil, of a bright green color, is obtained from\r\nBombay, having a consistence intermediate between that of tallow and\r\nwax, fusible at about 95 degrees, and easily bleached; it has a\r\npeculiar and somewhat aromatic odor. There is some uncertainty as to\r\nthe plant from which it is obtained. It was referred to the _Salvadora\r\npersica_, and to the _Vernonia Anthelminticea_, a plant common in\r\nGuzerat and the Concan Ghats.\r\n\r\nA pale yellow clear oil is obtained from the seed of _Dolichos\r\nbiflorus_(_?_). Oil is also expressed in India from the seed of the\r\n_Argemone mexicana_, which is used for lamps and in medicine; and from\r\nthe seeds of the cashew nut (_Anacardium occidentale_), from _Sapindus\r\nmarginatus_, and the country walnut (_Aleurites triloba_.) The fruit\r\nof the _Chirongia sapinda_, (or _Buchanania latifolia_,) yields oil.\r\nFrom the seeds of the _Pongamia glabra_, or _Galidupa arborea_, a\r\nhoney brown and almost tasteless oil is procured, which is fluid at\r\ncommon temperatures, but gelatinises at 55 degrees.\r\n\r\nOther sources of oil are the _Celastrus paniculatus_ (_?_) _Balanites\r\nEgyptictca_ and the saul tree (_Shorea Robusta_).\r\n\r\nTHE CANDLE-TREE or PALO BE VELAS, (_Parmentiera cereifera_,\r\nSeemann.)--This tree, in the valley of the Chagres, South America,\r\nforms entire forests. In entering them a person might almost fancy\r\nhimself transported into a chandler's shop. From all the stems and\r\nlower branches hang long cylindrical fruits, of a yellow wax color, so\r\nmuch resembling a candle as to have given rise to the popular\r\nappellation. The fruit is generally from two to three, but not\r\nunfrequently four feet long, and an inch in diameter. The tree itself\r\nis about 24 feet high, with, opposite trifoliated leaves, and large\r\nwhite blossoms, which appear throughout the year, but are in greatest\r\nabundance during the rainy season. The _Palo de Velas_ belongs to the\r\nnatural order _Crescentiaceae_, and is a _Parmentiera_, of which genus\r\nhitherto only one species, the _P. edulis_, of De Candolle, was known\r\nto exist. The fruit of the latter, called _Quauhscilote_, is eaten by\r\nthe Mexicans, while that of the former serves for food to numerous\r\nherds of cattle. Bullocks especially, if fed with the fruit of this\r\ntree, guinea-grass, and _Batatilla_ (_Ipomoea brachypoda_, Benth.),\r\nsoon get fat. It is generally admitted, however, that the meat\r\npartakes in some degree of the peculiar apple-like smell of the fruit,\r\nbut this is by no means disagreeable, and easily prevented, if, for a\r\nfew days previous to killing the animal, the food is changed. The tree\r\nproduces its principal harvest during the dry season, when all the\r\nherbaceous vegetation is burned up, and on that account its\r\ncultivation in tropical countries is especially to be recommended; a\r\nfew acres of it would effectually prevent that want of fodder which is\r\nalways most severely felt after the periodical rains have\r\nceased.--(\"Hooker's Journal of Botany.\")\r\n\r\nCINNAMON SUET is extracted by boiling the fruit of the cinnamon. An\r\noily fluid floats on the surface, which on cooling subsides to the\r\nbottom of the vessel, and hardens into a substance like mutton suet.\r\nThe Singhalese make a kind of candles with it, and use it for culinary\r\npurposes. It emits a very pleasant aroma while burning. According to\r\nthe analysis of Dr. Christison, it contains eight per cent, of a fluid\r\nnot unlike olive oil; the remainder is a waxy principle.\r\n\r\nCROTON OIL is obtained by expression from the seeds or nuts of _Croton\r\nTiglium_, an evergreen tree, 15 to 20 feet in height, belonging to the\r\nsame order as the castor oil plant, producing whitish green flowers,\r\nand seeds resembling a tick in appearance, whence its generic name. It\r\nis a native of the East Indies. 100 parts of seeds afford about 64 of\r\nkernel. 50 quarters of croton nuts for expressing oil were imported\r\ninto Liverpool from the Cape Verd Islands, in 1849.\r\n\r\nThe _Croton Tiglium_ grows plentifully in Ceylon, and the oil, if\r\nproperly expressed, might be made an article of trade. The best mode\r\nof preparing it is by grinding the seeds, placing the powder in bags,\r\nand pressing between plates of iron; allow the oil to stand for\r\nfifteen days, then filter. The residue of the expression is triturated\r\nwith twice its weight of alcohol, and heated on the sand-bath from 120\r\nto 140 degs. Fahrenheit, and the mixture pressed again. In this step\r\nthe utmost caution is necessary in avoiding the acrid fumes. One seer\r\nof seed furnishes by this process rather more than eleven fluid ounces\r\nof oil, six by the first step, and five by alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe oil acts as an irritant purgative in the dose of one drop. In\r\nlarge doses it is a dangerous poison. When applied externally it\r\nproduces pustules.\r\n\r\nIn 1845, eight cases of croton oil and six cases of the seed were\r\nexported from Ceylon.\r\n\r\nOther species of Croton, as _C. Pavana_, a native of Ava and the\r\nnorth-eastern parts of Bengal, and _C. Roxburghii_, yield a purgative\r\noil. The bark of _C. Eleuteria_, _C. Cascarilla_, and other species is\r\naromatic, and acts as a tonic and stimulant. It forms the cascarilla\r\nbark of commerce already spoken of. When bruised, it gives out a musky\r\nodor and is often used in pastilles.\r\n\r\nThe oil obtained from the seeds of _Jatropha curcas_, a native of\r\nSouth America and Asia, is purgative and emetic, and analagous in its\r\nproperties to croton oil. It is said to be a valuable external\r\napplication in itch. In India it is used for lamps.\r\n\r\nOIL OF BEN, known as Sohrinja in Bengal, and Muringo in Malabar is\r\nobtained from the seeds or nuts of the horseradish tree, _Moringa\r\npterygosperma_, Burmann; the _Hyperanthera Moringa_, of Linnæus. This\r\nclear limpid oil having no perceptible smell, is much esteemed by\r\nwatchmakers and perfumers; it is expensive and not often to be\r\nprocured pure, consequently the oil would be a very profitable export.\r\nIt grows rapidly and luxuriantly everywhere in Jamaica, particularly\r\non the north side of the island--as well as Trinidad and other\r\nquarters of the West. It is easily propagated either by cuttings from\r\nthe tree (the branches) or by seeds, and bears the second year. The\r\nproduce of each tree may be estimated at from one to two gallons. From\r\nthe flowers a very pleasant perfume might be easily distilled.\r\n\r\nThe following account I derive from my friend Dr. Hamilton--\r\n\r\n    \"It is a small tree, of about twenty feet in height, of most rapid\r\n    growth, coming into flower within a few months after it has been\r\n    sown, and continuing to produce seeds and blossoms afterwards\r\n    throughout the year. The tree is now naturalised in the West Indies.\r\n    The timber is said to dye a fine blue, and the gum, which, exudes\r\n    from wounds in the bark, bears a strong resemblance to that obtained\r\n    from the _Astragalus tragacantha_, for which it might, no doubt, be\r\n    substituted.\r\n\r\n    The numerous racemes of white blossoms with which the tree is\r\n    constantly loaded, are succeeded by long triangular pods, somewhat\r\n    tourlose at the ends, and about two feet in length, when arrived at\r\n    the full growth. These pods, while yet young and tender, are not\r\n    unfrequently cooked and served up at the planter's tables like\r\n    asparagus, for which they are not a bad substitute. The pods, when\r\n    full grown, contain about fifteen seeds; each considerably larger\r\n    than a pea, with a membraneous covering expanding into three wings,\r\n    whence the specific name of _pterygosperma_. On removing the winged\r\n    envelope the seeds appear somewhat like pith balls; but upon\r\n    dividing them with the nail, they are found to abound in a clear,\r\n    colorless, tasteless, scentless oil, of which the proportion is so\r\n    large that it may be expressed from good fresh seeds by the simple\r\n    pressure of the nail. Geoffry informs us, that he obtained 30½\r\n    ounces of oil from eight pounds of the decorticated seeds, being at\r\n    the rate of very nearly 24 lbs. of oil from 100 lbs. of seed.\r\n\r\n    Notwithstanding the great value of its oil, and the facility with\r\n    which it can be obtained in the West Indies, the moringa has been\r\n    hitherto valued merely as an ornamental shrub, and cultivated for\r\n    the sake of its young pods or the horseradish of its roots, as\r\n    luxuries for the table.\r\n\r\n    The oil is peculiarly valuable for the formation of ointments, from\r\n    its capability of being kept for almost any length of time without\r\n    entering into combination with oxygen. This property, together with\r\n    the total absence of color, smell, and taste, peculiarly adapts it\r\n    to the purposes of the perfumer, who is able to make it the medium\r\n    for arresting the flight of those highly volatile particles of\r\n    essential oil, which constitute the aroma of many of the most\r\n    odoriferous flowers, and cannot be obtained by any other means, in a\r\n    concentrated and permanent form. To effect this, the petals of the\r\n    flowers, whose odor it is desired to obtain, are thinly spread over\r\n    flakes of cotton wool saturated with this oil, and the whole\r\n    enclosed in air tight tin cases, where they are suffered to remain\r\n    till they begin to wither, when they are replaced by fresh ones, and\r\n    the process thus continued till the oil has absorbed as much as was\r\n    desired of the aroma; it is then separated from the wool by\r\n    pressure, and preserved under the name of _essence_, in well stopped\r\n    bottles.\r\n\r\n    By digesting the oil thus impregnated in alcohol, which does not\r\n    take up the fixed oil, a solution of the aroma is effected in the\r\n    spirit, and many odoriferous tinctures or waters, as they are\r\n    somewhat inaccurately termed, prepared. By this process most\r\n    delicious perfumes might be obtained from the flowers of the _Acacia\r\n    tortuosa_, _Pancratium carribeum_, _Plumeria alba_, _Plumeria\r\n    rubra_, and innumerable other flowers, of the most exquisite\r\n    fragrance, which abound within the tropics, blooming unregarded, and\r\n    wasting their odors on the barren air.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OIL PALM.\r\n\r\nThere are several species of this genus of beautiful palms of the\r\ntribe _Cococinæ_, but that chiefly turned to account is _Elais\r\nguineensis_, a native of the Coast of Guinea to the south of Fernando\r\nPo, which furnishes the best oil.\r\n\r\nThere are three other varieties--_E. melanococca_, a native of New\r\nGranada, _E. Pernambucana_, common on the coast of Brazil, and _J.\r\noccidentalis_, indigenous to Jamaica. All the species grow well in a\r\nsandy loam and may be increased by suckers.\r\n\r\nThe value of the oil of this palm, as an article of commerce, is\r\nexemplified by the large annual imports, averaging more than 516,000\r\ncwt. for many years past.\r\n\r\nOur supplies of palm oil are almost wholly derived from the West Coast\r\nof Africa, of which it is the staple article of export.\r\n\r\nPalm oil has the greatest specific gravity of any of the fixed\r\nvegetable oils. It is used principally in this country for making\r\nyellow soap. But the inhabitants of the Guinea coast employ it for the\r\nsame purposes that we do butter.\r\n\r\nThe trade in palm oil has almost driven out the slave trade from the\r\nBight of Benin, which was a few years ago one of its principal seats.\r\nThe old slave traders at Whydah have generally gone into the palm oil\r\ntrade, and are carrying it on to a very great extent. In August 1849,\r\nno less than twelve vessels were lying at that port taking in oil;\r\nwhilst, only three years before, it was rare to see three vessels\r\nthere at once, and of those in all probability two would be slavers.\r\n\r\nThis palm is called Maba by the natives about the Congo river. It is\r\nmoneocious, which indeed Jacquin, by whom the genus was established,\r\nconcluded it to be, although first described as dioecious by Gaertner,\r\nwhose account has been adopted, probably without examination, by\r\nSchroder, Willdenow, and Persoon.\r\n\r\nThe average imports of this oil into Liverpool alone, have now been\r\nfor some years upwards of 18,000 tons, worth nearly £800,000 sterling,\r\nand giving employment to upwards of 30,000 tons of shipping; thus\r\nproving that the natives who formerly exported their brethren as a\r\nmatter of traffic, now find, at least, an equally profitable trade in\r\nthe exportation of the vegetable products of their native soil.\r\n\r\nPalm oil is produced by the nut of the tree, which grows in the\r\ngreatest abundance throughout Western Africa. The demand for it, both\r\nin Europe and America, is daily increasing, and there is no doubt it\r\nwill, ere long, become the most important article of African trade.\r\n\r\n          IMPORTS  INTO  LIVERPOOL.\r\n                    casks.            tons.\r\n  1835              28,500            9,500\r\n  1836              33,500           11,000\r\n  1837              26,000            9,900\r\n  1838              27,520           10,320\r\n  1839              36,500           14,300\r\n  1852    about       --             23,500\r\n\r\nIn the colony of Liberia, I notice the manufacture of a new article of\r\nAfrican production, which is called \"Herring's Palm Kernel Oil or\r\nAfrican Lard.\" It is thus spoken of in the newspapers of that Republic\r\n:--\r\n\r\n    We had been for a long time impressed with an idea that the oil\r\n    contained in the kernel of the palm nut, was superior both in\r\n    quality and appearance to that of palm oil, which is obtained from\r\n    the exterior part.\r\n\r\n    On making an effort to extract the oil from the kernel (which was by\r\n    means of a little machine, of our own invention and contrivance), we\r\n    found that our thoughts upon the matter were correct, that the oil\r\n    possessed admirable beauty in its appearance, with a taste, when\r\n    used for cooking purposes, unexcelled by that of the best lard.\r\n\r\n    After being made and set by, it assumes a consistence like that of\r\n    hard butter, and has to be cut out with a knife or spoon; its\r\n    appearance in this state is very beautiful, presenting such\r\n    richness, clearness, and adaptedness to table purposes, that one\r\n    would not suppose that this oil is obtained from the same tree from\r\n    which palm oil is, for there is as much disparity both in their\r\n    appearance and taste as there is between lard and butter.\r\n\r\n    The exquisite transparency which the kernel oil bears in a liquid\r\n    state, especially when undergoing the purifying process, is a cause\r\n    of admiration. On showing some of it to several foreigners, I was\r\n    asked in two instances which was the oil and which the water, or\r\n    whether it was oil or water; thus you may have an idea of its\r\n    clearness. We make two qualities of this oil, differing however in\r\n    taste only, the one being for table uses and the other for\r\n    exportation and for whatever use they may choose to put it to\r\n    abroad.\r\n\r\n    There have been many conjectures in respect to the uses to which\r\n    this oil might he put in foreign countries; but that it will be a\r\n    useful article, and especially in our trade, when made more\r\n    extensively, there can be no doubt, for the quantity in which it\r\n    might be had would undoubtedly introduce it to a respectable rank\r\n    among the other commodities of our productive country so eagerly\r\n    sought after.\r\n\r\n    There is nothing, to my knowledge, that can be turned to as good\r\n    account and at the same time so abundant and easily obtained, as the\r\n    palm kernel, for they are as common as the pebbles of stony land,\r\n    especially in this section of the country, where we have palm\r\n    orchards of spontaneous growth for miles together, and interspersing\r\n    the surrounding country in almost innumerable numbers.\r\n\r\n    According to statistical ascertainment, there is on an average\r\n    exported from this port, thirty thousand gallons of palm oil\r\n    annually, from which fact we ascertain demonstratively that the palm\r\n    kernels which are thrown away here (leaving out the whole leeward\r\n    coast of our possessions) are sufficient to make thirty thousand\r\n    gallons of oil, more or less. This is not at all a problematical\r\n    speculation of ours, but we feel authorised to advance this\r\n    assertion from the fact that one bushel of kernels, completely\r\n    worked up, will make two gallons of oil. But to work them up is the\r\n    thing, plentiful as they are; we however, hesitate not to say, that\r\n    it can be done and probably will be.\r\n\r\n    Having now so far conquered the difficulties attending the\r\n    manufacture of this oil, as that we can safely vouch a reasonable\r\n    supply for home consumption, we most cheerfully recommend it to the\r\n    citizens of this Republic, whose demands for it, for eating\r\n    purposes, we doubt not can be supplied, and on very reasonable\r\n    terms.\r\n\r\n    We will assure our customers that there will not be an ounce of dirt\r\n    or sediment in a hundred pounds of our oil.\r\n\r\nThe recent abolition of the soap duty, by stimulating the demand for\r\npalm oil, will have an instant effect on the trade and commerce of\r\nWestern Africa, by confirming the suppression of the slave trade, and\r\ngiving an additional impetus to negro improvement. It will also\r\nincrease the production for England of ground nuts, whence the oil so\r\nlargely used in making continental soaps is expressed. \"When (observes\r\na recent writer) the Portuguese first treated with that coast, they\r\nfound palm oil and ground nuts articles of native food, and so they\r\nremained down to a period within living memory. So used, they neither\r\nrequired any cultivation nor gave rise to any notions of property.\r\nThough whole tracts of country are crowded by the oil-palm tree,\r\nlittle care was taken of what was, in fact, superabundant; and as for\r\nground nuts, they were simply dug up as prudence or necessity\r\ndictated. Some thirty years ago a cask or two of palm oil was sent\r\nhome from the Gold Coast; it met so ready a sale that it was further\r\ninquired after, and the total amount now imported into England ranges\r\nfrom 25,000 to 30,000 tons annually. The exportation of ground nuts is\r\neven larger; but, owing to our excise on soap, they had heretofore\r\ngone principally to France---to Marseilles especially.\r\n\r\n\"Of these two articles, it is to be observed, the Western Coast of\r\nAfrica appears to have a monopoly; and with respect to palm oil, it is\r\nfurther to be remarked, that it is exactly behind those ports and up\r\nthose rivers, which were formerly the great nests of the slave trade,\r\nthat its production is largest; and just as the slave trade there has\r\nbeen crushed, a commerce in palm oil has sprung up and replaced it.\r\nThere are men alive who recollect the slave trade flourishing on the\r\nGold Coast; it has long been extinct there, and palm oil is now\r\nlargely exported. It is but a very few years ago since that traffic\r\nappeared to be irrepressible at the mouths of the Niger: it is now\r\nexpelled, and thence Liverpool obtains, instead, its supplies of palm\r\noil. So also, later still, at Whydah, and the other ports of the\r\nkingdom of Dahomy, and along the Lagoon, which connects Dahomy with\r\nthe Benin River, there the Spanish slave dealers are themselves\r\ninaugurating a commerce in palm oil. Already the trade in that quarter\r\nis considerable, and it would have extended much more rapidly than it\r\nhas done, were it not that disorder and warfare in the interior have\r\nbeen promoted and prolonged by the indiscreet zeal of some of our own\r\nnaval officers and by the desire of some of our missionaries to rule\r\nat Abeeokutu, at Lagos, and at Badagray. When, however, order and\r\ntranquillity are restored, a most important trade will undoubtedly\r\narise there. A generation ago, when palm oil was merely an article of\r\nfood, there was, we have said, no property in palm trees. Since,\r\nhowever, a large foreign demand has arisen for this oil, the\r\nplantations, as already they are called, begin to be cared for; and\r\nlately the title to some of them has been disputed in our courts on\r\nthe Gold Coast: a contention which constitutes the first evidence we\r\nhave received of the value of land, not actually under their own\r\ncultivation, being recognised by the natives. Thus the feeling of\r\nproperty and the desire for accumulation are springing up out of the\r\npalm oil trade; and they are everywhere the germs of nascent\r\ncivilisation. It is no light question, therefore, thus involved in an\r\nincreased demand for this article; it may produce African consequences\r\nof incalculable importance to the whole human race. It is in France\r\nhitherto that the great consumption of ground nut oil has occurred. It\r\nis there used in the manufacture of soaps, which, though preferred\r\nabroad, are little used in England--very much because of the Excise\r\nlaws. The specific gravity of the soap made out of ground nut oil is\r\nhigher than those laws permitted; in consequence we could neither make\r\nit for our own use nor for foreign exportation; and thus France has\r\nsubstantially the soap trade of the world. By the repeal of the duty,\r\nEngland will be enabled to compete--in this, as in all other\r\ntrades--with France abroad.\"\r\n\r\nThe price, in Liverpool, for palm oil, in October, 1853, was £38 10s.\r\nto £39 per ton.\r\n\r\nWe export annually nearly four million gallons of oil made from\r\nlinseed, hemp seed, and rape seed.\r\n\r\n  PALM  OIL  RETAINED  FOR  HOME  CONSUMPTION\r\n                 cwts.\r\n  1835          242,733\r\n  1836          234,357\r\n  1837          211,919\r\n  1838          272,991\r\n  1839          262,910\r\n  1840          314,881\r\n  1841          300,770\r\n  1842          353,672\r\n  1843          377,765\r\n  1844          363,335\r\n  1848          510,218\r\n  1849          493,331\r\n  1850          448,589\r\n  1851          493,598\r\n  1852          408,577\r\n\r\nThe quantity of the four principal vegetable oils annually imported\r\ninto Great Britain, is shown by the following figures:--\r\n\r\n              Palm oil.

The former is an evergreen shrub or low tree, with spiny\r\nbranches and round twigs; the latter is a taller tree, without\r\nspines, and with four-angled twigs. The fruit is a drupe about the\r\nsize and color of a damson. Its fleshy pericarp yields by expression\r\nolive oil, of which the finest comes from Provence and Florence.\r\nSpanish or Castile soap is made by mixing olive oil and soda, while\r\nsoft soap is made by mixing the oil with potash.\r\n\r\nThe wild olive is indigenous to Syria, Greece, and Africa, on the\r\nlower slopes of Mount Atlas. The cultivated species grows\r\nspontaneously in Syria, and is easily reared in Spain, Italy and the\r\nSouth of France, various parts of Australia and the Ionian Islands.\r\nWherever it has been tried on the sea-coasts of Australia, the success\r\nhas been most complete. There are several fine trees near Adelaide,\r\nsome of them fourteen feet high, bearing fruit in abundance.\r\nUnfortunately no one has attempted to cultivate the plant on a large\r\nscale, but in a few years Australia ought to suply herself with olive\r\noil.\r\n\r\nThe olive tree is also grown in Hong-Kong.\r\n\r\nThere are five or six varieties of _O. Europoea_, or _sativa_, grown in\r\nthe south of Europe, of which district they are for the most part\r\nnatives.\r\n\r\nThe entire exports of olive oil from the kingdom of Naples have been\r\nestimated at 36,333 tuns a year, which, taken at its mean value when\r\nexported at £62 per tun, is equivalent to the annual sum of\r\n£2,252,646.\r\n\r\nThere are one or two distinct species, natives of the East Indies and\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope. This genus of plants, besides their valuable\r\nproducts of oil and fruit, are also much admired for the fragrance of\r\ntheir white flowers. There is a yellow-blossomed variety, native of\r\nChina, _O. fragrans_, the Lan-hoa of the Chinese, which is used to\r\nperfume their teas.\r\n\r\nOlive oil now forms an article of export from Chili, being grown in\r\nmost parts of that republic, particularly in the vicinity of St. Jago,\r\nwhere trees of three feet in diameter, and of a proportionate height,\r\nare common. The olive was first carried from Andalusia to Peru in\r\n1560, by Antonio de Ribera, of Lima. Frezier speaks of the olive being\r\nused for oil in Chili, a century and a half ago.\r\n\r\nThe culture of the olive has been recommended for Florida and most of\r\nthe Southern States of America. Formerly, on account of its slow\r\ngrowth, the olive was not considered very useful; but some years since\r\na new variety was introduced into France, and into some parts of Spain\r\nand Portugal, which yields an abundant crop of fruit the second year\r\nafter planting. They are small trees or rather shrubs, about four or\r\nfive feet high. The fruit is larger than the common olive, is of a\r\nfine green color when ripe, and contains a great deal of oil, The\r\nadvantages accruing from this new mode of cultivating the olive tree,\r\nare beyond all calculation. By the old method an olive tree does not\r\nattain its full growth, and consequently does not yield any\r\nconsiderable crop under thirty years; whereas the new system of\r\ncultivating dwarf trees, especially from cuttings, affords very\r\nabundant crops in two or three. An acre of land can easily grow 2,500\r\ntrees of the new variety, and the gathering of the fruit is easy, as\r\nit can be done by small children. At Beaufort, South Carolina, the\r\nolive is cultivated from plants which were obtained in the\r\nneighbourhood of Florence, Italy.\r\n\r\nA gentleman in Mississippi is stated, by an American agricultural\r\njournal, to have olive trees growing, which at five years from the\r\ncutting bore fruit, and were as large at that age as they usually are\r\nin Europe at eight years old. The olive then, it is added, will yield\r\na fair crop for oil at four years from the nursery, and in eight years\r\na full crop, or as much as in Europe at from fifteen to twenty years\r\nof age.\r\n\r\nThe lands and climate there are stated to be as well adapted to the\r\nsuccessful cultivation of the olive for oil, pickles, &c., as any part\r\nof Europe. Some hundreds of the trees are grown in South Carolina, and\r\nthe owner expressed his conviction that this product would succeed\r\nwell on the sea-coast of Carolina and Georgia. The frosts, though\r\nsevere, did not destroy or injure them, and in one case, when the\r\nplant was supposed to be dead, and corn was planted in its stead, its\r\nroots sent out shoots. It is well known to be a tree of great\r\nlongevity, even reaching to 1,000 or 1,200 years; so that, when once\r\nestablished, it will produce crops for a great while afterwards. The\r\nexpense of extracting the oil is also stated to be but trifling.\r\n\r\nThe olive is of slow growth; trees 80 years of age measure only from\r\n27 to 30 inches in circumference at the lower part of their trunks. An\r\nolive tree is mentioned by M. Decandolle as measuring above 23 feet in\r\ncircumference, which, judging from the above inferences, may be safely\r\nestimated at 700 years old. Two other colossal olives are recorded,\r\none at Hieres, measuring in circumference 36 feet, and one near Genoa,\r\nmeasuring 38 feet 2 inches. The produce in fruit and oil is regulated\r\nby the age of the trees, which are frequently little fortunes to their\r\nowners. One at Villefranche produces on an average, in good seasons,\r\nfrom 200 to 230 pounds of oil. The tree at Hieres, above-mentioned,\r\nproduces about 55 imperial gallons.\r\n\r\nThe olive is found everywhere along the coast of Morocco, but\r\nparticularly to the south. The trees are planted in rows, which form\r\nalleys, the more agreeable because the trees are large, round, and\r\nhigh in proportion. They take care to water them, the better to\r\npreserve the fruit. Oil of olives might be here plentifully extracted\r\nwere taxation fixed and moderate; but such has been the variation it\r\nhas undergone, that the culture of olives is so neglected as scarcely\r\nto produce oil sufficient for domestic consumption.\r\n\r\nOlive oil might form one of the most valuable articles of export from\r\nMorocco. It is strong, dark, and fit only for manufacturing purposes.\r\nThis is, perhaps, not so much the fault of the olive as of the methods\r\nby which it is prepared. No care is taken in collecting the olives.\r\nThey are beaten from the trees with poles, as in Portugal and Spain,\r\nsuffered to lie on the ground in heaps until half putrified, then put\r\ninto uncleaned presses, and the oil squeezed through the filthy\r\nresiduum of former years. Good table oil might be made, if care were\r\ntaken, as in France and Lucca, to pick the olives without bruising\r\nthem, and to press only those that were sweet and sound. But such oil\r\nwould ill suit the palate of a Maroqueen, accustomed to drink by the\r\npint and the quart the rancid product of his country.\r\n\r\nThe olive is the great staple of Corfu, which has, in fact, the\r\nappearance of an extensive olive grove. It produces annually about\r\n200,000 barrels. Olive oil is also produced for the purposes of\r\ncommerce, and for local consumption, by France, Algiers, Tuscany,\r\nSpain, Sardinia, Portugal, Madeira, and South Australia.\r\n\r\nOlive plantations are extending considerably both in Upper and Lower\r\nEgypt. Large quantities of trees were planted under the direction of\r\nIbrahim Pasha.\r\n\r\nThe olive tree might be expected to be quickly matured at the Cape.\r\nThe native olive, resembling the European, is of spontaneous growth\r\nand plentiful, so that if the Spanish or Italian tree were introduced,\r\nthere is no doubt of its success. The wood of the olive is exceedingly\r\nhard and heavy, of a yellowish color, a close fine grain, capable of\r\nthe highest polish, not subject to crack nor to be affected by worms.\r\nThe root, in consequence of its variety of color, is much used for\r\nsnuff-boxes and similar bijouterie.\r\n\r\nThe wood is beautifully veined, and has an agreeable smell. It is in\r\ngreat esteem with cabinet makers, on account of the fine polish of\r\nwhich it is susceptible.\r\n\r\nThe sunny slopes of hills are best suited to its natural habits.\r\nLayering is the most certain mode of propagating this fruit, although\r\nit grows freely from the seed, provided it has first been steeped for\r\ntwelve hours in hot water or yeast.\r\n\r\nOlives intended for preservation are gathered before they are ripe. In\r\npickling, the object is to remove their bitterness and preserve them\r\ngreen, by impregnating them with a brine. For this purpose various\r\nmethods are employed. The fruit being gathered are placed in a lye,\r\ncomposed of one part of quicklime to six of ashes of young wood\r\nsifted. Here they remain for half a day, and are then put into fresh\r\nwater, being renewed every 24 hours; from this they are removed into a\r\nbrine of common salt dissolved in water, to which add some aromatic\r\nplants. The olive will in this manner remain good for twelve months.\r\nFor oil, the ripe fruit is gathered in November; the oil, unlike other\r\nplants, being obtained from the pericarp, and immediately bruised in a\r\nmill, the stones of which are set so wide as not to crush the kernel.\r\nThe pulp is then subjected to the press in bags made of rushes; and,\r\nby means of a gentle pressure, the best or virgin oil flows first. A\r\nsecond, and afterwards a third quality of oil is obtained, by\r\nmoistening the residuum, breaking the kernel, &c., and increasing the\r\npressure. When the fruit is not sufficiently ripe, the recent oil has\r\na bitterish taste, and when too ripe it is fatty.\r\n\r\nThe following are the present market prices of olive oil in\r\nLiverpool, (October, 1853,) and they are 40 per cent, higher than a\r\nfew years ago:--Galipoli, per tun of 252 gallons, £68; Spanish, £64;\r\nLevant, £60. French olives, in half barrels of two gallons, are worth\r\n£3 to £4; Spanish, in two gallon kegs, 9s. to 10s.\r\n\r\nThe preserved or pickled olives, so admired as an accompaniment to\r\nwine, are, as we have seen the green unripe fruit, deprived of part of\r\ntheir bitterness by soaking them in water, and then preserved in an\r\naromatised solution of salt.\r\n\r\nThe marc of olives after the oil has been expressed, indeed, the\r\nrefuse cake of all oil plants, is most valuable, either as manure or\r\nfor feeding cattle.\r\n\r\nMore than 29,000 acres are under culture with the olive in the\r\nAustrian empire, Venice, Dalmatia, Lombardy, Carinthia, and Carniola.\r\nThe climate of Dalmatia is highly suitable for the olive, and the oil\r\nis better than that produced in most parts of Italy. Nearly 17,000\r\ncwt. are annually obtained.\r\n\r\nIn 1837 there were 11,526 acres of ground under cultivation with\r\nolives in Southern Illyria, which yielded 261,800 gallons. Olives and\r\nsumach form the principal crops of the landholder. I have not been\r\nable to get any recent correct statistics of the culture and produce.\r\nThe oil of Istria is considered equal to that of Provence. The stones\r\nand refuse are used there for fuel. The olive is also extensively\r\ncultivated in the Quarnero Islands, especially Veglia and Cherso, and\r\nin Corfu. There were in 1836, 219,339 acres under cultivation in the\r\nIonian Islands, producing 113,219 barrels. The olive is gathered there\r\nin December. The average price of the barrel of olive oil was 48s. 3d.\r\nNearly two millions of gallons of olive oil were exported from Sicily\r\nin 1842. Naples alone shipped five millions of gallons in 1839, and\r\nabout 2,500 cwts. of oil is shipped annually from Morocco. Russia\r\nimports about 500,000 poods (40 lbs. each) of olive oil annually.\r\n\r\n\"Provence oil, the produce of Aix, is the most esteemed. Florence oil\r\nis the virgin oil expressed from the ripe fruit soon after being\r\ngathered; it is imported in flasks surrounded by a kind of network\r\nformed by the leaves of a monocotyledonous plant, and packed in half\r\nchests; it is that used at table under the name of salad oil. Lucca\r\noil is imported in jars holding nineteen gallons each. Genoa oil is\r\nanother fine kind. Galipoli oil forms the largest portion of the olive\r\noil brought to England, it is imported in casks. Apulia and Calabria\r\nare the provinces of Naples most celebrated for its production; the\r\nApulian is the best. Sicily oil is of inferior quality; it is\r\nprincipally produced at Milazzo. Spanish oil is the worst. The foot\r\ndeposited by olive oil is used for oiling machinery, under the name\r\nof' droppings of sweet oil.'\"--(\"Pereira's Materia Medica.\")\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of olive oil in Spain has undergone very considerable\r\nimprovement during the last few years; in particular, the process for\r\nexpressing the oil has been rendered more rapid and effectual by the\r\nintroduction of the hydraulic press, and thus the injurious\r\nconsequences which resulted from the partial fermentation of the fruit\r\nare avoided.\r\n\r\nThere are four different kinds of oil known in the districts where it\r\nis prepared.\r\n\r\n1. _Virgin oil_--A term which is applied, in the district Montpellier,\r\nto that which spontaneously separates from the paste of crushed\r\nolives. This oil is not met with in commerce, being all used by the\r\ninhabitants, either as an emollient remedy, or for oiling the works of\r\nwatches. A good deal of virgin oil is, however, obtained from Aix.\r\n\r\n2. _Ordinary oil_.--This oil is prepared by pressing the olives,\r\npreviously crushed and mixed with boiling water. By this second\r\nexpression, in which more pressure is applied than in the previous\r\none, an oil is obtained, somewhat inferior in quality to the virgin\r\noil.\r\n\r\n3. _Oil of the infernal regions_.--The water which has been employed\r\nin the preceding operation is in some districts conducted into large\r\nreservoirs called the _infernal regions_, where it is left for many\r\ndays. During this period, any oil that might have remained mixed with\r\nthe water separates and collects on the surface. This oil being very\r\ninferior in quality, is only fit for burning in lamps, and is\r\ngenerally locally used.\r\n\r\n4. _Fermented oil_ is obtained in the departments of Aix and\r\nMontpellier, by leaving the fresh olives in heaps for some time, and\r\npouring boiling water over them before pressing the oil. But this\r\nmethod is very seldom put in practice, for the olives during this\r\nfermentation lose their peculiar flavor, become much heated, and\r\nacquire a musty taste, which is communicated to the oil.\r\n\r\nThe fruity flavor of the oil depends upon the quality of the olives\r\nfrom which it is pressed, and not upon the method adopted in its\r\npreparation,\"--(French \"Journal de Pharmacie.\")\r\n\r\nThe price of olive oil is sufficiently high to lead to its admixture\r\nwith cheaper oils. The oil of poppy seeds is that which is usually\r\nemployed for its adulteration, as it has the advantage of being cheap,\r\nof having a sweet taste, and very little smell. M. Gobley has invented\r\nan instrument which he calls an areometer, to detect this fraud. It is\r\nfounded on the difference between the densities of olive oil and oil\r\nof poppies.\r\n\r\nThe imports, which in 1826 were only 742,719 gallons, had risen in\r\n1850 to 5,237,816 gallons. The following figures show the progressive\r\nimports and consumption:--\r\n\r\n              Imported.    Retained for home consumption.\r\n               gallons.         gallons.\r\n  1827        1,028,174        1,070,765\r\n  1831        4,158,917        1,928,892\r\n  1835          606,166          554,196\r\n  1839        1,793,920        1,806,178\r\n  1843        3,047,688        2,516,724\r\n  1847        2,190,384               --\r\n  1848        2,541,672               --\r\n  1849        4,274,928               --\r\n  1850        5,860,806               --\r\n  1851        2,898,756        2,749,572\r\n  1852        2,242,296        1,066,400\r\n\r\nThe imports of olive oil into the port of Liverpool were 9,815 tuns\r\nin 1849, and 10,038 tuns in 1850. It was brought from Manila, Malaga,\r\nand Corfu, but chiefly from Barbary, Palermo, Gallipoli, and the\r\nLevant. In 1850 we imported from France 259,646 imperial gallons of\r\nolive oil, officially valued at £34,638; the average in ordinary years\r\nis only about 20,000 gallons from the continent.\r\n\r\n\r\nALMOND OIL.--To the south of the Empire of Morocco there are forests\r\nof the Arzo tree, which is thorny, irregular in its form, and produces\r\na species of almond exceedingly hard. Its fruit consists of two\r\nalmonds, rough and bitter, from which an oil is produced, very\r\nexcellent for frying. In order to use this oil it requires to be\r\npurified by fire, and set in a flame, which must be suffered to die\r\naway of itself; the most greasy particles are thus consumed, and its\r\narid qualities wholly destroyed. \"When the Moors gather these fruits\r\nthey drive their goats under the trees, and as the fruit falls the\r\nanimals carefully nibble off the skins, and then greedily feed.\r\n\r\nThe oil of almonds is more fluid than olive oil, and of a clear,\r\ntransparent, yellowish color, with a very slight odor and taste. It is\r\noccasionally employed for making the finer kinds of soap, and also in\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\nIn manufacturing it the fruit are first well rubbed or shaken in a\r\ncoarse bag or sack, to separate a bitter powder which covers their\r\nepidermis. They are then pounded to a paste in mortars of marble,\r\nwhich paste is afterwards subjected to the action of a press, as in\r\nthe case of the olive.\r\n\r\nAbout 80 tuns of almond oil are annually imported into this country,\r\nthe price being about 1s. per pound. Five-and-a-half pounds of almond\r\noil will yield by cold expression one pound six ounces of oil, and\r\nthree-fourths of a pound more if the iron plates are heated.\r\n\r\n\r\nSESAME OR TEEL.--Of this small annual plant there are two or three\r\nspecies. _Sesamum orientale_, the common sort; and _S. indicum_, a\r\nmore robust kind, cultivated at a different season, are both natives\r\nof the East Indies. _S. indicum_ bears a pale purple flower, and _S.\r\norientals_ has a white blossom. It is the latter which is chiefly\r\ngrown, and the seeds afford the Gingellie oil or suffed-til, already\r\nextensively known in commerce in the East. The expressed oil is as\r\nclear and sweet as that from almonds, and probably the Behens oil,\r\nused in varnish, is no other. It is called by the Arabs \"Siriteh,\" and\r\nthe seed, \"bennie \" seed, in Africa. _S. orientals_ is grown in the\r\nWest Indies under the name of \"wangle.\" It is said to have been first\r\nbrought to Jamaica by the Jews as an article of food. 1,050 bags of\r\ngingelly teel, or sesame seed, were imported into Liverpool, in 1849,\r\nfrom the East, South America, and Africa, for expressing oil, and\r\n3,700 bags in 1850. There are two kinds of seed, light and dark, and\r\nit is about the same size as mustard seed, only not round.\r\n\r\nA hectare of land in Algeria yields 1,475 kilogrammes of seed, which\r\nestimated at 50 cents the kilogramme, amounts to 737 francs, whilst\r\nthe cost of production is only 259 francs, leaving a profit of 478\r\nfrancs (nearly £20). The oil obtained from this seed is inferior to\r\ngood olive oil, but is better adapted for the manufacture of soap.\r\n\r\nThis plant is not unlike hemp, but the stalk is cleaner and\r\nsemi-transparent. The flower also is so gaudy, that a field in blossom\r\nlooks like a bed of florist's flowers, and its aromatic fragrance does\r\nnot aid to dispel such delusion. It flourishes most upon land which is\r\nlight and fertile. The fragrance of the oil is perceptibly weaker when\r\nobtained from seed produced on wet, tenacious soils. A gallon of seed\r\nseems to be the usual quantity sown upon an acre. In Bengal, _S.\r\norientale_ is sown during February, and the crop harvested at the end\r\nof May; but _S. indicum_ is sown on high, dry soil, in the early part\r\nof the rains of June, and the harvest occurs in September. About\r\nPoonah it is sown in June and harvested in November. In Nepaul two\r\ncrops are obtained annually; one is sown as a first crop in April and\r\nMay, and reaped in October and November; the other as an autumn crop,\r\nafter the upland rise in August and September, and reaped in November\r\nand December.\r\n\r\nIn Mysore, after being cut it is stacked for a week, then exposed to\r\nthe sun for three days, but gathered into heaps at night; and between\r\nevery two days of such drying, it is kept a day in the heap. By this\r\nprocess, the pods burst and shed their seeds without thrashing.\r\n\r\nThe seeds contain an abundance of oil, which might be substituted for\r\nolive oil; it is procured from them in great quantities, in Egypt,\r\nIndia, Kashmir, China, and Japan, where it is used both for cooking\r\nand burning. It will keep for many years and not acquire any rancid\r\nsmell or taste, but in the course of a year or two becomes quite mild,\r\nso that when the warm taste of the seed, which is in the oil when\r\nfirst expressed, is worn off, it is used for all the purposes of salad\r\noil. It possesses such qualities as fairly entitle it to introduction\r\ninto Europe; and if divested of its mucilage, it might perhaps compete\r\nwith oil of olives, at least for medicinal purposes, and could be\r\nraised in any quantity in the British Indian Presidencies. It is\r\nsufficiently free from smell to admit of being made the medium for\r\nextracting the perfume of the jasmine, the tuberose, narcissus,\r\ncamomile, and of the yellow rose. The process is managed by adding one\r\nweight of flowers to three weights of oil in a bottle, which being\r\ncorked is exposed to the rays of the sun for forty days, when the oil\r\nis supposed to be sufliciently impregnated for use. This oil, under\r\nthe name of Gingilie oil, is used in India to adulterate oil of\r\nalmonds.\r\n\r\nThe flour of the seed, after the oil is expressed, is used in making\r\ncakes, and the straw serves for fuel and manure.\r\n\r\nThe oil is much used in Mysore for dressing food, and as a common lamp\r\noil. From 200 to 400 quarters under the name of Niger seed are\r\nimported annually into Liverpool for expressing oil.\r\n\r\nThree varieties of Til are extensively cultivated throughout India,\r\nfor the sake of the fine oil expressed from their seeds, the white\r\nseeded variety, the parti-colored, and the black. It is from the\r\nlatter that the sesamum or gingelly oil of commerce is obtained.\r\nSesamum seed contains about 45 per cent. of oil. Good samples of the\r\noil were shown at the Great Exhibition from Vizianagram, Ganjain,\r\nHyderabad, Tanjore, the district of Moorshedabad, and Gwalior. The\r\ngingelly seed is stated to be worth about £4 per ton in the North\r\nCircars.\r\n\r\nAn oil resembling that of sesamum is obtained from the seed of\r\n_Guizotea oleifera_ and _Abyssinica_, a plant introduced from\r\nAbyssinia, and common in Bengal. The ram til, or valisaloo seeds,\r\nyield about 34 per cent, of oil. The oil is generally used for\r\nburning, and is worth locally about 10d. per gallon.\r\n\r\nBLACK TIL (_Verbesena sativa_).--This is known as kutsela or kala til,\r\nin the Deccan. It is chiefly cultivated in Mysore and the western\r\ndistricts of Peninsular India, as well as in the Bombay presidency.\r\n\r\nAbout Seringapatam, as soon as the millet crop has been reaped the\r\nfield is ploughed four times, and the seed sown, a gallon per acre,\r\nduring the month of July or August, after the first heavy rain. No\r\nmanure or weeding is required, for the crop will grow on the worst\r\nsoils. It is reaped in three months, being cut close to the ground,\r\nand stacked for a week. After exposure to the sun for two or three\r\ndays, the seed is beaten out with a stick. The crop in Mysore rarely\r\nyields two bushels per acre, but about Poonah the produce is much\r\nlarger. The seed is sometimes parched and made into sweetmeats, but is\r\nusually grown for its oil. This is used in cooking, but it is not so\r\nabundant in the seed, nor so good as that of the sesame. Bullocks will\r\nnot eat the stems unless pressed by hunger.\r\n\r\nAbout 5,000 maunds are exported annually from Calcutta. 3,703 bags\r\nwere imported into Liverpool in 1851. The price per quarter of eight\r\nbushels, in January, 1853, was from 30s. to £2; of teel oil, in tins,\r\nweighing 60 to 100 pounds, £2 to £2 4s.\r\n\r\nBombay linseed was worth £2 11s. to £2 12s. the quarter of eight\r\nbushels, in January, 1853. Bengal ditto 2s. less. The imports into\r\nLiverpool were 68,468 bags and 54,834 pockets in 1851, and 14,490 bags\r\nand 33,700 pockets in 1852. About 9,000 bags of mustard seed and from\r\n18,000 to 20,000 bags of rape seed are also imported thence. The price\r\nof the latter is about £2 the quarter.\r\n\r\nNATIVE OIL MILLS.--The principal native oil mill of India, of which,\r\nhowever, there are some varieties, consists of a simple wooden mortar\r\nwith revolving pestle. It is in common use in all Belgaum and\r\nBangalore. Two oxen are harnessed to the geering, which depends from\r\nthe extremity of the pestle,--a man sits on the top of the mortar, and\r\nthrows in the seeds that may have got displaced. The mill grinds twice\r\na day; a fresh man and team being employed on each occasion. When\r\nsesame oil is to be made, about seventy seers measure, or two and a\r\nhalf bushels of seeds are thrown in; to this ten seers, or two quarts\r\nand three-quarters of water, are gradually added; this on the\r\ncontinuance of the grinding, which lasts in all six hours, unites with\r\nthe fibrous portion of the seeds, and forms a cake, which, when\r\nremoved, leaves the oil clean and pure at the bottom of the mortar.\r\nFrom this it is taken out by a coco-nut shell cup, on the pestle being\r\nwithdrawn. Other seed oils are described by Dr. Buchanan, as made\r\nalmost entirely in the same way as the sesamum. The exceptions are the\r\nhamlu, or castor oil, obtained from either the small or large\r\nvarieties of _Ricinus_. This, at Seringapatam, is first parched in\r\npots, containing something more than a seer each. It is then beaten in\r\na mortar, and formed into balls; of these from four to sixteen seers\r\nare put in an earthenware pot and boiled with an equal quantity of\r\nwater, for the space of five hours; frequent care being taken to stir\r\nthe mixture to prevent it from burning. The oil now floats on the\r\nsurface, and is skimmed off pure. The oil mill made use of at Bombay,\r\nand to the northward, at Surat, Cambay, Kurrachee, &c., differs a\r\nlittle from that just described, in having a very strong wooden frame\r\nround the mouth of the mortar; on this the man who keeps the seeds in\r\norder sits. In Scinde a camel is employed to drive the mill instead of\r\nbullocks.\r\n\r\nCastor oil seed is thrown into the mill like other seeds, as already\r\ndescribed; when removed it requires to be boiled for an hour, and then\r\nstrained through a cloth to free it from the fragments of the seed.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact, and illustrative of the imperfect manner in\r\nwhich the oil is separated from the seeds, that while the common\r\npressman only obtained some 26¼ per cent., Boussingault, in his\r\nlaboratory, from the same seeds, actually procured 41 per cent. When\r\nthe oil cakes are meant for feeding stock, this loss is of little\r\nconsequence, inasmuch as the oil serves a very good purpose, but when\r\nthe cake is only intended to be used as a manure, it is a great loss,\r\ninasmuch as the oil is of little or no use in adding any food for\r\ncrops to the soil.\r\n\r\nThe chief oil made on the sea board of India, is that yielded by the\r\ncoco-nut palm. The nut having been stripped of the husk or coir, the\r\nshell is broken, and the fatty lining enclosing the milk is taken out.\r\nThis is called cobri, copra, or copperah in different localities.\r\nThree maunds, or ninety pounds of copperah, are thrown into the mill\r\nwith about three gallons of water, and from this is produced three\r\nmaunds, or seven and three-quarter gallons of oil. The copperah in its\r\nunprepared state is sold, slightly dried in the market. It is burned\r\nin iron cribs or grates, on the top of poles as torches, in\r\nprocessions, and as means of illumination for work performed in the\r\nopen air at night. No press or other contrivance is made use of by the\r\nnatives in India for squeezing out or expressing the oil from the\r\ncake, and a large amount of waste, in consequence of this, necessarily\r\nensues.--_Bombay Times_, June 5, 1850.\r\n\r\nOil, of the finest kind, is made in India by expression from the\r\nkernels of the apricot. It is clear, of a pale yellow color, and\r\nsmells strongly of hydrocyanic acid, of which it contains, usually,\r\nabout 4 per cent.\r\n\r\n\"On inquiring into the use made of the sunflower, we were given to\r\nunderstand that it is here (in Tartary) raised chiefly for the oil\r\nexpressed from it. But it is also of use for many other purposes. In\r\nthe market places of the larger towns we often found the people eating\r\nthe seeds, which, when boiled in water, taste not unlike the boiled\r\nIndian corn eaten by the Turks. In some districts of Russia the seeds\r\nare employed with great success in fattening poultry; they are also\r\nsaid to increase the number of eggs more than any other kind of grain.\r\nPheasants and partridges eat them with great avidity, and find the\r\nsame effects from them as other birds. The dried leaves are given to\r\ncattle in place of straw; and the withered stalks are said to produce\r\na considerable quantity of alkali.\"--_Bremner's Interior of Russia._\r\n\r\n658 barrels linseed oil were brought down to New Orleans from the\r\ninterior in 1849, and 1009 in 1848.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of the Great Exhibition special enquiry was made by\r\nmany manufacturers as to the different oils of Southern India,\r\nsuitable for supplying the place of animal fat in the manufacture of\r\ncandles, and generally adapted for various other purposes. Enquiries\r\nshould be directed to the specific gravity, the boiling point, the per\r\ncentage of pure oil in the seeds, and the means of obtaining a regular\r\nsupply. The demand for vegetable oils in European commerce has been\r\nsteadily on the increase for several years past, and the quantities\r\nconsumed are now so large that the oleaginous products of India and\r\nthe colonies must sooner or later have a considerable commercial\r\nimportance, from the value which they are likely to acquire. Indeed\r\nsome have already established a footing in the home market, and Drs.\r\nHunter, Cleghorn, and others in India, have specially directed the\r\nattention of the natives and merchants to the subject.\r\n\r\nMARGOSE, OR NEEM OIL.--From the pericarp or fleshy part of the fruit\r\nof the _Melia Azederachta_, the well known Margosa oil is prepared;\r\nwhich is cheap and easily procurable in Ceylon. Dr. Maxwell, garrison\r\nsurgeon of Trichinopoly, states that he has found this oil equally\r\nefficacious to cod-liver oil in cases of consumption and scrofula. He\r\nbegan with half-ounce doses, morning and evening, which were gradually\r\nreduced.\r\n\r\nILLEPE OIL.--The seeds of three species of Bassia, indigenous to\r\nIndia, yield solid oils, and are remarkable for the fact, that they\r\nsupply at the same time saccharine matter, spirit, and oil, fit for\r\nboth food and burning in lamps. The Illepe( _B. longifolia_) is a tree\r\nabundant in the Madras Presidency, the southern parts of Hindostan\r\ngenerally, and the northern province of Ceylon. In Ceylon the\r\ninhabitants use the oil in cooking and for lamps. The oil cake is\r\nrubbed on the body as soap, and seems admirably adapted for removing\r\nthe unctuosity of the skin caused by excessive perspiration, and for\r\nrendering it soft, pliable, and glossy, which is so conducive to\r\nhealth in a tropical climate. The oil is white and solid at common\r\ntemperatures, fusing at from 70 to 80 degrees. It may be\r\nadvantageously employed in the manufacture of both candles and soap;\r\nin Ceylon and some parts of India this oil forms the chief ingredient\r\nin the manufacture of soap.\r\n\r\nMahower (_B. latifolia_) is common in most parts of the Bengal\r\nPresidency. The oil a good deal resembles that last described,\r\nobtained from the Illepe seeds; and may be used for similar purposes.\r\nIt is solid at common temperatures, and begins to melt at about 70\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\nVegetable butter is obtained from the Choorie (_B. butyracea_). This\r\ntree, though far less generally abundant than the other two species,\r\nis common in certain of the hilly districts, especially in the eastern\r\nparts of Kumaon; in the province of Dotee it is so abundant that the\r\noil is cheaper than ghee, or fluid butter, and is used to adulterate\r\nit. It is likewise commonly burnt in lamps, for which purpose it is\r\npreferred to coco-nut oil. It is a white solid fat, fusible at about\r\n120 degrees, and exhibits very little tendency to become rancid when\r\nkept.\r\n\r\nShea, or galam butter, is obtained in Western Africa from the _Bassia\r\nParkii_, or _Pentadisma butyracea_, a tree closely resembling the _B.\r\nlatifolia_, and other species indigenous to Hindostan. According to\r\nPark, the tree is abundant in Bambara, the oil is solid, of a\r\ngreyish-white color, and fuses at 97 degrees. Its product is used for\r\na variety of purposes--for cooking, burning in lamps, &c.\r\n\r\nThis tree has much of the character of the laurel, but grows to the\r\nheight of eighteen or twenty feet. Its leaf is somewhat longer than\r\nthe laurel, and is a little broader at the point; the edges of the\r\nleaf are gently curved, and are of a dark sap green color. The nut is\r\nof the form and size of a pigeon's egg, and the kernel completely\r\nfills the shell. When fresh it is of a white drab color, but, if long\r\nkept, becomes the color of chocolate. The kernel, when new, is nearly\r\nall butter, which is extracted in the following manner:--The shell is\r\nremoved from the kernel, which is also crushed, and then a quantity is\r\nput into an earthen pot or pan, placed over the fire with a portion of\r\nwater and the nut kernels. After boiling slowly about half an hour the\r\nwhole is strained through a grass mat into a clean vessel, when it is\r\nallowed to cool. Then, after removing the fibrous part from it, it is\r\nput into a grass bag and pressed so as to obtain all the oil. This is\r\npoured into the vessel along with the first-mentioned portion, and\r\nwhen cold is about the consistence of butter.\r\n\r\nThe nuts hang in bunches from the different boughs, but each nut has\r\nits own fibre, about seven or eight inches long, and about the\r\nthickness and color of whip-cord. The nut is attached to the fibre in\r\na very singular manner. The end of the fibre is concealed by a thin\r\nmembrane, about half an inch wide and three-quarters of an inch long.\r\nThis membrane is attached to the side of the nut, and, when ripe,\r\nrelinquishes its hold, and the nut falls to the ground, when it is\r\ngathered for use. A good-sized healthy tree yields about a bushel of\r\nnuts, but the greater number are not so prolific. The trees close to\r\nthe stream present a more healthy appearance, probably on account of\r\nbeing better watered, and the fire being less powerful close to the\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nTHE CANDLE NUT TREE (_Aleurites triloba_, of Foster) grows in the\r\nPolynesian Islands, and is also met with in some parts of Jamaica and\r\nthe East Indies. In the latter quarter it is known as the Indian\r\nAkhrowt. A very superior kind of paint oil is produced from the nut,\r\nand the cake, after the expression of the oil, forms an excellent food\r\nfor cattle, and a useful manure. 31½ gallons of the nut yield ten\r\ngallons of oil, which bears a good price in the home markets.\r\n\r\nThe yearly produce of this oil in the Sandwich Isles, where it is\r\ncalled kukui oil, is about 10,000 gallons. It has been shipped to the\r\nmarkets of Chili, New South Wales, and London, but not as yet with\r\nmuch profit. It realized about £20 per imperial ton in the port of\r\nLondon. In 1843, about 8,620 gallons were shipped from Honolulu,\r\nvalued at 1s. 8d. per gallon.\r\n\r\nIn Ceylon the oil is known as kekune oil, and a good deal of it might\r\nbe obtained there from the district of Badulla. From the trials made\r\nit appears that it cannot be used as a drying oil, but will probably\r\nanswer best as a substitute for rape oil. Samples have been sent to\r\nseveral clothiers, and the nature and quality of the oil renders it\r\nmost applicable to their purposes.\r\n\r\nCOLZA (_Brassica oleracea_), a variety of the common cabbage, is much\r\ngrown in the South of Europe and other parts, for the oil obtained by\r\npressure from its seeds, and which is used for lamps and other\r\npurposes. The plant will not thrive on sand or clay, but requires a\r\nrich light soil. After the ground has been well ploughed and manured,\r\nthe seed should be sown in July, in furrows eight or ten inches\r\nasunder. The plants are transplanted about October. When ripe the\r\nstalks are reaped with a sickle, and the seeds threshed out with a\r\nflail. The cake, after the oil is expressed, is an excellent food for\r\ncattle.\r\n\r\nLike all the oleaginous plants cultivated for their seed, colza\r\ngreatly impoverishes the soil.\r\n\r\nIn Peru the caoutchouc is used as a substitute for candles. A roll of\r\nit (which is generally about a yard long and three inches in diameter)\r\nis cut lengthways into four parts, but before it is lighted the piece\r\nis rolled up in a green plantain leaf, to prevent it from melting or\r\ntaking fire down the sides. The natives of Peru also bruize the beans\r\nof a species of wild cacao after they have been well dried, and use\r\nthe substance instead of tallow in their lamps.\r\n\r\nMr. Dearman, writing from Dacca, to Dr. Spry, Secretary to the\r\nAgricultural and Horticultural Societies of India, in 1839, says--\"I\r\nwill send you some seeds from a tree, which resemble chestnuts. One of\r\nthese seeds, after taking off the shell, being stuck on the point of\r\na penknife, and lighted at a candle flame, will burn without the least\r\nodor for four or five minutes, giving a light equal to two or three\r\ncandles. From the flower of the tree (he adds), I am told, is\r\ndistilled a delightful scent.\" [I presume this must be the candle-nut\r\ntree.]\r\n\r\nAt the Feejee and Hawaian islands, the seeds of the castor oil plant\r\nand of the candle-nut tree (_Aleurites triloba_) are strung together\r\nand used for candles. Species of torches are also made from the candle\r\nwood in Demerara.\r\n\r\nTHE CANDLEBERRY MYRTLE (_Myrica cerifera_) abounds in the Bahama\r\nIslands. The shrub produces a small green berry, which, like the hog\r\nplum, puts out from the trunk and larger limbs. Much patient labor is\r\nrequired in gathering these berries, and from them is obtained a\r\nbeautiful green wax, which burns very nearly, if not fully, as well as\r\nthe spermaceti, or composition candles imported from abroad. Not long\r\nsince Mr. Thos. B. Musgrove, of St. Salvador (or Cat Island), obtained\r\nabout 80 lbs. of this wax, and made some excellent candles of it. The\r\nmethod of procuring this wax is by boiling the berries in a copper or\r\nbrass vessel for some time. Iron pots are found to darken and cloud\r\nthe wax. The vessel after a sufficient time is taken from the fire,\r\nand when cool the hardened wax, floating on the top of the water, is\r\nskimmed off.\r\n\r\nMYRTLE WAX.--According to the experiments of M. Cadet and Dr. Bostock,\r\nmyrtle wax differs in many respects from bees' wax, Specimens of it\r\nassume shades of a yellowish green color. Its smell is also different;\r\nmyrtle wax, when fresh, emitting a fragrant balsamic odor. It has in\r\npart the unctuosity of bees' wax, and somewhat of the brittleness of\r\nresin. Its specific gravity is greater, insomuch that it sinks in\r\nwater, whereas bees' wax floats upon it; and it is not so easily\r\nbleached to form white wax. The wax tree of Louisiana contains immense\r\nquantities of wax.\r\n\r\nMr. Moodie (\"Ten Tears in South Africa\") says,--\r\n\r\n    \"I occasionally employed my people, at spare times, in gathering wax\r\n    berries that grow in great abundance upon small bushes in the sand\r\n    hills, near the sea, and yield a substance partaking of the nature\r\n    of wax and tallow, which is mixed with common tallow, and used by\r\n    the colonists for making candles. The berry is about the size of a\r\n    pea, and covered with a bluish powder. They are gathered by\r\n    spreading a skin on the sand, and beating the bush with a stick.\r\n    When a sufficient quantity of the berries are collected, they are\r\n    boiled in a great quantity of water, and the wax is skimmed off as\r\n    fast as it rises; the wax is then poured into flat vessels and\r\n    allowed to cool, when it becomes hard and brittle, and has a\r\n    metallic sound when struck. The cakes thus formed are of a deep\r\n    green color, and are sold at the same price as tallow. The wild pigs\r\n    devour these berries when they come in their way, and seem very fond\r\n    of them.\"\r\n\r\nA good specimen of myrtle, or candleberry wax, accompanied by candles\r\nmade from it in the crude unbleached state in New Brunswick, was shown\r\nat the Great Exhibition.\r\n\r\nVegetable wax was also sent from Shanghae, in China; from St. Domingo,\r\nin the northern parts of which the plant is indigenous; and a\r\nremarkable specimen from Japan. This substance, from its high melting\r\npoint and other physical characteristics, has of late attracted a good\r\ndeal of attention; it is admirably suited as a material for the\r\nmanufacture of candles.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Central Board, at Cape Town, in March, 1853, the\r\nmembers voted about £300, to employ some 20 or 30 men, in gathering\r\nberries from the Downs, and making wax during the winter months, that\r\nis, from the beginning of May to the end of September. The wax fetches\r\na good price in the Cape market.\r\n\r\n    In the annual report of the Cape of Good Hope Agricultural Society,\r\n    in May, 1853, a very fine sample of myrtle, or terry wax, grown on\r\n    the Cape Flats, was exhibited by Mr. Feeny, Superintendent of the\r\n    Road Plantation, by direction of the Commissioners of the Central\r\n    Road Board, in different stages of purification, from green to\r\n    white, as also some candles; and it being conceived by the meeting\r\n    that this article might ultimately become one of considerable\r\n    importance for purposes of export, a letter of thanks was addressed\r\n    to Mr. Feeny; and Nathaniel Day, the constable who assisted him, was\r\n    presented with the sum of £5, as a remuneration for his trouble in\r\n    assisting to purify and prepare the wax. On reference to the juror's\r\n    report on the Great Exhibition, it will be gratifying to find that\r\n    the berry wax, forwarded by this Society, had attracted peculiar\r\n    notice, and a prize medal been awarded for it; the following\r\n    reference is therein made to it: \"some fine specimens of myrtle or\r\n    berry wax, from the Cape of Good Hope, are exhibited by J.\r\n    Lindenberg, of Worcester. This is an excellent material for the\r\n    manufacture of candles, when employed in conjunction with other\r\n    solid fats. The jury awarded a prize medal for these specimens.\"\r\n\r\n    Your Committee would suggest every possible attention being drawn to\r\n    this subject, in which they are gratified to state, the\r\n    Commissioners of the Central Road Board have evinced a readiness to\r\n    co-operate, by offering to place at the Society's disposal the sum\r\n    of £10 10s., \"to be given as a premium for the best information\r\n    respecting the wax berry plant, the soils and situations in which it\r\n    is found to grow most luxuriantly: the best mode of propagating and\r\n    cultivating it, of collecting the berries, and extracting and\r\n    preparing the wax, &c.\" And from a letter received from the\r\n    Secretary to the Central Road Board, it appears that the Board had\r\n    authorised the shipment to England of 2,561 lbs. of the wax, by the\r\n    _Queen of the South_ in November last, which, from the account sales\r\n    lately received from Messrs. J.R.

Concrete milk and butter made from the Shea\r\nbutter tree, and others growing in Para, are also exhibited.\r\n\r\nWax candles have been made from the seeds of _Myrica macrocarpa_ in\r\nColombia, and also from vegetable wax in Java. Some of these are to be\r\nseen in the Museum of the Pharmaceutical Society of London.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTOR OIL PLANT.\r\n\r\nCastor oil is expressed from the seeds of _Ricinus communis (Palma\r\nChristi)_, a plant with petale-palmate leaves, which is found native\r\nin Greece, Africa, the South of Spain, and the East Indies, and is\r\ncultivated in the West Indies, as well as in North and South America.\r\nIn the temperate and northern parts of Europe, the plant is an\r\nherbaceous annual, of from three to eight feet high; in the more\r\nsouthern parts it becomes scrubby and even attains an height of twenty\r\nfeet; while in India it is often a tree thirty to forty feet high. The\r\nbest oil is obtained by expression from the seeds without heat, and is\r\nhence called \"cold drawn oil.\" A large quantity of oil may be produced\r\nby boiling the seeds, but it is less sweet and more apt to become\r\nrancid than that procured by expression.\r\n\r\nThe _Palma Christi_ grows continuously for about four years, and\r\nbecomes a large tree in constant bearing, ripening its rich clusters\r\nof beans in such profusion, that 100 bushels may be obtained annually\r\nfrom an acre, and their product of oil two gallons per bushel.\r\n\r\nThere are several species, all of which yield oil of an equally good\r\nquality. A shrubby variety is common in South Australia, and other\r\nparts of New Holland. _Ricinus lividus_ is a native of the Cape of\r\nGood Hope. It is a hardy plant, of the easiest culture, and will\r\nthrive in almost any soil, whether in the burning plains or the\r\ncoldest part of the mountains. The seed should be planted in the\r\ntropics in September, singly, and at the distance of 10 or twelve feet\r\napart. They will bear the first season, and continue to yield for\r\nyears. When the seed-pods become brown, they are in a fit state to\r\npluck. It is often grown in the East intermixed with other crops. The\r\nprimitive mode of obtaining the oil is to separate the seeds from the\r\nhusks, and bruise them by tying them up in a grass mat. In this state\r\nthey are put into a boiler amongst water, and boiled until all the oil\r\nis separated, which floats at the top, and the refuse sinks to the\r\nbottom; it is then skimmed off, and put away for use. The purest oil\r\nis obtained, as before-mentioned, by crushing the seeds (which are\r\nsewed up in horsehair bags), by the action of heavy iron beaters. The\r\noil, as it oozes out, is caught in troughs, and conveyed to receivers,\r\nwhence it is bottled for use.\r\n\r\nCastor oil is used for lamps in the East Indies, and the Chinese have\r\nsome mode of depriving it of its medicinal properties, so as to render\r\nit suitable for culinary purposes.\r\n\r\nThat which we import from the East Indies comes from Bombay and\r\nCalcutta, and is obtained at a very low price. It is exceedingly pure,\r\nboth in color and taste.\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies the shrub grows about six feet high. The stalks are\r\njointed, and the branches covered with leaves about eighteen inches in\r\ncircumference, forming eight or ten sharp-pointed divisions, of a\r\nbluish green color, spreading out in different directions. The flowers\r\ncontain yellow stamina; the seed is enclosed in a triangular husk, of\r\na dark brown color, and covered with a light fur, of the same color as\r\nthe husk. When the capsule is thoroughly ripened by the sun, it\r\nbursts, and expels the seeds, which are usually three in number.\r\n\r\nIn Jamaica this plant is of such speedy growth, that in one year it\r\narrives at maturity, and I have known it to attain to the height of\r\ntwenty feet. A gallon of the seed yields by expression about two\r\npounds of oil.\r\n\r\nThe wholesale price in Liverpool, in October, 1853, was 3d. to 5d. per\r\nlb.\r\n\r\nIt is brought over from the East Indies in small tin cases, soldered\r\ntogether and packed in boxes, weighing about 2 cwt. each.\r\n\r\nIn Ceylon castor oil is obtained from two varieties of the plant, the\r\nwhite and the red.\r\n\r\nThe native mode of preparing the oil is by roasting the seed; this\r\nimparts an acridity to the oil, which is objectionable. By attending\r\nto the following directions, the oil may be prepared in the purest and\r\nbest form. The modes of preparation are--1. By boiling in water. 2. By\r\nexpression. 3. Extraction by alcohol. In the first the seeds are\r\nslightly roasted to coagulate the albumen, cleaned of the integuments,\r\nbruised in a mortar, and the paste boiled in pure water. The oil which\r\nrises on the surface is removed, and treated with an additional\r\nquantity of fresh water; 10,000 parts of clean seed give by this\r\nprocess (in Jamaica) 3,250 of oil, of good quality, though\r\namber-colored. 2. Expression is the simplest and most usually adopted\r\nprocess; the cleaned kernels are well bruised, placed in cloth bags,\r\nand compressed in a powerful lever and screw press. A thick oil is\r\nobtained, which must be filtered through cloth and paper to separate\r\nthe mucilage. In Bengal the manufacturers boil the oil water, which\r\ncoagulates some albumen, and they subsequently filter through cloth,\r\ncharcoal, and paper. 3. The extraction by alcohol is practised by some\r\ndruggists. Each pound of paste is triturated with four pounds of\r\nalcohol, specific gravity 8.350, and the mixture subjected to\r\npressure. The oil dissolved by the alcohol escapes very freely: one\r\nhalf is recovered by the distillation of the spirit, the residue of\r\nthe distillation is boiled in a large quantity of water. The oil\r\nseparates and is removed, and gently heated to expel any adherent\r\nmoisture; then filtered at the temperature of 90 deg. Fahrenheit;\r\n1,000 parts of the paste have by this process given 625 of colorless\r\nand exceedingly sweet oil.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the _Palma christi_, and the manufacture of castor\r\noil, is extensively carried on in some parts of the United States, and\r\ncontinues on the increase. A single firm at St. Louis has worked up\r\n18,500 bushels of beans in four months, producing 17,750 gallons of\r\noil, and it is stated that 800 barrels have been sold, at 50 dollars\r\nper barrel. The oil may be prepared for burning, for machinery, soap,\r\n&c., and is also convertible into stearine. It is more soluble in\r\nalcohol than lard-oil.\r\n\r\nAmerican castor oil is imported for the most part from New York and\r\nNew Orleans, but some comes from our own possessions in North America.\r\nIn the United States, according to the \"American Dispensatory,\" the\r\ncleansed seeds are gently heated in a shallow iron reservoir, to\r\nrender the oil liquid for easy expression, and then compressed in a\r\npowerful screw press, by which a whitish oily liquid is obtained,\r\nwhich is boiled with water in clean iron boilers, and the impurities\r\nskimmed off as they rise to the surface. The water dissolves the\r\nmucilage and starch, and the heat coagulates the albumen, which forms\r\na whitish layer between the oil and water. The clear oil is now\r\nremoved, and boiled with a minute portion of water until aqueous\r\nvapors cease to arise: by this process an acrid volatile matter is got\r\nrid of. The oil is put into barrels, and in this way is sent into the\r\nmarket. American oil has the reputation of being adulterated with\r\nolive oil. Good seeds yield about 25 per cent. of oil. A large\r\nproportion of the drug consumed in the eastern section of the Union is\r\nderived by way of New Orleans from Illinois and the neighbouring\r\nStates, where it is so abundant that it is sometimes used for burning\r\nin lamps.\r\n\r\nIn Jamaica the bruised seeds are boiled with water in an iron pot, and\r\nthe liquid kept constantly stirred.

The quantity\r\nbrought down to that city from the interior was 1,394 barrels in 1848,\r\nand 1,337 barrels in 1849.\r\n\r\nWithin the last year or two, an attempt has been made to introduce the\r\ncake obtained in expressing the seeds of the castor oil plant as a\r\nmanure, which is deserving attention, both because it is in itself\r\nlikely to prove a serviceable addition to the list of fertilizers\r\nwhich may be advantageously employed, and because it may lead to the\r\nuse of similar substances, which are at present neglected, or thrown\r\naside as refuse.\r\n\r\nThe castor oil seed resembles in chemical composition the other oily\r\nseeds. It consists of a mixture of mucilaginous, albuminous, and oily\r\nmatters; and the former two of these are identical in constitution and\r\ngeneral properties with the substances found in linseed and rape cake,\r\nwhile the oil is principally distinguished by its purgative\r\nproperties. The cake obtained is in the form of ordinary oil-cake, but\r\nis at once distinguished from it by its color, and by the large\r\nfragments of the husk of the seeds which it contains. It is also much,\r\nsofter, and may be easily broken down with the hand. I have analysed\r\ntwo samples of castor cake, stated to have been obtained by different\r\nprocesses; and though I have not been informed of the exact nature of\r\nthese processes, I infer, from the large quantity of oil, that one\r\nmust have been cold-drawn. The first of the following analyses is that\r\nof the sample which I believe the cold-drawn. It is the most complete\r\nof the two, and contains a determination of the amount of oil. In the\r\nother analysis this was not done, but there was no doubt on my mind\r\nthat its quantity was much smaller.\r\n\r\n                            No. 1.

There is only one of its constituents which it contains\r\nin larger quantity, and that is the oil. No weight is, however, to be\r\nattached to the quantity of oil in a manure. In a substance to be used\r\nas food, it is of very high importance; but so far as we at present\r\nknow, its value as manure is extremely problematical. Whale, seal, and\r\nother coarse oils have been used as manures, and by some few observers\r\nbenefits have been derived from their application, but the general\r\nexperience has not been favorable to their use, nor should we\r\nchemically be induced to expect any beneficial effect from them. We\r\nhave every reason to believe that the oils which are found in plants\r\nare produced there as the results of certain processes which are\r\nproceeding within the plant, and there is no evidence to show that any\r\npart of it is ever absorbed in the state of oil by the roots when they\r\nare presented to them. On the other hand, the oils are extremely inert\r\nsubstances, and undergo chemical changes very slowly; so that there is\r\nno likelihood of their being converted into carbonic acid, or any\r\nother substance which may be useful to the plant; and as they contain\r\nno nitrogen, and consist only of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, they\r\ncan yield only those elements of which the plant can easily obtain an\r\nunlimited supply. I can conceive cases in which the oil might possibly\r\nproduce some mechanical effect on the soil, but none in which it could\r\nact as a manure, in the proper sense of the term.\r\n\r\nKANARI on.--Mr. Crawfurd, in his \"History of the Indian Archipelago,\"\r\nspeaks most favorably of an oil obtained from the \"Kanari,\" a tree\r\nwhich, he says, is a native of the same country as the sago palm, and\r\nis not found to the westward, though it has been introduced to Celebes\r\nand Java. I have not been able to distinguish its botanical name; but\r\nMr. Crawfurd describes it as a large handsome tree, and one of the\r\nmost useful productions of the Archipelago. It bears a nut of an\r\noblong shape, nearly the size of a walnut, the kernel of which is as\r\ndelicate as that of a filbert, and abounds with oil. The nuts are\r\neither smoked and dried for use, or the oil is expressed from them in\r\ntheir recent state. It is used for all culinary purposes, and is purer\r\nand more palatable than that of the coco-nut. The kernels, mixed up\r\nwith a little sago meal, are made into cakes and eaten as bread.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COCO-NUT PALM.\r\n\r\nThis palm (_Cocos nucifera_) is one of the most useful of the\r\nextensive family to which it belongs, supplying food, clothing,\r\nmaterials for houses, utensils of various kinds, rope and oil; and\r\nsome of its products, particularly the two last, form important\r\narticles of commerce. An old writer, in a curious discourse on palm\r\ntrees, read before the Royal Society, in 1688, says, \"The coco nut\r\npalm is alone sufficient to build, rig, and freight a ship with bread,\r\nwine, water, oil, vinegar, sugar, and other commodities. I have sailed\r\n(he adds) in vessels where the bottom and the whole cargo hath been\r\nfrom the munificence of this palm tree. I will take upon me to make\r\ngood what I have asserted.\" And then he proceeds to describe and\r\nenumerate each product. Another recent popular writer speaks in\r\neloquent terms of the estimation in which it is held, and the various\r\nuses to which it is applied.\r\n\r\n\"Its very aspect is imposing. Asserting its supremacy by an erect and\r\nlofty bearing, it may be said to compare with other trees, as man with\r\ninferior creatures. The blessings it confers are incalculable. Year\r\nafter year the islander reposes beneath its shade, both eating and\r\ndrinking of its fruit; he thatches his hut with its boughs, and weaves\r\nthem into baskets to carry his food; he cools himself with a fan\r\nplaited from the young leaflets, and shields his head from the sun by\r\na bonnet of the leaves; sometimes he clothes himself with the\r\ncloth-like substance which wraps round the base of the stalks, whose\r\nelastic rods, strung with filberts, are used as a taper. The larger\r\nnuts, thinned and polished, furnish him with a beautiful goblet; the\r\nsmaller ones with bowls for his pipes; the dry husks kindle his fires;\r\ntheir fibres are twisted into fishing-lines and cords for his canoes.\r\nHe heals his wounds with a balsam compounded from the juice of the\r\nnut; and with the oil extracted from its pulp embalms the bodies of\r\nthe dead. The noble trunk itself is far from being valueless. Sawn\r\ninto posts, it upholds the islander's dwelling; converted into\r\ncharcoal, it cooks his food; and, supported on blocks of stones, rails\r\nin his lands. He impels his canoe through the water with a paddle of\r\nthe wood, and goes to battle with clubs and spears of the same hard\r\nmaterial. In Pagan Tahiti, a coco-nut branch was the symbol of regal\r\nauthority. Laid upon the sacrifice in the temple, it made the offering\r\nsacred; and with it the priests chastised and put to flight the evil\r\nspirits which assailed them. The supreme majesty of Oro, the great god\r\nof their mythology, was declared in the coco-nut log from which his\r\nimage was rudely carved. Upon one of the Tonga Islands there stands a\r\nliving tree, revered itself as a deity. Even upon the Sandwich Islands\r\nthe coco palm retains all its ancient reputation; the people there\r\nhaving thought of adopting it as the national emblem.\"\r\n\r\nBesides the foregoing and following uses, I am aware of several scents\r\nand spirituous liquors being procured from the flowers and pulp of the\r\ncoco-nut.\r\n\r\nThis palm tree is one of the finest objects in nature. Its stem is\r\ntall and slender, without a branch; and at the top are seen from ten\r\nto two hundred coco-nuts, each as large as a man's head: over these\r\nare the graceful plumes, with their green gloss, and beautiful fronds\r\nof the nodding leaves. Nothing can exceed the graceful majesty of\r\nthese intertropical fruit trees, except the various useful purposes to\r\nwhich the tree, the leaf, and the nut are applied by the natives.\r\n\r\n1. The stem is used for--Bridges, posts, beams, rafters, paling,\r\nramparts, loop-holes, walking sticks, water butts, bags (the upper\r\ncuticle), sieves in use for arrowroot.\r\n\r\n2. The coco-nut is used for--milk, a delicious drink; meat from the\r\nscraped nut, for various kinds of food; jelly, _kora_, pulp, nut, oil,\r\nexcellent and various food for man, beast, and fowl.\r\n\r\nThe shell for vessels to drink out of, water pitchers, lamps, funnels,\r\nfuel, _panga_ (for a game).\r\n\r\nThe fibre for sinnet, various cordage, bed stuffing, thread for tying\r\ncombs, scrubbing-brushes, girdle (ornamental), whisk for flies,\r\nmedicines, various and useful.\r\n\r\n3. The leaf is used for--Thatch for houses, lining for houses,\r\n_takapau_ (mats), baskets (fancy and plain), fans, _palalafa_ (for\r\nsham fights), combs (very various), bedding (white fibre), _tafi_\r\n(brooms), _Kubatse_ (used in printing), _mama_ (candles), screen for\r\nbedroom, waiter's tray.\r\n\r\nHere are no less than forty-three uses of which we know something; and\r\nthe natives know of others to which they can apply this single\r\ninstance of the bounty of the God of nature. For house and clothes,\r\nfor food and medicine, the coco-nut palm is their sheet anchor, as\r\nwell as their ornament and amusement, who dwell in the torrid zone.\r\n\r\nThis fine palm, which always forms a prominent feature in tropical\r\nscenery, is a native of Southern Asia. It is spread by cultivation\r\nthrough almost all the intertropical regions of the Old and New\r\nWorlds; but it is cultivated nowhere so abundantly as in the Island of\r\nCeylon, and those of Sumatra, Java, &c. On the shores of the Red Sea\r\nit advances to Mokha, according to Niebuhr; but it does not succeed\r\nin Egypt. It is cultivated in the lower and southern portions of the\r\nAsiatic Continent, as on the coasts of Coromandel and Malabar, and\r\naround Calcutta. In the island of Ceylon, where the fruit of this tree\r\nforms one of the principal aliments of the natives, the nuts are\r\nproduced in such quantities that in one year about three millions were\r\nexported, besides the manufactured produce in oil, &c. According to\r\nMarshall it requires a mean temperature of 72 deg. Its northern limit,\r\ntherefore, is nearly the same as the southern limit of our cereals.\r\n\r\nRumphius enumerates thirteen varieties of this palm, but many of these\r\nhave now been placed under other genera, and Lindley resolves them\r\ninto three species--_C. nucifera_, the most generally diffused\r\nspecies, a native of the East Indies; and _C. flexuosa_ and _plumosa_,\r\nnatives of Brazil. The trunk, which is supported by numerous, small\r\nfibrous roots, rises gracefully, with a slight inclination, from forty\r\nto sixty feet in height; it is cylindrical, of middling size, marked\r\nfrom the root upwards with unequal circles or rings, and is crowned by\r\na graceful head of large leaves. The terminal bud of this palm, as\r\nwell as that of the cabbage palm (_Euterpe montana_), is used as a\r\nculinary vegetable. The wood of the tree is known by the name of\r\nporcupine wood. It is light and spongy, and, therefore, cannot be\r\nadvantageously employed in the construction of ships or solid\r\nedifices, though it is used in building huts; vessels made of it are\r\nfragile and of little duration. Its fruit, at different seasons, is in\r\nmuch request; when young, it is filled with a clear, somewhat sweet,\r\nand cooling fluid, which is equally refreshing to the native and the\r\ntraveller. When the nut becomes old, or attains its full maturity, the\r\nfluid disappears, and the hollow is filled by a sort of almond, which\r\nis the germinating organ. This pulp or kernel, when cut in pieces and\r\ndried in the sun, is called copperah, and is eaten by the Malays,\r\nCoolies, and other natives, and from it a valuable species of oil is\r\nexpressed, which is in great demand for a variety of purposes. The\r\nrefuse oil cake is called Poonae, and forms an excellent manure.\r\n\r\nA calcareous concretion is sometimes found in the centre of the nut,\r\nto which peculiar virtues have been attributed.\r\n\r\nAlong the Gulf of Cariaco there are many large coco walks. In moist\r\nand fertile ground it begins to bear abundantly the fourth year; but\r\nin dry soils it does not produce fruit until the tenth. Its duration\r\ndoes not generally exceed 80 or 100 years, at which period its mean\r\nheight is about 80 feet. Throughout this coast a coco tree supplies\r\nannually about 100 nuts, which yield eight flascos of oil. The flasco\r\nis sold for about 1s. 4d. A great quantity is made at Cumana, and\r\nHumboldt frequently witnessed the arrival there of canoes containing\r\n3,000 nuts.\r\n\r\nThroughout the South Sea Islands, coco-nut palms abound, and oil may\r\nbe obtained in various places. Some of the uninhabited islands are\r\ncovered with dense groves, and the ungathered nuts, which have fallen\r\nyear after year, lie upon the ground in incredible quantities. Two or\r\nthree men, provided with the necessary apparatus for pressing out the\r\noil, will, in the course of a week or two, obtain enough to load one\r\nof the large sea canoes. Coco nut oil is now manufactured in different\r\nparts of the South Seas, and forms no small part of the traffic\r\ncarried on with trading vessels. A considerable quantity is annually\r\nexported from the Society Islands to Sydney. They bottle it up in\r\nlarge bamboos, six or eight feet long, and these form part of the\r\ncirculating medium of Tahiti. The natives use the bruised fronds of\r\n_Polypodium crassifolium_ to perfume this oil. _Evodia triphylla_, a\r\nfavorite evergreen plant with the natives of the Polynesian Islands,\r\nis also used for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe most favorable situation for the growth of the coco palm is the\r\nground near the sea-coast, and if the roots reach the mud or salt\r\nwater, they thrive all the better for it. The coco-nut walks are the\r\nreal estates of India, as the vineyards and olive groves are of\r\nEurope. I have seen these palms growing well in inland situations,\r\nremote from the sea, but always on plains, never upon hills or very\r\nexposed situations, where they do not arrive to maturity, wanting\r\nshelter, and being shaken too violently by the wind. The stems being\r\ntall and slight, and the whole weight of leaves and fruit at the head,\r\nthey may not unaptly be compared to the mast of a ship with round top\r\nand topmast without shrouds to support it. Ashes and fish are good\r\nmanures for it.\r\n\r\nThe coco-nut is essentially a maritime plant, and is always one of the\r\nfirst to make its appearance on coral and other new islands in\r\ntropical seas, the nut being floated to them, and rather benefiting\r\nthan otherwise by its immersion in the salt water. Silex and soda are\r\nthe two principal salts which the coco-nut abstracts from the soil,\r\nand hence, where these do not exist in great abundance, the tree does\r\nnot thrive well. I do not know myself what is the practice in Ceylon,\r\nbut in Brazil, Dr. Gardner tells me, salt is very generally applied to\r\nthe coco-nut when planted. Far in the interior, he states, he has seen\r\nas much as half a bushel applied to a single tree, and that too when\r\nit cost about 2s. a pound, from the great distance it had to be\r\nbrought. That the application, therefore, of salt, of seaweed, and\r\nsaline mud, does more than supply soda, must be very evident, if we\r\nonly recollect how difficult it is to dry any part of our dress that\r\nhas been soaked in salt water, and what effect damp weather has on\r\ntable salt, which, in a balance, has often been made use of as an\r\nhydrometer. Moisture is always attracted by salt, and the more sea mud\r\nand other such little matters that coco-nut planters can apply round\r\nthe roots of their trees, there will most assuredly be the less\r\noccasion for watering them in the dry season. Sea weed contains but\r\nvery little fibrous matter, being chiefly composed of mucilage and\r\nwater; and the experiments of Sir J. Pringle and Mr. C. W. Johnson,\r\nprove that salt in small quantities assists the decomposition of both\r\nanimal and vegetable substances. Decomposed poonac, or oil-cake, is\r\none of the best manures that can be applied, as it returns to the soil\r\nthe component parts of which it has beau deprived to form the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe primary direction of the planter's industry will be to the\r\nestablishment of a nursery of young plants. In Ceylon, for this\r\npurpose, the nuts are placed in squares of 400, covered with one inch\r\nof sand, or salt mud; are watered daily till the young shoots appear,\r\nand are planted out after the rains in September. Sand and salt mud\r\nare to be found on almost all the coasts where it would be desirable\r\nto plant nuts, and if they are put into the ground at the commencement\r\nof the rainy season, artificial watering will scarcely be necessary.\r\nAny period, when there are showers, would answer for transplanting\r\nthem. I should say from the middle to the end of January would be\r\nbest, when they are placed in the nursery in October and November; and\r\nin October when they are planted in June.\r\n\r\nIt is said that they should be allowed from 20 to 30 feet space apart,\r\nbut I will calculate their return when planted 27 feet apart every\r\nway. This will give 58 coco-nut trees per acre. If manured, for the\r\nfirst two years, with seaweed and salt mud, and supplied with water in\r\ndry weather, there need be no loss, and the plants will thrive the\r\nbetter. The land must be kept clear of weeds till the plants are\r\nmatured, in order to permit them abundance of air and light. In five\r\nyears, when well cared for, the flower may be expected, but the plants\r\nwill not be in full bearing before the seventh or eighth year. From 50\r\nto 80 nuts are the annual crop of a tree; but I will calculate at the\r\nlowest rate. One hundred nuts will yield, when the oil is properly\r\nexpressed, at least two gallons and a half. I shall not take into\r\naccount the making of jaggery sugar and toddy, or spirit from the sap,\r\nas I do not consider that the manufacture would be remunerative; and\r\nit must be attended with much trouble, besides requiring a great deal\r\nof care and some skill.\r\n\r\nTake the case now of a plantation of 100 acres in extent. This would\r\ngive us 5,800 trees, which, at 50 nuts per tree, 290,000 nuts, at 2½\r\ngallons of oil per hundred, would yield 7,250 gallons of oil, the\r\nvalue of which any person may calculate, but which, at the low rate of\r\n3s. over charges, would furnish, as the gross plantation return in\r\noil, a sum of £1,087 10s. sterling. If the cultivator, instead of\r\nmaking his produce into oil, were to sell it in its natural state, his\r\ngross return in the West Indies would be nearly £600 sterling, at the\r\nrate of ten dollars per thousand.\r\n\r\nEither of these sums would be a handsome return from 100 acres of any\r\nland, _requiring no cultivation or care whatever, after the fourth\r\nyear, and yielding_ the same amount for upwards of half a century! But\r\nthis is not all. An outlay of a few pounds will secure other\r\nadvantages, and ought to enable the owner of a coco-nut plantation to\r\nturn his gross receipts for oil into nett profits. The coir made from\r\nthe husk of the nut is calculated to realise nearly one-fourth of the\r\nproceeds of the oil, but if we put it down at one-fifth, we shall\r\nhave, in addition to the value of the oil, £217 10s., thus making a\r\ntotal of £1,305 sterling. If we obtained 60 nuts from each tree, the\r\nreturn would be £1,566 sterling, and if 75, £1,957 8s. sterling; and\r\nthis from 100 acres of sea side sand! But even _this_ does not exhibit\r\nthe whole return of this article of culture. Each nut may be\r\ncalculated to give a quarter of a pound of poonac, or oil-cake, being\r\nthe refuse after expression, fit for feeding all kinds of stock, which\r\nmay be estimated as worth £10 per ton. We must, therefore, add on this\r\naccount to our first calculation, the sum of say £325; to the second,\r\n£390; and to the third, £485. This would give, in round numbers, the\r\nentire returns of the 100 acres planted:--At 50 nuts per tree, £1,630;\r\nat 60 ditto, £1,957; at 75, ditto, £2,446.\r\n\r\nThese are striking results, and may appear exaggerated; but I will, to\r\nshow how very moderate has been my calculation, give two returns, with\r\nwhich I have been favored from Ceylon. These, it will be seen, differ\r\nmaterially, but the latter I can rely on as a practical result, from a\r\nplantation in Jaffna, the peninsula of the northern portion of the\r\nisland. After estimating the expense of establishing the plantation,\r\nthe first writer sets down his return thus:--\r\n\r\n\"The produce, calculating 90 trees to an acre, and 75 nuts to a tree,\r\nsold at £2 per 1,000, would yield 675,000 nuts, worth £1,350; or if\r\nconverted into oil, calculating 30 to give one gallon, it would\r\nproduce 22,500 gallons, or about 90 tons from 100 acres.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Jaffna, the following is an abridged estimate of return of 100\r\nacres in full bearing:--\"At 27 feet apart, 58 trees per acre, 5,800\r\ntrees, at 60 nuts per tree, 3,480 nuts per acre, 100 acres, 348,000\r\nnuts, at 40 nuts per imperial gallon, 8,700 gallons of oil, at 2s. per\r\ngallon, netted £8 14s. per acre. The poonac left will pay the expense\r\nof making the oil. If shipped to England, at the present time (close\r\nof 1848), the selling price there being 55s. per cwt., measuring 12\r\nimperial gallons, say, 4s. 7d. per gallon, and the cost and charges of\r\nsending it home and selling it being 23s., it would leave 3s. per\r\ngallon, or £13 per acre.\" This sum is _nett proceeds_.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by the above, that I have been extremely moderate in\r\nmy computation of the return which may be anticipated, for there is no\r\ndoubt that planters can, in favorable localities, on the coasts of\r\nmost of our colonies, cultivate this palm with as much success as\r\nattends its culture in Ceylon. By the first of the calculations I have\r\ncited from, that island, the gross return appears thus:--\r\n\r\n  22,500 gallons at 4s. 7d                                   £5,156   5\r\n  Coir--one-fifth of value                                    1,031   4\r\n  Cake from 675,000 nuts, say ¼ lb. each, 75 tons at £10        750   0\r\n                                                             -----------\r\n  Total gross return from 100 acres                           6,937   9\r\n\r\nAccording to the other calculation, the return will stand thus:--\r\n\r\n  8,700 gallons at 4s. 7d                                    £1,993  15\r\n  Coir                                                          398  15\r\n  Cake from 348,000 nuts, 34 tons                               340   0\r\n                                                             ----------\r\n  Total gross return from 100 acres                           2,732  10\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that in my calculation I have set down the return\r\nlower than it is rendered in the less favorable statement from Ceylon\r\nby a sum of upwards of £1,000 sterling. But even supposing _one-half_\r\nof the amount of the lower Ceylon estimate could be realised, we\r\nshould have a return of £1,366 5s. sterling from 100 acres of sea side\r\nsand.\r\n\r\nI now proceed to point out the very small outlay required to obtain\r\nthese results. In places where the coco-nut would be grown, there is\r\ngenerally no heavy woodland requiring great labor with axe and fire,\r\nand consequently one able-bodied man should get through the felling\r\nand clearing away bush, on an acre of the land to be prepared for the\r\nplant, in a short period,--say, on an average, four days. I will\r\ncalculate, that for wages and rations, each hand employed will cost\r\nsixteen dollars per month, an outside price. Let us then say that ten\r\nlaborers shall be at work. They fell two acres and a half per diem. In\r\none month there should be nearly 70 acres felled; but I will say that\r\nthe 100 acres will occupy them two months in felling and stacking the\r\nwood. During this period our planter may be considered to have had the\r\naid of two more hands, engaged in the preparation, planting out, and\r\ncare of the nursery of young plants. Two more hands must also be\r\noccupied in the construction of tanks and sheds, except where there is\r\na stream of fresh water. For grubbing up the roots, if not very large\r\nsize, the assistance of about a dozen cattle would be required, a\r\nlabor which would be performed by means of the common grubbing\r\nmachine, an implement in the form of a claw. We will consider that all\r\nhands are occupied another month in this manner, and in removing and\r\nre-stacking the wood, and turning up the land. The planting out would\r\nrequire but little time and labor. At the end of three months then,\r\none-half of the hands, besides those engaged in the nursery and tanks,\r\nmight be discharged. We must make an allowance for provision for the\r\nfodder of the cattle. Six thousand nuts would be required.\r\n\r\nLet us now see what are the planter's expenses; making ample allowance\r\non account of each item:--\r\n\r\n                                                                 dollars.\r\n  6,000 picked nuts at 10 dollars per 1,000                          60\r\n  Hire and rations of 12 hands, at 16 dollars for 3 months          676\r\n  Two hands at nursery, for same period                              96\r\n  Purchase of 12 cattle at 20 dollars                               240\r\n  Foddering cattle one month                                         32\r\n  Hire of two extra hands, making tanks and sheds 3 months           96\r\n  Hire of 6 hands for 9 months                                      864\r\n  Tools (including plough)                                          100\r\n                                                                  -----\r\n                                                          Total   2,064\r\n\r\nAbout £415 sterling for expenses for the first year.\r\n\r\nWhere fencing is required, we must add for making about three miles of\r\nfence, say £30 sterling. Two carts would also have to be provided,\r\nwhich will cost, say £20 more. In all we may compute the first year's\r\nexpenditure at £460 sterling.\r\n\r\nSecond year's expenditure: ploughing land, or hoeing it twice,\r\nwatering plants, manuring, repairing fences, and supplying plants,\r\nsay hire of eight men for six months, about £150 sterling. The same\r\nfor the third.\r\n\r\nFourth year's expenditure: hire of six hands for three months,\r\ncleaning land, and manuring plants, about £60 sterling, and the like,\r\nat the cultivator's option, for the fifth year.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SUMMARY OF EXPENSES.\r\n                                   £\r\n  First year                      460\r\n  Second year                     150\r\n  Third year                      150\r\n  Fourth year                      60\r\n  Fifth year                       60\r\n                                  ---\r\n            Total expenditure     880\r\n            Add for buildings      80\r\n\r\nAnd we have a grand total of £960 sterling expended; for what purpose?\r\nTo secure a net income of _at least_ £1,200 sterling per annum for at\r\nleast 50 years!\r\n\r\nIn the first year's expenses many items might be cut down, but I leave\r\nthe calculation as one to be considered by a party with small capital,\r\nintending to establish a coco-nut plantation. I have allowed nothing\r\nfor the cost of land, as it is impossible to compute that. In general\r\nit would cost next to the nothing mentioned. I have, by careful\r\ncalculation, arrived at the conclusion that by combining the\r\ncultivation of provisions with the gradual but steadily progressive\r\nestablishment of a coco-nut plantation, any man of energy and\r\nperseverance may, with the aid of but four hands, clear, fence, and\r\nplant, in a favorable locality, 50 acres of coco-nuts within the year,\r\nyet have a balance in his pocket at its close. Such a person would,\r\nere doing anything beyond putting in his nursery plants, establish a\r\nprovision ground, of considerable extent, for the purpose of supplying\r\nhimself and his laborers with bread kind, and vegetables, and of\r\nenabling him, by the disposal of the surplus produce in the market, to\r\nraise a sufficient sum of money to furnish the wages and rations of\r\nthe men. I need not enter into a calculation to show how this could be\r\ndone, as every one must be aware of an easy method of following out so\r\nsimple a suggestion. Of course he would have to bear in mind that the\r\nprovision ground is of secondary importance, and limit his exertions\r\nin that line accordingly; devoting to the coco-nut plantation the\r\nstrictest daily attention.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of this tree deserves much more attention than has\r\nhitherto been paid to it, particularly in the East, where it not only\r\nforms part of the daily food of all classes of the community, but is\r\nan exportable article to neighbouring regions, the oil which it yields\r\nhaving of late years become in great demand in England, for the\r\nmanufacture of composite candles and soap, and there is no doubt of\r\nits continually extended application to such purposes. Supposing,\r\nnevertheless, the result of an increased cultivation of the coco-nut\r\nshould be such as to cause a fall in price, and sink the nett return\r\nin England to 2s. per gallon; this being clear profit, would make this\r\nkind of plantation a safe and sure investment for both capital and\r\nlabor in the Colonies.\r\n\r\nA kind of sugar made from the sap is called \"jaggery,\" and the sap\r\nwhen fermented forms an intoxicating beverage known as toddy. The\r\nfibrous outer covering, or husk of the nut, when macerated and\r\nprepared, is termed \"coir,\" and is spun into yarn and rope. It is\r\nextensively shipped from Ceylon, in coils of rope, bundles of yarn,\r\nand pieces of junk.\r\n\r\nThe coco-nut is usually planted as follows:--Selecting a suitable\r\nplace, you drop into the ground a fully ripe nut, and leave it. In a\r\nfew days a thin lance-like shoot forces itself through a minute hole\r\nin the shell, pierces the husk, and soon unfolds three pale green\r\nleaves in the air; while, originating in the same soft white sponge\r\nwhich now completely fills the nut, a pair of fibrous roots pushing\r\naway the stoppers which close two holes in an opposite direction,\r\npenetrate the shell, and strike vertically into the ground. A day or\r\ntwo more, and the shell and husk, which in the last and germinating\r\nstage of the nut are so hard that a knife will scarcely make any\r\nimpression, spontaneously burst by some force within; and, henceforth,\r\nthe hardy young plant thrives apace, and needing no culture, pruning,\r\nor attention of any sort, rapidly arrives at maturity. In four or five\r\nyears it bears; in twice as many more it begins to lift its head among\r\nthe groves, where, waxing strong, it flourishes for near a century.\r\nThus, as some voyager has said, the man who but drops one of these\r\nnuts into the ground, may be said to confer a greater and more certain\r\nbenefit upon himself and posterity, than many a life's toil in less\r\ngenial climes. The fruitfulness of the tree is remarkable. As long as\r\nit lives it bears, and without intermission. Two hundred nuts, besides\r\ninnumerable white blossoms of others, may be seen upon it at one time;\r\nand though a whole year is required to bring any one of them to the\r\ngerminating point, no two, perhaps, are at one time in precisely the\r\nsame stage of growth.\r\n\r\nCoco-nuts form a considerable article of export from many of the\r\nBritish colonies: 375,770 were exported from Honduras in 1844, and\r\n254,000 in 1845; 105,107 were shipped from Demerara, in 1845;\r\n3,500,000 from Ceylon in 1847.\r\n\r\nThey are very abundant on the Maldive Islands, Siam, and on several\r\nparts of the coast of Brazil. Humboldt states, that on the south\r\nshores of the Gulf of Cariaco, nothing is to be seen but plantations\r\nof coco-nut trees, some of them containing nine or ten thousand trees.\r\n\r\nCeylon is one of the localities where the greatest progress has been\r\nmade in this species of culture.\r\n\r\nIn 1832 several Europeans settled at Batticaloa, expressly for the\r\npurpose of cultivating this palm to a large extent. They planted\r\ncotton bushes between the young trees, which were found to ripen well,\r\nand nurse and shade them.\r\n\r\nThere are now an immense number of coco-nut topes, or walks, on the\r\ncoasts of the island, and about 20,000 acres of land are under\r\ncultivation with this tree.\r\n\r\nThe value of this product to Ceylon, may be estimated by the following\r\nreturn of its exports in 1847, besides the local consumption:--\r\n\r\n                                £\r\n  Declared value of nuts      5,485\r\n  Ditto of Coir              10,318\r\n  Kernels, or Copperah        6,503\r\n  Shells                        210\r\n  Oil                        19,142\r\n  Arrack                     11,657\r\n                            -------\r\n  Total                     £53,315\r\n\r\nThe annually increasing consumption of the nuts holds out a great\r\ninducement to the native proprietors to reclaim all their hitherto\r\nunproductive land. The fruit commands a high price in the island,\r\n(ranging from ¾d. to 3d. per nut), owing to the constant demand for it\r\nas an article of food, by both Singhalese and Malabars; there is not\r\nso much, therefore, now converted into copperah for oil making. In the\r\nmaritime provinces of the island, it has been estimated that the\r\nquantity of nuts used in each family, say of five persons, amounts to\r\n100 nuts per month, or 1,000 per annum. It needs only a reduction in\r\nthe cost of transit, to extend the consumption in the interior of the\r\nisland to an almost unlimited extent.\r\n\r\nIn 1842, Ceylon exported but 550 nuts, while in 1847 she shipped off\r\nto other quarters three millions and a half of nuts, valued at £5,500.\r\nThe average value of the nuts exported may be set down at £7,000.\r\n\r\nIn Cochin China the cultivation of the coco-nut tree is much attended\r\nto, and they export a large quantity of oil. At Malacca and Pinang it\r\nshares attention with the more profitable spices. Since the palm has\r\nbeen acclimatised in Bourbon, about 20,000 kilogrammes of oil have\r\nbeen produced annually. About 8,000 piculs of oil are exported\r\nannually from Java.\r\n\r\nA correspondent, under date December, 1849, has furnished me with the\r\nfollowing particulars of coco-nut planting in Jaffna, the northern\r\ndistrict of Ceylon, in which the culture has only recently been\r\ncarried on; the facts and figures are interesting:--\r\n\r\n    The Karandhai estate, the property of the late Mr. J. Byles, was\r\n    sold last month for £2,400, part of it bearing. It consisted of 303\r\n    acres, of which 228 are planted with coco nuts--about half the trees\r\n    six years old.\r\n\r\n    The Victoria estate, in extent 170 acres, planted and part in\r\n    bearing, and about seventy acres of jungle, was also sold for\r\n    £1,500. Mr. G. Dalrymple was the purchaser of the latter, and Mr.\r\n    Davidson of the former. Both lots were cheap. The properties are\r\n    among the best in the district, the latter, especially, is a\r\n    beautiful estate.\r\n\r\n    About two-thirds of the estates planted are looking well, and the\r\n    remainder but indifferently, in fact, ought never to have been\r\n    planted, and I believe will never give any return. About 7,000 acres\r\n    are now under cultivation here, and clearing is still going on.\r\n    Estates can now be put in for about one half what they cost\r\n    formerly, viz., about £4 or £5 per acre, and can be kept in order,\r\n    inclusive of all charges, for about 15s. to 20s. per acre for the\r\n    first two years, and about half that afterwards. Estates, in some\r\n    instances, have been put in for about £3 per acre.\r\n\r\n    Elephants have almost disappeared; now and then a stray one comes.\r\n    Figs are still a great nuisance, but the greatest anxiety among\r\n    planters is regarding beetles. You will be sorry to hear that the\r\n    first year the trees showed fruit or flower, one-tenth of them were\r\n    destroyed by the beetle; the insects still go on destroying, and\r\n    hardly a tree attacked ever recovers.\r\n\r\n    This is a very serious evil, and upon which the fortunes of all\r\n    those involved in coco-nut planting depend. The trees come into\r\n    bearing but very slowly, and I consider no estate will give any\r\n    return over its current expenses under twelve years. It takes twelve\r\n    months from the formation of the flower, till the fruit ripens. On\r\n    an estate, perhaps one of the oldest and best in this district, out\r\n    of 120 acres, part seven and eight years old, about 12 per cent, are\r\n    in flower or in bearing, and give a return of about twenty-four nuts\r\n    per tree, on an average, yearly. On the next oldest, the return is\r\n    not near so great. But few of the estates here will, I think, pay\r\n    interest on the money laid out, and many will never pay anything\r\n    over the expense of keeping them up, even after coming into bearing.\r\n    I doubt if any estate in this district, however economically\r\n    managed, will ever give a net return of more than £2, or perhaps of\r\n    £2 10s. per acre, at least without there is a great increase in the\r\n    consumption of oil in Europe. The consumption of this oil, in\r\n    Europe, is under 5,000 tons. If the beetles do not destroy half the\r\n    trees, the estates here when in bearing, if they yield anything,\r\n    will give half that quantity; and it must be borne in mind that\r\n    coco-nut oil is not a strong oil, like palm oil, and that soap\r\n    boilers will never use it to any extent, for it will allow but\r\n    little admixture of rosin, &c.; its use in Europe will be\r\n    principally for candles and fancy soaps; but as by refining and\r\n    compression they can now purify tallow, and make of it candles fully\r\n    equal to those made from coco-nut oil, the consumption of the latter\r\n    is not likely to increase. The consumption of candles is always\r\n    limited on the continent of Europe, liquid oil being preferred, and\r\n    in many instances gas is now being used where candles formerly were.\r\n\r\nThe return of land planted with coco-nut trees in Ceylon, in 1851, was\r\n22,500 acres; but this refers only to regular estates recently opened\r\nand cultivated chiefly by Europeans. Let us suppose that the natives\r\npossess besides, twenty millions of trees; Butollac in his time\r\nestimated the number at thirteen millions. At 100 trees to the acre,\r\ntwenty millions of trees give 100,000 acres, so that the total amount\r\nof land planted with coco-nut trees would be 122,500 acres.\r\n\r\nAn hydraulic press, for the manufacture of coco-nut oil, 1,200 horse\r\npower and weighing twenty-three tons, was cast at the Ceylon Iron\r\nWorks, in 1850, by Messrs. Nelson and Son.\r\n\r\nIn the island of Singapore there are now many extensive plantations in\r\na very flourishing condition, holding out favorable prospects to the\r\nproprietors. Hitherto the island has been supplied almost wholly from\r\nabroad with nuts and oil for its consumption, which will, before long,\r\nbe obtained exclusively from its own soil. In 1846 there were 10,000\r\ncoco-nut trees in bearing in Singapore.\r\n\r\nI have omitted to notice, in the foregoing observations, a very\r\nmistaken notion which prevails in many quarters, that it is best to\r\nlet the trees drop their fruit, and not to pick the nuts when ripe.\r\nNature directs differently. As soon as the husk of the nut is more\r\nbrown than green it should be picked. It then makes better oil and\r\nbetter coir, than when left to shrivel up and fall from the tree.\r\n\r\nColonel Low, in his \"Dissertation on Pinang,\" gives some interesting\r\ndetails and statistics on coco-nut planting:--\r\n\r\n    On a rough estimate--for an actual enumeration has not been lately\r\n    taken--the total number of _bearing trees_ in Pinang may be stated\r\n    at 50,000, and those in Province Wellesley at 20,000; but very large\r\n    accessions to these numbers have of late years been made. The tree\r\n    is partial to a sandy soil in the vicinity of the sea, and Province\r\n    Wellesley offers, therefore, greater facilities, perhaps, for its\r\n    cultivation than Pinang does, as its line of clear beach is longer,\r\n    and has many narrow slips of light or sandy land lying betwixt the\r\n    alluvial flats inland. There are several kinds of this tree known\r\n    here; one has a yellowish color, observable both on the branches and\r\n    unripe fruit; its branches do not droop much. A second has green\r\n    spreading branches, more drooping than the former, the fruit being\r\n    green colored until ripe; this is, perhaps, the most prolific; it\r\n    also bears the soonest, if we except the dwarf coco-nut, which\r\n    fruits at the second or third year, before the stem has got above\r\n    one foot high. This last kind was brought from Malacca; it attains\r\n    in time to the height of the common sort. Its fruit is small and\r\n    round, and of course less valuable than the other sorts. There is\r\n    also a coco-nut so saturated with green, that the oil expressed from\r\n    its kernel partakes of that color.\r\n\r\n    It is a mistaken supposition that the coco-nut tree will flourish\r\n    without care being taken of it. The idea has been induced by the\r\n    luxuriant state of trees in close proximity to houses and villages,\r\n    and in small cove's where its roots are washed by the sea. In such\r\n    circumstances, a tree, from being kept clear about the roots, from\r\n    being shaded, and from occasional stimuli, advances rapidly to\r\n    perfection; but in an extended plantation, a regular and not\r\n    inexpensive system of culture must be followed to ensure success.\r\n\r\n    The nuts being selected, when perfectly ripe, from middle-aged trees\r\n    of the best sorts, are to be laid on the ground under shades, and\r\n    after the roots and middle shoots, with two branches, have appeared,\r\n    the sooner they are planted the better. Out of 100 nuts, only\r\n    two-thirds, on an average, will be found to vegetate. The plants are\r\n    then to be set out at intervals of thirty or forty feet--the latter\r\n    if ground can be spared--and the depth will be regulated by the\r\n    nature of the soil, and the nut must not be covered with earth. The\r\n    plants require, in exposed situations, to be shaded for one and even\r\n    two years, and no lalang grass must be permitted to encroach on\r\n    their roots. A nursery must be always held in readiness to supply\r\n    the numerous vacancies which will occur from deaths and accidents.\r\n    The following may be considered the average cost of a plantation,\r\n    until it comes into bearing:--\r\n\r\n                      FIRST COST--100 ORLONGS OF LAND.\r\n                                                        Spanish dollars.\r\n  Purchase money of land, ready for planting                  1,000\r\n  7,000 nuts at 1½ dollars, per 100                             105\r\n  Houses of coolies, carts, buffaloes, &c., &c.                 100\r\n                                                              -----\r\n                            Spanish dollars                   1,205\r\n\r\n                       YEARLY COST OF SEVEN YEARS.\r\n\r\n  First year, 10 laborers at 3 dollars per month, including\r\n         carts,  &c.                                            360\r\n  Wear and tear of buildings, carts, and implements              50\r\n  Overseer, at 7 dollars per month                               84\r\n  Quit rent, average                                             50\r\n  Nursery and contingencies                                      50\r\n                                                              -----\r\n                            Total per annum                     594\r\n  Seven years at the rate will be                             4,158\r\n                                                              -----\r\n                            Total, Spanish dollars            4,752\r\n\r\n    To this sum interest will have to be added, making, perhaps, a sum\r\n    total of 6,000 Spanish dollars, and this estimate will make each\r\n    tree, up to its coming into bearing, cost one Spanish dollar at the\r\n    lowest. The young tree requires manure, such as putrid fish and\r\n    stimulating compounds, containing a portion of salt. On the\r\n    Coromandel coast, the natives put a handful of salt below each nut\r\n    on planting it.\r\n\r\n    The cultivators of Kiddah adopt a very slovenly expedient for\r\n    collecting the fruit. Instead of climbing the tree in the manner\r\n    practised by the natives on the Coromandel coast, by help of a hoop\r\n    passing round the tree and the body of the climber--and a ligature\r\n    so connecting the feet as will enable him to clasp the tree with\r\n    them--the Malays cut deep notches or steps in the trunk, in a\r\n    zig-zag manner, sufficient to support the toes or the side of the\r\n    foot, and thus ascend with the extra, aid only of their arms. This\r\n    mode is also a dangerous one, as a false step, when near the top of\r\n    a high tree, generally precipitates the climber to the ground. This\r\n    notching cannot prove otherwise than injurious to the tree. But the\r\n    besetting sin of the planter of coco-nuts, and other productive\r\n    trees, is that of crowding. Coco-nut trees, whose roots occupy, when\r\n    full grown, circles of forty to fifty feet in diameter, may often be\r\n    found planted within eight or ten feet of each other; and in the\r\n    native campongs all sorts of indigenous fruit trees are jumbled\r\n    together, with so little space to spread in, that they mostly assume\r\n    the aspect of forest trees, and yield but sparing crops.\r\n\r\n    The common kinds of the coco-nut, under very favorable\r\n    circumstances, begin to bear at six years of age; but little produce\r\n    can be expected until the middle or end of the seventh year. The\r\n    yearly produce, one tree with another, may be averaged at 80 nuts\r\n    the tree; where the plantation is a flourishing one--assuming the\r\n    number of trees, in one hundred orlongs, to be 5,000--the annual\r\n    produce will be 400,000 nuts, the minimum local market value of\r\n    which will be 4,000 Spanish dollars, and the maximum 8,000 dollars.\r\n    From either of these sums 6 per cent. must be deducted for the cost\r\n    of collecting, and carriage, &c. The quantity of oil which can be\r\n    manufactured from the above number of nuts will be, as nearly as\r\n    possible, 834 piculs of 133-1/3 lbs.\r\n\r\n  The average price of this quantity, at 7 dollars per picul       5,838\r\n  Deduct cost of manufacturing, averaged at one-fourth, and\r\n       collecting, watching, &c                                    2,059\r\n                                                                   -----\r\n                    Profit, Spanish dollars                        3,779\r\n\r\n    The Chinese, who are the principal manufacturers of the oil, readily\r\n    give a picul of it in exchange for 710 ripe nuts, being about 563\r\n    piculs of oil out of the total produce of the plantation of 100\r\n    orlongs. The price of coco-nut oil has been so high in the London\r\n    market as £35 per tun, or about an average of ten dollars per picul.\r\n    It is said that English casks have not been found tight enough for\r\n    the conveyance of this oil to Europe, but if the article is really\r\n    in great demand, a method will no doubt be discovered to obviate\r\n    this inconvenience.\r\n\r\n    So long, however, as the cultivator can obtain a dollar and a half,\r\n    or even one dollar for 100 nuts, he will not find it profitable to\r\n    make oil, unless its price greatly rises.\r\n\r\n    Soap is manufactured at Pondicherry from this oil, but it is not\r\n    seemingly in repute; the attempt has not been made in Pinang with a\r\n    view to a market.\r\n\r\n    There is scarcely any coir rope manufactured at this island, so that\r\n    the profit which might (were labor cheaper) arise from this\r\n    application of the coco-nut fibre, is lost. The shell makes good\r\n    charcoal; the leaves are scarcely put to any purpose, the nipah or\r\n    attap being a superior material for thatching.\r\n\r\n    The coco-nut tree is extremely apt to be struck by lightning, and in\r\n    such cases it is generally destroyed. It is a dangerous tree,\r\n    therefore, to have close to a house. If the trees are widely\r\n    planted, coffee may be cultivated under their shade. It is generally\r\n    believed that the extracting of toddy from this tree hastens its\r\n    decline. The Nicobar and Lancavi Islands used partly to supply the\r\n    Pinang market with this indispensable article; but their\r\n    depopulation has greatly reduced the quantity.\r\n\r\n    On the whole it may be said that there is no cultivation which\r\n    insures the return of produce with so much certainty as that of the\r\n    coco-nut tree; and as Rangoon, the Tenasserim coast, and Singapore\r\n    will, probably, always remain good markets for the raw nut, there\r\n    appears to be every chance of the value of the produce affording\r\n    ample remuneration to the planter.\r\n\r\n_Coco-nut beetle._--The chief natural enemy of this tree is a\r\ndestructive species of elephant-beetle (_Oryctes Rhinoceros_), which\r\nbegins by nibbling the leaves into the shape of a fan; it then\r\nperforates the central pithy fibre, so that the leaf snaps off; and\r\nlastly, it descends into the folds of the upper shoot, where it bores\r\nitself a nest, and if not speedily extracted or killed, will soon\r\ndestroy the tree. At Singapore, on account of the depredations of this\r\nbeetle, the difficulties have been considerable.\r\n\r\nIn Pinang and Province Wellesley it has only been observed within the\r\nlast two years, and it is believed to have come from Keddah. A similar\r\nkind of beetle is, however, found on the Coromandel coast. The natives\r\nof Keddah say that this insect appears at intervals of two, three, or\r\nmore years.\r\n\r\nIts larvæ, which are also very formidable insects or grubs, about\r\nthree inches long, with large reddish heads, are found in decaying\r\nvegetable matter. It is when the tree has made considerable progress,\r\nhowever, that the parent insect does most mischief. When they are from\r\none to two years old, throwing out their graceful branches in quick\r\nsuccession with the greatest vigor, and promising in three or four\r\nyears more to yield their ruddy fruit, this destructive enemy begins\r\nto exercise his boring propensities; and, making his horn act as an\r\nauger, he soon penetrates the soft and yielding fibre of the young\r\ntree, and if not discovered in time, destroys the leading shoot or\r\nbranch. The only remedy which has been adopted in Ceylon, is the\r\nfollowing:--Several intelligent boys are provided each with an iron\r\nneedle or probe, of about a foot long, with a sharp double barbed\r\npoint, like a fish-hook, and a ring handle; they go through the\r\nplantation looking narrowly about the trees, and when they perceive\r\nthe hole in the trunk, which indicates that the enemy is at work, they\r\nthrust in the barbed instrument and pull him out. Sometimes he may\r\nonly have just commenced, when his capture is more easily effected,\r\nbut even should he have penetrated to the very heart of the tree, the\r\ndeadly needle does not fail in its errand, but brings the culprit out,\r\nimpaled and writhing on its point. This is the only known way of\r\nchecking the ravages of this beetle, except destroying its larvæ. Some\r\ncultivators, however, think pouring salt water or brine on the top of\r\nthe tree, so as to descend among the folds of the upper shoots, a good\r\nplan to get rid of the larvæ.\r\n\r\nNearly two million coco-nuts are shipped annually from Bahia.\r\n\r\nFrom Ceylon, 114,600 coco-nuts were shipped in 1851, and 70,185 in\r\n1852.\r\n\r\nCoco-nut oil; 98,159 gallons were shipped from Ceylon in 1852; 359,233\r\ngallons in 1851.\r\n\r\nThe prices of Ceylon oil have ranged from £31 to £33 10s. per tun; of\r\nCochin oil, £34 to £35, within the last two years. The price per\r\nleaguer in Colombo, without casks, has been £8 10s. to £9.\r\n\r\n_Copperah_ is the name, given by the natives to the kernel of the ripe\r\nnut after it has been exposed to the sun on mats, until it has become\r\nrancid and dissolved. It has recently been shipped to England in this\r\nstate for the purpose of converting into oil. The exports of copperah\r\nfrom Ceylon were, in 1842, 115 cwts.; in 1843, 2,194; in 1844, 2,397;\r\nand in 1852, 39,174 cwts.\r\n\r\nThe returned value of the copperah or kernels exported from Ceylon, as\r\nentered in the Custom House books, is--\r\n\r\n  1840        2,508\r\n  1841        1,460\r\n  1842        3,022\r\n  1843        5,795\r\n  1844        6,194\r\n  1845        3,282\r\n  1846        5,517\r\n  1847        6,503\r\n  1848       12,639\r\n  1849        7,819\r\n  1850        4,166\r\n  1851        9,678\r\n  1852       13,325\r\n\r\n632 cwts. of poonac (being the refuse or cake, after expressing the\r\noil) were exported from Ceylon in 1842. It is worth there about £10\r\nthe ton.\r\n\r\nThe oil from the nut is obtained for culinary purposes by boiling the\r\nfresh pulp, and skimming it as it rises. That for exportation is\r\nusually obtained by pressing the copperah in a simple press turned by\r\nbullocks. Recently, however, steam power has been applied in Colombo,\r\nwith great advantage. About 2½ gallons of oil per 100 nuts, are\r\nusually obtained. It is requisite that care should be taken not to\r\napply too great and sudden a pressure at once, but by degrees an\r\nincreasing force, so as not to choke the conducting channels of the\r\noil in the press.\r\n\r\nIn many of the colonies the oil is expressed by the slow and laborious\r\nhand process of grating the pulp.\r\n\r\nThe quantity shipped from Ceylon was 2,250 tuns, in 1842; 3,985 in\r\n1843; 2,331 in 1844; 1,797 in 1845. The quantity in gallons shipped\r\nsince, was 101,553 in 1846; 197,850 in 1847; 300,146 in 1848; 867,326\r\nin 1849; 407,960 in 1850; 442,700 in 1851; and 749,028 in 1852.\r\n\r\nThe duty on importation is of and from British possessions, 7d. and\r\n7/8ths. per cwt.; if the produce of foreign possessions, 1s. 3¾ d, per\r\ncwt. In the close of 1852, the price of coco-nut oil in the London\r\nmarket was, for Ceylon, £32, £33, to £33 10s. per ton; Cochin,\r\nmiddling to fine, £34 to £35.\r\n\r\nThe following return shows the Custom House valuation of the oil\r\nshipped from Ceylon for a series of years, and which is of course much\r\nbelow its real value:--\r\n\r\n  1839      £26,597\r\n  1840       32,483\r\n  1841       24,052\r\n  1842       34,242\r\n  1843       43,874\r\n  1844       24,067\r\n  1845       15,945\r\n  1846        7,939\r\n  1847       19,142\r\n  1848       24,839\r\n  1849       34,831\r\n  1850       35,035\r\n  1851       31,444\r\n  1852       58,045\r\n\r\nAmong the coco-nut oil exported from Ceylon, in 1849, there were\r\n47,427½ gallons, valued at £3,595, the whole of which, I believe, was\r\nCochin oil; the raw material of this kind not being, like the copperah\r\ngenerally in Ceylon, subjected to the action of fire, the product is\r\nfiner, and fetches a better price in the London market.\r\n\r\nAmongst the imports from British possessions in Asia, were 2,600\r\ncwts., of copperah (dried coco-nut kernels, from which oil is\r\nexpressed), valued at £1,100; amongst the imports re-exported to Great\r\nBritain, we find 870 cwts. of the same article, valued at £300. Of the\r\noil exported a quantity of 11,000 gallons was shipped for the United\r\nStates. About 600,000 piculs of coco-nut oil are annually exported\r\nfrom Siam.\r\n\r\nA large quantity of oil is made in Trinidad, chiefly on the east\r\ncoast, where, in one locality, there is an uninterrupted belt of\r\ncoco-nut palms fourteen miles in extent. They usually bear when five\r\nyears old.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the coco-nut in a proper soil presents a very\r\nprofitable speculation for small capitalists. Whether sold at the rate\r\nof a dollar per hundred in their natural state, to captains of ships,\r\nwho freely purchase them, or manufactured into oil, they are a very\r\nremunerative product. Each tree in the West Indies is calculated to\r\nproduce nuts to the value of one dollar yearly. There is one thing to\r\nwhich we would draw the attention of chemists and other scientific\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nFor twenty-four or even forty-eight hours after its manufacture this\r\noil is as free from any unpleasant taste as olive oil, and can be used\r\nin lieu of it for all culinary purposes, but after that time it\r\nacquires such a rancid taste as to be wholly unpalateable. If any\r\nmeans could be discovered of preventing this deterioration in quality,\r\nand preserving it fresh and sweet, it could compete with olive oil,\r\nand the price and consumption would be largely raised.\r\n\r\n  COCO-NUT OIL IMPORTED INTO THE UNITED KINGDOM.\r\n\r\n                 Imports.

The cake or\r\nmarc of the pressing is excellent for fattening hogs and for manure.\r\n\r\nOats contain, as a maximum, about seven per cent. of oil, and Indian\r\ncorn nine per cent. The cake of the gold of pleasure contains twelve\r\nper cent. Indeed the most valuable oil-cakes are those of the\r\n_Camelina sativa_, poppies and walnuts, which are nearly equal; next\r\nto these are the cakes of hemp, cotton, and beech-mast. In France the\r\nextraction and purification of oil from the cotton seed is a recent\r\nbranch of labor, the refuse of which is likely to prove useful in\r\nagriculture; its value as a manure being nearly ten times greater than\r\nthat of common dung. Oil is obtained from maize or Indian corn in the\r\nprocess of making whiskey. It rises in the mash tubs and is found in\r\nthe scum at the surface, being separated either by the fermentation or\r\nthe action of heat. It is then skimmed off, and put away in a cask to\r\ndeposit its impurities; after which it is drawn off in a pure state,\r\nfit for immediate use. The oil is limpid, has a slight tinge of the\r\nyellow color of the corn, and is inoffensive to the taste and smell.\r\nIt is not a drying oil, and therefore cannot be used for paint, but\r\nburns freely in lamps and is useful for oiling machinery.\r\n\r\nAmong the various seeds used in the manufacture of oil-cake, flour of\r\nlinseed is the most important. Rape seed is also employed, but is\r\nconsidered heating. In Lubeck, a marc, called dodder cake, is made\r\nfrom the _Camelina sativa_. Inferior oil-cake is made from the poppy\r\nin India. Cotton-seed cake has lately been recommended on account of\r\nits cheapness, being usually thrown away as refuse by the cotton\r\nmanufacturers. It is extensively used as a cattle food, in an\r\nunprepared state, in various parts of the tropical world, and to a\r\nlimited extent in this country.\r\n\r\nThe cost of seed, freight included, was 2d. per lb. from Charlestown\r\nto Port Glasgow. Cotton oil-cake is now ordered at the same price as\r\nlinseed cake. The produce of oil-cake and oil from cotton seed, is two\r\ngallons of oil to one cwt. of seed, leaving about 96 lbs of cake; 8\r\nlbs. is the daily allowance for cattle in England.\r\n\r\nCotton seed oil, very pure, is manufactured to a considerable extent\r\nat Marseilles, by De Gimezney, from Egyptian seed; and he received a\r\nprize medal at the Great Exhibition.\r\n\r\nAccount of the export of linseed and rapeseed cakes from Stettin,\r\nprincipally to England, in--\r\n\r\n               cwts.\r\n  1834        33,518\r\n  1835        27,038\r\n  1836        56,581\r\n  1837        70,643\r\n  1838       119,540\r\n  1839       115,416\r\n  1840       162,457\r\n  1841       143,816\r\n  1842       119,814\r\n\r\nThe quantity of oil-seed cakes imported into the United Kingdom was\r\nin--\r\n\r\n              tons.\r\n  1849       59,462\r\n  1850       65,055\r\n  1851       55,076\r\n  1852       53,616\r\n\r\nCargoes of oil-cake, to the value of £22,207, were exported from the\r\nport of Shanghae, in China, in 1849.\r\n\r\n2,467 tons of oil-cake were brought down to New Orleans from the\r\ninterior in 1848, and 1,032 tons in 1849.\r\n\r\nSeven samples of American oil-cake gave the following results:--\r\n\r\n  Oil        11.41\r\n  Water       7.60\r\n  Nitrogen    4.74\r\n  Ash         6.35\r\n\r\nFrom the above figures, the scientific farmer will see that the manure\r\nformed by 100 lbs. of oil-cake is more than that derived from 300 lbs.\r\nof Indian corn. 300 lbs. of corn contain about l¼ lbs. phosphoric\r\nacid; 100 lbs. oil-cake contain about 2½ lbs.\r\n\r\nVOLATILE OR ESSENTIAL OILS occur in the stems, leaves, flowers and\r\nfruit of many odoriferous plants, and are procured by distillation\r\nalong with water. They are called \"essences,\" and contain the\r\nconcentrated odor of the plant. They usually exist ready-formed, but\r\noccasionally they are obtained by a kind of fermentation, as oil of\r\nbitter almonds and oil of mustard. Some of them consist of carbon and\r\nhydrogen only, as oil of turpentine, from _Juniperus communis;_ oil of\r\nsavin, from _Juniperus Sabina;_ oil of lemons and oranges, from the\r\nrind of the fruit; and oil of nerole, from orange flowers. A second\r\nset contain oxygen in addition, as oil of cinnamon, from _Cinnamonum\r\nverum;_ otto or attar of roses, from various species of rose,\r\nespecially _Rosa centifolia;_ oil of cloves, from _Caryophyllus\r\naromaticus_.\r\n\r\nThose principally obtained from tropical shrubs and plants are\r\ncitronella, oil of oranges and lemons, from the rind of the fruit oil\r\nof cinnamon and cloves, croton oil, &c.\r\n\r\nThe oil of Sandal or Sanders wood _(Santalum album_), grown on the\r\nMalabar coast, is much esteemed as a perfume. Keora oil, from\r\n_Pandanus odoratissimus_, in Bengal. Oil of spikenard, so highly\r\nprized, on account of its perfume, by the ancients, may be procured in\r\nSagur, Nepaul, and the mountains of the Himalaya.\r\n\r\n956 lbs. of essential oils were imported into Hull in 1850. There were\r\nexported from Ceylon in 1842, 902 cases; in 1843, 138; in 1844, 20; in\r\n1845, 25 cases of essential oils, and in the last two years as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n                     1852.     1851.\r\n                    cases.    cases.\r\n  Cinnamon oil        17        23\r\n  Citronella oil     110        87\r\n  Essential oil       72        35\r\n\r\nOf chemical, essential, and perfumed oils imported from France, the\r\nquantity is about 35,000 lbs. annually, worth £10,000. The duty is 1s.\r\nper lb. We also imported from France, in 1851, 9,596 cwt. of oil or\r\nspirit of turpentine, worth £14,197, on which a duty of 5s. 3d. per\r\ncwt. is levied.\r\n\r\nFrom Western Australia some distilled oil of the Liptospermum was\r\nshown at the Exhibition, which it is stated may be obtained in any\r\nquantity, and a similar oil produced, by distillation, from the\r\n_Eucalyptus piperita_, a powerful solvent of caoutchouc, evidently\r\nvery similar, if not altogether identical, with the oil of cajeput.\r\nThe characters of these two oils are much alike and without some care\r\nit is difficult to distinguish them from one another by the odor; the\r\nliptospermum oil has a slight tinge of yellow, its specific gravity is\r\n0.9035; the eucalyptus oil is colorless, and has a density of 0.9145.\r\nIt is probable that these oils might be used with great advantage in\r\nthe manufacture of varnish, they readily dissolve copal, and when its\r\nsolution is spread over any surface the oil soon evaporates, and\r\nleaves a hard, brilliant and uniform coating of the resin. These oils,\r\naccording to Prof. Solly, are specially worthy of attention.\r\n\r\nDr. Bennett, in his \"Wanderings in New South Wales,\" states that a\r\nlarge quantity of camphorated oil, which closely resembles the\r\ncajeputi, is produced from the foliage of several species of\r\n_Eucalyptus_. Some of the leaves, which are of a bluish green, contain\r\nit in such abundance as to cover the hand with oil when one of the\r\nleaves is gently rubbed against it.\r\n\r\nFrom the odorous leaves of the _Arbor alba_ is extracted a portion of\r\nthe aromatic cajeput oil. This celebrated medicinal oil is principally\r\nmade in the island of Borneo, one of the Moluccas.\r\n\r\nThe leaf of the _Melaleuca minor_ yields, by distillation, the\r\nvolatile oil of cajeputi, well known as a powerful sudorific, and a\r\nuseful external application in chronic rheumatism. It is an evergreen\r\nshrub, with white flowers like a myrtle, native of the East Indies,\r\nprincipally flourishing on the sea coasts of the Moluccas and other\r\nIndian islands. Two sacks full of the leaves yield scarcely three\r\ndrachms of the oil, which is limpid, pellucid, and of a green color.\r\n\r\nOil of cinnamon and oil of cassia, according to Mulder, have the same\r\ncomposition. When fresh they are pale yellow, but become brown on\r\nexposure to the air. On exposure they rapidly absorb cinnamic acid,\r\ntwo resins and water.\r\n\r\nMore than 22,000 lbs. of essence of bergamot was imported in 1848. It\r\nis obtained by distillation or pressure from the rind of the fragrant\r\ncitron.\r\n\r\n_Andropogon calamus aromaticus_, of Royle, _A. nardoides_, of Nees v.\r\nEsenb., according to some yields the grass oil of Namur.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of _Carum carui_, a hardy biennial British plant, popularly\r\nknown as caraway seeds, supply a volatile oil, which is carminitive\r\nand aromatic. Oils of a similar kind are obtained from _Coriandrum\r\nsativum_, from anise (_Pimpinella Anisum_), and cumin (_Cuminum\r\nCyminum_), a native of Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe production of cinnamon, clove, and cassia oils, have already been\r\nnoticed in speaking of those spices.\r\n\r\nIn Malabar, a greenish sweet-smelling oil is obtained, by\r\ndistillation, from the roots of _Unona Narum_, an evergreen climber,\r\nwhich is used medicinally as a Stimulant.\r\n\r\nOIL OF PEPPERMINT.--Mr. De Witt C. Van Slyck, of Alloway, Wayne\r\ncounty, New York, furnished me with the following particulars on the\r\ncultivation of peppermint, in December, 1849, which may appropriately\r\nbe introduced in this place:--\r\n\r\n    \"As an agricultural production, the culture of peppermint in the\r\n    United States is limited to few localities; this county and the\r\n    adjoining ones, Seneca and Ontario, comprise the largest bed. In the\r\n    year 1846 about 40,000 lbs. of oil were produced. In Lewis county,\r\n    in this state, it is grown, though to a less extent; the amount of\r\n    oil produced there in 1846 was estimated at 4,500 lbs. In Michigan\r\n    about 10,000 lbs. are annually produced; Ohio furnishes about 3,000\r\n    lbs. and Indiana 700 lbs. per annum. The entire crop in the United\r\n    States, in the year 1846, is estimated in round numbers at 58,000\r\n    lbs.\r\n\r\n    The above comprises all the localities of any importance in the\r\n    United States, and the above estimates of the annual product of oil\r\n    were made from correct data for the year 1846, since which time the\r\n    cultivation of mint has rapidly decreased in consequence of a\r\n    speculative movement by a New York company, who in the spring of\r\n    1847 purchased nearly all the mint then growing in this State, and\r\n    stipulated with the growers not to raise it for two years\r\n    thereafter, which condition was generally observed on the part of\r\n    the growers. The present year (1849), on account of the drought, has\r\n    not realised the expectations of those engaged in its culture,\r\n    although the amount of oil produced is much larger than the product\r\n    of the two preceding years. In this mint district, 8,000 lbs. have\r\n    been raised; Lewis county furnishes 1,000 lbs.; Michigan, 8.000\r\n    lbs.; Ohio, 1,000 lbs., and Indiana 500 lbs. So that the entire crop\r\n    of 1849 will not materially vary from 18,500 lbs.\r\n\r\n    I have consulted several of the principal dealers in mint oil, whose\r\n    opportunities have been ample to form a tolerably correct estimate\r\n    of the amount of oil annually consumed, and their opinion fixes the\r\n    total consumption, for the various purposes for which it is used in\r\n    the United States and in Europe, at from 20,000 to 30,000 lbs.\r\n    annually.\r\n\r\n    The price of mint oil is extremely fluctuating. Like other unstaple\r\n    commodities, the value of which depends upon their scarcity or\r\n    abundance, it never has assumed a constant and standing value, but\r\n    its price has generally been deranged by speculation and monopoly.\r\n    It has happened that the amount of oil produced was for several\r\n    years greater than the annual consumption, producing an accumulation\r\n    in the market, and reducing the price to the very low rate of 75\r\n    cents per pound; on the other hand, when the article was scarce, it\r\n    readily sold for 5 dollars 25 cents per pound. The average price for\r\n    fifteen vears has been about 2 dollars 50 cents, per pound. This\r\n    year (1849) it readily sells for 1 dollar 50 cents., (6s. 6d.).\r\n\r\n    Peppermint began to be cultivated in this vicinity as an\r\n    agricultural product about the year 1816, but for several years the\r\n    want of a proper knowledge of its culture, and the expense and\r\n    difficulty of extracting the oil, prevented its extension beyond a\r\n    few growers, who, however, realised fortunes out of the enterprise.\r\n    Almost any kind of soil that will successfully rear wheat and maize\r\n    is adapted to the growth of mint. Rich alluvions, however, seem to\r\n    be most natural, as would be inferred from the fact that the wild\r\n    herb is almost uniformly found growing upon the tertiary formations\r\n    on the margins of streams. The rich bottom lands along our rivers\r\n    and the boundless prairies of the West are eminently adapted for its\r\n    successful culture. It is believed by those best acquainted with the\r\n    subject, that its cultivation must be ultimately confined to the\r\n    western prairies, where it will grow spontaneously, and where the\r\n    absence of noxious weeds and grasses, incident to all older settled\r\n    lands, renders the expense of cultivation comparatively light, and\r\n    where the low price of land will be an important item in the amount\r\n    of capital employed, the expense of marketing being slight in\r\n    comparison to that of the more bulky products of agricultural\r\n    industry.\r\n\r\n    The method of cultivation is nearly uniform. The mode of propagation\r\n    is by transplanting the roots, which may be done in autumn or\r\n    spring, though generally the latter, and as the herb is perennial,\r\n    it does not require replanting till the fourth year. To ensure a\r\n    good crop and obviate the necessity of extra attendance the first\r\n    season, the ground intended for planting should be fallowed the\r\n    preceding summer, though this is not necessary if the land is\r\n    ordinarily clean. The ground should be prepared as for maize, as\r\n    soon as possible in the spring furrowed, and roots planted in drills\r\n    twenty inches apart, and covered with loose earth, two inches deep,\r\n    the planter walking upon the drill and treading it firmly. The\r\n    proper time to procure roots is when the herb is a year old, when\r\n    from six to eight square rods of ordinary mint will yield a\r\n    sufficient quantity of roots to plant an acre, and the crop from\r\n    which the roots are taken will not be deteriorated, but rather\r\n    benefited by their extraction. As soon as the herb makes its\r\n    appearance it requires a light dressing with a hoe, care being taken\r\n    not to disturb the young shoots, many of which have scarcely made\r\n    their appearance above the ground. In the course of a week or two\r\n    the crop requires a more thorough dressing, and at this stage of\r\n    growth the cultivator may be used with advantage, followed by the\r\n    hoe, carefully eradicating weeds and grass from the drills, and\r\n    giving the herb a light dressing of earth. Another dressing a week\r\n    or two later is all the crop requires.\r\n\r\n    The two following years no labor is bestowed upon the crop, though\r\n    it is sometimes benefited by ploughing over the whole surface, very\r\n    shallow, in the autumn of the second year, and harrowing lightly the\r\n    following spring, which frequently renews the vigor of the plant and\r\n    increases the product.\r\n\r\n    The mint should be cut as soon as it is in full bloom, and the lower\r\n    leaves become sere; the first crop will not be fit to cut as early\r\n    as the two succeeding ones. It is then to be hayed and put in cock,\r\n    and is then ready for distillation.\r\n\r\n    I have consulted many mint growers, who have cultivated it for a\r\n    series of years, in regard to the average yield per acre, and have\r\n    arrived at the following estimate, which I think is low, provided\r\n    the land is suitable, and is properly cultivated. I estimate the\r\n    average yield per acre for the first year at 18 lbs.; the second\r\n    year at 14 lbs.; and the third year at 8 lbs.--making the product\r\n    for three years 40 lbs., which I think will not materially vary from\r\n    the actual result, though growers aver they have raised from 30 to\r\n    40 lbs. per acre the first season.\r\n\r\n    Several years since, the only method of extracting the oil then\r\n    known was by distilling the herb in a copper kettle, or boiler, and\r\n    condensing in the usual manner; a slow and tedious process, by which\r\n    about 12 or 15 pounds of oil could be separated in a day. But\r\n    recently steam, that powerful agent, which has wrought such immense\r\n    changes in our social and national economy, has been applied to this\r\n    subject with its usual attendant success. The present method\r\n    consists in the use of a common steam-boiler, of the capacity of\r\n    from 100 to 150 gallons, from which the steam is conveyed by\r\n    conductors into large wooden air-tight tubs, of 200 gallons\r\n    capacity, containing the dried herb; from which it is conveyed,\r\n    charged with the volatile principle of the plant, into a water-vat,\r\n    containing the condenser. The water collected at the extremity of\r\n    the condenser, although it does not readily commingle with the oil,\r\n    is highly tinctured with it, and is used to feed the boiler. Two\r\n    tubs are necessary, in order that when the \"charge\" is being worked\r\n    off in one, the other can be refilled. The oil is then to be\r\n    filtered, and is ready for market. The expense of a distillery is\r\n    estimated at 150 dollars, which, with the labor of two men, and a\r\n    cord of dry wood, will run 40 lbs. of oil per day. The usual price\r\n    for distilling is 25 cents per pound.\r\n\r\n    The cost of production is of course greatly modified by\r\n    circumstances. If grown on rich bottom lands, or prairie, unusually\r\n    free from weeds and grass, the labor required will be comparatively\r\n    trifling. From information derived from the principal mint growers\r\n    in this vicinity, I have prepared the following estimate of the cost\r\n    of production of an acre of mint for three  years:--\r\n\r\n                           FIRST  YEAR.\r\n                                                        Dollars.\r\n  Rent of an acre of land one year                        8.00\r\n  One day plough and drag, one hand and team              2.00\r\n  Half day furrowing, digging roots, one hand and horse   1.00\r\n  Three days planting, at 75 cents                        2.25\r\n  Two days dressing with hoe, at 75 cents                 1.50\r\n  Two days with cultivator and hoe, 1.00                  2.00\r\n  Two days with cultivator and hoe (third dressing)       1.50\r\n  One and a-half days cutting new mint, at 75 cents       1.13\r\n  Curing and drawing to distillery                        1.50\r\n  Distilling 18 lbs. oil, at 25 cents                     4.50\r\n  Can for oil                                               25\r\n                                                         -----\r\n                                                         25.63\r\n\r\n                         SECOND YEAR.\r\n  Rent of an acre of land one year                        8.00\r\n  Cutting one acre of old mint                              75\r\n  Curing and hauling to distillery                        1.50\r\n  Distilling 14 lbs. oil, at 25 cents                     3.50\r\n  Can for oil                                               25\r\n                                                         -----\r\n                                                         14.00\r\n\r\n                          THIRD  YEAR.\r\n  Rent of an acre of land one year                        8.00\r\n  Cutting, curing, &c.                                    2.25\r\n  Distilling 8 lbs. of oil, at 25 cents, and can          2.25\r\n                                                         -----\r\n                                                         12.50\r\n                                                         -----\r\n  Total expenses for three years                         52.13\r\n\r\n  Forty pounds of oil, at dollars 1.37½ per pound        55.00\r\n  Deduct expenses                                        52.13\r\n                                                         -----\r\n           Net profit                                     2.87\r\n\r\n    In the above estimate I have omitted the expense of roots, for the\r\n    reason that the crop will yield as many as are required for\r\n    planting. The price of roots is about 50 cents per square rod, and\r\n    if they are in demand, the profit of the crop will be greatly\r\n    enhanced by selling them at that, or even a lower price.\r\n\r\n    It will be readily perceived that the culture of peppermint promises\r\n    no great return of profit in sections of country where land is\r\n    valuable, and where the expense of production is nearly double what\r\n    it is in newly-settled districts. It is a fact that in Michigan, and\r\n    other Western States, the actual expense of production is about\r\n    one-half less than the above estimate, and the yield is a fourth\r\n    greater; the greater distance from market, which is usually New York\r\n    city, not being taken into account, the freight on oil being\r\n    comparatively trifling. Another consideration in favor of prairie\r\n    cultivation is, that the mint will endure for years by simply\r\n    ploughing over the surface every second year, which seems to\r\n    invigorate the herb, and obviates the necessity of replanting every\r\n    second or third year, as must be done in older settled localities.\"\r\n\r\nIn India the perfumed oils are obtained in the following manner:--The\r\nlayers of the jasmine, or other flowers, four inches thick and two\r\ninches square, are laid on the ground and covered with layers of\r\nsesamum or any other oil yielding seed. These are laid about the same\r\nthickness as the flowers, over which a second layer of flowers like\r\nthe fruit is placed. The seed is wetted with water, and the whole mass\r\ncovered with a sheet, held down at the end and sides by weights, and\r\nallowed to remain for eighteen hours in this form. It is now fit for\r\nthe mill, unless the perfume is desired to be very strong, when the\r\nfaded flowers are removed and fresh ones put in their place. The seed\r\nthus impregnated is ground in the usual way in the mill and the oil\r\nexpressed, having the scent of the flower. At Ghazipoor the jasmine\r\nand bela are chiefly employed; the oil is kept in the dubbers, and\r\nsold for about 4s. a seer.\r\n\r\nThe newest oils afford the finest perfume. In Europe a fixed oil,\r\nusually that of the bean or morerja nut, is employed. Cotton is soaked\r\nin this, and laid over layers of flowers, the oil being squeezed out\r\nso soon as impregnated with perfume. Dr. Johnson thus describes the\r\nculture and manufacture:--\r\n\r\n    _Cultivation of Roses_.--Around the station of Ghazipoor, there are\r\n    about 300 biggahs (or about 150 acres) of ground laid out in small\r\n    detached fields as rose gardens, most carefully protected on all\r\n    sides by high mud walls and prickly pear fences, to keep out the\r\n    cattle. These lands, which belong to Zemindars, are planted with\r\n    rose trees, and are annually let out at so much per biggah for the\r\n    ground, and so much additional for the rose plants--generally five\r\n    rupees per biggah, and twenty-five rupees for the rose trees, of\r\n    which there are 1,000 in each biggah. The additional expense for\r\n    cultivation would be about eight rupees eight annas; so that for\r\n    thirty-eight rupees eight annas you have for the season one biggah\r\n    of 1,000 rose trees.\r\n\r\n    If the season is good, this biggah of 1,000 rose trees should yield\r\n    one lac of roses. Purchases for roses are always made at so much per\r\n    lac. The price of course varies according to the year, and will\r\n    average from 40 to 70 rupees.\r\n\r\n    _Manufacture of Rose-water_.--The rose trees come into flower at the\r\n    beginning of March, and continue so through April. Early in the\r\n    morning the flowers are plucked by numbers of men, women, and\r\n    children, and are conveyed in large bags to the several contracting\r\n    parties for distillation. The cultivators themselves very rarely\r\n    manufacture.\r\n\r\n    The native apparatus for distilling the rose-water is of the\r\n    simplest construction; it consists of a large copper or iron boiler\r\n    well tinned, capable of holding from eight to twelve gallons, having\r\n    a large body with a rather narrow neck, and a mouth about eight\r\n    inches in diameter; on the top of this is fixed an old dekchee, or\r\n    cooking vessel, with a hole in the centre to receive the tube or\r\n    worm.\r\n\r\n    This tube is composed of two pieces of bamboo, fastened at an acute\r\n    angle, and it is covered the whole length with a strong binding of\r\n    corded string, over which is a luting of earth to prevent the vapour\r\n    from escaping. The small end, about two feet long, is fixed into the\r\n    hole in the centre of the head, where it is well luted with flower\r\n    and water. The lower arm or end of the tube is carried down into a\r\n    long-necked vessel or receiver, called a bhulka. This is placed in a\r\n    handee of water, which, as it gets hot, is changed. The head of the\r\n    still is luted on to the body, and the long arm of the tube in the\r\n    bhulka is also well provided with a cushion of cloth, so as to keep\r\n    in all vapour. The boiler is let into an earthen furnace, and the\r\n    whole is ready for operation. There is such a variety of rose-water\r\n    manufactured in the bazar, and so much that bears the name, which is\r\n    nothing more than a mixture of sandal oil, that it is impossible to\r\n    lay down the plan which is adopted. The best rose-water, however, in\r\n    the bazar, may be computed as bearing the proportion of one thousand\r\n    roses to a seer of water; this, perhaps, may be considered as the\r\n    best procurable.\r\n\r\n    From one thousand roses most generally a seer and a half of\r\n    rose-water is distilled, and perhaps from this even the attar has\r\n    been removed. The boiler of the still will hold from eight to twelve\r\n    or sixteen thousand roses. On eight thousand roses from ten to\r\n    eleven seers of water will be placed, and eight seers of rose-water\r\n    will be distilled. This after distillation is placed in a carboy of\r\n    glass, and is exposed to the sun for several days to become pucka\r\n    (ripe); it is then stopped with cotton, and has a covering of moist\r\n    clay put over it; this becoming hard, effectually prevents the scent\r\n    from escaping. The price of this will be from twelve to sixteen\r\n    rupees. This is the best that can be procured.\r\n\r\n    _Attar of Roses_.--To procure the attar, the roses are put into the\r\n    still, and the water passes over gradually, as in the case of the\r\n    rose-water process; after the whole has come over, the rose-water is\r\n    placed in a large metal basin, which is covered with wetted muslin,\r\n    tied over to prevent insects or dust getting into it; this vessel is\r\n    let into the ground about two feet, which has been previously wetted\r\n    with water, and it is allowed to remain quiet during the whole\r\n    night. The attar is always made at the beginning of the season, when\r\n    the nights are cool; in the morning the little film of attar which\r\n    is formed upon the surface of the rose-water during the night is\r\n    removed by means of a feather, and it is then carefully placed in a\r\n    small phial; and, day after day, as the collection is made, it is\r\n    placed for a short period in the sun, and after a sufficient\r\n    quantity has been procured, it is poured off clear, and of the color\r\n    of amber, into small phials. Pure attar, when it has been removed\r\n    only three or four days, has a pale greenish hue; by keeping it\r\n    loses this, and in a few weeks' time it becomes of a pale yellow.\r\n    The first few days distillation does not produce such fine attar as\r\n    comes off afterwards, in consequence of the dust or little particles\r\n    of dirt in the still and the tube being mixed with it. This is\r\n    readily separated, from its sinking to the bottom of the attar,\r\n    which melts at a temperature of 84 degrees. From one lac of roses it\r\n    is generally calculated that 180 grains, or one tolah, of attar can\r\n    be procured; more than this can be obtained if the roses are\r\n    full-sized, and the nights cold to allow of the congelation. The\r\n    attar purchased in the bazar is generally adulterated, mixed with\r\n    sandal oil, or sweet oil; not even the richest native will give the\r\n    price at which the purest attar alone can be obtained, and the\r\n    purest attar that is made is sold only to Europeans. During the past\r\n    year it has been selling from 80 to 90 rupees the tolah; the year\r\n    before it might have been purchased for 50 rupees.\r\n\r\n    _General Remarks_.--Native stills are let out at so much per day or\r\n    week, and it frequently occurs that the residents prepare some\r\n    rose-water for their own use as a present to their friends, to\r\n    secure their being provided with that which is the best. The natives\r\n    never remove the calices of the rose-flowers, but place the whole\r\n    into the still as it comes from the garden.\r\n\r\n    The best plan appears to be to have these removed, as by this means\r\n    the rose-water may be preserved a longer time, and is not spoiled by\r\n    the acid smell occasionally met with in the native rose-water. It is\r\n    usual to calculate 100 bottles to one lac of roses. The rose-water\r\n    should always be twice distilled; over ten thousand roses water may\r\n    be put to allow of sixteen or twenty bottles coming out; the\r\n    following day these twenty bottles are placed over eight thousand\r\n    more roses, and about eighteen bottles of rose-water are distilled.\r\n    This may be considered the best to be met with. The attar is so much\r\n    lighter than the rose-water, that, previous to use, it is better to\r\n    expose the rose-water to the sun for a few days, to allow of its\r\n    being well mixed; and rose-water that has been kept six months is\r\n    always better than that which has recently been made.\r\n\r\n    At the commencement of the rose season, people from all parts come\r\n    to make their purchases, and very large quantities are prepared and\r\n    sold. There are about thirty-six places in the city of Ghazeepore\r\n    where rose-water is distilled. These people generally put a large\r\n    quantity of sandal oil into the receiver, the oil is afterwards\r\n    carefully removed and sold as sandal attar, and the water put into\r\n    carboys and disposed of as rose-water. At the time of sale a few\r\n    drops of sandal oil are placed on the neck of the carboy to give it\r\n    fresh scent, and to many of the natives it appears perfectly\r\n    immaterial whether the scent arises solely from the sandal oil or\r\n    from the roses. Large quantities of sandal oil are every year\r\n    brought up from the south and expended in this way.\r\n\r\n    6. The chief use the natives appear to make of the rose water, or\r\n    the sandal attar as they term it, is at the period of their\r\n    festivals and weddings. It is then distributed largely to the guests\r\n    as they arrive, and sprinkled with profusion in the apartments. A\r\n    large quantity of rose water is sold at Benares, and many of the\r\n    native Rajahs send over to Ghazipoor for its purchase. Most of the\r\n    rose water, as soon as distilled, is taken away, and after six\r\n    months from the termination of the manufacture there are not more\r\n    than four or five places where it is to be met with.\r\n\r\n    I should consider that the value of the roses sold for the\r\n    manufacture of rose water may be estimated at 15,000 to 20,000\r\n    rupees a year; and from the usual price asked for the rose water,\r\n    and for which it is sold, I should consider there is a profit of\r\n    40,000 rupees. The natives are very fond of using the rose water as\r\n    medicine, or as a vehicle for other mixtures, and they consume a\r\n    good deal of the petals for the conserve of roses, or goolcond as\r\n    they call it.\r\n\r\n    The roses of Ghazipoor, on the river Ganges, are cultivated in\r\n    enormous fields of hundreds of acres. The delightful odor from these\r\n    fields can be scented at seven miles distance on the river. The\r\n    valuable article of commerce known as attar of roses is made here in\r\n    the following manner:--On 40 pounds of roses are poured 60 pounds of\r\n    water, and they are then distilled over a slow fire, and 30 pounds\r\n    of rose water obtained. This rose water is then poured over 40\r\n    pounds of fresh roses, and from that is distilled at most 20 pounds\r\n    of rose water; this is then exposed to the cold night air, and in\r\n    the morning a small quantity of oil is found on the surface. From 80\r\n    pounds of roses, about 200,000, at the utmost an ounce and a-half of\r\n    oil is obtained; and even at Ghazipoor it costs 40 rupees (4_l._) an\r\n    ounce.\r\n\r\n    Five guineas have been often paid for one ounce of attar of roses.\r\n    The most approved mode of ascertaining its quality is to drop it on\r\n    a piece of paper; its strength is ascertained by the quickness with\r\n    which it evaporates, and its worth by its leaving no stains on the\r\n    paper. The best otto is manufactured at Constantinople.\r\n\r\nA volatile oil, erroneously called oil of spikenard, is met with in\r\nthe shops, which is obtained from a plant which has been named by Dr.\r\nRoyle, the _Andropogon Calamus aromaticus._\r\n\r\nThe true spikenard of the ancients is supposed to have been obtained\r\nfrom the _Nardostachys Jatamansi_, a plant of the Valerian family. Dr.\r\nStenhouse describes rather minutely (\"Journal Pharm. Soc.\" vol. iv. p.\r\n276) a species of East India grass oil, said to be the produce of\r\n_Andropogon Ivaracusa_, which he believes to be what is usually called\r\nthe oil of Namur. It has a very fragrant aromatic odor, slightly\r\nresembling that of otto of roses, but not nearly so rich. Its taste is\r\nsharp and agreeable, approaching that of oil of lemons. It has a deep\r\nyellow color, and contains a good deal of resinous matter.\r\n\r\nLEMON GRASS (_Andropogon schoenanthus_).--This fragrant grass, which is\r\nnow cultivated very generally throughout the West Indies, in the\r\ngardens of the planters, as an elegant and powerful diaphoratic, was\r\ndoubtless introduced from the East. The active principle of the leaves\r\nseems to reside in the essential oil which they contain. Lemon grass\r\noil forms an important article of export from Ceylon, amounting in\r\nvalue to nearly £7,000 annually.\r\n\r\nThe _Andropogon schoenanthus_, which may be seen covering all the\r\nKandian hills, is the best possible pasture for cattle--at least as\r\nlong as it is young. This species of grass is very hard, and grows to\r\nthe height of seven feet, and sometimes higher, and has a strong but\r\nextremely pleasant acid taste. It derives its name from having, when\r\ncrushed, an odor like that of the lemon, so strong, that after a time\r\nit becomes quite heavy and sickening, although grateful and refreshing\r\nat first. It covers the hills in patches--those, at least, that are\r\nnot overgrown with jungle and underwood--and it is to be found nowhere\r\nbut in the Kandian district. Spontaneous ignition frequently takes\r\nplace, and the appearance of the burning grass is described as most\r\nmagnificent. A few days after, from the midst of this parched,\r\nblackened, and apparently dead ground, lovely young green shoots begin\r\nto arise--for the roots of this extraordinary grass have not even\r\nbeen injured, far less destroyed, by the fire; and in a very short\r\ntime the whole brow of the mountain is again overspread with tufts of\r\nbeautiful green waving grass.--(\"Journal of Agriculture.\")\r\n\r\nOtto of khuskhus or scented grass, from another species, _A.\r\ndigitalis_, obtained at Ulwar in the States of Rajpootanah, was shown\r\nat the Great Exhibition in 1851, and Newar oil (from _A. maritima_)\r\nfrom Agra.\r\n\r\nCITRONELLA OIL.--In the Southern province of Ceylon some half dozen\r\nestates about Galle are cultivated with citronella grass. The exports\r\nof this oil from Ceylon in the last three years have been as\r\nfollows:--1850, 86,048 oz., valued at £3,344; 1851, 114,959 oz.,\r\nvalued at £3,742; in 1852, 131,780 oz., valued at £2,806.\r\n\r\nPATCHOULY.--Under this name are imported into this country the dried\r\nfoliaceous tops of a strongly odoriferous labiate plant, growing three\r\nfeet high in India and China, called in Bengalee and Hindu, _pucha\r\npat_. About 46 cases, of from 50 to 110 lbs. each, were imported from\r\nChina, by the way of New York, in 1844. The price asked was 6s. per\r\npound. Very little is known of the plant yielding it. Mr. George\r\nPorter, late of the island of Pinang, stated that it grows wild there\r\nand on the opposite shores of the Malay peninsula. Dr. Wallich says,\r\nthat it obviously belongs to the family Labiatæ. Viney, in the \"French\r\nJournal of Pharmacy,\" suggests that it is the _Plectranthus\r\ngraveolens_ of R. Brown. It forms a shrub of two or three feet in\r\nheight. It is the _Pogostemon patchouly_. The odor of the dried plant\r\nis strong and peculiar, and to some persons not agreeable. The dried\r\ntops imported into England are a foot or more in length. In India it\r\nis used as an ingredient in tobacco for smoking, and for scenting the\r\nhair of women. In Europe it is principally used for perfumery\r\npurposes, it being a favorite with the French, who import it largely\r\nfrom Bourbon. The Arabs use and export it more than any other nation.\r\nTheir annual pilgrimship takes up an immense quantity of the leaf.\r\nThey use it principally for stuffing mattrasses and pillows, and\r\nassert that it is very efficacious in preventing contagion and\r\nprolonging life. It requires no sort of preparation, being simply\r\ngathered and dried in the sun; too much drying, however, is hurtful,\r\ninasmuch as it renders the leaf liable to crumble to dust in packing\r\nand stowing on board. The characteristic smell of Chinese or Indian\r\nink is owing to an admixture of this plant in its manufacture. M. de\r\nHugel found the plant growing wild near Canton. By distillation it\r\nyields a volatile oil, on which the odor and remarkable properties\r\ndepend. This oil is in common use in India for imparting the peculiar\r\nfragrance of the leaf to clothes among the superior classes of\r\nnatives. The origin of its use is this:--A few years ago, real Indian\r\nshawls bore an extravagant price, and purchasers could always\r\ndistinguish them by their odor; in fact, they were perfumed with\r\nPatchouly; the French manufacturers at length discovered this secret,\r\nand used to import the plant to perfume articles of their make, and\r\nthus palm off homespun shawls as real India! Some people put the dry\r\nleaves in a muslin bag, and thus use it as we do lavender, scenting\r\ndrawers in which linen is kept; this is the best way to use it, as\r\nthis odor, like musk, is most agreeable when very\r\ndilute.--(\"Gardeners' Chronicle.\")\r\n\r\nThe root of some parasitical plant, under the name of kritz, is used\r\nin Cashmere to wash the celebrated shawls, soap is used only for white\r\nshawls.\r\n\r\nFrom the flowers of the Bengal quince (_Ægle marmemolos_) a fragant\r\nliquid is distilled in Ceylon known as marmala water, which is much\r\nused as a perfume for sprinkling by the natives.\r\n\r\nJasmine oil is distilled from _Jasminum sambac_ and _grandiflora_.\r\n\r\nSAPONACEOUS PLANTS.--Many plants furnish abroad useful substitutes for\r\ncommon soap. The aril which surrounds the seed and the roots of\r\n_Sapindus Saponaria_, an evergreen tree, I have seen used as soap in\r\nSouth America and the West Indies under the name of soap berries. The\r\nseed vessels are very acrid, they lather freely in water and will\r\ncleanse more linen than thirty times their weight of soap, but in time\r\nthey corrode or burn the linen. Humboldt says that proceeding along\r\nthe river Carenicuar, in the Gulf of Cariaco, he saw the Indian women\r\nwashing their linen with the fruit of this tree, there called the\r\nparapara. Some other species of _Sapindus_ and of _Gypsophila_ have\r\nsimilar properties. The bruised leaves and roots of _Saponaria\r\nofficinalis_, a British species, form a lather which much resembles\r\nthat of soap, and is similarly efficacious in removing grease spots.\r\nThe bark of many species of Quillaia, as _Q. saponaria_, when beaten\r\nbetween stones, makes a lather which can be used as a substitute for\r\nsoap, in washing woollens and silk clothes, and to clean colors in\r\ndyeing, in Chili and Brazil, but it turns linen yellow. The fruit of\r\n_Bromelia Pinguin_ is equally useful. A vegetable soap was prepared\r\nsome years ago in Jamaica from the leaves of the American aloe (_Agave\r\nAmericana_) which was found as detergent as Castile soap for washing\r\nlinen, and had the superior quality of mixing and forming a lather\r\nwith salt water as well as fresh. Dr. Robinson, the naturalist, thus\r\ndescribes the process he adopted in 1767, and for which he was awarded\r\na grant by the House of Assembly:--\"The lower leaves of the Curaca or\r\nCoratoe (_Agave karatu_) were passed between heavy rollers to express\r\nthe juice, which, after being strained through a hair cloth, was\r\nmerely inspissated by the action of the sun, or a slow fire, and cast\r\ninto balls or casks. The only precaution necessary was to allow no\r\nmixture of any unctuous materials, which destroyed the efficacy of the\r\nsoap. A vegetable soap, which has been found excellent for washing\r\nsilk, &c, may be thus obtained. To one part of the skin of the Ackee\r\nadd one and a half part of the _Agave karatu_, macerated in one part\r\nof boiling water for twenty-four hours, and with the extract from this\r\ndecoction mix four per cent. of rosin. In Brazil, soap is made from\r\nthe ashes of the bassura or broom plant (_Sidu lanceolata_) which\r\nabounds with alkali. There are also some soap barks and pods of\r\nnative plants used in China. Several other plants have been employed\r\nin different countries as a substitute for soap. The bark of _Quillaia\r\nsaponaria_ renders water frothy and is used as a detergent by wool\r\ndyers. _Saponaria vaccana_ is common in India. The pericarp of\r\n_Sapindus emarginatus_ mixed with water froths like soap. Saponaceous\r\nberries are found in Java.\r\n\r\nThe soap-worts to which the genus Sapindus belongs are tropical\r\nplants. The fruit of many species of _Sapindus_ is used as a\r\nsubstitute for soap, as _Sapindus acuminata_, _Laurifolius\r\nemarginatus_ and _detergens_, all East Indian plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VI.\r\n\r\nPLANTS YIELDING DRUGS, INCLUDING NARCOTICS AND OTHER COMMON MEDICINAL\r\nSUBSTANCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief plants furnishing the drugs of commerce, and which enter\r\nlargely into tropical agriculture, are the narcotic plants, especially\r\ntobacco, the poppy for opium, and the betel nut and leaf; as\r\nmasticatories--but there are very many others to which the attention\r\nof the cultivator may profitably be directed. I have already trenched\r\nso largely upon my space, that I cannot do that justice to the plants\r\ncoming under this section I could have wished. There are very many,\r\nhowever, of which I must make incidental mention. Some few medicinal\r\nplants have been already alluded to in former sections, particularly\r\nin that on dye-stuffs, &c.\r\n\r\nTHE COCA PLANT grows about four or five feet high, with pale bright\r\ngreen leaves, somewhat resembling in shape those of the orange tree.\r\nThe leaves are picked from the trees three or four times a year, and\r\ncarefully dried in the shade; they are then packed in small baskets.\r\nThe greatest quantity is grown about 30 leagues from Cicacica, among\r\nthe Yunnos on the frontiers of the Yunghos. Some is also cultivated\r\nnear to Huacaibamba.\r\n\r\nThe natives in several parts of Peru chew these leaves as Europeans do\r\ntobacco, particularly in the mining districts, when at work in the\r\nmines or travelling; and such is the sustenance that they derive from\r\nthem, that they frequently take no food for four or five days. I have\r\noften (observes Mr. Stevenson) been assured by them, that whilst they\r\nhave a good supply of coca they feel neither hunger, thirst, nor\r\nfatigue, and that without impairing their health they can remain eight\r\nto ten days and nights without sleep. The leaves are almost insipid,\r\nbut when a small quantity of lime is mixed with them, they have a very\r\nagreeable sweet taste. The natives generally carry with them a leather\r\npouch containing coca, and a small calabash holding lime or the ashes\r\nof the molle to mix with them.\r\n\r\n_Cocculus indicus_, or Indian berries.--This is the commercial name\r\nfor the berries or fruit of the _Menispermum Cocculus_ of Linnæus, _M.\r\nheteroclitum_ of Roxburgh, _Animerta paniculata_ of Colebrooke, _A.\r\nCocculus_ of Wright and Arnot, and _Cocculus suberosus_ of Decandolle.\r\nIt is a strong climbing shrub or tree, native of Malabar, Ceylon, and\r\nthe Eastern Islands. The seeds or drupes contain a bitter poisonous\r\nacid, and are used for the purpose of stupefying fish, and, in the\r\nform of a black extract, for fraudulently increasing the intoxicating\r\npower of malt liquors; one pound of the berries, it is said, will go\r\nas far in brewing as a sack of malt. The berry is kidney-shaped, with\r\na white kernel. Whilst the imports in 1846 were but 246 bags, in 1850\r\nthey had increased to 2,359 bags of about 1 cwt. each. The price is\r\n19s. to 24s. the cwt.\r\n\r\nA crystalline, poisonous, narcotic principle called picrotoxin, has\r\nbeen detected in these seeds, and occasionally employed externally in\r\nsome cutaneous diseases. _Cocculus crispus_ is used in intermittent\r\nfevers and liver complaints.\r\n\r\nThe annual imports now average 250 tons, and nearly the whole is\r\nconsumed for illegal purposes by brewers. Though the practice is\r\nnominally discountenanced by the Legislature under the penalty of £200\r\nupon the brewer and £500 upon the seller, yet under the recent tariff\r\ngreat encouragement is given to the introduction of these berries, the\r\nduty having been reduced from 7s. 6d. to 5s. the cwt.\r\n\r\nThe capsules and seeds of _Xanthoxylum hostile_ are also employed for\r\nthe same purpose as cocculus indicus. The bark of _Walseria piscidia_,\r\na native of the Circar mountains, also intoxicates fish.\r\n\r\nAbout 250 tons of _Nux vomica_, another species of dried flat seed\r\npossessing intoxicating properties, are also imported annually for the\r\nsame purposes, and they fetch about 6s. to 8s. the cwt.\r\n\r\nBETEL LEAF.--_Piper Betel_, a scandent species of the shrubby\r\nevergreen tribe of plants belonging to the pepper family, furnishes\r\nthe celebrated betel leaf of the Southern Asiatics, in which they\r\nenclose a few slices of the areca nut and a little shell lime; this\r\nthey chew to sweeten the breath, and to keep off the pangs of hunger,\r\nand it acts also as a narcotic.\r\n\r\nSuch is the immense consumption of this masticatory, termed Pan, in\r\nthe East, that it forms nearly as extensive an article of commerce as\r\nthat of tobacco in the West. The tax on the leaf forms a considerable\r\nportion of the local revenue of Pinang; in 1805, the tax yielded as\r\nmuch as 5,400 dollars.\r\n\r\nRumphius describes six species of this vine, besides several wild and\r\ncultivated varieties. It is very easily reared in the Indian islands,\r\nbut in the countries of the Deccan requires manuring, frequent\r\nwatering and great care, and in the northern parts of Hindostan it\r\nbecomes an exotic very difficult to rear. The vine affords leaves fit\r\nfor use in the second year, and continues to yield for more than\r\nthirty, the quantity diminishing as the plants grow older.\r\n\r\nARECA PALM (_Acacia Catechu_).--This is a fine, slender, graceful\r\ntree, rising from 20 to 30 feet high, which, being a native of the\r\nEast, is found abundant in many of the forests of India, from 16 to 30\r\ndegs. of latitude. The principal places of its growth are the Burmese\r\nterritories, a large province on the Malabar coast called the\r\n_Concan_, and the forests skirting the northern parts of Bengal, under\r\nthe hills which divide it from Nepaul, the south and west coasts of\r\nCeylon, the south of China, &c., the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and the\r\nEastern islands, it produces fruit at five years old, and continues\r\nbearing till about its twenty-fifth year, when it withers and dies. It\r\nthrives at a greater distance from the sea, and in more elevated\r\nregions than the coco-nut palm. In Prince of Wales Island some\r\nhundreds of thousands of these palms are cultivated.\r\n\r\nThe seeds or nuts form a chief ingredient in the celebrated eastern\r\nmasticatory called Pan and which seems to owe its stimulating\r\nproperties to the leaves of the _Piper Betel_. When prepared for use,\r\nthe nut is cut into slices and wrapped in the fresh leaves of the\r\nbetel pepper vine, together with a quantity of quicklime (_Chunam_) to\r\ngive it a flavor. The flavor is peculiar, between an herbaceous and an\r\naromatic taste.\r\n\r\nAll classes, male and female, chew it; they say it sweetens the\r\nbreath, strengthens the stomach, and preserves the teeth, to which it\r\ngives a reddish hue; there is probably less objection to its use than\r\ntobacco or opium, and its taste is more pleasant; but, if taken to\r\nexcess, it will produce stupor like other narcotics, and even\r\nintoxication. The nuts grow in large bunches at the top, and when ripe\r\nare red and have a beautiful appearance; they resemble the nutmeg in\r\nshape and color, but are larger and harder. When gathered they are\r\nlaid in heaps until the shell be somewhat rotted, and then dried in\r\nthe sun, after which the process of shelling commences. The trees vary\r\nin their yield from 300 to 1,000 nuts, averaging about 14 lbs.; which\r\nthe cultivators sell at about half a dollar (2s.) a picul of 133 lbs.\r\nAs these palms are planted usually at the distance of 7½ feet, it\r\nfollows that the produce of an acre is about 10,841 lbs. The tree\r\nbears but once in a year generally, but there are green nuts enough to\r\neat all the year long. Betel nut is a staple article of import into\r\nChina; 25,000 piculs annually is the amount returned, but there is an\r\nimmense quantity imported in Chinese junks from Hainan, of which there\r\nis no account kept. In the single port of Canton alone, 15,565 piculs\r\nwere imported in 1844, and about 400 to Ningpo. 3,005 piculs of betel\r\nnuts, valued at 8,700 dollars, were imported into Canton in 1850, and\r\nas much as 4,000 tons of areca nuts are shipped annually from Ceylon.\r\n\r\nThe astringent extract obtained from the seeds of the Areca-palm\r\nconstitutes two (or perhaps more) kinds of the catechu of the shops.\r\nAccording to Dr. Heyne (\"Tracts Hist. and Statist. on India\"), it is\r\nlargely procured in Mysore, about Sirah, in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n    The nuts are taken as they come from the tree and boiled for some\r\n    hours in an iron vessel. They are then taken out, and the remaining\r\n    water is inspissated by continual boiling. This process furnishes\r\n    Kassu, or most astringent terra japonica, which is black and mixed\r\n    with paddy criu, husks, and other impurities. After the nuts are\r\n    dried, they are put into a fresh quantity of water, boiled again;\r\n    and this water being inspissated, like the former, yields the best\r\n    or dearest kind of catechu, called Coony. It is yellowish brown, has\r\n    an earthy fracture, and is free from the admixture of foreign\r\n    bodies.\r\n\r\nMost of the betel nuts imported into China come from Java, Singapore,\r\nand Pinang. Betel nut is not so generally used in the South of China\r\nas among the Southern Islands, and in the north of China it is a\r\nluxury, as the pepper does not grow freely there. Formerly there was a\r\nconsiderable trade in betel nuts with the Coromandel coast, from\r\nwhence the natives brought back manufactured goods and other\r\nnecessaries in return, but this has ceased for some time. The common\r\nprice was 20,000 for a dollar. These nuts are seldom imported into\r\nEngland, though they might be of use as a dye in some manufactures.\r\n\r\nThe natives of the East chew the fruit of _Elate sylvestris_, (which\r\nis something like a wild plum), in the same manner as the areca nut,\r\nwith the leaf of the betel pepper and quick lime.\r\n\r\nThe inner wood furnishes a kind of _Catechu_ or _Cutch_, which\r\ncontains much tannin and is a powerful astringent. It is obtained by\r\nthe simple process of boiling the heart of the wood for a few hours,\r\nwhen it assumes the appearance and consistency of tar. It hardens by\r\ncooling, and when formed into small squares and dried in the sun is\r\nfit for the market.\r\n\r\nThe produce of Bombay is of uniform texture and of a dark red color.\r\nThat of Concan and other parts of India is of chocolate color, and\r\nmarked inside with red streaks.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of Sir H. Davy gave the following result:--\r\n\r\n                                    Bombay.

The plant has been long known, and is\r\nperhaps one of the earliest described. It is a native of Western Asia\r\nand probably also of the South of Europe, but it has been distributed\r\nover various countries.\r\n\r\nIn 1826 the imports of opium into the United Kingdom were 79,829 lbs.,\r\nof which 28,329 lbs. were consumed in this country. The imports and\r\nconsumption in subsequent years are shown by the following figures:--\r\n\r\n                Imports.

The\r\ntotal production of India exported to China, in 1844, was 21,526\r\nchests from Bengal, and 18,321 from Bombay, in all 39,847 chests. The\r\nnumber of persons in China given to the consumption of opium was\r\nestimated, in 1837, at three millions, and the average quantity smoked\r\nby each individual is about 17½ grains a day. The consumption of\r\nIndian opium (independent of Turkey opium) in China has gradually\r\nincreased from 3,210 chests in 1817, to 9,969 chests in 1827, and\r\nabout 40,000 chests in 1837, valued at 25,000,000 dollars. Now it has\r\nreached 50,000 to 60,000 chests. Notwithstanding severe penalties,\r\nimprisonment, temporary banishment, and even death, the number of\r\nthose who smoke opium has multiplied exceedingly, and the contraband\r\ntrade in the drug is carried on to so large an extent, that it is to\r\nbe feared the practice will become general throughout the empire.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. E. Thornton's statistics, the production of opium in\r\nBengal has increased cent. per cent. in the last ten years:--\r\n\r\n                    Chests.\r\n  1840-41           17,858\r\n  1841-42           18,827\r\n  1842-43           18,362\r\n  1843-44           15,104\r\n  1844-45           18,350\r\n  1845-46           21,437\r\n  1846-47           21,648\r\n  1847-48           30,515\r\n  1848-49           36,000\r\n\r\nThe chest is about 140 lbs., so that the production in 1849 was\r\n5,040,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nAccording to the statements annexed to the statistical papers relating\r\nto India, the income from the opium monopoly is obtained by two\r\nprincipal means, namely, by a system of allowing the cultivation of\r\nthe poppy by the natives of British India on account of Government,\r\nand by the impost of a heavy duty on opium grown and manufactured in\r\nforeign states, but brought in transit to a British port for\r\nexportation. The former system obtains in Bengal, the latter in\r\nBombay. According to the statements published, Bengal opium yields a\r\nprofit of 7s. 6d. per lb., whilst the duty derived in the Bombay\r\npresidency is only equal to a surplus of 5s. 8d. per lb. By these\r\nmeans the total revenue realised by the opium monopoly, in Bengal and\r\nBombay, in the year 1849-50 yielded £3,309,637.\r\n\r\nLest objection should be taken to this large annual revenue derived\r\nfrom the cultivation of a drug, the unnatural consumption of which\r\nwould be suppressed under any other European government, the Court of\r\nDirectors is very anxious to show the benefit which the country\r\nderives from this monopoly; they say \"that as the price of opium is\r\nalmost wholly paid by foreign consumers, and the largest return is\r\nobtained with the smallest outlay, the best interests of India would,\r\nappear to be consulted.\" Nobody at all acquainted with the financial\r\nresources and the capabilities of any country, would hazard such an\r\nassertion. By paying cultivators for the restricted growth of the\r\npoppy a price hardly yielding more than the average rate of wages to\r\nthe common laborer, I do not see in what way the best interests of\r\nIndia are consulted, nor is it clear that the population derives any\r\nbenefit by being prohibited altogether from manufacturing a drug,\r\nwhich may be brought from another country _in transitu_ on the payment\r\nof a heavy duty; unless indeed the Court of Directors are of opinion\r\nthat in the event of the abolition of the monopoly, the people of the\r\ncountry would have to make up for the loss of the revenue by\r\nsubmitting to some other mode of direct or indirect taxation. There is\r\nan inconsistency in the statements of the Court of Directors, which is\r\nabsolutely amusing. \"The free cultivation of the poppy,\" say the\r\nDirectors, \"would doubtless lead to the larger outlay of capital, and\r\nto greater economy in production; but the poppy requires the richest\r\ndescription of land, and its extended cultivation must therefore\r\ndisplace other products.\" How very considerate on the part of the\r\nDirectors, but how strongly at variance with facts, since all the fear\r\nof displacing other products, and all this appropriation of the\r\nrichest description of land for other purposes has not prevented the\r\nIndian Government, within less than ten years, from more than doubling\r\nthe cultivation of the poppy and the manufacture of opium. The\r\nDirectors tell us that the heavy transit duty charged at Bombay is to\r\ndiscourage production, but they do not say whether that discouragement\r\napplies, as one would imagine, to those foreign districts which have\r\nto pay the transit duty for their production. If so, the assertion is\r\nagain at variance with facts, because in a subsequent statement they\r\nsay, \"It is stated that neither the price of opium, nor the extent of\r\ncultivation in Malwa, has been affected by the great enhancement of\r\nthe pass duty, which has taken place since 1845.\"\r\n\r\nThe following will show that the Company loses no opportunity of\r\napplying the screw:--\r\n\r\n    The subjugation of Scinde afforded opportunity for the levy of a\r\n    higher rate. Down to the period of that event, a large portion of\r\n    the opium of Malwa had been conveyed through Scinde to Kurrachee,\r\n    and thence onward to the Portuguese ports of Diu and Demaun. That\r\n    route is now closed, and it was reasonably expected that an advance\r\n    might be made in the charge of passes without the risk of loss to\r\n    the revenue from a diminished demand for them. The rate was\r\n    accordingly increased in October, 1843, from 125 to 200 rupees per\r\n    chest. Upon the principle that it was desirable to fix the price at\r\n    the highest amount that could be levied, without forcing the trade\r\n    into other channels, a further increase was made in 1845. when it\r\n    was determined that the charge should be 300 rupees per chest. Under\r\n    the like views it was, in 1847, raised to 400 rupees per chest.\r\n\r\nThe company was perfectly correct, for though the quantity of opium\r\ndid not increase, the revenue did; and whilst in 1840-41 16,773 chests\r\nyielded an income of only 22,046,452 rupees--16,500 chests brought in\r\n1849-50 actually 72,094,835 rupees into the coffers of the Government\r\nof Bombay. But the people of India earned not a pice by it, and those\r\nrichest descriptions of land, which it was so desirable to reserve for\r\nother produce than the poppy, remained barren.\r\n\r\nThe white variety of the poppy is that which is exclusively brought\r\nunder cultivation for the production of the drug in India and Egypt.\r\nFor the successful culture of opium a mild climate, plentiful\r\nirrigation, a rich soil, and diligent husbandry are indispensable. One\r\nacre of well cultivated ground will yield from 70 lbs. to 100 lbs. of\r\n\"chick,\" or inspissated juice, the price of which varies from 6s. to\r\n12s. a pound, so that an acre will yield from £20 to £60 worth of\r\nopium at one crop. Three pounds of chick will produce one pound of\r\nopium, from a third to a fifth of the weight being lost in\r\nevaporation. A chief chemical feature, which distinguishes Bengal\r\nopium from that of Turkey and Egypt, is the large proportion which the\r\nnarcotine in the former bears to the morphia, and this proportion is\r\nconstant in all seasons. It is a matter of importance to ascertain\r\nwhether the treatment which the juice receives after its collection\r\ncan influence in any way the amount of alkaloids, or of the other\r\nprinciples in opium. In Turkey it is the custom to beat up the juice\r\nwith saliva, in Malwa it is immersed as collected in linseed oil,\r\nwhilst in Bengal it is brought to the required consistence by mere\r\nexposure to the air in the shade, though, at the same time, all the\r\nwatery particles of the juice that will separate are drained off, and\r\nused in making _Lewah_, or inferior opium.\r\n\r\nThe lands selected for poppy cultivation are generally situated in the\r\nvicinity of villages, where the facilities for manuring and irrigation\r\nare greatest. In such situations and when the soil is rich, it is\r\nfrequently the practice with the cultivators to take a crop of Indian\r\ncorn, maize, or vegetables off the ground during the rainy season, and\r\nafter the removal of this in September, to dress and manure the ground\r\nfor the subsequent poppy sowings. In other situations, however, and\r\nwhen the soil is not rich, the poppy crop is the only one taken off\r\nthe ground during the year, and from the commencement of the rains in\r\nJune or July, until October, the ground is dressed and cleaned by\r\nsuccessive ploughings and weedings, and manured to the extent which\r\nthe means of the cultivator will permit. In the final preparation of\r\nthe land in October and November, the soil, after being well loosened\r\nand turned up by the plough, is crushed and broken down by the passage\r\nof a heavy log of wood over its surface, and it is in this state ready\r\nfor sowing.\r\n\r\nThe amount of produce from various lands differs considerably. Under\r\nvery favorable circumstances of soil and season, as much as twelve or\r\neven thirteen seers (26 lbs.) of standard opium may be, obtained from\r\neach biggah of 27,225 square feet. \"Under less favorable conditions\r\nthe turn-out may not exceed three or four seers, but the usual amount\r\nof produce varies from six to eight seers per biggah.\r\n\r\nThe chemical examination of different soils in connection with their\r\nopium-producing powers, presents a field for profitable and\r\ninteresting inquiry; nor is the least important part of the\r\ninvestigation that which has reference to variations in the\r\nproportions of the alkaloids (especially the morphia and narcotine),\r\nwhich occur in opium produced in various localities. That atmospheric\r\ncauses exert a certain influence in determining these variations is\r\nprobable; that they influence the amount of produce, and cause\r\nalterations in the physical appearance of the drug, are facts well\r\nknown to every cultivator: thus the effect of dew is to facilitate the\r\nflow of the juice from the wounded capsule, rendering it abundant in\r\nquantity, but causing it at the same time to be dark and liquid. An\r\neasterly wind (which in India is usually concomitant with a damp state\r\nof atmosphere), retards the flow of juice, and renders it dark and\r\nliquid. A moderate westerly wind, with dew at night, form the\r\natmospheric conditions most favorable for collection, both as regards\r\nthe quantity and quality of the exudation. If, however, the westerly\r\nwind (which is an extremely dry wind) blow violently, the exudation\r\nfrom the capsules is sparing. Whilst the effect of meteorological\r\nphenomena in producing the above results are well marked, their action\r\nin altering the relative proportions of the chemical constituents of\r\nthe juice of the poppy plant is more obscure, and it is highly\r\nprobable that the chemical composition of the soil plays a most\r\nimportant part in this respect. Dr. O'Shaughnessy is certainly the\r\nmost accomplished chemist who had ever, in India, turned his attention\r\nto the subject, and he has published the results of his analyses of\r\nspecimens of opium from the different divisions of the Behar Agency,\r\nwhich are worthy of much attention. In the opium from eight divisions\r\nof the agency, he found the quantity of morphia to range from 1¾\r\ngrains to 3½ grains per cent., and the amount of the narcotine to vary\r\nfrom ¾ grain to 3½ grains per cent., the consistence of the various\r\nspecimens being between 75 and 79 per cent. In the opium from the\r\nHazareebaugh district (the consistence of the drug being 77), he found\r\n4½ per cent, of morphia, and 4 per cent, narcotine; whilst from a\r\nspecimen of Patna-garden opium he extracted no less than 10¾ per cent.\r\nof morphia, and 6 per cent. of narcotine, the consistence of the drug\r\nbeing 87. With respect to the last specimen, Dr. O'Shaughnessy\r\nmentions that the poppies which produced it were irrigated three times\r\nduring the season, and that no manure was employed upon the soil. It\r\nis much to be regretted that these interesting results were not\r\ncoupled with an analysis of the soils from which the specimens were\r\nproduced, for to chemical variations in it must be attributed the\r\nwidely different results recorded above.\r\n\r\nOpium as a medicine has been used from the earliest ages; but when it\r\nwas first resorted to as a luxury, it is impossible to state, though\r\nit is not at all improbable that this was coeval with its employment\r\nin medicine, for how often do we find that, from having been first\r\nadministered as a sedative for pain, it has been continued until it\r\nhas taken the place of the evil. Such must have happened from the\r\nearliest ages, as it happens daily in the present; but as a national\r\nvice it was not known until the spread of Islamism, when, by the\r\ntenets of the Prophet, wine and fermented liquors being prohibited, it\r\ncame in their stead along with the bang or hasch-schash (made from\r\nhemp), coffee, and tobacco. From the Arabs the inhabitants of the\r\nEastern Archipelago most probably imbibed their predilection for\r\nopium, although their particular manner of using it has evidently been\r\nderived from the Chinese. China, where at present it is so extensively\r\nused, cannot be said to have indulged long in the vice. Previous to\r\n1767 the number of chests imported did not exceed 200 yearly; now the\r\naverage is 50,000 to 60,000. In 1773 the East India Company made their\r\nfirst venture in opium, and in 1796 it was declared a crime to smoke\r\nopium.\r\n\r\nIn different countries we find opium consumed in different ways. In\r\nEngland it is either used in a solid state, made into pills, or a\r\ntincture in the shape of laudanum. Insidiously it is given to children\r\nunder a variety of quack forms, such as \"Godfrey's cordial,\" &c. In\r\nIndia the pure opium is either dissolved in water and so used, or\r\nrolled into pills. It is there a common practice to give it to\r\nchildren when very young, by mothers, who require to work and cannot\r\nat the same time nurse their offspring. In China it is either smoked\r\nor swallowed in the shape of _Tye_. In Bally it is first adulterated\r\nwith China paper, and then rolled up with the fibres of a particular\r\nkind of plantain. It is then inserted into a hole made at the end of a\r\nsmall bamboo, and smoked. In Java and Sumatra it is often mixed with\r\nsugar and the ripe fruit of the plantain. In Turkey it is usually\r\ntaken in pills, and those who do so, avoid drinking any water after\r\nswallowing them, as this is said to produce violent colics; but to\r\nmake it more palatable, it is sometimes mixed with syrups or thickened\r\njuices; in this form, however, it is less intoxicating, and resembles\r\nmead. It is then taken with a spoon, or is dried in small cakes, with\r\nthe words \"Mash Allah,\" or \"Word of God,\" imprinted on them. When the\r\ndose of two or three drachms a day no longer produces the beatific\r\nintoxication, so eagerly sought by the opiophagi, they mix the opium\r\nwith corrosive sublimate, increasing the quantity of the latter till\r\nit reaches ten grains a day. It then acts as a stimulant. In addition\r\nto its being used in the shape of pills, it is frequently mixed with\r\nhellebore and hemp, and forms a mixture known by the name of majoon,\r\nwhose properties are different from that of opium, and may account in\r\na great measure for the want of similitude in the effect of the drug\r\non the Turk and the Chinese.\r\n\r\nIn Singapore and China the refuse of the chandu, the prepared extract\r\nof opium, is all used by the lower classes. This extract, when\r\nconsumed, leaves a refuse, consisting of charcoal, empyreumatic oil,\r\nsome of the salts of opium, and a part of the chandu not consumed. Now\r\none ounce of chandu gives nearly half an ounce of this refuse, called\r\nTye, or Tinco. This is smoked and swallowed by the poorer classes, who\r\nonly pay half the price of chandu for it. When smoked it yields a\r\nfurther refuse called samshing, and this is even used by the still\r\npoorer, although it contains a very small quantity of the narcotic\r\nprinciple. Samshing, however, is never smoked, as it cannot furnish\r\nany smoke, but is swallowed, and that not unfrequently mixed with\r\narrack.\r\n\r\n    _Preparation_.--In Asia Minor, men, women, and children, a few days\r\n    after the flower falls from the poppies, proceed to the fields, and\r\n    with a shell scratch the capsules, wait twenty-four hours, and\r\n    collect the tears, which amount to two or three grains in weight\r\n    from each capsule. These being collected and mixed with the\r\n    scrapings of the shells, worked up with saliva and surrounded by\r\n    dried leaves, it is then sold, but, generally speaking, not without\r\n    being still more adulterated with cow's dung, sand, gravel, the\r\n    petals of flowers, &c. Different kinds of opium are known in the\r\n    markets of Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\n    The first in point of quality is the _Smyrna_, known in commerce as\r\n    the _Turkey_ or _Levant_. It occurs in irregular, rounded, flattened\r\n    masses, seldom exceeding two pounds in weight, and surrounded by\r\n    leaves of a kind of sorrel; the quantity of morphia said to be\r\n    derived from average specimens is eight per cent.\r\n\r\n    Second, _Constantinople Opium_, two kinds of which are found in the\r\n    market, one in very voluminous irregular cakes, which are flattened\r\n    like the Smyrna; this is a good quality. The other kind is in small,\r\n    flattened, regular cakes, from two to two and a half inches in\r\n    diameter, and covered with the leaves of the poppy; the quantity of\r\n    morphia is very uncertain in this description of opium, sometimes\r\n    mounting as high as 15 per cent., and sometimes descending so low as\r\n    six, showing the great variety in the quality of the drug.\r\n\r\n    Third, _Egyptian Opium_, occurs in round flattened cakes, about 3\r\n    inches in diameter, and covered externally with the vestiges of\r\n    some leaf. It is distinguished from the others by its reddish color,\r\n    resembling \"Socotrine Aloes.\" The quantity of morphia in this is\r\n    inferior to the preceding. It has one quality which, when\r\n    adulterated, ought to be known, that is a musty smell. By keeping it\r\n    does not blacken like the other kinds.\r\n\r\n    Fourth, _English Opium_, is in flat cakes or balls enveloped in\r\n    leaves. It resembles fine Egyptian opium more than any other kind.\r\n    Its color is that of hepatic aloes, and in the quantity of morphia\r\n    it is inferior to the preceding, but in the strength of the mass it\r\n    is said by one of its most extensive cultivators to be superior.\r\n\r\n    Fifth, _French_, and sixth _German Opium_, require no particular\r\n    remarks. By a recent notice I find the French are cultivating the\r\n    poppy in Algeria, from which they get opium giving a small per\r\n    centage of morphia.\r\n\r\n    Seventh, _Trebizond_ or _Persian Opium_, is sometimes met with of a\r\n    very inferior quality in the form of cylindrical sticks, which by\r\n    pressure have become angular.\r\n\r\n    Eighth, _Indian Opium_, divided into four kinds, Cutch, Malwa, Patna\r\n    and Benares. Of these Cutch is but little known or cultivated. It\r\n    occurs in small cakes covered with leaves, and its color is much\r\n    inferior to Smyrna. Malwa opium is to be met with of two kinds. The\r\n    inferior is in flattened cakes, without any external covering, dull,\r\n    opaque, blackish brown externally, internally somewhat darker, and\r\n    soft. Its color is somewhat like the Smyrna, but less powerful, and\r\n    with a slight smoky smell. Superior Malwa is in square cakes, about\r\n    three inches in length and one inch thick. It has the appearance of\r\n    a well prepared, shining, dry, pharmaceutical extract; its color is\r\n    blackish brown, its odor less powerful than Smyrna; it is not\r\n    covered by petals as the following kinds are, but smeared with oil;\r\n    it is then rubbed with pounded petals.\r\n\r\n    The Behar, Patna, and Benares Opium, being strictly in the hands of\r\n    Government, no adulteration can take place, without a most extensive\r\n    system of fraud; but it will not be uninteresting to trace the\r\n    progress of the opium from the hands of the natives, to the\r\n    condition in which it is delivered to the public by the Government.\r\n\r\n    From the commencement of the hot season to the middle of the rains\r\n    the Government is ready to receive opium, which is brought by the\r\n    natives every morning, in batches, varying in quantities from twenty\r\n    seers to a maund. The examining officer into each jar thrusts his\r\n    examining rod, which consists of a slit bamboo, and, by experience,\r\n    he can so judge of the qualities of the specimens before him, which\r\n    are sorted into lots of No. 1 to No. 4 quality. Opium of the first\r\n    quality is of a fine chesnut color, aromatic smell, and dense\r\n    consistence. It is moderately ductile, and, when the mass is torn,\r\n    breaks with a deeply notched fracture, with sharp needle-like\r\n    fibres, translucent and ruby red at the edges. It is readily broken\r\n    down under water, and the solution at first filters of a sherry\r\n    color, which darkens as the process proceeds. One hundred grains of\r\n    this yield an extract to cold distilled water of from 35 to 45, and\r\n    at the temperature of 212 degs., leaves from 20 to 28 per cent.,\r\n    having a consistency of 70 to 72, the consistence of the factory.\r\n\r\n    The second quality is inferior to the first, and the third quality\r\n    is possessed of the following properties, black paste, of a very\r\n    heavy smell, drops from the examining rod, gives off from 40 to 50\r\n    per cent, of moisture, and contains a large quantity of \"Pasewa;\"\r\n    while the fourth or last number embraces all the kinds which are too\r\n    bad to be used in the composition of the balls, comprising specimens\r\n    of all varieties of color and consistence. This number is mixed with\r\n    water, and only used as a paste to cement the covering of the balls.\r\n\r\n    The three first qualities are emptied from their jars into large\r\n    tanks, in which they are kept until the supply of the season has\r\n    been obtained. The opium is then removed and exposed to the air on\r\n    shallow wooden frames, until it becomes of the consistency of from\r\n    69 to 70, when it is given to the cake maker, who guesses to a\r\n    drachm the exact weight, and envelops the opium in its covering of\r\n    petals, cemented by a covering of quality number 4. The balls are\r\n    then weighed and stored, to undergo a thorough ventilation and\r\n    drying. Formerly the covering of the balls was composed of the\r\n    leaves of tobacco; but the late Mr. Flemming introduced the\r\n    practice of using the petals of the poppy, which was such an\r\n    improvement that the Court of Directors presented him with 50,000\r\n    rupees. The balls, forty in number, are packed in a mango wood case,\r\n    which consists of two stories with twenty pigeon holes in each,\r\n    lined with lath and surrounded by the dried leaves of the poppy.\r\n    Sometimes these balls are so soft as to burst their skins, and much\r\n    of the liquid opium running out, is lost. In 1823, many of the\r\n    chests of Patna lost five catties from this cause, and to this day\r\n    we have the same thing continuing to occur. Patna chests are covered\r\n    with bullock hides, Benares with gunnies.\r\n\r\nDr. Impey, staff surgeon at Poona, who resided in Malwa from 1843 to\r\n1846, published at Bombay, in 1848, a valuable treatise on the\r\ncultivation, preparation, and adulteration of Malwa opium. It was some\r\ntime before he obtained the permission of the East India Company to\r\npublish the result of the experience he had acquired in Malwa, and as\r\nGovernment inspector of opium at Bombay. It is the most practical\r\ntreatise I have yet met with, although a very elaborate, useful paper,\r\nby Mr. Little, surgeon, of Singapore, appears in the 2nd vol. of the\r\n\"Journal of the Indian Archipelago,\" from which I have quoted the\r\npreceding remarks.\r\n\r\nMr. Little furnishes a complete history of the drug, and the physical\r\nand mental effects resulting from its habitual use. There are also\r\nsome able remarks in Dr. O'Shaughnessy's Bengal Dispensatory:--\r\n\r\n    For the successful cultivation of opium, a mild climate, plentiful\r\n    irrigation, a rich soil, and diligent husbandry, are indispensable.\r\n    In reference to the first of these, Malwa is placed most favorably.\r\n    The country is in general from 1,300 to 2,000 feet above the level\r\n    of the sea: the mean temperature is moderate, and range of the\r\n    thermometer small. Opium is always cultivated in ground near a tank\r\n    or running stream, so as to be insured at all times of an abundant\r\n    supply of water. The rich black loam, supposed to be produced by the\r\n    decomposition of trap, and known by the name of cotton soil, is that\r\n    prepared for opium. Though fertile and rich enough to produce thirty\r\n    successive crops of wheat without fallowing, it is not sufficiently\r\n    rich for the growth of the poppy until largely supplied with manure.\r\n    There is, in fact, no crop known to the agriculturist, unless sugar\r\n    cane, that requires so much care and labor as the poppy. The ground\r\n    is first four times ploughed on four successive days, then carefully\r\n    harrowed; when manure, at the rate of from eight to ten cart loads\r\n    an acre, is applied to it; this is scarcely half what is allowed a\r\n    turnip crop at home. The crop is after this watered once every eight\r\n    or ten days, the total number of waterings never exceeding nine in\r\n    all. One beegah takes two days to soak thoroughly in the cold\r\n    weather, and four as the hot season approaches. Water applied after\r\n    the petals drop from the flower, causes the whole to wither and\r\n    decay. When the plants are six inches high, they are weeded and\r\n    thinned, leaving about a foot and a-half betwixt each plant; in\r\n    three months they reach maturity, and are then about four feet in\r\n    height if well cultivated. The full-grown seed-pod measures three\r\n    and a-half inches vertically, and two and a-half in horizontal\r\n    diameter. Early in February and March the bleeding process\r\n    commences. Three small lancet-shaped pieces of iron are bound\r\n    together with cotton, about one-twelfth of an inch of the blade\r\n    alone protruding, so that no discretion as to the depth of the wound\r\n    to be inflicted shall be left to the operator; and this is drawn\r\n    sharply up from the top of the stalk at the base, to the summit of\r\n    the pod. The sets of people are so arranged that each plant is bled\r\n    all over once every three or four days, the bleedings being three or\r\n    four times repeated on each plant. This operation always begins to\r\n    be performed about three or four o'clock in the afternoon, the\r\n    hottest part of the day. The juice appears almost immediately on the\r\n    wound being inflicted, in the shape of a thick gummy milk, which is\r\n    thickly covered with a brownish pellicle. The exudation is greatest\r\n    over night, when the incisions are washed and kept open by the dew.\r\n    The opium thus derived is scraped off next morning, with a blunt\r\n    iron tool resembling a cleaver in miniature. Here the work of\r\n    adulteration begins--the scraper being passed heavily over the\r\n    seed-pod, so as to carry with it a considerable portion of the\r\n    beard, or pubescence, which contaminates the drug and increases its\r\n    apparent quantity. The work of scraping begins at dawn, and must be\r\n    continued till ten o'clock; during this time a workman will collect\r\n    seven or eight ounces of what is called \"chick.\" The drug is next\r\n    thrown into an earthen vessel, and covered over or drowned in\r\n    linseed oil, at the rate of two parts of oil to one of chick, so as\r\n    to prevent evaporation. This is the second process of\r\n    adulteration--the ryot desiring to sell the drug as much drenched\r\n    with oil as possible, the retailers at the same time refusing to\r\n    purchase that which is thinner than half dried glue. One acre of\r\n    well cultivated ground will yield from 70 to 100 pounds of chick.\r\n    The price of chick varies from three to six rupees a pound, so that\r\n    an acre will yield from 200 to 600 rupees worth of opium at one\r\n    crop. Three pounds of chick will produce about two pounds of opium,\r\n    from a third to a fifth of the weight being lost in evaporation. It\r\n    now passes into the hands of the Bunniah, who prepares it and brings\r\n    it to market. From twenty-five to fifty pounds having been\r\n    collected, is tied up in parcels in double bags of sheeting cloth,\r\n    which are suspended from the ceilings so as to avoid air and light,\r\n    while the spare linseed oil is allowed to drop through. This\r\n    operation is completed in a week or ten days, but the bags are\r\n    allowed to remain for a month or six weeks, during which period the\r\n    last of the oil that can be separated comes away; the rest probably\r\n    absorbs oxygen and becomes thicker, as in paint. This process\r\n    occupies from April to June or July, when the rain begins. The bags\r\n    are next taken down and their contents carefully emptied into large\r\n    vats from ten to fifteen feet in diameter, and six or eight inches\r\n    thick. Here it is mixed together and worked up with the hands five\r\n    or six hours, until it has acquired an uniform color and consistence\r\n    throughout, become tough and capable of being formed into masses.\r\n    This process is peculiar to Malwa. It is now made up into balls of\r\n    from eight to ten ounces each, these being thrown, as formed, into a\r\n    basket full of the chaff of the seeds pod. It is next spread out on\r\n    ground previously covered with leaves and stalks of the poppy; here\r\n    it remains for a week or so, when it is turned over and left further\r\n    to consolidate, until hard enough to bear packing. It is ready for\r\n    weighing in October or November, and is then sent to market. It is\r\n    next packed in chests of 150 cakes, the total cost of the drug at\r\n    the place of production being about fourteen rupees per chest,\r\n    including all expenses. About 20,000 chests are annually sent from\r\n    Malwa, at a prime cost charge of two lacs and 80,000 rupees. It may\r\n    easily be supposed that manipulations so numerous, complex, and\r\n    tedious, as those described, give the most ample opportunities for\r\n    the adulteration to which the nature of the drug tempts the\r\n    fraudulent dealer.\r\n\r\n    In order to enable the cultivator to carry on his agricultural\r\n    operations, he receives from time to time certain advances, the\r\n    amount of which reaches in the aggregate to about one-half of the\r\n    value of the estimated out-turn of produce. If the land has been\r\n    under cultivation in previous seasons, its average produce is known;\r\n    if it be new land, and considered by the Sub-Deputy Agent as\r\n    eligible, then the cultivator, in addition to the usual advances,\r\n    receives an advance of so much per biggah to enable him to bestow a\r\n    certain amount of extra care in tilling and dressing the soil. The\r\n    first advance is made on the completion of the agreement or\r\n    bundobust, and this takes place in September and October. The second\r\n    advance is made on the completion of the sowings in November, and\r\n    the final or Chook payment is made immediately after the delivery\r\n    and weighing of the produce. Nothing therefore can be fairer to the\r\n    cultivator than this system of advances; he is subject to no sort of\r\n    exaction, in the shape of interest or commission on the money which\r\n    he receives, and it puts within his power the certain means of\r\n    making a fair profit by the exercise of common care and honesty. It\r\n    is an established rule in the Agency that the cultivator's accounts\r\n    of one season shall be definitively settled before the commencement\r\n    of the next, and that no outstanding balances shall remain over.\r\n    When a cultivator has from fraud neglected to bring produce to cover\r\n    his advances, the balances due by him are at once recovered, if\r\n    necessary by legal means; whereas, if he can satisfactorily show\r\n    that he has become a defaulter from calamity and uncontrollable\r\n    circumstances, and that the liquidation of his debt is placed\r\n    entirely beyond his power, his case is then made the subject of\r\n    report to the Government by the Agent, with the request that the\r\n    debt may be written off to profit and loss. These provisions are\r\n    most wise, for outstanding balances may be made the means of\r\n    oppression, and to their operation may be traced a considerable\r\n    amount of litigation and agrarian crime in the indigo districts of\r\n    lower Bengal. It is clear that when such balances become so large\r\n    that the cultivator cannot discharge them, he is no longer a free\r\n    agent, but is perfectly subservient to the will of his creditor, for\r\n    whom he must cultivate whether he desire it or not. Such burdens may\r\n    even be handed down from father to son. The fairness of the Agency\r\n    system, and the justice with which the cultivators are treated, are\r\n    best evidenced by the readiness with which they come forward to\r\n    cultivate, and also by the comparative rarity of agrarian crime,\r\n    arising out of matters connected with the poppy cultivation.\r\n\r\nOpium is grown to some extent in Egypt; 39,875 lbs. were produced in\r\n1831, and sold at two dollars a pound.\r\n\r\nAt the end of October, after the withdrawal of the Nile waters the\r\nseed, mixed with a portion of pulverised earth, is sown in a strong\r\nsoil, in furrows; after fifteen days the plant springs up, and in two\r\nmonths has the thickness of a Turkish pipe, and a height of four feet;\r\nthe stalk is covered with long, oval leaves, and the fruit, which is\r\ngreenish, resembles a small orange. Every morning before sunrise, in\r\nits progress to maturity, small incisions are made in the sides of the\r\nfruit, from which a white liquor distils almost immediately, which is\r\ncollected in a vessel; it soon becomes black and thickish, and is\r\nrolled into balls, which are covered with the washed leaves of the\r\nplant; in this state it is sold. The seeds are crushed for lamp oil,\r\nand the plant is used for fuel.\r\n\r\nA plant known in Jamaica under the name of bull hoof yields a narcotic\r\nwhich has been administered successfully in the shape of tincture and\r\na syrup, instead of opium. This is the _Muracuja ocellata_, or\r\n_Passiflora muracuja_, of Swartz, an elegant climber, bearing bright\r\nscarlet blossoms. There is another species, _M. orbiculata_, found in\r\nHayti and other islands, which may be expected to partake more or less\r\nof the properties of the former. The flowers are the parts most\r\ncommonly employed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TOBACCO PLANT.\r\n\r\nSeveral species of _Nicotium_ furnish tobacco; that chiefly used in\r\nEurope is procured from _N. Tabacum_ and its numerous varieties, a\r\nplant naturally inhabiting the hotter parts of North and South\r\nAmerica. The popular narcotic furnished by tobacco is probably in more\r\nextensive use than any other, and its only rivals are opium and the\r\nbetel-nut and leaf of the East. The herb for smoking was brought to\r\nEngland from Tobago, in the West Indies, or from Tobasco, in Mexico\r\n(whence the name), by Sir Ralph Lane, in 1586. Seeds were shortly\r\nafter introduced from the same quarter.\r\n\r\n\"Tobacco, as used by man,\" says Du Tour, \"gives pleasure to the savage\r\nand the philosopher, to the inhabitant of the burning desert and the\r\nfrozen zone; in short, its use, either in powder, to chew, or to\r\nsmoke, is universal; and for no other reason than a sort of convulsive\r\nmotion (sneezing) produced by the first, and a degree of intoxication\r\nby the two last modes of use.\"\r\n\r\nTobacco is an annual plant, attaining a height of six feet, having\r\ndingy red, funnel-shaped flowers, and viscid leaves. The leaves are\r\nthe officinal part, and their active properties depend on a peculiar,\r\noily-like alkaloid, called Nicotin. The flavor and strength of tobacco\r\ndepend on climate, cultivation, and the mode of manufacture. That most\r\nesteemed by the smoker is Havanna tobacco, but the Virginian is the\r\nstrongest. The small Havanna cigars are prepared from the leaves of\r\n_Nicotium repanda_, Syrian and Turkish tobacco from _N. rustica_, and\r\nfine Shiraz tobacco from _N. persica_. With the exception of the\r\nMacuba tobacco, which is cultivated in Martinique in a peculiar soil,\r\nthe tobacco of Cuba is considered the finest in the world. That grown\r\nin the island of Trinidad is, however, fully equal to it in quality,\r\nbut all raised in the colony is generally consumed there, and is\r\nlittle known in the English market. This ought not to be the case, for\r\nno article would pay better.\r\n\r\nThe Maryland is a very light tobacco, in thin, yellow leaves; that of\r\nVirginia is in large brown leaves, unctuous or somewhat gluey on the\r\nsurface, having a smell very like the figs of Malaga; that of Havanna\r\nis in brownish light leaves, of an agreeable and rather spicy\r\nsmell,--it forms, as I have already stated, the best cigars. The\r\nCarolina tobacco is less unctuous than the Virginian, but in the\r\nUnited States it ranks next to the Maryland. The shag tobacco is dried\r\nto the proper point upon sheets of copper, and is cut up by\r\nknife-edged chopping stamps. There are said to be four kinds of\r\ntobacco reared in Virginia, viz., the sweet-scented, which is\r\nconsidered the best; the _big and little_, which follows next; then\r\nthe Frederick; and, lastly, the _one and all_, the largest kind, and\r\nproducing most in point of quantity.\r\n\r\nAccording to Loudon (\"Encyclo. of Plants\"), there are fourteen species\r\nof this genus, besides a few varieties. Lindley, however, enumerates\r\n31, but many of these are mere showy species, adapted to flower\r\ngardens. I shall therefore follow chiefly London's classification--\r\n\r\n    1. _N. Tabacum_, a native of several parts of America, but\r\n    principally known as Virginian tobacco, having a stem rising from\r\n    four to six feet or more in height, bearing pink flowers. Of this\r\n    there are three chief varieties known in America by the popular\r\n    names of Orinoco, Broad-leaved and Narrow-leaved. Lindley enumerates\r\n    eight varieties of _N. Tabacum_.\r\n\r\n    2. _N. macrophylla_, or large-leaved tobacco, an ornamental annual,\r\n    also with pink flowers, native of America, which rises to the height\r\n    of six feet.\r\n\r\n    3. _N. fruticosa_, or shrubby tobacco, an ornamental evergreen\r\n    shrub, native of China, with pink blossoms, which grows to about\r\n    three feet.\r\n\r\n    4. _N. undulata_, or _suaveolens_, sweet-scented or New Holland\r\n    tobacco, a green house perennial, native of New South Wales, with\r\n    white flowers, which is only two feet high.\r\n\r\n    5. _N. rustica_.--The common green or English tobacco, an annual\r\n    plant, native of America, producing white flowers, which seldom\r\n    grows higher than three feet.\r\n\r\n    6. _N. paniculata_, or panicled tobacco, an annual plant bearing\r\n    greenish yellow flowers, native of Peru, rises to the height of\r\n    three feet.\r\n\r\n    7. _N. glutinosa_, or clammy-leaved tobacco, also an annual plant,\r\n    native of Peru, growing to the height of four feet, with bright\r\n    scarlet flowers.\r\n\r\n    8. _N. plumbaginifolia_, or curled-leaved tobacco, an ornamental\r\n    deciduous annual, native of America, with white blossoms, rising to\r\n    the height of two feet.\r\n\r\n    9. _N. pusilla_, or primrose-leaved tobacco, an ornamental deciduous\r\n    biennial, with white flowers, native of Vera Cruz, rising to three\r\n    feet.\r\n\r\n    10. _N. quadrivalvis_, four-valved, or Missouri tobacco, an\r\n    ornamental annual, native of North America, with white flowers,\r\n    seldom growing higher than two feet.\r\n\r\n    11. _N. nana_, or rocky mount tobacco, a curious greenhouse annual,\r\n    native of North America, with white blossoms, rising only three\r\n    inches high.\r\n\r\n    12. _N. Langsdorffii_, or Langsdorff's tobacco, an ornamental\r\n    annual, with greenish yellow flowers, native of Chili, reaching five\r\n    feet high.\r\n\r\n    13. _N. cerinthoides_, or honey-wort tobacco, an ornamental annual,\r\n    with greenish yellow flowers, native country unknown.\r\n\r\n    14. _N. repanda_, or Havanna tobacco, an annual with white flowers,\r\n    native of Cuba, rising two feet high.\r\n\r\n    There are a few species, natives of the Province of Buenos Ayres,\r\n    which may be particularised. _N. bonariensis_, having white flowers;\r\n    _N. glauca_, yellowish green flowers; _N. longiflora_, white\r\n    flowers; and _N. viscosa_, pink flowers.\r\n\r\nThe important mineral substances presented in Havanna tobacco,\r\nexamined by Hertung, are in 100 parts of ashes,\r\n\r\n  Salts of potash     34.15\r\n  Salts of lime       51.38\r\n  Magnesia             4.09\r\n  Phosphates           9.04\r\n\r\nThese substances were for the most part insoluble in earth, and must\r\nhave been dissolved during the growth of the crop.\r\n\r\n                         ANALYSIS  OF FIVE SAMPLES OF TOBACCO.\r\n                      No. 1.

Contained oxide of manganese in small quantity; sulphates in\r\n    watery solution of ash abundant. Hydrochloric solution contained an\r\n    abundance of lime.\r\n\r\n    4. A trace of manganese; a trace only of phosphoric acid in watery\r\n    solution.\r\n\r\n    5. Contained abundance of oxide of manganese.\r\n\r\n    6. Abundance of oxide of manganese.\r\n\r\n    7. A mere trace of oxide of manganese, and a trace of oxide of iron;\r\n    only a trace of alumina.\r\n\r\n    8. A trace of oxide of manganese; quantity of oxide of iron very\r\n    great; only a trace of alumina.\r\n\r\nIn rich loams, where the solution of the minerals of the soil is\r\nrapid, and where 10 to 20 per cent, of vegetable matter is\r\nincorporated in the earth, tobacco may be obtained for many years, but\r\nit is always an exhausting crop. It has been stated that 170 Lbs. of\r\nmineral matter are removed in less than three months from one acre of\r\nland, by a crop of tobacco. This is very much more than wheat or other\r\ngrains abstract from the soil in eight or nine months.\r\n\r\nTobacco is now very extensively cultivated in France and other\r\nEuropean countries, in the Levant, the East and West Indies; and a\r\nlittle is grown at the Cape and in the Australian Settlements.\r\n\r\nA good deal of tobacco is raised in Mexico, but only for home\r\nconsumption, as its export is prohibited. It forms an article of\r\nculture in Brazil and some of the South American republics, and is\r\ngrown to a small extent along the Western shores of Africa. It is from\r\nNorth America, however, that we derive the bulk of our supplies of\r\nthis great article of commerce, which, with cotton, forms the chief\r\nagricultural wealth of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn 1821, the tobacco exported from the Brazils amounted to 29,192,000\r\nLbs., but its cultivation was greatly injured by the siege of the\r\ncapital in 1822-23. Fresh seed was subsequently obtained from Cuba,\r\nand in 1835 the exports were 6,051,040 Lbs.\r\n\r\n131 cases of Princeza snuff were shipped from Bahia to Lisbon, in\r\n1835; about 60,000 Lbs. per annum of this snuff being now manufactured\r\nat Bahia, with the aid of two steam-engines. The exports of tobacco\r\nfrom Bahia increased from 2,048,000 Lbs. in 1833, to 6,051,040 Lbs. in\r\n1835. The average shipments are about 21,000 bales and rolls.\r\n\r\nThe army of smokers in Great Britain and Ireland consume yearly about\r\nsix millions of pounds worth of tobacco. The duty alone paid upon\r\nsnuff and tobacco for the people of Great Britain, averages\r\nfour-and-a-half millions sterling a year! The quantity\r\nconsumed--smoked, snuffed, or chewed--during the same period, is about\r\n28 millions of pounds weight, or about four pounds weight per annum\r\nfor every male adult. Ireland annually pays not less than £800,000 of\r\nduty on tobacco and snuff, and only about £30,000 on coffee. For every\r\npound of coffee that the Irish people use, they smoke away about _four\r\npounds of tobacco_.\r\n\r\nNorth America produces annually upwards of 200 million pounds. The\r\ncombustion of the mass of vegetable material used in this kingdom\r\nwould yield about 340 million pounds of carbonic acid gas; so that the\r\nyearly produce of carbonic acid gas from tobacco smoking alone cannot\r\nbe less than 1,000,000,000 lbs.--a large contribution to the annual\r\ndemand for this gas made upon the atmosphere for the vegetation of the\r\nworld. Henceforth let no one twit the smoker with idleness and\r\nunimportance. Every pipe is an agricultural furnace,--every smoker a\r\nmanufacturer of vegetation,--the consumer of a weed that he may rear\r\nmore largely his own provisions.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1842, 605,000,000 of cigars were made in the German\r\nCommercial Union.\r\n\r\nIn 1839, the revenue on tobacco in this country was about £3,600,000.\r\nOf this it has been estimated eleven-twelfths are drawn from the\r\nworking classes, and one-twelfth from the richer classes. The\r\nfollowing is a calculation of the consumption of tobacco per head of\r\nthe population, estimated from the number of pounds on which duty was\r\npaid:--\r\n\r\n                                   Consumption per head.\r\n             Rate of duty.                ozs.\r\n  1801   {1s. 7 3-10d.

A duty so enormously disproportioned to the cost offers\r\n    an irresistible premium to the illicit trader; for the expense of\r\n    smuggling tobacco by the cargo, including the first cost, does not\r\n    exceed 9½d. per lb., and it has been ascertained that the smuggler\r\n    receives 6d. per lb. less than the duty, or 2s. 6d. per lb., which\r\n    yields him a clear profit of 1s. 8½d. per lb., to the injury not\r\n    only of the revenue, but of the fair trader.\r\n\r\n    The effect of this heavy duty in diminishing the consumption of\r\n    duty-paid tobacco is further exemplified by the fact that, while all\r\n    other articles of general consumption have progressively increased\r\n    with the increase of the population, tobacco alone forms an\r\n    exception, as will appear from the  following:--\r\n\r\n      COMPARATIVE SCALE OF POPULATION AND CONSUMPTION OF TEA, COFFEE,\r\n  AND TOBACCO, IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND, COMPILED FROM PARLIAMENTARY\r\n                                 PAPERS.\r\n\r\n          Population        Tea             Coffee           Tobacco\r\n  1801    16,338,102\r\n  Duty,                65 a 95 per ct   19d. per lb.      19d. per lb.\r\n                                        & 12½ per ct.  & 12½ per ct.\r\n                 Lbs., 23,163,999          871,846        16,895,752\r\n  1811    18,547,720\r\n  Duty                 96 per cent.     8d. per lb.       26½d. per lb.\r\n                 Lbs., 24,461,308        6,895,619        21,376,370\r\n  1821    21,193,458\r\n  Duty,                96 a 100 per ct. 12d. per lb.      4s. per lb.\r\n                 Lbs., 26,043,257        7,593,001         1,823,365\r\n  1831    24,271,763\r\n  Duty                 96a 100 per ct.  6d. per lb.       3s. per lb.\r\n                 Lbs., 30,648,348       22,740,627        19,418,941\r\n  1841    26,855,928\r\n  Duty,                26¼d. per lb. 6d. per lb.       3s. per lb.\r\n                 Lbs., 36,396,073       28,420,980        22,094,772\r\n\r\nThe consumption of tobacco in the island of Great Britain, excluding\r\nIreland, and the duty thereon, were in\r\n\r\n            Consumption.

But the\r\n    difference in duty in the latter case was not sufficient to curtail\r\n    the profits of the smuggler to any material extent.\r\n\r\n    Cigars afford a remarkable example of the amount of duty being\r\n    increased by diminishing the rate. In 1828, when the duty was 18s.\r\n    per lb., duty was paid on 8,600 lbs. only, yielding £7,740. In 1830,\r\n    when the duty was reduced to 9s. per lb., duty was paid on 66,000\r\n    lbs., yielding £29,700; and such has been the increase of\r\n    consumption, that, in 1841, duty was paid on 213,613 lbs., yielding\r\n    £100,899.\r\n\r\n    We would further illustrate the position by the following facts:\r\n\r\n    In 1798, Ireland, with a population of 4,000,000, consumed 8,000,000\r\n    lbs. of tobacco, and now, with more than double the population, she\r\n    consumes about 3,000,000 lbs. of tobacco less than at the former\r\n    period. The reason is obvious: in 1789 the duty was 8d. per lb; now\r\n    it is 3s. In 1798, England and Scotland, with a population of\r\n    10,000,000, consumed 10,000,000 lbs. of tobacco, being one half of\r\n    the relative consumption of Ireland at the same period; the duty in\r\n    England and Scotland being then 1s. 7d. per lb., and in Ireland only\r\n    8d.\r\n\r\n    But the quantity of tobacco on which duty is paid does not even\r\n    approximately show the quantity consumed. If the duty now paid on\r\n    tobacco in the United Kingdom retained the same relative proportion\r\n    to the population that it held in Ireland in 1798, the duty in 1841\r\n    would have been actually levied upon 53,711,856 lbs., instead of\r\n    22,094,772 lbs.; and such we believe to be about the actual amount\r\n    of consumption, the great bulk of the supply being furnished by the\r\n    illicit trader.\r\n\r\n    In Prussia, it appears that the consumption of tobacco is at the\r\n    rate of three pounds per head; while, in England, if we were to\r\n    judge from the amount on which duty is paid, it is considerably less\r\n    than one pound per head.\r\n\r\n    Assuming the actual consumption at only 45,000,000 lbs., or two\r\n    pounds per head, we believe that a reduction of duty to 1s. per\r\n    pound would so effectually destroy the illicit trader, that the\r\n    revenue would gain by the change, not only by bringing upwards of\r\n    30,000,000 lbs. under duty, which at present escape, but by the\r\n    great increase of the consumption consequent upon the encouragement\r\n    given to the fair trader.\r\n\r\n    We would not, however, treat the question merely as a matter of\r\n    revenue. We would strongly represent the injustice which this\r\n    exorbitant duty inflicts upon those who pursue a legitimate trade,\r\n    by enabling the smuggler to lessen the extent of their transactions\r\n    by more than half what they would otherwise be; and we would further\r\n    earnestly urge upon your consideration the demoralising tendency of\r\n    such a systematic and extended violation of the law, not only upon\r\n    those engaged in the illicit trade, also upon those parties who are\r\n    found to connive at the practice from a sense of the gross injustice\r\n    and impolicy of a duty so disproportioned to the value of an article\r\n    of such extensive consumption.\r\n\r\n    We would refer to the opinion of a committee of the House of Commons\r\n    on the growth of tobacco in Ireland, in 1840, as follows:--'That it\r\n    further appears, from the evidence, that smuggling of foreign\r\n    tobacco is at present carried on to a great extent, and that all the\r\n    measures now adopted, at great expense to the country, are and will\r\n    be ineffectual to repress it so long as the temptation of evading a\r\n    duty equal to twelve times the value of the article on which it is\r\n    imposed, remains.\"\r\n\r\n    We beg, therefore, respectfully to express our opinion, that if the\r\n    duty on tobacco were reduced to one shilling per pound, it would be\r\n    alike beneficial to the interests of legitimate commerce; to the\r\n    consumers, who consist almost entirely of the poorer classes; to the\r\n    revenue, by increasing the productiveness of the duty, and by\r\n    greatly diminishing the expenditure so ineffectually incurred to\r\n    suppress the illicit trade; and to the general morals of society by\r\n    removing a powerful inducement to infringe the laws.\r\n\r\nThe imports of all kinds of tobacco for the last five years have been\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n                |   1848.  |   1849.  |   1850.  |   1851.  |   1852.\r\n                |   lbs.   |   lbs.   |   lbs.   |   lbs.   |   lbs.\r\n  Unmanufactured|34,090,360|41,546,848|35,166,358|31,061,953|33,205,635\r\n  Manufactured  |          |          |          |          |\r\n    and snuff   | 1,512,714| 1,905,306| 1,557,618| 2,331,886| 2,930,299\r\n                |----------|----------|----------|----------|----------\r\n                |35,603,074|43,452,154|36,723,876|33,393,839|36,135,934\r\n\r\n  Gross duty received:--\r\n\r\n                |   1848.  |   1849.  |   1850.  |   1851.  |   1852.\r\n                |     £    |     £    |     £    |     £    |     £\r\n  On raw tobacco| 4,267,579| 4,328,217| 4,337,258| 4,386,910| 4,466,533\r\n  Cigars, snuff,|          |          |          |          |\r\n    &c.         |    97,655|    96,814|    92,873|    98,858|    94,298\r\n                |----------|----------|----------|----------|----------\r\n                | 4,365,234| 4,425,031| 4,430,131| 4,485,768| 4,569,831\r\n\r\nThe amount of tobacco consumed is so limited that the trade will not\r\nadmit of an excessive growth. In the two most thickly populated\r\ncountries in Europe--France and England--not more than a certain\r\nquantity finds its way there. In France the trade is monopolised by\r\nGovernment, which gives out contracts to deliver a stipulated quantity\r\nat certain prices; in England the duty imposed is so enormous that\r\nonly a limited quantity of certain descriptions can be imported\r\nwithout risk of loss. In Germany and Holland, where the trade is more\r\nextensively carried on than elsewhere, the duty imposed is almost\r\nnominal, and all classes of their citizens are enabled to use the weed\r\nat prices very little higher than its first prime cost. The tobacco\r\ntrade constitutes so large a staple of American produce that it is\r\nsingular greater efforts are not made upon the part of that Government\r\nto cause a reciprocal duty to be imposed, that more favor may be shown\r\nby European Governments to this particular article. England, from the\r\nduty imposed upon it alone, derives a revenue of £4,500,000, being\r\nabout £160 to the hogshead, or from ten to sixteen times its original\r\ncost. France makes the trade a monopoly, from which she derives an\r\nincome of £3,000,000 sterling.\r\n\r\n   STATEMENT OF IMPORTS, SALES, AND STOCKS OF TOBACCO AND\r\n           STEMS, IN BREMEN, FROM 1840 TO 1850.\r\n  ----+---------------------------+-----------------------+\r\n      |          MARYLAND         |       VIRGINIAN       |\r\n  ----+------+------+------+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n      |      |      |      | S    |     |     |     | S   |\r\n      | S    |      |      | t    | S   |     |     | t   |\r\n      | t    |      |      | o  D | t   |     |     | o D |\r\n      | o  J |  I   |      | c  e | o J |  I  |     | c e |\r\n      | c  a |  m   |      | k  c | c a |  m  |     | k c |\r\n      | k  n |  p   |  S   |    e | k n |  p  |  S  |   e |\r\n    Y |    u |  o   |  a   | l  m |   u |  o  |  a  | l m |\r\n    e | 1  a |  r   |  l   | a  b | 1 a |  r  |  l  | a b |\r\n    a | s  r |  t   |  e   | s  e | s r |  t  |  e  | s e |\r\n    r | t  y |  s   |  s   | t  r | t y |  s  |  s  | t r |\r\n  ----+------+------+------+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n  1840| 4,890|14,570|18,399| 1,061|  245| 3492| 3422|  285|\r\n  1841| 1,061|19,629|18,321| 2,369|  285| 3466| 3025|  726|\r\n  1842| 2,369|20,821|19,067| 4,123|  726| 6729| 5898| 1557|\r\n  1843| 4,123|18,483|15,004| 7,602| 1557| 5541| 4242| 2856|\r\n  1844| 7,602|16,978|18,338| 6,242| 2856| 5092| 4282| 3666|\r\n  1845| 6,242|24,251|24,571| 5,922| 3666| 1588| 3099| 2155|\r\n  1846| 5,922|26,785|23,788| 8,919| 2155| 2386| 2456| 2085|\r\n  1847| 8,919|21,743|20,681| 9,981| 2085|  911| 2079|  917|\r\n  1848| 9,981|12,084| 9,935|12,130|  917|  847| 1054|  710|\r\n  1849|12,130|19,285|22,112| 9,303|  710| 1173| 1734|  149|\r\n  ----+------+------+------+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n\r\n  ----+---------------------------+-----------------------+\r\n      |          KENTUCKY         |         STEMS         |\r\n  ----+------+------+------+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n      |      |      |      | S    |     |     |     | S   |\r\n      | S    |      |      | t    | S   |     |     | t   |\r\n      | t    |      |      | o  D | t   |     |     | o D |\r\n      | o  J |  I   |      | c  e | o J |  I  |     | c e |\r\n      | c  a |  m   |      | k  c | c a |  m  |     | k c |\r\n      | k  n |  p   |  S   |    e | k n |  p  |  S  |   e |\r\n    Y |    u |  o   |  a   | l  m |   u |  o  |  a  | l m |\r\n    e | 1  a |  r   |  l   | a  b | 1 a |  r  |  l  | a b |\r\n    a | s  r |  t   |  e   | s  e | s r |  t  |  e  | s e |\r\n    r | t  y |  s   |  s   | t  r | t y |  s  |  s  | t r |\r\n  ----+------+------+------+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n  1840|   181| 3,803| 3,699|   285| 2853| 3362| 4564| 1651|\r\n  1841|   285| 5,206| 4,941|   550| 1651| 7085| 7054| 1682|\r\n  1842|   550| 9,407| 8,939|  1018| 1682| 4151| 5386|  447|\r\n  1843|  1018| 7,485| 6,441|  2062|  447| 3969| 3447|  969|\r\n  1844|  2062| 9,736| 9,569|  2229|  969| 4753| 5513|  209|\r\n  1845|  2269|11,439|10,328|  3340|  209| 5273| 4152| 1330|\r\n  1846|  3340| 5,028| 6,099|  2269| 1330| 6092| 4716| 2706|\r\n  1847|  2269| 3,816| 5,013|  1072| 2706| 6788| 8038| 1456|\r\n  1848|  1072| 4,448| 4,980|   540| 1456| 4912| 4473| 1895|\r\n  1849|   540| 4,620| 4,746|   414| 1895| 5188| 5083| 1000|\r\n  ----+------+------+------+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n\r\n_Culture and Statistics in the United States_.--Tobacco has been the\r\ngreat staple of the States of Virginia and Maryland from their first\r\nsettlement. About the year 1642 it became a royal monopoly, and\r\nafterwards, in order to encourage its growth in the colonies, and\r\nthereby increase the revenue of the Crown, Parliament prohibited the\r\nplanting of it in England. The average quantity shipped from the North\r\nAmerican colonies to the parent country, for ten years preceding the\r\nyear 1709, was about twenty-nine millions of pounds. For some years\r\nprior to the American revolution, about 85,000 hhds. were exported,\r\nthen valued at little more than four millions of dollars, and\r\nconstituting nearly one-third the value of all the exports of the\r\nBritish North American colonies. From 1820 to 1830 tobacco constituted\r\nabout one-ninth in value of all the domestic exports of the United\r\nStates. It finds a market principally in Great Britain, France,\r\nHolland, and the north of Europe.[55] The crop of tobacco produced in\r\nthe four principal States, was in--\r\n\r\n                     1838.             1839.\r\n                     hhds.             hhds.\r\n  Virginia          26,000            45,000\r\n  Kentucky          27,000            35,000\r\n  Maryland          16,000            16,000\r\n  Ohio               3,000             4,000\r\n                    ------           -------\r\n                    72,000           100,000\r\n\r\nThe whole crop of 1840 was 219,163,319 lbs., which, at the estimate\r\nof 1,200 lbs. to the hhd., would be equal to 182,636 hhds., and at the\r\naverage price of that year, 81 dollars 5 cents. per hhd., would make\r\nthe value of the crop of the United States 14,802,647 dollars 80\r\ncents. The average annual export for the ten years ending with 1840,\r\nwas 96,775 hhds. The actual exportation of 1840 was 119,484 hhds. The\r\nprincipal exports are formed of the produce of Virginia, Kentucky,\r\nTennessee, Maryland, and North Carolina. The exports are chiefly to\r\nthe following countries--about 30,000 hhds. annually to England,\r\n15,000 hhds. to France, 20,000 hhds. to Holland, 25,000 hhds. Germany,\r\nand about 22,000 hhds. to other countries. The whole crop for 1845 was\r\nput down at 187,422,000 lbs. In 1839, it was ascertained that one and\r\na half million persons were engaged in the cultivation and manufacture\r\nof tobacco in the United States, one million of whom were so occupied\r\nin the States of Virginia, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri. In the\r\ncity of New York the consumption of cigars is computed at 10,000\r\ndollars a day, a sum greater than that which the inhabitants pay for\r\ntheir daily bread; and in the whole country the annual consumption of\r\ntobacco is estimated at 120 million pounds, being 7 lbs. for every\r\nman, woman, and child, at an annual cost to the consumers of 20\r\nmillion dollars (more than four million pounds sterling).\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the manufacture of tobacco in the United States\r\nis increasing at the rate of 2,000 hhds. per annum.\r\n\r\n                                                     hhds.\r\n  The quantity manufactured in 1851, was stated at  55,000\r\n  Exportations for the year estimated at           120,000\r\n                                                   -------\r\n                                                   175,000\r\n\r\nThe production for 1852 is supposed to be as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                                     hhds.\r\n  Virginia                                          27,000\r\n  Maryland                                          33,000\r\n  Western States, including frosted                 65,000\r\n                                                   -------\r\n  Total production                                 125,000\r\n  Deficiency in the year's crop                     50,000\r\n\r\nThe quantity produced in the United States, in 1847, was 220,164,000\r\nlbs., worth, at 5 cents per lb., nearly 11 million dollars (more than\r\ntwo million sterling). The principal producing States were--Kentucky,\r\n65 million lbs.; Virginia, 50 millions; Tennessee, 35 millions; North\r\nCarolina, 14 millions; Ohio, 9 millions; Indiana, 4 millions;\r\nIllinois, Connecticut, and a few others in smaller proportions.\r\n\r\nThe production in 1848 was 218,909,000 lbs., which, valued at four\r\ncents per lb., would be worth nine million dollars. From persons\r\nlargely interested in the tobacco trade, and well informed in relation\r\nthereto, I have gathered the following general statements:--\r\n\r\n    The crops of tobacco to come to market in the year 1851, were\r\n    estimated as  follows--\r\n\r\n                                             hhds.\r\n  Virginia                                  30,000\r\n  Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri, about  50,000\r\n  Maryland, about                           22,000\r\n  Ohio, about                               14,000\r\n\r\n    From the above estimate it will be seen that the quantity produced\r\n    in 1850 is less than two-thirds of the usual production in the\r\n    States named. The entire crop of Virginia will be required for home\r\n    consumption. About 15,000 hhds. Kentucky, and 5,000 hhds. Maryland\r\n    will also be wanted for home use. Owing to the increase of\r\n    population by immigration and otherwise, the domestic consumption,\r\n    which was a few years ago so small as not to be considered worthy of\r\n    notice, has now increased to a very important item, and affords a\r\n    steady home market for a large portion of the production.\r\n\r\n    The quantity of Maryland tobacco left for export to Bremen and\r\n    Holland, in 1851, will only be about 17,000 hhds., which is not more\r\n    than half the amount usually shipped to these countries every year.\r\n\r\n    Of the Kentucky tobacco contracted for last year by France and\r\n    Spain, through their agents in this country, less than one third has\r\n    yet been purchased, and those governments will this year require the\r\n    deficiency to be made up, in addition to their annual average\r\n    supply, which, with the quantity required for England, will take the\r\n    entire crop, leaving nothing for the rest of Europe, Africa, South\r\n    America, the West Indies, &c. The tobacco markets throughout the\r\n    world are in a much more healthy condition than has ever been known,\r\n    and it is thought prices will rule very high the coming season.

The States in which the great bulk\r\n    of the crop is grown lie between the latitudes of about 34 and 40\r\n    degrees.\r\n\r\n    There is a considerable increase of consumption of American tobacco\r\n    in Europe, as well as in the United States, which should encourage\r\n    the planters of Virginia and North Carolina to cultivate this\r\n    article more abundantly than they have done for several years past;\r\n    and, since the home manufacture has increased so much, and the\r\n    Virginia tobacco is preferred in many parts of the European markets,\r\n    they may safely count on getting good prices for many years to come.\r\n\r\n    It is not in the power of Virginia to make any three years together\r\n    more than 56,000 hhds., even with good seasons, and 30,000 hhds.\r\n    annually of this will be wanted by our manufacturers.\r\n\r\n    The planters, then, should enrich their lands, and aim to make full\r\n    crops.\r\n\r\n    The increased consumption in Europe is three per cent., and in the\r\n    United States four per cent. per annum.\r\n\r\n    The crop of the United States from 1840 to 1850 inclusive--say 11\r\n    years--averaged about 160,000 hhds.; this embraces the large crops\r\n    of 1842-43-44.\r\n\r\n    The consumption of Europe from 1829 to 1838 was 96,826 hhds.--it is\r\n    now 130,000.\r\n\r\nAn account of the quantities of unmanufactured tobacco, manufactured\r\ncalled negro-head, and cigars, imported into the United Kingdom in\r\n1850:--\r\n\r\n    Countries from whence imported.

Clagett, Son, and Co., leading\r\nbrokers of London, dated Feb., 1st, 1850, I take the following\r\nextracts:--\r\n\r\n    The exhaustion of the stock has resulted from the concurrence of a\r\n    gradually decreasing supply and increasing consumption, which may\r\n    be very clearly perceived by a reference, first to the official\r\n    returns from New Orleans of the yearly receipts of the western crops\r\n    in each of the last seven years; and secondly, to the consumption of\r\n    American tobacco in Great Britain and Ireland in the years 1847,\r\n    1848, and 1849, as compared with that of 1840, 1841, and 1842. We\r\n    have no means of exhibiting with similar accuracy the relative\r\n    consumption of Continental Europe in the latter as compared with the\r\n    former part of these last ten years, but it is quite reasonable to\r\n    assume that the increase, where there has been little or no duty,\r\n    must have gone on more rapidly than it has done here, under the\r\n    restraining force of a duty of 800 to 900 per cent.\r\n\r\n    The deliveries from London and Liverpool, independently of those\r\n    from Scotland, Bristol, and Newcastle, for the use of Great Britain\r\n    and Ireland, have been as follows:--In 1840, 15,037 hhds.; 1841,\r\n    15,019 hhds.; 1842, 15,468 hhds.; 1847, 18,091 hhds.; 1848, 18,595\r\n    hhds.; 1849, 18,738 hhds.\r\n\r\n    The highest estimates we have seen of the whole of the crops of the\r\n    United Slates in 1849, do not exceed 140,000 hhds., of which it is\r\n    not doubted that fully 45,000 hhds. will be required for consumption\r\n    there, and we estimate the supply required for the consumption of\r\n    Europe, South America, the West Indies, and Africa, at certainly not\r\n    less than 125,000 hhds.; if these estimates be realised in fact, it\r\n    will follow that the stocks at the close of this year must be 30,000\r\n    hhds. less than at the close of 1849.\r\n\r\n    We estimate the present consumption of American tobacco in Great\r\n    Britain and Ireland as follows:--\r\n\r\n    The deliveries in London and Liverpool in 1849, were 18,738 hhds.;\r\n    do. do. Bristol 1,400 hhds.; do. do. Scotland we assume at 2,800\r\n    hhds. Total 22,939.\r\n\r\n    Of Stripts, the deliveries in Liverpool last year were 8,544 hhds.,\r\n    of which about 300 were for exportation; the deliveries, therefore,\r\n    were--For the use of Great Britain and Ireland, 8,250 hhds. In\r\n    London we have no account of the deliveries of stripts, as\r\n    distinguished from leaf, for the whole of last year; it is doubtless\r\n    less than that in Liverpool, and we assume it at 7,000 hhds.; in\r\n    Bristol it was about 900 hhds.; in Scotland we assume it at 2,400\r\n    hhds. Total 18,550 hhds.\r\n\r\n    Now, assuming 1,500 hhds. of the deliveries in Scotland and Bristol\r\n    to be included in the coastwise returns in London and Liverpool,\r\n    then the consumption of Great Britain and Ireland would appear to be\r\n    about 21,500 hhds. of American tobacco, and 17,000 for these to be\r\n    stripts. The progressive increase which we have shown in the returns\r\n    of 1849, as compared with those of 1840, must still go on.\r\n\r\n    Without troubling you with any detail of the stocks in each of the\r\n    several markets, it may be sufficient to show that the summary of\r\n    the whole in all the markets of Europe, other than Great Britain,\r\n    consisted on the 31st December, 1849, of about 22,000 hhds.; of\r\n    which about 18,000 were Maryland and 2,000 stalks; and it is\r\n    important to notice especially the fact, that the stocks of the\r\n    manufacturers and dealers in Germany, Holland and Belgium are\r\n    unusually small. We have taken very considerable care to inform\r\n    ourselves on this point, and are fully satisfied that the usual\r\n    stocks in second or dealers' hands do not exist. The whole demand of\r\n    the year must, therefore, be supplied from those stocks in\r\n    importers' hands, from England or from the United States.\r\n\r\n    The following were the prices current in London in the spring of\r\n    1853:--Virginia Leaf, common, per pound, 3¼d. to 3¾d.; middling, 5d.\r\n    to 6d.; good and fine 6½d. to 7½d. Stripts, 5½d. to 10d. Kentucky\r\n    Leaf: common 3d., to 3½d.; middling, 3¾d. to 4½d.; good and fine,\r\n    5d. to 6d. Stripts, 5d. to 7d. Maryland, 3½d. to 9d.

The rapidity of sales, the\r\n    diminished stocks even now held in first hands, were taken as an\r\n    infallible index of the progressive rate of consumption; and of a\r\n    truth the quantity of hogsheads received in the principal markets of\r\n    Belgium, Holland, Germany, and the North, and as speedily relieved\r\n    from the control of the importers, was enough to control even those\r\n    who were alive to the existing necessities of Europe, and to give a\r\n    color to the rumour of almost inexhaustible consumption.\r\n\r\n    This extraordinary demand for tobacco on the continent has been\r\n    occasioned by three distinct causes; the first of which was the\r\n    pressing wants which, for the last two years, were well known to\r\n    have existed, and the constant willingness of consumers to act at\r\n    the very moderate rates which prevailed some time last spring. The\r\n    second was the compulsory purchases by the Austrian Government,\r\n    amounting, it is estimated, to 20,000 hhds., by reason that the\r\n    discontented Hungarians, for political considerations, abandoned\r\n    altogether the cultivation of tobacco, and which deficiency was\r\n    obliged to be replaced by American growths. The third cause also had\r\n    a political origin: the anticipation of the extension of the\r\n    Zollverein or German Customs League to the Kingdoms of Hanover and\r\n    Oldenburg, whereby the duties on tobacco in those countries would be\r\n    greatly increased, was a natural incentive to the dealers and\r\n    manufacturers there to lay in heavy stocks, to reap the benefit\r\n    thereon; and these last two causes, therefore, may be viewed in the\r\n    light of fortuitous circumstances, which have fostered a speculation\r\n    originally founded on the cheapness of money alone.\r\n\r\n    It has been shown, and the statistics of the past year fully confirm\r\n    the statement, that a plethora of money and prosperity among the\r\n    middle classes of society, while it induces to the consumption of\r\n    tobacco in general, rather curtails than otherwise the demand for\r\n    American growths. A poor man addicted to smoking takes his pipe not\r\n    from choice, but necessity; as he grows independent, the humble pipe\r\n    is abandoned and the more costly cigar assumed. We have frequently\r\n    heard this matter noticed, more especially after the disasters which\r\n    followed the railway speculations of 1846, when the demand for\r\n    English cigars sensibly declined; and we have now a further\r\n    verification of the assertion in the opposite sense, the sales of\r\n    cigar materials in Bremen having been extended more than 40 per\r\n    cent, in three years, viz., from 94,750 bales and cases in 1850 to\r\n    135,650 during last season.\r\n\r\n    From New Orleans we learn that the arrivals from the interior since\r\n    the 1st September had amounted to 18,043 hhds. against 5,165 hhds.\r\n    last season, and the stock on hand was 24,128 hhds. against 7,927\r\n    hhds. only.\r\n\r\n    The shipments from Virginia during the past year exceeded 13,700\r\n    hhds. In 1851 they were under 4,000 casks.\r\n\r\n    From Baltimore 54,272 hhds. have been exported. The official figures\r\n    for the previous year gave 35,967 as the total.\r\n\r\n    The aggregate stock of tobacco on the 1st of January last, in the\r\n    principal ports of America, was taken at 52,982 hhds. against 45,292\r\n    the year before and the growth of the Western States, Virginia, and\r\n    Maryland during 1852, to come forward for our supply the present\r\n    season, is estimated at 185,000 hhds., notwithstanding all the\r\n    unfavorable influences and curtailing causes which were said to have\r\n    prevailed.\r\n\r\nThe method adopted of cultivating tobacco in Virginia is thus\r\ndescribed:\r\n\r\n    Several rich, moist, but not too wet spots of ground are chosen out\r\n    in the fall, each containing about a quarter of an acre or more,\r\n    according to the magnitude of the crop, and the number of plants it\r\n    may require.\r\n\r\n    These spots, which are generally in the woods, are cleared, and\r\n    covered with brush or timber, for five or six feet thick and\r\n    upwards; this is suffered to remain upon it until the time when the\r\n    tobacco seed must be sowed, which is within twelve days after\r\n    Christmas. The evening is commonly chosen to set these places on\r\n    fire, and when everything thereon is consumed to ashes, the ground\r\n    is dug up, mixed with the ashes, and broken very fine. The tobacco\r\n    seed, which is exceedingly small, being mixed with ashes also, is\r\n    then sown and just raked in lightly; the whole is immediately\r\n    covered with brushwood for shelter to keep it warm, and a slight\r\n    fence thrown around it. In this condition it remains until the\r\n    frosts are all gone, when the brush is taken off, and the young\r\n    plants are exposed to the nutritive and genial warmth of the sun,\r\n    which quickly invigorates them in an astonishing degree, and soon\r\n    renders them strong and large enough to be removed for planting,\r\n    especially if they be not sown too thick. Every tobacco planter,\r\n    assiduous to secure a sufficient quantity of plants, generally has\r\n    several of these plant beds in different situations, so that if one\r\n    should fail, another may succeed; and an experienced planter\r\n    commonly takes care to have ten times as many plants, as he can make\r\n    use of.\r\n\r\n    In these beds, along with the tobacco, they generally sow kale,\r\n    colewort, and cabbage seed, &c., at the same time.\r\n\r\n    There are seven different kinds of tobacco, particularly adapted to\r\n    the different qualities of the soil on which they are cultivated,\r\n    and each varying from the other. They are named Hudson, Frederick,\r\n    Thick-joint, Shoe-string, Thickset, Sweet-scented, and Oronoko. But\r\n    although these are the principal, yet there are a great many\r\n    different species besides, with names peculiar to the situations,\r\n    settlements and neighbourhoods wherein they are produced; which it\r\n    would be too tedious here to specify and particularise. The soil for\r\n    tobacco must be rich and strong; the ground is prepared in the\r\n    following manner:--after being well broke up and by repeated\r\n    working, either with the plough or hand hoes, rendered soft, light,\r\n    and mellow, the whole field is made into hills, each to take up the\r\n    space of three feet, and flattened at the top.\r\n\r\n    In the first rains, which are here called seasons, after the vernal\r\n    equinox, the tobacco plants are carefully drawn while the ground is\r\n    soft; carried to the field where they are to be planted, and one\r\n    dropped upon every hill, which is done by the negro children. The\r\n    most skilful slaves then begin planting them, by making a hole with\r\n    their finger in each hill, inserting the plant with the taproot\r\n    carefully placed straight down, and pressing the earth on each side\r\n    of it. This is continued as long as the ground is wet enough to\r\n    enable the plants sufficiently grown to draw and set; and it\r\n    requires several different seasons, or periods of rain, to enable\r\n    them to complete planting their crop, which operation is frequently\r\n    not finished until July.\r\n\r\n    After the plants have taken root, and begin to grow, the ground is\r\n    carefully weeded and worked, either with hand hoes or the plough,\r\n    according as it will admit. After the plants have considerably\r\n    increased in bulk, and begin to shoot up, the tops are pinched off,\r\n    and only ten, twelve, or sixteen leaves left, according to the\r\n    quality of the tobacco and the soil. The worms, also, are carefully\r\n    picked off and destroyed, of which there are two species that prey\r\n    upon tobacco. One is the ground worm, which cuts it off just beneath\r\n    the surface of the earth; this must be carefully looked for and\r\n    trodden to death; it is of a dark brown color, and short. The other\r\n    is a horn worm, some inches in length, as thick as your little\r\n    finger, of a vivid green color, with a number of pointed\r\n    excrescences or feelers from his head like horns. These devour the\r\n    leaf, and are always upon the plant. As it would be endless labor to\r\n    keep their hands constantly in search of them, it would be almost\r\n    impossible to prevent their eating up more than half the crop had it\r\n    not been discovered that turkeys are particularly dexterous at\r\n    finding them, eat them up voraciously, and prefer them to every\r\n    other food. For this purpose every planter keeps a flock of turkeys,\r\n    which he has driven into the tobacco grounds every day by a little\r\n    negro that can do nothing else; these keep his tobacco more clear\r\n    from horn worms than all the hands he has got could do were they\r\n    employed solely for that end. When the tops are nipped off, a few\r\n    plants are left untouched for seed. On the plants that have been\r\n    topped, young shoots are apt to spring out, which are termed\r\n    suckers, and are carefully and constantly broken off lest they\r\n    should draw too much of the nourishment and substance from the\r\n    leaves of the plant. This operation is also performed from time to\r\n    time, and is called \"suckering tobacco.\" For some time before it is\r\n    ripe, or ready for cutting, the ground is perfectly covered with\r\n    leaves, which have increased to a prodigious size, and then the\r\n    plants are generally about three feet high. When it is ripe, a\r\n    clammy moisture or exudation comes forth upon the leaves, which\r\n    appear, as it were, ready to become spotted, and they are then of a\r\n    great weight and substance. The tobacco is cut when the sun is\r\n    powerful, but not in the morning and evening. The plant, if large,\r\n    is split down the middle, and cut off two or three inches below the\r\n    extremity of the split; it is then turned directly bottom upwards,\r\n    for the sun to kill it more speedily, to enable the laborers to\r\n    carry it out of the field, else the leaves would break off in\r\n    transporting it to the scaffold. The plants are cut only as they\r\n    become ripe, for a field never ripens altogether. There is generally\r\n    a second cutting likewise, for the stalk vegetates and shoots forth\r\n    again, and in good land, with favorable seasons, there is a third\r\n    cutting also procured, notwithstanding acts of the Legislature to\r\n    prevent cutting tobacco even a second time.\r\n\r\n    When the tobacco plants are cut and brought to the scaffolds, which\r\n    are generally erected all around the tobacco houses, they are placed\r\n    with the split across a small oak stick, an inch and better in\r\n    diameter and four feet and a half long, so close as each plant just\r\n    to touch the other without bruising or pressing. These sticks are\r\n    then placed on the scaffolds, with the tobacco thus suspended in the\r\n    middle, to dry or cure, and are called tobacco sticks. As the plants\r\n    advance in curing, the sticks are removed from the scaffolds out of\r\n    doors into the tobacco house, on to other scaffolds erected therein\r\n    in successive regular gradations from the bottom to the top of the\r\n    roof, being placed higher as the tobacco approaches to a perfect\r\n    cure, until the house is all filled and the tobacco quite cured, and\r\n    this cure is frequently promoted by making fires on the floor below.\r\n    When the tobacco house is quite full, and there is still more\r\n    tobacco to bring in, all that is within the house is struck, and\r\n    taken down, and carefully placed in bulks, or regular rows, one upon\r\n    another, and the whole covered with trash tobacco, or straw, to\r\n    preserve it in a proper condition, that is moist, which prevents its\r\n    wasting and crumbling to pieces. But, to enable them to strike the\r\n    cured tobacco, they must wait for what is there called a season,\r\n    that is rainy or moist weather, when the plants will better bear\r\n    handling, for in dry weather the leaves would all crumble to pieces\r\n    in the attempt. By this means a tobacco house may be filled two,\r\n    three, or four times in the year. Every night the negroes are sent\r\n    to the tobacco house to strip, that is to pull off the leaves from\r\n    the stalk, and tie them up in hands or bundles. This is also their\r\n    daily occupation in rainy weather. In stripping, they are careful to\r\n    throw away all the ground leaves and faulty tobacco, binding up none\r\n    but what is merchantable. The hands or bundles thus tied up are also\r\n    laid in what are called a bulk, and covered with the refuse tobacco\r\n    or straw to preserve their moisture. After this, the tobacco is\r\n    carefully packed in hogsheads, and pressed down with a large beam\r\n    laid over it, on the ends of which prodigious weights are suspended,\r\n    the other end being inserted with a mortice in a tree, close to\r\n    which the hogshead is placed. This vast pressure is continued for\r\n    some days, and then the cask is filled up again with tobacco until\r\n    it will contain no more, after which it is headed up and carried to\r\n    the pubic warehouses for inspection. At these warehouses two skilful\r\n    planters constantly attend, and receive a salary from the public for\r\n    that purpose. They are sworn to inspect with honesty, care, and\r\n    impartiality, all the tobacco that comes to the warehouse, and none\r\n    is allowed to be shipped that is not regularly inspected. The head\r\n    of the cask is taken off, and the tobacco is opened by means of\r\n    large, long iron wedges, and great labour, in such places as the\r\n    inspectors direct. After this strict attentive examination, if they\r\n    find it good and merchantable, it is replaced in the cask, weighed\r\n    at the public scales, the weight of the tobacco and of the cask also\r\n    cut in the wood on the cask, stowed away in the public warehouses,\r\n    and a note given to the proprietor, which he disposes of to the\r\n    merchant, and he neither sees nor has any trouble with his tobacco\r\n    more. The weight of each hogshead must be 950 lbs. nett, exclusive\r\n    of the cask--for less a note will not be given. Under the name of a\r\n    crop hogshead, however, the general weight is from 1,000 to 1,200 or\r\n    1,300 lbs. nett, but if the tobacco is found to be totally bad, and\r\n    refused as unmerchantable, the whole is publicly burnt in a place\r\n    set apart for that purpose. However, if it be judged that there is\r\n    some merchantable tobacco in the hogshead, the owner must unpack the\r\n    whole publicly on the spot, for he is not permitted to take any of\r\n    it away again, and must select and separate the good from the bad;\r\n    the last is immediately committed to the flames, and for the first\r\n    he receives a transfer note, specifying the weight, quality, &c.\r\n    This great and very laudable care was taken by the public to\r\n    prevent frauds, which, however, was not always effectual, for, even\r\n    with all these precautions, many acts of iniquity and imposition\r\n    were committed.\r\n\r\nSo little is this crop cultivated in the States north of Maryland,\r\nthat scarcely any notice has been taken of it in the agricultural or\r\nother public journals.\r\n\r\nIn Connecticut, in some few towns of Hartford county, considerable\r\nattention has been directed to it for a number of years past. A ton\r\nand a-half the acre is said to be no uncommon yield. The tobacco is\r\nplanted very thick, two feet and a half each way. The seed came\r\noriginally from Virginia. It is cured in houses, without having been\r\nyellowed in the sun, and without the use of fire. It is said that the\r\nbest Havana cigars (as they are termed) are often manufactured from\r\nmixed Cuba and American tobacco, and sold under that name in\r\nConnecticut.\r\n\r\nIn the Connecticut Valley is produced about 500 tons of tobacco\r\nannually, the average quantity, 1,500 lbs. per acre, value from seven\r\nto ten cents per pound.\r\n\r\n_Culture_.--Seed bed made rich and sown as cabbage early in April as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nLand well ploughed and manured and harrowed as for corn, laid out in\r\nrows three feet apart, and slight hills in the row about two and\r\na-half feet apart; begin to plant about 10th of June, the ground to be\r\nkept clean with hoe and cultivator, and examine the plants and keep\r\nclear of worms.\r\n\r\n\"When in blossom and before seed is formed, the plants must be topped\r\nabout thirty-two inches from the ground, having from sixteen to twenty\r\nleaves on each stalk, after this the suckers are broken off, and the\r\nplants kept clean till cut. When ripe the leaves are spotted, thick,\r\nand will crack when pressed between the fingers and thumb. It is cut\r\nat any time of the day, after the dew is off, left in the row till\r\nwilted, then turned, and if there is a hot sun, it is often turned to\r\nprevent burning; after wilting it is put into small heaps of six or\r\neight plants, then carried to the tobacco house for hanging, usually\r\non poles twelve feet long; hung with twine about forty plants to a\r\npole, twenty on each side, crossing the pole with a hitch knot to the\r\nstump end of the plants; when perfectly cured, which is known by the\r\nstems of the leaves being completely dry, it is then taken in a damp\r\ntime, when the leaves will not crumble, from the poles and placed in\r\nlarge piles, by letting the tops of the plants lap each other, leaving\r\nthe butts out; it remains in these heaps from three to ten days before\r\nit is stripped, depending on the state of weather, but it must not be\r\nallowed to heat. When stripped it is made into small hands, the small\r\nand broken leaves to be kept by themselves; it is then packed in boxes\r\nof about 400 lbs. and marked \"Seed Leaf Tobacco.\"\r\n\r\nOne acre of tobacco will require as much labor as two of corn that\r\nproduce 60 bags to the acre, and requires about the same quantity of\r\nmanure. If the tobacco can be cured without fire heat the quality\r\nwill be improved, and if dried in the open air, should have shades of\r\nboards to keep off rain and excess of sun. The chief market for\r\nConnecticut tobacco is Bremen.\r\n\r\nIn a number of the \"Charleston Southern Planter,\" a remedy is\r\ndescribed for preventing the destruction of plants by the fly. The\r\nwriter says: \"I had a bushel or two of dry ashes put into a large tub,\r\nand added train oil enough (say one gallon of oil to the bushel of\r\nashes) to damp and flavor the ashes completely: this was well stirred\r\nand mixed with the hand, and sown broadcast over certain patches, and\r\nproved thoroughly effectual for several years, while parts left\r\nwithout the remedy were destroyed.\"\r\n\r\nThe best ground for raising the plant, according to Capt. Carver\r\n(\"Treatise on Culture of Tobacco,\" &c.), is a warm rich soil, not\r\nsubject to be overrun with weeds. The soil in which it grows in\r\nVirginia is inclining to sandy, consequently warm and light; the\r\nnearer, therefore, the nature of the land approaches to that, the\r\ngreater probability there is of its flourishing. The situation most\r\npreferable for a plantation is the southern declivity of a hill, or a\r\nspot sheltered from the blighting north winds. But at the same time\r\nthe plants must enjoy a free current of air; for if that be obstructed\r\nthey will not prosper.\r\n\r\nThe different sorts of seed not being distinguishable from each other,\r\nnor the goodness to be ascertained by its appearance, great caution\r\nshould be used in obtaining the seed through some responsible\r\nmercantile house, or individual of character.\r\n\r\nEach capsule contains about a thousand seeds, and the whole produce of\r\na single plant has been estimated at 350,000. The seeds are usually\r\nripe in the month of September, and when perfectly dry may be rubbed\r\nout and preserved in bags till the following season.\r\n\r\nThere is a large quantity of tobacco raised in the southern part of\r\nIndiana annually, equal in quality to the tobacco raised in Kentucky.\r\nIn some counties the article is extensively cultivated, and generally\r\npays the producer a handsome profit on the labor bestowed on it. The\r\ncultivation of it is becoming more extensive every year. Nearly all\r\nthis crop is taken to Louisville for sale, very little being shipped\r\nsouth on account of the producer.\r\n\r\nHeretofore, owing to the heaviness of tobacco and bad roads, the\r\nproducer has encountered great difficulties in getting his crop to\r\nmarket. The hauling of a few hogsheads fifty or sixty miles, or even\r\nforty, is no light job, even over good roads. Hence, tobacco has not\r\nbeen as extensively cultivated as it would have been under different\r\ncircumstances. But, with the facilities afforded by the railroads in\r\ncarrying their crops to market, I doubt not the farmers of the\r\ninterior will more generally engage in the cultivation of tobacco, and\r\nthose who have been in the habit of raising small crops will extend\r\ntheir operations.\r\n\r\nIn Maryland the seed is sown in beds of fine mould, and the plants\r\narising therefrom are transplanted in the beginning of May. They are\r\nset at the distance of three or four feet apart, and are hilled, and\r\nkept continually free from weeds. When as many leaves have shot out as\r\nthe soil will nourish to advantage, the top of the plant is broken\r\noff, which of course prevents its growing higher. It is carefully kept\r\nclear from worms, and the suckers which put out between the leaves are\r\ntaken off at proper times, till the plant arrives at perfection, which\r\nis in August. When the leaves turn of a brownish color, and begin to\r\nbe spotted, the plants are cut down and hung up to dry, after having\r\nsweated in heaps one night. When the leaves can be handled without\r\ncrumbling, which is always in moist weather, they are stripped from\r\nthe stalks, tied up in bundles, and packed for exportation in\r\nhogsheads. No suckers nor ground leaves are allowed to be\r\nmerchantable. An industrious person may manage 6,000 plants of\r\ntobacco, which will yield 1,000 lbs. of dried leaves, and also four\r\nacres of Indian corn.\r\n\r\nMiller, an American author, thus describes the mode of culture:--\r\n\r\n    When a regular plantation of tobacco is intended, the beds being\r\n    prepared and well turned up with the hoe, the seed, on account of\r\n    its smallness and to prevent the ravages of ants, is mixed with\r\n    ashes and sown upon them, a little before the rainy season. The beds\r\n    are raked, or trampled with the foot, to make the seed take the\r\n    sooner. The plants appear in two or three weeks. As soon as they\r\n    have acquired four leaves, the strongest are carefully drawn up and\r\n    planted in the field by a line, at a distance of about three feet\r\n    from each other. If no rain fall, they should be watered two or\r\n    three times. Every morning and evening the plants must he looked\r\n    over in order to destroy a worm which sometimes invades the bud.\r\n    When they are about four or five inches high, they are to be cleaned\r\n    from weeds and moulded up. As soon as they have eight or nine\r\n    leaves, and are ready to put forth a stalk, the top is nipped off in\r\n    order to make the leaves longer and thicker. After this the buds\r\n    which sprout at the joints of the leaves are also plucked off, and\r\n    not a day is suffered to pass without examining the leaves to\r\n    destroy the large caterpillar, which is often most destructive to\r\n    them. When they are fit for cutting, which is known by the\r\n    brittleness of the leaves, they are cut off with a knife close to\r\n    the ground, and, after lying some time, are carried to the\r\n    drying-shed or house, where the plants are hung up by pairs upon\r\n    lines, leaving a space between, that they may not touch one another.\r\n    When perfectly dry, the leaves are stripped from the stalks and made\r\n    into small bundles, tied with one of the leaves. These bundles are\r\n    laid in heaps and covered with blankets; care is taken not to\r\n    overheat them, for which reason the heaps are laid open to the air\r\n    from time to time, and spread abroad. This operation is repeated\r\n    till no more heat is perceived in the heaps, and the tobacco is then\r\n    ready for packing and shipping.\r\n\r\nI have been favored by Mr. J. M. Hernandez, a Cuba planter, with some\r\nvaluable instructions for the cultivation of Cuba tobacco, which I\r\nsubjoin. These remarks apply principally to America, but most of the\r\nadvice and information will be found generally applicable to other\r\nlocalities:--\r\n\r\n    The first thing to be considered in this, as in every other culture,\r\n    is the soil, which for this kind of tobacco (_N. repanda_) ought to\r\n    be a rich, sandy, loam, neither too high nor too low--that is,\r\n    ground capable of retaining moisture, the more level the better,\r\n    and, if possible, well protected by margins. The next should be the\r\n    selection of a spot of ground to make the necessary beds. It would\r\n    be preferable to make those on land newly cleared, or, at all\r\n    events, when the land has not been seeded with grass; for grass\r\n    seeds springing up together with the tobacco would injure it\r\n    materially, as the grass cannot be removed without disturbing the\r\n    tobacco plants. In preparing the ground for the nurseries, break it\r\n    up properly, grub up all the small stumps, dig out the roots, and\r\n    carefully remove them with the hand. This being done, make the beds\r\n    from three to four inches high, of a reasonable length, and from\r\n    three to three and a-half feet broad, so as to enable the hand, at\r\n    arm's length, to weed out the tender young plants with the fingers\r\n    from both sides of the bed, and keep them perfectly clean.\r\n\r\n    The months of December and January are the most proper for sowing\r\n    the seed in Florida. Some persons speak of planting it as early as\r\n    the month of November, I am, however, of opinion, that about the\r\n    latter part of December is the best time to sow tobacco seed; any\r\n    sooner would expose the plants to suffer from the inclemency of the\r\n    most severe part of the winter season. Before the seed is sown take\r\n    some dry trash and burn it off upon the nursery beds, to destroy\r\n    insects and grass seeds; then take one ounce of tobacco seed and mix\r\n    it with about a quart of dry ashes, so as to separate the seed as\r\n    much; as possible, and sow it broadcast. After the seed has been\r\n    thus sown, the surface of the bed ought to be raked over slightly,\r\n    and trodden upon by the foot, carrying the weight of the body with\r\n    it, that the ground may at once adhere closely to the seed, and then\r\n    water it. Should the nursery-beds apparently become dry from\r\n    blighting winds or other causes, watering will be absolutely\r\n    necessary, for the ground ought to be kept in a moist state from the\r\n    time the seed is planted until the young plants are large enough to\r\n    be set out.\r\n\r\n    The nurseries being made, proceed to prepare the land where the\r\n    tobacco is to be set out. If the land is newly cleared--and new land\r\n    is probably more favorable to the production of this plant than it\r\n    is to that of any other, both as respects quality and\r\n    quantity--remove as many of the stumps and roots as possible, and\r\n    dig up the ground in such a manner as to render the surface\r\n    perfectly loose; then level the ground, and in this state leave it\r\n    until the nursery plants have acquired about one-half the growth\r\n    necessary to admit of their being set out; then break up the ground\r\n    a second time in the same manner as at first, as in this way all the\r\n    small fibres of roots and their rooted parts will be more or less\r\n    separated, and thus obviate much of that degree of sponginess so\r\n    common to new land, and which is in a great measure the cause of new\r\n    land seldom producing well the first year, as the soil does not lay\r\n    close enough to the roots of the plants growing in it, so that a\r\n    shower of rain produces no other effect than that of removing the\r\n    earth still more from them.\r\n\r\n    The ground having been prepared and properly levelled off, and the\r\n    plants, sufficiently grown to be taken up--say of the size of good\r\n    cabbage plants--take advantage of the first wet or cloudy weather to\r\n    commence setting them out. This should be done with great care, and\r\n    the plants put single at equal distances, that is, about three feet\r\n    north and south, and two and a-half, or two and three-fourths feet\r\n    east and west. They are placed thus close to each other to prevent\r\n    the leaves growing too large. The direction of the rows, however,\r\n    should alter according to the situation of the land; where it has\r\n    any inclination, the widest space should run across it, as the bed\r\n    will have to be made so as to prevent the soil from being washed\r\n    from the roots by rain when bedded; but where the land is rather\r\n    level, the three feet rows should be north and south, so as to give\r\n    to the plants a more full effect on them by passing across the beds,\r\n    than by crossing them in an oblique direction. To set the plants out\r\n    regularly, take a task line of 105 feet in length, with a pointed\r\n    stick three feet long attached to each end of it, then insert a\r\n    small piece of rag or something else through the line at the\r\n    distance of two feet and three-fourths from each other; place it\r\n    north and south (or as the land may require), at full length, and\r\n    then set a plant at every division, carefully keeping the bud of the\r\n    plant above the surface of the ground. Then remove the line three\r\n    feet from the first row, and so on, until the planting is completed.\r\n    Care ought to be taken to prevent the stretching of the line from\r\n    misplacing the plants. In this way the plants can be easily set out,\r\n    and a proper direction given to them both ways. In taking the plants\r\n    up from the nursery, the ground should be first loosened with a flat\r\n    piece of wood or iron, about an inch broad; then carefully holding\r\n    the leaves close towards each other between the fingers, draw them\r\n    up, and place them in a basket or some other convenient thing to\r\n    receive them for planting. After taking up those that can be planted\r\n    during the day, water the nursery that the earth may again adhere to\r\n    the remaining ones. The evening is the best time for setting out the\r\n    plants, but where a large field has to be cultivated it will be well\r\n    to plant both morning and evening. The plants set out in the\r\n    morning, unless in rainy or cloudy weather, should be covered\r\n    immediately, and the same should be done with those planted the\r\n    evening previous, should the day open with a clear sunshine,--the\r\n    palmetto leaf answers the purpose very well. There should be water\r\n    convenient to the plants, so as to have them watered morning and\r\n    evening, but more particularly in the evening, until they have taken\r\n    root. They should also be closely examined when watered, so as to\r\n    replace such plants as happen to die, that the ground may be\r\n    properly occupied, and that all the plants may open as nearly\r\n    together as possible.\r\n\r\n    From the time the plants are set out, the earth around them should\r\n    be occasionally stirred, both with the hand and hoe. At first hoe\r\n    flat, but as soon as the leaves assume a growing disposition, begin\r\n    gradually to draw a slight heel towards the plant. The plants must\r\n    be closely examined, even while in the nursery, to destroy the\r\n    numerous worms that feed upon them--some, by cutting the stalk and\r\n    gnawing the leaves when first set out; these resemble the grub-worm,\r\n    and are to be found near the injured plant, under ground; others,\r\n    which come from the eggs deposited on the plant by the butterfly,\r\n    and feed on the leaf, grow to a very large size, and look very ugly,\r\n    and are commonly called the tobacco-worm. There is also a small worm\r\n    which attacks the bud of the plant, and which is sure destruction to\r\n    its further growth; and some again, though less destructive, are to\r\n    be seen within the two coats of the leaf, feeding as it were on its\r\n    juices alone. The worming should be strictly attended to every\r\n    morning and evening, until the plants are pretty well grown, when\r\n    every other day will be sufficient. The most proper persons for\r\n    worming are either boys or girls from ten to fourteen years of age.\r\n    They should be made to come to the tobacco ground early in the\r\n    morning, and be led by inducements, such as giving a trifling reward\r\n    to those who will bring the most worms, to clear it thoroughly.\r\n    Grown persons would find it rather too tedious to stoop to examine\r\n    the under part of every leaf, and seek the worm under ground: nor\r\n    would they be so much alive to the value of a spoonful of sugar, or\r\n    other light reward. Beside, where the former would make the search a\r\n    matter of profit and pleasure, it would to the latter prove only a\r\n    tedious and irksome occupation. Here I will observe, that it is for\r\n    similar reasons that the culture of the Cuba tobacco plant more\r\n    properly belongs to a white population, for there are few plants\r\n    requiring more attention and tender treatment than it does. Indeed\r\n    it will present a sorry appearance, unless the eye of its legitimate\r\n    proprietor is constantly watching over it.\r\n\r\n    When the plants have acquired from twelve to fourteen good leaves,\r\n    and are about knee high, it may be well to begin to top them, by\r\n    nipping off the bud with the aid of the finger and thumb nail\r\n    (washing the hands after this in water is necessary, as the acid\r\n    juices of the plants, otherwise, soon produce a soreness on the\r\n    fingers), taking care not to destroy the small leaves immediately\r\n    near the bud: for if the land is good and the season favorable,\r\n    those very small top leaves will in a short time be nearly as large,\r\n    and ripen quite as soon as the lower ones, whereby two or more\r\n    leaves may be saved; thus obtaining from 16 to 18 leaves, in the\r\n    place of 12 or 14, which is the general average. As the topping of\r\n    the tobacco plant is all essential in order to promote the growth,\r\n    and to equalise the ripening of the leaves, I would observe that\r\n    this operation should at all events commence the instant that the\r\n    bud of the plant shows a disposition to go to seed, and be\r\n    immediately followed by removing the suckers, which it will now put\r\n    out at every leaf. Indeed, the suckers should be removed from the\r\n    plant as often as they appear. The tobacco plant ought never to be\r\n    cut before it comes to full maturity, which is known by the leaves\r\n    becoming mottled, coarse, and of a thick texture, and gummy to the\r\n    touch, at which time the end of the leaf, by being doubled, will\r\n    break short, which it will not do to the same extent when green. It\r\n    ought not to be out in wet weather, when the leaves lose their\r\n    natural gummy substance, so necessary to be preserved. About this\r\n    period, the cultivator is apt to be rendered anxious by the fear of\r\n    allowing the plants to remain in the field longer than necessary;\r\n    until experience removes those apprehensions, he should be on his\r\n    guard, however, not to destroy the quality of his tobacco, by\r\n    cutting it too soon. When the cutting is to commence, there should\r\n    be procured a quantity of forked stakes, set upright, with a pole or\r\n    rider setting on each fork ready to support the tobacco, and to keep\r\n    it from the ground. The plant is then cut obliquely, even with the\r\n    surface of the ground, and the person thus employed should strike\r\n    the lower end of the stalk, two or three times with the blunt side\r\n    of his knife, so as to cause as much of the sand or soil to fall\r\n    from it as possible, then tying two stalks together, they are gently\r\n    placed across the riders or poles prepared to receive them. In this\r\n    state they are allowed to remain in the sun or open air until the\r\n    leaves have somewhat withered, whereby they will not be liable to\r\n    the injury which they would otherwise receive, if they came suddenly\r\n    in contact with other bodies when fresh cut. Then place as many\r\n    plants on each pole or rider as may be conveniently carried, and\r\n    take them in the drying house, where the tobacco is strung off upon\r\n    the frames prepared for it, leaving a small space between the two\r\n    plants, that air may circulate freely among them, and promote their\r\n    drying. As the drying advances, the stalks are brought closer to\r\n    each other, so as to make room for those which yet remain to be\r\n    housed.\r\n\r\n    In drying the tobacco, all damp air should be excluded, nor ought\r\n    the drying of it to be precipitated by the admission of high drying\r\n    winds. The process is to be promoted in the most moderate manner,\r\n    except in the rainy season, when the sooner the drying is effected\r\n    the better; for it is a plant easily affected by the changes of the\r\n    weather, after the drying commences. It is then liable to mildew in\r\n    damp weather, which is when the leaf changes from its original color\r\n    to a pale yellow cast, and from this, by parts, to an even brown.\r\n    When the middle stem is perfectly dry, it can be taken down, and the\r\n    leaves stripped from the stalk and put in bulk to sweat, that is, to\r\n    make tobacco of them; for before this process, when a concentration\r\n    of its better qualities takes place, the leaves are always liable to\r\n    be affected by the weather, and cannot well be considered as being\r\n    anything else than common dry leaves, partaking of the nature of\r\n    tobacco, but not actually tobacco. The leaves are to be stripped\r\n    from the stalks in damp or cloudy weather, when they are more easily\r\n    handled, and the separation of the different qualities rendered also\r\n    more easy. The good leaves are at this time kept by themselves as\r\n    wrappers, or caps, and the most defective ones for fillings, or\r\n    _tripa_. When the tobacco is put in _bulk_, the stem of the leaves\r\n    should all be kept in one direction, to facilitate the tying of them\r\n    in hanks: afterwards make the bulk two of three feet high, and of a\r\n    proportionate circumference. To guard against the leaves becoming\r\n    over-heated, and to equalise the fermentation or sweating, after the\r\n    first twenty-four hours, place the outside leaves in the centre, and\r\n    those of the centre to the outside of the _bulk_. By doing this once\r\n    or twice, and taking care to cover the _bulk_ either with sheets or\r\n    blankets, so as to exclude all air from it, and leaving it in this\r\n    state for about forty days, it acquires an odor strong enough to\r\n    produce sneezing, and the other qualities of cured tobacco. The\r\n    process of curing may then be considered as completed. Then take\r\n    some of the most injured leaves, but of the best quality, and in\r\n    proportion to the quantity of tobacco made, and place them in clean\r\n    water, there let them remain until they rot, which they will do in\r\n    about eight days; then break open your _bulks_, spread the tobacco\r\n    with their stems in one direction, and damp them with this water in\r\n    a gentle manner, that it may not soak through the leaf, for in this\r\n    case the leaf would rot. Sponge is used in Cuba for this operation.\r\n    Then tie them in hanks of from, twenty-five to thirty leaves; this\r\n    being done, spread the hanks in the tobacco house for about twelve\r\n    hours, to air them, that the dampness may be removed, and afterwards\r\n    pack them in casks or barrels, and head them tight, until you wish\r\n    to manufacture them.\r\n\r\n    The object of damping the tobacco with this water, is to give it\r\n    elasticity, to promote its burning free, to increase its fragrance;\r\n    to give it an aromatic smell, and to keep it always soft. This is\r\n    the great secret of curing tobacco for cigars properly, and for\r\n    which we are indebted to the people of Cuba, who certainly\r\n    understand the mode of curing this kind of tobacco better than other\r\n    people. It is to them a source of great wealth, and may be made\r\n    equally so to others. We have here three cuttings from the original\r\n    plants; the last cutting will be of rather a weak quality, but\r\n    which, nevertheless, will be agreeable to those who confine their\r\n    smoking to weak tobacco.\r\n\r\n    In ratooning the plant, only one sprout ought to be allowed to grow,\r\n    and this from those most deeply rooted; all other sprouts ought to\r\n    be destroyed.\r\n\r\n    The houses necessary for the curing of tobacco ought to be roomy,\r\n    with a passage way running through the centre, from one extremity of\r\n    the building to the other, and pierced on both sides with a\r\n    sufficient number of doors and windows to make them perfectly airy.\r\n\r\n    In addition to what I have said respecting the mode of cultivating\r\n    and treating the tobacco plant, I have further to state, that when\r\n    once the plant is allowed to be checked in its growth, it never\r\n    again recovers it. That in promoting the drying of the leaf, fire\r\n    should not be resorted to, because the smoke would impart to it a\r\n    flavor that would injure that of the tobacco itself.\r\n\r\n    In order to obtain vigorous plants, the seed ought to be procured\r\n    from the original stalk, and not from the ratoons, by allowing some\r\n    of them to go to seed for that express purpose. In Cuba, the seed is\r\n    most generally saved from the ratoon plants, but we should consider\r\n    that that climate and soil are probably more favorable to the\r\n    production of the plant than America, and consequently we ought to\r\n    confide in the best seed, which is had from the original stalk.\r\n\r\n    All plants have their peculiar empire: nevertheless, we should not\r\n    be deterred from planting Cuba tobacco here; for even if we should\r\n    be compelled to import the seed every third year, which would be as\r\n    often as necessary, it would still prove a profitable culture.\r\n    Taking 600 lbs., which is the average product per acre, it would\r\n    yield, if well cured, at 50 cents, per lb., 300 dollars in the leaf.\r\n\r\n    The following exhibits the profit to be derived from it when\r\n    manufactured into cigars:--\r\n\r\n                                                                 Dls.    Dls.\r\n  Six hundred pounds, allowing eight pounds to the 1.000, would\r\n  produce 75,000 cigars, which at ten dollars per thousand               750.00\r\n  Cost of the leaf                                               300.00\r\n  Worth of manufacture, at two dollars fifty cents per thousand  187.50  487.50\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                    --------\r\n  Difference in favor of manufacturer                                    262.50\r\n\r\n    This amount being the profits of the manufacturer alone, the profit\r\n    to him who could combine both pursuits would be more than doubled.\r\n\r\n    As to the quantity of land which can be cultivated to the hand,\r\n    there is some difference in the practice of planters; however, I\r\n    think that I am within the usual calculation in saying, that an acre\r\n    and a half would not exceed the quantity that an able hand can\r\n    easily cultivate and manage properly.\r\n\r\n\"With reference to the cultivation of Spanish tobacco from the seed,\r\nthe following remarks are also made by a gentleman residing in\r\nMaryland:--\r\n\r\n    My experience for some years in the cultivation and manufacture of\r\n    Spanish tobacco into cigars, convinces me that the first-rate\r\n    variety of Spanish tobacco--that is, the most odorous and fine--will\r\n    bear reproduction in our climate twice, without much deterioration;\r\n    by that time it becomes acidulated and worthless as Spanish tobacco.\r\n    For seven years I have imported annually first seed from Cuba, but\r\n    have occasionally made experiments with reproduced seed, and I have\r\n    arrived at the conclusion above stated. I have obtained, annually, a\r\n    cigar maker from Baltimore, who has made for me on my farm, and from\r\n    Spanish tobacco. These produced about the average of 70,000 cigars,\r\n    per year; they have been sold in Baltimore and Philadelphia for five\r\n    dollars the half box, that is ten dollars the thousand. The tobacco\r\n    has been uniformly admired, but in former years they have been very\r\n    badly made; for the last two years, (writing in 1843,) my crops were\r\n    destroyed by the unfavorable weather. This growth and manufacture do\r\n    not interfere with my cultivation of other crops; in fact they are\r\n    wholly unconnected with the other operations of the farmer.\" He\r\n    mentions having obtained a premium from an agricultural society, for\r\n    having produced on one and a half acres, growth and manufacture\r\n    included, of Spanish tobacco 504 dollars net profit.\r\n\r\nThe following letter from Mr. Clarke, to the Hon. H. L. Ellsworth,\r\nWashington, speaks favorably of a new variety of tobacco:--\r\n\r\n    Willow Grove, Orange County, Virginia,\r\n\r\n    Feb. 13, 1844.\r\n\r\n    Dear Sir,--Agreeably to my promise I enclose you the Californian\r\n    tobacco seed. It grew from the small parcel given to me by Mr. Wm.\r\n    Smith, in your office in March last. On getting home, although late,\r\n    I prepared a bed, and sowed the small parcel, the first week in\r\n    April, and not having seed enough to finish the bed, sowed the\r\n    balance of the bed in Oronoko tobacco seed, and to my astonishment\r\n    the Californian plants were soon ready to set out, as soon as the\r\n    other kinds of tobacco sown in the month of January; and the Oronoko\r\n    seed, that was sown with the Californian, did not arrive to\r\n    sufficient size until it was too late to set out. The Californian\r\n    tobacco, if it continues to ripen and grow for the time to come, as\r\n    it did for me on the first trial, must come into general use--first,\r\n    because the plants are much earlier in the spring (say ten days at\r\n    least), than any kind we have; secondly, when transplanted, the\r\n    growth is remarkably quick, matures and ripens at least from ten to\r\n    fifteen days earlier than any kind of tobacco we have in use amongst\r\n    us. It is a large broad, silky leaf, of fine texture, and of a\r\n    beautiful color, and some plants grow as large as seven feet across,\r\n    from point to point; upon the whole, I consider it a valuable\r\n    acquisition to the planting community.\r\n\r\nTobacco is one of the chief staples of Cuba. There are many qualities,\r\nbut it is usually classed into two kinds. That which is raised on the\r\nwestern end of the island and is unequalled for smoking, is called\r\n\"Vuelta abajo.\" That which is raised east of Havana, is called \"Vuelta\r\narriba,\" and is far inferior to the former.\r\n\r\nThe best Havana tobacco farms are confined to a very narrow area on\r\nthe south west part of Cuba. This district, twenty-seven leagues long\r\nand only seven broad, is bounded on the north by mountains, on the\r\nsouth and west by the ocean, whilst eastward, though there is no\r\nnatural limit, the tobacco sensibly degenerates in quality. A light\r\nsandy soil and rather low situation suit the best.\r\n\r\nThe \"Vuelta abajo\" is usually divided into five classes.\r\n\r\n  Calidad or Libra.\r\n  Ynjuriado Principal or Firsts.\r\n  Segundas or Seconds.\r\n  Terceiras or Thirds.\r\n  Cuartas or Fourths.\r\n\r\nCalidad is the best tobacco, selected for its good color, flavor,\r\nelasticity and entireness of the leaves. The bales contain sixty hands\r\nof four gabillas, or fingers of twenty-five leaves each, and are\r\nmarked L.60. Ynjuriado Principal has less flavor, and is usually of a\r\nlighter color. The leaves should be whole and somewhat elastic. The\r\nbales contain eighty hands of four gabillas, or thirty leaves each,\r\nand are marked B. 80. Segundas is the most inferior class of wrapper.\r\nThere are many good leaves in it, but the hands are usually made up of\r\nthose which are stained, have a bad color, or have been slightly\r\ntouched by the worm. The bales contain eighty hands of four gabillas\r\nof thirty-six to forty leaves each, and are marked Y. 2a. 80.\r\n\r\nTerceiras is the best tilling, and much wrapper can usually be\r\nselected from it when new. The bales contain eighty hands of four\r\ngabillas of more than forty leaves each, and are marked 3a. 80.\r\n\r\nCuartas is the most inferior class, fit only for filling. The bales\r\ncontain eighty hands of four gabillas of no determined number of\r\nleaves, and are marked 4a. 80.\r\n\r\nThe Vuelta arriba tobacco is prepared in a similar manner, but neither\r\nits color or flavor is good, and it does not burn well.\r\n\r\nThe crop is gathered in the spring, and usually begins to appear at\r\nmarket in July. Good tobacco should be aromatic, of a rich brown\r\ncolor, without stains, and the leaf thin and elastic. It should burn\r\nwell and the taste should be neither bitter nor biting. The best is\r\ngrown on the margins of rivers which are periodically overflowed, and\r\nis called \"De rio.\" It is distinguished from other tobacco by a fine\r\nsand, which is found in the creases of the leaves.\r\n\r\nThe tobacco plantations in Cuba increased in number from 5,534 in\r\n1827, to 9,102 in 1846. The production of tobacco has nearly doubled\r\nin the province, of which St. Jago is the port, in the last ten years.\r\n\r\nThe following figures show the exports from the Havana:--\r\n\r\n                    Leaf tobacco.                Cigars.\r\n  1840           1,031,136 lbs.           147,818 thousand.\r\n  1841           1,460,302   \"            161,928       \"\r\n  1842           1,053,161   \"            135,127       \"\r\n  1843           2,125,805   \"            153,227       \"\r\n  1844           1,197,136   \"            147,825       \"\r\n  1845           1,621,889   \"            120,352       \"\r\n  1846           4,066,262   \"            158,841       \"\r\n  1847           1,936,829   \"          1,982,267       \"\r\n  1848           1,350,815   \"            150,729       \"\r\n  1849           1,158,265   \"            111,572       \"\r\n\r\nThe class of tobacco shipped at the port of Havana, is not the same as\r\nthat gathered in the districts from which the manufacturers of cigars\r\nthere receive their supplies--it would cost too dear. However, it is\r\nnot a rare occurrence to find among a number of bales a few of a\r\nquality about equal to that employed there, and this happens in years\r\nwhen the crop has been very abundant, as in 1846 and 1848. The various\r\nclasses are paid in proportion to the capa, or outside leaves, which\r\nare found in an assortment; the three first classes are employed as\r\ncovers, and often, if the tobacco is new, they may be found in the\r\nfourth and even in the fifth. In parcels well assorted, one-fourth is\r\ncomposed of capa--say, first, second, and third, and the rest is\r\ncomposed of tripa, or interior of the cigar. In the first-named, there\r\ngenerally comes more of the _capa_ than is necessary to use; the\r\nremaining bales, which contain the inferior class, are fit only for\r\nfillings.\r\n\r\nThe following is an analysis of the ashes of Havana tobacco:--\r\n\r\n  Salts of potash             24.30\r\n  Salts of lime and magnesia  67.40\r\n  Silica                       8.30\r\n                              -----\r\n                             100.00\r\n\r\n\r\n  Hayti exported in 1836    1,222,716 lbs.\r\n  Porto Rico, in 1839          43,203 cwt.\r\n\r\nThe French have been so successful in cultivating tobacco, in their\r\npossessions in Northern Africa, that they hope soon to be independent\r\nof the foreign grown article. The mode of preparing it, however, is\r\nnot very well understood by the colonists. In 1851, the number of\r\nplanters in Algeria was only 137, whereas in 1852, it was 1,073. The\r\nnumber of hectares under culture with the tobacco plant was 446 in\r\n1851, and 1,095 in 1852. The total of the present year's crop is\r\nestimated at 1,780,000 kilogrammes, of which 700,000 kilogrammes have\r\nbeen grown by the natives, and the rest by Europeans.\r\n\r\nIn the province of Algiers alone, the quantity of tobacco sold will\r\namount to 550,000 kilogrammes, which is nearly three times as much as\r\nin 1851, and an equal progression has taken place in the provinces of\r\nOran, and Constantina.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of tobacco in Algeria has proved most successful; in\r\n1851, only 264,912 kilogrammes were produced; in 1852, the quantity\r\nhad risen to 735,199 kilogrammes. There are two crops in the year, the\r\nfirst being the best, but even this is capable of almost indefinite\r\naugmentation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTURE OF TOBACCO IN THE EAST.\r\n\r\nHaving touched upon the practice of culture in the western world, we\r\nwill now bend our steps towards the east, and it may be curious to\r\nnotice the method pursued in cultivating and curing the celebrated\r\nShiraz tobacco of Persia (_Nicotiana Persica_), which is so much\r\nesteemed for the delicacy of its flavor, and its aromatic quality. It\r\nis thus described by an intelligent traveller. The culture of the\r\nplant, it will be seen, is nearly the same; it is only the preparation\r\nof the tobacco that forms the difference:--\r\n\r\n    In December the seed is sown in a dark soil, which, has been\r\n    slightly manured (red clayey soils will not do). To protect the\r\n    seed, and to keep it warm, the ground is covered with light, thorny\r\n    bushes, which are removed when the plants are three or four inches\r\n    high; and during this period, the plants are watered every four or\r\n    five days, only however in the event of sufficient rain to keep the\r\n    soil well moistened not falling. The ground must be kept wet until\r\n    the plants are six to eight inches high, when they are transplanted\r\n    into a well moistened soil, which has been made into trenches for\r\n    them; the plants being put on the top of the ridges ten or twelve\r\n    inches apart, while the trenched plots are made, so as to retain the\r\n    water given. The day they are transplanted, water must be given to\r\n    them, and also every five or six days subsequently, unless rain\r\n    enough falls to render this unnecessary. When the plants have become\r\n    from thirty to forty inches high, the leaves will be from three to\r\n    fifteen inches long. At this period, or when the flowers are\r\n    forming, all the flower capsules are pinched or twisted off. After\r\n    this operation and watering being continued, the leaves increase in\r\n    size and thickness until the month of August or September, when\r\n    each plant is cut off close to the root, and again stuck firmly into\r\n    the ground. At this season of the year, heavy dews fall during the\r\n    night; when exposed to these the color of the leaves change from\r\n    green to the desired yellow. During this stage, of course no water\r\n    is given to the soil. When the leaves are sufficiently yellow, the\r\n    plants are taken from the earth early in the morning, and while they\r\n    are yet wet from the dew, are heaped on each other in a high shed,\r\n    the walls of which are made with light thorny bushes, where they are\r\n    freely exposed to the wind. While there, and generally in four or\r\n    five days, those leaves which are still green become of the desired\r\n    pale yellow color. The stalks and centre stem of each leaf are now\r\n    removed, and thrown away, the leaves are heaped together in the\r\n    drying house for three or four days more, when they are in a fit\r\n    state for packing. For this operation the leaves are carefully\r\n    spread on each other and formed into sorts of cakes, the\r\n    circumference from four to five feet, and three to four inches\r\n    thick, great care being taken not to break or injure the leaves.\r\n\r\n    Bags made of strong cloth, but thin and very open at the sides, are\r\n    filled with these cakes, and pressed very strongly down on each\r\n    other; the leaves would be broken if this were not attended to. When\r\n    the bags are filled, they are placed separately in a drying house,\r\n    and turned daily. If the leaves were so dry that there would be a\r\n    risk of their breaking during the operation of packing, a very\r\n    slight sprinkling of water is given them to enable them to withstand\r\n    it without injury. The leaf is valued for being thick, tough, and of\r\n    a uniform light yellow color, and of an agreeable aromatic smell.\r\n\r\nIn India, the Surat, Bilsah, and Sandoway (Arracan) varieties of\r\ntobacco are the most celebrated. The two first are found to be good\r\nfor cultivation in the district about Calcutta, but the Cabool is\r\nstill more to be preferred. Tobacco requires in the East, for its\r\ngrowth, a soil as fertile and as well manured as for the production of\r\nthe poppy or opium. It is, therefore, often planted in the spaces\r\nenriched by animal and vegetable exuviæ, among the huts of the\r\nnatives. I have tried seed in different soils, says Capt. C.\r\nCowles,--namely a light garden mould with a large portion of old house\r\nrubbish, dug to a good depth, which had a top dressing of the\r\nsweepings of the farm-yard and cow-houses; a rather heavy loam, highly\r\nmanured with burnt and decayed vegetables, and old cow dung; the third\r\nwas a patch of ground, which was originally an unwholesome swamp, from\r\nbeing eighteen inches to two feet, lower than the surrounding land;\r\nthe soil appeared to be a hard sterile clay, and covered with long\r\ncoarse grass and rushes. As there was a tank near it, I cut away one\r\nside of it, and threw the soil over the ground, bringing it rather\r\nabove the level. Such was its appearance, (a hard compost marly clay,)\r\nthat I expected no other good from it than that of raising the land so\r\nas to throw the water off; contrary, however, to my expectations, it\r\nproduced a much finer crop of tobacco than either of the other soils,\r\nand with somewhat less manure. The agricultural process is limited to\r\nsome practical laws founded on experience, and these are subject to\r\ntwo principal agents; viz., the soil and climate. With respect to the\r\nformer, it is the practice amongst the growers in tobacco countries,\r\nsuch as Cuba, the States of Virginia, North and South Carolina, and\r\nthe Philippine Islands, to select a high and dry piece of land, of a\r\nsiliceous nature, and combined with iron, if possible; and with\r\nrespect to the latter, there are seasons of the year too well known\r\nto the planters to need any explanation. The only difference (if there\r\nis any) depends on the geographical situation of the place, with\r\nrespect to its temperature, or in the backwardness or advancement of\r\nseasons, and even on the duration of the same--in which circumstances\r\nthe planter takes advantage of the one for the other.\r\n\r\nThe influence of a burning climate may be modified by choosing the\r\ncoolest month of the year, whereas the soil cannot be altered without\r\nincurring great expense. I have seen tobacco lose its natural quality\r\nand degenerate by transplanting from one soil to another, although of\r\nthe same temperature, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nMr. Piddington has analysed several Indian soils, distinguished for\r\nthe production of superior tobacco. These are the table soils from\r\nArracan, (Sandoway,) a soil from Singour, in Burdwan, near\r\nChandernagore, the tobacco of which, though of the same species as\r\nthat of the surrounding country, sells at the price of the Arracan\r\nsort; and the soil of the best Bengal tobacco, which is grown at, and\r\nabout Hingalee, in the Kishnagur district.\r\n\r\nThe best tobacco soils of Cuba and Manila, are for the most part red\r\nsoils. Now, the red and reddish soils contain most of their iron in\r\nthe state of peroxide, or the reddish brown oxide of iron; while the\r\nlighter grey soils contain it only in the state of protoxide, or the\r\nblack oxide of iron. Mr. Piddington believes the quality of the\r\ntobacco to depend mainly on the state and quantity of the iron of the\r\nsoil, while it is indifferent about the lime, which is so essential to\r\ncotton. None of the tobacco soils contain any lime. Their analysis\r\nshow them to contain:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Arracan soil.   Singour soil.  Hingalee soil.\r\n  Oxide or iron, (peroxide)      15,65           10,60           6,00\r\n  Water and saline matter         1,10              75           1,50\r\n  Vegetable matter and fibre      3,75            1,10             75\r\n  Silex                          76,90           80,65          87,25\r\n  Alumina                         2,00            4,50           1,50\r\n                                -------         -------        -------\r\n                                 99,40           97,60          97,00\r\n  Water and loss                    60            2,40           3,00\r\n                                -------         -------        -------\r\n                                   100             100            100\r\n\r\nFrom which it will be seen that the best tobacco soil hitherto found\r\nin India contains about sixteen per cent., or nearly one-sixth, of\r\niron, which is mostly in a state of peroxide; and that the inferior\r\nsort of tobacco grows in a soil containing only six per cent., or\r\none-sixteenth of iron, which is, moreover, mostly in the state of\r\nprotoxide, or black oxide. Mr. Piddington thought it worth examining\r\nwhat the quantity of iron in the different sorts of tobacco would be,\r\nand found that while the ashes of one ounce, or 480 grains of Havana\r\nand Sandoway cheroots gave exactly 1.94 grains, or 0.40 per cent., of\r\nperoxide of iron the ashes of the same quantity of the Hingalee, or\r\nbest Bengal tobacco, only gave 1.50 grains, or 0.32 per cent.; and it\r\nappears to exist in the first two in a state of peroxide, and in the\r\nlast as a protoxide of iron; rendering it highly probable that the\r\nflavor of the tobacco to the smoker depends on the state and quantity\r\nof the iron it contains! Green copperas water, which is a solution of\r\nsulphate of iron, is often used by the American and English\r\ntobacconists and planters, to colour and flavor their tobacco; and\r\nthis would be decomposed by the potass of the tobacco, and sulphate of\r\npotass and carbonate of iron is formed. Carbonate of iron is of an\r\nochre-yellow color. Mr. Piddington says he took care to ascertain that\r\nthis process had not been performed with the tobacco used for this\r\nexperiment; and adds that Bengal cheroot makers do not know of this\r\nmethod. Mr. Laidley, of Gonitea, dissents from the idea suggested by\r\nMr. Piddington that ferruginous matter in the soil is essential to the\r\nsuccessful growth of tobacco. He observes that if we attend only to\r\nthe iron contained, why every plant will be found to require a\r\nferruginous soil; but tobacco contains a notable quantity of nitrate\r\nof potass and muriate of ammonia (the latter a most rare ingredient in\r\nplants), and these two salts are infinitely more likely to affect the\r\nflavor of the leaf than a small portion of oxide of iron, an inert\r\nbody. Now as neither of these can be supplied by the atmosphere, we\r\nmust search for them in the soil, and accordingly he imagined that a\r\ncompost similar to the saltpetre beds which Napoleon employed so\r\nextensively in France, would be a good manure for tobacco lands;\r\nnamely, calcareous matter, such as old mortar, dung, and the ashes of\r\nweeds or wood. He was aware that good tobacco might be grown in\r\nBeerbhoom, having raised some himself several years ago from American\r\nseed. The plants grew most vigorously, and he further observed, in\r\nconfirmation of his opinion about the proper manure, that in other\r\ndistricts in which he had resided the natives always grew the tobacco\r\n(each for his own use) upon the heap of rubbish at his door,\r\nconsisting of ashes, cow-dung, and offal of all kinds. While the soil\r\nof the Gangetic diluvium almost always contains carbonate of lime, the\r\nBeerbhoom soil does not, as far at least as Mr. Laidley had examined\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe following is the mode of culture pursued about the city of\r\nCoimbetore. Between the middle of August and the same time in\r\nSeptember, a plot of ground is hoed and embanked into small squares;\r\nin these the seed is sown, and covered by hand three times at\r\nintervals of ten days. To secure a succession of seedlings water is\r\nthen given, and the sun's rays moderated by a covering of bushes.\r\nWatering is repeated every day for a month, and then only every fifth\r\nday. The field in which the seedlings are transplanted, is manured and\r\nploughed at the end of August. Cattle are also folded upon the ground.\r\nFour or five ploughings are given between mid September and the middle\r\nof October, when the field is divided as above into small squares.\r\nThese are watered until the soil is rendered a mud. Plants of the\r\nfirst sowing are then inserted at the end of September, about a cubit\r\napart, the transplanting being done in the afternoon. At intervals of\r\nten days the seedlings of the other two sowings are removed. A month\r\nafter being transplanted the field is hoed, and after another month\r\nthe leading shoot of each plant is pinched off, so as to leave them\r\nnot more than a cubit high. Three times during the next month all side\r\nshoots thrown out are removed. When four months old, the crop is ready\r\nfor cutting. To render the leaves sweet the field is watered, and the\r\nplants cut down close to the surface, being allowed to remain when cut\r\nuntil next morning. Their roots are tied to a rope and suspended round\r\nthe hedges. In fine weather the leaves are dry in ten days, but if\r\ncloudy they require five more days. They are then heaped up under a\r\nroof, which is covered with bushes and pressed with stones for five\r\ndays. After this the leaves are removed from the stems, tied in\r\nbunches, heaped again, and pressed for four days longer. They are now\r\ntied in bundles, partly of the small leaf and partly of the large leaf\r\nbundles, and again put in heaps for ten days--once during the time the\r\nheaps being opened and piled afresh. This completes the drying. A\r\nthousand bundles, weighing about 570 lbs., is a good produce for an\r\nacre.\r\n\r\nIn 1760, Ceylon produced a considerable quantity of tobacco,\r\nprincipally about Jaffna, a demand having sprung up for it in\r\nTravancore, and on the Malay coast. The cultivation spread to other\r\ndistricts of the island, Negombo, Chilaw, and Matura. Not long after\r\nthe possession of the island by the British, a monopoly was created by\r\nan import duty of 25 per cent., _ad valorem_, and in 1811 the growers\r\nwere compelled to deliver their tobacco into the Government stores at\r\ncertain fixed rates. The culture and demand thereupon decreased. In\r\n1853, the duty on the exports of tobacco from this island amounted to\r\n£8,386, and in 1836 to £9,514.\r\n\r\nCeylon now exports a considerable quantity of tobacco. The value of\r\nthat exported in 1844 was nearly £18,000: it went exclusively to\r\nBritish colonies. The shipments since have been as follows:--\r\n\r\n  1848   £17,992      ----\r\n  1849    22,300      ----\r\n  1850    20,721   22,184 cwts.\r\n  1851    21,422   22,523   \"\r\n  1852    20,531   21,955   \"\r\n\r\nAbout 96,000 piculs of cigars, of five different qualities, are\r\nexported annually from Siam. A good deal of very fine tobacco is grown\r\nin the Philippines, and the Manila cheroots are celebrated all over\r\nthe globe. The quantity of raw tobacco shipped from Manila in 1847 was\r\n92,106 arrobas (each about a quarter of a cwt.); manufactured tobacco,\r\n12,054 arrobas; and 1,933 cases of cigars. 5,220 boxes of cigars were\r\nshipped from Manila in 1844. 73,439 millions of cigars were shipped in\r\n1850, and 42,629 quintals of leaf tobacco.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of cigars in Manila is a monopoly of the government,\r\nand not only is this the case, but it is a monopoly of the closest\r\ndescription, and any infringement of the assumed rights of the Spanish\r\nIndian government is visited by the most severe penalties. Public\r\nenterprise, however little of that commodity there now exists in the\r\nSpanish character, is thus kept down; and this is not only detrimental\r\nto the nation itself, but is also unjust towards those persons who are\r\nthe purchasers of the article, enhanced in price, as is always the\r\ncase, by monopoly. The cheroot, which now costs, free of duty, about\r\none halfpenny, could be rendered for half that sum, according to\r\nwell-authenticated opinions. To protect itself from illicit\r\nmanufacturers, or smuggling of any kind in connection with cigars, the\r\ngovernment is compelled to maintain an army of gendarmes, in order to\r\nadopt the most stringent means which despotic states alone tolerate.\r\nNo person is, therefore, permitted to have even the tobacco leaf in\r\nits raw state on his premises, and gendarmes pay, at stated intervals,\r\ndomiciliary visits to the habitations of the people, in search of any\r\ncontraband materials. There are several extensive manufactories of\r\ncigars and cheroots belonging to the government in and near Manila.\r\nMr. Mac Micking, in his recent work on the Philippines, thus describes\r\nthe mode of manufacture by those employed by the government:--\r\n\r\n    In making cheroots women only are employed, the number of those so\r\n    engaged in the factory at Manila being generally about 4,000. Beside\r\n    these, a large body of men are employed at another place in the\r\n    composition of cigarillos, or small cigars, kept together by an\r\n    envelope of white paper in place of tobacco; these being the\r\n    description most smoked by the Indians. The flavor of Manila\r\n    cheroots is peculiar to themselves, being quite different from that\r\n    made of any other sort of tobacco; the greatest characteristic\r\n    probably being its slightly soporific tendency, which has caused\r\n    many persons in the habit of using it to imagine that opium is\r\n    employed in the preparatory treatment of the tobacco, which,\r\n    however, is not the case.\r\n\r\n    The cigars are made up by the hands of women in large rooms of the\r\n    factory, each of them containing from 800 to 1,000 souls. These are\r\n    all seated, or squatted, Indian like, on their haunches, upon the\r\n    floor, round tables, at each of which there is an old woman\r\n    presiding to keep the young ones in order, about a dozen of them\r\n    being the complement of a table. All of them are supplied with a\r\n    certain weight of tobacco, of the first, second, or third qualities\r\n    used in composing a cigar, and are obliged to account for a\r\n    proportionate number of cheroots, the weight and size of which are\r\n    by these means kept equal. As they use stones for beating out the\r\n    leaf on the wooden tables before which they are seated, the noise\r\n    produced by them while making them up is deafening, and generally\r\n    sufficient to make no one desirous of protracting a visit to the\r\n    place. The workers are well recompensed by the government, as very\r\n    many of them earn from six to ten dollars a month for their labor;\r\n    and as that amount is amply sufficient to provide them with all\r\n    their comforts, and to leave a large balance for their expenses in\r\n    dress, &c., they are seldom very constant laborers, and never enter\r\n    the factory on Sundays, or, at least, on as great an annual number\r\n    of feast days as there are Sundays in a year.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese grow a good deal of tobacco for their own consumption,\r\nwhich is very considerable. They consider that from Sasma as the best,\r\nthen that from Nangasakay, Sinday, &c. The worst comes from the\r\nprovince of Tzyngaru; it is strong, of a black color, and has a\r\ndisgusting taste and smell. The tobacco from Sasma is, indeed, also\r\nstrong, but it has an agreeable taste and smell, and is of a bright\r\nyellow color. The tobacco from Nangasakay is very weak, in taste and\r\nsmell perhaps the best, and of a bright brown color. The tobacco from\r\nSinday is very good. The Japanese manufacture the tobacco so well,\r\nsays Capt. Golownin, (Recollections of Japan,) that though I was\r\nbefore no friend to smoking, and even when I was at Jamaica could but\r\nseldom persuade myself to smoke an Havana cigar, yet I smoked the\r\nJapanese tobacco very frequently, and with great pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe culture of tobacco is a very profitable article for the laborers,\r\nseeing that the produce is obtained from grounds which have already\r\ngiven the first crop. The qualities of Java tobacco are more and more\r\nprized in the European markets, the preparation and assortment are not\r\nyet all that could be desired, but they have progressed in this\r\nbranch, and the contracts made with the new adventurers assure them of\r\na considerable benefit. But before the Java tobaccos can find an\r\nassured opening in the European markets, it is necessary that the\r\ncultivators should make use of seed from the Havana or Manila. The\r\nresidencies of Rembang, Sourabaya, Samarang, Chinbou, and Tagal,\r\npresent districts suited for its culture; it has been carried on with\r\nsuccess for a good many years in the residencies of Treanger,\r\nPakalongan, and Kedu, but only for the consumption of the interior,\r\nand of the Archipelago.\r\n\r\nTobacco is cultivated in Celebes, but merely in sufficient quantity\r\nfor local consumption. It is exclusively grown by the Bantik\r\npopulation--the mode of preparation is the same as in Java; it is\r\nchopped very fine and mostly flavored with arrack. When bought in\r\nlarge quantities, it may be had for thirty cents the pound; but in\r\nsmaller quantities it costs double that price.\r\n\r\nTobacco is cultivated in New South Wales with much success. Australia\r\nproduces a leaf equal to Virginia, or the most fertile parts of\r\nKentucky, but the great difficulty is to extract the superabundant\r\n\"nitre.\" The first crop in New South Wales exceeds one ton per acre,\r\nand the second crop off the same plants, yields about half the weight\r\nof the first. In 1844 there were about 871 acres in cultivation in New\r\nSouth Wales with tobacco, and the produce was returned at 6,382 cwts.\r\nIn New England, New South Wales, as fine a \"fig\" as could be wished\r\nfor is manufactured under the superintendence of a thorough-bred\r\nVirginia tobacco manufacturer--but the impossibility of extracting the\r\nnitre by the heating, or any other process, renders the flavor rank\r\nand disagreeable. Perhaps cheroots, or the lower numbers of cigars,\r\nmanufactured from the Australian leaf, might prove more successful.\r\n\r\nIn Sydney the time for sowing tobacco seed is September, but in Van\r\nDiemen's Land it should be a month later, as tobacco plants cannot\r\nstand the frost. The ground should be made fine, and in narrow beds\r\nthree feet wide from path to path, to allow for weeding without\r\nstepping on the beds. The seed, being small, should not be raked in;\r\nbut after the ground is raked fine, and perfectly clean, and well\r\npulverised, mix the seed with wood ashes, and sow over the beds, and\r\npat in with the spade, or tread in with the naked feet, which is\r\npreferable. The ground should be moist, but not much watered, or it\r\nmoulds the plants. When about as large as moderate sized cabbage\r\nplants, they should be put out--three feet or three feet six in the\r\nrows, and five feet apart between the rows. When the plant rises to\r\nabout two feet high, it will throw out suckers at each leaf, which\r\nmust be carefully taken off with the finger and thumb, and all bottom\r\nand decayed leaves that touch the ground taken off. When the tobacco\r\nplant throws out flower, it must be topped off, leaving about twelve\r\nleaves in the stalk to ripen and come to maturity. When the leaves\r\nfeel thick between the finger and thumb, and assume a mottled\r\nappearance, they are fit to cut.\r\n\r\nIn \"Tegg's New South Wales Almanac\" it is stated that the end of July\r\nis the usual time for sowing the seed. In order, however, to prevent\r\nthe plants from being subsequently destroyed by frost, care must be\r\ntaken not to sow the seed until the frost has ceased in any respective\r\nlocality (unless raised in a frame). Tobacco requires a rich light\r\nsoil, and well manured.\r\n\r\nBy the instructions for cultivating it, the plant must be three feet\r\napart each way, which would give 4,840 plants to an acre; assuming\r\nthat each plant would yield half a pound for the first crop, this\r\nwould give 2,420 lbs. to an acre, which is only 180 lbs. in excess of\r\na ton. In New South Wales several parties use the tobacco stems for\r\nsheep wash. One pound of tobacco is sufficient to wash five sheep on\r\nan average (one washing), which would give 12,100 sheep to one acre.\r\n\r\nAssuming that only one crop was grown in New Zealand in one year, of\r\n2,420 lbs. to an acre, at 3d. per pound, (which is about half the\r\nmarket price of a fair sample of tobacco in bond,) it would amount to\r\n£30 5s. per acre.\r\n\r\nThree rows of Indian corn are planted outside the tobacco plants to\r\nshelter them from the wind. In order to save seed, a few plants are\r\nallowed to flower. The Virginian tobacco is the largest; it is known\r\nby a pink flower; the _Nicotiana rustica_ (common green) has a yellow\r\nflower.\r\n\r\nA planter in Northern Australia furnishes the following directions:--\r\n\r\n    The land selected for the growth of tobacco ought to be of the most\r\n    fertile description, of a friable description, and upon which no\r\n    water can rest within eighteen inches of the surface. Newly cleared\r\n    brush lands of this nature are the most prolific; upon such, after\r\n    good tillage, put the plants about four feet or more apart, in rows,\r\n    and five feet six inches asunder. In interior or old ground, plant\r\n    proportionately closer. Before topping or nipping off the head, all\r\n    the lower leaves (that is such as may touch the ground) ought to be\r\n    broken off, leaving only from five to seven for the crop, which will\r\n    yield a greater weight and be of a superior quality than if double\r\n    that number were left. When ripe, a dry and cloudy day should be\r\n    selected to cut it, as the sun destroys its quality after cutting.\r\n    It ought then to lie sufficiently long upon the ground so as to welt\r\n    before carting to the sheds, hanging up each stalk next morning so\r\n    as not to touch its fellow.\r\n\r\n    The drying sheds ought to be built upon an elevated or dry spot,\r\n    with a hoarded flour of rough split stuff, fifteen or eighteen\r\n    inches from the ground, with apertures as windows to admit or to\r\n    exclude the external atmosphere. In damp weather close all the doors\r\n    and windows, also every night; in contrary weather open all.\r\n\r\n    In these drying houses the stalks should remain suspended until the\r\n    vegetable moisture is entirely evaporated, so that on a dry day the\r\n    stems of the leaves will break like a glass pipe, and the finer\r\n    parts crumble into snuff upon compression; after which, in humid\r\n    weather, they will become quite pliable; then strip the leaves off\r\n    the stems, make them up into hands, and pack them tightly into a\r\n    close bin: when full, cover it with boards and old bagged stuff,\r\n    upon which place heavy weights. In this state it undergoes the\r\n    sweating process, which, in this colony, is little understood or not\r\n    properly attended to, and yet, upon the skill displayed thereon, the\r\n    quality of the tobacco greatly depends. I will therefore give some\r\n    general directions upon this portion of the planter's office. If the\r\n    tobacco happen to be too damp when put into the bin, it will attain\r\n    either an injurious or a destructive degree of heat; it must\r\n    therefore he watched for some days after it is packed. To an\r\n    experienced operator I would say, if the heat exceed 80 degrees of\r\n    temperature, immediately unpack and re-hang the whole, waiting its\r\n    condition as before explained, before it is again put into the\r\n    sweating bin. Should the degree of heat be below that stated, it may\r\n    remain for weeks or until the heat has subsided. I have generally\r\n    removed it from the sweating process in about fourteen or twenty\r\n    days, sometimes considerably longer, regulating that act by the odor\r\n    and color of the leaf. If, however, it appears to be attaining a\r\n    very dark brown color and its heat not subsided, it should be taken\r\n    out and closely pressed into large cases or casks, when it will\r\n    again attain a gentle heat called the \"second sweating,\" as is\r\n    invariably the case with the hogsheads of the American leaf tobacco:\r\n    this again improves its quality. Here the grower's operations\r\n    terminate.\r\n\r\n    It may be necessary to remark, that how skilful and experienced\r\n    soever the grower may be, it is hardly possible for him to produce a\r\n    good article upon a small scale; for with a less quantity than one\r\n    ton to place in the sweating bin at a time, the requisite heat to\r\n    insure success will not be generated. I would further observe, that\r\n    the practice of the colonists in growing what they term a \"second\r\n    crop\" is most injurious to their interests, their lands, and the\r\n    quality and character of the colonial tobacco. The American planter\r\n    never attempts it. I would therefore strongly recommend its\r\n    discontinuance, and also never to crop one piece of land with\r\n    tobacco more than two or three years in succession. The Americans\r\n    rarely take more than two crops unless the land be new; after which\r\n    they sow it down with grasses, in which state it remains for two or\r\n    three years until it is again planted with tobacco. I would\r\n    recommend this plan to the growers.\r\n\r\n    The character of the American tobacco has been greatly advanced in\r\n    the mercantile world by an ordinance regulating that source of\r\n    national wealth. The planters are thereby obligated to deposit their\r\n    crops in warehouses, over which sworn inspectors preside, who\r\n    rigidly examine every hogshead, and if found to be of mercantile\r\n    quality, grant the owner a certificate, by which instrument only he\r\n    sells his produce. The purchaser is hereby safe in buying these\r\n    certificates. The tobacco to which they refer is delivered to the\r\n    holder on presentation to the inspector. I mention this not as\r\n    applicable here at present, but it most probably may hereafter.\r\n\r\n    When the colony is suffering severely for the want of labor, it may\r\n    by some be deemed inopportune in offering remarks upon this article\r\n    of commerce. To such dissentients I will remark, that a great\r\n    portion of the work can be performed by women and children. A moiety\r\n    of our anticipated increase of population will be available for this\r\n    hitherto mismanaged source of wealth. At present the quantity grown\r\n    in the colony is equal to three-fourths of its consumption, and\r\n    which production is of a very inferior quality to the imported.\r\n    These facts tend to show that my notice of the subject is not\r\n    inopportune, and particularly so when the object is to point out\r\n    those errors so generally adopted by the tobacco growers here. Years\r\n    of practical experience, of personal observation upon the\r\n    plantations of North America, and my having been, I believe, the\r\n    grower of the greatest quantity of tobacco in the colony, qualify me\r\n    to afford instructions thereon; whereby, if attended to, our tobacco\r\n    will become fully equal to the American, as was proved to be the\r\n    case by the crops I grew here (upwards of 40 tons),[56] which were\r\n    sold in Sydney by the Commissariat Department at public auction, at\r\n    an advance of twenty per cent. more than the imported leaf. As the\r\n    duty on tobacco is about to be reduced, the present production may\r\n    fall off, unless an immediate improvement in its quality take place.\r\n    Instead of being importers of tobacco, we should, if it was grown\r\n    here to perfection, be exporters of it to all our sister colonies;\r\n    and in its raw state, also to the European markets. At present, for\r\n    home consumption, there is a greater profit to be made by its\r\n    cultivation, if skilfully managed, than in any part of the world;\r\n    for the duty upon imported is a positive bonus to the grower.\r\n\r\nIn 1849-50 there were fifteen manufactories of tobacco on a small\r\nscale in New South Wales, but these were reduced in 1851 to six.\r\n\r\nMany samples of tobacco grown in the colony have been pronounced by\r\ncompetent judges equal to Virginian, but a very considerable prejudice\r\nexists against it. There is, however, no doubt that the dealers\r\ndispose of a great deal as American tobacco, and get a best price for\r\nit. The reduction of the import duties on foreign tobacco, recently\r\nmade by the Legislative Council, will probably retard the progress of\r\nthe colonial production and manufacture of this article; but with an\r\nabundance of labor there is no question that this branch of industry\r\nwill be again profitably resorted to. The quantity of tobacco\r\nmanufactured in New South Wales, in 1847, was 1,321 cwt.; in 1848, 714\r\ncwt.; in 1849, 2,758 cwt.; in 1850, 3,833 cwt.; in 1851, 4,841 cwt.\r\n\r\nA correspondent of the _Adelaide Observer_ recommends its culture in\r\nSouth Australia, and supplies the following useful information:--\r\n\r\n    Without entering into botanical details, I will simply state that\r\n    the plant is of a shrubby nature, about five feet high, and ought\r\n    not to be planted nearer than four feet from each other, in rows\r\n    five feet apart--thus allowing for each plant a space of ground four\r\n    feet by five, or 20 square feet. An acre will consequently furnish\r\n    sufficient room for 2,178 plants.\r\n\r\n    The tobacco plant will thrive in almost any climate, from the torrid\r\n    zone to the temperature of Great Britain. It luxuriates in rich\r\n    alluvial valleys, where the soil is either of a _loamy_ or a _peaty_\r\n    nature.\r\n\r\n    Maiden soil is not recommended. The ground should be trenched,\r\n    worked as fine as possible, and well manured. Tobacco will not\r\n    answer unless the subsoil is thoroughly broken. The best manure is\r\n    that obtained from the bullock-yard, and bark from the tan yard; and\r\n    by two or three ploughings the earth can be brought to a proper\r\n    consistency, and fit for the reception of the plants.\r\n\r\n    The usual method adopted in New South Wales, is to raise the plants\r\n    in a warm, sheltered bed, neither exposed to wind nor to the sun's\r\n    rays; but if the weather is dry, they should be well watered night\r\n    and morning. The time of sowing is the end of August or the\r\n    beginning of September in the latitude of Sydney, according to the\r\n    state of the weather; and they may be transplanted when they have\r\n    attained their sixth leaf, which is generally about a month or five\r\n    weeks after they are up.\r\n\r\n    The period is rather later in this colony, and care should be taken\r\n    that the plants have gained sufficient strength in the ground after\r\n    transplanting to withstand the effect of the hot winds, and, if\r\n    practicable, the aspect should be either N.E. or N.W., and the rows\r\n    should incline towards either of these points.\r\n\r\n    The most suitable spots in this colony for the cultivation of\r\n    tobacco, are Lyndoch Valley and the districts round the town of\r\n    Willunga and Morphett Vale.\r\n\r\n    The greatest care is required from the cultivator to prevent the\r\n    destruction of the plant from its greatest enemy, the black grub.\r\n    Daily search should be made for it, and not a plant should be left\r\n    unexamined; they make their appearance about the beginning of\r\n    November, when the plants have scarcely had time to take root. The\r\n    soil between the rows should be kept constantly stirred with a\r\n    three-pronged fork, that air and the sun's rays may be admitted,\r\n    which latter are as indispensable to the growing plant as injurious\r\n    to the seedling. The labor is great, and from first to last requires\r\n    the constant attention of one man throughout the year, with an\r\n    additional hand for about six weeks during the process of curing.\r\n\r\n    The profits even in bad seasons are considerable; but when the\r\n    season and soil are favorable, they average upwards of 100 per cent.\r\n    The consumption of tobacco is great in this colony, not only for\r\n    personal use, but for sheep-wash; and the profits may be\r\n    considerably greater for the lower leaves, which, owing to their\r\n    gritty nature, cannot be manufactured, but may be advantageously\r\n    cured for wash.\r\n\r\n    It is not my office to argue the point as to the advantages which\r\n    may accrue from a free trade in tobacco; but this I know, and\r\n    confidently assert it, from actual experiments made in this\r\n    province, that a more lucrative article cannot be grown.\r\n\r\n    The consumption in South America, in 1850, was 147,178 lbs.; and the\r\n    annual increase since 1840 has been a higher percentage than the\r\n    increase of population, chiefly owing to extension in sheep-farming.\r\n\r\n    The probable expense of cultivation per acre may be as under:--\r\n\r\n                            £  s.  d.\r\n    Rent                    0 10   0\r\n    Labor, 12 months       52  0   0\r\n    Ditto, 2 months         8 10   0\r\n    Ploughing three times   2  2   0\r\n    Harrowing twice         1  0   0\r\n    Manure, say             2 10   0\r\n    Seed, say               0 10   0\r\n                          ----------\r\n                          £67  2   0\r\n\r\n     The Sydney average quantity is said to be 11-1/3 cwt. per acre,\r\n     say 10 cwt.; and the cost price per lb. will be 14½d., or £6 15s.\r\n     4d. per cwt. The profit will at once be seen on this article of\r\n     consumption.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous Drugs.--The blood tree (_Croton gossypifolia_), an\r\nevergreen shrub, native of the Trinidad mountains, is remarkable for\r\nyielding, when wounded, a thick juice resembling blood in color, which\r\nis one of the most powerful astringents I know of, and as such would\r\nbe valuable to medical science. The bark of _Croton Cascarilla_ is, as\r\nwe have seen in a former section, aromatic, and the seeds of _C.\r\nTiglium_, the physic nut, are purgative; so are those of the purging\r\nnut (_Jatropha multifida_), and another species (_J. gossypifolia_).\r\n\r\nThe pods of cow-itch (_Mucuna pruriens_) act as a vermifuge; the roots\r\nof the _Ruellia tuberosa_, or manyroot, and the bulbs of the white\r\nlily (_Pancratium Carribæum_ and _maritimum_), are emetic. The Indian\r\nroot or bastard ipecacuan (_Asclepias curassavica_) has medicinal\r\nproperties. _A. tuberosa_ is used as a mild cathartic, and a remedy\r\nfor a variety of disorders. _Hydrastis canadensis_, or Canadian yellow\r\nroot, is a valuable bitter, and furnishes a useful yellow dye.\r\n_Knowltonia vesicatoria_ is used commonly as a blister in the Cape\r\nColony. _Ranunculus saleratus_ (the _R. indicus_ of Roxburgh, and _B.\r\ncamosus_ of Wallich), common in India, is also used by the natives for\r\nblistering purposes.\r\n\r\nA kind of sedge rush, common in swampy places in the West India\r\nislands, the _Adme cyperus_, enjoys a reputation for the cure of\r\nyellow fever. It is also stated to be cordial, diuretic and cephalic,\r\nserviceable in the first stages of the dropsy, good in vomitings,\r\nfluxes, &c.\r\n\r\nDr. Impey, the residentiary surgeon of Malwa, has just confidence in\r\nthe indigenous drugs in use by the natives of the East, many of which\r\nare quite unknown in European practice. He believes that, in the\r\nIndian bazaars and the jungle, drugs having precisely the same effect\r\nas those of Europe may be discovered, and has recently drawn up a list\r\nof ninety substances, which are perfect substitutes for an equal\r\nnumber of European medicines. The class of tonics, in particular, is\r\nmost amply supplied, and the Englishman is not the only animal who\r\nsuffers from disorders of the digestive organs.\r\n\r\nMy friend Dr. Hamilton, of Plymouth, recently brought under the notice\r\nof the profession the medical properties of the prickly poppy or\r\nMexican thistle (_Argemone Mexicana_). It is indigenous to and grows\r\nwild in the greatest profusion throughout the whole of the Caribbean\r\nislands, and may be found at every season of the year covered with its\r\nbright golden blossoms, and bearing its prickly capsules in all their\r\nseveral stages of maturity. It is an annual plant, attaining a height\r\nof about two feet, growing abundantly in low and hot uncultivated\r\nspots. Its stem is round and prickly, furnished with alternate\r\nbranches and thorny leaves. The seeds possess an emetic quality. The\r\nwhole plant abounds in a yellow milky juice, resembling gamboge in\r\ncolor, and not improbably possessing properties similar to the seeds.\r\nIn Nevis the oil is obtained from the bruised seeds by boiling, and\r\nsold by the negroes in small phials, containing about an ounce each,\r\nunder the name of \"thistle oil,\" at the price of a quarter of a dollar\r\neach. The usual dose for dry bellyache is thirty drops upon a lump of\r\nsugar, and its effect is perfectly magical, relieving the pain\r\ninstantaneously, throwing the patient into a profound and refreshing\r\nsleep, and in a few hours relieving the bowels gently of the contents.\r\nThis oil seems fitted to compete in utility with the far more costly\r\nand less agreeable oil of the croton.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of the sandbox (_Hura crepitans_) when bruised, operate\r\npowerfully as emetico-cathartic. It is probable that an oil might be\r\nobtained from them similar in its operation to the thistle oil.\r\n\r\nA cucurbitaceous fruit, one of the Luffas (called by Von Martius\r\n_Luffa purgans_), a tribe closely allied to the colocynth and\r\nmornordicas, growing in South America, is a powerful purgative, and is\r\nused in the province of Pernambuco, where it is called Cabacinha. The\r\nfruit is about the size of a small pear and resembles the wild\r\ncucumber. An infusion of a fourth part of one of these fruits is\r\nadministered chiefly in the form of an injection.\r\n\r\nAnother species (_Luffa drastica_, of Martius) is also employed for\r\nthe same purpose.\r\n\r\nThe _Luffa purgans_ grows spontaneously in the suburbs of Recieffe,\r\nthe capital of the province of Pernambuco, and flowers in November and\r\nDecember. The fruit is a drastic purgative, and an infusion of it is\r\nused either internally or in the form of clyster. The tincture is\r\nprepared by macerating, for twenty-eight hours or more, four of the\r\nfruit deprived of the seeds in a bottle of spirit 21 degrees. The dose\r\nis three or four ounces daily, which occasions much sickness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPoisons.--The vegetable kingdom (observes Mr. Simple), to which man is\r\nlargely indebted for the materials of food, clothing, and shelter,\r\nproduces also some of the most deadly poisons with which science,\r\nexperience, or accident, has made him acquainted. In examining the\r\npoisonous productions of the vegetable kingdom, we find that their\r\nproperties are generally due to the presence of some acid or alkali\r\ncontained in the plant from which they are derived. Oil of bitter\r\nalmonds and cherry laurel water are poisonous in consequence of\r\ncontaining prussic acid. Opium owes its activity to the alkaloid\r\nmorphia. The Upas-tiente derives its energetic powers from the\r\nalkaloid strychnia; conia is the active principle of hemlock; veratria\r\nof hellebore; aconita of monk's hood; and although there are several\r\npoisonous plants in which the active principle has not yet been\r\ndetected, there can be little doubt that such a principle exists,\r\nalthough it has hitherto eluded the researches of the\r\nchemist.--(\"Pharmaceutical Journal,\" vol. 2, p. 17.)\r\n\r\nThe bark taken from the roots of the Jamaica dogwood (_Piscidia\r\nerythrina_), which is extensively distributed throughout the\r\nArchipelago of the Antilles, is used for stupefying fish. The pounded\r\nroot is mixed with slaked lime and the low wines or lees of the\r\ndistillery, and the mixture is put into small baskets or sacks, and so\r\nsuffered to wash out gradually, coloring the water to a reddish hue.\r\nThe fish rise to the surface in a few minutes, when they float as if\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nThe expressed juice of the root of _Maranta Arundinacea_ is stated to\r\nbe a valuable antidote to some vegetable poisons, and also serviceable\r\nin cases of bites or stings of venomous insects or reptiles. One of\r\nthe most popular remedies for the bites of snakes is a decoction of\r\nthe leaves of the Guaco, or snake plant, of South America, a species\r\nof willow which flourishes along the banks of the streams in the\r\nsultry regions shaded by other trees. It is said to be both a\r\npreventive and cure.\r\n\r\nMr. Edward Otto, writing from Cuba to the \"Gardener's Magazine\" for\r\nMay, 1842, p. 286, describes the guaco as a tree growing from four to\r\neight feet in height, with beautiful dark green leaves, having a brown\r\ntinge round the margin. The blossoms are small, of a bluish brown, and\r\nhang like loose bunches of grapes at the points of the shoots, or even\r\non the stem itself, as it has seldom branches. The milky sap is said\r\nto have poisonous effects. \"I was told (he adds) that this plant is\r\nused efficiently in cholera and yellow fever.\" This tree is said to be\r\nthe _Camæladia ilicifolia_ of Swartz, common in Antigua and Hayti,\r\nbeing known in Antigua by the popular name of the holly-leaved maiden\r\nplum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nALOES.--The drug called aloes is the bitter, resinous, inspissated\r\njuice of the leaves of various species of an arborescent plant of the\r\nlily family, with a developed stem and large succulent leaves, growing\r\nprincipally in tropical and sub-tropical regions, and having a wide\r\nextent of range, being produced in Borneo and the East, Africa,\r\nArabia, and the West Indies; many are also natives of the Cape of Good\r\nHope. The plant will thrive in almost any soil, and, when once\r\nestablished, it is extremely difficult to eradicate.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation and manufacture are of the most simple kind. The usual\r\nmode of propagating the plants is by suckers; and all the care\r\nrequired is to keep them free from weeds.\r\n\r\nFrom the high price which the best Barbados aloes fetches in the\r\nmarket, £7 per cwt., its culture might be profitably extended to many\r\nof the other islands. The aloes plant is indigenous to the soil of\r\nJamaica, and although handled by thousands of the peasantry and\r\nothers, there is not perhaps one in five thousand who understands its\r\nproperties or the value of the plant. With the Jamaicans it is\r\ncommonly used in fever cases, by slicing the leaves, permitting the\r\njuice to escape partially, and then applying them to the head with\r\nbandages;--this is the only generally known property which it\r\npossesses there.\r\n\r\nA series of trials made recently in Paris proved that cordage\r\nmanufactured from the fibre of this plant grown in Algiers, was far\r\npreferable in comparative strength to that manufactured from hemp.\r\nCables, of equal size, showed that that made of the aloe raised a\r\nweight of one-fifth more than that of hemp.\r\n\r\nThe drug is imported into this country under the names of Socotrine,\r\nEast Indian or Hepatic, Barbados, Cape and Caballine aloes. It\r\ncontains a substance called Aloetine, which some regard as its active\r\nprinciple. The various species now defined are--_Aloe spicata_,\r\n_vulgaris_, _Socotrina_, _Indica_, _rubescens_, _Arabica_,\r\n_linguæ-formis_ and _Commelina_. The average imports in 1841 and 1842\r\nwere only about 170,780 cwts.; it is now much larger, and a great\r\nportion of the supply is drawn from the Cape colony.\r\n\r\nThe mode of preparing the drug, which I have myself seen in the West\r\nIndies, is exceedingly simple. When the plant has arrived at proper\r\nmaturity, the laborers go into the field with tubs and knives, and cut\r\nthe largest and most succulent leaves close to the stalk; these are\r\nplaced upright in the tubs, side by side, so that the sap may flow out\r\nof the wound. Sometimes a longitudinal incision is made from top to\r\nbottom of the leaf, to facilitate the discharge. The crude juice thus\r\nobtained is placed in shallow flat-bottomed receivers, and exposed to\r\nthe sun until it has acquired sufficient consistency to be packed in\r\ngourds for exportation. In preparing the coarser kind, or horse aloes,\r\nthe leaves are cut into junks and thrown into the tubs, there to lie\r\ntill the juice is pretty well drained out; they are then squeezed by\r\nthe hand, and water, in the proportion of one quart to ten of juice,\r\nis added, after which it is boiled to a due consistence and emptied\r\ninto large shallow coolers.\r\n\r\nThe following analysis by M. Edmond Robiquet of a specimen of\r\nSocotrine aloes, obtained from M. Chevallier, is given in the sixth\r\nvolume of the \"Pharmaceutical Journal,\" p. 277. The constituents in\r\n100 parts were:--\r\n\r\n  Pure aloes (Aloetine)           85.00\r\n  Ulmate of potash                 2.00\r\n  Sulphate of lime                 2.00\r\n  Carbonate of potash           }\r\n  -------------lime             } traces.\r\n  Phosphate of lime             }\r\n  Gallic acid                       .25\r\n  Albumen                          8.\r\n\r\nThe true Socotrine aloes is the produce of _A. Socotrina_, which grows\r\nabundantly in the island of Socotra in the Indian Ocean. Lieutenant\r\nWellstead says, the hills on the west side of the island are covered\r\nfor an extent of miles with aloe plants. The aloe grows spontaneously\r\non the limestone mountains of Socotra, from 500 to 3,000 feet above\r\nthe level of the sea. The produce is brought to Tamarida and\r\nColliseah, the principal town and harbor for exports. In 1833, the\r\nbest quality sold for 2s. a pound, while for the more indifferent the\r\nprice was 13d. The value is much impaired by the careless manner in\r\nwhich the aloes is gathered and packed. Aloes once formed the staple\r\nof its traffic, for which it was chiefly resorted to; but only small\r\nquantities are now exported. It was formerly shipped by the way of\r\nSmyrna and Alexandria, but is usually now brought by the way of\r\nBombay; Melinda, on the Zanzibar coast, and Maccula on the Arabian\r\nshore, furnish the greater part of that sold in Europe as Socotrine\r\naloes. It comes home in chests or packages of 150 to 200 lbs. wrapt in\r\nskins of the gazelle, sometimes in casks holding half a ton or more.\r\nIt is somewhat transparent, of a garnet or yellowish red color. The\r\nsmell is not very unpleasant, approaching to myrrh. Socotrine aloes,\r\nalthough long considered the best kind, is now below Barbados aloes in\r\ncommercial value.\r\n\r\nAbout two tons were imported from Socotra in 1833, but a much larger\r\nquantity could be obtained if required.\r\n\r\nThe price of Socotrine aloes in the Liverpool market, in the early\r\npart of 1853, was 30s. to £6 the cwt.; of Cape, 30s. to 32s.\r\n\r\n_East Indian_, or _Hepatic aloes_.-- The real hepatic aloes, so called\r\nfrom its liver color, is believed to be the produce of _A. Arabica_,\r\nor _perfoliala_, which grows in Yemen in Arabia, from whence it is\r\nexported by the way of Bombay to Europe. According to Dr. Thomson and\r\nthe \"Materia Medica,\" it is duller in its color than the other kinds,\r\nis bitterer, and has a less pleasant aroma than the Socotrine aloes.\r\nIt should not be liquid, which deteriorates the quality.\r\n\r\n_A. Indica_--a species with reddish flowers, common in dry situations,\r\nin the north-west provinces of India, is that from which an inferior\r\nsort of the drug is produced. It is obtained in Guzerat, Salem, and\r\nTrichinopoly, and fetches a local price of 2d. to 3d. a pound. In the\r\nBombay market, Socotrine aloes fetches wholesale 16s. to 20s. the\r\nSurat maund of 41 lbs., and Maccula aloes only 9s.\r\n\r\n_Barbados aloes_, is the produce of _A. vulgaris_, or _A.\r\nbarbadensis_, a native of the Cape colony, and is often passed off for\r\nthe Hepatic. It is brought home in calabashes, or large gourd shells,\r\ncontaining from 60 to 70 lbs. each, or more. It is duskier in hue than\r\nthe East Indian species, being a darkish brown or black, and the taste\r\nis more nauseous and intensely bitter.\r\n\r\nIn 1786 one hogshead and 409 gourds of aloes were exported from\r\nBarbados. In 1827, there were about 96,000 packages shipped from the\r\nisland. In 1844, there were 4,600 packages exported. The exports have\r\nfallen off considerably, only about 850 gourds having been shipped in\r\nthe season of 1849-50; but in 1851 it increased to 2,505 gourds.\r\n\r\n_Caballine_, or _Horse-aloes_, is the coarsest species or refuse of\r\nthe Barbados aloes, and from its rank fetid smell is only useful for\r\nveterinary medicine. It is also obtained from Spain and Senegal.\r\n\r\nA very good description of the mode of cultivating and preparing the\r\naloes in Barbados is given in the 8th vol. of the \"London Medical\r\nJournal\":--\r\n\r\n    The lands in the vicinity of the sea, that is from two to three\r\n    miles, which are rather subject to drought than otherwise, and are\r\n    so strong and shallow as not to admit of the planting of sugar-canes\r\n    with any prospect of success, are generally found to answer best for\r\n    the aloe-plant. The stones, at least the larger ones, are first\r\n    picked up, and either packed in heaps upon the most shallow barren\r\n    spots, or laid round the field as a dry wall. The land is then\r\n    lightly ploughed and very carefully cleared of all noxious weeds,\r\n    lined at one foot distance from row to row, and the young plants set\r\n    like cabbages, at about five or six inches from each other. This\r\n    regular mode of lining and setting the plants is practised only by\r\n    the most exact planters, in order to facilitate the frequent weeding\r\n    by hand; because if the ground be not kept perfectly clean and free\r\n    from weeds, the produce will be very small. Aloes will bear being\r\n    planted in any season of the year, even in the dryest, as they will\r\n    live on the surface of the earth for many weeks without a drop of\r\n    rain. The most general time of planting them, however, is from April\r\n    to June.\r\n\r\n    In the March following, the laborers carry a parcel of tubs and jars\r\n    into the field, and each takes a slip or breadth of it, and begins\r\n    by laying hold of a bunch of the blades, as much as he can\r\n    conveniently grasp with one hand, whilst with the other he cuts it\r\n    just above the surface of the earth as quickly as possible (that the\r\n    juice may not be wasted), and then places the branches in the tub\r\n    bunch by bunch or handful by handful. When the first tub is thus\r\n    packed quite full, a second is begun (each laborer having two); and\r\n    by the time the second is filled, all the juice is generally drained\r\n    out of the blades in the first tub. The blades are then lightly\r\n    taken out and thrown over the land by way of manure, and the juice\r\n    is poured out into a jar. The tub is then filled again with blades,\r\n    and so alternately, till the laborer has produced his jar full, or\r\n    about four gallons and a half of juice, which is often done in six\r\n    or seven hours, and he has then the remainder of the day to himself,\r\n    it being his employer's interest to get each day's operation as\r\n    quickly done as possible. It may be observed that although aloes are\r\n    often cut in nine, ten, or twelve months after being planted, they\r\n    are not in perfection till the second or third year, and that they\r\n    will be productive for a length of time, say ten or twelve years, or\r\n    even for a longer time, if good dung or manure of any kind is\r\n    stirred over the field once in three or four years, or oftener if\r\n    convenient.\r\n\r\n    The aloe juice will keep for several weeks without injury. It is\r\n    therefore not boiled till a sufficient quantity is procured to make\r\n    it an object for the boiling house. In the large way, three boilers,\r\n    or coppers are placed to one fire, though some have but two, and the\r\n    small planters only one boiler. The boilers are filled with the\r\n    juice, and as it ripens or becomes more inspissated by a constant\r\n    but regular fire, it is ladled from boiler to boiler, and fresh\r\n    juice is added to that farthest from the fire, till the juice in\r\n    that nearest the fire (by much the smallest of the three) becomes of\r\n    a proper consistency, to be skipped or ladled out into gourds or\r\n    other small vessels used for its final reception. The proper time to\r\n    skip or ladle it out of the last boiler is when it has arrived at\r\n    what is termed a resin height, or when it cuts freely or in thin\r\n    flakes from the edges of a small wooden slice that is dipped from\r\n    time to time into the boiler for that purpose. A little lime water\r\n    is used by some aloe boilers during the process, when the ebullition\r\n    is too great.\r\n\r\nCAPE ALOES is the produce chiefly of _A. spicata_, and _A. Commelini_,\r\nwhich are found growing wild in great abundance in the interior of the\r\nCape Colony. It has not the dark opaque appearance of the other\r\nspecies. About fifty miles from Cape Town is a mountainous tract,\r\nalmost entirely covered with numerous species and varieties of the\r\nplant, and some of the extensive arid plains in the interior of the\r\ncolony are crowded with it. The settlers go forth and pitch their\r\nwaggous and campa on these spots to obtain the produce. The shipments\r\nfrom Table Bay and the eastern port of Algoa Bay are very\r\nconsiderable. The odor of the Cape aloes is stronger and more\r\ndisagreeable than that of the Socotrine or Barbados, and the color is\r\nmore like gamboge. It is brought over in chests and skins, the latter\r\nbeing preferred.\r\n\r\nMr. George Dunsterville, surgeon of Algoa Bay, gives the following\r\ndescription of the manufacture of Cape aloes:--\r\n\r\n    A shallow pit is dug, in which is spread a bullock's hide or sheep's\r\n    skin. The leaves of the aloe plants in the immediate vicinity of\r\n    this pit are stripped off and piled up on the skin to variable\r\n    heights. These are left for a few days. The juice exudes from the\r\n    leaves, and is received by the skin beneath. The Hottentot then\r\n    collects in a basket or other convenient article the produce of many\r\n    heaps, which is then put into an iron pot capable of holding\r\n    eighteen or twenty gallons. Fire is applied to effect evaporation,\r\n    during which the contents of the pot are constantly stirred to\r\n    prevent burning. The cooled liquor is then poured into wooden cases\r\n    of about three feet square by one foot deep, or into goat or sheep\r\n    skins, and thus is filled for the market. In the colony aloes\r\n    realises about 2¼ d. to 3½ d. per pound. The Hottentots and Dutch\r\n    boors employ indiscriminately different species of aloe in the\r\n    preparation of the drug.\r\n\r\n    The Cape aloes, which _is_ usually prized the highest in the English\r\n    market, is that made at the Missionary institution of Bethelsdorp (a\r\n    small village about nine miles from Algoa Bay, and chiefly inhabited\r\n    by Hottentots and their missionary teachers). Its superiority arises\r\n    not from the employment of a particular species of aloe, for all\r\n    species are used, but from the greater care and attention paid to\r\n    what is technically called the cooking of the aloes; that is, the\r\n    evaporation, and to the absence of all adulterating substances\r\n    (fragments of limestone, sand, earth, &c.), often introduced by\r\n    manufacturers.\r\n\r\nMr. Moodie, in his \"Ten Years' Residence in Southern Africa,\" gives a\r\nsomewhat similar account.\r\n\r\nMr. Bunbury states that, about the neighbourhood of Graham's Town,\r\nthree large kinds of aloe are very abundant, which form striking and\r\ncharacteristic features of the scenery; they grow irregularly\r\nscattered over the parched and naked faces of the hills, but most\r\nabundantly among the low broken ledges and knolls of sandstone rock,\r\nand are often seen spiring up above the evergreen bushes in the\r\nravines, and crowning the cliffs. One kind grows to the height of a\r\nman. They are plants of a strange, rigid, and ungraceful appearance,\r\nbut with very handsome flowers, which form tall and dense spikes, of a\r\nfine coral-red color in two of the species _(A. arborescens_ and\r\n_lineata?_), and of an orange scarlet in the third _(A.\r\nglaucescens?_). When in blossom they are conspicuous at a great\r\ndistance, and might easily be mistaken, when seen from far off, for\r\nsoldiers in red uniforms.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this indigenous plant to the Cape Colony, may be\r\nestimated from the following figures:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  AMOUNT OF ALOES, THE PRODUCE OF THE COLONY, AND VALUE THEREOF,\r\n  EXPORTED IN THE YEARS ENDING 5TH JANUARY 1841, 1842, AND 1846.\r\n                   lbs           £\r\n  1841           485,574       8,821\r\n  1842           602,620      11,877\r\n  1846           266,725       3,018\r\n\r\n\r\n  EXPORTS AND VALUE FROM THE EASTERN PROVINCE.\r\n                   lbs.          £\r\n  1835            68,042         474\r\n  1836            30,808         285\r\n  1837            13,400         115\r\n  1838            28,867         306\r\n  1839            75,500         918\r\n  1840            82,478       1,145\r\n  1841           220,214       4,271\r\n  1842           283,305       5,003\r\n  1844           318,035       3,225\r\n\r\n\r\n  EXPORTS AND VALUE FROM THE WESTERN PROVINCE.\r\n                   lbs.          £\r\n  1841           242,860       4,175\r\n  1842           379,315       6,874\r\n  1844           506,796       6,586\r\n\r\nASAFOETIDA.---This drug of commerce is procured from the milky juice\r\nof _Ferula asafoetida_, a plant recently described by Dr. Falconer,\r\nunder the name of _Narthex asafoetida_. It is found in Persia, the\r\nmountains of Chorasan, the central table land of Affghanistan, and\r\nsome seeds of it, sent to this country by Dr. Falconer, germinated in\r\nthe Botanical Garden at Edinburgh, and are now vigorous thriving\r\nplants of six years growth. Its leaves have a resemblance to those of\r\na pæony; the fruit is distinguished by divided and interrupted vittae,\r\nwhich form a network on the surface. The perennial roots grow to a\r\nvery large size, and are seldom of any use until after four or five\r\nyears' growth. The asafoetida is procured by taking successive slices\r\noff the top of the root and collecting the milky juice., which is\r\nallowed to concrete into masses of a fetid resinous gummy matter, with\r\na sulphur oil, similar to that of garlic, which is probably its active\r\ningredient.\r\n\r\nAn inferior sort is obtained from _F. persica_, another species with\r\nvery much divided leaves, growing chiefly in the southern provinces of\r\nPersia. It comes over usually in casks and cases. The British\r\nconsumption of the drug is about 10,000 lbs. a year. A little is\r\nprocured from Scinde. In 1825 the quantity imported was 106,770 lbs.,\r\nin 1839 only 24 cwts.\r\n\r\nThe wholesale price in the Liverpool market, in January 1853, was £1\r\nto £3 10s. the cwt.\r\n\r\nCAMPHOR.--The Camphor tree (_Camphora officinarum_, _Laurus Camphora_)\r\nis a native of China, Japan, and Cochin China, of the laurel tribe,\r\nwith black and purple veins. Camphor is procured from all parts of the\r\ntree, but it is obtained principally from the wood by distillation,\r\nand subsequent sublimation.\r\n\r\nMany plants, such as the cinnamon tree, supply a kind of camphor, but\r\nthe common camphor of the shops is the produce chiefly of _C.\r\nofficinarum._\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of unrefined camphor are known in commerce.--1. The Dutch,\r\nwhich is brought from Batavia, and is said to be the produce of Japan.\r\nThis is imported in tubs covered by matting and each surrounded by a\r\nsecond tub, secured on the outside by hoops of twisted cane. Each tub\r\ncontains about one cwt. Most of this goes to the continent. 2.\r\nOrdinary crude camphor is imported from Singapore and Bombay, in\r\nsquare chests lined with lead-foil, and containing 1¼ to 1½ cwts. It\r\nis chiefly produced in the island of Formosa, and is brought by the\r\nChin Chew junks in very large quantities to Canton, whence foreign\r\nmarkets get supplied.--(\"Pereira's Materia Medica.\")\r\n\r\nIn the southern part of Japan the tree grows in such abundance that,\r\nnotwithstanding the great consumption of it in the country, large\r\nquantities are exported. Koempfer says, that the Japanese camphor is\r\nmade by a simple decoction of the wood and roots, but bears no\r\nproportion in value to that of Borneo. There is also an imitation of\r\ncamphor in Japan, but every body can distinguish it from the genuine.\r\n\r\nThe camphor of Sumatra is procured from the stem of a large tree,\r\n_Dryobalanops Camphora_, Colebrook; _D. aromatica_, Graertner. It is\r\nsecreted in crystalline masses naturally into cavities of the wood. It\r\nsupplies this camphor only after attaining a considerable age. In its\r\nyoung state it yields, however, by incision, a pale yellow liquid,\r\ncalled the liquid camphor of Borneo and Sumatra, which consists of\r\nresin and a volatile oil having a camphorated odor.\r\n\r\nAn account of this tree, and of the mode of procuring the peculiar and\r\nhigh-priced camphor which it yields, is given by Dr. Junghuhn, who has\r\ntravelled lately in Sumatra, and Prof. De Vriese, of Leyden, in the\r\n\"Nederlandsch Kruidkundig Archief\" for 1851. An abstract of the\r\nmemoir, translated into English by Miss De Vriese, is published in\r\n\"Hooker's Journal of Botany \" for February and March 1852:--\r\n\r\n    The Dryobalanops is a gigantic tree, rising for fifty or even a\r\n    hundred feet above those which compose the chief mass of the forests\r\n    where they grow, just as the steeples of the churches appear above\r\n    the roofs of the houses in a town. The trunks of the full-grown\r\n    trees are from 7 to 10 feet in diameter at the very base, and from 5\r\n    to 8 feet higher up; they rise to the height of 100 or 130 feet, and\r\n    their ample crown is from 50 to 70 feet in diameter. The tree has a\r\n    limited range, being confined to the seaward slope of the mountains\r\n    of southwestern Sumatra, most abundant on the lower slopes and the\r\n    outlying hills of the alluvial plain, and extending in latitude from\r\n    1deg. 10m. to 2deg. 20m. N., and perhaps further to the north.\r\n    Camphor oil occurs in all the trees, and is most abundant in the\r\n    younger branches and leaves. The solid camphor is found only on the\r\n    trunks of older trees, especially in fissures of the wood, and in\r\n    smaller quantity than is generally supposed. Colebrooke, and authors\r\n    who have copied from him, assert that camphor is found in the heart\r\n    of the tree in such a quantity as to fill a cavity of the thickness\r\n    of a man's arm, and that a single tree yields about eleven pounds.\r\n    The price of this camphor, which at Padang sells for about 340\r\n    dollars per hundred weight, suffices to show that the account is\r\n    much exaggerated. The camphor occurs only in small fissures, from\r\n    which the natives, having felled the trees and split up the wood,\r\n    scrape it off with small splinters or with their nails. From the\r\n    oldest and richest trees they rarely collect more than two ounces.\r\n    After a long stay in the woods, frequently of three months, during\r\n    which they may fell a hundred trees, a party of thirty persons\r\n    rarely bring away more than 15 or 20 pounds of solid camphor, worth\r\n    from 200 to 250 dollars. The variety and price of this costly\r\n    substance are enhanced by a custom which has immemorially prevailed\r\n    among the Battas, of delaying the burial of every person who during\r\n    his life had a claim to the title of Rajah (of which each village\r\n    has one) until some rice, sown on the day of his death, has sprung\r\n    up, grown and borne fruit. The corpse, till then kept above ground\r\n    among the living, is now, with these ears of rice, committed to the\r\n    earth, like the grain six months before; and thus the hope is\r\n    emblematically expressed that, as a new life arises from the seed,\r\n    so another life shall begin for man after his death. During this\r\n    time the corpse is kept in the house, enclosed in a coffin made of\r\n    the hollowed trunk of a Durion, and the whole space between the\r\n    coffin and the body is filled with pounded camphor, for the purchase\r\n    of which the family of the deceased Rajah frequently impoverish\r\n    themselves. The camphor oil is collected by incisions at the base of\r\n    the trunk, from which the clear balsamic juice is very slowly\r\n    discharged.\r\n\r\nIn Sumatra the best camphor is obtained in a district called Barus,\r\nand all good camphor bears that local name. It appears that the tree\r\nis cut down to obtain the gum and that not in one tenth of the trees\r\nis it found. Barus camphor is getting scarce, as the tree must be\r\ndestroyed before it is ascertained whether it is productive or not.\r\nAbout 800 piculs are annually sent to China. The proportion between\r\nMalay and Chinese camphor is as eighteen to one; the former is more\r\nfragrant and not so pungent as the latter.\r\n\r\nNine hundred and eighty-three tubs of camphor were exported from Java\r\nin 1843; 625 bales were imported in 1843, the produce of the Japanese\r\nempire; and 559 piculs exported from Canton in 1844.\r\n\r\nThe price of unrefined camphor in the Liverpool market in July, 1853,\r\nwas £4 to £4 10s. the cwt. There have been no imports there direct in\r\nthe last two years.\r\n\r\n    Camphor (says Dr. Ure) is found in a great many plants and is\r\n    secreted in parity by several laurels; it occurs combined with the\r\n    essential oils of many of the _labiacæ_; but it is extracted for\r\n    manufacturing purposes only from the _Laurus Camphora_, which\r\n    abounds in China and Japan, as well as from a tree which grows in\r\n    Sumatra and Borneo, called in the country _kapur barus_, from the\r\n    name of the place where it is most common. The camphor exists, ready\r\n    formed, in these vegetables between the wood and the bark; but it\r\n    does not exude spontaneously. On cleaving the tree _Laurus\r\n    Sumatrensis (Qy. Dryobalanops Camphora)_, masses of camphor are\r\n    found in the pith. The wood of the Laurus is cut into small pieces\r\n    and put, with plenty of water, into large iron boilers, which are\r\n    covered with an earthen capital or dome, lined within with rice\r\n    straw. As the water boils, the camphor rises with the steam, and\r\n    attaches itself as a sublimate to the stalks, under the form of\r\n    granulations of a grey color. In this state it is picked off the\r\n    straw and packed up for exportation to Europe.\"--(\" Dictionary of\r\n    Arts and Manufactures.\")\r\n\r\nThe price of camphor at Canton in July, 1850, was from fourteen to\r\nfifteen dollars per picul.\r\n\r\nCinchona.--Peruvian or Jesuit's Bark--One of the most valuable and\r\npowerful astringents and tonics used in medicine, is the produce of\r\nseveral species of cinchona, natives of the Andes, from 11 north\r\nlatitude to 20 south latitude, at elevations varying from 1,200 to\r\n10,000 feet above the level of the sea, and in a dry rocky soil. There\r\nare at least twelve trees which are supposed to furnish the barks of\r\ncommerce, and great obscurity prevails as to the species whence the\r\nvarious kinds of cinchona bark are derived. The names of yellow, red,\r\nand pale bark have been very vaguely applied, and are by no means well\r\ndefined. Dr. Lindley mentions twenty-six varieties; of which\r\ntwenty-one are well known. The barks are met with either in thick,\r\nlarge, flat pieces, or in thinner pieces, which curl inwards during\r\ndrying, and are called quilled.\r\n\r\nQuinine is one of the most important of the vegetable alkaline\r\nbitters. It was first discovered by Vauquelin, in 1811, and its\r\npreparation on a large scale pointed out by Pelletier and Caventon in\r\n1820. It is obtained by boiling the yellow bark (_Cinchona_) in water\r\nand sulphuric acid, and then treating it with lime and alcohol, when\r\nthe quinine is precipitated in the form of a white powder. Upwards of\r\n120,000 ounces are made annually in Paris.\r\n\r\nCinchona, or the Peruvian bark, was gathered to the amount of two\r\nmillion dollars in one year recently, and the demand is constantly\r\nincreasing.\r\n\r\nPeruvian bark is cut in the eastern Provinces of Bolivia, skirting the\r\nriver Paraguay, and now conveyed an immense distance by mules over a\r\nmountainous region to El Puerto, the only port of Bolivia on the\r\nPacific. It is thence brought by Cape Horn to the cities of the United\r\nStates and Europe. Now that Government has been successful in opening\r\nthe South American rivers, this important article of commerce will be\r\nfurnished in market by the Paraguay and La Plata rivers, at a much\r\nreduced price.\r\n\r\nA species of bark from Colombia, known as Malambo or Matias bark, has\r\nbeen frequently administered by Dr. Alexander Ure as a substitute for\r\ncinchona with good effect. It offers the useful combination of a tonic\r\nand aromatic. It is supposed to be the produce of a species of\r\n_Drimys_. It is stated that in New Granada, and other districts of\r\nCentral America, where the tree is indigenous, incisions are made in\r\nthe bark, and there exudes an aromatic oil which sinks in water.\r\n\r\nCinchona bark contains two alkaloids, cinchonia and quina, to which\r\nits active properties are due; the former is best obtained from gray\r\nbark, the latter from yellow bark. In combination with these there\r\nexists an acid called kinic acid.\r\n\r\nThe imports of cinchona bark to this country are from 225,000 to\r\n556,000 lbs. annually, and about 120,000 lbs. are retained for home\r\nconsumption. It comes over in chests and serons, or ox-hides, varying\r\nfrom 90 to 200 lbs. We imported from France, in 1850, 489 cwt. of\r\nPeruvian bark, of the value of £6,840; and in 1851, 1,128 cwt., of the\r\nvalue of £15,787; also the following quantities of sulphate of\r\nquinine, on which there is a duty of 6d. and 3-10ths per ounce.\r\n\r\n           oz.      £\r\n  1848   3,856    5,898\r\n  1849   1,114    1,560\r\n  1850   8,976   12,566\r\n  1851   7,605   10,647\r\n\r\nThe following is the arrangement of these barks adopted by Pereira,\r\nwho has gone very fully into the subject:--\r\n\r\n    A. True cinchonas, with a brown epidermis.\r\n\r\n    I. Pale barks 1. Crown or Loxa bark. _C. Condaminea_. 2. Gray or\r\n    silver or Huanuco bark. _C. micrantha_. 3.

Red bark. _C. sp ?_\r\n\r\n    B. True cinchonas, with a white epidermis.\r\n\r\n    I. Pale barks. 7. White Loxa bark.\r\n\r\n    II. Yellow barks. 8. Hard Carthagena bark. _C. cordifolia_. 9.\r\n    Fibrous ditto. Perhaps _C. cordifolia_. 10. Cuzco bark. _C. sp.?_\r\n    11. Orange bark of Santa Fe. _C. lancifolia_.\r\n\r\n    III. Red barks. 12. Bed bark of Santa Fe. _C. oblongifolia_.\r\n\r\nThe genus Exostemma yields various kinds of false cinchona bark, which\r\ndo not contain the cinchona alkalies. The following are some of the\r\nkinds noticed by Pereira:--\r\n\r\n  1. St. Lucia or Piton bark. _Exostemma floribundum_.\r\n  2. Jamaica bark. _E. caribaeum_.\r\n  3. Pitaya bark. _E. sp?_\r\n  4. False Peruvian bark. _E. peruvianum_.\r\n  5. Brazilian bark. _E. souzianum_.\r\n\r\nThe mode adopted by the bark-peelers of obtaining cinchona varies\r\nsomewhat in different districts. The Indians (says Mr. Stevenson,\r\n\"Twenty Years' Residence in South America\") discover from the\r\neminences where a cluster of trees grow in the woods, for they are\r\neasily discernable by the rose-colored tinge of their leaves, which\r\nappear at a distance like bunches of flowers amid the deep-green\r\nfoliage of other trees. They then hunt for the spot, and having found\r\nit out, cut down all the trees, and take the bark from the branches,\r\nand after they have stripped off the bark, they carry it in bundles\r\nout of the wood, for the purpose of drying it. The peelers commence\r\ntheir operation about May, when the dry season sets in. Some writers\r\nstate that the trees are barked without felling.\r\n\r\nIn a letter published in one of the Calcutta papers not long ago, from\r\nthe pen, I believe, of Mr. Piddington, he strongly urged the\r\nintroduction of the cinchona tree into British India:--\r\n\r\n    There is (he observes) one tree, the introduction and the copious\r\n    distribution of which within certain appropriate points of the\r\n    sub-Himalayan range, \"would confer a greater blessing on the great\r\n    body of natives, than any effort the Government has made or can\r\n    make, and that is the cinchona bark tree.\r\n\r\n    Without any reference to the greater or less force of medical\r\n    theories as to the efficacy of cinchona bark, I now only take an\r\n    experienced and practical view, well knowing that the sufferings of\r\n    many millions of poor and rich natives, especially in the jungle\r\n    districts, are yearly very great, and the mortality quite enormous\r\n    from remittent and intermittent fevers, by far the greater part of\r\n    which would be immensely relieved, or wholly cured, by the free use\r\n    of cinchona bark.\r\n\r\n    If by abundance the price be once brought within the poor native's\r\n    reach, he will readily take to it, having no objection whatever on\r\n    account of caste to anything of the nature of the bark of a tree.\r\n\r\n    If the cinchona tree were once growing in abundance, quinine could\r\n    be easily prepared in India, from the facility of procuring, and\r\n    cheapness of spirits of wine used in the process of its elimination.\r\n\r\n    I take it that every hundred Sepahees sick of fevers remaining in\r\n    hospital off duty for thirty days, drawing an average pay of eight\r\n    rupees each, form a full monthly loss to Government of eight hundred\r\n    rupees; while a free use of quinine and bark would cure them in ten\r\n    days on the average, costing at present about forty rupees; thus by\r\n    the twenty days' services gained, Government would save nearly five\r\n    hundred rupees.\r\n\r\n    But the cinchona tree once glowing abundantly, quinine would of\r\n    course become infinitely cheaper.\r\n\r\n    Under a proper system of culture, quill bark only need be taken\r\n    without destroying the trees, and an earlier return be obtained.\r\n\r\n    There never yet has been a substitute found for cinchona bark and\r\n    its salts, as an antiperiodic and tonic.\r\n\r\n    It yet remains for some one to find an equally efficacious\r\n    substitute, and thus make a fortune. In the mean time the importance\r\n    of the cinchona is paramount.\r\n\r\n    The cinchona tree, like the pimento, deteriorates under cultivation,\r\n    and in moist, warm, rich valleys the bark becomes inert. The best\r\n    bark is from trees growing on mountain tops or steep declivities.\r\n\r\n    From the full accounts of Condamine, Mutis, and Humboldt, a soil and\r\n    climate like that of the north west sub-Himalayan range is admirably\r\n    adapted to the planting and prospering of cinchona trees.\r\n\r\n    In Lord W. Bentinck's time, before there were steamers in or to\r\n    India, seeing the immense benefit to be derived, I sent in a\r\n    proposition to procure young cinchona plants from Vera Cruz, begging\r\n    to be then permitted to proceed there on that account, and my\r\n    proposition was civilly and even favorably received; but these were\r\n    not the days to act on it.\r\n\r\n    Of about the twenty species of cinchona trees the following would of\r\n    course be the best to bring--the _Cinchona bineifolia_, the\r\n    _cinchona cordifolia_, the _cinchona oblongifolia_, the _cinchona\r\n    micrantha_, and the _cinchona condaminea_.\r\n\r\nThe Calumba plant (_Cocculus palmatus_, Decandolle, or _Minispermum\r\npalmatum_) furnishes the medicinal Colombo root, which is one of the\r\nmost useful stomachics and tonics in cases of dyspepsia. It is\r\nscarcely ever cultivated, the spontaneous produce of thick forests on\r\nthe shores of Oibo and Mozambique and many miles inland on the eastern\r\nshores of Africa, Madagascar and Bombay, proving sufficient. The\r\nsupplies principally go to Ceylon. The roots are perennial, and\r\nconsist of several fasciculated, fusiform, branched, fleshy, curved\r\nand descending tubers, from one to two inches thick, with a brown\r\nwarty epidermis; internally deep yellow, odorless, very bitter.\r\n\r\nThe main roots are dug up by the natives in March (the hot season).\r\nThe offsets are cut in slices and hung up on cords to dry in the\r\nshade. It is deemed fit to ship when, on exposure to the sun, it\r\nbreaks short, and of a bad quality when it is soft and\r\nblack.--(\"Pereira's Materia Medica.\")\r\n\r\nIt contains a bitter crystallizable principle called Calumbin.\r\n\r\nThe commercial parcels are often adulterated with the roots of _Costus\r\nindicus, C. speciosus_, and _C. Arabicus_ (Kusmus, Putckuk, &c.). It\r\nis imported into this country in bags and chests of from one to three\r\ncwt., and ranges in price from £1 to £2 the cwt. The imports in 1846\r\nto London were 82 packages, and in 1850, 214 packages, but the stock\r\nheld in London is always large, being nearly 2,500 packages.\r\n\r\nColocynth, furnished by _Cucumis colocynthis_ and _C.\r\npseudocolocynthis_, is the dried medullary part of a wild species of\r\ngourd which is cultivated in Spain. It also grows wild in Japan, the\r\nsandy lands of Coromandel, Cape of Good Hope, Syria, Nubia, Egypt,\r\nTurkey, and the islands of the Grecian Archipelago. It may be obtained\r\nin the jungles of India in cart loads. The fruit, which is about the\r\nsize of an orange, with a thin but solid rind, is gathered in autumn,\r\nwhen ripe and yellow, and in most countries is peeled and dried either\r\nin the sun or by stoves. It comes over from Cadiz, Trieste, Mogadore,\r\n&c., in cases, casks, &c., and duty was paid on about 11,000 lbs. in\r\n1839.\r\n\r\nCUBEBS.--The dried unripe fruit of _P. Cubebi_, or _Cubeba\r\nqfficinalia_, a climbing plant of the pepper tribe, native of Prince\r\nof Wales' Island, Java, and the Indian islands furnishes the medicinal\r\ncubebs, which is used extensively in arresting discharges from mucous\r\nmembranes. In appearance cubebs resemble black pepper, except that\r\nthey are higher colored and are each furnished with a stalk two or\r\nthree lines long. Dr. Blume says, that the cubebs of the shops are the\r\nfruit of _P. caninum_. This species of pepper, when fresh and good,\r\ncontains nearly 10 per cent. of essential oil.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 the quantity entered for home consumption was 67,093 lbs. The\r\naverage imports are about 40 to 50 tons annually. 3 cases were\r\nimported into Liverpool in 1851. The price in the Liverpool market, in\r\nJanuary 1853, was £3 10s. to £4 10s. the cwt.\r\n\r\nGAMBOGE.--This resinous juice, which is a most important article of\r\ncommerce, is furnished by some of the plants of Gambogia, natives\r\nprincipally of South America. It is a powerful irritant, and is\r\nemployed medicinally as a drastic and hydragogue cathartic. From its\r\nbright yellow color it is also used as a pigment.\r\n\r\nGamboge fetches in the London market from £5 to £11 per cwt.\r\n\r\nSome of the species of _Stalagmites_ (Murray), natives of Ceylon and\r\nthe East, yield a similar yellow viscid juice, hardly distinguishable\r\nfrom gamboge, and used for the same purpose by painters. They are a\r\ngenus of fine ornamental trees, thriving well in soils partaking of a\r\nmixture of loam and peat.\r\n\r\nAccording to Koenig, the juice is collected by breaking off the leaves\r\nor young branches. From the fracture the gamboge exudes in drops, and\r\nis therefore called _gum gutta_. It is received on leaves, coco-nut\r\nshells, earthen pots, or in bamboos; it gradually hardens by age, and\r\nis then wrapped up in leaves prior to sale.\r\n\r\nThe common gamboge of Ceylon is produced by a plant which Dr. Graham\r\nwas led to view as a species of a new genus under the name of\r\n_Hebradendron Gambogoides_. A very different species, the _Garcinia\r\nGambogia_, of Roxburgh, once supposed to produce gamboge, and indeed\r\nactually confounded by Linnæus with the true gamboge tree of Ceylon,\r\nhe has proved not to produce gamboge at all.\r\n\r\nThis substance is also obtained from several other plants, as the\r\n_Mangostana Gambogia_ (Gaertner), _Hypericwm bacciferum_ and\r\n_Cayanense_, natives of the East Indies, Siam and Ceylon, whence it is\r\nimported in small cakes and rolls or cylindrical twisted masses. Its\r\ncomposition is as follows: number 1 being an analysis by Professor\r\nChristison of a commercial specimen from Ceylon; number 2 of a fine\r\nsample of common ditto:--\r\n\r\n                           1       2\r\n  Resin, or fatty acid   78.84   74.8\r\n  Coloring matter         4.03    3.5\r\n  Gum                    12.59   16.5\r\n  Residue                 4.54    5.2\r\n                         -----  -----\r\n                        100.    100.\r\n\r\nThe average imports of gamboge into the port of London, during the\r\npast five or six years, have been from 400 to 500 chests of one to two\r\ncwt. each.\r\n\r\nGentian.--The yellow gentian root (_Gentiana lutea_) is the officinal\r\nspecies, and a native of the Alps of Austria and Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThe stems and roots of _G. amarella_ and _campestris_, British\r\nspecies, and _G. cruciata, purpurea, punctata_, &c., are similar in\r\ntheir effects, having tonic, stomachic, and febrifugal properties. So\r\nhas _G. kurroo_ of the Himalayas. The root is generally taken up in\r\nautumn, when the plant is a year old. It is cut longitudinally into\r\npieces of a foot or a foot and a half long. They are imported into\r\nthis country in bales from Havre, Marseilles, &c., and a good deal\r\ncomes from Germany. In 1839, 470 cwts. were entered for home\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\nChiretta is the herb and root of _Agathotes Chirayta_, Don; _Gentiana\r\nChirayta_, Fleming; or _Ophelia chirayta_, a herbaceous plant, growing\r\nin the Himalaya mountains about Nepaul and the Morungs.\r\n\r\nIpecacuan.-- _Cephælis Ipecacuanhæ_, Richard, yields the ipecacuan of\r\nthe shops. The plant is met with in the woods of several Brazilian\r\nprovinces, as Pernambuco, Bahia and Rio Janeiro. It is found growing\r\nin moist shady situations, from 8 to 20 degs. south latitude. The\r\nroots, which are the officinal part, are contorted, knotty and\r\nannulated, and about the thickness of a goose quill.\r\n\r\nBesides this brown or gray annulated ipecacuan, there are spurious\r\nkinds, such as the striated or black Peruvian, the produce of\r\n_Pyschotria elliptica_, and other species; and white or amylaceous\r\nipecacuan, furnished by _Richardsonia scabra_, an herbaceous\r\nperennial, native of the provinces of Rio Janeiro and Minas Geraes.\r\n_Manettia glabra_ or _cordifolia_, also furnishes ipecacuan in Buenos\r\nAyres. It is imported into this country from Rio in bales, barrels,\r\nbags, and serons, and the average annual imports in the eight years\r\nending in 1841 were 10,000 lbs. In 1840, the shipments from Rio were\r\nas much as 20,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nCastelnau states, that one expert hand can gather 15 lbs. of the\r\nipecacuan root in a day, which will fetch in Rio one dollar per pound.\r\nHe estimates that, from 1830 to 1837, not less than 800,000 lbs. of\r\nthis drug were exported from the province of Matto Grosso to Rio.\r\n\r\nJalap.--This drug is obtained from the dried tubers or root-stock of\r\n_Ipomoea Jalapa_ or _Convolvulus Jalapa_, a perennial plant, native of\r\nAmerica. Some suppose it takes its specific name from Xalapa, in\r\nMexico, whence we chiefly import it. It grows in the woods near\r\nChicanquiaco, at an altitude of 6,000 feet above the level of the sea.\r\nLarge quantities might be gathered and exported in Jamaica. The root\r\nis of a roundish tuberous form, black externally, and of a deep,\r\nyellowish grey within, and varies in size from that of a walnut to\r\nthat of a moderate sized turnip. It contains a resin in which its\r\nactive properties reside. It is brought to this country in thin\r\ntransverse slices, and the amount entered for home consumption is\r\nabout 45,000 lbs. a year. It is imported in bales, from Vera Cruz\r\ndirect, or indirectly by way of New York, and other places.\r\n\r\nTwo sorts of jalap root occur in commerce. The one which was first\r\nintroduced into the market, and which is even at the present day most\r\nfrequently met with, is obtained from the _Ipomoea Schiedeana_ of\r\nZuccarini, a plant growing on the eastern declivity of the Mexican\r\nAndes, and discovered by Von Schiedes. The root, as met with in\r\ncommerce, consists of pieces varying from the size of a nut to that of\r\nthe fist, sometimes whole, sometimes cut into disks, and at other\r\ntimes divided into two or three portions. The external surface is of a\r\nmore or less dark gray brown color, corrugated and rough. It is very\r\nhard, presents a shining resinous even surface when broken, and is\r\ndifficult to reduce to powder. The powder is of a brownish color, has\r\na faint peculiar odor and irritant taste.\r\n\r\nThe second quality, which was introduced into commerce is great\r\nquantities a few years ago, by the name of stalk jalap, is now more\r\nscarce, and obtained from the _Ipomoea orazabensis_ of Pelletan, a\r\nplant growing without cultivation in the neighbourhood of the Mexican\r\ntown of Orizaba. The root, as met with in the trade, consists of\r\npieces varying from one to three inches in length, and 1½ to two\r\ninches in diameter. They are of a higher color than the first-named\r\nroot, and of decidedly fibrous structure. The chief constituents of\r\nboth varieties is a peculiar resin, of which they contain about 10 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nScammony.--The root of _Convolvulus Scammonia_, another plant of the\r\nsame family, affords, when cut, a gummy resinous exudation or milky\r\njuice, which soon concretes and forms scammony. The plant grows\r\nabundantly in Greece, the Grecian Islands, and various parts of the\r\nLevant. It is imported from Aleppo in drums, weighing from 75 to 125\r\nlbs. each, and from Smyrna in compact cakes like wax packed in chests.\r\nIn 1839, the quantity on which duty (2s. 6d. per lb.) was paid\r\namounted to 8,581 lbs. The duty received for scammony, in 1842, was\r\n£607. A spurious kind is prepared from _Calystegia (Convolvulus)\r\nsepium_, a native of Australia, and several plants of the Asclepiadacæ\r\norder.\r\n\r\nDr. Russell (\"Med. Obs. and Inqui.\") thus describes the mode of\r\nprocuring scammony:--\r\n\r\n    Having cleared away the earth from the upper part of the root, the\r\n    peasants cut off the top in an oblique direction, about two inches\r\n    below where the stalks spring from it. Under the most depending part\r\n    of the slope they affix a shell, or some other convenient\r\n    receptacle, into which the milky juice flows. It is then left about\r\n    twelve hours, which time is sufficient for the drawing off of the\r\n    whole juice; this, however, is in small quantities, each root\r\n    affording but a few drachms. This milky juice from the several roots\r\n    is put together, often into the leg of an old boot, for want of some\r\n    more proper vessel, when in a little time it grows hard, and is the\r\n    genuine scammony. Various substances are often added to scammony\r\n    while yet soft. Those with which it is most usually adulterated are\r\n    wheat flour, ashes, or fine sand and chalk.\r\n\r\nLiquorice.--The plant which yields the liquorice root of commerce is\r\n_Glycirrhiza glabra_ or _Liquiritia officinalis_. It is a native of\r\nItaly and the southern parts of Europe, but has been occasionally\r\ncultivated with success in Britain, especially at Pontefract, in\r\nYorkshire, and at Mitcham, in Surrey. The plant is a perennial, with\r\npale blue flowers. It grows well in a deep, light, sandy loam, and is\r\nreadily increased by slips from the roots with eyes. The root, which\r\nis the only valuable part, is long, slender, fibrous, of a yellow\r\ncolor, and when grown in England is fit for use at the end of three\r\nyears. The sweet, subacid, mucilaginous juice is much esteemed as a\r\npectoral. It owes its sweetness to a peculiar principle called glycrin\r\nor glycirrhiza, which appears also to be present in the root and\r\nleaves of other papilionaceous plants, as _G. echinata_ and\r\n_glandulifera, Trifoliwm alpinum_, and the wild liquorice of the West\r\nIndies, _Abrus precatorius_, a pretty climber.\r\n\r\nThe greatest portion of our supplies of the extract, which amount to\r\n7,000 or 8,000 cwts. a year, are obtained from Spain and Sicily. The\r\njuice, obtained by crushing the roots in a mill, and subjecting them\r\nto the press, is slowly boiled, till it becomes of a proper\r\nconsistency, when it is formed into rolls of a considerable thickness,\r\nwhich are usually covered with bay leaves. It is afterwards usually\r\nre-dissolved, purified, and, when formed into small quills, is known\r\nas refined liquorice.\r\n\r\nIn 1839, 1,166 tons of liquorice paste were exported from Naples,\r\nvalued at £45 per ton. Mr. Poole, in his Statistics of Commerce,\r\nstates that the consumption of liquorice root and paste in this\r\ncountry averages 500 tons per annum. 110 cwt. of the juice and 100\r\ncwt. of the root are annually brought into Hull from the continent.\r\n\r\nMatico--the Peruvian styptic, a powerful vegetable astringent, was\r\nfirst made known to the medical profession of England by Dr. Jeffreys,\r\nof Liverpool, in the _Lancet_, as far back as January 5th, 1839. A\r\npaper on its history and power was published in May, 1843, in the\r\n\"Transactions of the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association,\"\r\nvol. 10. It is stated to be the _Piper angustifolium_ of Ruiz and\r\nParsons. Dr. Martin believes it to be a species of _Phlomis_. The\r\nleaves are covered with a fine hair.\r\n\r\nThe powdered leaves of the _Eupatorium glutinosum_, under the name of\r\nMatico, are used about Quito for stanching blood and healing wounds. A\r\ngood article on the pharmaceutical and chemical character of matico,\r\nby Dr. J.F. Hodges, appeared in the \"Proceedings of the Chemical\r\nSociety of London,\" in 1845. It is stated, by Dr. Martin, that, like\r\nthe gunjah, which the East Indians prepare, from the _Cannabis\r\nIndica_, the leaves and flowers of the matico have been long employed\r\nby the sensual Indians of the interior of Peru to prepare a drink\r\nwhich they administer to produce a state of aphrodisia. The leaves and\r\nflowering tops of the plant are the parts imported and introduced to\r\nnotice as a styptic, which property seems to depend on their structure\r\nand not on their chemical composition.\r\n\r\nQuassia.--The quassia wood of the pharmacopoeia was originally the\r\nproduct of _Quassia amara_, a tall shrub, never above fifteen feet\r\nhigh, native of Guiana, but also inhabiting Surinam and Colombia. It\r\nis a very ornamental plant, and has remarkable pinnate leaves with\r\nwinged petioles. This wood is well known as one of the most intense\r\nbitters, and is considered an effectual remedy in any disorder where\r\npure bitters are required. Surinam quassia is not, however, to be met\r\nwith now. That sold in the shops is the tough, fibrous, bitter bark of\r\nthe root of _Simaruba (Quassia) excelsa_ and _officinalis_, very large\r\nforest trees, growing in Cayenne, Jamaica, and other parts of the West\r\nIndia Islands, where they bear the local name of bitter-wood. Its\r\ninfusion is used as a tonic. 23 tons of bitter-wood were shipped from\r\nMontego Bay, Jamaica, in 1851. Quassia acts as a narcotic poison on\r\nflies and other insects. Although prohibited by law, it is frequently\r\nemployed by brewers as a substitute for hops. The duty of £8 17s. 6d.\r\nper cwt., levied on quassia, is intended to restrict its use for such\r\na purpose.\r\n\r\nRhubarb.--This most important plant belongs to the genus Rheum. The\r\nofficinal rhubarb is the root of an undetermined species. There are\r\nabout thirteen different kinds which are said to yield rhubarb.\r\nLindley enumerates fifteen. I however take Professor Balfour's\r\nclassification:--\r\n\r\n    1. _Rheum palmatum_, native of Bucharia, which has perhaps the best\r\n    title to be considered the true rhubarb-plant, grows spontaneously\r\n    in the Mongolian empire on the confines of China.\r\n\r\n    2. _R. undulatum_, native of China, which yields much of the French\r\n    rhubarb.\r\n\r\n    3. _R. compactum_, native of Tartary, another species yielding\r\n    French rhubarb, and often cultivated in Britain for its acid\r\n    petioles.\r\n\r\n    4. _R. Emodi_ (Wallich). This species yields a kind of Himalayan\r\n    rhubarb. Its petioles are much used for their acid properties.\r\n\r\n    5. _R. Rhaponticum_, native of Asia. Used in France and Britain in\r\n    the same way as the third species. It is much cultivated in the\r\n    department of Morbihan.\r\n\r\n    6. _R. hybridum_ (Murr). Much cultivated in Germany for its root and\r\n    in Britain for its stalks.\r\n\r\n    7. _R. Webbianum_ (Royle). 8. _R. Spiceformi_ (Royle). 9. _R.\r\n    Moorcroftianum_ (Royle). Himalayan species or varieties.\r\n\r\n    10. _R. crassinervium_ (Fisch), a Russian species.\r\n\r\n    11. _R. leucorhizum_ (Pall), a Siberian and Altai species, said to\r\n    yield imperial or white rhubarb. It has striped flowers, while all\r\n    others are whitish green.\r\n\r\n    12. _R. Caspicum_ (Fisch), a Russian and Altai species.\r\n\r\n    13. _R. Ribes_, native of the Levant, but some say an Afghanistan or\r\n    Persian species.\r\n\r\nAll these grow in the cold parts of the world, as on the Altai\r\nmountains, in Siberia, Thibet, North of China, and on the Himalayan\r\nrange. The rhubarb procured from one or more of these species is known\r\nin commerce under the names of Russian or Turkey, Chinese or East\r\nIndian, and English rhubarb.\r\n\r\nThe plants all thrive well in a rich loamy soil, or light sandy soil,\r\nand are increased by divisions of the roots or by seed.\r\n\r\nThe extent of country from which rhubarb of one kind or another is\r\nactually collected, according to Christison, stretches from Ludall, in\r\n77½ east longitude, to the Chinese province of Shen-si, 29 degrees\r\nfurther east, and from the Sue-chan mountains, in north latitude 26\r\ndegrees, nearly to the frontiers of Siberia, 24 degrees northward. The\r\nbest rhubarb is said to come from the very heart of Thibet, within 95\r\ndegrees east longitude and 35 degrees north latitude, 500 or 600 miles\r\nnorth of Assam.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese rhubarb is inferior to that of Russia and Turkey. The\r\nprice varies in China from 38 dollars per picul upwards, and about\r\n1,500 piculs are annually exported, on an average at 50 dollars per\r\npicul. In 1844, 2,077 piculs were shipped from Canton for Great\r\nBritain; and of 95,701 lbs. imported in 1841, 43,640 lbs. were brought\r\nfrom China, 8,349 lbs. from the Philippines, 7,290 lbs. from the East\r\nIndies, and 33,710 lbs. from the United States; only 1,462 lbs. were\r\nbrought from Russia. The imports from the East Indies have decreased\r\nmore than 70 per cent. in the last twelve years, as compared with the\r\npreceding. The wholesale prices are, for round rhubarb, 8d. to 3s. per\r\nlb.; flat, 6d. to 3s. 3d. per lb.; Dutch trimmed, 6s. to 7s. per lb.;\r\nRussian, 13s. to 13s. 6d. per lb.\r\n\r\nIn 1831, we imported 133,462 lbs. from the East India Company's\r\npossessions, and 6,901 lbs. from Russia.

In autumn all the dried rhubarb collected in the province is\r\nbrought in horsehair sacks, containing about 200 lbs., to Sinin (the\r\nresidence of the dealers), loaded on camels, and sent over Mongolia to\r\nKiachta, and the ports and capital of China.\r\n\r\nSarsaparilla.--The root of various species of _Smilax_ constitutes the\r\nsarsaparilla of the shops. It is an evergreen climbing undershrub,\r\nhaving whitish green flowers, and grows readily from suckers. It is a\r\nnative of the temperate and tropical regions of Asia and America. The\r\nofficinal part is the bark, which comes off from the rhizomes. They\r\nare mucilaginous, bitter, and slightly acid. Sarsaparilla is used in\r\ndecoction and infusion as a tonic and alterative. The following are\r\nenumerated as sources whence sarsaparilla of various kinds is derived.\r\n\r\n_Smilax China_ and _sagittæfolia_, yielding the Chinese root, are said\r\nto come from the province of Onansi in China.\r\n\r\n_S. pseudo China, S. Sarsaparilla, S. rubens_, and _S. Watsoni,_\r\nfurnish the drug of North America.\r\n\r\nThe sarsaparilla distinguished in commerce as the Lisbon or Brazilian\r\nis the root of _S. papyracea_ of Poiret. It is an undershrub, the stem\r\nof which is compressed and angular below, and armed with prickles at\r\nthe angles. The leaves are elliptic, acuminate, and marked with three\r\nlongitudinal nerves. This species grows principally in the regions\r\nbordering the river Amazon, and on the banks of most of its tributary\r\nstreams. It is generally brought from the provinces of Para and\r\nMaranham. It is in large cylindrical bundles, long and straight, and\r\nthe flexible stem of the plant is bound round the bundles, so as to\r\nentirely cover them. Its fibres are very long, cylindrical, wrinkled\r\nlongitudinally, and furnished with some lateral fibrils. Its color is\r\nof a fawn brown, or sometimes of a dark grey, approaching to black.\r\nThe color internally is nearly white. Besides this species there are\r\nothers indigenous, such as _S. officinalis_, which grows in the\r\nprovince of Mina; _S. syphilitica_, which grows in the northern\r\nregions, and three new species, _S. japicanga, S. Brasiliensis_, and\r\n_S_. _syringioides_. There is also met with in Brazil another plant,\r\n_Herreria sarsaparilla_, belonging to the same natural order, which\r\nabounds in the provinces of Rio, Bahia, and Mina, and the roots of\r\nwhich receive the name of wild sarsaparilla.\r\n\r\nFrom Mexico, Honduras, and Angostura very good qualities are imported.\r\n_S. zeylanica, glabra_, and _perfoliata_ furnish sarsaparilla from\r\nAsia, and _S. excelsa_ and _aspera_ are used as substitutes for the\r\nofficinal drug in Europe.\r\n\r\n_Smilax officinalis_, found in woods near the Rio Magdalena in New\r\nGranada, furnishes the best in the market, which is commonly known as\r\nJamaica Sarza. It differs from the other kinds in having a deep red\r\ncuticle of a close texture, and the color is more generally diffused\r\nthrough the ligneous part. It is shipped in bales, formed either of\r\nthe spirally formed roots, as in the Jamaica and Lima varieties, or of\r\nunfolded parallel roots, as in the Brazilian varieties. The roots are\r\nusually several feet long, about the thickness of a quill, more or\r\nless wrinkled, and the whole quantity retained for home consumption,\r\nin 1840, was 143,000 lbs. In 1844, 184,748 lbs., and in 1845 111,775\r\nlbs. were shipped from Honduras.\r\n\r\nThe prices in the London market, at the close of 1853, were --Brazil,\r\n1s. 3d. per lb.; Honduras, 1s. 3d. to 1s. 8d. per lb.; Vera Cruz, 6d.\r\nto 11d. per lb.; Jamaica, 1s. 8d. to 3s. 4d. per lb. The duty received\r\non sarsaparilla in 1842 was £1,536.\r\n\r\nThe average annual quantity of sarsaparilla obtained from Mexico and\r\nSouth America, exclusive of Brazil, and taken for home consumption, in\r\nthe twelve years ending with 1843 was 37,826 lbs.\r\n\r\n  IMPORTS OF BRAZILIAN SARSAPARILLA.\r\n                   lbs.\r\n  1827            28,155\r\n  1828            49,280\r\n  1829            52,772\r\n  1830            19,842\r\n  1831            31,972\r\n  1832            91,238\r\n  1833            13,077\r\n  1834            28,803\r\n  1835            22,387\r\n  1836             1,718\r\n  1837            12,842\r\n  1838              --\r\n  1839             9,484\r\n  1840             4,141\r\n  1841             1,399\r\n  1842             5,572\r\n\r\nThe total imports in 1849 were 118,934 lbs.\r\n\r\nSarsaparilla has been found growing in the Port Phillip district of\r\nAustralia, and has been shipped thence in small quantities. It seems\r\nto be indigenous to the Bahamas, and is to be found on many of the out\r\nislands. Mr. Wm. Dalzell, of Abaco, collected some considerable\r\nquantity at a place called Marsh Harbor, which was found to be of a\r\nsuperior quality.\r\n\r\nSome thousands of pounds of sarsaparilla were brought to Falmouth,\r\nJamaica, last year, and bought by merchants for export. It came from\r\nthe parish of St. Elizabeth, and there are whole forests covered with\r\nthis weed, for such in reality it is. It is too the real black Jamaica\r\nsarsaparilla, that is so much valued in the European and American\r\nmarkets. It is also found in other parts of the island.\r\n\r\nIn 1798 3,674 lbs. of sarsaparilla were shipped from La Guayra; 2,394\r\nlbs. in 1801 from Puerto Cabella, and 400 quintals from Costa Rica, in\r\n1845, valued at eight dollars a quintal.\r\n\r\nSENNA.--Several varieties of Cassia, natives of the East, are grown\r\nfor the production of this drug. The dried leaves of C. _lanceolata_\r\nor _orientalis_, grown in Egypt, Syria, and Arabia, the true Mecca\r\nsenna, are considered the best. In Egypt the leaves of _Cynanchum\r\nArghel_ are used for adulterating senna, _Cassia obovata_ or _C.\r\nsenna_, also a native of Egypt, cultivated in the East Indies, as well\r\nas in Spain, Italy, and Jamaica. It is a perennial herb, one or two\r\nfeet high. In the East Indies there is a variety (_C. elongata_)\r\ncommon about Tinnivelly, Coimbatore, Bombay, and Agra, &c. Several of\r\nthis species are common in the West India islands. The plants, which\r\nare for the most part evergreens, grow from two to fifteen feet high;\r\nthey delight in a loamy soil, or mixture of loam or peat.\r\n\r\nThe seed is drilled in the ground, and the only attention required by\r\nthe plant is loosening the ground and weeding two or three times when\r\nit is young.\r\n\r\nThe senna leaves imported from India are not generally so clean and\r\nfree from rubbish as those from Alexandria. They are worth from 20s.\r\nto 27s. per cwt. in the Bombay market.\r\n\r\nThe prices are--Alexandria, l½d. to 6d. per lb.; East Indian, 2d. to\r\n3d. per lb.; Tinnevelly, 7d. to 9½d. per lb.\r\n\r\nSenna is collected in various parts of Africa by the Arabs, who make\r\ntwo crops annually; one, the most productive, after the rains in\r\nAugust and September, the other about the middle of March. It is\r\nbrought to Boulack, the port of Cairo, by the caravans, &c., from\r\nAbyssinia, Nubia, and Sennaar, also by the way of Cossier, the Red\r\nSea, and Suez. The different leaves are mixed, and adulterated with\r\narghel leaves. The whole shipments from Boulack to Alexandria, whence\r\nit finds it way to Europe, is 14,000 to 15,500 quintals.\r\n\r\nThe quantities imported for home consumption were--\r\n\r\n          From the East Indies.     Other places.

The imports into the United Kingdom were, in\r\n1847, 246 tons; 1848, 402 tons; 1849, 240 tons.\r\n\r\nAlexandrian senna (_Cassia acutifolia_). This species is said by some\r\nto constitute the bulk of the senna consumed for medical purposes in\r\nEurope. It is much adulterated with the leaves of _Cynanchum Arghel,\r\nTiphrosia apollinea_, and _Coriaria myrtifolia_.\r\n\r\n_C. lanceolata_ and _C. ethiopica_ furnish other species of the same\r\narticle, the greater part of the produce of which find its way to\r\nIndia, through the Red Sea, Surat, Bombay and Calcutta, the imports\r\ninto Calcutta, in 1849, having been 79,212 lbs. _C. obovata_ furnishes\r\nthe Aleppo and Italian drug.\r\n\r\nAt least eight varieties of senna leaf are known in commerce in\r\nEurope--1. the Senna palthe; 2. Senna of Sennaar or Alexandria; 3. of\r\nTripoli; 4. of Aleppo; 5. of Moka; 6. of Senegambia; 7. the false or\r\nArghel; 8. the Tinnevelly.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt the senna harvest takes place twice annually, in April and\r\nSeptember; the stalks are cut off with the leaves, dried before the\r\nsun, and then packed with date leaves. At Boulka, the drug is sorted,\r\nmixed, and adulterated, and passed into commerce through Alexandria.\r\n\r\nAlexandrian senna, according to Mr. Jacob Bell (\"Pharmaceutical\r\nJournal,\" vol. 2, p. 63), contains a mixture of two or more species of\r\ntrue senna. It consists principally of _Cassia obovata_ and _C.\r\nobtusata_, and according to some authorities it occasionally contains\r\n_C. acutifolia_. This mixture is unimportant, but the _Cynanchum\r\nArghel_, which generally constitutes a fifth of the weight on an\r\naverage, possesses properties differing in some respects from true\r\nsenna, and which render it particularly objectionable. The Tinnevelly\r\nsenna, that most esteemed by the profession, is known by the size of\r\nthe leaflets, which are much larger than those of any other variety;\r\nthey are also less brittle, thinner and larger, and are generally\r\nfound in a very perfect state, while the other varieties, especially\r\nthe Alexandrian, are more or less broken. The leaves of the Cynanchum\r\nare similar in form to those of the lanceolate senna, but they are\r\nthicker and stiffer, the veins are scarcely visible, they are not\r\noblique at the base, their surface is rugose, and the color grey or\r\ngreenish drab; their taste is bitter and disagreeable, and they are\r\noften spotted with a yellow, intensely bitter gummo-resinous\r\nincrustation. Being less fragile than the leaflets of the true senna,\r\nthey are more often found entire, and are very easily distinguishable\r\nfrom the varieties which constitute true Alexandrian senna.\r\n\r\nIn their botanical character they are essentially different, being\r\ndistinct leaves, not leaflets, which is the case with true senna.\r\n\r\nThe SUMBUL root, which has recently been introduced into the French\r\nmarket, is the root of an umbelliferous plant, which is characterised\r\nby a strong odor of musk. The pilgrims, on their return from Mecca,\r\ngenerally import to Salonika, Constantinople, &c., among other\r\narticles of trade, various plants with a musk-like odor. The\r\npreparation of these vegetable substances is said to be effected by\r\nsmearing them over with musk-balsam.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Ure's Dictionary of Arts and Manufactures.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Fractional parts are not necessary to include.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Dr. Lindley is in error as to the discriminating\r\nduties--British cacao pays 9s., and foreign 18s.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: According to Breen's History of St. Lucia up to 1844.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Caffeine (the principle of coffee) and theobromine (the\r\nprinciple of cacao) are the most highly nitrogenised products in\r\nnature, as the following analysis will show:--\r\n\r\n_Caffeine_, according to Pfaff and Liebig, contains--\r\n\r\n  Carbon               49.77\r\n  Hydrogen              5.33\r\n  _Nitrogen_           28.78\r\n  Oxygen               16.12\r\n\r\n_Theobromine_, according to Woskreseusky, contains--\r\n\r\n  Carbon               47.21\r\n  Hydrogen              4.53\r\n  _Nitrogen_           35.38\r\n  Oxygen               12.80\r\n\r\nOf the two, cacao contains the larger quantity of nitrogen; and this\r\nchemical fact explains why cacao should be so much more nutritive than\r\ntea, though the principle of tea (theine) is nearly identical with the\r\nprinciple of cacoa--tea containing in 100 parts 29.009 of nitrogen. On\r\nthis subject Liebig has made an observation which I cannot avoid\r\nnoticing. He says, \"We shall never certainly be able to discover how\r\nmen were led to the use of the hot infusion of the leaves of a certain\r\nshrub (tea), or of a decoction of certain roasted seeds (coffee). Some\r\ncause there must be, which would explain how the practice has become a\r\nnecessary of life to whole nations. But it is surely still more\r\nremarkable that the beneficial effects of both plants on the health\r\nmust be ascribed to one and the same substance, the presence of which\r\nin two vegetables, belonging to different natural families, and the\r\nproduce of different quarters of the globe, could hardly have\r\npresented itself to the boldest imagination. Yet recent researches\r\nhave shown, in such a manner as to exclude all doubt, that caffeine,\r\nthe peculiar principle of coffee, and theine, that of tea, are in all\r\nrespects identical.\"--_(Anim. Chem.,_ pp. 178-9.) We really can see\r\nnothing in all this but the manifestation of that instinct which,\r\nimplanted in us by the Almighty, led the untutored Indian (as we are\r\npleased to call him) to breathe into the nostril of the buffalo or the\r\nwild horse, and by that single act to subdue his angry rage, or that\r\nimpelled the first discoverer of combustion to extract fire from the\r\nattrition of two pieces of wood. The American Indian, living entirely\r\non flesh, \"discovered for himself in tobacco smoke a means of\r\nretarding the change of matter in the tissues of the body, and thereby\r\nof making hunger more endurable.\"--(P. 179.) But the wonder ceases,\r\nwhen we reflect that man was endued with certain properties by his\r\nMaker which must have been at some remote period, of which we can form\r\nno idea, active and manifest the moment he breathed the breath of\r\nlife. To inquire how he lost this property is not our business at\r\npresent, but it is only by supposing the _quondam_ existence of such a\r\nproperty, active and manifest, that can in any way explain a first\r\nknowledge of the therapeutic, or threptic, qualities of plants and\r\nshrubs. With regard to the identity of theine, caffeine, theobromine,\r\n&c., it would be as well that the reader should keep in mind that it\r\nis so chemically _only_, for in appearance, taste, weight, odor, &c.,\r\nno substances can differ more. Does the palate exert some peculiar\r\naction on the ingesta, so as to give to each a distinct sapor? Or\r\n_vice versa_?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: In the West Indies, from my own experience, I have found\r\nthis to be one of the worst descriptions of soil. _P.L.S._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Correspondent of the Singapore _Free Press_, December,\r\n1852.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: It is important, in considering what tea may be had from\r\nChina, to consider the manner of its production. It is grown over an\r\nimmense district, in small farms, or rather gardens, no farm producing\r\nmore that 600 chests. \"The tea merchant goes himself, or sends his\r\nagents to all the small towns, villages, and temples in the district,\r\nto purchase tea from the priests and small farmers; the large\r\nmerchant, into whose hands the tea thus comes, _has to refire it and\r\npack it for the foreign market.\"--(Fortune's Tea Districts.)_ This\r\nrefiring is the only additional process of manufacture for our market.\r\nMr. Fortune elsewhere, in his valuable work, giving an account of the\r\ncost of tea from the farmers, the conveyance to market, and the\r\nmerchant's profit, states that \" the small farmer and manipulator is\r\nnot overpaid, but that the great profits are received by the\r\nmiddlemen.\" No doubt these men do their utmost to keep the farmers in\r\ncomplete ignorance of the state of the tea-market, that they may\r\nmonopolise the advantages, but it is pretty certain that the news of a\r\nbold reduction of duty, and the promise of an immensely increased\r\nconsumption, would reach even the Chinese farmers, and make them pick\r\ntheir trees more closely--a little of which amongst so many would make\r\na vast difference in the total supply.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: See article Thea, by Dr. Royle, in \"Penny Cyclopædia,\"\r\nvol xxiv., p. 286.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Hooker's \"Bot.
