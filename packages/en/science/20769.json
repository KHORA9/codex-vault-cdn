Aside from a\r\nknowledge of \"the Dipper\" and \"the Pleiades,\" the constellations to\r\nthe vast majority, are utterly unknown.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate and popularize if possible this fascinating recreation\r\nof star-gazing the author has designed this field-book. It is limited\r\nin scope solely to that purpose, and all matter of a technical or\r\ntheoretical nature has been omitted.\r\n\r\nThe endeavor has been to include in these pages only such matter as\r\nthe reader can observe with the naked eye, or an opera-glass.\r\nSimplicity and brevity have been aimed at, the main idea being that\r\nwhatever is bulky or verbose is a hindrance rather than a help when\r\nactually engaged in the observation of the heavens.\r\n\r\nThe constellations embraced in this manual are only those visible from\r\nthe average latitude of the New England and Middle States, and owe\r\ntheir place in the particular season in which they are found to the\r\nfact that in that season they are favorably situated for observation.\r\n\r\nWith this brief explanatory note of the purpose and design of the\r\nbook, the author proceeds to outline the scheme of study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHEME OF STUDY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe table of contents shows the scheme of study to be pursued, and to\r\nfacilitate the work it is desirable that the student follow the\r\ntherein circumscribed order.\r\n\r\nA knowledge on the part of the reader of Ursa Major, or \"the Dipper\"\r\nas it is commonly called, and \"the Pleiades,\" the well-known group in\r\nTaurus, is presupposed by the author.\r\n\r\nWith this knowledge as a basis, the student is enabled in any season\r\nto take up the study of the constellations. By following out the order\r\ndictated, he will in a few nights of observation be enabled to\r\nidentify the various configurations making up the several\r\nconstellations that are set apart for study in that particular season.\r\n\r\nA large plate, showing the appearance of the heavens at a designated\r\ntime on the first night of the quarter, is inserted before each\r\nseason's work. This should be consulted by the student before he makes\r\nan observation, in order that he may obtain a comprehensive idea of\r\nthe relative position of the constellations, and also know in what\r\npart of the heavens to locate the constellation which he wishes to\r\nidentify.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of one constellation enables the student to determine the\r\nposition of the next in order. In this work, the identification of\r\neach constellation depends on a knowledge of what precedes, always\r\nbearing in mind the fact that each season starts as a new and distinct\r\npart to be taken by itself, and has no bearing on that which comes\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n                                                                PAGE\r\n\r\n  INTRODUCTION                                                   iii\r\n\r\n  SCHEME OF STUDY                                                  v\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Constellations of Spring.\r\n\r\n  MAP OF THE HEAVENS 9 P.M., APRIL FIRST                           3\r\n\r\n  1.

This applies to\r\nall constellations excepting those near the zenith.\r\n\r\nThe four large plates are so arranged that the observer is supposed to\r\nbe looking at the southern skies. By turning the plate about from left\r\nto right, the eastern, northern, and western skies are shown\r\nsuccessively.\r\n\r\nOn many of the diagrams the position of nebulae is indicated. These are\r\ndesignated by the initial letter of the astronomer who catalogued\r\nthem, preceded by his catalogue number, as for instance 8 M. signifies\r\nnebula number 8 in Messier's catalogue.\r\n\r\nThe magnitudes assigned to the stars in the diagrams are derived from\r\nthe Harvard Photometry. When a star is midway between two magnitudes\r\nthe numeral is underlined, thus _2_, indicates a star of magnitude\r\n2.5.\r\n\r\nIf a star's magnitude is between 1 and 1.5 it is regarded as a\r\nfirst-magnitude star. If it lies between 1.5 and 2 it is designated\r\nsecond magnitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTELLATIONS OF SPRING.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map showing the principal stars visible from Lat. 40[deg]\r\nN. at 9 o'clock April 1st.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nURSA MAJOR (er'sa m[=a]'-jor)--THE GREAT BEAR. (Face North.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--Ursa Major is probably the best known of the constellations,\r\nand in this work I presuppose that the reader is familiar with its\r\nposition in the heavens. It is one of the most noted and conspicuous\r\nconstellations in the northern hemisphere, and is readily and\r\nunmistakably distinguished from all others by means of a remarkable\r\ncluster of seven bright stars in the northern heavens, forming what is\r\nfamiliarly termed \"The Dipper.\"\r\n\r\nThe stars [a] and [b] are called the pointers, because they always\r\npoint toward the Pole Star, 28-3/4[deg] distant from [a].\r\n\r\nAlioth is very nearly opposite Shedir in Cassiopeia, and at an equal\r\ndistance from the Pole. The same can be said of Megres, in Ursa Major,\r\nand Caph, in Cassiopeia.\r\n\r\nThe star [o] is at the tip of the Bear's nose. A clearly defined\r\nsemicircle begins at [o] and ends in the pair [i] and [k] at the\r\nextremity of the Bear's right fore paw. This group of stars resembles\r\na sickle. Note little Alcor close to Mizar. This star was used by the\r\nArabs as a test of good eyesight.\r\n\r\nMizar and Alcor are known as the horse and his rider.\r\n\r\nThis plate shows the Bear lying on his back, his feet projected up the\r\nsky; three conspicuous pairs of stars represent three of his four\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe Chaldean shepherds and the Iroquois Indians gave to this\r\nconstellation the same name. The Egyptians called it \"The Thigh.\"\r\n\r\n[a] and [[^e]] are moving through space in a contrary direction to the\r\nremaining five stars in \"The Dipper.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: URSA MAJOR]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nURSA MINOR (er'-sa mi'-nor)--THE LITTLE BEAR. (Face North.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--The two pointer stars in Ursa Major indicate the position\r\nof Polaris, the North Star, which represents the tip of the tail of\r\nthe Little Bear, and the end of the handle of the \"Little Dipper.\" In\r\nall ages of the world, Ursa Minor has been more universally observed\r\nand more carefully noticed than any other constellation, on account of\r\nthe importance of the North Star.\r\n\r\nPolaris is a little more than 1-1/4[deg] from the true pole. Its light\r\ntakes fifty years to reach us.\r\n\r\nA line joining [b] Cassiopeiae, and Megres, in Ursa Major, will pass\r\nthrough Polaris.\r\n\r\nAt the distance of the nearest fixed star our sun would shine as a\r\nstar no brighter than Polaris which is presumably about the sun's\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nPolaris revolves around the true pole once in twenty-four hours in a\r\nlittle circle 2-1/2[deg] in diameter. Within this circle two hundred stars\r\nhave been photographed.\r\n\r\nThe North Star is always elevated as many degrees above the horizon as\r\nthe observer is north of the equator.\r\n\r\nCompare the light of the four stars forming the bowl of the \"Little\r\nDipper,\" as they are each of a different magnitude. A standard\r\nfirst-magnitude star is 2-1/2 times brighter than a standard second\r\nmagnitude star, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: URSA MINOR]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEMINI (jem'-i-ni)--THE TWINS. (Face West.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--A line drawn from [b] to [k] Ursae Majoris and prolonged an\r\nequal distance ends near Castor, in Gemini. Gemini is characterized by\r\ntwo nearly parallel rows of stars. The northern row if extended would\r\nreach Taurus, the southern one Orion. Note the fine cluster 35 M.\r\nHerschel discovered Uranus in 1781 a short distance southwest of it.\r\nTwo wonderful streams of little stars run parallel northwest on each\r\nside of the cluster. Where the ecliptic crosses the solstitial colure\r\nis the spot where the sun appears to be when it is farthest north of\r\nthe equator, June 21st. Castor is a fine double for a telescope, and\r\nPollux has three little attendant stars. An isoceles triangle is\r\nformed by Castor, Aldebaran in Taurus, and Capella in Auriga. There is\r\na record of an occultation in Gemini noted about the middle of the\r\nfourth century B.C.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs saw in this group of stars two peacocks, the Egyptians two\r\nsprouting plants, and the Hindus twin deities, while in the Buddhist\r\nzodiac they represented a woman holding a golden cord. Since classic\r\ntimes, however, the figure has always been that of human twins.\r\n\r\nAt the point indicated near [th] a new star was discovered by Enebo in\r\nMarch, 1912. It attained a maximum of about magnitude 3.5 and has at\r\nthis writing waned to the eleventh magnitude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEMINI]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAURIGA ([^a]-ri'-ga)--THE CHARIOTEER. (Face Northwest.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--A line drawn from [d] to [a] Ursae Majoris, and prolonged\r\nabout 45[deg], ends near the bright Capella, in Auriga, a star of the\r\nfirst magnitude, and one of the most brilliant in the heavens. It is\r\nunmistakable, having no rival in brightness near it. Auriga is a\r\nbeautiful and conspicuous constellation. It is characterized by a\r\nclearly defined pentagon. Note the three fourth-magnitude stars near\r\nCapella known as \"The Kids.\" The star [b] is common to Auriga and\r\nTaurus, being the former's right foot and the latter's northern horn.\r\nThe field within the pentagon is particularly rich in clusters.\r\nCapella forms a rude square with Polaris, [e] Cassiopeiae, and [o] Ursae\r\nMajoris, and forms an equilateral triangle with Betelgeuze in Orion,\r\nand the Pleiades in Taurus.\r\n\r\nA line from [th] to [a] Aurigae prolonged about 20[deg] ends near [a]\r\nPersei.\r\n\r\nCapella is visible at some hour of every clear night throughout the\r\nyear. Of the first-magnitude stars it is nearest to the Pole, and it\r\nrises almost exactly in the northeast.\r\n\r\nTo the Arabs Capella was \"The Driver,\" because it seemed to rise\r\nearlier than the other stars and so apparently watched over them, or\r\nstill more practically as \"The Singer\" who rode before the procession\r\ncheering on the camels, which last were represented by the Pleiades.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AURIGA]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANCER (kan'-ser)--THE CRAB. (Face West.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--Cancer lies between Gemini and Leo. A line drawn from Nath\r\nin Auriga to Pollux in Gemini, and prolonged about 15[deg], ends in\r\nPraesepe, the Manger, the great star cluster in Cancer, which is also\r\ncalled \"The Bee Hive.\" It contains 300 stars. The stars [g] and [d]\r\nare called the Aselli--the ass's colts feeding from the silver manger.\r\n\r\nThe star [b] lies about 10[deg] northeast of Procyon. Acubens, [a] lies on\r\nthe same line the same distance beyond [b]. These two stars form the\r\ntips of the inverted \"Y\" which distinguishes Cancer.\r\n\r\nAn imaginary line from Capella through Pollux will point out Acubens.\r\nClose to it are two faint stars. The Bee Hive lies within an irregular\r\nsquare formed by [g], [d], [[^e]], and [th], and looks like a nebula to\r\nthe naked eye.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1895, all the planets except Neptune were in this quarter of\r\nthe heavens, and Halley's comet was in this constellation on its first\r\nappearance in 1531.\r\n\r\nThe dimness of [g] and [d] is an infallible precursor of rain, and if\r\nthe Bee Hive is not visible in a clear sky, it is a presage of a\r\nviolent storm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CANCER]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDRA (hi'-dra)--THE SEA-SERPENT. (Face South and Southwest.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--The head of Hydra, a striking and beautiful arrangement of\r\nstars, lies just below the Bee Hive, in Cancer, 6[deg] south of Acubens in\r\nthat constellation, and forms a rhomboidal figure of five stars.\r\n\r\nHydra is about 100[deg] in length and reaches almost from Canis Minor to\r\nLibra. Its stars are all faint except Alphard, or the Hydra's heart, a\r\nsecond-magnitude star remarkable for its lonely situation, southwest\r\nof Regulus, in Leo. A line drawn from [g] Leonis through Regulus\r\npoints it out. It is of a rich orange tint. Castor and Pollux, in\r\nGemini, point southeast to it.\r\n\r\nThe constellations Crater, the Cup, and Corvus, the Crow, both stand\r\non the coils of Hydra, south of Denebola, the bright star in the tail\r\nof the Lion.\r\n\r\nHydra is supposed to be the snake shown on a uranographic stone from\r\nthe Euphrates, 1200 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe little asterism Sextans, the Sextant, lies in the region between\r\nRegulus and Alphard. It contains no stars brighter than the fourth\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HYDRA]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEO (le'o)--THE LION. (Face South.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--A line drawn from Pollux, in Gemini, to [g] in Cancer, and\r\nprolonged about 12[deg], strikes Regulus, the brilliant star in the heart\r\nof the Lion. Regulus lies about 9[deg] east of Acubens, in Cancer, and\r\nabout 12[deg] northeast of Alphard, in the heart of Hydra.\r\n\r\nLeo is one of the most beautiful constellations in the zodiac. It lies\r\nsouth of the Great Bear, and its principal stars are arranged in the\r\nform of a sickle which nearly outlines the Lion's head. This group is\r\nso striking as to be unmistakable. Regulus is in the handle of the\r\nsickle. It is one of the stars from which longitude is reckoned, lies\r\nalmost exactly on the ecliptic, and is visible for eight months in the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nDenebola, the bright star in the Lion's tail, lies 25[deg] east of\r\nRegulus, and about 35[deg] west of Arcturus, in Bo[:o]tes. It is the same\r\ndistance northwest of Spica, in Virgo, and forms with Spica and\r\nArcturus a large equilateral triangle.\r\n\r\n[z] is double, and has three faint companion stars.\r\n\r\n[e] has two seventh-magnitude companion stars, forming a beautiful\r\nlittle triangle.\r\n\r\nRegulus is white in color, [g] yellow, [p] red.\r\n\r\n[g] is a beautiful colored telescopic double star and has a companion\r\nvisible in an opera-glass.\r\n\r\nThe figure of Leo very much as we now have it appears in all the\r\nIndian and Egyptian zodiacs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEO\r\n\r\nTHE SICKLE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMA BERENICES (k[=o]'-ma ber-e-ni'-sez)--BERENICE'S HAIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--A line drawn from Regulus to Zosma, in Leo, and prolonged\r\nan equal distance, strikes this fine cluster, which is 18[deg] northeast\r\nof Zosma, [d] Leonis.\r\n\r\nThe group lies well within a triangle formed by Denebola, Arcturus, in\r\nBo[:o]tes, and Cor Caroli, in Canes Venatici, which triangle is the upper\r\nhalf of the Diamond of Virgo.\r\n\r\nTwenty or thirty stars in this group can be counted with an\r\nopera-glass, and the group can be easily distinguished with the naked\r\neye, when the moon is not visible.\r\n\r\nThe first half of the month of April can be called the most brilliant\r\nsidereal period of the year. At this time eleven first-magnitude stars\r\nare visible in this latitude at 9 P.M. From east to west they are:\r\nVega, Arcturus, Spica, Regulus, Pollux, Procyon, Sirius, Capella,\r\nAldebaran, Betelgeuze, and Rigel, truly a glorious company, an\r\nincomparable sight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMA BERENICES]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANIS MINOR (k[=a]'-nis mi'-nor)--THE LESSER DOG. (Face West.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--Procyon, the Little Dog Star, lies about 23[deg] south of\r\nPollux, in Gemini. A line drawn from Nath, in Auriga, to Alhena, in\r\nGemini, and prolonged about 18[deg], reaches Procyon.\r\n\r\nProcyon is equidistant from Betelgeuze in Orion, and Sirius in Canis\r\nMajor, and forms with them an equilateral triangle. It forms a large\r\nright-angled triangle with Pollux and Betelgeuze.\r\n\r\nThe light from Procyon is golden yellow. Four degrees northwest of it\r\nis the third-magnitude star Gomeisa. The glass shows two small stars\r\nforming a right-angled triangle with it.\r\n\r\nProcyon was distinctly mentioned by Ptolemy. It rises in this latitude\r\na little north of east about half an hour before Sirius, the Dog Star,\r\nhence it was called Procyon from two Greek words which signify \"before\r\nthe dog.\"\r\n\r\nProcyon is one of our nearest neighbors in space, at a distance of ten\r\nlight years, and is attended by a very faint companion which is only\r\nvisible in the largest telescopes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CANIS MINOR]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORVUS (k[^o]r'-vus)--THE CROW. (Face South.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--A line drawn from the Bee Hive, in Cancer, through Regulus,\r\nin Leo, and prolonged about 40[deg], ends near the conspicuous\r\nquadrilateral which distinguishes Corvus. The brightest star in this\r\nregion of the sky is Spica, in Virgo. It lies about 10[deg] northeast of\r\nAlgorab.\r\n\r\n[z] is a double star for an opera-glass. A faint pair of stars lie\r\nclose below and to the west of [b]. The Crow is represented as\r\nstanding on, and pecking at, the coils of Hydra. The star Al Chiba is\r\nin the Crow's bill.\r\n\r\nCorvus was known as the Raven in Chaucer's time.\r\n\r\n[d] is an interesting telescopic double.\r\n\r\nA line drawn from [g] to [b] Corvi and prolonged twice its length\r\nlocates the third-magnitude star [i] Centauri in the right shoulder of\r\nthe Centaur. The brightest stars in this constellation are not visible\r\nin this latitude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORVUS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCRATER (kr[=a]'-ter)--THE CUP. (Face South.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--Crater is situated 15[deg] west of Corvus, and due south of\r\n[th] Leonis. It is easily distinguished by reason of a beautiful and\r\nvery striking semicircle of six stars of the fourth magnitude, forming\r\nthe bowl of the cup.\r\n\r\nThe constellation resembles a goblet with its base resting on the\r\ncoils of Hydra.\r\n\r\nThe star Alkes is common to Hydra and Crater, and may be seen 24[deg]\r\nsoutheast of Alphard in the heart of Hydra. It is distinguished by its\r\nforming an equilateral triangle with [a] and [g], stars of the same\r\nmagnitude 6[deg] south and east of it.\r\n\r\nCorvus and Crater are to be seen half-way up the southern sky during\r\nthe early evenings in spring.\r\n\r\n[d] is now the lucida.\r\n\r\nCrater is situated at about the centre of Hydra and is on the\r\nmeridian, April 26th. Owing to its many faint stars it is best seen on\r\na clear moonless night.\r\n\r\nThe zodiacal light is well worth observing at this season of the year.\r\nIt is to be seen in the western sky shortly after sundown, and is most\r\nintense during the evenings of March.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CRATER]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETEORIC SHOWERS.\r\n\r\nAPRIL TO JULY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +--------------------+---------+--------------------+---------------+-------------+--------+\r\n  |                    |         |                    |               | Other Dates |        |\r\n  | Name of Shower     | Date    |   Radiant Point    |Characteristics|      of     |Location|\r\n  |                    |         |                    |               | Observation |        |\r\n  +--------------------+---------+--------------------+---------------+-------------+--------+\r\n  |     Beta or Mu     |Apr. 9-16| The Dragon's head  |               |             |  N.E.  |\r\n  |     Draconids      | Apr. 18 |                    |     Sw.

(Face North.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--About 10[deg] from [a] Ursae Majoris--from [a] to [d] is\r\n10[deg]--slightly south of, that is above, the line from [a] to Polaris,\r\nis Giansar, [l] in the tip of the Dragon's tail. Above [l], and almost\r\nin line with it, are two more stars in Draco, which form with two\r\nstars in Ursa Major a quadrilateral. (See diagram.) Draco now curves\r\nsharply eastward, coiling about the Little Bear as shown, then turns\r\nabruptly southerly, ending in a characteristic and clearly defined\r\ngroup of four stars, forming an irregular square, representing the\r\nDragon's head. This group is almost overhead in the early evening in\r\nsummer. The star in the heel of Hercules lies just south of the\r\nDragon's head. The brilliant Vega will be seen about overhead, 12[deg]\r\nsouthwest of the Dragon's head. Eltanin, one of the Dragon's eyes, is\r\nnoted for its connection with the discovery of the law of aberration\r\nof light. It is of an orange hue, while the star [b], near it, is\r\nwhite. Note Thuban, once the Pole Star, at one corner of a\r\nquadrilateral that Draco forms with Ursa Major.\r\n\r\nThuban could be seen by day or night from the bottom of the central\r\npassage of several of the Pyramids in Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe rising of Eltanin was visible about thirty-five hundred years B.C.\r\nthrough the central passages of the temples of Hathor at Denderah. The\r\nEgyptians called Draco \"The Hippopotamus.\"\r\n\r\nVega and the four stars in the Dragon's head offer an opportunity to\r\ncompare the first five stellar magnitudes with which all should be\r\nfamiliar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRACO]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLYRA (l[=i]'-ra)--THE LYRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--Lyra may be easily distinguished because of the brilliant\r\nVega, its brightest star, which is situated about 12[deg] southwest of the\r\nDragon's head. It is unmistakable, as it is the brightest star in this\r\nregion of the heavens, and the third brightest in this latitude. In\r\nJuly and August Vega is close to the zenith in the early evening.\r\n\r\nThe six bright stars in Lyra form an equilateral triangle on one\r\ncorner of a rhomboid. A very characteristic figure.\r\n\r\n[e] is a pretty double for an opera-glass, and a 3\" glass reveals the\r\nduplicity of each star of this pair. [e] is therefore a double double.\r\n\r\n[z] is a double for a good glass.\r\n\r\n[b] is a variable, changing from magnitude 3.4 to 4.4 in twelve days.\r\nAt its brightest it is about equal to its near neighbor [g] Lyrae.\r\n\r\nThe noted ring nebula lies between [b] and [g]. A 3\" glass reveals it\r\nbut a powerful telescope is required to render its details visible.\r\n\r\nIf the distance from the earth to the sun equalled one inch, the\r\ndistance from the earth to Vega would be 158 miles.\r\n\r\nVega was the first star to be photographed, in 1850. It is visible at\r\nsome hour every clear night, and has been called the arc-light of the\r\nsky. Its light has the bluish-white hue that suggests \"a diamond in\r\nthe sky.\"\r\n\r\nThe spectroscope reveals that Vega is a star probably only in its\r\ninfancy, as hydrogen is its predominating element.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LYRA]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCYGNUS (sig'-nus)--THE SWAN, OR THE NORTHERN CROSS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--Deneb, the brightest star in Cygnus, is at the top of the\r\ncross, and a little over 20[deg] east of Vega. It forms a triangle with\r\nVega and Altair in Aquila--Altair being at the apex, about 35[deg] from\r\nDeneb and Vega.\r\n\r\n[b] Cygni is at the base of the cross, and a line drawn from Vega to\r\nAltair nearly touches it. It is a beautiful colored double for a small\r\ntelescope.\r\n\r\nNote \"61,\" one of the nearest stars to us. It was the first star whose\r\ndistance was measured (by Bessel in 1838). It is a double star and\r\n10.4 light years distant.\r\n\r\nThe cross is nearly perfect and easily traced out. It lies almost\r\nwholly in the Milky Way.\r\n\r\nNote \"The Coal Sack,\" one of the dark gap in the Milky Way.\r\n\r\nCygnus contains an unusual number of deeply colored stars and variable\r\nstars.\r\n\r\n[o] Cygni has a sixth-magnitude companion, and [g] is in the midst of\r\na beautiful stream of faint stars.\r\n\r\nThis region is perhaps richer than any similar extent in the heavens.\r\nAn opera-glass will reveal many of its beauties.\r\n\r\nHerschel counted 331,000 stars in an area of only 5[deg] in Cygnus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CYGNUS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAQUILA (ak'-wi-l[:a])--THE EAGLE, AND ANTINO[:U]S. (Face Southeast.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--Half-way up the sky in the Milky Way, you will see three\r\nstars in a line, the middle one much brighter than the other two. This\r\nbright star is Altair, in Aquila. It forms with Vega and Deneb an\r\nisosceles triangle. Altair is at the apex, about 35[deg] from the other\r\ntwo. A triangle is formed by Vega, Altair, and Ras Alhague, in the\r\nSerpent Bearer, which is about 30[deg] west of Altair.\r\n\r\nThis is a double constellation composed of Aquila and Antino[:u]s. Altair\r\nis in the neck of the Eagle, Alschain in the head of Antino[:u]s.\r\n\r\nWhen the moon is absent, a rude arrowhead can be traced out, embracing\r\nalmost all the stars in Aquila.\r\n\r\n[[^e]] is an interesting variable star, changing from magnitude 3.5 to\r\n4.7 and back again within a period of 7 days 4 hours 12 minutes.\r\n\r\nAltair rises about 8[deg] north of the exact eastern point on the horizon.\r\n\r\nIn A.D. 389 a wonderful temporary star flashed out near Altair that\r\nequalled Venus in brightness and vanished within three weeks' time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AQUILA\r\n\r\nANTINO[:U]S]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDELPHINUS (del-fi'-nus)--THE DOLPHIN, OR JOB'S COFFIN. (Face\r\nSoutheast.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--The little cluster of five stars forming Delphinus is to be\r\nseen about 10[deg] northeast of Altair, and, though there are no bright\r\nstars in the group, it can hardly escape notice. A line drawn from\r\nVega to Albireo, and prolonged about 20[deg], strikes the star [e] in the\r\ntail of the Dolphin. The four other stars of prominence in the\r\nconstellation are a little above [e], and form a diamond-shaped\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\nThe little asterisms Sagitta, the Arrow, and Vulpecula and Anser, the\r\nFox and Goose, are shown just above Delphinus.\r\n\r\nDelphinus is also called Job's Coffin. The origin of this appellation\r\nis unknown.\r\n\r\nIn Greece, Delphinus was the Sacred Fish, the sky emblem of\r\nphilanthropy. The Arabs called it the \"Riding Camel.\"\r\n\r\nThe star [g] Delphini is a fine double for a small telescope with a\r\nmarked and beautiful contrast of colors.\r\n\r\nThe names for [a] and [b] reversed spell \"Nicolaus Venator,\" the\r\nLatinized name of the assistant to the astronomer Piazzi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DELPHINUS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAGITTARIUS (saj-i-t[=a]-ri-us)--THE ARCHER. (Face South.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--A line drawn from Deneb, in Cygnus, to Altair, in Aquila,\r\nand prolonged an equal distance, terminates in Sagittarius about 10[deg]\r\neast of its distinguishing characteristic, the Milk Dipper.\r\nSagittarius is one of the signs of the zodiac, and lies between\r\nCapricornus, on the east, and Scorpius, on the west.\r\n\r\nThe bow is easily traced out. [g] marks the arrow's tip.\r\n\r\nNote the star [m], which serves to point out the Winter Solstice,\r\nwhere the solstitial colure intersects the ecliptic.\r\n\r\nOn a clear night, the pretty cluster known as Corona Australis, the\r\nSouthern Crown, can be seen about 10[deg] below the bowl of the Milk\r\nDipper. Its lucida, the fourth-magnitude star Alfecca Meridiana\r\nculminates at 9 P.M., August 13th.\r\n\r\nSagittarius is about due south, in a splendid position for\r\nobservation, during the month of July, between the hours of\r\nnine-thirty and eleven o'clock P.M.\r\n\r\nObserve with an opera-glass the fine clusters 20 M. and 8 M., also an\r\nalmost circular black void near the stars [g] and [d], and to the east\r\nof this spot another of narrow crescent form.\r\n\r\nThe stars [ph] and [z] in the Milk Dipper are moving in opposite\r\ndirections. Future generations therefore will not have this\r\ntime-honored figure to guide them in locating the Archer in their\r\nsummer night skies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAGITTARIUS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPHIUCHUS (of-i-[=u]-kus)--THE SERPENT BEARER, AND SERPENS. (Face\r\nSouthwest.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--A line drawn from [e] Delphini to [g] Aquilae, prolonged\r\nabout 30[deg], strikes the star Ras Alhague, the brightest star in the\r\nconstellation and the head of Ophiuchus. It is at one angle of an\r\nisosceles triangle, of which Altair is at the apex, and Vega the third\r\nangle.\r\n\r\nTwo constellations are here combined. Ophiuchus is represented as an\r\nold man, holding in his hands a writhing serpent.\r\n\r\nRas Algethi, marking the head of Hercules, lies just west of Ras\r\nAlhague.\r\n\r\nEqually distant southeast and southwest of Ras Alhague are to be seen\r\ntwo stars close together, representing the shoulders of Ophiuchus. His\r\nfoot rests on the Scorpion just above Antares.\r\n\r\nThe head of Serpens is the star group in the form of an \"X\" just below\r\nthe Crown.\r\n\r\n1604 indicates the spot where in that year a famous temporary star\r\nappeared, called Kepler's star.\r\n\r\nNote the asterism the \"Bull of Poniatowski\" just east of [g]. The star\r\nmarked 70 is one of the most distant stars for which a parallax has\r\nbeen obtained. Its distance from the earth = 1,300,000 radii of the\r\nearth's orbit, or 120 quadrillion miles.\r\n\r\nThere is something remarkable in the central position of this gigantic\r\nfigure. It is situated almost exactly in the mid-heavens, being nearly\r\nequidistant from the poles, and midway between the vernal and autumnal\r\nequinoxes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OPHIUCHUS\r\n\r\nSERPENS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCORPIUS (sk[^o]r'-pi-us)--THE SCORPION. (Face South.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--Scorpius, one of the signs of the zodiac, is a beautiful\r\nstar group, and one that is easily traced out. It lies just under the\r\nSerpent Bearer, between Sagittarius and Libra.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance to a Scorpion is not difficult to see, hence this\r\nconstellation is perhaps the most aptly named of any.\r\n\r\nThe ruddy star Antares, the brightest star in the constellation, is in\r\nthe heart of the Scorpion. It lies about 40[deg] southwest of Ras Alhague,\r\nin Ophiuchus, and a little over 20[deg] west of the bow of Sagittarius.\r\nThe fact that it is the most brilliant star in this region of the sky\r\nrenders its identity unmistakable. It is one of the reddest stars in\r\nthe firmament.\r\n\r\nThere are several star clusters and double stars to be seen in this\r\nconstellation. Their position is indicated in the diagram.\r\n\r\nThe curved tail of the Scorpion is very conspicuous. [l] and [y] are a\r\nstriking pair and the fine clusters above them can be seen with the\r\nnaked eye.\r\n\r\nA record of a lunar occultation of [b] Scorpii in 295 B.C. is extant.\r\n\r\nNote a pair just below [b]. They are known as [[^o]]^1 and [[^o]]^2.\r\n\r\nIn this region of the sky have appeared many of the brilliant\r\ntemporary stars, the first one in astronomical annals being discovered\r\nin 134 B.C.\r\n\r\nScorpius is mentioned by all the early writers on astronomy and is\r\nsupposed to be so named because in Egypt it was a sickly time of the\r\nyear when the sun entered this sign.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCORPIUS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBRA (l[=i]'-bra)--THE SCALES. (Face Southwest.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--Libra is one of the signs of the zodiac, and lies between\r\nVirgo and Scorpius. Its two chief stars, [a] and [b], may be\r\nrecognized west of and above the head of the Scorpion.\r\n\r\nThe star [i] Librae is about 20[deg] northwest of Antares in the Scorpion.\r\nSpica in Virgo, a star of the first magnitude, is a little over 20[deg]\r\nnorthwest of [a] Librae.\r\n\r\nA quadrilateral is formed by the stars [a], [b], [g], [e], which\r\ncharacterizes the constellation.\r\n\r\nThe star [a] Librae looks elongated. An opera-glass shows that it has a\r\nfifth-magnitude companion.\r\n\r\n[b] is a pale green star. Its color is very unusual.\r\n\r\nLyra, Corona, and Hercules are almost directly overhead in the early\r\nevening, during July and August, and can best be observed in a\r\nreclining position. Thus placed, with an opera-glass to assist the\r\nvision, you may study to the best advantage the wonderful sight spread\r\nout before you, and search depths only measured by the power of your\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun enters the sign Libra the days and nights are equal all\r\nover the world and seem to observe a certain equilibrium like a\r\nbalance, hence the name of the constellation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIBRA]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORONA BOREALIS (k[=o]-r[=o]'n[:a] b[=o]-r[=e]-a'-lis)--THE NORTHERN\r\nCROWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--A line drawn from [a] Cygni, to [a] Lyrae, and projected a\r\nlittle over 40[deg], terminates in the Crown, which lies between Hercules\r\nand Bo[:o]tes, and just above the diamond-shaped group of stars in the\r\nhead of the Serpent.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic semicircle resembling a crown is easily traced out.\r\nThe principal stars are of the fourth magnitude excepting Gemma, which\r\nis a second-magnitude star and known as the \"Pearl of the Crown.\"\r\n\r\nGemma, sometimes called Alphacca, forms with the stars Seginus and\r\nArcturus, in Bo[:o]tes, an isosceles triangle, the vertex of which is at\r\nArcturus.\r\n\r\nClose to [e] a famous temporary appeared suddenly May 12, 1866, as a\r\nsecond-magnitude star. It was known as the \"Blaze Star\" and was\r\nvisible to the naked eye only eight days, fading at that time to a\r\ntenth-magnitude star, and then rising to an eighth-magnitude, where it\r\nstill remains.\r\n\r\nThe native Australians called this constellation \"The Boomerang.\" To\r\nthe Hebrews it was \"Ataroth\" and by this name it is known in the East\r\nto-day. No two of the seven stars composing the Crown are moving in\r\nthe same direction or at the same rate.\r\n\r\n[a] Coronae is seventy-eight light years distant and sixty times\r\nbrighter than the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORONA BOREALIS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERCULES (her'-k[=u]-l[=e]z)--THE KNEELER.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--A line drawn from either Vega, in Lyra, or Altair, in\r\nAquila, to Gemma, in Corona Borealis, passes through this\r\nconstellation. The left foot of Hercules rests on the head of Draco,\r\non the north, and his head nearly touches the head of Ophiuchus on the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nThe star in the head of Hercules, Ras Algethi, is about 25[deg] southeast\r\nof Corona Borealis.\r\n\r\n[a] Ophiuchi and [a] Herculis are only about 5[deg] apart.\r\n\r\nThe cluster 13 M., the Halley Nebula, can be easily seen in an\r\nopera-glass. In a recent photograph of this cluster 50,000 stars are\r\nshown in an area of sky which would be entirely covered by the full\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\nHercules occupies the part of the heavens toward which the sun is\r\nbearing the earth and planets at the rate of twelve miles a second or\r\n373 million miles a year.\r\n\r\nOn a clear night the asterism Cerberus, the three-headed dog, which\r\nHercules holds in his hand, can be seen.\r\n\r\nThis constellation is said to have been an object of worship in\r\nPhoenicia. There is a good deal of mystery about its origin. The\r\nancient Greeks called it \"The Phantom\" and \"The Man upon his Knees.\"\r\n\r\nThe stars [e], [z], [[^e]], and [p] form a keystone shaped figure that\r\nserves to identify the constellation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HERCULES]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBO[:O]TES (b[=o]-[=o]'t[=e]z)--THE HERDSMAN, OR BEAR DRIVER. (Face West.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--Bo[:o]tes lies just west of the Crown, and east of Cor Caroli.\r\nIt may be easily distinguished by the position and splendor of its\r\nprincipal star, Arcturus, which shines with a golden yellow lustre. It\r\nis about 35[deg] east of Denebola, in Leo, and nearly as far north of\r\nSpica, in Virgo, and forms with these two a large equilateral\r\ntriangle. A line drawn from [z] to [[^e]] Ursae Majoris and prolonged\r\nabout 30[deg] locates it, as does one from [d] Herculis to [g] Coronae\r\nprolonged its length.\r\n\r\nThe brightest stars in Bo[:o]tes outline a characteristic kite-shaped\r\nfigure. Arcturus is mentioned in the Book of Job and is often referred\r\nto as \"The Star of Job.\"\r\n\r\nThree stars of the fourth magnitude are situated in the right hand.\r\nThey are about 5[deg] north of [[^e]] Ursae Majoris.\r\n\r\nContrast the color of Arcturus with Spica, Antares, and Vega.\r\n\r\nThe trapezium [b], [g], [d], and [m], was called \"The Female Wolves,\"\r\nby the Arabians; [th], [i], [k] and [l], \"The Whelps of the Hyenas.\"\r\nThey knew the constellation as \"The Vociferator.\"\r\n\r\nArcturus is the fourth brightest star in the northern hemisphere. It\r\nis 1000 times the size of our sun and rushes through space toward\r\nVirgo at the astounding rate of ninety miles a second. It is forty\r\nlight years distant.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greeks called this constellation \"Lycaon,\" a name which\r\nsignifies a Wolf. The Hebrew name for it was \"The Barking Dog.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BO[:O]TES]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIRGO (ver'-g[=o])--THE VIRGIN. (Face West.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--An imaginary line drawn from Antares in Scorpius through\r\n[a] Librae and prolonged a little over 20[deg] strikes Spica, the brightest\r\nstar in Virgo, which star is about 30[deg] southwest of Arcturus.\r\n\r\nArcturus, Cor Caroli, Denebola, and Spica form a figure about 50[deg] in\r\nlength, called the Diamond of Virgo.\r\n\r\nThe equator, ecliptic, and equinoctial colure intersect each other at\r\na point close to the star [[^e]]. This is called the autumnal equinox.\r\n\r\nThe star [e] is known as the \"Grape Gatherer.\" It is observed to rise\r\njust before the sun at vintage time.\r\n\r\nWithin the rude square formed by Denebola, and [e], [g], and [b],\r\nVirginis, the telescope reveals many wonderful nebulae; hence this\r\nregion of the sky has been called \"The Field of the Nebula.\"\r\n\r\nSpica is an extremely beautiful pure white star. It rises a very\r\nlittle south of the exact eastern point on the horizon.\r\n\r\n[g] is a fine double star for a small telescope.\r\n\r\nVirgo is mentioned by the astronomers of all ages. By the Egyptians it\r\nwas intended to represent the goddess Isis, and the Greeks knew it as\r\nCeres. Spica represents the ear of corn held in the Virgin's left\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIRGO]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANES VENATICI (k[=a]'-n[=e]z ve-nat'-i-c[=i])--THE HUNTING DOGS.\r\n(Face Northwest.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--Cor Caroli, the bright star in this constellation, when on\r\nthe meridian is about 17[deg] south of [e] Ursae Majoris. A line drawn from\r\n[[^e]] Ursae Majoris, through Berenice's Hair, to Denebola, in Leo, passes\r\nthrough it.\r\n\r\nThe dogs, Asterion and Chara, are represented as being held in leash\r\nby Bo[:o]tes, the herdsman, in his pursuit of the Great Bear.\r\n\r\nCor Caroli is in the southern hound, Chara, and represents the heart\r\nof Charles II of England. It is a beautiful double star in a small\r\ntelescope.\r\n\r\nThe so-called \"Diamond of Virgo,\" is clearly shown on this plate. It\r\nis formed by connecting with lines the stars Cor Caroli, Denebola,\r\nSpica, and Arcturus.\r\n\r\nThe fifth-magnitude star La Superba, about 7[deg] north and 2-1/2[deg]\r\nwest of Cor Caroli, is especially noteworthy because of the flashing\r\nbrilliancy of its prismatic rays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CANES VENATICI]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETEORIC SHOWERS.\r\n\r\nJULY TO OCTOBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +---------------+--------+----------------+---------------+----------------+--------+\r\n  |               |        |                |               |   Other Dates  |        |\r\n  |Name of Shower |  Date  | Radiant Point  |Characteristics|       of       |Location|\r\n  |               |        |                |               | of Observation |        |\r\n  +---------------+--------+----------------+---------------+----------------+--------+\r\n  |               |        |   Between      |               | June 13-July 7 |        |\r\n  |Vulpeculids or | July 4 |  Cygnus and    |     Sw.       |    Apr. 20,    |  E.    |\r\n  | Eta Sagittids |        |   Delphinus    |               |     May 30     |        |\r\n  +---------------+--------+----------------+---------------+----------------+--------+\r\n  |               |        |  Near Deneb    |               |  July 11-19,   |        |\r\n  |   Cygnids     |July 19 |  ([a]) Cygni   |  Sh.

(Face\r\nNorth.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--A line drawn from [d] Ursae Majoris, through Polaris,\r\nstrikes [a] Cassiopeiae. It is situated the same distance from Polaris\r\nas Ursa Major, and about midway between Polaris and the zenith in the\r\nMilky Way. Cassiopeia is characterized by a zigzag row of stars which\r\nform a rude \"W,\" but in mid-autumn, to an observer facing north, the\r\n\"W\" appears more like an \"M,\" and is almost overhead. Note the spot\r\nmarked 1572. This is where a very famous temporary star appeared in\r\nthat year. It was bright enough at one time to be seen in full\r\nsunshine. The star [[^e]] is sixteen light years distant.\r\n\r\nCaph is equidistant from the Pole, and exactly opposite the star\r\nMegres in Ursa Major; with [a] Andromedae and [g] Pegasi it marks the\r\nequinoctial colure. These stars are known as \"The Three Guides.\"\r\n\r\nThe chair can be readily traced out; [b], [a], and [g] mark three of\r\nthe four corners of the back, and [d] and [e], one of the front legs.\r\nThe word \"Bagdei,\" made up of the letters for the principal stars,\r\nassists the memory.\r\n\r\nThe stars [g] and [b] are pointer stars to a fifth-magnitude star the\r\nlucida of the asterism Lacerta, the lizard about 15[deg] from [b].\r\n\r\nCassiopeia makes an excellent illuminated clock. When [b] is above\r\nPolaris it is noon, when it is in the west at right angles to its\r\nfirst position it is 6 P.M. At midnight it is on the northern horizon,\r\nand at 6 P.M. it is due east.\r\n\r\nThis is sidereal time which agrees with mean time on March 22d, and\r\ngains on the latter at the rate of two hours a month.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CASSIOPEIA]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCEPHEUS (s[=e]'-f[=u]s) (Face North.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--A line drawn from [a] to [b] Cassiopeiae and prolonged about\r\n18[deg] strikes [a] Cephei. The nearest bright star west of Polaris is [g]\r\nCephei. Cepheus is an inconspicuous constellation, lying partly in the\r\nMilky Way. A view of this constellation through an opera-glass will\r\nrepay the observer. Cepheus is characterized by a rude square, one\r\nside of which is the base of an isosceles triangle. Look for the\r\nso-called garnet star [m], probably the reddest star visible to the\r\nnaked eye in the United States. The star [z] has a blue companion\r\nstar.\r\n\r\n[a] forms an equilateral triangle with Polaris and [e] Cassiopeiae.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed that Cepheus was known to the Chaldaeans twenty-three\r\ncenturies before our era.\r\n\r\nSurrounding [d], [e], [z], and [l], which mark the king's head, is a\r\nvacant space in the Milky Way, similar to the Coal Sack of Cygnus.\r\n\r\nAbout 4[deg] from [g], in the direction of [k] is a pretty pair of\r\nsixth-magnitude stars.\r\n\r\nOwing to precession, [g], [b], and [a] Cephei will be successively the\r\nPole Star in 4500, 6000, and 7500 A.D. respectively.\r\n\r\n[d] is a double whose components are yellow and blue. It is an\r\ninteresting variable changing from magnitude 3.7 to 4.9 at intervals\r\nof 5 days 8 hours 47 minutes. As it is three times as bright at\r\nmaximum as at minimum and can be observed with the naked eye its\r\nvariations are well worth observing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CEPHEUS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEGASUS (peg'-a-sus)--THE WINGED HORSE. (Face South.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--One corner of the Great Square is found by drawing a line\r\nfrom Polaris to Cassiopeia, and prolonging it an equal distance.\r\n\r\nThe Great Square is a stellar landmark. Three of the corners of the\r\nsquare are marked by stars in Pegasus; the fourth, and northeastern,\r\ncorner is marked by the star Alpheratz in Andromeda. Each side of the\r\nsquare is about 18[deg] long.\r\n\r\nThe horse is generally seen upside down, with his fore feet projected\r\nup into the sky. Only the head, neck, and fore feet are represented.\r\nThe star Enif marks the nose.\r\n\r\n[p] is an interesting double, easily seen in an opera-glass. All the\r\nstars of the Square are approaching us at an inconceivable speed.\r\n\r\nThe position of the asterism Equus or Equ[=u]leus, the Little Horse,\r\nor Horse's Head, is shown in the diagram.\r\n\r\nDelphinus, the water jar of Aquarius, and the circlet in the Western\r\nFish, are all in the vicinity of Pegasus, and indicated in the\r\ndiagram.\r\n\r\nThe winged horse is found on coins of Corinth 500 to 430 B.C. The\r\nGreeks called this constellation [Greek: hippos].\r\n\r\nPegasus seems to have been regarded in Phoenicia and Egypt as the sky\r\nemblem of a ship.\r\n\r\nWithin the area of the Square Argelander counted thirty naked-eye\r\nstars.\r\n\r\nNote a fine pair in Equ[=u]leus just west of the star Enif in Pegasus.\r\n\r\nThe position of the equinoctial colure is defined by a line connecting\r\nPolaris, [b] Cassiopeiae, [a] Andromedae, and [g] Pegasi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PEGASUS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANDROMEDA (an-drom'-e-d[:a])--THE CHAINED LADY.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--The star [a] Alpheratz is at the northeastern corner of the\r\ngreat square of Pegasus, one of the stellar landmarks.\r\n\r\nRunning east from [a], at almost equal distances, are four other\r\nstars, two of which are of the second magnitude. The most easterly one\r\nis [b] Persei, known as Algol, the famous variable. Lines connecting\r\nthe stars [g] Andromedae, Algol, and [a] Persei form a right-angled\r\ntriangle. The right angle is marked by Algol.\r\n\r\nThe chief object of interest in this constellation is the great\r\nnebula, the first to be discovered. It can be seen by the naked eye\r\nand it is a fine sight in an opera-glass. Its location is indicated in\r\nthe diagram.\r\n\r\nThe star [g] is the radiant point of the Bielid meteors, looked for in\r\nNovember. It is a colored double visible in a 3\" glass.\r\n\r\nThe great nebula has been called the \"Queen of the Nebulae.\" It is said\r\nto have been known as far back as A.D. 905, and it was described 986\r\nA.D. as the \"Little Cloud.\"\r\n\r\nAndromeda is very favorable for observation in September, low in the\r\neastern sky.\r\n\r\nNote the characteristic \"Y\" shaped asterism known as Gloria Frederika\r\nor Frederik's Glory. It lies about at the apex of a nearly isosceles\r\ntriangle of which a line connecting Alpheratz and [b] Pegasi is the\r\nbase. A line drawn from [d] to [a] Cassiopeiae and prolonged a little\r\nover twice its length points it out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANDROMEDA]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSEUS (per'-s[=u]s)--THE CHAMPION. (Face Northeast.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--[a] Persei lies on a line drawn from [b] to [g] Andromedae,\r\nand is about 9[deg] from the latter. The most striking feature in Perseus\r\nis the so-called \"segment of Perseus,\" a curve of stars beginning\r\nabout 12[deg] below Cassiopeia, and curving toward Ursa Major. Note the\r\nfamous variable Algol the Demon star. It represents the Medusa's head\r\nwhich Perseus holds in his hand. It varies from the second to the\r\nfourth magnitude in about three and one-half hours, and back again in\r\nthe same time, after which it remains steadily brilliant for two and\r\nthree-quarters days, when the same change recurs. Algenib and Algol\r\nform with [g] Andromedae, a right-angled triangle.\r\n\r\nNote a dull red star near Algol, and a pretty pair just above Algenib.\r\n\r\nAn opera-glass reveals much that is worthy of observation in this\r\nregion of the sky. It has been said of the clusters between Cassiopeia\r\nand Perseus that they form the most striking sidereal spectacle in the\r\nnorthern heavens. They are visible to the naked eye. Algenib never\r\nsets in the latitude of New York, just touching the horizon at its\r\nlower culmination. It is estimated that Algol is a little over a\r\nmillion miles in diameter, [[^e]] has three faint stars on one side\r\nnearly in a line, and one on the other--a miniature representation of\r\nJupiter and his satellites.\r\n\r\nAlgol, when on the meridian of New York City, is only one tenth of a\r\ndegree from the zenith point. This remarkable variable has a dark\r\ncompanion star revolving near it obscuring its light in part from us\r\nat stated intervals. By means of the spectroscope the speed diameter\r\nand mass of this invisible star has been reckoned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PERSEUS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPISCES (pis'[=e]z)--THE FISHES. (Face Southeast.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--This constellation is represented by two fishes each with a\r\nribbon tied to its tail. One, the Northern Fish, lies just below [b]\r\nAndromedae,--the other, represented by the circlet, is just below\r\nPegasus. The ribbons, represented by streams of faint stars, from a\r\n\"V\" with elongated sides, and terminate in the star Al Rischa, The\r\nKnot.\r\n\r\nBelow [[^o]], and to the east of [l] the spot marked (*) is the place\r\nwhich the sun occupies at the time of the equinox. It is one of the\r\ntwo crossing places of the equinoctial, or equator, of the heavens,\r\nand the ecliptic, or sun's path.\r\n\r\nBelow Pisces is Cetus, the Whale.\r\n\r\nPisces is thought to have taken its name from its coincidence with the\r\nsun during the rainy season.\r\n\r\nThree distinct conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn took place in this\r\nconstellation in the year 747 of Rome.\r\n\r\nPisces was considered the national constellation of the Jews, as well\r\nas a tribal symbol.\r\n\r\nIn 1881, Jupiter, Saturn, and Venus were grouped together in Pisces.\r\n\r\nThe Circlet is a very striking group forming a pentagon. The glass\r\nreveals two faint stars in addition, making the figure seven-sided or\r\nelliptical in form.\r\n\r\nAs to the number of the stars as classified according to their\r\nmagnitude, that is their brightness, it may be mentioned that there\r\nare approximately 20 stars of the first magnitude, 65 of the second,\r\n300 of the third, and 450 of the fourth. We cannot see stars fainter\r\nthan the sixth magnitude with the naked eye.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PISCES]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIANGULUM (tr[=i]-an'-g[=u]-lum)--THE TRIANGLE. (Face East.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--A line drawn from the star [g] Pegasi to Algol in Perseus\r\npasses through [b] Trianguli.\r\n\r\nThe triangle is clearly defined and a beautiful figure. It lies just\r\nbelow Andromeda, and above Aries.\r\n\r\nTriangulum is a very ancient constellation, being formerly named\r\nDeltoton, from the Greek letter Delta [D].\r\n\r\nIt was in this locality that Piazzi discovered the asteroid Ceres,\r\nJanuary 1, 1800.\r\n\r\n[a] Trianguli is sometimes called \"Caput Trianguli.\"\r\n\r\n[a] and [b] Trianguli were known as \"The Scale Beam.\" According to\r\nArgelander the constellation contains fifteen stars.\r\n\r\nThe Triangle has been likened to the Trinity, and the Mitre of St.\r\nPeter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRIANGULUM]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAQUARIUS (a-kw[=a]'ri-us)--THE WATER CARRIER. (Face Southwest.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--A line drawn from [b] Pegasi to [a] of the same\r\nconstellation, and prolonged as far again, ends just east of the\r\nso-called water jar of Aquarius, which is formed by a group of four\r\nstars in the form of a \"Y,\" as indicated in the diagram. The Arabians\r\ncalled these four stars a tent.\r\n\r\nThe jar is represented as inverted, allowing a stream of water\r\nrepresented by dim stars in pairs and groups of three stars, to\r\ndescend, ending in the bright star Fomalhaut, the mouth of the\r\nSouthern Fish.\r\n\r\nA rough map of South America can be traced in the stars [th], [l],\r\n[t], [d], 88, [i].\r\n\r\nA rude dipper can be made out in the western part of the\r\nconstellation, formed of the stars [a], [b], [n], [e].\r\n\r\nThe stars [t] and [z] are doubles. Of the former pair, one is white,\r\nthe other orange in color. Fomalhaut was the object of sunrise worship\r\nin the temple of Demeter at Eleusis in 500 B.C. The ancients called\r\nthis region of the sky \"the Sea.\"\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of [d], Mayer observed in 1756 what he termed a fixed\r\nstar. Herschel thought it a comet. It proved to be the planet Uranus.\r\n\r\n[z] is almost exactly on the celestial equator.\r\n\r\n[l] is a red star, the most prominent of the first stars in the\r\nstream. The stars in Piscis Australis can be traced out with an\r\nopera-glass.\r\n\r\nFomalhaut and Capella, in Auriga, rise almost exactly at the same\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nFomalhaut is one of the four \"royal stars\" of astrology. The others\r\nare Regulus, Antares, and Aldebaran.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AQUARIUS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPRICORNUS (kap-ri-k[^o]r'-nus)--THE SEA GOAT. (Face Southwest.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--A line drawn from [a] Pegasi through [z] and [th] in the\r\nsame constellation, and projected about 25[deg], strikes [a] and [b] in\r\nCapricornus.\r\n\r\nThis constellation contains three principal stars--[a] and [b]\r\nmentioned above, and [d] about 20[deg] east of them.\r\n\r\nThe water jar of Aquarius is about the same distance northeast of [d]\r\nCapricorni that Fomalhaut, in the Southern Fish, is southeast of it.\r\n\r\n[a] has a companion which can be seen by the naked eye. It is a fine\r\nsight in an opera-glass. These two stars are gradually separating.\r\n\r\n[b] is a double star, one being blue, the other yellow.\r\n\r\nThe constellation resembles a chapeau, or peaked hat, upside down.\r\n\r\nThe stars in the head of the Sea Goat, [a] and [b] are only 2[deg] apart,\r\nand can hardly be mistaken by an observer facing the southwestern sky\r\nduring the early evening in autumn.\r\n\r\nFive degrees east of [d] is the point announced by Le Verrier as the\r\nposition of his predicted new planet, Neptune.\r\n\r\nFlammarion claims that the Chinese astronomers noted the five planets\r\nin conjunction in Capricornus, in the year 2449 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe sign of the Goat was called by the ancient Orientalists \"The\r\nSouthern Gate of the Sun.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPRICORNUS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARIES ([=a]'-ri-[=e]z)--THE RAM. (Face Southeast.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--The star [a] in Aries, known as Hamal, and sometimes as\r\nArietis, a star of the second magnitude, is about 7[deg] south of [a]\r\nTrianguli. A line drawn from the Pole Star to [g] Andromedae, and\r\nprolonged about 20[deg], ends at Hamal.\r\n\r\nAries contains three principal stars, forming a characteristic\r\nobtuse-angled triangle.\r\n\r\nThe star [g] Arietis was one of the first double stars discovered. A\r\ntelescope is required to split it. Hamal lies near the path of the\r\nmoon, and is one of the stars from which longitude is reckoned.\r\n\r\nBelow Aries may be seen the characteristic pentagon in the head of\r\nCetus, the Whale.\r\n\r\nMore than two thousand years ago Aries was the leading constellation\r\nof the zodiac, and now stands first in the list of zodiacal signs.\r\n\r\nThe Arabians knew this constellation as Al Hamal, the sheep.\r\n\r\n[b] and [g] are one instance out of many where stars of more than\r\nordinary brightness are seen together in pairs, the brightest star\r\nbeing generally on the east.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARIES]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCETUS (s[=e]'-tus)--THE WHALE. (Face Southeast.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--A line drawn from Polaris, to [d] Cassiopeiae, and prolonged\r\ntwo and one third times its original length, reaches the centre of\r\nthis constellation.\r\n\r\nIt lies just below Aries and the Triangle, and resembles the figure of\r\nthe prehistoric icthyosaurus, while some see in the outline an easy\r\nchair. The head of the beast is characterized by a clearly traced\r\npentagon, about 20[deg] southeast of Aries. The brightest star in the\r\nconstellation is [a] of the second magnitude. It is at one apex of the\r\npentagon, about 15[deg] east of Al Rischa in Pisces, and 37[deg] directly\r\nsouth of Algol.\r\n\r\nThe noted variable Mira also known as [o] Ceti is the chief object of\r\ninterest in this constellation.\r\n\r\nIt was discovered by Fabricius in 1596 and varies from the ninth\r\nmagnitude to the third or fourth in a period of 334 days. It can be\r\nobserved during its entire range with a 3\" glass.\r\n\r\nIn 1779 Mira is reported to have been as bright as the first-magnitude\r\nstar Aldebaran. It lies almost exactly on a line joining [g] and [z]\r\nCeti a little nearer the former. Ten degrees south of it are four\r\nfaint stars about 3[deg] apart forming a square.\r\n\r\n[t] Ceti is one of our nearest neighbors at a distance of nine light\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n[z] is a naked-eye double star.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CETUS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSCA (mus'-k[:a])--THE FLY. (Face Southeast.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--Musca lies between Triangulum and Aries, the diagram\r\nclearly defining its position.\r\n\r\nThe four stars composing it form a group shaped like the letter \"Y.\"\r\n\r\nThere is nothing of particular interest to be noted in this asterism.\r\nIt does not appear on modern star charts and is considered obsolete.\r\n\r\nSo great is the distance that separates us from the stars that as for\r\nthe great majority had they been blotted out of existence before the\r\nChristian era, we of to-day should still receive their light and seem\r\nto see them just as we do. When we scan the nocturnal skies we study\r\nancient history. We do not see the stars as they are but as they were\r\ncenturies on centuries ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUSCA]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETEORIC SHOWERS.\r\n\r\nOCTOBER TO JANUARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +-----------------+-------+-----------------+---------------+--------------+--------+\r\n  |                 |       |                 |               | Other Dates  |        |\r\n  | Name of Shower  | Date  |  Radiant Point  |Characteristics|       of     |Location|\r\n  |                 |       |                 |               | Observation  |        |\r\n  +-----------------+-------+-----------------+---------------+--------------+--------+\r\n  |                 |       |  Between Great  |               |              |        |\r\n  |     Ursids      |Oct. 4 | Bear's head and |    Sw.

A \"V\" shaped group known\r\nas the Hyades is just to the southeast of the Pleiades, in the face of\r\nthe Bull, forming one of the most beautiful objects in the sky.\r\n\r\nThe brightest star in Taurus is Aldebaran, a ruddy-hued star known as\r\n\"The Follower.\" It is at the beginning of the \"V\" in the Hyades, and\r\nis at the apex of a triangle formed by Capella, in Auriga, and [a]\r\nPersei, and equally distant from them both.\r\n\r\nThe star [b] called Nath, is peculiarly white, and is common to Taurus\r\nand Auriga. It represents the tip of one of the Bull's horns, and the\r\nright foot of the Charioteer. The Pleiades are mentioned in Chinese\r\nannals in 2357 B.C. On a photograph of the group over 2000 stars have\r\nbeen counted.\r\n\r\nThe ecliptic passes a little south of a point midway between the two\r\nhorns, where a scattered and broken stream of minute stars can be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nNote two pretty pairs in the Hyades, one south of Aldebaran, the other\r\nnorthwest of it.\r\n\r\nThere are rich clusters below the tip of the horn over Orion's head.\r\n\r\nTaurus was an important object of worship by the Druids.\r\n\r\nAldebaran is near one eye of the Bull, and used to be called \"The\r\nBull's Eye.\" An occultation of it by the moon, which not infrequently\r\noccurs, is a striking phenomenon.\r\n\r\nThe Eskimos regard the Pleiades as a team of dogs in pursuit of a\r\nbear. The group is receding from us at the rate of thirteen miles a\r\nsecond and has a common eastward motion of about ten seconds a\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAURUS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORION ([)o]-r[=i]'-on)--THE GIANT HUNTER. (Face South.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--Orion is considered the finest constellation in the\r\nheavens. A line drawn from Nath to [z] Tauri (the tips of the Bull's\r\nhorns), and extended 15[deg], strikes the brilliant Betelgeuze in Orion,\r\nknown as the martial star. It forms the northeast corner of a\r\nconspicuous parallelogram. The splendid first-magnitude star Rigel is\r\ndiagonally opposite Betelgeuze, and the girdle and sword of the Hunter\r\nlie within the parallelogram, a very striking group. The former is\r\nrepresented by three bright stars in a line 3[deg] long known as the\r\n\"Three Stars,\" because there are no other stars in the heavens that\r\nexactly resemble them in position and brightness.\r\n\r\nIn the sword there is the most remarkable nebula in the heavens. It\r\nmay be seen with an opera-glass and in a telescope it is a wonderful\r\nsight. Bellatrix is called the Amazon star. Note the contrasting\r\ncolours of [a] and [b].\r\n\r\nAbout 9[deg] west of Bellatrix are eight stars in a curved line running\r\nnorth and south. These point out the Lion's skin held in the Hunter's\r\nleft hand.\r\n\r\nBelow [l] there are two stars forming a triangle with it. Flammarion\r\ncalls this region the California of the sky.\r\n\r\nThe celestial equator passes nearly through [d].\r\n\r\nOrion was worshipped in China during the one thousand years before our\r\nera, and was known to the Chinese as the \"White Tiger.\"\r\n\r\nThe Eskimos see in the Belt stars the three steps cut by some\r\ncelestial Eskimo in a steep snow bank to enable him to reach the top.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ORION]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEPUS (l[=e]'-pus)--THE HARE. (Face South.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--Lepus crouches under Orion's feet. Four stars in the\r\nconstellation form an irregular and conspicuous quadrilateral.\r\n\r\n[g] is a beautiful double of a greenish hue.\r\n\r\nFour or five degrees south of Rigel are four faint stars which are in\r\nthe ear of the hare. They can be seen on a clear night with the naked\r\neye.\r\n\r\nThe curved line of three stars [th], [[^e]], and [z], are in the back of\r\nthe hare.\r\n\r\nLepus is about 18[deg] west of Canis Major, and, by reason of the earth's\r\nmotion, the Great Dog seems to be pursuing the Hare around the\r\nheavens.\r\n\r\nThe first-magnitude stars that are visible in the winter season in\r\nthis latitude present a fine contrast in color. Even the untrained eye\r\ncan see a decided difference between the bluish white color of the\r\nbrilliant Sirius, the Dog star that the Belt stars point south to, and\r\nRigel, and the ruddy Betelgeuze. Procyon has a yellowish tinge and\r\nresembles the condition of our sun, while Betelgeuze is surrounded by\r\nheavy metallic vapors and is thought to be approaching extinction.\r\n\r\nR marks the location of \"Hind's crimson star,\" a famous variable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEPUS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBA NOACHI (co-lum'-b[:a] n[=o]-[:a]'-ki)--NOAH'S DOVE. (Face South.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--Columba is situated just south of Lepus. A line drawn from\r\nRigel, in Orion, to [b] Leporis, and prolonged as far again, ends near\r\n[a] and [b], the two brightest stars in Columba.\r\n\r\nA line drawn from the easternmost star in the belt of Orion, 32[deg]\r\ndirectly south, will point out Phaet, in Columba. It makes with\r\nSirius, in Canis Major, and Naos, in the Ship, a large equilateral\r\ntriangle.\r\n\r\nThe star [b] Columbae may be known by means of a smaller star just east\r\nof it, marked [g].\r\n\r\nThe Chinese call [a] Chang Jin, the old Folks. Lockyer thinks it was\r\nof importance in Egyptian temple worship, and observed from Edfu and\r\nPhilae as far back as 6400 B.C.\r\n\r\nOn a clear starlight night there are not more than a thousand stars\r\nvisible to the naked eye at one time. The largest telescope reveals\r\nnearly a hundred million.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLUMBA]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANIS MAJOR (k[=a]'-nis m[=a]-jor)--THE GREATER DOG. (Face South.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--The three stars in Orion's girdle point southeast to\r\nSirius, the dog star, in Canis Major, the most brilliant star in the\r\nheavens. It was connected in the minds of the Egyptians with the\r\nrising of the Nile, and is receding from the earth at the rate of\r\ntwenty miles a second.\r\n\r\nThe star [n] is a triple. The cluster (41 M.) can be seen with an\r\nopera-glass, just below it.\r\n\r\nBetween [d] and [o]^1 note a remarkable array of minute stars, also the\r\nvery red star 22.\r\n\r\n[d] and [z] are doubles for an opera-glass.\r\n\r\nBelow [[^e]] there is a fine group.\r\n\r\nBetelgeuze, in Orion, Procyon, in Canis Minor, and Sirius form a\r\nnearly equilateral triangle. These stars with Naos, in the Ship, and\r\nPhaet, in the Dove, form a huge figure known as the Egyptian \"X.\"\r\n\r\nFrom earliest times Sirius has been known as the Dog of Orion. It is\r\n324 times brighter than the average sixth-magnitude star, and is the\r\nnearest to the earth of all the stars in this latitude, its distance\r\nbeing 8.7 light years. At this distance the Sun would appear as a star\r\na little brighter than the Pole Star.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CANIS MAJOR]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARGO NAVIS ([:a]r'-go n[=a]'-vis)--THE SHIP ARGO. (Face South.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--Argo is situated southeast of Canis Major. If a line\r\njoining Betelgeuze and Sirius be prolonged 18[deg] southeast, it will\r\npoint out Naos, a star of the second magnitude in the rowlock of the\r\nShip. This star is in the southeast corner of the Egyptian \"X.\"\r\n\r\nThe star [p] is of a deep yellow or orange hue. It has three little\r\nstars above it, two of which form a pretty pair.\r\n\r\nThe star [z] has a companion, which is a test for an opera-glass.\r\n\r\nThe star [k] is a double for an opera-glass.\r\n\r\nNote the fine star cluster (46 M.).\r\n\r\nThe star Markeb forms a small triangle with two other stars near it.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians believed that this was the ark that bore Osiris and Isis\r\nover the Deluge.\r\n\r\nThe constellation contains two noted objects invisible in this\r\nlatitude, Canopus, the second brightest star, and the remarkable\r\nvariable star [[^e]].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PUPPIS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONOCEROS (m[=o]-nos'-e-ros)--THE UNICORN. (Face South.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--Monoceros is to be found east of Orion between Canis Major\r\nand Canis Minor. Three of its stars of the fourth magnitude form a\r\nstraight line northeast and southwest, about 9[deg] east of Betelgeuze,\r\nand about the same distance south of Alhena, in Gemini.\r\n\r\nThe region around the stars 8, 13, 17 is particularly rich when viewed\r\nwith an opera-glass.\r\n\r\nNote also a beautiful field about the variable S, and a cluster about\r\nmidway between [a] and [b].\r\n\r\nTwo stars about 7[deg] apart in the tail of the Unicorn are pointer stars\r\nto Procyon. These stars are known as 30 and 31. The former is about\r\n16[deg] east of Procyon, and is easily identified as it has a\r\nsixth-magnitude star on either side of it. About 4[deg] southwest of this\r\nstar a good field-glass will reveal a beautiful star cluster.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONOCEROS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nERIDANUS ([=e]-rid'-a-nus)--OR THE RIVER PO. (Face Southwest.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--Three degrees north and 2[deg] west of Rigel, in Orion, lies\r\n[b] Eridani, the source of the River. Thence it flows west till it\r\nreaches [p] Ceti, then drops south 5[deg], thence east southeast, its\r\ntotal length being about 130[deg].\r\n\r\nThe great curve the River takes, just east of the Whale, resembles a\r\nhorseshoe.\r\n\r\nAcherna, the first-magnitude star in Eridanus, is too far south to be\r\nseen in this latitude.\r\n\r\nNote the pretty star group around [b] and a pair of stars of an orange\r\nhue below [n].\r\n\r\nThe asterism known as \"The Brandenburg Sceptre,\" consisting of four\r\nstars of the fourth and fifth magnitudes, can be seen arranged in a\r\nstraight line north and south below the first bend in the River just\r\nwest of Lepus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ERIDANUS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETEORIC SHOWERS.\r\n\r\nJANUARY TO APRIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +---------------+--------+------------------+---------------+-------------+----------+\r\n  |               |        |                  |               | Other Dates |          |\r\n  |Name of Shower | Date   |   Radiant Point  |Characteristics|     of      |Location  |\r\n  |               |        |                  |               | Observation |          |\r\n  +---------------+--------+------------------+---------------+-------------+----------+\r\n  | Quadrantids.  | Jan. 2 | (44) Bo[:o]tis,  |               |             |          |\r\n  |  Rich annual  |        |between Bo[:o]tes |   M.

In addition to first-magnitude stars the\r\nrhyme refers to the head of Capricornus, the Sea Goat, the Great\r\nSquare of Pegasus, and Orion's Belt.

In April and May it is north of the zenith. During July and\r\nAugust it is west of north. In October and November it lies close to\r\nthe northern horizon and in January and February it is east of north\r\nwith the pointers highest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLANETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not within the scope of this work to dwell at length on a\r\ndiscussion of the planets. Certain explanatory matter regarding them\r\nis necessary, however, to prevent confusion; for the student must bear\r\nin mind the fact that from time to time the planets appear in the\r\nconstellations, and unless identified would lead him to think that the\r\ndiagrams were inaccurate.\r\n\r\nThe reader is referred to any one of the four large plates that\r\nprecede each season. He will observe that a portion of an ellipse has\r\nbeen traced on each of them, and that this line has been designated\r\nthe Ecliptic, which simply means the sun's apparent pathway across the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nThis pathway is divided into twelve equal parts of thirty degrees\r\neach, and to these twelve divisions are given the names of the\r\nconstellations of the Zodiac in the following order: Aries ([Symbol:\r\nAries]), Taurus ([Symbol: Taurus]), Gemini ([Symbol: Gemini]), Cancer\r\n([Symbol: Cancer]), Leo ([Symbol: Leo]), Virgo ([Symbol: Virgo]),\r\nLibra ([Symbol: Libra]), Scorpio ([Symbol: Scorpio]), Sagittarius\r\n([Symbol: Sagittarius]), Capricornus ([Symbol: Capricornus]), Aquarius\r\n([Symbol: Aquarius]), Pisces ([Symbol: Pisces]).\r\n\r\nThe sun, starting from the first degree of Aries, the first day of\r\nspring, passes through one constellation a month. The planets follow\r\nthe same pathway.\r\n\r\nConfusion, therefore, respecting their identity can only arise in\r\nconnection with a study of one of the twelve constellations named\r\nabove, so that whenever a star of any size is seen in one of these\r\nconstellations, not accounted for in the diagram, the student may\r\nconclude that this is a planet; especially if the unknown star does\r\nnot twinkle. It now remains to identify the planet.\r\n\r\nThis can best be done by referring to an almanac, which states what\r\nplanets are above the horizon, and which are morning and evening\r\nstars. By morning star is meant that the planet is east of the sun; by\r\nevening star, that it is west of the sun.\r\n\r\nIf the planet is in the west, and very brilliant, it is safe to assume\r\nthat it is the planet Venus.\r\n\r\nIf it is brighter than any of the fixed stars, and is some distance\r\nfrom the sun, it is doubtless the colossal Jupiter.\r\n\r\nIf it is very red, it will probably be Mars.\r\n\r\nSaturn is distinguished because of its pale, steady, yellow light.\r\n\r\nAs for Mercury, Uranus, and Neptune, the former is very near the sun,\r\nand seldom seen; while Uranus and Neptune are so inconspicuous as to\r\nlead to no confusion on the part of the novice.\r\n\r\nA few notes of interest relative to the planets follow, taking them up\r\nin regular order passing outward from the sun: Mercury, Venus, Mars,\r\nJupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.\r\n\r\n\r\nMERCURY.\r\n\r\nMercury is the nearest to the sun of any of the planets. On this\r\naccount, and because of its rapid changes, it is seldom seen.\r\n\r\nThe most favorable time for observing it is just after sunset, or just\r\nbefore sunrise, during the months of March, April, August, and\r\nSeptember, when it may be seen for a few successive days.\r\n\r\nThe greatest distance it ever departs from the sun on either side\r\nvaries approximately from sixteen to twenty-eight degrees. Its motion\r\nresembles a pendulum, swinging from one side of the sun to the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nVENUS.\r\n\r\nVenus approaches nearer to the earth and is more brilliant than any\r\nother planet. It is bright enough to cast a shadow at night, and is\r\nsometimes visible even at noonday. It is almost as large as the earth,\r\nand appears to oscillate, as Mercury does, on either side of the sun.\r\n\r\nIt never appears more than three hours after sunset, and as long\r\nbefore the sunrise, and is never more than forty-eight degrees from\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARS.\r\n\r\nMars is most like the earth of any of the planets, and, although not\r\nas interesting an object to view as the more brilliant planets, Venus\r\nand Jupiter, it claims our attention chiefly because of the surmises\r\nrespecting its habitability.\r\n\r\nMars appears to the naked eye as a bright red star, and when at a\r\nfavorable opposition to the earth (which occurs only once in every\r\nfifteen years) it rivals Jupiter in splendor.\r\n\r\nThe planet may be mistaken for the first magnitude stars, Antares in\r\nScorpius, and Aldebaran in Taurus, near which it frequently passes.\r\n\r\nThe fixed stars, however, twinkle, while Mars glows steadily. If there\r\nis any doubt in the student's mind as to the identity of the planet, a\r\nfew nights of observation, noting the changes in the planet's\r\nposition, will decide the point. It takes Mars about fifty-seven days\r\nto pass through one constellation in the Zodiac.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUPITER.\r\n\r\nJupiter is the largest of all the planets in the solar system, and it\r\nis easily distinguished from the fixed stars because of its brilliancy\r\nand splendor, exceeding in brightness all the planets excepting Venus,\r\nand casting a perceptible shadow.\r\n\r\nIt moves slowly and majestically across the sky, advancing through the\r\nZodiac at the rate of one constellation yearly. It is therefore a\r\nsimple matter to forecast its position, for, in whatever constellation\r\nit is seen to-day, one year hence it will be seen equally advanced in\r\nthe next constellation.\r\n\r\nAlthough Jupiter appears to move slowly, it really travels at the\r\nincomprehensible rate of five hundred miles a minute.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting feature about Jupiter for the amateur astronomer\r\nconsists in observing four of its moons, which are visible with a\r\nsmall telescope. They appear like mere dots of light, and their\r\ntransit of or occultation with the planet (that is, their\r\ndisappearance before or behind its disk) can be watched, and is a\r\nnever failing source of pleasure. A large telescope alone reveals\r\nJupiter's four other moons.\r\n\r\n\r\nSATURN.\r\n\r\nSaturn is farther removed from the earth than any of the planets in\r\nthe solar system, visible to the naked eye. It is distinguished from\r\nthe fixed stars by the steadiness of its light, which is dull and of a\r\nyellow hue, though to some it appears to be of a greenish tinge. It\r\nseems barely to move, so slow is its motion among the stars, for it\r\ntakes two and one half years to pass through a single constellation of\r\nthe Zodiac.\r\n\r\nSaturn has eight moons. Titan, its largest one, can be seen with a 3\"\r\nglass. Its celebrated rings are telescopic objects but a small glass\r\nreveals them.\r\n\r\n\r\nURANUS.\r\n\r\nThe student will hardly mistake Uranus for a fixed star, as it is only\r\nunder the most favorable circumstances that it can be seen with the\r\nnaked eye.\r\n\r\nAt its nearest approach to the earth, it is as bright as a\r\nsixth-magnitude star. Uranus is accompanied by four moons, and takes\r\nseven years to pass through a constellation of the Zodiac.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEPTUNE.\r\n\r\nNeptune is the most distant of the planets in the solar system, and is\r\nnever visible to the naked eye.\r\n\r\nThe earth comes properly under a discussion of the planets, but a\r\ndescription of it is hardly within the scope of this work.\r\n\r\nConfusion in identifying the planets is really confined to Mars and\r\nSaturn, for Venus and Jupiter are much brighter than any of the fixed\r\nstars, and their position in the heavens identifies them, as we have\r\nseen before.\r\n\r\nThe following table of first-magnitude stars in the Zodiacal\r\nconstellations confines the question of identifying the planets to a\r\ncomparison of the unknown star with the following-named stars:\r\n\r\n  Castor and Pollux in Gemini.\r\n  Spica             \"  Virgo.\r\n  Regulus           \"  Leo.\r\n  Aldebaran         \"  Taurus.\r\n  Antares           \"  Scorpius.\r\n\r\nThe first four stars named above are white in color, so that either\r\nMars or Saturn is readily distinguished from them.\r\n\r\nAs for Aldebaran and Antares, which are both red stars, not unlike\r\nMars and Saturn in color and magnitude, the fact that the latter do\r\nnot twinkle, and that they do not appear in the diagrams, should\r\nsatisfy the observer of their identity. Reference to an almanac, or a\r\nfew nights of observation, will in any case set at rest any doubt in\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PLANETARY ORBITS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPARATIVE SIZE OF THE PLANETS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MILKY WAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Milky Way, or Galaxy as it is sometimes called, is a great band of\r\nlight that stretches across the heavens. Certain portions of it are\r\nworthy of being viewed with an opera-glass, which separates this\r\nseemingly confused and hazy stream into numberless points of light,\r\nemanating from myriads of suns.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful feature of the heavens is seen to best advantage during\r\nthe months of July, August, September, and October. Beginning near the\r\nhead of Cepheus, about thirty degrees from the North Pole, it passes\r\nthrough Cassiopeia, Perseus, Auriga, part of Orion, and the feet of\r\nGemini, where it crosses the Ecliptic, and thence continues into the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, beyond our ken in these latitudes.\r\n\r\nIt reappears in two branches in the region of Ophiuchus, one running\r\nthrough the tail of Scorpius, the bow of Sagittarius, Aquila,\r\nDelphinus, and Cygnus; the other above and almost parallel to it,\r\nuniting with the first branch in Cygnus, and passing to Cepheus, the\r\nplace of beginning.\r\n\r\nThe student should note especially the strange gap between [a], [g],\r\nand [e] Cygni. This dark space has been called the \"Coal Sack.\"\r\n\r\nThe Milky Way in the vicinity of Cassiopeia is particularly rich, and\r\nwell repays a search with an opera-glass.\r\n\r\n\"The Galaxy covers more than one tenth of the visible heavens,\r\ncontains nine-tenths of the visible stars, and seems a vast\r\nzone-shaped nebula, nearly a great circle of the sphere, the poles\r\nbeing at Coma and Cetus.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOTIONS OF THE STARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be that the student desires to proceed in this conquest of the\r\nsky at a more rapid pace than the scheme of study permits. To assist\r\nsuch, it should be borne in mind that the circumpolar constellations,\r\nas Ursa Major, Ursa Minor, Draco, Cepheus, and Cassiopeia, are\r\ndesignated,--are visible in our latitude in the northern sky every\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nA reference to their diagrams, and a glance at any of the large plates\r\nshowing the entire group in their respective positions, will suffice\r\nfor the student to identify them.\r\n\r\nThe hours of darkness alone limit the speed with which a knowledge of\r\nthe constellations can be acquired.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that the student begins his search for the constellations\r\non the night of April 1st, at nine P.M. He has for his guide the large\r\nplate, and the spring group of eleven constellations set forth in the\r\ndiagrams. The remaining three constellations of the circumpolar group\r\nare, as we have seen before, visible in the north.\r\n\r\nIf he faces the western sky, he will see Andromeda just setting, and\r\nPerseus, Taurus, Orion, Lepus, and Canis Major but a short distance\r\nabove the horizon. If he is so fortunate as to be able to identify\r\nthese, and the spring group, he may turn his attention wholly to the\r\neastern sky, where new constellations await him.\r\n\r\nIn the southeast he may see Virgo. In the east well up blazes\r\nArcturus, the gem of Bo[:o]tes, below which is the beautiful Northern\r\nCrown, with the diamond in the head of Serpens beneath it. Hercules is\r\nrising, and Vega in the Lyre should be seen just flashing on the view\r\nin the northeast.\r\n\r\nThis completes the list of wonders visible at this precise time, but\r\nthe stars apparently are never still, and doubtless, while the student\r\nhas been passing from one constellation to another in the western and\r\nsouthern skies, others have been rising in the east and northeast.\r\n\r\nAt ten P.M. the Lyre is well up, and Ophiuchus and Libra can be\r\ndiscerned. At midnight Scorpius and Cygnus are ready to claim the\r\nattention. By two o'clock A.M., Aquila, Delphinus, and Sagittarius\r\nhave risen, and at break of day Andromeda, Pegasus, and Capricornus\r\ncan be seen if the student has had the courage to remain awake this\r\nlength of time.\r\n\r\nIn no way can the seeming movement of the stars be better understood\r\nthan by actual observation. The observer must bear in mind that the\r\nmovement is an apparent one: that it is the earth that is moving and\r\nnot the stars. He has only to think of the analogy of the moving train\r\nbeside the one that is standing still, and the true state of affairs\r\nwill at once be evident.\r\n\r\nTo further appreciate this apparent change in the situation of the\r\nconstellations, the student should refer to the large plates\r\nsuccessively. In each successive one he will note the advancement\r\nwestward of the constellations mentioned above, rising in the east\r\nlate at night.\r\n\r\nThe student can best get an idea of this westward apparent movement of\r\nthe stars by noting the position of some bright first-magnitude star\r\nfrom night to night. He will soon be able to calculate the position of\r\nthis star a month or more ahead, and this calculation applies to all\r\nthe constellations and stars.\r\n\r\nIt is not within the scope of this work to go into this matter in\r\ndetail. The author merely desires to mention this fact of apparent\r\nchange of position in the stars, a fact that will be noticeable to the\r\nobserver in a short time, and a fact that it is hoped he will be able\r\nto explain to his own satisfaction with the aid of the foregoing\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the stars on the diagrams are all numbered and\r\nlettered. The numbers refer to the magnitude of the star,--that is,\r\nthe brightness of it, the first-magnitude stars being the brightest,\r\nthe second-magnitude stars two-and-a-half times less bright, etc.\r\n\r\nThe letters are those of the Greek alphabet, and the student if not\r\nfamiliar with it is advised to consult a Greek grammar.\r\n\r\nIn the text, in referring to certain stars in the constellations, the\r\ngenitive case of the Latin name of the constellation is given; for\r\nexample, Vega is known as [a] Lyrae, meaning alpha of Lyra, Aldebaran\r\nas [a] Tauri, alpha of Taurus, etc.\r\n\r\nThe twilight hour affords an excellent opportunity of fixing the\r\nrelative positions of the first-magnitude stars in the mind, for at\r\nthat time they alone, save the planets, are visible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETEORS, OR SHOOTING-STARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs this work is designed primarily to cover what is observable in the\r\nstarlit heavens with the naked eye, the subject of meteors, or\r\nshooting-stars, comes properly within its scope.\r\n\r\nThere are few persons, if any, who have not witnessed the sight of a\r\nsplendid meteor speeding across the sky, and such a sight always calls\r\nforth exclamations of wonder and delight.\r\n\r\nApparently these evanescent wanderers in space are without distinctive\r\nfeatures, and baffle classification; but, like all that nature reveals\r\nto us, they have been found, for the most part, to conform to certain\r\nlaws, and to bear certain marks of resemblance that permit of their\r\nidentification and classification.\r\n\r\nBy careful observation for over fifty years the meteors, generally\r\nspeaking, have been so arranged that they come under the head of one\r\nof the nearly three hundred distinct showers which are now recognized\r\nby astronomers.\r\n\r\nMany of these showers are too feeble and faint to be worthy of the\r\nattention of one not especially interested in the subject, but certain\r\nones are well worth observing. There is always a pleasure in being\r\nable to recognize at a glance a certain definite manifestation of\r\nnature, be it a rare flower or a flashing meteor.\r\n\r\nThe generally accepted theory respecting the meteors is that they were\r\nall originally parts of comets now disintegrated, and the four\r\nwell-known showers of April 20th, August 10th and 14th, and November\r\n27th, bear testimony to this theory.\r\n\r\nThe apparent velocity of the meteors is between ten and forty-five\r\nmiles a second, and their average height is about seventy-six miles at\r\nfirst appearance, and fifty-one miles at disappearance. Occasionally a\r\nmeteor is so large and compact as to escape total destruction, and\r\nfalls to the earth. Specimens of these meteorites are to be found in\r\nour best museums.\r\n\r\nI have seen fit to divide the principal meteor showers into four\r\ngroups, according to the seasons in which they appear, and have placed\r\nthem respectively at the conclusion of each season's work on the\r\nconstellations.\r\n\r\nBy radiant point is meant the point from which the meteors start on\r\ntheir flight. This point is an apparent one, however, due to an\r\nillusion of perspective, for the meteors really approach the earth in\r\nparallel paths.\r\n\r\nThe dates given for these showers are those of the maxima, and the\r\nmeteors should be looked for several nights before and after the dates\r\nspecified.\r\n\r\nThe showers that are to be seen after midnight are, unless of special\r\nnote, omitted.\r\n\r\nThere are, besides the meteors that have been classified, certain\r\nshooting-stars that apparently have no determined radiant point. These\r\nare called sporadic meteors.\r\n\r\nIn these lists of meteors, the radiant point is only approximately\r\ngiven; for scientific purposes a far more exact position is required\r\nin terms of right ascension and declination. There are several good\r\nlists of meteoric showers to be obtained, which afford this\r\ninformation for those who care to pursue the matter more in detail.\r\nSee the Rev. T.W. Webb's book, entitled _Celestial Objects for Common\r\nTelescopes_. For purposes of identification, the radiant points here\r\ngiven will be found for the most part sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\n    Many readers of this book may be the fortunate possessors of\r\n    small telescopes. It may be that they have observed the\r\n    heavens from time to time in a desultory way and have no\r\n    notion that valuable and practical scientific research work\r\n    can be accomplished with a small glass. If those who are\r\n    willing to aid in the great work of astrophysical research\r\n    will communicate with the author he will be pleased to\r\n    outline for them a most practical and fascinating line of\r\n    observational work that will enable them to share in the\r\n    advance of our knowledge respecting the stars. It is work\r\n    that involves no mathematics, and its details are easily\r\n    mastered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NAMES OF THE STARS AND THEIR MEANINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ACUBENS, [a] _Cancri_, \"the claws.\"\r\n\r\n    Situated in one of the Crab's claws.
