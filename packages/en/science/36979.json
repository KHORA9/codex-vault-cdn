The most conspicuous are the creases or\r\nfolds of the skin which interest the followers of palmistry, but which are\r\nno more significant to others than the creases in old clothes; they show\r\nthe lines of most frequent flexure, and nothing more. The least\r\nconspicuous marks, but the most numerous by far, are the so-called\r\npapillary ridges; they form the subject of the present book. If they had\r\nbeen only twice as large as they are, they would have attracted general\r\nattention and been commented on from the earliest times. Had Dean Swift\r\nknown and thought of them, when writing about the Brobdingnags, whom he\r\nconstructs on a scale twelve times as great as our own, he would certainly\r\nhave made Gulliver express horror at the ribbed fingers of the giants who\r\nhandled him. The ridges on their palms would have been as broad as the\r\nthongs of our coach-whips.\r\n\r\nLet no one despise the ridges on account of their smallness, for they are\r\nin some respects the most important of all anthropological data. We shall\r\nsee that they form patterns, considerable in size and of a curious variety\r\nof shape, whose boundaries can be firmly outlined, and which are little\r\nworlds in themselves. They have the unique merit of retaining all their\r\npeculiarities unchanged throughout life, and afford in consequence an\r\nincomparably surer criterion of identity than any other bodily feature.\r\nThey may be made to throw welcome light on some of the most interesting\r\nbiological questions of the day, such as heredity, symmetry, correlation,\r\nand the nature of genera and species. A representation of their lineations\r\nis easily secured in a self-recorded form, by inking the fingers in the\r\nway that will be explained, and pressing them on paper. There is no\r\nprejudice to be overcome in procuring these most trustworthy sign-manuals,\r\nno vanity to be pacified, no untruths to be guarded against.\r\n\r\nMy attention was first drawn to the ridges in 1888 when preparing a\r\nlecture on Personal Identification for the Royal Institution, which had\r\nfor its principal object an account of the anthropometric method of\r\nBertillon, then newly introduced into the prison administration of France.\r\nWishing to treat the subject generally, and having a vague knowledge of\r\nthe value sometimes assigned to finger marks, I made inquiries, and was\r\nsurprised to find, both how much had been done, and how much there\r\nremained to do, before establishing their theoretical value and practical\r\nutility.\r\n\r\nEnough was then seen to show that the subject was of real importance, and\r\nI resolved to investigate it; all the more so, as the modern processes of\r\nphotographic printing would enable the evidence of such results as might\r\nbe arrived at, to be presented to the reader on an enlarged and easily\r\nlegible form, and in a trustworthy shape. Those that are put forward in\r\nthe following pages, admit of considerable extension and improvement, and\r\nit is only the fact that an account of them seems useful, which causes me\r\nto delay no further before submitting what has thus far been attained, to\r\nthe criticism of others.\r\n\r\nI have already published the following memoirs upon this subject:\r\n\r\n    1. \"Personal Identification.\" _Journal Royal Inst._ 25th May 1888, and\r\n    _Nature_, 28th June 1888.\r\n\r\n    2. \"Patterns in Thumb and Finger Marks.\" _Phil. Trans. Royal Society_,\r\n    vol. clxxxii. (1891) b. pp. 1-23. [This almost wholly referred to\r\n    thumb marks.]\r\n\r\n    3. \"Method of Indexing Finger Marks.\" _Proc. Royal Society_, vol.\r\n    xlix. (1891).\r\n\r\n    4. \"Identification by Finger Tips.\" _Nineteenth Century_, August 1891.\r\n\r\nThis first and introductory chapter contains a brief and orderly summary\r\nof the contents of those that follow.\r\n\r\nThe second chapter treats of the previous employment of finger prints\r\namong various nations, which has been almost wholly confined to making\r\ndaubs, without paying any regard to the delicate lineations with which\r\nthis book is alone concerned. Their object was partly superstitious and\r\npartly ceremonial; superstitious, so far as a personal contact between\r\nthe finger and the document was supposed to be of mysterious efficacy:\r\nceremonial, as a formal act whose due performance in the presence of\r\nothers could be attested. A few scattered instances are mentioned of\r\npersons who had made finger prints with enough care to show their\r\nlineations, and who had studied them; some few of these had used them as\r\nsignatures. Attention is especially drawn to Sir William Herschel, who\r\nbrought the method of finger prints into regular official employment when\r\nhe was \"Collector\" or chief administrator of the Hooghly district in\r\nBengal, and my large indebtedness to him is expressed in this chapter and\r\nin other places.\r\n\r\nIn the third chapter various methods of making good prints from the\r\nfingers are described at length, and more especially that which I have now\r\nadopted on a somewhat large scale, at my anthropometric laboratory, which,\r\nthrough the kindness of the authorities of South Kensington, is at present\r\nlodged in the galleries of their Science Collections. There, the ten\r\ndigits of both hands of all the persons who come to be measured, are\r\nimpressed with clearness and rapidity, and a very large collection of\r\nprints is steadily accumulating, each set being, as we shall see, a\r\nsign-manual that differentiates the person who made it, throughout the\r\nwhole of his life, from all the rest of mankind.\r\n\r\nDescriptions are also given of various methods of enlarging a finger print\r\nto a convenient size, when it is desired to examine it closely.\r\nPhotography is the readiest of all; on the other hand the prism (as in a\r\ncamera lucida) has merits of its own, and so has an enlarging pantagraph,\r\nwhen it is furnished with a small microscope and cross wires to serve as a\r\npointer.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth chapter the character and purpose of the ridges, whose\r\nlineations appear in the finger print, are discussed. They have been the\r\ntopic of a considerable amount of careful physiological study in late\r\nyears, by writers who have investigated their development in early periods\r\nof unborn life, as well as their evolutionary history. They are perfectly\r\ndefined in the monkeys, but appear in a much less advanced stage in other\r\nmammalia. Their courses run somewhat independently of the lines of\r\nflexure. They are studded with pores, which are the open mouths of ducts\r\nproceeding from the somewhat deeply-seated glands which secrete\r\nperspiration, so one of their functions is to facilitate the riddance of\r\nthat excretion. The ridges increase in height as the skin is thickened by\r\nhard usage, until callosities begin to be formed, which may altogether\r\nhide them. But the way in which they assist the touch and may tend to\r\nneutralise the dulling effect of a thick protective skin, is still\r\nsomewhat obscure. They certainly seem to help in the discrimination of the\r\ncharacter of surfaces that are variously rubbed between the fingers.\r\n\r\nThese preliminary topics having been disposed of, we are free in the fifth\r\nchapter to enter upon the direct course of our inquiry, beginning with a\r\ndiscussion of the various patterns formed by the lineations. It will be\r\nshown how systems of parallel ridges sweep in bold curves across the\r\npalmar surface of the hand, and how, whenever the boundaries of two\r\nsystems diverge, the interspace is filled up by a compact little system of\r\nits own, variously curved or whorled, having a fictitious resemblance to\r\nan eddy between two currents. An interspace of this kind is found in the\r\nbulb of each finger. The ridges run in parallel lines across the finger,\r\nup to its last joint, beyond which the insertion of the finger-nail causes\r\na compression of the ridges on either side; their intermediate courses are\r\nin consequence so much broadened out that they commonly separate, and form\r\ntwo systems with an interspace between them. The independent patterns that\r\nappear in this interspace upon the bulbs of the fingers, are those with\r\nwhich this book is chiefly concerned.\r\n\r\nAt first sight, the maze formed by the minute lineations is bewildering,\r\nbut it is shown that every interspace can be surely outlined, and when\r\nthis is done, the character of the pattern it encloses, starts\r\nconspicuously into view. Examples are given to show how the outlining is\r\nperformed, and others in which the outlines alone are taken into\r\nconsideration. The cores of the patterns are also characteristic, and are\r\ndescribed separately. It is they alone that have attracted the notice of\r\nprevious inquirers. The outlines fall for the most part into nine distinct\r\ngenera, defined by the relative directions of the divergent ridges that\r\nenclose them. The upper pair (those that run towards the finger-tip) may\r\nunite, or one or other of them may surmount the other, thus making three\r\npossibilities. There are three similar possibilities in respect to the\r\nlower pair; so, as any one of the first group may be combined with any one\r\nof the second, there are 3 x 3, or nine possibilities in all. The practice\r\nof somewhat rolling the finger when printing from it, is necessary in\r\norder to impress enough of its surface to ensure that the points at which\r\nthe boundaries of the pattern begin to diverge, shall be always included.\r\n\r\nPlates are given of the principal varieties of patterns, having regard\r\nonly to their more fundamental differences, and names are attached for the\r\nconvenience of description; specimens are also given of the outlines of\r\nthe patterns in all the ten digits of eight different persons, taken at\r\nhazard, to afford a first idea of the character of the material to be\r\ndealt with. Another and less minute system of classification under three\r\nheads is then described, which is very useful for rough preliminary\r\npurposes, and of which frequent use is made further on. It is into Arches,\r\nLoops, and Whorls. In the Arches, there is no pattern strictly speaking,\r\nfor there is no interspace; the need for it being avoided by a successive\r\nand regular broadening out of the ridges as they cross the bulb of the\r\nfinger. In Loops, the interspace is filled with a system of ridges that\r\nbends back upon itself, and in which no one ridge turns through a complete\r\ncircle. Whorls contain all cases in which at least one ridge turns through\r\na complete circle, and they include certain double patterns which have a\r\nwhorled appearance. The transitional cases are few; they are fully\r\ndescribed, pictured, and classified. One great advantage of the rude A.\r\nL. W. system is that it can be applied, with little risk of error, to\r\nimpressions that are smudged or imperfect; it is therefore very useful so\r\nfar as it goes. Thus it can be easily applied to my own finger prints on\r\nthe title-page, made as they are from digits that are creased and\r\nroughened by seventy years of life, and whose impressions have been\r\nclosely clipped in order to fit them into a limited space.\r\n\r\nA third method of classification is determined by the origin of the ridges\r\nwhich supply the interspace, whether it be from the thumb side or the\r\nlittle-finger side; in other words, from the Inner or the Outer side.\r\n\r\nLastly, a translation from the Latin is given of the famous Thesis or\r\n_Commentatio_ of Purkenje, delivered at the University of Breslau in 1823,\r\ntogether with his illustrations. It is a very rare pamphlet, and has the\r\ngreat merit of having first drawn attention to the patterns and attempted\r\nto classify them.\r\n\r\nIn the sixth chapter we reach the question of Persistence: whether or no\r\nthe patterns are so durable as to afford a sure basis for identification.\r\nThe answer was different from what had been expected. So far as the\r\nproportions of the patterns go, they are _not_ absolutely fixed, even in\r\nthe adult, inasmuch as they change with the shape of the finger. If the\r\nfinger is plumped out or emaciated, or variously deformed by usage, gout,\r\nor age, the proportions of the pattern will vary also. Two prints of the\r\nsame finger, one taken before and the other after an interval of many\r\nyears, cannot be expected to be as closely alike as two prints similarly\r\nmade from the same woodcut. They are far from satisfying the shrewd test\r\nof the stereoscope, which shows if there has been an alteration even of a\r\nletter in two otherwise duplicate pages of print. The measurements vary at\r\ndifferent periods, even in the adult, just as much if not more than his\r\nheight, span, and the lengths of his several limbs. On the other hand, the\r\nnumerous bifurcations, origins, islands, and enclosures in the ridges that\r\ncompose the pattern, are proved to be _almost beyond change_. A comparison\r\nis made between the pattern on a finger, and one on a piece of lace; the\r\nlatter may be stretched or shrunk as a whole, but the threads of which it\r\nis made retain their respective peculiarities. The evidence on which these\r\nconclusions are founded is considerable, and almost wholly derived from\r\nthe collections made by Sir W. Herschel, who most kindly placed them at my\r\ndisposal. They refer to one or more fingers, and in a few instances to the\r\nwhole hand, of fifteen different persons. The intervals before and after\r\nwhich the prints were taken, amount in some cases to thirty years. Some of\r\nthem reach from babyhood to boyhood, some from childhood to youth, some\r\nfrom youth to advanced middle age, one from middle life to incipient old\r\nage. These four stages nearly include the whole of the ordinary life of\r\nman. I have compared altogether some 700 points of reference in these\r\ncouplets of impressions, and only found a single instance of discordance,\r\nin which a ridge that was cleft in a child became united in later years.\r\nPhotographic enlargements are given in illustration, which include between\r\nthem a total of 157 pairs of points of reference, all bearing distinctive\r\nnumerals to facilitate comparison and to prove their unchangeableness.\r\nReference is made to another illustrated publication of mine, which raises\r\nthe total number of points compared to 389, all of which were successful,\r\nwith the single exception above mentioned. The fact of an almost complete\r\npersistence in the peculiarities of the ridges from birth to death, may\r\nnow be considered as determined. They existed before birth, and they\r\npersist after death, until effaced by decomposition.\r\n\r\nIn the seventh chapter an attempt is made to appraise the evidential value\r\nof finger prints by the common laws of Probability, paying great heed not\r\nto treat variations that are really correlated, as if they were\r\nindependent. An artifice is used by which the number of portions is\r\ndetermined, into which a print may be divided, in each of which the purely\r\nlocal conditions introduce so much uncertainty, that a guess derived from\r\na knowledge of the outside conditions is as likely as not to be wrong. A\r\nsquare of six ridge-intervals in the side was shown by three different\r\nsets of experiments to be larger than required; one of four\r\nridge-intervals in the side was too small, but one of five ridge-intervals\r\nappeared to be closely correct. A six-ridge interval square was, however,\r\nat first adopted, in order to gain assurance that the error should be on\r\nthe safe side. As an ordinary finger print contains about twenty-four of\r\nthese squares, the uncertainty in respect to the entire contents of the\r\npattern _due to this cause alone_, is expressed by a fraction of which the\r\nnumerator is 1, and the denominator is 2 multiplied into itself\r\ntwenty-four times, which amounts to a number so large that it requires\r\neight figures to express it.\r\n\r\nA further attempt was made to roughly appraise the neglected uncertainties\r\nrelating to the outside conditions, but large as they are, they seem much\r\ninferior in their joint effect to the magnitude of that just discussed.\r\n\r\nNext it was found possible, by the use of another artifice, to obtain some\r\nidea of the evidential value of identity when two prints agree in all but\r\none, two, three, or any other number of particulars. This was done by\r\nusing the five ridge-interval squares, of which thirty-five may be\r\nconsidered to go into a single finger print, being about the same as the\r\nnumber of the bifurcations, origins, and other points of comparison. The\r\naccidental similarity in their numbers enables us to treat them roughly as\r\nequivalent. On this basis the well-known method of binomial calculation is\r\neasily applied, with the general result that, notwithstanding a failure of\r\nevidence in a few points, as to the identity of two sets of prints, each,\r\nsay, of three fingers, amply enough evidence would be supplied by the\r\nremainder to prevent any doubt that the two sets of prints were made by\r\nthe same person. When a close correspondence exists in respect to all the\r\nten digits, the thoroughness of the differentiation of each man from all\r\nthe rest of the human species is multiplied to an extent far beyond the\r\ncapacity of human imagination. There can be no doubt that the evidential\r\nvalue of identity afforded by prints of two or three of the fingers, is so\r\ngreat as to render it superfluous to seek confirmation from other sources.\r\n\r\nThe eighth chapter deals with the frequency with which the several kinds\r\nof patterns appear on the different digits of the same person, severally\r\nand in connection. The subject is a curious one, and the inquiry\r\nestablishes unexpected relationships and distinctions between different\r\nfingers and between the two hands, to whose origin there is at present no\r\nclue. The relationships are themselves connected in the following\r\nway;--calling any two digits on one of the hands by the letters A and B\r\nrespectively, and the digit on the other hand, that corresponds to B, by\r\nthe symbol B1, then the kinship between A and B1 is identical, in a\r\nstatistical sense, with the kinship between A and B.\r\n\r\nThe chief novelty in this chapter is an attempt to classify nearness of\r\nrelationship upon a centesimal scale, in which the number of\r\ncorrespondences due to mere chance counts as 0 deg., and complete identity as\r\n100 deg. It seems reasonable to adopt the scale with only slight reservation,\r\nwhen the average numbers of the Arches, Loops, and Whorls are respectively\r\nthe same in the two kinds of digit which are compared together; but when\r\nthey differ greatly, there are no means free from objection, of\r\ndetermining the 100 deg. division of the scale; so the results, if noted at\r\nall, are subject to grave doubt.\r\n\r\nApplying this scale, it appears that digits on opposite hands, which bear\r\nthe same name, are more nearly related together than digits bearing\r\ndifferent names, in about the proportion of three to two. It seems also,\r\nthat of all the digits, none are so nearly related as the middle finger to\r\nthe two adjacent ones.\r\n\r\nIn the ninth chapter, various methods of indexing are discussed and\r\nproposed, by which a set of finger prints may be so described by a few\r\nletters, that it can be easily searched for and found in any large\r\ncollection, just as the name of a person is found in a directory. The\r\nprocedure adopted, is to apply the Arch-Loop-Whorl classification to all\r\nten digits, describing each digit in the order in which it is taken, by\r\nthe letter _a_, _l_, or _w_, as the case may be, and arranging the results\r\nin alphabetical sequence. The downward direction of the slopes of loops on\r\nthe fore-fingers is also taken into account, whether it be towards the\r\nInner or the Outer side, thus replacing L on the fore-finger by either _i_\r\nor _o_.\r\n\r\nMany alternative methods are examined, including both the recognition and\r\nthe non-recognition of all sloped patterns. Also the gain in\r\ndifferentiation, when all the ten digits are catalogued, instead of only a\r\nfew of them. There is so much correlation between the different fingers,\r\nand so much peculiarity in each, that theoretical notions of the value of\r\ndifferent methods of classification are of little worth; it is only by\r\nactual trial that the best can be determined. Whatever plan of index be\r\nadopted, many patterns must fall under some few headings and few or no\r\npatterns under others, the former class resembling in that respect the\r\nSmiths, Browns, and other common names that occur in directories. The\r\ngeneral value of the index much depends on the facility with which these\r\nfrequent forms can be broken up by sub-classification, the rarer forms\r\nbeing easily dealt with. This branch of the subject has, however, been but\r\nlightly touched, under the belief that experience with larger collections\r\nthan my own, was necessary before it could be treated thoroughly; means\r\nare, however, indicated for breaking up the large battalions, which have\r\nanswered well thus far, and seem to admit of considerable extension. Thus,\r\nthe number of ridges in a loop (which is by far the commonest pattern) on\r\nany particular finger, at the part of the impression where the ridges are\r\ncut by the axis of the loop, is a fairly definite and effective datum as\r\nwell as a simple one; so also is the character of its inmost lineation, or\r\ncore.\r\n\r\nIn the tenth chapter we come to a practical result of the inquiry, namely,\r\nits possible use as a means of differentiating a man from his fellows. In\r\ncivil as well as in criminal cases, the need of some such system is shown\r\nto be greatly felt in many of our dependencies; where the features of\r\nnatives are distinguished with difficulty; where there is but little\r\nvariety of surnames; where there are strong motives for prevarication,\r\nespecially connected with land-tenure and pensions, and a proverbial\r\nprevalence of unveracity.\r\n\r\nIt is also shown that the value to honest men of sure means of\r\nidentifying themselves is not so small among civilised nations even in\r\npeace time, as to be disregarded, certainly not in times of war and of\r\nstrict passports. But the value to honest men is always great of being\r\nable to identify offenders, whether they be merely deserters or formerly\r\nconvicted criminals, and the method of finger prints is shown to be\r\napplicable to that purpose. For aid in searching the registers of a\r\ncriminal intelligence bureau, its proper rank is probably a secondary one;\r\nthe primary being some form of the already established Bertillon\r\nanthropometric method. Whatever power the latter gives of successfully\r\nsearching registers, that power would be multiplied many hundredfold by\r\nthe inclusion of finger prints, because their peculiarities are entirely\r\nunconnected with other personal characteristics, as we shall see further\r\non. A brief account is given in this chapter of the Bertillon system, and\r\nan attempt is made on a small scale to verify its performance, by\r\nanalysing five hundred sets of measures made at my own laboratory. These,\r\ncombined with the quoted experiences in attempting to identify deserters\r\nin the United States, allow a high value to this method, though not so\r\nhigh as has been claimed for it, and show the importance of supplementary\r\nmeans. But whenever two suspected duplicates of measurements, bodily\r\nmarks, photographs and finger prints have to be compared, the lineations\r\nof the finger prints would give an incomparably more trustworthy answer to\r\nthe question, whether or no the suspicion of their referring to the same\r\nperson was justified, than all the rest put together. Besides this, while\r\nmeasurements and photographs are serviceable only for adults, and even\r\nthen under restrictions, the finger prints are available throughout life.\r\nIt seems difficult to believe, now that their variety and persistence have\r\nbeen proved, the means of classifying them worked out, and the method of\r\nrapidly obtaining clear finger prints largely practised at my laboratory\r\nand elsewhere, that our criminal administration can long neglect the use\r\nof such a powerful auxiliary. It requires no higher skill and judgment to\r\nmake, register, and hunt out finger prints, than is to be found in\r\nabundance among ordinary clerks. Of course some practice is required\r\nbefore facility can be gained in reading and recognising them, but not a\r\nfew persons of whom I have knowledge, have interested themselves in doing\r\nso, and found no difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe eleventh chapter treats of Heredity, and affirmatively answers the\r\nquestion whether patterns are transmissible by descent. The inquiry proved\r\nmore troublesome than was expected, on account of the great variety in\r\npatterns and the consequent rarity with which the same pattern, other than\r\nthe common Loop, can be expected to appear in relatives. The available\r\ndata having been attacked both by the Arch-Loop-Whorl method, and by a\r\nmuch more elaborate system of classification--described and figured as the\r\nC system, the resemblances between children of either sex, of the same\r\nparents (or more briefly \"fraternal\" resemblances, as they are here\r\ncalled, for want of a better term), have been tabulated and discussed. A\r\nbatch of twins have also been analysed. Then cases have been treated in\r\nwhich both parents had the same pattern on corresponding fingers; this\r\npattern was compared with the pattern on the corresponding finger of the\r\nchild. In these and other ways, results were obtained, all testifying to\r\nthe conspicuous effect of heredity, and giving results that can be\r\nmeasured on the centesimal scale already described. But though the\r\nqualitative results are clear, the quantitative are as yet not well\r\ndefined, and that part of the inquiry must lie over until a future time,\r\nwhen I shall have more data and when certain foreseen improvements in the\r\nmethod of work may perhaps be carried out. There is a decided appearance,\r\nfirst observed by Mr. F. Howard Collins, of whom I shall again have to\r\nspeak, of the influence of the mother being stronger than that of the\r\nfather, in transmitting these patterns.\r\n\r\nIn the twelfth chapter we come to a branch of the subject of which I had\r\ngreat expectations, that have been falsified, namely, their use in\r\nindicating Race and Temperament. I thought that any hereditary\r\npeculiarities would almost of necessity vary in different races, and that\r\nso fundamental and enduring a feature as the finger markings must in some\r\nway be correlated with temperament.\r\n\r\nThe races I have chiefly examined are English, most of whom were of the\r\nupper and middle classes; the others chiefly from London board schools;\r\nWelsh, from the purest Welsh-speaking districts of South Wales; Jews from\r\nthe large London schools, and Negroes from the territories of the Royal\r\nNiger Company. I have also a collection of Basque prints taken at Cambo,\r\nsome twenty miles inland from Biarritz, which, although small, is large\r\nenough to warrant a provisional conclusion. As a first and only an\r\napproximately correct description, the English, Welsh, Jews, Negroes, and\r\nBasques, may all be spoken of as identical in the character of their\r\nfinger prints; the same familiar patterns appearing in all of them with\r\nmuch the same degrees of frequency, the differences between groups of\r\ndifferent races being not larger than those that occasionally occur\r\nbetween groups of the same race. The Jews have, however, a decidedly\r\nlarger proportion of Whorled patterns than other races, and I should have\r\nbeen tempted to make an assertion about a peculiarity in the Negroes, had\r\nnot one of their groups differed greatly from the rest. The task of\r\nexamination has been laborious thus far, but it would be much more so to\r\narrive with correctness at a second and closer approximation to the truth.\r\nIt is doubtful at present whether it is worth while to pursue the subject,\r\nexcept in the case of the Hill tribes of India and a few other peculiarly\r\ndiverse races, for the chance of discovering some characteristic and\r\nperhaps a more monkey-like pattern.\r\n\r\nConsiderable collections of prints of persons belonging to different\r\nclasses have been analysed, such as students in science, and students in\r\narts; farm labourers; men of much culture; and the lowest idiots in the\r\nLondon district (who are all sent to Darenth Asylum), but I do not, still\r\nas a first approximation, find any decided difference between their finger\r\nprints. The ridges of artists are certainly not more delicate and close\r\nthan those of men of quite another stamp.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter XIII. the question is discussed and answered affirmatively, of\r\nthe right of the nine fundamentally differing patterns to be considered as\r\ndifferent genera; also of their more characteristic varieties to rank as\r\ndifferent genera, or species, as the case may be. The chief test applied,\r\nrespected the frequency with which the various Loops that occurred on the\r\nthumbs, were found to differ, in successive degrees of difference, from\r\nthe central form of all of them; it was found to accord with the\r\nrequirements of the well-known law of Frequency of Error, proving the\r\nexistence of a central type, from which the departures were, in common\r\nphraseology, accidental. Now all the evidence in the last chapter concurs\r\nin showing that no sensible amount of correlation exists between any of\r\nthe patterns on the one hand, and any of the bodily faculties or\r\ncharacteristics on the other. It would be absurd therefore to assert that\r\nin the struggle for existence, a person with, say, a loop on his right\r\nmiddle finger has a better chance of survival, or a better chance of early\r\nmarriage, than one with an arch. Consequently genera and species are here\r\nseen to be formed without the slightest aid from either Natural or Sexual\r\nSelection, and these finger patterns are apparently the only peculiarity\r\nin which Panmixia, or the effect of promiscuous marriages, admits of being\r\nstudied on a large scale. The result of Panmixia in finger markings,\r\ncorroborates the arguments I have used in _Natural Inheritance_ and\r\nelsewhere, to show that \"organic stability\" is the primary factor by which\r\nthe distinctions between genera are maintained; consequently, the progress\r\nof evolution is not a smooth and uniform progression, but one that\r\nproceeds by jerks, through successive \"sports\" (as they are called), some\r\nof them implying considerable organic changes, and each in its turn being\r\nfavoured by Natural Selection.\r\n\r\nThe same word \"variation\" has been indiscriminately applied to two very\r\ndifferent conceptions, which ought to be clearly distinguished; the one is\r\nthat of the \"sports\" just alluded to, which are changes in the position of\r\norganic stability, and may, through the aid of Natural Selection, become\r\nfresh steps in the onward course of evolution; the other is that of the\r\nVariations proper, which are merely strained conditions of a stable form\r\nof organisation, and not in any way an overthrow of them. Sports do not\r\nblend freely together; variations proper do so. Natural Selection acts\r\nupon variations proper, just as it does upon sports, by preserving the\r\nbest to become parents, and eliminating the worst, but its action upon\r\nmere variations can, as I conceive, be of no permanent value to evolution,\r\nbecause there is a constant tendency in the offspring to \"regress\" towards\r\nthe parental type. The amount and results of this tendency have been\r\nfully established in _Natural Inheritance_. It is there shown, that after\r\na certain departure from the central typical form has been reached in any\r\nrace, a further departure becomes impossible without the aid of these\r\nsports. In the successive generations of such a population, the average\r\ntendency of filial regression towards the racial centre must at length\r\ncounterbalance the effects of filial dispersion; consequently the best of\r\nthe produce cannot advance beyond the level already attained by the\r\nparents, the rest falling short of it in various degrees.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn concluding these introductory remarks, I have to perform the grateful\r\nduty of acknowledging my indebtedness to Mr. F. Howard Collins, who\r\nmaterially helped me during the past year. He undertook the numerous and\r\ntedious tabulations upon which the chapters on Heredity, and on Races and\r\nClasses, are founded, and he thoroughly revised nearly the whole of my\r\nMS., to the great advantage of the reader of this book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nPREVIOUS USE OF FINGER PRINTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe employment of impressions of the hand or fingers to serve as\r\nsign-manuals will probably be found in every nation of importance, but the\r\nsignificance attached to them differs. It ranges from a mere superstition\r\nthat personal contact is important, up to the conviction of which this\r\nbook will furnish assurance, that when they are properly made, they are\r\nincomparably the most sure and unchanging of all forms of signature. The\r\nexistence of the superstitious basis is easily noted in children and the\r\nuneducated; it occupies a prominent place in the witchcrafts of\r\nbarbarians. The modern witness who swears on the Bible, is made to hold it\r\nand afterwards to kiss it; he who signs a document, touches a seal or\r\nwafer, and declares that \"this is my act and deed.\" Students of the\r\nprimitive customs of mankind find abundant instances of the belief, that\r\npersonal contact communicates some mysterious essence from the thing\r\ntouched to the person who touches it, and _vice versa_; but it is\r\nunnecessary here to enter further into these elementary human reasonings,\r\nwhich are fully described and discussed by various well-known writers.\r\n\r\nThe next grade of significance attached to an impression resembles that\r\nwhich commends itself to the mind of a hunter who is practised in\r\ntracking. He notices whether a footprint he happens to light upon, is\r\nlarger or smaller, broader or narrower, or otherwise differs from the\r\naverage, in any special peculiarity; he thence draws his inferences as to\r\nthe individual who made it. So, when a chief presses his hand smeared with\r\nblood or grime, upon a clean surface, a mark is left in some degree\r\ncharacteristic of him. It may be that of a broad stumpy hand, or of a long\r\nthin one; it may be large or small; it may even show lines corresponding\r\nto the principal creases of the palm. Such hand prints have been made and\r\nrepeated in many semi-civilised nations, and have even been impressed in\r\nvermilion on their State documents, as formerly by the sovereign of Japan.\r\nThough mere smudges, they serve in a slight degree to individualise the\r\nsigner, while they are more or less clothed with the superstitious\r\nattributes of personal contact. So far as I can learn, no higher form of\r\nfinger printing than this has ever existed, in regular and well-understood\r\nuse, in any barbarous or semi-civilised nation. The ridges dealt with in\r\nthis book could not be seen at all in such rude prints, much less could\r\nthey be utilised as strictly distinctive features. It is possible that\r\nwhen impressions of the fingers have been made in wax, and used as seals\r\nto documents, they may sometimes have been subjected to minute scrutiny;\r\nbut no account has yet reached me of trials in any of their courts of law,\r\nabout disputed signatures, in which the identity of the party who was said\r\nto have signed with his finger print, had been established or disproved by\r\ncomparing it with a print made by him then and there. The reader need be\r\ntroubled with only a few examples, taken out of a considerable collection\r\nof extracts from books and letters, in which prints, or rather daubs of\r\nthe above kind, are mentioned.\r\n\r\nA good instance of their small real value may be seen in the _Trans. China\r\nBranch of the Royal Asiatic Society_, Part 1, 1847, published at\r\nHong-Kong, which contains a paper on \"Land Tenure in China,\" by T. Meadows\r\nTaylor, with a deed concerning a sale of land, in facsimile, and its\r\ntranslation: this ends, \"The mother and the son, the sellers, have in the\r\npresence of all the parties, received the price of the land in full,\r\namounting to sixty-four taels and five mace, in perfect dollars weighed in\r\nscales. _Impression of the finger of the mother, of the maiden name of\r\nChin._\" The impression, as it appears in the woodcut, is roundish in\r\noutline, and was therefore made by the tip and not the bulb of the finger.\r\nIts surface is somewhat mottled, but there is no trace of any ridges.\r\n\r\nThe native clerks of Bengal give the name of _tipsahi_ to the mark\r\nimpressed by illiterate persons who, refusing to make either a X or their\r\ncaste-mark, dip their finger into the ink-pot and touch the document. The\r\ntipsahi is not supposed to individualise the signer, it is merely a\r\npersonal ceremony performed in the presence of witnesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 1.\r\n\r\nFIG. 1. Chinese Coin, Tang Dynasty, about 618 A.D., with nail mark of the\r\nEmpress Wen-teh, figured in relief.\r\n\r\nFIG. 2. Order on a Camp Sutler, by the officer of a surveying party in New\r\nMexico. 1882.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMany impressions of fingers are found on ancient pottery, as on Roman\r\ntiles; indeed the Latin word _palmatus_ is said to mean an impression in\r\nsoft clay, such as a mark upon a wall, stamped by a blow with the palm.\r\nNail-marks are used ornamentally by potters of various nations. They exist\r\non Assyrian bricks as signatures; for instance, in the Assyrian room of\r\nthe British Museum, on the west side of the case C 43, one of these bricks\r\ncontains a notice of sale and is prefaced by words that were translated\r\nfor me thus: \"Nail-mark of Nabu-sum-usur, the seller of the field, (used)\r\nlike his seal.\" A somewhat amusing incident affected the design of the\r\nChinese money during the great Tang dynasty, about 618 A.D. A new and\r\nimportant issue of coinage was to be introduced, and the Secretary of the\r\nCensors himself moulded the design in wax, and humbly submitted it to the\r\nEmpress Wen-teh for approval. She, through maladroitness, dug the end of\r\nher enormously long finger-nail into its face, marking it deeply as with a\r\ncarpenter's gouge. The poor Secretary of the Censors, Ngeu-yang-siun, who\r\ndeserves honour from professional courtiers, suppressing such sentiments\r\nas he must have felt when his work was mauled, accepted the nail-mark of\r\nthe Empress as an interesting supplement to the design; he changed it into\r\na crescent in relief, and the new coins were stamped accordingly. (See\r\n_Coins and Medals_, edited by Stanley Lane Poole, 1885, p. 221.) A\r\ndrawing of one of these is given in Plate 1, Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nThe European practitioners of palmistry and cheiromancy do not seem to\r\nhave paid particular attention to the ridges with which we are concerned.\r\nA correspondent of the American Journal _Science_, viii. 166, states,\r\nhowever, that the Chinese class the striae at the ends of the fingers into\r\n\"pots\" when arranged in a coil, and into \"hooks.\" They are also regarded\r\nby the cheiromantists in Japan. A curious account has reached me of\r\nnegroes in the United States who, laying great stress on the possession of\r\nfinger prints in wax or dough for witchcraft purposes, are also said to\r\nexamine their striae.\r\n\r\nLeaving Purkenje to be spoken of in a later chapter, because he deals\r\nchiefly with classification, the first well-known person who appears to\r\nhave studied the lineations of the ridges as a means of identification,\r\nwas Bewick, who made an impression of his own thumb on a block of wood and\r\nengraved it, as well as an impression of a finger. They were used as\r\nfanciful designs for his illustrated books. Occasional instances of\r\ncareful study may also be noted, such as that of Mr. Fauld (_Nature_,\r\nxxii. p. 605, Oct. 28, 1880), who seems to have taken much pains, and that\r\nof Mr. Tabor, the eminent photographer of San Francisco, who, noticing the\r\nlineations of a print that he had accidentally made with his own inked\r\nfinger upon a blotting-paper, experimented further, and finally proposed\r\nthe method of finger prints for the registration of Chinese, whose\r\nidentification has always been a difficulty, and was giving a great deal\r\nof trouble at that particular time; but his proposal dropped through.\r\nAgain Mr. Gilbert Thompson, an American geologist, when on Government duty\r\nin 1882 in the wild parts of New Mexico, paid the members of his party by\r\norder of the camp sutler. To guard against forgery he signed his name\r\nacross the impression made by his finger upon the order, after first\r\npressing it on his office pad. He was good enough to send me the duplicate\r\nof one of these cheques made out in favour of a man who bore the ominous\r\nname of \"Lying Bob\" (Plate 1, Fig. 2). The impression took the place of\r\nthe scroll work on an ordinary cheque; it was in violet aniline ink, and\r\nlooked decidedly pretty. From time to time sporadic instances like these\r\nare met with, but none are comparable in importance to the regular and\r\nofficial employment made of finger prints by Sir William Herschel, during\r\nmore than a quarter of a century in Bengal. I was exceedingly obliged to\r\nhim for much valuable information when first commencing this study, and\r\nhave been almost wholly indebted to his kindness for the materials used in\r\nthis book for proving the persistence of the lineations throughout life.\r\n\r\nSir William Herschel has presented me with one of the two original\r\n\"Contracts\" in Bengali, dated 1858, which suggested to his mind the idea\r\nof using this method of identification. It was so difficult to obtain\r\ncredence to the signatures of the natives, that he thought he would use\r\nthe signature of the hand itself, chiefly with the intention of\r\nfrightening the man who made it from afterwards denying his formal act;\r\nhowever, the impression proved so good that Sir W. Herschel became\r\nconvinced that the same method might be further utilised. He finally\r\nintroduced the use of finger prints in several departments at Hooghly in\r\n1877, after seventeen years' experience of the value of the evidence they\r\nafforded. A too brief account of his work was given by him in _Nature_,\r\nxxiii. p. 23 (Nov. 25, 1880). He mentions there that he had been taking\r\nfinger marks as sign-manuals for more than twenty years, and had\r\nintroduced them for practical purposes in several ways in India with\r\nmarked benefit. They rendered attempts to repudiate signatures quite\r\nhopeless. Finger prints were taken of Pensioners to prevent their\r\npersonation by others after their death; they were used in the office for\r\nRegistration of Deeds, and at a gaol where each prisoner had to sign with\r\nhis finger. By comparing the prints of persons then living, with their\r\nprints taken twenty years previously, he considered he had proved that the\r\nlapse of at least that period made no change sufficient to affect the\r\nutility of the plan. He informs me that he submitted, in 1877, a report in\r\nsemi-official form to the Inspector-General of Gaols, asking to be allowed\r\nto extend the process; but no result followed. In 1881, at the request of\r\nthe Governor of the gaol at Greenwich (Sydney), he sent a description of\r\nthe method, but no further steps appear to have been taken there.\r\n\r\nIf the use of finger prints ever becomes of general importance, Sir\r\nWilliam Herschel must be regarded as the first who devised a feasible\r\nmethod for regular use, and afterwards officially adopted it. His method\r\nof printing for those purposes will be found in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF PRINTING\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be the aim of this chapter to show how to make really good and\r\npermanent impressions of the fingers. It is very easy to do so when the\r\nprinciples of the art are understood and practised, but difficult\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nOne example of the ease of making good, but not permanent impressions, is\r\nfound, and should be tried, by pressing the bulb of a finger against\r\nwell-polished glass, or against the highly-polished blade of a razor. The\r\nfinger must be _very slightly_ oiled, as by passing it through the hair;\r\nif it be moist, dry it with a handkerchief before the oiling. Then press\r\nthe bulb of the finger on the glass or razor, as the case may be, and a\r\nbeautiful impression will be left. The hardness of the glass or steel\r\nprevents its surface from rising into the furrows under the pressure of\r\nthe ridges, while the layer of oil which covers the bottom of the furrows\r\nis too thin to reach down to the glass or steel; consequently the ridges\r\nalone are printed. There is no capillary or other action to spread the\r\noil, so the impression remains distinct. A merely moist and not oily\r\nfinger leaves a similar mark, but it soon evaporates.\r\n\r\nThis simple method is often convenient for quickly noting the character of\r\na finger pattern. The impression may be made on a window-pane, a\r\nwatch-glass, or even an eye-glass, if nothing better is at hand. The\r\nimpression is not seen to its fullest advantage except by means of a\r\nsingle small source of bright light. The glass or steel has to be so\r\ninclined as just _not_ to reflect the light into the eye. That part of the\r\nlight which falls on the oily impression is not so sharply reflected from\r\nit as from the surface of the glass or steel. Consequently some stray\r\nbeams of the light which is scattered from the oil, reach the eye, while\r\nall of the light reflected from the highly-polished glass or steel passes\r\nin another direction and is unseen. The result is a brilliantly luminous\r\nimpression on a dark background. The impression ceases to be visible when\r\nthe glass or steel is not well polished, and itself scatters the light,\r\nlike the oil.\r\n\r\nThere are two diametrically opposed methods of printing, each being the\r\ncomplement of the other. The method used in ordinary printing, is to ink\r\nthe projecting surfaces only, leaving the depressed parts clean. The other\r\nmethod, used in printing from engraved plates, is to ink the whole\r\nsurface, and then to clean the ink from the projecting parts, leaving the\r\ndepressions only filled with it. Either of these two courses can be\r\nadopted in taking finger prints, but not the two together, for when they\r\nare combined in equal degrees the result must be a plain black blot.\r\n\r\nThe following explanations will be almost entirely confined to the first\r\nmethod, namely, that of ordinary printing, as the second method has so far\r\nnot given equally good results.\r\n\r\nThe ink used may be either printer's ink or water colour, but for\r\nproducing the best work, rapidly and on a large scale, the method of\r\nprinter's ink seems in every respect preferable. However, water colour\r\nsuffices for some purposes, and as there is so much convenience in a pad,\r\ndrenched with dye, such as is commonly used for hand stamps, and which is\r\nalways ready for use, many may prefer it. The processes with printer's ink\r\nwill be described first.\r\n\r\nThe relief formed by the ridges is low. In the fingers of very young\r\nchildren, and of some ladies whose hands are rarely submitted to rough\r\nusage, the ridges are exceptionally faint; their crests hardly rise above\r\nthe furrows, yet it is the crests only that are to be inked. Consequently\r\nthe layer of ink on the slab or pad on which the finger is pressed for the\r\npurpose of blackening it, must be _very thin_. Its thickness must be less\r\nthan half the elevation of the ridges, for when the finger is pressed\r\ndown, the crests displace the ink immediately below them, and drives it\r\nupwards into the furrows which would otherwise be choked with it.\r\n\r\nIt is no violent misuse of metaphor to compare the ridges to the crests of\r\nmountain ranges, and the depth of the blackening that they ought to\r\nreceive, to that of the newly-fallen snow upon the mountaintops in the\r\nearly autumn, when it powders them from above downwards to a\r\nsharply-defined level. The most desirable blackening of the fingers\r\ncorresponds to a snowfall which covers all the higher passes, but descends\r\nno lower.\r\n\r\nWith a finger so inked it is scarcely possible to fail in making a good\r\nimprint; the heaviest pressure cannot spoil it. The first desideratum is,\r\nthen, to cover the slab by means of which the finger is to be blackened,\r\nwith an extremely thin layer of ink.\r\n\r\nThis cannot be accomplished with printer's ink unless the slab is very\r\nclean, the ink somewhat fluid, and the roller that is used to spread it,\r\nin good condition. When a plate of glass is used for the slab, it is easy,\r\nby holding the inked slab between the eye and the light, to judge of the\r\ncorrect amount of inking. It should appear by no means black, but of a\r\nsomewhat light brown.\r\n\r\nThe thickness of ink transferred by the finger to the paper is much less\r\nthan that which lay upon the slab. The ink adheres to the slab as well as\r\nto the finger; when they are separated, only a portion of the ink is\r\nremoved by the finger. Again, when the inked finger is pressed on the\r\npaper, only a portion of the ink that was on the finger is transferred to\r\nthe paper. Owing to this double reduction, it seldom happens that a clear\r\nimpression is at the same time black. An ideally perfect material for\r\nblackening would lie loosely on the slab like dust, it would cling very\r\nlightly to the finger, but adhere firmly to the paper.\r\n\r\nThe last preliminary to be noticed is the slowness with which the\r\nprinter's ink hardens on the slab, and the rapidity with which it dries on\r\npaper. While serviceable for hours in the former case, in the latter it\r\nwill be dry in a very few seconds. The drying or hardening of this oily\r\nink has nothing whatever to do with the loss of moisture in the ordinary\r\nsense of the word, that is to say, of the loss of the contained water: it\r\nis wholly due to oxidisation of the oil. An extremely thin oxidised film\r\nsoon forms on the surface of the layer on the slab, and this shields the\r\nlower-lying portions of the layer from the air, and retards further\r\noxidisation. But paper is very unlike a polished slab; it is a fine felt,\r\nfull of minute interstices. When a printed period (.) is placed under the\r\nmicroscope it looks like a drop of tar in the middle of a clean\r\nbird's-nest. The ink is minutely divided among the interstices of the\r\npaper, and a large surface being thereby exposed to the air, it oxidises\r\nat once, while a print from the finger upon glass will not dry for two or\r\nthree days. One effect of oxidisation is to give a granulated appearance\r\nto the ink on rollers which have been allowed to get dirty. This\r\ngranulation leaves clots on the slab which are fatal to good work:\r\nwhenever they are seen, the roller must be cleaned at once.\r\n\r\nThe best ink for finger printing is not the best for ordinary printing. It\r\nis important to a commercial printer that his ink should dry rapidly on\r\nthe paper, and he does not want a particularly thin layer of it;\r\nconsequently, he prefers ink that contains various drying materials, such\r\nas litharge, which easily part with their oxygen. In finger prints this\r\nrapid drying is unnecessary, and the drying materials do harm by making\r\nthe ink too stiff. The most serviceable ink for our purpose is made of any\r\npure \"drying\" oil (or oil that oxidises rapidly), mixed with lampblack and\r\nvery little else. I get mine in small collapsible tubes, each holding\r\nabout a quarter of an ounce, from Messrs. Reeve & Sons, 113 Cheapside,\r\nLondon, W.C. Some thousands of fingers may be printed from the contents of\r\none of these little tubes.\r\n\r\nLet us now pass on to descriptions of printing apparatus. First, of that\r\nin regular use at my anthropometric laboratory at South Kensington, which\r\nhas acted perfectly for three years; then of a similar but small apparatus\r\nconvenient to carry about or send abroad, and of temporary arrangements in\r\ncase any part of it may fail. Then lithographic printing will be noticed.\r\nIn all these cases some kind of printer's ink has to be used. Next, smoke\r\nprints will be described, which at times are very serviceable; after this\r\nthe methods of water colours and aniline dyes; then casts of various\r\nkinds; last of all, enlargements.\r\n\r\n_Laboratory apparatus._--Mine consists of: 1, slab; 2, roller; 3, bottle\r\nof benzole (paraffin, turpentine, or solution of washing soda); 4, a\r\nfunnel, with blotting-paper to act as a filter; 5, printer's ink; 6, rags\r\nand duster; 7, a small glass dish; 8, cards to print on.\r\n\r\nThe _Slab_ is a sheet of polished copper, 10-1/2 inches by 7, and about\r\n1/16 inch thick, mounted on a solid board 3/4 inch thick, with projecting\r\nears for ease of handling. The whole weighs 2-1/2 lbs. Each day it is\r\ncleaned with the benzole and left bright. [A slab of more than double the\r\nlength and less than half the width might, as my assistant thinks, answer\r\nbetter.]\r\n\r\nThe _Roller_ is an ordinary small-sized printer's roller, 6 inches long\r\nand 3 in diameter, obtained from Messrs. Harrild, 25 Farringdon Street,\r\nLondon. Mine remained in good condition for quite a year and a half. When\r\nit is worn the maker exchanges it for a new one at a trifling cost. A good\r\nroller is of the highest importance; it affords the only means of\r\nspreading ink evenly and thinly, and with quickness and precision, over a\r\nlarge surface. The ingenuity of printers during more than four centuries\r\nin all civilised nations, has been directed to invent the most suitable\r\ncomposition for rollers, with the result that particular mixtures of glue,\r\ntreacle, etc., are now in general use, the proportions between the\r\ningredients differing according to the temperature at which the roller is\r\nintended to be used. The roller, like the slab, is cleansed with benzole\r\nevery day (a very rapid process) and then put out of the reach of dust.\r\nIts clean surface is smooth and shining.\r\n\r\nThe _Benzole_ is kept in a pint bottle. Sometimes paraffin or turpentine\r\nhas been used instead; washing soda does not smell, but it dissolves the\r\nink more slowly. They are otherwise nearly equally effective in cleansing\r\nthe rollers and fingers. When dirty, the benzole can be rudely filtered\r\nand used again.\r\n\r\nThe _Funnel_ holds blotting-paper for filtering the benzole. Where much\r\nprinting is going on, and consequent washing of hands, it is worth while\r\nto use a filter, as it saves a little daily expense, though benzole is\r\nvery cheap, and a few drops of it will clean a large surface.\r\n\r\nThe _Ink_ has already been spoken of. The more fluid it is the better, so\r\nlong as it does not \"run.\" A thick ink cannot be so thinned by adding\r\nturpentine, etc., as to make it equal to ink that was originally fluid.\r\nThe variety of oils used in making ink, and of the added materials, is\r\nendless. For our purpose, any oil that dries and does not spread, such as\r\nboiled or burnt linseed oil, mixed with lampblack, is almost all that is\r\nwanted. The burnt oil is the thicker of the two, and dries the faster.\r\nUnfortunately the two terms, burnt and boiled linseed oil, have no\r\ndefinite meaning in the trade, boiling or burning not being the simple\r\nprocesses these words express, but including an admixture of drying\r\nmaterials, which differ with each manufacturer; moreover, there are two,\r\nif not three, fundamentally distinct qualities of linseed, in respect to\r\nthe oil extracted from it. The ink used in the laboratory and described\r\nabove, answers all requirements. Many other inks have suited less well;\r\nless even than that which can be made, in a very homely way, with a little\r\nsoot off a plate that had been smoked over a candle, mixed with such\r\nboiled linseed oil as can be bought at unpretentious oil and colour shops,\r\nits only fault being a tendency to run.\r\n\r\n_Rags_, and a comparatively clean duster, are wanted for cleaning the slab\r\nand roller, without scratching them.\r\n\r\nThe small _Glass Dish_ holds the benzole, into which the inked fingers are\r\ndipped before wiping them with the duster. Soap and water complete the\r\npreliminary cleansing.\r\n\r\n_Cards_, lying flat, and being more easily manipulated than paper, are now\r\nused at the laboratory for receiving the impressions. They are of rather\r\nlarge size, 11-1/2 x 5 inches, to enable the prints of the ten digits to\r\nbe taken on the same card in two rather different ways (see Plate 2, Fig.\r\n3), and to afford space for writing notes. The cards must have a smooth\r\nand yet slightly absorbent surface. If too highly glazed they cease to\r\nabsorb, and more ink will remain on the fingers and less be transferred\r\nfrom them to the paper. A little trial soon determines the best specimen\r\nfrom among a few likely alternatives. \"Correspondence cards\" are suitable\r\nfor taking prints of not more than three fingers, and are occasionally\r\nemployed in the laboratory. Paper books and pads were tried, but their\r\nsurfaces are inferior to cards in flatness, and their use is now\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nThe cards should be _very_ white, because, if a photographic enlargement\r\nshould at any time be desired, a slight tint on the card will be an\r\nimpediment to making a photograph that shall be as sharp in its lines as\r\nan engraving, it being recollected that the cleanest prints are brown, and\r\ntherefore not many shades darker than the tints of ordinary cards.\r\n\r\nThe method of printing at the laboratory is to squeeze a drop or so of ink\r\non to the slab, and to work it thoroughly with the roller until a thin and\r\neven layer is spread, just as is done by printers, from one of whom a\r\nbeginner might well purchase a lesson. The thickness of the layer of ink\r\nis tested from time to time by taking a print of a finger, and comparing\r\nits clearness and blackness with that of a standard print, hung up for the\r\npurpose close at hand. If too much ink has been put on the slab, some of\r\nit must be cleaned off, and the slab rolled afresh with what remains on it\r\nand on the roller. But this fault should seldom be committed; little ink\r\nshould be put on at first, and more added little by little, until the\r\nrequired result is attained.\r\n\r\nThe right hand of the subject, which should be quite passive, is taken by\r\nthe operator, and the bulbs of his four fingers laid flat on the inked\r\nslab and pressed gently but firmly on it by the flattened hand of the\r\noperator. Then the inked fingers are laid flat upon the upper part of the\r\nright-hand side of the card (Plate 2, Fig. 3), and pressed down gently and\r\nfirmly, just as before, by the flattened hand of the operator. This\r\ncompletes the process for one set of prints of the four fingers of the\r\nright hand. Then the bulb of the thumb is slightly _rolled_ on the inked\r\nslab, and again on the lower part of the card, which gives a more extended\r\nbut not quite so sharp an impression. Each of the four fingers of the same\r\nhand, in succession, is similarly rolled and impressed. This completes the\r\nprocess for the second set of prints of the digits of the right hand. Then\r\nthe left hand is treated in the same way.\r\n\r\nThe result is indicated by the diagram, which shows on what parts of the\r\ncard the impressions fall. Thus each of the four fingers is impressed\r\ntwice, once above with a simple dab, and once below with a rolled\r\nimpression, but each thumb is only impressed once; the thumbs being more\r\ntroublesome to print from than fingers. Besides, the cards would have to\r\nbe made even larger than they are, if two impressions of each thumb had to\r\nbe included. It takes from two and a half to three minutes to obtain the\r\neighteen impressions that are made on each card.\r\n\r\nThe _pocket apparatus_ is similar to one originally made and used by Sir\r\nWilliam J. Herschel (see Plate 3, Fig. 4, in which the roller and its\r\nbearings are drawn of the same size as those I use). A small cylinder of\r\nhard wood, or of brass tube, say 1-3/4 inch long, and 1/2 or 3/4 inch in\r\ndiameter, has a pin firmly driven into each end to serve as an axle. A\r\npiece of tightly-fitting india-rubber tubing is drawn over the cylinder.\r\nThe cylinder, thus coated with a soft smooth compressible material, turns\r\non its axle in two brackets, each secured by screws, as shown in Plate 2,\r\nFig. 4, to a board (say 6 x 2-1/2 x 1/4 inch) that serves as handle. This\r\nmakes a very fair and durable roller; it can be used in the heat and damp\r\nof the tropics, and is none the worse for a wetting, but it is by no means\r\nso good for delicate work as a cylinder covered with roller composition.\r\nThese are not at all difficult to make; I have cast them for myself. The\r\nmould is a piece of brass tube, polished inside. A thick disc, with a\r\ncentral hole for the lower pin of the cylinder, fits smoothly into the\r\nlower end of the mould, and a ring with a thin bar across it, fits over\r\nthe other end, the upper pin of the cylinder entering a hole in the middle\r\nof the bar; thus the cylinder is firmly held in the right position. After\r\nslightly oiling the inside of the mould, warming it, inserting the disc\r\nand cylinder, and fitting on the ring, the melted composition is poured in\r\non either side of the bar. As it contracts on cooling, rather more must be\r\npoured in than at first appears necessary. Finally the roller is pushed\r\nout of the mould by a wooden ramrod, applied to the bottom of the disc.\r\nThe composition must be melted like glue, in a vessel surrounded by hot\r\nwater, which should never be allowed to boil; otherwise it will be spoilt.\r\nHarrild's best composition is more than twice the cost of that ordinarily\r\nused, and is expensive for large rollers, but for these miniature ones the\r\ncost is unimportant. The mould with which my first roller was made, was an\r\nold pewter squirt with the nozzle cut off; its piston served the double\r\npurpose of disc and ramrod.\r\n\r\nThe _Slab_ is a piece of thick plate glass, of the same length and width\r\nas the handle to the roller, so they pack up easily together; its edges\r\nare ground to save the fingers and roller alike from being cut. (Porcelain\r\ntakes the ink better than glass, but is not to be commonly found in the\r\nshops, of a convenient shape and size; a glazed tile makes a capital\r\nslab.) A collapsible tube of printer's ink, a few rags, and a phial of\r\nwashing soda, complete the equipment (benzole may spoil india-rubber).\r\nWhen using the apparatus, spread a newspaper on the table to prevent\r\naccident, have other pieces of newspaper ready to clean the roller, and to\r\nremove any surplus of ink from it by the simple process of rolling it on\r\nthe paper. Take care that the washing soda is in such a position that it\r\ncannot be upset and ruin the polish of the table. With these precautions,\r\nthe apparatus may be used with cleanliness even in a drawing-room. The\r\nroller is of course laid on its back when not in use.\r\n\r\nMy assistant has taken good prints of the three first fingers of the right\r\nhands of more than 300 school children, say 1000 fingers, in a few hours\r\nduring the same day, by this apparatus. Hawksley, 357 Oxford Street, W.,\r\nsells a neatly fitted-up box with all the necessary apparatus.\r\n\r\n_Rougher arrangements._--A small ball made by tying chamois leather round\r\nsoft rags, may be used in the absence of a roller. The fingers are inked\r\nfrom the ball, over which the ink has been evenly distributed, by dabbing\r\nit many times against a slab or plate. This method gives good results, but\r\nis slow; it would be intolerably tedious to employ it on a large scale, on\r\nall ten digits of many persons.\r\n\r\nIt is often desirable to obtain finger prints from persons at a distance,\r\nwho could not be expected to trouble themselves to acquire the art of\r\nprinting for the purpose of making a single finger print. On these\r\noccasions I send folding-cases to them, each consisting of two pieces of\r\nthin copper sheeting, fastened side by side to a slip of pasteboard, by\r\nbending the edges of the copper over it. The pasteboard is half cut\r\nthrough at the back, along the space between the copper sheets, so that\r\nit can be folded like a reply post-card, the copper sheets being thus\r\nbrought face to face, but prevented from touching by the margin of an\r\ninterposed card, out of which the middle has been cut away. The two pieces\r\nof copper being inked and folded up, may then be sent by post. On arrival\r\nthe ink is fresh, and the folders can be used as ordinary inked slabs.\r\n(See also Smoke Printing, page 47.)\r\n\r\nThe fluidity of even a very thin layer of ink seems to be retained for an\r\nindefinite time if the air is excluded to prevent oxidisation. I made\r\nexperiments, and found that if pieces of glass (photographic quarter\r\nplates) be inked, and placed face to face, separated only by narrow paper\r\nmargins, and then wrapped up without other precaution, they will remain\r\ngood for a year and a half.\r\n\r\nA slight film of oxidisation on the surface of the ink is a merit, not a\r\nharm; it is cleaner to work with and gives a blacker print, because the\r\nink clings less tenaciously to the finger, consequently more of it is\r\ntransferred to the paper.\r\n\r\nIf a blackened plate becomes dry, and is re-inked without first being\r\ncleaned, the new ink will rob the old of some of its oxygen and it will\r\nbecome dry in a day or even less.\r\n\r\n_Lithography._--Prints may be made on \"transfer-paper,\" and thence\r\ntransferred to stone. It is better not to impress the fingers directly\r\nupon the stone, as the print from the stone would be reversed as compared\r\nwith the original impression, and mistakes are likely to arise in\r\nconsequence. The print is re-reversed, or put right, by impressing the\r\nfingers on transfer-paper. It might sometimes be desirable to obtain\r\nrapidly a large number of impressions of the finger prints of a suspected\r\nperson. In this case lithography would be easier, quicker, and cheaper\r\nthan photography.\r\n\r\n_Water Colours and Dyes._--The pads most commonly used with office stamps\r\nare made of variously prepared gelatine, covered with fine silk to protect\r\nthe surface, and saturated with an aniline dye. If the surface be touched,\r\nthe finger is inked, and if the circumstances are all favourable, a good\r\nprint may be made, but there is much liability to blot. The pad remains\r\nready for use during many days without any attention, fresh ink being\r\nadded at long intervals. The advantage of a dye over an ordinary water\r\ncolour is, that it percolates the silk without any of its colour being\r\nkept back; while a solution of lampblack or Indian ink, consisting of\r\nparticles of soot suspended in water, leaves all its black particles\r\nbehind when it is carefully filtered; only clear water then passes\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nA serviceable pad may be made out of a few thicknesses of cloth or felt\r\nwith fine silk or cambric stretched over it. The ink should be of a slowly\r\ndrying sort, made, possibly, of ordinary ink, with the admixture of brown\r\nsugar, honey, glycerine or the like, to bring it to a proper consistence.\r\n\r\nMr. Gilbert Thompson's results by this process have already been\r\nmentioned. A similar process was employed for the Bengal finger prints by\r\nSir W. Herschel, who sent me the following account: \"As to the printing\r\nof the fingers themselves, no doubt practice makes perfect. But I took no\r\npains with my native officials, some dozen or so of whom learnt to do it\r\nquite well enough for all practical purposes from Bengali written\r\ninstructions, and using nothing but a kind of lampblack ink made by the\r\nnative orderly for use with the office seal.\" A batch of these\r\nimpressions, which he was so good as to send me, are all clear, and in\r\nmost cases very good indeed. It would be easier to employ this method in a\r\nvery damp climate than in England, where a very thin layer of lampblack is\r\napt to dry too quickly on the fingers.\r\n\r\n_Printing as from Engraved Plates._--Professor Ray Lankester kindly sent\r\nme his method of taking prints with water colours. \"You take a watery\r\nbrushful or two of the paint and rub it over the hands, rubbing one hand\r\nagainst the other until they feel sticky. A _thin_ paper (tissue is best)\r\nplaced on an oval cushion the shape of the hand, should be ready, and the\r\nhand pressed not too firmly on to it. I enclose a rough sample, done\r\nwithout a cushion. You require a cushion for the hollow of the hand, and\r\nthe paint must be rubbed by the two hands until they feel sticky, not\r\nwatery.\" This is the process of printing from engravings, the ink being\r\nremoved from the ridges, and lying in the furrows. Blood can be used in\r\nthe same way.\r\n\r\nThe following is extracted from an article by Dr. Louis Robinson in the\r\n_Nineteenth Century_, May 1892, p. 303:--\r\n\r\n    \"I found that direct prints of the infant's feet on paper would answer\r\n    much better [than photography]. After trying various methods I found\r\n    that the best results could be got by covering the foot by means of a\r\n    soft stencil brush with a composition of lampblack, soap, syrup, and\r\n    blue-black ink; wiping it gently from heel to toe with a\r\n    smoothly-folded silk handkerchief to remove the superfluous pigment,\r\n    and then applying a moderately flexible paper, supported on a soft\r\n    pad, direct to the foot.\"\r\n\r\nA curious method with paper and ordinary writing ink, lately contrived by\r\nDr. Forgeot, is analogous to lithography. He has described in one of the\r\nmany interesting pamphlets published by the \"Laboratoire d'Anthropologie\r\nCriminelle\" of Lyon (_Stenheil_, 2 Rue Casimir-Delavigne, Paris), his new\r\nprocess of rendering visible the previously invisible details of such\r\nfaint finger prints as thieves may have left on anything they have\r\nhandled, the object being to show how evidence may sometimes be obtained\r\nfor their identification. It is well known that pressure of the hand on\r\nthe polished surface of glass or metal leaves a latent image very\r\ndifficult to destroy, and which may be rendered visible by suitable\r\napplications, but few probably have suspected that this may be the case,\r\nto a considerable degree, with ordinary paper. Dr. Forgeot has shown that\r\nif a slightly greasy hand, such for example as a hand that has just been\r\npassed through the hair, be pressed on clean paper, and if common ink be\r\nafterwards brushed lightly over the paper, it will refuse to lie thickly\r\non the greasy parts, and that the result will be a very fair picture of\r\nthe minute markings on the fingers. He has even used these productions as\r\nnegatives, and printed good photographs from them. He has also sent me a\r\nphotographic print made from a piece of glass which had been exposed to\r\nthe vapour of hydrofluoric acid, after having been touched by a greasy\r\nhand. I have made many trials of his method with considerable success. It\r\naffords a way of obtaining serviceable impressions in the absence of\r\nbetter means. Dr. Forgeot's pamphlet describes other methods of a\r\ngenerally similar kind, which he has found to be less good than the above.\r\n\r\n_Smoke Printing._--When other apparatus is not at hand, a method of\r\nobtaining very clear impressions is to smoke a plate over a lighted\r\ncandle, to press the finger on the blackened surface, and then on an\r\nadhesive one. The following details must, however, be borne in mind: the\r\nplate must not be smoked too much, for the same reason that a slab must\r\nnot be inked too much; and the adhesive surface must be only slightly\r\ndamped, not wetted, or the impression will be blurred. A crockery plate is\r\nbetter than glass or metal, as the soot does not adhere to it so tightly,\r\nand it is less liable to crack. Professor Bowditch finds mica (which is\r\nsold at photographic stores in small sheets) to be the best material.\r\nCertainly the smoke comes wholly off the mica on to the parts of the\r\nfinger that touch it, and a beautiful negative is left behind, which can\r\nbe utilised in the camera better than glass that has been similarly\r\ntreated; but it does not serve so well for a plate that is intended to be\r\nkept ready for use in a pocket-book, its softness rendering it too liable\r\nto be scratched. I prefer to keep a slip of very thin copper sheeting in\r\nmy pocket-book, with which, and with the gummed back of a postage stamp,\r\nor even the gummed fringe to a sheet of stamps, impressions can easily be\r\ntaken. The thin copper quickly cools, and a wax match supplies enough\r\nsmoke. The folders spoken of (p. 42) may be smoked instead of being inked,\r\nand are in some cases preferable to carry in the pocket or to send by\r\npost, being so easy to smoke afresh. Luggage labels that are thickly\r\ngummed at the back furnish a good adhesive surface. The fault of gummed\r\npaper lies in the difficulty of damping it without its curling up. The\r\ngummed paper sold by stationers is usually thinner than luggage labels,\r\nand still more difficult to keep flat. Paste rubbed in a very thin layer\r\nover a card makes a surface that holds soot firmly, and one that will not\r\nstick to other surfaces if accidentally moistened. Glue, isinglass, size,\r\nand mucilage, are all suitable. It was my fortune as a boy to receive\r\nrudimentary lessons in drawing from a humble and rather grotesque master.\r\nHe confided to me the discovery, which he claimed as his own, that pencil\r\ndrawings could be fixed by licking them; and as I write these words, the\r\nimage of his broad swab-like tongue performing the operation, and of his\r\nproud eyes gleaming over the drawing he was operating on, come vividly to\r\nremembrance. This reminiscence led me to try whether licking a piece of\r\npaper would give it a sufficiently adhesive surface. It did so. Nay, it\r\nled me a step further, for I took two pieces of paper and licked both.\r\nThe dry side of the one was held over the candle as an equivalent to a\r\nplate for collecting soot, being saved by the moisture at the back from\r\nigniting (it had to be licked two or three times during the process), and\r\nthe impression was made on the other bit of paper. An ingenious person\r\ndetermined to succeed in obtaining the record of a finger impression, can\r\nhardly fail altogether under any ordinary circumstances.\r\n\r\nPhysiologists who are familiar with the revolving cylinder covered with\r\nhighly-glazed paper, which is smoked, and then used for the purpose of\r\nrecording the delicate movements of a tracer, will have noticed the beauty\r\nof the impression sometimes left by a finger that had accidentally touched\r\nit. They are also well versed in the art of varnishing such impressions to\r\npreserve them in a durable form.\r\n\r\nA cake of blacklead (plumbago), such as is sold for blackening grates,\r\nwhen rubbed on paper leaves a powdery surface that readily blackens the\r\nfingers, and shows the ridges distinctly. A small part of the black comes\r\noff when the fingers are pressed on sticky paper, but I find it difficult\r\nto ensure good prints. The cakes are convenient to carry and cleanly to\r\nhandle. Whitening, and still more, whitening mixed with size, may be used\r\nin the same way, but it gathers in the furrows, not on the ridges.\r\n\r\n_Casts_ give undoubtedly the most exact representation of the ridges, but\r\nthey are difficult and unsatisfactory to examine, puzzling the eye by\r\nshowing too conspicuously the variation of their heights, whereas we only\r\nwant to know their courses. Again, as casts must be of a uniform colour,\r\nthe finer lines are indistinctly seen except in a particular light.\r\nLastly, they are both cumbrous to preserve and easily broken.\r\n\r\nA sealing-wax impression is the simplest and best kind of cast, and the\r\nfinger need not be burnt in making it. The plan is to make a considerable\r\npool of flaming sealing-wax, stirring it well with the still unmelted\r\npiece of the stick, while it is burning. Then blow out the flame and wait\r\na little, until the upper layer has cooled. Sealing-wax that has been well\r\naflame takes a long time to harden thoroughly after it has parted with\r\nnearly all its heat. By selecting the proper moment after blowing out the\r\nflame, the wax will be cool enough for the finger to press it without\r\ndiscomfort, and it will still be sufficiently soft to take a sharp\r\nimpression. Dentist's wax, which is far less brittle, is easily worked,\r\nand takes impressions that are nearly as sharp as those of sealing-wax; it\r\nhas to be well heated and kneaded, then plunged for a moment in cold water\r\nto chill the surface, and immediately impressed. Gutta-percha can also be\r\nused. The most delicate of all impressions is that left upon a thick clot\r\nof varnish, which has been exposed to the air long enough for a thin film\r\nto have formed over it. The impression is transient, but lingers\r\nsufficiently to be easily photographed. It happened, oddly enough, that a\r\nfew days after I had noticed this effect, and had been experimenting upon\r\nit, I heard an interesting memoir \"On the Minute Structure of Striped\r\nMuscle, with special allusion to a new method of investigation by means\r\nof 'Impressions' stamped in Collodion,\" submitted to the Royal Society by\r\nDr. John Berry Haycraft, in which an analogous method was used to obtain\r\nimpressions of delicate microscopic structures.\r\n\r\n_Photographs_ are valuable in themselves, and the negatives serve for\r\nsubsequent _enlargements_. They are unquestionably accurate, and the\r\nlabour of making them being mechanical, may be delegated. If the print be\r\nin printer's ink on white paper, the process is straightforward, first of\r\nobtaining a negative and afterwards photo-prints from it. The importance\r\nof the paper or card used to receive the finger print being quite white,\r\nhas already been pointed out. An imprint on white crockery-ware is\r\nbeautifully clear. Some of the photographs may be advantageously printed\r\nby the ferro-prussiate process. The paper used for it does not curl when\r\ndry, its texture is good for writing on, and the blue colour of the print\r\nmakes handwriting clearly legible, whether it be in ink or in pencil.\r\n\r\nPrints on glass have great merits for use as lantern slides, but it must\r\nbe recollected that they may take some days to dry, and that when dry the\r\nink can be only too easily detached from them by water, which insinuates\r\nitself between the dry ink and the glass. Of course they could be\r\nvarnished, if the trouble and cost were no objection, and so preserved.\r\nThe negative print left on an inked slab, after the finger has touched it,\r\nis sometimes very clear, that on smoked glass better, and on smoked mica\r\nthe clearest of all. These have merely to be placed in the enlarging\r\ncamera, where the negative image thrown on argento-bromide paper will\r\nyield a positive print. (See p. 90.)\r\n\r\nI have made, by hand, many enlargements with a prism (camera lucida), but\r\nit is difficult to enlarge more than five times by means of it. So much\r\nshade is cast by the head that the prism can hardly be used at a less\r\ndistance than 3 inches from the print, or one quarter the distance (12\r\ninches) at which a book is usually read, while the paper on which the\r\ndrawing is made cannot well be more than 15 inches below the prism; so it\r\nmakes an enlargement of (4 x 15)/12 or five-fold. This is a very\r\nconvenient method of analysing a pattern, since the lines follow only the\r\naxes of the ridges, as in Plate 3, Fig. 5. The prism and attached\r\napparatus may be kept permanently mounted, ready for use at any time,\r\nwithout the trouble of any adjustment.\r\n\r\nAn enlarging pantagraph has also been of frequent use to me, in which the\r\ncross-wires of a low-power microscope took the place of the pointer. It\r\nhas many merits, but its action was not equally free in all directions;\r\nthe enlarged traces were consequently jagged, and required subsequent\r\nsmoothing.\r\n\r\nAll hand-made enlargements are tedious to produce, as the total length of\r\nlineations to be followed is considerable. In a single finger print made\r\nby dabbing down the finger, their actual length amounts to about 18\r\ninches; therefore in a five-fold enlargement of the entire print the\r\npencil has to be carefully directed over five times that distance, or more\r\nthan 7 feet.\r\n\r\nLarge copies of tracings made on transparent paper, either by the Camera\r\nLucida or by the Pantagraph, are easily printed by the ferro-prussiate\r\nphotographic process mentioned above, in the same way that plans are\r\ncopied by engineers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE RIDGES AND THEIR USES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe palmar surface of the hands and the soles of the feet, both in men and\r\nmonkeys, are covered with minute ridges that bear a superficial\r\nresemblance to those made on sand by wind or flowing water. They form\r\nsystems which run in bold sweeps, though the courses of the individual\r\nridges are less regular. Each ridge (Plate 3, Fig. 5) is characterised by\r\nnumerous minute peculiarities, called _Minutiae_ in this book, here\r\ndividing into two, and there uniting with another (_a_, _b_), or it may\r\ndivide and almost immediately reunite, enclosing a small circular or\r\nelliptical space (_c_); at other times its beginning or end is markedly\r\nindependent (_d_, _e_); lastly, the ridge may be so short as to form a\r\nsmall island (_f_).\r\n\r\nWhenever an interspace is left between the boundaries of different systems\r\nof ridges, it is filled by a small system of its own, which will have some\r\ncharacteristic shape, and be called a _pattern_ in this book.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 3.\r\n\r\nFIG. 5. Characteristic peculiarities in Ridges (about 8 times the natural\r\nsize).\r\n\r\nFIG. 6. Systems of Ridges, and the Creases in the Palm.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are three particularly well-marked systems of ridges in the palm of\r\nthe hand marked in Plate 3, Fig. 6, ~1~, as Th, AB, and BC. The system Th\r\nis that which runs over the ball of the thumb and adjacent parts of the\r\npalm. It is bounded by the line _a_ which starts from the middle of the\r\npalm close to the wrist, and sweeps thence round the ball of the thumb to\r\nthe edge of the palm on the side of the thumb, which it reaches about half\r\nan inch, more or less, below the base of the fore-finger. The system AB is\r\nbounded towards the thumb by the above line _a_, and towards the little\r\nfinger by the line _b_; the latter starts from about the middle of the\r\nlittle-finger side of the palm, and emerges on the opposite side just\r\nbelow the fore-finger. Consequently, every ridge that wholly crosses the\r\npalm is found in AB. The system BC is bounded thumbwards by the line _b_,\r\nuntil that line arrives at a point immediately below the axis of the\r\nfore-finger; there the boundary of BC leaves the line _b_, and skirts the\r\nbase of the fore-finger until it reaches the interval which separates the\r\nfore and middle fingers. The upper boundary of BC is the line _c_, which\r\nleaves the little-finger side of the palm at a small distance below the\r\nbase of the little finger, and terminates between the fore and middle\r\nfingers. Other systems are found between _c_ and the middle, ring, and\r\nlittle fingers; they are somewhat more variable than those just described,\r\nas will be seen by comparing the five different palms shown in Fig. 6.\r\n\r\nAn interesting example of the interpolation of a small and independent\r\nsystem occurs frequently in the middle of one or other of the systems AB\r\nor BC, at the place where the space covered by the systems of ridges\r\nbegins to broaden out very rapidly. There are two ways in which the\r\nnecessary supply of ridges makes its appearance, the one is by a series of\r\nsuccessive embranchments (Fig. 6, ~1~), the other is by the insertion of\r\nan independent system, as shown in ~4~, ~5~. Another example of an\r\ninterpolated system, but of rarer occurrence, is found in the system Th,\r\non the ball of the thumb, as seen in ~2~.\r\n\r\nFar more definite in position, and complex in lineation, are the small\r\nindependent systems which appear on the bulbs of the thumb and fingers.\r\nThey are more instructive to study, more easy to classify, and will alone\r\nbe discussed in this book.\r\n\r\nIn the diagram of the hand, Fig. 6, ~1~, the three chief cheiromantic\r\ncreases are indicated by dots, but are not numbered. They are made (1) by\r\nthe flexure of the thumb, (2) of the four fingers simultaneously, and (3)\r\nof the middle, ring, and little fingers simultaneously, while the\r\nfore-finger remains extended. There is no exact accordance between the\r\ncourses of the creases and those of the adjacent ridges, less still do the\r\nformer agree with the boundaries of the systems. The accordance is closest\r\nbetween the crease (1) and the ridges in Th; nevertheless that crease does\r\nnot agree with the line _a_, but usually lies considerably within it. The\r\ncrease (2) cuts the ridges on either side, at an angle of about 30\r\ndegrees. The crease (3) is usually parallel to the ridges between which it\r\nruns, but is often far from accordant with the line _c_. The creases at\r\nthe various joints of the thumb and fingers cut the ridges at small\r\nangles, say, very roughly, of 15 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe supposition is therefore untenable that the courses of the ridges are\r\nwholly determined by the flexures. It appears, however, that the courses\r\nof the ridges and those of the lines of flexure may be in part, but in\r\npart only, due to the action of the same causes.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the creases of the hand being strongly marked in the\r\nnewly-born child, has been considered by some to testify to the archaic\r\nand therefore important character of their origin. The crumpled condition\r\nof the hand of the infant, during some months before its birth, seems to\r\nme, however, quite sufficient to account for the creases.\r\n\r\nI possess a few specimens of hand prints of persons taken when children,\r\nand again, after an interval of several years: they show a general\r\naccordance in respect to the creases, but not sufficiently close for\r\nidentification.\r\n\r\nThe ridges on the feet and toes are less complex than those on the hands\r\nand digits, and are less serviceable for present purposes, though equally\r\ninteresting to physiologists. Having given but little attention to them\r\nmyself, they will not be again referred to.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe ridges are studded with minute pores which are the open mouths of the\r\nducts of the somewhat deeply-seated glands, whose office is to secrete\r\nperspiration: Plate 10, _n_, is a good example of them. The distance\r\nbetween adjacent pores on the same ridge is, roughly speaking, about half\r\nthat which separates the ridges. The lines of a pattern are such as an\r\nartist would draw, if dots had been made on a sheet of paper in positions\r\ncorresponding to the several pores, and he endeavoured to connect them by\r\nevenly flowing curves; it would be difficult to draw a pattern under these\r\nconditions, and within definite boundaries, that cannot be matched in a\r\nliving hand.\r\n\r\nThe embryological development of the ridges has been studied by many, but\r\nmore especially by Dr. A. Kollmann,[1] whose careful investigations and\r\nbibliography should be consulted by physiologists interested in the\r\nsubject. He conceives the ridges to be formed through lateral pressures\r\nbetween nascent structures.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 4.\r\n\r\nFIG. 7. SCARS AND CUTS, AND THEIR EFFECTS ON THE RIDGES.\r\n\r\nFIG. 8. FORMATION OF INTERSPACE AND EXAMPLES OF THE ENCLOSED PATTERNS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ridges are said to be first discernible in the fourth month of\r\nfoetal life, and fully formed by the sixth. In babies and children the\r\ndelicacy of the ridges is proportionate to the smallness of their stature.\r\nThey grow simultaneously with the general growth of the body, and continue\r\nto be sharply defined until old age has set in, when an incipient\r\ndisintegration of the texture of the skin spoils, and may largely\r\nobliterate them, as in the finger prints on the title-page. They develop\r\nmost in hands that do a moderate amount of work, and they are strongly\r\ndeveloped in the foot, which has the hard work of supporting the weight\r\nof the body. They are, as already mentioned, but faintly developed in the\r\nhands of ladies, rendered delicate by the continual use of gloves and lack\r\nof manual labour, and in idiots of the lowest type who are incapable of\r\nlabouring at all. When the skin becomes thin, the ridges simultaneously\r\nsubside in height. They are obliterated by the callosities formed on the\r\nhands of labourers and artisans in many trades, by the constant pressure\r\nof their peculiar tools. The ridges on the side of the left fore-finger of\r\ntailors and seamstresses are often temporarily destroyed by the needle; an\r\ninstance of this is given in Plate 4, Fig. 7, _b_. Injuries, when they are\r\nsufficiently severe to leave permanent scars, destroy the ridges to that\r\nextent. If a piece of flesh is sliced off, or if an ulcer has eaten so\r\ndeeply as to obliterate the perspiratory glands, a white cicatrix, without\r\npores or ridges, is the result (Fig. 7, _a_). Lesser injuries are not\r\npermanent. My assistant happened to burn his finger rather sharply; the\r\ndaily prints he took of it, illustrated the progress of healing in an\r\ninteresting manner; finally the ridges were wholly restored. A deep clean\r\ncut leaves a permanent thin mark across the ridges (Fig. 7, _c_),\r\nsometimes without any accompanying puckering; but there is often a\r\ndisplacement of the ridges on both sides of it, exactly like a \"fault\" in\r\nstratified rocks. A cut, or other injury that is not a clean incision,\r\nleaves a scar with puckerings on all sides, as in Fig. 7, _a_, making the\r\nridges at that part undecipherable, even if it does not wholly obliterate\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe latest and best investigations on the evolution of the ridges have\r\nbeen made by Dr. H. Klaatsch.[2] He shows that the earliest appearance in\r\nthe Mammalia of structures analogous to ridges is one in which small\r\neminences occur on the ball of the foot, through which the sweat glands\r\nissue in no particular order. The arrangement of the papillae into rows,\r\nand the accompanying orderly arrangement of the sweat glands, is a\r\nsubsequent stage in evolution. The prehensile tail of the Howling Monkey\r\nserves as a fifth hand, and the naked concave part of the tail, with which\r\nit grasps and holds on to boughs, is furnished with ridges arranged\r\ntransversely in beautiful order. The numerous drawings of the hands of\r\nmonkeys by Allix[3] may be referred to with advantage.\r\n\r\nThe uses of the ridges are primarily, as I suppose, to raise the mouths of\r\nthe ducts, so that the excretions which they pour out may the more easily\r\nbe got rid of; and secondarily, in some obscure way, to assist the sense\r\nof touch. They are said to be moulded upon the subcutaneous papillae in\r\nsuch a manner that the ultimate organs of touch, namely, the Pacinian\r\nbodies, etc.--into the variety of which it is unnecessary here to\r\nenter--are more closely congregated under the bases of the ridges than\r\nunder the furrows, and it is easy, on those grounds, to make reasonable\r\nguesses how the ridges may assist the sense of touch. They must\r\nconcentrate pressures, that would otherwise be spread over the surface\r\ngenerally, upon the parts which are most richly supplied with the\r\nterminations of nerves. By their means it would become possible to\r\nneutralise the otherwise dulling effect of a thick protective epidermis.\r\nTheir existence in transverse ridges on the inner surface of the\r\nprehensile tails of monkeys admits of easy justification from this point\r\nof view. The ridges so disposed cannot prevent the tail from curling, and\r\nthey must add materially to its sensitiveness. They seem to produce the\r\nlatter effect on the hands of man, for, as the epidermis thickens under\r\nuse within moderate limits, so the prominence of the ridges increases.\r\n\r\nSupposing the ultimate organs of the sense of touch to be really\r\ncongregated more thickly under the ridges than under the furrows--on which\r\nthere has been some question--the power of tactile discrimination would\r\ndepend very much on the closeness of the ridges. The well-known experiment\r\nwith the two points of a pair of compasses, is exactly suited to test the\r\ntruth of this. It consists in determining the smallest distance apart, of\r\nthe two points, at which their simultaneous pressure conveys the sensation\r\nof a double prick. Those persons in whom the ridge-interval was short\r\nmight be expected to perceive the double sensation, while others whose\r\nridge-interval was wide would only perceive a single one, the distance\r\napart of the compass points, and the parts touched by them, being the same\r\nin both cases. I was very glad to avail myself of the kind offer of Mr.\r\nE. B. Titchener to make an adequate course of experiments at Professor\r\nWundt's psycho-physical laboratory at Leipzig, to decide this question. He\r\nhad the advantage there of being able to operate on fellow-students who\r\nwere themselves skilled in such lines of investigation, so while his own\r\nexperience was a considerable safeguard against errors of method, that\r\nsafety was reinforced by the fact that his experiments were conducted\r\nunder the watchful eyes of competent and critical friends. The result of\r\nthe enquiry was decisive. It was proved to demonstration that the fineness\r\nor coarseness of the ridges in different persons had no effect whatever on\r\nthe delicacy of their tactile discrimination. Moreover, it made no\r\ndifference in the results, whether one or both points of the compass\r\nrested on the ridges or in the furrows.\r\n\r\nThe width of the ridge-interval is certainly no test of the relative power\r\nof discrimination of the different parts of the same hand, because, while\r\nthe ridge-interval is nearly uniform over the whole of the palmar surface,\r\nthe least distance between the compass points that gives the sensation of\r\ndoubleness is more than four times greater when they are applied to some\r\nparts of the palm than when they are applied to the bulbs of the fingers.\r\n\r\nThe ridges may subserve another purpose in the act of touch, namely, that\r\nof enabling the character of surfaces to be perceived by the act of\r\nrubbing them with the fingers. We all of us perform this, as it were,\r\nintuitively. It is interesting to ask a person who is ignorant of the\r\nreal intention, to shut his eyes and to ascertain as well as he can by the\r\nsense of touch alone, the material of which any object is made that is\r\nafterwards put into his hands. He will be observed to explore it very\r\ncarefully by rubbing its surface in many directions, and with many degrees\r\nof pressure. The ridges engage themselves with the roughness of the\r\nsurface, and greatly help in calling forth the required sensation, which\r\nis that of a thrill; usually faint, but always to be perceived when the\r\nsensation is analysed, and which becomes very distinct when the\r\nindentations are at equal distances apart, as in a file or in velvet. A\r\nthrill is analogous to a musical note, and the characteristics to the\r\nsense of touch, of different surfaces when they are rubbed by the fingers,\r\nmay be compared to different qualities of sound or noise. There are,\r\nhowever, no pure over-tones in the case of touch, as there are in nearly\r\nall sounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nPATTERNS: THEIR OUTLINES AND CORES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe patterns on the thumb and fingers were first discussed at length by\r\nPurkenje in 1823, in a University Thesis or _Commentatio_. I have\r\ntranslated the part that chiefly concerns us, and appended it to this\r\nchapter together with his corresponding illustrations. Subsequent writers\r\nhave adopted his standard types, diminishing or adding to their number as\r\nthe case may be, and guided as he had been, by the superficial appearance\r\nof the lineations.\r\n\r\nIn my earlier trials some three years ago, an attempt at classification\r\nwas made upon that same principle, when the experience gained was\r\ninstructive. It had seemed best to limit them to the prints of a single\r\ndigit, and the thumb was selected. I collected enough specimens to fill\r\nfourteen sheets, containing in the aggregate 504 prints of right thumbs,\r\narranged in six lines and six columns (6 x 6 x 14 = 504), and another set\r\nof fourteen sheets containing the corresponding left thumbs. Then, for the\r\ngreater convenience of study these sheets were photographed, and\r\nenlargements upon paper to about two and a half times the natural size\r\nmade from the negatives. The enlargements of the right thumb prints were\r\nreversed, in order to make them comparable on equal terms with those of\r\nthe left. The sheets were then cut up into rectangles about the size of\r\nsmall playing-cards, each of which contained a single print, and the\r\nregister number in my catalogue was entered on its back, together with the\r\nletters L. for left, or R.R. for reversed right, as the case might be.\r\n\r\nOn trying to sort them according to Purkenje's standards, I failed\r\ncompletely, and many analogous plans were attempted without success. Next\r\nI endeavoured to sort the patterns into groups so that the central pattern\r\nof each group should differ by a unit of \"equally discernible difference\"\r\nfrom the central patterns of the adjacent groups, proposing to adopt those\r\ncentral patterns as standards of reference. After tedious re-sortings,\r\nsome sixty standards were provisionally selected, and the whole laid by\r\nfor a few days. On returning to the work with a fresh mind, it was painful\r\nto find how greatly my judgment had changed in the interim, and how faulty\r\na classification that seemed tolerably good a week before, looked then.\r\nMoreover, I suffered the shame and humiliation of discovering that the\r\nidentity of certain duplicates had been overlooked, and that one print had\r\nbeen mistaken for another. Repeated trials of the same kind made it\r\ncertain that finality would never be reached by the path hitherto\r\npursued.\r\n\r\nOn considering the causes of these doubts and blunders, different\r\ninfluences were found to produce them, any one of which was sufficient by\r\nitself to give rise to serious uncertainty. A complex pattern is capable\r\nof suggesting various readings, as the figuring on a wall-paper may\r\nsuggest a variety of forms and faces to those who have such fancies. The\r\nnumber of illusive renderings of prints taken from the same finger, is\r\ngreatly increased by such trifles as the relative breadths of their\r\nrespective lineations and the differences in their depths of tint. The\r\nridges themselves are soft in substance, and of various heights, so that a\r\nsmall difference in the pressure applied, or in the quantity of ink used,\r\nmay considerably affect the width of the lines and the darkness of\r\nportions of the print. Certain ridges may thereby catch the attention at\r\none time, though not at others, and give a bias to some false conception\r\nof the pattern. Again, it seldom happens that different impressions of the\r\nsame digit are printed from exactly the same part of it, consequently the\r\nportion of the pattern that supplies the dominant character will often be\r\nquite different in the two prints. Hence the eye is apt to be deceived\r\nwhen it is guided merely by the general appearance. A third cause of error\r\nis still more serious; it is that patterns, especially those of a spiral\r\nform, may be apparently similar, yet fundamentally unlike, the unaided eye\r\nbeing frequently unable to analyse them and to discern real differences.\r\nBesides all this, the judgment is distracted by the mere size of the\r\npattern, which catches the attention at once, and by other secondary\r\nmatters such as the number of turns in the whorled patterns, and the\r\nrelative dimensions of their different parts. The first need to be\r\nsatisfied, before it could become possible to base the classification upon\r\na more sure foundation than that of general appearance, was to establish a\r\nwell-defined point or points of reference in the patterns. This was done\r\nby utilising the centres of the one or two triangular plots (see Plate 4,\r\nFig. 8, ~2~, ~3~, ~4~) which are found in the great majority of patterns,\r\nand whose existence was pointed out by Purkenje, but not their more remote\r\ncause, which is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe ridges, as was shown in the diagram (Plate 3) of the palm of the hand,\r\nrun athwart the fingers in rudely parallel lines up to the last joint, and\r\nif it were not for the finger-nail, would apparently continue parallel up\r\nto the extreme finger-tip. But the presence of the nail disturbs their\r\nparallelism and squeezes them downwards on both sides of the finger. (See\r\nFig. 8, ~2~.) Consequently, the ridges that run close to the tip are\r\ngreatly arched, those that successively follow are gradually less arched\r\nuntil, in some cases, all signs of the arch disappear at about the level\r\nof the first joint (Fig. 8, ~1~). Usually, however, this gradual\r\ntransition from an arch to a straight line fails to be carried out,\r\ncausing a break in the orderly sequence, and a consequent interspace (Fig.\r\n8, ~2~). The topmost boundary of the interspace is formed by the lowermost\r\narch, and its lowermost boundary by the topmost straight ridge. But an\r\nequally large number of ducts exist within the interspace, as are to be\r\nfound in adjacent areas of equal size, whose mouths require to be\r\nsupported and connected. This is effected by the interpolation of an\r\nindependent system of ridges arranged in loops (Fig. 8, ~3~; also Plate 5,\r\nFig. 9, _a_, _f_), or in scrolls (Fig. 8, ~4~; also Fig. 9, _g_, _h_), and\r\nthis interpolated system forms the \"pattern.\" Now the existence of an\r\ninterspace implies the divergence of two previously adjacent ridges (Fig.\r\n8, ~2~), in order to embrace it. Just in front of the place where the\r\ndivergence begins, and before the sweep of the pattern is reached, there\r\nare usually one or more very short cross-ridges. Their effect is to\r\ncomplete the enclosure of the minute triangular plot in question. Where\r\nthere is a plot on both sides of the finger, the line that connects them\r\n(Fig. 8, ~4~) serves as a base line whereby the pattern may be oriented,\r\nand the position of any point roughly charted. Where there is a plot on\r\nonly one side of the finger (Fig. 8, ~3~), the pattern has almost\r\nnecessarily an axis, which serves for orientation, and the pattern can\r\nstill be charted, though on a different principle, by dropping a\r\nperpendicular from the plot on to the axis, in the way there shown.\r\n\r\nThese plots form corner-stones to my system of outlining and subsequent\r\nclassification; it is therefore extremely important that a sufficient area\r\nof the finger should be printed to include them. This can always be done\r\nby slightly _rolling_ the finger (p. 39), the result being, in the\r\nlanguage of map-makers, a cylindrical projection of the finger (see Plate\r\n5, Fig. 9, _a-h_). Large as these impressions look, they are of the\r\nnatural size, taken from ordinary thumbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 5.\r\n\r\nFIG. 9. EXAMPLES OF OUTLINED PATTERNS (The Specimens are rolled\r\nimpressions of natural size).]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The outlines._--The next step is to give a clear and definite shape to\r\nthe pattern by drawing its outline (Fig. 9). Take a fine pen, pencil, or\r\npaint brush, and follow in succession each of the two diverging ridges\r\nthat start from either plot. The course of each ridge must be followed\r\nwith scrupulous conscientiousness, marking it with a clean line as far as\r\nit can be traced. If the ridge bifurcates, always follow the branch that\r\ntrends towards the middle of the pattern. If it stops short, let the\r\noutline stop short also, and recommence on a fresh ridge, choosing that\r\nwhich to the best of the judgment prolongs the course of the one that\r\nstopped. These outlines have an extraordinary effect in making finger\r\nmarkings intelligible to an untrained eye. What seemed before to be a\r\nvague and bewildering maze of lineations over which the glance wandered\r\ndistractedly, seeking in vain for a point on which to fix itself, now\r\nsuddenly assumes the shape of a sharply-defined figure. Whatever\r\ndifficulties may arise in classifying these figures, they are as nothing\r\ncompared to those experienced in attempting to classify unoutlined\r\npatterns, the outlines giving a precision to their general features which\r\nwas wanting before.\r\n\r\nAfter a pattern has been treated in this way, there is no further occasion\r\nto pore minutely into the finger print, in order to classify it correctly,\r\nfor the bold firm curves of the outline are even more distinct than the\r\nlargest capital letters in the title-page of a book.\r\n\r\nA fair idea of the way in which the patterns are distributed, is given by\r\nPlate 6. Eight persons were taken in the order in which they happened to\r\npresent themselves, and Plate 6 shows the result. For greater clearness,\r\ncolour has been employed to distinguish between the ridges that are\r\nsupplied from the inner and outer sides of the hand respectively. The\r\nwords right and left _must be avoided_ in speaking of patterns, for the\r\ntwo hands are symmetrically disposed, only in a reversed sense. The right\r\nhand does not look like a left hand, but like the reflection of a left\r\nhand in a looking-glass, and _vice versa_. The phrases we shall employ\r\nwill be the _Inner_ and the _Outer_; or thumb-side and little-finger side\r\n(terms which were unfortunately misplaced in my memoir in the _Phil.\r\nTrans._ 1891).\r\n\r\nThere need be no difficulty in remembering the meaning of these terms, if\r\nwe bear in mind that the great toes are undoubtedly innermost; that if we\r\nwalked on all fours as children do, and as our remote ancestors probably\r\ndid, the thumbs also would be innermost, as is the case when the two hands\r\nare impressed side by side on paper. Inner and outer are better than\r\nthumb-side and little-finger side, because the latter cannot be applied to\r\nthe thumbs and little fingers themselves. The anatomical words radial and\r\nulnar referring to the two bones of the fore-arm, are not in popular use,\r\nand they might be similarly inappropriate, for it would sound oddly to\r\nspeak of the radial side of the radius.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 6.\r\n\r\nFIG. 10. OUTLINES OF THE PATTERNS OF THE DIGITS OF EIGHT PERSONS, TAKEN AT\r\nRANDOM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two plots just described will therefore be henceforth designated as\r\nthe Inner and the Outer plots respectively, and symbolised by the letters\r\nI and O.\r\n\r\nThe system of ridges in Fig. 10 that comes from the inner side \"I\" are\r\ncoloured blue; those from the outer \"O\" are coloured red. The employment\r\nof colour instead of variously stippled surfaces is of conspicuous\r\nadvantage to the great majority of persons, though unhappily nearly\r\nuseless to about one man in every twenty-five, who is constitutionally\r\ncolour-blind.\r\n\r\nIt may be convenient when marking finger prints with letters for\r\nreference, to use those that look alike, both in a direct and in a\r\nreversed aspect, as they may require to be read either way. The print is a\r\nreversed picture of the pattern upon the digit that made it. The pattern\r\non one hand is, as already said, a reversed picture of a similar pattern\r\nas it shows on the other. In the various processes by which prints are\r\nmultiplied, the patterns may be reversed and re-reversed. Thus, if a\r\nfinger is impressed on a lithographic stone, the impressions from that\r\nstone are reversals of the impression made by the same finger upon paper.\r\nIf made on transfer paper and thence transferred to stone, there is a\r\nre-reversal. There are even more varied possibilities when photography is\r\nemployed. It is worth recollecting that there are twelve capital letters\r\nin the English alphabet which, if printed in block type, are unaffected by\r\nbeing reversed. They are A.H.I.M.O.T.U.V.W.X.Y.Z. Some symbols do the\r\nsame, such as, * + - = :. These and the letters H.O.I.X. have the\r\nfurther peculiarity of appearing unaltered when upside down.\r\n\r\n_Lenses._--As a rule, only a small magnifying power is needed for drawing\r\noutlines, sufficient to allow the eye to be brought within six inches of\r\nthe paper, for it is only at that short distance that the _minutiae_ of a\r\nfull-sized finger print begin to be clearly discerned. Persons with normal\r\nsight, during their childhood and boy- or girlhood, are able to read as\r\nclosely as this without using a lens, the range in adjustment of the focus\r\nof the eye being then large. But as age advances the range contracts, and\r\nan elderly person with otherwise normal eyesight requires glasses to read\r\na book even at twelve inches from his eye. I now require much optical aid;\r\nwhen reading a book, spectacles of 12-inch focus are necessary; and when\r\nstudying a finger print, 12-inch eye-glasses in addition, the double power\r\nenabling me to see clearly at a distance of only six inches. Perhaps the\r\nmost convenient focus for a lens in ordinary use is 3 inches. It should be\r\nmounted at the end of a long arm that can easily be pushed in any\r\ndirection, sideways, backwards, forwards, and up or down. It is\r\nundesirable to use a higher power than this unless it is necessary,\r\nbecause the field of view becomes narrowed to an inconvenient degree, and\r\nthe nearer the head is to the paper, the darker is the shadow that it\r\ncasts; there is also insufficient room for the use of a pencil.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then a closer inspection is wanted; for which purpose a\r\ndoublet of 1/2-inch focus, standing on three slim legs, answers well.\r\n\r\nFor studying the markings on the fingers themselves, a small folding lens,\r\nsold at opticians' shops under the name of a \"linen tester,\" is very\r\nconvenient. It is so called because it was originally constructed for the\r\npurpose of counting the number of threads in a given space, in a sample of\r\nlinen. It is equally well adapted for counting the number of ridges in a\r\ngiven space.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhoever desires to occupy himself with finger prints, ought to give much\r\ntime and practice to drawing outlines of different impressions of the same\r\ndigits. His own ten fingers, and those of a few friends, will furnish the\r\nnecessary variety of material on which to work. He should not rest\r\nsatisfied until he has gained an assurance that all patterns possess\r\ndefinite figures, which may be latent but are potentially present, and\r\nthat the ridges form something more than a nondescript congeries of\r\nramifications and twists. He should continue to practise until he finds\r\nthat the same ridges have been so nearly followed in duplicate\r\nimpressions, that even in difficult cases his work will rarely vary more\r\nthan a single ridge-interval.\r\n\r\nWhen the triangular plot happens not to be visible, owing to the print\r\nfailing to include it, which is often the case when the finger is not\r\nrolled, as is well shown in the prints of my own ten digits on the\r\ntitle-page, the trend of the ridges so far as they are seen, usually\r\nenables a practised eye to roughly estimate its true position. By means of\r\nthis guidance an approximate, but fairly correct, outline can be drawn.\r\nWhen the habit of judging patterns by their outlines has become familiar,\r\nthe eye will trace them for itself without caring to draw them, and will\r\nprefer an unoutlined pattern to work upon, but even then it is essential\r\nnow and then to follow the outline with a fine point, say that of a\r\npenknife or a dry pen.\r\n\r\nIn selecting standard forms of patterns for the convenience of\r\ndescription, we must be content to disregard a great many of the more\r\nobvious characteristics. For instance, the size of generally similar\r\npatterns in Fig. 10 will be found to vary greatly, but the words large,\r\nmedium, or small may be applied to any pattern, so there is no necessity\r\nto draw a standard outline for each size. Similarly as regards the inwards\r\nor outwards slope of patterns, it is needless to print here a separate\r\nstandard outline for either slope, and equally unnecessary to print\r\noutlines in duplicate, with reversed titles, for the right and left hands\r\nrespectively. The phrase \"a simple spiral\" conveys a well-defined general\r\nidea, but there are four concrete forms of it (see bottom row of Plate 11,\r\nFig. 17, _oj_, _jo_, _ij_, _ji_) which admit of being verbally\r\ndistinguished. Again the internal proportions of any pattern, say those of\r\nsimple spirals, may vary greatly without affecting the fact of their being\r\nsimple spirals. They may be wide or narrow at their mouths, they may be\r\ntwisted up into a point (Plate 8, Fig. 14, ~52~), or they may run in broad\r\ncurls of uniform width (Fig. 14, ~51~, ~54~). Perhaps the best general\r\nrule in selecting standard outlines, is to limit them to such as cannot be\r\nturned into any other by viewing them in an altered aspect, as upside down\r\nor from the back, or by magnifying or deforming them, whether it be\r\nthrough stretching, shrinking, or puckering any part of them. Subject to\r\nthis general rule and to further and more particular descriptions, the\r\nsets (Plates 7 and 8, Figs. 11, 12, 13) will be found to give considerable\r\nhelp in naming the usual patterns.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 7.\r\n\r\nFIG. 11. ARCHES.\r\n\r\nFIG. 12. LOOPS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 8.\r\n\r\nFIG. 13. WHORLS. CORES TO LOOPS.\r\n\r\nFIG. 14. Rods:--their envelopes are indicated by dots. Staples:--their\r\nenvelopes are indicated by dots. Envelopes whether to Rods or\r\nStaples:--here staples only are dotted.\r\n\r\nFIG. 15. CORES TO WHORLS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that they are grouped under the three principal heads\r\nof Arches, Loops, and Whorls, and that under each of these heads some\r\nanalogous patterns as ~4~, ~5~, ~7~, ~8~, etc., are introduced and\r\nunderlined with the word \"see\" so and so, and thus noted as really\r\nbelonging to one of the other heads. This is done to indicate the\r\ncharacter of the transitional cases that unite respectively the Arches\r\nwith the Loops, the Arches with the Whorls, and the Loops with the Whorls.\r\nMore will follow in respect to these. The \"tented arch\" (~3~) is extremely\r\nrare on the thumb; I do not remember ever to have seen it there,\r\nconsequently it did not appear in the plate of patterns in the _Phil.\r\nTrans._ which referred to thumbs. On the other hand, the \"banded duplex\r\nspiral\" (~30~) is common in the thumb, but rare elsewhere. There are some\r\ncompound patterns, especially the \"spiral in loop\" (~21~) and the \"circlet\r\nin loop\" (~22~), which are as much loops as whorls; but are reckoned as\r\nwhorls. The \"twinned loop\" (~16~) is of more frequent occurrence than\r\nwould be supposed from the examination of _dabbed_ impressions, as the\r\nonly part of the outer loop then in view resembles outside arches; it is\r\ndue to a double separation of the ridges (Plate 4, Fig. 8), and a\r\nconsequent double interspace. The \"crested loop\" (~13~) may sometimes be\r\nregarded as an incipient form of a \"duplex spiral\" (~29~).\r\n\r\nThe reader may also refer to Plate 16, which contains what is there called\r\nthe C set of standard patterns. They were arranged and used for a special\r\npurpose, as described in Chapter XI. They refer to impressions of the\r\nright hand.\r\n\r\nAs a variety of Cores, differing in shape and size, may be found within\r\neach of the outlines, it is advisable to describe them separately. Plate\r\n8, Fig. 14 shows a series of the cores of loops, in which the innermost\r\nlineations may be either straight or curved back; in the one case they are\r\nhere called rods (~31~ to ~35~); in the other (~36~ to ~42~), staples. The\r\nfirst of the ridges that envelops the core, whether the core be a rod,\r\nmany rods, or a staple, is also shown and named (~43~ to ~48~). None of\r\nthe descriptions are intended to apply to more than the _very end_ of the\r\ncore, say, from the tip downwards to a distance equal to two average\r\nridge-intervals in length. If more of the core be taken into account, the\r\nmany varieties in their lower parts begin to make description confusing.\r\nIn respect to the \"parted\" staples and envelopes, and those that are\r\nsingle-eyed, the description may further mention the side on which the\r\nparting or the eye occurs, whether it be the Inner or the Outer.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of Fig. 14, ~49-54~, is given a series of rings, spirals,\r\nand plaits, in which nearly all the clearly distinguishable varieties are\r\nincluded, no regard being paid to the direction of the twist or to the\r\nnumber of turns. ~49~ is a set of concentric circles, ~50~ of ellipses:\r\nthey are rarely so in a strict sense throughout the pattern, usually\r\nbreaking away into a more or less spiriform arrangement as in ~51~. A\r\ncurious optical effect is connected with the circular forms, which becomes\r\nalmost annoying when many specimens are examined in succession. They seem\r\nto be cones standing bodily out from the paper. This singular appearance\r\nbecomes still more marked when they are viewed with only one eye; no\r\nstereoscopic guidance then correcting the illusion of their being contour\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nAnother curious effect is seen in ~53~, which has the appearance of a\r\nplait or overlap; two systems of ridges that roll together, end bluntly,\r\nthe end of the one system running right into a hollow curve of the other,\r\nand there stopping short; it seems, at the first glance, to run beneath\r\nit, as if it were a plait. This mode of ending forms a singular contrast\r\nto that shown in ~51~ and ~52~, where the ridges twist themselves into a\r\npoint. ~54~ is a deep spiral, sometimes having a large core filled with\r\nupright and nearly parallel lines; occasionally they are bulbous, and\r\nresemble the commoner \"monkey\" type, see ~35~.\r\n\r\nWhen the direction of twist is described, the language must be\r\nunambiguous: the following are the rules I adopt. The course of the ridge\r\nis always followed _towards_ the _centre_ of the pattern, and not away\r\nfrom it. Again, the direction of its course when so followed is specified\r\nat the place where it attains its _highest_ point, or that nearest to the\r\nfinger-tip; its course at that point must needs be horizontal, and\r\ntherefore directed either towards the inner or the outer side.\r\n\r\nThe amount of twist has a strong tendency to coincide with either one,\r\ntwo, three, four, or more half-turns, and not to stop short in\r\nintermediate positions. Here are indications of some unknown fundamental\r\nlaw, analogous apparently to that which causes Loops to be by far the\r\ncommonest pattern.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe classification into Arches, Loops, and Whorls is based on the degree\r\nof curvature of the ridges, and enables almost any pattern to be sorted\r\nunder one or other of those three heads. There are a few ambiguous\r\npatterns, and others which are nondescript, but the former are uncommon\r\nand the latter rare; as these exceptions give little real inconvenience,\r\nthe classification works easily and well.\r\n\r\nArches are formed when the ridges run from one side to the other of the\r\nbulb of the digit without making any backward turn or twist. Loops, when\r\nthere is a single backward turn, but no twist. Whorls, when there is a\r\nturn through at least one complete circle; they are also considered to\r\ninclude all duplex spirals.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 9.\r\n\r\nFIG. 15. TRANSITIONAL PATTERNS--ARCHES AND LOOPS (enlarged three times).]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 10.\r\n\r\nFIG. 16. TRANSITIONAL PATTERNS--LOOPS AND WHORLS (enlarged three times).]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief theoretical objection to this threefold system of classification\r\nlies in the existence of certain compound patterns, by far the most common\r\nof which are Whorls enclosed within Loops (Plates 7, 8, Fig. 12, ~15~,\r\n~18~, ~19~, and Fig. 13, ~20-23~). They are as much Loops as Whorls, and\r\nproperly ought to be relegated to a fourth class. I have not done so, but\r\ncalled them Whorls, for a practical reason which is cogent. In an\r\nimperfect impression, such as is made by merely dabbing the inked finger\r\nupon paper, the enveloping loop is often too incompletely printed to\r\nenable its existence to be surely ascertained, especially when the\r\nenclosed whorl is so large (Fig. 13, ~23~) that there are only one or two\r\nenveloping ridges to represent the loop. On the other hand, the whorled\r\ncharacter of the core can hardly fail to be recognised. The practical\r\ndifficulties lie almost wholly in rightly classifying a few transitional\r\nforms, diagrammatically and roughly expressed in Fig. 11, ~4~, ~5~, and\r\nFig. 12, ~8~, ~18~, ~19~, with the words \"see\" so and so written below,\r\nand of which actual examples are given on an enlarged scale in Plates 9\r\nand 10, Figs. 15 and 16. Here Fig. 15, _a_ is an undoubted arch, and _c_\r\nan undoubted nascent loop; but _b_ is transitional between them, though\r\nnearer to a loop than an arch, _d_ may be thought transitional in the same\r\nway, but it has an incipient curl which becomes marked in _e_, while it\r\nhas grown into a decided whorl in _f_; _d_ should also be compared with\r\n_j_, which is in some sense a stage towards _k_. _g_ is a nascent\r\ntented-arch, fully developed in _i_, where the pattern as a whole has a\r\nslight slope, but is otherwise fairly symmetrical. In _h_ there is some\r\nwant of symmetry, and a tendency to the formation of a loop on the right\r\nside (refer back to Plate 7, Fig. 11, ~4~, and Fig. 12, ~12~); it is a\r\ntransitional case between a tented arch and a loop, with most resemblance\r\nto the latter. Plate 10, Fig. 16 illustrates eyed patterns; here _l_ and\r\n_m_ are parts of decided loops; _p_, _q_, and _r_ are decided whorls, but\r\n_n_ is transitional, inclining towards a loop, and _o_ is transitional,\r\ninclining towards a whorl. _s_ is a nascent form of an invaded loop, and\r\nis nearly related to _l_; _t_ and _u_ are decidedly invaded loops.\r\n\r\nThe Arch-Loop-Whorl, or, more briefly, the A. L. W. system of\r\nclassification, while in some degree artificial, is very serviceable for\r\npreliminary statistics, such as are needed to obtain a broad view of the\r\ndistribution of the various patterns. A minute subdivision under numerous\r\nheads would necessitate a proportional and somewhat overwhelming amount of\r\nstatistical labour. Fifty-four different standard varieties are by no\r\nmeans an extravagant number, but to treat fifty-four as thoroughly as\r\nthree would require eighteen times as much material and labour. Effort is\r\neconomised by obtaining broad results from a discussion of the A. L. W.\r\nclasses, afterwards verifying or extending them by special inquiries into\r\na few of the further subdivisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 11.\r\n\r\nFIG. 17. ORIGIN OF SUPPLY OF RIDGES TO PATTERNS OF PRINTS OF RIGHT HAND.\r\n\r\nFIG. 18. Ambiguities in prints of the Minutiae.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe divergent ridges that bound any simple pattern admit of nine, and only\r\nnine, distinct variations in the first part of their course. The bounding\r\nridge that has attained the summit of any such pattern must have arrived\r\neither from the Inner plot (I), the Outer plot (O), or from both.\r\nSimilarly as regards the bounding ridge that lies at the lowest point of\r\nthe pattern. Any one of the three former events may occur in connection\r\nwith any of the three latter events, so they afford in all 3 x 3, or nine\r\npossible combinations. It is convenient to distinguish them by easily\r\nintelligible symbols. Thus, let _i_ signify a bounding line which starts\r\nfrom the point I, whether it proceeds to the summit or to the base of the\r\npattern; let _o_ be a line that similarly proceeds from O, and let _u_ be\r\na line that unites the two plots I and O, either by summit or by base.\r\nAgain, let two symbols be used, of which the first shall always refer to\r\nthe summit, and the second to the base of the pattern. Then the nine\r\npossible cases are--_uu_, _ui_, _uo_; _iu_, _ii_, _io_; _ou_, _oi_, _oo_.\r\nThe case of the arches is peculiar, but they may be fairly classed under\r\nthe symbol _uu_.\r\n\r\nThis easy method of classification has much power. For example, the four\r\npossible kinds of simple spirals (see the 1st, 2nd, and the 5th and 6th\r\ndiagrams in the lowest row of Plate 11, Fig. 17) are wholly determined by\r\nthe letters _oj_, _jo_, _ij_, _ji_ respectively. The two forms of duplex\r\nspirals are similarly determined by _oi_ and _io_ (see 4th and 5th\r\ndiagrams in the upper row of Fig. 17), the two slopes of loops by _oo_ and\r\n_ii_ (3rd and 4th in the lower row). It also shows very distinctly the\r\nsources whence the streams of ridges proceed that feed the pattern, which\r\nitself affords another basis for classification. The resource against\r\nuncertainty in respect to ambiguous or difficult patterns is to compile a\r\ndictionary of them, with the heads under which it is advisable that they\r\nshould severally be classed. It would load these pages too heavily to give\r\nsuch a dictionary here. Moreover, it ought to be revised by many\r\nexperienced eyes, and the time is hardly ripe for this; when it is, it\r\nwould be no difficult task, out of the large number of prints of separate\r\nfingers which for instance I possess (some 15,000), to make an adequate\r\nselection, to enlarge them photographically, and finally to print the\r\nresults in pairs, the one untouched, the other outlined and classified.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked why ridges are followed and not furrows, the furrow being\r\nthe real boundary between two systems. The reply is, that the ridges are\r\nthe easiest to trace; and, as the error through following the ridges\r\ncannot exceed one-half of a ridge-interval, I have been content to\r\ndisregard it. I began by tracing furrows, but preferred the ridges after\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\n_Measurements._--It has been already shown that when both plots are\r\npresent (Plate 4, Fig. 8, ~4~), they form the termini of a base line, from\r\nwhich any part of the pattern may be triangulated, as surveyors would say.\r\nAlso, that when only one plot exists (~3~), and the pattern has an axis\r\n(which it necessarily has in all ordinary _ii_ and _oo_ cases), a\r\nperpendicular can be let fall upon that axis, whose intersection with it\r\nwill serve as a second point of reference. But our methods must not be too\r\nrefined. The centres of the plots are not determinable with real\r\nexactness, and repeated prints from so soft a substance as flesh are\r\noften somewhat dissimilar, the one being more or less broadened out than\r\nthe other, owing to unequal pressure. It is therefore well to use such\r\nother more convenient points of reference as the particular pattern may\r\npresent. In loops, the intersection of the axis with the summit of the\r\ninnermost bend, whether it be a staple or the envelope to a rod (Fig. 14,\r\nsecond and third rows of diagrams), is a well-defined position. In\r\nspirals, the centre of the pattern is fairly well defined; also a\r\nperpendicular erected from the middle of the base to the outline above and\r\nbelow (Fig. 8, ~4~) is precise and convenient.\r\n\r\nIn prints of adults, measurements may be made in absolute units of length,\r\nas in fractions of an inch, or else in millimetres. An average\r\nridge-interval makes, however, a better unit, being independent of growth;\r\nit is strictly necessary to adopt it in prints made by children, if\r\npresent measurements are hereafter to be compared with future ones. The\r\nsimplest plan of determining and employing this unit is to count the\r\nnumber of ridges to the nearest half-ridge, within the space of one-tenth\r\nof an inch, measured along the axis of the finger at and about the point\r\nwhere it cuts the _summit_ of the outline; then, having already prepared\r\nscales suitable for the various likely numbers, to make the measurements\r\nwith the appropriate scale. Thus, if five ridges were crossed by the axis\r\nat that part, in the space of one-tenth of an inch, each unit of the scale\r\nto be used would be one-fiftieth of an inch; if there were four ridges,\r\neach unit of the scale would be one-fortieth of an inch; if six ridges\r\none-sixtieth, and so forth. There is no theoretical or practical\r\ndifficulty, only rough indications being required.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to describe in detail how the bearings of any point may\r\nbe expressed after the fashion of compass bearings, the direction I-O\r\ntaking the place of East-West, the uppermost direction that of North, and\r\nthe lowermost of South. Little more is practically wanted than to be able\r\nto describe roughly the position of some remarkable feature in the print,\r\nas of an island or an enclosure. A ridge that is characterised by these or\r\nany other marked peculiarity is easily identified by the above means, and\r\nit thereupon serves as an exact basis for the description of other\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Purkenje's \"Commentatio.\"_\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to Purkenje, who has the honour of being\r\nthe person who first described the inner scrolls (as distinguished from\r\nthe outlines of the patterns) formed by the ridges. He did so in a\r\nUniversity Thesis delivered at Breslau in 1823, entitled _Commentatio de\r\nexamine physiologico organi visus et systematis cutanei_ (a physiological\r\nexamination of the visual organ and of the cutaneous system). The thesis\r\nis an ill-printed small 8vo pamphlet of fifty-eight pages, written in a\r\nform of Latin that is difficult to translate accurately into free English.\r\nIt is, however, of great historical interest and reputation, having been\r\nreferred to by nearly all subsequent writers, some of whom there is\r\nreason to suspect never saw it, but contented themselves with quoting a\r\nvery small portion at second-hand. No copy of the pamphlet existed in any\r\npublic medical library in England, nor in any private one so far as I\r\ncould learn; neither could I get a sight of it at some important\r\ncontinental libraries. One copy was known of it in America. The very\r\nzealous Librarian of the Royal College of Surgeons was so good as to take\r\nmuch pains at my instance, to procure one: his zeal was happily and\r\nunexpectedly rewarded by success, and the copy is now securely lodged in\r\nthe library of the College.\r\n\r\n_The Title_\r\n\r\nCommentatio de Examine physiologico organi visus et systematis cutanei\r\nquam pro loco in gratioso medicorum ordine rite obtinendo die Dec. 22,\r\n1823.

Some general account of them is always to be\r\n    found in every manual of physiology and anatomy, but in an organ of\r\n    such importance as the human hand, used as it is for very varied\r\n    movements, and especially serviceable to the sense of touch, no\r\n    research, however minute, can fail in yielding some gratifying\r\n    addition to our knowledge of that organ. After numberless\r\n    observations, I have thus far met with nine principal varieties of\r\n    curvature according to which the tactile furrows are disposed upon the\r\n    inner surface of the last phalanx of the fingers. I will describe them\r\n    concisely, and refer to the diagrams for further explanation (see\r\n    Plate 12, Fig. 19).\r\n\r\n    1. _Transverse flexures._--The minute furrows starting from the bend\r\n    of the joint, run from one side of the phalanx to the other; at first\r\n    transversely in nearly straight lines, then by degrees they become\r\n    more and more curved towards the middle, until at last they are bent\r\n    into arches that are almost concentric with the circumference of the\r\n    finger.\r\n\r\n    2. _Central Longitudinal Stria._--This configuration is nearly the\r\n    same as in 1, the only difference being that a perpendicular stria is\r\n    enclosed within the transverse furrows, as if it were a nucleus.\r\n\r\n    3. _Oblique Stria._--A solitary line runs from one or other of the two\r\n    sides of the finger, passing obliquely between the transverse curves\r\n    in 1, and ending near the middle.\r\n\r\n    4. _Oblique Sinus._--If this oblique line recurves towards the side\r\n    from which it started, and is accompanied by several others, all\r\n    recurved in the same way, the result is an oblique sinus, more or less\r\n    upright, or horizontal, as the case may be. A junction at its base, of\r\n    minute lines proceeding from either of its sides, forms a triangle.\r\n    This distribution of the furrows, in which an oblique sinus is found,\r\n    is by far the most common, and it may be considered as a special\r\n    characteristic of man; the furrows that are packed in longitudinal\r\n    rows are, on the other hand, peculiar to monkeys. The vertex of the\r\n    oblique sinus is generally inclined towards the radial side of the\r\n    hand, but it must be observed that the contrary is more frequently the\r\n    case in the fore-finger, the vertex there tending towards the ulnar\r\n    side. Scarcely any other configuration is to be found on the toes. The\r\n    ring finger, too, is often marked with one of the more intricate kinds\r\n    of pattern, while the remaining fingers have either the oblique sinus\r\n    or one of the other simpler forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 12.\r\n\r\nFIG. 19. THE STANDARD PATTERNS OF PURKENJE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    5. _Almond._--Here the oblique sinus, as already described, encloses\r\n    an almond-shaped figure, blunt above, pointed below, and formed of\r\n    concentric furrows.\r\n\r\n    6. _Spiral._--When the transverse flexures described in 1 do not pass\r\n    gradually from straight lines into curves, but assume that form\r\n    suddenly with a more rapid divergence, a semicircular space is\r\n    necessarily created, which stands upon the straight and horizontal\r\n    lines below, as it were upon a base. This space is filled by a spiral\r\n    either of a simple or composite form. The term 'simple' spiral is to\r\n    be understood in the usual geometric sense. I call the spiral\r\n    'composite' when it is made up of several lines proceeding from the\r\n    same centre, or of lines branching at intervals and twisted upon\r\n    themselves. At either side, where the spiral is contiguous to the\r\n    place at which the straight and curved lines begin to diverge, in\r\n    order to enclose it, two triangles are formed, just like the single\r\n    one that is formed at the side of the oblique sinus.\r\n\r\n    7. _Ellipse_, or _Elliptical Whorl_.--The semicircular space described\r\n    in 6 is here filled with concentric ellipses enclosing a short single\r\n    line in their middle.\r\n\r\n    8. _Circle_, or _Circular Whorl_.--Here a single point takes the place\r\n    of the short line mentioned in 7. It is surrounded by a number of\r\n    concentric circles reaching to the ridges that bound the semicircular\r\n    space.\r\n\r\n    9. _Double Whorl._--One portion of the transverse lines runs forward\r\n    with a bend and recurves upon itself with a half turn, and is embraced\r\n    by another portion which proceeds from the other side in the same way.\r\n    This produces a doubly twisted figure which is rarely met with except\r\n    on the thumb, fore, and ring fingers. The ends of the curved portions\r\n    may be variously inclined; they may be nearly perpendicular, of\r\n    various degrees of obliquity, or nearly horizontal.\r\n\r\n    In all of the forms 6, 7, 8, and 9, triangles may be seen at the\r\n    points where the divergence begins between the transverse and the\r\n    arched lines, and at both sides. On the remaining phalanges, the\r\n    transverse lines proceed diagonally, and are straight or only slightly\r\n    curved.\"\r\n\r\n(He then proceeds to speak of the palm of the hand in men and in\r\nmonkeys.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nPERSISTENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evidence that the minutiae persist throughout life is derived from the\r\nscrutiny and comparison of various duplicate impressions, one of each pair\r\nhaving been made many years ago, the other recently. Those which I have\r\nstudied more or less exhaustively are derived from the digits of fifteen\r\ndifferent persons. In some cases repeated impressions of one finger only\r\nwere available; in most cases of two fingers; in some of an entire hand.\r\nAltogether the whole or part of repeated impressions of between twenty and\r\nthirty different digits have been studied. I am indebted to Sir W. J.\r\nHerschel for almost all these valuable data, without which it would have\r\nbeen impossible to carry on the inquiry. The only other prints are those\r\nof Sir W. G----, who, from curiosity, took impressions of his own fingers\r\nin sealing-wax in 1874, and fortunately happened to preserve them. He was\r\ngood enough to make others for me last year, from which photographic\r\nprints were made. The following table gives an analysis of the above data.\r\nIt would be well worth while to hunt up and take the present finger\r\nprints of such of the Hindoos as may now be alive, whose impressions were\r\ntaken in India by Sir W. J. Herschel, and are still preserved. Many years\r\nmust elapse before my own large collection of finger prints will be\r\navailable for the purpose of testing persistence during long periods.\r\n\r\nThe pattern in every distinct finger print, even though it be only a\r\ndabbed impression, contains on a rough average thirty-five different\r\npoints of reference, in addition to its general peculiarities of outline\r\nand core. They consist of forkings, beginnings or ends of ridges, islands,\r\nand enclosures. These minute details are by no means peculiar to the\r\npattern itself, but are distributed with almost equal abundance throughout\r\nthe whole palmar surface. In order to make an exhaustive comparison of two\r\nimpressions they ought to be photographically enlarged to a size not\r\nsmaller than those shown in Plate 15. Two negatives of impressions can\r\nthus be taken side by side on an ordinary quarter-plate, and any number of\r\nphotographic prints made from them; but, for still more comfortable\r\nworking, a further enlargement is desirable, say by the prism, p. 52. Some\r\nof the prints may be made on ferro-prussiate paper, as already mentioned\r\npp. 51, 53; they are more convenient by far than prints made by the silver\r\nor by the platinum process.\r\n\r\nHaving placed the enlarged prints side by side, two or three conspicuous\r\nand convenient points of reference, whether islands, enclosures, or\r\nparticularly distinct bifurcations, should be identified and marked. By\r\ntheir help, the position of the prints should be readjusted, so that they\r\nshall be oriented exactly alike. From each point of reference, in\r\nsuccession, the spines of the ridges are then to be followed with a fine\r\npencil, in the two prints alternately, neatly marking each new point of\r\ncomparison with a numeral in coloured ink (Plate 13). When both of the\r\nprints are good and clear, this is rapidly done; wherever the impressions\r\nare faulty, there may be many ambiguities requiring patience to unravel.\r\nAt first I was timid, and proceeded too hesitatingly when one of the\r\nimpressions was indistinct, making short alternate traces. Afterwards on\r\ngaining confidence, I traced boldly, starting from any well-defined point\r\nof reference and not stopping until there were reasonable grounds for\r\nhesitation, and found it easy in this way to trace the unions between\r\nopposite and incompletely printed ends of ridges, and to disentangle many\r\nbad impressions.\r\n\r\nAn exact correspondence between the _details_ of two minutiae is of\r\nsecondary importance. Thus, the commonest point of reference is a\r\nbifurcation; now the neck or point of divergence of a new ridge is apt to\r\nbe a little low, and sometimes fails to take the ink; hence a new ridge\r\nmay appear in one of the prints to have an independent origin, and in the\r\nother to be a branch. The _apparent_ origin is therefore of little\r\nimportance, the main fact to be attended to is that a new ridge comes into\r\nexistence at a particular point; _how_ it came into existence is a\r\nsecondary matter. Similarly, an apparently broken ridge may in reality be\r\ndue to an imperfectly printed enclosure; and an island in one print may\r\nappear as part of an enclosure in the other. Moreover, this variation in\r\ndetails may be the effect not only of imperfect inking or printing, but of\r\ndisintegration due to old age, which renders the impressions of the ridges\r\nragged and broken, as in my own finger prints on the title-page.\r\n\r\nPlate 11, Fig. 18 explains the nature of the apparent discrepancies better\r\nthan a verbal description. In _a_ a new ridge appears to be suddenly\r\nintruded between two adjacent ones, which have separated to make room for\r\nit; but a second print, taken from the same finger, may have the\r\nappearance of either _b_ or _c_, showing that the new ridge is in reality\r\na fork of one or other of them, the low connecting neck having failed to\r\nleave an impression. The second line of examples shows how an enclosure\r\nwhich is clearly defined in _d_ may give rise to the appearance of broken\r\ncontinuity shown in _e_, and how a distinct island _f_ in one of the\r\nprints may be the remnant of an enclosure which is shown in the other.\r\nThese remarks are offered as a caution against attaching undue importance\r\nto disaccord in the details of the minutiae that are found in the same\r\nplace in different prints. Usually, however, the distinction between a\r\nfork and the beginning of a new ridge is clear enough; the islands and\r\nenclosures are also mostly well marked.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 13.\r\n\r\nFIG. 20. V. H. H-D aet. 2-1/2 in 1877, and again as a boy in Nov. 1890.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPlate 13 gives impressions taken from the fingers of a child of 2-1/2\r\nyears in 1877, and again in 1890, when a boy of 15. They are enlarged\r\nphotographically to the same size, and are therefore on different scales.\r\nThe impressions from the baby-hand are not sharp, but sufficiently\r\ndistinct for comparison. Every bifurcation, and beginning or ending of a\r\nridge, common to the two impressions, is marked with a numeral in blue\r\nink. There is only one island in the present instance, and that is in the\r\nupper pair of prints; it is clearly seen in the right hand print, lying to\r\nthe left of the inscribed number 13, but the badness of the left hand\r\nprint makes it hardly decipherable, so it is not numbered. There are a\r\ntotal of twenty-six good points of comparison common to the upper pair of\r\nprints; there are forty-three points in the lower pair, forty-two of which\r\nappear in both, leaving a single point of disagreement; it is marked A on\r\nthe fifth ridge counting from the top. Here a bifurcated ridge in the baby\r\nis filled up in the boy. This one exception, small though it be, is in my\r\nexperience unique. The total result of the two pairs of prints is to\r\nafford sixty-eight successes and one failure. The student will find it\r\nwell worth his while to study these and the following prints step by step,\r\nto satisfy himself of the extraordinarily exact coincidences between the\r\ntwo members of either of the pairs. Of course the patterns generally must\r\nbe the same, if the ridges composing them are exactly alike, and the most\r\ncursory glance shows them to be so.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 14.\r\n\r\nFIG. 21.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPlate 14, Fig. 21 contains rather less than a quarter of each of eight\r\npairs that were published in the _Phil. Trans._ memoir above alluded to.\r\nThey were there enlarged photographically to twice their natural size,\r\nwhich was hardly enough, as it did not allow sufficient space for\r\ninserting the necessary reference numbers. Consequently they have been\r\nagain considerably enlarged, so much so that it is impossible to put more\r\nthan a portion of each on the page. However, what is given suffices. The\r\nomitted portions may be studied in the memoir. The cases of ~1~ and ~2~\r\nare prints of different fingers of the same individual, first as a child 8\r\nyears old, and then as a boy of 17. They have been enlarged on the same\r\nscale but not to the same size; so the print of the child includes a\r\nlarger proportion of the original impression than that of the boy. It is\r\ntherefore only a part of the child's print which is comparable with that\r\nof the boy. The remaining six cases refer to four different men, belonging\r\nto three quite different families, although their surnames happen to have\r\nthe same initial, H. They were adults when the first print was made, and\r\nfrom 26 to 31 years older on the second occasion. There is an exact\r\nagreement throughout between the two members of each of the eight several\r\ncouplets.\r\n\r\nIn the pair 2. A. E. H. Hl., there is an interesting dot at the point ~4~\r\n(being an island it deserved to have had two numbers, one for the\r\nbeginning and one for the end).

It is the right\r\nfore-finger of Sir W. Herschel and has been already published twice; first\r\nin the account of my lecture at the Royal Institution, and secondly, in\r\nits present conspicuous form, in my paper in the _Nineteenth Century_. The\r\nnumber of years that elapsed between the two impressions is thirty-one,\r\nand the prints contain twenty-four points of comparison, all of which will\r\nbe seen to agree. I also possess a later print than this, taken in 1890\r\nfrom the same finger, which tells the same tale.\r\n\r\nThe final result of the prints in these pages is that they give\r\nphotographic enlargements of the whole or portions of eleven couplets\r\nbelonging to six different persons, who are members of five unrelated\r\nfamilies, and which contain between them 158 points of comparison, of\r\nwhich only one failed. Adding the portions of the prints that are omitted\r\nhere, but which will be found in the _Phil. Trans._, the material that I\r\nhave thus far published contains 389 points of comparison, of which one\r\nfailed.

There were no less than one\r\nhundred and eleven of them in the ball of the thumb of the child V. H.\r\nHd., besides twenty-five in the imperfect prints of his middle and little\r\nfingers; these alone raise the total of 389 to 525. I must on the whole\r\nhave looked for more than 700 points of comparison, and have found\r\nagreement in every single case that was examined, except the one already\r\nmentioned in Fig. 20, of a ridge that was split in the child, but had\r\nclosed up some few years later.\r\n\r\nThe prints in the two plates cover the intervals from childhood to\r\nboyhood, from boyhood to early manhood, from manhood to about the age of\r\n60, and another set--that of Sir W. G.--covers the interval from 67 to 80.\r\nThis is clearly expressed by the diagram (Plate 15, Fig. 23). As there is\r\nno sign, except in one case, of change during any one of these four\r\nintervals, which together almost wholly cover the ordinary life of man, we\r\nare justified in inferring that between birth and death there is\r\nabsolutely no change in, say, 699 out of 700 of the numerous\r\ncharacteristics in the markings of the fingers of the same person, such as\r\ncan be impressed by them whenever it is desirable to do so. Neither can\r\nthere be any change after death, up to the time when the skin perishes\r\nthrough decomposition; for example, the marks on the fingers of many\r\nEgyptian mummies, and on the paws of stuffed monkeys, still remain\r\nlegible. Very good evidence and careful inquiry is thus seen to justify\r\nthe popular idea of the persistence of finger markings, that has hitherto\r\nbeen too rashly jumped at, and which wrongly ascribed the persistence to\r\nthe general appearance of the pattern, rather than to the minutiae it\r\ncontains. There appear to be no external bodily characteristics, other\r\nthan deep scars and tattoo marks, comparable in their persistence to these\r\nmarkings, whether they be on the finger, on other parts of the palmar\r\nsurface of the hand, or on the sole of the foot. At the same time they are\r\nout of all proportion more numerous than any other measurable features;\r\nabout thirty-five of them are situated on the bulb of each of the ten\r\ndigits, in addition to more than 100 on the ball of the thumb, which has\r\nnot one-fifth of the superficies of the rest of the palmar surface. The\r\ntotal number of points suitable for comparison on the two hands must\r\ntherefore be not less than one thousand and nearer to two; an estimate\r\nwhich I verified by a rough count on my own hand; similarly in respect to\r\nthe feet. The dimensions of the limbs and body alter in the course of\r\ngrowth and decay; the colour, quantity, and quality of the hair, the tint\r\nand quality of the skin, the number and set of the teeth, the expression\r\nof the features, the gestures, the handwriting, even the eye-colour,\r\nchange after many years. There seems no persistence in the visible parts\r\nof the body, except in these minute and hitherto too much disregarded\r\nridges.\r\n\r\nIt must be emphasised that it is in the minutiae, and _not_ in the measured\r\ndimensions of any portion of the pattern, that this remarkable persistence\r\nis observed, not even if the measurements be made in units of a\r\nridge-interval. The pattern grows simultaneously with the finger, and its\r\nproportions vary with its fatness, leanness, usage, gouty deformation, or\r\nage. But, though the pattern as a whole may become considerably altered in\r\nlength or breadth, the number of ridges, their embranchments, and other\r\nminutiae remain unchanged. So it is with the pattern on a piece of lace.\r\nThe piece as a whole may be stretched in this way, or shrunk in that, and\r\nits outline altogether altered; nevertheless every one of the component\r\nthreads, and every knot in every thread, can easily be traced and\r\nidentified in both. Therefore, in speaking of the persistence of the marks\r\non the finger, the phrase must be taken to apply principally to the\r\nminutiae, and to the general character of the pattern; not to the measure\r\nof its length, breadth, or other diameter; these being no more constant\r\nthan the stature, or any other of the ordinary anthropometric data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nEVIDENTIAL VALUE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of this chapter is to give an approximate numerical idea of the\r\nvalue of finger prints as a means of Personal Identification. Though the\r\nestimates that will be made are professedly and obviously far below the\r\ntruth, they are amply sufficient to prove that the evidence afforded by\r\nfinger prints may be trusted in a most remarkable degree.\r\n\r\nOur problem is this: given two finger prints, which are alike in their\r\nminutiae, what is the chance that they were made by different persons?\r\n\r\nThe first attempt at comparing two finger prints would be directed to a\r\nrough general examination of their respective patterns. If they do not\r\nagree in being arches, loops, or whorls, there can be no doubt that the\r\nprints are those of different fingers, neither can there be doubt when\r\nthey are distinct forms of the same general class. But to agree thus far\r\ngoes only a short way towards establishing identity, for the number of\r\npatterns that are promptly distinguishable from one another is not large.\r\nMy earlier inquiries showed this, when endeavouring to sort the prints of\r\n1000 thumbs into groups that differed each from the rest by an \"equally\r\ndiscernible\" interval. While the attempt, as already mentioned, was not\r\nsuccessful in its main object, it showed that nearly all the collection\r\ncould be sorted into 100 groups, in each of which the prints had a fairly\r\nnear resemblance. Moreover, twelve or fifteen of the groups referred to\r\ndifferent varieties of the loop; and as two-thirds of all the prints are\r\nloops, two-thirds of the 1000 specimens fell into twelve or fifteen\r\ngroups. The chance that an unseen pattern is some particular variety of\r\nloop, is therefore compounded of 2 to 3 against its being a loop at all,\r\nand of 1 to 12 or 15, as the case may be, against its being the specified\r\nkind of loop. This makes an adverse chance of only 2 to 36, or to 45, say\r\nas 2 to 40, or as 1 to 20. This very rude calculation suffices to show\r\nthat on the average, no great reliance can be placed on a general\r\nresemblance in the appearance of two finger prints, as a proof that they\r\nwere made by the same finger, though the obvious disagreement of two\r\nprints is conclusive evidence that they were made by different fingers.\r\n\r\nWhen we proceed to a much more careful comparison, and collate\r\nsuccessively the numerous minutiae, their coincidence throughout would be\r\nan evidence of identity, whose value we will now try to appraise.\r\n\r\nLet us first consider the question, how far may the minutiae, or groups of\r\nthem, be treated as _independent_ variables?\r\n\r\nSuppose that a tiny square of paper of only one average ridge-interval in\r\nthe side, be cut out and dropped at random on a finger print; it will\r\nmask from view a minute portion of one, or possibly of two ridges. There\r\ncan be little doubt that what was hidden could be correctly interpolated\r\nby simply joining the ends of the ridge or ridges that were interrupted.\r\nIt is true, the paper might possibly have fallen exactly upon, and hidden,\r\na minute island or enclosure, and that our reconstruction would have\r\nfailed in consequence, but such an accident is improbable in a high\r\ndegree, and may be almost ignored.\r\n\r\nRepeating the process with a much larger square of paper, say of twelve\r\nridge-intervals in the side, the improbability of correctly reconstructing\r\nthe masked portion will have immensely increased. The number of ridges\r\nthat enter the square on any one side will perhaps, as often as not,\r\ndiffer from the number which emerge from the opposite side; and when they\r\nare the same, it does not at all follow that they would be continuous each\r\nto each, for in so large a space forks and junctions are sure to occur\r\nbetween some, and it is impossible to know which, of the ridges.\r\nConsequently, there must exist a certain size of square with more than one\r\nand less than twelve ridge-intervals in the side, which will mask so much\r\nof the print, that it will be an even chance whether the hidden portion\r\ncan, on the average, be rightly reconstructed or not. The size of that\r\nsquare must now be considered.\r\n\r\nIf the reader will refer to Plate 14, in which there are eight much\r\nenlarged photographs of portions of different finger prints, he will\r\nobserve that the length of each of the portions exceeds the breadth in\r\nthe proportion of 3 to 2. Consequently, by drawing one line down the\r\nmiddle and two lines across, each portion may be divided into six squares.\r\nMoreover, it will be noticed that the side of each of these squares has a\r\nlength of about six ridge-intervals. I cut out squares of paper of this\r\nsize, and throwing one of them at random on any one of the eight portions,\r\nsucceeded almost as frequently as not in drawing lines on its back which\r\ncomparison afterwards showed to have followed the true course of the\r\nridges. The provisional estimate that a length of six ridge-intervals\r\napproximated to but exceeded that of the side of the desired square,\r\nproved to be correct by the following more exact observations, and by\r\nthree different methods.\r\n\r\nI. The first set of tests to verify this estimate were made upon\r\nphotographic enlargements of various thumb prints, to double their natural\r\nsize. A six-ridge-interval square of paper was damped and laid at random\r\non the print, the core of the pattern, which was too complex in many cases\r\nto serve as an average test, being alone avoided. The prints being on\r\nordinary albuminised paper, which is slightly adherent when moistened, the\r\npatch stuck temporarily wherever it was placed and pressed down. Next, a\r\nsheet of tracing-paper, which we will call No. 1, was laid over all, and\r\nthe margin of the square patch was traced upon it, together with the\r\ncourse of the surrounding ridges up to that margin. Then I interpolated on\r\nthe tracing-paper what seemed to be the most likely course of those ridges\r\nwhich were hidden by the square. No. 1 was then removed, and a second\r\nsheet, No. 2, was laid on, and the margin of the patch was outlined on it\r\nas before, together with the ridges leading up to it. Next, a corner only\r\nof No. 2 was raised, the square patch was whisked away from underneath,\r\nthe corner was replaced, the sheet was flattened down, and the actual\r\ncourses of the ridges within the already marked outline were traced in.\r\nThus there were two tracings of the margin of the square, of which No. 1\r\ncontained the ridges as I had interpolated them, No. 2 as they really\r\nwere, and it was easy to compare the two. The results are given in the\r\nfirst column of the following table:--\r\n\r\nINTERPOLATION OF RIDGES IN A SIX-RIDGE-INTERVAL SQUARE.\r\n\r\n  +---------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |Result.|   Double    |Six-fold scale| Twenty-fold |Total.|\r\n  |       |Enlargements.| with prism.  |  scale with |      |\r\n  |       |             |              |chequer-work.|      |\r\n  |-------|-------------|--------------|-------------|------|\r\n  |Right  |     12      |      8       |      7      |  27  |\r\n  |Wrong  |     20      |     12       |     16      |  48  |\r\n  |-------|-------------|--------------|-------------|------|\r\n  |Total  |     32      |     20       |     23      |  75  |\r\n  +---------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nII. In the second method the tracing-papers were discarded, and the prism\r\nof a camera lucida used. It threw an image three times the size of the\r\nphoto-enlargement, upon a card, and there it was traced. The same general\r\nprinciple was adopted as in the first method, but the results being on a\r\nlarger scale, and drawn on stout paper, were more satisfactory and\r\nconvenient. They are given in the second column of the table. In this and\r\nthe foregoing methods two different portions of the same print were\r\nsometimes dealt with, for it was a little more convenient and seemed as\r\ngood a way of obtaining average results as that of always using portions\r\nof different finger prints. The total number of fifty-two trials, by one\r\nor other of the two methods, were made from about forty different prints.\r\n(I am not sure of the exact number.)\r\n\r\nThe results in each of the two methods were sometimes quite right,\r\nsometimes quite wrong, sometimes neither one nor the other. The latter\r\ndepended on the individual judgment as to which class it belonged, and\r\nmight be battled over with more or less show of reason by advocates on\r\nopposite sides. Equally dividing these intermediate cases between \"right\"\r\nand \"wrong,\" the results were obtained as shown. In one, and only one, of\r\nthe cases, the most reasonable interpretation had not been given, and the\r\nresult had been wrong when it ought to have been right. The purely\r\npersonal error was therefore disregarded, and the result entered as\r\n\"right.\"\r\n\r\nIII. A third attempt was made by a different method, upon the lineations\r\nof a finger print drawn on about a twenty-fold scale. It had first been\r\nenlarged four times by photography, and from this enlargement the axes of\r\nthe ridges had been drawn with a five-fold enlarging pantagraph. The aim\r\nnow was to reconstruct the entire finger print by two successive and\r\nindependent acts of interpolation. A sheet of transparent tracing-paper\r\nwas ruled into six-ridge-interval squares, and every one of its alternate\r\nsquares was rendered opaque by pasting white paper upon it, giving it the\r\nappearance of a chess-board. When this chequer-work was laid on the print,\r\nexactly one half of the six-ridge squares were masked by the opaque\r\nsquares, while the ridges running up to them could be seen. They were not\r\nquite so visible as if each opaque square had been wholly detached from\r\nits neighbours, instead of touching them at the extreme corners, still the\r\nloss of information thereby occasioned was small, and not worth laying\r\nstress upon. It is easily understood that when the chequer-work was moved\r\nparallel to itself, through the space of one square, whether upwards or\r\ndownwards, or to the right or left, the parts that were previously masked\r\nbecame visible, and those that were visible became masked. The object was\r\nto interpolate the ridges in every opaque square under one of these\r\nconditions, then to do the same for the remaining squares under the other\r\ncondition, and finally, by combining the results, to obtain a complete\r\nscheme of the ridges wholly by interpolation. This was easily done by\r\nusing two sheets of tracing-paper, laid in succession over the\r\nchequer-work, whose position on the print had been changed meanwhile, and\r\nafterwards tracing the lineations that were drawn on one of the two sheets\r\nupon the vacant squares of the other. The results are given in the third\r\ncolumn of the table.\r\n\r\nThe three methods give roughly similar results, and we may therefore\r\naccept the ratios of their totals, which is 27 to 75, or say 1 to 3, as\r\nrepresenting the chance that the reconstruction of any six-ridge-interval\r\nsquare would be correct under the given conditions. On reckoning the\r\nchance as 1 to 2, which will be done at first, it is obvious that the\r\nerror, whatever it may be, is on the safe side. A closer equality in the\r\nchance that the ridges in a square might run in the observed way or in\r\nsome other way, would result from taking a square of five ridge-intervals\r\nin the side. I believe this to be very closely the right size. A\r\nfour-ridge-interval square is certainly too small.\r\n\r\nWhen the reconstructed squares were wrong, they had none the less a\r\nnatural appearance. This was especially seen, and on a large scale, in the\r\nresult of the method by chequer-work, in which the lineations of an entire\r\nprint were constructed by guess. Being so familiar with the run of these\r\nridges in finger prints, I can speak with confidence on this. My\r\nassumption is, that any one of these reconstructions represents lineations\r\nthat might have occurred in Nature, in association with the conditions\r\noutside the square, just as well as the lineations of the actual finger\r\nprint. The courses of the ridges in each square are subject to\r\nuncertainties, due to petty _local_ incidents, to which the conditions\r\noutside the square give no sure indication. They appear to be in great\r\npart determined by the particular disposition of each one or more of the\r\nhalf hundred or so sweat-glands which the square contains. The ridges\r\nrarely run in evenly flowing lines, but may be compared to footways across\r\na broken country, which, while they follow a general direction, are\r\ncontinually deflected by such trifles as a tuft of grass, a stone, or a\r\npuddle. Even if the number of ridges emerging from a six-ridge-interval\r\nsquare equals the number of those which enter, it does not follow that\r\nthey run across in parallel lines, for there is plenty of room for any one\r\nof the ridges to end, and another to bifurcate. It is impossible,\r\ntherefore, to know beforehand in which, if in any of the ridges, these\r\npeculiarities will be found. When the number of entering and issuing\r\nridges is unequal, the difficulty is increased. There may, moreover, be\r\nislands or enclosures in any particular part of the square. It therefore\r\nseems right to look upon the squares as independent variables, in the\r\nsense that when the surrounding conditions are alone taken into account,\r\nthe ridges within their limits may either run in the observed way or in a\r\ndifferent way, the chance of these two contrasted events being taken (for\r\nsafety's sake) as approximately equal.\r\n\r\nIn comparing finger prints which are alike in their general pattern, it\r\nmay well happen that the proportions of the patterns differ; one may be\r\nthat of a slender boy, the other that of a man whose fingers have been\r\nbroadened or deformed by ill-usage. It is therefore requisite to imagine\r\nthat only one of the prints is divided into exact squares, and to suppose\r\nthat a reticulation has been drawn over the other, in which each mesh\r\nincluded the corresponding parts of the former print. Frequent trials have\r\nshown that there is no practical difficulty in actually doing this, and\r\nit is the only way of making a fair comparison between the two.\r\n\r\nThese six-ridge-interval squares may thus be regarded as independent\r\nunits, each of which is equally liable to fall into one or other of two\r\nalternative classes, when the surrounding conditions are alone known. The\r\ninevitable consequence from this datum is that the chance of an exact\r\ncorrespondence between two different finger prints, in each of the\r\nsix-ridge-interval squares into which they may be divided, and which are\r\nabout 24 in number, is at least as 1 to 2 multiplied into itself 24 times\r\n(usually written 2{24}), that is as 1 to about ten thousand millions. But\r\nwe must not forget that the six-ridge square was taken in order to ensure\r\nunder-estimation, a five-ridge square would have been preferable, so the\r\nadverse chances would in reality be enormously greater still.\r\n\r\nIt is hateful to blunder in calculations of adverse chances, by\r\noverlooking correlations between variables, and to falsely assume them\r\nindependent, with the result that inflated estimates are made which\r\nrequire to be proportionately reduced. Here, however, there seems to be\r\nlittle room for such an error.\r\n\r\nWe must next combine the above enormously unfavourable chance, which we\r\nwill call _a_, with the other chances of not guessing correctly beforehand\r\nthe surrounding conditions under which _a_ was calculated. These latter\r\nare divisible into _b_ and _c_; the chance _b_ is that of not guessing\r\ncorrectly the general course of the ridges adjacent to each square, and\r\n_c_ that of not guessing rightly the number of ridges that enter and\r\nissue from the square. The chance _b_ has already been discussed, with the\r\nresult that it might be taken as 1 to 20 for two-thirds of all the\r\npatterns. It would be higher for the remainder, and very high indeed for\r\nsome few of them, but as it is advisable always to underestimate, it may\r\nbe taken as 1 to 20; or, to obtain the convenience of dealing only with\r\nvalues of 2 multiplied into itself, the still lower ratio of 1 to 2{4},\r\nthat is as 1 to 16. As to the remaining chance _c_ with which _a_ and _b_\r\nhave to be compounded, namely, that of guessing aright the number of\r\nridges that enter and leave each side of a particular square, I can offer\r\nno careful observations. The number of the ridges would for the most part\r\nvary between five and seven, and those in the different squares are\r\ncertainly not quite independent of one another. We have already arrived at\r\nsuch large figures that it is surplusage to heap up more of them,\r\ntherefore, let us say, as a mere nominal sum much below the real figure,\r\nthat the chance against guessing each and every one of these data\r\ncorrectly is as 1 to 250, or say 1 to 2{8} (= 256).\r\n\r\nThe result is, that the chance of lineations, constructed by the\r\nimagination according to strictly natural forms, which shall be found to\r\nresemble those of a single finger print in all their minutiae, is less than\r\n1 to 2{24} x 2{4} x 2{8}, or 1 to 2{36}, or 1 to about sixty-four thousand\r\nmillions. The inference is, that as the number of the human race is\r\nreckoned at about sixteen thousand millions, it is a smaller chance than 1\r\nto 4 that the print of a _single_ finger of any given person would be\r\nexactly like that of the same finger of any other member of the human\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nWhen two fingers of each of the two persons are compared, and found to\r\nhave the same minutiae, the improbability of 1 to 2{36} becomes squared,\r\nand reaches a figure altogether beyond the range of the imagination; when\r\nthree fingers, it is cubed, and so on.\r\n\r\nA single instance has shown that the minutiae are _not_ invariably\r\npermanent throughout life, but that one or more of them may possibly\r\nchange. They may also be destroyed by wounds, and more or less\r\ndisintegrated by hard work, disease, or age. Ambiguities will thus arise\r\nin their interpretation, one person asserting a resemblance in respect to\r\na particular feature, while another asserts dissimilarity. It is therefore\r\nof interest to know how far a conceded resemblance in the great majority\r\nof the minutiae combined with some doubt as to the remainder, will tell in\r\nfavour of identity. It will now be convenient to change our datum from a\r\nsix-ridge to a five-ridge square of which about thirty-five are contained\r\nin a single print, 35 x 5{2} or 35 x 25 being much the same as 24 x 6{2}\r\nor 24 x 36. The reason for the change is that this number of thirty-five\r\nhappens to be the same as that of the minutiae. We shall therefore not be\r\nacting unfairly if, with reservation, and for the sake of obtaining some\r\nresult, however rough, we consider the thirty-five minutiae themselves as\r\nso many independent variables, and accept the chance now as 1 to 2{35}.\r\n\r\nThis has to be multiplied, as before, into the factor of 2{4} x 2{8}\r\n(which may still be considered appropriate, though it is too small),\r\nmaking the total of adverse chances 1 to 2{47}. Upon such a basis, the\r\ncalculation is simple. There would on the average be 47 instances, out of\r\nthe total 2{47} combinations, of similarity in all but one particular; (47\r\nx 46)/(1 x 2) in all but two; (47 x 46 x 45)/(1 x 2 x 3) in all but three,\r\nand so on according to the well-known binomial expansion. Taking for\r\nconvenience the powers of 2 to which these values approximate, or rather\r\nwith the view of not overestimating, let us take the power of 2 that falls\r\nshort of each of them; these may be reckoned as respectively equal to\r\n2{6}, 2{10}, 2{14}, 2{18}, etc. Hence the roughly approximate chances of\r\nresemblance in all particulars are as 2{47} to 1; in all particulars but\r\none, as 2{47-6}, or 2{41} to 1; in all but two, as 2{37} to 1; in all but\r\nthree, as 2{33} to 1; in all but four, as 2{29} to 1. Even 2{29} is so\r\nlarge as to require a row of nine figures to express it. Hence a few\r\ninstances of dissimilarity in the two prints of a single finger, still\r\nleave untouched an enormously large residue of evidence in favour of\r\nidentity, and when two, three, or more fingers in the two persons agree to\r\nthat extent, the strength of the evidence rises by squares, cubes, etc.,\r\nfar above the level of that amount of probability which begins to rank as\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\nWhatever reductions a legitimate criticism may make in the numerical\r\nresults arrived at in this chapter, bearing in mind the occasional\r\nambiguities pictured in Fig. 18, the broad fact remains, that a complete\r\nor nearly complete accordance between two prints of a single finger, and\r\nvastly more so between the prints of two or more fingers, affords\r\nevidence requiring no corroboration, that the persons from whom they were\r\nmade are the same. Let it also be remembered, that this evidence is\r\napplicable not only to adults, but can establish the identity of the same\r\nperson at any stage of his life between babyhood and old age, and for some\r\ntime after his death.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe read of the dead body of Jezebel being devoured by the dogs of Jezreel,\r\nso that no man might say, \"This is Jezebel,\" and that the dogs left only\r\nher skull, the palms of her hands, and the soles of her feet; but the\r\npalms of the hands and the soles of the feet are the very remains by which\r\na corpse might be most surely identified, if impressions of them, made\r\nduring life, were available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nPECULIARITIES OF THE DIGITS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe data used in this chapter are the prints of 5000 different digits,\r\nnamely, the ten digits of 500 different persons; each digit can thus be\r\ntreated, both separately and in combination, in 500 cases. Five hundred\r\ncannot be called a large number, but it suffices for approximate results;\r\nthe percentages that it yields may, for instance, be expected to be\r\ntrustworthy, more often than not, within two units.\r\n\r\nWhen preparing the tables for this chapter, I gave a more liberal\r\ninterpretation to the word \"Arch\" than subsequently. At first, every\r\npattern between a Forked-Arch and a Nascent-Loop (Plate 7) was rated as an\r\nArch; afterwards they were rated as Loops.\r\n\r\nThe relative frequency of the three several classes in the 5000 digits was\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n  Arches                     6.5 per cent.\r\n  Loops                     67.5    \"\r\n  Whorls                    26.0    \"\r\n                           ------\r\n               Total       100.0\r\n\r\nFrom this it appears, that on the average out of every 15 or 16 digits,\r\none has an arch; out of every 3 digits, two have loops; out of every 4\r\ndigits, one has a whorl.\r\n\r\nThis coarse statistical treatment leaves an inadequate impression, each\r\ndigit and each hand having its own peculiarity, as we shall see in the\r\nfollowing table:--\r\n\r\nTABLE I.\r\n\r\n_Percentage frequency of Arches, Loops, and Whorls on the different\r\ndigits, from observations of the 5000 digits of 500 persons._\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |           |      RIGHT HAND.        ||        LEFT HAND.        |\r\n  |  Digit.   |-----------------------------------------------------|\r\n  |           |Arch.|Loop.|Whorl.|Total.||Arch.|Loop.| Whorl.|Total.|\r\n  |-----------+-----------------------------------------------------|\r\n  |Thumb      |  3  | 53  |  44  | 100  ||  5  | 65  |  30   | 100  |\r\n  |Fore-finger| 17  | 53  |  30  | 100  || 17  | 55  |  28   | 100  |\r\n  |Middle do. |  7  | 78  |  15  | 100  ||  8  | 76  |  16   | 100  |\r\n  |Ring   do. |  2  | 53  |  45  | 100  ||  3  | 66  |  31   | 100  |\r\n  |Little do. |  1  | 86  |  13  | 100  ||  2  | 90  |   8   | 100  |\r\n  |-----------+-----+-----+------+------||-----+-----+-------+------|\r\n  |   Total   | 30  |323  | 147  | 500  || 35  |352  | 113   | 500  |\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThe percentage of arches on the various digits varies from 1 to 17; of\r\nloops, from 53 to 90; of whorls, from 13 to 45, consequently the\r\nstatistics of the digits must be separated, and not massed\r\nindiscriminately.\r\n\r\nAre the A. L. W. patterns distributed in the same way upon the\r\ncorresponding digits of the two hands? The answer from the last table is\r\ndistinct and curious, and will be best appreciated on rearranging the\r\nentries as follows:--\r\n\r\nTABLE II.\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |            |     ARCHES.    ||     LOOPS.     ||     WHORLS.    |\r\n  |   Digit.   |----------------||----------------||----------------|\r\n  |            | Right. | Left. || Right. | Left. || Right. | Left. |\r\n  |------------|--------|-------||--------|-------||----------------|\r\n  | Fore-finger|   17   |   17  ||   53   |   53  ||   30   |   28  |\r\n  | Middle do. |    7   |    8  ||   78   |   76  ||   15   |   16  |\r\n  | Little do. |    1   |    2  ||   86   |   90  ||   13   |    8  |\r\n  |            |        |       ||        |       ||        |       |\r\n  | Thumb      |    3   |    5  ||   53   |   65  ||   44   |   30  |\r\n  | Ring   do. |    2   |    3  ||   53   |   66  ||   45   |   31  |\r\n  |------------|--------|-------||--------|-------||----------------|\r\n  | Total 1000 |   30   |   35  ||  323   |  350  ||  147   |  113  |\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThe digits are seen to fall into two well-marked groups; the one including\r\nthe fore, middle, and little fingers, the other including the thumb and\r\nring-finger. As regards the first group, the frequency with which any\r\npattern occurs in any named digit is statistically the same, whether that\r\ndigit be on the right or on the left hand; as regards the second group,\r\nthe frequency differs greatly in the two hands. But though in the first\r\ngroup the two fore-fingers, the two middle, and the two little fingers of\r\nthe right hand are severally circumstanced alike in the frequency with\r\nwhich their various patterns occur, the difference between the frequency\r\nof the patterns on a fore, a middle, and a little finger, respectively, is\r\nvery great.\r\n\r\nIn the second group, though the thumbs on opposite hands do not resemble\r\neach other in the statistical frequency of the A. L. W. patterns, nor do\r\nthe ring-fingers, there is a great resemblance between the respective\r\nfrequencies in the thumbs and ring-fingers; for instance, the Whorls on\r\neither of these fingers on the left hand are only two-thirds as common as\r\nthose on the right. The figures in each line and in each column are\r\nconsistent throughout in expressing these curious differences, which must\r\ntherefore be accepted as facts, and not as statistical accidents, whatever\r\nmay be their explanation.\r\n\r\nOne of the most noticeable peculiarities in Table I. is the much greater\r\nfrequency of Arches on the fore-fingers than on any other of the four\r\ndigits. It amounts to 17 per cent on the fore-fingers, while on the thumbs\r\nand on the remaining fingers the frequency diminishes (Table III.) in a\r\nratio that roughly accords with the distance of each digit from the\r\nfore-finger.\r\n\r\nTABLE III.\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------+\r\n  |      _Percentage frequency of Arches._     |\r\n  |--------------------------------------------|\r\n  |Hand.|Thumb.| Fore- |Middle | Ring- |Little |\r\n  |     |      |finger.|finger.|finger.|finger.|\r\n  |-----|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\r\n  |Right|  3   |  17   |   7   |   2   |   1   |\r\n  |Left |  5   |  17   |   8   |   3   |   4   |\r\n  |-----|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\r\n  |Mean |  4   |  17   |  7.5  |  2.5  |  2.5  |\r\n  +--------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThe frequency of Loops (Table IV.) has two maxima; the principal one is on\r\nthe little finger, the secondary on the middle finger.\r\n\r\nTABLE IV.\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------+\r\n  |       _Percentage frequency of Loops._     |\r\n  |--------------------------------------------|\r\n  |Hand.|Thumb.|Fore-  |Middle |Ring-  |Little |\r\n  |     |      |finger.|finger.|finger.|finger.|\r\n  |-----|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\r\n  |Right|  53  |   53  |   78  |   66  |   86  |\r\n  |Left |  65  |   55  |   76  |   53  |   90  |\r\n  |-----|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\r\n  |Mean |  59  |   54  |   77  |  59.5 |   88  |\r\n  +--------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nWhorls (Table V.) are most common on the thumb and the ring-finger, most\r\nrare on the middle and little fingers.\r\n\r\nTABLE V.\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------+\r\n  |     _Percentage frequency of Whorls._      |\r\n  |--------------------------------------------|\r\n  |Hand.|Thumb.|Fore-  |Middle |Ring-  |Little |\r\n  |     |      |finger.|finger.|finger.|finger.|\r\n  |-----|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\r\n  |Right|  44  |   30  |   15  |  45   |  13   |\r\n  |Left |  30  |   28  |   16  |  31   |   8   |\r\n  |-----|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\r\n  |Mean |  37  |   29  |  15.5 |  38   | 10.5  |\r\n  +--------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThe fore-finger is peculiar in the frequency with which the direction of\r\nthe slopes of its loops differs from that which is by far the most common\r\nin all other digits. A loop _must_ have a slope, being caused by the\r\ndisposition of the ridges into the form of a pocket, opening downwards to\r\none or other side of the finger. If it opens towards the inner or thumb\r\nside of the hand, it will be called an inner slope; if towards the outer\r\nor little-finger side, it will be called an outer slope. In all digits,\r\nexcept the fore-fingers, the inner slope is much the more rare of the two;\r\nbut in the fore-fingers the inner slope appears two-thirds as frequently\r\nas the outer slope. Out of the percentage of 53 loops of the one or other\r\nkind on the right fore-finger, 21 of them have an inner and 32 an outer\r\nslope; out of the percentage of 55 loops on the left fore-finger, 21 have\r\ninner and 34 have outer slopes. These subdivisions 21-21 and 32-34\r\ncorroborate the strong statistical similarity that was observed to exist\r\nbetween the frequency of the several patterns on the right and left\r\nfore-fingers; a condition which was also found to characterise the middle\r\nand little fingers.\r\n\r\nIt is strange that Purkenje considers the \"inner\" slope on the fore-finger\r\nto be more frequent than the \"outer\" (p. 86, ~4~). My nomenclature differs\r\nfrom his, but there is no doubt as to the disagreement in meaning. The\r\nfacts to be adduced hereafter make it most improbable that the persons\r\nobserved were racially unlike in this particular.\r\n\r\nThe tendencies of digits to resemble one another will now be considered in\r\ntheir various combinations. They will be taken two at a time, in order to\r\nlearn the frequency with which both members of the various couplets are\r\naffected by the same A. L. W. class of pattern. Every combination will be\r\ndiscussed, except those into which the little finger enters. These are\r\nomitted, because the overwhelming frequency of loops in the little fingers\r\nwould make the results of comparatively little interest, while their\r\ninsertion would greatly increase the size of the table.\r\n\r\nTABLE VI_a_.\r\n\r\n_Percentage of cases in which the same class of pattern occurs in the_\r\nsame digits _of the two hands_.\r\n\r\n(From observation of 5000 digits of 500 persons.)\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------+\r\n  | Couplets of Digits.  |Arches.|Loops.|Whorls.|Total.|\r\n  |----------------------|-------|------|-------|------|\r\n  |The two thumbs        |   2   |  48  |  24   |  74  |\r\n  |   \"    fore-fingers  |   9   |  38  |  20   |  67  |\r\n  |   \"    middle fingers|   3   |  65  |   9   |  77  |\r\n  |   \"    ring-fingers  |   2   |  46  |  26   |  74  |\r\n  |----------------------------------------------------|\r\n  |        Mean of the Totals                      72  |\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nTABLE VI_b_.\r\n\r\n_Percentage of cases in which the same class of pattern occurs in various\r\ncouplets of_ different digits.\r\n\r\n(From 500 persons as above.)\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |  Couplets of |      OF SAME HANDS.       ||    OF OPPOSITE HANDS.     |\r\n  |   Digits.    |---------------------------||---------------------------|\r\n  |              |Arch.|Loops.|Whorls.|Total.||Arch.|Loops.|Whorls.|Total.|\r\n  |--------------|-----|------|-------|------||-----|------|-------|------|\r\n  |Thumb and     |     |      |       |      ||     |      |       |      |\r\n  | fore-finger  |  2  |  35  |  16   |  53  ||  2  |  33  |  15   | 50   |\r\n  |Thumb and     |     |      |       |      ||     |      |       |      |\r\n  | middle finger|  1  |  48  |   9   |  58  ||  1  |  47  |   8   | 56   |\r\n  |Thumb and     |     |      |       |      ||     |      |       |      |\r\n  | ring-finger  |  1  |  40  |  20   |  61  ||  1  |  38  |  18   | 57   |\r\n  |Fore and      |     |      |       |      ||     |      |       |      |\r\n  | middle finger|  5  |  48  |  12   |  65  ||  5  |  46  |  11   | 62   |\r\n  |Fore and      |     |      |       |      ||     |      |       |      |\r\n  | ring-finger  |  2  |  35  |  17   |  54  ||  2  |  35  |  17   | 54   |\r\n  |Middle and    |     |      |       |      ||     |      |       |      |\r\n  | ring-finger  |  2  |  50  |  13   |  65  ||  2  |  50  |  12   | 64   |\r\n  |-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n  |          Means of the Totals         59  ||                      57   |\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nA striking feature in this last table is the close similarity between\r\ncorresponding entries relating to the same and to the opposite hands.\r\nThere are eighteen sets to be compared; namely, six couplets of different\r\nnames, in each of which the frequency of three different classes of\r\npatterns is discussed.

Though the unanimity of the\r\nresults is wonderful, they are fairly arrived at, and leave no doubt that\r\nthe relationship of any one particular digit, whether thumb, fore, middle,\r\nring or little finger, to any other particular digit, is the same, whether\r\nthe two digits are on the same or on opposite hands. It would be a most\r\ninteresting subject of statistical inquiry to ascertain whether the\r\ndistribution of malformations, or of the various forms of skin disease\r\namong the digits, corroborates this unexpected and remarkable result. I am\r\nsorry to have no means of undertaking it, being assured on good authority\r\nthat no adequate collection of the necessary data has yet been published.\r\n\r\nIt might be hastily inferred from the statistical identity of the\r\nconnection between, say, the right thumb and each of the two fore-fingers,\r\nthat the patterns on the two fore-fingers ought always to be alike,\r\nwhether arch, loop, or whorl. If X, it may be said, is identical both with\r\nY and with Z, then Y and Z must be identical with one another. But the\r\nstatement of the problem is wrong; X is not identical with Y and Z, but\r\nonly bears an identical amount of statistical resemblance to each of them;\r\nso this reasoning is inadmissible. The character of the pattern on any\r\ndigit is determined by causes of whose precise nature we are ignorant; but\r\nwe may rest assured that they are numerous and variable, and that their\r\nvariations are in large part independent of one another. We can in\r\nimagination divide them into groups, calling those that are common to the\r\nthumb and the fore-finger of either hand, and to those couplets\r\nexclusively, the A causes; those that are common to the two thumbs and to\r\nthese exclusively, the B causes; and similarly those common to the two\r\nfore-fingers exclusively, the C causes.\r\n\r\nThen the sum of the variable causes determining the class of pattern in\r\nthe four several digits now in question are these:--\r\n\r\n  Right thumb        A + B + an unclassed residue called X(=1=)\r\n  Left thumb         A + B +        \"        \"      \"    X(=2=)\r\n  Right fore-finger  A + C +        \"        \"      \"    Z(=1=)\r\n  Left fore-finger   A + C +        \"        \"      \"    Z(=2=)\r\n\r\nThe nearness of relationship between the two thumbs is sufficiently\r\nindicated by a fraction that expresses the proportion between all the\r\ncauses common to the two thumbs exclusively, and the totality of the\r\ncauses by which the A. L. W. class of the patterns of the thumbs is\r\ndetermined, that is to say, by\r\n\r\n            A + B\r\n  -----------------------      (1).\r\n  A + B + X(=1=) + X(=2=)\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the nearness of the relationship between the two fore-fingers\r\nby\r\n\r\n            A + C\r\n  -----------------------      (2).\r\n  A + C + Z(=1=) + Z(=2=)\r\n\r\nAnd that between a thumb and a fore-finger by\r\n\r\n                        A\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------      (3).\r\n  A + B + C + X(=1=) (or X(=2=)) + Z(=1=) (or Z(=2=))\r\n\r\nThe fractions (1) and (2) being both greater than (3), it follows that the\r\nrelationships between the two thumbs, or between the two fore-fingers, are\r\ncloser than that between the thumb and either fore-finger; at the same\r\ntime it is clear that neither of the two former relationships is so close\r\nas to reach identity. Similarly as regards the other couplets of digits.\r\nThe tabular entries fully confirm this deduction, for, without going now\r\ninto further details, it will be seen from the \"Mean of the Totals\" at the\r\nbottom line of Table VI_b_ that the average percentage of cases in which\r\ntwo different digits have the same class of patterns, whether they be on\r\nthe same or on opposite hands, is 59 or 57 (say 58), while the average\r\npercentage of cases in which right and left digits bearing the same name\r\nhave the same class of pattern (Table VI_a_) is 72. This is barely\r\ntwo-thirds of the 100 which would imply identity. At the same time, the 72\r\nconsiderably exceeds the 58.\r\n\r\nLet us now endeavour to measure the relationships between the various\r\ncouplets of digits on a well-defined centesimal scale, first recalling the\r\nfundamental principles of the connection that subsists between\r\nrelationships of all kinds, whether between digits, or between kinsmen, or\r\nbetween any of those numerous varieties of related events with which\r\nstatisticians deal.\r\n\r\nRelationships are all due to the joint action of two groups of variable\r\ncauses, the one common to both of the related objects, the other special\r\nto each, as in the case just discussed. Using an analogous nomenclature to\r\nthat already employed, the peculiarity of one of the two objects is due to\r\nan aggregate of variable causes that we may call C+X, and that of the\r\nother to C+Z, in which C are the causes common to both, and X and Z the\r\nspecial ones. In exact proportion as X and Z diminish, and C becomes of\r\noverpowering effect, so does the closeness of the relationship increase.\r\nWhen X and Z both disappear, the result is identity of character. On the\r\nother hand, when C disappears, all relationship ceases, and the variations\r\nof the two objects are strictly independent. The simplest case is that in\r\nwhich X and Z are equal, and _in this_, it becomes easy to devise a scale\r\nin which 0 deg. shall stand for no relationship, and 100 deg. for identity, and\r\nupon which the intermediate degrees of relationship may be marked at their\r\nproper value. Upon this assumption, but with some misgiving, I will\r\nattempt to subject the digits to this form of measurement. It will save\r\ntime first to work out an example, and then, after gaining in that way, a\r\nclearer understanding of what the process is, to discuss its defects. Let\r\nus select for our example the case that brings out these defects in the\r\nmost conspicuous manner, as follows:--\r\n\r\nTable V. tells us that the percentage of whorls in the right ring-finger\r\nis 45, and in the left ring-finger 31. Table VI_a_ tells us that the\r\npercentage of the double event of a whorl occurring on both the\r\nring-fingers of the same person is 26. It is required to express the\r\nrelationship between the right and left ring-fingers on a centesimal\r\nscale, in which 0 deg. shall stand for no relationship at all, and 100 deg. for\r\nthe closest possible relationship.\r\n\r\nIf no relationship should exist, there would nevertheless be a certain\r\npercentage of instances, due to pure chance, of the double event of whorls\r\noccurring in both ring-fingers, and it is easy to calculate their\r\nfrequency from the above data. The number of possible combinations of 100\r\nright ring-fingers with 100 left ones is 100 x 100, and of these 45 x 31\r\nwould be double events as above (call these for brevity \"double whorls\").\r\nConsequently the chance of a double whorl in any single couplet is\r\n(45x31)/(100x100), and their average frequency in 100 couplets,--in other\r\nwords, their average percentage is (45x31)/100 = 13.95, say 14. If, then,\r\nthe observed percentage of double whorls should be only 14, it would be a\r\nproof that the A. L. W. classes of patterns on the right and left\r\nring-fingers were quite independent; so their relationship, as expressed\r\non the centesimal scale, would be 0 deg. There could never be less than 14\r\ndouble whorls under the given conditions, except through some statistical\r\nirregularity.\r\n\r\nNow consider the opposite extreme of the closest possible relationship,\r\nsubject however, and this is the weak point, to the paramount condition\r\nthat the average frequencies of the A. L. W. classes may be taken as\r\n_pre-established_. As there are 45 per cent of whorls on the right\r\nring-finger, and only 31 on the left, the tendency to form double whorls,\r\nhowever stringent it may be, can only be satisfied in 31 cases. There\r\nremains a superfluity of 14 per cent cases in the right ring-finger which\r\nperforce must have for their partners either arches or loops. Hence the\r\npercentage of frequency that indicates the closest feasible relationship\r\nunder the pre-established conditions, would be 31.\r\n\r\nThe range of all possible relationships in respect to whorls, would\r\nconsequently lie between a percentage frequency of the minimum 14 and the\r\nmaximum 31, while the observed frequency is of the intermediate value of\r\n26. Subtracting the 14 from these three values, we have the series of 0,\r\n12, 17. These terms can be converted into their equivalents in a\r\ncentesimal scale that reaches from 0 deg. to 100 deg. instead of from 0 deg. to 17 deg.,\r\nby the ordinary rule of three, 12:_x_::17:100; _x_=70 or 71, whence the\r\nvalue _x_ of the observed relationship on the centesimal scale would be\r\n70 deg. or 71 deg., neglecting decimals.\r\n\r\nThis method of obtaining the value of 100 deg. is open to grave objection in\r\nthe present example. We have no right to consider that the 45 per cent of\r\nwhorls on the right ring-finger, and the 31 on the left, can be due to\r\npre-established conditions, which would exercise a paramount effect even\r\nthough the whorls were due entirely to causes common to both fingers.\r\nThere is some self-contradiction in such a supposition. Neither are we at\r\nliberty to assume that the respective effects of the special causes X and\r\nZ are equal in average amount; if they were, the percentage of whorls on\r\nthe right and on the left finger would invariably be equal.\r\n\r\nIn this particular example the difficulty of determining correctly the\r\nscale value of 100 deg. is exceptionally great; elsewhere, the percentages of\r\nfrequency in the two members of each couplet are more alike. In the two\r\nfore-fingers, and again in the two middle fingers, they are closely alike.\r\nTherefore, in these latter cases, it is not unreasonable to pass over the\r\nobjection that X and Z have not been proved to be equal, but we must\r\naccept the results in all other cases with great caution.\r\n\r\nWhen the digits are of different names,--as the thumb and the\r\nfore-finger,--whether the digits be on the same or on opposite hands,\r\nthere are two cases to be worked out; namely, such as (1) right thumb and\r\nleft fore-finger, and (2) left thumb and right fore-finger. Each accounts\r\nfor 50 per cent of the observed cases; therefore the mean of the two\r\npercentages is the correct percentage. The relationships calculated in the\r\nfollowing table do not include arches, except in two instances mentioned\r\nin a subsequent paragraph, as the arches are elsewhere too rare to furnish\r\nuseful results.\r\n\r\nIt did not seem necessary to repeat the calculation for couplets of digits\r\nof different names, situated on opposite hands, as those that were\r\ncalculated on closely the same data for similar couplets situated on the\r\nsame hands, suffice for both. It is evident from the irregularity in the\r\nrun of the figures that the units in the several entries cannot be more\r\nthan vaguely approximate. They have, however, been retained, as being\r\npossibly better than nothing at all.\r\n\r\nTABLE VIII.\r\n\r\n_Approximate Measures of Relationship between the various Digits, on a\r\nCentesimal Scale._\r\n\r\n(0 deg. = no relationship; 100 deg. = the utmost feasible likeness.)\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |            Couplets.            | Loops. | Whorls.| Means. |\r\n  |---------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\r\n  | _Digits of the same name._      |        |        |        |\r\n  |                                 |        |        |        |\r\n  | Right and left thumbs           |   57   |   64   |   61   |\r\n  |   \"        \"   fore-fingers     |   37   |   59   |   48   |\r\n  |   \"        \"   middle fingers   |   34   |   52   |   43   |\r\n  |   \"        \"   ring fingers     |   61   |   70   |   65   |\r\n  |---------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\r\n  |                  Means          |   47 deg.  |   61 deg.  |   54 deg.  |\r\n  |---------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\r\n  | _Digits of different names on   |        |        |        |\r\n  | the same or on opposite hands._ |        |        |        |\r\n  |                                 |        |        |        |\r\n  | Thumb and fore-finger           |   19   |   29   |   24   |\r\n  |     \"     middle finger         |   19   |   34   |   27   |\r\n  |     \"     ring-finger           |   33   |   44   |   39   |\r\n  | Fore and middle finger          |   52   |   68   |   60   |\r\n  |     \"    ring finger            |   13   |   34   |   23   |\r\n  | Middle and ring finger          |   31   |   74   |   52   |\r\n  |---------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\r\n  |                  Means          |   28 deg.  |   47 deg.  |   37 deg.  |\r\n  +------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThe arches were sufficiently numerous in the fore-fingers (17 per cent) to\r\nfully justify the application of this method of calculation. The result\r\nwas 43 deg., which agrees fairly with 48 deg., the mean of the loops and the\r\nwhorls. In the middle finger the frequency of the arches was only half the\r\nabove amount and barely suffices for calculation. It gave the result of\r\n38 deg., which also agrees fairly with 43 deg., the mean of the loops and the\r\nwhorls for that finger.\r\n\r\nSome definite results may be gathered from this table notwithstanding the\r\nirregularity with which the figures run. Its upper and lower halves\r\nclearly belong to different statistical groups, the entries in the former\r\nbeing almost uniformly larger than those in the latter, in the proportion\r\nof 54 deg. to 37 deg., say 3 to 2, which roughly represents in numerical terms the\r\nnearer relationship between digits of the same name, as compared to that\r\nbetween digits of different names. It seems also that of the 6 couplets of\r\ndigits bearing different names, the relationship is closest between the\r\nmiddle finger and the two adjacent ones (60 deg. and 52 deg., as against 24 deg., 27 deg.,\r\n39 deg. and 23 deg.). It is further seen in every pair of entries that whorls are\r\nrelated together more closely than loops. I note this, but cannot explain\r\nit. So far as my statistical inquiries into heredity have hitherto gone,\r\nall peculiarities were found to follow the same law of transmission, none\r\nbeing more surely inherited than others. If there were a tendency in any\r\none out of many alternative characters to be more heritable than the rest,\r\nthat character would become universally prevalent, in the absence of\r\nrestraining influences. But it does not follow that there are no peculiar\r\nrestraining influences here, nor that what is true for heredity, should be\r\ntrue, in all its details, as regards the relationships between the\r\ndifferent digits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF INDEXING\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this chapter the system of classification by Arches, Loops, and Whorls\r\ndescribed in Chapter V. will be used for indexing two, three, six or ten\r\ndigits, as the case may be.\r\n\r\nAn index to each set of finger marks made by the same person, is needful\r\nin almost every kind of inquiry, whether it be for descriptive purposes,\r\nfor investigations into race and heredity, or into questions of symmetry\r\nand correlation. It is essential to possess an index to the finger marks\r\nof known criminals before the method of finger prints can be utilised as\r\nan organised means of detection.\r\n\r\nThe ideal index might be conceived to consist of a considerable number of\r\ncompartments, or their equivalents, each bearing a different\r\nindex-heading, into which the sets of finger prints of different persons\r\nmay be severally sorted, so that all similar sets shall lie in the same\r\ncompartment.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the proposed method of index-headings is, that they\r\nshould depend upon a few conspicuous differences of pattern in many\r\nfingers, and not upon many minute differences in a few fingers. It is\r\ncarried into effect by distinguishing the A. L. W. class of pattern on\r\neach digit in succession, by a letter,--_a_ for Arch, _l_ for Loop, _w_\r\nfor Whorl; or else, as an alternative method, to subdivide _l_ by using\r\n_i_ for a loop with an Inner slope, and _o_ for one with an Outer slope,\r\nas the case may be. In this way, the class of pattern in each set of ten\r\ndigits is described by a sequence of ten letters, the various combinations\r\nof which are alphabetically arranged and form the different\r\nindex-headings. Let us now discuss the best method of carrying out this\r\nprinciple, by collating the results of alternative methods of applying it.\r\nWe have to consider the utility of the _i_ and _o_ as compared to the\r\nsimple _l_, and the gain through taking all ten digits into account,\r\ninstead of only some of them.\r\n\r\nIt will be instructive to print here an actual index to the finger prints\r\nof 100 different persons, who were not in any way selected, but taken as\r\nthey came, and to use it as the basis of a considerable portion of the\r\nfollowing remarks, to be checked where necessary, by results derived from\r\nan index to 500 cases, in which these hundred are included.\r\n\r\nThis index is compiled on the principle shortly to be explained, entitled\r\nthe \"_i_ and _o_ fore-finger\" method.\r\n\r\nTABLE IX.--INDEX TO 100 SETS OF FINGER PRINTS.\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------------+\r\n  |      |    A       B      C     D   |\r\n  |Order |  Right.

various good\r\nreasons that will be appreciated as we proceed, in the following order.\r\n\r\nThe ten digits are registered in four groups, which are distinguished in\r\nthe Index by the letters A, B, C, D:--\r\n\r\n    A. _First._ The fore, middle, and ring-fingers of the _right_ hand\r\n    taken in that order.\r\n\r\n    B. _Second._ The fore, middle, and ring-fingers of the _left_ hand\r\n    taken in that order.\r\n\r\n    C. _Third._ The thumb and little finger of the _right_ hand.\r\n\r\n    D. _Fourth._ The thumb and little finger of the _left_ hand.\r\n\r\nConsequently an index-heading will be of the form--\r\n\r\n  First         Second      Third      Fourth\r\n  group.        group.      group.     group.\r\n\r\n  _a a l_      _a a w_      _l l_      _l l_\r\n\r\nThese index-headings are catalogued in alphabetical order. The method used\r\nin the Index is that which takes note of no slopes, except those of loops\r\nin the fore-finger of either hand. Consequently the index-heading for my\r\nown digits, printed on the title-page, is _wlw oll wl wl_. Those of the\r\neight sets in Plate VI. are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  _i l w    i l l    w w    w l_\r\n  _o l w    o l w    w l    l l_\r\n  _o l w    o l w    w l    l l_\r\n  _o l w    o l l    l l    l l_\r\n  _i l w    i l w    w l    w l_\r\n  _i l w    i w l    l l    l l_\r\n  _i l l    w w l    l l    l l_\r\n  _o l l    a a l    l l    a l_\r\n  _o a a    a a a    l a    l a_\r\n\r\nFor convenience of description and reference, the successive entries in\r\nthe specimen index have been numbered from 1 to 100, but that is no part\r\nof the system: those figures would be replaced in a real index by names\r\nand addresses.\r\n\r\nA preliminary way of obtaining an idea of the differentiating power of an\r\nindex is to count the number of the different headings that are required\r\nto classify a specified number of cases. A table is appended which shows\r\nthe numbers of the headings in the three alternative methods (1) of noting\r\nslopes of all kinds in all digits, (2) of noting slopes of Loops only and\r\nin the fore-fingers only, and (3) of disregarding the slopes altogether.\r\nAlso in each of these three cases taking account of--\r\n\r\n    (_a_) All the ten digits;\r\n\r\n    (_b_) the fore, middle, and ring-fingers of both hands;\r\n\r\n    (_c_) those same three fingers, but of the right hand only;\r\n\r\n    (_d_) the fore and middle fingers of the right hand.\r\n\r\nTABLE X.\r\n\r\n_No. of different index-heads in 100 sets of Finger Prints._\r\n\r\n  +---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |           |                    |      Account taken of        |\r\n  |  No. of   |                    |------------------------------|\r\n  |  digits   |    Digits noted.   |   All   |_i_ and _o_|  No    |\r\n  | regarded. |                    | slopes. |  in fore- | slope. |\r\n  |           |                    |         |  fingers. |        |\r\n  |-----------|--------------------|---------|-----------|--------|\r\n  |     10    | All the 10 digits  |    82   |     76    |   71   |\r\n  |           |                    |         |           |        |\r\n  |           | Fore, middle,      |         |           |        |\r\n  |      6    | and ring-fingers   |    65   |     50    |   43   |\r\n  |           | of both hands      |         |           |        |\r\n  |           |                    |         |           |        |\r\n  |      3    | Of right hand only |    25   |     16    |   14   |\r\n  |           |                    |         |           |        |\r\n  |      2    | Fore and middle of |    12   |      8    |    7   |\r\n  |           | right hand only    |         |           |        |\r\n  +---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThe column headed \"all slopes\" refers to the method first used with\r\nsuccess, and described in my Memoir, already alluded to (_Proc. Roy.\r\nSoc._, 1891), accompanied by a specimen index, from which the present one\r\nwas derived. There the direction of the slope of every pattern that has\r\none, is taken into account, and in order to give as much scope as\r\npossible to the method, the term Arch (I then called it a Primary) was\r\nconstrued somewhat over-liberally (see p. 114). It was made to include the\r\nforked-arch Fig. 12 (~2~), and even the nascent-loop (~9~), so long as not\r\nmore than a single recurved ridge lay within the outline of the pattern;\r\ntherefore many of the so-called arches had slopes. It is not necessary to\r\ntrouble the reader with the numerical nomenclature that was then used, the\r\nmethod itself being now obsolete. Full particulars of it are, however,\r\ngiven in the Memoir.\r\n\r\nA somewhat large experience in sorting finger prints in various ways and\r\nrepeatedly, made it only too evident that the mental strain and risk of\r\nerror caused by taking all slopes into account was considerable. The\r\njudgment became fatigued and the eye puzzled by having to assign opposite\r\nmeanings to the same actual direction of a slope in the right and left\r\nhands respectively. There was also a frequent doubt as to the existence of\r\na slope in large whorls of the spiral- and circlet-in-loop patterns (Fig.\r\n13, ~21~, ~22~) when the impressions had not been rolled. A third\r\nobjection is the rarity of the inner slopes in any other digit than the\r\nfore-finger. It acted like a soporific to the judgment not only of myself\r\nbut of others, so that when an inner slope did occur it was apt to be\r\noverlooked. The first idea was to discard slopes altogether,\r\nnotwithstanding the accompanying loss of index power, but this would be an\r\nunnecessarily trenchant measure. The slope of a loop, though it be on the\r\nfore-finger alone, decidedly merits recognition, for it differentiates\r\nsuch loops into two not very unequal classes. Again, there is little\r\nchance of mistake in noting it, the impression of the thumb on the one\r\nside and those of the remaining fingers on the other, affording easy\r\nguidance to the eye and judgment. These considerations determined the\r\nmethod I now use exclusively, by which Table IX. was compiled, and to\r\nwhich the second column of Table X., headed \"_i_ and _o_ in fore-fingers,\"\r\nrefers.\r\n\r\nThe heading of the third column, \"no slope,\" explains itself, no account\r\nhaving been there taken of any slopes whatever, so _i_ and _o_ disappear,\r\nhaving become merged under _l_.\r\n\r\nThe table gives a very favourable impression of the differentiating power\r\nof all these methods of indexing. By the \"_i_ and _o_ fore-finger\" method,\r\nit requires as many as 76 different index-headings to include the finger\r\nprints of 100 different persons, 195 of 300 persons, and 285 of 500.\r\n\r\nThe number of entries under each index-heading varies greatly; reference\r\nto the index of 100 sets showing no less than six entries (Nos. 60-65)\r\nunder one of them, and four entries (Nos. 18-21 and 37-40) under each of\r\ntwo others. Thus, although a large portion of the 100 sets are solitary\r\nentries under their several headings, and can be found by a single\r\nreference, the remainder are grouped together like the commoner surnames\r\nin a directory. They are troublesome to distinguish, and cannot be\r\nsubdivided at all except by supplementary characteristics, such as the\r\nnumber of ridges in some specified part of the pattern, or the character\r\nof the cores.\r\n\r\nIn other respects the difference of merit between the three methods is\r\nsomewhat greater, as is succinctly indicated by the next table.\r\n\r\nTABLE XI.--_In 100 Sets._\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                    |No. of different index-headings.|\r\n  | Number of Entries  |--------------------------------|\r\n  |under the same head.|   All   |  _i_ and _o_ |  No   |\r\n  |                    | slopes. | fore-fingers | slope.|\r\n  |                    |         |     only.    |       |\r\n  |--------------------|---------|--------------|-------|\r\n  |          1         |    71   |       63     |   58  |\r\n  |          2         |    10   |        8     |    9  |\r\n  |          3         |     1   |        3     |    1  |\r\n  |          4         |   ...   |        2     |    2  |\r\n  |          5         |   ...   |      ...     |  ...  |\r\n  |          6         |     1   |      ...     |  ...  |\r\n  |         13         |   ...   |      ...     |    1  |\r\n  |--------------------|---------|--------------|-------|\r\n  |      Total         |    83   |       76     |   71  |\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nHence it is evident that the second method of \"_i-o_ fore-finger\" is\r\ncapable of dealing rapidly with 100 cases, but that the method of \"no\r\nslope\" will give trouble in twelve out of the hundred cases.\r\n\r\nTABLE XII.\r\n\r\n_Index-headings under which more than 1 per cent of the sets of Finger\r\nPrints were registered._\r\n\r\n(500 sets observed.)\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------\r\n  |          _i_ and _o_ in fore-fingers.            ||\r\n  |----------------------------------------------------\r\n  |    No.   |                             |Frequency||\r\n  |    for   |       Index-heading.        |   per   ||\r\n  |Reference.|                             |  cent.  ||\r\n  |----------|-----------------------------|---------||\r\n  |     1    | _a l l   a l l   l l   l l_ |   1.2   ||\r\n  |     2    | _a l l   i l l    \"     \" _ |   1.6   ||\r\n  |----------|-----------------------------|---------||\r\n  |     3    | _i l l   i l l    \"     \" _ |   2.8   ||\r\n  |     4    | _o l l   i l l    \"     \" _ |   1.4   ||\r\n  |     5    | _o l l   o l l    \"     \" _ |   4.0   ||\r\n  |----------|-----------------------------|---------||\r\n  |     6    | _i l l   o l l   w l   l l_ |   1.2   ||\r\n  |     7    | _o l l   o l l    \"     \" _ |   1.4   ||\r\n  |----------|-----------------------------|---------||\r\n  |     8    | _o l l   a l l   l l   l l_ |   2.2   ||\r\n  |     9    | _o l w   u l l    \"     \" _ |   2.0   ||\r\n  |    10    | _w l l   w l l    \"     \" _ |   1.2   ||\r\n  |    11    | _w w w   w w w   w w   w w_ |   1.4   ||\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n  --------------------------------------------------+\r\n                     No slope.                      |\r\n  --------------------------------------------------|\r\n     No.    |                             |Frequency|\r\n     for    |       Index-heading.        |   per   |\r\n  Reference.|                             |  cent.  |\r\n  ----------|-----------------------------|---------|\r\n       I.   | _a l l   a l l   l l   l l_ |   1.2   |\r\n      II.   | _a l l   l l l    \"     \" _ |   2.2   |\r\n  ----------|-----------------------------|---------|\r\n            |                             |         |\r\n     III.   | _l l l   l l l    \"     \" _ |   9.2   |\r\n            |                             |         |\r\n  ----------|-----------------------------|---------|\r\n      IV.   | _l l l   l l l   w l   l l_ |   3.2   |\r\n            |                             |         |\r\n  ----------|-----------------------------|---------|\r\n       V.   | _l l l   a l l   l l   l l_ |   3.0   |\r\n      VI.   | _l l w   l l l    \"     \" _ |   3.0   |\r\n     VII.   | _w l l   w l l    \"     \" _ |   1.2   |\r\n    VIII.   | _w w w   w w w   w w   w w_ |   1.4   |\r\n  --------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n    The headings in the right half of the table include more cases than\r\n    the left half, because a combination of two or more cases that\r\n    severally contain less than 1 per cent of the finger prints, and are\r\n    therefore ignored in the first half of the table, may exceed 1 per\r\n    cent and find a place in the second half.\r\n\r\nThe entries in Table XII. are derived from a catalogue of 500 sets, and\r\ninclude all entries that appeared more than five times; in other words,\r\nwhose frequency exceeded 1 per cent. These are the index-headings that\r\ngive enough trouble to deserve notice in catalogues of, say, from 500 to\r\n1000 sets.\r\n\r\nIn the left half of Table XII. all the index-headings are given, under\r\neach of which more than 1 per cent of the sets fell, when the method of\r\n\"_i_ and _o_ in fore-fingers\" was adopted; also the respective percentage\r\nof the cases that fell under them. In the right half of the table are the\r\ncorresponding index-headings, together with the percentages of frequency,\r\nwhen the \"no slope\" method is employed. These are distinguished by Roman\r\nnumerals. The great advantage of the \"_i_ and _o_ fore-finger\" method lies\r\nin its power of breaking up certain large groups which are very\r\ntroublesome to deal with by the \"no slope\" method. According to the latter\r\nas many as 9.2 per cent of all the entries fall under the index-heading\r\nmarked III., but according to the \"_i-o_ fore-finger\" method these are\r\ndistributed among the headings 3, 4, and 5. The \"all slopes\" method has\r\nthe peculiar merit of breaking up the large group Nos. 11 and VIII. of\r\n\"all whorls,\" but its importance is not great on that account, as whorls\r\nare distinguishable by their cores, which are less troublesome to observe\r\nthan their slopes.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of all the entries that fall under a single index-heading,\r\naccording to the \"_i-o_ fore-finger\" method, diminishes with the number of\r\nentries at the following rate:--\r\n\r\nTABLE XIII.\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                               | Total number of entries. |\r\n  |                               |--------------------------|\r\n  |                               |   100  |   300  |   500  |\r\n  |-------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\r\n  | Percentage of entries falling |        |        |        |\r\n  |   under a single head         |    63  |  49.0  |  39.8  |\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nIt may be that every one of the 4{2} x 3{8}, or one hundred and five\r\nthousand possible varieties of index-headings, according to the \"_i-o_\r\nfore-finger\" method, may occur in Nature, but there is much probability\r\nthat some of them may be so rare that instances of no entry under certain\r\nheads would appear in the register, even of an enormous number of persons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHitherto we have supposed that prints of the ten fingers have in each case\r\nbeen indexed. The question now to be considered is the gain through\r\ndealing in each case with all ten digits, instead of following the easier\r\npractice of regarding only a few of them. The following table, drawn up\r\nfrom the hundred cases by the \"all slopes\" method, will show its amount.\r\n\r\nTABLE XIV.--_From 100 Sets._\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                       |         |  No. of different index-headings.  |\r\n  |        Digits.        | No. of  |------------------------------------|\r\n  |                       | digits. |  All    |  _i_ and _o_ | No slope. |\r\n  |                       |         | slopes. | fore-finger. |           |\r\n  |-----------------------|---------|---------|--------------|-----------|\r\n  | Fore and middle of    |         |         |              |           |\r\n  |   right hand          |    2    |    11   |       8      |     7     |\r\n  |                       |         |         |              |           |\r\n  | Fore, middle and ring |         |         |              |           |\r\n  |   of right hand       |    3    |    23   |      16      |    14     |\r\n  |                       |         |         |              |           |\r\n  | Fore, middle and ring |         |         |              |           |\r\n  |   of both hands       |    6    |    65   |      50      |    45     |\r\n  |                       |         |         |              |           |\r\n  | All ten digits        |   10    |    83   |      76      |    73     |\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThe trouble of printing, reading off, and indexing the ten digits, is\r\npractically twice that of dealing with the six fingers; namely, three on\r\neach of the hands; the thumb being inconvenient to print from, and having\r\nto be printed separately, even for a dabbed impression, while the fingers\r\nof either hand can be dabbed down simultaneously.\r\n\r\nFor a large collection the ten digit method is certainly the best, as it\r\nbreaks up the big battalions; also in case of one or more fingers having\r\nbeen injured, it gives reserve material to work upon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe now come to the great difficulty in all classifications; that of\r\ntransitional cases. What is to be done with those prints which cannot be\r\ncertainly classed as Arches, Loops, or Whorls, but which lie between some\r\ntwo of them? These occur about once in every forty digits, or once in\r\nevery four pairs of hands. The roughest way is to put a mark by the side\r\nof the entry to indicate doubt, a better one is to make a mark that shall\r\nexpress the nature of the peculiarity; thus a particular eyed pattern\r\n(Plate 10, Fig. 16, _n_) may be transitional between a loop and a whorl;\r\nunder whichever of the two it is entered, the mark might be an _e_ to show\r\nthat anyhow it is an eye. Then, when it is required to discover whether an\r\nindex contains a duplicate of a given specimen in which a transitional\r\npattern occurs, the two headings between which the doubt lies have to be\r\nsearched, and the marked entries will limit the search. Many alternative\r\nways of marking may be successfully used, but I am not yet prepared to\r\npropose one as being distinctly the best. When there are two of these\r\nmarks in the same set, it seldom happens that more than two references\r\nhave to be made, as it is usual for the ambiguity to be of the same kind\r\nin both of the doubtful fingers. If the ambiguities were quite\r\nindependent, then two marks would require four references, and three marks\r\nwould require nine. There are a few nondescript prints that would fall\r\nunder a separate heading, such as Z. Similarly, as regards lost or injured\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\nI have tried various methods of sub-classification, and find no difficulty\r\nin any of them, but general rules seem inadvisable; it being best to treat\r\neach large group on its own merits.\r\n\r\nOne method that I have adopted and described in the _Proc. Royal Soc._, is\r\nto sketch in a cursive and symbolic form the patterns of the several\r\nfingers in the order in which they appear in the print, confining myself\r\nto a limited number of symbols, such as might be used for printer's types.\r\nThey sufficed fairly for some thousands of the finger marks upon which\r\nthey were tried, but doubtless they could be improved. A little violence\r\nhas of course to be used now and then, in fitting some unusual patterns to\r\nsome one or other of these few symbols. But we are familiar with such\r\nprocesses in ordinary spelling, making the same letter do duty for\r\ndifferent sounds, as _a_ in the words _as_, _ale_, _ask_, and _all_. The\r\nplan of using symbols has many secondary merits. It facilitates a\r\nleisurely revision of first determinations, it affords a pictorial record\r\nof the final judgment that is directly comparable with the print itself,\r\nand it almost wholly checks blunders between inner and outer slopes. A\r\nbeginner in finger reading will educate his judgment by habitually using\r\nthem at first.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 2.\r\n\r\nFIG. 3. Form of card used for impressions of the ten digits. 11-1/2 x 5\r\ninches.\r\n\r\nFIG. 4. Roller and its bearings, of a pocket printing apparatus.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cores give great assistance in breaking up the very large groups of\r\nall-loops (see Table XII., Nos. 11 and VIII.); so does an entry of the\r\napproximate number of ridges in some selected fingers, that lie between\r\nthe core and the upper outline of the loop.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe plan I am now using for keeping finger prints in regular order, is\r\nthis:--In the principal collection, the prints of each person's ten digits\r\nare taken on the same large card; the four fingers of either hand being\r\n_dabbed_ down simultaneously above, and all the ten digits _rolled_\r\nseparately below. (Plate 2, Fig. 3.) Each card has a hole three-eighths of\r\nan inch in diameter, punched in the middle near to the bottom edge, and\r\nthe cards are kept in trays, which they loosely fit, like the card\r\ncatalogues used in many libraries. Each tray holds easily 500 cards, which\r\nare secured by a long stout wire passing like a skewer through the ends of\r\nthe box and the holes in the cards. The hinder end of the box is sloped,\r\nso the cards can be tilted back and easily examined; they can be inserted\r\nor removed after withdrawing the wire.\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that the leading and therefore the most conspicuous\r\nheadings in the index refer to the fore, middle, and ring-fingers of the\r\nright hand, as entered in column A of the Specimen Register (Table IX.)\r\nThe variety of these in the \"_i_ and _o_ fore-finger\" method, of which we\r\nare now speaking, cannot exceed thirty-six, there being only four\r\nvarieties (_a_, _i_, _o_, _w_) in the fore-finger, and three varieties\r\n(_a_, _l_, _w_) in each of the other two; so their maximum number is 4 x 3\r\nx 3 = 36. The actual number of such index-headings in 500 cases, and the\r\nnumber of entries that fell under each, was found to be as follows:--\r\n\r\nTABLE XV.\r\n\r\n_No. of entries in 500 cases, under each of the thirty-six possible\r\nindex-letters for the fore, middle, and ring-fingers of the right hand by\r\nthe \"i-o fore-finger\" method._\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  | _a a a_ |  4 || _i a a_ |  1 || _o a a_ |  1 || _w a a_ | -- |\r\n  |     _l_ | 17 ||     _l_ |  3 ||     _l_ |  2 ||     _l_ | -- |\r\n  |     _w_ |  5 ||     _w_ | -- ||     _w_ |  1 ||     _w_ |  1 |\r\n  |         |    ||         |    ||         |    ||         |    |\r\n  | _a l a_ |  3 || _i l a_ | -- || _o l a_ |  2 || _w l a_ |  1 |\r\n  |     _l_ | 45 ||     _l_ | 54 ||     _l_ | 88 ||     _l_ | 40 |\r\n  |     _w_ | 11 ||     _w_ | 33 ||     _w_ | 59 ||     _w_ | 52 |\r\n  |         |    ||         |    ||         |    ||         |    |\r\n  | _a w a_ | -- || _i w a_ | -- || _o w a_ | -- || _w w a_ | -- |\r\n  |     _l_ | -- ||     _l_ |  3 ||     _l_ | -- ||     _l_ | 10 |\r\n  |     _w_ | -- ||     _w_ | 11 ||     _w_ |  6 ||     _w_ | 47 |\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n    _a_ = Arch.\r\n\r\n    _i_ = Inward-sloped Loop on the fore-finger.\r\n\r\n    _o_ = Outward-sloped Loop on the fore-finger.\r\n\r\n    _l_ = Loop of either kind on the middle or ring finger.\r\n\r\n    _w_ = Whorl.\r\n\r\nThese 500 cases supply no entries at all to eleven of the thirty-six\r\nindex-headings, less than five entries (or under 1 per cent) to ten\r\nothers, and the supply is distributed very unevenly among the remaining\r\nfifteen. This table makes it easy to calculate beforehand the spaces\r\nrequired for an index of any specified number of prints, whether they be\r\non the pages of a Register, or in compartments, or in drawers of movable\r\ncards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nPERSONAL IDENTIFICATION\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall speak in this chapter of the aid that finger prints can give to\r\npersonal identification, supposing throughout that facilities exist for\r\ntaking them well and cheaply, and that more or less practice in reading\r\nthem has been acquired by many persons. A few introductory words will show\r\nthis supposition to be reasonable. At the present moment any printer, and\r\nthere are many printers in every town, would, at a small charge, blacken a\r\nslab and take the prints effectively, after being warned to use very\r\nlittle ink, as described in Chapter III. The occupation of finger printing\r\nwould, however, fall more naturally into the hands of photographers, who,\r\nin addition to being found everywhere, are peculiarly well suited to it,\r\nfor, taken as a class, they are naturally gifted with manual dexterity and\r\nmechanical ingenuity. Having secured good impressions, they could multiply\r\nthem when necessary, and enlarge when desired, while the ticketing and\r\npreservation of the negatives would fall into their usual business\r\nroutine. As they already occupy themselves with one means of\r\nidentification, a second means of obtaining the same result is allied to\r\ntheir present work.\r\n\r\nWere it the custom for persons about to travel to ask for prints of their\r\nfingers when they were photographed, a familiarity with the peculiarities\r\nof finger prints, and the methods of describing and classifying them,\r\nwould become common. Wherever finger prints may be wanted for purposes of\r\nattestation and the like, the fact mentioned by Sir W. Herschel (p. 45) as\r\nto the readiness with which his native orderlies learnt to take them with\r\nthe ink of his office stamp, must not be forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe remarks about to be made refer to identification generally, and are\r\nnot affected by the fact that the complete process may or may not include\r\nthe preliminary search of a catalogue; the two stages of search and of\r\ncomparison will be treated separately towards the close of the chapter.\r\n\r\nIn civilised lands, honest citizens rarely need additional means of\r\nidentification to their signatures, their photographs, and to personal\r\nintroductions. The cases in which other evidence is wanted are chiefly\r\nconnected with violent death through accident, murder, or suicide, which\r\nyield the constant and gruesome supply to the Morgue of Paris, and to\r\ncorresponding institutions in other large towns, where the bodies of\r\nunknown persons are exposed for identification, often in vain. But when\r\nhonest persons travel to distant countries where they have few or no\r\nfriends, the need for a means of recognition is more frequently felt. The\r\nrisk of death through accident or crime is increased, and the probability\r\nof subsequent identification diminished. There is a possibility not too\r\nremote to be disregarded, especially in times of war, of a harmless person\r\nbeing arrested by mistake for another man, and being in sore straits to\r\ngive satisfactory proof of the error. A signature may be distrusted as a\r\nforgery. There is also some small chance, when he returns to his own\r\ncountry after a long absence, of finding difficulty in proving who he is.\r\nBut in civilised lands and in peaceable times, the chief use of a sure\r\nmeans of identification is to benefit society by detecting rogues, rather\r\nthan to establish the identity of men who are honest. Is this criminal an\r\nold offender? Is this new recruit a deserter? Is this professed pensioner\r\npersonating a man who is dead? Is this upstart claimant to property the\r\ntrue heir, who was believed to have died in foreign lands?\r\n\r\nIn India and in many of our Colonies the absence of satisfactory means for\r\nidentifying persons of other races is seriously felt. The natives are\r\nmostly unable to sign; their features are not readily distinguished by\r\nEuropeans; and in too many cases they are characterised by a strange\r\namount of litigiousness, wiliness, and unveracity. The experience of Sir\r\nW. Herschel, and the way in which he met these unfavourable conditions by\r\nthe method of finger prints, has been briefly described in p. 27. Lately\r\nMajor Ferris, of the Indian Staff Corps, happening to visit my laboratory\r\nduring my absence, and knowing but little of what Sir W. Herschel had\r\ndone, was greatly impressed by the possibilities of finger prints. After\r\nacquainting himself with the process, we discussed the subject together,\r\nand he very kindly gave me his views for insertion here. They are as\r\nfollow, with a few trifling changes of words:--\r\n\r\n    \"During a period of twenty-three years, eighteen of which have been\r\n    passed in the Political Department of the Bombay Government, the great\r\n    need of an official system of identification has been constantly\r\n    forced on my mind.\r\n\r\n    \"The uniformity in the colour of hair, eyes, and complexion of the\r\n    Indian races renders identification far from easy, and the difficulty\r\n    of recording the description of an individual, so that he may be\r\n    afterwards recognised, is very great. Again, their hand-writing,\r\n    whether it be in Persian or Devanagri letters, is devoid of character\r\n    and gives but little help towards identification.\r\n\r\n    \"The tenacity with which a native of India cleaves to his ancestral\r\n    land, his innate desire to acquire more and more, and the obligation\r\n    that accrues to him at birth of safeguarding that which has already\r\n    been acquired, amounts to a religion, and passes the comprehension of\r\n    the ordinary Western mind. This passion, or religion, coupled with a\r\n    natural taste for litigation, brings annually into the Civil Courts an\r\n    enormous number of suits affecting land. In a native State at one time\r\n    under my political charge, the percentage of suits for the possession\r\n    of land in which the title was disputed amounted to no less than 92,\r\n    while in 83 per cent of these the writing by which the transfer of\r\n    title purported to have been made, was repudiated by the former\r\n    title-holder as fraudulent and not executed by him. When it is\r\n    remembered that an enormous majority of the landholders whose titles\r\n    come into court are absolutely illiterate, and that their execution of\r\n    the documents is attested by a mark made by a third party, frequently,\r\n    though not always apparently, interested in the transfer, it will be\r\n    seen that there is a wide door open to fraud, whether by false\r\n    repudiation or by criminal attempt at dispossession.\r\n\r\n    \"It has frequently happened in my experience that a transfer of title\r\n    or possession was repudiated; the person purporting to have executed\r\n    the transfer asserting that he had no knowledge of it, and never\r\n    authorised any one to write, sign, or present it for registration.\r\n    This was met by a categorical statement on the part of the beneficiary\r\n    and of the attesting witnesses, concerning the time, date, and\r\n    circumstances of the execution and registration, that demolished the\r\n    simple denial of the man whom it was sought to dispossess. Without\r\n    going into the ethics of falsehood among Western and Eastern peoples,\r\n    it would be impossible to explain how what is repugnant to the one as\r\n    downright lying, is very frequently considered as no more than venial\r\n    prevarication by the other. This, however, is too large a subject for\r\n    present purposes, but the fact remains that perjury is perpetrated in\r\n    Indian Courts to an extent unknown in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n    \"The interests of landholders are partially safeguarded by the Act\r\n    that requires all documents effecting the transfer of immovable\r\n    property to be registered, but it could be explained, though not in\r\n    the short space of this letter, how the provisions of the Act can be,\r\n    and frequently are, fulfilled in the absence of the principal person,\r\n    the executor.\r\n\r\n    \"Enough has been said to show that if some simple but efficient means\r\n    could be contrived to identify the person who has executed a bond,\r\n    cases of fraud such as these would practically disappear from the\r\n    judicial registers. Were the legislature to amend the Registration Act\r\n    and require that the original document as well as the copy in the\r\n    Registration Book should bear the imprint of one or more fingers of\r\n    the parties to the deed, I have little hesitation in saying that not\r\n    only would fraud be detected, but that in a short time the facility of\r\n    that detection would act as a deterrent for the future. [This was\r\n    precisely the experience of Sir W. Herschel.--F.G.] In the majority of\r\n    cases, the mere question would be, Is the man A the same person as B,\r\n    or is he not? and of that question the finger marks would give\r\n    unerring proof. For example, to take the simplest case, A is sued for\r\n    possession of some land, the title of which he is stated to have\r\n    parted with to another for a consideration. The document and the\r\n    Registration Book both bear the imprint of the index finger of the\r\n    right hand of A. A repudiates, and a comparison shows that whereas\r\n    the finger pattern of A is a whorl, the imprint on the document is a\r\n    loop; consequently A did not execute it.\r\n\r\n    \"In the identification of Government pensioners the finger print\r\n    method would be very valuable. At one period, I had the payment of\r\n    many hundreds of military pensioners. Personation was most difficult\r\n    to detect in persons coming from a distance, who had no local\r\n    acquaintances, and more especially where the claimants were women. The\r\n    marks of identification noted in the pension roll were usually\r\n    variations of:--\"Hair black--Eyes brown--Complexion wheat\r\n    colour--Marks of tattooing on fore-arm\"--terms which are equally\r\n    appropriate to a large number of the pensioners. The description was\r\n    supplemented in some instances, where the pensioner had some\r\n    distinguishing mark or scar, but such cases are considerably rarer\r\n    than might be supposed, and in women the marks are not infrequently in\r\n    such a position as to practically preclude comparison. Here also the\r\n    imprint of one or more finger prints on the pension certificate, would\r\n    be sufficient to settle any doubt as to identity.\r\n\r\n    \"As a large number of persons pass through the Indian gaols not only\r\n    while undergoing terms of imprisonment, but in default of payment of a\r\n    fine, it could not but prove of value were the finger prints of one\r\n    and all secured. They might assist in identifying persons who have\r\n    formerly been convicted, of whom the local police have no knowledge,\r\n    and who bear a name that may be the common property of half a hundred\r\n    in any small town.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever difficulty may be felt in the identification of Hindoos, is\r\nexperienced in at least an equal degree in that of the Chinese residents\r\nin our Colonies and Settlements, who to European eyes are still more alike\r\nthan the Hindoos, and in whose names there is still less variety. I have\r\nalready referred (p. 26) to Mr. Tabor, of San Francisco, and his proposal\r\nin respect to the registration of the Chinese. Remarks showing the need\r\nof some satisfactory method of identifying them, have reached me from\r\nvarious sources. The _British North Borneo Herald_, August 1, 1888, that\r\nlies before me as I write, alludes to the difficulty of identifying\r\ncoolies, either by photographs or measurements, as likely to become\r\nimportant in the early future of that country.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of registration, the method of printing to be employed, must\r\nbe one that gives little trouble on the one hand, and yields the maximum\r\nof efficiency for that amount of trouble on the other. Sir W. Herschel\r\nimpressed simultaneously the fore and middle fingers of the right hand. To\r\nimpress simultaneously the fore, middle, and ring-fingers of the right\r\nhand ought, however, to be better, the trouble being no greater, while\r\nthree prints are obviously more effective than two, especially for an\r\noff-hand comparison. Moreover, the patterns on the ring-finger are much\r\nmore variable than those on the middle finger. Much as rolled impressions\r\nare to be preferred for minute and exhaustive comparisons, they would\r\nprobably be inconvenient for purposes of registration or attestation. Each\r\nfinger has to be rolled separately, and each separate rolling takes more\r\ntime than a dab of all the fingers of one hand simultaneously. Now a\r\ndabbed impression of even two fingers is more useful for registration\r\npurposes than the rolled impression of one; much more is a dabbed\r\nimpression of three, especially when the third is the variable\r\nring-finger. Again, in a simultaneous impression, there is no doubt as to\r\nthe sequence of the finger prints being correct, but there may be some\r\noccasional bungling when the fingers are printed separately.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor most criminal investigations, and for some other purposes also, the\r\nquestion is not the simple one just considered, namely, \"Is A the same\r\nperson, or a different person from B?\" but the much more difficult problem\r\nof \"Who is this unknown person X? Is his name contained in such and such a\r\nregister?\" We will now consider how this question may be answered.\r\n\r\nRegisters of criminals are kept in all civilised countries, but in France\r\nthey are indexed according to the method of M. Alphonse Bertillon, which\r\nadmits of an effective search being made through a large collection. We\r\nshall see how much the differentiating power of the French or of any other\r\nsystem of indexing might be increased by including finger prints in the\r\nregister.\r\n\r\nM. Bertillon has described his system in three pamphlets:--\r\n\r\n    (1) _Une application pratique de l'anthropometrie_, Extrait des\r\n    Annales de Demographie Interne. Paris 1881. (2) _Les signalements\r\n    anthropometriques_, Conference faite au Congres Penitentiare\r\n    International de Rome, Nov. 22, 1885. (3) _Sur le fonctionnement du\r\n    service des signalements_. All the above are published by Masson, 120\r\n    Boulevard St. Germain, Paris. To these must be added a very\r\n    interesting but anonymous pamphlet, based on official documents, and\r\n    which I have reason to know is authorised by M. Bertillon, namely, (4)\r\n    _L'anthropometrie Judiciare en Paris, en 1889_: G. Stenheil, 2 Rue\r\n    Casimir-Delavigne, Paris.\r\n\r\n    Besides these a substantial volume is forthcoming, which may give a\r\n    satisfactory solution to some present uncertainties.\r\n\r\nThe scale on which the service is carried on, is very large. It was begun\r\nin 1883, and by the end of 1887 no less than 60,000 sets of measures were\r\nin hand, but thus far only about one half of the persons arrested in Paris\r\nwere measured, owing to the insufficiency of the staff. Arrangements were\r\nthen made for its further extension. There are from 100 to 150 prisoners\r\nsentenced each day by the Courts of Law in Paris to more than a few days'\r\nimprisonment, and every one of these is sent to the Depot for twenty-four\r\nhours. While there, they are now submitted to _Bertillonage_, a newly\r\ncoined word that has already come into use. This is done in the forenoon,\r\nby three operators and three clerks; six officials in all. About half of\r\nthe prisoners are old offenders, of whom a considerable proportion give\r\ntheir names correctly, as is rapidly verified by an alphabetically\r\narranged catalogue of cards, each of which contains front and profile\r\nphotographs, and measurements. The remainder are examined strictly; their\r\nbodily marks are recorded according to a terse system of a few letters,\r\nand they are variously measured. Each person occupies seven or eight\r\nminutes. They are then photographed. From sixty to seventy-five prisoners\r\ngo through this complete process every forenoon. In the afternoon the\r\nofficials are engaged in making numerous copies of each set of records,\r\none of which is sent to Lyon, and another to Marseille, where there are\r\nsimilar establishments. They also classify the copies of records that are\r\nreceived from those towns and elsewhere in France, of which from seventy\r\nto one hundred arrive daily. Lastly, they search the Registers for\r\nduplicate sets of measures of those, whether in Paris or in the provinces,\r\nwho were suspected of having given false names. The entire staff consists\r\nof ten persons. It is difficult to rightly interpret the figures given in\r\nthe pamphlet (4) at pp. 22-24, as they appear to disagree, but as I\r\nunderstand them, 562 prisoners who gave false names in the year 1890 were\r\nrecognised by _Bertillonage_, and only four other persons were otherwise\r\ndiscovered to have been convicted previously, who had escaped recognition\r\nby its means.\r\n\r\nI had the pleasure of seeing the system in operation in Paris a few years\r\nago, and was greatly impressed by the deftness of the measuring, and with\r\nthe swiftness and success with which the assistants searched for the cards\r\ncontaining entries similar to the measures of the prisoner then under\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nIt is stated in the _Signalements_ (p. 12) that the basis of the\r\nclassification are the four measurements (1) Head-length, (2)\r\nHead-breadth, (3) Middle-finger-length, (4) Foot-length, their constancy\r\nduring adult life nearly always [as stated] holding good. Each of these\r\nfour elements severally is considered as belonging to one or other of\r\nthree equally numerous classes--small, medium, and large; consequently\r\nthere are 3{4} or 81 principal headings, under some one of which the card\r\nof each prisoner is in the first instance sorted. Each of these primary\r\nheadings is successively subdivided, on the same general principle of a\r\nthree-fold classification, according to other measures that are more or\r\nless subject to uncertainties, namely, the height, the span, the cubit,\r\nthe length and breadth of the ear, and the height of the bust. The\r\neye-colour alone is subjected to seven divisions. The general result is\r\n(pp. 19, 22) that a total of twelve measures are employed, of which eleven\r\nare classed on the three-fold principle, and one on the seven-fold, giving\r\na final result of 3{11} x 7, or more than a million possible combinations.\r\nM. Bertillon considers it by no means necessary to stop here, but in his\r\nchapter (p. 22) on the \"Infinite Extension of the Classification,\" claims\r\nthat the method may be indefinitely extended.\r\n\r\nThe success of the system is considered by many experts to be fully\r\nproved, notwithstanding many apparent objections, one of which is the\r\ndifficulty due to transitional cases: a belief in its success has\r\ncertainly obtained a firm hold upon the popular imagination in France. Its\r\ngeneral acceptance elsewhere seems to have been delayed in part by a\r\ntheoretical error in the published calculations of its efficiency: the\r\nmeasures of the limbs which are undoubtedly correlated being treated as\r\nindependent, and in part by the absence of a sufficiently detailed account\r\nof the practical difficulties experienced in its employment. Thus in the\r\n_Application pratique_, p. 9: \"We are embarrassed what to choose, the\r\nnumber of human measures which vary independently of each other being\r\nconsiderable.\" In the _Signalements_, p. 19: \"It has been shown\" (by\r\nassuming this independent variability) \"that by seven measurements, 60,000\r\nphotographs can be separated into batches of less than ten in each.\" (By\r\nthe way, even on that assumption, the result is somewhat exaggerated, the\r\nfigures having been arrived at by successively taking the higher of the\r\ntwo nearest round values.) In short, the general tone of these two memoirs\r\nis one of enthusiastic belief in the method, based almost wholly, so far\r\nas is there shown, on questionable _theoretic_ grounds of efficiency.\r\n\r\nTo learn how far correlation interferes with the regularity of\r\ndistribution, causing more entries to be made under some index-heads than\r\nothers, as was the case with finger prints, I have classified on the\r\nBertillon system, 500 sets of measures taken at my laboratory. It was not\r\npracticable to take more than three of the four primary measures, namely,\r\nthe head-length, its breadth, and the middle-finger-length. The other\r\nmeasure, that of foot-length, is not made at my laboratory, as it would\r\nrequire the shoes to be taken off, which is inconvenient since persons of\r\nall ranks and both sexes are measured there; but this matters little for\r\nthe purpose immediately in view. It should, however, be noted that the\r\nhead-length and head-breadth have especial importance, being only slightly\r\ncorrelated, either together or with any other dimension of the body. Many\r\na small man has a head that is large in one or both directions, while a\r\nsmall man rarely has a large foot, finger, or cubit, and conversely with\r\nrespect to large men.\r\n\r\nThe following set of five measures of each of the 500 persons were then\r\ntabulated: (1) head-length; (2) head-breadth; (3) span; (4) body-height,\r\nthat is the height of the top of the head from the seat on which the\r\nperson sits; (5) middle-finger-length. The measurements were to the\r\nnearest tenth of an inch, but in cases of doubt, half-tenths were recorded\r\nin (1), (2), and (5). With this moderate minuteness of measurement, it was\r\nimpossible so to divide the measures as to give better results than the\r\nfollowing, which show that the numbers in the three classes are not as\r\nequal as desirable. But they nevertheless enable us to arrive at an\r\napproximate idea of the irregular character of the distribution.\r\n\r\nTABLE XVI.\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                |   Medium     |Nos. in the three classes respectively.|\r\n  |   Dimensions   | measures in  |---------------------------------------|\r\n  |    measured.   | inches and   |   -    |    0    |    +    |   Total. |\r\n  |                |   tenths.    | below. | medium. |  above. |          |\r\n  |----------------|--------------|--------|---------|---------|----------|\r\n  |1.

In one case no less than 24 sets fell under the same head;\r\nin another case 19 did so, and there were two cases in which 14, 11, and\r\n10 severally did the same. Thus, out of 500 sets (see the five bottom\r\nlines in the last column of the above table) no less than 113 sets fell\r\ninto four classes, each of which included from 10 to 24 entries.\r\n\r\nThe 24 sets whose Index-number is + M, + + + admit of being easily\r\nsubdivided and rapidly sorted by an expert, into smaller groups, paying\r\nregard to considerable differences only, in the head-length and\r\nhead-breadth. After doing this, two comparatively large groups remain,\r\nwith five cases in each, which require further analysis. They are as\r\nfollow, the height and eye-colour being added in each case, and brackets\r\nbeing so placed as to indicate measures that do not differ to a sufficient\r\namount to be surely distinguished. No two sets are alike throughout, some\r\ndifference of considerable magnitude always occurring to distinguish them.\r\nNos. 2 and 3 come closest together, and are distinguished by eye-colour\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nTABLE XIX.\r\n\r\n  Five cases of Head-length 8.0, and Head-breadth 6.1.\r\n\r\n           Span.

It shows that each one of the 500 sets may be\r\ndistinguished from all the others by means of only seven elements; for if\r\nit is possible so to subdivide twenty-four entries that come under one\r\nindex-heading, we may assume that we could do so in the other cases where\r\nthe entries were fewer. The other measures that I possess--strength of\r\ngrasp and breathing capacity--are closely correlated with stature and\r\nbulk, while eyesight and reaction-time are uncorrelated, but the latter\r\nare hardly suited to test the further application of the Bertillon method.\r\n\r\nIt would appear, from these and other data, that a purely anthropometric\r\nclassification, irrespective of bodily marks and photographs, would enable\r\nan expert to deal with registers of considerable size.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind that mediocrities differ less from one another than\r\nmembers of either of the extreme classes, and would therefore be more\r\ndifficult to distinguish, it seems probable that with comparatively few\r\nexceptions, _at least_ two thousand adults of the same sex might be\r\nindividualised, merely by means of twelve careful measures, on the\r\nBertillon system, making reasonable allowances for that small change of\r\nproportions that occurs after the lapse of a few years, and for\r\ninaccuracies of measurement. This estimate may be far below the truth, but\r\nmore cannot, I think, be safely inferred from the above very limited\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nThe system of registration adopted in the American army for tracing\r\nsuspected deserters, was described in a memoir contributed to the\r\n\"International Congress of Demography,\" held in London in 1891. The memoir\r\nhas so far been only published in the _Abstracts of Papers_, p. 233 (Eyre\r\nand Spottiswoode). Its phraseology is unfortunately so curt as sometimes\r\nto be difficult to understand; it runs as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Personal identity as determined by scars and other body marks by\r\n    Colonel Charles R. Greenleaf and Major Charles Smart, Medical\r\n    Department, U.S. Army.\r\n\r\n    Desertions from United States army believed to greatly exceed\r\n    deserters, owing to repeaters.\r\n\r\n    Detection of repeaters possible if all body marks of all recruits\r\n    recorded, all deserters noted, and all recruits compared with previous\r\n    deserters.\r\n\r\n    In like manner men discharged for cause excluded from re-entry.\r\n\r\n    Bertillon's anthropometric method insufficient before courts-martial,\r\n    because possible inaccuracies in measurement, and because of allowable\r\n    errors.\r\n\r\n    But identity acknowledged following coincident indelible marks, when\r\n    height, age, and hair fairly correspond.\r\n\r\n    That is, Bertillon's collateral evidence is practically primary\r\n    evidence for such purposes.\r\n\r\n    There is used for each man an outline figure card giving anterior and\r\n    posterior surfaces, divided by dotted lines into regions.\r\n\r\n    These, showing each permanent mark, are filed alphabetically at the\r\n    Surgeon-General's office, War Department.\r\n\r\n    As a man goes out for cause, or deserts, his card is placed in a\r\n    separate file.\r\n\r\n    The cards of recruits are compared with the last-mentioned file.\r\n\r\n    To make this comparison, a register in two volumes is opened, one for\r\n    light-eyed and one for dark-eyed men. Each is subdivided into a fair\r\n    number of pages, according to height of entrants, and each page is\r\n    ruled in columns for body regions. Tattooed and non-tattooed men of\r\n    similar height and eyes are entered on opposite pages. Recruits\r\n    without tattoos are not compared with deserters with tattoos; but\r\n    recruits with tattoos are compared with both classes.\r\n\r\n    On the register S T B M, etc., are used as abbreviations for scar,\r\n    tattoo, birth-mark, mole, etc.\r\n\r\n    One inch each side of recorded height allowed for variation or\r\n    defective measurement.\r\n\r\n    When probability of identity appears, the original card is used for\r\n    comparison.\r\n\r\n    Owing to obstacles in inaugurating new system, its practical working\r\n    began with 1891, and, to include May 1891 [= 5 months, F.G.], out of\r\n    sixty-two cases of suspected fraud sixty-one proved real.\r\n\r\nThere was some interesting discussion, both upon this memoir and on a\r\nverbal communication concerning the French method, that had been made by\r\nM. Jacques Bertillon the statistician, who is a brother of its originator.\r\nIt appeared that there was room for doubt whether the anthropometric\r\nmethod had received a fair trial in America, the measurements being made\r\nby persons not specially trained, whereas in France the establishments,\r\nthough small, are thoroughly efficient.\r\n\r\nThere are almost always moles or birth-marks, serving for identification,\r\non the body of every one, and a record of these is, as already noted, an\r\nimportant though subsidiary part of the Bertillon system. Body-marks are\r\nnoted in the English registers of criminals, and it is curious how large a\r\nproportion of these men are tattooed and scarred. How far the body-marks\r\nadmit of being usefully charted on the American plan, it is difficult to\r\nsay, the success of the method being largely dependent on the care with\r\nwhich they are recorded. The number of persons hitherto dealt with on the\r\nAmerican plan appears not to be very large. As observations of this class\r\nrequire the person to be undressed, they are unsuitable for popular\r\npurposes of identification, but the marks have the merit of serving to\r\nidentify at all ages, which the measurements of the limbs have not.\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that no register of this kind, so far as I know, takes\r\naccount of the teeth. If a man, on being first registered, is deficient in\r\ncertain teeth, they are sure to be absent when he is examined on a future\r\noccasion. He may, and probably will in the meantime, have lost others, but\r\nthe fact of his being without specified teeth on the first occasion,\r\nexcludes the possibility of his being afterwards mistaken for a man who\r\nstill possesses them.\r\n\r\nWe will now separately summarise the results arrived at, in respect to the\r\ntwo processes that may both be needed in order to effect an\r\nidentification.\r\n\r\nFirst, as regards _search in an Index_.--Some sets of measures will give\r\ntrouble, but the greater proportion can apparently be catalogued with so\r\nmuch certainty, that if a second set of measures of any individual be\r\nafterwards taken, no tedious search will be needed to hunt out the former\r\nset. Including the bodily marks and photographs, let us rate the Bertillon\r\nmethod as able to cope with a register of 20,000 adults of the same sex,\r\nwith a small and definable, but as yet unknown, average dose of\r\ndifficulty, which we will call _x_.\r\n\r\nA catalogue of 500 sets of finger prints easily fulfils the same\r\nconditions. I could lay a fair claim to much more, but am content with\r\nthis. Now the finger patterns have been shown to be so independent of\r\nother conditions that they cannot be notably, if at all, correlated with\r\nthe bodily measurements or with any other feature, not the slightest\r\ntrace of any relation between them having yet been found, as will be shown\r\nat p. 186, and more fully in Chapter XII. For instance, it would be\r\ntotally impossible to fail to distinguish between the finger prints of\r\ntwins, who in other respects appeared exactly alike. Finger prints may\r\ntherefore be treated without the fear of any sensible error, as varying\r\nquite independently of the measures and records in the Bertillon system.\r\nTheir inclusion would consequently increase its power fully five-hundred\r\nfold. Suppose one moderate dose of difficulty, _x_, is enough for dealing\r\nwith the measurements, etc., of 20,000 adult persons of the same sex by\r\nthe Bertillon method, and a similar dose of difficulty with the finger\r\nprints of 500 persons, then two such doses could deal with a register of\r\n20,000 x 500, or 10,000,000.\r\n\r\nWe now proceed to consider the second and final process, namely, that of\r\nidentification by _Comparison_. When the data concerning a suspected\r\nperson are discovered to bear a general likeness to one of those already\r\non the register, and a minute comparison shows their finger prints to\r\nagree in all or nearly all particulars, the evidence thereby afforded that\r\nthey were made by the same person, far transcends in trustworthiness any\r\nother evidence that can ordinarily be obtained, and vastly exceeds all\r\nthat can be derived from any number of ordinary anthropometric data. _By\r\nitself it is amply sufficient to convict._ _Bertillonage_ can rarely\r\nsupply more than grounds for very strong suspicion: the method of finger\r\nprints affords certainty. It is easy, however, to understand that so long\r\nas the peculiarities of finger prints are not generally understood, a\r\njuryman would be cautious in accepting their evidence, but it is to be\r\nhoped that attention will now gradually become drawn to their marvellous\r\nvirtues, and that after their value shall have been established in a few\r\nconspicuous cases, it will come to be popularly recognised.\r\n\r\nLet us not forget two great and peculiar merits of finger prints; they are\r\nself-signatures, free from all possibility of faults in observation or of\r\nclerical error; and they apply throughout life.\r\n\r\nAn abstract of the remarks made by M. Herbette, Director of the\r\nPenitentiary Department of the Ministere de l'Interieur, France, at the\r\nInternational Penitentiary Congress at Rome, after the communication by M.\r\nAlphonse Bertillon had been read, may fitly follow.\r\n\r\n    \"Proceeding to a more extended view of the subject and praising the\r\n    successful efforts of M. Bertillon, M. Herbette pointed out how a\r\n    verification of the physical personality, and of the identity of\r\n    people of adult age, would fulfil requirements of modern society in an\r\n    indisputable manner under very varied conditions.\r\n\r\n    \"If it were a question, for instance, of giving to the inhabitants of\r\n    a country, to the soldiers of an army, or to travellers proceeding to\r\n    distant lands, notices or personal cards as recognisable signs,\r\n    enabling them always to prove who they are; if it were a question of\r\n    completing the obligatory records of civil life by perfectly sure\r\n    indications, such as would prevent all error, or substitution of\r\n    persons; if it were a question of recording the distinctive marks of\r\n    an individual in documents, titles or contracts, where his identity\r\n    requires to be established for his own interest, for that of third\r\n    parties, or for that of the State,--there the anthropometric system\r\n    of identification would find place.\r\n\r\n    \"Should it be a question of a life certificate, of a life assurance,\r\n    or of a proof of death, or should it be required to certify the\r\n    identity of a person who was insane, severely wounded, or of a dead\r\n    body that had been partly destroyed, or so disfigured as to be hardly\r\n    recognisable from a sudden or violent death due to crime, accident,\r\n    shipwreck, or battle--how great would be the advantage of being able\r\n    to trace these characters, unchangeable as they are in each\r\n    individual, infinitely variable as between one individual and another,\r\n    indelible, at least in part, even in death.\r\n\r\n    \"There is still more cause to be interested in this subject when it is\r\n    a question of identifying persons who are living at a great distance,\r\n    and after the lapse of a considerable time, when the physiognomy, the\r\n    features, and the physical habits may have changed from natural or\r\n    artificial causes, and to be able to identify them without taking a\r\n    journey and without cost, by the simple exchange of a few lines or\r\n    figures that may be sent from one country or continent to another, so\r\n    as to give information in America as to who any particular man is, who\r\n    has just arrived from France, and to certify whether a certain\r\n    traveller found in Rome is the same person who was measured in\r\n    Stockholm ten years before.\r\n\r\n    \"In one word, to fix the human personality, to give to each human\r\n    being an identity, an individuality that can be depended upon with\r\n    certainty, lasting, unchangeable, always recognisable and easily\r\n    adduced, this appears to be in the largest sense the aim of the new\r\n    method.\r\n\r\n    \"Consequently, it may be said that the extent of the problem, as well\r\n    as the importance of its solution, far exceeds the limits of\r\n    penitentiary work and the interest, which is however by no means\r\n    inconsiderable, that penal action has excited amongst various nations.\r\n    These are the motives for giving to the labours of M. Bertillon and to\r\n    their practical utilisation the publicity they merit.\"\r\n\r\nThese full and clear remarks seem even more applicable to the method of\r\nfinger prints than to that of anthropometry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nHEREDITY\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of those who have written on finger marks affirm that they are\r\ntransmissible by descent, others assert the direct contrary, but no\r\ninquiry hitherto appears to justify a definite conclusion.\r\n\r\nChapter VIII. shows a close correlation to exist between the patterns on\r\nthe several fingers of the same person. Hence we are justified in assuming\r\nthat the patterns are partly dependent on constitutional causes, in which\r\ncase it would indeed be strange if the general law of heredity failed in\r\nthis particular case.\r\n\r\nAfter examining many prints, the frequency with which some peculiar\r\npattern was found to characterise members of the same family convinced me\r\nof the reality of an hereditary tendency. The question was how to submit\r\nthe belief to numerical tests; particular kinships had to be selected, and\r\nmethods of discussion devised.\r\n\r\nIt must here be borne in mind that \"Heredity\" implies more than its\r\noriginal meaning of a relationship between parent and child. It includes\r\nthat which connects children of the same parents, and which I have shown\r\n(_Natural Inheritance_) to be just twice as close in the case of stature\r\nas that which connects a child and either of its two parents. Moreover,\r\nthe closeness of the fraternal and the filial relations are to a great\r\nextent interdependent, for in any population whose faculties remain\r\n_statistically_ the same during successive generations, it has been shown\r\nthat a simple algebraical equation must exist, that connects together the\r\nthree elements of Filial Relation, Fraternal Relation, and Regression, by\r\nwhich a knowledge of any two of them determines the value of the third. So\r\nfar as Regression may be treated as being constant in value, the Filial\r\nand the Fraternal relations become reciprocally connected. It is not\r\npossible briefly to give an adequate explanation of all this now, or to\r\nshow how strictly observations were found to confirm the theory; this has\r\nbeen fully done in _Natural Inheritance_, and the conclusions will here be\r\nassumed.\r\n\r\nThe fraternal relation, besides disclosing more readily than other\r\nkinships the existence or non-existence of heredity, is at the same time\r\nmore convenient, because it is easier to obtain examples of brothers and\r\nsisters alone, than with the addition of their father and mother. The\r\nresemblance between those who are twins is also an especially significant\r\nbranch of the fraternal relationship. The word \"fraternities\" will be used\r\nto include the children of both sexes who are born of the same parents; it\r\nbeing impossible to name the familiar kinship in question either in\r\nEnglish, French, Latin, or Greek, without circumlocution or using an\r\nincorrect word, thus affording a striking example of the way in which\r\nabstract thought outruns language, and its expression is hampered by the\r\ninadequacy of language. In this dilemma I prefer to fall upon the second\r\nhorn, that of incorrectness of phraseology, subject to the foregoing\r\nexplanation and definition.\r\n\r\nThe first preliminary experiments were made with the help of the\r\nArch-Loop-Whorl classification, on the same principle as that already\r\ndescribed and utilised in Chapter VIII., with the following addition. Each\r\nof the two members of any couplet of fingers has a distinctive name--for\r\ninstance, the couplet may consist of a finger and a thumb: or again, if it\r\nshould consist of two fore-fingers, one will be a right fore-finger and\r\nthe other a left one, but the two brothers in a couplet of brothers rank\r\nequally as such. The plan was therefore adopted of \"ear-marking\" the\r\nprints of the first of the two brothers that happened to come to hand,\r\nwith an A, and that of the second brother with a B; and so reducing the\r\nquestions to the shape:--How often does the pattern on the finger of a B\r\nbrother agree with that on the corresponding finger of an A brother? How\r\noften would it occur between two persons who had no family likeness? How\r\noften would it correspond if the kinship between A and B were as close as\r\nit is possible to conceive? Or transposing the questions, and using the\r\nsame words as in Chapter VIII., what is the relative frequency of (1)\r\nRandom occurrences, (2) Observed occurrences, (3) Utmost possibilities?\r\nIt was shown in that chapter how to find the value of (2) upon a\r\ncentesimal scale in which \"Randoms\" ranked as 0 deg. and \"Utmost\r\npossibilities\" as 100 deg.\r\n\r\nThe method there used of calculating the frequency of the \"Random\" events\r\nwill be accepted without hesitation by all who are acquainted with the\r\ntheory and the practice of problems of probability. Still, it is as well\r\nto occasionally submit calculation to test. The following example was sent\r\nto me for that purpose by a friend who, not being mathematically minded,\r\nhad demurred somewhat to the possibility of utilising the calculated\r\n\"Randoms.\"\r\n\r\nThe prints of 101 (by mistake for 100) couplets of prints of the right\r\nfore-fingers of school children were taken by him from a large collection,\r\nthe two members, A and B, being picked out at random and formed into a\r\ncouplet. It was found that among the A children there were 22 arches, 50\r\nloops, and 29 whorls, and among the B children 25, 34, and 42\r\nrespectively, as is shown by the _italic_ numerals in the last column, and\r\nagain in the bottom row of Table XX. The remainder of the table shows the\r\nnumber of times in which an arch, loop, or whorl of an A child was\r\nassociated with an arch, loop, or whorl of a B child.\r\n\r\nTABLE XX.\r\n\r\n_Observed Random Couplets._\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |             |       A children.      |  Totals in  |\r\n  | B children. |------------------------| B children. |\r\n  |             | Arches.| Loops.|Whorls.|             |\r\n  |-------------|--------|-------|-------|-------------|\r\n  | Arches      |    5   |   12  |    8  |     _25_    |\r\n  | Loops       |    8   |   18  |    8  |     _34_    |\r\n  | Whorls      |    9   |   20  |   13  |     _42_    |\r\n  |-------------|--------|-------|-------|-------------|\r\n  |Totals in A} |        |       |       |             |\r\n  |  children } |  _22_  |  _50_ |  _29_ |     101     |\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nTABLE XXI.\r\n\r\n_Calculated Random Couplets._\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |             |       A children.      |  Totals in  |\r\n  | B children. |------------------------| B children. |\r\n  |             | Arches.| Loops.|Whorls.|             |\r\n  |-------------|--------|-------|-------|-------------|\r\n  | Arches      |  5.00  | 12.50 |  7.25 |     _25_    |\r\n  | Loops       |  6.80  | 17.00 |  9.86 |     _34_    |\r\n  | Whorls      |  8.40  | 21.00 | 12.18 |     _42_    |\r\n  |-------------|--------|-------|-------|-------------|\r\n  |Totals in A} |        |       |       |             |\r\n  |  children } |  _22_  |  _50_ |  _29_ |     101     |\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThe question, then, was how far calculations from the above data would\r\ncorrespond with the contents of Table XX. The answer is that it does so\r\nadmirably. Multiply each of the italicised A totals into each of the\r\nitalicised B totals, and after dividing each result by 101, enter it in\r\nthe square at which the column that has the A total at its base, is\r\nintersected by the row that has the B total at its side. We thus obtain\r\nTable XXI.\r\n\r\nWe will now discuss in order the following relationships: the Fraternal,\r\nfirst in the ordinary sense, and then in the special case of twins of the\r\nsame set; Filial, in the special case in which both parents have the same\r\nparticular pattern on the same finger; lastly, the relative influence of\r\nthe father and mother in transmitting their patterns.\r\n\r\n_Fraternal relationship._--In 105 fraternities the _observed_ figures were\r\nas in Table XXII.:--\r\n\r\nTABLE XXII.\r\n\r\n_Observed Fraternal Couplets._\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |              |      A children.     |   Totals in  |\r\n  | B children.  |----------------------|  B children. |\r\n  |              |Arches.|Loops.|Whorls.|              |\r\n  |--------------|-------|------|-------|--------------|\r\n  |Arches        |   5   |  12  |   2   |      _19_    |\r\n  |              |-------+------|       |              |\r\n  |Loops         |   4   |  42  |  15   |      _61_    |\r\n  |              |-------|------|-------|              |\r\n  |Whorls        |   1   |  14  |  10   |      _25_    |\r\n  |--------------|-------+------+-------|--------------|\r\n  |Totals in A } |       |      |       |              |\r\n  |  children  } | _10_  | _68_ | _27_  |      105     |\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThe squares that run diagonally from the top at the left, to the bottom at\r\nthe right, contain the double events, and it is with these that we are\r\nnow concerned.

The calculated Randoms are shown in the first line\r\nof Table XXIII., the third line gives the greatest feasible number of\r\ncorrespondences which would occur if the kinship were as close as\r\npossible, subject to the reservation explained in p. 127.

L. W.\r\nsystem being somewhat artificial.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE 16.\r\n\r\nFIG. 24. The \"C\" set of standard patterns, for prints of the Right Hand.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the view of obtaining a more satisfactory result the patterns were\r\nsubdivided under fifty-three heads, and an experiment was made with the\r\nfore, middle, and ring-fingers of 150 fraternal couplets (300\r\nindividuals and 900 digits) by Mr. F. Howard Collins, who kindly undertook\r\nthe considerable labour of indexing and tabulating them.\r\n\r\nThe provisional list of standard patterns published in the _Phil. Trans._\r\nwas not appropriate for this purpose. It related chiefly to thumbs, and\r\nconsequently omitted the tented arch; it also referred to the left hand,\r\nbut in the following tabulations the right hand has been used; and its\r\nnumbering is rather inconvenient. The present set of fifty-three patterns\r\nhas faults, and cannot be considered in any way as final, but it was\r\nsuitable for our purposes and may be convenient to others; as Mr. Collins\r\nworked wholly by it, it may be distinguished as the \"C. set.\" The banded\r\npatterns, 24-31, are very rarely found on the fingers, but being common on\r\nthe thumb, were retained, on the chance of our requiring the introduction\r\nof thumb patterns into the tabulations. The numerals refer to the patterns\r\nas seen in impressions of the _right hand_ only. [They would be equally\r\ntrue for the patterns as seen on the _fingers themselves_ of the left\r\nhand.] For impressions of the left hand the numerals up to 7 inclusive\r\nwould be the same, but those of all the rest would be changed. These are\r\narranged in couplets, the one member of the couplet being a reversed\r\npicture of the other, those in each couplet being distinguished by\r\nseverally bearing an odd and an even number. Therefore, in impressions of\r\nthe left hand, 8 would have to be changed into 9, and 9 into 8; 10 into\r\n11, and 11 into 10; and so on, up to the end, viz. 52 and 53. The numeral\r\n54 was used to express nondescript patterns.\r\n\r\nThe finger prints had to be gone through repeatedly, some weeks elapsing\r\nbetween the inspections, and under conditions which excluded the\r\npossibility of unconscious bias; a subject of frequent communication\r\nbetween Mr. Collins and myself. Living at a distance apart, it was not\r\neasy at the time they were made, to bring our respective interpretations\r\nof transitional and of some of the other patterns, especially the invaded\r\nloops, into strict accordance, so I prefer to keep his work, in which I\r\nhave perfect confidence, independent from my own. Whenever a fraternity\r\nconsisted of more than two members, they were divided, according to a\r\nprearranged system, into as many couplets as there were individuals. Thus,\r\nwhile a fraternity of three individuals furnished all of its three\r\npossible varieties of couplets, (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), one of four\r\nindividuals was not allowed to furnish more than four of its possible\r\ncouplets, the two italicised ones being omitted, (1, 2), (1, 3), (_1, 4_),\r\n(_2, 3_), (2, 4), (3, 4), and so on. Without this precaution, a single\r\nvery large family might exercise a disproportionate and even overwhelming\r\nstatistical influence.\r\n\r\nIt would be essential to exact working, that the mutual relations of the\r\npatterns should be taken into account; for example, suppose an arch to be\r\nfound on the fore-finger of one brother and a nascent loop on that of the\r\nother; then, as these patterns are evidently related, their concurrence\r\nought to be interpreted as showing some degree of resemblance. However,\r\nit was impossible to take cognizance of partial resemblances, the mutual\r\nrelations of the patterns not having, as yet, been determined with\r\nadequate accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe completed tabulations occupied three large sheets, one for each of the\r\nfingers, ruled crossways into fifty-three vertical columns for the A\r\nbrothers, and fifty-three horizontal rows for the B brothers. Thus, if the\r\nregister number of the pattern of A was 10, and that of B was 42, then a\r\nmark would be put in the square limited by the ninth and tenth horizontal\r\nlines, and by the forty-first and forty-second vertical ones. The marks\r\nwere scattered sparsely over the sheet. Those in each square were then\r\nadded up, and finally the numbers in each of the rows and in each of the\r\ncolumns were severally totalled.\r\n\r\nIf the number of couplets had been much greater than they are, a test of\r\nthe accuracy with which their patterns had been classed under the\r\nappropriate heads, would be found in the frequency with which the same\r\npatterns were registered in the corresponding finger of the A and B\r\nbrothers. The A and B groups are strictly homogeneous, consequently the\r\nfrequency of their patterns in corresponding fingers ought to be alike.\r\nThe success with which this test has been fulfilled in the present case,\r\nis passably good, its exact degree being shown in the following\r\nparagraphs, where the numbers of entries under each head are arranged in\r\nas orderly a manner as the case admits, the smaller of the two numbers\r\nbeing the one that stands first, whether it was an A or a B. All instances\r\nin which there were at least five entries under either A or B, are\r\nincluded; the rest being disregarded. The result is as follows:--\r\n\r\n    I. Thirteen cases of more or less congruity between the number of A\r\n    and B entries under the same head:--5-7; 5-7; 5-8; 6-8; 7-10; 8-9;\r\n    8-12; 9-12; 10-10; 11-13; 12-16; 14-18; 72-73. (This last refers to\r\n    loops on the middle finger.)\r\n\r\n    II. Six cases of more or less incongruity:--1-7; 6-12; 14-20; 14-22;\r\n    22-35; 39-50.\r\n\r\nThe three Tables, XXIV., XXV., XXVI., contain the results of the\r\ntabulations and the deductions from them.\r\n\r\nTABLE XXIV.\r\n\r\n_Comparison of three Fingers of the Right Hand in 150 Fraternal Couplets._\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |

read thus,\r\nbeginning at the first entry. Pattern No. 1 occurs on the right\r\nfore-finger fifteen times among the A brothers, and twelve times among the\r\nB brothers; while in four of these cases both brothers have that same\r\npattern.\r\n\r\nTable XXV. compares the Random events with the Observed ones. Every case\r\nin which the calculated expectation is equal to or exceeds 0.05, is\r\ninserted in detail; the remaining group of petty cases are summed together\r\nand their totals entered in the bottom line. For fear of misapprehension\r\nor forgetfulness, one other example of the way in which the Randoms are\r\ncalculated will be given here, taking for the purpose the first entry in\r\nTable XXIV. Thus, the number of all the different combinations of the 150\r\nA with the 150 B individuals in the 150 couplets, is 150 x 150. Out of\r\nthese, the number of double events in which pattern No. 1 would appear in\r\nthe same combination, is 15 x 12 = 180. Therefore in 150 trials, the\r\ndouble event of pattern No. 1 would appear upon the average, on 180\r\ndivided by 150, or on 1.20 occasions. As a matter of fact, it appeared\r\nfour times. These figures will be found in the first line of Table XXV.;\r\nthe rest of its contents have been calculated in the same way.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the Randoms that exceed 0 but are less than 1, there are\r\nnineteen cases in which the Random may be compared with the Observed\r\nvalues; in all but two of these the Observed are the highest, and in these\r\ntwo the Random exceed the Observed by only trifling amounts, namely, 5.18\r\nRandom against 5.00 Observed; 1.87 Random against 1.00 Observed. It is\r\nimpossible, therefore, to doubt from the steady way in which the Observed\r\nvalues overtop the Randoms, that there is a greater average likeness in\r\nthe finger marks of two brothers, than in those of two persons taken at\r\nhazard.\r\n\r\nTable XXVI. gives the results of applying the centesimal scale to the\r\nmeasurement of the average closeness of fraternal resemblance, in respect\r\nto finger prints, according to the method and under the reservations\r\nalready explained in page 125. The average value thus assigned to it is a\r\nlittle more than 10 deg. The values obtained from the three fingers\r\nseverally, from which that average was derived, are 9 deg., 10 deg., and 12 deg.; they\r\nagree together better than might have been expected. The value obtained\r\nfrom a set of fifty additional couplets of the middle fingers only, of\r\nfraternals, is wider, being 21 deg. Its inclusion with the rest raises the\r\naverage of all to between 10 and 11.\r\n\r\nIn the pre-eminently frequent event of loops with an outward slope on the\r\nmiddle finger, it is remarkable that the Random cases are nearly equal to\r\nthe Observed ones; they are 34.08 to 35.00. It was to obtain some\r\nassurance that this equality was not due to statistical accident, that the\r\nadditional set of fifty couplets were tabulated. They tell, however, the\r\nsame tale, viz. 6.4 Randoms to 7.0 Observed. The loops on the fore-fingers\r\nconfirm this, showing 5.18 Randoms to 5.00 Observed; those on the\r\nring-finger have the same peculiarity, though in a slighter degree, 13 to\r\n16: the average of other patterns shows a much greater difference than\r\nthat. I am unable to account for this curious behaviour of the loops,\r\nwhich can hardly be due to statistical accident, in the face of so much\r\nconcurrent evidence.\r\n\r\n_Twins._--The signs of heredity between brothers and sisters ought to be\r\nespecially apparent between twins of the same sex, who are physiologically\r\nrelated in a peculiar degree and are sometimes extraordinarily alike. More\r\nrarely, they are remarkably dissimilar. The instances of only a moderate\r\nfamily resemblance between twins of the same sex are much less frequent\r\nthan between ordinary brothers and sisters, or between twins of opposite\r\nsex. All this has been discussed in my _Human Faculty_. In order to test\r\nthe truth of the expectation, I procured prints of the fore, middle, and\r\nring-fingers of seventeen sets of twins, and compared them, with the\r\nresults shown in Table XXVII.\r\n\r\nTABLE XXVII.\r\n\r\n17 SETS OF TWINS (A and B).\r\n\r\n_Comparison between the patterns on the Fore, Middle, and Ring-fingers\r\nrespectively of the Right hand._\r\n\r\nAgreement (=), 19 cases; partial (..), 13 cases; disagreement (x), 19\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |      | A     B  |    A     B  | A     B  | A     B  | A     B  |\r\n  |----------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n  |Fore  | 42 =  42 |    21 =  21 | 40 =  40 |  6 =   6 |  1 =   1 |\r\n  |Middle| 42 =  42 |     8 =   8 | 32 x  42 | 15 .. 32 | 42 =  42 |\r\n  |Ring  | 42 =  42 |     8 =   8 | 42 =  42 | 33 =  33 | 40 x  19 |\r\n  |      |          |             |          |          |          |\r\n  |Fore  | 42 =  42 |    43 x  15 |  1 =   1 | 15 x  34 |  2 .. 42 |\r\n  |Middle| 42 =  42 |    42 .. 40 |  1 x  40 | 42 =  42 | 42 =  42 |\r\n  |Ring  | 42 .. 46 |    35 =  35 | 40 .. 42 | 14 x  32 | 42 x  14 |\r\n  |      |          |             |          |          |          |\r\n  |Fore  | 49 .. 14 |    15 x  49 | 15 .. 16 |  1 x  42 |  1 x  15 |\r\n  |Middle| 42 =  42 |    23 x  14 | 19 x  42 | 42 .. 48 | 32 x  22 |\r\n  |Ring  |  9 .. 32 |    14 .. 16 |  6 .. 18 | 42 x   8 | 18 x  23 |\r\n  |      |          |             |          |          |          |\r\n  |Fore  | 48 x  33 |(loop) x   9 |          |          |          |\r\n  |Middle| 42 x  22 |    48 x  22 |          |          |          |\r\n  |Ring  | 14 ..  6 |     9 .. 35 |          |          |          |\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThe result is that out of the seventeen sets (=51 couplets), two sets\r\nagree in all their three couplets of fingers; four sets agree in two; five\r\nsets agree in one of the couplets. There are instances of partial\r\nagreement in five others, and a disagreement throughout in only one of the\r\nseventeen sets. In another collection of seventeen sets, made to compare\r\nwith this, six agreed in two of their three couplets, and five agreed in\r\none of them. There cannot then be the slightest doubt as to the strong\r\ntendency to resemblance in the finger patterns in twins.\r\n\r\nThis remark must by no means be forced into the sense of meaning that the\r\nsimilarity is so great, that the finger print of one twin might\r\noccasionally be mistaken for that of the other. When patterns fall into\r\nthe same class, their general forms may be conspicuously different (see p.\r\n74), while their smaller details, namely, the number of ridges and the\r\nminutiae, are practically independent of the pattern.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned that I have an inquiry in view, which has not yet been\r\nfairly begun, owing to the want of sufficient data, namely to determine\r\nthe minutest biological unit that may be hereditarily transmissible. The\r\nminutiae in the finger prints of twins seem suitable objects for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n_Children of like-patterned Parents._--When two parents are alike, the\r\naverage resemblance, in stature at all events, which their children bear\r\nto them, is as close as the fraternal resemblance between the children,\r\nand twice as close as that which the children bear to either parent\r\nseparately, when the parents are unlike.\r\n\r\nThe fifty-eight parentages affording fifty couplets of the fore, middle,\r\nand ring-fingers respectively give 58 x 3 = 174 parental couplets in all;\r\nof these, 27 or 14 per cent are alike in their pattern, as shown by Table\r\nXXVIII. The total number of children to these twenty-seven pairs is 109,\r\nof which 59 (or 54 per cent) have the same pattern as their parents. This\r\nfact requires analysis, as on account of the great frequency of loops, and\r\nespecially of the pattern No. 42 on the middle finger, a large number of\r\nthe cases of similarity of pattern between child and parents would be mere\r\nrandom coincidences.\r\n\r\nTABLE XXVIII.--_Children of like-patterned Parents._\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  | The 27 | Patterns of--  F.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThere are nineteen cases of both parents having the commonest of the loop\r\npatterns, No. 42, on a corresponding finger. They have between them\r\nseventy-five children, of whom forty-eight have the pattern No. 42, on the\r\nsame finger as their parents, and eighteen others have loops of other\r\nkinds on that same finger, making a total of sixty-six coincidences out of\r\nthe possible 75, or 88 per cent, which is a great increase upon the normal\r\nproportion of loops of the No. 42 pattern in the fore, middle, and\r\nring-fingers collectively. Again, there are three cases of both parents\r\nhaving a tendrilled-loop No. 15, which ranks as a whorl. Out of their\r\ntotal number of seventeen children, eleven have whorls and only six have\r\nloops.\r\n\r\nLastly, there is a single case of both parents having an arch, and all\r\ntheir three children have arches; whereas in the total of 109 children in\r\nthe table, there are only four other cases of an arch.\r\n\r\nThis partial analysis accounts for the whole of the like-patterned\r\nparents, except four couples, which are one of No. 34, two of No. 40, and\r\none of No. 46. These concur in telling the same general tale, recollecting\r\nthat No. 46 might almost be reckoned as a transitional case between a loop\r\nand a whorl.\r\n\r\nThe decided tendency to hereditary transmission cannot be gainsaid in the\r\nface of these results, but the number of cases is too few to justify\r\nquantitative conclusions. It is not for the present worth while to extend\r\nthem, for the reason already mentioned, namely, an ignorance of the\r\nallowance that ought to be made for related patterns. On this account it\r\ndoes not seem useful to print the results of a large amount of tabulation\r\nbearing on the simple filial relationship between the child and either\r\nparent separately, except so far as appears in the following paragraph.\r\n\r\n_Relative Influence of the Father and the Mother._--Through one of those\r\nstatistical accidents which are equivalent to long runs of luck at a\r\ngaming table, a concurrence in the figures brought out by Mr. Collins\r\nsuggested to him the existence of a decided preponderance of maternal\r\ninfluence in the hereditary transmission of finger patterns. His further\r\ninquiries have, however, cast some doubt on earlier and provisional\r\nconclusions, and the following epitomises all of value that can as yet be\r\nsaid in favour of the superiority of the maternal influence.\r\n\r\nThe fore, middle, and ring-fingers of the right hands of the father,\r\nmother, and all their accessible children, in many families, were\r\nseverally tabulated under the fifty-three heads already specified. The\r\ntotal number of children was 389, namely 136 sons and 219 daughters. The\r\nsame pattern was found on the same finger, both of a child and of one or\r\nother of his parents, in the following number of cases:--\r\n\r\nTABLE XXIX.\r\n\r\n_Relative Influence of Father and Mother._\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                     |Fore.|Middle.|Ring.|| Totals. | Corrected |     |\r\n  |                     |     |       |     ||         |   Totals. |     |\r\n  |---------------------|-----|-------|-----||---------|-----------|-----|\r\n  | Father and son      | 17  |  35   | 28  ||   80    |     80    |}149 |\r\n  |   \"     \"  daughter | 29  |  52   | 30  || (111)   |     69    |}    |\r\n  |                     |     |       |     ||         |           |     |\r\n  | Mother and son      | 18  |  50   | 26  ||   94    |     94    |}186 |\r\n  |   \"     \"  daughter | 38  |  75   | 35  || (148)   |     92    |}    |\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThe entries in the first three columns are not comparable on equal terms,\r\non account of the large difference between the numbers of the sons and\r\ndaughters. This difference is easily remedied by multiplying the number of\r\ndaughters by 136/219, that is by 0.621, as has been done in the fifth\r\ncolumn headed Corrected Totals. It would appear from these figures, that\r\nthe maternal influence is more powerful than the paternal in the\r\nproportion of 186 to 149, or as 5 to 4; but, as some of the details from\r\nwhich the totals are built up, vary rather widely, it is better for the\r\npresent to reserve an opinion as to their trustworthiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nRACES AND CLASSES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe races whose finger prints I have studied in considerable numbers are\r\nEnglish, pure Welsh, Hebrew, and Negro; also some Basques from Cambo in\r\nthe French Pyrenees, twenty miles south-east of Bayonne. For the Welsh\r\nprints I am primarily indebted to the very obliging help of Mr. R. W.\r\nAtkinson, of Cardiff, who interested the masters of schools in purely\r\nWelsh-speaking mountainous districts on my behalf; for the Hebrew prints\r\nto Mr. Isidore Spielman, who introduced me to the great Hebrew schools in\r\nLondon, whose head-masters gave cordial assistance; and for the Negro\r\nprints to Sir George Taubman Goldie, Dep. Governor of the Royal Niger Co.,\r\nwho interested Dr Crosse on my behalf, from whom valuable sets of prints\r\nwere received, together with particulars of the races of the men from whom\r\nthey were made. As to the Basques, they were printed by myself.\r\n\r\nIt requires considerable patience and caution to arrive at trustworthy\r\nconclusions, but it may emphatically be said that there is no _peculiar_\r\npattern which characterises persons of any of the above races. There is\r\nno particular pattern that is special to any one of them, which when met\r\nwith enables us to assert, or even to suspect, the nationality of the\r\nperson on whom it appeared. The only differences so far observed, are\r\nstatistical, and cannot be determined except through patience and caution,\r\nand by discussing large groups.\r\n\r\nI was misled at first by some accidental observations, and as it seemed\r\nreasonable to expect to find racial differences in finger marks, the\r\ninquiries were continued in varied ways until hard fact had made hope no\r\nlonger justifiable.\r\n\r\nAfter preliminary study, I handed over the collection of racial finger\r\nprints to Mr F. Howard Collins, who kindly undertook the labour of\r\ntabulating them in many ways, of which it will be only necessary to give\r\nan example. Thus, at one time attention was concentrated on a single\r\nfinger and a single pattern, the most instructive instance being that of\r\narches on the right fore-finger. They admit of being defined with\r\nsufficient clearness, having only one doubtful frontier of much\r\nimportance, namely that at which they begin to break away into\r\nnascent-loops, etc. They also occur with considerable frequency on the\r\nfore-finger, so the results from a few hundred specimens ought to be\r\nfairly trustworthy. It mattered little in the inquiry, at what level the\r\nlimit was drawn to separate arches from nascent-loops, so long as the same\r\nlimit was observed in all races alike. Much pains were taken to secure\r\nuniformity of treatment, and Mr. Collins selected two limits, the one\r\nbased on a strict and the other on a somewhat less strict interpretation\r\nof the term \"arches,\" but the latter was not so liberal as that which I\r\nhad used myself in the earlier inquiries (see p. 114). His results showed\r\nno great difference in the proportionate frequency of arches in the\r\ndifferent races, whichever limit was observed; the following table refers\r\nto the more liberal limit:--\r\n\r\nTABLE XXX.\r\n\r\n_Frequency of Arches in the Right Fore-Finger._\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |  No. of  |             Race.                |  No. of | Per Cents. |\r\n  | Persons. |                                  | Arches. |            |\r\n  |----------|----------------------------------|---------|------------|\r\n  |    250   | English                          |    34   |   13.6     |\r\n  |    250   | Welsh                            |    26   |   10.8     |\r\n  |   1332   | Hebrew                           |   105   |    7.9     |\r\n  |    250   | Negro                            |    27   |   11.3     |\r\n  |          |                                  |         |            |\r\n  |          |       _Hebrews in detail_--      |         |            |\r\n  |    500   | Boys, Bell Lane School           |    35   |    7.0     |\r\n  |    400   | Girls, Bell Lane School          |    34   |    8.5     |\r\n  |    220   | Boys, Tavistock St. & Hanway St. |    18   |    8.2     |\r\n  |    212   | Girls, Hanway Street School      |    18   |    8.5     |\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThe two contrasted values here are the English and the Hebrew. The 1332\r\ncases of the latter give a percentage result of 7.9, which differs as may\r\nbe seen less than 1 per cent from that of any one of the four large groups\r\nupon which the average is based. The 250 cases of English are\r\ncomparatively few, but the experience I have had of other English prints\r\nis so large as to enable me to say confidently that the percentage result\r\nof 13.6 is not too great. It follows, that the percentage of arches in the\r\nEnglish and in the Hebrew differs in the ratio of 13.6 to 7.9, or nearly\r\nas 5 to 3. This is the largest statistical difference yet met with. The\r\ndeficiency in arches among the Hebrews, and to some extent in loops also,\r\nis made up by a superiority in whorls, chiefly of the tendril or\r\ncirclet-in-loop patterns.\r\n\r\nIt would be very rash to suppose that this relative infrequency of arches\r\namong the Hebrews was of fundamental importance, considering that such\r\ntotally distinct races as the Welsh and the Negro have them in an\r\nintermediate proportion. Still, why does it occur? The only answer I can\r\nsuggest is that the patterns being in some degree hereditary, such\r\naccidental preponderances as may have existed among a not very numerous\r\nancestry might be perpetuated. I have some reason to believe that local\r\npeculiarities of this sort exist in England, the children in schools of\r\nsome localities seeming to be statistically more alike in their patterns\r\nthan English children generally.\r\n\r\nAnother of the many experiments was the tabulation separately by Mr.\r\nCollins of the fore, middle, and ring-fingers of the right hand of fifty\r\npersons of each of the five races above-mentioned: English, Welsh, Basque,\r\nHebrew, and different groups of Negroes. The number of instances is of\r\ncourse too small for statistical deductions, but they served to make it\r\nclear that no very marked characteristic distinguished the races. The\r\nimpressions from Negroes betray the general clumsiness of their fingers,\r\nbut their patterns are not, so far as I can find, different from those of\r\nothers, they are not simpler as judged either by their contours or by the\r\nnumber of origins, embranchments, islands, and enclosures contained in\r\nthem. Still, whether it be from pure fancy on my part, or from the way in\r\nwhich they were printed, or from some real peculiarity, the general aspect\r\nof the Negro print strikes me as characteristic. The width of the ridges\r\nseems more uniform, their intervals more regular, and their courses more\r\nparallel than with us. In short, they give an idea of greater simplicity,\r\ndue to causes that I have not yet succeeded in submitting to the test of\r\nmeasurement.\r\n\r\nThe above are only a few examples of the laborious work so kindly\r\nundertaken for me by Mr. F. H. Collins, but it would serve no useful\r\npurpose to give more in this book, as no positive results have as yet been\r\nderived from it other than the little already mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe most hopeful direction in which this inquiry admits of being pursued\r\nis among the Hill tribes of India, Australian blacks, and other diverse\r\nand so-called aboriginal races. The field of ethnology is large, and it\r\nwould be unwise as yet to neglect the chance of somewhere finding\r\ncharacteristic patterns.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDifferences between finger prints of different classes might continue to\r\nexist although those of different races are inconspicuous, because every\r\nrace contains men of various temperaments and faculties, and we cannot\r\ntell, except by observation, whether any of these are correlated with the\r\nfinger marks. Several different classes have been examined both by Mr.\r\nCollins and myself. The ordinary laboratory work supplies finger prints of\r\npersons of much culture, and of many students both in the Art and in the\r\nScience schools. I took a large number of prints from the worst idiots in\r\nthe London district, through the obliging assistance of Dr. Fletcher\r\nBeech, of the Darenth Asylum; my collections made at Board Schools are\r\nnumerous, and I have one of field labourers in Dorsetshire and\r\nSomersetshire. But there is no notable difference in any of them. For\r\nexample; the measurements of the ridge-interval gave the same results in\r\nthe art-students and in the science-students, and I have prints of eminent\r\nthinkers and of eminent statesmen that can be matched by those of\r\ncongenital idiots.[5] No indications of temperament, character, or ability\r\nare to be found in finger marks, so far as I have been able to discover.\r\n\r\nOf course these conclusions must not be applied to the general shape of\r\nthe hand, which as yet I have not studied, but which seems to offer a very\r\ninteresting field for exact inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nGENERA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same familiar patterns recur in every large collection of finger\r\nprints, and the eye soon selects what appear to be typical forms; but are\r\nthey truly \"typical\" or not? By a type I understand an ideal form around\r\nwhich the actual forms are grouped, very closely in its immediate\r\nneighbourhood, and becoming more rare with increasing rapidity at an\r\nincreasing distance from it, just as is the case with shot marks to the\r\nright or left of a line drawn vertically through the bull's eye of a\r\ntarget. The analogy is exact; in both cases there is a well-defined point\r\nof departure; in both cases the departure of individual instances from\r\nthat point is due to a multitude of independently variable causes. In\r\nshort, both are realisations of the now well-known theoretical law of\r\nFrequency of Error. The problem then is this:--take some one of the\r\nwell-marked patterns, such as it appears on a particular digit,--say a\r\nloop on the right thumb; find the average number of ridges that cross a\r\nspecified portion of it; then this average value will determine an ideal\r\ncentre from which individual departures may be measured; next, tabulate\r\nthe frequency of the departures that attain to each of many successive\r\nspecified distances from that ideal centre; then see whether their\r\ndiminishing frequency as the distances increase, is or is not in\r\naccordance with the law of frequency of error. If it is, then the central\r\nform has the attributes of a true type, and such will be shown to be the\r\ncase with the loops of either thumb. I shall only give the data and the\r\nresults, not the precise way in which they are worked out, because an\r\naccount of the method employed in similar cases will be found in _Natural\r\nInheritance_, and again in the Memoir on Finger Prints in the _Phil.\r\nTrans._; it is too technical to be appropriate here, and would occupy too\r\nmuch space. The only point which need be briefly explained and of which\r\nnon-mathematical readers might be ignorant, is how a single numerical\r\ntable derived from abstract calculations can be made to apply to such\r\nminute objects as finger prints, as well as to the shot marks on a huge\r\ntarget; what is the common unit by which departures on such different\r\nscales are measured? The answer is that it is a self-contained unit\r\nappropriate to _each series severally_, and technically called the\r\nProbable Error, or more briefly, P.E., in the headings to the following\r\ntables. In order to determine it, the range of the central half of the\r\nseries has to be measured, namely, of that part of the series which\r\nremains after its two extreme quarters have been cut off and removed. The\r\nseries had no limitation before, its two ends tailing away indefinitely\r\ninto nothingness, but, by the artifice of lopping off a definite fraction\r\nof the whole series from both ends of it, a sharply-defined length, call\r\nit PQ, is obtained. Such series as have usually to be dealt with are\r\nfairly symmetrical, so the position of the half-way point M, between P and\r\nQ, corresponds with rough accuracy to the average of the positions of all\r\nthe members of the series, that is to the point whence departures have to\r\nbe measured. MP, or MQ,--or still better, 1/2(MP + MQ) is the\r\nabove-mentioned Probable Error. It is so called because the amount of\r\nError, or Departure from M of any one observation, falls just as often\r\nwithin the distance PE as it falls without it. In the calculated tables of\r\nthe Law of Frequency, PE (or a multiple of it) is taken as unity. In each\r\nobserved series, the actual measures have to be converted into another\r\nscale, in which the PE of that series is taken as unity. Then observation\r\nand calculation may be compared on equal terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nObservations were made on the loops of the right and left thumbs\r\nrespectively. AHB is taken as the primary line of reference in the loop;\r\nit is the line that, coinciding with the axis of the _uppermost portion_,\r\nand that only, of the core, cuts the summit of the core at H, the upper\r\noutline at A, and the lower outline, if it cuts it at all, as it nearly\r\nalways does, at B. K is the centre of the single triangular plot that\r\nappears in the loop, which may be either I or O. KNL is a perpendicular\r\nfrom K to the axis, cutting it at N, and the outline beyond at L. In some\r\nloops N will lie above H, as in Plate 4, Fig. 8; in some it may coincide\r\nwith H. (See Plate 6 for numerous varieties of loop.) These points were\r\npricked in each print with a fine needle; the print was then turned face\r\ndownwards and careful measurements made between the prick holes at the\r\nback. Also the number of ridges in AH were counted, the ridge at A being\r\nreckoned as 0, the next ridge as 1, and so on up to H. Whenever the line\r\nAH passed across the neck of a bifurcation, there was necessarily a single\r\nridge on one side of the point of intersection and two ridges on the\r\nother, so there would clearly be doubt whether to reckon the neck as one\r\nor as two ridges. A compromise was made by counting it as 1-1/2. After the\r\nnumber of ridges in AH had been counted in each case, any residual\r\nfractions of 1/2 were alternately treated as 0 and as 1. Finally, six\r\nseries were obtained; three for the right thumb, and three for the left.\r\nThey referred respectively (1) to the Number of Ridges in AH; (2) to\r\nKL/NB; (3) to AN/AH, all the three being independent of stature. The\r\nnumber of measures in each of the six series varied from 140 to 176; they\r\nare reduced to percentages in Table XXXI.\r\n\r\nWe see at a glance that the different numbers of ridges in AH do not occur\r\nwith equal frequency, that a single ridge in the thumb is a rarity, and so\r\nare cases above fifteen in number, but those of seven, eight, and nine\r\nare frequent. There is clearly a rude order in their distribution, the\r\nnumber of cases tailing away into nothingness, at the top and bottom of\r\nthe column. A vast amount of statistical analogy assures us that the\r\norderliness of the distribution would be increased if many more cases had\r\nbeen observed, and later on, this inference will be confirmed. There is a\r\nsharp inferior limit to the numbers of ridges, because they cannot be less\r\nthan 0, but independently of this, we notice the infrequency of small\r\nnumbers as well as of large ones. There is no strict limit to the latter,\r\nbut the trend of the entries shows that forty, say, or more ridges in AH\r\nare practically impossible. Therefore, in no individual case can the\r\nnumber of ridges in AH depart very widely from seven, eight, or nine,\r\nthough the range of possible departures is not sharply defined, except at\r\nthe lower limit of 0. The range of variation is _not_ \"rounded off,\" to\r\nuse a common but very inaccurate expression often applied to the way in\r\nwhich genera are isolated. The range of possible departures is not defined\r\nby any rigid boundary, but the rarity of the stragglers rapidly increases\r\nwith the distance at which they are found, until no more of them are met\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nThe values of KL/NB and of AN/AH run in a less orderly sequence, but\r\nconcur distinctly in telling a similar tale. Considering the paucity of\r\nthe observations, there is nothing in these results to contradict the\r\nexpectation of increased regularity, should a large addition be made to\r\ntheir

Each of the six pairs of columns contain,\r\nside by side, the Observed and Calculated values of one of the six series,\r\nthe data on which the calculations were made being also entered at the\r\ntop. The calculated figures agree with the observed ones very respectably\r\nthroughout, as can be judged even by those who are ignorant of the\r\nprinciples of the method. Let us take the value that 10 per cent of each\r\nof the six series falls short of, and 90 per cent exceed; they are entered\r\nin the line opposite 10; we find for the six pairs successively,\r\n\r\n  _Obs._:  5.5   4.8   0.64   0.59   0.50   0.74\r\n\r\n  _Calc._: 6.0   4.2   0.67   0.51   0.48   0.68\r\n\r\nThe correspondence between the more mediocre cases is much closer than\r\nthese, and very much closer than between the extreme cases given in the\r\ntable, namely, the values that 5 per cent fall short of, and 95 exceed.\r\nThese are of course less regular, the observed instances being very few;\r\nbut even here the observations are found to agree respectably well with\r\nthe proportions given by calculation, which is necessarily based upon the\r\nsupposition of an infinite number of cases having been included in the\r\nseries.\r\n\r\nAs the want of agreement between calculation and observation must be\r\ncaused in part by the paucity of observations, it is worth while to make\r\na larger group, by throwing the six series together, as in Table XXXIII.,\r\nmaking a grand total of 965 observations. Their value is not so great as\r\nif they were observations taken from that number of different persons,\r\nstill they are equivalent to a large increase of those already discussed.\r\nThe six series of observed values were made comparable on equal terms by\r\nfirst reducing them to a uniform PE and then by assigning to M, the point\r\nof departure, the value of 0. The results are given in the last column but\r\none, where the orderly run of the observed data is much more conspicuous\r\nthan it was before. Though there is an obvious want of exact symmetry in\r\nthe observed values, their general accord with those of the calculated\r\nvalues is very fair. It is quite close enough to establish the general\r\nproposition, that we are justified in the conception of a typical form of\r\nloop, different for the two thumbs; the departure from the typical form\r\nbeing usually small, sometimes rather greater, and rarely greater still.\r\n\r\nI do not see my way to discuss the variations of the arches, because they\r\npossess no distinct points of reference. But their general appearance does\r\nnot give the impression of clustering around a typical centre. They\r\nsuggest the idea of a fountain-head, whose stream begins to broaden out\r\nfrom the first.\r\n\r\nAs regards other patterns, I have made many measurements altogether, but\r\nthe specimens of each sort were comparatively few, except in whorled\r\npatterns. In all cases where I was able to form a well-founded opinion,\r\nthe existence of a typical centre was indicated.\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious to enumerate the many different trials made for my own\r\nsatisfaction, to gain assurance that the variability of the several\r\npatterns is really of the quasi-normal kind just described. In the first\r\ntrial I measured in various ways the dimensions of about 500 enlarged\r\nphotographs of loops, and about as many of other patterns, and found that\r\nthe measurements in each and every case formed a quasi-normal series. I do\r\nnot care to submit these results, because they necessitate more\r\nexplanation and analysis than the interest of the corrected results would\r\nperhaps justify, to eliminate from them the effect of variety of size of\r\nthumb, and some other uncertainties. Those measurements referred to some\r\nchildren, a few women, many youths, and a fair number of adults; and\r\nallowance has to be made for variability in stature in each of these\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nThe proportions of a typical loop on the thumb are easily ascertained if\r\nwe may assume that the most frequent values of its variable elements,\r\ntaken separately, are the same as those that enter into the most frequent\r\ncombination of the elements taken collectively. This would necessarily be\r\ntrue if the variability of each element separately, and that of the sum of\r\nthem in combination, were all strictly normal, but as they are only\r\nquasi-normal, the assumption must be tested. I have done so by making the\r\ncomparisons (_A_) and (_B_) shown in Table XXXIV., which come out\r\ncorrectly to within the first decimal place.\r\n\r\nTABLE XXXIV.\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                        |Right | Left |\r\n  |                                        |Thumb.|Thumb.|\r\n  |----------------------------------------|------|------|\r\n  |(_a_)  Median of all the values of KL   | 12.5 | 10.1 |\r\n  |(_b_)  Median of all the values of NB   | 10.1 |  8.9 |\r\n  |                                        |------|------|\r\n  |(_A_)  Value of _a/b_                   |  1.24|  1.11|\r\n  |(_A_)  Median of all the fractions KL/NB|  1.15|  1.10|\r\n  |========================================|======|======|\r\n  |(_c_)  Median of all the values of AN   |  4.6 |  4.6 |\r\n  |(_d_)  Median of all the values of AH   |  4.4 |  3.3 |\r\n  |                                        |------|------|\r\n  |(_B_)  Value of _c/d_                   |  1.05|  1.40|\r\n  |(_B_)  Median of all the fractions AN/AH|  1.08|  1.36|\r\n  +------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that the patterns are hereditary, and we have seen that\r\nthey are uncorrelated with race or temperament or any other noticeable\r\npeculiarity, inasmuch as groups of very different classes are alike in\r\ntheir finger marks. They cannot exercise the slightest influence on\r\nmarriage selection, the very existence both of the ridges and of the\r\npatterns having been almost overlooked; they are too small to attract\r\nattention, or to be thought worthy of notice. We therefore possess a\r\nperfect instance of promiscuity in marriage, or, as it is now called,\r\npanmixia, in respect to these patterns. We might consequently have\r\nexpected them to be hybridised. But that is not the case; they _refuse to\r\nblend_. Their classes are as clearly separated as those of any of the\r\ngenera of plants and animals. They keep pure and distinct, as if they had\r\nseverally descended from a thorough-bred ancestry, each in respect to its\r\nown peculiar character.\r\n\r\nAs regards other forms of natural selection, we know that races are kept\r\npure by the much more frequent destruction of those individuals who depart\r\nthe more widely from the typical centre. But natural selection was shown\r\nto be inoperative in respect to individual varieties of patterns, and\r\nunable to exercise the slightest check upon their vagaries. Yet, for all\r\nthat, the loops and other classes of patterns are isolated from one\r\nanother just as thoroughly and just in the same way as are the genera or\r\nspecies of plants and animals. There is no statistical difference between\r\nthe form of the law of distribution of individual Loops about their\r\nrespective typical centres, and that of the law by which, say, the Shrimps\r\ndescribed in Mr. Weldon's recent memoirs (_Proc. Roy. Soc._, 1891 and\r\n1892) are distributed about theirs. In both cases the distribution is in\r\nquasi-accordance with the theoretical law of Frequency of Error, this form\r\nof distribution being entirely caused in the patterns, by _internal_\r\nconditions, and in no way by natural selection in the ordinary sense of\r\nthat term.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible not to recognise the fact so clearly illustrated by these\r\npatterns in the thumbs, that natural selection has no monopoly of\r\ninfluence in the construction of genera, but that it could be wholly\r\ndispensed with, the internal conditions acting by themselves being\r\nsufficient. When the internal conditions are in harmony with the external\r\nones, as they appear to be in all long-established races, their joint\r\neffects will curb individual variability more tightly than either could do\r\nby itself. The normal character of the distribution about the typical\r\ncentre will not be thereby interfered with. The probable divergence (=\r\nprobable error) of an individual taken at random, will be lessened, and\r\nthat is all.\r\n\r\nNot only is it impossible to substantiate a claim for natural selection,\r\nthat it is the sole agent in forming genera, but it seems, from the\r\nexperience of artificial selection, that it is scarcely competent to do so\r\nby favouring mere _varieties_, in the sense in which I understand the\r\nterm.\r\n\r\nMy contention is that it acts by favouring small _sports_. Mere varieties\r\nfrom a common typical centre blend freely in the offspring, and the\r\noffspring of every race whose _statistical_ characters are constant,\r\nnecessarily tend, as I have often shown, to regress towards their common\r\ntypical centre. Sports, on the other hand, do not blend freely; they are\r\nfresh typical centres or sub-species, which suddenly arise we do not yet\r\nknow precisely through what uncommon concurrence of circumstance, and\r\nwhich observations show to be strongly transmissible by inheritance.\r\n\r\nA mere variety can never establish a sticking-point in the forward course\r\nof evolution, but each new sport affords one. A substantial change of type\r\nis effected, as I conceive, by a succession of small changes of typical\r\ncentre, each more or less stable, and each being in its turn favoured and\r\nestablished by natural selection, to the exclusion of its competitors. The\r\ndistinction between a mere variety and a sport is real and fundamental. I\r\nargued this point in _Natural Inheritance_, but had then to draw my\r\nillustrations from non-physiological experiences, no appropriate\r\nphysiological ones being then at hand: this want is now excellently\r\nsupplied by observations of the patterns on the digits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  AH, number of ridges in, 200\r\n\r\n  Allix, 60\r\n\r\n  A.

CLARK, _Edinburgh_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Der Tastapparat der Hand der menschlichen Rassen und der Affen._ Dr.\r\nArthur Kollmann. Leopold Voss, Leipzig, 1883. He has also published a more\r\nrecent memoir.\r\n\r\n[2] \"Morphologie der Tastballen der Saugethiere,\" _Jahrbuch_, xiv. p. 407.\r\nLeipzig, 1888.\r\n\r\n[3] _Ann. Sc. Nat._, 5th series, vol. ix. 1868.\r\n\r\n[4] The Latin is obscure. \"Mira vallecularum tangentium in interna parte\r\nmanus pedisque ... dispositio flexuraque attentionem ... in se trahit.\"\r\nThere are three ways of translating \"tangentium,\" and none of them makes\r\ngood sense. In the index of prints he uses the phrase \"vallecularum\r\ntactui.\" It would seem that he looked upon the furrows, and not the\r\nridges, as the special seat of touch.\r\n\r\n[5] The results arrived at by M. Fere in a Memoir (_Comptes Rendus, Soc.\r\nBiologie_, July 2, 1891; Masson, 120 Boulevard St. Germain, Paris) may be\r\ncollated with mine. The Memoir is partly a review of my paper in the\r\n_Phil. Trans._, and contains many observations of his own. His data are\r\nderived from epileptics and others mentally affected. He has, by the way,\r\ncuriously misinterpreted my views about symmetry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes:\r\n\r\nPassages in italics are indicated by _italics_.\r\n\r\nSuperscripted characters are indicated by {superscript}.\r\n\r\nSubscripted characters are indicated by =subscript=.\r\n\r\nCharacters in smaller font are indicated by ~small~.\r\n\r\nPunctuation has been corrected without note.",
