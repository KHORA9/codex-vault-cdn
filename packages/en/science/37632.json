A short time later he was attracted by a scratching\r\nsound, and discovered that one of the wasps was just beginning to cut\r\nthe cap from its cell preparatory to emerging. During the next few days\r\na series of observations were made and notes taken covering the\r\nbehavior of the wasps which emerged from their cells during that\r\nperiod. Miss Enteman[A] has made a careful study of the instincts of\r\nthe social wasps, and while the observations recorded in the present\r\npaper are largely corroborative of her work, some interesting details\r\nare here added.\r\n\r\nThe cutting of the cap of the cell occupied some time, and extended\r\naround four-fifths of its circumference, the remaining one-fifth being\r\ngnawed and partially chewed through so that it was flexible enough to\r\nact as a hinge for the cap. After the cap was sufficiently cut away,\r\nthe wasp started to slowly work itself out, pushing up the top of the\r\ncell like a trap door as progress was made. A good deal of effort was\r\nrequired to get the body out until the front legs were freed. Then the\r\nwasp had more purchase and progress was somewhat faster until the\r\nsecond pair of legs came out. After this slight effort seemed to be\r\nnecessary for the completion of the operation.\r\n\r\nFor the next thirty minutes careful observations were made of the\r\nmovements of this wasp in order to ascertain its first reactions. It is\r\nevident that they would be somewhat modified from what they are here\r\nrecorded if the colony had contained the queen and other workers, as\r\nthis specimen had the run of the entire nest, and none of its movements\r\nwere effected by those of other individuals. It is equally evident that\r\nall stimuli came from within, or from contact with the nest, and not\r\nfrom suggestions received from other individuals or from contact with\r\nthem. The following is the record made at one minute intervals,\r\nbeginning with the time the specimen left its cell:\r\n\r\n     8:06. Specimen emerged from its cell.\r\n\r\n     8:07. Cleaned its front legs in its mouth and its antennae\r\n           with its front legs.\r\n\r\n     8:08. Moved around some. Rubbed its wings with its hind legs\r\n           and spread them out twice.\r\n\r\n     8:09. Cleaned antennae and front legs.\r\n\r\n     8:10. Swung abdomen back and forth, and brushed its wings.\r\n           Moved around the nest rapidly and waved the antennae,\r\n           but all movements were jerky.\r\n\r\n     8:11. Explored nest, occasionally rubbing abdomen with legs.\r\n\r\n     8:12. Explored nest.\r\n\r\n     8:13. Explored nest. Movements unsteady. Cleaned antennae and\r\n           front legs.\r\n\r\n     8:14. Explored nest, in the course of which it went over the\r\n           edge on to the back side, but immediately returned to\r\n           the under side. Cleaned the front legs and antennae,\r\n           and then the hind legs.\r\n\r\n     8:15. Spread out the wings. Cleaned the antennae.\r\n\r\n     8:16. Cleaned abdomen.\r\n\r\n     8:17. Crawled on top or back side of nest again and stayed\r\n           there. Cleaned wings and abdomen.\r\n\r\n     8:18. Explored top. Cleaned front legs and antennae.\r\n\r\n     8:19. Stood still. Occasional movement of head, antennae or\r\n           abdomen.\r\n\r\n     8:20. Same as 8:19.\r\n\r\n     8:21. Began to explore again, becoming quite lively. Antennae\r\n           constantly waving.\r\n\r\n     8:22. Same as 8:21, but extended its travels to the under\r\n           (cell) side of the nest.\r\n\r\n     8:23. Left the nest entirely and began to walk around the\r\n           surface of the desk.\r\n\r\n     8:24. Started to climb a bottle that was some six inches\r\n           from the nest. Antennae still waving.\r\n\r\n     8:25. On the neck of the bottle, two inches above the\r\n           surface of the desk. Cleaned front legs and antennae.\r\n\r\n     8:26. Quiet except that it spread its wings once.\r\n\r\n     8:27. Still on neck of bottle. Moved its head and antennae\r\n           back and forth.\r\n\r\n     8:28. Slight change in position. Antennae were still waving.\r\n           Rubbed its wings, spread them, and then rubbed them\r\n           again.\r\n\r\n     8:29. Rubbed its hind legs together vigorously.\r\n\r\n     8:30. Spread wings once, then rubbed them and the abdomen\r\n           with the hind legs. Rubbed the hind legs together, and\r\n           finally rubbed the right wings vigorously.\r\n\r\n     8:31. Moved around some, occasionally stopping to rub the\r\n           right wings.\r\n\r\n     8:32. Explored the neck of the bottle.\r\n\r\n     8:33. Same as 8:32. Cleaned antennae.\r\n\r\n     8:34. Same as 8:33.\r\n\r\n     8:35. Stood still but continued to clean antennae and front\r\n           legs.\r\n\r\n     8:36. Climbed up and explored the cork of the bottle.\r\n\r\n     8:37-8:40. Stood still on the cork, occasionally moving its\r\n           jaws.\r\n\r\nAt 8:40 the nest was placed against the cork and the wasp immediately\r\ncrawled onto it, but seemed restless. As the nest has a faint, but\r\ndistinct, odor of honey, it was probably attracted to it through the\r\nsense of smell.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the specimen was nowhere in sight, but forty-eight\r\nhours later it fell out of a loose-leaf binder that had been lying on\r\nthe desk. It seemed to be as active as when seen two days before. Some\r\ntime during the second night after the appearance of the first\r\nspecimen, that is, when it was some thirty hours old, a second\r\nindividual emerged. This one was discovered on a pile of books two feet\r\nfrom the nest where it had evidently crawled soon after emerging.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the first specimen was rediscovered, that is, when it was\r\nsixty hours old, the second wasp then being thirty hours old, the two\r\nwere placed on the nest, and this in turn was placed on a book. They\r\nboth started on tours of observation, and every time they came in\r\ncontact with each other they made sudden starts and jumps to avoid an\r\nevidently startling new object, meanwhile violently waving their\r\nantennae and often cleaning these organs after such contact. Dr. Enteman\r\nsays, \"All wasps possess the instinct of fear. This ... is readily\r\novercome by the frequent appearance of the awe-inspiring object.\" This\r\nis true, because they were evidently on familiar terms with each other\r\nin half an hour, and paid very little attention to the frequent\r\nmeetings which before had apparently distressed them. They wandered\r\nfreely over their nest and the top surface of the book on which it was\r\nplaced, but did not attempt to climb off the latter.\r\n\r\nAt 12 o'clock, four hours later, a third wasp had appeared, and none of\r\nthe specimens seemed to be disturbed by the presence of the others.\r\nWhen the nest was first picked up, one cell containing a well formed\r\npupa was uncapped. This specimen was then alive, but it may have been\r\ndead at the time of this observation. In either case, it had been\r\ndragged out of its cell, decapitated, and the front legs torn off. No\r\ntrace of the head was found, but the body and legs were on the book\r\nabout one inch from the nest. Whether this act was connected with the\r\nhunger of the wasps themselves or with the first development of the\r\ninstinct of feeding the larvae in the nest, which Miss Enteman says\r\nbegins without imitation, is not clear.\r\n\r\nAt 2 p. m. (two hours later) the colony was placed out of doors, still\r\non the book. Two of the wasps soon left the latter, and settled near\r\nit, keeping very quiet for half an hour. The third kept climbing over\r\nand around the nest. At 2:30 one of the two wasps returned to the nest.\r\n\r\nAt 3 p. m. two of the specimens were on the ground near the porch. They\r\nmade only short flights, resembling jumps with the wings assisting,\r\nthis being true even when they were disturbed. The third wasp was\r\nbeside the colony, chewing on the decapitated pupa, probably getting\r\nsome nourishment from it in the process.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon the nest was disturbed, and at 6 p. m. all three\r\nspecimens had gone from the porch. One was found wandering aimlessly on\r\na canna leaf near by. It did not seem to be able to fly well. The other\r\ntwo had disappeared entirely.\r\n\r\nThe nest was saved and several days later a fourth wasp appeared. It\r\nwas a very lively specimen, and spent the first few hours actively\r\nexploring the nest. It seemed of a very nervous disposition, being more\r\neasily disturbed than any of the others had been. Every time the nest\r\nwas picked up, it would start for the fingers or forceps holding it. At\r\none time it was observed with its whole body in a cell, head downward,\r\nevidently examining the interior. After staying close to the nest for a\r\nday, it began to fly around the floor of the room, paying no more\r\nattention to its former home. Even when it was placed on or near it, it\r\nwould almost immediately crawl or fly away. Its flying was erratic, and\r\nseemed to lack power, but it got along much better than any of the\r\nother three had done.\r\n\r\nFrom the above observations it would appear that the movements of the\r\nwasp recorded at one minute intervals after emergence from its cell\r\nwere probably reactions due to the discomfort of the drying and\r\nhardening of the tissues. At first the wasps apparently had very\r\nlittle, if any, home instinct. The only things to indicate that they\r\nhad any were the facts that the first specimen so readily left the cork\r\non which it was sitting and went back to its nest when the latter was\r\nheld near it, and the fourth wasp stayed on or near the nest for the\r\nfirst twelve hours. But all the specimens observed left the nest the\r\nfirst night and showed no intention or disposition to return. The\r\npresence of a second wasp seemed to bring the home instinct into\r\nexistence more forcibly, as the first and second wasps stayed with the\r\nnest for six or seven hours when they were returned to it together,\r\nwhile the fourth one repeatedly left the empty nest almost at once when\r\nit was returned to it. But this instinct was seemingly not very strong,\r\nas they soon wandered away when placed out of doors. They seemed to\r\nhave no idea as to how to carry on the work of the colony, but wandered\r\naimlessly over it. Perhaps this was due to the fact that they were too\r\nyoung, as Miss Enteman says the development of the nursing instinct is\r\nusually manifested \"any time after the first half day of imaginal\r\nlife,\" but was observed in some neuters as young as four hours, while\r\nin others it was delayed for two weeks.\r\n\r\nWhile the above observations are admittedly too few from which to draw\r\ndefinite conclusions, they seem to warrant the following assumptions,\r\nthe first three of which are quoted from Miss Enteman, and hence are\r\nsimply corroborative of her work:\r\n\r\n     1. \"All wasps possess the instinct of fear. This is\r\n        especially strong the first few days after emergence,\r\n        but is readily overcome by the frequent appearance of\r\n        the awe-inspiring object.\r\n\r\n     2. \"In a sense, the wasp remembers. This is indicated by the\r\n        manner in which it accustoms itself to the sight of\r\n        strange objects, and by its behavior when a change is\r\n        made in its nest or surroundings.\r\n\r\n     3. \"It shows considerable individual variability, both as to\r\n        time and manner of its response to stimuli.\"\r\n\r\n     4. After emergence, the first reactions are associated\r\n        simply with the discomfort of the hardening of the\r\n        tissues.\r\n\r\n     5. It has marked curiosity, as shown by its repeated\r\n        inspection of its nest and other familiar objects.\r\n\r\n     6. The \"home instinct\" seems to be slight when the wasp is\r\n        alone, but becomes stronger when two or more are on the\r\n        same nest.\r\n\r\n     7. The olfactory sense is closely associated with the early\r\n        instincts of the wasp.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Minnie Marie Enteman. \"Some Observations on the Behavior\r\nof the Social Wasps.\" Pop.

Abdominal tergites and sternites each with\r\nfour transverse rows of microscopic setae; lateral spiracles on segments\r\ntwo to seven.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION OF THE GENUS\r\n\r\nThe genus _Dicranoptycha_ was erected by Osten Sacken in 1860 (Proc.\r\nAcad. Nat. Sci. Phila. for 1859, p. 217). The genus includes a small\r\ngroup of crane-flies with a Holarctic distribution, there being about\r\nsix species in North America and two, or possibly three, in Europe. As\r\nI have indicated elsewhere, _D. signaticollis_ v.d.W. of Java is\r\nundoubtedly a species of _Libnotes_. Of the American species, _D.\r\ngermana_ O.S. is characteristic of the Canadian life-zone of\r\nnortheastern America. _D. sobrina_ O.S. is widely distributed in the\r\nUnited States and southern Canada, usually occurring in the\r\nTransitional and Upper Austral life-zones. So far as known at present\r\nit is the only species of the genus occurring on the Pacific slope. The\r\nremaining American species (_nigripes_ O.S., _winnemana_ Alex.,\r\n_tigrina_ Alex. and _minima_ Alex.) are Austral in distribution,\r\noccurring in the southeastern and south central United States. A more\r\ndetailed account of the distribution of the species is given in another\r\npaper by the writer which may be consulted (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci.\r\nPhila. for 1916, pp. 496, 497). All of the known species are generally\r\nsimilar to one another in appearance and are separated by relatively\r\nslight differences of size, color and structure.\r\n\r\nNothing has ever been written concerning the immature stages of this\r\npeculiar group of crane-flies. The species described hereinafter were\r\nreared at Lawrence, Kansas, and the general conditions under which they\r\noccur may be briefly discussed:\r\n\r\nNorth Hollow, on the Campus of the University of Kansas, is a typical\r\ndry Austral woodland traversed by a small stream that is entirely dry\r\nduring the months of midsummer drought. The soil consists of a rich\r\nblack humus that is soft and mellow except during the period of\r\ngreatest dryness, being overlain by a varying depth of vegetable debris\r\nand leaf-mold. It is in this relatively dry soil that the larvae of\r\n_Dicranoptycha_ occur. The forest cover consists of Carolina poplar,\r\n_Populus deltoides_ Marsh; black walnut, _Juglans nigra_ L., white elm,\r\n_Ulmus americana_ L.; Kentucky coffee-tree, _Gymnocladus dioica_ (L.)\r\nKoch; honey locust, _Gleditsia triacanthos_ L.; red bud, _Cercis\r\ncanadensis_ L.; yellow wood, _Cladrastis lutea_ (Mx.f.) Koch;\r\ntree-of-heaven, _Ailanthus glandulosa_ Desf., etc. The principle shrubs\r\nare the goose-berry, _Ribes gracile_ Mx.; poison ivy, _Rhus\r\nToxicodendron_ L.; wahoo, _Evonymus atropurpureus_ Jacq.; bladder-nut,\r\n_Staphylea trifolia_ L.; coral-berry, _Symphoricarpos orbiculatus_\r\nMoench.; blackberried elder, _Sambucus canadensis_ L., etc. The herbage\r\nis made up of tall grasses, composites and, in the spring, the\r\nall-dominant cleavers, _Galium_. In addition to the above, great\r\ntangles of lianas (_Smilax_, _Vitis_, _Ampelopsis_, etc.) are found.\r\n\r\nIn situations such as the above these Austral species of\r\n_Dicranoptycha_ spend their entire lives. The first larvae of _D.\r\nwinnemana_ were found here on March 20, 1918, by the writer and his\r\nwife. At this time they were well grown (length 16 mm.; diameter 0.9\r\nmm.). They occurred just beneath the cover of fallen leaves and other\r\ndebris in the upper layers of soil. Here they were associated with pupae\r\nof _Tipula angustipennis_ Lw., larvae of _Sciara_ (Mycetophilidae);\r\n_Psilocephala haemorrhoidalis_ Macq. (Therevidae), numerous beetle larvae,\r\ncentipedes, etc. By their elongate form and glabrous shiny skin they\r\nare very characteristic and easily recognized. The glassy appearance of\r\nthe body suggests the shiny shells of a small coiled molluscan whose\r\ndead fragments occurred in some numbers in the same situations. These\r\nlarvae were placed in rearing and the first adults appeared in the\r\nbreeding-cages on May 6, and from that time on continued to appear in\r\nlarge numbers. It was over a month later that the first individuals\r\nwere taken in the field. The pupal duration could not be determined\r\ncloser than ten days, and this may be the usual length of time required\r\nfor this stage. The first larvae of _D. minima_ were found on July 2,\r\n1918, in similar situations in North Hollow. At this time they were\r\nonly about one-half grown. On July 11 much larger larvae of this species\r\nwere secured and placed in rearing, emerging as adults on July 21. The\r\nlarvae, like these of _D. winnemana_, live just beneath the layer of\r\nleaf-mold in the upper zone of black soil. They are usually quite\r\nsluggish in their motions but at other times are quite active. The\r\nlarvae are herbivores and feed on the rich organic earth in their\r\nhaunts. When ready to pupate, they encase themselves in earthen cells\r\n(10 mm. x 3.5 mm.), firm in texture, rather thick-walled but without\r\nsilk. There is a small opening at either end. The length of the cavity\r\nis but little greater than the pupa itself. In this cavity the pupa\r\nrests and matures. As in other insects, the teneral pupae are very pale\r\nyellow but gradually darken in color until, at emergence, they are of a\r\ndark brownish-black. When newly transformed the teneral flies rest on\r\nthe ground and on the leaves of low plants nearby.\r\n\r\nThe adult flies of _D. germana_ usually occur in the immediate\r\nneighborhood of running or stagnant water and may be swept from the\r\nrank vegetation in such places. The flies rest on the upper surface of\r\nthe leaves of tall herbs and low shrubs. In eastern Kansas, the flies\r\nof _D. winnemana_, _D. tigrina_ and _D. minima_ often occur together.\r\nIn June, _D. winnemana_ appears on the wing and is found associated\r\nwith _Tipula morrisoni_ Alex., _T. mingwe_ Alex., etc.; in July, _D.\r\nminima_ appears, together with _Tipula flavibasis_ Alex., _T.\r\nunimaculata_ Lw., etc.; still later in July _D. tigrina_ emerges and\r\nall three species fly together during August and into September when\r\nthey fly with _Tipula ultima_ Alex., _T. unifasciata_ Lw., etc. It is\r\ncurious that no other species of Limnobiinae occur in the thamnophytic\r\nassociation frequented by _Dicranoptycha_. All three species of this\r\ngenus as discussed above have habits that are generally similar to one\r\nanother. They are usually found resting quietly on the upper surface of\r\nthe leaves but fly readily and on slight disturbance. Pairs in\r\ncopulation are often found resting, the bodies directed away from one\r\nanother and the wings folded over the abdomen. While thus united they\r\nfly readily, sometimes the female taking the initiative, sometimes the\r\nrather smaller male. The eggs are deposited in the soft earth in these\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL AFFINITIES\r\n\r\nIn the Monographs (1869) Osten Sacken included the genus\r\n_Dicranoptycha_ in his tribe (section) Limnobina anomala, or, as it\r\nsubsequently became known, the Rhamphidini, and still later the\r\nAntochini. A recent survey of the immature stages of several Antochine\r\ngenera has shown that the tribe is merely an artificial grouping based\r\non superficial resemblance of the adult flies. This heterogeneous\r\nassemblage includes representatives of at least three other tribes,\r\n_Dicranoptycha_, together with _Antocha_, _Elliptera_, _Rhamphidia_,\r\netc., showing an undeniable affinity with the Limnobiini, whereas\r\n_Teucholabis_, _Elephantomyia_, etc., show an equally clear\r\nrelationship with the Eriopterini. Moreover a close phylogenetic\r\nrelationship with the lowermost subtribes of the Hexatomini (_Ularia_,\r\n_Epiphragmaria_, etc.), is easily apparent.\r\n\r\n_Dicranoptycha_ shows the closest affinities with _Antocha_ and\r\n_Rhamphidia_. The larvae of these three genera, each of which typifies a\r\ndivision, show the following common characters:\r\n\r\nAbdominal segments with basal transverse creeping welts or areas of\r\nmicroscopic points. The massive compact head-capsule with the\r\npraefrontal sclerite large, distinct, the externo-lateral plates large,\r\nmussel-shaped and very thin. The mentum is not completely divided\r\nmedially. The maxillae are large and of primitive structure, the\r\ncardines and stipites distinct, the two distal lobes large, subequal in\r\nsize, covered with hairs and bearing sensory organs. Mandibles with one\r\nor more dorsal and two or more ventral teeth in addition to the apical\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nThe differences between these allied divisions are best indicated by a\r\nkey.\r\n\r\n\r\nLARVAE\r\n\r\n     1.

Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila.,\r\npp. 500, 501; Pl. 25, fig. 12.\r\n\r\n_Larva._--Length, 20-22 mm.\r\n          Diameter, 0.9-1.1 mm.\r\n\r\nColoration varying from white to almost black depending on the nature\r\nand amount of the food eaten which shows clearly through the\r\ntransparent integument. The fat-bodies likewise show through and give a\r\nwhite color to the larva especially after death.\r\n\r\nForm very elongate (fig. 1), body terete; integument very glabrous,\r\ntransparent and glassy. Prothoracic segment a little longer than the\r\nmesothorax which, in turn, slightly exceeds the metathorax. The\r\nintermediate abdominal segments are elongated. The basal ring of\r\nsternites two to eight bears a transverse band or area of microscopic\r\nchitinized spicules, the one on the eighth segment split lengthwise by\r\na capillary line. A similar band occurs in the same position on the\r\ndorsum of the eighth segment but the pleural region is devoid of such a\r\nband.\r\n\r\nSpiracular disk (fig. 8) moderate in size, obliquely truncated,\r\nsurrounded by four lobes, a pair of small, slender, lateral lobes and\r\nshort, broader ventral lobes. The usual dorso-median lobe is lacking\r\nbut its position is indicated by a gently rounded convexity. The inner\r\nface of the lateral lobe bears a narrow semi-lunate black mark with the\r\nconcavity toward the spiracle, the proximal end acutely pointed. The\r\nventral lobes bear a similar but smaller subrectangular black mark. A\r\npale and usually indistinct dusky mark occupies the inner face of the\r\ndorsal lobe. On the disk between, and slightly below the level of, the\r\nspiracles is a large brown triangular or V-shaped mark. The spiracles\r\nare small, separated from one another by a distance equal to about 2.5\r\nto 3 times the diameter of one; the center-piece of the spiracle is\r\nblack, the ring yellow surrounded by an outer dusky margin. Anal gills\r\nfleshy and protuberant as a blunt ring surrounding the anus (fig. 10).\r\n\r\nHead-capsule (fig. 2) of the compact, massive type of the Limnobiini;\r\npraefrontal sclerite (fig. 3) large and distinct; the sclerite broad\r\nwith the sides subparallel to about midlength, thence tapering\r\ngradually to the tip which is entire; there are two or three punctures\r\nat the margin before midlength. Interno-lateral plates narrow, a little\r\nlonger than the praefrons; externo-lateral plates very broad, thin and\r\nflattened with the posterior margin very obtuse and the inner ventral\r\nportions continuous with the mental plate. Labrum (fig. 3) very broad\r\nand extensive, flattened, pale in color, the anterior margin with about\r\ntwo sense-organs. Mentum (fig. 4) deeply split behind but not\r\ncompletely divided, the anterior margin with three primary teeth that\r\nare subequal in size or the middle one a little smaller; a much reduced\r\nlateral tooth on either side. Praementum smaller than the hypopharynx,\r\nin outline roughly oval or semicircular with the two labial palpi\r\nsurrounded by hairs at the base. Hypopharynx (fig. 5) consisting of two\r\nchitinized arms that are contiguous but not fused medially, the\r\nconcavity between them filled with a rounded cushion that is covered\r\nwith tubercles arranged in more or less distinct oblique parallel rows.\r\nAntennae (fig. 6) two-segmented, the basal segment cylindrical with an\r\nauditory plate on the face at beyond midlength; apical segment long and\r\nslender, in length but slightly less than the basal segment, tapering\r\ngradually to the bluntly rounded apex. Mandibles (fig. 7) simple with\r\nthe teeth blunt; apical point longer than the lateral teeth; dorsal\r\ntooth single, broad, very flattened and obtusely pointed; ventral teeth\r\ntwo, a little smaller than the dorsal tooth. Maxillae (fig. 2) of a\r\ngeneralized structure, the cardines distinct and feebly chitinized;\r\ndistal lobes of the organ consisting of a subequal inner and outer\r\nlobe; the outer lobe with an abundance of long, delicate hairs and\r\nbearing a few sensory papillae including one larger palpiform organ.\r\n\r\n_Pupa._--Length, 9.1-12.8 mm.\r\nWidth, d.-s., 1.6-1.8 mm.\r\nDepth, d.-v., 1.6-1.9 mm.\r\n\r\nThoracic dorsum shiny light brown; in very old pupae the color is much\r\ndarker, but still retains a much brighter color than the leg and\r\nwing-sheaths; abdomen pale becoming darker in age, especially on the\r\npleura.\r\n\r\nCephalic crest (fig. 13) low and depressed, inconspicuous, lying\r\nbetween the antennal bases which extend beyond it; there are four small\r\nsetigerous lobes, the larger pair of which are posterior in position.\r\nFront between the eyes broad, subparallel. Two blunt tubercles on\r\neither side of the forehead. Eyes large, with coarse ommatidia. Labrum\r\nsemicircular in outline, tumid. Labial lobes large, oval, contiguous\r\nwith one another, at the tip of the labrum. Maxillary palpi moderately\r\nlong and slender, nearly straight, gradually narrowed to the tip which\r\nends opposite the knee-joint of the fore legs. Antennae with the basal\r\nsegments separated only by the cephalic crest, the sheaths ending about\r\nopposite or a little before the lateral angle of the thorax.\r\n\r\nPronotal breathing-horns (fig. 14) very small, almost microscopic; when\r\nviewed from the dorsal aspect appearing as tiny triangular tubercles.\r\nMesonotum moderately convex, unarmed, the V-shaped suture distinct; a\r\nfew setae on the mesonotum, including one near the end of each scutal\r\nlobe. Wing-sheaths rather short, but narrow, ending about opposite\r\nmidlength of the third abdominal segment. Leg-sheaths ending opposite\r\nthe base of the fifth abdominal segment, the tips of the tarsi ending\r\nabout on a common level or those of the fore legs a trifle longer.\r\n\r\nAbdominal segments (fig. 11) subdivided into four annuli that bear\r\ntransverse bands of microscopic setae; these bands increase in width\r\nfrom the basal to the apical. Spiracles on the pleural region of\r\nsegments two to seven, lying opposite the third annulus and close to\r\nthe ventral margin of the pleura. No spiracles are discernible on the\r\ndorsum of the eighth segment. Male cauda (fig. 11) with the ventral\r\nlobes very blunt, rounded; the dorsal lobes very small, terminating in\r\na sharp spine that is directed dorsad and bears a weak seta near its\r\nbase. Female cauda (fig. 12) with the ventral lobes a little longer\r\nthan the dorsal lobes; the latter at the outer angle of the apex with a\r\nshort stout spine that is directed dorsad as in the male.\r\n\r\n     _Nepionotype_ (type larva), Lawrence, Kansas, April 2, 1918.\r\n\r\n     _Neanotype_ (type pupa), with the type larva, May 6, 1918.\r\n\r\n     _Paratypes_, larvae and pupae, about fifty from the type\r\n     locality, March 20 to May 20, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dicranoptycha minima_ Alexander.\r\n\r\n1919 _Dicranoptycha minima_ Alexander; Ent.

The mark of the lateral lobes is\r\ncontiguous with the spiracles and is also closely approximated to the\r\nlarge triangular brown mark on the disk. There is a large transverse\r\nrectangular mark occupying the inner face of the dorsal lobe.

HILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nThese bivalve forms are grouped among the simplest of the molloscs. It\r\nis especially from the condition in _Nucula_ as described by Pelseneer\r\n'91, that the conception of the most anterior ganglion being composed\r\nof four ganglia, has its chief support. Drew '01, who has also studied\r\n_Nucula_, believes that the lobes of the ganglion in _Nucula_ are\r\nsuperficial and that the four connectives coming from the ganglion may\r\nbe interpreted in another way. That is, that one pair of nerves may\r\nrepresent an otocystic branch partly fused with the connective. This\r\nview seemed reasonable to him as Stempel '99 in _Solenyma_ found the\r\notocystic nerves arose directly from the cerebral ganglion.\r\n\r\nThe two species of this group used for study were collected at Laguna\r\nBeach. _Nucula castrensis_ Hinds, occurs abundantly at low tide under\r\nrocks. It is rather small for dissection, but very good complete series\r\nwere obtained and stained in hematoxylin. _Malletia faba_ Dall, was\r\nmuch less abundant. Specimens were obtained from holdfasts or from\r\ndredging. Although this was a larger species, gross dissection was not\r\nvery easily carried out on any of the specimens, but good series were\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nThe ganglia of _Nucula_ are easily studied in section. The cerebral\r\nmass seems composed of one main mass, partly divided into four\r\nsubdivisions, the two central most completely fused, and the lateral\r\nquite distinct in places. The central portion might represent the\r\ncerebral ganglia and the lateral, the pleural if we take that\r\ninterpretation. The pedal ganglion is made of right and left parts\r\nquite completely fused except at the margins. The pedal mass is the\r\nsmallest of the three chief ganglionic areas. The visceral ganglia are\r\nquite widely separated and a little larger than the pedal mass.\r\n\r\nThe ganglia of _Malletia_ are in general plan similar to those of\r\n_Nucula_, the greatest differences being in the cerebral mass. The\r\ncerebro-pleural mass seems almost one. In most sections it is very\r\ncompact and a little more complicated in structure than the ganglion of\r\n_Nucula_. However there are two small ventral ganglionic branches or\r\nsmall ganglia attached to the ventral side of the cerebral mass. These\r\nsmall ganglia may represent the visceral. Farther back in a cross\r\nsection series as the cerebral mass disappears two other small branches\r\ntake origin and run parallel to the nerves from the ganglionic cords.\r\nThese two branches on each side seem to run together before the pedal\r\nganglia are reached. Neither of these pairs of nerves seems connected\r\nwith an otocyst.\r\n\r\nAt the cephalic end of the cerebro-pleural ganglion the large\r\nganglionic cords are in evidence. A little distance from the cephalic\r\nend on the dorsal side there are quite large groups of cells down from\r\nthe surface and surrounded by nerve fibers. The course of the fibers\r\nhere is quite complex. On the ventral lateral sides of the ganglia are\r\npaired light areas of fibers which may be traced into the fibers of the\r\nganglionic cords.\r\n\r\nThe pedal ganglion is small and much as in _Nucula_. The visceral\r\nganglia are larger and widely separated.\r\n\r\nIn both _Nucula_ and _Malletia_ young specimens were used for study. In\r\n_Nucula_ there was more the appearance of four ganglia in the\r\ncerebro-pleural mass, and the ganglia seem less complex than in\r\n_Malletia_. This last species has more separate pleural ganglia, if the\r\nganglionic cords can be so regarded.\r\n\r\nIn neither of the species studied were all parts of the connectives\r\neasy to follow, so it was impossible to test the suggestions of Drew,\r\nbut in both species there is some indication of two lateral lobes of\r\nthe cerebral mass, and in _Nucula_ there is good evidence of two\r\ncentral ganglia as well as the smaller lateral ones. The lateral\r\nganglia of the cerebral mass are most clearly separated in _Malletia_.\r\nIn _Nucula_ the lateral ganglia are larger in proportion and the\r\ndistribution of the gray and white matter is more irregular.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n_Drew, G.

The mountains reach an elevation of ten thousand feet within a\r\nfew miles of the college and these with the nearby ocean afford many\r\nspecial advantages for the study of things not in books. Special\r\nadvantages are afforded by the fact that the college limits its\r\nattendance, the freshman class being restricted to two hundred\r\napplicants. The success of the college is particularly indicated by the\r\nlarge proportion of the graduates who proceed to advanced work in the\r\nlarge universities. In addition, well-manned departments of music and\r\nart afford exceptional advantages.\r\n\r\nFor further information, address\r\n\r\nSECRETARY OF POMONA COLLEGE\r\nClaremont, California\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes\r\n\r\n\r\nPage 64: Changed * * * to ...
