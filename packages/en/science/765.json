MERRITT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nForeword\r\n\r\nThe publication of the following narrative of Dr. Walter T. Goodwin\r\nhas been authorized by the Executive Council of the International\r\nAssociation of Science.\r\n\r\nFirst:\r\n\r\nTo end officially what is beginning to be called the Throckmartin\r\nMystery and to kill the innuendo and scandalous suspicions which have\r\nthreatened to stain the reputations of Dr. David Throckmartin, his\r\nyouthful wife, and equally youthful associate Dr. Charles Stanton ever\r\nsince a tardy despatch from Melbourne, Australia, reported the\r\ndisappearance of the first from a ship sailing to that port, and the\r\nsubsequent reports of the disappearance of his wife and associate from\r\nthe camp of their expedition in the Caroline Islands.\r\n\r\nSecond:\r\n\r\nBecause the Executive Council have concluded that Dr. Goodwin's\r\nexperiences in his wholly heroic effort to save the three, and the\r\nlessons and warnings within those experiences, are too important\r\nto humanity as a whole to be hidden away in scientific papers\r\nunderstandable only to the technically educated; or to be presented\r\nthrough the newspaper press in the abridged and fragmentary form\r\nwhich the space limitations of that vehicle make necessary.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons the Executive Council commissioned Mr. A. Merritt\r\nto transcribe into form to be readily understood by the layman the\r\nstenographic notes of Dr. Goodwin's own report to the Council,\r\nsupplemented by further oral reminiscences and comments by Dr.\r\nGoodwin; this transcription, edited and censored by the Executive\r\nCouncil of the Association, forms the contents of this book.\r\n\r\nHimself a member of the Council, Dr. Walter T. Goodwin, Ph.D.,\r\nF.R.G.S. etc., is without cavil the foremost of American botanists, an\r\nobserver of international reputation and the author of several epochal\r\ntreaties upon his chosen branch of science. His story, amazing in the\r\nbest sense of that word as it may be, is fully supported by proofs\r\nbrought forward by him and accepted by the organization of which I\r\nhave the honor to be president. What matter has been elided from\r\nthis popular presentation--because of the excessively menacing\r\npotentialities it contains, which unrestricted dissemination might\r\ndevelop--will be dealt with in purely scientific pamphlets of\r\ncarefully guarded circulation.\r\n\r\nTHE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SCIENCE\r\n  Per J.

The day before I had reached\r\nPort Moresby and had seen my specimens safely stored on board the\r\nSouthern Queen. As I sat on the upper deck I thought, with homesick\r\nmind, of the long leagues between me and Melbourne, and the longer\r\nones between Melbourne and New York.\r\n\r\nIt was one of Papua's yellow mornings when she shows herself in her\r\nsombrest, most baleful mood. The sky was smouldering ochre. Over the\r\nisland brooded a spirit sullen, alien, implacable, filled with the\r\nthreat of latent, malefic forces waiting to be unleashed. It seemed an\r\nemanation out of the untamed, sinister heart of Papua herself--sinister\r\neven when she smiles. And now and then, on the wind, came a breath from\r\nvirgin jungles, laden with unfamiliar odours, mysterious and menacing.\r\n\r\nIt is on such mornings that Papua whispers to you of her immemorial\r\nancientness and of her power. And, as every white man must, I fought\r\nagainst her spell. While I struggled I saw a tall figure striding down\r\nthe pier; a Kapa-Kapa boy followed swinging a new valise. There was\r\nsomething familiar about the tall man. As he reached the gangplank he\r\nlooked up straight into my eyes, stared for a moment, then waved his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nAnd now I knew him.  It was Dr. David Throckmartin--\"Throck\" he was to\r\nme always, one of my oldest friends and, as well, a mind of the first\r\nwater whose power and achievements were for me a constant inspiration\r\nas they were, I know, for scores other.\r\n\r\nCoincidentally with my recognition came a shock of surprise,\r\ndefinitely--unpleasant. It was Throckmartin--but about him was\r\nsomething disturbingly unlike the man I had known long so well and to\r\nwhom and to whose little party I had bidden farewell less than a month\r\nbefore I myself had sailed for these seas. He had married only a few\r\nweeks before, Edith, the daughter of Professor William Frazier,\r\nyounger by at least a decade than he but at one with him in his ideals\r\nand as much in love, if it were possible, as Throckmartin. By virtue\r\nof her father's training a wonderful assistant, by virtue of her own\r\nsweet, sound heart a--I use the word in its olden sense--lover. With\r\nhis equally youthful associate Dr. Charles Stanton and a Swedish\r\nwoman, Thora Halversen, who had been Edith Throckmartin's nurse from\r\nbabyhood, they had set forth for the Nan-Matal, that extraordinary\r\ngroup of island ruins clustered along the eastern shore of Ponape in\r\nthe Carolines.\r\n\r\nI knew that he had planned to spend at least a year among these ruins,\r\nnot only of Ponape but of Lele--twin centres of a colossal riddle of\r\nhumanity, a weird flower of civilization that blossomed ages before\r\nthe seeds of Egypt were sown; of whose arts we know little enough and\r\nof whose science nothing. He had carried with him unusually complete\r\nequipment for the work he had expected to do and which, he hoped,\r\nwould be his monument.\r\n\r\nWhat then had brought Throckmartin to Port Moresby, and what was that\r\nchange I had sensed in him?\r\n\r\nHurrying down to the lower deck I found him with the purser.  As I\r\nspoke he turned, thrust out to me an eager hand--and then I saw what\r\nwas that difference that had so moved me. He knew, of course by my\r\nsilence and involuntary shrinking the shock my closer look had given\r\nme. His eyes filled; he turned brusquely from the purser, hesitated--then\r\nhurried off to his stateroom.\r\n\r\n\"'E looks rather queer--eh?\" said the purser.  \"Know 'im well, sir?\r\nSeems to 'ave given you quite a start.\"\r\n\r\nI made some reply and went slowly up to my chair.  There I sat,\r\ncomposed my mind and tried to define what it was that had shaken me\r\nso. Now it came to me. The old Throckmartin was on the eve of his\r\nventure just turned forty, lithe, erect, muscular; his controlling\r\nexpression one of enthusiasm, of intellectual keenness, of--what shall\r\nI say--expectant search. His always questioning brain had stamped its\r\nvigor upon his face.\r\n\r\nBut the Throckmartin I had seen below was one who had borne some\r\nscaring shock of mingled rapture and horror; some soul cataclysm that\r\nin its climax had remoulded, deep from within, his face, setting on it\r\nseal of wedded ecstasy and despair; as though indeed these two had\r\ncome to him hand in hand, taken possession of him and departing left\r\nbehind, ineradicably, their linked shadows!\r\n\r\nYes--it was that which appalled.  For how could rapture and horror,\r\nHeaven and Hell mix, clasp hands--kiss?\r\n\r\nYet these were what in closest embrace lay on Throckmartin's face!\r\n\r\nDeep in thought, subconsciously with relief, I watched the shore line\r\nsink behind; welcomed the touch of the wind of the free seas. I had\r\nhoped, and within the hope was an inexplicable shrinking that I would\r\nmeet Throckmartin at lunch. He did not come down, and I was sensible\r\nof deliverance within my disappointment. All that afternoon I lounged\r\nabout uneasily but still he kept to his cabin--and within me was no\r\nstrength to summon him. Nor did he appear at dinner.\r\n\r\nDusk and night fell swiftly.  I was warm and went back to my\r\ndeck-chair. The Southern Queen was rolling to a disquieting swell and\r\nI had the place to myself.\r\n\r\nOver the heavens was a canopy of cloud, glowing faintly and testifying\r\nto the moon riding behind it. There was much phosphorescence. Fitfully\r\nbefore the ship and at her sides arose those stranger little swirls of\r\nmist that swirl up from the Southern Ocean like breath of sea\r\nmonsters, whirl for an instant and disappear.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the deck door opened and through it came Throckmartin.  He\r\npaused uncertainly, looked up at the sky with a curiously eager,\r\nintent gaze, hesitated, then closed the door behind him.\r\n\r\n\"Throck,\" I called.  \"Come!  It's Goodwin.\"\r\n\r\nHe made his way to me.\r\n\r\n\"Throck,\" I said, wasting no time in preliminaries. \"What's wrong?\r\nCan I help you?\"\r\n\r\nI felt his body grow tense.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to Melbourne, Goodwin,\" he answered.  \"I need a few\r\nthings--need them urgently. And more men--white men--\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped abruptly; rose from his chair, gazed intently toward the\r\nnorth. I followed his gaze. Far, far away the moon had broken through\r\nthe clouds. Almost on the horizon, you could see the faint\r\nluminescence of it upon the smooth sea. The distant patch of light\r\nquivered and shook. The clouds thickened again and it was gone. The\r\nship raced on southward, swiftly.\r\n\r\nThrockmartin dropped into his chair.  He lighted a cigarette with a\r\nhand that trembled; then turned to me with abrupt resolution.\r\n\r\n\"Goodwin,\" he said.  \"I do need help.  If ever man needed it, I do.\r\nGoodwin--can you imagine yourself in another world, alien, unfamiliar,\r\na world of terror, whose unknown joy is its greatest terror of all;\r\nyou all alone there, a stranger! As such a man would need help, so I\r\nneed--\"\r\n\r\nHe paused abruptly and arose; the cigarette dropped from his fingers.\r\nThe moon had again broken through the clouds, and this time much\r\nnearer. Not a mile away was the patch of light that it threw upon the\r\nwaves. Back of it, to the rim of the sea was a lane of moonlight; a\r\ngigantic gleaming serpent racing over the edge of the world straight\r\nand surely toward the ship.\r\n\r\nThrockmartin stiffened to it as a pointer does to a hidden covey.  To\r\nme from him pulsed a thrill of horror--but horror tinged with an\r\nunfamiliar, an infernal joy. It came to me and passed away--leaving me\r\ntrembling with its shock of bitter sweet.\r\n\r\nHe bent forward, all his soul in his eyes.  The moon path swept\r\ncloser, closer still. It was now less than half a mile away. From it\r\nthe ship fled--almost as though pursued. Down upon it, swift and\r\nstraight, a radiant torrent cleaving the waves, raced the moon stream.\r\n\r\n\"Good God!\" breathed Throckmartin, and if ever the words were a prayer\r\nand an invocation they were.\r\n\r\nAnd then, for the first time--I saw--_it_!\r\n\r\nThe moon path stretched to the horizon and was bordered by darkness.\r\nIt was as though the clouds above had been parted to form a lane-drawn\r\naside like curtains or as the waters of the Red Sea were held back to\r\nlet the hosts of Israel through. On each side of the stream was the\r\nblack shadow cast by the folds of the high canopies And straight as a\r\nroad between the opaque walls gleamed, shimmered, and danced the\r\nshining, racing, rapids of the moonlight.\r\n\r\nFar, it seemed immeasurably far, along this stream of silver fire I\r\nsensed, rather than saw, something coming. It drew first into sight as\r\na deeper glow within the light. On and on it swept toward us--an\r\nopalescent mistiness that sped with the suggestion of some winged\r\ncreature in arrowed flight. Dimly there crept into my mind memory of\r\nthe Dyak legend of the winged messenger of Buddha--the Akla bird\r\nwhose feathers are woven of the moon rays, whose heart is a living\r\nopal, whose wings in flight echo the crystal clear music of the white\r\nstars--but whose beak is of frozen flame and shreds the souls of\r\nunbelievers.\r\n\r\nCloser it drew and now there came to me sweet, insistent\r\ntinklings--like pizzicati on violins of glass; crystal clear; diamonds\r\nmelting into sounds!\r\n\r\nNow the Thing was close to the end of the white path; close up to the\r\nbarrier of darkness still between the ship and the sparkling head of\r\nthe moon stream. Now it beat up against that barrier as a bird against\r\nthe bars of its cage. It whirled with shimmering plumes, with swirls\r\nof lacy light, with spirals of living vapour. It held within it odd,\r\nunfamiliar gleams as of shifting mother-of-pearl. Coruscations and\r\nglittering atoms drifted through it as though it drew them from the\r\nrays that bathed it.\r\n\r\nNearer and nearer it came, borne on the sparkling waves, and ever\r\nthinner shrank the protecting wall of shadow between it and us. Within\r\nthe mistiness was a core, a nucleus of intenser light--veined,\r\nopaline, effulgent, intensely alive. And above it, tangled in the\r\nplumes and spirals that throbbed and whirled were seven glowing\r\nlights.\r\n\r\nThrough all the incessant but strangely ordered movement of\r\nthe--_thing_--these lights held firm and steady. They were seven--like\r\nseven little moons. One was of a pearly pink, one of a delicate\r\nnacreous blue, one of lambent saffron, one of the emerald you see in\r\nthe shallow waters of tropic isles; a deathly white; a ghostly\r\namethyst; and one of the silver that is seen only when the flying fish\r\nleap beneath the moon.\r\n\r\nThe tinkling music was louder still.  It pierced the ears with a\r\nshower of tiny lances; it made the heart beat jubilantly--and checked\r\nit dolorously. It closed the throat with a throb of rapture and\r\ngripped it tight with the hand of infinite sorrow!\r\n\r\nCame to me now a murmuring cry, stilling the crystal notes.  It was\r\narticulate--but as though from something utterly foreign to this\r\nworld. The ear took the cry and translated with conscious labour into\r\nthe sounds of earth. And even as it compassed, the brain shrank from\r\nit irresistibly, and simultaneously it seemed reached toward it with\r\nirresistible eagerness.\r\n\r\nThrockmartin strode toward the front of the deck, straight toward the\r\nvision, now but a few yards away from the stern. His face had lost all\r\nhuman semblance. Utter agony and utter ecstasy--there they were side\r\nby side, not resisting each other; unholy inhuman companions blending\r\ninto a look that none of God's creatures should wear--and deep, deep\r\nas his soul! A devil and a God dwelling harmoniously side by side! So\r\nmust Satan, newly fallen, still divine, seeing heaven and\r\ncontemplating hell, have appeared.\r\n\r\nAnd then--swiftly the moon path faded!  The clouds swept over the sky\r\nas though a hand had drawn them together. Up from the south came a\r\nroaring squall. As the moon vanished what I had seen vanished with\r\nit--blotted out as an image on a magic lantern; the tinkling ceased\r\nabruptly--leaving a silence like that which follows an abrupt thunder\r\nclap. There was nothing about us but silence and blackness!\r\n\r\nThrough me passed a trembling as one who has stood on the very verge\r\nof the gulf wherein the men of the Louisades says lurks the fisher of\r\nthe souls of men, and has been plucked back by sheerest chance.\r\n\r\nThrockmartin passed an arm around me.\r\n\r\n\"It is as I thought,\" he said.  In his voice was a new note; the calm\r\ncertainty that has swept aside a waiting terror of the unknown. \"Now I\r\nknow! Come with me to my cabin, old friend. For now that you too have\r\nseen I can tell you\"--he hesitated--\"what it was you saw,\" he ended.\r\n\r\nAs we passed through the door we met the ship's first officer.\r\nThrockmartin composed his face into at least a semblance of normality.\r\n\r\n\"Going to have much of a storm?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the mate.  \"Probably all the way to Melbourne.\"\r\n\r\nThrockmartin straightened as though with a new thought. He gripped the\r\nofficer's sleeve eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"You mean at least cloudy weather--for\"--he hesitated--\"for the next\r\nthree nights, say?\"\r\n\r\n\"And for three more,\" replied the mate.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\" cried Throckmartin, and I think I never heard such relief\r\nand hope as was in his voice.\r\n\r\nThe sailor stood amazed.  \"Thank God?\" he repeated. \"Thank--what d'ye\r\nmean?\"\r\n\r\nBut Throckmartin was moving onward to his cabin.  I started to follow.\r\nThe first officer stopped me.\r\n\r\n\"Your friend,\" he said, \"is he ill?\"\r\n\r\n\"The sea!\" I answered hurriedly.  \"He's not used to it.  I am going to\r\nlook after him.\"\r\n\r\nDoubt and disbelief were plain in the seaman's eyes but I hurried on.\r\nFor I knew now that Throckmartin was ill indeed--but with a sickness\r\nthe ship's doctor nor any other could heal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\"Dead!  All Dead!\"\r\n\r\nHe was sitting, face in hands, on the side of his berth as I entered.\r\nHe had taken off his coat.\r\n\r\n\"Throck,\" I cried.  \"What was it?  What are you flying from, man?\r\nWhere is your wife--and Stanton?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dead!\" he replied monotonously.  \"Dead!  All dead!\" Then as I\r\nrecoiled from him--\"All dead. Edith, Stanton, Thora--dead--or worse.\r\nAnd Edith in the Moon Pool--with them--drawn by what you saw on the\r\nmoon path--that has put its brand upon me--and follows me!\"\r\n\r\nHe ripped open his shirt.\r\n\r\n\"Look at this,\" he said.  Around his chest, above his heart, the skin\r\nwas white as pearl. This whiteness was sharply defined against the\r\nhealthy tint of the body. It circled him with an even cincture about\r\ntwo inches wide.\r\n\r\n\"Burn it!\" he said, and offered me his cigarette.  I drew back.  He\r\ngestured--peremptorily. I pressed the glowing end of the cigarette\r\ninto the ribbon of white flesh. He did not flinch nor was there odour\r\nof burning nor, as I drew the little cylinder away, any mark upon the\r\nwhiteness.\r\n\r\n\"Feel it!\" he commanded again.  I placed my fingers upon the band.  It\r\nwas cold--like frozen marble.\r\n\r\nHe drew his shirt around him.\r\n\r\n\"Two things you have seen,\" he said.  \"_It_--and its mark. Seeing,\r\nyou must believe my story. Goodwin, I tell you again that my wife is\r\ndead--or worse--I do not know; the prey of--what you saw; so, too, is\r\nStanton; so Thora. How--\"\r\n\r\nTears rolled down the seared face.\r\n\r\n\"Why did God let it conquer us?  Why did He let it take my Edith?\" he\r\ncried in utter bitterness. \"Are there things stronger than God, do you\r\nthink, Walter?\"\r\n\r\nI hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"Are there?  Are there?\" His wild eyes searched me.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know just how you define God,\" I managed at last through my\r\nastonishment to make answer. \"If you mean the will to know, working\r\nthrough science--\"\r\n\r\nHe waved me aside impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"Science,\" he said.  \"What is our science against--that? Or against\r\nthe science of whatever devils that made it--or made the way for it to\r\nenter this world of ours?\"\r\n\r\nWith an effort he regained control.\r\n\r\n\"Goodwin,\" he said, \"do you know at all of the ruins on the Carolines;\r\nthe cyclopean, megalithic cities and harbours of Ponape and Lele, of\r\nKusaie, of Ruk and Hogolu, and a score of other islets there?\r\nParticularly, do you know of the Nan-Matal and the Metalanim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of the Metalanim I have heard and seen photographs,\" I said.  \"They\r\ncall it, don't they, the Lost Venice of the Pacific?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look at this map,\" said Throckmartin.  \"That,\" he went on, \"is\r\nChristian's chart of Metalanim harbour and the Nan-Matal. Do you see\r\nthe rectangles marked Nan-Tauach?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"There,\" he said, \"under those walls is the Moon Pool and the seven\r\ngleaming lights that raise the Dweller in the Pool, and the altar and\r\nshrine of the Dweller. And there in the Moon Pool with it lie Edith\r\nand Stanton and Thora.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Dweller in the Moon Pool?\" I repeated half-incredulously.\r\n\r\n\"The Thing you saw,\" said Throckmartin solemnly.\r\n\r\nA solid sheet of rain swept the ports, and the Southern Queen began to\r\nroll on the rising swells. Throckmartin drew another deep breath of\r\nrelief, and drawing aside a curtain peered out into the night. Its\r\nblackness seemed to reassure him. At any rate, when he sat again he\r\nwas entirely calm.\r\n\r\n\"There are no more wonderful ruins in the world,\" he began almost\r\ncasually. \"They take in some fifty islets and cover with their\r\nintersecting canals and lagoons about twelve square miles. Who built\r\nthem? None knows. When were they built? Ages before the memory of\r\npresent man, that is sure. Ten thousand, twenty thousand, a hundred\r\nthousand years ago--the last more likely.\r\n\r\n\"All these islets, Walter, are squared, and their shores are frowning\r\nseawalls of gigantic basalt blocks hewn and put in place by the hands\r\nof ancient man. Each inner water-front is faced with a terrace of\r\nthose basalt blocks which stand out six feet above the shallow canals\r\nthat meander between them. On the islets behind these walls are\r\ntime-shattered fortresses, palaces, terraces, pyramids; immense\r\ncourtyards strewn with ruins--and all so old that they seem to wither\r\nthe eyes of those who look on them.\r\n\r\n\"There has been a great subsidence.  You can stand out of Metalanim\r\nharbour for three miles and look down upon the tops of similar\r\nmonolithic structures and walls twenty feet below you in the water.\r\n\r\n\"And all about, strung on their canals, are the bulwarked islets with\r\ntheir enigmatic walls peering through the dense growths of\r\nmangroves--dead, deserted for incalculable ages; shunned by those who\r\nlive near.\r\n\r\n\"You as a botanist are familiar with the evidence that a vast shadowy\r\ncontinent existed in the Pacific--a continent that was not rent\r\nasunder by volcanic forces as was that legendary one of Atlantis in\r\nthe Eastern Ocean.[1] My work in Java, in Papua, and in the Ladrones\r\nhad set my mind upon this Pacific lost land. Just as the Azores are\r\nbelieved to be the last high peaks of Atlantis, so hints came to me\r\nsteadily that Ponape and Lele and their basalt bulwarked islets were\r\nthe last points of the slowly sunken western land clinging still to\r\nthe sunlight, and had been the last refuge and sacred places of the\r\nrulers of that race which had lost their immemorial home under the\r\nrising waters of the Pacific.\r\n\r\n\"I believed that under these ruins I might find the evidence\r\nthat I sought.\r\n\r\n\"My--my wife and I had talked before we were married of making this\r\nour great work. After the honeymoon we prepared for the expedition.\r\nStanton was as enthusiastic as ourselves. We sailed, as you know, last\r\nMay for fulfilment of my dreams.\r\n\r\n\"At Ponape we selected, not without difficulty, workmen to help\r\nus--diggers. I had to make extraordinary inducements before I could\r\nget together my force. Their beliefs are gloomy, these Ponapeans. They\r\npeople their swamps, their forests, their mountains, and shores, with\r\nmalignant spirits--ani they call them. And they are afraid--bitterly\r\nafraid of the isles of ruins and what they think the ruins hide. I do\r\nnot wonder--now!\r\n\r\n\"When they were told where they were to go, and how long we expected\r\nto stay, they murmured. Those who, at last, were tempted made what I\r\nthought then merely a superstitious proviso that they were to be\r\nallowed to go away on the three nights of the full moon. Would to God\r\nwe had heeded them and gone too!\"\r\n\r\n\"We passed into Metalanim harbour.  Off to our left--a mile away arose\r\na massive quadrangle. Its walls were all of forty feet high and\r\nhundreds of feet on each side. As we drew by, our natives grew very\r\nsilent; watched it furtively, fearfully. I knew it for the ruins that\r\nare called Nan-Tauach, the 'place of frowning walls.' And at the\r\nsilence of my men I recalled what Christian had written of this place;\r\nof how he had come upon its 'ancient platforms and tetragonal\r\nenclosures of stonework; its wonder of tortuous alleyways and\r\nlabyrinth of shallow canals; grim masses of stonework peering out from\r\nbehind verdant screens; cyclopean barricades,' and of how, when he had\r\nturned 'into its ghostly shadows, straight-way the merriment of guides\r\nwas hushed and conversation died down to whispers.'\"\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a little time.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I wanted to pitch our camp there,\" he went on again\r\nquietly, \"but I soon gave up that idea. The natives were\r\npanic-stricken--threatened to turn back. 'No,' they said, 'too great\r\nani there. We go to any other place--but not there.'\r\n\r\n\"We finally picked for our base the islet called Uschen-Tau.  It was\r\nclose to the isle of desire, but far enough away from it to satisfy\r\nour men. There was an excellent camping-place and a spring of fresh\r\nwater. We pitched our tents, and in a couple of days the work was in\r\nfull swing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] For more detailed observations on these points refer to G.

G.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nThe Moon Rock\r\n\r\n\"I do not intend to tell you now,\" Throckmartin continued, \"the\r\nresults of the next two weeks, nor of what we found. Later--if I am\r\nallowed, I will lay all that before you. It is sufficient to say that\r\nat the end of those two weeks I had found confirmation for many of my\r\ntheories.\r\n\r\n\"The place, for all its decay and desolation, had not infected us with\r\nany touch of morbidity--that is not Edith, Stanton, or myself. But\r\nThora was very unhappy. She was a Swede, as you know, and in her blood\r\nran the beliefs and superstitions of the Northland--some of them so\r\nstrangely akin to those of this far southern land; beliefs of spirits\r\nof mountain and forest and water werewolves and beings malign. From\r\nthe first she showed a curious sensitivity to what, I suppose, may be\r\ncalled the 'influences' of the place. She said it 'smelled' of ghosts\r\nand warlocks.\r\n\r\n\"I laughed at her then--\r\n\r\n\"Two weeks slipped by, and at their end the spokesman for our natives\r\ncame to us. The next night was the full of the moon, he said. He\r\nreminded me of my promise. They would go back to their village in the\r\nmorning; they would return after the third night, when the moon had\r\nbegun to wane. They left us sundry charms for our 'protection,' and\r\nsolemnly cautioned us to keep as far away as possible from Nan-Tauach\r\nduring their absence. Half-exasperated, half-amused I watched them go.\r\n\r\n\"No work could be done without them, of course, so we decided to spend\r\nthe days of their absence junketing about the southern islets of the\r\ngroup. We marked down several spots for subsequent exploration, and on\r\nthe morning of the third day set forth along the east face of the\r\nbreakwater for our camp on Uschen-Tau, planning to have everything in\r\nreadiness for the return of our men the next day.\r\n\r\n\"We landed just before dusk, tired and ready for our cots.\r\nIt was only a little after ten o'clock that Edith awakened me.\r\n\r\n\"'Listen!' she said.  'Lean over with your ear close to the ground!'\r\n\r\n\"I did so, and seemed to hear, far, far below, as though coming up\r\nfrom great distances, a faint chanting. It gathered strength, died\r\ndown, ended; began, gathered volume, faded away into silence.\r\n\r\n\"'It's the waves rolling on rocks somewhere,' I said.  'We're probably\r\nover some ledge of rock that carries the sound.'\r\n\r\n\"'It's the first time I've heard it,' replied my wife doubtfully.  We\r\nlistened again. Then through the dim rhythms, deep beneath us, another\r\nsound came. It drifted across the lagoon that lay between us and\r\nNan-Tauach in little tinkling waves. It was music--of a sort; I won't\r\ndescribe the strange effect it had upon me. You've felt it--\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean on the deck?\" I asked.  Throckmartin nodded.\r\n\r\n\"I went to the flap of the tent,\" he continued, \"and peered out.\r\nAs I did so Stanton lifted his flap and walked out into the moonlight,\r\nlooking over to the other islet and listening. I called to him.\r\n\r\n\"'That's the queerest sound!' he said.  He listened again.\r\n'Crystalline! Like little notes of translucent glass. Like the bells\r\nof crystal on the sistrums of Isis at Dendarah Temple,' he added\r\nhalf-dreamily. We gazed intently at the island. Suddenly, on the\r\nsea-wall, moving slowly, rhythmically, we saw a little group of\r\nlights. Stanton laughed.\r\n\r\n\"'The beggars!' he exclaimed.  'That's why they wanted to get away, is\r\nit? Don't you see, Dave, it's some sort of a festival--rites of some\r\nkind that they hold during the full moon! That's why they were so\r\neager to have us _keep_ away, too.'\r\n\r\n\"The explanation seemed good.  I felt a curious sense of relief,\r\nalthough I had not been sensible of any oppression.\r\n\r\n\"'Let's slip over,' suggested Stanton--but I would not.\r\n\r\n\"'They're a difficult lot as it is,' I said.  'If we break into one of\r\ntheir religious ceremonies they'll probably never forgive us. Let's\r\nkeep out of any family party where we haven't been invited.'\r\n\r\n\"'That's so,' agreed Stanton.\r\n\r\n\"The strange tinkling rose and fell, rose and fell--\r\n\r\n\"'There's something--something very unsettling about it,' said Edith\r\nat last soberly. 'I wonder what they make those sounds with. They\r\nfrighten me half to death, and, at the same time, they make me feel as\r\nthough some enormous rapture were just around the corner.'\r\n\r\n\"'It's devilish uncanny!' broke in Stanton.\r\n\r\n\"And as he spoke the flap of Thora's tent was raised and out into the\r\nmoonlight strode the old Swede. She was the great Norse type--tall,\r\ndeep-breasted, moulded on the old Viking lines. Her sixty years had\r\nslipped from her. She looked like some ancient priestess of Odin.\r\n\r\n\"She stood there, her eyes wide, brilliant, staring.  She thrust her\r\nhead forward toward Nan-Tauach, regarding the moving lights; she\r\nlistened. Suddenly she raised her arms and made a curious gesture to\r\nthe moon. It was--an archaic--movement; she seemed to drag it from\r\nremote antiquity--yet in it was a strange suggestion of power, Twice\r\nshe repeated this gesture and--the tinklings died away! She turned to\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\"'Go!' she said, and her voice seemed to come from far distances.  'Go\r\nfrom here--and quickly! Go while you may. It has called--' She pointed\r\nto the islet. 'It knows you are here. It waits!' she wailed. 'It\r\nbeckons--the--the--\"\r\n\r\n\"She fell at Edith's feet, and over the lagoon came again the\r\ntinklings, now with a quicker note of jubilance--almost of triumph.\r\n\r\n\"We watched beside her throughout the night.  The sounds from\r\nNan-Tauach continued until about an hour before moon-set. In the\r\nmorning Thora awoke, none the worse, apparently. She had had bad\r\ndreams, she said. She could not remember what they were--except that\r\nthey had warned her of danger. She was oddly sullen, and throughout\r\nthe morning her gaze returned again and again half-fascinatedly,\r\nhalf-wonderingly to the neighbouring isle.\r\n\r\n\"That afternoon the natives returned.  And that night on Nan-Tauach\r\nthe silence was unbroken nor were there lights nor sign of life.\r\n\r\n\"You will understand, Goodwin, how the occurrences I have related\r\nwould excite the scientific curiosity. We rejected immediately, of\r\ncourse, any explanation admitting the supernatural.\r\n\r\n\"Our--symptoms let me call them--could all very easily be accounted\r\nfor. It is unquestionable that the vibrations created by certain\r\nmusical instruments have definite and sometimes extraordinary effect\r\nupon the nervous system. We accepted this as the explanation of the\r\nreactions we had experienced, hearing the unfamiliar sounds. Thora's\r\nnervousness, her superstitious apprehensions, had wrought her up to a\r\ncondition of semi-somnambulistic hysteria. Science could readily\r\nexplain her part in the night's scene.\r\n\r\n\"We came to the conclusion that there must be a passage-way between\r\nPonape and Nan-Tauach known to the natives--and used by them during\r\ntheir rites. We decided that on the next departure of our labourers we\r\nwould set forth immediately to Nan-Tauach. We would investigate during\r\nthe day, and at evening my wife and Thora would go back to camp,\r\nleaving Stanton and me to spend the night on the island, observing\r\nfrom some safe hiding-place what might occur.\r\n\r\n\"The moon waned; appeared crescent in the west; waxed slowly toward\r\nthe full. Before the men left us they literally prayed us to accompany\r\nthem. Their importunities only made us more eager to see what it was\r\nthat, we were now convinced, they wanted to conceal from us. At least\r\nthat was true of Stanton and myself. It was not true of Edith. She was\r\nthoughtful, abstracted--reluctant.\r\n\r\n\"When the men were out of sight around the turn of the harbour, we\r\ntook our boat and made straight for Nan-Tauach. Soon its mighty\r\nsea-wall towered above us. We passed through the water-gate with its\r\ngigantic hewn prisms of basalt and landed beside a half-submerged\r\npier. In front of us stretched a series of giant steps leading into a\r\nvast court strewn with fragments of fallen pillars. In the centre of\r\nthe court, beyond the shattered pillars, rose another terrace of\r\nbasalt blocks, concealing, I knew, still another enclosure.\r\n\r\n\"And now, Walter, for the better understanding of what\r\nfollows--and--and--\" he hesitated. \"Should you decide later to return\r\nwith me or, if I am taken, to--to--follow us--listen carefully to my\r\ndescription of this place: Nan-Tauach is literally three rectangles.\r\nThe first rectangle is the sea-wall, built up of monoliths--hewn and\r\nsquared, twenty feet wide at the top. To get to the gateway in the\r\nsea-wall you pass along the canal marked on the map between Nan-Tauach\r\nand the islet named Tau. The entrance to the canal is bidden by dense\r\nthickets of mangroves; once through these the way is clear. The steps\r\nlead up from the landing of the sea-gate through the entrance to the\r\ncourtyard.\r\n\r\n\"This courtyard is surrounded by another basalt wall, rectangular,\r\nfollowing with mathematical exactness the march of the outer\r\nbarricades. The sea-wall is from thirty to forty feet high--originally\r\nit must have been much higher, but there has been subsidence in parts.\r\nThe wall of the first enclosure is fifteen feet across the top and its\r\nheight varies from twenty to fifty feet--here, too, the gradual\r\nsinking of the land has caused portions of it to fall.\r\n\r\n\"Within this courtyard is the second enclosure.  Its terrace, of the\r\nsame basalt as the outer walls, is about twenty feet high. Entrance is\r\ngained to it by many breaches which time has made in its stonework.\r\nThis is the inner court, the heart of Nan-Tauach! There lies the great\r\ncentral vault with which is associated the one name of living being\r\nthat has come to us out of the mists of the past. The natives say it\r\nwas the treasure-house of Chau-te-leur, a mighty king who reigned long\r\n'before their fathers.' As Chan is the ancient Ponapean word both for\r\nsun and king, the name means, without doubt, 'place of the sun king.'\r\nIt is a memory of a dynastic name of the race that ruled the Pacific\r\ncontinent, now vanished--just as the rulers of ancient Crete took the\r\nname of Minos and the rulers of Egypt the name of Pharaoh.\r\n\r\n\"And opposite this place of the sun king is the moon rock that hides\r\nthe Moon Pool.\r\n\r\n\"It was Stanton who discovered the moon rock.  We had been inspecting\r\nthe inner courtyard; Edith and Thora were getting together our lunch.\r\nI came out of the vault of Chau-te-leur to find Stanton before a part\r\nof the terrace studying it wonderingly.\r\n\r\n\"'What do you make of this?' he asked me as I came up. He pointed to\r\nthe wall. I followed his finger and saw a slab of stone about fifteen\r\nfeet high and ten wide. At first all I noticed was the exquisite\r\nnicety with which its edges joined the blocks about it. Then I\r\nrealized that its colour was subtly different--tinged with grey and of\r\na smooth, peculiar--deadness.\r\n\r\n\"'Looks more like calcite than basalt,' I said.  I touched it and\r\nwithdrew my hand quickly for at the contact every nerve in my arm\r\ntingled as though a shock of frozen electricity had passed through it.\r\nIt was not cold as we know cold. It was a chill force--the phrase I\r\nhave used--frozen electricity--describes it better than anything else.\r\nStanton looked at me oddly.\r\n\r\n\"'So you felt it too,' he said.  'I was wondering whether I was\r\ndeveloping hallucinations like Thora. Notice, by the way, that the\r\nblocks beside it are quite warm beneath the sun.'\r\n\r\n\"We examined the slab eagerly.  Its edges were cut as though by an\r\nengraver of jewels. They fitted against the neighbouring blocks in\r\nalmost a hair-line. Its base was slightly curved, and fitted as\r\nclosely as top and sides upon the huge stones on which it rested. And\r\nthen we noted that these stones had been hollowed to follow the line\r\nof the grey stone's foot. There was a semicircular depression running\r\nfrom one side of the slab to the other. It was as though the grey rock\r\nstood in the centre of a shallow cup--revealing half, covering half.\r\nSomething about this hollow attracted me. I reached down and felt it.\r\nGoodwin, although the balance of the stones that formed it, like all\r\nthe stones of the courtyard, were rough and age-worn--this was as\r\nsmooth, as even surfaced as though it had just left the hands of the\r\npolisher.\r\n\r\n\"'It's a door!' exclaimed Stanton.  'It swings around in that little\r\ncup. That's what makes the hollow so smooth.'\r\n\r\n\"'Maybe you're right,' I replied.  'But how the devil can we open it?'\r\n\r\n\"We went over the slab again--pressing upon its edges, thrusting\r\nagainst its sides. During one of those efforts I happened to look\r\nup--and cried out. A foot above and on each side of the corner of the\r\ngrey rock's lintel was a slight convexity, visible only from the angle\r\nat which my gaze struck it.\r\n\r\n\"We carried with us a small scaling-ladder and up this I went.  The\r\nbosses were apparently nothing more than chiseled curvatures in the\r\nstone. I laid my hand on the one I was examining, and drew it back\r\nsharply. In my palm, at the base of my thumb, I had felt the same\r\nshock that I had in touching the slab below. I put my hand back. The\r\nimpression came from a spot not more than an inch wide. I went\r\ncarefully over the entire convexity, and six times more the chill ran\r\nthrough my arm. There were seven circles an inch wide in the curved\r\nplace, each of which communicated the precise sensation I have\r\ndescribed. The convexity on the opposite side of the slab gave exactly\r\nthe same results. But no amount of touching or of pressing these spots\r\nsingly or in any combination gave the slightest promise of motion to\r\nthe slab itself.\r\n\r\n\"'And yet--they're what open it,' said Stanton positively.\r\n\r\n\"'Why do you say that?' I asked.\r\n\r\n\"'I--don't know,' he answered hesitatingly.  'But something tells me\r\nso. Throck,' he went on half earnestly, half laughingly, 'the purely\r\nscientific part of me is fighting the purely human part of me. The\r\nscientific part is urging me to find some way to get that slab either\r\ndown or open. The human part is just as strongly urging me to do\r\nnothing of the sort and get away while I can!'\r\n\r\n\"He laughed again--shamefacedly.\r\n\r\n\"'Which shall it be?' he asked--and I thought that in his tone the\r\nhuman side of him was ascendant.\r\n\r\n\"'It will probably stay as it is--unless we blow it to bits,' I said.\r\n\r\n\"'I thought of that,' he answered, 'and I wouldn't dare,' he added\r\nsoberly enough. And even as I had spoken there came to me the same\r\nfeeling that he had expressed. It was as though something passed out\r\nof the grey rock that struck my heart as a hand strikes an impious\r\nlip. We turned away--uneasily, and faced Thora coming through a breach\r\non the terrace.\r\n\r\n\"'Miss Edith wants you quick,' she began--and stopped. Her eyes went\r\npast me to the grey rock. Her body grew rigid; she took a few stiff\r\nsteps forward and then ran straight to it. She cast herself upon its\r\nbreast, hands and face pressed against it; we heard her scream as\r\nthough her very soul were being drawn from her--and watched her fall\r\nat its foot. As we picked her up I saw steal from her face the look I\r\nhad observed when first we heard the crystal music of\r\nNan-Tauach--that unhuman mingling of opposites!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nThe First Vanishings\r\n\r\n\"We carried Thora back, down to where Edith was waiting. We told her\r\nwhat had happened and what we had found. She listened gravely, and as\r\nwe finished Thora sighed and opened her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"'I would like to see the stone,' she said.  'Charles, you stay here\r\nwith Thora.' We passed through the outer court silently--and stood\r\nbefore the rock. She touched it, drew back her hand as I had; thrust\r\nit forward again resolutely and held it there. She seemed to be\r\nlistening. Then she turned to me.\r\n\r\n\"'David,' said my wife, and the wistfulness in her voice hurt\r\nme--'David, would you be very, very disappointed if we went from\r\nhere--without trying to find out any more about it--would you?'\r\n\r\n\"Walter, I never wanted anything so much in my life as I wanted to\r\nlearn what that rock concealed. Nevertheless, I tried to master my\r\ndesire, and I answered--'Edith, not a bit if you want us to do it.'\r\n\r\n\"She read my struggle in my eyes.  She turned back toward the grey\r\nrock. I saw a shiver pass through her. I felt a tinge of remorse and\r\npity!\r\n\r\n\"'Edith,' I exclaimed, 'we'll go!'\r\n\r\n\"She looked at me again.  'Science is a jealous mistress,' she quoted.\r\n'No, after all it may be just fancy. At any rate, you can't run away.\r\nNo! But, Dave, I'm going to stay too!'\r\n\r\n\"And there was no changing her decision.  As we neared the others she\r\nlaid a hand on my arm.\r\n\r\n\"'Dave,' she said, 'if there should be something--well--inexplicable\r\ntonight--something that seems--too dangerous--will you promise to go\r\nback to our own islet tomorrow, if we can--and wait until the natives\r\nreturn?'\r\n\r\n\"I promised eagerly--the desire to stay and see what came with the\r\nnight was like a fire within me.\r\n\r\n\"We picked a place about five hundred feet away from the steps leading\r\ninto the outer court.\r\n\r\n\"The spot we had selected was well hidden.  We could not be seen, and\r\nyet we had a clear view of the stairs and the gateway. We settled down\r\njust before dusk to wait for whatever might come. I was nearest the\r\ngiant steps; next me Edith; then Thora, and last Stanton.\r\n\r\n\"Night fell.  After a time the eastern sky began to lighten, and we\r\nknew that the moon was rising; grew lighter still, and the orb peeped\r\nover the sea; swam into full sight. I glanced at Edith and then at\r\nThora. My wife was intently listening. Thora sat, as she had since we\r\nhad placed ourselves, elbows on knees, her hands covering her face.\r\n\r\n\"And then from the moonlight flooding us there dripped down on me a\r\ngreat drowsiness. Sleep seemed to seep from the rays and fall upon my\r\neyes, closing them--closing them inexorably. Edith's hand in mine\r\nrelaxed. Stanton's head fell upon his breast and his body swayed\r\ndrunkenly. I tried to rise--to fight against the profound desire for\r\nslumber that pressed on me.\r\n\r\n\"And as I fought, Thora raised her head as though listening; and\r\nturned toward the gateway. There was infinite despair in her face--and\r\nexpectancy. I tried again to rise--and a surge of sleep rushed over\r\nme. Dimly, as I sank within it, I heard a crystalline chiming; raised\r\nmy lids once more with a supreme effort.\r\n\r\n\"Thora, bathed in light, was standing at the top of the stairs.\r\n\r\n\"Sleep took me for its very own--swept me into the heart of oblivion!\r\n\r\n\"Dawn was breaking when I wakened.  Recollection rushed back; I thrust\r\na panic-stricken hand out toward Edith; touched her and my heart gave\r\na great leap of thankfulness. She stirred, sat up, rubbing dazed eyes.\r\nStanton lay on his side, back toward us, head in arms.\r\n\r\n\"Edith looked at me laughingly.  'Heavens!  What sleep!' she said.\r\nMemory came to her.\r\n\r\n\"'What happened?' she whispered.  'What made us sleep like that?'\r\n\r\n\"Stanton awoke.\r\n\r\n\"'What's the matter!' he exclaimed.  'You look as though you've been\r\nseeing ghosts.'\r\n\r\n\"Edith caught my hands.\r\n\r\n\"'Where's Thora?' she cried.  Before I could answer she had run out\r\ninto the open, calling.\r\n\r\n\"'Thora was taken,' was all I could say to Stanton, 'together we went\r\nto my wife, now standing beside the great stone steps, looking up\r\nfearfully at the gateway into the terraces. There I told them what I\r\nhad seen before sleep had drowned me. And together then we ran up the\r\nstairs, through the court and to the grey rock.\r\n\r\n\"The slab was closed as it had been the day before, nor was there\r\ntrace of its having opened. No trace? Even as I thought this Edith\r\ndropped to her knees before it and reached toward something lying at\r\nits foot. It was a little piece of gay silk. I knew it for part of the\r\nkerchief Thora wore about her hair. She lifted the fragment. It had\r\nbeen cut from the kerchief as though by a razor-edge; a few threads\r\nran from it--down toward the base of the slab; ran on to the base of\r\nthe grey rock and--under it!\r\n\r\n\"The grey rock was a door!  And it had opened and Thora had passed\r\nthrough it!\r\n\r\n\"I think that for the next few minutes we all were a little insane.\r\nWe beat upon that portal with our hands, with stones and sticks. At\r\nlast reason came back to us.\r\n\r\n\"Goodwin, during the next two hours we tried every way in our power to\r\nforce entrance through the slab. The rock resisted our drills. We\r\ntried explosions at the base with charges covered by rock. They made\r\nnot the slightest impression on the surface, expending their force, of\r\ncourse, upon the slighter resistance of their coverings.\r\n\r\n\"Afternoon found us hopeless.  Night was coming on and we would have\r\nto decide our course of action. I wanted to go to Ponape for help. But\r\nEdith objected that this would take hours and after we had reached\r\nthere it would be impossible to persuade our men to return with us\r\nthat night, if at all. What then was left? Clearly only one of two\r\nchoices: to go back to our camp, wait for our men, and on their return\r\ntry to persuade them to go with us to Nan-Tauach. But this would mean\r\nthe abandonment of Thora for at least two days. We could not do it; it\r\nwould have been too cowardly.\r\n\r\n\"The other choice was to wait where we were for night to come; to wait\r\nfor the rock to open as it had the night before, and to make a sortie\r\nthrough it for Thora before it could close again.\r\n\r\n\"Our path lay clear before us.  We had to spend that night on\r\nNan-Tauach!\r\n\r\n\"We had, of course, discussed the sleep phenomena very fully.  If our\r\ntheory that lights, sounds, and Thora's disappearance were linked with\r\nsecret religious rites of the natives, the logical inference was that\r\nthe slumber had been produced by them, perhaps by vapours--you know as\r\nwell as I, what extraordinary knowledge these Pacific peoples have of\r\nsuch things. Or the sleep might have been simply a coincidence and\r\nproduced by emanations either gaseous or from plants, natural causes\r\nwhich had happened to coincide in their effects with the other\r\nmanifestations. We made some rough and ready but effective\r\nrespirators.\r\n\r\n\"As dusk fell we looked over our weapons.  Edith was an excellent shot\r\nwith both rifle and pistol. We had decided that my wife was to remain\r\nin the hiding-place. Stanton would take up a station on the far side\r\nof the stairway and I would place myself opposite him on the side near\r\nEdith. The place I picked out was less than two hundred feet from her,\r\nand I could reassure myself now and then as to her safety as it looked\r\ndown upon the hollow wherein she crouched. From our respective\r\nstations Stanton and I could command the gateway entrance. His\r\nposition gave him also a glimpse of the outer courtyard.\r\n\r\n\"A faint glow in the sky heralded the moon.  Stanton and I took our\r\nplaces. The moon dawn increased rapidly; the disk swam up, and in a\r\nmoment it was shining in full radiance upon ruins and sea.\r\n\r\n\"As it rose there came a curious little sighing sound from the inner\r\nterrace. Stanton straightened up and stared intently through the\r\ngateway, rifle ready.\r\n\r\n\"'Stanton, what do you see?' I called cautiously.  He waved a\r\nsilencing hand. I turned my head to look at Edith. A shock ran through\r\nme. She lay upon her side. Her face, grotesque with its nose and mouth\r\ncovered by the respirator, was turned full toward the moon. She was\r\nagain in deepest sleep!\r\n\r\n\"As I turned again to call to Stanton, my eyes swept the head of the\r\nsteps and stopped, fascinated. For the moonlight had thickened. It\r\nseemed to be--curdled--there; and through it ran little gleams and\r\nveins of shimmering white fire. A languor passed through me. It was\r\nnot the ineffable drowsiness of the preceding night. It was a sapping\r\nof all will to move. I tried to cry out to Stanton. I had not even the\r\nwill to move my lips. Goodwin--I could not even move my eyes!\r\n\r\n\"Stanton was in the range of my fixed vision.  I watched him leap up\r\nthe steps and move toward the gateway. The curdled radiance seemed to\r\nawait him. He stepped into it--and was lost to my sight.\r\n\r\n\"For a dozen heart beats there was silence.  Then a rain of tinklings\r\nthat set the pulses racing with joy and at once checked them with tiny\r\nfingers of ice--and ringing through them Stanton's voice from the\r\ncourtyard--a great cry--a scream--filled with ecstasy insupportable\r\nand horror unimaginable! And once more there was silence. I strove to\r\nburst the bonds that held me. I could not. Even my eyelids were fixed.\r\nWithin them my eyes, dry and aching, burned.\r\n\r\n\"Then Goodwin--I first saw the--inexplicable!  The crystalline music\r\nswelled. Where I sat I could take in the gateway and its basalt\r\nportals, rough and broken, rising to the top of the wall forty feet\r\nabove, shattered, ruined portals--unclimbable. From this gateway an\r\nintenser light began to flow. It grew, it gushed, and out of it walked\r\nStanton.\r\n\r\n\"Stanton!  But--God!  What a vision!\"\r\n\r\nA deep tremor shook him.  I waited--waited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nInto the Moon Pool\r\n\r\n\"Goodwin,\" Throckmartin went on at last, \"I can describe him only as a\r\nthing of living light. He radiated light; was filled with light;\r\noverflowed with it. A shining cloud whirled through and around him in\r\nradiant swirls, shimmering tentacles, luminescent, coruscating\r\nspirals.\r\n\r\n\"His face shone with a rapture too great to be borne by living man,\r\nand was shadowed with insuperable misery. It was as though it had been\r\nremoulded by the hand of God and the hand of Satan, working together\r\nand in harmony. You have seen that seal upon my own. But you have\r\nnever seen it in the degree that Stanton bore it. The eyes were wide\r\nopen and fixed, as though upon some inward vision of hell and heaven!\r\n\r\n\"The light that filled and surrounded him had a nucleus, a\r\ncore--something shiftingly human shaped--that dissolved and changed,\r\ngathered itself, whirled through and beyond him and back again. And as\r\nits shining nucleus passed through him Stanton's whole body pulsed\r\nradiance. As the luminescence moved, there moved above it, still and\r\nserene always, seven tiny globes of seven colors, like seven little\r\nmoons.\r\n\r\n\"Then swiftly Stanton was lifted--levitated--up the unscalable wall\r\nand to its top. The glow faded from the moonlight, the tinkling music\r\ngrew fainter. I tried again to move. The tears were running down now\r\nfrom my rigid lids and they brought relief to my tortured eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I have said my gaze was fixed.  It was.  But from the side,\r\nperipherally, it took in a part of the far wall of the outer\r\nenclosure. Ages seemed to pass and a radiance stole along it. Soon\r\ndrifted into sight the figure that was Stanton. Far away he was--on\r\nthe gigantic wall. But still I could see the shining spirals whirling\r\njubilantly around and through him; felt rather than saw his tranced\r\nface beneath the seven moons. A swirl of crystal notes, and he had\r\npassed. And all the time, as though from some opened well of light,\r\nthe courtyard gleamed and sent out silver fires that dimmed the\r\nmoonrays, yet seemed strangely to be a part of them.\r\n\r\n\"At last the moon neared the horizon.  There came a louder burst of\r\nsound; the second, and last, cry of Stanton, like an echo of his\r\nfirst! Again the soft sighing from the inner terrace. Then--utter\r\nsilence!\r\n\r\n\"The light faded; the moon was setting and with a rush life and power\r\nto move returned to me. I made a leap for the steps, rushed up them,\r\nthrough the gateway and straight to the grey rock. It was closed--as I\r\nknew it would be. But did I dream it or did I hear, echoing through it\r\nas though from vast distances a triumphant shouting?\r\n\r\n\"I ran back to Edith.  At my touch she wakened; looked at me\r\nwanderingly; raised herself on a hand.\r\n\r\n\"'Dave!' she said, 'I slept--after all.' She saw the despair on my\r\nface and leaped to her feet. 'Dave!' she cried. 'What is it? Where's\r\nCharles?'\r\n\r\n\"I lighted a fire before I spoke.  Then I told her.  And for the\r\nbalance of that night we sat before the flames, arms around each\r\nother--like two frightened children.\"\r\n\r\nAbruptly Throckmartin held his hands out to me appealingly.\r\n\r\n\"Walter, old friend!\" he cried.  \"Don't look at me as though I were\r\nmad. It's truth, absolute truth. Wait--\" I comforted him as well as I\r\ncould. After a little time he took up his story.\r\n\r\n\"Never,\" he said, \"did man welcome the sun as we did that morning.  A\r\nsoon as it had risen we went back to the courtyard. The walls whereon\r\nI had seen Stanton were black and silent. The terraces were as they\r\nhad been. The grey slab was in its place. In the shallow hollow at its\r\nbase was--nothing. Nothing--nothing was there anywhere on the islet\r\nof Stanton--not a trace.\r\n\r\n\"What were we to do?  Precisely the same arguments that had kept us\r\nthere the night before held good now--and doubly good. We could not\r\nabandon these two; could not go as long as there was the faintest hope\r\nof finding them--and yet for love of each other how could we remain? I\r\nloved my wife,--how much I never knew until that day; and she loved me\r\nas deeply.\r\n\r\n\"'It takes only one each night,' she pleaded.  'Beloved, let it take\r\nme.'\r\n\r\n\"I wept, Walter.  We both wept.\r\n\r\n\"'We will meet it together,' she said.  And it was thus at last that\r\nwe arranged it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That took great courage indeed, Throckmartin,\" I interrupted.  He\r\nlooked at me eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"You do believe then?\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"I believe,\" I said.  He pressed my hand with a grip that nearly\r\ncrushed it.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" he told me.  \"I do not fear.  If I--fail, you will follow with\r\nhelp?\"\r\n\r\nI promised.\r\n\r\n\"We talked it over carefully,\" he went on, \"bringing to bear all our\r\npower of analysis and habit of calm, scientific thought. We considered\r\nminutely the time element in the phenomena. Although the deep chanting\r\nbegan at the very moment of moonrise, fully five minutes had passed\r\nbetween its full lifting and the strange sighing sound from the inner\r\nterrace. I went back in memory over the happenings of the night\r\nbefore. At least ten minutes had intervened between the first\r\nheralding sigh and the intensification of the moonlight in the\r\ncourtyard. And this glow grew for at least ten minutes more before the\r\nfirst burst of the crystal notes. Indeed, more than half an hour must\r\nhave elapsed, I calculated, between the moment the moon showed above\r\nthe horizon and the first delicate onslaught of the tinklings.\r\n\r\n\"'Edith!' I cried.  'I think I have it!  The grey rock opens five\r\nminutes after upon the moonrise. But whoever or whatever it is that\r\ncomes through it must wait until the moon has risen higher, or else it\r\nmust come from a distance. The thing to do is not to wait for it, but\r\nto surprise it before it passes out the door. We will go into the\r\ninner court early. You will take your rifle and pistol and hide\r\nyourself where you can command the opening--if the slab does open. The\r\ninstant it opens I will enter. It's our best chance, Edith. I think\r\nit's our only one.'\r\n\r\n\"My wife demurred strongly.  She wanted to go with me. But I convinced\r\nher that it was better for her to stand guard without, prepared to\r\nhelp me if I were forced again into the open by what lay behind the\r\nrock.\r\n\r\n\"At the half-hour before moonrise we went into the inner court.  I\r\ntook my place at the side of the grey rock. Edith crouched behind a\r\nbroken pillar twenty feet away; slipped her rifle-barrel over it so\r\nthat it would cover the opening.\r\n\r\n\"The minutes crept by.  The darkness lessened and through the breaches\r\nof the terrace I watched the far sky softly lighten. With the first\r\npale flush the silence of the place intensified. It deepened; became\r\nunbearably--expectant. The moon rose, showed the quarter, the half,\r\nthen swam up into full sight like a great bubble.\r\n\r\n\"Its rays fell upon the wall before me and suddenly upon the\r\nconvexities I have described seven little circles of light sprang out.\r\nThey gleamed, glimmered, grew brighter--shone. The gigantic slab\r\nbefore me glowed with them, silver wavelets of phosphorescence pulsed\r\nover its surface and then--it turned as though on a pivot, sighing\r\nsoftly as it moved!\r\n\r\n\"With a word to Edith I flung myself through the opening. A tunnel\r\nstretched before me. It glowed with the same faint silvery radiance.\r\nDown it I raced. The passage turned abruptly, passed parallel to the\r\nwalls of the outer courtyard and then once more led downward.\r\n\r\n\"The passage ended.  Before me was a high vaulted arch. It seemed to\r\nopen into space; a space filled with lambent, coruscating,\r\nmany-coloured mist whose brightness grew even as I watched. I passed\r\nthrough the arch and stopped in sheer awe!\r\n\r\n\"In front of me was a pool.  It was circular, perhaps twenty feet\r\nwide. Around it ran a low, softly curved lip of glimmering silvery\r\nstone. Its water was palest blue. The pool with its silvery rim was\r\nlike a great blue eye staring upward.\r\n\r\n\"Upon it streamed seven shafts of radiance.  They poured down upon the\r\nblue eye like cylindrical torrents; they were like shining pillars of\r\nlight rising from a sapphire floor.\r\n\r\n\"One was the tender pink of the pearl; one of the aurora's green; a\r\nthird a deathly white; the fourth the blue in mother-of-pearl; a\r\nshimmering column of pale amber; a beam of amethyst; a shaft of molten\r\nsilver. Such are the colours of the seven lights that stream upon the\r\nMoon Pool. I drew closer, awestricken. The shafts did not illumine the\r\ndepths. They played upon the surface and seemed there to diffuse, to\r\nmelt into it. The Pool drank them?\r\n\r\n\"Through the water tiny gleams of phosphorescence began to dart,\r\nsparkles and coruscations of pale incandescence. And far, far below I\r\nsensed a movement, a shifting glow as of a radiant body slowly rising.\r\n\r\n\"I looked upward, following the radiant pillars to their source.  Far\r\nabove were seven shining globes, and it was from these that the rays\r\npoured. Even as I watched their brightness grew. They were like seven\r\nmoons set high in some caverned heaven. Slowly their splendour\r\nincreased, and with it the splendour of the seven beams streaming from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"I tore my gaze away and stared at the Pool.  It had grown milky,\r\nopalescent. The rays gushing into it seemed to be filling it; it was\r\nalive with sparklings, scintillations, glimmerings. And the\r\nluminescence I had seen rising from its depths was larger, nearer!\r\n\r\n\"A swirl of mist floated up from its surface.  It drifted within the\r\nembrace of the rosy beam and hung there for a moment. The beam seemed\r\nto embrace it, sending through it little shining corpuscles, tiny rosy\r\nspiralings. The mist absorbed the rays, was strengthened by them,\r\ngained substance. Another swirl sprang into the amber shaft, clung and\r\nfed there, moved swiftly toward the first and mingled with it. And now\r\nother swirls arose, here and there, too fast to be counted; hung\r\npoised in the embrace of the light streams; flashed and pulsed into\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n\"Thicker and thicker still they arose until over the surface of the\r\nPool was a pulsating pillar of opalescent mist steadily growing\r\nstronger; drawing within it life from the seven beams falling upon it;\r\ndrawing to it from below the darting, incandescent atoms of the Pool.\r\nInto its centre was passing the luminescence rising from the far\r\ndepths. And the pillar glowed, throbbed--began to send out questing\r\nswirls and tendrils--\r\n\r\n\"There forming before me was That which had walked with Stanton, which\r\nhad taken Thora--the thing I had come to find!\r\n\r\n\"My brain sprang into action.  My hand threw up the pistol and I fired\r\nshot after shot into the shining core.\r\n\r\n\"As I fired, it swayed and shook; gathered again.  I slipped a second\r\nclip into the automatic and another idea coming to me took careful aim\r\nat one of the globes in the roof. From thence I knew came the force\r\nthat shaped this Dweller in the Pool--from the pouring rays came its\r\nstrength. If I could destroy them I could check its forming. I fired\r\nagain and again. If I hit the globes I did no damage. The little motes\r\nin their beams danced with the motes in the mist, troubled. That was\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\"But up from the Pool like little bells, like tiny bursting bubbles of\r\nglass, swarmed the tinkling sounds--their pitch higher, all their\r\nsweetness lost, angry.\r\n\r\n\"And out from the Inexplicable swept a shining spiral.\r\n\r\n\"It caught me above the heart; wrapped itself around me. There rushed\r\nthrough me a mingled ecstasy and horror. Every atom of me quivered\r\nwith delight and shrank with despair. There was nothing loathsome in\r\nit. But it was as though the icy soul of evil and the fiery soul of\r\ngood had stepped together within me. The pistol dropped from my hand.\r\n\r\n\"So I stood while the Pool gleamed and sparkled; the streams of light\r\ngrew more intense and the radiant Thing that held me gleamed and\r\nstrengthened. Its shining core had shape--but a shape that my eyes and\r\nbrain could not define. It was as though a being of another sphere\r\nshould assume what it might of human semblance, but was not able to\r\nconceal that what human eyes saw was but a part of it. It was neither\r\nman nor woman; it was unearthly and androgynous. Even as I found its\r\nhuman semblance it changed. And still the mingled rapture and terror\r\nheld me. Only in a little corner of my brain dwelt something\r\nuntouched; something that held itself apart and watched. Was it the\r\nsoul? I have never believed--and yet--\r\n\r\n\"Over the head of the misty body there sprang suddenly out seven\r\nlittle lights. Each was the colour of the beam beneath which it\r\nrested. I knew now that the Dweller was--complete!\r\n\r\n\"I heard a scream.  It was Edith's voice.  It came to me that she had\r\nheard the shots and followed me. I felt every faculty concentrate into\r\na mighty effort. I wrenched myself free from the gripping tentacle and\r\nit swept back. I turned to catch Edith, and as I did so slipped--fell.\r\n\r\n\"The radiant shape above the Pool leaped swiftly--and straight into it\r\nraced Edith, arms outstretched to shield me from it! God!\r\n\r\n\"She threw herself squarely within its splendour,\" he whispered.  \"It\r\nwrapped its shining self around her. The crystal tinklings burst forth\r\njubilantly. The light filled her, ran through and around her as it had\r\nwith Stanton; and dropped down upon her face--the look!\r\n\r\n\"But her rush had taken her to the very verge of the Moon Pool.  She\r\ntottered; she fell--with the radiance still holding her, still\r\nswirling and winding around and through her--into the Moon Pool! She\r\nsank, and with her went--the Dweller!\r\n\r\n\"I dragged myself to the brink.  Far down was a shining, many-coloured\r\nnebulous cloud descending; out of it peered Edith's face,\r\ndisappearing; her eyes stared up at me--and she vanished!\r\n\r\n\"'Edith!' I cried again.  'Edith, come back to me!'\r\n\r\n\"And then a darkness fell upon me.  I remember running back through\r\nthe shimmering corridors and out into the courtyard. Reason had left\r\nme. When it returned I was far out at sea in our boat wholly estranged\r\nfrom civilization. A day later I was picked up by the schooner in\r\nwhich I came to Port Moresby.\r\n\r\n\"I have formed a plan; you must hear it, Goodwin--\" He fell upon his\r\nberth. I bent over him. Exhaustion and the relief of telling his story\r\nhad been too much for him. He slept like the dead.\r\n\r\nAll that night I watched over him.  When dawn broke I went to my room\r\nto get a little sleep myself. But my slumber was haunted.\r\n\r\nThe next day the storm was unabated.  Throckmartin came to me at\r\nlunch. He had regained much of his old alertness.\r\n\r\n\"Come to my cabin,\" he said.  There, he stripped his shirt from him.\r\n\"Something is happening,\" he said. \"The mark is smaller.\" It was as he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"I'm escaping,\" he whispered jubilantly, \"Just let me get to Melbourne\r\nsafely, and then we'll see who'll win! For, Walter, I'm not at all\r\nsure that Edith is dead--as we know death--nor that the others are.\r\nThere is something outside experience there--some great mystery.\"\r\n\r\nAnd all that day he talked to me of his plans.\r\n\r\n\"There's a natural explanation, of course,\" he said.  \"My theory is\r\nthat the moon rock is of some composition sensitive to the action of\r\nmoon rays; somewhat as the metal selenium is to sun rays. The little\r\ncircles over the top are, without doubt, its operating agency. When\r\nthe light strikes them they release the mechanism that opens the slab,\r\njust as you can open doors with sun or electric light by an ingenious\r\narrangement of selenium-cells. Apparently it takes the strength of the\r\nfull moon both to do this and to summon the Dweller in the Pool. We\r\nwill first try a concentration of the rays of the waning moon upon\r\nthese circles to see whether that will open the rock. If it does we\r\nwill be able to investigate the Pool without interruption\r\nfrom--from--what emanates.\r\n\r\n\"Look, here on the chart are their locations.  I have made this in\r\nduplicate for you in the event--of something happening--to me. And if\r\nI lose--you'll come after us, Goodwin, with help--won't you?\"\r\n\r\nAnd again I promised.\r\n\r\nA little later he complained of increasing sleepiness.\r\n\r\n\"But it's just weariness,\" he said.  \"Not at all like that other\r\ndrowsiness. It's an hour till moonrise still,\" he yawned at last.\r\n\"Wake me up a good fifteen minutes before.\"\r\n\r\nHe lay upon the berth.  I sat thinking.  I came to myself with a\r\nguilty start. I had completely lost myself in my deep preoccupation.\r\nWhat time was it? I looked at my watch and jumped to the port-hole. It\r\nwas full moonlight; the orb had been up for fully half an hour. I\r\nstrode over to Throckmartin and shook him by the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Up, quick, man!\" I cried.  He rose sleepily.  His shirt fell open at\r\nthe neck and I looked, in amazement, at the white band around his\r\nchest. Even under the electric light it shone softly, as though little\r\nflecks of light were in it.\r\n\r\nThrockmartin seemed only half-awake.  He looked down at his breast,\r\nsaw the glowing cincture, and smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said drowsily, \"it's coming--to take me back to Edith!\r\nWell, I'm glad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Throckmartin!\" I cried.  \"Wake up!  Fight!\"\r\n\r\n\"Fight!\" he said.  \"No use; come after us!\"\r\n\r\nHe went to the port and sleepily drew aside the curtain. The moon\r\ntraced a broad path of light straight to the ship. Under its rays the\r\nband around his chest gleamed brighter and brighter; shot forth little\r\nrays; seemed to writhe.\r\n\r\nThe lights went out in the cabin; evidently also throughout the ship,\r\nfor I heard shoutings above.\r\n\r\nThrockmartin still stood at the open port.  Over his shoulder I saw a\r\ngleaming pillar racing along the moon path toward us. Through the\r\nwindow cascaded a blinding radiance. It gathered Throckmartin to it,\r\nclothed him in a robe of living opalescence. Light pulsed through and\r\nfrom him. The cabin filled with murmurings--\r\n\r\nA wave of weakness swept over me, buried me in blackness.  When\r\nconsciousness came back, the lights were again burning brightly.\r\n\r\nBut of Throckmartin there was no trace!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\"The Shining Devil Took Them!\"\r\n\r\nMy colleagues of the Association, and you others who may read this my\r\nnarrative, for what I did and did not when full realization returned I\r\nmust offer here, briefly as I can, an explanation; a defense--if you\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nMy first act was to spring to the open port.  The coma had lasted\r\nhours, for the moon was now low in the west! I ran to the door to\r\nsound the alarm. It resisted under my frantic hands; would not open.\r\nSomething fell tinkling to the floor. It was the key and I remembered\r\nthen that Throckmartin had turned it before we began our vigil. With\r\nmemory a hope died that I had not known was in me, the hope that he\r\nhad escaped from the cabin, found refuge elsewhere on the ship.\r\n\r\nAnd as I stooped, fumbling with shaking fingers for the key, a thought\r\ncame to me that drove again the blood from my heart, held me rigid. I\r\ncould sound no alarm on the Southern Queen for Throckmartin!\r\n\r\nConviction of my appalling helplessness was complete. The ensemble of\r\nthe vessel from captain to cabin boy was, to put it conservatively,\r\naverage. None, I knew, save Throckmartin and myself had seen the first\r\napparition of the Dweller. Had they witnessed the second? I did not\r\nknow, nor could I risk speaking, not knowing. And not seeing, how\r\ncould they believe? They would have thought me insane--or worse;\r\neven, it might be, his murderer.\r\n\r\nI snapped off the electrics; waited and listened; opened the door with\r\ninfinite caution and slipped, unseen, into my own stateroom. The hours\r\nuntil the dawn were eternities of waking nightmare. Reason, resuming\r\nsway at last, steadied me. Even had I spoken and been believed where\r\nin these wastes after all the hours could we search for Throckmartin?\r\nCertainly the captain would not turn back to Port Moresby. And even if\r\nhe did, of what use for me to set forth for the Nan-Matal without the\r\nequipment which Throckmartin himself had decided was necessary if one\r\nhoped to cope with the mystery that lurked there?\r\n\r\nThere was but one thing to do--follow his instructions; get the\r\nparaphernalia in Melbourne or Sydney if it were possible; if not sail\r\nto America as swiftly as might be, secure it there and as swiftly\r\nreturn to Ponape. And this I determined to do.\r\n\r\nCalmness came back to me after I had made this decision. And when I\r\nwent up on deck I knew that I had been right. They had not seen the\r\nDweller. They were still discussing the darkening of the ship, talking\r\nof dynamos burned out, wires short circuited, a half dozen\r\nexplanations of the extinguishment. Not until noon was Throckmartin's\r\nabsence discovered. I told the captain that I had left him early in\r\nthe evening; that, indeed, I knew him but slightly, after all. It\r\noccurred to none to doubt me, or to question me minutely. Why should\r\nit have? His strangeness had been noted, commented upon; all who had\r\nmet him had thought him half mad. I did little to discourage the\r\nimpression. And so it came naturally that on the log it was entered\r\nthat he had fallen or leaped from the vessel some time during the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nA report to this effect was made when we entered Melbourne.  I slipped\r\nquietly ashore and in the press of the war news Throckmartin's\r\nsupposed fate won only a few lines in the newspapers; my own presence\r\non the ship and in the city passed unnoticed.\r\n\r\nI was fortunate in securing at Melbourne everything I needed except a\r\nset of Becquerel ray condensers--but these were the very keystone of\r\nmy equipment. Pursuing my search to Sydney I was doubly fortunate in\r\nfinding a firm who were expecting these very articles in a consignment\r\ndue them from the States within a fortnight. I settled down in\r\nstrictest seclusion to await their arrival.\r\n\r\nAnd now it will occur to you to ask why I did not cable, during this\r\nperiod of waiting, to the Association; demand aid from it. Or why I\r\ndid not call upon members of the University staffs of either Melbourne\r\nor Sydney for assistance. At the least, why I did not gather, as\r\nThrockmartin had hoped to do, a little force of strong men to go with\r\nme to the Nan-Matal.\r\n\r\nTo the first two questions I answer frankly--I did not dare. And this\r\nreluctance, this inhibition, every man jealous of his scientific\r\nreputation will understand. The story of Throckmartin, the happenings\r\nI had myself witnessed, were incredible, abnormal, outside the facts\r\nof all known science. I shrank from the inevitable disbelief, perhaps\r\nridicule--nay, perhaps even the graver suspicion that had caused me to\r\nseal my lips while on the ship. Why I myself could only half believe!\r\nHow then could I hope to convince others?\r\n\r\nAnd as for the third question--I could not take men into the range of\r\nsuch a peril without first warning them of what they might encounter;\r\nand if I did warn them--\r\n\r\nIt was checkmate!  If it also was cowardice--well, I have atoned for\r\nit. But I do not hold it so; my conscience is clear.\r\n\r\nThat fortnight and the greater part of another passed before the ship\r\nI awaited steamed into port. By that time, between my straining\r\nanxiety to be after Throckmartin, the despairing thought that every\r\nmoment of delay might be vital to him and his, and my intensely eager\r\ndesire to know whether that shining, glorious horror on the moon path\r\ndid exist or had been hallucination, I was worn almost to the edge of\r\nmadness.\r\n\r\nAt last the condensers were in my hands.  It was more than a week\r\nlater, however, before I could secure passage back to Port Moresby and\r\nit was another week still before I started north on the Suwarna, a\r\nswift little sloop with a fifty-horsepower auxiliary, heading straight\r\nfor Ponape and the Nan-Matal.\r\n\r\nWe sighted the Brunhilda some five hundred miles south of the\r\nCarolines. The wind had fallen soon after Papua had dropped astern.\r\nThe Suwarna's ability to make her twelve knots an hour without it had\r\nmade me very fully forgive her for not being as fragrant as the Javan\r\nflower for which she was named. Da Costa, her captain, was a\r\ngarrulous Portuguese; his mate was a Canton man with all the marks of\r\nlong and able service on some pirate junk; his engineer was a\r\nhalf-breed China-Malay who had picked up his knowledge of power\r\nplants, Heaven alone knew where, and, I had reason to believe, had\r\ntransferred all his religious impulses to the American built deity of\r\nmechanism he so faithfully served. The crew was made up of six huge,\r\nchattering Tonga boys.\r\n\r\nThe Suwarna had cut through Finschafen Huon Gulf to the protection of\r\nthe Bismarcks. She had threaded the maze of the archipelago\r\ntranquilly, and we were then rolling over the thousand-mile stretch of\r\nopen ocean with New Hanover far behind us and our boat's bow pointed\r\nstraight toward Nukuor of the Monte Verdes. After we had rounded\r\nNukuor we should, barring accident, reach Ponape in not more than\r\nsixty hours.\r\n\r\nIt was late afternoon, and on the demure little breeze that marched\r\nbehind us came far-flung sighs of spice-trees and nutmeg flowers. The\r\nslow prodigious swells of the Pacific lifted us in gentle, giant hands\r\nand sent us as gently down the long, blue wave slopes to the next\r\nbroad, upward slope. There was a spell of peace over the ocean,\r\nstilling even the Portuguese captain who stood dreamily at the wheel,\r\nslowly swaying to the rhythmic lift and fall of the sloop.\r\n\r\nThere came a whining hail from the Tonga boy lookout draped lazily\r\nover the bow.\r\n\r\n\"Sail he b'long port side!\"\r\n\r\nDa Costa straightened and gazed while I raised my glass. The vessel\r\nwas a scant mile away, and must have been visible long before the\r\nsleepy watcher had seen her. She was a sloop about the size of the\r\nSuwarna, without power. All sails set, even to a spinnaker she\r\ncarried, she was making the best of the little breeze. I tried to read\r\nher name, but the vessel jibed sharply as though the hands of the man\r\nat the wheel had suddenly dropped the helm--and then with equal\r\nabruptness swung back to her course. The stern came in sight, and on\r\nit I read Brunhilda.\r\n\r\nI shifted my glasses to the man at wheel.  He was crouching down over\r\nthe spokes in a helpless, huddled sort of way, and even as I looked\r\nthe vessel veered again, abruptly as before. I saw the helmsman\r\nstraighten up and bring the wheel about with a vicious jerk.\r\n\r\nHe stood so for a moment, looking straight ahead, entirely oblivious\r\nof us, and then seemed again to sink down within himself. It came to\r\nme that his was the action of a man striving vainly against a\r\nweariness unutterable. I swept the deck with my glasses. There was no\r\nother sign of life. I turned to find the Portuguese staring intently\r\nand with puzzled air at the sloop, now separated from us by a scant\r\nhalf mile.\r\n\r\n\"Something veree wrong I think there, sair,\" he said in his curious\r\nEnglish. \"The man on deck I know. He is captain and owner of the\r\nBr-rwun'ild. His name Olaf Huldricksson, what you say--Norwegian. He\r\nis eithair veree sick or veree tired--but I do not undweerstand where\r\nis the crew and the starb'd boat is gone--\"\r\n\r\nHe shouted an order to the engineer and as he did so the faint breeze\r\nfailed and the sails of the Brunhilda flapped down inert. We were now\r\nnearly abreast and a scant hundred yards away. The engine of the\r\nSuwarna died and the Tonga boys leaped to one of the boats.\r\n\r\n\"You Olaf Huldricksson!\" shouted Da Costa.  \"What's a matter wit'\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\nThe man at the wheel turned toward us.  He was a giant; his shoulders\r\nenormous, thick chested, strength in every line of him, he towered\r\nlike a viking of old at the rudder bar of his shark ship.\r\n\r\nI raised the glass again; his face sprang into the lens and never have\r\nI seen a visage lined and marked as though by ages of unsleeping\r\nmisery as was that of Olaf Huldricksson!\r\n\r\nThe Tonga boys had the boat alongside and were waiting at the oars.\r\nThe little captain was dropping into it.\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" I cried.  I ran into my cabin, grasped my emergency medical\r\nkit and climbed down the rope ladder. The Tonga boys bent to the oars.\r\nWe reached the side and Da Costa and I each seized a lanyard dangling\r\nfrom the stays and swung ourselves on board. Da Costa approached\r\nHuldricksson softly.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, Olaf?\" he began--and then was silent, looking down\r\nat the wheel. The hands of Huldricksson were lashed fast to the spokes\r\nby thongs of thin, strong cord; they were swollen and black and the\r\nthongs had bitten into the sinewy wrists till they were hidden in the\r\noutraged flesh, cutting so deeply that blood fell, slow drop by drop,\r\nat his feet! We sprang toward him, reaching out hands to his fetters\r\nto loose them. Even as we touched them, Huldricksson aimed a vicious\r\nkick at me and then another at Da Costa which sent the Portuguese\r\ntumbling into the scuppers.\r\n\r\n\"Let be!\" croaked Huldricksson; his voice was thick and lifeless as\r\nthough forced from a dead throat; his lips were cracked and dry and\r\nhis parched tongue was black. \"Let be! Go! Let be!\"\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese had picked himself up, whimpering with rage and knife\r\nin hand, but as Huldricksson's voice reached him he stopped.\r\nAmazement crept into his eyes and as he thrust the blade back into\r\nhis belt they softened with pity.\r\n\r\n\"Something veree wrong wit' Olaf,\" he murmured to me. \"I think he\r\ncrazee!\" And then Olaf Huldricksson began to curse us. He did not\r\nspeak--he howled from that hideously dry mouth his imprecations. And\r\nall the time his red eyes roamed the seas and his hands, clenched and\r\nrigid on the wheel, dropped blood.\r\n\r\n\"I go below,\" said Da Costa nervously.  \"His wife, his daughter--\" he\r\ndarted down the companionway and was gone.\r\n\r\nHuldricksson, silent once more, had slumped down over the wheel.\r\n\r\nDa Costa's head appeared at the top of the companion steps.\r\n\r\n\"There is nobody, nobody,\" he paused--then--\"nobody--nowhere!\" His\r\nhands flew out in a gesture of hopeless incomprehension. \"I do not\r\nunderstan'.\"\r\n\r\nThen Olaf Huldricksson opened his dry lips and as he spoke a chill ran\r\nthrough me, checking my heart.\r\n\r\n\"The sparkling devil took them!\" croaked Olaf Huldricksson, \"the\r\nsparkling devil took them! Took my Helma and my little Freda! The\r\nsparkling devil came down from the moon and took them!\"\r\n\r\nHe swayed; tears dripped down his cheeks.  Da Costa moved toward him\r\nagain and again Huldricksson watched him, alertly, wickedly, from his\r\nbloodshot eyes.\r\n\r\nI took a hypodermic from my case and filled it with morphine.  I drew\r\nDa Costa to me.\r\n\r\n\"Get to the side of him,\" I whispered, \"talk to him.\" He moved over\r\ntoward the wheel.\r\n\r\n\"Where is your Helma and Freda, Olaf?\" he said.\r\n\r\nHuldricksson turned his head toward him.  \"The shining devil took\r\nthem,\" he croaked. \"The moon devil that spark--\"\r\n\r\nA yell broke from him.  I had thrust the needle into his arm just\r\nabove one swollen wrist and had quickly shot the drug through. He\r\nstruggled to release himself and then began to rock drunkenly. The\r\nmorphine, taking him in his weakness, worked quickly. Soon over his\r\nface a peace dropped. The pupils of the staring eyes contracted. Once,\r\ntwice, he swayed and then, his bleeding, prisoned hands held high and\r\nstill gripping the wheel, he crumpled to the deck.\r\n\r\nWith utmost difficulty we loosed the thongs, but at last it was done.\r\nWe rigged a little swing and the Tonga boys slung the great inert body\r\nover the side into the dory. Soon we had Huldricksson in my bunk. Da\r\nCosta sent half his crew over to the sloop in charge of the Cantonese.\r\nThey took in all sail, stripping Huldricksson's boat to the masts and\r\nthen with the Brunhilda nosing quietly along after us at the end of a\r\nlong hawser, one of the Tonga boys at her wheel, we resumed the way so\r\nenigmatically interrupted.\r\n\r\nI cleansed and bandaged the Norseman's lacerated wrists and sponged\r\nthe blackened, parched mouth with warm water and a mild antiseptic.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I was aware of Da Costa's presence and turned. His unease was\r\nmanifest and held, it seemed to me, a queer, furtive anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"What you think of Olaf, sair?\" he asked.  I shrugged my shoulders.\r\n\"You think he killed his woman and his babee?\" He went on. \"You think\r\nhe crazee and killed all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, Da Costa,\" I answered.  \"You saw the boat was gone.  Most\r\nprobably his crew mutinied and to torture him tied him up the way you\r\nsaw. They did the same thing with Hilton of the Coral Lady; you'll\r\nremember.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said.  \"No.  The crew did not.  Nobody there on board when\r\nOlaf was tied.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" I cried, startled.  \"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean,\" he said slowly, \"that Olaf tie himself!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" he went on at my incredulous gesture of dissent. \"Wait, I show\r\nyou.\" He had been standing with hands behind his back and now I saw\r\nthat he held in them the cut thongs that had bound Huldricksson. They\r\nwere blood-stained and each ended in a broad leather tip skilfully\r\nspliced into the cord. \"Look,\" he said, pointing to these leather\r\nends. I looked and saw in them deep indentations of teeth. I snatched\r\none of the thongs and opened the mouth of the unconscious man on the\r\nbunk. Carefully I placed the leather within it and gently forced the\r\njaws shut on it. It was true. Those marks were where Olaf\r\nHuldricksson's jaws had gripped.\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" Da Costa repeated, \"I show you.\" He took other cords and\r\nrested his hands on the supports of a chair back. Rapidly he twisted\r\none of the thongs around his left hand, drew a loose knot, shifted the\r\ncord up toward his elbow. This left wrist and hand still free and with\r\nthem he twisted the other cord around the right wrist; drew a similar\r\nknot. His hands were now in the exact position that Huldricksson's had\r\nbeen on the Brunhilda but with cords and knots hanging loose. Then Da\r\nCosta reached down his head, took a leather end in his teeth and with\r\na jerk drew the thong that noosed his left hand tight; similarly he\r\ndrew tight the second.\r\n\r\nHe strained at his fetters.  There before my eyes he had pinioned\r\nhimself so that without aid he could not release himself. And he was\r\nexactly as Huldricksson had been!\r\n\r\n\"You will have to cut me loose, sair,\" he said.  \"I cannot move them.\r\nIt is an old trick on these seas. Sometimes it is necessary that a man\r\nstand at the wheel many hours without help, and he does this so that\r\nif he sleep the wheel wake him, yes, sair.\"\r\n\r\nI looked from him to the man on the bed.\r\n\r\n\"But why, sair,\" said Da Costa slowly, \"did Olaf have to tie his\r\nhands?\"\r\n\r\nI looked at him, uneasily.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" I answered.  \"Do you?\"\r\n\r\nHe fidgeted, avoided my eyes, and then rapidly, almost surreptitiously\r\ncrossed himself.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he replied.  \"I know nothing.  Some things I have heard--but\r\nthey tell many tales on these seas.\"\r\n\r\nHe started for the door.  Before he reached it he turned. \"But this I\r\ndo know,\" he half whispered, \"I am damned glad there is no full moon\r\ntonight.\" And passed out, leaving me staring after him in amazement.\r\nWhat did the Portuguese know?\r\n\r\nI bent over the sleeper.  On his face was no trace of that unholy\r\nmingling of opposites the Dweller stamped upon its victims.\r\n\r\nAnd yet--what was it the Norseman had said?\r\n\r\n\"The sparkling devil took them!\"  Nay, he had been even more\r\nexplicit--\"The sparkling devil that came down from the moon!\"\r\n\r\nCould it be that the Dweller had swept upon the Brunhilda, drawing\r\ndown the moon path Olaf Huldricksson's wife and babe even as it had\r\ndrawn Throckmartin?\r\n\r\nAs I sat thinking the cabin grew suddenly dark and from above came a\r\nshouting and patter of feet. Down upon us swept one of the abrupt,\r\nviolent squalls that are met with in those latitudes. I lashed\r\nHuldricksson fast in the berth and ran up on deck.\r\n\r\nThe long, peaceful swells had changed into angry, choppy waves from\r\nthe tops of which the spindrift streamed in long stinging lashes.\r\n\r\nA half-hour passed; the squall died as quickly as it had arisen.  The\r\nsea quieted. Over in the west, from beneath the tattered, flying edge\r\nof the storm, dropped the red globe of the setting sun; dropped slowly\r\nuntil it touched the sea rim.\r\n\r\nI watched it--and rubbed my eyes and stared again.  For over its\r\nflaming portal something huge and black moved, like a gigantic\r\nbeckoning finger!\r\n\r\nDa Costa had seen it, too, and he turned the Suwarna straight toward\r\nthe descending orb and its strange shadow. As we approached we saw it\r\nwas a little mass of wreckage and that the beckoning finger was a wing\r\nof canvas, sticking up and swaying with the motion of the waves. On\r\nthe highest point of the wreckage sat a tall figure calmly smoking a\r\ncigarette.\r\n\r\nWe brought the Suwarna to, dropped a boat, and with myself as coxswain\r\npulled toward a wrecked hydroairplane. Its occupant took a long puff\r\nat his cigarette, waved a cheerful hand, shouted a greeting. And just\r\nas he did so a great wave raised itself up behind him, took the\r\nwreckage, tossed it high in a swelter of foam, and passed on. When we\r\nhad steadied our boat, where wreck and man had been was--nothing.\r\n\r\nThere came a tug at the side--, two muscular brown hands gripped it\r\nclose to my left, and a sleek, black, wet head showed its top between\r\nthem. Two bright, blue eyes that held deep within them a laughing\r\ndeviltry looked into mine, and a long, lithe body drew itself gently\r\nover the thwart and seated its dripping self at my feet.\r\n\r\n\"Much obliged,\" said this man from the sea.  \"I knew somebody was sure\r\nto come along when the O'Keefe banshee didn't show up.\"\r\n\r\n\"The what?\" I asked in amazement.\r\n\r\n\"The O'Keefe banshee--I'm Larry O'Keefe.  It's a far way from Ireland,\r\nbut not too far for the O'Keefe banshee to travel if the O'Keefe was\r\ngoing to click in.\"\r\n\r\nI looked again at my astonishing rescue.  He seemed perfectly serious.\r\n\r\n\"Have you a cigarette?  Mine went out,\" he said with a grin, as he\r\nreached a moist hand out for the little cylinder, took it, lighted it.\r\n\r\nI saw a lean, intelligent face whose fighting jaw was softened by the\r\nwistfulness of the clean-cut lips and the honesty that lay side by\r\nside with the deviltry in the laughing blue eyes; nose of a\r\nthoroughbred with the suspicion of a tilt; long, well-knit, slender\r\nfigure that I knew must have all the strength of fine steel; the\r\nuniform of a lieutenant in the Royal Flying Corps of Britain's navy.\r\n\r\nHe laughed, stretched out a firm hand, and gripped mine.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you really ever so much, old man,\" he said.\r\n\r\nI liked Larry O'Keefe from the beginning--but I did not dream as the\r\nTonga boys pulled us back to the Suwarna bow that liking was to be\r\nforged into man's strong love for man by fires which souls such as his\r\nand mine--and yours who read this--could never dream.\r\n\r\nLarry!  Larry O'Keefe, where are you now with your leprechauns and\r\nbanshee, your heart of a child, your laughing blue eyes, and your\r\nfearless soul? Shall I ever see you again, Larry O'Keefe, dear to me\r\nas some best beloved younger brother? Larry!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nLarry O'Keefe\r\n\r\nPressing back the questions I longed to ask, I introduced myself.\r\nOddly enough, I found that he knew me, or rather my work. He had\r\nbought, it appeared, my volume upon the peculiar vegetation whose\r\nhabitat is disintegrating lava rock and volcanic ash, that I had\r\nentitled, somewhat loosely, I could now perceive, Flora of the\r\nCraters. For he explained naively that he had picked it up, thinking\r\nit an entirely different sort of a book, a novel in fact--something\r\nlike Meredith's Diana of the Crossways, which he liked greatly.\r\n\r\nHe had hardly finished this explanation when we touched the side of\r\nthe Suwarna, and I was forced to curb my curiosity until we reached\r\nthe deck.\r\n\r\n\"That thing you saw me sitting on,\" he said, after he had thanked the\r\nbowing little skipper for his rescue, \"was all that was left of one of\r\nhis Majesty's best little hydroairplanes after that cyclone threw it\r\noff as excess baggage. And by the way, about where are we?\"\r\n\r\nDa Costa gave him our approximate position from the noon reckoning.\r\n\r\nO'Keefe whistled.  \"A good three hundred miles from where I left the\r\nH.M.S. Dolphin about four hours ago,\" he said. \"That squall I rode in\r\non was some whizzer!\r\n\r\n\"The Dolphin,\" he went on, calmly divesting himself of his soaked\r\nuniform, \"was on her way to Melbourne. I'd been yearning for a joy\r\nride and went up for an alleged scouting trip. Then that blow shot out\r\nof nowhere, picked me up, and insisted that I go with it.\r\n\r\n\"About an hour ago I thought I saw a chance to zoom up and out of it,\r\nI turned, and _blick_ went my right wing, and down I dropped.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know how we can notify your ship, Lieutenant O'Keefe,\" I\r\nsaid. \"We have no wireless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doctair Goodwin,\" said Da Costa, \"we could change our course,\r\nsair--perhaps--\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks--but not a bit of it,\" broke in O'Keefe.  \"Lord alone knows\r\nwhere the Dolphin is now. Fancy she'll be nosing around looking for\r\nme. Anyway, she's just as apt to run into you as you into her. Maybe\r\nwe'll strike something with a wireless, and I'll trouble you to put me\r\naboard.\" He hesitated. \"Where are you bound, by the way?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"For Ponape,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"No wireless there,\" mused O'Keefe.  \"Beastly hole. Stopped a week ago\r\nfor fruit. Natives seemed scared to death at us--or something. What\r\nare you going there for?\"\r\n\r\nDa Costa darted a furtive glance at me.  It troubled me.\r\n\r\nO'Keefe noted my hesitation.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I beg your pardon,\" he said.  \"Maybe I oughn't to have asked\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's no secret, Lieutenant,\" I replied.  \"I'm about to undertake some\r\nexploration work--a little digging among the ruins on the Nan-Matal.\"\r\n\r\nI looked at the Portuguese sharply as I named the place. A pallor\r\ncrept beneath his skin and again he made swiftly the sign of the\r\ncross, glancing as he did so fearfully to the north. I made up my mind\r\nthen to question him when opportunity came. He turned from his quick\r\nscrutiny of the sea and addressed O'Keefe.\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing on board to fit you, Lieutenant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, just give me a sheet to throw around me, Captain,\" said O'Keefe\r\nand followed him. Darkness had fallen, and as the two disappeared into\r\nDa Costa's cabin I softly opened the door of my own and listened.\r\nHuldricksson was breathing deeply and regularly.\r\n\r\nI drew my electric-flash, and shielding its rays from my face, looked\r\nat him. His sleep was changing from the heavy stupor of the drug into\r\none that was at least on the borderland of the normal. The tongue had\r\nlost its arid blackness and the mouth secretions had resumed action.\r\nSatisfied as to his condition I returned to deck.\r\n\r\nO'Keefe was there, looking like a spectre in the cotton sheet he had\r\nwrapped about him. A deck table had been cleated down and one of the\r\nTonga boys was setting it for our dinner. Soon the very creditable\r\nlarder of the Suwarna dressed the board, and O'Keefe, Da Costa, and I\r\nattacked it. The night had grown close and oppressive. Behind us the\r\nforward light of the Brunhilda glided and the binnacle lamp threw up a\r\nfaint glow in which her black helmsman's face stood out mistily.\r\nO'Keefe had looked curiously a number of times at our tow, but had\r\nasked no questions.\r\n\r\n\"You're not the only passenger we picked up today,\" I told him.  \"We\r\nfound the captain of that sloop, lashed to his wheel, nearly dead with\r\nexhaustion, and his boat deserted by everyone except himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was the matter?\" asked O'Keefe in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"We don't know,\" I answered.  \"He fought us, and I had to drug him\r\nbefore we could get him loose from his lashings. He's sleeping down in\r\nmy berth now. His wife and little girl ought to have been on board,\r\nthe captain here says, but--they weren't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wife and child gone!\" exclaimed O'Keefe.\r\n\r\n\"From the condition of his mouth he must have been alone at the wheel\r\nand without water at least two days and nights before we found him,\" I\r\nreplied. \"And as for looking for anyone on these waters after such a\r\ntime--it's hopeless.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true,\" said O'Keefe.  \"But his wife and baby!  Poor, poor\r\ndevil!\"\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a time, and then, at my solicitation, began to tell\r\nus more of himself. He had been little more than twenty when he had\r\nwon his wings and entered the war. He had been seriously wounded at\r\nYpres during the third year of the struggle, and when he recovered the\r\nwar was over. Shortly after that his mother had died. Lonely and\r\nrestless, he had re-entered the Air Service, and had remained in it\r\never since.\r\n\r\n\"And though the war's long over, I get homesick for the lark's land\r\nwith the German planes playing tunes on their machine guns and their\r\nArchies tickling the soles of my feet,\" he sighed. \"If you're in love,\r\nlove to the limit; and if you hate, why hate like the devil and if\r\nit's a fight you're in, get where it's hottest and fight like hell--if\r\nyou don't life's not worth the living,\" sighed he.\r\n\r\nI watched him as he talked, feeling my liking for him steadily\r\nincreasing. If I could but have a man like this beside me on the path\r\nof unknown peril upon which I had set my feet I thought, wistfully. We\r\nsat and smoked a bit, sipping the strong coffee the Portuguese made so\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nDa Costa at last relieved the Cantonese at the wheel. O'Keefe and I\r\ndrew chairs up to the rail. The brighter stars shone out dimly through\r\na hazy sky; gleams of phosphorescence tipped the crests of the waves\r\nand sparkled with an almost angry brilliance as the bow of the Suwarna\r\ntossed them aside. O'Keefe pulled contentedly at a cigarette. The\r\nglowing spark lighted the keen, boyish face and the blue eyes, now\r\nblack and brooding under the spell of the tropic night.\r\n\r\n\"Are you American or Irish, O'Keefe?\" I asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" he laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" I answered, \"from your name and your service I would\r\nsuppose you Irish--but your command of pure Americanese makes me\r\ndoubtful.\"\r\n\r\nHe grinned amiably.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you how that is,\" he said.  \"My mother was an American--a\r\nGrace, of Virginia. My father was the O'Keefe, of Coleraine. And these\r\ntwo loved each other so well that the heart they gave me is half Irish\r\nand half American. My father died when I was sixteen. I used to go to\r\nthe States with my mother every other year for a month or two. But\r\nafter my father died we used to go to Ireland every other year. And\r\nthere you are--I'm as much American as I am Irish.\r\n\r\n\"When I'm in love, or excited, or dreaming, or mad I have the brogue.\r\nBut for the everyday purpose of life I like the United States talk,\r\nand I know Broadway as well as I do Binevenagh Lane, and the Sound as\r\nwell as St. Patrick's Channel; educated a bit at Eton, a bit at\r\nHarvard; always too much money to have to make any; in love lots of\r\ntimes, and never a heartache after that wasn't a pleasant one, and\r\nnever a real purpose in life until I took the king's shilling and\r\nearned my wings; something over thirty--and that's me--Larry\r\nO'Keefe.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it was the Irish O'Keefe who sat out there waiting for the\r\nbanshee,\" I laughed.\r\n\r\n\"It was that,\" he said somberly, and I heard the brogue creep over his\r\nvoice like velvet and his eyes grew brooding again. \"There's never an\r\nO'Keefe for these thousand years that has passed without his warning.\r\nAn' twice have I heard the banshee calling--once it was when my\r\nyounger brother died an' once when my father lay waiting to be carried\r\nout on the ebb tide.\"\r\n\r\nHe mused a moment, then went on: \"An' once I saw an Annir Choille, a\r\ngirl of the green people, flit like a shade of green fire through\r\nCarntogher woods, an' once at Dunchraig I slept where the ashes of the\r\nDun of Cormac MacConcobar are mixed with those of Cormac an' Eilidh\r\nthe Fair, all burned in the nine flames that sprang from the harping\r\nof Cravetheen, an' I heard the echo of his dead harpings--\"\r\n\r\nHe paused again and then, softly, with that curiously sweet, high\r\nvoice that only the Irish seem to have, he sang:\r\n\r\n    Woman of the white breasts, Eilidh;\r\n    Woman of the gold-brown hair, and lips of the red, red rowan,\r\n    Where is the swan that is whiter, with breast more soft,\r\n    Or the wave on the sea that moves as thou movest, Eilidh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nOlaf's Story\r\n\r\nThere was a little silence.  I looked upon him with wonder. Clearly he\r\nwas in deepest earnest. I know the psychology of the Gael is a curious\r\none and that deep in all their hearts their ancient traditions and\r\nbeliefs have strong and living roots. And I was both amused and\r\ntouched.\r\n\r\nHere was this soldier, who had faced war and its ugly realities\r\nopen-eyed and fearless, picking, indeed, the most dangerous branch of\r\nservice for his own, a modern if ever there was one, appreciative of\r\nmost unmystical Broadway, and yet soberly and earnestly attesting to\r\nhis belief in banshee, in shadowy people of the woods, and phantom\r\nharpers! I wondered what he would think if he could see the Dweller\r\nand then, with a pang, that perhaps his superstitions might make him\r\nan easy prey.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head half impatiently and ran a hand over his eyes;\r\nturned to me and grinned:\r\n\r\n\"Don't think I'm cracked, Professor,\" he said.  \"I'm not. But it takes\r\nme that way now and then. It's the Irish in me. And, believe it or\r\nnot, I'm telling you the truth.\"\r\n\r\nI looked eastward where the moon, now nearly a week past the full, was\r\nmounting.\r\n\r\n\"You can't make me see what you've seen, Lieutenant,\" I laughed.  \"But\r\nyou can make me hear. I've always wondered what kind of a noise a\r\ndisembodied spirit could make without any vocal cords or breath or any\r\nother earthly sound-producing mechanism. How does the banshee sound?\"\r\n\r\nO'Keefe looked at me seriously.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" he said.  \"I'll show you.\" From deep down in his throat\r\ncame first a low, weird sobbing that mounted steadily into a keening\r\nwhose mournfulness made my skin creep. And then his hand shot out and\r\ngripped my shoulder, and I stiffened like stone in my chair--for from\r\nbehind us, like an echo, and then taking up the cry, swelled a wail\r\nthat seemed to hold within it a sublimation of the sorrows of\r\ncenturies! It gathered itself into one heartbroken, sobbing note and\r\ndied away! O'Keefe's grip loosened, and he rose swiftly to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"It's all right, Professor,\" he said.  \"It's for me.  It found me--all\r\nthis way from Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nAgain the silence was rent by the cry.  But now I had located it.  It\r\ncame from my room, and it could mean only one thing--Huldricksson had\r\nwakened.\r\n\r\n\"Forget your banshee!\" I gasped, and made a jump for the cabin.\r\n\r\nOut of the corner of my eye I noted a look of half-sheepish relief\r\nflit over O'Keefe's face, and then he was beside me. Da Costa shouted\r\nan order from the wheel, the Cantonese ran up and took it from his\r\nhands and the little Portuguese pattered down toward us. My hand on\r\nthe door, ready to throw it open, I stopped. What if the Dweller were\r\nwithin--what if we had been wrong and it was not dependent for its\r\npower upon that full flood of moon ray which Throckmartin had thought\r\nessential to draw it from the blue pool!\r\n\r\nFrom within, the sobbing wail began once more to rise. O'Keefe pushed\r\nme aside, threw open the door and crouched low within it. I saw an\r\nautomatic flash dully in his hand; saw it cover the cabin from side to\r\nside, following the swift sweep of his eyes around it. Then he\r\nstraightened and his face, turned toward the berth, was filled with\r\nwondering pity.\r\n\r\nThrough the window streamed a shaft of the moonlight. It fell upon\r\nHuldricksson's staring eyes; in them great tears slowly gathered and\r\nrolled down his cheeks; from his opened mouth came the woe-laden\r\nwailing. I ran to the port and drew the curtains. Da Costa snapped the\r\nlights.\r\n\r\nThe Norseman's dolorous crying stopped as abruptly as though cut.  His\r\ngaze rolled toward us. And at one bound he broke through the leashes I\r\nhad buckled round him and faced us, his eyes glaring, his yellow hair\r\nalmost erect with the force of the rage visibly surging through him.\r\nDa Costa shrunk behind me. O'Keefe, coolly watchful, took a quick step\r\nthat brought him in front of me.\r\n\r\n\"Where do you take me?\" said Huldricksson, and his voice was like the\r\ngrowl of a beast. \"Where is my boat?\"\r\n\r\nI touched O'Keefe gently and stood before the giant.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Olaf Huldricksson,\" I said.  \"We take you to where the\r\nsparkling devil took your Helma and your Freda. We follow the\r\nsparkling devil that came down from the moon. Do you hear me?\" I spoke\r\nslowly, distinctly, striving to pierce the mists that I knew swirled\r\naround the strained brain. And the words did pierce.\r\n\r\nHe thrust out a shaking hand.\r\n\r\n\"You say you follow?\" he asked falteringly.  \"You know where to\r\nfollow? Where it took my Helma and my little Freda?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just that, Olaf Huldricksson,\" I answered.  \"Just that!  I pledge you\r\nmy life that I know.\"\r\n\r\nDa Costa stepped forward.  \"He speaks true, Olaf.  You go faster on\r\nthe Suwarna than on the Br-rw-un'ilda, Olaf, yes.\"\r\n\r\nThe giant Norseman, still gripping my hand, looked at him.  \"I know\r\nyou, Da Costa,\" he muttered. \"You are all right. Ja! You are a fair\r\nman. Where is the Brunhilda?\"\r\n\r\n\"She follow be'ind on a big rope, Olaf,\" soothed the Portuguese.\r\n\"Soon you see her. But now lie down an' tell us, if you can, why you\r\ntie yourself to your wheel an' what it is that happen, Olaf.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you'll tell us how the sparkling devil came it will help us all\r\nwhen we get to where it is, Huldricksson,\" I said.\r\n\r\nOn O'Keefe's face there was an expression of well-nigh ludicrous doubt\r\nand amazement. He glanced from one to the other. The giant shifted his\r\nown tense look from me to the Irishman. A gleam of approval lighted in\r\nhis eyes. He loosed me, and gripped O'Keefe's arm. \"Staerk!\" he said.\r\n\"Ja--strong, and with a strong heart. A man--ja! He comes too--we\r\nshall need him--ja!\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell,\" he muttered, and seated himself on the side of the bunk.\r\n\"It was four nights ago. My Freda\"--his voice shook--\"Mine Yndling!\r\nShe loved the moonlight. I was at the wheel and my Freda and my Helma\r\nthey were behind me. The moon was behind us and the Brunhilda was like\r\na swanboat sailing down with the moonlight sending her, ja.\r\n\r\n\"I heard my Freda say: 'I see a nisse coming down the track of the\r\nmoon.' And I hear her mother laugh, low, like a mother does when her\r\nYndling dreams. I was happy--that night--with my Helma and my Freda,\r\nand the Brunhilda sailing like a swan-boat, ja. I heard the child say,\r\n'The nisse comes fast!' And then I heard a scream from my Helma, a\r\ngreat scream--like a mare when her foal is torn from her. I spun\r\naround fast, ja! I dropped the wheel and spun fast! I saw--\" He\r\ncovered his eyes with his hands.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese had crept close to me, and I heard him panting like a\r\nfrightened dog.\r\n\r\n\"I saw a white fire spring over the rail,\" whispered Olaf\r\nHuldricksson. \"It whirled round and round, and it shone like--like\r\nstars in a whirlwind mist. There was a noise in my ears. It sounded\r\nlike bells--little bells, ja! Like the music you make when you run\r\nyour finger round goblets. It made me sick and dizzy--the hell noise.\r\n\r\n\"My Helma was--indeholde--what you say--in the middle of the white\r\nfire. She turned her face to me and she turned it on the child, and my\r\nHelma's face burned into my heart. Because it was full of fear, and it\r\nwas full of happiness--of glaede. I tell you that the fear in my\r\nHelma's face made me ice here\"--he beat his breast with clenched\r\nhand--\"but the happiness in it burned on me like fire. And I could\r\nnot move--I could not move.\r\n\r\n\"I said in here\"--he touched his head--\"I said, 'It is Loki come out\r\nof Helvede. But he cannot take my Helma, for Christ lives and Loki has\r\nno power to hurt my Helma or my Freda! Christ lives! Christ lives!' I\r\nsaid. But the sparkling devil did not let my Helma go. It drew her to\r\nthe rail; half over it. I saw her eyes upon the child and a little she\r\nbroke away and reached to it. And my Freda jumped into her arms. And\r\nthe fire wrapped them both and they were gone! A little I saw them\r\nwhirling on the moon track behind the Brunhilda--and they were gone!\r\n\r\n\"The sparkling devil took them!  Loki was loosed, and he had power.  I\r\nturned the Brunhilda, and I followed where my Helma and mine Yndling\r\nhad gone. My boys crept up and asked me to turn again. But I would\r\nnot. They dropped a boat and left me. I steered straight on the path.\r\nI lashed my hands to the wheel that sleep might not loose them. I\r\nsteered on and on and on--\r\n\r\n\"Where was the God I prayed when my wife and child were taken?\" cried\r\nOlaf Huldricksson--and it was as though I heard Throckmartin asking\r\nthat same bitter question. \"I have left Him as He left me, ja! I pray\r\nnow to Thor and to Odin, who can fetter Loki.\" He sank back, covering\r\nagain his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Olaf,\" I said, \"what you have called the sparkling devil has taken\r\nones dear to me. I, too, was following it when we found you. You shall\r\ngo with me to its home, and there we will try to take from it your\r\nwife and your child and my friends as well. But now that you may be\r\nstrong for what is before us, you must sleep again.\"\r\n\r\nOlaf Huldricksson looked upon me and in his eyes was that something\r\nwhich souls must see in the eyes of Him the old Egyptians called the\r\nSearcher of Hearts in the Judgment Hall of Osiris.\r\n\r\n\"You speak truth!\" he said at last slowly.  \"I will do what you say!\"\r\n\r\nHe stretched out an arm at my bidding.  I gave him a second injection.\r\nHe lay back and soon he was sleeping. I turned toward Da Costa. His\r\nface was livid and sweating, and he was trembling pitiably. O'Keefe\r\nstirred.\r\n\r\n\"You did that mighty well, Dr. Goodwin,\" he said.  \"So well that I\r\nalmost believed you myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you think of his story, Mr. O'Keefe?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nHis answer was almost painfully brief and colloquial.\r\n\r\n\"Nuts!\" he said. I was a little shocked, I admit. \"I think he's crazy,\r\nDr. Goodwin,\" he corrected himself, quickly. \"What else could I\r\nthink?\"\r\n\r\nI turned to the little Portuguese without answering.\r\n\r\n\"There's no need for any anxiety tonight, Captain,\" I said. \"Take my\r\nword for it. You need some rest yourself. Shall I give you a sleeping\r\ndraft?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do wish you would, Dr. Goodwin, sair,\" he answered gratefully.\r\n\"Tomorrow, when I feel bettair--I would have a talk with you.\"\r\n\r\nI nodded.  He did know something then!  I mixed him an opiate of\r\nconsiderable strength. He took it and went to his own cabin.\r\n\r\nI locked the door behind him and then, sitting beside the sleeping\r\nNorseman, I told O'Keefe my story from end to end. He asked few\r\nquestions as I spoke. But after I had finished he cross-examined me\r\nrather minutely upon my recollections of the radiant phases upon each\r\nappearance, checking these with Throckmartin's observations of the\r\nsame phenomena in the Chamber of the Moon Pool.\r\n\r\n\"And now what do you think of it all?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nHe sat silent for a while, looking at Huldricksson.\r\n\r\n\"Not what you seem to think, Dr. Goodwin,\" he answered at last,\r\ngravely. \"Let me sleep over it. One thing of course is certain--you\r\nand your friend Throckmartin and this man here saw--something. But--\"\r\nhe was silent again and then continued with a kindness that I found\r\nvaguely irritating--\"but I've noticed that when a scientist gets\r\nsuperstitious it--er--takes very hard!\r\n\r\n\"Here's a few things I can tell you now though,\" he went on while I\r\nstruggled to speak--\"I pray in my heart that we'll meet neither the\r\nDolphin nor anything with wireless on board going up. Because, Dr.\r\nGoodwin, I'd dearly love to take a crack at your Dweller.\r\n\r\n\"And another thing,\" said O'Keefe.  \"After this--cut out the\r\ntrimmings, Doc, and call me plain Larry, for whether I think you're\r\ncrazy or whether I don't, you're there with the nerve, Professor, and\r\nI'm for _you_.\r\n\r\n\"Good night!\" said Larry and took himself out to the deck hammock he\r\nhad insisted upon having slung for him, refusing the captain's\r\nimportunities to use his own cabin.\r\n\r\nAnd it was with extremely mixed emotions as to his compliment that I\r\nwatched him go. Superstitious. I, whose pride was my scientific\r\ndevotion to fact and fact alone! Superstitious--and this from a man\r\nwho believed in banshees and ghostly harpers and Irish wood nymphs and\r\nno doubt in leprechauns and all their tribe!\r\n\r\nHalf laughing, half irritated, and wholly happy in even the part\r\npromise of Larry O'Keefe's comradeship on my venture, I arranged a\r\ncouple of pillows, stretched myself out on two chairs and took up my\r\nvigil beside Olaf Huldricksson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nA Lost Page of Earth\r\n\r\nWhen I awakened the sun was streaming through the cabin porthole.\r\nOutside a fresh voice lilted. I lay on my two chairs and listened. The\r\nsong was one with the wholesome sunshine and the breeze blowing\r\nstiffly and whipping the curtains. It was Larry O'Keefe at his matins:\r\n\r\n  The little red lark is shaking his wings,\r\n  Straight from the breast of his love he springs\r\n\r\nLarry's voice soared.\r\n\r\n  His wings and his feathers are sunrise red,\r\n  He hails the sun and his golden head,\r\n  Good morning, Doc, you are long abed.\r\n\r\nThis last was a most irreverent interpolation, I well knew. I opened\r\nmy door. O'Keefe stood outside laughing. The Suwarna, her engines\r\nsilent, was making fine headway under all sail, the Brunhilda skipping\r\nin her wake cheerfully with half her canvas up.\r\n\r\nThe sea was crisping and dimpling under the wind.  Blue and white was\r\nthe world as far as the eye could reach. Schools of little silvery\r\ngreen flying fish broke through the water rushing on each side of us;\r\nflashed for an instant and were gone. Behind us gulls hovered and\r\ndipped. The shadow of mystery had retreated far over the rim of this\r\nwide awake and beautiful world and if, subconsciously, I knew that\r\nsomewhere it was brooding and waiting, for a little while at least I\r\nwas consciously free of its oppression.\r\n\r\n\"How's the patient?\" asked O'Keefe.\r\n\r\nHe was answered by Huldricksson himself, who must have risen just as I\r\nleft the cabin. The Norseman had slipped on a pair of pajamas and,\r\ngiant torso naked under the sun, he strode out upon us. We all of us\r\nlooked at him a trifle anxiously. But Olaf's madness had left him. In\r\nhis eyes was much sorrow, but the berserk rage was gone.\r\n\r\nHe spoke straight to me: \"You said last night we follow?\"\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n\"It is where?\" he asked again.\r\n\r\n\"We go first to Ponape and from there to Metalanim Harbour--to the\r\nNan-Matal. You know the place?\"\r\n\r\nHuldricksson bowed--a white gleam as of ice showing in his blue eyes.\r\n\r\n\"It is there?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"It is there that we must first search,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" said Olaf Huldricksson.  \"It is good!\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at Da Costa inquiringly and the little Portuguese, following\r\nhis thought, answered his unspoken question.\r\n\r\n\"We should be at Ponape tomorrow morning early, Olaf.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" repeated the Norseman.  He looked away, his eyes tear-filled.\r\n\r\nA restraint fell upon us; the embarrassment all men experience when\r\nthey feel a great sympathy and a great pity, to neither of which they\r\nquite know how to give expression. By silent consent we discussed at\r\nbreakfast only the most casual topics.\r\n\r\nWhen the meal was over Huldricksson expressed a desire to go aboard\r\nthe Brunhilda.\r\n\r\nThe Suwarna hove to and Da Costa and he dropped into the small boat.\r\nWhen they reached the Brunhilda's deck I saw Olaf take the wheel and\r\nthe two fall into earnest talk. I beckoned to O'Keefe and we stretched\r\nourselves out on the bow hatch under cover of the foresail. He lighted\r\na cigarette, took a couple of leisurely puffs, and looked at me\r\nexpectantly.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said O'Keefe, \"suppose you tell me what you think--and then\r\nI'll proceed to point out your scientific errors.\" His eyes twinkled\r\nmischievously.\r\n\r\n\"Larry,\" I replied, somewhat severely, \"you may not know that I have a\r\nscientific reputation which, putting aside all modesty, I may say is\r\nan enviable one. You used a word last night to which I must interpose\r\nserious objection. You more than hinted that I hid--superstitions. Let\r\nme inform you, Larry O'Keefe, that I am solely a seeker, observer,\r\nanalyst, and synthesist of facts. I am not\"--and I tried to make my\r\ntone as pointed as my words--\"I am not a believer in phantoms or\r\nspooks, leprechauns, banshees, or ghostly harpers.\"\r\n\r\nO'Keefe leaned back and shouted with laughter.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me, Goodwin,\" he gasped.  \"But if you could have seen\r\nyourself solemnly disclaiming the banshee\"--another twinkle showed in\r\nhis eyes--\"and then with all this sunshine and this wide-open\r\nworld\"--he shrugged his shoulders--\"it's hard to visualize anything\r\nsuch as you and Huldricksson have described.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know how hard it is, Larry,\" I answered.  \"And don't think I have\r\nany idea that the phenomenon is supernatural in the sense\r\nspiritualists and table turners have given that word. I do think it is\r\nsupernormal; energized by a force unknown to modern science--but that\r\ndoesn't mean I think it outside the radius of science.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me your theory, Goodwin,\" he said.  I hesitated--for not yet\r\nhad I been able to put into form to satisfy myself any explanation of\r\nthe Dweller.\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" I hazarded finally, \"it is possible that some members of\r\nthat race peopling the ancient continent which we know existed here in\r\nthe Pacific, have survived. We know that many of these islands are\r\nhoneycombed with caverns and vast subterranean spaces, literally\r\nunderground lands running in some cases far out beneath the ocean\r\nfloor. It is possible that for some reason survivors of this race\r\nsought refuge in the abysmal spaces, one of whose entrances is on the\r\nislet where Throckmartin's party met its end.\r\n\r\n\"As for their persistence in these caverns--we know they possessed a\r\nhigh science. They may have gone far in the mastery of certain\r\nuniversal forms of energy--especially that we call light. They may\r\nhave developed a civilization and a science far more advanced than\r\nours. What I call the Dweller may be one of the results of this\r\nscience. Larry--it may well be that this lost race is planning to\r\nemerge again upon earth's surface!\"\r\n\r\n\"And is sending out your Dweller as a messenger, a scientific dove\r\nfrom their Ark?\" I chose to overlook the banter in his question.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever hear of the Chamats?\" I asked him.  He shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"In Papua,\" I explained, \"there is a wide-spread and immeasurably old\r\ntradition that 'imprisoned under the hills' is a race of giants who\r\nonce ruled this region 'when it stretched from sun to sun before the\r\nmoon god drew the waters over it'--I quote from the legend. Not only\r\nin Papua but throughout Malaysia you find this story. And, so the\r\ntradition runs, these people--the Chamats--will one day break through\r\nthe hills and rule the world; 'make over the world' is the literal\r\ntranslation of the constant phrase in the tale. It was Herbert Spencer\r\nwho pointed out that there is a basis of fact in every myth and legend\r\nof man. It is possible that these survivors I am discussing form\r\nSpencer's fact basis for the Malaysian legend.[1]\r\n\r\n\"This much is sure--the moon door, which is clearly operated by the\r\naction of moon rays upon some unknown element or combination and the\r\ncrystals through which the moon rays pour down upon the pool their\r\nprismatic columns, are humanly made mechanisms. So long as they are\r\nhumanly made, and so long as it _is_ this flood of moonlight from which\r\nthe Dweller draws its power of materialization, the Dweller itself, if\r\nnot the product of the human mind, is at least dependent upon the\r\nproduct of the human mind for its appearance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute, Goodwin,\" interrupted O'Keefe.  \"Do you mean to say\r\nyou think that this thing is made of--well--of moonshine?\"\r\n\r\n\"Moonlight,\" I replied, \"is, of course, reflected sunlight. But the\r\nrays which pass back to earth after their impact on the moon's surface\r\nare profoundly changed. The spectroscope shows that they lose\r\npractically all the slower vibrations we call red and infra-red, while\r\nthe extremely rapid vibrations we call the violet and ultra-violet are\r\naccelerated and altered. Many scientists hold that there is an unknown\r\nelement in the moon--perhaps that which makes the gigantic luminous\r\ntrails that radiate in all directions from the lunar crater\r\nTycho--whose energies are absorbed by and carried on the moon rays.\r\n\r\n\"At any rate, whether by the loss of the vibrations of the red or by\r\nthe addition of this mysterious force, the light of the moon becomes\r\nsomething entirely different from mere modified sunlight--just as the\r\naddition or subtraction of one other chemical in a compound of several\r\nmakes the product a substance with entirely different energies and\r\npotentialities.\r\n\r\n\"Now these rays, Larry, are given perhaps still another mysterious\r\nactivity by the globes through which Throckmartin said they passed in\r\nthe Chamber of the Moon Pool. The result is the necessary factor in\r\nthe formation of the Dweller. There would be nothing scientifically\r\nimprobable in such a process. Kubalski, the great Russian physicist,\r\nproduced crystalline forms exhibiting every faculty that we call vital\r\nby subjecting certain combinations of chemicals to the action of\r\nhighly concentrated rays of various colours. Something in light and\r\nnothing else produced their pseudo-vitality. We do not begin to know\r\nhow to harness the potentialities of that magnetic vibration of the\r\nether we call light.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Doc,\" said Larry earnestly, \"I'll take everything you say\r\nabout this lost continent, the people who used to live on it, and\r\ntheir caverns, for granted. But by the sword of Brian Boru, you'll\r\nnever get me to fall for the idea that a bunch of moonshine can handle\r\na big woman such as you say Throckmartin's Thora was, nor a two-fisted\r\nman such as you say Throckmartin was, nor Huldricksson's wife--and\r\nI'll bet she was one of those strapping big northern women too--you'll\r\nnever get me to believe that any bunch of concentrated moonshine could\r\nhandle them and take them waltzing off along a moonbeam back to\r\nwherever it goes. No, Doc, not on your life, even Tennessee moonshine\r\ncouldn't do that--nix!\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, O'Keefe,\" I answered, now very much irritated indeed.\r\n\"What's your theory?\" And I could not resist adding: \"Fairies?\"\r\n\r\n\"Professor,\" he grinned, \"if that Thing's a fairy it's Irish and when\r\nit sees me it'll be so glad there'll be nothing to it. 'I was lost,\r\nstrayed, or stolen, Larry avick,' it'll say, 'an' I was so homesick\r\nfor the old sod I was desp'rit,' it'll say, an' 'take me back quick\r\nbefore I do any more har-rm!' it'll tell me--an' that's the truth.\r\n\r\n\"Now don't get me wrong.  I believe you all saw something all right.\r\nBut what I think you saw was some kind of gas. All this region is\r\nvolcanic and islands and things are constantly poking up from the sea.\r\nIt's probably gas; a volcanic emanation; something new to us and that\r\ndrives you crazy--lots of kinds of gas do that. It hit the\r\nThrockmartin party on that island and they probably were all more or\r\nless delirious all the time; thought they saw things; talked it over\r\nand--collective hallucination--just like the Angels of Mons and other\r\nmiracles of the war. Somebody sees something that looks like something\r\nelse. He points it out to the man next him. 'Do you see it?' asks he.\r\n'Sure I see it,' says the other. And there you are--collective\r\nhallucination.\r\n\r\n\"When your friends got it bad they most likely jumped overboard one by\r\none. Huldricksson sails into a place where it is and it hits his wife.\r\nShe grabs the child and jumps over. Maybe the moon rays make it\r\nluminous! I've seen gas on the front under the moon that looked like a\r\nthousand whirling dervish devils. Yes, and you could see the devil's\r\nfaces in it. And if it got into your lungs nothing could ever make you\r\nthink you hadn't seen real devils.\"\r\n\r\nFor a time I was silent.\r\n\r\n\"Larry,\" I said at last, \"whether you are right or I am right, I must\r\ngo to the Nan-Matal. Will you go with me, Larry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Goodwin,\" he replied, \"I surely will.  I'm as interested as you are.\r\nIf we don't run across the Dolphin I'll stick. I'll leave word at\r\nPonape, to tell them where I am should they come along. If they report\r\nme dead for a while there's nobody to care. So that's all right. Only\r\nold man, be reasonable. You've thought over this so long, you're going\r\nbug, honestly you are.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again, the gladness that I might have Larry O'Keefe with me, was\r\nso great that I forgot to be angry.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] William Beebe, the famous American naturalist and ornithologist,\r\nrecently fighting in France with America's air force, called attention\r\nto this remarkable belief in an article printed not long ago in the\r\nAtlantic Monthly. Still more significant was it that he noted a\r\npersistent rumour that the breaking out of the buried race was\r\nclose.--W.J. B., Pres. I. A. of S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nThe Moon Pool\r\n\r\nDa Costa, who had come aboard unnoticed by either of us, now tapped me\r\non the arm.\r\n\r\n\"Doctair Goodwin,\" he said, \"can I see you in my cabin, sair?\"\r\n\r\nAt last, then, he was going to speak.  I followed him.\r\n\r\n\"Doctair,\" he said, when we had entered, \"this is a veree strange\r\nthing that has happened to Olaf. Veree strange. An' the natives of\r\nPonape, they have been very much excite' lately.\r\n\r\n\"Of what they fear I know nothing, nothing!\" Again that quick, furtive\r\ncrossing of himself. \"But this I have to tell you. There came to me\r\nfrom Ranaloa last month a man, a Russian, a doctair, like you. His\r\nname it was Marakinoff. I take him to Ponape an' the natives there\r\nthey will not take him to the Nan-Matal where he wish to go--no! So I\r\ntake him. We leave in a boat, wit' much instrument carefully tied up.\r\nI leave him there wit' the boat an' the food. He tell me to tell no\r\none an' pay me not to. But you are a friend an' Olaf he depend much\r\nupon you an' so I tell you, sair.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know nothing more than this, Da Costa?\" I asked. \"Nothing of\r\nanother expedition?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he shook his head vehemently.  \"Nothing more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear the name Throckmartin while you were there?\" I persisted.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" his eyes were steady as he answered but the pallor had crept\r\nagain into his face.\r\n\r\nI was not so sure.  But if he knew more than he had told me why was he\r\nafraid to speak? My anxiety deepened and later I sought relief from it\r\nby repeating the conversation to O'Keefe.\r\n\r\n\"A Russian, eh,\" he said.  \"Well, they can be damned nice, or\r\ndamned--otherwise. Considering what you did for me, I hope I can look\r\nhim over before the Dolphin shows up.\"\r\n\r\nNext morning we raised Ponape, without further incident, and before\r\nnoon the Suwarna and the Brunhilda had dropped anchor in the harbour.\r\nUpon the excitement and manifest dread of the natives, when we sought\r\namong them for carriers and workmen to accompany us, I will not dwell.\r\nIt is enough to say that no payment we offered could induce a single\r\none of them to go to the Nan-Matal. Nor would they say why.\r\n\r\nFinally it was agreed that the Brunhilda should be left in charge of a\r\nhalf-breed Chinaman, whom both Da Costa and Huldricksson knew and\r\ntrusted. We piled her long-boat up with my instruments and food and\r\ncamping equipment. The Suwarna took us around to Metalanim Harbour,\r\nand there, with the tops of ancient sea walls deep in the blue water\r\nbeneath us, and the ruins looming up out of the mangroves, a scant\r\nmile from us, left us.\r\n\r\nThen with Huldricksson manipulating our small sail, and Larry at the\r\nrudder, we rounded the titanic wall that swept down into the depths,\r\nand turned at last into the canal that Throckmartin, on his map, had\r\nmarked as that which, running between frowning Nan-Tauach and its\r\nsatellite islet, Tau, led straight to the gate of the place of ancient\r\nmysteries.\r\n\r\nAnd as we entered that channel we were enveloped by a silence; a\r\nsilence so intense, so--weighted that it seemed to have substance; an\r\nalien silence that clung and stifled and still stood aloof from\r\nus--the living. It was a stillness, such as might follow the long\r\ntramping of millions into the grave; it was--paradoxical as it may\r\nbe--filled with the withdrawal of life.\r\n\r\nStanding down in the chambered depths of the Great Pyramid I had known\r\nsomething of such silence--but never such intensity as this. Larry\r\nfelt it and I saw him look at me askance. If Olaf, sitting in the bow,\r\nfelt it, too, he gave no sign; his blue eyes, with again the glint of\r\nice within them, watched the channel before us.\r\n\r\nAs we passed, there arose upon our left sheer walls of black basalt\r\nblocks, cyclopean, towering fifty feet or more, broken here and there\r\nby the sinking of their deep foundations.\r\n\r\nIn front of us the mangroves widened out and filled the canal.  On\r\nour right the lesser walls of Tau, sombre blocks smoothed and squared\r\nand set with a cold, mathematical nicety that filled me with vague\r\nawe, slipped by. Through breaks I caught glimpses of dark ruins and of\r\ngreat fallen stones that seemed to crouch and menace us, as we passed.\r\nSomewhere there, hidden, were the seven globes that poured the moon\r\nfire down upon the Moon Pool.\r\n\r\nNow we were among the mangroves and, sail down, the three of us pushed\r\nand pulled the boat through their tangled roots and branches. The\r\nnoise of our passing split the silence like a profanation, and from\r\nthe ancient bastions came murmurs--forbidding, strangely sinister. And\r\nnow we were through, floating on a little open space of shadow-filled\r\nwater. Before us lifted the gateway of Nan-Tauach, gigantic, broken,\r\nincredibly old; shattered portals through which had passed men and\r\nwomen of earth's dawn; old with a weight of years that pressed\r\nleadenly upon the eyes that looked upon it, and yet was in some\r\ncurious indefinable way--menacingly defiant.\r\n\r\nBeyond the gate, back from the portals, stretched a flight of enormous\r\nbasalt slabs, a giant's stairway indeed; and from each side of it\r\nmarched the high walls that were the Dweller's pathway. None of us\r\nspoke as we grounded the boat and dragged it upon a half-submerged\r\npier. And when we did speak it was in whispers.\r\n\r\n\"What next?\" asked Larry.\r\n\r\n\"I think we ought to take a look around,\" I replied in the same low\r\ntones. \"We'll climb the wall here and take a flash about. The whole\r\nplace ought to be plain as day from that height.\"\r\n\r\nHuldricksson, his blue eyes alert, nodded.  With the greatest\r\ndifficulty we clambered up the broken blocks.\r\n\r\nTo the east and south of us, set like children's blocks in the midst\r\nof the sapphire sea, lay dozens of islets, none of them covering more\r\nthan two square miles of surface; each of them a perfect square or\r\noblong within its protecting walls.\r\n\r\nOn none was there sign of life, save for a few great birds that\r\nhovered here and there, and gulls dipping in the blue waves beyond.\r\n\r\nWe turned our gaze down upon the island on which we stood.  It was, I\r\nestimated, about three-quarters of a mile square. The sea wall\r\nenclosed it. It was really an enormous basalt-sided open cube, and\r\nwithin it two other open cubes. The enclosure between the first and\r\nsecond wall was stone paved, with here and there a broken pillar and\r\nlong stone benches. The hibiscus, the aloe tree, and a number of small\r\nshrubs had found place, but seemed only to intensify its stark\r\nloneliness.\r\n\r\n\"Wonder where the Russian can be?\" asked Larry.\r\n\r\nI shook my head.  There was no sign of life here.  Had Marakinoff\r\ngone--or had the Dweller taken him, too? Whatever had happened, there\r\nwas no trace of him below us or on any of the islets within our range\r\nof vision. We scrambled down the side of the gateway. Olaf looked at\r\nme wistfully.\r\n\r\n\"We start the search now, Olaf,\" I said.  \"And first, O'Keefe, let us\r\nsee whether the grey stone is really here. After that we will set up\r\ncamp, and while I unpack, you and Olaf search the island. It won't\r\ntake long.\"\r\n\r\nLarry gave a look at his service automatic and grinned. \"Lead on,\r\nMacduff,\" he said. We made our way up the steps, through the outer\r\nenclosures and into the central square, I confess to a fire of\r\nscientific curiosity and eagerness tinged with a dread that O'Keefe's\r\nanalysis might be true. Would we find the moving slab and, if so,\r\nwould it be as Throckmartin had described? If so, then even Larry\r\nwould have to admit that here was something that theories of gases and\r\nluminous emanations would not explain; and the first test of the whole\r\namazing story would be passed. But if not--And there before us, the\r\nfaintest tinge of grey setting it apart from its neighbouring blocks\r\nof basalt, was the moon door!\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking it.  This was, in very deed, the portal through\r\nwhich Throckmartin had seen pass that gloriously dreadful apparition\r\nhe called the Dweller. At its base was the curious, seemingly polished\r\ncup-like depression within which, my lost friend had told me, the\r\nopening door swung.\r\n\r\nWhat was that portal--more enigmatic than was ever sphinx?  And what\r\nlay beyond it? What did that smooth stone, whose wan deadness\r\nwhispered of ages-old corridors of time opening out into alien,\r\nunimaginable vistas, hide? It had cost the world of science\r\nThrockmartin's great brain--as it had cost Throckmartin those he\r\nloved. It had drawn me to it in search of Throckmartin--and its shadow\r\nhad fallen upon the soul of Olaf the Norseman; and upon what thousands\r\nupon thousands more I wondered, since the brains that had conceived it\r\nhad vanished with their secret knowledge?\r\n\r\nWhat lay beyond it?\r\n\r\nI stretched out a shaking hand and touched the surface of the slab.  A\r\nfaint thrill passed through my hand and arm, oddly unfamiliar and as\r\noddly unpleasant; as of electric contact holding the very essence of\r\ncold. O'Keefe, watching, imitated my action. As his fingers rested on\r\nthe stone his face filled with astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"It's the door?\" he asked.  I nodded.  There was a low whistle from\r\nhim and he pointed up toward the top of the grey stone. I followed the\r\ngesture and saw, above the moon door and on each side of it, two\r\ngently curving bosses of rock, perhaps a foot in diameter.\r\n\r\n\"The moon door's keys,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"It begins to look so,\" answered Larry.  \"If we can find them,\" he\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing we can do till moonrise,\" I replied.  \"And we've none\r\ntoo much time to prepare as it is. Come!\"\r\n\r\nA little later we were beside our boat.  We lightered it, set up the\r\ntent, and as it was now but a short hour to sundown I bade them leave\r\nme and make their search. They went off together, and I busied myself\r\nwith opening some of the paraphernalia I had brought with me.\r\n\r\nFirst of all I took out the two Becquerel ray-condensers that I had\r\nbought in Sydney. Their lenses would collect and intensify to the\r\nfullest extent any light directed upon them. I had found them most\r\nuseful in making spectroscopic analysis of luminous vapours, and I\r\nknew that at Yerkes Observatory splendid results had been obtained\r\nfrom them in collecting the diffused radiance of the nebulae for the\r\nsame purpose.\r\n\r\nIf my theory of the grey slab's mechanism were correct, it was\r\npractically certain that with the satellite only a few nights past the\r\nfull we could concentrate enough light on the bosses to open the rock.\r\nAnd as the ray streams through the seven globes described by\r\nThrockmartin would be too weak to energize the Pool, we could enter\r\nthe chamber free from any fear of encountering its tenant, make our\r\npreliminary observations and go forth before the moon had dropped so\r\nfar that the concentration in the condensers would fall below that\r\nnecessary to keep the portal from closing.\r\n\r\nI took out also a small spectroscope, and a few other instruments for\r\nthe analysis of certain light manifestations and the testing of metal\r\nand liquid. Finally, I put aside my emergency medical kit.\r\n\r\nI had hardly finished examining and adjusting these before O'Keefe and\r\nHuldricksson returned. They reported signs of a camp at least ten days\r\nold beside the northern wall of the outer court, but beyond that no\r\nevidence of others beyond ourselves on Nan-Tauach.\r\n\r\nWe prepared supper, ate and talked a little, but for the most part\r\nwere silent. Even Larry's high spirits were not in evidence; half a\r\ndozen times I saw him take out his automatic and look it over. He was\r\nmore thoughtful than I had ever seen him. Once he went into the tent,\r\nrummaged about a bit and brought out another revolver which, he said,\r\nhe had got from Da Costa, and a half-dozen clips of cartridges. He\r\npassed the gun over to Olaf.\r\n\r\nAt last a glow in the southeast heralded the rising moon. I picked up\r\nmy instruments and the medical kit; Larry and Olaf shouldered each a\r\nshort ladder that was part of my equipment, and, with our electric\r\nflashes pointing the way, walked up the great stairs, through the\r\nenclosures, and straight to the grey stone.\r\n\r\nBy this time the moon had risen and its clipped light shone full upon\r\nthe slab. I saw faint gleams pass over it as of fleeting\r\nphosphorescence--but so faint were they that I could not be sure of\r\nthe truth of my observation.\r\n\r\nWe set the ladders in place.  Olaf I assigned to stand before the door\r\nand watch for the first signs of its opening--if open it should. The\r\nBecquerels were set within three-inch tripods, whose feet I had\r\nequipped with vacuum rings to enable them to hold fast to the rock.\r\n\r\nI scaled one ladder and fastened a condenser over the boss; descended;\r\nsent Larry up to watch it, and, ascending the second ladder, rapidly\r\nfixed the other in its place. Then, with O'Keefe watchful on his\r\nperch, I on mine, and Olaf's eyes fixed upon the moon door, we began\r\nour vigil. Suddenly there was an exclamation from Larry.\r\n\r\n\"Seven little lights are beginning to glow on this stone!\" he cried.\r\n\r\nBut I had already seen those beneath my lens begin to gleam out with a\r\nsilvery lustre. Swiftly the rays within the condenser began to thicken\r\nand increase, and as they did so the seven small circles waxed like\r\nstars growing out of the dusk, and with a queer--curdled is the best\r\nword I can find to define it--radiance entirely strange to me.\r\n\r\nBeneath me I heard a faint, sighing murmur and then the voice of\r\nHuldricksson:\r\n\r\n\"It opens--the stone turns--\"\r\n\r\nI began to climb down the ladder.  Again came Olaf's voice:\r\n\r\n\"The stone--it is open--\" And then a shriek, a wail of blended anguish\r\nand pity, of rage and despair--and the sound of swift footsteps racing\r\nthrough the wall beneath me!\r\n\r\nI dropped to the ground.  The moon door was wide open, and through it\r\nI caught a glimpse of a corridor filled with a faint, pearly vaporous\r\nlight like earliest misty dawn. But of Olaf I could see--nothing! And\r\neven as I stood, gaping, from behind me came the sharp crack of a\r\nrifle; the glass of the condenser at Larry's side flew into fragments;\r\nhe dropped swiftly to the ground, the automatic in his hand flashed\r\nonce, twice, into the darkness.\r\n\r\nAnd the moon door began to pivot slowly, slowly back into its place!\r\n\r\nI rushed toward the turning stone with the wild idea of holding it\r\nopen. As I thrust my hands against it there came at my back a snarl\r\nand an oath and Larry staggered under the impact of a body that had\r\nflung itself straight at his throat. He reeled at the lip of the\r\nshallow cup at the base of the slab, slipped upon its polished curve,\r\nfell and rolled with that which had attacked him, kicking and\r\nwrithing, straight through the narrowing portal into the passage!\r\n\r\nForgetting all else, I sprang to his aid.  As I leaped I felt the\r\nclosing edge of the moon door graze my side. Then, as Larry raised a\r\nfist, brought it down upon the temple of the man who had grappled with\r\nhim and rose from the twitching body unsteadily to his feet, I heard\r\nshuddering past me a mournful whisper; spun about as though some\r\ngiant's hand had whirled me--\r\n\r\nThe end of the corridor no longer opened out into the moonlit square\r\nof ruined Nan-Tauach. It was barred by a solid mass of glimmering\r\nstone. The moon door had closed!\r\n\r\nO'Keefe took a stumbling step toward the barrier behind us. There was\r\nno mark of juncture with the shining walls; the slab fitted into the\r\nsides as closely as a mosaic.\r\n\r\n\"It's shut all right,\" said Larry.  \"But if there's a way in, there's\r\na way out. Anyway, Doc, we're right in the pew we've been heading\r\nfor--so why worry?\" He grinned at me cheerfully. The man on the floor\r\ngroaned, and he dropped to his knees beside him.\r\n\r\n\"Marakinoff!\" he cried.\r\n\r\nAt my exclamation he moved aside, turning the face so I could see it.\r\nIt was clearly Russian, and just as clearly its possessor was one of\r\nunusual force and intellect.\r\n\r\nThe strong, massive brow with orbital ridge unusually developed, the\r\ndominant, high-bridged nose, the straight lips with their more than\r\nsuggestion of latent cruelty, and the strong lines of the jaw beneath\r\na black, pointed beard all gave evidence that here was a personality\r\nbeyond the ordinary.\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't be anybody else,\" said Larry, breaking in on my thoughts.\r\n\"He must have been watching us over there from Chau-ta-leur's vault\r\nall the time.\"\r\n\r\nSwiftly he ran practised hands over his body; then stood erect,\r\nholding out to me two wicked-looking magazine pistols and a knife. \"He\r\ngot one of my bullets through his right forearm, too,\" he said. \"Just\r\na flesh wound, but it made him drop his rifle. Some arsenal, our\r\nlittle Russian scientist, what?\"\r\n\r\nI opened my medical kit.  The wound was a slight one, and Larry stood\r\nlooking on as I bandaged it.\r\n\r\n\"Got another one of those condensers?\" he asked, suddenly.  \"And do\r\nyou suppose Olaf will know enough to use it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Larry,\" I answered, \"Olaf's not outside!  He's in here somewhere!\"\r\n\r\nHis jaw dropped.\r\n\r\n\"The hell you say!\" he whispered.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you hear him shriek when the stone opened?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I heard him yell, yes,\" he said.  \"But I didn't know what was the\r\nmatter. And then this wildcat jumped me--\" He paused and his eyes\r\nwidened. \"Which way did he go?\" he asked swiftly. I pointed down the\r\nfaintly glowing passage.\r\n\r\n\"There's only one way,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Watch that bird close,\" hissed O'Keefe, pointing to Marakinoff--and\r\npistol in hand stretched his long legs and raced away. I looked down\r\nat the Russian. His eyes were open, and he reached out a hand to me. I\r\nlifted him to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"I have heard,\" he said.  \"We follow, quick.  If you will take my arm,\r\nplease, I am shaken yet, yes--\" I gripped his shoulder without a word,\r\nand the two of us set off down the corridor after O'Keefe. Marakinoff\r\nwas gasping, and his weight pressed upon me heavily, but he moved with\r\nall the will and strength that were in him.\r\n\r\nAs we ran I took hasty note of the tunnel.  Its sides were smooth and\r\npolished, and the light seemed to come not from their surfaces, but\r\nfrom far within them--giving to the walls an illusive aspect of\r\ndistance and depth; rendering them in a peculiarly weird\r\nway--spacious. The passage turned, twisted, ran down, turned again. It\r\ncame to me that the light that illumined the tunnel was given out by\r\ntiny points deep within the stone, sprang from the points ripplingly\r\nand spread upon their polished faces.\r\n\r\nThere was a cry from Larry far ahead.\r\n\r\n\"Olaf!\"\r\n\r\nI gripped Marakinoff's arm closer and we sped on.  Now we were coming\r\nfast to the end of the passage. Before us was a high arch, and through\r\nit I glimpsed a dim, shifting luminosity as of mist filled with\r\nrainbows. We reached the portal and I looked into a chamber that might\r\nhave been transported from that enchanted palace of the Jinn King that\r\nrises beyond the magic mountains of Kaf.\r\n\r\nBefore me stood O'Keefe and a dozen feet in front of him,\r\nHuldricksson, with something clasped tightly in his arms. The\r\nNorseman's feet were at the verge of a shining, silvery lip of stone\r\nwithin whose oval lay a blue pool. And down upon this pool staring\r\nupward like a gigantic eye, fell seven pillars of phantom light--one\r\nof them amethyst, one of rose, another of white, a fourth of blue, and\r\nthree of emerald, of silver, and of amber. They fell each upon the\r\nazure surface, and I knew that these were the seven streams of\r\nradiance, within which the Dweller took shape--now but pale ghosts of\r\ntheir brilliancy when the full energy of the moon stream raced through\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHuldricksson bent and placed on the shining silver lip of the Pool\r\nthat which he held--and I saw that it was the body of a child! He set\r\nit there so gently, bent over the side and thrust a hand down into the\r\nwater. And as he did so he moaned and lurched against the little body\r\nthat lay before him. Instantly the form moved--and slipped over the\r\nverge into the blue. Huldricksson threw his body over the stone, hands\r\nclutching, arms thrust deep down--and from his lips issued a\r\nlong-drawn, heart-shrivelling wail of pain and of anguish that held in\r\nit nothing human!\r\n\r\nClose on its wake came a cry from Marakinoff.\r\n\r\n\"Catch him!\" shouted the Russian.  \"Drag him back! Quick!\"\r\n\r\nHe leaped forward, but before he could half clear the distance,\r\nO'Keefe had leaped too, had caught the Norseman by the shoulders and\r\ntoppled him backward, where he lay whimpering and sobbing. And as I\r\nrushed behind Marakinoff I saw Larry lean over the lip of the Pool and\r\ncover his eyes with a shaking hand; saw the Russian peer into it with\r\nreal pity in his cold eyes.\r\n\r\nThen I stared down myself into the Moon Pool, and there, sinking, was\r\na little maid whose dead face and fixed, terror-filled eyes looked\r\nstraight into mine; and ever sinking slowly, slowly--vanished! And I\r\nknew that this was Olaf's Freda, his beloved yndling!\r\n\r\nBut where was the mother, and where had Olaf found his babe?\r\n\r\nThe Russian was first to speak.\r\n\r\n\"You have nitroglycerin there, yes?\" he asked, pointing toward my\r\nmedical kit that I had gripped unconsciously and carried with me\r\nduring the mad rush down the passage. I nodded and drew it out.\r\n\r\n\"Hypodermic,\" he ordered next, curtly; took the syringe, filled it\r\naccurately with its one one-hundredth of a grain dosage, and leaned\r\nover Huldricksson. He rolled up the sailor's sleeves half-way to the\r\nshoulder. The arms were white with somewhat of that weird\r\nsemitranslucence that I had seen on Throckmartin's breast where a\r\ntendril of the Dweller had touched him; and his hands were of the same\r\nwhiteness--like a baroque pearl. Above the line of white, Marakinoff\r\nthrust the needle.\r\n\r\n\"He will need all his heart can do,\" he said to me.\r\n\r\nThen he reached down into a belt about his waist and drew from it a\r\nsmall, flat flask of what seemed to be lead. He opened it and let a\r\nfew drops of its contents fall on each arm of the Norwegian. The\r\nliquid sparkled and instantly began to spread over the skin much as\r\noil or gasoline dropped on water does--only far more rapidly. And as\r\nit spread it drew a sparkling film over the marbled flesh and little\r\nwisps of vapour rose from it. The Norseman's mighty chest heaved with\r\nagony. His hands clenched. The Russian gave a grunt of satisfaction at\r\nthis, dropped a little more of the liquid, and then, watching closely,\r\ngrunted again and leaned back. Huldricksson's laboured breathing\r\nceased, his head dropped upon Larry's knee, and from his arms and\r\nhands the whiteness swiftly withdrew.\r\n\r\nMarakinoff arose and contemplated us--almost benevolently.\r\n\r\n\"He will all right be in five minutes,\" he said.  \"I know.  I do it to\r\npay for that shot of mine, and also because we will need him. Yes.\" He\r\nturned to Larry. \"You have a poonch like a mule kick, my young\r\nfriend,\" he said. \"Some time you pay me for that, too, eh?\" He smiled;\r\nand the quality of the grimace was not exactly reassuring. Larry\r\nlooked him over quizzically.\r\n\r\n\"You're Marakinoff, of course,\" he said.  The Russian nodded,\r\nbetraying no surprise at the recognition.\r\n\r\n\"And you?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Lieutenant O'Keefe of the Royal Flying Corps,\" replied Larry,\r\nsaluting. \"And this gentleman is Dr. Walter T. Goodwin.\"\r\n\r\nMarakinoff's face brightened.\r\n\r\n\"The American botanist?\" he queried.  I nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" cried Marakinoff eagerly, \"but this is fortunate. Long I have\r\ndesired to meet you. Your work, for an American, is most excellent;\r\nsurprising. But you are wrong in your theory of the development of the\r\nAngiospermae from Cycadeoidea dacotensis. Da--all wrong--\"\r\n\r\nI was interrupting him with considerable heat, for my conclusions from\r\nthe fossil Cycadeoidea I knew to be my greatest triumph, when Larry\r\nbroke in upon me rudely.\r\n\r\n\"Say,\" he spluttered, \"am I crazy or are you?  What in damnation kind\r\nof a place and time is this to start an argument like that?\r\n\r\n\"Angiospermae, is it?\" exclaimed Larry.  \"HELL!\"\r\n\r\nMarakinoff again regarded him with that irritating air of benevolence.\r\n\r\n\"You have not the scientific mind, young friend,\" he said. \"The\r\npoonch, yes! But so has the mule. You must learn that only the fact is\r\nimportant--not you, not me, not this\"--he pointed to Huldricksson--\"or\r\nits sorrows. Only the fact, whatever it is, is real, yes. But\"--he\r\nturned to me--\"another time--\"\r\n\r\nHuldricksson interrupted him.  The big seaman had risen stiffly to his\r\nfeet and stood with Larry's arm supporting him. He stretched out his\r\nhands to me.\r\n\r\n\"I saw her,\" he whispered.  \"I saw mine Freda when the stone swung.\r\nShe lay there--just at my feet. I picked her up and I saw that mine\r\nFreda was dead. But I hoped--and I thought maybe mine Helma was\r\nsomewhere here, too, So I ran with mine yndling--here--\" His voice\r\nbroke. \"I thought maybe she was _not_ dead,\" he went on. \"And I saw\r\nthat\"--he pointed to the Moon Pool--\"and I thought I would bathe her\r\nface and she might live again. And when I dipped my hands within--the\r\nlife left them, and cold, deadly cold, ran up through them into my\r\nheart. And mine Freda--she fell--\" he covered his eyes, and dropping\r\nhis head on O'Keefe's shoulder, stood, racked by sobs that seemed to\r\ntear at his very soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nThe Flame-Tipped Shadows\r\n\r\nMarakinoff nodded his head solemnly as Olaf finished.\r\n\r\n\"Da!\" he said.  \"That which comes from here took them both--the woman\r\nand the child. Da! They came clasped within it and the stone shut upon\r\nthem. But why it left the child behind I do not understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know that?\" I cried in amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Because I saw it,\" answered Marakinoff simply.  \"Not only did I see\r\nit, but hardly had I time to make escape through the entrance before\r\nit passed whirling and murmuring and its bell sounds all joyous. Da!\r\nIt was what you call the squeak close, that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a moment,\" I said--stilling Larry with a gesture. \"Do I\r\nunderstand you to say that you were within this place?\"\r\n\r\nMarakinoff actually beamed upon me.\r\n\r\n\"Da, Dr. Goodwin,\" he said, \"I went in when that which comes from it\r\nwent out!\"\r\n\r\nI gaped at him, stricken dumb; into Larry's bellicose attitude crept a\r\nsuggestion of grudging respect; Olaf, trembling, watched silently.\r\n\r\n\"Dr.  Goodwin and my impetuous young friend, you,\" went on Marakinoff\r\nafter a moment's silence and I wondered vaguely why he did not include\r\nHuldricksson in his address--\"it is time that we have an\r\nunderstanding. I have a proposal to make to you also. It is this; we\r\nare what you call a bad boat, and all of us are in it. Da! We need all\r\nhands, is it not so? Let us put together our knowledge and our brains\r\nand resources--and even a poonch of a mule is a resource,\" he looked\r\nwickedly at O'Keefe, \"and pull our boat into quiet waters again. After\r\nthat--\"\r\n\r\n\"All very well, Marakinoff,\" interjected Larry, \"but I don't feel very\r\nsafe in any boat with somebody capable of shooting me through the\r\nback.\"\r\n\r\nMarakinoff waved a deprecatory hand.\r\n\r\n\"It was natural that,\" he said, \"logical, da!  Here is a very great\r\nsecret, perhaps many secrets to my country invaluable--\" He paused,\r\nshaken by some overpowering emotion; the veins in his forehead grew\r\ncongested, the cold eyes blazed and the guttural voice harshened.\r\n\r\n\"I do not apologize and I do not explain,\" rasped Marakinoff.  \"But I\r\nwill tell you, da! Here is my country sweating blood in an experiment\r\nto liberate the world. And here are the other nations ringing us like\r\nwolves and waiting to spring at our throats at the least sign of\r\nweakness. And here are you, Lieutenant O'Keefe of the English wolves,\r\nand you Dr. Goodwin of the Yankee pack--and here in this place may be\r\nthat will enable my country to win its war for the worker. What are\r\nthe lives of you two and this sailor to that? Less than the flies I\r\ncrush with my hand, less than midges in the sunbeam!\"\r\n\r\nHe suddenly gripped himself.\r\n\r\n\"But that is not now the important thing,\" he resumed, almost coldly.\r\n\"Not that nor my shooting. Let us squarely the situation face. My\r\nproposal is so: that we join interests, and what you call see it\r\nthrough together; find our way through this place and those secrets\r\nlearn of which I have spoken, if we can. And when that is done we will\r\ngo our ways, to his own land each, to make use of them for our lands\r\nas each of us may. On my part, I offer my knowledge--and it is very\r\nvaluable, Dr. Goodwin--and my training. You and Lieutenant O'Keefe do\r\nthe same, and this man Olaf, what he can of his strength, for I do not\r\nthink his usefulness lies in his brains, no.\"\r\n\r\n\"In effect, Goodwin,\" broke in Larry as I hesitated, \"the professor's\r\nproposition is this: he wants to know what's going on here but he\r\nbegins to realize it's no one man's job and besides we have the drop\r\non him. We're three to his one, and we have all his hardware and\r\ncutlery. But also we can do better with him than without him--just as\r\nhe can do better with us than without us. It's an even break--for a\r\nwhile. But once he gets that information he's looking for, then look\r\nout. You and Olaf and I are the wolves and the flies and the midges\r\nagain--and the strafing will be about due. Nevertheless, with three to\r\none against him, if he can get away with it he deserves to. I'm for\r\ntaking him up, if you are.\"\r\n\r\nThere was almost a twinkle in Marakinoff's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"It is not just as I would have put it, perhaps,\" he said, \"but in its\r\nskeleton he has right. Nor will I turn my hand against you while we\r\nare still in danger here. I pledge you my honor on this.\"\r\n\r\nLarry laughed.\r\n\r\n\"All right, Professor,\" he grinned.  \"I believe you mean every word\r\nyou say. Nevertheless, I'll just keep the guns.\"\r\n\r\nMarakinoff bowed, imperturbably.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" he said, \"I will tell you what I know.  I found the secret\r\nof the door mechanism even as you did, Dr. Goodwin. But by\r\ncarelessness, my condensers were broken. I was forced to wait while I\r\nsent for others--and the waiting might be for months. I took certain\r\nprecautions, and on the first night of this full moon I hid myself\r\nwithin the vault of Chau-ta-leur.\"\r\n\r\nAn involuntary thrill of admiration for the man went through me at the\r\nmanifest heroism of this leap in the dark. I could see it reflected in\r\nLarry's face.\r\n\r\n\"I hid in the vault,\" continued Marakinoff, \"and I saw that which\r\ncomes from here come out. I waited--long hours. At last, when the moon\r\nwas low, it returned--ecstatically--with a man, a native, in embrace\r\nenfolded. It passed through the door, and soon then the moon became\r\nlow and the door closed.\r\n\r\n\"The next night more confidence was mine, yes.  And after that which\r\ncomes had gone, I looked through its open door. I said, 'It will not\r\nreturn for three hours. While it is away, why shall I not into its\r\nhome go through the door it has left open?' So I went--even to here. I\r\nlooked at the pillars of light and I tested the liquid of the Pool on\r\nwhich they fell. That liquid, Dr. Goodwin, is not water, and it is not\r\nany fluid known on earth.\" He handed me a small vial, its neck held in\r\na long thong.\r\n\r\n\"Take this,\" he said, \"and see.\"\r\n\r\nWonderingly, I took the bottle; dipped it down into the Pool.  The\r\nliquid was extraordinarily light; seemed, in fact, to give the vial\r\nbuoyancy. I held it to the light. It was striated, streaked, as though\r\nlittle living, pulsing veins ran through it. And its blueness, even in\r\nthe vial, held an intensity of luminousness.\r\n\r\n\"Radioactive,\" said Marakinoff.  \"Some liquid that is intensely\r\nradioactive; but what it is I know not at all. Upon the living skin it\r\nacts like radium raised to the nth power and with an element most\r\nmysterious added. The solution with which I treated him,\" he pointed\r\nto Huldricksson, \"I had prepared before I came here, from certain\r\ninformation I had. It is largely salts of radium and its base is\r\nLoeb's formula for the neutralization of radium and X-ray burns.\r\nTaking this man at once, before the degeneration had become really\r\nactive, I could negative it. But after two hours I could have done\r\nnothing.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Next I studied the nature of these luminous walls.  I concluded that\r\nwhoever had made them, knew the secret of the Almighty's manufacture\r\nof light from the ether itself! Colossal! Da! But the substance of\r\nthese blocks confines an atomic--how would you say--atomic\r\nmanipulation, a conscious arrangement of electrons, light-emitting and\r\nperhaps indefinitely so. These blocks are lamps in which oil and wick\r\nare electrons drawing light waves from ether itself! A Prometheus,\r\nindeed, this discoverer! I looked at my watch and that little guardian\r\nwarned me that it was time to go. I went. That which comes forth\r\nreturned--this time empty-handed.\r\n\r\n\"And the next night I did the same thing.  Engrossed in research, I\r\nlet the moments go by to the danger point, and scarcely was I replaced\r\nwithin the vault when the shining thing raced over the walls, and in\r\nits grip the woman and child.\r\n\r\n\"Then you came--and that is all.  And now--what is it you know?\"\r\n\r\nVery briefly I went over my story.  His eyes gleamed now and then, but\r\nhe did not interrupt me.\r\n\r\n\"A great secret!  A colossal secret!\" he muttered, when I had ended.\r\n\"We cannot leave it hidden.\"\r\n\r\n\"The first thing to do is to try the door,\" said Larry, matter of\r\nfact.\r\n\r\n\"There is no use, my young friend,\" assured Marakinoff mildly.\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless we'll try,\" said Larry.  We retraced our way through the\r\nwinding tunnel to the end, but soon even O'Keefe saw that any idea of\r\nmoving the slab from within was hopeless. We returned to the Chamber\r\nof the Pool. The pillars of light were fainter, and we knew that the\r\nmoon was sinking. On the world outside before long dawn would be\r\nbreaking. I began to feel thirst--and the blue semblance of water\r\nwithin the silvery rim seemed to glint mockingly as my eyes rested on\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"Da!\" it was Marakinoff, reading my thoughts uncannily. \"Da!  We will\r\nbe thirsty. And it will be very bad for him of us who loses control\r\nand drinks of that, my friend. Da!\"\r\n\r\nLarry threw back his shoulders as though shaking a burden from them.\r\n\r\n\"This place would give an angel of joy the willies,\" he said.  \"I\r\nsuggest that we look around and find something that will take us\r\nsomewhere. You can bet the people that built it had more ways of\r\ngetting in than that once-a-month family entrance. Doc, you and Olaf\r\ntake the left wall; the professor and I will take the right.\"\r\n\r\nHe loosened one of his automatics with a suggestive movement.\r\n\r\n\"After you, Professor,\" he bowed, politely, to the Russian. We parted\r\nand set forth.\r\n\r\nThe chamber widened out from the portal in what seemed to be the arc\r\nof an immense circle. The shining walls held a perceptible curve, and\r\nfrom this curvature I estimated that the roof was fully three hundred\r\nfeet above us.\r\n\r\nThe floor was of smooth, mosaic-fitted blocks of a faintly yellow\r\ntinge. They were not light-emitting like the blocks that formed the\r\nwalls. The radiance from these latter, I noted, had the peculiar\r\nquality of _thickening_ a few yards from its source, and it was this\r\nthat produced the effect of misty, veiled distances. As we walked, the\r\nseven columns of rays streaming down from the crystalline globes high\r\nabove us waned steadily; the glow within the chamber lost its\r\nprismatic shimmer and became an even grey tone somewhat like moonlight\r\nin a thin cloud.\r\n\r\nNow before us, out from the wall, jutted a low terrace.  It was all of\r\na pearly rose-coloured stone, slender, graceful pillars of the same\r\nhue. The face of the terrace was about ten feet high, and all over it\r\nran a bas-relief of what looked like short-trailing vines, surmounted\r\nby five stalks, on the tip of each of which was a flower.\r\n\r\nWe passed along the terrace.  It turned in an abrupt curve. I heard a\r\nhail, and there, fifty feet away, at the curving end of a wall\r\nidentical with that where we stood, were Larry and Marakinoff.\r\nObviously the left side of the chamber was a duplicate of that we had\r\nexplored. We joined. In front of us the columned barriers ran back a\r\nhundred feet, forming an alcove. The end of this alcove was another\r\nwall of the same rose stone, but upon it the design of vines was much\r\nheavier.\r\n\r\nWe took a step forward--there was a gasp of awe from the Norseman, a\r\nguttural exclamation from Marakinoff. For on, or rather within, the\r\nwall before us, a great oval began to glow, waxed almost to a flame\r\nand then shone steadily out as though from behind it a light was\r\nstreaming through the stone itself!\r\n\r\nAnd within the roseate oval two flame-tipped shadows appeared, stood\r\nfor a moment, and then seemed to float out upon its surface. The\r\nshadows wavered; the tips of flame that nimbused them with flickering\r\npoints of vermilion pulsed outward, drew back, darted forth again, and\r\nonce more withdrew themselves--and as they did so the shadows\r\nthickened--and suddenly there before us stood two figures!\r\n\r\nOne was a girl--a girl whose great eyes were golden as the fabled\r\nlilies of Kwan-Yung that were born of the kiss of the sun upon the\r\namber goddess the demons of Lao-Tz'e carved for him; whose softly\r\ncurved lips were red as the royal coral, and whose golden-brown hair\r\nreached to her knees!\r\n\r\nAnd the second was a gigantic frog--A _woman_ frog, head helmeted with\r\ncarapace of shell around which a fillet of brilliant yellow jewels\r\nshone; enormous round eyes of blue circled with a broad iris of green;\r\nmonstrous body of banded orange and white girdled with strand upon\r\nstrand of the flashing yellow gems; six feet high if an inch, and with\r\none webbed paw of its short, powerfully muscled forelegs resting upon\r\nthe white shoulder of the golden-eyed girl!\r\n\r\nMoments must have passed as we stood in stark amazement, gazing at\r\nthat incredible apparition. The two figures, although as real as any\r\nof those who stood beside me, unphantomlike as it is possible to be,\r\nhad a distinct suggestion of--projection.\r\n\r\nThey were there before us--golden-eyed girl and grotesque\r\nfrog-woman--complete in every line and curve; and still it was as\r\nthough their bodies passed back through distances; as though, to try\r\nto express the wellnigh inexpressible, the two shapes we were looking\r\nupon were the end of an infinite number stretching in fine linked\r\nchain far away, of which the eyes saw only the nearest, while in the\r\nbrain some faculty higher than sight recognized and registered the\r\nunseen others.\r\n\r\nThe gigantic eyes of the frog-woman took us all in--unwinkingly.\r\nLittle glints of phosphorescence shone out within the metallic green\r\nof the outer iris ring. She stood upright, her great legs bowed; the\r\nmonstrous slit of a mouth slightly open, revealing a row of white\r\nteeth sharp and pointed as lancets; the paw resting on the girl's\r\nshoulder, half covering its silken surface, and from its five webbed\r\ndigits long yellow claws of polished horn glistened against the\r\ndelicate texture of the flesh.\r\n\r\nBut if the frog-woman regarded us all, not so did the maiden of the\r\nrosy wall. Her eyes were fastened upon Larry, drinking him in with\r\nextraordinary intentness. She was tall, far over the average of women,\r\nalmost as tall, indeed, as O'Keefe himself; not more than twenty years\r\nold, if that, I thought. Abruptly she leaned forward, the golden eyes\r\nsoftened and grew tender; the red lips moved as though she were\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\nLarry took a quick step, and his face was that of one who after\r\ncountless births comes at last upon the twin soul lost to him for\r\nages. The frog-woman turned her eyes upon the girl; her huge lips\r\nmoved, and I knew that she was talking! The girl held out a warning\r\nhand to O'Keefe, and then raised it, resting each finger upon one of\r\nthe five flowers of the carved vine close beside her. Once, twice,\r\nthree times, she pressed upon the flower centres, and I noted that her\r\nhand was curiously long and slender, the digits like those wonderful\r\ntapering ones the painters we call the primitive gave to their\r\nVirgins.\r\n\r\nThree times she pressed the flowers, and then looked intently at Larry\r\nonce more. A slow, sweet smile curved the crimson lips. She stretched\r\nboth hands out toward him again eagerly; a burning blush rose swiftly\r\nover white breasts and flowerlike face.\r\n\r\nLike the clicking out of a cinematograph, the pulsing oval faded and\r\ngolden-eyed girl and frog-woman were gone!\r\n\r\nAnd thus it was that Lakla, the handmaiden of the Silent Ones, and\r\nLarry O'Keefe first looked into each other's hearts!\r\n\r\nLarry stood rapt, gazing at the stone.\r\n\r\n\"Eilidh,\" I heard him whisper; \"Eilidh of the lips like the red, red\r\nrowan and the golden-brown hair!\"\r\n\r\n\"Clearly of the Ranadae,\" said Marakinoff, \"a development of the\r\nfossil Labyrinthodonts: you saw her teeth, da?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ranadae, yes,\" I answered.  \"But from the Stegocephalia; of the order\r\nEcaudata--\"\r\n\r\nNever such a complete indignation as was in O'Keefe's voice as he\r\ninterrupted.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean--fossils and Stego whatever it is?\" he asked.  \"She\r\nwas a girl, a wonder girl--a real girl, and Irish, or I'm not an\r\nO'Keefe!\"\r\n\r\n\"We were talking about the frog-woman, Larry,\" I said, conciliatingly.\r\n\r\nHis eyes were wild as he regarded us.\r\n\r\n\"Say,\" he said, \"if you two had been in the Garden of Eden when Eve\r\ntook the apple, you wouldn't have had time to give her a look for\r\ncounting the scales on the snake!\"\r\n\r\nHe strode swiftly over to the wall.  We followed.  Larry paused,\r\nstretched his hand up to the flowers on which the tapering fingers of\r\nthe golden-eyed girl had rested.\r\n\r\n\"It was here she put up her hand,\" he murmured.  He pressed\r\ncaressingly the carved calyxes, once, twice, a third time even as she\r\nhad--and silently and softly the wall began to split; on each side a\r\ngreat stone pivoted slowly, and before us a portal stood, opening into\r\na narrow corridor glowing with the same rosy lustre that had gleamed\r\naround the flame-tipped shadows!\r\n\r\n\"Have your gun ready, Olaf!\" said Larry.  \"We follow Golden Eyes,\" he\r\nsaid to me.\r\n\r\n\"Follow?\" I echoed stupidly.\r\n\r\n\"Follow!\" he said.  \"She came to show us the way!  Follow? I'd follow\r\nher through a thousand hells!\"\r\n\r\nAnd with Olaf at one end, O'Keefe at the other, both of them with\r\nautomatics in hand, and Marakinoff and I between them, we stepped over\r\nthe threshold.\r\n\r\nAt our right, a few feet away, the passage ended abruptly in a square\r\nof polished stone, from which came faint rose radiance. The roof of\r\nthe place was less than two feet over O'Keefe's head.\r\n\r\nA yard at left of us lifted a four-foot high, gently curved barricade,\r\nstretching from wall to wall--and beyond it was blackness; an utter\r\nand appalling blackness that seemed to gather itself from infinite\r\ndepths. The rose-glow in which we stood was cut off by the blackness\r\nas though it had substance; it shimmered out to meet it, and was\r\nchecked as though by a blow; indeed, so strong was the suggestion of\r\nsinister, straining force within the rayless opacity that I shrank\r\nback, and Marakinoff with me. Not so O'Keefe. Olaf beside him, he\r\nstrode to the wall and peered over. He beckoned us.\r\n\r\n\"Flash your pocket-light down there,\" he said to me, pointing into the\r\nthick darkness below us. The little electric circle quivered down as\r\nthough afraid, and came to rest upon a surface that resembled nothing\r\nso much as clear, black ice. I ran the light across--here and there.\r\nThe floor of the corridor was of a substance so smooth, so polished,\r\nthat no man could have walked upon it; it sloped downward at a slowly\r\nincreasing angle.\r\n\r\n\"We'd have to have non-skid chains and brakes on our feet to tackle\r\nthat,\" mused Larry. Abstractedly be ran his hands over the edge on\r\nwhich he was leaning. Suddenly they hesitated and then gripped\r\ntightly.\r\n\r\n\"That's a queer one!\" he exclaimed.  His right palm was resting upon a\r\nrounded protuberance, on the side of which were three small circular\r\nindentations.\r\n\r\n\"A queer one--\" he repeated--and pressed his fingers upon the circles.\r\n\r\nThere was a sharp click; the slabs that had opened to let us through\r\nswung swiftly together; a curiously rapid vibration thrilled through\r\nus, a wind arose and passed over our heads--a wind that grew and grew\r\nuntil it became a whistling shriek, then a roar and then a mighty\r\nhumming, to which every atom in our bodies pulsed in rhythm painful\r\nalmost to disintegration!\r\n\r\nThe rosy wall dwindled in a flash to a point of light and disappeared!\r\n\r\nWrapped in the clinging, impenetrable blackness we were racing,\r\ndropping, hurling at a frightful speed--where?\r\n\r\nAnd ever that awful humming of the rushing wind and the lightning\r\ncleaving of the tangible dark--so, it came to me oddly, must the newly\r\nreleased soul race through the sheer blackness of outer space up to\r\nthat Throne of Justice, where God sits high above all suns!\r\n\r\nI felt Marakinoff creep close to me; gripped my nerve and flashed my\r\npocket-light; saw Larry standing, peering, peering ahead, and\r\nHuldricksson, one strong arm around his shoulders, bracing him. And\r\nthen the speed began to slacken.\r\n\r\nMillions of miles, it seemed, below the sound of the unearthly\r\nhurricane I heard Larry's voice, thin and ghostlike, beneath its\r\nclamour.\r\n\r\n\"Got it!\" shrilled the voice.  \"Got it!  Don't worry!\"\r\n\r\nThe wind died down to the roar, passed back into the whistling shriek\r\nand diminished to a steady whisper. In the comparative quiet O'Keefe's\r\ntones now came in normal volume.\r\n\r\n\"Some little shoot-the-chutes, what?\" he shouted.  \"Say--if they had\r\nthis at Coney Island or the Crystal Palace! Press all the way in these\r\nholes and she goes top-high. Diminish pressure--diminish speed. The\r\ncurve of this--dashboard--here sends the wind shooting up over our\r\nheads--like a windshield. What's behind you?\"\r\n\r\nI flashed the light back.  The mechanism on which we were ended in\r\nanother wall exactly similar to that over which O'Keefe crouched.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we can't fall out, anyway,\" he laughed.  \"Wish to hell I knew\r\nwhere the brakes were! Look out!\"\r\n\r\nWe dropped dizzily down an abrupt, seemingly endless slope; fell--fell\r\nas into an abyss--then shot abruptly out of the blackness into a\r\nthrobbing green radiance. O'Keefe's fingers must have pressed down\r\nupon the controls, for we leaped forward almost with the speed of\r\nlight. I caught a glimpse of luminous immensities on the verge of\r\nwhich we flew; of depths inconceivable, and flitting through the\r\nincredible spaces--gigantic shadows as of the wings of Israfel, which\r\nare so wide, say the Arabs, the world can cower under them like a\r\nnestling--and then--again the living blackness!\r\n\r\n\"What was that?\" This from Larry, with the nearest approach to awe\r\nthat he had yet shown.\r\n\r\n\"Trolldom!\" croaked the voice of Olaf.\r\n\r\n\"Chert!\"  This from Marakinoff.  \"What a space!\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you considered, Dr. Goodwin,\" he went on after a pause, \"a\r\ncurious thing? We know, or, at least, is it not that nine out of ten\r\nastronomers believe, that the moon was hurled out of this same region\r\nwe now call the Pacific when the earth was yet like molasses; almost\r\nmolten, I should say. And is it not curious that that which comes from\r\nthe Moon Chamber needs the moon-rays to bring it forth; is it not? And\r\nis it not significant again that the stone depends upon the moon for\r\noperating? Da! And last--such a space in mother earth as we just\r\nglimpsed, how else could it have been torn but by some gigantic\r\nbirth--like that of the moon? Da! I do not put forward these as\r\nstatements of fact--no! But as suggestions--\"\r\n\r\nI started; there was so much that this might explain--an unknown\r\nelement that responded to the moon-rays in opening the moon door; the\r\nblue Pool with its weird radioactivity, and the force within it that\r\nreacted to the same light stream--\r\n\r\nIt was not inconceivable that a film had drawn over the world wound, a\r\nfilm of earth-flesh which drew itself over that colossal abyss after\r\nour planet had borne its satellite--that world womb did not close\r\nwhen her shining child sprang forth--it was possible; and all that we\r\nknow of earth depth is four miles of her eight thousand.\r\n\r\nWhat is there at the heart of earth?  What of that radiant unknown\r\nelement upon the moon mount Tycho? What of that element unknown to us\r\nas part of earth which is seen only in the corona of the sun at\r\neclipse that we call coronium? Yet the earth is child of the sun as\r\nthe moon is earth's daughter. And what of that other unknown element\r\nwe find glowing green in the far-flung nebulae--green as that we had\r\njust passed through--and that we call nebulium? Yet the sun is child\r\nof the nebulae as the earth is child of the sun and the moon is child\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\nAnd what miracles are there in coronium and nebulium which, as the\r\nchild of nebula and sun, we inherit? Yes--and in Tycho's enigma which\r\ncame from earth heart?\r\n\r\nWe were flashing down to earth heart!  And what miracles were hidden\r\nthere?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nThe End of the Journey\r\n\r\n\"Say Doc!\" It was Larry's voice flung back at me.  \"I was thinking\r\nabout that frog. I think it was her pet. Damn me if I see any\r\ndifference between a frog and a snake, and one of the nicest women I\r\never knew had two pet pythons that followed her around like kittens.\r\nNot such a devilish lot of choice between a frog and a snake--except\r\non the side of the frog? What? Anyway, any pet that girl wants is\r\nhers, I don't care if it's a leaping twelve-toed lobster or a\r\nwhale-bodied scorpion. Get me?\"\r\n\r\nBy which I knew that our remarks upon the frog woman were still\r\nbothering O'Keefe.\r\n\r\n\"He thinks of foolish nothings like the foolish sailor!\" grunted\r\nMarakinoff, acid contempt in his words. \"What are their women\r\nto--this?\" He swept out a hand and as though at a signal the car\r\npoised itself for an instant, then dipped, literally dipped down into\r\nsheer space; skimmed forward in what was clearly curved flight, rose\r\nas upon a sweeping upgrade and then began swiftly to slacken its\r\nfearful speed.\r\n\r\nFar ahead a point of light showed; grew steadily; we were within\r\nit--and softly all movement ceased. How acute had been the strain of\r\nour journey I did not realize until I tried to stand--and sank back,\r\nleg-muscles too shaky to bear my weight. The car rested in a slit in\r\nthe centre of a smooth walled chamber perhaps twenty feet square. The\r\nwall facing us was pierced by a low doorway through which we could see\r\na flight of steps leading downward.\r\n\r\nThe light streamed through a small opening, the base of which was\r\ntwice a tall man's height from the floor. A curving flight of broad,\r\nlow steps led up to it. And now it came to my steadying brain that\r\nthere was something puzzling, peculiar, strangely unfamiliar about\r\nthis light. It was silvery, shaded faintly with a delicate blue and\r\nflushed lightly with a nacreous rose; but a rose that differed from\r\nthat of the terraces of the Pool Chamber as the rose within the opal\r\ndiffers from that within the pearl. In it were tiny, gleaming points\r\nlike the motes in a sunbeam, but sparkling white like the dust of\r\ndiamonds, and with a quality of vibrant vitality; they were as though\r\nthey were alive. The light cast no shadows!\r\n\r\nA little breeze came through the oval and played about us. It was\r\nladen with what seemed the mingled breath of spice flowers and pines.\r\nIt was curiously vivifying, and in it the diamonded atoms of light\r\nshook and danced.\r\n\r\nI stepped out of the car, the Russian following, and began to ascend\r\nthe curved steps toward the opening, at the top of which O'Keefe and\r\nOlaf already stood. As they looked out I saw both their faces\r\nchange--Olaf's with awe, O'Keefe's with incredulous amaze. I hurried\r\nto their side.\r\n\r\nAt first all that I could see was space--a space filled with the same\r\ncoruscating effulgence that pulsed about me. I glanced upward, obeying\r\nthat instinctive impulse of earth folk that bids them seek within the\r\nsky for sources of light. There was no sky--at least no sky such as we\r\nknow--all was a sparkling nebulosity rising into infinite distances as\r\nthe azure above the day-world seems to fill all the heavens--through\r\nit ran pulsing waves and flashing javelin rays that were like shining\r\nshadows of the aurora; echoes, octaves lower, of those brilliant\r\narpeggios and chords that play about the poles. My eyes fell beneath\r\nits splendour; I stared outward.\r\n\r\nMiles away, gigantic luminous cliffs sprang sheer from the limits of a\r\nlake whose waters were of milky opalescence. It was from these cliffs\r\nthat the spangled radiance came, shimmering out from all their\r\nlustrous surfaces. To left and to right, as far as the eye could see,\r\nthey stretched--and they vanished in the auroral nebulosity on high!\r\n\r\n\"Look at that!\" exclaimed Larry.  I followed his pointing finger.  On\r\nthe face of the shining wall, stretched between two colossal columns,\r\nhung an incredible veil; prismatic, gleaming with all the colours of\r\nthe spectrum. It was like a web of rainbows woven by the fingers of\r\nthe daughters of the Jinn. In front of it and a little at each side\r\nwas a semi-circular pier, or, better, a plaza of what appeared to be\r\nglistening, pale-yellow ivory. At each end of its half-circle\r\nclustered a few low-walled, rose-stone structures, each of them\r\nsurmounted by a number of high, slender pinnacles.\r\n\r\nWe looked at each other, I think, a bit helplessly--and back again\r\nthrough the opening. We were standing, as I have said, at its base.\r\nThe wall in which it was set was at least ten feet thick, and so, of\r\ncourse, all that we could see of that which was without were the\r\ndistances that revealed themselves above the outer ledge of the oval.\r\n\r\n\"Let's take a look at what's under us,\" said Larry.\r\n\r\nHe crept out upon the ledge and peered down, the rest of us following.\r\nA hundred yards beneath us stretched gardens that must have been like\r\nthose of many-columned Iram, which the ancient Addite King had built\r\nfor his pleasure ages before the deluge, and which Allah, so the Arab\r\nlegend tells, took and hid from man, within the Sahara, beyond all\r\nhope of finding--jealous because they were more beautiful than his in\r\nparadise. Within them flowers and groves of laced, fernlike trees,\r\npillared pavilions nestled.\r\n\r\nThe trunks of the trees were of emerald, of vermilion, and of\r\nazure-blue, and the blossoms, whose fragrance was borne to us, shone\r\nlike jewels. The graceful pillars were tinted delicately. I noted that\r\nthe pavilions were double--in a way, two-storied--and that they were\r\noddly splotched with circles, with squares, and with oblongs\r\nof--opacity; noted too that over many this opacity stretched like a\r\nroof; yet it did not seem material; rather was it--impenetrable\r\nshadow!\r\n\r\nDown through this city of gardens ran a broad shining green\r\nthoroughfare, glistening like glass and spanned at regular intervals\r\nwith graceful, arched bridges. The road flashed to a wide square,\r\nwhere rose, from a base of that same silvery stone that formed the lip\r\nof the Moon Pool, a titanic structure of seven terraces; and along it\r\nflitted objects that bore a curious resemblance to the shell of the\r\nNautilus. Within them were--human figures! And upon tree-bordered\r\npromenades on each side walked others!\r\n\r\nFar to the right we caught the glint of another emerald-paved road.\r\n\r\nAnd between the two the gardens grew sweetly down to the hither side\r\nof that opalescent water across which were the radiant cliffs and the\r\ncurtain of mystery.\r\n\r\nThus it was that we first saw the city of the Dweller; blessed and\r\naccursed as no place on earth, or under or above earth has ever\r\nbeen--or, that force willing which some call God, ever again shall be!\r\n\r\n\"Chert!\" whispered Marakinoff.  \"Incredible!\"\r\n\r\n\"Trolldom!\" gasped Olaf Huldricksson.  \"It is Trolldom!\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Olaf!\" said Larry.  \"Cut out that Trolldom stuff! There's no\r\nTrolldom, or fairies, outside Ireland. Get that! And this isn't\r\nIreland. And, buck up, Professor!\" This to Marakinoff. \"What you see\r\ndown there are people--_just plain people_. And wherever there's people\r\nis where I live. Get me?\r\n\r\n\"There's no way in but in--and no way out but out,\" said O'Keefe.\r\n\"And there's the stairway. Eggs are eggs no matter how they're\r\ncooked--and people are just people, fellow travellers, no matter what\r\ndish they are in,\" he concluded. \"Come on!\"\r\n\r\nWith the three of us close behind him, he marched toward the entrance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nYolara, Priestess of the Shining One\r\n\r\n\"You'd better have this handy, Doc.\" O'Keefe paused at the head of the\r\nstairway and handed me one of the automatics he had taken from\r\nMarakinoff.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I not have one also?\" rather anxiously asked the latter.\r\n\r\n\"When you need it you'll get it,\" answered O'Keefe.  \"I'll tell you\r\nfrankly, though, Professor, that you'll have to show me before I trust\r\nyou with a gun. You shoot too straight--from cover.\"\r\n\r\nThe flash of anger in the Russian's eyes turned to a cold\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\"You say always just what is in your mind, Lieutenant O'Keefe,\" he\r\nmused. \"Da--that I shall remember!\" Later I was to recall this odd\r\nobservation--and Marakinoff was to remember indeed.\r\n\r\nIn single file, O'Keefe at the head and Olaf bringing up the rear, we\r\npassed through the portal. Before us dropped a circular shaft, into\r\nwhich the light from the chamber of the oval streamed liquidly; set in\r\nits sides the steps spiralled, and down them we went, cautiously. The\r\nstairway ended in a circular well; silent--with no trace of exit! The\r\nrounded stones joined each other evenly--hermetically. Carved on one\r\nof the slabs was one of the five flowered vines. I pressed my fingers\r\nupon the calyxes, even as Larry had within the Moon Chamber.\r\n\r\nA crack--horizontal, four feet wide--appeared on the wall; widened,\r\nand as the sinking slab that made it dropped to the level of our eyes,\r\nwe looked through a hundred-feet-long rift in the living rock! The\r\nstone fell steadily--and we saw that it was a Cyclopean wedge set\r\nwithin the slit of the passageway. It reached the level of our feet\r\nand stopped. At the far end of this tunnel, whose floor was the\r\npolished rock that had, a moment before, fitted hermetically into its\r\nroof, was a low, narrow triangular opening through which light\r\nstreamed.\r\n\r\n\"Nowhere to go but out!\" grinned Larry.  \"And I'll bet Golden Eyes is\r\nwaiting for us with a taxi!\" He stepped forward. We followed,\r\nslipping, sliding along the glassy surface; and I, for one, had a\r\nlively apprehension of what our fate would be should that enormous\r\nmass rise before we had emerged! We reached the end; crept out of the\r\nnarrow triangle that was its exit.\r\n\r\nWe stood upon a wide ledge carpeted with a thick yellow moss.  I\r\nlooked behind--and clutched O'Keefe's arm. The door through which we\r\nhad come had vanished! There was only a precipice of pale rock, on\r\nwhose surfaces great patches of the amber moss hung; around whose base\r\nour ledge ran, and whose summits, if summits it had, were hidden, like\r\nthe luminous cliffs, in the radiance above us.\r\n\r\n\"Nowhere to go but ahead--and Golden Eyes hasn't kept her date!\"\r\nlaughed O'Keefe--but somewhat grimly.\r\n\r\nWe walked a few yards along the ledge and, rounding a corner, faced\r\nthe end of one of the slender bridges. From this vantage point the\r\noddly shaped vehicles were plain, and we could see they were, indeed,\r\nlike the shell of the Nautilus and elfinly beautiful. Their drivers\r\nsat high upon the forward whorl. Their bodies were piled high with\r\ncushions, upon which lay women half-swathed in gay silken webs. From\r\nthe pavilioned gardens smaller channels of glistening green ran into\r\nthe broad way, much as automobile runways do on earth; and in and out\r\nof them flashed the fairy shells.\r\n\r\nThere came a shout from one.  Its occupants had glimpsed us. They\r\npointed; others stopped and stared; one shell turned and sped up a\r\nrunway--and quickly over the other side of the bridge came a score of\r\nmen. They were dwarfed--none of them more than five feet high,\r\nprodigiously broad of shoulder, clearly enormously powerful.\r\n\r\n\"Trolde!\" muttered Olaf, stepping beside O'Keefe, pistol swinging free\r\nin his hand.\r\n\r\nBut at the middle of the bridge the leader stopped, waved back his\r\nmen, and came toward us alone, palms outstretched in the immemorial,\r\nuniversal gesture of truce. He paused, scanning us with manifest\r\nwonder; we returned the scrutiny with interest. The dwarf's face was\r\nas white as Olaf's--far whiter than those of the other three of us;\r\nthe features clean-cut and noble, almost classical; the wide set eyes\r\nof a curious greenish grey and the black hair curling over his head\r\nlike that on some old Greek statue.\r\n\r\nDwarfed though he was, there was no suggestion of deformity about him.\r\nThe gigantic shoulders were covered with a loose green tunic that\r\nlooked like fine linen. It was caught in at the waist by a broad\r\ngirdle studded with what seemed to be amazonites. In it was thrust a\r\nlong curved poniard resembling the Malaysian kris. His legs were\r\nswathed in the same green cloth as the upper garment. His feet were\r\nsandalled.\r\n\r\nMy gaze returned to his face, and in it I found something subtly\r\ndisturbing; an expression of half-malicious gaiety that underlay the\r\nwholly prepossessing features like a vague threat; a mocking deviltry\r\nthat hinted at entire callousness to suffering or sorrow; something of\r\nthe spirit that was vaguely alien and disquieting.\r\n\r\nHe spoke--and, to my surprise, enough of the words were familiar to\r\nenable me clearly to catch the meaning of the whole. They were\r\nPolynesian, the Polynesian of the Samoans which is its most ancient\r\nform, but in some indefinable way--archaic. Later I was to know that\r\nthe tongue bore the same relation to the Polynesian of today as does\r\n_not_ that of Chaucer, but of the Venerable Bede, to modern English.\r\nNor was this to be so astonishing, when with the knowledge came the\r\ncertainty that it was from it the language we call Polynesian sprang.\r\n\r\n\"From whence do you come, strangers--and how found you your way here?\"\r\nsaid the green dwarf.\r\n\r\nI waved my hand toward the cliff behind us.  His eyes narrowed\r\nincredulously; he glanced at its drop, upon which even a mountain goat\r\ncould not have made its way, and laughed.\r\n\r\n\"We came through the rock,\" I answered his thought. \"And we come in\r\npeace,\" I added.\r\n\r\n\"And may peace walk with you,\" he said half-derisively--\"if the\r\nShining One wills it!\"\r\n\r\nHe considered us again.\r\n\r\n\"Show me, strangers, where you came through the rock,\" he commanded.\r\nWe led the way to where we had emerged from the well of the stairway.\r\n\r\n\"It was here,\" I said, tapping the cliff.\r\n\r\n\"But I see no opening,\" he said suavely.\r\n\r\n\"It closed behind us,\" I answered; and then, for the first time,\r\nrealized how incredible the explanation sounded. The derisive gleam\r\npassed through his eyes again. But he drew his poniard and gravely\r\nsounded the rock.\r\n\r\n\"You give a strange turn to our speech,\" he said.  \"It sounds\r\nstrangely, indeed--as strange as your answers.\" He looked at us\r\nquizzically. \"I wonder where you learned it! Well, all that you can\r\nexplain to the Afyo Maie.\" His head bowed and his arms swept out in a\r\nwide salaam. \"Be pleased to come with me!\" he ended abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"In peace?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"In peace,\" he replied--then slowly--\"with me at least.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come on, Doc!\" cried Larry.  \"As long as we're here let's see the\r\nsights. Allons mon vieux!\" he called gaily to the green dwarf. The\r\nlatter, understanding the spirit, if not the words, looked at O'Keefe\r\nwith a twinkle of approval; turned then to the great Norseman and\r\nscanned him with admiration; reached out and squeezed one of the\r\nimmense biceps.\r\n\r\n\"Lugur will welcome you, at least,\" he murmured as though to himself.\r\nHe stood aside and waved a hand courteously, inviting us to pass. We\r\ncrossed. At the base of the span one of the elfin shells was waiting.\r\n\r\nBeyond, scores had gathered, their occupants evidently discussing us\r\nin much excitement. The green dwarf waved us to the piles of cushions\r\nand then threw himself beside us. The vehicle started off smoothly,\r\nthe now silent throng making way, and swept down the green roadway at\r\na terrific pace and wholly without vibration, toward the\r\nseven-terraced tower.\r\n\r\nAs we flew along I tried to discover the source of the power, but I\r\ncould not--then. There was no sign of mechanism, but that the shell\r\nresponded to some form of energy was certain--the driver grasping a\r\nsmall lever which seemed to control not only our speed, but our\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nWe turned abruptly and swept up a runway through one of the gardens,\r\nand stopped softly before a pillared pavilion. I saw now that these\r\nwere much larger than I had thought. The structure to which we had\r\nbeen carried covered, I estimated, fully an acre. Oblong, with its\r\nslender, vari-coloured columns spaced regularly, its walls were like\r\nthe sliding screens of the Japanese--shoji.\r\n\r\nThe green dwarf hurried us up a flight of broad steps flanked by great\r\ncarved serpents, winged and scaled. He stamped twice upon mosaicked\r\nstones between two of the pillars, and a screen rolled aside,\r\nrevealing an immense hall scattered about with low divans on which\r\nlolled a dozen or more of the dwarfish men, dressed identically as he.\r\n\r\nThey sauntered up to us leisurely; the surprised interest in their\r\nfaces tempered by the same inhumanly gay malice that seemed to be\r\ncharacteristic of all these people we had as yet seen.\r\n\r\n\"The Afyo Maie awaits them, Rador,\" said one.\r\n\r\nThe green dwarf nodded, beckoned us, and led the way through the great\r\nhall and into a smaller chamber whose far side was covered with the\r\nopacity I had noted from the aerie of the cliff. I examined\r\nthe--blackness--with lively interest.\r\n\r\nIt had neither substance nor texture; it was not matter--and yet it\r\nsuggested solidity; an entire cessation, a complete absorption of\r\nlight; an ebon veil at once immaterial and palpable. I stretched,\r\ninvoluntarily, my hand out toward it, and felt it quickly drawn back.\r\n\r\n\"Do you seek your end so soon?\" whispered Rador.  \"But I forget--you\r\ndo not know,\" he added. \"On your life touch not the blackness, ever.\r\nIt--\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped, for abruptly in the density a portal appeared; swinging\r\nout of the shadow like a picture thrown by a lantern upon a screen.\r\nThrough it was revealed a chamber filled with a soft rosy glow. Rising\r\nfrom cushioned couches, a woman and a man regarded us, half leaning\r\nover a long, low table of what seemed polished jet, laden with flowers\r\nand unfamiliar fruits.\r\n\r\nAbout the room--that part of it, at least, that I could see--were a\r\nfew oddly shaped chairs of the same substance. On high, silvery\r\ntripods three immense globes stood, and it was from them that the rose\r\nglow emanated. At the side of the woman was a smaller globe whose\r\nroseate gleam was tempered by quivering waves of blue.\r\n\r\n\"Enter Rador with the strangers!\" a clear, sweet voice called.\r\n\r\nRador bowed deeply and stood aside, motioning us to pass.  We entered,\r\nthe green dwarf behind us, and out of the corner of my eye I saw the\r\ndoorway fade as abruptly as it had appeared and again the dense shadow\r\nfill its place.\r\n\r\n\"Come closer, strangers.  Be not afraid!\" commanded the bell-toned\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nWe approached.\r\n\r\nThe woman, sober scientist that I am, made the breath catch in my\r\nthroat. Never had I seen a woman so beautiful as was Yolara of the\r\nDweller's city--and none of so perilous a beauty. Her hair was of the\r\ncolour of the young tassels of the corn and coiled in a regal crown\r\nabove her broad, white brows; her wide eyes were of grey that could\r\nchange to a cornflower blue and in anger deepen to purple; grey or\r\nblue, they had little laughing devils within them, but when the storm\r\nof anger darkened them--they were not laughing, no! The silken webs\r\nthat half covered, half revealed her did not hide the ivory whiteness\r\nof her flesh nor the sweet curve of shoulders and breasts. But for all\r\nher amazing beauty, she was--sinister! There was cruelty about the\r\ncurving mouth, and in the music of her voice--not conscious cruelty,\r\nbut the more terrifying, careless cruelty of nature itself.\r\n\r\nThe girl of the rose wall had been beautiful, yes!  But her beauty was\r\nhuman, understandable. You could imagine her with a babe in her\r\narms--but you could not so imagine this woman. About her loveliness\r\nhovered something unearthly. A sweet feminine echo of the Dweller was\r\nYolara, the Dweller's priestess--and as gloriously, terrifyingly evil!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nThe Justice of Lora\r\n\r\nAs I looked at her the man arose and made his way round the table\r\ntoward us. For the first time my eyes took in Lugur. A few inches\r\ntaller than the green dwarf, he was far broader, more filled with the\r\nsuggestion of appalling strength.\r\n\r\nThe tremendous shoulders were four feet wide if an inch, tapering down\r\nto mighty thewed thighs. The muscles of his chest stood out beneath\r\nhis tunic of red. Around his forehead shone a chaplet of bright-blue\r\nstones, sparkling among the thick curls of his silver-ash hair.\r\n\r\nUpon his face pride and ambition were written large--and power still\r\nlarger. All the mockery, the malice, the hint of callous indifference\r\nthat I had noted in the other dwarfish men were there, too--but\r\nintensified, touched with the satanic.\r\n\r\nThe woman spoke again.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you strangers, and how came you here?\"  She turned to Rador.\r\n\"Or is it that they do not understand our tongue?\"\r\n\r\n\"One understands and speaks it--but very badly, O Yolara,\" answered\r\nthe green dwarf.\r\n\r\n\"Speak, then, that one of you,\" she commanded.\r\n\r\nBut it was Marakinoff who found his voice first, and I marvelled at\r\nthe fluency, so much greater than mine, with which he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"We came for different purposes.  I to seek knowledge of a kind;\r\nhe\"--pointing to me \"of another. This man\"--he looked at Olaf--\"to\r\nfind a wife and child.\"\r\n\r\nThe grey-blue eyes had been regarding O'Keefe steadily and with\r\nplainly increasing interest.\r\n\r\n\"And why did _you_ come?\" she asked him.  \"Nay--I would have him speak\r\nfor himself, if he can,\" she stilled Marakinoff peremptorily.\r\n\r\nWhen Larry spoke it was haltingly, in the tongue that was strange to\r\nhim, searching for the proper words.\r\n\r\n\"I came to help these men--and because something I could not then\r\nunderstand called me, O lady, whose eyes are like forest pools at\r\ndawn,\" he answered; and even in the unfamiliar words there was a touch\r\nof the Irish brogue, and little merry lights danced in the eyes Larry\r\nhad so apostrophized.\r\n\r\n\"I could find fault with your speech, but none with its burden,\" she\r\nsaid. \"What forest pools are I know not, and the dawn has not shone\r\nupon the people of Lora these many sais of laya.[1] But I sense what you\r\nmean!\"\r\n\r\nThe eyes deepened to blue as she regarded him.  She smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Are there many like you in the world from which you come?\" she asked\r\nsoftly. \"Well, we soon shall--\"\r\n\r\nLugur interrupted her almost rudely and glowering.\r\n\r\n\"Best we should know how they came hence,\" he growled.\r\n\r\nShe darted a quick look at him, and again the little devils danced in\r\nher wondrous eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Unquestionably there is a subtle difference between time as we know it\r\nand time in this subterranean land--its progress there being slower.\r\nThis, however, is only in accord with the well-known doctrine of\r\nrelativity, which predicates both space and time as necessary\r\ninventions of the human mind to orient itself to the conditions under\r\nwhich it finds itself. I tried often to measure this difference, but\r\ncould never do so to my entire satisfaction. The closest I can come to\r\nit is to say that an hour of our time is the equivalent of an hour and\r\nfive-eighths in Muria. For further information upon this matter of\r\nrelativity the reader may consult any of the numerous books upon the\r\nsubject.--W. T. G.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is true,\" she said.  \"How came you here?\"\r\n\r\nAgain it was Marakinoff who answered--slowly, considering every word.\r\n\r\n\"In the world above,\" he said, \"there are ruins of cities not built by\r\nany of those who now dwell there. To us these places called, and we\r\nsought for knowledge of the wise ones who made them. We found a\r\npassageway. The way led us downward to a door in yonder cliff, and\r\nthrough it we came here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then have you found what you sought?\" spoke she.  \"For we are of\r\nthose who built the cities. But this gateway in the rock--where is\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"After we passed, it closed upon us; nor could we after find trace of\r\nit,\" answered Marakinoff.\r\n\r\nThe incredulity that had shown upon the face of the green dwarf fell\r\nupon theirs; on Lugur's it was clouded with furious anger.\r\n\r\nHe turned to Rador.\r\n\r\n\"I could find no opening, lord,\" said the green dwarf quickly.\r\n\r\nAnd there was so fierce a fire in the eyes of Lugur as he swung back\r\nupon us that O'Keefe's hand slipped stealthily down toward his pistol.\r\n\r\n\"Best it is to speak truth to Yolara, priestess of the Shining One,\r\nand to Lugur, the Voice,\" he cried menacingly.\r\n\r\n\"It is the truth,\" I interposed.  \"We came down the passage.  At its\r\nend was a carved vine, a vine of five flowers\"--the fire died from the\r\nred dwarf's eyes, and I could have sworn to a swift pallor. \"I rested\r\na hand upon these flowers, and a door opened. But when we had gone\r\nthrough it and turned, behind us was nothing but unbroken cliff. The\r\ndoor had vanished.\"\r\n\r\nI had taken my cue from Marakinoff.  If he had eliminated the episode\r\nof car and Moon Pool, he had good reason, I had no doubt; and I would\r\nbe as cautious. And deep within me something cautioned me to say\r\nnothing of my quest; to stifle all thought of Throckmartin--something\r\nthat warned, peremptorily, finally, as though it were a message from\r\nThrockmartin himself!\r\n\r\n\"A vine with five flowers!\" exclaimed the red dwarf.  \"Was it like\r\nthis, say?\"\r\n\r\nHe thrust forward a long arm.  Upon the thumb of the hand was an\r\nimmense ring, set with a dull-blue stone. Graven on the face of the\r\njewel was the symbol of the rosy walls of the Moon Chamber that had\r\nopened to us their two portals. But cut over the vine were seven\r\ncircles, one about each of the flowers and two larger ones covering,\r\nintersecting them.\r\n\r\n\"This is the same,\" I said; \"but these were not there\"--I indicated\r\nthe circles.\r\n\r\nThe woman drew a deep breath and looked deep into Lugur's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"The sign of the Silent Ones!\" he half whispered.\r\n\r\nIt was the woman who first recovered herself.\r\n\r\n\"The strangers are weary, Lugur,\" she said.  \"When they are rested\r\nthey shall show where the rocks opened.\"\r\n\r\nI sensed a subtle change in their attitude toward us; a new\r\nintentness; a doubt plainly tinged with apprehension. What was it they\r\nfeared? Why had the symbol of the vine wrought the change? And who or\r\nwhat were the Silent Ones?\r\n\r\nYolara's eyes turned to Olaf, hardened, and grew cold grey.\r\nSubconsciously I had noticed that from the first the Norseman had been\r\nabsorbed in his regard of the pair; had, indeed, never taken his gaze\r\nfrom them; had noticed, too, the priestess dart swift glances toward\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe returned her scrutiny fearlessly, a touch of contempt in the clear\r\neyes--like a child watching a snake which he did not dread, but whose\r\ndanger be well knew.\r\n\r\nUnder that look Yolara stirred impatiently, sensing, I know, its\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you look at me so?\" she cried.\r\n\r\nAn expression of bewilderment passed over Olaf's face.\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand,\" he said in English.\r\n\r\nI caught a quickly repressed gleam in O'Keefe's eyes.  He knew, as I\r\nknew, that Olaf must have understood. But did Marakinoff?\r\n\r\nApparently he did not.  But why was Olaf feigning ignorance?\r\n\r\n\"This man is a sailor from what we call the North,\" thus Larry\r\nhaltingly. \"He is crazed, I think. He tells a strange tale of a\r\nsomething of cold fire that took his wife and babe. We found him\r\nwandering where we were. And because he is strong we brought him with\r\nus. That is all, O lady, whose voice is sweeter than the honey of the\r\nwild bees!\"\r\n\r\n\"A shape of cold fire?\" she repeated.\r\n\r\n\"A shape of cold fire that whirled beneath the moon, with the sound of\r\nlittle bells,\" answered Larry, watching her intently.\r\n\r\nShe looked at Lugur and laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Then he, too, is fortunate,\" she said.  \"For he has come to the place\r\nof his something of cold fire--and tell him that he shall join his\r\nwife and child, in time; that I promise him.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the Norseman's face there was no hint of comprehension, and at\r\nthat moment I formed an entirely new opinion of Olaf's intelligence;\r\nfor certainly it must have been a prodigious effort of the will,\r\nindeed, that enabled him, understanding, to control himself.\r\n\r\n\"What does she say?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nLarry repeated.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" said Olaf.  \"Good!\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at Yolara with well-assumed gratitude.  Lugur, who had been\r\nscanning his bulk, drew close. He felt the giant muscles which\r\nHuldricksson accommodatingly flexed for him.\r\n\r\n\"But he shall meet Valdor and Tahola before he sees those kin of his,\"\r\nhe laughed mockingly. \"And if he bests them--for reward--his wife and\r\nbabe!\"\r\n\r\nA shudder, quickly repressed, shook the seaman's frame. The woman bent\r\nher supremely beautiful head.\r\n\r\n\"These two,\" she said, pointing to the Russian and to me, \"seem to be\r\nmen of learning. They may be useful. As for this man,\"--she smiled at\r\nLarry--\"I would have him explain to me some things.\" She hesitated.\r\n\"What 'hon-ey of 'e wild bees-s' is.\" Larry had spoken the words in\r\nEnglish, and she was trying to repeat them. \"As for this man, the\r\nsailor, do as you please with him, Lugur; always remembering that I\r\nhave given my word that he shall join that wife and babe of his!\" She\r\nlaughed sweetly, sinisterly. \"And now--take them, Rador--give them\r\nfood and drink and let them rest till we shall call them again.\"\r\n\r\nShe stretched out a hand toward O'Keefe.  The Irishman bowed low over\r\nit, raised it softly to his lips. There was a vicious hiss from Lugur;\r\nbut Yolara regarded Larry with eyes now all tender blue.\r\n\r\n\"You please me,\" she whispered.\r\n\r\nAnd the face of Lugur grew darker.\r\n\r\nWe turned to go.  The rosy, azure-shot globe at her side suddenly\r\ndulled. From it came a faint bell sound as of chimes far away. She\r\nbent over it. It vibrated, and then its surface ran with little waves\r\nof dull colour; from it came a whispering so low that I could not\r\ndistinguish the words--if words they were.\r\n\r\nShe spoke to the red dwarf.\r\n\r\n\"They have brought the three who blasphemed the Shining One,\" she said\r\nslowly. \"Now it is in my mind to show these strangers the justice of\r\nLora. What say you, Lugur?\"\r\n\r\nThe red dwarf nodded, his eyes sparkling with a malicious\r\nanticipation.\r\n\r\nThe woman spoke again to the globe.  \"Bring them here!\"\r\n\r\nAnd again it ran swiftly with its film of colours, darkened, and shone\r\nrosy once more. From without there came a rustle of many feet upon the\r\nrugs. Yolara pressed a slender hand upon the base of the pedestal of\r\nthe globe beside her. Abruptly the light faded from all, and on the\r\nsame instant the four walls of blackness vanished, revealing on two\r\nsides the lovely, unfamiliar garden through the guarding rows of\r\npillars; at our backs soft draperies hid what lay beyond; before us,\r\nflanked by flowered screens, was the corridor through which we had\r\nentered, crowded now by the green dwarfs of the great hall.\r\n\r\nThe dwarfs advanced.  Each, I now noted, had the same clustering black\r\nhair of Rador. They separated, and from them stepped three figures--a\r\nyouth of not more than twenty, short, but with the great shoulders of\r\nall the males we had seen of this race; a girl of seventeen, I judged,\r\nwhite-faced, a head taller than the boy, her long, black hair\r\ndishevelled; and behind these two a stunted, gnarled shape whose head\r\nwas sunk deep between the enormous shoulders, whose white beard fell\r\nlike that of some ancient gnome down to his waist, and whose eyes were\r\na white flame of hate. The girl cast herself weeping at the feet of\r\nthe priestess; the youth regarded her curiously.\r\n\r\n\"You are Songar of the Lower Waters?\" murmured Yolara almost\r\ncaressingly. \"And this is your daughter and her lover?\"\r\n\r\nThe gnome nodded, the flame in his eyes leaping higher.\r\n\r\n\"It has come to me that you three have dared blaspheme the Shining\r\nOne, its priestess, and its Voice,\" went on Yolara smoothly. \"Also\r\nthat you have called out to the three Silent Ones. Is it true?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your spies have spoken--and have you not already judged us?\" The\r\nvoice of the old dwarf was bitter.\r\n\r\nA flicker shot through the eyes of Yolara, again cold grey. The girl\r\nreached a trembling hand out to the hem of the priestess's veils.\r\n\r\n\"Tell us why you did these things, Songar,\" she said.  \"Why you did\r\nthem, knowing full well what your--reward--would be.\"\r\n\r\nThe dwarf stiffened; he raised his withered arms, and his eyes blazed.\r\n\r\n\"Because evil are your thoughts and evil are your deeds,\" he cried.\r\n\"Yours and your lover's, there\"--he levelled a finger at Lugur.\r\n\"Because of the Shining One you have made evil, too, and the greater\r\nwickedness you contemplate--you and he with the Shining One. But I\r\ntell you that your measure of iniquity is full; the tale of your sin\r\nnear ended! Yea--the Silent Ones have been patient, but soon they will\r\nspeak.\" He pointed at us. \"A sign are _they_--a warning--harlot!\" He\r\nspat the word.\r\n\r\nIn Yolara's eyes, grown black, the devils leaped unrestrained.\r\n\r\n\"Is it even so, Songar?\" her voice caressed.  \"Now ask the Silent Ones\r\nto help you! They sit afar--but surely they will hear you.\" The sweet\r\nvoice was mocking. \"As for these two, they shall pray to the Shining\r\nOne for forgiveness--and surely the Shining One will take them to its\r\nbosom! As for you--you have lived long enough, Songar! Pray to the\r\nSilent Ones, Songar, and pass out into the nothingness--you!\"\r\n\r\nShe dipped down into her bosom and drew forth something that resembled\r\na small cone of tarnished silver. She levelled it, a covering clicked\r\nfrom its base, and out of it darted a slender ray of intense green\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nIt struck the old dwarf squarely over the heart, and spread swift as\r\nlight itself, covering him with a gleaming, pale film. She clenched\r\nher hand upon the cone, and the ray disappeared. She thrust the cone\r\nback into her breast and leaned forward expectantly; so Lugur and so\r\nthe other dwarfs. From the girl came a low wail of anguish; the boy\r\ndropped upon his knees, covering his face.\r\n\r\nFor the moment the white beard stood rigid; then the robe that had\r\ncovered him seemed to melt away, revealing all the knotted, monstrous\r\nbody. And in that body a vibration began, increasing to incredible\r\nrapidity. It wavered before us like a reflection in a still pond\r\nstirred by a sudden wind. It grew and grew--to a rhythm whose rapidity\r\nwas intolerable to watch and that still chained the eyes.\r\n\r\nThe figure grew indistinct, misty.  Tiny sparks in infinite numbers\r\nleaped from it--like, I thought, the radiant shower of particles\r\nhurled out by radium when seen under the microscope. Mistier still it\r\ngrew--there trembled before us for a moment a faintly luminous shadow\r\nwhich held, here and there, tiny sparkling atoms like those that\r\npulsed in the light about us! The glowing shadow vanished, the\r\nsparkling atoms were still for a moment--and shot away, joining those\r\ndancing others.\r\n\r\nWhere the gnomelike form had been but a few seconds before--there was\r\nnothing!\r\n\r\nO'Keefe drew a long breath, and I was sensible of a prickling along my\r\nscalp.\r\n\r\nYolara leaned toward us.\r\n\r\n\"You have seen,\" she said.  Her eyes lingered tigerishly upon Olaf's\r\npallid face. \"Heed!\" she whispered. She turned to the men in green,\r\nwho were laughing softly among themselves.\r\n\r\n\"Take these two, and go!\" she commanded.\r\n\r\n\"The justice of Lora,\" said the red dwarf.  \"The justice of Lora and\r\nthe Shining One under Thanaroa!\"\r\n\r\nUpon the utterance of the last word I saw Marakinoff start violently.\r\nThe hand at his side made a swift, surreptitious gesture, so fleeting\r\nthat I hardly caught it. The red dwarf stared at the Russian, and\r\nthere was amazement upon his face.\r\n\r\nSwiftly as Marakinoff, he returned it.\r\n\r\n\"Yolara,\" the red dwarf spoke, \"it would please me to take this man of\r\nwisdom to my own place for a time. The giant I would have, too.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman awoke from her brooding; nodded.\r\n\r\n\"As you will, Lugur,\" she said.\r\n\r\nAnd as, shaken to the core, we passed out into the garden into the\r\nfull throbbing of the light, I wondered if all the tiny sparkling\r\ndiamond points that shook about us had once been men like Songar of\r\nthe Lower Waters--and felt my very soul grow sick!\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Later I was to find that Murian reckoning rested upon the\r\nextraordinary increased luminosity of the cliffs at the time of full\r\nmoon on earth--this action, to my mind, being linked either with the\r\neffect of the light streaming globes upon the Moon Pool, whose source\r\nwas in the shining cliffs, or else upon some mysterious affinity of\r\ntheir radiant element with the flood of moonlight on earth--the\r\nlatter, most probably, because even when the moon must have been\r\nclouded above, it made no difference in the phenomenon. Thirteen of\r\nthese shinings forth constituted a laya, one of them a lat. Ten was\r\nsa; ten times ten times ten a said, or thousand; ten times a thousand\r\nwas a sais. A sais of laya was then literally ten thousand years. What\r\nwe would call an hour was by them called a va. The whole time system\r\nwas, of course, a mingling of time as it had been known to their\r\nremote, surface-dwelling ancestors, and the peculiar determining\r\nfactors in the vast cavern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nThe Angry, Whispering Globe\r\n\r\nOur way led along a winding path between banked masses of softly\r\nradiant blooms, groups of feathery ferns whose plumes were starred\r\nwith fragrant white and blue flowerets, slender creepers swinging from\r\nthe branches of the strangely trunked trees, bearing along their\r\nthreads orchid-like blossoms both delicately frail and gorgeously\r\nflamboyant.\r\n\r\nThe path we trod was an exquisite mosaic--pastel greens and pinks upon\r\na soft grey base, garlands of nimbused forms like the flaming rose of\r\nthe Rosicrucians held in the mouths of the flying serpents. A smaller\r\npavilion arose before us, single-storied, front wide open.\r\n\r\nUpon its threshold Rador paused, bowed deeply, and motioned us within.\r\nThe chamber we entered was large, closed on two sides by screens of\r\ngrey; at the back gay, concealing curtains. The low table of blue\r\nstone, dressed with fine white cloths, stretched at one side flanked\r\nby the cushioned divans.\r\n\r\nAt the left was a high tripod bearing one of the rosy globes we had\r\nseen in the house of Yolara; at the head of the table a smaller globe\r\nsimilar to the whispering one. Rador pressed upon its base, and two\r\nother screens slid into place across the entrance, shutting in the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nHe clapped his hands; the curtains parted, and two girls came through\r\nthem. Tall and willow lithe, their bluish-black hair falling in\r\nringlets just below their white shoulders, their clear eyes of\r\nforget-me-not blue, and skins of extraordinary fineness and\r\npurity--they were singularly attractive. Each was clad in an extremely\r\nscanty bodice of silken blue, girdled above a kirtle that came barely\r\nto their very pretty knees.\r\n\r\n\"Food and drink,\" ordered Rador.\r\n\r\nThey dropped back through the curtains.\r\n\r\n\"Do you like them?\" he asked us.\r\n\r\n\"Some chickens!\" said Larry.  \"They delight the heart,\" he translated\r\nfor Rador.\r\n\r\nThe green dwarf's next remark made me gasp.\r\n\r\n\"They are yours,\" he said.\r\n\r\nBefore I could question him further upon this extraordinary statement\r\nthe pair re-entered, bearing a great platter on which were small\r\nloaves, strange fruits, and three immense flagons of rock crystal--two\r\nfilled with a slightly sparkling yellow liquid and the third with a\r\npurplish drink. I became acutely sensible that it had been hours since\r\nI had either eaten or drunk. The yellow flagons were set before Larry\r\nand me, the purple at Rador's hand.\r\n\r\nThe girls, at his signal, again withdrew.  I raised my glass to my\r\nlips and took a deep draft. The taste was unfamiliar but delightful.\r\n\r\nAlmost at once my fatigue disappeared.  I realized a clarity of mind,\r\nan interesting exhilaration and sense of irresponsibility, of freedom\r\nfrom care, that were oddly enjoyable. Larry became immediately his old\r\ngay self.\r\n\r\nThe green dwarf regarded us whimsically, sipping from his great flagon\r\nof rock crystal.\r\n\r\n\"Much do I desire to know of that world you came from,\" he said at\r\nlast--\"through the rocks,\" he added, slyly.\r\n\r\n\"And much do we desire to know of this world of yours, O Rador,\" I\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nShould I ask him of the Dweller; seek from him a clue to Throckmartin?\r\nAgain, clearly as a spoken command, came the warning to forbear, to\r\nwait. And once more I obeyed.\r\n\r\n\"Let us learn, then, from each other.\" The dwarf was laughing.  \"And\r\nfirst--are all above like you--drawn out\"--he made an expressive\r\ngesture--\"and are there many of you?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are--\" I hesitated, and at last spoke the Polynesian that means\r\ntens upon tens multiplied indefinitely--\"there are as many as the\r\ndrops of water in the lake we saw from the ledge where you found us,\"\r\nI continued; \"many as the leaves on the trees without. And they are\r\nall like us--varyingly.\"\r\n\r\nHe considered skeptically, I could see, my remark upon our numbers.\r\n\r\n\"In Muria,\" he said at last, \"the men are like me or like Lugur.  Our\r\nwomen are as you see them--like Yolara or those two who served you.\"\r\nHe hesitated. \"And there is a third; but only one.\"\r\n\r\nLarry leaned forward eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Brown-haired with glints of ruddy bronze, golden-eyed, and lovely as\r\na dream, with long, slender, beautiful hands?\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"Where saw you _her_?\" interrupted the dwarf, starting to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Saw her?\" Larry recovered himself.  \"Nay, Rador, perhaps, I only\r\ndreamed that there was such a woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"See to it, then, that you tell not your dream to Yolara,\" said the\r\ndwarf grimly. \"For her I meant and her you have pictured is Lakla, the\r\nhand-maiden to the Silent Ones, and neither Yolara nor Lugur, nay, nor\r\nthe Shining One, love her overmuch, stranger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does she dwell here?\" Larry's face was alight.\r\n\r\nThe dwarf hesitated, glanced about him anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Nay,\" he answered, \"ask me no more of her.\" He was silent for a\r\nspace. \"And what do you who are as leaves or drops of water do in that\r\nworld of yours?\" he said, plainly bent on turning the subject.\r\n\r\n\"Keep off the golden-eyed girl, Larry,\" I interjected.  \"Wait till we\r\nfind out why she's tabu.\"\r\n\r\n\"Love and battle, strive and accomplish and die; or fail and die,\"\r\nanswered Larry--to Rador--giving me a quick nod of acquiescence to my\r\nwarning in English.\r\n\r\n\"In that at least your world and mine differ little,\" said the dwarf.\r\n\r\n\"How great is this world of yours, Rador?\" I spoke.\r\n\r\nHe considered me gravely.\r\n\r\n\"How great indeed I do not know,\" he said frankly at last. \"The land\r\nwhere we dwell with the Shining One stretches along the white waters\r\nfor--\" He used a phrase of which I could make nothing. \"Beyond this\r\ncity of the Shining One and on the hither shores of the white waters\r\ndwell the mayia ladala--the common ones.\" He took a deep draft from\r\nhis flagon. \"There are, first, the fair-haired ones, the children of\r\nthe ancient rulers,\" he continued. \"There are, second, we the\r\nsoldiers; and last, the mayia ladala, who dig and till and weave and\r\ntoil and give our rulers and us their daughters, and dance with the\r\nShining One!\" he added.\r\n\r\n\"Who rules?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"The fair-haired, under the Council of Nine, who are under Yolara, the\r\nPriestess and Lugur, the Voice,\" he answered, \"who are in turn beneath\r\nthe Shining One!\" There was a ring of bitter satire in the last.\r\n\r\n\"And those three who were judged?\"--this from Larry.\r\n\r\n\"They were of the mayia ladala,\" he replied, \"like those two I gave\r\nyou. But they grow restless. They do not like to dance with the\r\nShining One--the blasphemers!\" He raised his voice in a sudden great\r\nshout of mocking laughter.\r\n\r\nIn his words I caught a fleeting picture of the race--an ancient,\r\nluxurious, close-bred oligarchy clustered about some mysterious deity;\r\na soldier class that supported them; and underneath all the toiling,\r\noppressed hordes.\r\n\r\n\"And is that all?\" asked Larry.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he answered.  \"There is the Sea of Crimson where--\"\r\n\r\nWithout warning the globe beside us sent out a vicious note, Rador\r\nturned toward it, his face paling. Its surface crawled with\r\nwhisperings--angry, peremptory!\r\n\r\n\"I hear!\" he croaked, gripping the table.  \"I obey!\"\r\n\r\nHe turned to us a face devoid for once of its malice.\r\n\r\n\"Ask me no more questions, strangers,\" he said.  \"And now, if you are\r\ndone, I will show you where you may sleep and bathe.\"\r\n\r\nHe arose abruptly.  We followed him through the hangings, passed\r\nthrough a corridor and into another smaller chamber, roofless, the\r\nsides walled with screens of dark grey. Two cushioned couches were\r\nthere and a curtained door leading into an open, outer enclosure in\r\nwhich a fountain played within a wide pool.\r\n\r\n\"Your bath,\" said Rador.  He dropped the curtain and came back into\r\nthe room. He touched a carved flower at one side. There was a tiny\r\nsighing from overhead and instantly across the top spread a veil of\r\nblackness, impenetrable to light but certainly not to air, for through\r\nit pulsed little breaths of the garden fragrances. The room filled\r\nwith a cool twilight, refreshing, sleep-inducing. The green dwarf\r\npointed to the couches.\r\n\r\n\"Sleep!\" he said.  \"Sleep and fear nothing.  My men are on guard\r\noutside.\" He came closer to us, the old mocking gaiety sparkling in\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n\"But I spoke too quickly,\" he whispered.  \"Whether it is because the\r\nAfyo Maie fears their tongues--or--\" he laughed at Larry. \"The maids\r\nare _not_ yours!\" Still laughing he vanished through the curtains of the\r\nroom of the fountain before I could ask him the meaning of his curious\r\ngift, its withdrawal, and his most enigmatic closing remarks.\r\n\r\n\"Back in the great old days of Ireland,\" thus Larry breaking into my\r\nthoughts raptly, the brogue thick, \"there was Cairill mac\r\nCairill--Cairill Swiftspear. An' Cairill wronged Keevan of Emhain\r\nAbhlach, of the blood of Angus of the great people when he was\r\nsleeping in the likeness of a pale reed. Then Keevan put this penance\r\non Cairill--that for a year Cairill should wear his body in Emhain\r\nAbhlach, which is the Land of Faery and for that year Keevan should\r\nwear the body of Cairill. And it was done.\r\n\r\n\"In that year Cairill met Emar of the Birds that are one white, one\r\nred, and one black--and they loved, and from that love sprang Ailill\r\ntheir son. And when Ailill was born he took a reed flute and first he\r\nplayed slumber on Cairill, and then he played old age so that Cairill\r\ngrew white and withered; then Ailill played again and Cairill became a\r\nshadow--then a shadow of a shadow--then a breath; and the breath went\r\nout upon the wind!\" He shivered. \"Like the old gnome,\" he whispered,\r\n\"that they called Songar of the Lower Waters!\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head as though he cast a dream from him. Then, all\r\nalert--\r\n\r\n\"But that was in Iceland ages agone.  And there's nothing like that\r\nhere, Doc!\" He laughed. \"It doesn't scare me one little bit, old boy.\r\nThe pretty devil lady's got the wrong slant. When you've had a pal\r\nstanding beside you one moment--full of life, and joy, and power, and\r\npotentialities, telling what he's going to do to make the world hum\r\nwhen he gets through the slaughter, just running over with zip and pep\r\nof life, Doc--and the next instant, right in the middle of a laugh--a\r\npiece of damned shell takes off half his head and with it joy and\r\npower and all the rest of it\"--his face twitched--\"well, old man, in\r\nthe face of _that_ mystery a disappearing act such as the devil lady\r\ntreated us to doesn't make much of a dent. Not on me. But by the\r\nbrogans of Brian Boru--if we could have had some of that stuff to turn\r\non during the war--oh, boy!\"\r\n\r\nHe was silent, evidently contemplating the idea with vast pleasure.\r\nAnd as for me, at that moment my last doubt of Larry O'Keefe vanished,\r\nI saw that he did believe, really believed, in his banshees, his\r\nleprechauns and all the old dreams of the Gael--but only within the\r\nlimits of Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn one drawer of his mind was packed all his superstition, his\r\nmysticism, and what of weakness it might carry. But face him with any\r\nperil or problem and the drawer closed instantaneously leaving a mind\r\nthat was utterly fearless, incredulous, and ingenious; swept clean of\r\nall cobwebs by as fine a skeptic broom as ever brushed a brain.\r\n\r\n\"Some stuff!\" Deepest admiration was in his voice.  \"If we'd only had\r\nit when the war was on--imagine half a dozen of us scooting over the\r\nenemy batteries and the gunners underneath all at once beginning to\r\nshake themselves to pieces! Wow!\" His tone was rapturous.\r\n\r\n\"It's easy enough to explain, Larry,\" I said.  \"The effect, that\r\nis--for what the green ray is made of I don't know, of course. But\r\nwhat it does, clearly, is stimulate atomic vibration to such a pitch\r\nthat the cohesion between the particles of matter is broken and the\r\nbody flies to bits--just as a fly-wheel does when its speed gets so\r\ngreat that the particles of which _it_ is made can't hold together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shake themselves to pieces is right, then!\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely right,\" I nodded.  \"Everything in Nature vibrates.  And\r\nall matter--whether man or beast or stone or metal or vegetable--is\r\nmade up of vibrating molecules, which are made up of vibrating atoms\r\nwhich are made up of truly infinitely small particles of electricity\r\ncalled electrons, and electrons, the base of all matter, are\r\nthemselves perhaps only a vibration of the mysterious ether.\r\n\r\n\"If a magnifying glass of sufficient size and strength could be placed\r\nover us we could see ourselves as sieves--our space lattice, as it is\r\ncalled. And all that is necessary to break down the lattice, to shake\r\nus into nothingness, is some agent that will set our atoms vibrating\r\nat such a rate that at last they escape the unseen cords and fly off.\r\n\r\n\"The green ray of Yolara is such an agent.  It set up in the dwarf\r\nthat incredibly rapid rhythm that you saw and--shook him not to\r\natoms--but to electrons!\"\r\n\r\n\"They had a gun on the West Front--a seventy-five,\" said O'Keefe,\r\n\"that broke the eardrums of everybody who fired it, no matter what\r\nprotection they used. It looked like all the other seventy-fives--but\r\nthere was something about its sound that did it. They had to recast\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's practically the same thing,\" I replied.  \"By some freak its\r\nvibratory qualities had that effect. The deep whistle of the sunken\r\nLusitania would, for instance, make the Singer Building shake to its\r\nfoundations; while the Olympic did not affect the Singer at all but\r\nmade the Woolworth shiver all through. In each case they stimulated\r\nthe atomic vibration of the particular building--\"\r\n\r\nI paused, aware all at once of an intense drowsiness. O'Keefe,\r\nyawning, reached down to unfasten his puttees.\r\n\r\n\"Lord, I'm sleepy!\" he exclaimed.  \"Can't understand it--what you\r\nsay--most--interesting--Lord!\" he yawned again; straightened. \"What\r\nmade Reddy take such a shine to the Russian?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Thanaroa,\" I answered, fighting to keep my eyes open.\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"When Lugur spoke that name I saw Marakinoff signal him.  Thanaroa is,\r\nI suspect, the original form of the name of Tangaroa, the greatest god\r\nof the Polynesians. There's a secret cult to him in the islands.\r\nMarakinoff may belong to it--he knows it anyway. Lugur recognized the\r\nsignal and despite his surprise answered it.\"\r\n\r\n\"So he gave him the high sign, eh?\" mused Larry.  \"How could they both\r\nknow it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The cult is a very ancient one.  Undoubtedly it had its origin in the\r\ndim beginnings before these people migrated here,\" I replied. \"It's a\r\nlink--one--of the few links between up there and the lost past--\"\r\n\r\n\"Trouble then,\" mumbled Larry.  \"Hell brewing!  I smell it--Say, Doc,\r\nis this sleepiness natural? Wonder where my--gas mask--is--\" he\r\nadded, half incoherently.\r\n\r\nBut I myself was struggling desperately against the drugged slumber\r\npressing down upon me.\r\n\r\n\"Lakla!\" I heard O'Keefe murmur.  \"Lakla of the golden eyes--no\r\nEilidh--the Fair!\" He made an immense effort, half raised himself,\r\ngrinned faintly.\r\n\r\n\"Thought this was paradise when I first saw it, Doc,\" he sighed.  \"But\r\nI know now, if it is, No-Man's Land was the greatest place on earth\r\nfor a honeymoon. They--they've got us, Doc--\" He sank back. \"Good\r\nluck, old boy, wherever you're going.\" His hand waved feebly.\r\n\"Glad--knew--you. Hope--see--you--'gain--\"\r\n\r\nHis voice trailed into silence.  Fighting, fighting with every fibre\r\nof brain and nerve against the sleep, I felt myself being steadily\r\novercome. Yet before oblivion rushed down upon me I seemed to see upon\r\nthe grey-screened wall nearest the Irishman an oval of rosy light\r\nbegin to glow; watched, as my falling lids inexorably fell, a\r\nflame-tipped shadow waver on it; thicken; condense--and there looking\r\ndown upon Larry, her eyes great golden stars in which intensest\r\ncuriosity and shy tenderness struggled, sweet mouth half smiling, was\r\nthe girl of the Moon Pool's Chamber, the girl whom the green dwarf had\r\nnamed--Lakla: the vision Larry had invoked before that sleep which I\r\ncould no longer deny had claimed him--\r\n\r\nCloser she came--closer---the eyes were over us.\r\n\r\nThen oblivion indeed!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nYolara of Muria vs. the O'Keefe\r\n\r\nI awakened with all the familiar, homely sensation of a shade having\r\nbeen pulled up in a darkened room. I thrilled with a wonderful sense\r\nof deep rest and restored resiliency. The ebon shadow had vanished\r\nfrom above and down into the room was pouring the silvery light. From\r\nthe fountain pool came a mighty splashing and shouts of laughter. I\r\njumped and drew the curtain. O'Keefe and Rador were swimming a wild\r\nrace; the dwarf like an otter, out-distancing and playing around the\r\nIrishman at will.\r\n\r\nHad that overpowering sleep--and now I confess that my struggle\r\nagainst it had been largely inspired by fear that it was the abnormal\r\nslumber which Throckmartin had described as having heralded the\r\napproach of the Dweller before it had carried away Thora and\r\nStanton--had that sleep been after all nothing but natural reaction of\r\ntired nerves and brains?\r\n\r\nAnd that last vision of the golden-eyed girl bending over Larry?  Had\r\nthat also been a delusion of an overstressed mind? Well, it might have\r\nbeen, I could not tell. At any rate, I decided, I would speak about it\r\nto O'Keefe once we were alone again--and then giving myself up to the\r\nurge of buoyant well-being I shouted like a boy, stripped and joined\r\nthe two in the pool. The water was warm and I felt the unwonted\r\ntingling of life in every vein increase; something from it seemed to\r\npulse through the skin, carrying a clean vigorous vitality that toned\r\nevery fibre. Tiring at last, we swam to the edge and drew ourselves\r\nout. The green dwarf quickly clothed himself and Larry rather\r\ncarefully donned his uniform.\r\n\r\n\"The Afyo Maie has summoned us, Doc,\" he said.  \"We're to--well--I\r\nsuppose you'd call it breakfast with her. After that, Rador tells me,\r\nwe're to have a session with the Council of Nine. I suppose Yolara is\r\nas curious as any lady of--the upper world, as you might put it--and\r\njust naturally can't wait,\" he added.\r\n\r\nHe gave himself a last shake, patted the automatic hidden under his\r\nleft arm, whistled cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\"After you, my dear Alphonse,\" he said to Rador, with a low bow.  The\r\ndwarf laughed, bent in an absurd imitation of Larry's mocking courtesy\r\nand started ahead of us to the house of the priestess. When he had\r\ngone a little way on the orchid-walled path I whispered to O'Keefe:\r\n\r\n\"Larry, when you were falling off to sleep--did you think you saw\r\nanything?\"\r\n\r\n\"See anything!\" he grinned.  \"Doc, sleep hit me like a Hun shell.  I\r\nthought they were pulling the gas on us. I--I had some intention of\r\nbidding you tender farewells,\" he continued, half sheepishly. \"I think\r\nI did start 'em, didn't I?\"\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n\"But wait a minute--\" he hesitated.  \"I had a queer sort of dream--\"\r\n\r\n\"'What was it?\" I asked eagerly,\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he answered slowly, \"I suppose it was because I'd been\r\nthinking of--Golden Eyes. Anyway, I thought she came through the wall\r\nand leaned over me--yes, and put one of those long white hands of hers\r\non my head--I couldn't raise my lids--but in some queer way I could\r\nsee her. Then it got real dreamish. Why do you ask?\"\r\n\r\nRador turned back toward us,\r\n\r\n\"Later,\" I answered, \"Not now.  When we're alone.\"\r\n\r\nBut through me went a little glow of reassurance.  Whatever the maze\r\nthrough which we were moving; whatever of menacing evil lurking\r\nthere--the Golden Girl was clearly watching over us; watching with\r\nwhatever unknown powers she could muster.\r\n\r\nWe passed the pillared entrance; went through a long bowered corridor\r\nand stopped before a door that seemed to be sliced from a monolith of\r\npale jade--high, narrow, set in a wall of opal.\r\n\r\nRador stamped twice and the same supernally sweet, silver bell tones\r\nof--yesterday, I must call it, although in that place of eternal day\r\nthe term is meaningless--bade us enter. The door slipped aside. The\r\nchamber was small, the opal walls screening it on three sides, the\r\nblack opacity covering it, the fourth side opening out into a\r\ndelicious little walled garden--a mass of the fragrant, luminous\r\nblooms and delicately colored fruit. Facing it was a small table of\r\nreddish wood and from the omnipresent cushions heaped around it arose\r\nto greet us--Yolara.\r\n\r\nLarry drew in his breath with an involuntary gasp of admiration and\r\nbowed low. My own admiration was as frank--and the priestess was well\r\npleased with our homage.\r\n\r\nShe was swathed in the filmy, half-revelant webs, now of palest blue.\r\nThe corn-silk hair was caught within a wide-meshed golden net in which\r\nsparkled tiny brilliants, like blended sapphires and diamonds. Her own\r\nazure eyes sparkled as brightly as they, and I noted again in their\r\nclear depths the half-eager approval as they rested upon O'Keefe's\r\nlithe, well-knit figure and his keen, clean-cut face. The high-arched,\r\nslender feet rested upon soft sandals whose gauzy withes laced the\r\nexquisitely formed leg to just below the dimpled knee.\r\n\r\n\"Some giddy wonder!\" exclaimed Larry, looking at me and placing a hand\r\nover his heart. \"Put her on a New York roof and she'd empty Broadway.\r\nTake the cue from me, Doc.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned to Yolara, whose face was somewhat puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"I said, O lady whose shining hair is a web for hearts, that in our\r\nworld your beauty would dazzle the sight of men as would a little\r\nwoman sun!\" he said, in the florid imagery to which the tongue lends\r\nitself so well.\r\n\r\nA flush stole up through the translucent skin.  The blue eyes softened\r\nand she waved us toward the cushions. Black-haired maids stole in,\r\nplacing before us the fruits, the little loaves and a steaming drink\r\nsomewhat the colour and odor of chocolate. I was conscious of\r\noutrageous hunger.\r\n\r\n\"What are you named, strangers?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"This man is named Goodwin,\" said O'Keefe.  \"As for me, call me\r\nLarry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing like getting acquainted quick,\" he said to me--but kept his\r\neyes upon Yolara as though he were voicing another honeyed phrase. And\r\nso she took it, for: \"You must teach me your tongue,\" she murmured.\r\n\r\n\"Then shall I have two words where now I have one to tell you of your\r\nloveliness,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"And also that'll take time,\" he spoke to me.  \"Essential occupation\r\nout of which we can't be drafted to make these fun-loving folk any\r\nRoman holiday. Get me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Larree,\" mused Yolara.  \"I like the sound.  It is sweet--\" and indeed\r\nit was as she spoke it.\r\n\r\n\"And what is your land named, Larree?\" she continued. \"And Goodwin's?\"\r\nShe caught the sound perfectly.\r\n\r\n\"My land, O lady of loveliness, is two--Ireland and America; his but\r\none--America.\"\r\n\r\nShe repeated the two names--slowly, over and over.  We seized the\r\nopportunity to attack the food; halting half guiltily as she spoke\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but you are hungry!\" she cried.  \"Eat then.\" She leaned her chin\r\nupon her hands and regarded us, whole fountains of questions brimming\r\nup in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"How is it, Larree, that you have two countries and Goodwin but one?\"\r\nshe asked, at last unable to keep silent longer.\r\n\r\n\"I was born in Ireland; he in America.  But I have dwelt long in his\r\nland and my heart loves each,\" he said.\r\n\r\nShe nodded, understandingly.\r\n\r\n\"Are all the men of Ireland like you, Larree?  As all the men here are\r\nlike Lugur or Rador? I like to look at you,\" she went on, with naive\r\nfrankness. \"I am tired of men like Lugur and Rador. But they are\r\nstrong,\" she added, swiftly. \"Lugur can hold up ten in his two arms\r\nand raise six with but one hand.\"\r\n\r\nWe could not understand her numerals and she raised white fingers to\r\nillustrate.\r\n\r\n\"That is little, O lady, to the men of Ireland,\" replied O'Keefe.\r\n\"Lo, I have seen one of my race hold up ten times ten of our--what\r\ncall you that swift thing in which Rador brought us here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Corial,\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"Hold up ten times twenty of our corials with but two fingers--and\r\nthese corials of ours--\"\r\n\r\n\"Coria,\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"And these coria of ours are each greater in weight than ten of yours.\r\nYes, and I have seen another with but one blow of his hand raise hell!\r\n\r\n\"And so I have,\" he murmured to me.  \"And both at Forty-second and\r\nFifth Avenue, N. Y.--U. S. A.\"\r\n\r\nYolara considered all this with manifest doubt.\r\n\r\n\"Hell?\" she inquired at last.  \"I know not the word.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" answered O'Keefe.  \"Say Muria then.  In many ways they are, I\r\ngather, O heart's delight, one and the same.\"\r\n\r\nNow the doubt in the blue eyes was strong indeed.  She shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"None of our men can do _that_!\" she answered, at length. \"Nor do I\r\nthink you could, Larree.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" said Larry easily.  \"I never tried to be that strong.  I\r\nfly,\" he added, casually.\r\n\r\nThe priestess rose to her feet, gazing at him with startled eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Fly!\" she repeated incredulously.  \"Like a _Zitia_?  A bird?\"\r\n\r\nLarry nodded--and then seeing the dawning command in her eyes, went on\r\nhastily.\r\n\r\n\"Not with my own wings, Yolara.  In a--a corial that moves\r\nthrough--what's the word for air, Doc--well, through this--\" He made a\r\nwide gesture up toward the nebulous haze above us. He took a pencil\r\nand on a white cloth made a hasty sketch of an airplane. \"In a--a\r\ncorial like this--\" She regarded the sketch gravely, thrust a hand\r\ndown into her girdle and brought forth a keen-bladed poniard; cut\r\nLarry's markings out and placed the fragment carefully aside.\r\n\r\n\"That I can understand,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Remarkably intelligent young woman,\" muttered O'Keefe.  \"Hope I'm not\r\ngiving anything away--but she had me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what are your women like, Larree?  Are they like me?  And how\r\nmany have loved you?\" she whispered.\r\n\r\n\"In all Ireland and America there is none like you, Yolara,\" he\r\nanswered. \"And take that any way you please,\" he muttered in English.\r\nShe took it, it was evident, as it most pleased her.\r\n\r\n\"Do you have goddesses?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Every woman in Ireland and America, is a goddess\"; thus Larry.\r\n\r\n\"Now that I do not believe.\" There was both anger and mockery in her\r\neyes. \"I know women, Larree--and if that were so there would be no\r\npeace for men.\"\r\n\r\n\"There isn't!\" replied he.  The anger died out and she laughed,\r\nsweetly, understandingly.\r\n\r\n\"And which goddess do you worship, Larree?\"\r\n\r\n\"You!\" said Larry O'Keefe boldly.\r\n\r\n\"Larry!  Larry!\" I whispered.  \"Be careful.  It's high explosive.\"\r\n\r\nBut the priestess was laughing--little trills of sweet bell notes; and\r\npleasure was in each note.\r\n\r\n\"You are indeed bold, Larree,\" she said, \"to offer me your worship.\r\nYet am I pleased by your boldness. Still--Lugur is strong; and you are\r\nnot of those who--what did you say--have tried. And your wings are\r\nnot here--Larree!\"\r\n\r\nAgain her laughter rang out.  The Irishman flushed; it was _touché_\r\nfor Yolara!\r\n\r\n\"Fear not for me with Lugur,\" he said, grimly.  \"Rather fear for him!\"\r\n\r\nThe laughter died; she looked at him searchingly; a little enigmatic\r\nsmile about her mouth--so sweet and so cruel.\r\n\r\n\"Well--we shall see,\" she murmured.  \"You say you battle in your\r\nworld. With what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, with this and with that,\" answered Larry, airily. \"We manage--\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you the Keth--I mean that with which I sent Songar into the\r\nnothingness?\" she asked swiftly.\r\n\r\n\"See what she's driving at?\" O'Keefe spoke to me, swiftly. \"Well I do!\r\nBut here's where the O'Keefe lands.\r\n\r\n\"I said,\" he turned to her, \"O voice of silver fire, that your spirit\r\nis high even as your beauty--and searches out men's souls as does your\r\nloveliness their hearts. And now listen, Yolara, for what I speak is\r\ntruth\"--into his eyes came the far-away gaze; into his voice the Irish\r\nsoftness--\"Lo, in my land of Ireland, this many of your life's length\r\nagone--see\"--he raised his ten fingers, clenched and unclenched them\r\ntimes twenty--\"the mighty men of my race, the Taitha-da-Dainn, could\r\nsend men out into the nothingness even as do you with the Keth. And\r\nthis they did by their harpings, and by words spoken--words of power,\r\nO Yolara, that have their power still--and by pipings and by slaying\r\nsounds.\r\n\r\n\"There was Cravetheen who played swift flames from his harp, flying\r\nflames that ate those they were sent against. And there was Dalua, of\r\nHy Brasil, whose pipes played away from man and beast and all living\r\nthings their shadows--and at last played them to shadows too, so that\r\nwherever Dalua went his shadows that had been men and beast followed\r\nlike a storm of little rustling leaves; yea, and Bel the Harper, who\r\ncould make women's hearts run like wax and men's hearts flame to ashes\r\nand whose harpings could shatter strong cliffs and bow great trees to\r\nthe sod--\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes were bright, dream-filled; she shrank a little from him,\r\nfaint pallor under the perfect skin.\r\n\r\n\"I say to you, Yolara, that these things were and are--in Ireland.\"\r\nHis voice rang strong. \"And I have seen men as many as those that are\r\nin your great chamber this many times over\"--he clenched his hands\r\nonce more, perhaps a dozen times--\"blasted into nothingness before\r\nyour Keth could even have touched them. Yea--and rocks as mighty as\r\nthose through which we came lifted up and shattered before the lids\r\ncould fall over your blue eyes. And this is truth, Yolara--all truth!\r\nStay--have you that little cone of the Keth with which you destroyed\r\nSongar?\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded, gazing at him, fascinated, fear and puzzlement contending.\r\n\r\n\"Then use it.\" He took a vase of crystal from the table, placed it on\r\nthe threshold that led into the garden. \"Use it on this--and I will\r\nshow you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will use it upon one of the ladala--\" she began eagerly.\r\n\r\nThe exaltation dropped from him; there was a touch of horror in the\r\neyes he turned to her; her own dropped before it.\r\n\r\n\"It shall be as you say,\" she said hurriedly.  She drew the shining\r\ncone from her breast; levelled it at the vase. The green ray leaped\r\nforth, spread over the crystal, but before its action could even be\r\nbegun, a flash of light shot from O'Keefe's hand, his automatic spat\r\nand the trembling vase flew into fragments. As quickly as he had drawn\r\nit, he thrust the pistol back into place and stood there empty handed,\r\nlooking at her sternly. From the anteroom came shouting, a rush of\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nYolara's face was white, her eyes strained--but her voice was unshaken\r\nas she called to the clamouring guards:\r\n\r\n\"It is nothing--go to your places!\"\r\n\r\nBut when the sound of their return had ceased she stared tensely at\r\nthe Irishman--then looked again at the shattered vase.\r\n\r\n\"It is true!\" she cried, \"but see, the Keth is--alive!\"\r\n\r\nI followed her pointing finger.  Each broken bit of the crystal was\r\nvibrating, shaking its particles out into space. Broken it the bullet\r\nof Larry's had--but not released it from the grip of the\r\ndisintegrating force. The priestess's face was triumphant.\r\n\r\n\"But what matters it, O shining urn of beauty--what matters it to the\r\nvase that is broken what happens to its fragments?\" asked Larry,\r\ngravely--and pointedly.\r\n\r\nThe triumph died from her face and for a space she was silent;\r\nbrooding.\r\n\r\n\"Next,\" whispered O'Keefe to me.  \"Lots of surprises in the little\r\nbox; keep your eye on the opening and see what comes out.\"\r\n\r\nWe had not long to wait.  There was a sparkle of anger about Yolara,\r\nsomething too of injured pride. She clapped her hands; whispered to\r\nthe maid who answered her summons, and then sat back regarding us,\r\nmaliciously.\r\n\r\n\"You have answered me as to your strength--but you have not proved it;\r\nbut the Keth you have answered. Now answer this!\" she said.\r\n\r\nShe pointed out into the garden.  I saw a flowering branch bend and\r\nsnap as though a hand had broken it--but no hand was there! Saw then\r\nanother and another bend and break, a little tree sway and fall--and\r\ncloser and closer to us came the trail of snapping boughs while down\r\ninto the garden poured the silvery light revealing--nothing! Now a\r\ngreat ewer beside a pillar rose swiftly in air and hurled itself\r\ncrashing at my feet. Cushions close to us swirled about as though in\r\nthe vortex of a whirlwind.\r\n\r\nAnd unseen hands held my arms in a mighty clutch fast to my sides,\r\nanother gripped my throat and I felt a needle-sharp poniard point\r\npierce my shirt, touch the skin just over my heart!\r\n\r\n\"Larry!\" I cried, despairingly.  I twisted my head; saw that he too\r\nwas caught in this grip of the invisible. But his face was calm, even\r\namused.\r\n\r\n\"Keep cool, Doc!\" he said.  \"Remember--she wants to learn the\r\nlanguage!\"\r\n\r\nNow from Yolara burst chime upon chime of mocking laughter.  She gave\r\na command--the hands loosened, the poniard withdrew from my heart;\r\nsuddenly as I had been caught I was free--and unpleasantly weak and\r\nshaky.\r\n\r\n\"Have you _that_ in Ireland, Larree!\" cried the priestess--and once\r\nmore trembled with laughter.\r\n\r\n\"A good play, Yolara.\" His voice was as calm as his face. \"But they\r\ndid that in Ireland even before Dalua piped away his first man's\r\nshadow. And in Goodwin's land they make ships--coria that go on\r\nwater--so you can pass by them and see only sea and sky; and those\r\nwater coria are each of them many times greater than this whole palace\r\nof yours.\"\r\n\r\nBut the priestess laughed on.\r\n\r\n\"It did get me a little,\" whispered Larry.  \"That wasn't quite up to\r\nmy mark. But God! If we could find that trick out and take it back\r\nwith us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so, Larree!\" Yolara gasped, through her laughter. \"Not so!\r\nGoodwin's cry betrayed you!\"\r\n\r\nHer good humour had entirely returned; she was like a mischievous\r\nchild pleased over some successful trick; and like a child she\r\ncried--\"I'll show you!\"--signalled again; whispered to the maid who,\r\nquickly returning, laid before her a long metal case. Yolara took from\r\nher girdle something that looked like a small pencil, pressed it and\r\nshot a thin stream of light for all the world like an electric flash,\r\nupon its hasp. The lid flew open. Out of it she drew three flat, oval\r\ncrystals, faint rose in hue. She handed one to O'Keefe and one to me.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" she commanded, placing the third before her own eyes.  I\r\npeered through the stone and instantly there leaped into sight, out of\r\nthin air--six grinning dwarfs! Each was covered from top of head to\r\nsoles of feet in a web so tenuous that through it their bodies were\r\nplain. The gauzy stuff seemed to vibrate--its strands to run together\r\nlike quick-silver. I snatched the crystal from my eyes and--the\r\nchamber was empty! Put it back--and there were the grinning six!\r\n\r\nYolara gave another sign and they disappeared, even from the crystals.\r\n\r\n\"It is what they wear, Larree,\" explained Yolara, graciously.  \"It is\r\nsomething that came to us from--the Ancient Ones. But we have so\r\nfew\"--she sighed.\r\n\r\n\"Such treasures must be two-edged swords, Yolara,\" commented O'Keefe.\r\n\"For how know you that one within them creeps not to you with hand\r\neager to strike?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no danger,\" she said indifferently.  \"I am the keeper of\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nShe mused for a space, then abruptly:\r\n\r\n\"And now no more.  You two are to appear before the Council at a\r\ncertain time--but fear nothing. You, Goodwin, go with Rador about our\r\ncity and increase your wisdom. But you, Larree, await me here in my\r\ngarden--\" she smiled at him, provocatively--maliciously, too. \"For\r\nshall not one who has resisted a world of goddesses be given all\r\nchance to worship when at last he finds his own?\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed--whole-heartedly and was gone.  And at that moment I liked\r\nYolara better than ever I had before and--alas--better than ever I\r\nwas to in the future.\r\n\r\nI noted Rador standing outside the open jade door and started to go,\r\nbut O'Keefe caught me by the arm.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute,\" he urged.  \"About Golden Eyes--you were going to tell\r\nme something--it's been on my mind all through that little sparring\r\nmatch.\"\r\n\r\nI told him of the vision that had passed through my closing lids.  He\r\nlistened gravely and then laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Hell of a lot of privacy in this place!\" he grinned.  \"Ladies who can\r\nwalk through walls and others with regular invisible cloaks to let 'em\r\nflit wherever they please. Oh, well, don't let it get on your nerves,\r\nDoc. Remember--everything's natural! That robe stuff is just\r\ncamouflage of course. But Lord, if we could only get a piece of it!\"\r\n\r\n\"The material simply admits all light-vibrations, or perhaps curves\r\nthem, just as the opacities cut them off,\" I answered. \"A man under\r\nthe X-ray is partly invisible; this makes him wholly so. He doesn't\r\nregister, as the people of the motion-picture profession say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Camouflage,\" repeated Larry.  \"And as for the Shining One--Say!\" he\r\nsnorted. \"I'd like to set the O'Keefe banshee up against it. I'll bet\r\nthat old resourceful Irish body would give it the first three bites\r\nand a strangle hold and wallop it before it knew it had 'em. Oh! Wow!\r\nBoy Howdy!\"\r\n\r\nI heard him still chuckling gleefully over this vision as I passed\r\nalong the opal wall with the green dwarf.\r\n\r\nA shell was awaiting us.  I paused before entering it to examine the\r\npolished surface of runway and great road. It was obsidian--volcanic\r\nglass of pale emerald, unflawed, translucent, with no sign of block or\r\njuncture. I examined the shell.\r\n\r\n\"What makes it go?\" I asked Rador.  At a word from him the driver\r\ntouched a concealed spring and an aperture appeared beneath the\r\ncontrol-lever, of which I have spoken in a preceding chapter. Within\r\nwas a small cube of black crystal, through whose sides I saw, dimly, a\r\nrapidly revolving, glowing ball, not more than two inches in diameter.\r\nBeneath the cube was a curiously shaped, slender cylinder winding down\r\ninto the lower body of the Nautilus whorl.\r\n\r\n\"Watch!\" said Rador.  He motioned me into the vehicle and took a place\r\nbeside me. The driver touched the lever; a stream of coruscations flew\r\nfrom the ball down into the cylinder. The shell started smoothly, and\r\nas the tiny torrent of shining particles increased it gathered speed.\r\n\r\n\"The corial does not touch the road,\" explained Rador. \"It is lifted\r\nso far\"--he held his forefinger and thumb less than a sixteenth of an\r\ninch apart--\"above it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps here is the best place to explain the activation of the\r\nshells or coria. The force utilized was atomic energy. Passing from\r\nthe whirling ball the ions darted through the cylinder to two bands of\r\na peculiar metal affixed to the base of the vehicles somewhat like\r\nskids of a sled. Impinging upon these they produced a partial negation\r\nof gravity, lifting the shell slightly, and at the same time creating\r\na powerful repulsive force or thrust that could be directed backward,\r\nforward, or sidewise at the will of the driver. The creation of this\r\nenergy and the mechanism of its utilization were, briefly, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n[Dr. Goodwin's lucid and exceedingly comprehensive description of this\r\nextraordinary mechanism has been deleted by the Executive Council of\r\nthe International Association of Science as too dangerously suggestive\r\nto scientists of the Central European Powers with which we were so\r\nrecently at war. It is allowable, however, to state that his\r\nobservations are in the possession of experts in this country, who\r\nare, unfortunately, hampered in their research not only by the\r\nscarcity of the radioactive elements that we know, but also by the\r\nlack of the element or elements unknown to us that entered into the\r\nformation of the fiery ball within the cube of black crystal.\r\nNevertheless, as the principle is so clear, it is believed that these\r\ndifficulties will ultimately be overcome.--J. B. K., President, I. A.\r\nof S.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wide, glistening road was gay with the coria.  They darted in and\r\nout of the gardens; within them the fair-haired, extraordinarily\r\nbeautiful women on their cushions were like princesses of Elfland,\r\ncaught in gorgeous fairy webs, resting within the hearts of flowers.\r\nIn some shells were flaxen-haired dwarfish men of Lugur's type;\r\nsometimes black-polled brother officers of Rador; often raven-tressed\r\ngirls, plainly hand-maidens of the women; and now and then beauties of\r\nthe lower folk went by with one of the blond dwarfs.\r\n\r\nWe swept around the turn that made of the jewel-like roadway an\r\nenormous horseshoe and, speedily, upon our right the cliffs through\r\nwhich we had come in our journey from the Moon Pool began to march\r\nforward beneath their mantles of moss. They formed a gigantic\r\nabutment, a titanic salient. It had been from the very front of this\r\nsalient's invading angle that we had emerged; on each side of it the\r\nprecipices, faintly glowing, drew back and vanished into distance.\r\n\r\nThe slender, graceful bridges under which we skimmed ended at openings\r\nin the upflung, far walls of verdure. Each had its little garrison of\r\nsoldiers. Through some of the openings a rivulet of the green obsidian\r\nriver passed. These were roadways to the farther country, to the land\r\nof the ladala, Rador told me; adding that none of the lesser folk\r\ncould cross into the pavilioned city unless summoned or with pass.\r\n\r\nWe turned the bend of the road and flew down that farther emerald\r\nribbon we had seen from the great oval. Before us rose the shining\r\ncliffs and the lake. A half-mile, perhaps, from these the last of the\r\nbridges flung itself. It was more massive and about it hovered a\r\nspirit of ancientness lacking in the other spans; also its garrison\r\nwas larger and at its base the tangent way was guarded by two massive\r\nstructures, somewhat like blockhouses, between which it ran. Something\r\nabout it aroused in me an intense curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"Where does that road lead, Rador?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"To the one place above all of which I may not tell you, Goodwin,\" he\r\nanswered. And again I wondered.\r\n\r\nWe skimmed slowly out upon the great pier.  Far to the left was the\r\nprismatic, rainbow curtain between the Cyclopean pillars. On the white\r\nwaters graceful shells--lacustrian replicas of the Elf chariots--swam,\r\nbut none was near that distant web of wonder.\r\n\r\n\"Rador--what is that?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"It is the Veil of the Shining One!\" he answered slowly.\r\n\r\nWas the Shining One that which we named the Dweller?\r\n\r\n\"What is the Shining One?\" I cried, eagerly.  Again he was silent.\r\nNor did he speak until we had turned on our homeward way.\r\n\r\nAnd lively as my interest, my scientific curiosity, were--I was\r\nconscious suddenly of acute depression. Beautiful, wondrously\r\nbeautiful this place was--and yet in its wonder dwelt a keen edge of\r\nmenace, of unease--of inexplicable, inhuman woe; as though in a secret\r\ngarden of God a soul should sense upon it the gaze of some lurking\r\nspirit of evil which some way, somehow, had crept into the sanctuary\r\nand only bided its time to spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nThe Leprechaun\r\n\r\nThe shell carried us straight back to the house of Yolara. Larry was\r\nawaiting me. We stood again before the tenebrous wall where first we\r\nhad faced the priestess and the Voice. And as we stood, again the\r\nportal appeared with all its disconcerting, magical abruptness.\r\n\r\nBut now the scene was changed.  Around the jet table were grouped a\r\nnumber of figures--Lugur, Yolara beside him; seven others--all of them\r\nfair-haired and all men save one who sat at the left of the\r\npriestess--an old, old woman, how old I could not tell, her face\r\nbearing traces of beauty that must once have been as great as Yolara's\r\nown, but now ravaged, in some way awesome; through its ruins the\r\nfearful, malicious gaiety shining out like a spirit of joy held within\r\na corpse!\r\n\r\nBegan then our examination, for such it was.  And as it progressed I\r\nwas more and more struck by the change in the O'Keefe. All flippancy\r\nwas gone, rarely did his sense of humour reveal itself in any of his\r\nanswers. He was like a cautious swordsman, fencing, guarding, studying\r\nhis opponent; or rather, like a chess-player who keeps sensing some\r\nfar-reaching purpose in the game: alert, contained, watchful. Always\r\nhe stressed the power of our surface races, their multitudes, their\r\nsolidarity.\r\n\r\nTheir questions were myriad.  What were our occupations? Our system of\r\ngovernment? How great were the waters? The land? Intensely interested\r\nwere they in the World War, querying minutely into its causes, its\r\neffects. In our weapons their interest was avid. And they were\r\nexceedingly minute in their examination of us as to the ruins which\r\nhad excited our curiosity; their position and surroundings--and if\r\nothers than ourselves might be expected to find and pass through their\r\nentrance!\r\n\r\nAt this I shot a glance at Lugur.  He did not seem unduly interested.\r\nI wondered if the Russian had told him as yet of the girl of the rosy\r\nwall of the Moon Pool Chamber and the real reasons for our search.\r\nThen I answered as briefly as possible--omitting all reference to\r\nthese things. The red dwarf watched me with unmistakable\r\namusement--and I knew Marakinoff had told him. But clearly Lugur had\r\nkept his information even from Yolara; and as clearly she had spoken\r\nto none of that episode when O'Keefe's automatic had shattered the\r\nKeth-smitten vase. Again I felt that sense of deep bewilderment--of\r\nhelpless search for clue to all the tangle.\r\n\r\nFor two hours we were questioned and then the priestess called Rador\r\nand let us go.\r\n\r\nLarry was sombre as we returned.  He walked about the room uneasily.\r\n\r\n\"Hell's brewing here all right,\" he said at last, stopping before me.\r\n\"I can't make out just the particular brand--that's all that bothers\r\nme. We're going to have a stiff fight, that's sure. What I want to do\r\nquick is to find the Golden Girl, Doc. Haven't seen her on the wall\r\nlately, have you?\" he queried, hopefully fantastic.\r\n\r\n\"Laugh if you want to,\" he went on.  \"But she's our best bet.  It's\r\ngoing to be a race between her and the O'Keefe banshee--but I put my\r\nmoney on her. I had a queer experience while I was in that garden,\r\nafter you'd left.\" His voice grew solemn. \"Did you ever see a\r\nleprechaun, Doc?\" I shook my head again, as solemnly. \"He's a little\r\nman in green,\" said Larry. \"Oh, about as high as your knee. I saw one\r\nonce--in Carntogher Woods. And as I sat there, half asleep, in\r\nYolara's garden, the living spit of him stepped out from one of those\r\nbushes, twirling a little shillalah.\r\n\r\n\"'It's a tight box ye're gettin' in, Larry avick,' said he, 'but don't\r\nye be downhearted, lad.'\r\n\r\n\"'I'm carrying on,' said I, 'but you're a long way from Ireland,' I\r\nsaid, or thought I did.\r\n\r\n\"'Ye've a lot o' friends there,' he answered.  'An' where the heart\r\nrests the feet are swift to follow. Not that I'm sayin' I'd like to\r\nlive here, Larry,' said he.\r\n\r\n\"'I know where my heart is now,' I told him.  'It rests on a girl with\r\ngolden eyes and the hair and swan-white breast of Eilidh the Fair--but\r\nme feet don't seem to get me to her,' I said.\"\r\n\r\nThe brogue thickened.\r\n\r\n\"An' the little man in green nodded his head an' whirled his\r\nshillalah.\r\n\r\n\"'It's what I came to tell ye,' says he.  'Don't ye fall for the\r\nBhean-Nimher, the serpent woman wit' the blue eyes; she's a daughter\r\nof Ivor, lad--an' don't ye do nothin' to make the brown-haired coleen\r\nashamed o' ye, Larry O'Keefe. I knew yer great, great grandfather an'\r\nhis before him, aroon,' says he, 'an' wan o' the O'Keefe failin's is\r\nto think their hearts big enough to hold all the wimmen o' the world.\r\nA heart's built to hold only wan permanently, Larry,' he says, 'an'\r\nI'm warnin' ye a nice girl don't like to move into a place all\r\ncluttered up wid another's washin' an' mendin' an' cookin' an' other\r\nthings pertainin' to general wife work. Not that I think the blue-eyed\r\nwan is keen for mendin' an' cookin'!' says he.\r\n\r\n\"'You don't have to be comin' all this way to tell me that,' I answer.\r\n\r\n\"'Well, I'm just a tellin' you,' he says.  'Ye've got some rough\r\nknocks comin', Larry. In fact, ye're in for a devil of a time. But,\r\nremember that ye're the O'Keefe,' says he. 'An' while the bhoys are\r\nall wid ye, avick, ye've got to be on the job yourself.'\r\n\r\n\"'I hope,' I tell him, 'that the O'Keefe banshee can find her way here\r\nin time--that is, if it's necessary, which I hope it won't be.'\r\n\r\n\"'Don't ye worry about that,' says he.  'Not that she's keen on\r\nleavin' the ould sod, Larry. The good ould soul's in quite a state o'\r\nmind about ye, aroon. I don't mind tellin' ye, lad, that she's\r\nmobilizing all the clan an' if she _has_ to come for ye, avick, they'll\r\nbe wid her an' they'll sweep this joint clean before ye go. What\r\nthey'll do to it'll make the Big Wind look like a summer breeze on\r\nLough Lene! An' that's about all, Larry. We thought a voice from the\r\nGreen Isle would cheer ye. Don't fergit that ye're the O'Keefe an' I\r\nsay it again--all the bhoys are wid ye. But we want t' kape bein'\r\nproud o' ye, lad!'\r\n\r\n\"An' I looked again and there was only a bush waving.\"\r\n\r\nThere wasn't a smile in my heart--or if there was it was a very tender\r\none.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to bed,\" he said abruptly.  \"Keep an eye on the wall, Doc!\"\r\n\r\nBetween the seven sleeps that followed, Larry and I saw but little of\r\neach other. Yolara sought him more and more. Thrice we were called\r\nbefore the Council; once we were at a great feast, whose splendours\r\nand surprises I can never forget. Largely I was in the company of\r\nRador. Together we two passed the green barriers into the\r\ndwelling-place of the ladala.\r\n\r\nThey seemed provided with everything needful for life. But everywhere\r\nwas an oppressiveness, a gathering together of hate, that was\r\nspiritual rather than material--as tangible as the latter and far, far\r\nmore menacing!\r\n\r\n\"They do not like to dance with the Shining One,\" was Rador's constant\r\nand only reply to my efforts to find the cause.\r\n\r\nOnce I had concrete evidence of the mood.  Glancing behind me, I saw a\r\nwhite, vengeful face peer from behind a tree-trunk, a hand lift, a\r\nshining dart speed from it straight toward Rador's back. Instinctively\r\nI thrust him aside. He turned upon me angrily. I pointed to where the\r\nlittle missile lay, still quivering, on the ground. He gripped my\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"That, some day I will repay!\" he said.  I looked again at the thing.\r\nAt its end was a tiny cone covered with a glistening, gelatinous\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nRador pulled from a tree beside us a fruit somewhat like an apple.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" he said.  He dropped it upon the dart--and at once, before my\r\neyes, in less than ten seconds, the fruit had rotted away!\r\n\r\n\"That's what would have happened to Rador but for you, friend!\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nCome now between this and the prelude to the latter half of the drama\r\nwhose history this narrative is--only scattering and necessarily\r\nfragmentary observations.\r\n\r\nFirst--the nature of the ebon opacities, blocking out the spaces\r\nbetween the pavilion-pillars or covering their tops like roofs, These\r\nwere magnetic fields, light absorbers, negativing the vibrations of\r\nradiance; literally screens of electric force which formed as\r\nimpervious a barrier to light as would have screens of steel.\r\n\r\nThey instantaneously made night appear in a place where no night was.\r\nBut they interposed no obstacle to air or to sound. They were\r\nextremely simple in their inception--no more miraculous than is glass,\r\nwhich, inversely, admits the vibrations of light, but shuts out those\r\ncoarser ones we call air--and, partly, those others which produce upon\r\nour auditory nerves the effects we call sound.\r\n\r\nBriefly their mechanism was this:\r\n\r\n\r\n[For the same reason that Dr. Goodwin's exposition of the mechanism\r\nof the atomic engines was deleted, his description of the\r\nlight-destroying screens has been deleted by the Executive\r\nCouncil.--J. B. F., President, I. A. of S.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were two favoured classes of the ladala--the soldiers and the\r\ndream-makers. The dream-makers were the most astonishing social\r\nphenomena, I think, of all. Denied by their circumscribed environment\r\nthe wider experiences of us of the outer world, the Murians had\r\nperfected an amazing system of escape through the imagination.\r\n\r\nThey were, too, intensely musical.  Their favourite instruments were\r\ndouble flutes; immensely complex pipe-organs; harps, great and small.\r\nThey had another remarkable instrument made up of a double octave of\r\nsmall drums which gave forth percussions remarkably disturbing to the\r\nemotional centres.\r\n\r\nIt was this love of music that gave rise to one of the few truly\r\nhumorous incidents of our caverned life. Larry came to me--it was just\r\nafter our fourth sleep, I remember.\r\n\r\n\"Come on to a concert,\" he said.\r\n\r\nWe skimmed off to one of the bridge garrisons.  Rador called the\r\ntwo-score guards to attention; and then, to my utter stupefaction, the\r\nwhole company, O'Keefe leading them, roared out the anthem, \"God Save\r\nthe King.\" They sang--in a closer approach to the English than might\r\nhave been expected scores of miles below England's level. \"Send him\r\nvictorious! Happy and glorious!\" they bellowed.\r\n\r\nHe quivered with suppressed mirth at my paralysis of surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Taught 'em that for Marakinoff's benefit!\" he gasped. \"Wait till that\r\nRed hears it. He'll blow up.\r\n\r\n\"Just wait until you hear Yolara lisp a pretty little thing I taught\r\nher,\" said Larry as we set back for what we now called home. There was\r\nan impish twinkle in his eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd I did hear.  For it was not many minutes later that the priestess\r\ncondescended to command me to come to her with O'Keefe.\r\n\r\n\"Show Goodwin how much you have learned of our speech, O lady of the\r\nlips of honeyed flame!\" murmured Larry.\r\n\r\nShe hesitated; smiled at him, and then from that perfect mouth, out of\r\nthe exquisite throat, in the voice that was like the chiming of little\r\nsilver bells, she trilled a melody familiar to me indeed:\r\n\r\n    \"She's only a bird in a gilded cage,\r\n      A bee-yu-tiful sight to see--\"\r\n\r\nAnd so on to the bitter end.\r\n\r\n\"She thinks it's a love-song,\" said Larry when we had left. \"It's only\r\npart of a repertoire I'm teaching her. Honestly, Doc, it's the only\r\nway I can keep my mind clear when I'm with her,\" he went on earnestly.\r\n\"She's a devil-ess from hell--but a wonder. Whenever I find myself\r\ngoing I get her to sing that, or Take Back Your Gold! or some other\r\nancient lay, and I'm back again--pronto--with the right perspective!\r\nPOP goes all the mystery! 'Hell!' I say, 'she's only a woman!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nThe Amphitheatre of Jet\r\n\r\nFor hours the black-haired folk had been streaming across the bridges,\r\nflowing along the promenade by scores and by hundreds, drifting down\r\ntoward the gigantic seven-terraced temple whose interior I had never\r\nas yet seen, and from whose towering exterior, indeed, I had always\r\nbeen kept far enough away--unobtrusively, but none the less decisively--to\r\nprevent any real observation. The structure, I had estimated,\r\nnevertheless, could not reach less than a thousand feet above its\r\nsilvery base, and the diameter of its circular foundation was about\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nI wondered what was bringing the _ladala_ into Lora, and where they\r\nwere vanishing. All of them were flower-crowned with the luminous,\r\nlovely blooms--old and young, slender, mocking-eyed girls, dwarfed\r\nyouths, mothers with their babes, gnomed oldsters--on they poured,\r\nsilent for the most part and sullen--a sullenness that held acid\r\nbitterness even as their subtle, half-sinister, half-gay malice seemed\r\ntempered into little keen-edged flames, oddly, menacingly defiant.\r\n\r\nThere were many of the green-clad soldiers along the way, and the\r\ngarrison of the only bridge span I could see had certainly been\r\ndoubled.\r\n\r\nWondering still, I turned from my point of observation and made my way\r\nback to our pavilion, hoping that Larry, who had been with Yolara for\r\nthe past two hours, had returned. Hardly had I reached it before Rador\r\ncame hurrying up, in his manner a curious exultance mingled with what\r\nin anyone else I would have called a decided nervousness.\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" he commanded before I could speak.  \"The Council has made\r\ndecision--and _Larree_ is awaiting you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What has been decided?\" I panted as we sped along the mosaic path\r\nthat led to the house of Yolara. \"And why is Larry awaiting me?\"\r\n\r\nAnd at his answer I felt my heart pause in its beat and through me\r\nrace a wave of mingled panic and eagerness.\r\n\r\n\"The Shining One dances!\" had answered the green dwarf. \"And you are\r\nto worship!\"\r\n\r\nWhat was this dancing of the Shining One, of which so often he had\r\nspoken?\r\n\r\nWhatever my forebodings, Larry evidently had none.\r\n\r\n\"Great stuff!\" he cried, when we had met in the great antechamber now\r\nempty of the dwarfs. \"Hope it will be worth seeing--have to be\r\nsomething damned good, though, to catch me, after what I've seen of\r\nshows at the front,\" he added.\r\n\r\nAnd remembering, with a little shock of apprehension, that he had no\r\nknowledge of the Dweller beyond my poor description of it--for there\r\nare no words actually to describe what that miracle of interwoven\r\nglory and horror was--I wondered what Larry O'Keefe would say and do\r\nwhen he did behold it!\r\n\r\nRador began to show impatience.\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" he urged.  \"There is much to be done--and the time grows\r\nshort!\"\r\n\r\nHe led us to a tiny fountain room in whose miniature pool the white\r\nwaters were concentrated, pearl-like and opalescent in their circling\r\nrim.\r\n\r\n\"Bathe!\" he commanded; and set the example by stripping himself and\r\nplunging within. Only a minute or two did the green dwarf allow us,\r\nand he checked us as we were about to don our clothing.\r\n\r\nThen, to my intense embarrassment, without warning, two of the\r\nblack-haired girls entered, bearing robes of a peculiar dull-blue hue.\r\nAt our manifest discomfort Rador's laughter roared out. He took the\r\ngarments from the pair, motioned them to leave us, and, still\r\nlaughing, threw one around me. Its texture was soft, but decidedly\r\nmetallic--like some blue metal spun to the fineness of a spider's\r\nthread. The garment buckled tightly at the throat, was girdled at the\r\nwaist, and, below this cincture, fell to the floor, its folds being\r\nheld together by a half-dozen looped cords; from the shoulders a hood\r\nresembling a monk's cowl.\r\n\r\nRador cast this over my head; it completely covered my face, but was\r\nof so transparent a texture that I could see, though somewhat mistily,\r\nthrough it. Finally he handed us both a pair of long gloves of the\r\nsame material and high stockings, the feet of which were\r\ngloved--five-toed.\r\n\r\nAnd again his laughter rang out at our manifest surprise.\r\n\r\n\"The priestess of the Shining One does not altogether trust the\r\nShining One's Voice,\" he said at last. \"And these are to guard against\r\nany sudden--errors. And fear not, Goodwin,\" he went on kindly. \"Not\r\nfor the Shining One itself would Yolara see harm come to _Larree_\r\nhere--nor, because of him, to you. But I would not stake much on the\r\ngreat white one. And for him I am sorry, for him I do like well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he to be with us?\" asked Larry eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"He is to be where we go,\" replied the dwarf soberly.\r\n\r\nGrimly Larry reached down and drew from his uniform his automatic.  He\r\npopped a fresh clip into the pocket fold of his girdle. The pistol he\r\nslung high up beneath his arm-pit.\r\n\r\nThe green dwarf looked at the weapon curiously.  O'Keefe tapped it.\r\n\r\n\"This,\" said Larry, \"slays quicker than the _Keth_--I take it so no\r\nharm shall come to the blue-eyed one whose name is Olaf. If I should\r\nraise it--be you not in its way, Rador!\" he added significantly.\r\n\r\nThe dwarf nodded again, his eyes sparkling.  He thrust a hand out to\r\nboth of us.\r\n\r\n\"A change comes,\" he said.  \"What it is I know not, nor how it will\r\nfall. But this remember--Rador is more friend to you than you yet can\r\nknow. And now let us go!\" he ended abruptly.\r\n\r\nHe led us, not through the entrance, but into a sloping passage ending\r\nin a blind wall; touched a symbol graven there, and it opened,\r\nprecisely as had the rosy barrier of the Moon Pool Chamber. And, just\r\nas there, but far smaller, was a passage end, a low curved wall facing\r\na shaft not black as had been that abode of living darkness, but\r\nfaintly luminescent. Rador leaned over the wall. The mechanism clicked\r\nand started; the door swung shut; the sides of the car slipped into\r\nplace, and we swept swiftly down the passage; overhead the wind\r\nwhistled. In a few moments the moving platform began to slow down. It\r\nstopped in a closed chamber no larger than itself.\r\n\r\nRador drew his poniard and struck twice upon the wall with its hilt.\r\nImmediately a panel moved away, revealing a space filled with faint,\r\nmisty blue radiance. And at each side of the open portal stood four of\r\nthe dwarfish men, grey-headed, old, clad in flowing garments of white,\r\neach pointing toward us a short silver rod.\r\n\r\nRador drew from his girdle a ring and held it out to the first dwarf.\r\nHe examined it, handed it to the one beside him, and not until each\r\nhad inspected the ring did they lower their curious weapons;\r\ncontainers of that terrific energy they called the _Keth_, I thought;\r\nand later was to know that I had been right.\r\n\r\nWe stepped out; the doors closed behind us.  The place was weird\r\nenough. Its pave was a greenish-blue stone resembling lapis lazuli. On\r\neach side were high pedestals holding carved figures of the same\r\nmaterial. There were perhaps a score of these, but in the mistiness I\r\ncould not make out their outlines. A droning, rushing roar beat upon\r\nour ears; filled the whole cavern.\r\n\r\n\"I smell the sea,\" said Larry suddenly.\r\n\r\nThe roaring became deep-toned, clamorous, and close in front of us a\r\nrift opened. Twenty feet in width, it cut the cavern floor and\r\nvanished into the blue mist on each side. The cleft was spanned by one\r\nsolid slab of rock not more than two yards wide. It had neither\r\nrailing nor other protection.\r\n\r\nThe four leading priests marched out upon it one by one, and we\r\nfollowed. In the middle of the span they knelt. Ten feet beneath us\r\nwas a torrent of blue sea-water racing with prodigious speed between\r\npolished walls. It gave the impression of vast depth. It roared as it\r\nsped by, and far to the right was a low arch through which it\r\ndisappeared. It was so swift that its surface shone like polished blue\r\nsteel, and from it came the blessed, _our worldly_, familiar ocean\r\nbreath that strengthened my soul amazingly and made me realize how\r\nearth-sick I was.\r\n\r\nWhence came the stream, I marvelled, forgetting for the moment, as we\r\npassed on again, all else. Were we closer to the surface of earth than\r\nI had thought, or was this some mighty flood falling through an\r\nopening in sea floor, Heaven alone knew how many miles above us,\r\nlosing itself in deeper abysses beyond these? How near and how far\r\nthis was from the truth I was to learn--and never did truth come to\r\nman in more dreadful guise!\r\n\r\nThe roaring fell away, the blue haze lessened.  In front of us\r\nstretched a wide flight of steps, huge as those which had led us into\r\nthe courtyard of Nan-Tauach through the ruined sea-gate. We scaled it;\r\nit narrowed; from above light poured through a still narrower opening.\r\nSide by side Larry and I passed out of it.\r\n\r\nWe had emerged upon an enormous platform of what seemed to be\r\nglistening ivory. It stretched before us for a hundred yards or more\r\nand then shelved gently into the white waters. Opposite--not a mile\r\naway--was that prodigious web of woven rainbows Rador had called the\r\nVeil of the Shining One. There it shone in all its unearthly grandeur,\r\non each side of the Cyclopean pillars, as though a mountain should\r\nstretch up arms raising between them a fairy banner of auroral\r\nglories. Beneath it was the curved, scimitar sweep of the pier with\r\nits clustered, gleaming temples.\r\n\r\nBefore that brief, fascinated glance was done, there dropped upon my\r\nsoul a sensation as of brooding weight intolerable; a spiritual\r\noppression as though some vastness was falling, pressing, stifling me,\r\nI turned--and Larry caught me as I reeled.\r\n\r\n\"Steady!  Steady, old man!\" he whispered.\r\n\r\nAt first all that my staggering consciousness could realize was an\r\nimmensity, an immeasurable uprearing that brought with it the same\r\nthroat-gripping vertigo as comes from gazing downward from some great\r\nheight--then a blur of white faces--intolerable shinings of hundreds\r\nupon thousands of eyes. Huge, incredibly huge, a colossal amphitheatre\r\nof jet, a stupendous semi-circle, held within its mighty arc the ivory\r\nplatform on which I stood.\r\n\r\nIt reared itself almost perpendicularly hundreds of feet up into the\r\nsparkling heavens, and thrust down on each side its ebon\r\nbulwarks--like monstrous paws. Now, the giddiness from its sheer\r\ngreatness passing, I saw that it was indeed an amphitheatre sloping\r\nslightly backward tier after tier, and that the white blur of faces\r\nagainst its blackness, the gleaming of countless eyes were those of\r\nmyriads of the people who sat silent, flower-garlanded, their gaze\r\nfocused upon the rainbow curtain and sweeping over me like a\r\ntorrent--tangible, appalling!\r\n\r\nFive hundred feet beyond, the smooth, high retaining wall of the\r\namphitheatre raised itself--above it the first terrace of the seats,\r\nand above this, dividing the tiers for another half a thousand feet\r\nupward, set within them like a panel, was a dead-black surface in\r\nwhich shone faintly with a bluish radiance a gigantic disk; above it\r\nand around it a cluster of innumerable smaller ones.\r\n\r\nOn each side of me, bordering the platform, were scores of small\r\npillared alcoves, a low wall stretching across their fronts; delicate,\r\nfretted grills shielding them, save where in each lattice an opening\r\nstared--it came to me that they were like those stalls in ancient\r\nGothic cathedrals wherein for centuries had kneeled paladins and\r\npeople of my own race on earth's fair face. And within these alcoves\r\nwere gathered, score upon score, the elfin beauties, the dwarfish men\r\nof the fair-haired folk. At my right, a few feet from the opening\r\nthrough which we had come, a passageway led back between the fretted\r\nstalls. Half-way between us and the massive base of the amphitheatre a\r\ndais rose. Up the platform to it a wide ramp ascended; and on ramp and\r\ndais and along the centre of the gleaming platform down to where it\r\nkissed the white waters, a broad ribbon of the radiant flowers lay\r\nlike a fairy carpet.\r\n\r\nOn one side of this dais, meshed in a silken web that hid no line or\r\ncurve of her sweet body, white flesh gleaming through its folds, stood\r\nYolara; and opposite her, crowned with a circlet of flashing blue\r\nstones, his mighty body stark bare, was Lugur!\r\n\r\nO'Keefe drew a long breath; Rador touched my arm and, still dazed, I\r\nlet myself be drawn into the aisle and through a corridor that ran\r\nbehind the alcoves. At the back of one of these the green dwarf\r\npaused, opened a door, and motioned us within.\r\n\r\nEntering, I found that we were exactly opposite where the ramp ran up\r\nto the dais--and that Yolara was not more than fifty feet away. She\r\nglanced at O'Keefe and smiled. Her eyes were ablaze with little\r\ndancing points of light; her body seemed to palpitate, the rounded\r\ndelicate muscles beneath the translucent skin to run with joyful\r\nlittle eager waves!\r\n\r\nLarry whistled softly.\r\n\r\n\"There's Marakinoff!\" he said.\r\n\r\nI looked where he pointed.  Opposite us sat the Russian, clothed as we\r\nwere, leaning forward, his eyes eager behind his glasses; but if he\r\nsaw us he gave no sign.\r\n\r\n\"And there's Olaf!\" said O'Keefe.\r\n\r\nBeneath the carved stall in which sat the Russian was an aperture and\r\nwithin it was Huldricksson. Unprotected by pillars or by grills,\r\nopening clear upon the platform, near him stretched the trail of\r\nflowers up to the great dais which Lugur and Yolara the priestess\r\nguarded. He sat alone, and my heart went out to him.\r\n\r\nO'Keefe's face softened.\r\n\r\n\"Bring him here,\" he said to Rador.\r\n\r\nThe green dwarf was looking at the Norseman, too, a shade of pity upon\r\nhis mocking face. He shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" he said.  \"You can do nothing now--and it may be there will be\r\nno need to do anything,\" he added; but I could feel that there was\r\nlittle of conviction in his words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nThe Madness of Olaf\r\n\r\nYolara threw her white arms high.  From the mountainous tiers came a\r\nmighty sigh; a rippling ran through them. And upon the moment, before\r\nYolara's arms fell, there issued, apparently from the air around us, a\r\npeal of sound that might have been the shouting of some playful god\r\nhurling great suns through the net of stars. It was like the deepest\r\nnotes of all the organs in the world combined in one; summoning,\r\nmajestic, cosmic!\r\n\r\nIt held within it the thunder of the spheres rolling through the\r\ninfinite, the birth-song of suns made manifest in the womb of space;\r\nechoes of creation's supernal chord! It shook the body like a pulse\r\nfrom the heart of the universe--pulsed--and died away.\r\n\r\nOn its death came a blaring as of all the trumpets of conquering hosts\r\nsince the first Pharaoh led his swarms--triumphal, compelling!\r\nAlexander's clamouring hosts, brazen-throated wolf-horns of Caesar's\r\nlegions, blare of trumpets of Genghis Khan and his golden horde,\r\nclangor of the locust levies of Tamerlane, bugles of Napoleon's\r\narmies--war-shout of all earth's conquerors! And it died!\r\n\r\nFast upon it, a throbbing, muffled tumult of harp sounds, mellownesses\r\nof myriads of wood horns, the subdued sweet shrilling of multitudes of\r\nflutes, Pandean pipings--inviting, carrying with them the calling of\r\nwaterfalls in the hidden places, rushing brooks and murmuring forest\r\nwinds--calling, calling, languorous, lulling, dripping into the brain\r\nlike the very honeyed essence of sound.\r\n\r\nAnd after them a silence in which the memory of the music seemed to\r\nbeat, to beat ever more faintly, through every quivering nerve.\r\n\r\nFrom me all fear, all apprehension, had fled.  In their place was\r\nnothing but joyous anticipation, a supernal freedom from even the\r\nshadow of the shadow of care or sorrow; not now did anything\r\nmatter--Olaf or his haunted, hate-filled eyes; Throckmartin or his\r\nfate--nothing of pain, nothing of agony, nothing of striving nor\r\nendeavour nor despair in that wide outer world that had turned\r\nsuddenly to a troubled dream.\r\n\r\nOnce more the first great note pealed out!  Once more it died and from\r\nthe clustered spheres a kaleidoscopic blaze shot as though drawn from\r\nthe majestic sound itself. The many-coloured rays darted across the\r\nwhite waters and sought the face of the irised Veil. As they touched,\r\nit sparkled, flamed, wavered, and shook with fountains of prismatic\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nThe light increased--and in its intensity the silver air darkened.\r\nFaded into shadow that white mosaic of flower-crowned faces set in the\r\namphitheatre of jet, and vast shadows dropped upon the high-flung\r\ntiers and shrouded them. But on the skirts of the rays the fretted\r\nstalls in which we sat with the fair-haired ones blazed out,\r\niridescent, like jewels.\r\n\r\nI was sensible of an acceleration of every pulse; a wild stimulation\r\nof every nerve. I felt myself being lifted above the world--close to\r\nthe threshold of the high gods--soon their essence and their power\r\nwould stream out into me! I glanced at Larry. His eyes were--wild--with\r\nlife!\r\n\r\nI looked at Olaf--and in his face was none of this--only hate, and\r\nhate, and hate.\r\n\r\nThe peacock waves streamed out over the waters, cleaving the seeming\r\ndarkness, a rainbow path of glory. And the Veil flashed as though all\r\nthe rainbows that had ever shone were burning within it. Again the\r\nmighty sound pealed.\r\n\r\nInto the centre of the Veil the light drew itself, grew into an\r\nintolerable brightness--and with a storm of tinklings, a tempest of\r\ncrystalline notes, a tumult of tiny chimings, through it sped--the\r\nShining One!\r\n\r\nStraight down that radiant path, its high-flung plumes of feathery\r\nflame shimmering, its coruscating spirals whirling, its seven globes\r\nof seven colours shining above its glowing core, it raced toward us.\r\nThe hurricane of bells of diamond glass were jubilant, joyous. I felt\r\nO'Keefe grip my arm; Yolara threw her white arms out in a welcoming\r\ngesture; I heard from the tier a sigh of rapture--and in it a\r\npoignant, wailing under-tone of agony!\r\n\r\nOver the waters, down the light stream, to the end of the ivory pier,\r\nflew the Shining One. Through its crystal _pizzicati_ drifted\r\ninarticulate murmurings--deadly sweet, stilling the heart and setting\r\nit leaping madly.\r\n\r\nFor a moment it paused, poised itself, and then came whirling down the\r\nflower path to its priestess, slowly, ever more slowly. It hovered for\r\na moment between the woman and the dwarf, as though contemplating\r\nthem; turned to her with its storm of tinklings softened, its\r\nmurmurings infinitely caressing. Bent toward it, Yolara seemed to\r\ngather within herself pulsing waves of power; she was terrifying;\r\ngloriously, maddeningly evil; and as gloriously, maddeningly heavenly!\r\nAphrodite and the Virgin! Tanith of the Carthaginians and St. Bride of\r\nthe Isles! A queen of hell and a princess of heaven--in one!\r\n\r\nOnly for a moment did that which we had called the Dweller and which\r\nthese named the Shining One, pause. It swept up the ramp to the dais,\r\nrested there, slowly turning, plumes and spirals lacing and unlacing,\r\nthrobbing, pulsing. Now its nucleus grew plainer, stronger--human in a\r\nfashion, and all inhuman; neither man nor woman; neither god nor\r\ndevil; subtly partaking of all. Nor could I doubt that whatever it\r\nwas, within that shining nucleus was something sentient; something\r\nthat had will and energy, and in some awful, supernormal\r\nfashion--intelligence!\r\n\r\nAnother trumpeting--a sound of stones opening--a long, low wail of\r\nutter anguish--something moved shadowy in the river of light, and\r\nslowly at first, then ever more rapidly, shapes swam through it. There\r\nwere half a score of them--girls and youths, women and men. The\r\nShining One poised itself, regarded them. They drew closer, and in the\r\neyes of each and in their faces was the bud of that awful\r\nintermingling of emotions, of joy and sorrow, ecstasy and terror, that\r\nI had seen in full blossom on Throckmartin's.\r\n\r\nThe Thing began again its murmurings--now infinitely caressing,\r\ncoaxing--like the song of a siren from some witched star! And the\r\nbell-sounds rang out--compellingly, calling--calling--calling--\r\n\r\nI saw Olaf lean far out of his place; saw, half-consciously, at\r\nLugur's signal, three of the dwarfs creep in and take places,\r\nunnoticed, behind him.\r\n\r\nNow the first of the figures rushed upon the dais--and paused.  It was\r\nthe girl who had been brought before Yolara when the gnome named\r\nSongar was driven into the nothingness! With all the quickness of\r\nlight a spiral of the Shining One stretched out and encircled her.\r\n\r\nAt its touch there was an infinitely dreadful shrinking and, it\r\nseemed, a simultaneous hurling of herself into its radiance. As it\r\nwrapped its swirls around her, permeated her--the crystal chorus\r\nburst forth--tumultuously; through and through her the radiance\r\npulsed. Began then that infinitely dreadful, but infinitely glorious,\r\nrhythm they called the dance of the Shining One. And as the girl\r\nswirled within its sparkling mists another and another flew into its\r\nembrace, until, at last, the dais was an incredible vision; a mad\r\nstar's Witches' Sabbath; an altar of white faces and bodies gleaming\r\nthrough living flame; transfused with rapture insupportable and horror\r\nthat was hellish--and ever, radiant plumes and spirals expanding, the\r\ncore of the Shining One waxed--growing greater--as it consumed, as it\r\ndrew into and through itself the life-force of these lost ones!\r\n\r\nSo they spun, interlaced--and there began to pulse from them life,\r\nvitality, as though the very essence of nature was filling us. Dimly I\r\nrecognized that what I was beholding was vampirism inconceivable! The\r\nbanked tiers chanted. The mighty sounds pealed forth!\r\n\r\nIt was a Saturnalia of demigods!\r\n\r\nThen, whirling, bell-notes storming, the Shining One withdrew slowly\r\nfrom the dais down the ramp, still embracing, still interwoven with\r\nthose who had thrown themselves into its spirals. They drifted with it\r\nas though half-carried in dreadful dance; white faces sealed--forever--into\r\nthat semblance of those who held within linked God and devil--I\r\ncovered my eyes!\r\n\r\nI heard a gasp from O'Keefe; opened my eyes and sought his; saw the\r\nwildness vanish from them as he strained forward. Olaf had leaned far\r\nout, and as he did so the dwarfs beside him caught him, and whether by\r\ndesign or through his own swift, involuntary movement, thrust him half\r\ninto the Dweller's path. The Dweller paused in its gyrations--seemed\r\nto watch him. The Norseman's face was crimson, his eyes blazing. He\r\nthrew himself back and, with one defiant shout, gripped one of the\r\ndwarfs about the middle and sent him hurtling through the air,\r\nstraight at the radiant Thing! A whirling mass of legs and arms, the\r\ndwarf flew--then in midflight stopped as though some gigantic\r\ninvisible hand had caught him, and--was dashed down upon the platform\r\nnot a yard from the Shining One!\r\n\r\nLike a broken spider he moved--feebly--once, twice. From the Dweller\r\nshot a shimmering tentacle--touched him--recoiled. Its crystal\r\ntinklings changed into an angry chiming. From all about--jewelled\r\nstalls and jet peak--came a sigh of incredulous horror.\r\n\r\nLugur leaped forward.  On the instant Larry was over the low barrier\r\nbetween the pillars, rushing to the Norseman's side. And even as they\r\nran there was another wild shout from Olaf, and he hurled himself out,\r\nstraight at the throat of the Dweller!\r\n\r\nBut before he could touch the Shining One, now motionless--and never\r\nwas the thing more horrible than then, with the purely human\r\nsuggestion of surprise plain in its poise--Larry had struck him\r\naside.\r\n\r\nI tried to follow--and was held by Rador.  He was trembling--but not\r\nwith fear. In his face was incredulous hope, inexplicable eagerness.\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" he said.  \"Wait!\"\r\n\r\nThe Shining One stretched out a slow spiral, and as it did so I saw\r\nthe bravest thing man has ever witnessed. Instantly O'Keefe thrust\r\nhimself between it and Olaf, pistol out. The tentacle touched him, and\r\nthe dull blue of his robe flashed out into blinding, intense azure\r\nlight. From the automatic in his gloved hand came three quick bursts\r\nof flame straight into the Thing. The Dweller drew back; the\r\nbell-sounds swelled.\r\n\r\nLugur paused, his hand darted up, and in it was one of the silver\r\n_Keth_ cones. But before he could flash it upon the Norseman, Larry\r\nhad unlooped his robe, thrown its fold over Olaf, and, holding him\r\nwith one hand away from the Shining One, thrust with the other his\r\npistol into the dwarf's stomach. His lips moved, but I could not hear\r\nwhat he said. But Lugur understood, for his hand dropped.\r\n\r\nNow Yolara was there--all this had taken barely more than five\r\nseconds. She thrust herself between the three men and the Dweller. She\r\nspoke to it--and the wild buzzing died down; the gay crystal tinklings\r\nburst forth again. The Thing murmured to her--began to whirl--faster,\r\nfaster--passed down the ivory pier, out upon the waters, bearing with\r\nit, meshed in its light, the sacrifices--swept on ever more swiftly,\r\ntriumphantly and turning, turning, with its ghastly crew, vanished\r\nthrough the Veil!\r\n\r\nAbruptly the polychromatic path snapped out.  The silver light poured\r\nin upon us. From all the amphitheatre arose a clamour, a shouting.\r\nMarakinoff, his eyes staring, was leaning out, listening. Unrestrained\r\nnow by Rador, I vaulted the wall and rushed forward. But not before I\r\nhad heard the green dwarf murmur:\r\n\r\n\"There is something stronger than the Shining One!  Two things--yea--a\r\nstrong heart--and hate!\"\r\n\r\nOlaf, panting, eyes glazed, trembling, shrank beneath my hand.\r\n\r\n\"The devil that took my Helma!\" I heard him whisper. \"The Shining\r\nDevil!\"\r\n\r\n\"Both these men,\" Lugur was raging, \"they shall dance with the Shining\r\none. And this one, too.\" He pointed at me malignantly.\r\n\r\n\"This man is mine,\" said the priestess, and her voice was menacing.\r\nShe rested her hand on Larry's shoulder. \"He shall not dance. No--nor\r\nhis friend. I have told you I dare not for this one!\" She pointed to\r\nOlaf.\r\n\r\n\"Neither this man, nor this,\" said Larry, \"shall be harmed. This is my\r\nword, Yolara!\"\r\n\r\n\"Even so,\" she answered quietly, \"my lord!\"\r\n\r\nI saw Marakinoff stare at O'Keefe with a new and curiously speculative\r\ninterest. Lugur's eyes grew hellish; he raised his arms as though to\r\nstrike her. Larry's pistol prodded him rudely enough.\r\n\r\n\"No rough stuff now, kid!\" said O'Keefe in English.  The red dwarf\r\nquivered, turned--caught a robe from a priest standing by, and threw\r\nit over himself. The _ladala_, shouting, gesticulating, fighting with\r\nthe soldiers, were jostling down from the tiers of jet.\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" commanded Yolara--her eyes rested upon Larry.  \"Your heart is\r\ngreat, indeed--my lord!\" she murmured; and her voice was very sweet.\r\n\"Come!\"\r\n\r\n\"This man comes with us, Yolara,\" said O'Keefe pointing to Olaf.\r\n\r\n\"Bring him,\" she said.  \"Bring him--only tell him to look no more upon\r\nme as before!\" she added fiercely.\r\n\r\nBeside her the three of us passed along the stalls, where sat the\r\nfair-haired, now silent, at gaze, as though in the grip of some great\r\ndoubt. Silently Olaf strode beside me. Rador had disappeared. Down the\r\nstairway, through the hall of turquoise mist, over the rushing\r\nsea-stream we went and stood beside the wall through which we had\r\nentered. The white-robed ones had gone.\r\n\r\nYolara pressed; the portal opened.  We stepped upon the car; she took\r\nthe lever; we raced through the faintly luminous corridor to the house\r\nof the priestess.\r\n\r\nAnd one thing now I knew sick at heart and soul the truth had come to\r\nme--no more need to search for Throckmartin. Behind that Veil, in the\r\nlair of the Dweller, dead-alive like those we had just seen swim in\r\nits shining train was he, and Edith, Stanton and Thora and Olaf\r\nHuldricksson's wife!\r\n\r\nThe car came to rest; the portal opened; Yolara leaped out lightly,\r\nbeckoned and flitted up the corridor. She paused before an ebon\r\nscreen. At a touch it vanished, revealing an entrance to a small blue\r\nchamber, glowing as though cut from the heart of some gigantic\r\nsapphire; bare, save that in its centre, upon a low pedestal, stood a\r\ngreat globe fashioned from milky rock-crystal; upon its surface were\r\nfaint tracings as of seas and continents, but, if so, either of some\r\nother world or of this world in immemorial past, for in no way did\r\nthey resemble the mapped coastlines of our earth.\r\n\r\nPoised upon the globe, rising from it out into space, locked in each\r\nother's arms, lips to lips, were two figures, a woman and a man, so\r\nexquisite, so lifelike, that for the moment I failed to realize that\r\nthey, too, were carved of the crystal. And before this shrine--for\r\nnothing else could it be, I knew--three slender cones raised\r\nthemselves: one of purest white flame, one of opalescent water, and\r\nthe third of--moonlight! There was no mistaking them, the height of a\r\ntall man each stood--but how water, flame and light were held so\r\nevenly, so steadily in their spire-shapes, I could not tell.\r\n\r\nYolara bowed lowly--once, twice, thrice.  She turned to O'Keefe, nor\r\nby slightest look or gesture betrayed she knew others were there than\r\nhe. The blue eyes wide, searching, unfathomable, she drew close; put\r\nwhite hands on his shoulders, looked down into his very soul.\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" she murmured.  \"Now listen well for I, Yolara, give you\r\nthree things--myself, and the Shining One, and the power that is the\r\nShining One's--yea, and still a fourth thing that is all three--power\r\nover all upon that world from whence you came! These, my lord, ye\r\nshall have. I swear it\"--she turned toward the altar--uplifted her\r\narms--\"by Siya and by Siyana, and by the flame, by the water, and by\r\nthe light!\"[1]\r\n\r\nHer eyes grew purple dark.\r\n\r\n\"Let none dare to take you from me!  Nor ye go from me unbidden!\" she\r\nwhispered fiercely.\r\n\r\nThen swiftly, still ignoring us, she threw her arms about O'Keefe,\r\npressed her white body to his breast, lips raised, eyes closed,\r\nseeking his. O'Keefe's arms tightened around her, his head dropped\r\nlips seeking, finding hers--passionately! From Olaf came a deep\r\nindrawn breath that was almost a groan. But not in my heart could I\r\nfind blame for the Irishman!\r\n\r\nThe priestess opened eyes now all misty blue, thrust him back, stood\r\nregarding him. O'Keefe, dead-white, raised a trembling hand to his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"And thus have I sealed my oath, O my lord!\" she whispered.  For the\r\nfirst time she seemed to recognize our presence, stared at us a\r\nmoment, then through us, and turned to O'Keefe.\r\n\r\n\"Go, now!\" she said.  \"Soon Rador shall come for you. Then--well,\r\nafter that let happen what will!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nShe smiled once more at him--so sweetly; turned toward the figures\r\nupon the great globe; sank upon her knees before them. Quietly we\r\ncrept away; still silent, made our way to the little pavilion. But as\r\nwe passed we heard a tumult from the green roadway; shouts of men, now\r\nand then a woman's scream. Through a rift in the garden I glimpsed a\r\njostling crowd on one of the bridges: green dwarfs struggling with the\r\n_ladala_--and all about droned a humming as of a giant hive disturbed!\r\n\r\nLarry threw himself down upon one of the divans, covered his face with\r\nhis hands, dropped them to catch in Olaf's eyes troubled reproach,\r\nlooked at me.\r\n\r\n\"_I_ couldn't help it,\" he said, half defiantly--half-miserably.\r\n\"God, what a woman! I _couldn't_ help it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Larry,\" I asked.  \"Why didn't you tell her you didn't love\r\nher--then?\"\r\n\r\nHe gazed at me--the old twinkle back in his eye.\r\n\r\n\"Spoken like a scientist, Doc!\" he exclaimed.  \"I suppose if a burning\r\nangel struck you out of nowhere and threw itself about you, you would\r\nmost dignifiedly tell it you didn't want to be burned. For God's sake,\r\ndon't talk nonsense, Goodwin!\" he ended, almost peevishly.\r\n\r\n\"Evil!  Evil!\" The Norseman's voice was deep, nearly a chant.  \"All\r\nhere is of evil: Trolldom and Helvede it is, Ja! And that she\r\n_djaevelsk_ of beauty--what is she but harlot of that shining devil\r\nthey worship. I, Olaf Huldricksson, know what she meant when she held\r\nout to you power over all the world, _Ja!_--as if the world had not\r\ndevils enough in it now!\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" The cry came from both O'Keefe and myself at once.\r\n\r\nOlaf made a gesture of caution, relapsed into sullen silence.  There\r\nwere footsteps on the path, and into sight came Rador--but a Rador\r\nchanged. Gone was every vestige of his mockery; curiously solemn, he\r\nsaluted O'Keefe and Olaf with that salute which, before this, I had\r\nseen given only to Yolara and to Lugur. There came a swift quickening\r\nof the tumult--died away. He shrugged mighty shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"The _ladala_ are awake!\" he said.  \"So much for what two brave men\r\ncan do!\" He paused thoughtfully. \"Bones and dust jostle not each other\r\nfor place against the grave wall!\" he added oddly. \"But if bones and\r\ndust have revealed to them that they still--live--\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped abruptly, eyes seeking the globe that bore and sent forth\r\nspeech.[2]\r\n\r\n\"The _Afyo Maie_ has sent me to watch over you till she summons you,\"\r\nhe announced clearly. \"There is to be a--feast. You, _Larree_, you\r\nGoodwin, are to come. I remain here with--Olaf.\"\r\n\r\n\"No harm to him!\" broke in O'Keefe sharply.  Rador touched his heart,\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n\"By the Ancient Ones, and by my love for you, and by what you twain\r\ndid before the Shining One--I swear it!\" he whispered.\r\n\r\nRador clapped palms; a soldier came round the path, in his grip a long\r\nflat box of polished wood. The green dwarf took it, dismissed him,\r\nthrew open the lid.\r\n\r\n\"Here is your apparel for the feast, _Larree_,\" he said, pointing to\r\nthe contents.\r\n\r\nO'Keefe stared, reached down and drew out a white, shimmering, softly\r\nmetallic, long-sleeved tunic, a broad, silvery girdle, leg swathings\r\nof the same argent material, and sandals that seemed to be cut out\r\nfrom silver. He made a quick gesture of angry dissent.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, _Larree_!\" muttered the dwarf.  \"Wear them--I counsel it--I pray\r\nit--ask me not why,\" he went on swiftly, looking again at the globe.\r\n\r\nO'Keefe, as I, was impressed by his earnestness.  The dwarf made a\r\ncuriously expressive pleading gesture. O'Keefe abruptly took the\r\ngarments; passed into the room of the fountain.\r\n\r\n\"The Shining One dances not again?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said.  \"No\"--he hesitate--\"it is the usual feast that follows\r\nthe sacrament! Lugur--and Double Tongue, who came with you, will be\r\nthere,\" he added slowly.\r\n\r\n\"Lugur--\" I gasped in astonishment.  \"After what happened--he will be\r\nthere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps because of what happened, Goodwin, my friend,\" he\r\nanswered--his eyes again full of malice; \"and there will be\r\nothers--friends of Yolara--friends of Lugur--and perhaps\r\nanother\"--his voice was almost inaudible--\"one whom they have not\r\ncalled--\" He halted, half-fearfully, glancing at the globe; put finger\r\nto lips and spread himself out upon one of the couches.\r\n\r\n\"Strike up the band\"--came O'Keefe's voice--\"here comes the hero!\"\r\n\r\nHe strode into the room.  I am bound to say that the admiration in\r\nRador's eyes was reflected in my own, and even, if involuntarily, in\r\nOlaf's.\r\n\r\n\"A son of Siyana!\" whispered Rador.\r\n\r\nHe knelt, took from his girdle-pouch a silk-wrapped something, unwound\r\nit--and, still kneeling, drew out a slender poniard of gleaming white\r\nmetal, hilted with the blue stones; he thrust it into O'Keefe's\r\ngirdle; then gave him again the rare salute.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" he ordered and took us to the head of the pathway.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" he said grimly, \"let the Silent Ones show their power--if they\r\nstill have it!\"\r\n\r\nAnd with this strange benediction, he turned back.\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake, Larry,\" I urged as we approached the house of the\r\npriestess, \"you'll be careful!\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded--but I saw with a little deadly pang of apprehension in my\r\nheart a puzzled, lurking doubt within his eyes.\r\n\r\nAs we ascended the serpent steps Marakinoff appeared. He gave a signal\r\nto our guards--and I wondered what influence the Russian had attained,\r\nfor promptly, without question, they drew aside. At me he smiled\r\namiably.\r\n\r\n\"Have you found your friends yet?\" he went on--and now I sensed\r\nsomething deeply sinister in him. \"No! It is too bad! Well, don't give\r\nup hope.\" He turned to O'Keefe.\r\n\r\n\"Lieutenant, I would like to speak to you--alone!\"\r\n\r\n\"I've no secrets from Goodwin,\" answered O'Keefe.\r\n\r\n\"So?\" queried Marakinoff, suavely.  He bent, whispered to Larry.\r\n\r\nThe Irishman started, eyed him with a certain shocked incredulity,\r\nthen turned to me.\r\n\r\n\"Just a minute, Doc!\" he said, and I caught the suspicion of a wink.\r\nThey drew aside, out of ear-shot. The Russian talked rapidly. Larry\r\nwas all attention. Marakinoff's earnestness became intense; O'Keefe\r\ninterrupted--appeared to question. Marakinoff glanced at me and as his\r\ngaze shifted from O'Keefe, I saw a flame of rage and horror blaze up\r\nin the latter's eyes. At last the Irishman appeared to consider\r\ngravely; nodded as though he had arrived at some decision, and\r\nMarakinoff thrust his hand to him.\r\n\r\nAnd only I could have noticed Larry's shrinking, his microscopic\r\nhesitation before he took it, and his involuntary movement, as though\r\nto shake off something unclean, when the clasp had ended.\r\n\r\nMarakinoff, without another look at me, turned and went quickly\r\nwithin. The guards took their places. I looked at Larry inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\"Don't ask a thing now, Doc!\" he said tensely.  \"Wait till we get\r\nhome. But we've got to get damned busy and quick--I'll tell you that\r\nnow--\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] I have no space here even to outline the eschatology of this\r\npeople, nor to catalogue their pantheon. Siya and Siyana typified\r\nworldly love. Their ritual was, however, singularly free from those\r\ndegrading elements usually found in love-cults. Priests and\r\npriestesses of all cults dwelt in the immense seven-terraced\r\nstructure, of which the jet amphitheatre was the water side. The\r\nsymbol, icon, representation, of Siya and Siyana--the globe and the\r\nup-striving figures--typified earthly love, feet bound to earth, but\r\neyes among the stars. Hell or heaven I never heard formulated, nor\r\ntheir equivalents; unless that existence in the Shining One's domain\r\ncould serve for either. Over all this was Thanaroa, remote; unheeding,\r\nbut still maker and ruler of all--an absentee First Cause personified!\r\nThanaroa seemed to be the one article of belief in the creed of the\r\nsoldiers--Rador, with his reverence for the Ancient Ones, was an\r\nexception. Whatever there was, indeed, of high, truly religious\r\nimpulse among the Murians, this far, High God had. I found this\r\nexceedingly interesting, because it had long been my theory--to put\r\nthe matter in the shape of a geometrical formula--that the real\r\nattractiveness of gods to man increases uniformly according to the\r\nsquare of their distance--W. T. G.\r\n\r\n[2] I find that I have neglected to explain the working of these\r\ninteresting mechanisms that were telephonic, dictaphonic, telegraphic\r\nin one. I must assume that my readers are familiar with the receiving\r\napparatus of wireless telegraphy, which must be \"tuned\" by the\r\noperator until its own vibratory quality is in exact harmony with the\r\nvibrations--the extremely rapid impacts--of those short electric\r\nwavelengths we call Hertzian, and which carry the wireless messages. I\r\nmust assume also that they are familiar with the elementary fact of\r\nphysics that the vibrations of light and sound are interchangeable.\r\nThe hearing-talking globes utilize both these principles, and with\r\nconsummate simplicity. The light with which they shone was produced by\r\nan atomic \"motor\" within their base, similar to that which activated\r\nthe merely illuminating globes. The composition of the phonic spheres\r\ngave their surfaces an acute sensitivity and resonance. In conjunction\r\nwith its energizing power, the metal set up what is called a \"field of\r\nforce,\" which linked it with every particle of its kind no matter how\r\ndistant. When vibrations of speech impinged upon the resonant surface\r\nits rhythmic light-vibrations were broken, just as a telephone\r\ntransmitter breaks an electric current. Simultaneously these\r\nlight-vibrations were changed into sound--on the surfaces of all\r\nspheres tuned to that particular instrument. The \"crawling\" colours\r\nwhich showed themselves at these times were literally the voice of the\r\nspeaker in its spectrum equivalent. While usually the sounds produced\r\nrequired considerable familiarity with the apparatus to be understood\r\nquickly, they could, on occasion, be made startlingly loud and\r\nclear--as I was soon to realize--W. T. G.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nThe Tempting of Larry\r\n\r\nWe paused before thick curtains, through which came the faint murmur\r\nof many voices. They parted; out came two--ushers, I suppose, they\r\nwere--in cuirasses and kilts that reminded me somewhat of\r\nchain-mail--the first armour of any kind here that I had seen. They\r\nheld open the folds.\r\n\r\nThe chamber, on whose threshold we stood, was far larger than either\r\nanteroom or hall of audience. Not less than three hundred feet long\r\nand half that in depth, from end to end of it ran two huge\r\nsemi-circular tables, paralleling each other, divided by a wide aisle,\r\nand heaped with flowers, with fruits, with viands unknown to me, and\r\nglittering with crystal flagons, beakers, goblets of as many hues as\r\nthe blooms. On the gay-cushioned couches that flanked the tables,\r\nlounging luxuriously, were scores of the fair-haired ruling class and\r\nthere rose a little buzz of admiration, oddly mixed with a\r\nhalf-startled amaze, as their gaze fell upon O'Keefe in all his\r\nsilvery magnificence. Everywhere the light-giving globes sent their\r\nroseate radiance.\r\n\r\nThe cuirassed dwarfs led us through the aisle.  Within the arc of the\r\ninner half--circle was another glittering board, an oval. But of those\r\nseated there, facing us--I had eyes for only one--Yolara! She swayed\r\nup to greet O'Keefe--and she was like one of those white lily maids,\r\nwhose beauty Hoang-Ku, the sage, says made the Gobi first a paradise,\r\nand whose lusts later the burned-out desert that it is. She held out\r\nhands to Larry, and on her face was passion--unashamed, unhiding.\r\n\r\nShe was Circe--but Circe conquered.  Webs of filmiest white clung to\r\nthe rose-leaf body. Twisted through the corn-silk hair a threaded\r\ncirclet of pale sapphires shone; but they were pale beside Yolara's\r\neyes. O'Keefe bent, kissed her hands, something more than mere\r\nadmiration flaming from him. She saw--and, smiling, drew him down\r\nbeside her.\r\n\r\nIt came to me that of all, only these two, Yolara and O'Keefe, were in\r\nwhite--and I wondered; then with a tightening of nerves ceased to\r\nwonder as there entered--Lugur! He was all in scarlet, and as he\r\nstrode forward a silence fell a tense, strained silence.\r\n\r\nHis gaze turned upon Yolara, rested upon O'Keefe, and instantly his\r\nface grew--dreadful--there is no other word than that for it.\r\nMarakinoff leaned forward from the centre of the table, near whose end\r\nI sat, touched and whispered to him swiftly. With appalling effort the\r\nred dwarf controlled himself; he saluted the priestess ironically, I\r\nthought; took his place at the further end of the oval. And now I\r\nnoted that the figures between were the seven of that Council of which\r\nthe Shining One's priestess and Voice were the heads. The tension\r\nrelaxed, but did not pass--as though a storm-cloud should turn away,\r\nbut still lurk, threatening.\r\n\r\nMy gaze ran back.  This end of the room was draped with the\r\nexquisitely coloured, graceful curtains looped with gorgeous garlands.\r\nBetween curtains and table, where sat Larry and the nine, a circular\r\nplatform, perhaps ten yards in diameter, raised itself a few feet\r\nabove the floor, its gleaming surface half-covered with the luminous\r\npetals, fragrant, delicate.\r\n\r\nOn each side below it, were low carven stools.  The curtains parted\r\nand softly entered girls bearing their flutes, their harps, the\r\ncuriously emotion-exciting, octaved drums. They sank into their\r\nplaces. They touched their instruments; a faint, languorous measure\r\nthrobbed through the rosy air.\r\n\r\nThe stage was set!  What was to be the play?\r\n\r\nNow about the tables passed other dusky-haired maids, fair bosoms\r\nbare, their scanty kirtles looped high, pouring out the wines for the\r\nfeasters.\r\n\r\nMy eyes sought O'Keefe.  Whatever it had been that Marakinoff had\r\nsaid, clearly it now filled his mind--even to the exclusion of the\r\nwondrous woman beside him. His eyes were stern, cold--and now and\r\nthen, as he turned them toward the Russian, filled with a curious\r\nspeculation. Yolara watched him, frowned, gave a low order to the Hebe\r\nbehind her.\r\n\r\nThe girl disappeared, entered again with a ewer that seemed cut of\r\namber. The priestess poured from it into Larry's glass a clear liquid\r\nthat shook with tiny sparkles of light. She raised the glass to her\r\nlips, handed it to him. Half-smiling, half-abstractedly, he took it,\r\ntouched his own lips where hers had kissed; drained it. A nod from\r\nYolara and the maid refilled his goblet.\r\n\r\nAt once there was a swift transformation in the Irishman. His\r\nabstraction vanished; the sternness fled; his eyes sparkled. He leaned\r\ncaressingly toward Yolara; whispered. Her blue eyes flashed\r\ntriumphantly; her chiming laughter rang. She raised her own glass--but\r\nwithin it was not that clear drink that filled Larry's! And again he\r\ndrained his own; and, lifting it, full once more, caught the baleful\r\neyes of Lugur, and held it toward him mockingly. Yolara swayed\r\nclose--alluring, tempting. He arose, face all reckless gaiety; rollicking\r\ndeviltry.\r\n\r\n\"A toast!\" he cried in English, \"to the Shining One--and may the hell\r\nwhere it belongs soon claim it!\"\r\n\r\nHe had used their own word for their god--all else had been in his own\r\ntongue, and so, fortunately, they did not understand. But the contempt\r\nin his action they did recognize--and a dead, a fearful silence fell\r\nupon them all. Lugur's eyes blazed, little sparks of crimson in their\r\ngreen. The priestess reached up, caught at O'Keefe. He seized the soft\r\nhand; caressed it; his gaze grew far away, sombre.\r\n\r\n\"The Shining One.\" He spoke low.  \"An' now again I see the faces of\r\nthose who dance with it. It is the Fires of Mora--come, God alone\r\nknows how--from Erin--to this place. The Fires of Mora!\" He\r\ncontemplated the hushed folk before him; and then from his lips came\r\nthat weirdest, most haunting of the lyric legends of Erin--the Curse\r\nof Mora:\r\n\r\n    \"The fretted fires of Mora blew o'er him in the night;\r\n    He thrills no more to loving, nor weeps for past delight.\r\n    For when those flames have bitten, both grief and joy take flight--\"\r\n\r\nAgain Yolara tried to draw him down beside her; and once more he\r\ngripped her hand. His eyes grew fixed--he crooned:\r\n\r\n    \"And through the sleeping silence his feet must track the tune,\r\n    When the world is barred and speckled with silver of the moon--\"\r\n\r\nHe stood, swaying, for a moment, and then, laughing, let the priestess\r\nhave her way; drained again the glass.\r\n\r\nAnd now my heart was cold, indeed--for what hope was there left with\r\nLarry mad, wild drunk!\r\n\r\nThe silence was unbroken--elfin women and dwarfs glancing furtively at\r\neach other. But now Yolara arose, face set, eyes flashing grey.\r\n\r\n\"Hear you, the Council, and you, Lugur--and all who are here!\" she\r\ncried. \"Now I, the priestess of the Shining One, take, as is my right,\r\nmy mate. And this is he!\" She pointed down upon Larry. He glanced up\r\nat her.\r\n\r\n\"Can't quite make out what you say, Yolara,\" he muttered thickly.\r\n\"But say anything--you like--I love your voice!\"\r\n\r\nI turned sick with dread.  Yolara's hand stole softly upon the\r\nIrishman's curls caressingly.\r\n\r\n\"You know the law, Yolara.\" Lugur's voice was flat, deadly, \"You may\r\nnot mate with other than your own kind. And this man is a stranger--a\r\nbarbarian--food for the Shining One!\" Literally, he spat the phrase.\r\n\r\n\"No, not of our kind--Lugur--higher!\" Yolara answered serenely.  \"Lo,\r\na son of Siya and of Siyana!\"\r\n\r\n\"A lie!\" roared the red dwarf.  \"A lie!\"\r\n\r\n\"The Shining One revealed it to me!\" said Yolara sweetly. \"And if ye\r\nbelieve not, Lugur--go ask of the Shining One if it be not truth!\"\r\n\r\nThere was bitter, nameless menace in those last words--and whatever\r\ntheir hidden message to Lugur, it was potent. He stood, choking, face\r\nhell-shadowed--Marakinoff leaned out again, whispered. The red dwarf\r\nbowed, now wholly ironically; resumed his place and his silence. And\r\nagain I wondered, icy-hearted, what was the power the Russian had so\r\nto sway Lugur.\r\n\r\n\"What says the Council?\" Yolara demanded, turning to them.\r\n\r\nOnly for a moment they consulted among themselves. Then the woman,\r\nwhose face was a ravaged shrine of beauty, spoke.\r\n\r\n\"The will of the priestess is the will of the Council!\" she answered.\r\n\r\nDefiance died from Yolara's face; she looked down at Larry tenderly.\r\nHe sat swaying, crooning.\r\n\r\n\"Bid the priests come,\" she commanded, then turned to the silent room.\r\n\"By the rites of Siya and Siyana, Yolara takes their son for her\r\nmate!\" And again her hand stole down possessingly, serpent soft, to\r\nthe drunken head of the O'Keefe.\r\n\r\nThe curtains parted widely.  Through them filed, two by two, twelve\r\nhooded figures clad in flowing robes of the green one sees in forest\r\nvistas of opening buds of dawning spring. Of each pair one bore\r\nclasped to breast a globe of that milky crystal in the sapphire\r\nshrine-room; the other a harp, small, shaped somewhat like the ancient\r\nclarsach of the Druids.\r\n\r\nTwo by two they stepped upon the raised platform, placed gently upon\r\nit each their globe; and two by two crouched behind them. They formed\r\nnow a star of six points about the petalled dais, and, simultaneously,\r\nthey drew from their faces the covering cowls.\r\n\r\nI half-rose--youths and maidens these of the fair-haired; and youths\r\nand maids more beautiful than any of those I had yet seen--for upon\r\ntheir faces was little of that disturbing mockery to which I have been\r\nforced so often, because of the deep impression it made upon me, to\r\nrefer. The ashen-gold of the maiden priestesses' hair was wound about\r\ntheir brows in shining coronals. The pale locks of the youths were\r\nclustered within circlets of translucent, glimmering gems like\r\nmoonstones. And then, crystal globe alternately before and harp\r\nalternately held by youth and maid, they began to sing.\r\n\r\nWhat was that song, I do not know--nor ever shall. Archaic, ancient\r\nbeyond thought, it seemed--not with the ancientness of things that for\r\nuncounted ages have been but wind-driven dust. Rather was it the\r\nancientness of the golden youth of the world, love lilts of earth\r\nyounglings, with light of new-born suns drenching them, chorals of\r\nyoung stars mating in space; murmurings of April gods and goddesses. A\r\nlanguor stole through me. The rosy lights upon the tripods began to\r\ndie away, and as they faded the milky globes gleamed forth brighter,\r\never brighter. Yolara rose, stretched a hand to Larry, led him through\r\nthe sextuple groups, and stood face to face with him in the centre of\r\ntheir circle.\r\n\r\nThe rose-light died; all that immense chamber was black, save for the\r\ncircle of the glowing spheres. Within this their milky radiance grew\r\nbrighter--brighter. The song whispered away. A throbbing arpeggio\r\ndripped from the harps, and as the notes pulsed out, up from the\r\nglobes, as though striving to follow, pulsed with them tips of\r\nmoon-fire cones, such as I had seen before Yolara's altar. Weirdly,\r\ncaressingly, compellingly the harp notes throbbed in repeated,\r\nre-repeated theme, holding within itself the same archaic golden\r\nquality I had noted in the singing. And over the moon flame pinnacles\r\nrose higher!\r\n\r\nYolara lifted her arms; within her hands were clasped O'Keefe's.  She\r\nraised them above their two heads and slowly, slowly drew him with her\r\ninto a circling, graceful step, tendrillings delicate as the slow\r\nspirallings of twilight mist upon some still stream.\r\n\r\nAs they swayed the rippling arpeggios grew louder, and suddenly the\r\nslender pinnacles of moon fire bent, dipped, flowed to the floor,\r\ncrept in a shining ring around those two--and began to rise, a\r\ngleaming, glimmering, enchanted barrier--rising, ever rising--hiding\r\nthem!\r\n\r\nWith one swift movement Yolara unbound her circlet of pale sapphires,\r\nshook loose the waves of her silken hair. It fell, a rippling,\r\nwondrous cascade, veiling both her and O'Keefe to their girdles--and\r\nnow the shining coils of moon fire had crept to their knees--was\r\ncircling higher--higher.\r\n\r\nAnd ever despair grew deeper in my soul!\r\n\r\nWhat was that!  I started to my feet, and all around me in the\r\ndarkness I heard startled motion. From without came a blaring of\r\ntrumpets, the sound of running men, loud murmurings. The tumult drew\r\ncloser. I heard cries of \"Lakla! Lakla!\" Now it was at the very\r\nthreshold and within it, oddly, as though--punctuating--the clamour, a\r\ndeep-toned, almost abysmal, booming sound--thunderously bass and\r\nreverberant.\r\n\r\nAbruptly the harpings ceased; the moon fires shuddered, fell, and\r\nbegan to sweep back into the crystal globes; Yolara's swaying form\r\ngrew rigid, every atom of it listening. She threw aside the veiling\r\ncloud of hair, and in the gleam of the last retreating spirals her\r\nface glared out like some old Greek mask of tragedy.\r\n\r\nThe sweet lips that even at their sweetest could never lose their\r\ndelicate cruelty, had no sweetness now. They were drawn into a\r\nsquare--inhuman as that of the Medusa; in her eyes were the fires of\r\nthe pit, and her hair seemed to writhe like the serpent locks of that\r\nGorgon whose mouth she had borrowed; all her beauty was transformed\r\ninto a nameless thing--hideous, inhuman, blasting! If this was the\r\ntrue soul of Yolara springing to her face, then, I thought, God help\r\nus in very deed!\r\n\r\nI wrested my gaze away to O'Keefe.  All drunkenness gone, himself\r\nagain, he was staring down at her, and in his eyes were loathing and\r\nhorror unutterable. So they stood--and the light fled.\r\n\r\nOnly for a moment did the darkness hold.  With lightning swiftness the\r\nblackness that was the chamber's other wall vanished. Through a portal\r\nopen between grey screens, the silver sparkling radiance poured.\r\n\r\nAnd through the portal marched, two by two, incredible, nightmare\r\nfigures--frog-men, giants, taller by nearly a yard than even tall\r\nO'Keefe! Their enormous saucer eyes were irised by wide bands of\r\ngreen-flecked red, in which the phosphorescence flickered. Their long\r\nmuzzles, lips half-open in monstrous grin, held rows of glistening,\r\nslender, lancet sharp fangs. Over the glaring eyes arose a horny\r\nhelmet, a carapace of black and orange scales, studded with foot-long\r\nlance-headed horns.\r\n\r\nThey lined themselves like soldiers on each side of the wide table\r\naisle, and now I could see that their horny armour covered shoulders\r\nand backs, ran across the chest in a knobbed cuirass, and at wrists\r\nand heels jutted out into curved, murderous spurs. The webbed hands\r\nand feet ended in yellow, spade-shaped claws.\r\n\r\nThey carried spears, ten feet, at least, in length, the heads of which\r\nwere pointed cones, glistening with that same covering, from whose\r\ntouch of swift decay I had so narrowly saved Rador.\r\n\r\nThey were grotesque, yes--more grotesque than anything I had ever seen\r\nor dreamed, and they were--terrible!\r\n\r\nAnd then, quietly, through their ranks came--a girl!  Behind her,\r\nenormous pouch at his throat swelling in and out menacingly, in one\r\npaw a treelike, spike-studded mace, a frog-man, huger than any of the\r\nothers, guarding. But of him I caught but a fleeting, involuntary\r\nimpression--all my gaze was for her.\r\n\r\nFor it was she who had pointed out to us the way from the peril of the\r\nDweller's lair on Nan-Tauach. And as I looked at her, I marvelled that\r\never could I have thought the priestess more beautiful. Into the eyes\r\nof O'Keefe rushed joy and an utter abasement of shame.\r\n\r\nAnd from all about came murmurs--edged with anger, half-incredulous,\r\ntinged with fear:\r\n\r\n\"Lakla!\"\r\n\r\n\"Lakla!\"\r\n\r\n\"The handmaiden!\"\r\n\r\nShe halted close beside me.  From firm little chin to dainty buskined\r\nfeet she was swathed in the soft robes of dull, almost coppery hue.\r\nThe left arm was hidden, the right free and gloved. Wound tight about\r\nit was one of the vines of the sculptured wall and of Lugur's circled\r\nsignet-ring. Thick, a vivid green, its five tendrils ran between her\r\nfingers, stretching out five flowered heads that gleamed like blossoms\r\ncut from gigantic, glowing rubies.\r\n\r\nSo she stood contemplating Yolara.  Then drawn perhaps by my gaze, she\r\ndropped her eyes upon me; golden, translucent, with tiny flecks of\r\namber in their aureate irises, the soul that looked through them was\r\nas far removed from that flaming out of the priestess as zenith is\r\nabove nadir.\r\n\r\nI noted the low, broad brow, the proud little nose, the tender mouth,\r\nand the soft--sunlight--glow that seemed to transfuse the delicate\r\nskin. And suddenly in the eyes dawned a smile--sweet, friendly, a\r\ntouch of roguishness, profoundly reassuring in its all humanness. I\r\nfelt my heart expand as though freed from fetters, a recrudescence of\r\nconfidence in the essential reality of things--as though in nightmare\r\nthe struggling consciousness should glimpse some familiar face and\r\nknow the terrors with which it strove were but dreams. And\r\ninvoluntarily I smiled back at her.\r\n\r\nShe raised her head and looked again at Yolara, contempt and a certain\r\ncuriosity in her gaze; at O'Keefe--and through the softened eyes\r\ndrifted swiftly a shadow of sorrow, and on its fleeting wings deepest\r\ninterest, and hovering over that a naive approval as reassuringly\r\nhuman as had been her smile.\r\n\r\nShe spoke, and her voice, deep-timbred, liquid gold as was Yolara's\r\nall silver, was subtly the synthesis of all the golden glowing beauty\r\nof her.\r\n\r\n\"The Silent Ones have sent me, O Yolara,\" she said.  \"And this is\r\ntheir command to you--that you deliver to me to bring before them\r\nthree of the four strangers who have found their way here. For him\r\nthere who plots with Lugur\"--she pointed at Marakinoff, and I saw\r\nYolara start--\"they have no need. Into his heart the Silent Ones have\r\nlooked; and Lugur and you may keep him, Yolara!\"\r\n\r\nThere was honeyed venom in the last words.\r\n\r\nYolara was herself now; only the edge of shrillness on her voice\r\nrevealed her wrath as she answered.\r\n\r\n\"And whence have the Silent Ones gained power to command, _choya_?\"\r\n\r\nThis last, I knew, was a very vulgar word; I had heard Rador use it in\r\na moment of anger to one of the serving maids, and it meant,\r\napproximately, \"kitchen girl,\" \"scullion.\" Beneath the insult and the\r\nacid disdain, the blood rushed up under Lakla's ambered ivory skin.\r\n\r\n\"Yolara\"--her voice was low--\"of no use is it to question me. I am but\r\nthe messenger of the Silent Ones. And one thing only am I bidden to\r\nask you--do you deliver to me the three strangers?\"\r\n\r\nLugur was on his feet; eagerness, sardonic delight, sinister\r\nanticipation thrilling from him--and my same glance showed Marakinoff,\r\ncrouched, biting his finger-nails, glaring at the Golden Girl.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" Yolara spat the word.  \"No!  Now by Thanaroa and by the Shining\r\nOne, no!\" Her eyes blazed, her nostrils were wide, in her fair throat\r\na little pulse beat angrily. \"You, Lakla--take you my message to the\r\nSilent Ones. Say to them that I keep this man\"--she pointed to\r\nLarry--\"because he is mine. Say to them that I keep the yellow-haired\r\none and him\"--she pointed to me--\"because it pleases me.\r\n\r\n\"Tell them that upon their mouths I place my foot, so!\"--she stamped\r\nupon the dais viciously--\"and that in their faces I spit!\"--and her\r\naction was hideously snakelike. \"And say last to them, you handmaiden,\r\nthat if _you_ they dare send to Yolara again, she will feed _you_ to\r\nthe Shining One! Now--go!\"\r\n\r\nThe handmaiden's face was white.\r\n\r\n\"Not unforeseen by the three was this, Yolara,\" she replied.  \"And did\r\nyou speak as you have spoken then was I bidden to say this to you.\"\r\nHer voice deepened. \"Three _tal_ have you to take counsel, Yolara. And\r\nat the end of that time these things must you have determined--either\r\nto do or not to do: first, send the strangers to the Silent Ones;\r\nsecond, give up, you and Lugur and all of you, that dream you have of\r\nconquest of the world without; and, third, forswear the Shining One!\r\nAnd if you do not one and all these things, then are you done, your\r\ncup of life broken, your wine of life spilled. Yea, Yolara, for you\r\nand the Shining One, Lugur and the Nine and all those here and their\r\nkind shall pass! This say the Silent Ones, 'Surely shall all of ye\r\npass and be as though never had ye been!'\"\r\n\r\nNow a gasp of rage and fear arose from all those around me--but the\r\npriestess threw back her head and laughed loud and long. Into the\r\nsilver sweet chiming of her laughter clashed that of Lugur--and after\r\na little the nobles took it up, till the whole chamber echoed with\r\ntheir mirth. O'Keefe, lips tightening, moved toward the Handmaiden,\r\nand almost imperceptibly, but peremptorily, she waved him back.\r\n\r\n\"Those _are_ great words--great words indeed, _choya_,\" shrilled Yolara\r\nat last; and again Lakla winced beneath the word. \"Lo, for _laya_ upon\r\n_laya_, the Shining One has been freed from the Three; and for _laya_\r\nupon _laya_ they have sat helpless, rotting. Now I ask you\r\nagain--whence comes their power to lay their will upon me, and whence\r\ncomes their strength to wrestle with the Shining One and the beloved\r\nof the Shining One?\"\r\n\r\nAnd again she laughed--and again Lugur and all the fairhaired joined\r\nin her laughter.\r\n\r\nInto the eyes of Lakla I saw creep a doubt, a wavering; as though deep\r\nwithin her the foundations of her own belief were none too firm.\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, turning upon O'Keefe gaze in which rested more than\r\nsuggestion of appeal! And Yolara saw, too, for she flushed with\r\ntriumph, stretched a finger toward the handmaiden.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" she cried.  \"Look!  Why, even _she_ does not believe!\" Her\r\nvoice grew silk of silver--merciless, cruel. \"Now am I minded to send\r\nanother answer to the Silent Ones. Yea! But not by _you_, Lakla; by\r\nthese\"--she pointed to the frog-men, and, swift as light, her hand\r\ndarted into her bosom, bringing forth the little shining cone of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nBut before she could level it the Golden Girl had released that hidden\r\nleft arm and thrown over her face a fold of the metallic swathings.\r\nSwifter than Yolara, she raised the arm that held the vine--and now I\r\nknew this was no inert blossoming thing.\r\n\r\nIt was alive!\r\n\r\nIt writhed down her arm, and its five rubescent flower heads thrust\r\nout toward the priestess--vibrating, quivering, held in leash only by\r\nthe light touch of the handmaiden at its very end.\r\n\r\nFrom the swelling throat pouch of the monster behind her came a\r\nsuccession of the reverberant boomings. The frogmen wheeled, raised\r\ntheir lances, levelled them at the throng. Around the reaching ruby\r\nflowers a faint red mist swiftly grew.\r\n\r\nThe silver cone dropped from Yolara's rigid fingers; her eyes grew\r\nstark with horror; all her unearthly loveliness fled from her; she\r\nstood pale-lipped. The Handmaiden dropped the protecting veil--and now\r\nit was she who laughed.\r\n\r\n\"It would seem, then, Yolara, that there _is_ a thing of the Silent Ones\r\nye fear!\" she said. \"Well--the kiss of the _Yekta_ I promise you in\r\nreturn for the embrace of your Shining One.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at Larry, long, searchingly, and suddenly again with all\r\nthat effect of sunlight bursting into dark places, her smile shone\r\nupon him. She nodded, half gaily; looked down upon me, the little\r\nmerry light dancing in her eyes; waved her hand to me.\r\n\r\nShe spoke to the giant frog-man.  He wheeled behind her as she turned,\r\nfacing the priestess, club upraised, fangs glistening. His troop moved\r\nnot a jot, spears held high. Lakla began to pass slowly--almost, I\r\nthought, tauntingly--and as she reached the portal Larry leaped from\r\nthe dais.\r\n\r\n\"_Alanna_!\" he cried.  \"You'll not be leavin' me just when I've found\r\nyou!\"\r\n\r\nIn his excitement he spoke in his own tongue, the velvet brogue\r\nappealing. Lakla turned, contemplated O'Keefe, hesitant,\r\nunquestionably longingly, irresistibly like a child making up her mind\r\nwhether she dared or dared not take a delectable something offered\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"I go with you,\" said O'Keefe, this time in her own speech.  \"Come on,\r\nDoc!\" He reached out a hand to me.\r\n\r\nBut now Yolara spoke.  Life and beauty had flowed back into her face,\r\nand in the purple eyes all her hosts of devils were gathered.\r\n\r\n\"Do you forget what I promised you before Siya and Siyana?  And do you\r\nthink that you can leave me--me--as though I were a _choya_--like\r\n_her_.\" She pointed to Lakla. \"Do you--\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, listen, Yolara,\" Larry interrupted almost plaintively.  \"No\r\npromise has passed from me to you--and why would you hold me?\" He\r\npassed unconsciously into English. \"Be a good sport, Yolara,\" he\r\nurged, \"You _have_ got a very devil of a temper, you know, and so have\r\nI; and we'd be really awfully uncomfortable together. And why don't\r\nyou get rid of that devilish pet of yours, and be good!\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, puzzled, Marakinoff leaned over, translated to\r\nLugur. The red dwarf smiled maliciously, drew near the priestess;\r\nwhispered to her what was without doubt as near as he could come in\r\nthe Murian to Larry's own very colloquial phrases.\r\n\r\nYolara's lips writhed.\r\n\r\n\"Hear me, Lakla!\" she cried.  \"Now would I not let you take this man\r\nfrom me were I to dwell ten thousand _laya_ in the agony of the\r\n_Yekta's_ kiss. This I swear to you--by Thanaroa, by my heart, and by\r\nmy strength--and may my strength wither, my heart rot in my breast,\r\nand Thanaroa forget me if I do!\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Yolara\"--began O'Keefe again.\r\n\r\n\"Be silent, you!\" It was almost a shriek.  And her hand again sought\r\nin her breast for the cone of rhythmic death.\r\n\r\nLugur touched her arm, whispered again, The glint of guile shone in\r\nher eyes; she laughed softly, relaxed.\r\n\r\n\"The Silent Ones, Lakla, bade you say that they--allowed--me three\r\n_tal_ to decide,\" she said suavely. \"Go now in peace, Lakla, and say\r\nthat Yolara has heard, and that for the three _tal_ they--allow--her\r\nshe will take council.\" The handmaiden hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"The Silent Ones have said it,\" she answered at last.  \"Stay you here,\r\nstrangers\"---the long lashes drooped as her eyes met O'Keefe's and a\r\nhint of blush was in her cheeks--\"stay you here, strangers, till then.\r\nBut, Yolara, see you on that heart and strength you have sworn by that\r\nthey come to no harm--else that which you have invoked shall come upon\r\nyou swiftly indeed--and that I promise you,\" she added.\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met, clashed, burned into each other--black flame from\r\nAbaddon and golden flame from Paradise.\r\n\r\n\"Remember!\" said Lakla, and passed through the portal. The gigantic\r\nfrog-man boomed a thunderous note of command, his grotesque guards\r\nturned and slowly followed their mistress; and last of all passed out\r\nthe monster with the mace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nLarry's Defiance\r\n\r\nA clamour arose from all the chambers; stilled in an instant by a\r\nmotion of Yolara's hand. She stood silent, regarding O'Keefe with\r\nsomething other now than blind wrath; something half regretful, half\r\nbeseeching. But the Irishman's control was gone.\r\n\r\n\"Yolara,\"--his voice shook with rage, and he threw caution to the\r\nwind--\"now hear _me_. I go where I will and when I will. Here shall we\r\nstay until the time she named is come. And then we follow her, whether\r\nyou will or not. And if any should have thought to stop us--tell them\r\nof that flame that shattered the vase,\" he added grimly.\r\n\r\nThe wistfulness died out of her eyes, leaving them cold. But no answer\r\nmade she to him.\r\n\r\n\"What Lakla has said, the Council must consider, and at once.\" The\r\npriestess was facing the nobles. \"Now, friends of mine, and friends of\r\nLugur, must all feud, all rancour, between us end.\" She glanced\r\nswiftly at Lugur. \"The _ladala_ are stirring, and the Silent Ones\r\nthreaten. Yet fear not--for are we not strong under the Shining One?\r\nAnd now--leave us.\"\r\n\r\nHer hand dropped to the table, and she gave, evidently, a signal, for\r\nin marched a dozen or more of the green dwarfs.\r\n\r\n\"Take these two to their place,\" she commanded, pointing to us.\r\n\r\nThe green dwarfs clustered about us.  Without another look at the\r\npriestess O'Keefe marched beside me, between them, from the chamber.\r\nAnd it was not until we had reached the pillared entrance that Larry\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n\"I hate to talk like that to a woman, Doc,\" he said, \"and a pretty\r\nwoman, at that. But first she played me with a marked deck, and then\r\nnot only pinched all the chips, but drew a gun on me. What the\r\nhell! she nearly had me--_married_--to her. I don't know what the stuff\r\nwas she gave me; but, take it from me, if I had the recipe for that\r\nbrew I could sell it for a thousand dollars a jolt at Forty-second and\r\nBroadway.\r\n\r\n\"One jigger of it, and you forget there is a trouble in the world;\r\nthree of them, and you forget there is a world. No excuse for it, Doc;\r\nand I don't care what you say or what Lakla may say--it wasn't my\r\nfault, and I don't hold it up against myself for a damn.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must admit that I'm a bit uneasy about her threats,\" I said,\r\nignoring all this. He stopped abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"What're you afraid of?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mostly,\" I answered dryly, \"I have no desire to dance with the\r\nShining One!\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me, Goodwin,\" He took up his walk impatiently.  \"I've all\r\nthe love and admiration for you in the world; but this place has got\r\nyour nerve. Hereafter one Larry O'Keefe, of Ireland and the little old\r\nU. S. A., leads this party. Nix on the tremolo stop, nix on the\r\nsuperstition! I'm the works. Get me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I get you!\" I exclaimed testily enough.  \"But to use your own\r\nphrase, kindly can the repeated references to superstition.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should I?\" He was almost wrathful.  \"You scientific people build\r\nup whole philosophies on the basis of things you never saw, and you\r\nscoff at people who believe in other things that you think _they_ never\r\nsaw and that don't come under what you label scientific. You talk\r\nabout paradoxes--why, your scientist, who thinks he is the most\r\nskeptical, the most materialistic aggregation of atoms ever gathered\r\nat the exact mathematical centre of Missouri, has more blind faith\r\nthan a dervish, and more credulity, more superstition, than a\r\ncross-eyed smoke beating it past a country graveyard in the dark of\r\nthe moon!\"\r\n\r\n\"Larry!\" I cried, dazed.\r\n\r\n\"Olaf's no better,\" he said.  \"But I can make allowances for him.\r\nHe's a sailor. No, sir. What this expedition needs is a man without\r\nsuperstition. And remember this. The leprechaun promised that I'd have\r\nfull warning before anything happened. And if we do have to go out,\r\nwe'll see that banshee bunch clean up before we do, and pass in a\r\nblaze of glory. And don't forget it. Hereafter--I'm--in--charge!\"\r\n\r\nBy this time we were before our pavilion; and neither of us in a very\r\namiable mood I'm afraid. Rador was awaiting us with a score of his\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\"Let none pass in here without authority--and let none pass out unless\r\nI accompany them,\" he ordered bruskly. \"Summon one of the swiftest of\r\nthe _coria_ and have it wait in readiness,\" he added, as though by\r\nafterthought.\r\n\r\nBut when we had entered and the screens were drawn together his manner\r\nchanged; all eagerness he questioned us. Briefly we told him of the\r\nhappenings at the feast, of Lakla's dramatic interruption, and of what\r\nhad followed.\r\n\r\n\"Three _tal_,\" he said musingly; \"three _tal_ the Silent Ones have\r\nallowed--and Yolara agreed.\" He sank back, silent and thoughtful.[1]\r\n\r\n\"_Ja!_\"  It was Olaf. \"_Ja!_  I told you the Shining Devil's mistress\r\nwas all evil. _Ja!_ Now I begin again that tale I started when he\r\ncame\"--he glanced toward the preoccupied Rador. \"And tell him not what\r\nI say should he ask. For I trust none here in Trolldom, save the\r\n_Jomfrau_--the White Virgin!\r\n\r\n\"After the oldster was _adsprede_\"--Olaf once more used that\r\nexpressive Norwegian word for the dissolving of Songar--\"I knew that\r\nit was a time for cunning. I said to myself, 'If they think I have no\r\nears to hear, they will speak; and it may be I will find a way to save\r\nmy Helma and Dr. Goodwin's friends, too.' _Ja_, and they did speak.\r\n\r\n\"The red _Trolde_ asked the Russian how came it he was a worshipper of\r\nThanaroa.\" I could not resist a swift glance of triumph toward\r\nO'Keefe. \"And the Russian,\" rumbled Olaf, \"said that all his people\r\nworshipped Thanaroa and had fought against the other nations that\r\ndenied him.\r\n\r\n\"And then we had come to Lugur's palace.  They put me in rooms, and\r\nthere came to me men who rubbed and oiled me and loosened my muscles.\r\nThe next day I wrestled with a great dwarf they called Valdor. He was\r\na mighty man, and long we struggled, and at last I broke his back. And\r\nLugur was pleased, so that I sat with him at feast and with the\r\nRussian, too. And again, not knowing that I understood them, they\r\ntalked.\r\n\r\n\"The Russian had gone fast and far.  They talked of Lugur as emperor\r\nof all Europe, and Marakinoff under him. They spoke of the green light\r\nthat shook life from the oldster; and Lugur said that the secret of it\r\nhad been the Ancient Ones' and that the Council had not too much of\r\nit. But the Russian said that among his race were many wise men who\r\ncould make more once they had studied it.\r\n\r\n\"And the next day I wrestled with a great dwarf named Tahola, mightier\r\nfar than Valdor. Him I threw after a long, long time, and his back\r\nalso I broke. Again Lugur was pleased. And again we sat at table, he\r\nand the Russian and I. This time they spoke of something these\r\n_Trolde_ have which opens up a _Svaelc_--abysses into which all in its\r\nrange drops up into the sky!\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"I know about them,\" said Larry.  \"Wait!\"\r\n\r\n\"Lugur had drunk much,\" went on Olaf.  \"He was boastful.  The Russian\r\npressed him to show this thing. After a while the red one went out and\r\ncame back with a little golden box. He and the Russian went into the\r\ngarden. I followed them. There was a _lille Hoj_--a mound--of stones\r\nin that garden on which grew flowers and trees.\r\n\r\n\"Lugur pressed upon the box, and a spark no bigger than a sand grain\r\nleaped out and fell beside the stones. Lugur pressed again, and a blue\r\nlight shot from the box and lighted on the spark. The spark that had\r\nbeen no bigger than a grain of sand grew and grew as the blue struck\r\nit. And then there was a sighing, a wind blew--and the stones and the\r\nflowers and the trees were not. They were _forsvinde_--vanished!\r\n\r\n\"Then Lugur, who had been laughing, grew quickly sober; for he thrust\r\nthe Russian back--far back. And soon down into the garden came\r\ntumbling the stones and the trees, but broken and shattered, and\r\nfalling as though from a great height. And Lugur said that of _this_\r\nsomething they had much, for its making was a secret handed down by\r\ntheir own forefathers and not by the Ancient Ones.\r\n\r\n\"They feared to use it, he said, for a spark thrice as large as that\r\nhe had used would have sent all that garden falling upward and might\r\nhave opened a way to the outside before--he said just this--'_before\r\nwe are ready to go out into it!_'\r\n\r\n\"The Russian questioned much, but Lugur sent for more drink and grew\r\nmerrier and threatened him, and the Russian was silent through fear.\r\nThereafter I listened when I could, and little more I learned, but\r\nthat little enough. _Ja!_ Lugur is hot for conquest; so Yolara and so\r\nthe Council. They tire of it here and the Silent Ones make their minds\r\nnot too easy, no, even though they jeer at them! And this they plan--to\r\nrule our world with their Shining Devil.\"\r\n\r\nThe Norseman was silent for a moment; then voice deep, trembling--\r\n\r\n\"Trolldom is awake; Helvede crouches at Earth Gate whining to be\r\nloosed into a world already devil ridden! And we are but three!\"\r\n\r\nI felt the blood drive out of my heart.  But Larry's was the fighting\r\nface of the O'Keefes of a thousand years. Rador glanced at him, arose,\r\nstepped through the curtains; returned swiftly with the Irishman's\r\nuniform.\r\n\r\n\"Put it on,\" he said, bruskly; again fell back into his silence and\r\nwhatever O'Keefe had been about to say was submerged in his wild and\r\njoyful whoop. He ripped from him glittering tunic and leg swathings.\r\n\r\n\"Richard is himself again!\" he shouted; and each garment as he donned\r\nit, fanned his old devil-may-care confidence to a higher flame. The\r\nlast scrap of it on, he drew himself up before us.\r\n\r\n\"Bow down, ye divils!\" he cried.  \"Bang your heads on the floor and do\r\nhomage to Larry the First, Emperor of Great Britain, Autocrat of all\r\nIreland, Scotland, England, and Wales, and adjacent waters and\r\nislands! Kneel, ye scuts, kneel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Larry,\" I cried, \"are you going crazy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of it,\" he said.  \"I'm that and more if Comrade Marakinoff\r\nis on the level. Whoop! Bring forth the royal jewels an' put a whole\r\nnew bunch of golden strings in Tara's harp an' down with the Sassenach\r\nforever! Whoop!\"\r\n\r\nHe did a wild jig.\r\n\r\n\"Lord how good the old togs feel,\" he grinned.  \"The touch of 'em has\r\ngone to my head. But it's straight stuff I'm telling you about my\r\nempire.\"\r\n\r\nHe sobered.\r\n\r\n\"Not that it's not serious enough at that.  A lot that Olaf's told us\r\nI've surmised from hints dropped by Yolara. But I got the full key to\r\nit from the Red himself when he stopped me just before--before\"--he\r\nreddened--\"well, just before I acquired that brand-new brand of souse.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe he had a hint--maybe he just surmised that I knew a lot more\r\nthan I did. And he thought Yolara and I were going to be loving little\r\nturtle doves. Also he figured that Yolara had a lot more influence\r\nwith the Unholy Fireworks than Lugur. Also that being a woman she\r\ncould be more easily handled. All this being so, what was the logical\r\nthing for himself to do? Sure, you get me, Steve! Throw down Lugur and\r\nmake an alliance with me! So _he_ calmly offered to ditch the red dwarf\r\nif I would deliver Yolara. My reward from Russia was to be said\r\nemperorship! Can you beat it? Good Lord!\"\r\n\r\nHe went off into a perfect storm of laughter.  But not to me in the\r\nlight of what Russia has done and has proved herself capable, did this\r\nthing seem at all absurd; rather in it I sensed the dawn of\r\ncatastrophe colossal.\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" he was quiet enough now, \"I'm a bit scared. They've got the\r\n_Keth_ ray and those gravity-destroying bombs--\"\r\n\r\n\"Gravity-destroying bombs!\" I gasped.\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" he said.  \"The little fairy that sent the trees and stones\r\nkiting up from Lugur's garden. Marakinoff licked his lips over them.\r\nThey cut off gravity, just about as the shadow screens cut off\r\nlight--and consequently whatever's in their range goes shooting just\r\nnaturally up to the moon--\r\n\r\n\"They get my goat, why deny it?\" went on Larry.  \"With them and the\r\n_Keth_ and gentle invisible soldiers walking around assassinating at\r\nwill--well, the worst Bolsheviki are only puling babes, eh, Doc?\r\n\r\n\"I don't mind the Shining One,\" said O'Keefe, \"one splash of a\r\ndowntown New York high-pressure fire hose would do for it! But the\r\nothers--are the goods! Believe me!\"\r\n\r\nBut for once O'Keefe's confidence found no echo within me. Not\r\nlightly, as he, did I hold that dread mystery, the Dweller--and a\r\nvision passed before me, a vision of an Apocalypse undreamed by the\r\nEvangelist.\r\n\r\nA vision of the Shining One swirling into our world, a monstrous,\r\nglorious flaming pillar of incarnate, eternal Evil--of peoples\r\npassing through its radiant embrace into that hideous, unearthly\r\nlife-in-death which I had seen enfold the sacrifices--of armies\r\ntrembling into dancing atoms of diamond dust beneath the green ray's\r\nrhythmic death--of cities rushing out into space upon the wings of\r\nthat other demoniac force which Olaf had watched at work--of a haunted\r\nworld through which the assassins of the Dweller's court stole\r\ninvisible, carrying with them every passion of hell--of the rallying\r\nto the Thing of every sinister soul and of the weak and the\r\nunbalanced, mystics and carnivores of humanity alike; for well I knew\r\nthat, once loosed, not any nation could hold this devil-god for long\r\nand that swiftly its blight would spread!\r\n\r\nAnd then a world that was all colossal reek of cruelty and terror; a\r\nwelter of lusts, of hatreds and of torment; a chaos of horror in which\r\nthe Dweller waxing ever stronger, the ghastly hordes of those it had\r\nconsumed growing ever greater, wreaked its inhuman will!\r\n\r\nAt the last a ruined planet, a cosmic plague, spinning through the\r\nshuddering heavens; its verdant plains, its murmuring forests, its\r\nmeadows and its mountains manned only by a countless crew of soulless,\r\nmindless dead-alive, their shells illumined with the Dweller's\r\ninfernal glory--and flaming over this vampirized earth like a flare\r\nfrom some hell far, infinitely far, beyond the reach of man's farthest\r\nflung imagining--the Dweller!\r\n\r\nRador jumped to his feet; walked to the whispering globe. He bent over\r\nits base; did something with its mechanism; beckoned to us. The globe\r\nswam rapidly, faster than ever I had seen it before. A low humming\r\narose, changed into a murmur, and then from it I heard Lugur's voice\r\nclearly.\r\n\r\n\"It is to be war then?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a chorus of assent--from the Council, I thought.\r\n\r\n\"I will take the tall one named--_Larree_.\" It was the priestess's\r\nvoice. \"After the three _tal_, you may have him, Lugur, to do with as\r\nyou will.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" it was Lugur's voice again, but with a rasp of anger. \"All must\r\ndie.\"\r\n\r\n\"He shall die,\" again Yolara.  \"But I would that first he see Lakla\r\npass--and that she know what is to happen to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" I started--for this was Marakinoff.  \"Now is no time, Yolara,\r\nfor one's own desires. This is my counsel. At the end of the three\r\n_tal_ Lakla will come for our answer. Your men will be in ambush and\r\nthey will slay her and her escort quickly with the _Keth_. But not\r\ntill that is done must the three be slain--and then quickly. With\r\nLakla dead we shall go forth to the Silent Ones--and I promise you\r\nthat I will find the way to destroy them!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is well!\" It was Lugur.\r\n\r\n\"It _is_ well, Yolara.\" It was a woman's voice, and I knew it for that\r\nold one of ravaged beauty. \"Cast from your mind whatever is in it for\r\nthis stranger--either of love or hatred. In this the Council is with\r\nLugur and the man of wisdom.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a silence.  Then came the priestess's voice, sullen\r\nbut--beaten.\r\n\r\n\"It is well!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let the three be taken now by Rador to the temple and given to the\r\nHigh Priest Sator\"--thus Lugur--\"until what we have planned comes to\r\npass.\"\r\n\r\nRador gripped the base of the globe; abruptly it ceased its spinning.\r\nHe turned to us as though to speak and even as he did so its bell note\r\nsounded peremptorily and on it the colour films began to creep at\r\ntheir accustomed pace.\r\n\r\n\"I hear,\" the green dwarf whispered.  \"They shall be taken there at\r\nonce.\" The globe grew silent. He stepped toward us.\r\n\r\n\"You have heard,\" he turned to us.\r\n\r\n\"Not on your life, Rador,\" said Larry.  \"Nothing doing!\" And then in\r\nthe Murian's own tongue. \"We follow Lakla, Rador. And _you_ lead the\r\nway.\" He thrust the pistol close to the green dwarf's side.\r\n\r\nRador did not move.\r\n\r\n\"Of what use, _Larree_?\" he said, quietly.  \"Me you can slay--but in\r\nthe end you will be taken. Life is not held so dear in Muria that my\r\nmen out there or those others who can come quickly will let you\r\nby--even though you slay many. And in the end they will overpower\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a trace of irresolution in O'Keefe's face.\r\n\r\n\"And,\" added Rador, \"if I let you go I dance with the Shining One--or\r\nworse!\"\r\n\r\nO'Keefe's pistol hand dropped.\r\n\r\n\"You're a good sport, Rador, and far be it from me to get you in bad,\"\r\nhe said. \"Take us to the temple--when we get there--well, your\r\nresponsibility ends, doesn't it?\"\r\n\r\nThe green dwarf nodded; on his face a curious expression--was it\r\nrelief? Or was it emotion higher than this?\r\n\r\nHe turned curtly.\r\n\r\n\"Follow,\" he said.  We passed out of that gay little pavilion that had\r\ncome to be home to us even in this alien place. The guards stood at\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\"You, Sattoya, stand by the globe,\" he ordered one of them.  \"Should\r\nthe _Afyo Maie_ ask, say that I am on my way with the strangers even\r\nas she has commanded.\"\r\n\r\nWe passed through the lines to the _corial_ standing like a great\r\nshell at the end of the runway leading into the green road.\r\n\r\n\"Wait you here,\" he said curtly to the driver.  The green dwarf\r\nascended to his seat, sought the lever and we swept on--on and out\r\nupon the glistening obsidian.\r\n\r\nThen Rador faced us and laughed.\r\n\r\n\"_Larree_,\" he cried, \"I love you for that spirit of yours! And did\r\nyou think that Rador would carry to the temple prison a man who would\r\ntake the chances of torment upon his own shoulders to save him? Or\r\nyou, Goodwin, who saved him from the rotting death? For what did I\r\ntake the _corial_ or lift the veil of silence that I might hear what\r\nthreatened you--\"\r\n\r\nHe swept the _corial_ to the left, away from the temple approach.\r\n\r\n\"I am done with Lugur and with Yolara and the Shining One!\" cried\r\nRador. \"My hand is for you three and for Lakla and those to whom she\r\nis handmaiden!\"\r\n\r\nThe shell leaped forward; seemed to fly.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] A _tal_ in Muria is the equivalent of thirty hours of earth surface\r\ntime.--W. T. G.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nThe Casting of the Shadow\r\n\r\nNow we were racing down toward that last span whose ancientness had\r\nset it apart from all the other soaring arches. The shell's speed\r\nslackened; we approached warily.\r\n\r\n\"We pass there?\" asked O'Keefe.\r\n\r\nThe green dwarf nodded, pointing to the right where the bridge ended\r\nin a broad platform held high upon two gigantic piers, between which\r\nran a spur from the glistening road. Platform and bridge were swarming\r\nwith men-at-arms; they crowded the parapets, looking down upon us\r\ncuriously but with no evidence of hostility. Rador drew a deep breath\r\nof relief.\r\n\r\n\"We don't have to break our way through, then?\" There was\r\ndisappointment in the Irishman's voice.\r\n\r\n\"No use, _Larree_!\" Smiling, Rador stopped the _corial_ just beneath\r\nthe arch and beside one of the piers. \"Now, listen well. They have had\r\nno warning, hence does Yolara still think us on the way to the temple.\r\nThis is the gateway of the Portal--and the gateway is closed by the\r\nShadow. Once I commanded here and I know its laws. This must I do--by\r\ncraft persuade Serku, the keeper of the gateway, to lift the Shadow;\r\nor raise it myself. And that will be hard and it may well be that in\r\nthe struggle life will be stripped of us all. Yet is it better to die\r\nfighting than to dance with the Shining One!\"\r\n\r\nHe swept the shell around the pier.  Opened a wide plaza paved with\r\nthe volcanic glass, but black as that down which we had sped from the\r\nchamber of the Moon Pool. It shone like a mirrored lakelet of jet; on\r\neach side of it arose what at first glance seemed towering bulwarks of\r\nthe same ebon obsidian; at second, revealed themselves as structures\r\nhewn and set in place by men; polished faces pierced by dozens of\r\nhigh, narrow windows.\r\n\r\nDown each facade a stairway fell, broken by small landings on which a\r\ndoor opened; they dropped to a broad ledge of greyish stone edging the\r\nlip of this midnight pool and upon it also fell two wide flights from\r\neither side of the bridge platform. Along all four stairways the\r\nguards were ranged; and here and there against the ledge stood the\r\nshells--in a curiously comforting resemblance to parked motors in our\r\nown world.\r\n\r\nThe sombre walls bulked high; curved and ended in two obelisked\r\npillars from which, like a tremendous curtain, stretched a barrier of\r\nthat tenebrous gloom which, though weightless as shadow itself, I now\r\nknew to be as impenetrable as the veil between life and death. In this\r\nmurk, unlike all others I had seen, I sensed movement, a quivering, a\r\ntremor constant and rhythmic; not to be seen, yet caught by some\r\nsubtle sense; as though through it beat a swift pulse of--black\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nThe green dwarf turned the _corial_ slowly to the edge at the right;\r\ncrept cautiously on toward where, not more than a hundred feet from\r\nthe barrier, a low, wide entrance opened in the fort. Guarding its\r\nthreshold stood two guards, armed with broadswords, double-handed,\r\nterminating in a wide lunette mouthed with murderous fangs. These they\r\nraised in salute and through the portal strode a dwarf huge as Rador,\r\ndressed as he and carrying only the poniard that was the badge of\r\noffice of Muria's captainry.\r\n\r\nThe green dwarf swept the shell expertly against the ledge; leaped\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\"Greeting, Serku!\" he answered.  \"I was but looking for the _coria_ of\r\nLakla.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lakla!\" exclaimed Serku.  \"Why, the handmaiden passed with her _Akka_\r\nnigh a _va_ ago!\"\r\n\r\n\"Passed!\" The astonishment of the green dwarf was so real that half\r\nwas I myself deceived. \"You let her _pass_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I let her pass--\" But under the green dwarf's stern gaze\r\nthe truculence of the guardian faded. \"Why should I not?\" he asked,\r\napprehensively.\r\n\r\n\"Because Yolara commanded otherwise,\" answered Rador, coldly.\r\n\r\n\"There came no command to me.\"  Little beads of sweat stood out on\r\nSerku's forehead.\r\n\r\n\"Serku,\" interrupted the green dwarf swiftly, \"truly is my heart wrung\r\nfor you. This is a matter of Yolara and of Lugur and the Council; yes,\r\neven of the Shining One! And the message was sent--and the fate,\r\nmayhap, of all Muria rested upon your obedience and the return of\r\nLakla with these strangers to the Council. Now truly is my heart\r\nwrung, for there are few I would less like to see dance with the\r\nShining One than you, Serku,\" he ended, softly.\r\n\r\nLivid now was the gateway's guardian, his great frame shaking.\r\n\r\n\"Come with me and speak to Yolara,\" he pleaded.  \"There came no\r\nmessage--tell her--\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait, Serku!\" There was a thrill as of inspiration in Rador's voice.\r\n\"This _corial_ is of the swiftest--Lakla's are of the slowest. With\r\nLakla scarce a _va_ ahead we can reach her before she enters the\r\nPortal. Lift you the Shadow--we will bring her back, and this will I\r\ndo for you, Serku.\"\r\n\r\nDoubt tempered Serku's panic.\r\n\r\n\"Why not go alone, Rador, leaving the strangers here with me?\" he\r\nasked--and I thought not unreasonably.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, then.\" The green dwarf was brusk.  \"Lakla will not return unless\r\nI carry to her these men as evidence of our good faith. Come--we will\r\nspeak to Yolara and she shall judge you--\" He started away--but Serku\r\ncaught his arm.\r\n\r\n\"No, Rador, no!\" he whispered, again panic-stricken.  \"Go you--as you\r\nwill. But bring her back! Speed, Rador!\" He sprang toward the\r\nentrance. \"I lift the Shadow--\"\r\n\r\nInto the green dwarf's poise crept a curious, almost a listening,\r\nalertness. He leaped to Serku's side.\r\n\r\n\"I go with you,\" I heard.  \"Some little I can tell you--\" They were\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n\"Fine work!\" muttered Larry.  \"Nominated for a citizen of Ireland when\r\nwe get out of this, one Rador of--\"\r\n\r\nThe Shadow trembled--shuddered into nothingness; the obelisked\r\noutposts that had held it framed a ribbon of roadway, high banked with\r\nverdure, vanishing in green distances.\r\n\r\nAnd then from the portal sped a shriek, a death cry!  It cut through\r\nthe silence of the ebon pit like a whimpering arrow. Before it had\r\ndied, down the stairways came pouring the guards. Those at the\r\nthreshold raised their swords and peered within. Abruptly Rador was\r\nbetween them. One dropped his hilt and gripped him--the green dwarf's\r\nponiard flashed and was buried in his throat. Down upon Rador's head\r\nswept the second blade. A flame leaped from O'Keefe's hand and the\r\nsword seemed to fling itself from its wielder's grasp--another flash\r\nand the soldier crumpled. Rador threw himself into the shell, darted\r\nto the high seat--and straight between the pillars of the Shadow we\r\nflew!\r\n\r\nThere came a crackling, a darkness of vast wings flinging down upon\r\nus. The _corial's_ flight was checked as by a giant's hand. The shell\r\nswerved sickeningly; there was an oddly metallic splintering; it\r\nquivered; shot ahead. Dizzily I picked myself up and looked behind.\r\n\r\nThe Shadow had fallen--but too late, a bare instant too late.  And\r\nshrinking as we fled from it, still it seemed to strain like some\r\nfettered Afrit from Eblis, throbbing with wrath, seeking with every\r\nmalign power it possessed to break its bonds and pursue. Not until\r\nlong after were we to know that it had been the dying hand of Serku,\r\ngroping out of oblivion, that had cast it after us as a fowler upon an\r\nescaping bird.\r\n\r\n\"Snappy work, Rador!\" It was Larry speaking.  \"But they cut the end\r\noff your bus all right!\"\r\n\r\nA full quarter of the hindward whorl was gone, sliced off cleanly.\r\nRador noted it with anxious eyes.\r\n\r\n\"That is bad,\" he said, \"but not too bad perhaps.  All depends upon\r\nhow closely Lugur and his men can follow us.\"\r\n\r\nHe raised a hand to O'Keefe in salute.\r\n\r\n\"But to you, _Larree_, I owe my life--not even the _Keth_ could have\r\nbeen as swift to save me as that death flame of yours--friend!\"\r\n\r\nThe Irishman waved an airy hand.\r\n\r\n\"Serku\"--the green dwarf drew from his girdle the bloodstained\r\nponiard--\"Serku I was forced to slay. Even as he raised the Shadow the\r\nglobe gave the alarm. Lugur follows with twice ten times ten of his\r\nbest--\" He hesitated. \"Though we have escaped the Shadow it has taken\r\ntoll of our swiftness. May we reach the Portal before it closes upon\r\nLakla--but if we do not--\" He paused again. \"Well--I know a way--but\r\nit is not one I am gay to follow--no!\"\r\n\r\nHe snapped open the aperture that held the ball flaming within the\r\ndark crystal; peered at it anxiously. I crept to the torn end of the\r\n_corial_. The edges were crumbling, disintegrated. They powdered in my\r\nfingers like dust. Mystified still, I crept back where Larry, sheer\r\nhappiness pouring from him, was whistling softly and polishing up his\r\nautomatic. His gaze fell upon Olaf's grim, sad face and softened.\r\n\r\n\"Buck up, Olaf!\" he said.  \"We've got a good fighting chance.  Once we\r\nlink up with Lakla and her crowd I'm betting that we get your\r\nwife--never doubt it! The baby--\" he hesitated awkwardly. The\r\nNorseman's eyes filled; he stretched a hand to the O'Keefe.\r\n\r\n\"The _Yndling_--she is of the _de Dode_,\" he half whispered, \"of the\r\nblessed dead. For her I have no fear and for her vengeance will be\r\ngiven me. _Ja!_ But my Helma--she is of the dead-alive--like those we\r\nsaw whirling like leaves in the light of the Shining Devil--and I\r\nwould that she too were of _de Dode_--and at rest. I do not know how\r\nto fight the Shining Devil--no!\"\r\n\r\nHis bitter despair welled up in his voice.\r\n\r\n\"Olaf,\" Larry's voice was gentle.  \"We'll come out on top--I know it.\r\nRemember one thing. All this stuff that seems so strange and--and,\r\nwell, sort of supernatural, is just a lot of tricks we're not hep to\r\nas yet. Why, Olaf, suppose you took a Fijian when the war was on and\r\nset him suddenly down in London with autos rushing past, sirens\r\nblowing, Archies popping, a dozen enemy planes dropping bombs, and the\r\nsearchlights shooting all over the sky--wouldn't he think he was among\r\nthirty-third degree devils in some exclusive circle of hell? Sure he\r\nwould! And yet everything he saw would be natural--just as natural as\r\nall this is, once we get the answer to it. Not that we're Fijians, of\r\ncourse, but the principle is the same.\"\r\n\r\nThe Norseman considered this; nodded gravely.\r\n\r\n\"_Ja!_\" he answered at last.  \"And at least we can fight.  That is why\r\nI have turned to Thor of the battles, _Ja!_ And _one_ have I hope in for\r\nmine Helma--the white maiden. Since I have turned to the old gods it\r\nhas been made clear to me that I shall slay Lugur and that the _Heks_,\r\nthe evil witch Yolara, shall also die. But I would talk with the white\r\nmaiden.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Larry, \"but just don't be afraid of what you don't\r\nunderstand. There's another thing\"--he hesitated, nervously--\"there's\r\nanother thing that may startle you a bit when we meet up with\r\nLakla--her--er--frogs!\"\r\n\r\n\"Like the frog-woman we saw on the wall?\" asked Olaf.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" went on Larry, rapidly.  \"It's this way--I figure that the\r\nfrogs grow rather large where she lives, and they're a bit different\r\ntoo. Well, Lakla's got a lot of 'em trained. Carry spears and clubs\r\nand all that junk--just like trained seals or monkeys or so on in the\r\ncircus. Probably a custom of the place. Nothing queer about that,\r\nOlaf. Why people have all kinds of pets--armadillos and snakes and\r\nrabbits, kangaroos and elephants and tigers.\"\r\n\r\nRemembering how the frog-woman had stuck in Larry's mind from the\r\noutset, I wondered whether all this was not more to convince himself\r\nthan Olaf.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I remember a nice girl in Paris who had four pet pythons--\" he\r\nwent on.\r\n\r\nBut I listened no more, for now I was sure of my surmise. The road had\r\nbegun to thrust itself through high-flung, sharply pinnacled masses\r\nand rounded outcroppings of rock on which clung patches of the amber\r\nmoss.\r\n\r\nThe trees had utterly vanished, and studding the moss-carpeted plains\r\nwere only clumps of a willowy shrub from which hung, like grapes,\r\nclusters of white waxen blooms. The light too had changed; gone were\r\nthe dancing, sparkling atoms and the silver had faded to a soft,\r\nalmost ashen greyness. Ahead of us marched a rampart of coppery cliffs\r\nrising, like all these mountainous walls we had seen, into the\r\nimmensities of haze. Something long drifting in my subconsciousness\r\nturned to startled realization. The speed of the shell was slackening!\r\nThe aperture containing the ionizing mechanism was still open; I\r\nglanced within, The whirling ball of fire was not dimmed, but its\r\ncoruscations, instead of pouring down through the cylinder, swirled\r\nand eddied and shot back as though trying to re-enter their source.\r\nRador nodded grimly.\r\n\r\n\"The Shadow takes its toll,\" he said.\r\n\r\nWe topped a rise--Larry gripped my arm.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" he cried, and pointed.  Far, far behind us, so far that the\r\nroad was but a glistening thread, a score of shining points came\r\nspeeding.\r\n\r\n\"Lugur and his men,\" said Rador.\r\n\r\n\"Can't you step on her?\" asked Larry.\r\n\r\n\"Step on her?\" repeated the green dwarf, puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"Give her more speed; push her,\" explained O'Keefe.\r\n\r\nRador looked about him.  The coppery ramparts were close, not more\r\nthan three or four miles distant; in front of us the plain lifted in a\r\nlong rolling swell, and up this the _corial_ essayed to go--with a\r\nterrifying lessening of speed. Faintly behind us came shootings, and\r\nwe knew that Lugur drew close. Nor anywhere was there sign of Lakla\r\nnor her frogmen.\r\n\r\nNow we were half-way to the crest; the shell barely crawled and from\r\nbeneath it came a faint hissing; it quivered, and I knew that its base\r\nwas no longer held above the glassy surface but rested on it.\r\n\r\n\"One last chance!\" exclaimed Rador.  He pressed upon the control lever\r\nand wrenched it from its socket. Instantly the sparkling ball\r\nexpanded, whirling with prodigious rapidity and sending a cascade of\r\ncoruscations into the cylinder. The shell rose; leaped through the\r\nair; the dark crystal split into fragments; the fiery ball dulled;\r\ndied--but upon the impetus of that last thrust we reached the crest.\r\nPoised there for a moment, I caught a glimpse of the road dropping\r\ndown the side of an enormous moss-covered, bowl-shaped valley whose\r\nsharply curved sides ended abruptly at the base of the towering\r\nbarrier.\r\n\r\nThen down the steep, powerless to guide or to check the shell, we\r\nplunged in a meteor rush straight for the annihilating adamantine\r\nbreasts of the cliffs!\r\n\r\nNow the quick thinking of Larry's air training came to our aid.  As\r\nthe rampart reared close he threw himself upon Rador; hurled him and\r\nhimself against the side of the flying whorl. Under the shock the\r\nfinely balanced machine swerved from its course. It struck the soft,\r\nlow bank of the road, shot high in air, bounded on through the thick\r\ncarpeting, whirled like a dervish and fell upon its side. Shot from\r\nit, we rolled for yards, but the moss saved broken bones or serious\r\nbruise.\r\n\r\n\"Quick!\" cried the green dwarf.  He seized an arm, dragged me to my\r\nfeet, began running to the cliff base not a hundred feet away. Beside\r\nus raced O'Keefe and Olaf. At our left was the black road. It stopped\r\nabruptly--was cut off by a slab of polished crimson stone a hundred\r\nfeet high, and as wide, set within the coppery face of the barrier. On\r\neach side of it stood pillars, cut from the living rock and immense,\r\nalmost, as those which held the rainbow veil of the Dweller. Across\r\nits face weaved unnameable carvings--but I had no time for more than a\r\nglance. The green dwarf gripped my arm again.\r\n\r\n\"Quick!\" he cried again.  \"The handmaiden has passed!\"\r\n\r\nAt the right of the Portal ran a low wall of shattered rock. Over this\r\nwe raced like rabbits. Hidden behind it was a narrow path. Crouching,\r\nRador in the lead, we sped along it; three hundred, four hundred yards\r\nwe raced--and the path ended in a _cul de sac_! To our ears was borne\r\na louder shouting.\r\n\r\nThe first of the pursuing shells had swept over the lip of the great\r\nbowl, poised for a moment as we had and then began a cautious descent.\r\nWithin it, scanning the slopes, I saw Lugur.\r\n\r\n\"A little closer and I'll get him!\" whispered Larry viciously.  He\r\nraised his pistol.\r\n\r\nHis hand was caught in a mighty grip; Rador, eyes blazing, stood\r\nbeside him.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" rasped the green dwarf.  He heaved a shoulder against one of the\r\nboulders that formed the pocket. It rocked aside, revealing a slit.\r\n\r\n\"In!\" ordered he, straining against the weight of the stone. O'Keefe\r\nslipped through. Olaf at his back, I following. With a lightning leap\r\nthe dwarf was beside me, the huge rock missing him by a hair breadth\r\nas it swung into place!\r\n\r\nWe were in Cimmerian darkness.  I felt for my pocket-flash and\r\nrecalled with distress that I had left it behind with my medicine kit\r\nwhen we fled from the gardens. But Rador seemed to need no light.\r\n\r\n\"Grip hands!\" he ordered.  We crept, single file, holding to each\r\nother like children, through the black. At last the green dwarf\r\npaused.\r\n\r\n\"Await me here,\" he whispered.  \"Do not move.  And for your lives--be\r\nsilent!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nDragon Worm and Moss Death\r\n\r\nFor a small eternity--to me at least--we waited.  Then as silent as\r\never the green dwarf returned. \"It is well,\" he said, some of the\r\nstrain gone from his voice. \"Grip hands again, and follow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a bit, Rador,\" this was Larry.  \"Does Lugur know this side\r\nentrance? If he does, why not let Olaf and me go back to the opening\r\nand pick them off as they come in? We could hold the lot--and in the\r\nmeantime you and Goodwin could go after Lakla for help.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lugur knows the secret of the Portal--if he dare use it,\" answered\r\nthe captain, with a curious indirection. \"And now that they have\r\nchallenged the Silent Ones I think he _will_ dare. Also, he will find\r\nour tracks--and it may be that he knows this hidden way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, for God's sake!\" O'Keefe's appalled bewilderment was almost\r\nludicrous. \"If _he_ knows all that, and _you_ knew all that, why\r\ndidn't you let me click him when I had the chance?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Larree_,\" the green dwarf was oddly humble.  \"It seemed good to me,\r\ntoo--at first. And then I heard a command, heard it clearly, to stop\r\nyou--that Lugur die not now, lest a greater vengeance fail!\"\r\n\r\n\"Command?  From whom?\" The Irishman's voice distilled out of the\r\nblackness the very essence of bewilderment.\r\n\r\n\"I thought,\" Rador was whispering--\"I thought it came from the Silent\r\nOnes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Superstition!\" groaned O'Keefe in utter exasperation. \"Always\r\nsuperstition! What can you do against it!\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, Rador.\" His sense of humour came to his aid.  \"It's too\r\nlate now, anyway. Where do we go from here, old dear?\" he laughed.\r\n\r\n\"We tread the path of one I am not fain to meet,\" answered Rador.\r\n\"But if meet we must, point the death tubes at the pale shield he\r\nbears upon his throat and send the flame into the flower of cold fire\r\nthat is its centre--nor look into his eyes!\"\r\n\r\nAgain Larry gasped, and I with him.\r\n\r\n\"It's getting too deep for me, Doc,\" he muttered dejectedly.  \"Can you\r\nmake head or tail of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I answered, shortly enough, \"but Rador fears something and\r\nthat's his description of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" he replied, \"only it's a code I don't understand.\" I could\r\nfeel his grin. \"All right for the flower of cold fire, Rador, and I\r\nwon't look into his eyes,\" he went on cheerfully. \"But hadn't we\r\nbetter be moving?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" said the soldier; again hand in hand we went blindly on.\r\n\r\nO'Keefe was muttering to himself.\r\n\r\n\"Flower of cold fire!  Don't look into his eyes!  Some joint!\r\nDamned superstition.\" Then he chuckled and carolled, softly:\r\n\r\n    \"Oh, mama, pin a cold rose on me;\r\n    Two young frog-men are in love with me;\r\n    Shut my eyes so I can't see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sh!\" Rador was warning; he began whispering.  \"For half a _va_ we go\r\nalong a way of death. From its peril we pass into another against\r\nwhose dangers I can guard you. But in part this is in view of the\r\nroadway and it may be that Lugur will see us. If so, we must fight as\r\nbest we can. If we pass these two roads safely, then is the way to the\r\nCrimson Sea clear, nor need we fear Lugur nor any. And there is\r\nanother thing--that Lugur does not know--when he opens the Portal the\r\nSilent Ones will hear and Lakla and the _Akka_ will be swift to greet\r\nits opener.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rador,\" I asked, \"how know _you_ all this?\"\r\n\r\n\"The handmaiden is my own sister's child,\" he answered quietly.\r\n\r\nO'Keefe drew a long breath.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle,\" he remarked casually in English, \"meet the man who's going to\r\nbe your nephew!\"\r\n\r\nAnd thereafter he never addressed the green dwarf except by the\r\navuncular title, which Rador, humorously enough, apparently conceived\r\nto be one of respectful endearment.\r\n\r\nFor me a light broke.  Plain now was the reason for his foreknowledge\r\nof Lakla's appearance at the feast where Larry had so narrowly escaped\r\nYolara's spells; plain the determining factor that had cast his lot\r\nwith ours, and my confidence, despite his discourse of mysterious\r\nperils, experienced a remarkable quickening.\r\n\r\nSpeculation as to the marked differences in pigmentation and\r\nappearance of niece and uncle was dissipated by my consciousness that\r\nwe were now moving in a dim half-light. We were in a fairly wide\r\ntunnel. Not far ahead the gleam filtered, pale yellow like sunlight\r\nsifting through the leaves of autumn poplars. And as we drove closer\r\nto its source I saw that it did indeed pass through a leafy screen\r\nhanging over the passage end. This Rador drew aside cautiously,\r\nbeckoned us and we stepped through.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to be a tunnel cut through soft green mould. Its base was\r\na flat strip of pathway a yard wide from which the walls curved out in\r\nperfect cylindrical form, smoothed and evened with utmost nicety.\r\nThirty feet wide they were at their widest, then drew toward each\r\nother with no break in their symmetry; they did not close. Above was,\r\nroughly, a ten-foot rift, ragged edged, through which poured light\r\nlike that in the heart of pale amber, a buttercup light shot through\r\nwith curiously evanescent bronze shadows.\r\n\r\n\"Quick!\" commanded Rador, uneasily, and set off at a sharp pace.\r\n\r\nNow, my eyes accustomed to the strange light, I saw that the tunnel's\r\nwalls were of moss. In them I could trace fringe leaf and curly leaf,\r\npressings of enormous bladder caps (Physcomitrium), immense splashes\r\nof what seemed to be the scarlet-crested Cladonia, traceries of huge\r\nmoss veils, crushings of teeth (peristome) gigantic; spore cases brown\r\nand white, saffron and ivory, hot vermilions and cerulean blues,\r\npressed into an astounding mosaic by some titanic force.\r\n\r\n\"Hurry!\" It was Rador calling.  I had lagged behind.\r\n\r\nHe quickened the pace to a half-run; we were climbing; panting.  The\r\namber light grew stronger; the rift above us wider. The tunnel curved;\r\non the left a narrow cleft appeared. The green dwarf leaped toward it,\r\nthrust us within, pushed us ahead of him up a steep rocky\r\nfissure--well-nigh, indeed, a chimney. Up and up this we scrambled\r\nuntil my lungs were bursting and I thought I could climb no more. The\r\ncrevice ended; we crawled out and sank, even Rador, upon a little\r\nleaf-carpeted clearing circled by lacy tree ferns.\r\n\r\nGasping, legs aching, we lay prone, relaxed, drawing back strength and\r\nbreath. Rador was first to rise. Thrice he bent low as in homage,\r\nthen--\r\n\r\n\"Give thanks to the Silent Ones--for their power has been over us!\" he\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\nDimly I wondered what he meant.  Something about the fern leaf at\r\nwhich I had been staring aroused me. I leaped to my feet and ran to\r\nits base. This was no fern, no! It was fern _moss_! The largest of its\r\nspecies I had ever found in tropic jungles had not been more than two\r\ninches high, and this was--twenty feet! The scientific fire I had\r\nexperienced in the tunnel returned uncontrollable. I parted the\r\nfronds, gazed out--\r\n\r\nMy outlook commanded a vista of miles--and that vista! A _Fata\r\nMorgana_ of plantdom! A land of flowered sorcery!\r\n\r\nForests of tree-high mosses spangled over with blooms of every\r\nconceivable shape and colour; cataracts and clusters, avalanches and\r\nnets of blossoms in pastels, in dulled metallics, in gorgeous\r\nflamboyant hues; some of them phosphorescent and shining like living\r\njewels; some sparkling as though with dust of opals, of sapphires, of\r\nrubies and topazes and emeralds; thickets of convolvuli like the\r\ntrumpets of the seven archangels of Mara, king of illusion, which are\r\nshaped from the bows of splendours arching his highest heaven!\r\n\r\nAnd moss veils like banners of a marching host of Titans; pennons and\r\nbannerets of the sunset; gonfalons of the Jinn; webs of faery;\r\noriflammes of elfland!\r\n\r\nSpringing up through that polychromatic flood myriads of\r\npedicles--slender and straight as spears, or soaring in spirals, or\r\ncurving with undulations gracile as the white serpents of Tanit in\r\nancient Carthaginian groves--and all surmounted by a fantasy of spore\r\ncases in shapes of minaret and turret, domes and spires and cones,\r\ncaps of Phrygia and bishops' mitres, shapes grotesque and\r\nunnameable--shapes delicate and lovely!\r\n\r\nThey hung high poised, nodding and swaying--like goblins hovering over\r\n_Titania's_ court; cacophony of Cathay accenting the _Flower Maiden_\r\nmusic of \"Parsifal\"; _bizarrerie_ of the angled, fantastic beings that\r\npeople the Javan pantheon watching a bacchanal of houris in Mohammed's\r\nparadise!\r\n\r\nDown upon it all poured the amber light; dimmed in the distances by\r\nhuge, drifting darkenings lurid as the flying mantles of the\r\nhurricane.\r\n\r\nAnd through the light, like showers of jewels, myriads of birds,\r\ndarting, dipping, soaring, and still other myriads of gigantic,\r\nshimmering butterflies.\r\n\r\nA sound came to us, reaching out like the first faint susurrus of the\r\nincoming tide; sighing, sighing, growing stronger--now its mournful\r\nwhispering quivered all about us, shook us--then passing like a\r\nPresence, died away in far distances.\r\n\r\n\"The Portal!\" said Rador.  \"Lugur has entered!\"\r\n\r\nHe, too, parted the fronds and peered back along our path.  Peering\r\nwith him we saw the barrier through which we had come stretching\r\nverdure-covered walls for miles three or more away. Like a mole burrow\r\nin a garden stretched the trail of the tunnel; here and there we could\r\nlook down within the rift at its top; far off in it I thought I saw\r\nthe glint of spears.\r\n\r\n\"They come!\" whispered Rador.  \"Quick!  We must not meet them here!\"\r\n\r\nAnd then--\r\n\r\n\"Holy St. Brigid!\" gasped Larry.\r\n\r\nFrom the rift in the tunnel's continuation, nigh a mile beyond the\r\ncleft through which we had fled, lifted a crown of horns--of\r\ntentacles--erect, alert, of mottled gold and crimson; lifted\r\nhigher--and from a monstrous scarlet head beneath them blazed two\r\nenormous, obloid eyes, their depths wells of purplish phosphorescence;\r\nhigher still--noseless, earless, chinless; a livid, worm mouth from\r\nwhich a slender scarlet tongue leaped like playing flames! Slowly it\r\nrose--its mighty neck cuirassed with gold and scarlet scales from\r\nwhose polished surfaces the amber light glinted like flakes of fire;\r\nand under this neck shimmered something like a palely luminous silvery\r\nshield, guarding it. The head of horror mounted--and in the shield's\r\ncentre, full ten feet across, glowing, flickering, shining\r\nout--coldly, was a rose of white flame, a \"flower of cold fire\" even\r\nas Rador had said.\r\n\r\nNow swiftly the Thing upreared, standing like a scaled tower a hundred\r\nfeet above the rift, its eyes scanning that movement I had seen along\r\nthe course of its lair. There was a hissing; the crown of horns fell,\r\nwhipped and writhed like the tentacles of an octopus; the towering\r\nlength dropped back.\r\n\r\n\"Quick!\" gasped Rador and through the fern moss, along the path and\r\ndown the other side of the steep we raced.\r\n\r\nBehind us for an instant there was a rushing as of a torrent; a\r\nfar-away, faint, agonized screaming--silence!\r\n\r\n\"No fear _now_ from those who followed,\" whispered the green dwarf,\r\npausing.\r\n\r\n\"Sainted St. Patrick!\" O'Keefe gazed ruminatively at his automatic.\r\n\"An' he expected me to kill _that_ with this. Well, as Fergus O'Connor\r\nsaid when they sent him out to slaughter a wild bull with a potato\r\nknife: 'Ye'll niver rayilize how I appreciate the confidence ye show\r\nin me!'\r\n\r\n\"What was it, Doc?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"The dragon worm!\" Rador said.\r\n\r\n\"It was Helvede Orm--the hell worm!\" groaned Olaf.\r\n\r\n\"There you go again--\" blazed Larry; but the green dwarf was hurrying\r\ndown the path and swiftly we followed, Larry muttering, Olaf mumbling,\r\nbehind me.\r\n\r\nThe green dwarf was signalling us for caution.  He pointed through a\r\nbreak in a grove of fifty-foot cedar mosses--we were skirting the\r\nglassy road! Scanning it we found no trace of Lugur and wondered\r\nwhether he too had seen the worm and had fled. Quickly we passed on;\r\ndrew away from the _coria_ path. The mosses began to thin; less and\r\nless they grew, giving way to low clumps that barely offered us\r\nshelter. Unexpectedly another screen of fern moss stretched before us.\r\nSlowly Rador made his way through it and stood hesitating.\r\n\r\nThe scene in front of us was oddly weird and depressing; in some\r\nindefinable way--dreadful. Why, I could not tell, but the impression\r\nwas plain; I shrank from it. Then, self-analyzing, I wondered whether\r\nit could be the uncanny resemblance the heaps of curious mossy fungi\r\nscattered about had to beast and bird--yes, and to man--that was the\r\ncause of it. Our path ran between a few of them. To the left they were\r\nthick. They were viridescent, almost metallic hued--verd-antique.\r\nCuriously indeed were they like distorted images of dog and deerlike\r\nforms, of birds--of _dwarfs_ and here and there the simulacra of the\r\ngiant frogs! Spore cases, yellowish green, as large as mitres and much\r\nresembling them in shape protruded from the heaps. My repulsion grew\r\ninto a distinct nausea.\r\n\r\nRador turned to us a face whiter far than that with which he had\r\nlooked upon the dragon worm.\r\n\r\n\"Now for your lives,\" he whispered, \"tread softly here as I do--and\r\nspeak not at all!\"\r\n\r\nHe stepped forward on tiptoe, slowly with utmost caution. We crept\r\nafter him; passed the heaps beside the path--and as I passed my skin\r\ncrept and I shrank and saw the others shrink too with that unnameable\r\nloathing; nor did the green dwarf pause until he had reached the brow\r\nof a small hillock a hundred yards beyond. And he was trembling.\r\n\r\n\"Now what are we up against?\" grumbled O'Keefe.\r\n\r\nThe green dwarf stretched a hand; stiffened; gazed over to the left of\r\nus beyond a lower hillock upon whose broad crest lay a file of the\r\nmoss shapes. They fringed it, their mitres having a grotesque\r\nappearance of watching what lay below. The glistening road lay\r\nthere--and from it came a shout. A dozen of the _coria_ clustered,\r\nfilled with Lugur's men and in one of them Lugur himself, laughing\r\nwickedly!\r\n\r\nThere was a rush of soldiers and up the low hillock raced a score of\r\nthem toward us.\r\n\r\n\"Run!\" shouted Rador.\r\n\r\n\"Not much!\" grunted Larry--and took swift aim at Lugur. The automatic\r\nspat: Olaf's echoed. Both bullets went wild, for Lugur, still\r\nlaughing, threw himself into the protection of the body of his shell.\r\nBut following the shots, from the file of moss heaps on the crest,\r\ncame a series of muffled explosions. Under the pistol's concussions\r\nthe mitred caps had burst and instantly all about the running soldiers\r\ngrew a cloud of tiny, glistening white spores--like a little cloud of\r\npuff-ball dust many times magnified. Through this cloud I glimpsed\r\ntheir faces, stricken with agony.\r\n\r\nSome turned to fly, but before they could take a second step stood\r\nrigid.\r\n\r\nThe spore cloud drifted and eddied about them; rained down on their\r\nheads and half bare breasts, covered their garments--and swiftly they\r\nbegan to change! Their features grew indistinct--merged! The\r\nglistening white spores that covered them turned to a pale yellow,\r\ngrew greenish, spread and swelled, darkened. The eyes of one of the\r\nsoldiers glinted for a moment--and then were covered by the swift\r\ngrowth!\r\n\r\nWhere but a few moments before had been men were only grotesque heaps,\r\nswiftly melting, swiftly rounding into the semblance of the mounds\r\nthat lay behind us--and already beginning to take on their gleam of\r\nancient viridescence!\r\n\r\nThe Irishman was gripping my arm fiercely; the pain brought me back to\r\nmy senses.\r\n\r\n\"Olaf's right,\" he gasped.  \"This _is_ hell!  I'm sick.\" And he was,\r\nfrankly and without restraint. Lugur and his others awakened from\r\ntheir nightmare; piled into the _coria_, wheeled, raced away.\r\n\r\n\"On!\" said Rador thickly. \"Two perils have we passed--the Silent Ones\r\nwatch over us!\"\r\n\r\nSoon we were again among the familiar and so unfamiliar moss giants.\r\nI knew what I had seen and this time Larry could not call\r\nme--superstitious. In the jungles of Borneo I had examined that other\r\nswiftly developing fungus which wreaks the vengeance of some of the\r\nhill tribes upon those who steal their women; gripping with its\r\nmicroscopic hooks into the flesh; sending quick, tiny rootlets through\r\nthe skin down into the capillaries, sucking life and thriving and\r\nnever to be torn away until the living thing it clings to has been\r\nsapped dry. Here was but another of the species in which the\r\ndevelopment's rate was incredibly accelerated. Some of this I tried to\r\nexplain to O'Keefe as we sped along, reassuring him.\r\n\r\n\"But they turned to moss before our eyes!\" he said.\r\n\r\nAgain I explained, patiently.  But he seemed to derive no comfort at\r\nall from my assurances that the phenomena were entirely natural and,\r\naside from their more terrifying aspect, of peculiar interest to the\r\nbotanist.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" was all he would say.  \"But suppose one of those things had\r\nburst while we were going through--God!\"\r\n\r\nI was wondering how I could with comparative safety study the fungus\r\nwhen Rador stopped; in front of us was again the road ribbon.\r\n\r\n\"Now is all danger passed,\" he said.  \"The way lies open and Lugur has\r\nfled--\"\r\n\r\nThere was a flash from the road.  It passed me like a little lariat of\r\nlight. It struck Larry squarely between the eyes, spread over his face\r\nand drew itself within!\r\n\r\n\"Down!\" cried Rador, and hurled me to the ground.  My head struck\r\nsharply; I felt myself grow faint; Olaf fell beside me; I saw the\r\ngreen dwarf draw down the O'Keefe; he collapsed limply, face still,\r\neyes staring. A shout--and from the roadway poured a host of Lugur's\r\nmen; I could hear Lugur bellowing.\r\n\r\nThere came a rush of little feet; soft, fragrant draperies brushed my\r\nface; dimly I watched Lakla bend over the Irishman.\r\n\r\nShe straightened--her arms swept out and the writhing vine, with its\r\ntendrilled heads of ruby bloom, five flames of misty incandescence,\r\nleaped into the faces of the soldiers now close upon us. It darted at\r\ntheir throats, striking, coiling, and striking again; coiling and\r\nuncoiling with incredible rapidity and flying from leverage points of\r\nthroats, of faces, of breasts like a spring endowed with\r\nconsciousness, volition and hatred--and those it struck stood rigid as\r\nstone with faces masks of inhuman fear and anguish; and those still\r\nunstricken fled.\r\n\r\nAnother rush of feet--and down upon Lugur's forces poured the\r\nfrog-men, their booming giant leading, thrusting with their lances,\r\ntearing and rending with talons and fangs and spurs.\r\n\r\nAgainst that onslaught the dwarfs could not stand.  They raced for the\r\nshells; I heard Lugur shouting, menacingly--and then Lakla's voice,\r\npealing like a golden bugle of wrath.\r\n\r\n\"Go, Lugur!\" she cried.  \"Go--that you and Yolara and your Shining One\r\nmay die together! Death for you, Lugur--death for you all! Remember\r\nLugur--death!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a great noise within my head--no matter, Lakla was\r\nhere--Lakla here--but too late--Lugur had outplayed us; moss death nor\r\ndragon worm had frightened him away--he had crept back to trap\r\nus--Lakla had come too late--Larry was dead--Larry! But I had heard no\r\nbanshee wailing--and Larry had said he could not die without that\r\nwarning--no, Larry was not dead. So ran the turbulent current of my\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nA horny arm lifted me; two enormous, oddly gentle saucer eyes were\r\nstaring into mine; my head rolled; I caught a glimpse of the Golden\r\nGirl kneeling beside the O'Keefe.\r\n\r\nThe noise in my head grew thunderous--was carrying me away on its\r\nthunder--swept me into soft, blind darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nThe Crimson Sea\r\n\r\nI was in the heart of a rose pearl, swinging, swinging; no, I was in a\r\nrosy dawn cloud, pendulous in space. Consciousness flooded me, in\r\nreality I was in the arms of one of the man frogs, carrying me as\r\nthough I were a babe, and we were passing through some place suffused\r\nwith glow enough like heart of pearl or dawn cloud to justify my\r\nawakening vagaries.\r\n\r\nJust ahead walked Lakla in earnest talk with Rador, and content enough\r\nwas I for a time to watch her. She had thrown off the metallic robes;\r\nher thick braids of golden brown hair with their flame glints of\r\nbronze were twined in a high coronal meshed in silken net of green;\r\nlittle clustering curls escaped from it, clinging to the nape of the\r\nproud white neck, shyly kissing it. From her shoulders fell a loose,\r\nsleeveless garment of shimmering green belted with a high golden\r\ngirdle; skirt folds dropping barely below the knees.\r\n\r\nShe had cast aside her buskins, too, and the slender, high-arched feet\r\nwere sandalled. Between the buckled edges of her kirtle I caught\r\ngleams of translucent ivory as exquisitely moulded, as delectably\r\nrounded, as those revealed so naively beneath the hem.\r\n\r\nSomething was knocking at the doors of my consciousness--some tragic\r\nthing. What was it? Larry! Where was Larry? I remembered; raised my\r\nhead abruptly; saw at my side another frog-man carrying O'Keefe, and\r\nbehind him, Olaf, step instinct with grief, following like some\r\nfaithful, wistful dog who has lost a loved master. Upon my movement\r\nthe monster bearing me halted, looked down inquiringly, uttered a\r\ndeep, booming note that held the quality of interrogation.\r\n\r\nLakla turned; the clear, golden eyes were sorrowful, the sweet mouth\r\ndrooping; but her loveliness, her gentleness, that undefinable\r\nsynthesis of all her tender self that seemed always to circle her with\r\nan atmosphere of lucid normality, lulled my panic.\r\n\r\n\"Drink this,\" she commanded, holding a small vial to my lips.\r\n\r\nIts contents were aromatic, unfamiliar but astonishingly effective,\r\nfor as soon as they passed my lips I felt a surge of strength;\r\nconsciousness was restored.\r\n\r\n\"Larry!\" I cried.  \"Is he dead?\"\r\n\r\nLakla shook her head; her eyes were troubled.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she said; \"but he is like one dead--and yet unlike--\"\r\n\r\n\"Put me down,\" I demanded of my bearer.\r\n\r\nHe tightened his hold; round eyes upon the Golden Girl. She spoke--in\r\nsonorous, reverberating monosyllables--and I was set upon my feet; I\r\nleaped to the side of the Irishman. He lay limp, with a disquieting,\r\nabnormal sequacity, as though every muscle were utterly flaccid; the\r\nantithesis of the _rigor mortis_, thank God, but terrifyingly toward\r\nthe other end of its arc; a syncope I had never known. The flesh was\r\nstone cold; the pulse barely perceptible, long intervalled; the\r\nrespiration undiscoverable; the pupils of the eyes were enormously\r\ndilated; it was as though life had been drawn from every nerve.\r\n\r\n\"A light flashed from the road.  It struck his face and seemed to sink\r\nin,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"I saw,\" answered Rador; \"but what it was I know not; and I thought I\r\nknew all the weapons of our rulers.\" He glanced at me curiously. \"Some\r\ntalk there has been that the stranger who came with you, Double\r\nTongue, was making new death tools for Lugur,\" he ended.\r\n\r\nMarakinoff!  The Russian at work already in this storehouse of\r\ndevastating energies, fashioning the weapons for his plots! The\r\nApocalyptic vision swept back upon me--\r\n\r\n\"He is not dead.\" Lakla's voice was poignant.  \"He is not dead; and\r\nthe Three have wondrous healing. They can restore him if they\r\nwill--and they will, they _will_!\" For a moment she was silent. \"Now\r\ntheir gods help Lugur and Yolara,\" she whispered; \"for come what may,\r\nwhether the Silent Ones be strong or weak, if he dies, surely shall I\r\nfall upon them and I will slay those two--yea, though I, too perish!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yolara and Lugur shall both die.\" Olaf's eyes were burning.  \"But\r\nLugur is mine to slay.\"\r\n\r\nThat pity I had seen before in Lakla's eyes when she looked upon the\r\nNorseman banished the white wrath from them. She turned, half\r\nhurriedly, as though to escape his gaze.\r\n\r\n\"Walk with us,\" she said to me, \"unless you are still weak.\"\r\n\r\nI shook my head, gave a last look at O'Keefe; there was nothing I\r\ncould do; I stepped beside her. She thrust a white arm into mine\r\nprotectingly, the wonderfully moulded hand with its long, tapering\r\nfingers catching about my wrist; my heart glowed toward her.\r\n\r\n\"Your medicine is potent, handmaiden,\" I answered.  \"And the touch of\r\nyour hand would give me strength enough, even had I not drunk it,\" I\r\nadded in Larry's best manner.\r\n\r\nHer eyes danced, trouble flying.\r\n\r\n\"Now, that was well spoken for such a man of wisdom as Rador tells me\r\nyou are,\" she laughed; and a little pang shot through me. Could not a\r\nlover of science present a compliment without it always seeming to be\r\nas unusual as plucking a damask rose from a cabinet of fossils?\r\n\r\nMustering my philosophy, I smiled back at her.  Again I noted that\r\nbroad, classic brow, with the little tendrils of shining bronze\r\ncaressing it, the tilted, delicate, nut-brown brows that gave a\r\ncurious touch of innocent _diablerie_ to the lovely face--flowerlike,\r\npure, high-bred, a touch of roguishness, subtly alluring, sparkling\r\nover the maiden Madonnaness that lay ever like a delicate, luminous\r\nsuggestion beneath it; the long, black, curling lashes--the tender,\r\nrounded, bare left breast--\r\n\r\n\"I have always liked you,\" she murmured naively, \"since first I saw\r\nyou in that place where the Shining One goes forth into your world.\r\nAnd I am glad you like my medicine as well as that you carry in the\r\nblack box that you left behind,\" she added swiftly.\r\n\r\n\"How know you of that, Lakla?\" I gasped.\r\n\r\n\"Oft and oft I came to him there, and to you, while you lay sleeping.\r\nHow call you _him_?\" She paused.\r\n\r\n\"Larry!\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Larry!\" she repeated it excellently.  \"And you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Goodwin,\" said Rador.\r\n\r\nI bowed quite as though I were being introduced to some charming young\r\nlady met in that old life now seemingly aeons removed.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--Goodwin.\" she said.  \"Oft and oft I came.  Sometimes I thought\r\nyou saw me. And _he_--did he not dream of me sometime--?\" she asked\r\nwistfully.\r\n\r\n\"He did.\" I said, \"and watched for you.\" Then amazement grew vocal.\r\n\"But how came you?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"By a strange road,\" she whispered, \"to see that all was well with\r\n_him_--and to look into his heart; for I feared Yolara and her beauty.\r\nBut I saw that she was not in his heart.\" A blush burned over her,\r\nturning even the little bare breast rosy. \"It is a strange road,\" she\r\nwent on hurriedly. \"Many times have I followed it and watched the\r\nShining One bear back its prey to the blue pool; seen the woman _he_\r\nseeks\"--she made a quick gesture toward Olaf--\"and a babe cast from\r\nher arms in the last pang of her mother love; seen another woman throw\r\nherself into the Shining One's embrace to save a man she loved; and I\r\ncould not help!\" Her voice grew deep, thrilled. \"The friend, it comes\r\nto me, who drew you here, Goodwin!\"\r\n\r\nShe was silent, walking as one who sees visions and listens to voices\r\nunheard by others, Rador made a warning gesture; I crowded back my\r\nquestions, glanced about me. We were passing over a smooth strand,\r\nhard packed as some beach of long-thrust-back ocean. It was like\r\ncrushed garnets, each grain stained deep red, faintly sparkling. On\r\neach side were distances, the floor stretching away into them bare of\r\nvegetation--stretching on and on into infinitudes of rosy mist, even\r\nas did the space above.\r\n\r\nFlanking and behind us marched the giant batrachians, fivescore of\r\nthem at least, black scale and crimson scale lustrous and gleaming in\r\nthe rosaceous radiance; saucer eyes shining circles of phosphorescence\r\ngreen, purple, red; spurs clicking as they crouched along with a gait\r\nat once grotesque and formidable.\r\n\r\nAhead the mist deepened into a ruddier glow; through it a long, dark\r\nline began to appear--the mouth I thought of the caverned space\r\nthrough which we were going; it was just before us; over us--we stood\r\nbathed in a flood of rubescence!\r\n\r\nA sea stretched before us--a crimson sea, gleaming like that lost\r\nlacquer of royal coral and the Flame Dragon's blood which Fu S'cze set\r\nupon the bower he built for his stolen sun maiden--that going toward\r\nit she might think it the sun itself rising over the summer seas.\r\nUnmoved by wave or ripple, it was placid as some deep woodland pool\r\nwhen night rushes up over the world.\r\n\r\nIt seemed molten--or as though some hand great enough to rock earth\r\nhad distilled here from conflagrations of autumn sunsets their flaming\r\nessences.\r\n\r\nA fish broke through, large as a shark, blunt-headed, flashing bronze,\r\nridged and mailed as though with serrate plates of armour. It leaped\r\nhigh, shaking from it a sparkling spray of rubies; dropped and shot up\r\na geyser of fiery gems.\r\n\r\nAcross my line of vision, moving stately over the sea, floated a half\r\nglobe, luminous, diaphanous, its iridescence melting into turquoise,\r\nthence to amethyst, to orange, to scarlet shot with rose, to\r\nvermilion, a translucent green, thence back into the iridescence;\r\nbehind it four others, and the least of them ten feet in diameter, and\r\nthe largest no less than thirty. They drifted past like bubbles blown\r\nfrom froth of rainbows by pipes in mouths of Titans' young. Then from\r\nthe base of one arose a tangle of shimmering strands, long, slender\r\nwhiplashes that played about and sank slowly again beneath the crimson\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nI gasped--for the fish had been a _ganoid_--that ancient, armoured\r\nform that was perhaps the most intelligent of all life on our planet\r\nduring the Devonian era, but which for age upon age had vanished, save\r\nfor its fossils held in the embrace of the stone that once was their\r\nsoft bottom beds; and the half-globes were _Medusae_, jelly-fish--but\r\nof a size, luminosity, and colour unheard of.\r\n\r\nNow Lakla cupped her mouth with pink palms and sent a clarion note\r\nringing out. The ledge on which we stood continued a few hundred feet\r\nbefore us, falling abruptly, though from no great height to the\r\nCrimson Sea; at right and left it extended in a long semicircle.\r\nTurning to the right whence she had sent her call, I saw rising a mile\r\nor more away, veiled lightly by the haze, a rainbow, a gigantic\r\nprismatic arch, flattened, I thought, by some quality of the strange\r\natmosphere. It sprang from the ruddy strand, leaped the crimson tide,\r\nand dropped three miles away upon a precipitous, jagged upthrust of\r\nrock frowning black from the lacquered depths.\r\n\r\nAnd surmounting a higher ledge beyond this upthrust a huge dome of\r\ndull gold, Cyclopean, striking eyes and mind with something unhumanly\r\nalien, baffling; sending the mind groping, as though across the\r\ndeserts of space, from some far-flung star, should fall upon us linked\r\nsounds, coherent certainly, meaningful surely, vaguely familiar--yet\r\nnever to be translated into any symbol or thought of our own\r\nparticular planet.\r\n\r\nThe sea of crimson lacquer, with its floating moons of luminous\r\ncolour--this bow of prismed stone leaping to the weird isle crowned by\r\nthe anomalous, aureate excrescence--the half human batrachians-the\r\nelfland through which we had passed, with all its hidden wonders and\r\nterrors--I felt the foundations of my cherished knowledge shaking.\r\nWas this all a dream? Was this body of mine lying somewhere, fighting\r\na fevered death, and all these but images floating through the\r\nbreaking chambers of my brain? My knees shook; involuntarily I\r\ngroaned.\r\n\r\nLakla turned, looked at me anxiously, slipped a soft arm behind me,\r\nheld me till the vertigo passed.\r\n\r\n\"Patience,\" she said.  \"The bearers come.  Soon you shall rest.\"\r\n\r\nI looked; down toward us from the bow's end were leaping swiftly\r\nanother score of the frog-men. Some bore litters, high, handled, not\r\nunlike palanquins--\r\n\r\n\"Asgard!\" Olaf stood beside me, eyes burning, pointing to the arch.\r\n\"Bifrost Bridge, sharp as sword edge, over which souls go to Valhalla.\r\nAnd _she_--she is a Valkyr--a sword maiden, _Ja!_\"\r\n\r\nI gripped the Norseman's hand.  It was hot, and a pang of remorse shot\r\nthrough me. If this place had so shaken me, how must it have shaken\r\nOlaf? It was with relief that I watched him, at Lakla's gentle\r\ncommand, drop into one of the litters and lie back, eyes closed, as\r\ntwo of the monsters raised its yoke to their scaled shoulders. Nor was\r\nit without further relief that I myself lay back on the soft velvety\r\ncushions of another.\r\n\r\nThe cavalcade began to move.  Lakla had ordered O'Keefe placed beside\r\nher, and she sat, knees crossed Orient fashion, leaning over the pale\r\nhead on her lap, the white, tapering fingers straying fondly through\r\nhis hair.\r\n\r\nPresently I saw her reach up, slowly unwind the coronal of her\r\ntresses, shake them loose, and let them fall like a veil over her and\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHer head bent low; I heard a soft sobbing--I turned away my gaze, lorn\r\nenough in my own heart, God knew!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nThe Three Silent Ones\r\n\r\nThe arch was closer--and in my awe I forgot for the moment Larry and\r\naught else. For this was no rainbow, no thing born of light and mist,\r\nno Bifrost Bridge of myth--no! It was a flying arch of stone, stained\r\nwith flares of Tyrian purples, of royal scarlets, of blues dark as the\r\nGulf Stream's ribbon, sapphires soft as midday May skies, splashes of\r\nchromes and greens--a palette of giantry, a bridge of wizardry; a\r\nhundred, nay, a thousand, times greater than that of Utah which the\r\nNavaho call Nonnegozche and worship, as well they may, as a god, and\r\nwhich is itself a rainbow in eternal rock.\r\n\r\nIt sprang from the ledge and winged its prodigious length in one low\r\narc over the sea's crimson breast, as though in some ancient paroxysm\r\nof earth it had been hurled molten, crystallizing into that stupendous\r\nspan and still flaming with the fires that had moulded it.\r\n\r\nCloser we came and closer, while I watched spellbound; now we were at\r\nits head, and the litter-bearers swept upon it. All of five hundred\r\nfeet wide it was, surface smooth as a city road, sides low walled,\r\ncurving inward as though in the jetting-out of its making the edges of\r\nthe plastic rock had curled.\r\n\r\nOn and on we sped; the high thrusting precipices upon which the\r\nbridge's far end rested, frowned close; the enigmatic, dully shining\r\ndome loomed ever greater. Now we had reached that end; were passing\r\nover a smooth plaza whose level floor was enclosed, save for a rift in\r\nfront of us, by the fanged tops of the black cliffs.\r\n\r\nFrom this rift stretched another span, half a mile long, perhaps,\r\nwidening at its centre into a broad platform, continuing straight to\r\ntwo massive gates set within the face of the second cliff wall like\r\npanels, and of the same dull gold as the dome rising high beyond. And\r\nthis smaller arch leaped a pit, an abyss, of which the outer\r\nprecipices were the rim holding back from the pit the red flood.\r\n\r\nWe were rapidly approaching; now upon the platform; my bearers were\r\nstriding closely along the side; I leaned far out--a giddiness seized\r\nme! I gazed down into depth upon vertiginous depth; an abyss\r\nindeed--an abyss dropping to world's base like that in which the\r\nBabylonians believed writhed Talaat, the serpent mother of Chaos; a\r\npit that struck down into earth's heart itself.\r\n\r\nNow, what was that--distance upon unfathomable distance below?  A\r\nstupendous glowing like the green fire of life itself. What was it\r\nlike? I had it! It was like the corona of the sun in eclipse--that\r\nburgeoning that makes of our luminary when moon veils it an incredible\r\nblossoming of splendours in the black heavens.\r\n\r\nAnd strangely, strangely, it was like the Dweller's beauty when with\r\nits dazzling spirallings and writhings it raced amid its storm of\r\ncrystal bell sounds!\r\n\r\nThe abyss was behind us; we had paused at the golden portals; they\r\nswung inward. A wide corridor filled with soft light was before us,\r\nand on its threshold stood--bizarre, yellow gems gleaming, huge muzzle\r\nwide in what was evidently meant for a smile of welcome--the woman\r\nfrog of the Moon Pool wall.\r\n\r\nLakla raised her head; swept back the silken tent of her hair and\r\ngazed at me with eyes misty from weeping. The frog-woman crept to her\r\nside; gazed down upon Larry; spoke--_spoke_--to the Golden Girl in a\r\nswift stream of the sonorous, reverberant monosyllables; and Lakla\r\nanswered her in kind. The webbed digits swept over O'Keefe's face,\r\nfelt at his heart; she shook her head and moved ahead of us up the\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nStill borne in the litters we went on, winding, ascending until at\r\nlast they were set down in a great hall carpeted with soft fragrant\r\nrushes and into which from high narrow slits streamed the crimson\r\nlight from without.\r\n\r\nI jumped over to Larry, there had been no change in his condition;\r\nstill the terrifying limpness, the slow, infrequent pulsation. Rador\r\nand Olaf--and the fever now seemed to be gone from him--came and stood\r\nbeside me, silent.\r\n\r\n\"I go to the Three,\" said Lakla.  \"Wait you here.\"  She passed through\r\na curtaining; then as swiftly as she had gone she returned through the\r\nhangings, tresses braided, a swathing of golden gauze about her.\r\n\r\n\"Rador,\" she said, \"bear you Larry--for into your heart the Silent\r\nOnes would look. And fear nothing,\" she added at the green dwarf's\r\ndisconcerted, almost fearful start.\r\n\r\nRador bowed, was thrust aside by Olaf.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the Norseman; \"I will carry him.\"\r\n\r\nHe lifted Larry like a child against his broad breast.  The dwarf\r\nglanced quickly at Lakla; she nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" she commanded, and held aside the folds.\r\n\r\nOf that journey I have few memories.  I only know that we went through\r\ncorridor upon corridor; successions of vast halls and chambers, some\r\ncarpeted with the rushes, others with rugs into which the feet sank as\r\ninto deep, soft meadows; spaces illumined by the rubrous light, and\r\nspaces in which softer lights held sway.\r\n\r\nWe paused before a slab of the same crimson stone as that the green\r\ndwarf had called the portal, and upon its polished surface weaved the\r\nsame unnameable symbols. The Golden Girl pressed upon its side; it\r\nslipped softly back; a torrent of opalescence gushed out of the\r\nopening--and as one in a dream I entered.\r\n\r\nWe were, I knew, just under the dome; but for the moment, caught in\r\nthe flood of radiance, I could see nothing. It was like being held\r\nwithin a fire opal--so brilliant, so flashing, was it. I closed my\r\neyes, opened them; the lambency cascaded from the vast curves of the\r\nglobular walls; in front of me was a long, narrow opening in them,\r\nthrough which, far away, I could see the end of the wizards' bridge\r\nand the ledged mouth of the cavern through which we had come; against\r\nthe light from within beat the crimson light from without--and was\r\nchecked as though by a barrier.\r\n\r\nI felt Lakla's touch; turned.\r\n\r\nA hundred paces away was a dais, its rim raised a yard above the\r\nfloor. From the edge of this rim streamed upward a steady, coruscating\r\nmist of the opalescence, veined even as was that of the Dweller's\r\nshining core and shot with milky shadows like curdled moonlight; up it\r\nstretched like a wall.\r\n\r\nOver it, from it, down upon me, gazed three faces--two clearly male,\r\none a woman's. At the first I thought them statues, and then the eyes\r\nof them gave the lie to me; for the eyes were alive, terribly, and if\r\nI could admit the word--_supernaturally_--alive.\r\n\r\nThey were thrice the size of the human eye and triangular, the apex of\r\nthe angle upward; black as jet, pupilless, filled with tiny, leaping\r\nred flames.\r\n\r\nOver them were foreheads, not as ours--high and broad and visored;\r\ntheir sides drawn forward into a vertical ridge, a prominence, an\r\nupright wedge, somewhat like the visored heads of a few of the great\r\nlizards--and the heads, long, narrowing at the back, were fully twice\r\nthe size of mankind's!\r\n\r\nUpon the brows were caps--and with a fearful certainty I knew that\r\nthey were _not_ caps--long, thick strands of gleaming yellow, feathered\r\nscales thin as sequins! Sharp, curving noses like the beaks of the\r\ngiant condors; mouths thin, austere; long, powerful, pointed chins;\r\nthe--_flesh_--of the faces white as the whitest marble; and wreathing\r\nup to them, covering all their bodies, the shimmering, curdled, misty\r\nfires of opalescence!\r\n\r\nOlaf stood rigid; my own heart leaped wildly.  What--what were these\r\nbeings?\r\n\r\nI forced myself to look again--and from their gaze streamed a current\r\nof reassurance, of good will--nay, of intense spiritual strength. I\r\nsaw that they were not fierce, not ruthless, not inhuman, despite\r\ntheir strangeness; no, they were kindly; in some unmistakable way,\r\nbenign and sorrowful--so sorrowful! I straightened, gazed back at them\r\nfearlessly. Olaf drew a deep breath, gazed steadily too, the hardness,\r\nthe despair wiped from his face.\r\n\r\nNow Lakla drew closer to the dais; the three pairs of eyes searched\r\nhers, the woman's with an ineffable tenderness; some message seemed to\r\npass between the Three and the Golden Girl. She bowed low, turned to\r\nthe Norseman.\r\n\r\n\"Place Larry there,\" she said softly--\"there at the feet of the Silent\r\nOnes.\"\r\n\r\nShe pointed into the radiant mist; Olaf started, hesitated, stared\r\nfrom Lakla to the Three, searched for a moment their eyes--and\r\nsomething like a smile drifted through them. He stepped forward,\r\nlifted O'Keefe, set him squarely within the covering light. It\r\nwavered, rolled upward, swirled about the body, steadied again--and\r\nwithin it there was no sign of Larry!\r\n\r\nAgain the mist wavered, shook, and seemed to climb higher, hiding the\r\nchins, the beaked noses, the brows of that incredible Trinity--but\r\nbefore it ceased to climb, I thought the yellow feathered heads bent;\r\nsensed a movement as though they lifted something.\r\n\r\nThe mist fell; the eyes gleamed out again, inscrutable.\r\n\r\nAnd groping out of the radiance, pausing at the verge of the dais,\r\nleaping down from it, came Larry, laughing, filled with life, blinking\r\nas one who draws from darkness into sunshine. He saw Lakla, sprang to\r\nher, gripped her in his arms.\r\n\r\n\"Lakla!\" he cried. \"Mavourneen!\"  She slipped from his embrace,\r\nblushing, glancing at the Three shyly, half-fearfully. And again I saw\r\nthe tenderness creep into the inky, flame-shot orbs of the woman\r\nbeing; and a tenderness in the others too--as though they regarded\r\nsome well-beloved child.\r\n\r\n\"You lay in the arms of Death, Larry,\" she said.  \"And the Silent Ones\r\ndrew you from him. Do homage to the Silent Ones, Larry, for they are\r\ngood and they are mighty!\"\r\n\r\nShe turned his head with one of the long, white hands--and he looked\r\ninto the faces of the Three; looked long, was shaken even as had been\r\nOlaf and myself; was swept by that same wave of power and of--of--what\r\ncan I call it?--_holiness_ that streamed from them.\r\n\r\nThen for the first time I saw real awe mount into his face. Another\r\nmoment he stared--and dropped upon one knee and bowed his head before\r\nthem as would a worshipper before the shrine of his saint. And--I am\r\nnot ashamed to tell it--I joined him; and with us knelt Lakla and\r\nOlaf and Rador.\r\n\r\nThe mist of fiery opal swirled up about the Three; hid them.\r\n\r\nAnd with a long, deep, joyous sigh Lakla took Larry's hand, drew him\r\nto his feet, and silently we followed them out of that hall of wonder.\r\n\r\nBut why, in going, did the thought come to me that from where the\r\nThree sat throned they ever watched the cavern mouth that was the door\r\ninto their abode; and looked down ever into the unfathomable depth in\r\nwhich glowed and pulsed that mystic flower, colossal, awesome, of\r\ngreen flame that had seemed to me fire of life itself?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nThe Wooing of Lakla\r\n\r\nI had slept soundly and dreamlessly; I wakened quietly in the great\r\nchamber into which Rador had ushered O'Keefe and myself after that\r\nculminating experience of crowded, nerve-racking hours--the facing of\r\nthe Three.\r\n\r\nNow, lying gazing upward at the high-vaulted ceiling, I heard Larry's\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\"They look like birds.\" Evidently he was thinking of the Three; a\r\nsilence--then: \"Yes, they look like _birds_--and they look, and it's\r\nmeaning no disrespect to them I am at all, they look like\r\n_lizards_\"--and another silence--\"they look like some sort of gods, and,\r\nby the good sword-arm of Brian Boru, they look human, too! And it's\r\n_none_ of them they are either, so what--what the--what the sainted St.\r\nBridget are they?\" Another short silence, and then in a tone of awed\r\nand absolute conviction: \"That's it, sure! That's what they are--it\r\nall hangs in--they couldn't be anything else--\"\r\n\r\nHe gave a whoop; a pillow shot over and caught me across the head.\r\n\r\n\"Wake up!\" shouted Larry.  \"Wake up, ye seething caldron of fossilized\r\nsuperstitions! Wake up, ye bogy-haunted man of scientific unwisdom!\"\r\n\r\nUnder pillow and insults I bounced to my feet, filled for a moment\r\nwith quite real wrath; he lay back, roaring with laughter, and my\r\nanger was swept away.\r\n\r\n\"Doc,\" he said, very seriously, after this, \"I know who the Three\r\nare!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" I queried, with studied sarcasm.\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" he mimicked.  \"Yes!  Ye--ye\" He paused under the menace of my\r\nlook, grinned. \"Yes, I know,\" he continued. \"They're of the Tuatha De,\r\nthe old ones, the great people of Ireland, _that's_ who they are!\"\r\n\r\nI knew, of course, of the Tuatha De Danann, the tribes of the god\r\nDanu, the half-legendary, half-historical clan who found their home in\r\nErin some four thousand years before the Christian era, and who have\r\nleft so deep an impress upon the Celtic mind and its myths.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Larry again, \"the Tuatha De--the Ancient Ones who had\r\nspells that could compel Mananan, who is the spirit of all the seas,\r\nan' Keithor, who is the god of all green living things, an' even\r\nHesus, the unseen god, whose pulse is the pulse of all the firmament;\r\nyes, an' Orchil too, who sits within the earth an' weaves with the\r\nshuttle of mystery and her three looms of birth an' life an'\r\ndeath--even Orchil would weave as they commanded!\"\r\n\r\nHe was silent--then:\r\n\r\n\"They are of them--the mighty ones--why else would I have bent my knee\r\nto them as I would have to the spirit of my dead mother? Why else\r\nwould Lakla, whose gold-brown hair is the hair of Eilidh the Fair,\r\nwhose mouth is the sweet mouth of Deirdre, an' whose soul walked with\r\nmine ages agone among the fragrant green myrtle of Erin, serve them?\"\r\nhe whispered, eyes full of dream.\r\n\r\n\"Have you any idea how they got here?\" I asked, not unreasonably.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't thought about that,\" he replied somewhat testily.  \"But at\r\nonce, me excellent man o' wisdom, a number occur to me. One of them is\r\nthat this little party of three might have stopped here on their way\r\nto Ireland, an' for good reasons of their own decided to stay a while;\r\nan' another is that they might have come here afterward, havin' got\r\nwind of what those rats out there were contemplatin', and have stayed\r\non the job till the time was ripe to save Ireland from 'em; the rest\r\nof the world, too, of course,\" he added magnanimously, \"but Ireland in\r\nparticular. And do any of those reasons appeal to ye?\"\r\n\r\nI shook my head.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do you think?\" he asked wearily.\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" I said cautiously, \"that we face an evolution of highly\r\nintelligent beings from ancestral sources radically removed from those\r\nthrough which mankind ascended. These half-human, highly developed\r\nbatrachians they call the _Akka_ prove that evolution in these\r\ncaverned spaces has certainly pursued one different path than on\r\nearth. The Englishman, Wells, wrote an imaginative and very\r\nentertaining book concerning an invasion of earth by Martians, and he\r\nmade his Martians enormously specialized cuttlefish. There was nothing\r\ninherently improbable in Wells' choice. Man is the ruling animal of\r\nearth today solely by reason of a series of accidents; under another\r\nseries spiders or ants, or even elephants, could have become the\r\ndominant race.\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" I said, even more cautiously, \"that the race to which the\r\nThree belong never appeared on earth's surface; that their development\r\ntook place here, unhindered through aeons. And if this be true, the\r\nstructure of their brains, and therefore all their reactions, must be\r\ndifferent from ours. Hence their knowledge and command of energies\r\nunfamiliar to us--and hence also the question whether they may not\r\nhave an entirely different sense of values, of justice--and that is\r\nrather terrifying,\" I concluded.\r\n\r\nLarry shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"That last sort of knocks your argument, Doc,\" he said. \"They had\r\nsense of justice enough to help _me_ out--and certainly they know\r\nlove--for I saw the way they looked at Lakla; and sorrow--for there\r\nwas no mistaking that in their faces.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he went on.  \"I hold to my own idea.  They're of the Old People.\r\nThe little leprechaun knew his way here, an' I'll bet it was they who\r\nsent the word. An' if the O'Keefe banshee comes here--which save the\r\nmark!--I'll bet she'll drop in on the Silent Ones for a social visit\r\nbefore she an' her clan get busy. Well, it'll make her feel more at\r\nhome, the good old body. No, Doc, no,\" he concluded, \"I'm right; it\r\nall fits in too well to be wrong.\"\r\n\r\nI made a last despairing attempt.\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything anywhere in Ireland that would indicate that the\r\nTuatha De ever looked like the Three?\" I asked--and again I had\r\nspoken most unfortunately.\r\n\r\n\"Is there?\" he shouted.  \"Is there?  By the kilt of Cormack\r\nMacCormack, I'm glad ye reminded me. It was worryin' me a little\r\nmeself. There was Daghda, who could put on the head of a great boar\r\nan' the body of a giant fish and cleave the waves an' tear to pieces\r\nthe birlins of any who came against Erin; an' there was Rinn--\"\r\n\r\nHow many more of the metamorphoses of the Old People I might have\r\nheard, I do not know, for the curtains parted and in walked Rador.\r\n\r\n\"You have rested well,\" he smiled, \"I can see.  The handmaiden bade me\r\ncall you. You are to eat with her in her garden.\"\r\n\r\nDown long corridors we trod and out upon a gardened terrace as\r\nbeautiful as any of those of Yolara's city; bowered, blossoming,\r\nfragrant, set high upon the cliffs beside the domed castle. A table,\r\nas of milky jade, was spread at one corner, but the Golden Girl was\r\nnot there. A little path ran on and up, hemmed in by the mass of\r\nverdure. I looked at it longingly; Rador saw the glance, interpreted\r\nit, and led me up the stepped sharp slope into a rock embrasure.\r\n\r\nHere I was above the foliage, and everywhere the view was clear.\r\nBelow me stretched the incredible bridge, with the frog people\r\nhurrying back and forth upon it. A pinnacle at my side hid the abyss.\r\nMy eyes followed the cavern ledge. Above it the rock rose bare, but at\r\nthe ends of the semicircular strand a luxuriant vegetation began,\r\nstretching from the crimson shores back into far distances. Of browns\r\nand reds and yellows, like an autumn forest, was the foliage, with\r\nhere and there patches of dark-green, as of conifers. Five miles or\r\nmore, on each side, the forests swept, and then were lost to sight in\r\nthe haze.\r\n\r\nI turned and faced an immensity of crimson waters, unbroken, a true\r\nsea, if ever there was one. A breeze blew--the first real wind I had\r\nencountered in the hidden places; under it the surface, that had been\r\nas molten lacquer, rippled and dimpled. Little waves broke with a\r\nspray of rose-pearls and rubies. The giant Medusae drifted--stately,\r\nluminous kaleidoscopic elfin moons.\r\n\r\nFar down, peeping around a jutting tower of the cliff, I saw dipping\r\nwith the motion of the waves a floating garden. The flowers, too, were\r\nluminous--indeed sparkling--gleaming brilliants of scarlet and\r\nvermilions lighter than the flood on which they lay, mauves and odd\r\nshades of reddish-blue. They gleamed and shone like a little lake of\r\njewels.\r\n\r\nRador broke in upon my musings.\r\n\r\n\"Lakla comes!  Let us go down.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a shy Lakla who came slowly around the end of the path and,\r\nblushing furiously, held her hands out to Larry. And the Irishman took\r\nthem, placed them over his heart, kissed them with a tenderness that\r\nhad been lacking in the half-mocking, half-fierce caresses he had\r\ngiven the priestess. She blushed deeper, holding out the tapering\r\nfingers--then pressed them to her own heart.\r\n\r\n\"I like the touch of your lips, Larry,\" she whispered. \"They warm me\r\nhere\"--she pressed her heart again--\"and they send little sparkles of\r\nlight through me.\" Her brows tilted perplexedly, accenting the nuance\r\nof diablerie, delicate and fascinating, that they cast upon the flower\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"Do you?\" whispered the O'Keefe fervently.  \"Do you, Lakla?\" He bent\r\ntoward her. She caught the amused glance of Rador; drew herself aside\r\nhalf-haughtily.\r\n\r\n\"Rador,\" she said, \"is it not time that you and the strong one, Olaf,\r\nwere setting forth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Truly it is, handmaiden,\" he answered respectfully enough--yet with a\r\ncurrent of laughter under his words. \"But as you know the strong one,\r\nOlaf, wished to see his friends here before we were gone--and he comes\r\neven now,\" he added, glancing down the pathway, along which came\r\nstriding the Norseman.\r\n\r\nAs he faced us I saw that a transformation had been wrought in him.\r\nGone was the pitiful seeking, and gone too the just as pitiful hope.\r\nThe set face softened as he looked at the Golden Girl and bowed low to\r\nher. He thrust a hand to O'Keefe and to me.\r\n\r\n\"There is to be battle,\" he said.  \"I go with Rador to call the armies\r\nof these frog people. As for me--Lakla has spoken. There is no hope\r\nfor--for mine Helma in life, but there is hope that we destroy the\r\nShining Devil and give _mine_ Helma peace. And with that I am well\r\ncontent, _ja!_ Well content!\" He gripped our hands again. \"We will\r\nfight!\" he muttered. \"_Ja!_ And I will have vengeance!\" The sternness\r\nreturned; and with a salute Rador and he were gone.\r\n\r\nTwo great tears rolled from the golden eyes of Lakla.\r\n\r\n\"Not even the Silent Ones can heal those the Shining One has taken,\"\r\nshe said. \"He asked me--and it was better that I tell him. It is part\r\nof the Three's--_punishment_--but of that you will soon learn,\" she went\r\non hurriedly. \"Ask me no questions now of the Silent Ones. I thought\r\nit better for Olaf to go with Rador, to busy himself, to give his mind\r\nother than sorrow upon which to feed.\"\r\n\r\nUp the path came five of the frog-women, bearing platters and ewers.\r\nTheir bracelets and anklets of jewels were tinkling; their middles\r\ncovered with short kirtles of woven cloth studded with the sparkling\r\nornaments.\r\n\r\nAnd here let me say that if I have given the impression that the\r\n_Akka_ are simply magnified frogs, I regret it. Frog-like they are,\r\nand hence my phrase for them--but as unlike the frog, as we know it,\r\nas man is unlike the chimpanzee. Springing, I hazard, from the\r\nstegocephalia, the ancestor of the frogs, these batrachians followed a\r\ndifferent line of evolution and acquired the upright position just as\r\nman did his from the four-footed folk.\r\n\r\nThe great staring eyes, the shape of the muzzle were frog-like, but\r\nthe highly developed brain had set upon the head and shape of it vital\r\ndifferences. The forehead, for instance, was not low, flat, and\r\nretreating--its frontal arch was well defined. The head was, in a\r\nsense, shapely, and with the females the great horny carapace that\r\nstood over it like a fantastic helmet was much modified, as were the\r\nspurs that were so formidable in the male; colouration was different\r\nalso. The torso was upright; the legs a little bent, giving them their\r\ncrouching gait--but I wander from my subject.[1]\r\n\r\nThey set their burdens down.  Larry looked at them with interest.\r\n\r\n\"You surely have those things well trained, Lakla,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Things!\"  The handmaiden arose, eyes flashing with indignation.  \"You\r\ncall my _Akka_ things!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Larry, a bit taken aback, \"what do you call them?\"\r\n\r\n\"My _Akka_ are a _people_,\" she retorted.  \"As much a people as your race\r\nor mine. They are good and loyal, and they have speech and arts, and\r\nthey slay not, save for food or to protect themselves. And I think\r\nthem beautiful, Larry, _beautiful_!\" She stamped her foot. \"And you call\r\nthem--_things_!\"\r\n\r\nBeautiful!  These?  Yet, after all, they were, in their grotesque\r\nfashion. And to Lakla, surrounded by them, from babyhood, they were\r\nnot strange, at all. Why shouldn't she think them beautiful? The same\r\nthought must have struck O'Keefe, for he flushed guiltily.\r\n\r\n\"I think them beautiful, too, Lakla,\" he said remorsefully. \"It's my\r\nnot knowing your tongue too well that traps me. _Truly_, I think them\r\nbeautiful--I'd tell them so, if I knew their talk.\"\r\n\r\nLakla dimpled, laughed--spoke to the attendants in that strange speech\r\nthat was unquestionably a language; they bridled, looked at O'Keefe\r\nwith fantastic coquetry, cracked and boomed softly among themselves.\r\n\r\n\"They say they like _you_ better than the men of Muria,\" laughed Lakla.\r\n\r\n\"Did I ever think I'd be swapping compliments with lady frogs!\" he\r\nmurmured to me. \"Buck up, Larry--keep your eyes on the captive Irish\r\nprincess!\" he muttered to himself.\r\n\r\n\"Rador goes to meet one of the _ladala_ who is slipping through with\r\nnews,\" said the Golden Girl as we addressed ourselves to the food.\r\n\"Then, with Nak, he and Olaf go to muster the _Akka_--for there will\r\nbe battle, and we must prepare. Nak,\" she added, \"is he who went\r\nbefore me when you were dancing with Yolara, Larry.\" She stole a\r\nswift, mischievous glance at him. \"He is headman of all the _Akka_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just what forces can we muster against them when they come, darlin'?\"\r\nsaid Larry.\r\n\r\n\"Darlin'?\"--the Golden Girl had caught the caress of the word--\"what's\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a little word that means Lakla,\" he answered.  \"It does--that\r\nis, when I say it; when you say it, then it means Larry.\"\r\n\r\n\"I like that word,\" mused Lakla.\r\n\r\n\"You can even say Larry darlin'!\" suggested O'Keefe.\r\n\r\n\"Larry darlin'!\" said Lakla.  \"When they come we shall have first of\r\nall my _Akka_--\"\r\n\r\n\"Can they fight, _mavourneen_?\" interrupted Larry.\r\n\r\n\"Can they fight!  My _Akka_!\" Again her eyes flashed.  \"They will\r\nfight to the last of them--with the spears that give the swift\r\nrotting, covered, as they are, with the jelly of those _Saddu_\r\nthere--\" She pointed through a rift in the foliage across which, on\r\nthe surface of the sea, was floating one of the moon globes--and now I\r\nknow why Rador had warned Larry against a plunge there. \"With spears\r\nand clubs and with teeth and nails and spurs--they are a strong and\r\nbrave people, Larry--darlin', and though they hurl the _Keth_ at them,\r\nit is slow to work upon them, and they slay even while they are\r\npassing into the nothingness!\"\r\n\r\n\"And have we none of the _Keth_?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"No\"--she shook her head--\"none of their weapons have we here,\r\nalthough it was--it was the Ancient Ones who shaped them.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the Three are of the Ancient Ones?\" I cried.  \"Surely they can\r\ntell--\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she said slowly.  \"No--there is something you must know--and\r\nsoon; and then the Silent Ones say you will understand. You,\r\nespecially, Goodwin, who worship wisdom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Larry, \"we have the _Akka_; and we have the four men of\r\nus, and among us three guns and about a hundred cartridges--an'--an'\r\nthe power of the Three--but what about the Shining One, Fireworks--\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know.\" Again the indecision that had been in her eyes when\r\nYolara had launched her defiance crept back. \"The Shining One is\r\nstrong--and he has his--slaves!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we'd better get busy good and quick!\" the O'Keefe's voice rang.\r\nBut Lakla, for some reason of her own, would pursue the matter no\r\nfurther. The trouble fled from her eyes--they danced.\r\n\r\n\"Larry darlin'?\" she murmured.  \"I like the touch of your lips--\"\r\n\r\n\"You do?\" he whispered, all thought flying of anything but the\r\nbeautiful, provocative face so close to his. \"Then, _acushla_, you're\r\ngoin' to get acquainted with 'em! Turn your head, Doc!\" he said.\r\n\r\nAnd I turned it.  There was quite a long silence, broken by an\r\ninterested, soft outburst of gentle boomings from the serving\r\nfrog-maids. I stole a glance behind me. Lakla's head lay on the\r\nIrishman's shoulder, the golden eyes misty sunpools of love and\r\nadoration; and the O'Keefe, a new look of power and strength upon his\r\nclear-cut features, was gazing down into them with that look which\r\nrises only from the heart touched for the first time with that true,\r\nall-powerful love, which is the pulse of the universe itself, the real\r\nmusic of the spheres of which Plato dreamed, the love that is stronger\r\nthan death itself, immortal as the high gods and the true soul of all\r\nthat mystery we call life.\r\n\r\nThen Lakla raised her hands, pressed down Larry's head, kissed him\r\nbetween the eyes, drew herself with a trembling little laugh from his\r\nembrace.\r\n\r\n\"The future Mrs. Larry O'Keefe, Goodwin,\" said Larry to me a little\r\nunsteadily.\r\n\r\nI took their hands--and Lakla kissed me!\r\n\r\nShe turned to the booming--smiling--frog-maids; gave them some\r\ncommand, for they filed away down the path. Suddenly I felt, well, a\r\nlittle superfluous.\r\n\r\n\"If you don't mind,\" I said, \"I think I'll go up the path there again\r\nand look about.\"\r\n\r\nBut they were so engrossed with each other that they did not even hear\r\nme--so I walked away, up to the embrasure where Rador had taken me.\r\nThe movement of the batrachians over the bridge had ceased. Dimly at\r\nthe far end I could see the cluster of the garrison. My thoughts flew\r\nback to Lakla and to Larry.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be the end?\r\n\r\nIf we won, if we were able to pass from this place, could she live in\r\nour world? A product of these caverns with their atmosphere and light\r\nthat seemed in some subtle way to be both food and drink--how would\r\nshe react to the unfamiliar foods and air and light of outer earth?\r\nFurther, here so far as I was able to discover, there were no\r\nmalignant bacilli--what immunity could Lakla have then to those\r\nmicroscopic evils without, which only long ages of sickness and death\r\nhave bought for us a modicum of protection? I began to be oppressed.\r\nSurely they had been long enough by themselves. I went down the path.\r\n\r\nI heard Larry.\r\n\r\n\"It's a green land, _mavourneen_.  And the sea rocks and dimples\r\naround it--blue as the heavens, green as the isle itself, and foam\r\nhorses toss their white manes, and the great clean winds blow over it,\r\nand the sun shines down on it like your eyes, _acushla_--\"\r\n\r\n\"And are you a king of Ireland, Larry darlin'?\" Thus Lakla--\r\n\r\nBut enough!\r\n\r\nAt last we turned to go--and around the corner of the path I caught\r\nanother glimpse of what I have called the lake of jewels. I pointed to\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"Those are lovely flowers, Lakla,\" I said.  \"I have never seen\r\nanything like them in the place from whence we come.\"\r\n\r\nShe followed my pointing finger--laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" she said, \"let me show you them.\"\r\n\r\nShe ran down an intersecting way, we following; came out of it upon a\r\nlittle ledge close to the brink, three feet or more I suppose about\r\nit. The Golden Girl's voice rang out in a high-pitched, tremulous,\r\nthrobbing call.\r\n\r\nThe lake of jewels stirred as though a breeze had passed over it;\r\nstirred, shook, and then began to move swiftly, a shimmering torrent\r\nof shining flowers down upon us! She called again, the movement became\r\nmore rapid; the gem blooms streamed closer--closer, wavering,\r\nshifting, winding--at our very feet. Above them hovered a little\r\nradiant mist. The Golden Girl leaned over; called softly, and up from\r\nthe sparkling mass shot a green vine whose heads were five flowers of\r\nflaming ruby--shot up, flew into her hand and coiled about the white\r\narm, its quintette of lambent blossoms--regarding us!\r\n\r\nIt was the thing Lakla had called the _Yekta_; that with which she had\r\nthreatened the priestess; the thing that carried the dreadful\r\ndeath--and the Golden Girl was handling it like a rose!\r\n\r\nLarry swore--I looked at the thing more closely.  It was a hydroid, a\r\ndevelopment of that strange animal-vegetable that, sometimes almost\r\nmicroscopic, waves in the sea depths like a cluster of flowers\r\nparalyzing its prey with the mysterious force that dwells in its\r\nblossom heads![2]\r\n\r\n\"Put it down, Lakla,\" the distress in O'Keefe's voice was deep.  Lakla\r\nlaughed mischievously, caught the real fear for her in his eyes;\r\nopened her hand, gave another faint call--and back it flew to its\r\nfellows.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it wouldn't hurt me, Larry!\" she expostulated. \"They know me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Put it down!\" he repeated hoarsely.\r\n\r\nShe sighed, gave another sweet, prolonged call.  The lake of\r\ngems--rubies and amethysts, mauves and scarlet-tinged blues--wavered\r\nand shook even as it had before--and swept swiftly back to that place\r\nwhence she had drawn them!\r\n\r\nThen, with Larry and Lakla walking ahead, white arm about his brown\r\nneck; the O'Keefe still expostulating, the handmaiden laughing\r\nmerrily, we passed through her bower to the domed castle.\r\n\r\nGlancing through a cleft I caught sight again of the far end of the\r\nbridge; noted among the clustered figures of its garrison of the\r\nfrog-men a movement, a flashing of green fire like marshlights on\r\nspear tips; wondered idly what it was, and then, other thoughts\r\ncrowding in, followed along, head bent, behind the pair who had found\r\nin what was Olaf's hell, their true paradise.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The _Akka_ are viviparous.  The female produces progeny at\r\nfive-year intervals, never more than two at a time. They are\r\nmonogamous, like certain of our own _Ranidae_. Pending my monograph\r\nupon what little I had time to learn of their interesting habits and\r\ncustoms, the curious will find instruction and entertainment in\r\nBrandes and Schvenichen's _Brutpfleige der Schwanzlosen Bat rachier_,\r\np. 395; and Lilian V. Sampson's _Unusual Modes of Breeding among\r\nAnura_, Amer. Nat. xxxiv., 1900.--W. T. G.\r\n\r\n[2] The _Yekta_ of the Crimson Sea, are as extraordinary developments\r\nof hydroid forms as the giant _Medusae_, of which, of course, they are\r\nnot too remote cousins. The closest resemblances to them in outer\r\nwater forms are among the _Gymnoblastic Hydroids_, notably _Clavetella\r\nprolifera_, a most interesting ambulatory form of six tentacles.\r\nAlmost every bather in Southern waters, Northern too, knows the pain\r\nthat contact with certain \"jelly fish\" produces. The _Yekta's_\r\ndevelopment was prodigious and, to us, monstrous. It secretes in its\r\nfive heads an almost incredibly swiftly acting poison which I suspect,\r\nfor I had no chance to verify the theory, destroys the entire nervous\r\nsystem to the accompaniment of truly infernal agony; carrying at the\r\nsame time the illusion that the torment stretches through infinities\r\nof time. Both ether and nitrous oxide gas produce in the majority this\r\nsensation of time extension, without of course the pain symptom. What\r\nLakla called the _Yekta_ kiss is I imagine about as close to the\r\northodox idea of Hell as can be conceived. The secret of her control\r\nover them I had no opportunity of learning in the rush of events that\r\nfollowed. Knowledge of the appalling effects of their touch came, she\r\ntold me, from those few \"who had been kissed so lightly\" that they\r\nrecovered. Certainly nothing, not even the Shining One, was dreaded by\r\nthe Murians as these were--W. T. G.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nThe Coming of Yolara\r\n\r\n\"Never was there such a girl!\" Thus Larry, dreamily, leaning head in\r\nhand on one of the wide divans of the chamber where Lakla had left us,\r\npleading service to the Silent Ones.\r\n\r\n\"An', by the faith and the honour of the O'Keefes, an' by my dead\r\nmother's soul may God do with me as I do by her!\" he whispered\r\nfervently.\r\n\r\nHe relapsed into open-eyed dreaming.\r\n\r\nI walked about the room, examining it--the first opportunity I had\r\ngained to inspect carefully any of the rooms in the abode of the\r\nThree. It was octagonal, carpeted with the thick rugs that seemed\r\nalmost as though woven of soft mineral wool, faintly shimmering,\r\npalest blue. I paced its diagonal; it was fifty yards; the ceiling was\r\narched, and either of pale rose metal or metallic covering; it\r\ncollected the light from the high, slitted windows, and shed it,\r\ndiffused, through the room.\r\n\r\nAround the octagon ran a low gallery not two feet from the floor,\r\nbalustraded with slender pillars, close set; broken at opposite\r\ncurtained entrances over which hung thick, dull-gold curtainings\r\ngiving the same suggestion of metallic or mineral substance as the\r\nrugs. Set within each of the eight sides, above the balcony, were\r\ncolossal slabs of lapis lazuli, inset with graceful but unplaceable\r\ndesigns in scarlet and sapphire blue.\r\n\r\nThere was the great divan on which mused Larry; two smaller ones, half\r\na dozen low seats and chairs carved apparently of ivory and of dull\r\nsoft gold.\r\n\r\nMost curious were tripods, strong, pikelike legs of golden metal four\r\nfeet high, holding small circles of the lapis with intaglios of one\r\ncurious symbol somewhat resembling the ideographs of the Chinese.\r\n\r\nThere was no dust--nowhere in these caverned spaces had I found this\r\nconstant companion of ours in the world overhead. My eyes caught a\r\nsparkle from a corner. Pursuing it I found upon one of the low seats a\r\nflat, clear crystal oval, remarkably like a lens. I took it and\r\nstepped up on the balcony. Standing on tiptoe I found I commanded from\r\nthe bottom of a window slit a view of the bridge approach. Scanning it\r\nI could see no trace of the garrison there, nor of the green spear\r\nflashes. I placed the crystal to my eyes--and with a disconcerting\r\nabruptness the cavern mouth leaped before me, apparently not a hundred\r\nfeet away; decidedly the crystal was a very excellent lens--but where\r\nwere the guards?\r\n\r\nI peered closely.  Nothing!  But now against the aperture I saw a\r\nscore or more of tiny, dancing sparks. An optical illusion, I thought,\r\nand turned the crystal in another direction. There were no sparklings\r\nthere. I turned it back again--and there they were. And what were\r\nthey like? Realization came to me--they were like the little, dancing,\r\nradiant atoms that had played for a time about the emptiness where had\r\nstood Sorgar of the Lower Waters before he had been shaken into the\r\nnothingness! And that green light I had noticed--the _Keth_!\r\n\r\nA cry on my lips, I turned to Larry--and the cry died as the heavy\r\ncurtainings at the entrance on my right undulated, parted as though a\r\nbody had slipped through, shook and parted again and again--with the\r\ndreadful passing of unseen things!\r\n\r\n\"Larry!\" I cried.  \"Here!  Quick!\"\r\n\r\nHe leaped to his feet, gazed about wildly--and disappeared!\r\nYes--vanished from my sight like the snuffed flame of a candle or as\r\nthough something moving with the speed of light itself had snatched\r\nhim away!\r\n\r\nThen from the divan came the sounds of struggle, the hissing of\r\nstraining breaths, the noise of Larry cursing. I leaped over the\r\nbalustrade, drawing my own pistol--was caught in a pair of mighty\r\narms, my elbows crushed to my sides, drawn down until my face pressed\r\nclose to a broad, hairy breast--and through that obstacle--formless,\r\nshadowless, transparent as air itself--I could still see the battle on\r\nthe divan!\r\n\r\nNow there were two sharp reports; the struggle abruptly ceased.  From\r\na point not a foot over the great couch, as though oozing from the air\r\nitself, blood began to drop, faster and ever faster, pouring out of\r\nnothingness.\r\n\r\nAnd out of that same air, now a dozen feet away, leaped the face of\r\nLarry--bodyless, poised six feet above the floor, blazing with\r\nrage--floating weirdly, uncannily to a hideous degree, in vacancy.\r\n\r\nHis hands flashed out--armless; they wavered, appearing,\r\ndisappearing--swiftly tearing something from him. Then there, feet\r\nhidden, stiff on legs that vanished at the ankles, striking out into\r\nvision with all the dizzy abruptness with which he had been stricken\r\nfrom sight was the O'Keefe, a smoking pistol in hand.\r\n\r\nAnd ever that red stream trickled out of vacancy and spread over the\r\ncouch, dripping to the floor.\r\n\r\nI made a mighty movement to escape; was held more firmly--and then\r\nclose to the face of Larry, flashing out with that terrifying\r\ninstantaneousness even as had his, was the head of Yolara, as\r\ndevilishly mocking as I had ever seen it, the cruelty shining through\r\nit like delicate white flames from hell--and beautiful!\r\n\r\n\"Stir not!  Strike not--until I command!\" She flung the words beyond\r\nher, addressed to the invisible ones who had accompanied her; whose\r\npresences I sensed filling the chamber. The floating, beautiful head,\r\ncrowned high with corn-silk hair, darted toward the Irishman. He took\r\na swift step backward. The eyes of the priestess deepened toward\r\npurple; sparkled with malice.\r\n\r\n\"So,\" she said.  \"So, _Larree_--you thought you could go from me so\r\neasily!\" She laughed softly. \"In my hidden hand I hold the _Keth_\r\ncone,\" she murmured. \"Before you can raise the death tube I can smite\r\nyou--and will. And consider, _Larree_, if the handmaiden, the _choya_\r\ncomes, I can vanish--so\"--the mocking head disappeared, burst forth\r\nagain--\"and slay her with the _Keth_--or bid my people seize her and\r\nbear her to the Shining One!\"\r\n\r\nTiny beads of sweat stood out on O'Keefe's forehead, and I knew he was\r\nthinking not of himself, but of Lakla.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want with me, Yolara?\" he asked hoarsely.\r\n\r\n\"Nay,\" came the mocking voice.  \"Not Yolara to you, _Larree_--call me\r\nby those sweet names you taught me--Honey of the Wild Bee-e-s, Net of\r\nHearts--\" Again her laughter tinkled.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want with me?\" his voice was strained, the lips rigid.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you are afraid, _Larree_.\" There was diabolic jubilation in the\r\nwords. \"What should I want but that you return with me? Why else did I\r\ncreep through the lair of the dragon worm and pass the path of perils\r\nbut to ask you that? And the _choya_ guards you not well.\" Again she\r\nlaughed. \"We came to the cavern's end and, there were her _Akka_. And\r\nthe _Akka_ can see us--as shadows. But it was my desire to surprise\r\nyou with my coming, Larree,\" the voice was silken. \"And I feared that\r\nthey would hasten to be first to bring you that message to delight in\r\nyour joy. And so, _Larree_, I loosed the _Keth_ upon them--and gave\r\nthem peace and rest within the nothingness. And the portal below was\r\nopen--almost in welcome!\"\r\n\r\nOnce more the malignant, silver pealing of her laughter.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want with me?\" There was wrath in his eyes, and plainly\r\nhe strove for control.\r\n\r\n\"Want!\" the silver voice hissed, grew calm.  \"Do not Siya and Siyana\r\ngrieve that the rite I pledged them is but half done--and do they not\r\ndesire it finished? And am I not beautiful? More beautiful than your\r\n_choya_?\"\r\n\r\nThe fiendishness died from the eyes; they grew blue, wondrous; the\r\nveil of invisibility slipped down from the neck, the shoulders, half\r\nrevealing the gleaming breasts. And weird, weird beyond all telling\r\nwas that exquisite head and bust floating there in air--and beautiful,\r\nsinisterly beautiful beyond all telling, too. So even might Lilith,\r\nthe serpent woman, have shown herself tempting Adam!\r\n\r\n\"And perhaps,\" she said, \"perhaps I want you because I hate you;\r\nperhaps because I love you--or perhaps for Lugur or perhaps for the\r\nShining One.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if I go with you?\" He said it quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Then shall I spare the handmaiden--and--who knows?--take back my\r\narmies that even now gather at the portal and let the Silent Ones rot\r\nin peace in their abode--from which they had no power to keep me,\" she\r\nadded venomously.\r\n\r\n\"You will swear that, Yolara; swear to go without harming the\r\nhandmaiden?\" he asked eagerly. The little devils danced in her eyes. I\r\nwrenched my face from the smothering contact.\r\n\r\n\"Don't trust her, Larry!\" I cried--and again the grip choked me.\r\n\r\n\"Is that devil in front of you or behind you, old man?\" he asked\r\nquietly, eyes never leaving the priestess. \"If he's in front I'll take\r\na chance and wing him--and then you scoot and warn Lakla.\"\r\n\r\nBut I could not answer; nor, remembering Yolara's threat, would I, had\r\nI been able.\r\n\r\n\"Decide quickly!\" There was cold threat in her voice.\r\n\r\nThe curtains toward which O'Keefe had slowly, step by step, drawn\r\nclose, opened. They framed the handmaiden! The face of Yolara changed\r\nto that gorgon mask that had transformed it once before at sight of\r\nthe Golden Girl. In her blind rage she forgot to cast the occulting\r\nveil. Her hand darted like a snake out of the folds; poising itself\r\nwith the little silver cone aimed at Lakla.\r\n\r\nBut before it was wholly poised, before the priestess could loose its\r\nforce, the handmaiden was upon her. Swift as the lithe white wolf\r\nhound she leaped, and one slender hand gripped Yolara's throat, the\r\nother the wrist that lifted the quivering death; white limbs wrapped\r\nabout the hidden ones, I saw the golden head bend, the hand that held\r\nthe _Keth_ swept up with a vicious jerk; saw Lakla's teeth sink into\r\nthe wrist--the blood spurt forth and heard the priestess shriek. The\r\ncone fell, bounded toward me; with all my strength I wrenched free the\r\nhand that held my pistol, thrust it against the pressing breast and\r\nfired.\r\n\r\nThe clasp upon me relaxed; a red rain stained me; at my feet a little\r\npillar of blood jetted; a hand thrust itself from nothingness,\r\nclawed--and was still.\r\n\r\nNow Yolara was down, Lakla meshed in her writhings and fighting like\r\nsome wild mother whose babes are serpent menaced. Over the two of\r\nthem, astride, stood the O'Keefe, a pike from one of the high tripods\r\nin his hand--thrusting, parrying, beating on every side as with a\r\nbroadsword against poniard-clutching hands that thrust themselves out\r\nof vacancy striving to strike him; stepping here and there, always\r\ncovering, protecting Lakla with his own body even as a caveman of old\r\nwho does battle with his mate for their lives.\r\n\r\nThe sword-club struck--and on the floor lay the half body of a dwarf,\r\nwrithing with vanishments and reappearings of legs and arms. Beside\r\nhim was the shattered tripod from which Larry had wrenched his weapon.\r\nI flung myself upon it, dashed it down to break loose one of the\r\nremaining supports, struck in midfall one of the unseen even as his\r\ndagger darted toward me! The seat splintered, leaving in my clutch a\r\ngolden bar. I jumped to Larry's side, guarding his back, whirling it\r\nlike a staff; felt it crunch once--twice--through unseen bone and\r\nmuscle.\r\n\r\nAt the door was a booming.  Into the chamber rushed a dozen of the\r\nfrog-men. While some guarded the entrances, others leaped straight to\r\nus, and forming a circle about us began to strike with talons and\r\nspurs at unseen things that screamed and sought to escape. Now here\r\nand there about the blue rugs great stains of blood appeared; heads of\r\ndwarfs, torn arms and gashed bodies, half occulted, half revealed. And\r\nat last the priestess lay silent, vanquished, white body gleaming with\r\nthat uncanny--fragmentariness--from her torn robes. Then O'Keefe\r\nreached down, drew Lakla from her. Shakily, Yolara rose to her feet.\r\nThe handmaiden, face still blazing with wrath, stepped before her;\r\nwith difficulty she steadied her voice.\r\n\r\n\"Yolara,\" she said, \"you have defied the Silent Ones, you have\r\ndesecrated their abode, you came to slay these men who are the guests\r\nof the Silent Ones and me, who am their handmaiden--why did you do\r\nthese things?\"\r\n\r\n\"I came for him!\" gasped the priestess; she pointed to O'Keefe.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" asked Lakla.\r\n\r\n\"Because he is pledged to me,\" replied Yolara, all the devils that\r\nwere hers in her face. \"Because he wooed me! Because he is mine!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a lie!\" The handmaiden's voice shook with rage. \"It is a lie!\r\nBut here and now he shall choose, Yolara. And if you he choose, you\r\nand he shall go forth from here unmolested--for Yolara, it is his\r\nhappiness that I most desire, and if you are that happiness--you shall\r\ngo together. And now, Larry, choose!\"\r\n\r\nSwiftly she stepped beside the priestess; swiftly wrenched the last\r\nshreds of the hiding robes from her.\r\n\r\nThere they stood--Yolara with but the filmiest net of gauze about her\r\nwonderful body; gleaming flesh shining through it; serpent woman---and\r\nwonderful, too, beyond the dreams even of Phidias--and hell-fire\r\nglowing from the purple eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd Lakla, like a girl of the Vikings, like one of those warrior maids\r\nwho stood and fought for dun and babes at the side of those old heroes\r\nof Larry's own green isle; translucent ivory lambent through the rents\r\nof her torn draperies, and in the wide, golden eyes flaming wrath,\r\nindeed--not the diabolic flames of the priestess but the righteous\r\nwrath of some soul that looking out of paradise sees vile wrong in the\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\n\"Lakla,\" the O'Keefe's voice was subdued, hurt, \"there _is_ no choice.\r\nI love you and only you--and have from the moment I saw you. It's not\r\neasy--this. God, Goodwin, I feel like an utter cad,\" he flashed at me.\r\n\"There is no choice, Lakla,\" he ended, eyes steady upon hers.\r\n\r\nThe priestess's face grew deadlier still.\r\n\r\n\"What will you do with me?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Keep you,\" I said, \"as hostage.\"\r\n\r\nO'Keefe was silent; the Golden Girl shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"Well would I like to,\" her face grew dreaming; \"but the Silent Ones\r\nsay--_no_; they bid me let you go, Yolara--\"\r\n\r\n\"The Silent Ones,\" the priestess laughed. \"_You_, Lakla! You fear,\r\nperhaps, to let me tarry here too close!\"\r\n\r\nStorm gathered again in the handmaiden's eyes; she forced it back.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she answered, \"the Silent Ones so command--and for their own\r\npurposes. Yet do I think, Yolara, that you will have little time to\r\nfeed your wickedness--tell that to Lugur--and to your Shining One!\"\r\nshe added slowly.\r\n\r\nMockery and disbelief rode high in the priestess's pose. \"Am I to\r\nreturn alone--like this?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, Yolara, nay; you shall be accompanied,\" said Lakla; \"and by\r\nthose who will guard--and _watch_--you well. They are here even now.\"\r\n\r\nThe hangings parted, and into the chamber came Olaf and Rador.\r\n\r\nThe priestess met the fierce hatred and contempt in the eyes of the\r\nNorseman--and for the first time lost her bravado.\r\n\r\n\"Let not _him_ go with me,\" she gasped--her eyes searched the floor\r\nfrantically.\r\n\r\n\"He goes with you,\" said Lakla, and threw about Yolara a swathing that\r\ncovered the exquisite, alluring body. \"And you shall pass through the\r\nPortal, not skulk along the path of the worm!\"\r\n\r\nShe bent to Rador, whispered to him; he nodded; she had told him, I\r\nsupposed, the secret of its opening.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" he said, and with the ice-eyed giant behind her, Yolara, head\r\nbent, passed out of those hangings through which, but a little before,\r\nunseen, triumph in her grasp, she had slipped.\r\n\r\nThen Lakla came to the unhappy O'Keefe, rested her hands on his\r\nshoulders, looked deep into his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"_Did_ you woo her, even as she said?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nThe Irishman flushed miserably.\r\n\r\n\"I did not,\" he said.  \"I was pleasant to her, of course, because I\r\nthought it would bring me quicker to you, darlin'.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him doubtfully; then--\r\n\r\n\"I think you must have been _very_--pleasant!\" was all she said--and\r\nleaning, kissed him forgivingly straight on the lips. An extremely\r\ndirect maiden was Lakla, with a truly sovereign contempt for anything\r\nshe might consider non-essentials; and at this moment I decided she\r\nwas wiser even than I had thought her.\r\n\r\nHe stumbled, feet vanishing; reached down and picked up something that\r\nin the grasping turned his hand to air.\r\n\r\n\"One of the invisible cloaks,\" he said to me.  \"There must be quite a\r\nlot of them about--I guess Yolara brought her full staff of murderers.\r\nThey're a bit shopworn, probably--but we're considerably better off\r\nwith 'em in our hands than in hers. And they may come in handy--who\r\nknows?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a choking rattle at my feet; half the head of a dwarf raised\r\nout of vacancy; beat twice upon the floor in death throes; fell back.\r\nLakla shivered; gave a command. The frog-men moved about; peering here\r\nand there; lifting unseen folds revealing in stark rigidity torn form\r\nafter form of the priestess's men.\r\n\r\nLakla had been right--her _Akka_ were thorough fighters!\r\n\r\nShe called, and to her came the frog-woman who was her attendant.  To\r\nher the handmaiden spoke, pointing to the batrachians who stood, paws\r\nand forearms melted beneath the robes they had gathered. She took them\r\nand passed out--more grotesque than ever, shattering into streaks of\r\nvacancies, reappearing with flickers of shining scale and yellow gems\r\nas the tattered pennants of invisibility fluttered about her.\r\n\r\nThe frog-men reached down, swung each a dead dwarf in his arms, and\r\nfiled, booming triumphantly away.\r\n\r\nAnd then I remembered the cone of the _Keth_ which had slipped from\r\nYolara's hand; knew it had been that for which her wild eyes searched.\r\nBut look as closely as we might, search in every nook and corner as we\r\ndid, we could not find it. Had the dying hand of one of her men\r\nclutched it and had it been borne away with them? With the thought\r\nLarry and I raced after the scaled warriors, searched every body they\r\ncarried. It was not there. Perhaps the priestess had found it,\r\nretrieved it swiftly without our seeing.\r\n\r\nWhatever was true--the cone was gone.  And what a weapon that one\r\nlittle holder of the shaking death would have been for us!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nIn the Lair of the Dweller\r\n\r\nIt is with marked hesitation that I begin this chapter, because in it\r\nI must deal with an experience so contrary to every known law of\r\nphysics as to seem impossible. Until this time, barring, of course,\r\nthe mystery of the Dweller, I had encountered nothing that was not\r\nsusceptible of naturalistic explanation; nothing, in a word, outside\r\nthe domain of science itself; nothing that I would have felt hesitancy\r\nin reciting to my colleagues of the International Association of\r\nScience. Amazing, unfamiliar--_advanced_--as many of the phenomena were,\r\nstill they lay well within the limits of what we have mapped as the\r\npossible; in regions, it is true, still virgin to the mind of man, but\r\ntoward which that mind is steadily advancing.\r\n\r\nBut this--well, I confess that I have a theory that is naturalistic;\r\nbut so abstruse, so difficult to make clear within the short confines\r\nof the space I have to give it, so dependent upon conceptions that\r\neven the highest-trained scientific brains find difficult to grasp,\r\nthat I despair.\r\n\r\nI can only say that the thing occurred; that it took place in\r\nprecisely the manner I am about to narrate, and that I experienced it.\r\n\r\nYet, in justice to myself, I must open up some paths of preliminary\r\napproach toward the heart of the perplexity. And the first path is the\r\nrealization that our world _whatever_ it is, is certainly _not_ the\r\nworld as we see it! Regarding this I shall refer to a discourse upon\r\n\"Gravitation and the Principle of Relativity,\" by the distinguished\r\nEnglish physicist, Dr. A. S. Eddington, which I had the pleasure of\r\nhearing him deliver before the Royal Institution.[1]\r\n\r\nI realize, of course, that it is not true logic to argue--\"The world\r\nis not as we think it is--therefore everything we think impossible is\r\npossible in it.\" Even if it _be_ different, it is governed by _law_. The\r\ntruly impossible is that which is outside law, and as nothing _can_ be\r\noutside law, the impossible _cannot_ exist.\r\n\r\nThe crux of the matter then becomes our determination whether what we\r\nthink is impossible may or may not be possible under laws still beyond\r\nour knowledge.\r\n\r\nI hope that you will pardon me for this somewhat academic digression,\r\nbut I felt it was necessary, and it has, at least, put me more at\r\nease. And now to resume.\r\n\r\nWe had watched, Larry and I, the frog-men throw the bodies of Yolara's\r\nassassins into the crimson waters. As vultures swoop down upon the\r\ndying, there came sailing swiftly to where the dead men floated,\r\ndozens of the luminous globes. Their slender, varicoloured tentacles\r\nwhipped out; the giant iridescent bubbles _climbed_ over the cadavers.\r\nAnd as they touched them there was the swift dissolution, the melting\r\naway into putrescence of flesh and bone that I had witnessed when the\r\ndart touched fruit that time I had saved Rador--and upon this the\r\nMedusae gorged; pulsing lambently; their wondrous colours shifting,\r\nchanging, glowing stronger; elfin moons now indeed, but satellites\r\nwhose glimmering beauty was fed by death; alembics of enchantment\r\nwhose glorious hues were sucked from horror.\r\n\r\nSick, I turned away--O'Keefe as pale as I; passed back into the\r\ncorridor that had opened on the ledge from which we had watched; met\r\nLakla hurrying toward us. Before she could speak there throbbed\r\nfaintly about us a vast sighing. It grew into a murmur, a whispering,\r\nshook us--then passing like a presence, died away in far distance.\r\n\r\n\"The Portal has opened,\" said the handmaiden.  A fainter sighing, like\r\nan echo of the other, mourned about us. \"Yolara is gone,\" she said,\r\n\"the Portal is closed. Now must we hasten--for the Three have\r\ncommanded that you, Goodwin, and Larry and I tread that strange road\r\nof which I have spoken, and which Olaf may not take lest his heart\r\nbreak--and we must return ere he and Rador cross the bridge.\"\r\n\r\nHer hand sought Larry's.\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" said Lakla, and we walked on; down and down through hall after\r\nhall, flight upon flight of stairways. Deep, deep indeed, we must be\r\nbeneath the domed castle--Lakla paused before a curved, smooth breast\r\nof the crimson stone rounding gently into the passage. She pressed its\r\nside; it revolved; we entered; it closed behind us.\r\n\r\nThe room, the--hollow--in which we stood was faceted like a diamond;\r\nand like a cut brilliant its sides glistened--though dully. Its shape\r\nwas a deep oval, and our path dropped down to a circular polished\r\nbase, roughly two yards in diameter. Glancing behind me I saw that in\r\nthe closing of the entrance there had been left no trace of it save\r\nthe steps that led from where that entrance had been--and as I looked\r\nthese steps _turned_, leaving us isolated upon the circle, only the\r\nfaceted walls about us--and in each of the gleaming faces the three of\r\nus reflected--dimly. It was as though we were within a diamond egg\r\nwhose graven angles had been turned _inward_.\r\n\r\nBut the oval was not perfect; at my right a screen cut it--a screen\r\nthat gleamed with fugitive, fleeting luminescences--stretching from\r\nthe side of our standing place up to the tip of the chamber; slightly\r\nconvex and crisscrossed by millions of fine lines like those upon a\r\nspectroscopic plate, but with this difference--that within each line I\r\nsensed the presence of multitudes of finer lines, dwindling into\r\ninfinitude, ultramicroscopic, traced by some instrument compared to\r\nwhose delicacy our finest tool would be as a crowbar to the needle of\r\na micrometer.\r\n\r\nA foot or two from it stood something like the standee of a compass,\r\nbearing, like it a cradled dial under whose crystal ran concentric\r\nrings of prisoned, lambent vapours, faintly blue. From the edge of the\r\ndial jutted a little shelf of crystal, a keyboard, in which were cut\r\neight small cups.\r\n\r\nWithin these cups the handmaiden placed her tapering fingers.  She\r\ngazed down upon the disk; pressed a digit--and the screen behind us\r\nslipped noiselessly into another angle.\r\n\r\n\"Put your arm around my waist, Larry, darlin', and stand close,\" she\r\nmurmured. \"You, Goodwin, place your arm over my shoulder.\"\r\n\r\nWondering, I did as she bade; she pressed other fingers upon the\r\nshelf's indentations--three of the rings of vapour spun into intense\r\nlight, raced around each other; from the screen behind us grew a\r\nradiance that held within itself all spectrums--not only those seen,\r\nbut those _unseen_ by man's eyes. It waxed brilliant and ever more\r\nbrilliant, all suffusing, passing through me as day streams through a\r\nwindow pane!\r\n\r\nThe enclosing facets burst into a blaze of coruscations, and in each\r\nsparkling panel I saw our images, shaken and torn like pennants in a\r\nwhirlwind. I turned to look--was stopped by the handmaiden's swift\r\ncommand: \"Turn not--on your life!\"\r\n\r\nThe radiance behind me grew; was a rushing tempest of light in which I\r\nwas but the shadow of a shadow. I heard, but not with my ears--nay with\r\n_mind_ itself--a vast roaring; an _ordered_ tumult of sound that came\r\nhurling from the outposts of space; approaching--rushing--hurricane\r\nout of the heart of the cosmos--closer, closer. It wrapped itself\r\nabout us with unearthly mighty arms.\r\n\r\nAnd brilliant, ever more brilliant, streamed the radiance through us.\r\n\r\nThe faceted walls dimmed; in front of me they melted, diaphanously,\r\nlike a gelatinous wall in a blast of flame; through their vanishing,\r\nunder the torrent of driving light, the unthinkable, impalpable\r\ntornado, I began to move, slowly--then ever more swiftly!\r\n\r\nStill the roaring grew; the radiance streamed--ever faster we went.\r\nCutting down through the length, the _extension_ of me, dropped a wall\r\nof rock, foreshortened, clenched close; I caught a glimpse of the\r\nelfin gardens; they whirled, contracted, into a thin--slice--of colour\r\nthat was a part of me; another wall of rock shrinking into a thin\r\nwedge through which I flew, and that at once took its place within me\r\nlike a card slipped beside those others!\r\n\r\nFlashing around me, and from Lakla and O'Keefe, were nimbuses of\r\nflickering scarlet flames. And always the steady hurling\r\nforward--appallingly mechanical.\r\n\r\nAnother barrier of rock--a gleam of white waters incorporating\r\nthemselves into my--_drawing out_--even as were the flowered moss lands,\r\nthe slicing, rocky walls--still another rampart of cliff, dwindling\r\ninstantly into the vertical plane of those others. Our flight checked;\r\nwe seemed to hover within, then to sway onward--slowly, cautiously.\r\n\r\nA mist danced ahead of me--a mist that grew steadily thinner.  We\r\nstopped, wavered--the mist cleared.\r\n\r\nI looked out into translucent, green distances; shot with swift\r\nprismatic gleamings; waves and pulsings of luminosity like midday sun\r\nglow through green, tropic waters: dancing, scintillating veils of\r\nsparkling atoms that flew, hither and yon, through depths of nebulous\r\nsplendour!\r\n\r\nAnd Lakla and Larry and I were, I saw, like shadow shapes upon a\r\nsmooth breast of stone twenty feet or more above the surface of this\r\nplace--a surface spangled with tiny white blossoms gleaming wanly\r\nthrough creeping veils of phosphorescence like smoke of moon fire. We\r\nwere shadows--and yet we had substance; we were incorporated with, a\r\npart of, the rock--and yet we were living flesh and blood; we\r\nstretched--nor will I qualify this--we _stretched_ through mile upon\r\nmile of space that weirdly enough gave at one and the same time an\r\nabsolute certainty of immense horizontal lengths and a vertical\r\nconcentration that contained nothing of length, nothing of space\r\nwhatever; we stood _there_ upon the face of the stone--and still we\r\nwere _here_ within the faceted oval before the screen of radiance!\r\n\r\n\"Steady!\" It was Lakla's voice--and not beside me _there_, but at my ear\r\nclose before the screen. \"Steady, Goodwin! And--see!\"\r\n\r\nThe sparkling haze cleared.  Enormous reaches stretched before me.\r\nShimmering up through them, and as though growing in some medium\r\nthicker than air, was mass upon mass of verdure--fruiting trees and\r\ntrees laden with pale blossoms, arbours and bowers of pallid blooms,\r\nlike that sea fruit of oblivion--grapes of Lethe--that cling to the\r\ntide-swept walls of the caverns of the Hebrides.\r\n\r\nThrough them, beyond them, around and about them, drifted and eddied a\r\nhorde--great as that with which Tamerlane swept down upon Rome, vast\r\nas the myriads which Genghis Khan rolled upon the califs--men and\r\nwomen and children--clothed in tatters, half nude and wholly naked;\r\nslant-eyed Chinese, sloe-eyed Malays, islanders black and brown and\r\nyellow, fierce-faced warriors of the Solomons with grizzled locks\r\nfantastically bedizened; Papuans, feline Javans, Dyaks of hill and\r\nshore; hook-nosed Phoenicians, Romans, straight-browed Greeks, and\r\nVikings centuries _beyond_ their lives: scores of the black-haired\r\nMurians; white faces of our own Westerners--men and women and\r\nchildren--drifting, eddying--each stamped with that mingled horror and\r\nrapture, eyes filled with ecstasy and terror entwined, marked by God\r\nand devil in embrace--the seal of the Shining One--the dead-alive; the\r\nlost ones!\r\n\r\nThe loot of the Dweller!\r\n\r\nSoul-sick, I gazed.  They lifted to us visages of dread; they swept\r\ndown toward us, glaring upward--a bank against which other and still\r\nother waves of faces rolled, were checked, paused; until as far as I\r\ncould see, like billows piled upon an ever-growing barrier, they\r\nstretched beneath us--staring--staring!\r\n\r\nNow there was a movement--far, far away; a concentrating of the\r\nlambency; the dead-alive swayed, oscillated, separated--forming a long\r\nlane against whose outskirts they crowded with avid, hungry\r\ninsistence.\r\n\r\nFirst only a luminous cloud, then a whirling pillar of splendours\r\nthrough the lane came--the Shining One. As it passed, the dead-alive\r\nswirled in its wake like leaves behind a whirlwind, eddying, twisting;\r\nand as the Dweller raced by them, brushing them with its spirallings\r\nand tentacles, they shone forth with unearthly, awesome\r\ngleamings--like vessels of alabaster in which wicks flare suddenly.\r\nAnd when it had passed they closed behind it, staring up at us once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThe Dweller paused beneath us.\r\n\r\nOut of the drifting ruck swam the body of Throckmartin! Throckmartin,\r\nmy friend, to find whom I had gone to the pallid moon door; my friend\r\nwhose call I had so laggardly followed. On his face was the Dweller's\r\ndreadful stamp; the lips were bloodless; the eyes were wide, lucent,\r\nsomething like pale, phosphorescence gleaming within them--and\r\nsoulless.\r\n\r\nHe stared straight up at me, unwinking, unrecognizing. Pressing\r\nagainst his side was a woman, young and gentle, and lovely--lovely\r\neven through the mask that lay upon her face. And her wide eyes, like\r\nThrockmartin's, glowed with the lurking, unholy fires. She pressed\r\nagainst him closely; though the hordes kept up the faint churning,\r\nthese two kept ever together, as though bound by unseen fetters.\r\n\r\nAnd I knew the girl for Edith, his wife, who in vain effort to save\r\nhim had cast herself into the Dweller's embrace!\r\n\r\n\"Throckmartin!\" I cried.  \"Throckmartin!  I'm here!\"\r\n\r\nDid he hear?  I know now, of course, he could not.\r\n\r\nBut then I waited--hope striving to break through the nightmare hands\r\nthat gripped my heart.\r\n\r\nTheir wide eyes never left me.  There was another movement about them,\r\nothers pushed past them; they drifted back, swaying, eddying--and\r\nstill staring were lost in the awful throng.\r\n\r\nVainly I strained my gaze to find them again, to force some sign of\r\nrecognition, some awakening of the clean life we know. But they were\r\ngone. Try as I would I could not see them--nor Stanton and the\r\nnorthern woman named Thora who had been the first of that tragic party\r\nto be taken by the Dweller.\r\n\r\n\"Throckmartin!\" I cried again, despairingly.  My tears blinded me.\r\n\r\nI felt Lakla's light touch.\r\n\r\n\"Steady,\" she commanded, pitifully.  \"Steady, Goodwin. You cannot help\r\nthem--now! Steady and--watch!\"\r\n\r\nBelow us the Shining One had paused--spiralling, swirling, vibrant\r\nwith all its transcendent, devilish beauty; had paused and was\r\ncontemplating us. Now I could see clearly that nucleus, that core shot\r\nthrough with flashing veins of radiance, that ever-shifting shape of\r\nglory through the shroudings of shimmering, misty plumes, throbbing\r\nlacy opalescences, vaporous spirallings of prismatic phantom fires.\r\nSteady over it hung the seven little moons of amethyst, of saffron, of\r\nemerald and azure and silver, of rose of life and moon white. They\r\npoised themselves like a diadem--calm, serene, immobile--and down\r\nfrom them into the Dweller, piercing plumes and swirls and spirals,\r\nran countless tiny strands, radiations, finer than the finest spun\r\nthread of spider's web, gleaming filaments through which seemed to\r\nrun--_power_--from the seven globes; like--yes, that was it--miniatures\r\nof the seven torrents of moon flame that poured through the\r\nseptichromatic, high crystals in the Moon Pool's chamber roof.\r\n\r\nSwam out of the coruscating haze the--face!\r\n\r\nBoth of man and of woman it was--like some ancient, androgynous deity\r\nof Etruscan fanes long dust, and yet neither woman nor man; human and\r\nunhuman, seraphic and sinister, benign and malefic--and still no more\r\nof these four than is flame, which is beautiful whether it warms or\r\ndevours, or wind whether it feathers the trees or shatters them, or\r\nthe wave which is wondrous whether it caresses or kills.\r\n\r\nSubtly, undefinably it was of our world and of one not ours.  Its\r\nlineaments flowed from another sphere, took fleeting familiar\r\nform--and as swiftly withdrew whence they had come; something\r\namorphous, unearthly--as of unknown unheeding, unseen gods rushing\r\nthrough the depths of star-hung space; and still of our own earth,\r\nwith the very soul of earth peering out from it, caught within it--and\r\nin some--unholy--way debased.\r\n\r\nIt had eyes--eyes that were now only shadows darkening within its\r\nluminosity like veils falling, and falling, _opening_ windows into the\r\nunknowable; deepening into softly glowing blue pools, blue as the Moon\r\nPool itself; then flashing out, and this only when the--face--bore its\r\nmost human resemblance, into twin stars large almost as the crown of\r\nlittle moons; and with that same baffling suggestion of peep-holes\r\ninto a world untrodden, alien, perilous to man!\r\n\r\n\"Steady!\" came Lakla's voice, her body leaned against mine.\r\n\r\nI gripped myself, my brain steadied, I looked again.  And I saw that\r\nof body, at least body as we know it, the Shining One had\r\nnone--nothing but the throbbing, pulsing core streaked with lightning\r\nveins of rainbows; and around this, never still, sheathing it, the\r\nswirling, glorious veilings of its hell and heaven born radiance.\r\n\r\nSo the Dweller stood--and gazed.\r\n\r\nThen up toward us swept a reaching, questing spiral!\r\n\r\nUnder my hand Lakla's shoulder quivered; dead-alive and their master\r\nvanished--I danced, flickered, _within_ the rock; felt a swift sense of\r\nshrinking, of withdrawal; slice upon slice the carded walls of stone,\r\nof silvery waters, of elfin gardens slipped from me as cards are\r\nwithdrawn from a pack, one by one--slipped, wheeled, flattened, and\r\nlengthened out as I passed through them and they passed from me.\r\n\r\nGasping, shaken, weak, I stood within the faceted oval chamber; arm\r\nstill about the handmaiden's white shoulder; Larry's hand still\r\nclutching her girdle.\r\n\r\nThe roaring, impalpable gale from the cosmos was retreating to the\r\noutposts of space--was still; the intense, streaming, flooding\r\nradiance lessened--died.\r\n\r\n\"Now have you beheld,\" said Lakla, \"and well you trod the road.  And\r\nnow shall you hear, even as the Silent Ones have commanded, what the\r\nShining One is--and how it came to be.\"\r\n\r\nThe steps flashed back; the doorway into the chamber opened.\r\n\r\nLarry as silent as I--we followed her through it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Reprinted in full in _Nature_, in which those sufficiently interested\r\nmay peruse it.--W. T. G.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nThe Shaping of the Shining One\r\n\r\nWe reached what I knew to be Lakla's own boudoir, if I may so call it.\r\nSmaller than any of the other chambers of the domed castle in which we\r\nhad been, its intimacy was revealed not only by its faint fragrance\r\nbut by its high mirrors of polished silver and various oddly wrought\r\narticles of the feminine toilet that lay here and there; things I\r\nafterward knew to be the work of the artisans of the _Akka_--and no\r\nmean metal workers were they. One of the window slits dropped almost\r\nto the floor, and at its base was a wide, comfortably cushioned seat\r\ncommanding a view of the bridge and of the cavern ledge. To this the\r\nhandmaiden beckoned us; sank upon it, drew Larry down beside her and\r\nmotioned me to sit close to him.\r\n\r\n\"Now this,\" she said, \"is what the Silent Ones have commanded me to\r\ntell you two: To you Larry, that knowing you may weigh all things in\r\nyour mind and answer as your spirit bids you a question that the Three\r\nwill ask--and what that is I know not,\" she murmured, \"and I, they\r\nsay, must answer, too--and it--frightens me!\"\r\n\r\nThe great golden eyes widened; darkened with dread; she sighed, shook\r\nher head impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"Not like us, and never like us,\" she spoke low, wonderingly, \"the\r\nSilent Ones say were they. Nor were those from which they sprang like\r\nthose from which we have come. Ancient, ancient beyond thought are the\r\n_Taithu_, the race of the Silent Ones. Far, far below this place where\r\nnow we sit, close to earth heart itself were they born; and there they\r\ndwelt for time upon time, _laya_ upon _laya_ upon _laya_--with others,\r\nnot like them, some of which have vanished time upon time agone,\r\nothers that still dwell--below--in their--cradle.\r\n\r\n\"It is hard\"--she hesitated--\"hard to tell this--that slips through my\r\nmind--because I know so little that even as the Three told it to me it\r\npassed from me for lack of place to stand upon,\" she went on,\r\nquaintly. \"Something there was of time when earth and sun were but\r\ncold mists in the--the heavens--something of these mists drawing\r\ntogether, whirling, whirling, faster and faster--drawing as they\r\nwhirled more and more of the mists--growing larger, growing\r\nwarm--forming at last into the globes they are, with others spinning\r\naround the sun--something of regions within this globe where vast fire\r\nwas prisoned and bursting forth tore and rent the young orb--of one\r\nsuch bursting forth that sent what you call moon flying out to company\r\nus and left behind those spaces whence we now dwell--and of--of life\r\nparticles that here and there below grew into the race of the Silent\r\nOnes, and those others--but not the _Akka_ which, like you, they say\r\ncame from above--and all this I do not understand--do you, Goodwin?\"\r\nshe appealed to me.\r\n\r\nI nodded--for what she had related so fragmentarily was in reality an\r\nexcellent approach to the Chamberlain-Moulton theory of a coalescing\r\nnebula contracting into the sun and its planets.\r\n\r\nAstonishing was the recognition of this theory.  Even more so was the\r\nreference to the life particles, the idea of Arrhenius, the great\r\nSwede, of life starting on earth through the dropping of minute, life\r\n_spores_, propelled through space by the driving power of light and,\r\nencountering favourable environment here, developing through the vast\r\nages into man and every other living thing we know.[1]\r\n\r\nNor was it incredible that in the ancient nebula that was the matrix\r\nof our solar system similar, or rather _dissimilar_, particles in all\r\nbut the subtle essence we call life, might have become entangled and,\r\nresisting every cataclysm as they had resisted the absolute zero of\r\nouter space, found in these caverned spaces their proper environment\r\nto develop into the race of the Silent Ones and--only _they_ could\r\ntell what else!\r\n\r\n\"They say,\" the handmaiden's voice was surer, \"they say that in\r\ntheir--cradle--near earth's heart they grew; grew untroubled by the\r\nturmoil and disorder which flayed the surface of this globe. And they\r\nsay it was a place of light and that strength came to them from earth\r\nheart--strength greater than you and those from which you sprang ever\r\nderived from sun.\r\n\r\n\"At last, ancient, ancient beyond all thought, they say again, was\r\nthis time--they began to know, to--to--realize--themselves. And\r\nwisdom came ever more swiftly. Up from their cradle, because they did\r\nnot wish to dwell longer with those--others--they came and found this\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\"When all the face of earth was covered with waters in which lived\r\nonly tiny, hungry things that knew naught save hunger and its\r\nsatisfaction, _they_ had attained wisdom that enabled them to make paths\r\nsuch as we have just travelled and to look out upon those waters! And\r\n_laya_ upon _laya_ thereafter, time upon time, they went upon the\r\npaths and watched the flood recede; saw great bare flats of steaming\r\nooze appear on which crawled and splashed larger things which had\r\ngrown from the tiny hungry ones; watched the flats rise higher and\r\nhigher and green life begin to clothe them; saw mountains uplift and\r\nvanish.\r\n\r\n\"Ever the green life waxed and the things which crept and crawled grew\r\ngreater and took ever different forms; until at last came a time when\r\nthe steaming mists lightened and the things which had begun as little\r\nmore than tiny hungry mouths were huge and monstrous, so huge that the\r\ntallest of my _Akka_ would not have reached the knee of the smallest\r\nof them.\r\n\r\n\"But in none of these, in _none_, was there--realization--of\r\nthemselves, say the Three; naught but hunger driving, always driving\r\nthem to still its crying.\r\n\r\n\"So for time upon time the race of the Silent Ones took the paths no\r\nmore, placing aside the half-thought that they had of making their way\r\nto earth face even as they had made their way from beside earth heart.\r\nThey turned wholly to the seeking of wisdom--and after other time on\r\ntime they attained that which killed even the faintest shadow of the\r\nhalf-thought. For they crept far within the mysteries of life and\r\ndeath, they mastered the illusion of space, they lifted the veils of\r\ncreation and of its twin destruction, and they stripped the covering\r\nfrom the flaming jewel of truth--but when they had crept within those\r\nmysteries they bid me tell _you_, Goodwin, they found ever other\r\nmysteries veiling the way; and after they had uncovered the jewel of\r\ntruth they found it to be a gem of infinite facets and therefore not\r\nwholly to be read before eternity's unthinkable end!\r\n\r\n\"And for this they were glad--because now throughout eternity might\r\nthey and theirs pursue knowledge over ways illimitable.\r\n\r\n\"They conquered light--light that sprang at their bidding from the\r\nnothingness that gives birth to all things and in which lie all things\r\nthat are, have been and shall be; light that streamed through their\r\nbodies cleansing them of all dross; light that was food and drink;\r\nlight that carried their vision afar or bore to them images out of\r\nspace opening many windows through which they gazed down upon life on\r\nthousands upon thousands of the rushing worlds; light that was the\r\nflame of life itself and in which they bathed, ever renewing their\r\nown. They set radiant lamps within the stones, and of black light they\r\nwove the sheltering shadows and the shadows that slay.\r\n\r\n\"Arose from this people those Three--the Silent Ones. They led them\r\nall in wisdom so that in the Three grew--pride. And the Three built\r\nthem this place in which we sit and set the Portal in its place and\r\nwithdrew from their kind to go alone into the mysteries and to map\r\nalone the facets of Truth Jewel.\r\n\r\n\"Then there came the ancestors of the--_Akka_; not as they are now,\r\nand glowing but faintly within them the spark of--self-realization.\r\nAnd the _Taithu_ seeing this spark did not slay them. But they took\r\nthe ancient, long untrodden paths and looked forth once more upon\r\nearth face. Now on the land were vast forests and a chaos of green\r\nlife. On the shores things scaled and fanged, fought and devoured each\r\nother, and in the green life moved bodies great and small that slew\r\nand ran from those that would slay.\r\n\r\n\"They searched for the passage through which the _Akka_ had come and\r\nclosed it. Then the Three took them and brought them here; and taught\r\nthem and blew upon the spark until it burned ever stronger and in time\r\nthey became much as they are now--my _Akka_.\r\n\r\n\"The Three took counsel after this and said--'We have strengthened\r\nlife in these until it has become articulate; shall we not _create_\r\nlife?'\" Again she hesitated, her eyes rapt, dreaming. \"The Three are\r\nspeaking,\" she murmured. \"They have my tongue--\"\r\n\r\nAnd certainly, with an ease and rapidity as though she were but a\r\nvoice through which minds far more facile, more powerful poured their\r\nthoughts, she spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Yea,\" the golden voice was vibrant.  \"We said that what we would\r\ncreate should be of the spirit of life itself, speaking to us with the\r\ntongues of the far-flung stars, of the winds, of the waters, and of\r\nall upon and within these. Upon that universal matrix of matter, that\r\nmother of all things that you name the ether, we laboured. Think not\r\nthat her wondrous fertility is limited by what ye see on earth or what\r\nhas been on earth from its beginning. Infinite, infinite are the forms\r\nthe mother bears and countless are the energies that are part of her.\r\n\r\n\"By our wisdom we had fashioned many windows out of our abode and\r\nthrough them we stared into the faces of myriads of worlds, and upon\r\nthem all were the children of ether even as the worlds themselves were\r\nher children.\r\n\r\n\"Watching we learned, and learning we formed that ye term the Dweller,\r\nwhich those without name--the Shining One. Within the Universal Mother\r\nwe shaped it, to be a voice to tell us her secrets, a lamp to go\r\nbefore us lighting the mysteries. Out of the ether we fashioned it,\r\ngiving it the soul of light that still ye know not nor perhaps ever\r\nmay know, and with the essence of life that ye saw blossoming deep in\r\nthe abyss and that is the pulse of earth heart we filled it. And we\r\nwrought with pain and with love, with yearning and with scorching\r\npride and from our travail came the Shining One--our child!\r\n\r\n\"There is an energy beyond and above ether, a purposeful, sentient\r\nforce that laps like an ocean the furthest-flung star, that transfuses\r\nall that ether bears, that sees and speaks and feels in us and in you,\r\nthat is incorporate in beast and bird and reptile, in tree and grass\r\nand all living things, that sleeps in rock and stone, that finds\r\nsparkling tongue in jewel and star and in all dwellers within the\r\nfirmament. And this ye call consciousness!\r\n\r\n\"We crowned the Shining One with the seven orbs of light which are the\r\nchannels between it and the sentience we sought to make articulate,\r\nthe portals through which flow its currents and so flowing, become\r\nchoate, vocal, self-realizant within our child.\r\n\r\n\"But as we shaped, there passed some of the essence of our pride; in\r\ngiving will we had given power, perforce, to exercise that will for\r\ngood or for evil, to speak or to be silent, to tell us what we wished\r\nof that which poured into it through the seven orbs or to withhold\r\nthat knowledge itself; and in forging it from the immortal energies we\r\nhad endowed it with their indifference; open to all consciousness it\r\nheld within it the pole of utter joy and the pole of utter woe with\r\nall the arc that lies between; all the ecstasies of the countless\r\nworlds and suns and all their sorrows; all that ye symbolize as gods\r\nand all ye symbolize as devils--not negativing each other, for there\r\nis no such thing as negation, but holding them together, balancing\r\nthem, encompassing them, pole upon pole!\"\r\n\r\nSo _this_ was the explanation of the entwined emotions of joy and terror\r\nthat had changed so appallingly Throckmartin's face and the faces of\r\nall the Dweller's slaves!\r\n\r\nThe handmaiden's eyes grew bright, alert, again; the brooding passed\r\nfrom her face; the golden voice that had been so deep found its own\r\nfamiliar pitch.\r\n\r\n\"I listened while the Three spoke to you,\" she said.  \"Now the shaping\r\nof the Shining One had been a long, long travail and time had flown\r\nover the outer world _laya_ upon _laya_. For a space the Shining One\r\nwas content to dwell here; to be fed with the foods of light: to open\r\nthe eyes of the Three to mystery upon mystery and to read for them\r\nfacet after facet of the gem of truth. Yet as the tides of\r\nconsciousness flowed through it they left behind shadowings and echoes\r\nof their burdens; and the Shining One grew stronger, always stronger\r\nof _itself within itself_. Its will strengthened and now not always was\r\nit the will of the Three; and the pride that was woven in the making\r\nof it waxed, while the love for them that its creators had set within\r\nit waned.\r\n\r\n\"Not ignorant were the _Taithu_ of the work of the Three. First there\r\nwere a few, then more and more who coveted the Shining One and who\r\nwould have had the Three share with them the knowledge it drew in for\r\nthem. But the Silent Ones in their pride, would not.\r\n\r\n\"There came a time when its will was now _all_ its own, and it rebelled,\r\nturning its gaze to the wider spaces beyond the Portal, offering\r\nitself to the many there who would serve it; tiring of the Three,\r\ntheir control and their abode.\r\n\r\n\"Now the Shining One has its limitations, even as we.  Over water it\r\ncan pass, through air and through fire; but pass it cannot, through\r\nrock or metal. So it sent a message--how I know not--to the _Taithu_\r\nwho desired it, whispering to them the secret of the Portal. And when\r\nthe time was ripe they opened the Portal and the Shining One passed\r\nthrough it to them; nor would it return to the Three though they\r\ncommanded, and when they would have forced it they found that it had\r\nhived and hidden a knowledge that they could not overcome.\r\n\r\n\"Yet by their arts the Three could have shattered the seven shining\r\norbs; but they would not because--they loved, it!\r\n\r\n\"Those to whom it had gone built for it that place I have shown you,\r\nand they bowed to it and drew wisdom from it. And ever they turned\r\nmore and more from the ways in which the _Taithu_ had walked--for it\r\nseemed that which came to the Shining One through the seven orbs had\r\nless and less of good and more and more of the power you call evil.\r\nKnowledge it gave and understanding, yes; but not that which, clear\r\nand serene, lights the paths of right wisdom; rather were they flares\r\npointing the dark roads that lead to--to the ultimate evil!\r\n\r\n\"Not all of the race of the Three followed the counsel of the Shining\r\nOne. There were many, many, who would have none of it nor of its\r\npower. So were the _Taithu_ split; and to this place where there had\r\nbeen none, came hatred, fear and suspicion. Those who pursued the\r\nancient ways went to the Three and pleaded with them to destroy their\r\nwork--and they would not, for still they loved it.\r\n\r\n\"Stronger grew the Dweller and less and less did it lay before its\r\nworshippers--for now so they had become--the fruits of its knowledge;\r\nand it grew--restless--turning its gaze upon earth face even as it had\r\nturned it from the Three. It whispered to the _Taithu_ to take again\r\nthe paths and look out upon the world. Lo! above them was a great\r\nfertile land on which dwelt an unfamiliar race, skilled in arts,\r\nseeking and finding wisdom--mankind! Mighty builders were they; vast\r\nwere their cities and huge their temples of stone.\r\n\r\n\"They called their lands Muria and they worshipped a god Thanaroa whom\r\nthey imagined to be the maker of all things, dwelling far away. They\r\nworshipped as closer gods, not indifferent but to be prayed to and to\r\nbe propitiated, the moon and the sun. Two kings they had, each with\r\nhis council and his court. One was high priest to the moon and the\r\nother high priest to the sun.\r\n\r\n\"The mass of this people were black-haired, but the sun king and his\r\nnobles were ruddy with hair like mine; and the moon king and his\r\nfollowers were like Yolara--or Lugur. And this, the Three say,\r\nGoodwin, came about because for time upon time the law had been that\r\nwhenever a ruddy-haired or ashen-tressed child was born of the\r\nblack-haired it became dedicated at once to either sun god or moon\r\ngod, later wedding and bearing children only to their own kind. Until\r\nat last from the black-haired came no more of the light-locked ones,\r\nbut the ruddy ones, being stronger, still arose from them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Professor Svante August Arrhenius, in his _Worlds in the Making_--the\r\nconception that life is universally diffused, constantly emitted\r\nfrom all habitable worlds in the form of spores which traverse space\r\nfor years and ages, the majority being ultimately destroyed by the\r\nheat of some blazing star, but some few finding a resting-place on\r\nglobes which have reached the habitable stage.--W. T. G.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nThe Building of the Moon Pool\r\n\r\nShe paused, running her long fingers through her own bronze-flecked\r\nringlets. Selective breeding this, with a vengeance, I thought; an\r\nancient experiment in heredity which of course would in time result in\r\nthe stamping out of the tendency to depart from type that lies in all\r\norganisms; resulting, obviously, at last, in three fixed forms of\r\nblack-haired, ruddy-haired, and silver-haired--but this, with a shock\r\nof realization it came to me, was also an accurate description of the\r\ndark-polled _ladala_, their fair-haired rulers and of the golden-brown\r\ntressed Lakla!\r\n\r\nHow--questions began to stream through my mind; silenced by the\r\nhandmaiden's voice.\r\n\r\n\"Above, far, far above the abode of the Shining One,\" she said, \"was\r\ntheir greatest temple, holding the shrines both of sun and moon. All\r\nabout it were other temples hidden behind mighty walls, each enclosing\r\nits own space and squared and ruled and standing within a shallow\r\nlake; the sacred city, the city of the gods of this land--\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the Nan-Matal that she is describing,\" I thought.\r\n\r\n\"Out upon all this looked the _Taithu_ who were now but the servants\r\nof the Shining One as it had been the messenger of the Three,\" she\r\nwent on. \"When they returned the Shining One spoke to them, promising\r\nthem dominion over all that they had seen, yea, _under it_ dominion of\r\nall earth itself and later perhaps of other earths!\r\n\r\n\"In the Shining One had grown craft, cunning; knowledge to gain that\r\nwhich it desired. Therefore it told its _Taithu_--and mayhap told\r\nthem truth--that not yet was it time for _them_ to go forth; that slowly\r\nmust they pass into that outer world, for they had sprung from heart\r\nof earth and even it lacked power to swirl unaided into and through\r\nthe above. Then it counselled them, instructing them what to do. They\r\nhollowed the chamber wherein first I saw you, cutting their way to it\r\nthat path down which from it you sped.\r\n\r\n\"It revealed to them that the force that is within moon flame is kin\r\nto the force that is within it, for the chamber of its birth was the\r\nchamber too of moon birth and into it went the subtle essence and\r\npowers that flow in that earth child: and it taught them how to make\r\nthat which fills what you call the Moon Pool whose opening is close\r\nbehind its Veil hanging upon the gleaming cliffs.\r\n\r\n\"When this was done it taught them how to make and how to place the\r\nseven lights through which moon flame streams into Moon Pool--the\r\nseven lights that are kin to its own seven orbs even as its fires are\r\nkin to moon fires--and which would open for it a path that it could\r\ntread. And all this the _Taithu_ did, working so secretly that neither\r\nthose of their race whose faces were set against the Shining One nor\r\nthe busy men above know aught of it.\r\n\r\n\"When it was done they moved up the path, clustering within the Moon\r\nPool Chamber. Moon flame streamed through the seven globes, poured\r\ndown upon the pool; they saw mists arise, embrace, and become one with\r\nthe moon flame--and then up through Moon Pool, shaping itself within\r\nthe mists of light, whirling, radiant--the Shining One!\r\n\r\n\"Almost free, almost loosed upon the world it coveted!\r\n\r\n\"Again it counselled them, and they pierced the passage whose portal\r\nyou found first; set the fires within its stones, and revealing\r\nthemselves to the moon king and his priests spake to them even as the\r\nShining One had instructed.\r\n\r\n\"Now was the moon king filled with fear when he looked upon the\r\n_Taithu_, shrouded with protecting mists of light in Moon Pool\r\nChamber, and heard their words. Yet, being crafty, he thought of the\r\npower that would be his if he heeded and how quickly the strength of\r\nthe sun king would dwindle. So he and his made a pact with the Shining\r\nOne's messengers.\r\n\r\n\"When next the moon was round and poured its flames down upon Moon\r\nPool, the _Taithu_ gathered there again, watched the child of the\r\nThree take shape within the pillars, speed away--and out! They heard a\r\nmighty shouting, a tumult of terror, of awe and of worship; a silence;\r\na vast sighing--and they waited, wrapped in their mists of light, for\r\nthey feared to follow nor were they near the paths that would have\r\nenabled them to look without.\r\n\r\n\"Another tumult--and back came the Shining One, murmuring with joy,\r\npulsing, triumphant, and clasped within its vapours a man and woman,\r\nruddy-haired, golden-eyed, in whose faces rapture and horror lay side\r\nby side--gloriously, hideously. And still holding them it danced above\r\nthe Moon Pool and--sank!\r\n\r\n\"Now must I be brief. _Lat_ after _lat_ the Shining One went forth,\r\nreturning with its sacrifices. And stronger after each it grew--and\r\ngayer and more cruel. Ever when it passed with its prey toward the\r\npool, the _Taithu_ who watched felt a swift, strong intoxication, a\r\ndrunkenness of spirit, streaming from it to them. And the Shining One\r\nforgot what it had promised them of dominion--and in this new evil\r\ndelight they too forgot.\r\n\r\n\"The outer land was torn with hatred and open strife. The moon king\r\nand his kind, through the guidance of the evil _Taithu_ and the favour\r\nof the Shining One, had become powerful and the sun king and his were\r\ndarkened. And the moon priests preached that the child of the Three\r\nwas the moon god itself come to dwell with them.\r\n\r\n\"Now vast tides arose and when they withdrew they took with them great\r\nportions of this country. And the land itself began to sink. Then said\r\nthe moon king that the moon had called to ocean to destroy because\r\nwroth that another than he was worshipped. The people believed and\r\nthere was slaughter. When it was over there was no more a sun king nor\r\nany of the ruddy-haired folk; slain were they, slain down to the babe\r\nat breast.\r\n\r\n\"But still the tides swept higher; still dwindled the land!\r\n\r\n\"As it shrank multitudes of the fleeing people were led through Moon\r\nPool Chamber and carried here. They were what now are called the\r\n_ladala_, and they were given place and set to work; and they thrived.\r\nCame many of the fair-haired; and they were given dwellings. They sat\r\nbeside the evil _Taithu_; they became drunk even as they with the\r\ndancing of the Shining One; they learned--not all; only a little part\r\nbut little enough--of their arts. And ever the Shining One danced more\r\ngaily out there within the black amphitheatre; grew ever stronger--and\r\never the hordes of its slaves behind the Veil increased.\r\n\r\n\"Nor did the _Taithu_ who clung to the old ways check this--they\r\ncould not. By the sinking of the land above, their own spaces were\r\nimperilled. All of their strength and all of their wisdom it took to\r\nkeep this land from perishing; nor had they help from those others mad\r\nfor the poison of the Shining One; and they had no time to deal with\r\nthem nor the earth race with whom they had foregathered.\r\n\r\n\"At last came a slow, vast flood.  It rolled even to the bases of the\r\nwalled islets of the city of the gods--and within these now were all\r\nthat were left of my people on earth face.\r\n\r\n\"I am of those people,\" she paused, looking at me proudly, \"one of the\r\ndaughters of the sun king whose seed is still alive in the _ladala_!\"\r\n\r\nAs Larry opened his mouth to speak she waved a silencing hand.\r\n\r\n\"This tide did not recede,\" she went on.  \"And after a time the\r\nremnant, the moon king leading them, joined those who had already fled\r\nbelow. The rocks became still, the quakings ceased, and now those\r\nAncient Ones who had been labouring could take breath. And anger grew\r\nwithin them as they looked upon the work of their evil kin. Again they\r\nsought the Three--and the Three now knew what they had done and their\r\npride was humbled. They would not slay the Shining One themselves, for\r\nstill they loved it; but they instructed these others how to undo\r\ntheir work; how also they might destroy the evil _Taithu_ were it\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\"Armed with the wisdom of the Three they went forth--but now the\r\nShining One was strong indeed. They could not slay it!\r\n\r\n\"Nay, it knew and was prepared; they could not even pass beyond its\r\nVeil nor seal its abode. Ah, strong, strong, mighty of will, full of\r\ncraft and cunning had the Shining One become. So they turned upon\r\ntheir kind who had gone astray and made them perish, to the last. The\r\nShining One came not to the aid of its servants--though they called;\r\nfor within its will was the thought that they were of no further use\r\nto it; that it would rest awhile and dance with them--who had so\r\nlittle of the power and wisdom of its _Taithu_ and therefore no reins\r\nupon it. And while this was happening black-haired and fair-haired ran\r\nand hid and were but shaking vessels of terror.\r\n\r\n\"The Ancient Ones took counsel.  This was their decision; that they\r\nwould go from the gardens before the Silver Waters--leaving, since\r\nthey could not kill it, the Shining One with its worshippers. They\r\nsealed the mouth of the passage that leads to the Moon Pool Chamber\r\nand they changed the face of the cliff so that none might tell where\r\nit had been. But the passage itself they left open--having\r\nforeknowledge I think, of a thing that was to come to pass in the far\r\nfuture--perhaps it was your journey here, my Larry and Goodwin--verily\r\nI think so. And they destroyed all the ways save that which\r\nwe three trod to the Dweller's abode.\r\n\r\n\"For the last time they went to the Three--to pass sentence upon them.\r\nThis was the doom--that here they should remain, alone, among the\r\n_Akka_, served by them, until that time dawned when they would have\r\nwill to destroy the evil they had created--and even now--loved; nor\r\nmight they seek death, nor follow their judges until this had come to\r\npass. This was the doom they put upon the Three for the wickedness\r\nthat had sprung from their pride, and they strengthened it with their\r\narts that it might not be broken.\r\n\r\n\"Then they passed--to a far land they had chosen where the Shining One\r\ncould not go, beyond the Black Precipices of Doul, a green land--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ireland!\" interrupted Larry, with conviction, \"I knew it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Since then time upon time had passed,\" she went on, unheeding.  \"The\r\npeople called this place Muria after their sunken land and soon they\r\nforgot where had been the passage the _Taithu_ had sealed. The moon\r\nking became the Voice of the Dweller and always with the Voice is a\r\nwoman of the moon king's kin who is its priestess.\r\n\r\n\"And many have been the journeys upward of the Shining One, through\r\nthe Moon Pool--returning with still others in its coils.\r\n\r\n\"And now again has it grown restless, longing for the wider spaces.\r\nIt has spoken to Yolara and to Lugur even as it did to the dead\r\n_Taithu_, promising them dominion. And it has grown stronger, drawing\r\nto itself power to go far on the moon stream where it will. Thus was\r\nit able to seize your friend, Goodwin, and Olaf's wife and babe--and\r\nmany more. Yolara and Lugur plan to open way to earth face; to depart\r\nwith their court and under the Shining One grasp the world!\r\n\r\n\"And this is the tale the Silent Ones bade me tell you--and it is\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\nBreathlessly I had listened to the stupendous epic of a long-lost\r\nworld. Now I found speech to voice the question ever with me, the\r\nthing that lay as close to my heart as did the welfare of Larry,\r\nindeed the whole object of my quest--the fate of Throckmartin and\r\nthose who had passed with him into the Dweller's lair; yes, and of\r\nOlaf's wife, too.\r\n\r\n\"Lakla,\" I said, \"the friend who drew me here and those he loved who\r\nwent before him--can we not save them?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Three say no, Goodwin.\" There was again in her eyes the pity with\r\nwhich she had looked upon Olaf. \"The Shining One--_feeds_--upon the\r\nflame of life itself, setting in its place its own fires and its own\r\nwill. Its slaves are only shells through which it gleams. Death, say\r\nthe Three, is the best that can come to them; yet will that be a boon\r\ngreat indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they have souls, _mavourneen_,\" Larry said to her. \"And they're\r\nalive still--in a way. Anyhow, their souls have not gone from them.\"\r\n\r\nI caught a hope from his words--sceptic though I am--holding that the\r\nexistence of soul has never been proved by dependable laboratory\r\nmethods--for they recalled to me that when I had seen Throckmartin,\r\nEdith had been close beside him.\r\n\r\n\"It was days after his wife was taken, that the Dweller seized\r\nThrockmartin,\" I cried. \"How, if their wills, their life, were indeed\r\ngone, how did they find each other mid all that horde? How did they\r\ncome together in the Dweller's lair?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know,\" she answered, slowly.  \"You say they loved--and it is\r\ntrue that love is stronger even than death!\"\r\n\r\n\"One thing I _don't_ understand\"--this was Larry again--\"is why a girl\r\nlike you keeps coming out of the black-haired crowd; so frequently and\r\none might say, so regularly, Lakla. Aren't there ever any red-headed\r\nboys--and if they are what becomes of them?\"\r\n\r\n\"That, Larry, I cannot answer,\" she said, very frankly. \"There was a\r\npact of some kind; how made or by whom I know not. But for long the\r\nMurians feared the return of the _Taithu_ and greatly they feared the\r\nThree. Even the Shining One feared those who had created it--for a\r\ntime; and not even now is it eager to face them--_that_ I know. Nor are\r\nYolara and Lugur so _sure_. It may be that the Three commanded it: but\r\nhow or why I know not. I only know that it is true--for here am I and\r\nfrom where else would I have come?\"\r\n\r\n\"From Ireland,\" said Larry O'Keefe, promptly.  \"And that's where\r\nyou're going. For 'tis no place for a girl like you to have been\r\nbrought up--Lakla; what with people like frogs, and a half-god three\r\nquarters devil, and red oceans, an' the only Irish things yourself and\r\nthe Silent Ones up there, bless their hearts. It's no place for ye,\r\nand by the soul of St. Patrick, it's out of it soon ye'll be gettin'!\"\r\n\r\nLarry!  Larry!  If it had but been true--and I could see Lakla and you\r\nbeside me now!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nLarry and the Frog-Men\r\n\r\nLong had been her tale in the telling, and too long, perhaps, have I\r\nbeen in the repeating--but not every day are the mists rolled away to\r\nreveal undreamed secrets of earth-youth. And I have set it down here,\r\nadding nothing, taking nothing from it; translating liberally, it is\r\ntrue, but constantly striving, while putting it into idea-forms and\r\nphraseology to be readily understood by my readers, to keep accurately\r\nto the spirit. And this, I must repeat, I have done throughout my\r\nnarrative, wherever it has been necessary to record conversation with\r\nthe Murians.\r\n\r\nRising, I found I was painfully stiff--as muscle-bound as though I had\r\nactually trudged many miles. Larry, imitating me, gave an involuntary\r\ngroan.\r\n\r\n\"Faith, _mavourneen_,\" he said to Lakla, relapsing unconsciously into\r\nEnglish, \"your roads would never wear out shoe-leather, but they've\r\ngot their kick, just the same!\"\r\n\r\nShe understood our plight, if not his words; gave a soft little cry of\r\nmingled pity and self-reproach; forced us back upon the cushions.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but I'm sorry!\" mourned Lakla, leaning over us.  \"I had\r\nforgotten--for those new to it the way is a weary one, indeed--\"\r\n\r\nShe ran to the doorway, whistled a clear high note down the passage.\r\nThrough the hangings came two of the frog-men. She spoke to them\r\nrapidly. They crouched toward us, what certainly was meant for an\r\namiable grin wrinkling the grotesque muzzles, baring the glistening\r\nrows of needle-teeth. And while I watched them with the fascination\r\nthat they never lost for me, the monsters calmly swung one arm around\r\nour knees, lifted us up like babies--and as calmly started to walk\r\naway with us!\r\n\r\n\"Put me down!  Put me down, I say!\" The O'Keefe's voice was both\r\noutraged and angry; squinting around I saw him struggling violently to\r\nget to his feet. The _Akka_ only held him tighter, booming\r\ncomfortingly, peering down into his flushed face inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\"But, Larry--darlin'!\"--Lakla's tones were--well, maternally\r\nsurprised--\"you're stiff and sore, and Kra can carry you quite\r\neasily.\"\r\n\r\n\"I _won't_ be carried!\" sputtered the O'Keefe.  \"Damn it, Goodwin, there\r\nare such things as the unities even here, an' for a lieutenant of the\r\nRoyal Air Force to be picked up an' carted around like a--like a\r\nbundle of rags--it's not discipline! Put me down, ye _omadhaun_, or\r\nI'll poke ye in the snout!\" he shouted to his bearer--who only boomed\r\ngently, and stared at the handmaiden, plainly for further\r\ninstructions.\r\n\r\n\"But, Larry--dear!\"--Lakla was plainly distressed--\"it will _hurt_ you\r\nto walk; and I don't _want_ you to hurt, Larry--darlin'!\"\r\n\r\n\"Holy shade of St. Patrick!\" moaned Larry; again he made a mighty\r\neffort to tear himself from the frog-man's grip; gave up with a groan.\r\n\"Listen, _alanna_!\" he said plaintively. \"When we get to Ireland, you\r\nand I, we won't have anybody to pick us up and carry us about every\r\ntime we get a bit tired. And it's getting me in bad habits you are!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, _yes_, we will, Larry!\" cried the handmaiden, \"because many, oh,\r\nmany, of my _Akka_ will go with us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you tell this--BOOB!--to put me down!\" gritted the now\r\nthoroughly aroused O'Keefe. I couldn't help laughing; he glared at me.\r\n\r\n\"Bo-oo-ob?\" exclaimed Lakla.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, boo-oo-ob!\" said O'Keefe, \"an' I have no desire to explain the\r\nword in my present position, light of my soul!\"\r\n\r\nThe handmaiden sighed, plainly dejected.  But she spoke again to the\r\n_Akka_, who gently lowered the O'Keefe to the floor.\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand,\" she said hopelessly, \"if you want to walk, why,\r\nof course, you shall, Larry.\" She turned to me.\r\n\r\n\"Do you?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"I do not,\" I said firmly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" murmured Lakla, \"go you, Larry and Goodwin, with Kra and\r\nGulk, and let them minister to you. After, sleep a little--for not\r\nsoon will Rador and Olaf return. And let me feel your lips before you\r\ngo, Larry--darlin'!\" She covered his eyes caressingly with her soft\r\nlittle palms; pushed him away.\r\n\r\n\"Now go,\" said Lakla, \"and rest!\"\r\n\r\nUnashamed I lay back against the horny chest of Gulk; and with a smile\r\nnoticed that Larry, even if he had rebelled at being carried, did not\r\ndisdain the support of Kra's shining, black-scaled arm which, slipping\r\naround his waist, half-lifted him along.\r\n\r\nThey parted a hanging and dropped us softly down beside a little pool,\r\nsparkling with the clear water that had heretofore been brought us in\r\nthe wide basins. Then they began to undress us. And at this point the\r\nO'Keefe gave up.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever they're going to do we can't stop 'em, Doc!\" he moaned.\r\n\"Anyway, I feel as though I've been pulled through a knot-hole, and I\r\ndon't care--I don't care--as the song says.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we were stripped we were lowered gently into the water.  But not\r\nlong did the _Akka_ let us splash about the shallow basin. They lifted\r\nus out, and from jars began deftly to anoint and rub us with aromatic\r\nunguents.\r\n\r\nI think that in all the medley of grotesque, of tragic, of baffling,\r\nstrange and perilous experiences in that underground world none was\r\nmore bizarre than this--valeting. I began to laugh, Larry joined me,\r\nand then Kra and Gulk joined in our merriment with deep batrachian\r\ncachinnations and gruntings. Then, having finished apparelling us and\r\nstill chuckling, the two touched our arms and led us out, into a room\r\nwhose circular sides were ringed with soft divans. Still smiling, I\r\nsank at once into sleep.\r\n\r\nHow long I slumbered I do not know.  A low and thunderous booming\r\ncoming through the deep window slit, reverberated through the room and\r\nawakened me. Larry yawned; arose briskly.\r\n\r\n\"Sounds as though the bass drums of every jazz band in New York were\r\nserenading us!\" he observed. Simultaneously we sprang to the window;\r\npeered through.\r\n\r\nWe were a little above the level of the bridge, and its full length\r\nwas plain before us. Thousands upon thousands of the _Akka_ were\r\ncrowding upon it, and far away other hordes filled like a glittering\r\nthicket both sides of the cavern ledge's crescent strand. On black\r\nscale and orange scale the crimson light fell, picking them off in\r\nlittle flickering points.\r\n\r\nUpon the platform from which sprang the smaller span over the abyss\r\nwere Lakla, Olaf, and Rador; the handmaiden clearly acting as\r\ninterpreter between them and the giant she had called Nak, the Frog\r\nKing.\r\n\r\n\"Come on!\" shouted Larry.\r\n\r\nOut of the open portal we ran; over the World Heart Bridge--and\r\nstraight into the group.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" cried Lakla, \"I didn't want you to wake up so soon,\r\nLarry--darlin'!\"\r\n\r\n\"See here, _mavourneen_!\" Indignation thrilled in the Irishman's\r\nvoice. \"I'm not going to be done up with baby-ribbons and laid away in\r\na cradle for safe-keeping while a fight is on; don't think it. Why\r\ndidn't you call me?\"\r\n\r\n\"You needed rest!\" There was indomitable determination in the\r\nhandmaiden's tones, the eternal maternal shining defiant from her\r\neyes. \"You were tired and you hurt! You shouldn't have got up!\"\r\n\r\n\"Needed the rest!\" groaned Larry.  \"Look here, Lakla, what do you\r\nthink I am?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're all I have,\" said that maiden firmly, \"and I'm going to take\r\ncare of you, Larry--darlin'! Don't you ever think anything else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, pulse of my heart, considering my delicate health and general\r\nfragility, would it hurt me, do you think, to be told what's going\r\non?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, Larry!\" answered the handmaiden serenely. \"Yolara went\r\nthrough the Portal. She was very, _very_ angry--\"\r\n\r\n\"She was all the devil's woman that she is!\" rumbled Olaf.\r\n\r\n\"Rador met the messenger,\" went on the Golden Girl calmly.  \"The\r\n_ladala_ are ready to rise when Lugur and Yolara lead their hosts\r\nagainst us. They will strike at those left behind. And in the meantime\r\nwe shall have disposed my _Akka_ to meet Yolara's men. And on that\r\ndisposal we must all take counsel, you, Larry, and Rador, Olaf and\r\nGoodwin and Nak, the ruler of the _Akka_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did the messenger give any idea when Yolara expects to make her\r\nlittle call?\" asked Larry.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she answered.  \"They prepare, and we may expect them in--\" She\r\ngave the equivalent of about thirty-six hours of our time.\r\n\r\n\"But, Lakla,\" I said, the doubt that I had long been holding finding\r\nvoice, \"should the Shining One come--with its slaves--are the Three\r\nstrong enough to cope with it?\"\r\n\r\nThere was troubled doubt in her own eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know,\" she said at last, frankly.  \"You have heard their\r\nstory. What they promise is that they will help. I do not know--any\r\nmore than do you, Goodwin!\"\r\n\r\nI looked up at the dome beneath which I knew the dread Trinity stared\r\nforth; even down upon us. And despite the awe, the assurance, I had\r\nfelt when I stood before them I, too, doubted.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Larry, \"you and I, uncle,\" he turned to Rador, \"and Olaf\r\nhere had better decide just what part of the battle we'll lead--\"\r\n\r\n\"Lead!\" the handmaiden was appalled. \"_You_ lead, Larry? Why you are\r\nto stay with Goodwin and with me--up there, there we can watch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heart's beloved,\" O'Keefe was stern indeed.  \"A thousand times I've\r\nlooked Death straight in the face, peered into his eyes. Yes, and with\r\nten thousand feet of space under me an' bursting shells tickling the\r\nribs of the boat I was in. An' d'ye think I'll sit now on the\r\ngrandstand an' watch while a game like this is being pulled? Ye don't\r\nknow your future husband, soul of my delight!\"\r\n\r\nAnd so we started toward the golden opening, squads of the frog-men\r\nfollowing us soldierly and disappearing about the huge structure. Nor\r\ndid we stop until we came to the handmaiden's boudoir. There we seated\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Larry, \"two things I want to know.  First--how many can\r\nYolara muster against us; second, how many of these _Akka_ have we to\r\nmeet them?\"\r\n\r\nRador gave our equivalent for eighty thousand men as the force Yolara\r\ncould muster without stripping her city. Against this force, it\r\nappeared, we could count, roughly, upon two hundred thousand of the\r\n_Akka_.\r\n\r\n\"And they're some fighters!\" exclaimed Larry.  \"Hell, with odds like\r\nthat what're you worrying about? It's over before it's begun.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, _Larree_,\" objected Rador to this, \"you forget that the nobles\r\nwill have the _Keth_--and other things; also that the soldiers have\r\nfought against the _Akka_ before and will be shielded very well from\r\ntheir spears and clubs--and that their blades and javelins can bite\r\nthrough the scales of Nak's warriors. They have many things--\"\r\n\r\n\"Uncle,\" interjected O'Keefe, \"one thing they have is your nerve.\r\nWhy, we're more than two to one. And take it from me--\"\r\n\r\nWithout warning dropped the tragedy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n\"Your Love; Your Lives; Your Souls!\"\r\n\r\nLakla had taken no part in the talk since we had reached her bower.\r\nShe had seated herself close to the O'Keefe. Glancing at her I had\r\nseen steal over her face that brooding, listening look that was hers\r\nwhenever in that mysterious communion with the Three. It vanished;\r\nswiftly she arose; interrupted the Irishman without ceremony.\r\n\r\n\"Larry darlin',\" said the handmaiden.  \"The Silent Ones summon us!\"\r\n\r\n\"When do we go?\" I asked; Larry's face grew bright with interest.\r\n\r\n\"The time is now,\" she said--and hesitated.  \"Larry dear, put your\r\narms about me,\" she faltered, \"for there is something cold that\r\ncatches at my heart--and I am afraid.\"\r\n\r\nAt his exclamation she gathered herself together; gave a shaky little\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\"It's because I love you so that fear has power to plague me,\" she\r\ntold him.\r\n\r\nWithout another word he bent and kissed her; in silence we passed on,\r\nhis arm still about her girdled waist, golden head and black close\r\ntogether. Soon we stood before the crimson slab that was the door to\r\nthe sanctuary of the Silent Ones. She poised uncertainly before it;\r\nthen with a defiant arching of the proud little head that sent all the\r\nbronze-flecked curls flying, she pressed. It slipped aside and once\r\nmore the opalescence gushed out, flooding all about us.\r\n\r\nDazzled as before, I followed through the lambent cascades pouring\r\nfrom the high, carved walls; paused, and my eyes clearing, looked\r\nup--straight into the faces of the Three. The angled orbs centred upon\r\nthe handmaiden; softened as I had seen them do when first we had faced\r\nthem. She smiled up; seemed to listen.\r\n\r\n\"Come closer,\" she commanded, \"close to the feet of the Silent Ones.\"\r\n\r\nWe moved, pausing at the very base of the dais.  The sparkling mists\r\nthinned; the great heads bent slightly over us; through the veils I\r\ncaught a glimpse of huge columnar necks, enormous shoulders covered\r\nwith draperies as of pale-blue fire.\r\n\r\nI came back to attention with a start, for Lakla was answering a\r\nquestion only heard by her, and, answering it aloud, I perceived for\r\nour benefit; for whatever was the mode of communication between those\r\nwhose handmaiden she was, and her, it was clearly independent of\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n\"He has been told,\" she said, \"even as you commanded.\"\r\n\r\nDid I see a shadow of pain flit across the flickering eyes? Wondering,\r\nI glanced at Lakla's face and there was a dawn of foreboding and\r\nbewilderment. For a little she held her listening attitude; then the\r\ngaze of the Three left her; focused upon the O'Keefe.\r\n\r\n\"Thus speak the Silent Ones--through Lakla, their handmaiden,\" the\r\ngolden voice was like low trumpet notes. \"At the threshold of doom is\r\nthat world of yours above. Yea, even the doom, Goodwin, that ye\r\ndreamed and the shadow of which, looking into your mind they see, say\r\nthe Three. For not upon earth and never upon earth can man find means\r\nto destroy the Shining One.\"\r\n\r\nShe listened again--and the foreboding deepened to an amazed fear.\r\n\r\n\"They say, the Silent Ones,\" she went on, \"that they know not whether\r\neven they have power to destroy. Energies we know nothing of entered\r\ninto its shaping and are part of it; and still other energies it has\r\ngathered to itself\"--she paused; a shadow of puzzlement crept into her\r\nvoice \"and other energies still, forces that ye _do_ know and symbolize\r\nby certain names--hatred and pride and lust and many others which are\r\nforces real as that hidden in the _Keth_; and among them--fear, which\r\nweakens all those others--\" Again she paused.\r\n\r\n\"But within it is nothing of that greatest of all, that which can make\r\npowerless all the evil others, that which we call--love,\" she ended\r\nsoftly.\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to be the one to put a little more _fear_ in the beast,\"\r\nwhispered Larry to me, grimly in our own English. The three weird\r\nheads bent, ever so slightly--and I gasped, and Larry grew a little\r\nwhite as Lakla nodded--\r\n\r\n\"They say, Larry,\" she said, \"that there you touch one side of the\r\nheart of the matter--for it is through the way of fear the Silent Ones\r\nhope to strike at the very life of the Shining One!\"\r\n\r\nThe visage Larry turned to me was eloquent of wonder; and mine\r\nreflected it--for what _really_ were this Three to whom our minds were\r\nbut open pages, so easily read? Not long could we conjecture; Lakla\r\nbroke the little silence.\r\n\r\n\"This, they say, is what is to happen.  First will come upon us Lugur\r\nand Yolara with all their host. Because of fear the Shining One will\r\nlurk behind within its lair; for despite all, the Dweller _does_ dread\r\nthe Three, and only them. With this host the Voice and the priestess\r\nwill strive to conquer. And if they do, then will they be strong\r\nenough, too, to destroy us all. For if they take the abode they banish\r\nfrom the Dweller all fear and sound the end of the Three.\r\n\r\n\"Then will the Shining One be all free indeed; free to go out into the\r\nworld, free to do there as it wills!\r\n\r\n\"But if they do not conquer--and the Shining One comes not to their\r\naid, abandoning them even as it abandoned its own _Taithu_--then will\r\nthe Three be loosed from a part of their doom, and they will go\r\nthrough the Portal, seek the Shining One beyond the Veil, and,\r\npiercing it through fear's opening, destroy it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's quite clear,\" murmured the O'Keefe in my ear. \"Weaken the\r\nmorale--then smash. I've seen it happen a dozen times in Europe. While\r\nthey've got their nerve there's not a thing you can do; get their\r\nnerve--and not a thing can they do. And yet in both cases they're the\r\nsame men.\"\r\n\r\nLakla had been listening again.  She turned, thrust out hands to\r\nLarry, a wild hope in her eyes--and yet a hope half shamed.\r\n\r\n\"They say,\" she cried, \"that they give us choice.  Remembering that\r\nyour world doom hangs in the balance, we have choice--choice to stay\r\nand help fight Yolara's armies--and they say they look not lightly on\r\nthat help. Or choice to go--and if so be you choose the latter, then\r\nwill they show another way that leads into your world!\"\r\n\r\nA flush had crept over the O'Keefe's face as she was speaking.  He\r\ntook her hands and looked long into the golden eyes; glancing up I saw\r\nthe Trinity were watching them intently--imperturbably.\r\n\r\n\"What do you say, _mavourneen_?\" asked Larry gently.  The handmaiden\r\nhung her head; trembled.\r\n\r\n\"Your words shall be mine, O one I love,\" she whispered. \"So going or\r\nstaying, I am beside you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, Goodwin?\" he turned to me.  I shrugged my shoulders--after\r\nall I had no one to care.\r\n\r\n\"It's up to you, Larry,\" I remarked, deliberately choosing his own\r\nphraseology.\r\n\r\nThe O'Keefe straightened, squared his shoulders, gazed straight into\r\nthe flame-flickering eyes.\r\n\r\n\"We stick!\" he said briefly.\r\n\r\nShamefacedly I recall now that at the time I thought this\r\ncolloquialism not only irreverent, but in somewhat bad taste. I am\r\nglad to say I was alone in that bit of weakness. The face that Lakla\r\nturned to Larry was radiant with love, and although the shamed hope\r\nhad vanished from the sweet eyes, they were shining with adoring\r\npride. And the marble visages of the Three softened, and the little\r\nflames died down.\r\n\r\n\"Wait,\" said Lakla, \"there is one other thing they say we must answer\r\nbefore they will hold us to that promise--wait--\"\r\n\r\nShe listened, and then her face grew white--white as those of the\r\nThree themselves; the glorious eyes widened, stark terror filling\r\nthem; the whole lithe body of her shook like a reed in the wind.\r\n\r\n\"Not that!\" she cried out to the Three.  \"Oh, not that!  Not\r\nLarry--let me go even as you will--but not him!\" She threw up frantic\r\nhands to the woman-being of the Trinity. \"Let _me_ bear it alone,\" she\r\nwailed. \"Alone--mother! Mother!\"\r\n\r\nThe Three bent their heads toward her, their faces pitiful, and from\r\nthe eyes of the woman One rolled--tears! Larry leaped to Lakla's side.\r\n\r\n_\"Mavourneen!\"_ he cried.  \"Sweetheart, what have they said to you?\"\r\n\r\nHe glared up at the Silent Ones, his hand twitching toward the\r\nhigh-hung pistol holster.\r\n\r\nThe handmaiden swung to him; threw white arms around his neck; held\r\nher head upon his heart until her sobbing ceased.\r\n\r\n\"This they--say--the Silent Ones,\" she gasped and then all the courage\r\nof her came back. \"O heart of mine!\" she whispered to Larry, gazing\r\ndeep into his eyes, his anxious face cupped between her white palms.\r\n\"This they say--that should the Shining One come to succour Yolara and\r\nLugur, should it conquer its fear--and--do this--then is there but one\r\nway left to destroy it--and to save your world.\"\r\n\r\nShe swayed; he gripped her tightly.\r\n\r\n\"But one way--you and I must go--together--into its embrace!  Yea, we\r\nmust pass within it--loving each other, loving the world, realizing to\r\nthe full all that we sacrifice and sacrificing all, our love, our\r\nlives, perhaps even that you call soul, O loved one; must give\r\nourselves _all_ to the Shining One--gladly, freely, our love for each\r\nother flaming high within us--that this curse shall pass away! For if\r\nwe do this, pledge the Three, then shall that power of love we carry\r\ninto it weaken for a time all that evil which the Shining One has\r\nbecome--and in that time the Three can strike and slay!\"\r\n\r\nThe blood rushed from my heart; scientist that I am, essentially, my\r\nreason rejected any such solution as this of the activities of the\r\nDweller. Was it not, the thought flashed, a propitiation by the Three\r\nout of their own weakness--and as it flashed I looked up to see their\r\neyes, full of sorrow, on mine--and knew they read the thought. Then\r\ninto the whirling vortex of my mind came steadying reflections--of\r\nhistory changed by the power of hate, of passion, of ambition, and\r\nmost of all, by love. Was there not actual dynamic energy in these\r\nthings--was there not a Son of Man who hung upon a cross on Calvary?\r\n\r\n\"Dear love o' mine,\" said the O'Keefe quietly, \"is it in your heart to\r\nsay _yes_ to this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Larry,\" she spoke low, \"what is in your heart is in mine; but I did\r\nso want to go with you, to live with you--to--to bear you children,\r\nLarry--and to see the sun.\"\r\n\r\nMy eyes were wet; dimly through them I saw his gaze on me.\r\n\r\n\"If the world _is_ at stake,\" he whispered, \"why of course there's only\r\none thing to do. God knows I never was afraid when I was fighting up\r\nthere--and many a better man than me has gone West with shell and\r\nbullet for the same idea; but these things aren't shell and\r\nbullet--but I hadn't Lakla then--and it's the damned _doubt_ I have\r\nbehind it all.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned to the Three--and did I in their poise sense a rigidity, an\r\nanxiety that sat upon them as alienly as would divinity upon men?\r\n\r\n\"Tell me this, Silent Ones,\" he cried.  \"If we do this, Lakla and I,\r\nis it _sure_ you are that you can slay the--Thing, and save my world? Is\r\nit _sure_ you are?\"\r\n\r\nFor the first and the last time, I heard the voice of the Silent Ones.\r\nIt was the man-being at the right who spoke.\r\n\r\n\"We are sure,\" the tones rolled out like deepest organ notes, shaking,\r\nvibrating, assailing the ears as strangely as their appearance struck\r\nthe eyes. Another moment the O'Keefe stared at them. Once more he\r\nsquared his shoulders; lifted Lakla's chin and smiled into her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"We stick!\" he said again, nodding to the Three.\r\n\r\nOver the visages of the Trinity fell benignity that was--awesome; the\r\ntiny flames in the jet orbs vanished, leaving them wells in which\r\nbrimmed serenity, hope--an extraordinary joyfulness. The woman sat\r\nupright, tender gaze fixed upon the man and girl. Her great shoulders\r\nraised as though she had lifted her arms and had drawn to her those\r\nothers. The three faces pressed together for a fleeting moment; raised\r\nagain. The woman bent forward--and as she did so, Lakla and Larry, as\r\nthough drawn by some outer force, were swept upon the dais.\r\n\r\nOut from the sparkling mist stretched two hands, enormously long,\r\nsix-fingered, thumbless, a faint tracery of golden scales upon their\r\nwhite backs, utterly unhuman and still in some strange way beautiful,\r\nradiating power and--all womanly!\r\n\r\nThey stretched forth; they touched the bent heads of Lakla and the\r\nO'Keefe; caressed them, drew them together, softly stroked\r\nthem--lovingly, with more than a touch of benediction. And withdrew!\r\n\r\nThe sparkling mists rolled up once more, hiding the Silent Ones.  As\r\nsilently as once before we had gone we passed out of the place of\r\nlight, beyond the crimson stone, back to the handmaiden's chamber.\r\n\r\nOnly once on our way did Larry speak.\r\n\r\n\"Cheer up, darlin',\" he said to her, \"it's a long way yet before the\r\nfinish. An' are you thinking that Lugur and Yolara are going to pull\r\nthis thing off? Are you?\"\r\n\r\nThe handmaiden only looked at him, eyes love and sorrow filled.\r\n\r\n\"They are!\" said Larry.  \"They are!  Like HELL they are!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nThe Meeting of Titans\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention, nor is it possible no matter how interesting\r\nto me, to set down _ad seriatim_ the happenings of the next twelve\r\nhours. But a few will not be denied recital.\r\n\r\nO'Keefe regained cheerfulness.\r\n\r\n\"After all, Doc,\" he said to me, \"it's a beautiful scrap we're going\r\nto have. At the worst the worst is no more than the leprechaun warned\r\nabout. I would have told the Taitha De about the banshee raid he\r\npromised me; but I was a bit taken off my feet at the time. The old\r\ngirl an' all the clan'll be along, said the little green man, an' I\r\nbet the Three will be damned glad of it, take it from me.\"\r\n\r\nLakla, shining-eyed and half fearful too:\r\n\r\n\"I have other tidings that I am afraid will please you little,\r\nLarry--darlin'. The Silent Ones say that you must not go into battle\r\nyourself. You must stay here with me, and with Goodwin--for\r\nif--if--the Shining One does come, then must we be here to meet it.\r\nAnd you might not be, you know, Larry, if you fight,\" she said,\r\nlooking shyly up at him from under the long lashes.\r\n\r\nThe O'Keefe's jaw dropped.\r\n\r\n\"That's about the hardest yet,\" he answered slowly.  \"Still--I see\r\ntheir point; the lamb corralled for the altar has no right to stray\r\nout among the lions,\" he added grimly. \"Don't worry, sweet,\" he told\r\nher. \"As long as I've sat in the game I'll stick to the rules.\"\r\n\r\nOlaf took fierce joy in the coming fray. \"The Norns spin close to the\r\nend of this web,\" he rumbled. \"_Ja!_ And the threads of Lugur and the\r\nHeks woman are between their fingers for the breaking! Thor will be\r\nwith me, and I have fashioned me a hammer in glory of Thor.\" In his\r\nhand was an enormous mace of black metal, fully five feet long,\r\ncrowned with a massive head.\r\n\r\nI pass to the twelve hours' closing.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the _coria_ road where the giant fernland met the edge\r\nof the cavern's ruby floor, hundreds of the _Akka_ were stationed in\r\nambush, armed with their spears tipped with the rotting death and\r\ntheir nail-studded, metal-headed clubs. These were to attack when the\r\nMurians debauched from the _corials_. We had little hope of doing more\r\nhere than effect some attrition of Yolara's hosts, for at this place\r\nthe captains of the Shining One could wield the _Keth_ and their other\r\nuncanny weapons freely. We had learned, too, that every forge and\r\nartisan had been put to work to make an armour Marakinoff had devised\r\nto withstand the natural battle equipment of the frog-people--and both\r\nLarry and I had a disquieting faith in the Russian's ingenuity.\r\n\r\nAt any rate the numbers against us would be lessened.\r\n\r\nNext, under the direction of the frog-king, levies commanded by\r\nsubsidiary chieftains had completed rows of rough walls along the\r\nprobable route of the Murians through the cavern. These afforded the\r\n_Akka_ a fair protection behind which they could hurl their darts and\r\nspears--curiously enough they had never developed the bow as a weapon.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the cavern a strong barricade stretched almost to\r\nthe two ends of the crescent strand; almost, I say, because there had\r\nnot been time to build it entirely across the mouth.\r\n\r\nAnd from edge to edge of the titanic bridge, from where it sprang\r\noutward at the shore of the Crimson Sea to a hundred feet away from\r\nthe golden door of the abode, barrier after barrier was piled.\r\n\r\nBehind the wall defending the mouth of the cavern, waited other\r\nthousands of the _Akka_. At each end of the unfinished barricade they\r\nwere mustered thickly, and at right and left of the crescent where\r\ntheir forest began, more legions were assembled to make way up to the\r\nledge as opportunity offered.\r\n\r\nRank upon rank they manned the bridge barriers; they swarmed over the\r\npinnacles and in the hollows of the island's ragged outer lip; the\r\ndomed castle was a hive of them, if I may mix my metaphors--and the\r\nrocks and gardens that surrounded the abode glittered with them.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said the handmaiden, \"there's nothing else we can do--save\r\nwait.\"\r\n\r\nShe led us out through her bower and up the little path that ran to\r\nthe embrasure.\r\n\r\nThrough the quiet came a sound, a sighing, a half-mournful whispering\r\nthat beat about us and fled away.\r\n\r\n\"They come!\" cried Lakla, the light of battle in her eyes. Larry drew\r\nher to him, raised her in his arms, kissed her.\r\n\r\n\"A woman!\" acclaimed the O'Keefe.  \"A real woman--and mine!\"\r\n\r\nWith the cry of the Portal there was movement among the _Akka_, the\r\nglint of moving spears, flash of metal-tipped clubs, rattle of horny\r\nspurs, rumblings of battle-cries.\r\n\r\nAnd we waited--waited it seemed interminably, gaze fastened upon the\r\nlow wall across the cavern mouth. Suddenly I remembered the crystal\r\nthrough which I had peered when the hidden assassins had crept upon\r\nus. Mentioning it to Lakla, she gave a little cry of vexation, a\r\ncommand to her attendant; and not long that faithful if unusual lady\r\nhad returned with a tray of the glasses. Raising mine, I saw the lines\r\nfurthest away leap into sudden activity. Spurred warrior after warrior\r\nleaped upon the barricade and over it. Flashes of intense, green\r\nlight, mingled with gleams like lightning strokes of concentrated moon\r\nrays, sprang from behind the wall--sprang and struck and burned upon\r\nthe scales of the batrachians.\r\n\r\n\"They come!\" whispered Lakla.\r\n\r\nAt the far ends of the crescent a terrific milling had begun. Here it\r\nwas plain the _Akka_ were holding. Faintly, for the distance was\r\ngreat, I could see fresh force upon force rush up and take the places\r\nof those who had fallen.\r\n\r\nOver each of these ends, and along the whole line of the barricade a\r\nmist of dancing, diamonded atoms began to rise; sparking, coruscating\r\npoints of diamond dust that darted and danced.\r\n\r\nWhat had once been Lakla's guardians--dancing now in the nothingness!\r\n\r\n\"God, but it's hard to stay here like this!\" groaned the O'Keefe;\r\nOlaf's teeth were bared, the lips drawn back in such a fighting grin\r\nas his ancestors berserk on their raven ships must have borne; Rador\r\nwas livid with rage; the handmaiden's nostrils flaring wide, all her\r\nwrathful soul in her eyes.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, while we looked, the rocky wall which the _Akka_ had built\r\nat the cavern mouth--was not! It vanished, as though an unseen,\r\nunbelievably gigantic hand had with the lightning's speed swept it\r\naway. And with it vanished, too, long lines of the great amphibians\r\nclose behind it.\r\n\r\nThen down upon the ledge, dropping into the Crimson Sea, sending up\r\ngeysers of ruby spray, dashing on the bridge, crushing the frog-men,\r\nfell a shower of stone, mingled with distorted shapes and fragments\r\nwhose scales still flashed meteoric as they hurled from above.\r\n\r\n\"That which makes things fall upward,\" hissed Olaf. \"That which I saw\r\nin the garden of Lugur!\"\r\n\r\nThe fiendish agency of destruction which Marakinoff had revealed to\r\nLarry; the force that cut off gravitation and sent all things within\r\nits range racing outward into space!\r\n\r\nAnd now over the debris upon the ledge, striking with long sword and\r\ndaggers, here and there a captain flashing the green ray, moving on in\r\nordered squares, came the soldiers of the Shining One. Nearer and\r\nnearer the verge of the ledge they pushed Nak's warriors. Leaping upon\r\nthe dwarfs, smiting them with spear and club, with teeth and spur, the\r\n_Akka_ fought like devils. Quivering under the ray, they leaped and\r\ndragged down and slew.\r\n\r\nNow there was but one long line of the frog-men at the very edge of\r\nthe cliff.\r\n\r\nAnd ever the clouds of dancing, diamonded atoms grew thicker over them\r\nall!\r\n\r\nThat last thin line of the _Akka_ was going; yet they fought to the\r\nlast, and none toppled over the lip without at least one of the\r\narmoured Murians in his arms.\r\n\r\nMy gaze dropped to the foot of the cliffs.  Stretched along their\r\nlength was a wide ribbon of beauty--a shimmering multitude of\r\ngleaming, pulsing, prismatic moons; glowing, glowing ever brighter,\r\never more wondrous--the gigantic Medusae globes feasting on dwarf and\r\nfrog-man alike!\r\n\r\nAcross the waters, faintly, came a triumphant shouting from Lugur's\r\nand Yolara's men!\r\n\r\nWas the ruddy light of the place lessening, growing paler, changing to\r\na faint rose? There was an exclamation from Larry; something like hope\r\nrelaxed the drawn muscles of his face. He pointed to the aureate dome\r\nwherein sat the Three--and then I saw!\r\n\r\nOut of it, through the long transverse slit through which the Silent\r\nOnes kept their watch on cavern, bridge, and abyss, a torrent of the\r\nopalescent light was pouring. It cascaded like a waterfall, and as it\r\nflowed it spread whirling out, in columns and eddies, clouds and wisps\r\nof misty, curdled coruscations. It hung like a veil over all the\r\nislands, filtering everywhere, driving back the crimson light as\r\nthough possessed of impenetrable substance--and still it cast not the\r\nfaintest shadowing upon our vision.\r\n\r\n\"Good God!\" breathed Larry.  \"Look!\"\r\n\r\nThe radiance was marching--_marching_--down the colossal bridge. It\r\nmoved swiftly, in some unthinkable way _intelligently_. It swathed the\r\n_Akka_, and closer, ever closer it swept toward the approach upon\r\nwhich Yolara's men had now gained foothold.\r\n\r\nFrom their ranks came flash after flash of the green ray--aimed at\r\nthe abode! But as the light sped and struck the opalescence it was\r\nblotted out! The shimmering mists seemed to enfold, to dissipate it.\r\n\r\nLakla drew a deep breath.\r\n\r\n\"The Silent Ones forgive me for doubting them,\" she whispered; and\r\nagain hope blossomed on her face even as it did on Larry's.\r\n\r\nThe frog-men were gaining.  Clothed in the armour of that mist, they\r\npressed back from the bridge-head the invaders. There was another\r\nprodigious movement at the ends of the crescent, and racing up,\r\npressing against the dwarfs, came other legions of Nak's warriors. And\r\nre-enforcing those out on the prodigious arch, the frog-men stationed\r\nin the gardens below us poured back to the castle and out through the\r\nopen Portal.\r\n\r\n\"They're licked!\" shouted Larry.  \"They're--\"\r\n\r\nSo quickly I could not follow the movement his automatic leaped to his\r\nhand--spoke, once and again and again. Rador leaped to the head of the\r\nlittle path, sword in hand; Olaf, shouting and whirling his mace,\r\nfollowed. I strove to get my own gun quickly.\r\n\r\nFor up that path were running twoscore of Lugur's men, while from\r\nbelow Lugur's own voice roared.\r\n\r\n\"Quick!  Slay not the handmaiden or her lover!  Carry them down.\r\nQuick! But slay the others!\"\r\n\r\nThe handmaiden raced toward Larry, stopped, whistled shrilly--again\r\nand again. Larry's pistol was empty, but as the dwarfs rushed upon him\r\nI dropped two of them with mine. It jammed--I could not use it; I\r\nsprang to his side. Rador was down, struggling in a heap of Lugur's\r\nmen. Olaf, a Viking of old, was whirling his great hammer, and\r\nstriking, striking through armour, flesh, and bone.\r\n\r\nLarry was down, Lakla flew to him.  But the Norseman, now streaming\r\nblood from a dozen wounds, caught a glimpse of her coming, turned,\r\nthrust out a mighty hand, sent her reeling back, and then with his\r\nhammer cracked the skulls of those trying to drag the O'Keefe down the\r\npath.\r\n\r\nA cry from Lakla--the dwarfs had seized her, had lifted her despite\r\nher struggles, were carrying her away. One I dropped with the butt of\r\nmy useless pistol, and then went down myself under the rush of\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThrough the clamour I heard a booming of the _Akka_, closer, closer;\r\nthen through it the bellow of Lugur. I made a mighty effort, swung a\r\nhand up, and sunk my fingers in the throat of the soldier striving to\r\nkill me. Writhing over him, my fingers touched a poniard; I thrust it\r\ndeep, staggered to my feet.\r\n\r\nThe O'Keefe, shielding Lakla, was battling with a long sword against a\r\nhalf dozen of the soldiers. I started toward him, was struck, and\r\nunder the impact hurled to the ground. Dizzily I raised myself--and\r\nleaning upon my elbow, stared and moved no more. For the dwarfs lay\r\ndead, and Larry, holding Lakla tightly, was staring even as I, and\r\nranged at the head of the path were the _Akka_, whose booming advance\r\nin obedience to the handmaiden's call I had heard.\r\n\r\nAnd at what we all stared was Olaf, crimson with his wounds, and\r\nLugur, in blood-red armour, locked in each other's grip, struggling,\r\nsmiting, tearing, kicking, and swaying about the little space before\r\nthe embrasure. I crawled over toward the O'Keefe. He raised his\r\npistol, dropped it.\r\n\r\n\"Can't hit him without hitting Olaf,\" he whispered.  Lakla signalled\r\nthe frog-men; they advanced toward the two--but Olaf saw them, broke\r\nthe red dwarf's hold, sent Lugur reeling a dozen feet away.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" shouted the Norseman, the ice of his pale-blue eyes glinting\r\nlike frozen flames, blood streaming down his face and dripping from\r\nhis hands. \"No! Lugur is mine! None but me slays him! Ho, you Lugur--\"\r\nand cursed him and Yolara and the Dweller hideously--I cannot set\r\nthose curses down here.\r\n\r\nThey spurred Lugur.  Mad now as the Norseman, the red dwarf sprang.\r\nOlaf struck a blow that would have killed an ordinary man, but Lugur\r\nonly grunted, swept in, and seized him about the waist; one mighty arm\r\nbegan to creep up toward Huldricksson's throat.\r\n\r\n\"'Ware, Olaf!\" cried O'Keefe; but Olaf did not answer. He waited until\r\nthe red dwarf's hand was close to his shoulder; and then, with an\r\nincredibly rapid movement--once before had I seen something like it\r\nin a wrestling match between Papuans--he had twisted Lugur around;\r\ntwisted him so that Olaf's right arm lay across the tremendous breast,\r\nthe left behind the neck, and Olaf's left leg held the Voice's\r\narmoured thighs viselike against his right knee while over that knee\r\nlay the small of the red dwarf's back.\r\n\r\nFor a second or two the Norseman looked down upon his enemy,\r\nmotionless in that paralyzing grip. And then--slowly--he began to\r\nbreak him!\r\n\r\nLakla gave a little cry; made a motion toward the two. But Larry drew\r\nher head down against his breast, hiding her eyes; then fastened his\r\nown upon the pair, white-faced, stern.\r\n\r\nSlowly, ever so slowly, proceeded Olaf.  Twice Lugur moaned.  At the\r\nend he screamed--horribly. There was a cracking sound, as of a stout\r\nstick snapped.\r\n\r\nHuldricksson stooped, silently.  He picked up the limp body of the\r\nVoice, not yet dead, for the eyes rolled, the lips strove to speak;\r\nlifted it, walked to the parapet, swung it twice over his head, and\r\ncast it down to the red waters!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nThe Coming of the Shining One\r\n\r\nThe Norseman turned toward us.  There was now no madness in his eyes;\r\nonly a great weariness. And there was peace on the once tortured face.\r\n\r\n\"Helma,\" he whispered, \"I go a little before!  Soon you will come to\r\nme--to me and the Yndling who will await you--Helma, _meine liebe!_\"\r\n\r\nBlood gushed from his mouth; he swayed, fell.  And thus died Olaf\r\nHuldricksson.\r\n\r\nWe looked down upon him; nor did Lakla, nor Larry, nor I try to hide\r\nour tears. And as we stood the _Akka_ brought to us that other mighty\r\nfighter, Rador; but in him there was life, and we attended to him\r\nthere as best we could.\r\n\r\nThen Lakla spoke.\r\n\r\n\"We will bear him into the castle where we may give him greater care,\"\r\nshe said. \"For, lo! the hosts of Yolara have been beaten back; and on\r\nthe bridge comes Nak with tidings.\"\r\n\r\nWe looked over the parapet.  It was even as she had said. Neither on\r\nledge nor bridge was there trace of living men of Muria--only heaps of\r\nslain that lay everywhere--and thick against the cavern mouth still\r\ndanced the flashing atoms of those the green ray had destroyed.\r\n\r\n\"Over!\" exclaimed Larry incredulously.  \"We live then--heart of\r\nmine!\"\r\n\r\n\"The Silent Ones recall their veils,\" she said, pointing to the dome.\r\nBack through the slitted opening the radiance was streaming;\r\nwithdrawing from sea and island; marching back over the bridge with\r\nthat same ordered, intelligent motion. Behind it the red light\r\npressed, like skirmishers on the heels of a retreating army.\r\n\r\n\"And yet--\" faltered the handmaiden as we passed into her chamber, and\r\ndoubtful were the eyes she turned upon the O'Keefe.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe,\" he said, \"there's a kick left in them--\"\r\n\r\nWhat was that sound beating into the chamber faintly, so faintly?  My\r\nheart gave a great throb and seemed to stop for an eternity. What was\r\nit--coming nearer, ever nearer? Now Lakla and O'Keefe heard it, life\r\nebbing from lips and cheeks.\r\n\r\nNearer, nearer--a music as of myriads of tiny crystal bells, tinkling,\r\ntinkling--a storm of pizzicati upon violins of glass! Nearer,\r\nnearer--not sweetly now, nor luring; no--raging, wrathful, sinister\r\nbeyond words; sweeping on; nearer--\r\n\r\nThe Dweller!  The Shining One!\r\n\r\nWe leaped to the narrow window; peered out, aghast.  The bell notes\r\nswept through and about us, a hurricane. The crescent strand was once\r\nmore a ferment. Back, back were the _Akka_ being swept, as though by\r\nbrooms, tottering on the edge of the ledge, falling into the waters.\r\nSwiftly they were finished; and where they had fought was an eddying\r\nthrong clothed in tatters or naked, swaying, drifting, arms\r\ntossing--like marionettes of Satan.\r\n\r\nThe dead-alive!  The slaves of the Dweller!\r\n\r\nThey swayed and tossed, and then, like water racing through an opened\r\ndam, they swept upon the bridge-head. On and on they pushed, like the\r\nbore of a mighty tide. The frog-men strove against them, clubbing,\r\nspearing, tearing them. But even those worst smitten seemed not to\r\nfall. On they pushed, driving forward, irresistible--a battering ram\r\nof flesh and bone. They clove the masses of the _Akka_, pressing them\r\nto the sides of the bridge and over. Through the open gates they\r\nforced them--for there was no room for the frog-men to stand against\r\nthat implacable tide.\r\n\r\nThen those of the _Akka_ who were left turned their backs and ran.  We\r\nheard the clang of the golden wings of the portal, and none too soon\r\nto keep out the first of the Dweller's dreadful hordes.\r\n\r\nNow upon the cavern ledge and over the whole length of the bridge\r\nthere were none but the dead-alive, men and women, black-polled\r\n_ladala_, sloe-eyed Malays, slant-eyed Chinese, men of every race that\r\nsailed the seas--milling, turning, swaying, like leaves caught in a\r\nsluggish current.\r\n\r\nThe bell notes became sharper, more insistent.  At the cavern mouth a\r\nradiance began to grow--a gleaming from which the atoms of diamond\r\ndust seemed to try to flee. As the radiance grew and the crystal notes\r\nrang nearer, every head of that hideous multitude turned stiffly,\r\nslowly toward the right, looking toward the far bridge end; their eyes\r\nfixed and glaring; every face an inhuman mask of rapture and of\r\nhorror!\r\n\r\nA movement shook them.  Those in the centre began to stream back,\r\nfaster and ever faster, leaving motionless deep ranks on each side.\r\nBack they flowed until from golden doors to cavern mouth a wide lane\r\nstretched, walled on each side by the dead-alive.\r\n\r\nThe far radiance became brighter; it gathered itself at the end of the\r\ndreadful lane; it was shot with sparklings and with pulsings of\r\npolychromatic light. The crystal storm was intolerable, piercing the\r\nears with countless tiny lances; brighter still the radiance.\r\n\r\nFrom the cavern swirled the Shining One!\r\n\r\nThe Dweller paused, seemed to scan the island of the Silent Ones half\r\ndoubtfully; then slowly, stately, it drifted out upon the bridge.\r\nCloser it drew; behind it glided Yolara at the head of a company of\r\nher dwarfs, and at her side was the hag of the Council whose face was\r\nthe withered, shattered echo of her own.\r\n\r\nSlower grew the Dweller's pace as it drew nearer.  Did I sense in it a\r\ndoubt, an uncertainty? The crystal-tongued, unseen choristers that\r\naccompanied it subtly seemed to reflect the doubt; their notes were\r\nnot sure, no longer insistent; rather was there in them an undertone\r\nof hesitancy, of warning! Yet on came the Shining One until it stood\r\nplain beneath us, searching with those eyes that thrust from and\r\nwithdrew into unknown spheres, the golden gateway, the cliff face, the\r\ncastle's rounded bulk--and more intently than any of these, the dome\r\nwherein sat the Three.\r\n\r\nBehind it each face of the dead-alive turned toward it, and those\r\nbeside it throbbed and gleamed with its luminescence.\r\n\r\nYolara crept close, just beyond the reach of its spirals. She\r\nmurmured--and the Dweller bent toward her, its seven globes steady in\r\ntheir shining mists, as though listening. It drew erect once more,\r\nresumed its doubtful scrutiny. Yolara's face darkened; she turned\r\nabruptly, spoke to a captain of her guards. A dwarf raced back between\r\nthe palisades of dead-alive.\r\n\r\nNow the priestess cried out, her voice ringing like a silver clarion.\r\n\r\n\"Ye are done, ye Three!  The Shining One stands at your door,\r\ndemanding entrance. Your beasts are slain and your power is gone. Who\r\nare ye, says the Shining One, to deny it entrance to the place of its\r\nbirth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye do not answer,\" she cried again, \"yet know we that ye hear!  The\r\nShining One offers these terms: Send forth your handmaiden and that\r\nlying stranger she stole; send them forth to us--and perhaps ye may\r\nlive. But if ye send them not forth, then shall ye too die--and soon!\"\r\n\r\nWe waited, silent, even as did Yolara--and again there was no answer\r\nfrom the Three.\r\n\r\nThe priestess laughed; the blue eyes flashed.\r\n\r\n\"It is ended!\" she cried.  \"If you will not open, needs must we open\r\nfor you!\"\r\n\r\nOver the bridge was marching a long double file of the dwarfs.  They\r\nbore a smoothed and handled tree-trunk whose head was knobbed with a\r\nhuge ball of metal. Past the priestess, past the Shining One, they\r\ncarried it; fifty of them to each side of the ram; and behind them\r\nstepped--Marakinoff!\r\n\r\nLarry awoke to life.\r\n\r\n\"Now, thank God,\" he rasped, \"I can get that devil, anyway!\"\r\n\r\nHe drew his pistol, took careful aim.  Even as he pressed the trigger\r\nthere rang through the abode a tremendous clanging. The ram was\r\nbattering at the gates. O'Keefe's bullet went wild. The Russian must\r\nhave heard the shot; perhaps the missile was closer than we knew. He\r\nmade a swift leap behind the guards; was lost to sight.\r\n\r\nOnce more the thunderous clanging rang through the castle.\r\n\r\nLakla drew herself erect; down upon her dropped the listening\r\naloofness. Gravely she bowed her head.\r\n\r\n\"It is time, O love of mine.\" She turned to O'Keefe.  \"The Silent Ones\r\nsay that the way of fear is closed, but the way of love is open. They\r\ncall upon us to redeem our promise!\"\r\n\r\nFor a hundred heart-beats they clung to each other, breast to breast\r\nand lip to lip. Below, the clangour was increasing, the great trunk\r\nswinging harder and faster upon the metal gates. Now Lakla gently\r\nloosed the arms of the O'Keefe, and for another instant those two\r\nlooked into each other's souls. The handmaiden smiled tremulously.\r\n\r\n\"I would it might have been otherwise, Larry darlin',\" she whispered.\r\n\"But at least--we pass together, dearest of mine!\"\r\n\r\nShe leaped to the window.\r\n\r\n\"Yolara!\" the golden voice rang out sweetly.  The clanging ceased.\r\n\"Draw back your men. We open the Portal and come forth to you and the\r\nShining One--Larry and I.\"\r\n\r\nThe priestess's silver chimes of laughter rang out, cruel, mocking.\r\n\r\n\"Come, then, quickly,\" she jeered.  \"For surely both the Shining One\r\nand I yearn for you!\" Her malice-laden laughter chimed high once more.\r\n\"Keep us not lonely long!\" the priestess mocked.\r\n\r\nLarry drew a deep breath, stretched both hands out to me.\r\n\r\n\"It's good-by, I guess, Doc.\" His voice was strained. \"Good-by and\r\ngood luck, old boy. If you get out, and you _will_, let the old\r\n_Dolphin_ know I'm gone. And carry on, pal--and always remember the\r\nO'Keefe loved you like a brother.\"\r\n\r\nI squeezed his hands desperately.  Then out of my balanceshaking woe a\r\nstrange comfort was born.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe it's not good-by, Larry!\" I cried.  \"The banshee has not\r\ncried!\"\r\n\r\nA flash of hope passed over his face; the old reckless grin shone\r\nforth.\r\n\r\n\"It's so!\" he said.  \"By the Lord, it's so!\"\r\n\r\nThen Lakla bent toward me, and for the second time--kissed me.\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" she said to Larry.  Hand in hand they moved away, into the\r\ncorridor that led to the door outside of which waited the Shining One\r\nand its priestess.\r\n\r\nAnd unseen by them, wrapped as they were within their love and\r\nsacrifice, I crept softly behind. For I had determined that if enter\r\nthe Dweller's embrace they must, they should not go alone.\r\n\r\nThey paused before the Golden Portals; the handmaiden pressed its\r\nopening lever; the massive leaves rolled back.\r\n\r\nHeads high, proudly, serenely, they passed through and out upon the\r\nhither span. I followed.\r\n\r\nOn each side of us stood the Dweller's slaves, faces turned rigidly\r\ntoward their master. A hundred feet away the Shining One pulsed and\r\nspiralled in its evilly glorious lambency of sparkling plumes.\r\n\r\nUnhesitating, always with that same high serenity, Lakla and the\r\nO'Keefe, hands clasped like little children, drew closer to that\r\nwondrous shape. I could not see their faces, but I saw awe fall upon\r\nthose of the watching dwarfs, and into the burning eyes of Yolara\r\ncrept a doubt. Closer they drew to the Dweller, and closer, I\r\nfollowing them step by step. The Shining One's whirling lessened; its\r\ntinklings were faint, almost stilled. It seemed to watch them\r\napprehensively. A silence fell upon us all, a thick silence, brooding,\r\nominous, palpable. Now the pair were face to face with the child of\r\nthe Three--so near that with one of its misty tentacles it could have\r\nenfolded them.\r\n\r\nAnd the Shining One drew back!\r\n\r\nYes, drew back--and back with it stepped Yolara, the doubt in her eyes\r\ndeepening. Onward paced the handmaiden and the O'Keefe--and step by\r\nstep, as they advanced, the Dweller withdrew; its bell notes chiming\r\nout, puzzled questioning--half fearful!\r\n\r\nAnd back it drew, and back until it had reached the very centre of\r\nthat platform over the abyss in whose depths pulsed the green fires of\r\nearth heart. And there Yolara gripped herself; the hell that seethed\r\nwithin her soul leaped out of her eyes, a cry, a shriek of rage, tore\r\nfrom her lips.\r\n\r\nAs at a signal, the Shining One flamed high; its spirals and eddying\r\nmists swirled madly, the pulsing core of it blazed radiance. A score\r\nof coruscating tentacles swept straight upon the pair who stood\r\nintrepid, unresisting, awaiting its embrace. And upon me, lurking\r\nbehind them.\r\n\r\nThrough me swept a mighty exaltation.  It was the end then--and I was\r\nto meet it with them.\r\n\r\nSomething drew us back, back with an incredible swiftness, and yet as\r\ngently as a summer breeze sweeps a bit of thistle-down! Drew us back\r\nfrom those darting misty arms even as they were a hair-breadth from\r\nus! I heard the Dweller's bell notes burst out ragingly! I heard\r\nYolara scream.\r\n\r\nWhat was that?\r\n\r\nBetween the three of us and them was a ring of curdled moon flames,\r\nswirling about the Shining One and its priestess, pressing in upon\r\nthem, enfolding them!\r\n\r\nAnd within it I glimpsed the faces of the Three--implacable,\r\nsorrowful, filled with a supernal power!\r\n\r\nSparks and flashes of white flame darted from the ring, penetrating\r\nthe radiant swathings of the Dweller, striking through its pulsing\r\nnucleus, piercing its seven crowning orbs.\r\n\r\nNow the Shining One's radiance began to dim, the seven orbs to dull;\r\nthe tiny sparkling filaments that ran from them down into the\r\nDweller's body snapped, vanished! Through the battling nebulosities\r\nYolara's face swam forth--horror-filled, distorted, inhuman!\r\n\r\nThe ranks of the dead-alive quivered, moved, writhed, as though each\r\nfelt the torment of the Thing that had enslaved them. The radiance\r\nthat the Three wielded grew more intense, thicker, seemed to expand.\r\nWithin it, suddenly, were scores of flaming triangles--scores of eyes\r\nlike those of the Silent Ones!\r\n\r\nAnd the Shining One's seven little moons of amber, of silver, of blue\r\nand amethyst and green, of rose and white, split, shattered, were\r\ngone! Abruptly the tortured crystal chimings ceased.\r\n\r\nDulled, all its soul-shaking beauty dead, blotched and shadowed\r\nsqualidly, its gleaming plumes tarnished, its dancing spirals stripped\r\nfrom it, that which had been the Shining One wrapped itself about\r\nYolara--wrapped and drew her into itself; writhed, swayed, and hurled\r\nitself over the edge of the bridge--down, down into the green fires of\r\nthe unfathomable abyss--with its priestess still enfolded in its\r\ncoils!\r\n\r\nFrom the dwarfs who had watched that terror came screams of panic\r\nfear. They turned and ran, racing frantically over the bridge toward\r\nthe cavern mouth.\r\n\r\nThe serried ranks of the dead-alive trembled, shook.  Then from their\r\nfaces tied the horror of wedded ecstasy and anguish. Peace, utter\r\npeace, followed in its wake.\r\n\r\nAnd as fields of wheat are bent and fall beneath the wind, they fell.\r\nNo longer dead-alive, now all of the blessed dead, freed from their\r\ndreadful slavery!\r\n\r\nAbruptly from the sparkling mists the cloud of eyes was gone.  Faintly\r\nrevealed in them were only the heads of the Silent Ones. And they drew\r\nbefore us; were before us! No flames now in their ebon eyes--for the\r\nflickering fires were quenched in great tears, streaming down the\r\nmarble white faces. They bent toward us, over us; their radiance\r\nenfolded us. My eyes darkened. I could not see. I felt a tender hand\r\nupon my head--and panic and frozen dread and nightmare web that held\r\nme fled.\r\n\r\nThen they, too, were gone.\r\n\r\nUpon Larry's breast the handmaiden was sobbing--sobbing out her\r\nheart--but this time with the joy of one who is swept up from the\r\nvery threshold of hell into paradise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n\"Larry--Farewell!\"\r\n\r\n\"My heart, Larry--\" It was the handmaiden's murmur. \"My heart feels\r\nlike a bird that is flying from a nest of sorrow.\"\r\n\r\nWe were pacing down the length of the bridge, guards of the _Akka_\r\nbeside us, others following with those companies of _ladala_ that had\r\nrushed to aid us; in front of us the bandaged Rador swung gently\r\nwithin a litter; beside him, in another, lay Nak, the frog-king--much\r\nless of him than there had been before the battle began, but living.\r\n\r\nHours had passed since the terror I have just related.  My first task\r\nhad been to search for Throckmartin and his wife among the fallen\r\nmultitudes strewn thick as autumn leaves along the flying arch of\r\nstone, over the cavern ledge, and back, back as far as the eye could\r\nreach.\r\n\r\nAt last, Lakla and Larry helping, we found them.  They lay close to\r\nthe bridge-end, not parted--locked tight in each other's arms, pallid\r\nface to face, her hair streaming over his breast! As though when that\r\nunearthly life the Dweller had set within them passed away, their own\r\nhad come back for one fleeting instant--and they had known each other,\r\nand clasped before kindly death had taken them.\r\n\r\n\"Love is stronger than all things.\" The handmaiden was weeping softly.\r\n\"Love never left them. Love was stronger than the Shining One. And\r\nwhen its evil fled, love went with them--wherever souls go.\"\r\n\r\nOf Stanton and Thora there was no trace; nor, after our discovery of\r\nthose other two, did I care to look more. They were dead--and they\r\nwere free.\r\n\r\nWe buried Throckmartin and Edith beside Olaf in Lakla's bower.  But\r\nbefore the body of my old friend was placed within the grave I gave it\r\na careful and sorrowful examination. The skin was firm and smooth, but\r\ncold; not the cold of death, but with a chill that set my touching\r\nfingers tingling unpleasantly. The body was bloodless; the course of\r\nveins and arteries marked by faintly indented white furrows, as though\r\ntheir walls had long collapsed. Lips, mouth, even the tongue, was\r\npaper white. There was no sign of dissolution as we know it; no shadow\r\nor stain upon the marble surface. Whatever the force that, streaming\r\nfrom the Dweller or impregnating its lair, had energized the\r\ndead-alive, it was barrier against putrescence of any kind; that at\r\nleast was certain.\r\n\r\nBut it was not barrier against the poison of the Medusae, for, our sad\r\ntask done, and looking down upon the waters, I saw the pale forms of\r\nthe Dweller's hordes dissolving, vanishing into the shifting glories\r\nof the gigantic moons sailing down upon them from every quarter of the\r\nSea of Crimson.\r\n\r\nWhile the frog-men, those late levies from the farthest forests, were\r\nclearing bridge and ledge of cavern of the litter of the dead, we\r\nlistened to a leader of the _ladala_. They had risen, even as the\r\nmessenger had promised Rador. Fierce had been the struggle in the\r\ngardened city by the silver waters with those Lugur and Yolara had\r\nleft behind to garrison it. Deadly had been the slaughter of the\r\nfair-haired, reaping the harvest of hatred they had been sowing so\r\nlong. Not without a pang of regret did I think of the beautiful, gaily\r\nmalicious elfin women destroyed--evil though they may have been.\r\n\r\nThe ancient city of Lara was a charnel.  Of all the rulers not\r\ntwoscore had escaped, and these into regions of peril which to\r\ndescribe as sanctuary would be mockery. Nor had the _ladala_ fared so\r\nwell. Of all the men and women, for women as well as men had taken\r\ntheir part in the swift war, not more than a tenth remained alive.\r\n\r\nAnd the dancing motes of light in the silver air were thick,\r\nthick--they whispered.\r\n\r\nThey told us of the Shining One rushing through the Veil, cometlike,\r\nits hosts streaming behind it, raging with it, in ranks that seemed\r\ninterminable!\r\n\r\nOf the massacre of the priests and priestesses in the Cyclopean\r\ntemple; of the flashing forth of the summoning lights by unseen\r\nhands--followed by the tearing of the rainbow curtain, by colossal\r\nshatterings of the radiant cliffs; the vanishing behind their debris\r\nof all trace of entrance to the haunted place wherein the hordes of\r\nthe Shining One had slaved--the sealing of the lair!\r\n\r\nThen, when the tempest of hate had ended in seething Lara, how,\r\nthrilled with victory, armed with the weapons of those they had slain,\r\nthey had lifted the Shadow, passed through the Portal, met and\r\nslaughtered the fleeing remnants of Yolara's men--only to find the\r\ntempest stilled here, too.\r\n\r\nBut of Marakinoff they had seen nothing!  Had the Russian escaped, I\r\nwondered, or was he lying out there among the dead?\r\n\r\nBut now the _ladala_ were calling upon Lakla to come with them, to\r\ngovern them.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to, Larry darlin',\" she told him.  \"I want to go out\r\nwith you to Ireland. But for a time--I think the Three would have us\r\nremain and set that place in order.\"\r\n\r\nThe O'Keefe was bothered about something else than the government of\r\nMuria.\r\n\r\n\"If they've killed off all the priests, who's to marry us, heart of\r\nmine?\" he worried. \"None of those Siya and Siyana rites, no matter\r\nwhat,\" he added hastily.\r\n\r\n\"Marry!\" cried the handmaiden incredulously.  \"Marry us? Why, Larry\r\ndear, we _are_ married!\"\r\n\r\nThe O'Keefe's astonishment was complete; his jaw dropped; collapse\r\nseemed imminent.\r\n\r\n\"We are?\" he gasped.  \"When?\" he stammered fatuously.\r\n\r\n\"Why, when the Mother drew us together before her; when she put her\r\nhands on our heads after we had made the promise! Didn't you\r\nunderstand that?\" asked the handmaiden wonderingly.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, into the purity of the clear golden eyes, into the\r\npurity of the soul that gazed out of them; all his own great love\r\ntransfiguring his keen face.\r\n\r\n\"An' is that enough for you, _mavourneen_?\" he whispered humbly.\r\n\r\n\"Enough?\" The handmaiden's puzzlement was complete, profound.\r\n\"Enough? Larry darlin', what _more_ could we ask?\"\r\n\r\nHe drew a deep breath, clasped her close.\r\n\r\n\"Kiss the bride, Doc!\" cried the O'Keefe.  And for the third and,\r\nsoul's sorrow! the last time, Lakla dimpling and blushing, I thrilled\r\nto the touch of her soft, sweet lips.\r\n\r\nQuickly were our preparations for departure made.  Rador, conscious,\r\nhis immense vitality conquering fast his wounds, was to be borne ahead\r\nof us. And when all was done, Lakla, Larry, and I made our way up to\r\nthe scarlet stone that was the doorway to the chamber of the Three. We\r\nknew, of course, that they had gone, following, no doubt, those whose\r\neyes I had seen in the curdled mists, and who, coming to the aid of\r\nthe Three at last from whatever mysterious place that was their home,\r\nhad thrown their strength with them against the Shining One. Nor were\r\nwe wrong. When the great slab rolled away, no torrents of opalescence\r\ncame rushing out upon us. The vast dome was dim, tenantless; its\r\ncurved walls that had cascaded Light shone now but faintly; the dais\r\nwas empty; its wall of moon-flame radiance gone.\r\n\r\nA little time we stood, heads bent, reverent, our hearts filled with\r\ngratitude and love--yes, and with pity for that strange trinity so\r\nalien to us and yet so near; children even as we, though so unlike us,\r\nof our same Mother Earth.\r\n\r\nAnd what I wondered had been the secret of that promise they had wrung\r\nfrom their handmaiden and from Larry. And whence, if what the Three\r\nhad said had been all true--whence had come their power to avert the\r\nsacrifice at the very verge of its consummation?\r\n\r\n\"Love is stronger than all things!\" had said Lakla.\r\n\r\nWas it that they had needed, must have, the force which dwells within\r\nlove, within willing sacrifice, to strengthen their own power and to\r\nenable them to destroy the evil, glorious Thing so long shielded by\r\ntheir own love? Did the thought of sacrifice, the will toward\r\nabnegation, have to be as strong as the eternals, unshaken by faintest\r\nthrill of hope, before the Three could make of it their key to unlock\r\nthe Dweller's guard and strike through at its life?\r\n\r\nHere was a mystery--a mystery indeed!  Lakla softly closed the crimson\r\nstone. The mystery of the red dwarf's appearance was explained when we\r\ndiscovered a half-dozen of the water _coria_ moored in a small cove\r\nnot far from where the _Sekta_ flashed their heads of living bloom.\r\nThe dwarfs had borne the shallops with them, and from somewhere beyond\r\nthe cavern ledge had launched them unperceived; stealing up to the\r\nfarther side of the island and risking all in one bold stroke. Well,\r\nLugur, no matter what he held of wickedness, held also high courage.\r\n\r\nThe cavern was paved with the dead-alive, the _Akka_ carrying them out\r\nby the hundreds, casting them into the waters. Through the lane down\r\nwhich the Dweller had passed we went as quickly as we could, coming at\r\nlast to the space where the _coria_ waited. And not long after we\r\nswung past where the shadow had hung and hovered over the shining\r\ndepths of the Midnight Pool.\r\n\r\nUpon Lakla's insistence we passed on to the palace of Lugur, not to\r\nYolara's--I do not know why, but go there then she would not. And\r\nwithin one of its columned rooms, maidens of the black-haired folks,\r\nthe wistfulness, the fear, all gone from their sparkling eyes, served\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThere came to me a huge desire to see the destruction they had told us\r\nof the Dweller's lair; to observe for myself whether it was not\r\npossible to make a way of entrance and to study its mysteries.\r\n\r\nI spoke of this, and to my surprise both the handmaiden and the\r\nO'Keefe showed an almost embarrassed haste to acquiesce in my hesitant\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" cried Larry, \"there's lots of time before night!\"\r\n\r\nHe caught himself sheepishly; cast a glance at Lakla.\r\n\r\n\"I keep forgettin' there's no night here,\" he mumbled.\r\n\r\n\"What did you say, Larry?\" asked she.\r\n\r\n\"I said I wish we were sitting in our home in Ireland, watching the\r\nsun go down,\" he whispered to her. Vaguely I wondered why she blushed.\r\n\r\nBut now I must hasten.  We went to the temple, and here at least the\r\nghastly litter of the dead had been cleaned away. We passed through\r\nthe blue-caverned space, crossed the narrow arch that spanned the\r\nrushing sea stream, and, ascending, stood again upon the ivoried pave\r\nat the foot of the frowning, towering amphitheatre of jet.\r\n\r\nAcross the Silver Waters there was sign of neither Web of Rainbows nor\r\ncolossal pillars nor the templed lips that I had seen curving out\r\nbeneath the Veil when the Shining One had swirled out to greet its\r\npriestess and its voice and to dance with the sacrifices. There was\r\nbut a broken and rent mass of the radiant cliffs against whose base\r\nthe lake lapped.\r\n\r\nLong I looked--and turned away saddened.  Knowing even as I did what\r\nthe irised curtain had hidden, still it was as though some thing of\r\nsupernal beauty and wonder had been swept away, never to be replaced;\r\na glamour gone for ever; a work of the high gods destroyed.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go back,\" said Larry abruptly.\r\n\r\nI dropped a little behind them to examine a bit of carving--and,\r\nafter all, they did not want me. I watched them pacing slowly ahead,\r\nhis arm around her, black hair close to bronze-gold ringlets. Then I\r\nfollowed. Half were they over the bridge when through the roar of the\r\nimprisoned stream I heard my name called softly.\r\n\r\n\"Goodwin!  Dr. Goodwin!\"\r\n\r\nAmazed, I turned.  From behind the pedestal of a carved group\r\nslunk--Marakinoff! My premonition had been right. Some way he had\r\nescaped, slipped through to here. He held his hands high, came forward\r\ncautiously.\r\n\r\n\"I am finished,\" he whispered--\"Done!  I don't care what _they'll_ do\r\nto me.\" He nodded toward the handmaiden and Larry, now at the end of\r\nthe bridge and passing on, oblivious of all save each other. He drew\r\ncloser. His eyes were sunken, burning, mad; his face etched with deep\r\nlines, as though a graver's tool had cut down through it. I took a\r\nstep backward.\r\n\r\nA grin, like the grimace of a fiend, blasted the Russian's visage.\r\nHe threw himself upon me, his hands clenching at my throat!\r\n\r\n\"Larry!\" I yelled--and as I spun around under the shock of his\r\nonslaught, saw the two turn, stand paralyzed, then race toward me.\r\n\r\n\"But _you'll_ carry nothing out of here!\" shrieked Marakinoff.  \"No!\"\r\n\r\nMy foot, darting out behind me, touched vacancy.  The roaring of the\r\nracing stream deafened me. I felt its mists about me; threw myself\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nI was falling--falling--with the Russian's hand strangling me. I\r\nstruck water, sank; the hands that gripped my throat relaxed for a\r\nmoment their clutch. I strove to writhe loose; felt that I was being\r\nhurled with dreadful speed on--full realization came--on the breast of\r\nthat racing torrent dropping from some far ocean cleft and\r\nrushing--where? A little time, a few breathless instants, I struggled\r\nwith the devil who clutched me--inflexibly, indomitably.\r\n\r\nThen a shrieking as of all the pent winds of the universe in my\r\nears--blackness!\r\n\r\nConsciousness returned slowly, agonizedly.\r\n\r\n\"Larry!\" I groaned.  \"Lakla!\"\r\n\r\nA brilliant light was glowing through my closed lids.  It hurt.  I\r\nopened my eyes, closed them with swords and needles of dazzling pain\r\nshooting through them. Again I opened them cautiously. It was the sun!\r\n\r\nI staggered to my feet.  Behind me was a shattered wall of basalt\r\nmonoliths, hewn and squared. Before me was the Pacific, smooth and\r\nblue and smiling.\r\n\r\nAnd not far away, cast up on the strand even as I had been,\r\nwas--Marakinoff!\r\n\r\nHe lay there, broken and dead indeed.  Yet all the waters through\r\nwhich we had passed--not even the waters of death themselves--could\r\nwash from his face the grin of triumph. With the last of my strength I\r\ndragged the body from the strand and pushed it out into the waves. A\r\nlittle billow ran up, coiled about it, and carried it away, ducking\r\nand bending. Another seized it, and another, playing with it. It\r\nfloated from my sight--that which had been Marakinoff, with all his\r\nschemes to turn our fair world into an undreamed-of-hell.\r\n\r\nMy strength began to come back to me.  I found a thicket and slept;\r\nslept it must have been for many hours, for when I again awakened the\r\ndawn was rosing the east. I will not tell my sufferings. Suffice it to\r\nsay that I found a spring and some fruit, and just before dusk had\r\nrecovered enough to writhe up to the top of the wall and discover\r\nwhere I was.\r\n\r\nThe place was one of the farther islets of the Nan-Matal. To the north\r\nI caught the shadows of the ruins of Nan-Tauach, where was the moon\r\ndoor, black against the sky. Where was the moon door--which, someway,\r\nsomehow, I must reach, and quickly.\r\n\r\nAt dawn of the next day I got together driftwood and bound it together\r\nin shape of a rough raft with fallen creepers. Then, with a makeshift\r\npaddle, I set forth for Nan-Tauach. Slowly, painfully, I crept up to\r\nit. It was late afternoon before I grounded my shaky craft on the\r\nlittle beach between the ruined sea-gates and, creeping up the giant\r\nsteps, made my way to the inner enclosure.\r\n\r\nAnd at its opening I stopped, and the tears ran streaming down my\r\ncheeks while I wept aloud with sorrow and with disappointment and with\r\nweariness.\r\n\r\nFor the great wall in which had been set the pale slab whose threshold\r\nwe had crossed to the land of the Shining One lay shattered and\r\nbroken. The monoliths were heaped about; the wall had fallen, and\r\nabout them shone a film of water, half covering them.\r\n\r\nThere was no moon door!\r\n\r\nDazed and weeping, I drew closer, climbed upon their outlying\r\nfragments. I looked out only upon the sea. There had been a great\r\nsubsidence, an earth shock, perhaps, tilting downward all that\r\nside--the echo, little doubt, of that cataclysm which had blasted the\r\nDweller's lair!\r\n\r\nThe little squared islet called Tau, in which were hidden the seven\r\nglobes, had entirely disappeared. Upon the waters there was no trace\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nThe moon door was gone; the passage to the Moon Pool was closed to\r\nme--its chamber covered by the sea!\r\n\r\nThere was no road to Larry--nor to Lakla!\r\n\r\nAnd there, for me, the world ended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Transcriber's note: I have made the following changes to the text:\r\n\r\n  PAGE  LINE  ORIGINAL         CHANGED TO\r\n     3    14  sinster          sinister\r\n    17    11  Nam-Tauach       Nan-Tauach\r\n    22    20  on on            on\r\n    69    39  'Didn't          \"Didn't\r\n    75    21  'But             \"But\r\n    90    36  \"Trolde!\"        _\"Trolde!\"_\r\n    91    35  'We              \"We\r\n    96    11  shown            shone\r\n    96    14  smiled           smiled.\r\n   105    11  drank            drunk\r\n   106    24  acomplish        accomplish\r\n   109    23  'Shake           \"Shake\r\n   111    18  overtstressed    overstressed\r\n   116    11  increduously     incredulously\r\n   120    30  Yolar            Yolara\r\n   128    12  spirtual         spiritual\r\n   150    13  cushoned         cushioned\r\n   172    29  semed            seemed\r\n   204    34  there?\"'         there?\"\r\n   208    25  \"Its             \"It's\r\n   231     8  meal             metal\r\n   239     6  suling           sulting\r\n   248    28  finshed          finished\r\n   280    29  much             must",
