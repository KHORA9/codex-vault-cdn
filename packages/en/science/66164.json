Claims of superior excellence, which are entirely\r\nbaseless, are constantly made for certain food products in order to\r\ncall the attention of the public more directly to their value and,\r\nunfortunately, at times to mislead the public with respect to their\r\ntrue worth.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon to see foods advertised as of exceptional quality,\r\neither as a whole or for certain purposes. Many of the preparations of\r\nthis kind are of undoubted excellence, but fail to reach the superior\r\nstandard or perform the particular function which is attributed to\r\nthem. Particularly has it been noticed that foods are offered for\r\nspecific purposes or the nourishment of certain parts of the body,\r\nespecially of the brain and nerves. We are all familiar with the\r\nadvertisements of foods to feed the brain, or feed the nerves, or feed\r\nthe skin. It is hardly necessary to call attention to the absurdity of\r\nclaims of this kind. One part of the body cannot be nourished if the\r\nother parts are neglected, and the true principle of nutrition requires\r\na uniform and equal development and nourishment of all the tissues.\r\nIt is true that many of the tissues have predominant constituents.\r\nFor instance in the bones are found large quantities of phosphate of\r\ncalcium and in the muscles nitrogenous tissues dominate. In the brain\r\nand nerves there are considerable quantities of organic phosphorus.\r\nAll of these bodies, however, are contained in normal food properly\r\nbalanced.\r\n\r\nIt would be contrary to the principles of physiology to attempt to feed\r\nthe bones by consuming a large excess of phosphorus in the food or\r\nthe muscles by confining the food to a purely nitrogenous component.\r\nSuch attempts, instead of nourishing the tissues indicated, will so\r\nunbalance the rations as to disarrange the whole metabolic process, and\r\nthus injure and weaken the very tissues they are designed to support.\r\n\r\nIt seems, therefore, advisable to prepare a manual which may be used in\r\nconjunction with works on dietetics and on physiology and hygiene and\r\nyet of a character not especially designed for the expert.\r\n\r\nThe American public is now so well educated that any average citizen is\r\nfully capable of understanding scientific problems if presented to him\r\nin a non-technical garb.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, not difficult to see that the great army of\r\nmanufacturers and dealers in food products, as well as the still\r\ngreater army of consumers, are able to receive and to utilize\r\ninformation concerning food products which is of common interest\r\nto all. A dissemination of knowledge of this kind will guide the\r\nmanufacturer in his legitimate business and protect the public against\r\ndeceptions such as those mentioned above.\r\n\r\nIn the evolution of society, economy and efficiency indicate that\r\nspecializations should be made as completely as possible. For\r\nthis reason it is advisable that foods of a certain character be\r\nmanufactured and prepared for consumption on a large scale, so that due\r\neconomy and purity may be secured. On the other hand there are many\r\nother kinds of foods which, by reason of their properties, cannot be\r\nprepared on a large scale but must be produced near or at the place of\r\nconsumption. Milk is a type of this class of foods. It is altogether\r\nprobable, therefore, that the consumption of manufactured foods will\r\nnot decrease but increase even more rapidly than the number of our\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nIn order that the people may be able to judge of the quality and\r\ncharacter of products of this kind, information readily available\r\nappears to be highly desirable.\r\n\r\nIn the other case of the utilization of raw materials, it is equally\r\nimportant that the people of this country understand their nature and\r\ntheir functions in the digestive process. The great nutritive value of\r\nour food is found in the cereals, the meats, the fruits, and vegetables\r\nwhich we consume. A description of foods of this class, the places of\r\ntheir growth, the conditions under which they are matured and marketed,\r\nthe problems which relate to their storage and transportation,\r\ntheir composition in respect of nutrition and digestibility, the\r\ndangers which may accrue from their decay, and the adulterations or\r\nsophistications to which they may be subjected are matters of the\r\ngreatest public importance.\r\n\r\nA treatise of this kind in order to be of its full value for which it\r\nis intended must be concise, expressed in simple language, in a form\r\neasily consulted, and yet be of a character which will be reliable and\r\nwhich will give full information on the subject.\r\n\r\nIt is a common habit of speech to divide foods into two great classes,\r\nnamely, foods and beverages. This is not a scientific division, but\r\nis one which has been so well established by custom as to render it\r\nadvisable to divide this work into two portions, one devoted to food\r\nin the sense just used and the other to beverages. The first volume of\r\nthis work devoted to foods will treat of those bodies commonly known\r\nunder the term “foods,”--namely, cereals, meats of all kinds, milk,\r\nvegetables, nuts, and fruits. The second volume will embrace the study\r\nof beverages, namely, natural and artificial mineral waters, soda\r\nwaters, soft drinks, coffee, tea, cocoa, wines, cider, beer and other\r\nfermented beverages, distilled beverages of all kinds, and mixtures or\r\ncompounds thereof.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the description of the origin of foods and their\r\ngeneral characteristics will be given a statement of their chemical\r\ncomposition, especially in relation to nutritive properties. The\r\nprincipal adulterations or sophistications to which the food products\r\nare obnoxious will be briefly described, and where simple methods of\r\ndetecting adulterations are known, of a character to be applied without\r\nspecial chemical knowledge or skill, they will be given.\r\n\r\nAn attempt is thus made to lay before those interested, in as compact\r\na form as possible, the chief points connected with the production of\r\nfood, its manipulation, and its use for the nourishment of the body.\r\n\r\nIt is not the intention of this manual to enter at all into the subject\r\nof cooking or the physiology of foods and nutrition. That is a distinct\r\nand separate part of this problem and has already been treated in many\r\nmanuals. In this connection, however, attention may be called to the\r\ngreat importance of proper cooking in the use of food. Raw materials\r\nof the best character, prepared and transported in the most approved\r\nmanner, may be so injured in the kitchen in the process of cooking\r\nas to be rendered both unpalatable and difficult of digestion. On\r\nthe contrary, food materials of an inferior quality, provided they\r\ncontain no injurious substances, may be so treated by the skilled\r\ncook as to be both palatable and nutritious. The desirability of the\r\ndissemination of correct principles of cooking is no less than that of\r\ngiving information respecting the materials on which the art of cookery\r\nis exercised. It may be added that the art of cookery at the present\r\ntime should not be confined to the mere technical manipulation, the\r\napplication of heat and of condimental substances, but should also have\r\nsome reference to the actual process of nutrition.\r\n\r\nFoods should be prepared in the kitchen, not only of a palatable\r\ncharacter and properly spiced but also selected in such a manner as\r\nto safeguard one of the chief purposes of food, namely, the proper\r\nnutrition of the body and the avoidance of any injury to digestion.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly admitted that many, perhaps most, of the diseases of\r\nthe digestive tract to which the American people are so subject arise\r\nfrom the consumption of rations improperly balanced, poorly prepared,\r\nor used in great excess. To the intelligent and scientific cook the\r\ninformation contained in this manual will especially appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PROPER RATION.\r\n\r\nThe study of the science of nutrition has revealed the character of\r\nnourishment necessary to build the tissues and restore their waste.\r\nThe term “food” in its broadest signification includes all those\r\nsubstances which when taken into the body build tissues, restore\r\nwaste, furnish heat and energy, and provide appropriate condiments.\r\nThe building of tissues is especially an important function during the\r\nearly life of animals as it is through this building of tissues that\r\ngrowth takes place. The restoration of waste of tissues assumes special\r\nimportance during that period of life when the weight of the body is\r\nsupposed to be reasonably constant. At this time the waste of tissue in\r\nthe natural processes is restored by the assimilation of new material\r\nin the same proportion.\r\n\r\nIf the assimilation of new material goes on at a greater rate than the\r\nwaste of old material it manifests itself during the period of expected\r\nequilibrium in the deposition of adipose tissue and a consequent\r\nabnormal increase in weight.\r\n\r\nIn the after period of life the process of waste is naturally more\r\nvigorous than that of assimilation, and the tendency is manifested,\r\nwhich is wholly in harmony with the laws of Nature, to gradually\r\ndiminish the weight of the body, and this continues to the extreme\r\nemaciation of old age.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that the food consumed should be adapted to\r\nthese changing periods. The growing animal needs a larger quantity of\r\nfood in proportion to its actual weight than the animal which is in a\r\nstate of equilibrium, that is, of mature age, and the animal which is\r\nentering upon the period of old age needs a less quantity of food in\r\nproportion to its weight than in either of the other periods of life.\r\nThus, the rations of infants and children should be generous, the\r\nrations of mature man sufficient, and the rations of old age limited.\r\n\r\nThe food should also contain the various elements which enter into\r\nnutrition in the proper quantity. The nitrogenous constituents in food,\r\nwhen subjected to the ordinary process of digestion, yield a certain\r\nquantity of heat and energy but their more important function is to\r\nnourish the nitrogenous elements of the body, of which the muscles,\r\nhair, skin, and finger-nails are types. The mineral constituents\r\nof food, especially phosphorus and lime, have a general utility in\r\npromoting the metabolic functions, especially in the movement of the\r\nfluids of the body through the cell walls, and at the same time are\r\nactual nourishing materials, entering particularly into the composition\r\nof the bones and teeth.\r\n\r\nThe fats and oils which are present in the foods have the capacity of\r\nproducing large quantities of heat and energy during their combustion\r\nin the body, and thus serve as a source of animal heat and muscular\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nThe starches and sugars which are the most abundant elements of our\r\nfood, although they have a heat-forming power of less than one-half\r\nthat of fats, are largely utilized in the production of heat and energy\r\nand in the formation of animal fat.\r\n\r\nTo secure a proper and complete nutrition of the body it is desirable\r\nthat all these elements should be so adjusted as to provide for\r\ncomplete nourishment without having any one of them in great excess.\r\nIt is evident that an excess of any one or more of these nutrient\r\nmaterials must necessarily impose on the organs of the body an\r\nadditional work in securing their proper elimination. This tends to\r\noverburden the excretory organs and to cause a premature breakdown\r\nthereof. This giving away of the organs may not come for many years,\r\nnot, perhaps, until advanced life, but when it comes it necessarily\r\nshortens the period of human existence.\r\n\r\nThe term =“balanced ration”= means the adjustment of nutrients in the\r\nfood in such a way as to secure complete and perfect nutrition without\r\nloading the body with an excess of any one element. This is also an\r\nimportant point on the score of economy. A large percentage of all the\r\nearnings of man is expended for food products, and hence these products\r\nshould be used in a manner to secure the best results possible. If, by\r\na practice of scientific nutrition, 10 percent of the value of foods\r\ncould be saved it would create a fund which, could it be utilized,\r\nwould minister in the highest degree to the comfort and welfare of the\r\nhuman family and form an abundant pension for old age.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIAL FUNCTIONS OF FOOD.\r\n\r\nIn the above paragraphs attention has been directed particularly to the\r\nnutritive and economic properties of food. It must not be considered\r\nthat mere nutrition is the sole object of foods, especially for man.\r\nIt is the first object to be conserved in the feeding of domesticated\r\nanimals, but is only one of the objects to be kept in view in the\r\nfeeding of man. Man is a social animal and, from the earliest period of\r\nhis history, food has exercised a most important function in his social\r\nlife. Hence in the study of food and of its uses a failure to consider\r\nthis factor would be regrettable. For this reason it is justifiable in\r\nthe feeding of man to expend upon the mere social features of the meal\r\na sum which often is equal to or greater than that expended for the\r\nmere purpose of nutrition. This part of the subject, however, belongs\r\nespecially to the kitchen and dining room, and, therefore, will not be\r\ndiscussed at greater length at the present time.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that a more careful study of the food he consumes will\r\nbenefit man in many ways. It will lead to a wider public interest\r\nin the problem of the purity of food and the magnitude of the crime\r\ncommitted against mankind in the debasement, adulteration, and\r\nsophistication of food articles.\r\n\r\nThis study will impart to the social function of food an additional\r\ncharm, in that the origin and character of the material consumed will\r\nbe known and the properties which they possess for nourishing the body\r\nunderstood. This will enable man, as a social animal, to so conduct\r\nhimself at table as to secure the greatest possible pleasure and\r\nsocial benefit therefrom and at the same time avoid any injury which\r\nignorance might permit and invite.\r\n\r\nIt may appear that the inartistic treatment of a subject of this kind,\r\nas indicated in the following pages, is not one which is calculated to\r\nexcite any sympathetic interest or appeal to the natural desire for\r\nliterary and artistic expression. Yet the importance of the subject is\r\nso great as to warrant the experiment of presenting the matter in this\r\nform rather than in any more elaborate and connected way.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION AND COMPOSITION OF FOODS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Food=, in its general sense, is that which nourishes the body without\r\nregard to its physical state, that is, it may be solid, liquid, or\r\ngaseous. More particularly defined, food is that material taken into\r\nthe body in the ordinary process of eating which contains the elements\r\nnecessary for the growth of tissues, for the repair of the destruction\r\nto which the tissues are subjected during the ordinary vital processes\r\nand for furnishing heat and energy necessary to life. Incident to the\r\nutilization of these elements there is consumed, also, a considerable\r\nquantity of matter inextricably mingled with food in a natural way,\r\nwhich takes no direct part in nutrition and yet which is useful, as a\r\nmass, in promoting the digestive processes. These bodies are certain\r\nindigestible cellular tissues which are present in foods, mineral\r\nmatter, and other materials which are naturally found in food products.\r\nIncluded in this broad definition, therefore, are many substances\r\nwhich are usually not thought of in the sense of food; among these are\r\nwater and air. Air, however, would probably be excluded because it\r\nis not introduced into the stomach, that is, not in quantities which\r\nhave any significance in the vital processes. Water, on the contrary,\r\nis one of the most indispensable constituents of food and is also\r\nused in considerable quantities as a beverage. The water, itself, is\r\nindispensable to nutrition and is also one of those bodies mentioned\r\nabove which are necessary to secure the proper conduct of the digestive\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nBy means of the oxygen in the air the combustion of food in the\r\nvarious parts of the body is secured, and thus animal heat and energy\r\ndeveloped. In this respect the combustion of a food product is similar\r\nin every way to the burning of coal in the production of heat and\r\nmotion. The same calorific laws which govern the steam-engine are\r\napplicable, in all their rigidity, to the animal engine. The quantity\r\nof heat produced by the combustion of a certain amount of fat or sugar\r\nis definitely measured in a calorimeter and is found to correspond\r\nexactly to the quantity of heat produced by the ordinary combustion of\r\nsuch bodies. The term “food,” therefore, in this respect, would include\r\nthe oxygen of the air without which the development of animal heat and\r\nenergy would be impossible. It also includes those bodies of a liquid\r\ncharacter which are classed as beverages rather than as foods. All of\r\nthese bodies have nutritive properties, although their chief value is\r\ncondimental and social.\r\n\r\nThat large class of food products, also, which is known as condiments\r\nis properly termed food, since they not only possess nutritive\r\nproperties but through their condimental character promote digestion\r\nand by making the food more palatable secure to a higher degree the\r\nexcellence of its social function.\r\n\r\nIt is now possible to condense into a distinct expression the\r\ndefinition of food in the following language: Food in a general sense\r\nembraces those substances taken into the body which build tissues,\r\nrestore waste, and furnish heat and energy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF FOODS.\r\n\r\nFoods may be considered under different classifications. First, as to\r\ngeneral appearance and use three classes may be made,--foods, beverages\r\nand condiments. As types of the first division of these foods may be\r\nmentioned cereals and their preparations, meat and its preparations\r\n(except meat extracts), fish, fowl, and game. Beverages are those\r\nliquid food products which are more valued for their taste and flavor\r\nthan actual nutritive value. As types of beverages may be mentioned\r\nwines, beers, distilled spirits and liquors of all characters, tea,\r\ncoffee, cocoa, chocolate, etc. Under wines, in this sense, may be\r\nincluded the fermented beverages made of fruit juices, such as cider,\r\nperry, etc. Types of condiments are salt, pepper, spices, vinegar,\r\netc. Milk, although a liquid substance, is hardly to be considered\r\na beverage, and on account of its high nutritive properties may be\r\nclassed, together with its preparations, under the first head.\r\n\r\nFoods may also be classified as nitrogenous, starchy, oily, and\r\ncondimental. Nitrogenous foods are those in which the proportion of\r\ntheir material containing nitrogen is large. Lean meat may be regarded\r\nas a type of nitrogenous food, since it consists almost exclusively of\r\ntissues known as protein and contains nitrogen and sulfur as essential\r\ningredients. The white of an egg is also a typical nitrogenous food\r\nand, to a less extent, the yolk. Among vegetables, peas and beans are\r\ntypical foods containing large percentages of nitrogenous matter. The\r\ngluten of wheat is also a typical nitrogenous food and the zein of\r\nIndian corn, corresponding to gluten, is a nitrogenous material.\r\n\r\nPractically all the vegetables used as foods contain more or less\r\nprotein in their constituents. Among the cereals oats has the largest\r\nquantity and rice the smallest of this valuable food material.\r\nOf oily foods the fat of animals, including butter, is a typical\r\nrepresentative. All meats, fish, fowl, and game contain more or less\r\nfat. Of vegetables and fruits there are many which contain large\r\nquantities of fat, such as nuts, oily seeds, etc. All vegetables\r\ncontain more or less fat, although the succulent vegetables usually\r\ncontain but little thereof. Of starchy foods there are no types in\r\nanimal food, the quantity of carbohydrate material therein being\r\nextremely limited. The lobster and horse-flesh contain perhaps a little\r\nmore than 1 percent of carbohydrate food, but most meats contain much\r\nless than that. Sugar and starch are typical carbohydrate foods.\r\n\r\nThe cereal grains are composed largely of starchy foods, and so are\r\ncertain tubers, such as the potato, cassava, etc. Of the common cereals\r\nrice contains more starch than any other and oats the least. Sugars\r\nare intimately related to starch and are included under the term\r\nstarchy food or carbohydrate food. The carbohydrate matter in the flesh\r\nmentioned above, namely glycogen, is of the nature of a sugar. Among\r\nthe typical sugar foods are beets, melons, and fruits, some of which\r\ncontain large percentages of sugar. All fruits contain greater or less\r\nquantities of sugar, and that is true, also, of all vegetables.\r\n\r\nOf the plants which produce the sugar of commerce there may be\r\nmentioned the sugar-cane, the sugar-beet, the maple, and palm trees.\r\nThe principal sources of the sugar of commerce are the sugar-cane and\r\nthe sugar-beet.\r\n\r\nOf the condimental foods may be mentioned spices, including pepper,\r\nmustard, cinnamon, allspice, and other foods of this class. Common salt\r\noccupies a unique position in food products. It is the only mineral\r\nsubstance which has any value as a condiment in human food. But it also\r\nhas a more important function than its condimental character, namely,\r\nit furnishes the supply of hydrochloric acid without which digestion in\r\nthe stomach could not take place. For this reason common salt must be\r\nregarded as an essential food product as well as a condiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION OF CHEMICAL TERMS.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as this manual is not solely intended for expert chemists and\r\nphysiologists but also for the general public, a simple explanation of\r\nthe use of the terms used in analytical data and tables is advisable.\r\n\r\nUnder the term =moisture= is included all the water which is present\r\nin a free state, that is, not combined in any way with the ingredients\r\nof the material, and other substances volatile at the temperature of\r\ndrying. The water is determined by drying to a constant weight at the\r\ntemperature of boiling water or slightly above. In bodies which are\r\neasily oxidized this drying takes place in a vacuum or in an inert gas\r\nlike hydrogen or carbon dioxid.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Protein.=--Under this term is included all the nitrogenous compounds\r\nin a food product which contain in their composition sulfur, nitrogen,\r\ncarbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, forming that class of tissues\r\nrepresented by the gluten in wheat, the white of an egg, muscular and\r\ntendinous fibers, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ether Extract.=--Under this term is included the fats and oils, the\r\nterm fat being applied to animal fat and the term oil to vegetable\r\nproducts. These bodies are all soluble in ether and therefore are\r\ngrouped together under the term “ether extract.” There are some fats\r\nboth in animal and vegetable substances insoluble in ether, but they\r\nexist in minute quantities and therefore are not separated from the\r\nextracts, but the whole matter is given together and represents\r\npractically the fats and oils in food.\r\n\r\nThere are also minute quantities of bodies not fats in foods soluble in\r\nether, and these are included in the ether extract.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ash.=--The term ash is applied to the residue left after the burning\r\nof food products in the air at a low temperature until the carbon has\r\ndisappeared. Ash is rather an indefinite term and is applied to that\r\nresidual material of a mineral nature composed of sand or silica and\r\nthe carbonates or oxids of alkaline earth or alkalies. The ash also\r\ncontains the principal part of phosphorus present in food products and\r\nusually a small proportion of sulfur. These bodies in the ash exist as\r\nphosphoric and sulfuric acids or their salts.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fiber.=--The term fiber is applied to those carbohydrate products\r\nin food which are insoluble in solutions of dilute acid and dilute\r\nalkalies at the boiling temperature. Inasmuch as these separated bodies\r\nare not wholly pure cellulose they are often designated as crude fiber.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Starch and Sugar.=--The terms starch and sugar are applied to the\r\ncarbohydrates in a food product of a starchy or saccharine nature,\r\ntogether with the other carbohydrates present which are soluble in\r\ndilute acids and alkalies.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Calories.=--The term calorie is used to denote the amount of\r\nheat-forming material contained in one unit weight of a food product.\r\nThe number given represents the number of degrees of temperature\r\nproduced in a unit mass of water by the heat formed in burning the\r\nunit weight of food. The unit weights employed are usually as follows:\r\nOf the food product, one gram (15 grains); unit weight of water to be\r\nheated, one kilogram (2.2 pounds); unit increment of temperature, 1°C.\r\n(1.8°F.). The expression 4000 calories therefore means that if one gram\r\nof food substance in a dry state be burned the heat produced will raise\r\none gram of water through a temperature of 4000°C., or the unit of\r\nwater (one kilogram) through a temperature of 4°C. For convenience the\r\ncalories are usually expressed as small calories, namely 4000, instead\r\nof large calories, namely 4. In this manual the expression in terms of\r\nsmall calories, that is, the temperature increase of one kilogram of\r\nwater produced by burning one gram of substance, multiplied by 1000,\r\nwill be uniformly employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOODS AND THEIR ADULTERATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nMEATS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne great division of human food is meat. Technically, perhaps, the\r\nedible flesh of every animal used for human food might be described\r\nas meat. In this manual, however, preference is given to the common\r\nmeaning of the term.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of animals is by common consent divided into three principal\r\nclasses, namely, the flesh of terrestrial mammals, or animals not\r\nprovided with wings; second, aerial animals, or animals provided with\r\nwings, and, third, aquatic animals. A very common classification of\r\nthese three kinds of food is flesh, fowl, and fish. There are animals,\r\nthe flesh of which is eaten by many, which are not exactly included in\r\nthis classification; for instance, animals of an amphibious nature,\r\nliving partly on land and partly on sea. Also many of the animals\r\nclassed as aerial live chiefly upon the earth; although having wings\r\nthey do not use them, such as domesticated fowls. This classification,\r\nhowever, is sufficiently exact for the practical purposes of a food\r\nmanual and, therefore, under the head of meat is included the edible\r\nflesh of mammals living on the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Animals Whose Flesh is Edible.=--Probably the only complete\r\nclassification of this kind would be to include every animal living on\r\nthe face of the earth since, perhaps, the flesh of every animal living\r\nhas been more or less eaten by man. In a civilized community, however,\r\nexcept in times of disaster and dire necessity, certain classes of\r\nanimals only furnish the principal meat food. Nearly all the meat food\r\nconsumed in the United States is derived from cattle, sheep, and swine.\r\nGoat flesh is eaten only to a limited extent and horse meat scarcely at\r\nall, and the only other meats of importance are those of wild animals.\r\nThe principal wild animals used for food are the deer, bear, rabbit,\r\nand squirrel. Many other wild animals, however, are eaten and in some\r\ncases highly prized. In this manual only the principal meat foods both\r\nof domesticated and wild animals will be mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Classification of Meat Food as Respects Age.=--The edible flesh of\r\ndomesticated animals as well as of wild animals is eaten both in the\r\nyoung and full-grown state. Common names, however, designate these\r\ndifferent classes. For instance, veal in the growing and beef for the\r\nfull-grown animal, lamb for the young and mutton for the full-grown\r\nsheep, pig in the younger and pork in the full-grown swine, etc.\r\nThere is no legal limit of age for such a distinction, but as long\r\nas the animal is not fully grown it may be classified under the name\r\nrepresenting the young animal. There is a common understanding,\r\nhowever, that in the case of veal and lamb the animal must be under one\r\nyear of age and usually not under two nor more than eight months of\r\nage. A classification of this kind is so indefinite, however, that no\r\nstrict definition can be given other than that founded on the general\r\nprinciples above outlined.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Preparation of Animals.=--The proper sanitary conditions attending the\r\nfattening of animals intended for slaughter are of great importance\r\nto the consumer. It is a common understanding that animals intended\r\nfor slaughter should be plump and healthy. Poor animals, either those\r\nwhich are meager from lack of food or from disease, are to be rigidly\r\nexcluded from the slaughter pen. Animals intended for slaughter should\r\nbe fattened under sanitary conditions with plenty of fresh water and\r\nfresh air as well as good food. The stalls in which they are fattened\r\nshould be clean and well ventilated, and the sanitary conditions\r\nsurrounding them should be such as to exclude contagious and epidemic\r\ndiseases and provide the most favorable environment for growth and\r\npreparation for the market.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that all these conditions are to be secured by proper\r\ninspection of the animals while preparing for the market. The time\r\nwill, doubtless, soon arrive in this country when the supervision of\r\nthe preparation of animals for the market, the sanitary conditions\r\nunder which they live, and the general environment which surrounds\r\nthem shall be subjects of local, municipal, and state inspection.\r\nSince the power of the general government cannot extend to states\r\nand municipalities, these corporate bodies should take uniform and\r\nscientific action concerning all these matters. National and state\r\nconventions of municipal and state sanitary authorities should decide\r\nupon uniform systems of inspection and sanitation to which all state\r\nand municipal authorities must agree, so that a uniform and effective\r\nmethod of inspection and sanitation will be secured throughout the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWhen animals are transported before slaughter from one state to another\r\nthe national government is then entitled to inspect and certify\r\nrespecting the condition of the animal thus to be transported from\r\nstate to state. By thus combining municipal, state, and national\r\ninspection the rights of the consumer may be conserved, and this is the\r\nonly means by which they can be kept inviolate.\r\n\r\nIt is assumed, therefore, that the animal which has been brought for\r\nslaughter has been fattened under proper sanitary conditions, has not\r\nbeen exposed to epidemic or contagious diseases, and outwardly is not\r\nafflicted with any disease of its own. Such a healthy animal may then\r\nbe certified as fattened for slaughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Inspection after Slaughter.=--The inspection after slaughter is of the\r\nutmost importance, not even second to that of the proper inspection\r\nduring fattening and before slaughter. The veterinarian, skilled in\r\nhis science, can tell by the inspection of the vital organs of the\r\nslaughtered animal whether it is affected with any organic disease.\r\nAmong cattle the most frequent organic diseases are lumpy jaw and\r\ntuberculosis. In the case of swine one of the most common of diseases\r\nis trichinosis. In the latter case an inspection of the vital organs of\r\nthe animal is not sufficient. The muscles of the swine, first and most\r\ncommonly affected by trichinosis, must be examined microscopically in\r\norder to eliminate the possibility of the flesh of such animals going\r\ninto commerce untagged or unnoticed.\r\n\r\nIf the flesh of the swine impregnated with trichinosis be thoroughly\r\ncooked practically all of the danger to man is eliminated. The\r\nconsumer, however, should not be subjected to the chance of imperfect\r\ncooking. A swine affected with trichinosis should either be refused\r\nadmission into consumption or should be so tagged that the consumer\r\nshould know the danger to which he is exposed in order to take the\r\nnecessary precaution to safeguard his health.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tuberculosis.=--There is a difference of opinion among veterinary and\r\nhygienic experts respecting the disposition which is to be made of\r\ncarcasses affected with tuberculosis. It is claimed by some that if\r\nthe tuberculosis is local, that is, does not extend beyond the lungs,\r\nthere is no reason why the flesh of the animal should be refused to\r\nthe consumer. The basis of this contention is founded upon the opinion\r\nof some of the most eminent veterinarians that bovine tuberculosis\r\nand human tuberculosis are entirely distinct diseases and cannot be\r\ntransmitted either from the cow to man or vice versâ. It is not the\r\nprovince of this manual to decide this controversy, although it is\r\nonly right that the consumer should be given the benefit of the doubt.\r\nTherefore, if the carcass of an animal affected with local tuberculosis\r\nis to be passed into consumption it should be plainly marked as the\r\nflesh of a tuberculosed animal,--not only the carcass as a whole, but\r\nevery piece thereof that is introduced into consumption directly or\r\nafter canning or mincing. The consumer is thus left free to choose\r\nfor himself whether to eat such meat or not. There is a universal\r\nagreement among hygienists and veterinarians that where tuberculosis\r\nis generalized, that is, has affected practically all the organs of the\r\nbody, the carcasses should be condemned. No one will take exceptions\r\nto this ruling, though it does not appear very plain to the ordinary\r\nconsumer why a little tuberculosis is not a bad thing if a great deal\r\nof it is a very bad thing. There is an unfortunate tendency in many\r\nquarters to neglect minute effects and only pay attention to mass\r\naction. This does not seem to be a reasonable or desirable method of\r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Right of the Consumer.=--In all these cases of post mortem\r\ninspection it is the right of the consumer to be informed respecting\r\nthe condition of the animal admitted to slaughter. Only the undoubtedly\r\nsound and healthy carcass should be given a free certificate. The\r\nbadly diseased carcass should be condemned and refused admission to\r\nconsumption. If the partially diseased carcass is to be consumed,\r\nit should be done under such a system of tagging as will absolutely\r\nprotect any consumer against the use of the partially diseased carcass\r\nwithout his knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Summary._--The general conclusion reached is that the consumer has\r\nthe right to protection in the character of food which comes upon his\r\ntable. This protection begins at the time the animals are being fed for\r\nslaughter. It continues during the time the animals are slaughtered\r\nand afterwards in the preparation of their carcasses for consumption.\r\nIt does not end until the meat is delivered to the consumer properly\r\ncertified as being sound and wholesome and warranted to be free from\r\ndeleterious coloring matter and preservatives. The consumers of this\r\ncountry can have this protection if they demand it. They outnumber the\r\nmakers of meat products to such an overwhelming extent as to be able\r\nto secure proper legislation, because the manufacturers themselves, as\r\nconsumers, are equally interested with others in this most important\r\npoint, and should themselves receive for their families the same\r\nprotection that the consumer who has nothing to do with the preparation\r\nof meat products is entitled to.\r\n\r\nSince the above paragraph was written the Congress has provided for a\r\ncomplete inspection of meats as outlined therein.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Slaughter and Preparation of Carcasses.=--It is not the purpose of\r\nthis manual to enter into any discussion of the technique of slaughter\r\nand preparation of animals whose meat is intended to be eaten. It is\r\nbelieved that in this country the mechanism of this process is very\r\nnear perfection, and especially so in the larger establishments where\r\nthe highest skill is employed. In small slaughtering establishments and\r\nin farm slaughter there are found many points of technique which should\r\nbe greatly improved. The principal thing to be considered is, first,\r\na sudden and in so far as possible a painless death of the animal;\r\nsecond, the immediate withdrawal of the blood of the slaughtered animal\r\nif slaughtered otherwise than by opening the principal artery; third,\r\nthe removal of the intestines and hair or hide of the animal; fourth,\r\nimmediate cooling at a moderately low temperature until the animal heat\r\nis entirely radiated; fifth, the cutting of the carcass into the usual\r\nform for consumption and the removal and utilization of the débris for\r\nfood or other purposes; sixth, the delivery of the meat, if to be eaten\r\nin a fresh state, in a condition secured from contamination and decay\r\nuntil it is in the hands of the consumer; seventh, the curing of the\r\nmeat in a proper manner by salt, sugar, vinegar, and wood smoke, and\r\nthe delivery thereof in an uncontaminated form to the consumer.\r\n\r\n\r\nNatural Appearance of Cuts of Healthy Beef\r\n\r\nBeef is the most important of any of the meat or flesh foods. To be\r\nable to judge of its freshness and freedom from disease is of great\r\npractical value. The following colored plates show the appearance\r\nof some of the principal cuts of beef in the proper condition for\r\ncooking. By comparing the appearance of the beef bought in all markets\r\nwith these plates it is possible to form a sound judgment of their\r\nsuitability for consumption.\r\n\r\n  These seven Plates are reproduced by courtesy of Armour & Co., Chicago\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEEF TENDERLOIN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEEF SIRLOIN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEEF RIBS--REGULAR CUT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEEF RIBS--SPENCER CUT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIRLOIN BUTTS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEEF RIB]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEEF LOIN]\r\n\r\nIt is not established that any further manipulation than that above\r\noutlined is desirable or necessary. The use of any kind of dye or\r\ncoloring matter directly or indirectly, of any so-called preservative\r\nsubstance other than those of a condimental nature already mentioned,\r\nor any further manipulation save that to secure low temperature and\r\nfreedom from infection is not useful, necessary, nor desirable. The\r\nsooner the manufacturer of these products understands the rights of\r\nthe consumer in this respect and recognizes the fundamental verity of\r\nthe above postulates the better it will be for all parties. When these\r\nconditions are met all of the many and just objections which have\r\nbeen made to the meats of this country will pass away and they will\r\nassume in the markets of the world that position to which their natural\r\nmerits, when not interfered with by maltreating during curing, entitle\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Names Applied to the Different Pieces of Edible Animals.=--In the\r\npreparation of animals for the market experience has shown that they\r\nare best cut in certain pieces of a shape determined by the race of the\r\nanimal itself and to these pieces or cuts certain definite names have\r\nbeen applied. The method of making these cuts is not the same in all\r\nparts of this country and various parts of different countries. In the\r\nUnited States the most common cuts are illustrated in the accompanying\r\nfigures, with the names which are attached thereto.\r\n\r\nThe analyses here reported apply to cuts as indicated by the following\r\ndiagrams. These show the positions of the different cuts, both in\r\nthe live animal and in the dressed carcass as found in the markets.\r\nThe lines of division between the different cuts will vary slightly,\r\naccording to the usage of the local market, even where the general\r\nmethod of cutting is as here indicated. The names of the same cuts\r\nlikewise vary in different parts of the country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--CUTS OF BEEF.--(_Nutrition Bulletins, Office of\r\nExperiment Stations._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cuts of Beef._--The general method of cutting up a side of beef is\r\nillustrated in Fig. 1, which shows the relative position of the cuts\r\nin the animal and in a dressed side. The neck piece is frequently cut\r\nso as to include more of the chuck than is represented by the diagram.\r\nThe shoulder clod is usually cut without bone, while the shoulder (not\r\nindicated in diagram) would include more or less of the shoulder blade\r\nand of the upper end of the fore shank. Shoulder steak is cut from the\r\nchuck. In many localities the plate is made to include all the parts of\r\nthe fore quarter designated on the diagrams as brisket, cross ribs,\r\nplate, and navel, and different portions of the plate, as thus cut, are\r\nspoken of as the “brisket end of plate” and “navel end of plate.” This\r\npart of the animal is largely used for corning. The ribs are frequently\r\ndivided into first, second, and third cuts, the latter lying nearest\r\nthe chuck and being slightly less desirable than the former. The chuck\r\nis sometimes subdivided in a similar manner, the third cut of the chuck\r\nbeing nearest the neck. The names applied to different portions of the\r\nloin vary considerably in different localities. The part nearest the\r\nribs is frequently called “small end of loin” or “short steak.” The\r\nother end of the loin is called “hip sirloin” or “sirloin.” Between\r\nthe short and the sirloin is a portion quite generally called the\r\n“tenderloin,” for the reason that the real tenderloin, the very tender\r\nstrip of meat lying inside the loin, is found most fully developed in\r\nthis cut. Porterhouse steak is a term most frequently applied to either\r\nthe short steak or the tenderloin. It is not uncommon to find the flank\r\ncut so as to include more of the loin than is indicated in the figures,\r\nin which case the upper portion is called “flank steak.” The larger\r\npart of the flank is, however, very frequently corned, as is also the\r\ncase with the rump. In some markets the rump is cut so as to include a\r\nportion of the loin, which is then sold as “rump steak.” The portion\r\nof the round on the outside of the leg is regarded as more tender than\r\nthat on the inside, and is frequently preferred to the latter. As the\r\nleg lies upon the butcher’s table this outside of the round is usually\r\non the upper, or top, side, and is therefore called “top round.”\r\nOccasionally the plate is called the “rattle.”\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 2 is shown a side of beef with the various cuts indicated as\r\nused for commercial designation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1.

This is illustrated by\r\nFig. 3, which shows the relative position of the cuts in the animal\r\nand in a dressed side. The chuck is much smaller in proportion, and\r\nfrequently no distinction is made between the chuck and the neck. The\r\nchuck is often cut so as to include a considerable of the portion here\r\ndesignated as shoulder, following more nearly the method adopted for\r\nsubdividing beef. The shoulder of veal as here indicated includes,\r\nbesides the portion corresponding to the shoulder in beef, the larger\r\npart of what is here classed as chuck in the adult animal. The under\r\npart of the fore quarter, corresponding to the plate in the beef,\r\nis often designated as breast in the veal. The part of the veal\r\ncorresponding to the rump of beef is here included with the loin, but\r\nis often cut to form part of the leg. In many localities the fore and\r\nhind shanks of veal are called the “knuckles.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--DIAGRAM OF CUTS OF LAMB AND MUTTON.--(_Nutrition\r\nBulletins, Office of Experiment Stations._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cuts of Lamb and Mutton._--Fig. 4 shows the relative position of\r\nthe cuts in a dressed side of mutton or lamb and in a live animal.\r\nThe cuts in a side of lamb and mutton number but six, three in each\r\nquarter. The chuck includes the ribs as far as the end of the shoulder\r\nblades, beyond which comes the loin. The flank is made to include all\r\nthe under side of the animal. Some butchers, however, make a larger\r\nnumber of cuts in the fore quarter, including a portion of the cuts\r\nmarked “loin” and “chuck” in Fig. 4, to make a cut designated as “rib,”\r\nand a portion of the “flank” and “shoulder” to make a cut designated\r\nas “brisket.” The term “chops” is ordinarily used to designate portions\r\nof either the loin, ribs, chuck, or shoulder, which are either cut or\r\n“chopped” by the butcher into pieces suitable for frying or broiling.\r\nThe chuck and ribs are sometimes called the “rack.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--DIAGRAM OF CUTS OF PORK.--(_Nutrition\r\nBulletins, Office of Experiment Stations._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cuts of Pork._--The method of cutting up a side of pork differs\r\nconsiderably from that employed with other meats. A large portion\r\nof the carcass of a dressed pig consists of almost clear fat. This\r\nfurnishes the cuts which are used for “salt pork” and bacon. Fig. 5\r\nillustrates a common method of cutting up pork, showing the relative\r\nposition of the cuts in the animal and in the dressed side. The cut\r\ndesignated as “back cut” is almost clear fat and is used for salting\r\nand pickling. The “middle cut” is the portion quite generally used for\r\nbacon and for “lean ends” salt pork. The belly is salted or pickled, or\r\nmay be made into sausages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--COMMERCIAL CUTS OF PORK.--(_Courtesy of Armour\r\n& Co._)\r\n\r\n  1--Hind Foot\r\n  2--Ham\r\n  3--Rib Belly\r\n  4--Fat Back\r\n  5--Pork Loin\r\n  6--Cala Ham Butt\r\n  7--California Ham\r\n  8--Fore Foot\r\n  9--Neck]\r\n\r\nBeneath the “back cut” are the ribs and loin, from which are obtained\r\n“spareribs,” “chops,” and roasting pieces, not designated in the\r\nfigure. The hams and shoulders are more frequently cured, but are also\r\nsold fresh as pork “steak.” The tenderloin proper is a comparatively\r\nlean and very small strip of meat lying under the bones of the loin and\r\nusually weighing a fraction of a pound. Some fat is usually trimmed off\r\nfrom the hams and shoulders which is called “ham and shoulder fat” and\r\nis often used for sausages, etc. What is called “leaf lard,” at least\r\nin some localities, comes from the inside of the back. It is the kidney\r\nfat.\r\n\r\nAs stated above, cuts as shown in the diagrams herewith correspond to\r\nthose of which analyses are reported in the table beyond, but do not\r\nattempt to show the different methods of cutting followed in markets in\r\ndifferent parts of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Delivery of Fresh Meat to Consumers.=--Perhaps the most important\r\naid to the manufacturer, as well as a protection to the consumer,\r\nwhich modern science has offered to the public is the possibility\r\nof delivering fresh meats to consumers at a low temperature. A well\r\nequipped abattoir is provided with apparatus by means of which a\r\nconstantly low temperature may be maintained in the room where the\r\nfresh meat is kept after the preparation described above. When the\r\nmeats are to be distributed over long distances refrigerator cars or\r\nboats are provided where low temperature may be maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Roast Beef.=--The parts of the beef which are used for roasting are\r\nshown in the diagram, comprising a considerable portion of the hind\r\nquarter of the beef and part of the ribs. The roast is perhaps the most\r\nimportant of the parts of the beef for edible purposes. The average\r\ncomposition of the edible part of roast beef (before cooking) is given\r\nbelow:\r\n\r\n  Water,            60.14 percent\r\n  Solids,           39.86    „\r\n  Nitrogen,          4.47    „\r\n  Phosphoric acid,    .54    „\r\n  Sulfur,             .26    „\r\n  Fat,              10.48    „\r\n  Ash,               1.30    „\r\n  Protein,          27.95    „\r\n\r\n\r\n=Beefsteak.=--The most important parts of the beef next to the roast\r\nare the parts used for steak. Beefsteaks have different names, such as\r\ntenderloin and sirloin, and when the latter two are joined together by\r\nthe bone the whole is called porterhouse. There are also round steaks\r\nand rump steaks which are less highly prized portions of the meat,\r\nbut in nutritive value are probably quite as valuable as the others\r\nmentioned. The average composition of the edible part of a large number\r\nof samples of beefsteak is given in the following table:[1]\r\n\r\n  Water,            63.95 percent\r\n  Solids,           36.05    „\r\n  Nitrogen,          4.54    „\r\n  Phosphoric acid,    .59    „\r\n  Sulfur,             .27    „\r\n  Fat,               5.93    „\r\n  Ash,               1.48    „\r\n  Protein,          28.37    „\r\n\r\n  [1] Means of numerous analyses in Bureau of Chemistry.\r\n\r\nIt is seen that the roast beef contains less water, less protein, and\r\ndecidedly more fat than the steak.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Roast Lamb.=--The parts of the lamb which are used for roasting are\r\nusually the hind quarters, although all of the parts are roasted at\r\ntimes. The average composition of a number of samples of lamb roast is\r\ngiven in the following table:[2]\r\n\r\n  Water,            58.56 percent\r\n  Solids,           41.44    „\r\n  Nitrogen,          4.91    „\r\n  Phosphoric acid,    .61    „\r\n  Sulfur,             .28    „\r\n  Fat,               9.12    „\r\n  Ash,               1.30    „\r\n  Protein,          30.71    „\r\n\r\n  [2] From numerous analyses made in the Bureau of Chemistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lamb chops= or mutton chops are the short ribs with attached flesh of\r\nlamb or young sheep. They are considered to be the most desirable part\r\nof the young sheep or lamb for edible purposes. The average composition\r\nof the edible portion of a number of samples of lamb chops is given in\r\nthe following table:\r\n\r\n  Water,            63.98 percent\r\n  Solids,           36.02    „\r\n  Nitrogen,          4.35    „\r\n  Phosphoric acid,    .61    „\r\n  Sulfur,             .24    „\r\n  Fat,               7.09    „\r\n  Ash,               1.49    „\r\n  Protein,          27.18    „\r\n\r\nRoast lamb, as shown by the above data, has less water, more fat, and\r\nmore protein than lamb chops.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Preservation of Fresh Meats.=--After delivery the meats are at once\r\nconsigned to refrigerator departments in the markets, where they\r\nare preserved until they pass into the consumer’s hands. Thus, a\r\nproperly fattened, properly slaughtered, and properly dressed piece\r\nof fresh meat may be brought into the consumer’s hands in a manner\r\nat once unobjectionable and at the same time one which secures it\r\nadmirably from contamination of any kind. So perfect are these means of\r\ntransportation that fresh meat may be sent not only from city to city\r\nbut across the sea, and reach the consumer as near perfection as human\r\ningenuity can devise.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Length of Storage.=--The question of how long meat can be safely kept\r\nin cold storage of this kind is one which has not been decided. It may\r\nbe said, however, that the period should not be extended any longer\r\nthan is necessary and that the consumers of meat should be provided\r\nin ordinary times, if transportation is undisturbed, with practically\r\nfresh meat. It is evident that if the principal meat-packing centers\r\nare Chicago, Omaha, and Kansas City the cities and parts of the country\r\nremote from these localities must have meat somewhat older than those\r\nwhich are near by. If we pass to distant countries, as for instance,\r\nEurope, where fresh meats are received from the United States or even\r\nfrom Australia, the time elapsing between slaughter and consumption\r\nmust necessarily be long. Thus the length of time in which meat should\r\nbe left in cold storage after it is properly matured depends upon its\r\ngeographic distribution and is not a matter to be decided arbitrarily.\r\n\r\nWhen meats are not only kept in cold storage for transportation but are\r\nactually frozen, as is often the case, they can, of course, be kept for\r\na much longer time than when subjected merely to a low temperature at\r\nor slightly above the freezing point. For this reason meats that are to\r\nbe carried to a long distance and not to be consumed for a long time\r\nafter preparation are usually frozen and kept so during transport.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Effect of Low Temperature on Enzymic Action.=--Attention has been\r\ncalled to the fact that low temperature does not inhibit enzymic\r\naction, and, therefore, it must be admitted that this continued\r\nactivity must gradually deteriorate the quality of the product. The\r\nquestion, therefore, which is the most important is not how long can\r\nmeat be kept in a frozen condition but how short a time must it be\r\nkept. In all cases, therefore, of this kind the consumer is entitled to\r\nknow the length of time during which his meat has been kept frozen, and\r\nthis desirable condition of affairs is easily secured by the necessary\r\nlocal, state, and national inspection already mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Disposition of Fragments Arising From the Dressing of Beef.=--It is\r\nevident that the fragments of sound, wholesome meat which is dressed\r\nfor delivery to commerce are themselves edible and hence there can\r\nbe no hygienic or other objection to preparations made from these\r\nfragments, such as sausage and other minced and comminuted meats which\r\nappear upon the market. In other words, the consumer is entitled to\r\nknow that because a piece of meat is comminuted is no reason for\r\nsupposing that it is not edible.\r\n\r\nSausage, mince meat, comminuted meat, potted, canned, and other meats\r\nor preparations from these sound, clean, edible fragments, necessarily\r\nrejected in the process of preparing fresh meats for curing and for\r\nconsumption, are entitled to the same consideration and may be looked\r\nupon with the same certainty of purity by the consumer when properly\r\ninspected and prepared as the larger pieces.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of detecting any effects of disease in meats by\r\ninspection at the time of or after delivery is very remote and\r\ntherefore the inspection before killing and during the process of\r\nmanufacture should be a most rigid one in the case of these fragments.\r\nSuch inspection and certification would restore public confidence in\r\nthe purity and hygienic properties of these meats which not only are\r\nnutritious but by the spicing and condimental treatment which they\r\nreceive are rendered highly palatable and desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETECTION OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF MEAT.\r\n\r\nWhen meats are in large pieces they may be recognized by their\r\nanatomical characteristics. In order that this may be done, however,\r\nthe piece of meat must either be of a sufficient size to be recognized\r\nby its shape and general appearance or must have a bone of sufficient\r\nsize to indicate its anatomical character.\r\n\r\nAccording to the German law pieces of meat of less than eight pounds\r\nin weight are not supposed to be large enough to be recognized\r\nanatomically or otherwise with certainty. This, however, is a matter\r\nwhich pertains more to the meat of animals from which the bone is\r\ntaken rather than to its actual size. It requires some little expert\r\nknowledge of the anatomy of animals in order to distinguish these\r\npieces, but one who is in the habit of purchasing or cutting meats\r\nacquires this knowledge without any special study.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Odor and Taste.=--Each kind of meat may also be detected both by its\r\nodor and taste, as well as by its physical appearance and shape. Beef,\r\nmutton, pork, and other meats in a proper state of preparation and\r\npreservation have characteristic odors and flavors by which they are\r\neasily detected. One of the common faults of cooking is the putting\r\ntogether of meats of various kinds in the same oven, by means of\r\nwhich the odors become so intermingled that in small pieces even the\r\nexperienced taster may not always be able to discriminate between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Detection of Meat by Microscopic Appearance.=--Meats are so nearly\r\nrelated histologically that the microscope is not a certain means of\r\ndetecting the different varieties. Were this the case it would be easy\r\nto identify the different kinds of meat which may be found in a finely\r\ncomminuted mixture. The expert microscopist may have difficulty in\r\ndiscriminating between different microscopic portions of meat, but the\r\nmicroscope is of practically no advantage to any but an expert and not\r\na very great advantage to him. The fibers of some animals vary in size,\r\ncoarseness or fineness of texture, and other characteristics as much as\r\nfibers do from different animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Detection by Chemical Examination.=--The most satisfactory method of\r\ndetecting meats is by means of their chemical examination. There are\r\ntwo distinct points which are kept in view in a chemical examination.\r\nOne is the presence of glycogen, which in quantities of more than one\r\npercent is characteristic of horse meat. Unfortunately, this test can\r\nonly be applied to a meat in practically a fresh state, as the glycogen\r\nis rapidly changed into other forms of carbohydrate substances which\r\nmake it difficult to identify. The chemical examination, therefore,\r\nwhich is of the most value is that which is performed upon the fat.\r\nThe fat of different animals has different physical and chemical\r\ncharacteristics. The fats crystallize in different forms and have\r\ndifferent melting points,--also the fatty acids derived therefrom.\r\nThey absorb different quantities of iodin and bromin, and have other\r\nphysical and chemical properties which are peculiar to each variety.\r\n\r\nA careful examination of the fat, therefore, will lead to an\r\napproximate degree of knowledge concerning the character of the flesh\r\nfrom which it has been derived. For instance, lard and beef fat are\r\neasily distinguished from each other. In case a minced meat is made\r\nwholly of one kind of flesh or of one kind of animal the chemical\r\nexamination of the fat will, with a considerable degree of certainty,\r\nlead to its identification. In the same manner, if a minced meat\r\nbe made up of equal parts of two different kinds of animals the\r\ncharacteristics of the fats will lead to the identification of the\r\ntwo sources of meat. If, however, one kind of meat be mixed in only\r\na small proportion, say 10 or 15 percent, of another, the chemical\r\nmethods of separation are not to be relied upon. None of these\r\nchemical or physical methods, unfortunately, is of value in the hands\r\nof any but an expert, and, therefore, cannot be regarded as a common\r\nmeans of identification. For this reason the only common manner of\r\nidentification of the kinds of meats which are sent out to the consumer\r\nat large must consist in the general knowledge of their anatomical,\r\nphysical, palatable, and gustatory properties outlined above.\r\n\r\nIn all cases the consumer must eventually rely upon the official\r\ninspection and the label which accompanies the meat or which should\r\naccompany it.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dried Meat.=--A very effective method of preserving meat is practiced\r\nin certain of the arid regions of the country by exposing it to the dry\r\nair and sunlight. Meats prepared in this way are often called “jerked”\r\nmeats. The small amount of aqueous vapor in the air is not sufficient\r\nto maintain the life of the ordinary fermentative germs, and they are,\r\ntherefore, destroyed by desiccation. Meat which is exposed under such\r\ncircumstances does not become infected with any fermentative germ, and\r\nthe moisture which it contains is rapidly given off in the dry air\r\nsurrounding it. For this purpose the meat is cut into thin strips and\r\nsuspended by appropriate means in the air and exposed to the direct\r\nsunlight. In a short time the moisture disappears, and the hard dry\r\npieces keep indefinitely in certain arid regions of this country. The\r\nmeat also maintains a fair degree of palatability and practically\r\nall of its nutrient properties, so that when properly cooked it is\r\na palatable and nutritious dish. Probably of all the methods of\r\npreserving meat this one is the least open to objection, since not\r\neven spices or condimental substances are necessary in order to\r\npreserve the meat from decay. By reason of the change in its physical\r\nappearance, however, which makes it less attractive, this method is not\r\nlikely to come into general use in the ordinary preservation of meat.\r\n\r\nDried beef is also prepared by preserving the meat by condimental\r\nsubstances and, instead of placing it in brine, drying it artificially.\r\nChipped or dried beef is a common article of commerce and is prepared\r\nin the manner described above. This meat, however, has already been\r\ntreated with condimental substances, and hence the drying is only one\r\nof the means of preservation. Dried or chipped meats are often smoked\r\nalso as well as desiccated, so that in their preparation more than one\r\nmethod of preservation is employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pickled Meats.=--The method of preserving meats in a liquid\r\nenvironment is sometimes called pickling. All kinds of meat are pickled\r\nin this way, but pork especially. The pickling brine may be simply\r\nmade of common salt, though other substances, such as sugar, vinegar,\r\nand spices, are used. The brine also sometimes contains a chemical\r\npreservative which is highly objectionable on the general ground of\r\nthe harmfulness of these substances. The preservative commonly used\r\nis either sulfite of soda or boric acid. The making of a pickled meat\r\nof this kind should be discouraged. The vinegar which is employed or\r\nacetic acid may be injected into the carcass before it is cut up.\r\nWhen the arteries or veins are filled with vinegar in this way it\r\nrapidly permeates to all parts of the meat and acts as an excellent\r\nand unobjectionable preservative in all cases where an acid taste is\r\ndesired. It is claimed that carcasses which have been injected with\r\nvinegar in this way are easily preserved, and require far less salt\r\nand other condimental substances than when not so treated. As vinegar\r\nis a condimental substance used everywhere, and one which promotes\r\ndigestion when used in proper quantities, the preservation of meats\r\nor the pickling of meats by a previous injection of vinegar is not\r\nobjectionable.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF THE FLESH OF PIGS.\r\n\r\nExtensive investigation of the composition of the flesh of pigs has\r\nbeen made in the Bureau of Chemistry (Bulletin 53). The pigs upon\r\nwhich these examinations were made were specially bred and fattened\r\nat the Agricultural Experiment Station of Iowa, and were prepared\r\nfor the market by the most approved modern style of feeding. They\r\nwere slaughtered according to the approved method and immediately,\r\nafter proper preparation, the carcasses were placed in cold storage,\r\nwhere they were kept until removal for the purpose of dissection\r\nand preparation of the samples for analyses. Expert butchers from\r\nWashington were secured for the dissecting and dressing of the pigs\r\nin the manner in which it would be done for the best market. The pigs\r\nwere of different varieties, namely, Berkshire, No. 1; Tamworth, No. 2;\r\nChester White, No. 3; Poland China, No. 4; Duroc Jersey, No. 5, No. 6,\r\nNo. 7; Yorkshire, No. 8.\r\n\r\nTABLE

Samples for Analyses.=--The meat obtained from all of\r\nthe cuts of the same kind in each sample was passed through a meat\r\nchopper two or three times in order to get an even, finely divided\r\ncondition. A portion of known weight was then placed in a dish and\r\ndried in a steam oven at a temperature of boiling water or slightly\r\nabove and heated until the fat had well separated so that it could\r\nbe poured off into a flask, with care not to remove any of the water\r\nwhich may have separated with it. Small samples were removed before\r\ndrying for the determination of the exact quantity of fat and water\r\ntherein, and the results of these analyses were used for calculating\r\nthe relative portion of the large samples. Samples of skin, bones,\r\nmarrow, spinal cord, tendons, hoofs, and other parts of the animal\r\nwere also carefully secured and subjected to analyses. In this way the\r\nwhole animal was subjected to examination for analytical data, and at\r\nthe same time each particular part of it, in so far as its relation to\r\nthe market is concerned, was kept separated. In Table A are found the\r\nweight of the whole cut and the data relative to the preparation of the\r\nair-dried sample.\r\n\r\nThe data show that there was a slight loss of water during the\r\ntransit from Chicago to Washington. The part of the pig which has the\r\nlargest percentage of fat is the meat of the tail, while the smallest\r\npercentage is found in the tenderloins. The largest percentage of water\r\nin any part of the meat is in the tenderloins and the smallest in the\r\nmeat of the tail.\r\n\r\nTABLE B.--WEIGHTS OF PARTS FROM EACH CUT AND DATA RELATING TO THE\r\nPREPARATION OF AIR-DRY SAMPLES.\r\n\r\nPIG NO. 1.--BERKSHIRE.\r\n\r\n      NAMES OF PARTS AND CUTS.

The comparative weights of\r\nvarious parts of the Berkshire pig are given in Table B.\r\n\r\nThe data show that 88.19 percent of the weight of the carcass, after\r\ndressing, is composed of meat, fat, and lean, and 7.56 percent of bone.\r\nThe complete data for the variety of Berkshire pig may be taken as a\r\ntype for the other varieties and is given in Table C.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the bone, marrow, skin, spinal cord, tendons, and\r\nhoofs of the Berkshire pig is shown in Table D.\r\n\r\nThe percentages of the various parts of the original material of the\r\nBerkshire pig are found in Table E.\r\n\r\nTABLE E.--REVISED ANALYTICAL DATA.\r\n\r\nPIG NO. 1.--BERKSHIRE.\r\n\r\n[Percents original material.]\r\n\r\n  ------------+------+-----+----------------------------+-----+-----+------\r\n              |      |     |  NITROGENOUS SUBSTANCES.   |     |     |\r\n              |      |     +------+-------+------+------+     |     |\r\n              |      |     | Pro- |       |      |      |     |     |\r\n              |      |     |teids,|       |      |      |     |     |\r\n              |      |     |  in- |       |      |      |     |     |\r\n              |      |     | sol- |       |      |      |     |     |\r\n     NAMES    |      |     | uble |       |      |      |LECI-|     |\r\n    OF CUTS   |      |     |in hot|Gelati-| Flesh|      |THIN.|     |\r\n   AND PARTS. |WATER.| FAT.|water.|noids. |bases.|Total.| [6] | ASH.|TOTAL.\r\n  ------------+------+-----+------+-------+------+------+-----+-----+------\r\n  Meat:       |      |     |      |       |      |      |     |     |\r\n    American  |      |     |      |       |      |      |     |     |\r\n    backs,    | 32.27|57.69|  7.00|  0.50 | 0.91 |  8.41| 0.15| 0.51| 99.03\r\n    American  |      |     |      |       |      |      |     |     |\r\n    bellies,  | 37.27|51.93|  7.00|  0.56 | 1.22 |  8.78| 0.14| 0.55| 98.67\r\n    Short-cut |      |     |      |       |      |      |     |     |\r\n    hams,     | 60.29|22.19| 14.00|  0.69 | 1.15 | 15.84| 0.65| 0.96| 99.93\r\n    New York  |  [7] |     |      |       |      |      |     |     |\r\n    shoulders,| 54.97|29.01| 11.25|  0.81 | 1.56 | 13.62| 0.15| 0.89| 98.64\r\n              |  [7] |     |      |       |      |      |     |     |\r\n    Four feet,| 61.28|16.83| 12.19|  4.69 | 2.34 | 19.22| 0.61| 0.82| 98.76\r\n    Spareribs,| 52.54|29.10| 13.44|  1.13 | 1.19 | 15.76| 0.35| 1.00| 98.75\r\n    Tender-   |      |     |      |       |      |      |     |     |\r\n    loins,    | 68.06| 8.78| 18.56|  0.50 | 1.06 | 20.12| 0.49| 1.17| 98.62\r\n    Neck      |      |     |      |       |      |      |     |     |\r\n    bones,    | 55.70|27.92| 12.44|  0.75 | 1.06 | 14.25| 0.68| 0.81| 99.36\r\n    Back-     |      |     |      |       |      |      |     |     |\r\n    bones,    | 52.83|27.22| 14.38|  0.87 | 1.44 | 16.69| 0.26| 1.24| 98.24\r\n    Trimmings,| 29.68|62.00|  5.19|  0.69 | 1.03 |  6.91| 0.11| 0.41| 99.11\r\n              |  [7] |     |      |       |      |      |     |     |\r\n    Tail,     | 24.02|68.23|  5.75|  0.56 | 0.50 |  6.81| 0.17| 0.39| 99.62\r\n  Bones,      | 38.94|11.67| 17.50|  0.38 | 1.25 | 19.13| 0.44|26.12| 96.30\r\n  Marrow,     | 14.36|81.51|  2.00|  0.19 | 0.06 |  2.25| 0.46|  .. | 98.58\r\n              |      |     |      |       |      |      |  [8]|     |\r\n  Skin,       | 50.24|17.11| 25.25|  6.69 | 1.37 | 33.31| 0.41| 0.63|101.70\r\n  Spinal cord,| 65.70|26.76|  3.88|  0.69 | 0.16 |  4.73| 1.47| 0.40| 97.19\r\n              |      |     |      |       |      |      |  [9]| [10]|\r\n  Tendons,    | 58.43|13.40| 22.44|  4.44 | 0.62 | 27.50| 0.45| 1.18|100.96\r\n  Hoofs,      | 41.09| 0.86|  ..  |   ..  |  ..  | 58.00|  .. | 0.93|100.88\r\n  ------------+------+-----+------+-------+------+------+-----+-----+------\r\n\r\n  [6] Lecithin in extracted sample only, unless otherwise noted.\r\n\r\n  [7] Result of direct determination on original material.

the removal of the head,\r\nhoofs, lard, and kidneys are shown in Table F.\r\n\r\n\r\n=General Conclusions.=--The composition of the flesh of pigs has been\r\ngiven in detail for two reasons. First, because the data relative to\r\nthis point are much more complete than those of any other flesh product\r\nand were obtained in a more systematic way. In the second place, pork\r\nis one of the chief meat products of the United States,--the industry\r\nbeing one of great magnitude, and pork being a common article of diet\r\namong all classes of people. Further than this, the data indicate the\r\ngeneral character of fresh meat, and illustrate as well as that of any\r\nof the typical animals the nutritive value and properties of flesh. The\r\nstudy of pork, therefore, may be regarded as a typical study of meat\r\nproducts. It is quite as important that all people should be informed\r\nrespecting the nature of the wholesome meat which they consume and its\r\nvalue as a diet as it is that they should be certain these meats be\r\nprocured from healthy animals and in a sanitary way. These two classes\r\nof knowledge together give a complete scheme of information which the\r\nconsumers in this and other countries are entitled to have.\r\n\r\nPork, by many hygienists, is regarded as the least desirable of meat\r\nproducts, and it is not the purpose here to combat that idea. Granting,\r\nhowever, for the sake of argument, that pork is a less desirable meat\r\nfood than those derived from cattle or sheep, that is all the more\r\nreason for knowing particularly everything connected with it. Modern\r\ninvestigations have appeared to establish the fact that swine are less\r\nsubject to those forms of disease, with the exception of trichinosis,\r\nwhich tend to infect the meat and make it unfit for consumption than\r\ncattle or sheep. The diseases to which swine are usually subject act\r\nquickly, as a rule, and are speedily fatal, as in the case of hog\r\ncholera, whereas the diseases most to be feared in cattle and sheep\r\nare those of slow activity and those of a nature which is often\r\nnot revealed until slaughter, namely, tubercular diseases. In so\r\nfar, therefore, as infection from disease is concerned, previous to\r\nslaughter, it appears that the flesh of swine is less objectionable\r\nand less open to suspicion than that of cattle or sheep. One of\r\nthe chief objections to the use of pork in any form, whether fresh\r\nor cured, has been based upon the unsanitary habits of the animals\r\nthemselves. With the modern methods of cleanliness and care, however,\r\nthe conditions under which the pigs grow and fatten are, or should be,\r\nquite as sanitary as those surrounding cattle and sheep. The consumer,\r\nof course, has the right to insist upon such sanitary conditions and\r\nthese, under present laws or those which are to be enacted, will\r\ndoubtless be supplied. It is believed that in this country sanitary\r\nenvironments and a sanitary method of feeding will develop types\r\nof animals superior to those grown in other countries, where the\r\npopulation is denser and where the facilities for the proper growth\r\nand fattening of the animal are less abundant. It is hoped that the\r\ngeneral diffusion of knowledge respecting all food products among our\r\npeople will aid greatly in securing these very desirable results.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVED MEATS.\r\n\r\nMeats which cannot be eaten at the time of or soon after slaughter are\r\nnecessarily preserved until the time of consumption. It is difficult to\r\ndraw a definite line between a preserved and a fresh meat. A general\r\ndistinction is the following: Fresh meat is meat which is prepared for\r\nconsumption without the use of any condiment or preservative, without\r\nsterilization, and with none of the artificial methods of keeping,\r\nexcept cleanliness and a low temperature.\r\n\r\nThe above definition, as will be seen, covers meat placed in cold\r\nstorage. A special distinction, however, must be made in this case\r\nbetween meat placed in cold storage for the purpose of transportation\r\nonly and meat placed in cold storage to be kept for an indefinite\r\ntime. Where meats are prepared for consumption by slaughter and\r\nappropriate dressing and shipped long distances to the consumer the\r\ncold storage car, ship, and warehouse become a necessity. There is some\r\nreasonable limit for keeping such products, beyond which they should\r\nbe differentiated from fresh meats. Whenever meats are kept in cold\r\nstorage so long as to afford the opportunity for the growth of a mould,\r\nor undergo other changes of a chemical or physical character which\r\ndistinguish them from the fresh products, they should be placed in a\r\ndifferent class. Fresh meats may, therefore, be divided as follows:\r\n\r\nClass I. Meats intended for immediate consumption and passed to the\r\nconsumer within, at the most, one week after slaughter. Class II. Cold\r\nstorage meats, which are placed in refrigerators, frozen, and kept\r\nfor a longer period than one week. There is evidently also a limit\r\nto the length of time which meat should remain in cold storage, no\r\nmatter how low the temperature may be, since the action of organisms\r\nwhich produce decay cannot be entirely overcome. The exact limit at\r\nwhich frozen meats can be kept without becoming inedible has not been\r\ndetermined. Without this determination, however, it is advisable that\r\nsuch limit should not be approached. Inasmuch as the supply of fresh\r\nmeat is practically uniform, or can be made so by the dealer therein,\r\nthere seems no good reason for the storage of meat in refrigerator\r\ncompartments for a longer time than is necessary for transportation and\r\na reasonable time thereafter for passing into consumption, except in\r\ncases of emergency. It might be safe to say that no meat should be kept\r\nin a cold storage warehouse longer than a month after its reception.\r\nNumerous instances might be cited in which meat may be kept for a much\r\nlonger time, but the question for the consumer is not how long a while\r\nmeats can be kept but how soon they can be placed in his hands. In\r\nthis connection it should not be forgotten that it is the opinion of\r\nperhaps the majority of hygienists and connoisseurs that fresh meat,\r\nespecially beef, improves for a certain length of time in cold storage.\r\nIt is probable that the fresh beef which is served to the people of\r\nthe United States is on an average a month old, and is said to be\r\nimproved by keeping this length of time. This is a question, however,\r\nwhich is still undetermined, and it deserves a further investigation.\r\nUnder present conditions it is well to know the truth respecting these\r\nmatters and to realize that the fresh meat we get, such as beef and\r\nmutton, is not direct from the shambles but has been kept for at least\r\nfour weeks in cold storage.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Effect of Long Cold Storage.=--It has been stated in semi-scientific\r\npublications that the flesh of a mammoth incrusted in polar ice and\r\npresumably thousands of years old has been found to be intact and\r\nedible. This story, lacking corroboration, is hardly in harmony with\r\nknown facts. The author had the opportunity of examining a quarter of\r\nbeef which had been kept frozen in a warehouse for more than eleven\r\nyears. This meat was found to be wholly inedible. It had an unpleasant\r\nand mummy-like odor, was light in fiber and color, having evidently\r\nlost a large part of its weight, and was of a character wholly\r\nunsuitable for consumption. This fact appears to show that eleven\r\nyears is too long a time in which to keep meat frozen. In fact, it\r\nis scarcely worth while, from a practical point of view, to discuss\r\nso long a limit. Only the necessary time for the preparation and\r\ntransportation of the meat is to be considered, and the sanitary laws\r\nof the nation, states, and municipalities should undoubtedly regulate\r\nthe time of cold storage and see that all packages of meat exposed for\r\nsale are plainly tagged as to the date of slaughter, in order that the\r\nconsumer may know.\r\n\r\nIn the consideration of the subject of preserved meats there are\r\nexcluded all meats delivered in the fresh state for consumption and\r\nmeats kept in cold storage in a fresh state during the necessary time\r\nof preparation and transportation say, on the whole, from four to\r\neight weeks. Meats kept longer than this may generally be considered\r\nas preserved meats, even when cold is the only factor active in their\r\npreservation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Method of Preserving Meats.=--Aside from cold storage there are\r\nfour methods in vogue for preserving meats. These may be classified\r\nas follows: (1) Curing with the aid of condimental substances; (2)\r\ntreatment with chemical and non-condimental preservatives; (3)\r\nsterilization with heat; (4) drying. These all except the second may be\r\nregarded as legitimate means of preserving meats.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Curing with Condimental Substances.=--This method of preserving meat\r\nhas been practiced from the remotest antiquity. The chief condimental\r\nsubstances employed are salt, sugar, vinegar, and wood smoke. With\r\nthe proper technical skill and knowledge of the process, meats can\r\nbe preserved in this way, and at the same time aromas and flavors\r\ndeveloped which are considered most agreeable by the consumer and which\r\ngive an additional value to the product. It is not to be claimed in\r\nany case that condimental preservatives add anything to the nutritive\r\nvalue of the product, except in so far as condiments themselves aid the\r\ndigestion by exciting in a perfectly proper way the activity of the\r\nglands which secrete the digestive ferments.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose here to describe the technical processes used.\r\nIn general it may be said that the application of salt is the first\r\nprocess, and this is done as soon after the slaughter as possible to\r\nsecure the proper cooling of the carcass, usually from twenty-four\r\nto forty-eight hours. The meat, properly cut into the forms known to\r\ncommerce, is carefully packed and heavily salted, and allowed to remain\r\nfor some time in contact with the salt or with the brine which is\r\nproduced therefrom. The salt penetrates to the interior of the flesh\r\nand hardens, to some extent, the tissues, abstracting water therefrom,\r\nand, without being wholly germicidal in character, prevents the\r\nintroduction of eggs of insects and the development of ordinary germ\r\nlife. The salt, however, does not entirely inhibit the enzymic action\r\nwhich tends to ripen the meat and make it more palatable. It naturally\r\ngives to the meat the salty flavor which is demanded by the taste in a\r\npreparation of this kind.\r\n\r\nSugar is used, if at all, always in connection with salt as a\r\npreservative for meats. It may be employed in the pure state, but is\r\nusually the yellow or low-grade sugar or molasses. It gives to the\r\npreserved meat, especially ham, a flavor and quality much appreciated\r\nby the consumer.\r\n\r\nThe application of wood smoke is usually the last process after the\r\nmeats are properly cured in salt and sugar. The pieces are suspended in\r\na convenient room and underneath is built a fire of hard wood, which is\r\nkept smouldering as much as possible in order to produce the maximum\r\nof smoke and minimum of heat. Oak, maple, and hickory woods are most\r\nhighly prized for this purpose, since they develop on burning a rich\r\naroma which imparts to the flesh a delicate flavor.\r\n\r\nThe object of curing the meat is, first, to prevent decay; second, to\r\nimpart the flavor of the well known condiments mentioned above, and\r\nthird, to favor the development of the enzymic action which has the\r\nproperty not only to make the meat more aromatic than it otherwise\r\nwould be, but also more pleasant to the taste.\r\n\r\nThe curing of meat in this respect may be compared to the development\r\nof a cheese, except that the enzymic action in the case of meat is one\r\nof minimum extent, while in the case of cheese it is one of maximum\r\nintensity. In addition to the condimental substances above mentioned\r\nspices of different kinds are sometimes added. Vinegar is also used\r\nat times as a condimental substance and is, to a certain extent,\r\nalso a preservative substance, but vinegar is chiefly used in the\r\npreservation of vegetable substances rather than meats in bulk. For\r\nmeats which are spiced as well as preserved as above, vinegar is often\r\nused as one of the ingredients, intended as a condimental substance.\r\nNo other substances than those mentioned above are necessary to the\r\nproper curing of meat, but convenience of application and certain other\r\nconsiderations have led packers of meats, when not prevented by law,\r\nto abandon the old methods to a certain extent and substitute what is\r\nknown as the quick-aging process described below.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Preservation by Means of Non-condimental Chemical Preservatives.=--The\r\nuse of non-condimental chemicals in the preservation of meat is\r\npractically an industry of the last quarter of a century. Up to that\r\ntime the use of non-condimental chemicals was practically unknown\r\nin the meat industry. The chemicals employed are those known as\r\ngermicides. In the quantities used they neither impart a taste nor\r\nodor to a preserved meat, but by their germicidal properties prevent\r\nthe development of organic ferments and thus make the preservation of\r\nmeat far more certain and very much less expensive. By the use of some\r\nchemicals the salting, sugaring, and smoking of preserved meats may be\r\ndone with very much less care, in a very much shorter time, and at a\r\nvery greatly reduced expense. For this reason the practice has gained\r\na great vogue, not as a means of benefiting the consumers, but rather\r\nas a means of enriching the packer and dealer. Chemical preservatives\r\nare also highly objectionable because they keep meats apparently fresh,\r\nwhile in reality changes of the most dangerous character may be going\r\non. They thus prevent the display of the red light danger signal.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Preservatives Used.=--The principal chemical preservatives used in\r\nthe curing of meats are borax and boric acid and sulfite of soda.\r\nThere are many other chemical preservatives which have been employed,\r\nbut these are by far the most useful, the most certain, and the most\r\nwidely employed. Borax and boric acid, of the two classes, are by far\r\nthe more common. Sulfite of soda is used more as a preservative of\r\ncolor, and is probably found more frequently on fresh than on preserved\r\nmeats. Borax has the property of paralyzing fermentative action and\r\nthus securing immunity from decay. Its use, however, tends to diminish\r\nthe palatability of the meat because of its restraining influence upon\r\nthe condimental method of preservation described above. The meats are\r\nmore quickly preserved, require less condimental substances, and the\r\nborax probably inhibits, to a certain degree, the enzymic action of a\r\nfavorable kind, described above.\r\n\r\nThe use of any kind of a chemical preserving agent on meat is most\r\nreprehensible, no matter what they may be. Unfortunately, experts\r\ndiffer respecting the influence of these chemical preservatives upon\r\nhealth. The users of chemical preservatives have employed experts of\r\nknown fame and distinction to testify in favor of these products, while\r\nthe consumer, perhaps, is not able to go to the expense of securing\r\nexpert testimony, and, therefore, as respects numbers of witnesses, at\r\nleast, chemical preservatives have an advantage. In a case of this kind\r\nthe accused must be considered guilty until proven innocent. It is not\r\nsufficient to prove in a given case that borax is not injurious. If it\r\nbe proven that it is injurious in a single case conviction must ensue.\r\nThere is no doubt of the fact that the injurious character of borax,\r\neven in small quantities, has been fully established, and therefore\r\nany amount of testimony to the effect that in individual cases it has\r\nnot produced injurious results is of no value whatever. If a citizen\r\nbe robbed and in the course of the prosecution it be shown that there\r\nare a million citizens who have not been robbed by this criminal the\r\nevidence would be of no value. If it has been shown that the individual\r\ncitizen has been robbed the prisoner is convicted. No expert would\r\ntestify that borax has never been injurious,--even those who appear\r\nin its favor admit that, but plead that it is generally used in small\r\nquantities, and, therefore, cannot be harmful.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Argument of Small Quantities.=--The fallacy of the argument for\r\nsmall quantities is so evident that it needs only to be presented in\r\nbrief form to show the intelligent and thinking people of this country\r\nthe fallacy of the claims of experts in favor of chemical preservatives.\r\n\r\nThe arguments which have been advanced in excuse of the use of\r\npreservatives when used in minute quantities have, perhaps, been\r\nmore vigorously urged for salicylic acid than for almost any other\r\nsubstance. This argument has been urged with such vigor and such\r\ningenuity that a further reference may not be out of place here. The\r\nprinciple which is laid down is that a substance which is injurious to\r\nhealth when added to foods, if not a natural constituent thereof, or if\r\nnot added for condimental purposes, does not lose its power of injury\r\nto health because it is diluted or given in small quantities. The only\r\nchange which is made is to mask the injurious effects produced--to make\r\nthem more difficult of ascertainment and impossible of measurement. The\r\nfallacy of the argument that small quantities of an injurious substance\r\nare not injurious may, perhaps, be best represented graphically. The\r\naccompanying chart (Fig. 7) shows theoretically the normal and lethal\r\ndose of a food and a drug or, as in this case, a chemical preservative.\r\nThe chart shows two curves, one representing a chemical preservative\r\nand one representing a food. The normal dose of a food is that quantity\r\nof food which maintains a healthy adult body in equilibrium. It is\r\nrepresented in the chart on the right by the number 100. If the\r\nquantity of food necessary to maintain the equilibrium in a healthy\r\nadult body is slightly diminished, no apparent change is at first\r\nexperienced and possibly even no discomfort. If, however, the quantity\r\nof food be still further diminished progressively, as indicated by\r\nfollowing the curve down to the left, the point is finally reached\r\nwhen no food is given at all and death ensues, represented by 0 on the\r\nleft hand of the diagram designated “Lethal dose.” As the curve begins\r\nto deviate from the perpendicular on the right the degree of injury\r\nis very readily noticed and starvation or symptoms of starvation are\r\nset up. Thus if you follow the perpendicular on the right downward\r\nto the point 80 the divergence of the corresponding point of the\r\ncurve is already measurable. As you descend to 0 the magnitude of the\r\nmeasurement increases. It requires but very little further illustration\r\nto show how easily the effect of diminishing the normal dose of a food\r\ncan be measured immediately after the curve begins to vary appreciably\r\nfrom the perpendicular on the right.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--GRAPHIC CHART REPRESENTING THE COMPARATIVE\r\nINFLUENCES OF FOODS AND PRESERVATIVES.]\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the perpendicular on the left, which is marked at\r\nthe top under the term “Lethal dose,” namely, a quantity of the added\r\npreservative sufficient to destroy life. The normal dose of such an\r\nadded chemical preservative is 0 and is shown at the base line to the\r\nright, marked “Normal dose.” If you add a very minute quantity of a\r\nchemical preservative, the curve representing it varies so slightly\r\nfrom the horizontal base as to be impossible of measurement by ordinary\r\nmeans. If we follow along to the number 75 on the horizontal base we\r\nsee the deviation of the curve is sufficiently great to measure. At\r\n50 it is still greater, at 25 still greater, while at the left of the\r\nbasic line it is a maximum extending from 0 to 100, or the lethal\r\ndose. It is easy to show by mathematical data that no matter how small\r\nthe quantity of an injurious substance or preservative it will still\r\nproduce an injurious effect which may be infinitely small if the dose\r\nbe infinitely small. It follows, then, as a mathematical demonstration\r\nthat any quantity of an injurious substance added to a food product\r\nmust of necessity be injurious, provided it is in the nature of a drug\r\nand the body is in a perfectly healthy, normal condition.\r\n\r\nHence the argument which has been so persistently urged in favor of\r\na chemical preservative, that if in small quantities it is harmless,\r\nis shown to be wholly untenable. While there is no necessity for the\r\naddition of a harmful substance, where no particular benefit is secured\r\nthereby, and where there is no disturbance of the normal state of\r\nhealth, there can be no possible excuse of a valid nature to offer for\r\nthe exhibition of even minute quantities. That these minute quantities\r\nwould not be dangerous in so far as producing any fatal effect is\r\nconcerned is conceded, but that in the end they do not produce an\r\ninjury even in these small quantities is certainly to be denied. The\r\ncourse of safety, therefore, in all these cases is to guard the opening\r\nof the door. If the admission of small quantities is permitted, then\r\nthere can never be any agreement among experts or others respecting\r\nthe magnitude of the small quantity, and continued litigation and\r\ndisagreement must follow. On the other hand, when the harmfulness\r\nof any substance which it is proposed to add to food is established\r\nand no reason for its use can be given other than the convenience,\r\ncarelessness, or indifference of the manufacturer, the exclusion of\r\nsuch bodies entirely from food products follows as a logical sequence\r\nand a hygienic necessity.\r\n\r\nThe third method of preparing or preserving meat is by sterilization.\r\nOf all the various methods which have been proposed there is probably\r\nnone which is, theoretically, so free of objections as the preservation\r\nof meat by sterilization, in other words, as canned meats. The only\r\nimportant thing is that the raw material used in canning must itself be\r\nmeat free of disease, obtained under sanitary conditions, and subjected\r\nto sterilization before any fermentation or decay takes place. Pure,\r\nwholesome meat thus prepared and thoroughly sterilized will remain in\r\nan edible condition for a reasonable length of time. Unfortunately, as\r\nhas been shown in the testimony respecting the packing industry of the\r\ncountry, canned meats have not always been selected solely for freedom\r\nfrom disease and for palatability. The question of diseased meat is\r\ndiscussed in another part of this book and, therefore, may not be\r\ntaken up here. There have been used for canning purposes the fragments\r\nand, perhaps, inedible portions of carcasses, and this practice cannot\r\nbe too severely condemned. This does not mean that these fragments\r\nand portions of carcasses are not fit for food, but they should be\r\ncollected, prepared, and sold as such with plain notices to the\r\nconsumers of their origin. A cheaper supply of beef would thus be\r\nfurnished for those in humbler circumstances, and no imposition of any\r\nkind would be practiced because the nature of the meat would be fully\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Preparation of Meat for Canning.=--In the following description it\r\nis understood that the ordinary processes of canning sound, properly\r\nprepared beef are described. The question of the canning of improper\r\nsamples is reserved for the remarks on adulterations.\r\n\r\nThere is no uniform practice followed, as has been carefully\r\nascertained by a study of the different packing houses and processes\r\nfor selecting and preparing meats for canning. The exigencies of trade\r\ndetermine this to a greater or less extent. When there is a demand in\r\nthe fresh state for all the beef which can be supplied the canning\r\nindustry will necessarily suffer. When there is a surplus of beef\r\noffered for sale or in case of war, where the army contracts for large\r\nquantities of canned meat, the opposite conditions probably prevail,\r\nand the best meats are used for canning purposes and those of a less\r\ndesirable quality offered for sale in the fresh state. The portions\r\nof the carcass used, as described in Bulletin 13, Part 10, Bureau of\r\nChemistry, depend, to some extent, upon the market of fresh beef. All\r\nof the meat on the fore quarter, except the shank and the “third rib,”\r\nis usually canned, and in some cases those portions are not reserved.\r\nThe cheaper cuts from the hind quarter are also used for preserving\r\npurposes. Very fat, and therefore easily marketed, carcasses are not\r\nused for canning purposes except in case of unusual demand as above\r\nstated. There are two reasons for this, one of which has already been\r\noutlined, namely, that such meat brings a better price in the fresh\r\nstate, and, in the second place, lean meat has a better appearance in\r\nthe canned state than the fat meat. For these reasons, in the proper\r\npreparation of the meat for canning, the more fatty portions, together\r\nwith the gristle, are removed and sent to other parts of the factory\r\nfor making up into other kinds of food.\r\n\r\nThe meat having been selected, it is cut into pieces of approximately\r\nfrom one to four pounds in weight, according to the size of the\r\ntins in which it is to be placed. It is important, for the purpose\r\nof appearances, that the size of the pieces of meat in each tin be\r\napproximately the same. Also for the process of sterilization the\r\npieces of meat should be practically the same size, so that they can\r\nall be thoroughly sterilized at the same time. If the pieces be of\r\ndifferent sizes the small ones would become thoroughly cooked and\r\ndisintegrated before the large ones became thoroughly sterilized, and\r\nthus the mass which would be presented to the view on opening the can\r\nwould be unpleasant to the sight.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Parboiling.=--After the pieces have been selected and dressed they\r\nare parboiled before being sterilized. The time of parboiling varies\r\nin different packing establishments from eight to twenty minutes,\r\naccording to the size of the pieces of meat. In some cases a uniform\r\ntime for parboiling is prescribed, irrespective of the size of the\r\npieces. One of the principal reasons for parboiling the meat is to\r\nsecure the shrinkage, which always takes place on heating, before the\r\nmeat is placed in the tins.\r\n\r\nThe experiments have shown that meats when put in tins in a fresh state\r\nand sterilized shrink to about two-thirds of their original volume.\r\nParboiling is, in the essence, a process of shrinking. When the meat is\r\nput at once into boiling water there is less loss of protein matter\r\nthan when the meat is placed in cold water and heated gradually. The\r\nsubstances removed in parboiling are water, fat, soluble mineral\r\nmatter, and the meat bases. The fat is removed by becoming rendered,\r\nand rises to the surface where it can be skimmed off. A little over one\r\npercent of the protein content of meat is lost by parboiling while the\r\ntotal meat bases lost amount to almost one-third of the total quantity\r\ncontained in the meat. Of mineral matter in the meat as high as 50\r\npercent is lost in parboiling.\r\n\r\nBy shrinking, parboiling tends to make a more concentrated article\r\nand thus favors transportation. Practically the nutritive value of a\r\npound of properly canned beef is about one-third greater than that of\r\none pound of the fresh beef of the same kind. Hence parboiling may be\r\nregarded as a perfectly legitimate and desirable process without which\r\nthe beef could not be properly prepared for canning.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tinning.=--After the meat is properly parboiled it is placed in the\r\ntins either by machinery or by hand. To each tin is added a small\r\nquantity of a liquid preparation made by the canners and known as soup\r\nliquor. This liquor generally contains salt, and sometimes a little\r\nsugar or molasses. The composition of soup liquor is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Solids,       .92 percent\r\n  Protein,      .09    „\r\n  Meat bases,   .23    „\r\n  Ash,          .28    „\r\n  Salt,         .11    „\r\n  Water,      98.37    „\r\n\r\nThis soup liquor may be regarded as a thin soup. The origin of the\r\nliquid analyzed above was not disclosed, and, therefore, no expression\r\ncan be made of the way in which it was formed. It was probably made\r\nfrom soup stock, namely, the waste meat and bones of the factory. There\r\nis no objection to a soup liquor of this kind provided it is made from\r\nsound, clean, and wholesome material. There are two reasons for adding\r\nthis liquid, namely, to fill up the space which would otherwise exist\r\nbetween the pieces of meat and thus aid in the preservation of the\r\nmaterial, and, second, to add a condimental substance which makes the\r\ncontents of the tin more palatable.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sterilization.=--After the cans are filled in this way and closed by\r\nsoldering or otherwise they are placed in retorts which are composed\r\nof strong iron or steel boilers, properly covered and secured, and\r\nwhen these boilers are full they are subjected to the action of steam\r\nheat under pressure. Usually a small hole is left in the can through\r\nwhich any gas, air or other kind, is expelled from the can. As soon as\r\neverything is complete the retorts are opened and the cans are sealed.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, however, after sealing the cans they are subjected to a\r\nsecond heating at a temperature of from 225 to 250 degrees F. The time\r\nof heating varies from one to two hours. After removal from the retorts\r\nthe cans are washed with a spray of cold water for several hours, and\r\nthey are then dried, painted, and labeled.\r\n\r\nThe above is a general description of the process employed which,\r\nhowever, is varied to some extent in different packing houses.\r\n\r\nA modification of the above method consists in exhausting the cans\r\nin vacuo and automatically sealing them in the exhausted state, thus\r\nremoving all air and other gases therefrom. The cans are then placed\r\nupon an endless conveyor and dipped into an oil bath at a temperature\r\nof 240 degrees, the speed of the conveyer being so regulated that\r\nthe cans remain in the bath a sufficient length of time to complete\r\nsterilization before being carried out at the opposite end. After\r\npassing through this bath they are carried automatically into another\r\nbath consisting of a solution of carbonate of soda and, finally, into a\r\nbath of pure water. The cans are then painted and labeled as originally\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL STUDIES OF METHODS OF CANNING BEEF MADE IN BUREAU OF CHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Composition of Beef Used for Canning.=--Samples of fresh beef intended\r\nfor canning purposes, and examined in the Bureau of Chemistry, have the\r\nfollowing composition:\r\n\r\n  Water,                             71.17 percent\r\n  Insoluble protein,                 13.87    „\r\n  Globulins,                          1.38    „\r\n  Proteoses, peptones, and gelatin,   1.31    „\r\n  Meat bases,                         1.09    „\r\n  Fat,                                9.89    „\r\n  Ash,                                 .96    „\r\n  Salt,                                .04    „\r\n  Undetermined,                        .33    „\r\n\r\nThe sample, of which the above data are representative, was secured\r\nfrom a mass of meat weighing 356 pounds, after passing through a\r\nsausage grinder and being thoroughly mixed. The above data may\r\ntherefore be regarded as the representative constituents of the usual\r\ngrade, most carefully selected canning beef.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Effect of Parboiling.=--A similar lot of meat secured in the same\r\nway and from the same carcass weighed 358 pounds and was parboiled\r\nas follows: The meat was placed in water in a steam-jacketed tank,\r\nthe temperature of which stood at 196 degrees F. The reduction in the\r\ntemperature caused by the meat was restored by heating the contents of\r\nthe retort, and it was kept at 196 degrees F. for 15 minutes. It is\r\nthus seen that this parboiling was accomplished at a temperature below\r\nthe boiling point of water. After the parboiling was completed it was\r\nfound that the meat weighed 235 pounds, showing a net shrinkage in\r\nweight of 123 pounds. This sample of meat was then tinned in two-pound\r\ncans with the addition to each can of two ounces of canning jelly of\r\nthe following composition:\r\n\r\n  Water,        95.18 percent\r\n  Protein,       1.75    „\r\n  Common salt,   2.85    „\r\n  Ash,            .22    „\r\n\r\nAfter sterilizing, the cans were opened and the contents subjected to\r\nanalysis. The data obtained are as follows:\r\n\r\n  Water,                                 62.47 percent\r\n  Total protein,                         24.88    „\r\n      Insoluble protein,                 22.25    „\r\n      Proteoses, peptones, and gelatin,   2.63    „\r\n  Meat bases,                             1.15    „\r\n  Fat,                                    9.87    „\r\n  Ash,                                     .91    „\r\n  Salt,                                    .19    „\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Parboiling Water._--The liquor, after parboiling the\r\nabove sample, weighed 280 pounds and had the following composition:\r\n\r\n  Water,       99.12 percent\r\n  Protein,       .06    „\r\n  Meat bases,    .25    „\r\n  Ash,           .25    „\r\n  Salt,          .05    „\r\n\r\nThe above data show that the general effect of parboiling upon the\r\ncanned meat is to diminish its content of water. Only a small quantity\r\nof the soluble proteids is found in the liquor, and the other principal\r\nconstituents removed, aside from water, are the meat bases and mineral\r\ncontent or ash. The fat in the soup liquor was not determined because\r\nit rises to the surface and is not in any sense a constituent of\r\nthe liquor itself. Considerable quantities of fat were removed in\r\nparboiling, the amount depending largely upon the temperature. At a low\r\ntemperature of parboiling, such as described, the amount of fat secured\r\nis far less than when the temperature of parboiling is higher.\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE COMPARATIVE EFFECT OF PARBOILING AND STERILIZING UPON\r\nTHE FRESH BEEF.\r\n\r\n  -------------+-----+---------+--------+-----------\r\n               |     |         |        |COMPOSITION\r\n               |     |         |        | OF CANNED\r\n               |     |         |        |  BEEF AS\r\n               |     |EXTRACTED|        |DETERMINED\r\n               |FRESH|    BY   |ADDED IN|    BY\r\n  CONSTITUENTS.|BEEF.| BOILING.|CANNING.| ANALYSIS.\r\n  -------------+-----+---------+--------+-----------\r\n               | Lbs.|  Lbs.   |  Lbs.  |    Lbs.\r\n  Water,       |254.8|  122.1  |  14.1  |   146.8\r\n  Protein,     | 59.3|     .1  |    .1  |    58.5\r\n  Meat bases,  |  3.9|     .7  |    .0  |     2.7\r\n  Fat,         | 35.4|   12.2  |  ....  |    23.2\r\n  Ash,         |  3.4|     .7  |    .2  |     2.1\r\n  Salt,        |   .1|     .1  |    .2  |      .4\r\n  Undetermined,|  1.2|   ....  |  ....  |     1.7\r\n               |-----|  -----  | -----  |   -----\r\n      Total,   |358.1|   ....  |  ....  |   235.4\r\n  -------------+-----+---------+--------+-----------\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preparation of Canned Beef with More Intensive Parboiling._--In\r\nanother experiment, determining the effect of the changes produced upon\r\nthe fresh meat, more vigorous preparatory operations were performed.\r\nSamples were secured from eight healthy carcasses for use in this\r\ndetermination. Half of the sample was reduced to sausage and secured\r\nfor analysis as described, and the other submitted to parboiling,\r\nsterilizing, and analysis.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF THE SAMPLE OF FRESH MEAT.\r\n\r\n  Water,                                 69.33 percent\r\n  Total protein,                         16.81    „\r\n      Insoluble protein,                 12.69    „\r\n      Globulins,                          3.06    „\r\n      Proteoses, peptones, and gelatin,   1.06    „\r\n  Meat bases,                             1.12    „\r\n  Fat,                                   10.68    „\r\n  Ash,                                    1.13    „\r\n  Salt,                                    .24    „\r\n\r\nThe original sample represented over a thousand pounds. The opposite\r\nsides of the carcasses were prepared for canning and produced the\r\nfollowing amount of articles as sold on the market:\r\n\r\n  Total weight of half carcasses,  1,761 pounds\r\n   3 ribs,                            53   „\r\n   5 rolls,                           43   „\r\n   5 loins,                          166   „\r\n   3 tenderloins,                     13   „\r\n   3 sirloin butts,                   28   „\r\n   3 boneless strips,                 24   „\r\n   8 rump butts,                      36   „\r\n   8 flank steaks,                     8   „\r\n   8 kidneys,                          9   „\r\n  24 beef hams,                      261   „\r\n  Shank meat,                         85   „\r\n  Soft bones,                        198   „\r\n  Shank bones,                       107   „\r\n  Tank tallow,                       132   „\r\n  Canning meat,                      598   „\r\n\r\nThe above data show that only about one-third of the whole carcass is\r\nsuitable for canning purposes. The best and juiciest pieces, it is\r\nnoticed, are cut away and sold for other purposes. In explanation of\r\nthe above data it should be stated that only the fore-quarters of the\r\ncarcass were used and not the whole carcass.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of the sample for analysis, the same selection\r\nwas made as for canning, and only the canning meat was used in the\r\npreparation of the sample.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parboiling._--The parboiling of this sample was accomplished in\r\nthe following manner: The meat was first placed in cold water, 50\r\ndegrees F., and heated by means of injected steam. In five minutes\r\nthe temperature had reached 122 degrees F., and at the end of eleven\r\nminutes the boiling temperature was reached and continued for one\r\nhour. The soup liquor resulting from the parboiling weighed 1,500\r\npounds and had the following composition:\r\n\r\n  Water,       99.08 percent\r\n  Protein,       .09    „\r\n  Meat bases,    .23    „\r\n  Ash,           .28    „\r\n  Salt,          .11    „\r\n\r\nThese data show that, as in the other cases, the chief extraction from\r\nthe meat during parboiling is water and the next most important removal\r\nis of meat bases and mineral matter or ash. After sterilization in\r\nthe usual way the cans were opened and the canned beef subjected to\r\nanalysis. The composition of the canned beef was as follows:\r\n\r\n  Water,                                 56.18 percent\r\n  Total protein,                         31.57    „\r\n      Insoluble protein,                 27.94    „\r\n      Proteoses, peptones, and gelatin,   3.63    „\r\n  Meat bases,                             1.44    „\r\n  Fat,                                    7.72    „\r\n  Ash,                                     .82    „\r\n  Common salt,                             .04    „\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Fresh and Canned Meat._--Below is found a table\r\nsimilar to that already given for the other sample, showing the\r\ncomposition of fresh beef and the resulting canned beef.\r\n\r\n  -------------+-----+---------+--------+-----------\r\n               |     |         |        |COMPOSITION\r\n               |     |         |        | OF CANNED\r\n               |     |         |        |  BEEF AS\r\n               |     |EXTRACTED|        |DETERMINED\r\n               |FRESH|    BY   |ADDED IN|    BY\r\n  CONSTITUENTS.|BEEF.| BOILING.|CANNING.| ANALYSIS.\r\n  -------------+-----+---------+--------+-----------\r\n               | Lbs.|  Lbs.   |  Lbs.  |    Lbs.\r\n  Water,       |414.6|  243.2  |  12.9  |   184.3\r\n  Proteins,    |100.5|    1.3  |  ....  |   101\r\n  Meat bases,  |  6.7|    3.4  |  ....  |     4.6\r\n  Fat,         | 63.9|   39.2  |  ....  |    24.7\r\n  Ash,         |  6.8|    4.2  |  ....  |     2.6\r\n  Undetermined,|  5.5|   ....  |  ....  |     2.8\r\n               |-----|  -----  | -----  |   -----\r\n      Total,   |598  |   ....  |  ....  |   320\r\n\r\nFrom the above table it is seen that the shrinkage during parboiling\r\namounts to 46.49 percent of the weight of the fresh meat. Of this\r\nshrinkage 82.85 percent is water, 14.11 percent is fat, 1.51 percent\r\nash, and 0.82 percent meat bases. It is noticed that more than half of\r\nthe water originally found in the meat is extracted by parboiling.\r\n\r\nIt seems rather anomalous that boiling a substance with water would\r\nextract water from it, but in the case of meats it is seen that half\r\nthe water, or even more, which a meat contains is extracted from it by\r\nboiling in water.\r\n\r\nThe two samples given are extreme cases in the method of preparing\r\nmeats for canning. In the first instance the meat is placed at once\r\ninto hot water just below the boiling point and kept there for only\r\na short time. In the second case the meat is placed in cold water\r\nand is brought to the boiling point and maintained there for one\r\nhour. In the last case the low temperature of the water in which the\r\nmeat was originally placed favors the extraction of a portion of the\r\nsoluble protein matter, namely, albumins, globulins, etc., while, on\r\nthe other hand, the long-continued boiling to which it was subjected\r\ntends to decompose the connective tissues of the meat and causes\r\nthe loss of small particles of the insoluble protein thus separated\r\nby disintegration. Although in the last case the shrinkage was much\r\ngreater than in the preceding experiment, practically no insoluble\r\nprotein matter was extracted, mechanically or otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Canning of Beef without Parboiling._--To determine the amount of\r\nshrinkage which takes place and the general effect which is produced by\r\ncanning meats without parboiling, samples were prepared, sterilized,\r\nand canned in the usual way, with the exception of the omission of\r\nparboiling. On opening the cans it was found in each case that the meat\r\nhad shrunk to about two-thirds of its former volume and that the place\r\nwas occupied by a liquid containing a number of particles of solid\r\nmatter. The appearance of the sample was much less inviting than that\r\nof meat canned after parboiling.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of the sample was made, with the following results: Total\r\nweight of sample, 31 ounces; weight of canned meat, 21 ounces.\r\n\r\n  Water,         63.83 percent\r\n  Protein,       27.25    „\r\n  Meat bases,     1.09    „\r\n  Fat,            4.62    „\r\n  Ash,            1.01    „\r\n  Salt,            .04    „\r\n  Undetermined,   1.20    „\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Liquid._--The liquid in the can was examined with the\r\nfollowing result: Weight of liquor, 10 ounces.\r\n\r\n  Solids,               6.93 percent\r\n  Protein and gelatin,  1.94    „\r\n  Meat bases,           1.84    „\r\n  Ash,                  1.22    „\r\n  Salt,                 1.15    „\r\n\r\nThe above data show that the beef lost 32.06 percent of its weight in\r\nthe canning, a little over half of which is water.\r\n\r\nIt appears that less protein matter is extracted when the meat is\r\nparboiled by being plunged into boiling water than when it is packed in\r\na can without parboiling and subsequently subjected to the temperature\r\nof sterilization. In the former case the soluble proteins in meat near\r\nthe surface are coagulated before they can diffuse into the surrounding\r\nwater. In the other case, owing to the low conductivity of meat, the\r\ntemperature at the surface of the can penetrates slowly to the interior\r\nand the juices which are extracted from the meat carry with them\r\nprotein matter in solution which is afterwards precipitated by heat\r\nand remains in the liquid as matter coagulated at the temperature of\r\nsterilization.\r\n\r\nIt is seen that parboiling has many advantages. It extracts less of\r\nthe valuable matter from the meat, it shrinks the meat before packing\r\nso that the tins contain more nutrient matter, and it improves the\r\nappearance of the meat to the consumer when opened.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Relation of Canned to Fresh Meat.=--In the following table is given\r\nthe number of ounces of canned meat in a number of cans compared with\r\nthe equivalent amount of fresh beef used in filling them:\r\n\r\n  NO. OF CAN.      CANNED BEEF,     EQUIVALENT TO FRESH BEEF.\r\n                    Ounces.

It is reasonable to infer that the added meat is pork,\r\nalthough very probably it may not always be so.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Composition of Canned Ham and Bacon.=--The character of the canned ham\r\nand bacon upon the market may be illustrated by the composition of the\r\nfollowing samples (these samples were purchased in the open market and\r\nare presumably representative of the products as commonly sold in the\r\nshops):\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF CANNED HAM AND BACON.\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------+---------------------------\r\n                             |COMPOSITION OF ORIGINAL

and Bacon.=--From the above data it is seen\r\nthat the products are probably true to name, and are actually ham and\r\nbacon. The principal adulterations which are found in these articles\r\nare preservatives and coloring matters. The coloring matter usually\r\nfound is saltpeter which, in one instance, was present in quantities\r\nof one-tenth of one percent and the average quantity found was\r\none-twentieth of one percent. Saltpeter is not used as a preservative,\r\nalthough it is often claimed by packers that such is the case. In the\r\nminute quantities in which it is employed it has little or no effect as\r\na preservative if, indeed, it could be deemed a germicidal substance.\r\nThe principal preservative which is found is boric acid. In fourteen\r\ncases examined, however, only two contained this preservative, which\r\nshows that there is no necessity for its use on any occasion. Under\r\nthe new meat inspection law all meat products prepared for interstate\r\nand foreign commerce are packed under direct supervision of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, and contain no harmful color and no chemical\r\npreservative.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Canned Tongue.=--Several varieties of canned tongue are found upon\r\nthe market known as ox tongue, lamb tongue, luncheon tongue, etc. The\r\ntongues of calves, steers, sheep, lambs, and swine are the ones which\r\nare usually canned, and they may be previously pickled before canning.\r\nThe average composition of the canned tongue upon the market is shown\r\nfrom the following data based upon the examination of seventeen samples:\r\n\r\n  Water,                 55.17 percent\r\n  Fat,                   20.23   „\r\n  Protein,               19.43   „\r\n  Meat bases,             1.23   „\r\n  Glycogen,                .24   „\r\n  Total ash,              3.71   „\r\n  Of which common salt,   2.90   „\r\n\r\nThe data show that in the canning of tongue a large quantity of fat is\r\npresent, more than the true part of the tongue contains. Nearly all of\r\nthe samples examined contained saltpeter, the largest quantity found\r\nbeing .15 percent.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Adulteration of Canned Tongue.=--It is not probable that any meat,\r\nexcept the tongue itself, is used for canning, but the contents may\r\nnot be true to name. The fat dressing employed is not specified, and\r\nprobably its character and amount rest alone with the ideas of the\r\nmanufacturer relative thereto. Presumably the fat should be of the same\r\nanimal as the tongue. A critical examination of the fat will, however,\r\nreveal whether or not this is the case.\r\n\r\nSaltpeter is the most common adulteration, and is used solely to\r\nimpart or preserve the red color of the fresh meat. Boric acid is also\r\noccasionally employed. One of the samples contained boric acid.\r\n\r\nWithout inspection of the process of manufacture, it is not possible\r\nto be assured of the sanitary conditions of the meats which are sold\r\nas canned tongue and also of the sanitary conditions of the canning\r\nitself. These are all matters of the highest importance to the\r\nconsumer, and should be attested by proper inspection certificates.\r\nUnder the new meat law only the proper articles can be certified by the\r\nofficials in charge of inspection.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Examination of Fat as a Test for Adulterations.=--It is evident, from\r\nwhat has already been said, that the character of the fats which are\r\nused in the canning of preserved meats is not always the same as that\r\nof the meat to which they are added. A careful study has been made in\r\nthe Bureau of Chemistry of the fats extracted from different canned\r\nmeats. The chemical and physical characteristics of these fats are\r\ngiven in the following table:\r\n\r\n  -------------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------------\r\n     SOURCE    | MELTING | CHILLING|  IODIN  |MAUMENÉ  |DEGREES BUTYRO-\r\n    OF FAT.    |  POINT. |  POINT. | NUMBER. |NUMBER.  | REFRACTOMETER.\r\n  -------------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------------\r\n               |   C.°   |   C.°   |         |   C.°   |\r\n  Canned roast |         |         |         |         |\r\n  beef,        |36.5-43.9|27.8-37.0|36.1-50.6|35.6-36.0|   47.0-55.5\r\n  Canned smoked|         |         |         |         |\r\n  beef,        |37.7-41.8|22.0-29.0|50.9-57.5|   ..    |   51.0-58.5\r\n  Canned ham   |         |         |         |         |\r\n  and bacon,   |23.6-30.5|17.5-24.0|48.5-68.2|39.8-43.5|   49.0-58.2\r\n  Fowl,        |28.0-34.0|12.0-36.5|67.0-86.4|38.9-52.0|   49.0-62.5\r\n  -------------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------------\r\n\r\nIt has been noticed that the crystals deposited by the evaporation\r\nof the ether solution of chicken fat resemble beef stearin in shape,\r\nbut are much smaller and more delicate. It is seen that the melting\r\npoint of fat in ham and bacon is rather lower than in leaf lard. It is\r\nevident, therefore, that this fat is not lard or, at least, not wholly\r\ncomposed of the best lard, but probably consists of the fat not usually\r\nemployed for lard making.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Potted Meats.=--There is found on the market a large number of\r\nvarieties of potted meat. It is difficult to describe in any scientific\r\nway these potted meats because the term “potted” is employed by all\r\nmanufacturers to describe a mixture of a great many different articles,\r\nthe exact composition of which is usually a trade secret. There is,\r\napparently, an understanding among manufacturers that the labels of\r\npotted goods are not intended in any way to indicate the variety of\r\nmeat or principal meats contained in the package. In the absence of any\r\ntrade, sanitary, or chemical standard it is difficult to make any just\r\ncriticism of the character of the potted goods upon the market.\r\n\r\nThe principal object of mentioning them here is to inform the consumer\r\nof the probable character of the potted goods which he may consume, and\r\nto let him understand that it is by no means certain that the name of\r\nthe meat upon the label describes the character of the meat which he\r\nis actually eating. The chief object in the manufacture of potted meat\r\nis to make a supply of uniform character and consistency, and properly\r\nspiced and flavored to attract and hold the patronage of the consumer.\r\n\r\nA certain degree of consistency is established by each manufacturer\r\nfor each variety of potted goods made, and to obtain this consistence\r\nmore or less fat meat of some kind is added. It may thus be of some\r\nadvantage to add the fat of pork rather than the fat of beef or\r\nmixtures of the two. It is claimed by many manufacturers that a single\r\nkind of meat does not give the desired flavor in potted and deviled\r\ngoods. Therefore, meats of different origin are finely ground and mixed\r\ntogether, and a sufficient quantity of oil or fat added to secure the\r\nrequired physical consistence. For this reason cured meats, such as\r\nbeef and pork, are often preferred for making potted and deviled meats\r\nbecause of the agreeable flavor and aroma which they impart thereto.\r\nThese meats are therefore used in potting, although they cost more\r\nthan corresponding quantities of fresh meat. In a character of goods\r\nso variegated as these it is impossible to lay down any rule which may\r\nguide the consumer in his choice. The widest latitude is left to the\r\nmanufacturer, and the only real protection is in a strict inspection\r\nof the factory or factories where such goods are made. It is there\r\nonly that the character of the materials employed and the quality of\r\nthe condiments or other substances added can be determined. The day\r\nis doubtless rapidly approaching when consumers will be perfectly\r\nprotected in this matter, and when no canned, potted, or deviled meats\r\nof any description will be allowed to enter into commerce without\r\nbearing the certificate of competent inspection officers as to the kind\r\nof meats used, their sanitary character, etc.\r\n\r\nPotted meats should always be carefully sterilized and the contents of\r\nthe tins should be consumed as soon as possible after they are opened.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Potted Beef.=--Potted beef, more than any other product bearing the\r\nlabel of potted, corresponds more closely to the character of the\r\nmeat named on its label. Of four samples of commercially potted beef\r\nexamined in the Bureau of Chemistry only one appeared to contain any\r\nother meat than beef. The composition of the potted beef is shown in\r\nthe table on page 53.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Adulteration of Potted Beef.=--From the average data given above it\r\nis seen that the principal adulteration in potted beef, assuming that\r\nthe meat is beef, is starch. Two of the four samples contained starch,\r\none more than 14 percent and one more than 11 percent. The admixture\r\nof starch is evidently solely for fraudulent purposes, to increase the\r\nweight and bulk with a very much cheaper substance and one for which\r\nno necessity for the addition can be claimed. It also increases the\r\nquantity of water which the product will carry. Saltpeter was found\r\nin one of the four samples and boric acid in two. One of the samples\r\ncontained a large quantity of tin, due probably to the action of the\r\npotted meat upon the tin lining of the can.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Potted Deviled Meats.=--The term “deviled meat” is applied to a\r\nmixture of finely ground meat with spices, condiments, and other\r\nsubstances, and, like the term “potted,” is used rather to indicate a\r\nmiscellaneous mixture than any single compound.\r\n\r\nAll that has been said respecting the composition of potted meat\r\napplies with equal force to deviled meat. If there be any difference\r\nat all it is understood by the term deviled that the spices and\r\ncondiments are more pronounced in character and greater in quantity\r\nand the miscellaneous character of the goods more pronounced. Under\r\nthe terms of “deviled” and “potted” may be found every kind of mixed\r\nand miscellaneous finely comminuted meat, flavored with all kinds of\r\ncondimental substances and prepared so as to appeal as strongly as\r\npossible to the taste and desire of the consumer.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF POTTED BEEF.\r\n\r\n  -----+---------------------------------------------\r\n       |     COMPOSITION

-----+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n\r\nIt may be said, in connection with these goods, that there is no\r\nobjection whatever to their manufacture and sale provided the meat\r\nused in their preparation is sound and sanitary, the conditions of\r\nmanufacture clean and free of infection, and provided the fraudulent\r\nadditions for the purpose of increasing bulk and weight are excluded,\r\ntogether with injurious preservatives and coloring matters, such as\r\nborax, saltpeter, sulfite of soda, etc.\r\n\r\nPotted and deviled are not the only terms, however, which are used to\r\nexpress miscellaneous mixtures of meat products. The term “pâtés” is\r\nalso employed for a large class of goods, among which the principal\r\nones are the familiar pâté de foie gras, which should be made largely\r\nof fatty goose livers.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Composition of Pâtés.=--The result of the examination of large\r\nquantities of pâtés in the Bureau of Chemistry indicates that they\r\nare made up principally of the meat of beef and pork. It is not quite\r\ncertain in any case that the highly prized livers of fat geese have\r\nbeen employed at all to any considerable extent. There are no forms of\r\ncomminuted meats of any description which are so objectionable in name\r\nas those that are sold under the name of pâtés, especially when they\r\nare ascribed to a particular composition, as is the case with pâté de\r\nfoie gras. As has been remarked before, there is certainly no objection\r\nto the manufacture of these mixtures, but misleading statements\r\nconcerning them are to be condemned. The manufacturer and consumer of\r\npâté de foie gras should establish some standard of the percentage of\r\ngoose livers which they should contain, and each package should be\r\naccompanied by an official certification that it has been inspected and\r\nfound to be up to the standard. It is only in this way that the public\r\ncan be protected against fraud and imposition. Where no descriptive\r\nword at all is used with the word pâté there is no reasonable limit\r\nto be placed upon the kind of meat used, provided it is of a sound\r\nand sanitary character. The term pâté itself means a mixture and,\r\ntherefore, it is no deception and imposition upon the public to sell a\r\npâté of a miscellaneous character, provided it does not bear any false\r\nstatement regarding origin or character.\r\n\r\nThe mean composition of forty-three samples of pâtés and purées is\r\nfound in the following data:\r\n\r\n  Water,                        45.87 percent\r\n  Water in fat-free substance,  71.18   „\r\n  Fat,                          35.41   „\r\n  Protein,                      11.92   „\r\n  Meat bases,                     .82   „\r\n  Starch,                        7.44   „\r\n  Total ash,                     2.88   „\r\n  Of which sodium chlorid,        .97   „\r\n\r\nFrom the above data it is seen that the pâtés are characterized by\r\na very high percentage of fat and a correspondingly low percentage\r\nof protein. A very large majority of the samples examined contained\r\nstarch, the highest quantity found being 15.80 percent. Only two of the\r\nsamples were found to contain saltpeter; six contained boric acid and\r\nthree benzoic acid. Tin and zinc were found in a few cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Principal Adulterations of Mixed, Miscellaneous, Potted, Deviled,\r\nand Comminuted Meats.=--As has been observed in the analyses of the\r\ncommercial articles which have been submitted it is evident that\r\nno detection of the adulteration of these minced meats with impure\r\nfragmentary, diseased, or unwholesome articles is possible in so far\r\nas chemical analysis is concerned. A microscopic analysis also often\r\nfails to reveal the true character of the meats which have been used\r\nin the preparation of these bodies. Hence the adulteration of these\r\nbodies with diseased, unwholesome, unfit, and unsanitary meats cannot\r\nbe controlled nor even positively affirmed after the meats are prepared\r\nand canned. Such adulterations are doubtless frequent and are the most\r\nobjectionable. The only protection to the consumer is in a certificate\r\nof inspection before preparation and packing. The consumer, by refusing\r\nto purchase such comminuted meats in the absence of such a certificate,\r\nwould soon compel the manufacturer to secure official inspection and\r\ncertification of his products.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Adulteration with Starch.=--One of the chief adulterants in sausages\r\nand prepared meats is starch. It has been said by some hygienists\r\nthat starch is not an objectionable adulterant on hygienic grounds.\r\nThis, however, is not strictly true. The injection of large quantities\r\nof starch into meat tends to unbalance a ration which is fixed with\r\ncertain quantities of other food and tends to increase the proportion\r\nof starchy matter therein. There are many conditions of disordered\r\ndigestion in which such increases of starch, unknown to the physician\r\nor patient or even known, are highly objectionable. Hence the use\r\nof starch as an adulterant in meat of this kind is reprehensible on\r\nhygienic grounds. The principal purpose for using starch is deception.\r\nStarch increases the bulk and weight of goods, and, in the process of\r\ncooking, prevents undue shrinkage. The consumer, therefore, thinks that\r\nhe has secured a larger quantity and better quality of meat than he\r\nreally has, and is, to this extent, defrauded and deceived.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Preservatives.=--The preservatives which are principally used in\r\nmeat are borax, boric acid, sulfite of soda, and benzoic acid. All of\r\nthese preservatives have been shown, by researches in the Bureau of\r\nChemistry, to be deleterious to health. They should be rigidly excluded\r\nfrom all meat as well as other food products.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Coloring Matter.=--Dyes are frequently used for coloring sausage and\r\nother minced meats. All such dyeing materials are reprehensible, both\r\non account of the danger to health and deception. Preserved meats\r\ngradually lose the natural red tint of the fresh meat, and to that\r\nextent the color is an index of the time during which they have been\r\npreserved. Inasmuch as consumers prefer fresh meats preserved as short\r\na time as possible, they are deceived and to that extent injured by the\r\nuse of dyestuffs which impart to preserved meats a fresh appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Indirect Coloring Matter.=--Certain chemicals, which of themselves\r\nhave no color, serve to fix and hold, or even accentuate, the natural\r\ncolor of meat. The two principal chemicals used for this purpose\r\nare saltpeter and sulfite of soda. Saltpeter is used generally in\r\npreserved meats to retain and accentuate the red color thereof. Sulfite\r\nof soda is used principally on fresh meats, where it acts both as a\r\npreservative and as a retainer of color. Sprinkled over the freshly\r\ncut surface of fresh meat, sulfite of soda preserves the red tint, and\r\nthe customer thinks it has just been cut. In this way he is deceived.\r\nBoth of these substances are highly objectionable not only on account\r\nof deception but on account of being injurious to health. In the case\r\nof saltpeter, the general opinion concerning its therapeutic action is\r\nthat it is not a proper substance to mix with foods. It would be highly\r\ndesirable on the part of the packer, if he deemed it necessary to use\r\nbodies of this kind, to plainly state upon each package the character\r\nand quantity of preservatives and coloring matter employed. The\r\nconsumer is then left to judge for himself whether or not he desires to\r\neat these bodies.\r\n\r\nThe principal objection to notifications of this kind is that the\r\nconsumer, not being an expert as a rule, cannot form any intelligent\r\nopinion respecting the desirability of these substances in food. He is\r\nmore apt to be guided by common practice in this matter and by his own\r\nopinion than by any general principles of chemistry and hygiene.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Potted Tongue.=--The term “potted tongue” may apply equally to tongue\r\nof a single character, such as beef, lamb, pork, or swine, or the\r\nmixture thereof. The examinations which have been made of the potted\r\ntongues of commerce do not indicate whether they are of a single\r\ncharacter or whether the tongues are derived from a variety of sources.\r\nThe mean composition of twenty-one samples bought in the open market,\r\nas found in the Bureau of Chemistry, is given in the following table:\r\n\r\n  Water,                            52.50 percent\r\n  Water in the fat-free substance,  67.67   „\r\n  Fat,                              22.99   „\r\n  Protein,                          17.80   „\r\n  Meat bases,                         .75   „\r\n  Total ash,                         5.46   „\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Potted Tongue._--In the samples examined above starch\r\nwas found in four cases, the largest amount being 11.6 percent.\r\nSaltpeter was found in eighteen cases, the largest amount being .06\r\npercent. Tin was present in thirteen cases and zinc in eight cases.\r\nBoric acid was found in fourteen cases.\r\n\r\nFrom the above it is evident that the principal adulterations in\r\npotted tongue, aside from the use of meats which are not tongue, and\r\nwhich chemical analysis cannot disclose, are the addition of starch,\r\nsaltpeter, tin, and zinc, the two latter derived either from the solder\r\nor from the can in which the goods are placed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Canned Poultry.=--Other fresh meats, in addition to beef and pork, are\r\ncanned in a fresh state. In the case of poultry the fowls are dressed\r\nand drawn and the whole carcass boiled until the meat is sufficiently\r\ncooked to facilitate the separation from the bones. The bones are then\r\nremoved and the meat is canned and sterilized by practically the same\r\nmethod as practiced with canned beef. Game and wild fowl meats are also\r\nsubjected to the same process of canning as the domesticated chickens,\r\ngeese, ducks, turkeys, etc. In general it may be said that there are no\r\ndifferences in the processes employed, but the important question to\r\nthe consumer is the character of the raw materials used, the sanitary\r\nconditions which attended their preparation, and their freedom from\r\nadmixtures of other meats cheaper in price and of different dietetic\r\nvalues.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Adulteration of Canned Fresh Meat.=--Fortunately the process of\r\nsterilization is of such a character, when properly carried out, as to\r\nexclude all necessity for the addition of any preservative substances\r\nto canned fresh meat. The use of ordinary condimental substances in\r\nmoderate quantities cannot be regarded as an adulteration. Hence, the\r\naddition of small quantities of salt, sugar, vinegar, and the ordinary\r\nspices, when used solely for the improvement of the taste and flavor\r\nand not for preservative purposes, is regarded as unobjectionable.\r\n\r\nThe common preservatives used in canned meat are, first, those which\r\ngive color to the meat and preserve its natural red tint. For this\r\npurpose saltpeter and sulfite of soda are most commonly employed. Red\r\ndyes of any description are rarely, if ever, found. The preservative\r\nwhich is used most frequently in canned meat is borax or boric acid.\r\nThat this use is not necessary is evident from the investigations which\r\nhave been made in the Bureau of Chemistry which show that in most\r\ncases no preservatives at all are used. The addition of any chemical\r\npreservative is, therefore, to be regarded as unnecessary and as an\r\nadulteration.\r\n\r\nThe use of any diseased, tainted, decomposed, or filthy meat, even if\r\nit is of the same origin as that in the can, is an adulteration of the\r\nmost serious character and which can only be effectually controlled\r\nby the inspection mentioned above. The adulteration of the meat of\r\nfowls of all descriptions by cheaper meats, such as pork or veal, even\r\nif they be of wholesome and sound character, is an adulteration said\r\nto be often practiced and one which it is difficult to detect if the\r\nparticles of meat are finely comminuted.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Standard for Preserved Meats.=--The standard for preserved meat is the\r\nsame as that for fresh meat which is given in the Appendix (Circular\r\n19, Office of Secretary, Department of Agriculture). The meat must be\r\nsound, wholesome, clean, freshly taken from the slaughtered animal, and\r\nnot one that has died from disease, suffocation, or otherwise, and must\r\nconform in name and character to the meat of the animal.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Frequency of Adulteration.=--The examination made of numerous samples\r\nof canned meat in the Bureau of Chemistry shows that the adulteration\r\nof these foods is rather common but by no means general.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Canned Horse Meat.=--Horse meat is commonly used for human food in\r\nmany European countries, although it is believed that it is not used\r\nto any extent in the United States. When procured from healthy animals\r\nin a proper way there is no hygienic objection to its use, though it\r\nis considered to be somewhat tougher than the flesh of other animals\r\nmore commonly employed as food, but that is probably due to the fact\r\nthat horses are not raised for food purposes and are usually not used\r\nfor such until they are worn out in domestic service. There are many\r\nsentimental and often religious objections to the use of horse meat,\r\nbut experience has shown that it is wholesome and nutritious. Horse\r\nmeat is characteristic in containing more natural sugar, commonly\r\nknown as glycogen, than any of the other ordinary meats used for\r\nhuman consumption. It approaches in its content of sugar some of the\r\nshell-fish flesh, such as that of the lobster. Practically all of the\r\nhorse meat which is prepared in this country is exported to Europe.\r\nThere are cases, however, on record of the sale of horse flesh to\r\ndomestic consumers. Especially could it be used in this way in the form\r\nof sausage or other finely comminuted products without much danger of\r\ndetection.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Composition of Horse Meat.=--A number of samples of horse meat of\r\nundoubted origin and wholesomeness have been examined in the Bureau of\r\nChemistry and the data tabulated. The average composition of sixteen\r\nsamples of horse meat, representing different parts of the carcass, is\r\nshown in the following table:\r\n\r\n  Water,                           69.81 percent\r\n  Water in fat-free substance,     76.91    „\r\n  Fat,                              9.61    „\r\n  Protein,                         19.47    „\r\n    Protein insoluble in water,    14.83    „\r\n    Gelatinous protein,             1.23    „\r\n  Meat bases,                       1.70    „\r\n  Glycogen,                         1.82    „\r\n  Ash,                              1.01    „\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Dry Material._--\r\n\r\n  Protein,       67.98 percent\r\n  Fat,           27.71    „\r\n  Ash,            3.18    „\r\n  Undetermined,   1.13    „\r\n\r\nThe high percentage of glycogen in horse meat is one of the safest\r\nmethods of determining its character when comminuted or cut up into\r\npieces so small as not to be identified by the usual anatomical\r\ncharacteristics. Very few other kinds of edible flesh contain as much\r\nas one percent of glycogen. Glycogen is a transitory product which\r\ntends naturally to be broken up into other substances, and, hence,\r\neven in horse meat after slaughter, it may rapidly disappear and thus,\r\nunless the meat is examined at once, very little glycogen may be found\r\nin it. A safer test for horse meat is in the nature of the fat therein.\r\nThis fat does not tend to change as the glycogen does, and, therefore,\r\nin a pure preparation of horse meat even in a finely comminuted state\r\nthe separation and examination of the fat will lead to a determination\r\nof the character of meat employed. The fats of horse meat have a lower\r\nmelting point, a higher iodin number, and a higher heat value when\r\nmixed with sulfuric acid than those of beef.\r\n\r\nIndeed, these differences are so marked as to afford a ready means of\r\ndetection to the practical chemist. Even in the mixture of horse meat\r\nwith other meat the variation in the character of the fats will be such\r\nas to lead to a correct judgment respecting the approximate amount of\r\nhorse meat which has been used, provided it forms any notable amount of\r\nthe mixture.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Canned Cured Meats.=--Sterilization is such a certain method of\r\npreventing the decay of meats that it has now come into use to a large\r\nextent in the final preservation of shipments of cured meats. The\r\nobject of curing, as has already been stated, is not merely to prevent\r\nthe meat from decaying, nor is it intended to inhibit entirely enzymic\r\naction. On the contrary, if the method of curing were such as to\r\nentirely stop fermentative action, the flavors and aromas of preserved\r\nmeats, upon which their value so much depends, would be eliminated,\r\nand we would simply have a mass of tasteless meat, preserved from\r\ndecay by the application of chemical preservatives of a character\r\nto impart neither flavor nor aroma to the meat and at the same time\r\nprevent the activity of the various ferments above described. Such\r\nmethods of preparation, naturally, should never be of general use,\r\nbecause in cured meats the consumer demands the flavor which naturally\r\nproceeds from the ordinary method of curing. After curing and when\r\nsubjected to transportation the meats may undergo decomposition and\r\nreach their destination in a spoiled state. To avoid this it has been\r\na customary practice to pack the meat in a chemical preservative, such\r\nas borax. This is, however, a very objectionable practice because\r\neven in the cured state the meat is still absorptive, and the borax,\r\nwhich is packed externally upon it, as a precaution during transit,\r\nmust necessarily penetrate to a certain extent to the interior of\r\nthe meat. By packing cured meat in tins and subjecting these tins to\r\nsterilization complete immunity from decay may be secured and there is\r\nno damage done to the aroma or flavor. We, therefore, find upon the\r\nmarket at the present time in tinned, canned, or potted form almost\r\nevery variety of meat that is used either in a fresh state or after the\r\nusual method of curing.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Canned Sausage.=--One of the most important of cured meats which is\r\noffered for sale is sausage. Sausage may be canned either in the fresh\r\nor cured state and, of course, may be adulterated in both conditions.\r\nCanned sausage should have a clean bill of health from the local\r\ninspector the same as any other meat food.\r\n\r\nThere is, perhaps, more room for deception in the manufacture of\r\nsausage than in almost any other form of comminuted meat. When properly\r\ntreated with condimental substances, such as salt, spices, vinegar,\r\netc., sausages are highly prized as a food product, and justly so.\r\nIn the canned state sausage should undergo no other manipulation\r\nthan spicing and sterilization at a temperature necessary to kill all\r\nfermentative germs and prevent decay.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Canned Sausage._--Twenty-five samples of canned\r\nsausage examined in the Bureau of Chemistry had the following average\r\ncomposition:\r\n\r\n  Water,                           58.51 percent\r\n  Water in fat-free substance,     75.59    „\r\n  Fat,                             21.82    „\r\n  Protein,                         13.92    „\r\n      Protein insoluble in water,  11.37    „\r\n      Gelatinous protein,           1.21    „\r\n      Meat bases,                    .67    „\r\n  Ash,                              2.86    „\r\n  Sodium chlorid,                   1.02    „\r\n\r\nThe above data show that canned sausage differs from fresh meat largely\r\nin its composition, especially in the much higher content of fat and\r\nlower content of water which is found therein.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Canned Sausage._--The principal adulteration, as\r\nhas already been stated, is in the admixture of meats of unknown and\r\nmiscellaneous origin and possibly inedible in character. The degree of\r\ncomminution to which sausage is subjected renders it difficult in the\r\ninspection of sausage itself to determine the character of the animal\r\nfrom which it is made. The study of the fat is the most useful guide in\r\nsuch cases. Presumably sausage is made almost exclusively of beef and\r\npork, but, as a matter of fact, much which is not eaten under its own\r\nname may be found in sausage.\r\n\r\nNext to the introduction of meat of an improper character the most\r\nimportant adulteration is the common use of starch. Starch is very much\r\ncheaper than meat, and its abundant use enables a greater profit to be\r\nmade. It is highly esteemed, also, as a “filler,” on the ground that it\r\nprevents the shrinkage of sausage when fried. Starch granules under the\r\ninfluence of heat are gelatinous, holding moisture with tenacity and\r\npreventing shrinkage in bulk.\r\n\r\nThe presence of starch in sausage must be regarded as an unjustifiable\r\nadulteration unless the amount therein is plainly marked on the label\r\nof the package.\r\n\r\nThe use of preservatives in the curing of sausage is a very common\r\npractice and, hence, canned sausages are found to often contain boric\r\nacid or borax and sulfite of soda especially. Dyes of various kinds are\r\nalso used in coloring sausage or its covering, largely of a coal tar\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nThe proper safeguard for the consumer in regard to the character of\r\nsausage is in the inspection of the factory. It is highly important\r\nthat each municipality and state should have a rigid system for the\r\ninspection of sausage, and the sausage thus inspected should bear the\r\ncertification of the kind of meat used and its general character.\r\nThe presence of inspectors in factories would prevent the use of\r\npreservatives which, it has been shown by the researches of the Bureau\r\nof Chemistry, are prejudicial to health.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Magnitude of the Meat Industry.=--According to the census of 1905,\r\nshowing the results of the tabulation of the statistics of slaughtering\r\nand meat packing and slaughtering, wholesale, for the calendar year\r\n1904, forming a part of the census of manufactures of 1905, which\r\nwas taken in conformity with the act of Congress of March 6, 1902,\r\nthe figures indicate that there has been a normal increase in the\r\nslaughtering and meat packing industry in the United States, as\r\ncompared with the statistics of 1900, which covered the fiscal year\r\nending May 31st.\r\n\r\nComparative figures for 1905 and 1900 are shown in the following\r\nsummary:\r\n\r\n                                                             PERCENT OF\r\n                                      1905.         1900.

Experience has shown that it is not safe to leave\r\nthese matters to the packers themselves. While, doubtless, the greater\r\nnumber of packers will exercise all possible care in the selection\r\nof the materials and in their preparation, human nature is of such a\r\ncharacter that when opportunity for deception, fraud, and illegitimate\r\ngains are presented there are always some who take advantage of them.\r\nHence, it may be safely said that no tinned or canned or sterilized\r\nmeat of any description should be allowed to enter into consumption\r\nexcept when prepared under the inspection of qualified municipal,\r\nstate, or national officers. The health of the animal furnishing\r\nthe meat should be ascertained by inspection both before and after\r\nslaughter. This inspection should be of the most rigid kind, and\r\nall diseased animals should be excluded from entering into standard\r\nproducts. If it be claimed that there are certain diseases which are\r\nlocal only in character and which do not affect the wholesomeness\r\nof the whole carcass, special provisions can be made for this kind\r\nof meat. If admitted into consumption at all, it should be under a\r\npermanent label or tag by which the intended consumer would be informed\r\nof the character of the contents of the package.\r\n\r\nThere is a reasonable doubt respecting the suitability for human\r\nfood of carcasses of animals afflicted in a moderate degree with\r\ntuberculosis, pleuro-pneumonia, lumpy jaw, or other contagious or\r\nepidemic diseases. In all such cases the rights of the consumers\r\ndemand that the benefit of the doubt should be given to them and not\r\nto the owner, manufacturer, and dealer in any of the products they\r\nconsume. Such meat would then enter the market under a separate grade\r\nand command a lower price, and when consumed no one would be deceived\r\nrespecting its character.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted, even if such meat be regarded as wholesome, that\r\nit is of inferior character, and cannot in any justice demand the\r\nright to pass under the name of higher grades of the article. The\r\nsanitary conditions under which such meats are prepared are of the\r\nhighest importance. The slaughter house should be clean, and provided\r\nwith good ventilation and natural light. The workmen should be free\r\nof disease, neatly dressed, and required to observe all necessary\r\nsanitary precautions. The débris and fragments of the packing house\r\nshould be carefully removed and so disposed of as to prevent any\r\nsuspicion that any part of them enters any of the products of the\r\nfactory. Municipal, state, or national inspection should be frequent,\r\nthorough, and entirely removed from any possible influence of the\r\npacking business itself. Competent veterinary experts should pass\r\nupon the state of health of each carcass, and any one found diseased\r\nin any way should be subjected to a further careful inspection to see\r\nwhether it should be admitted, under proper label and notification,\r\nas human food or consigned to the fertilizer heap. It is only by such\r\ninspection as this that the consumer can secure adequate protection.\r\nAfter the meat is once in the can inspection will only reveal whether\r\nor not preservatives and coloring matter have been used, or whether the\r\ncontents of the can are spoiled or in a state unfit for consumption. No\r\nexamination of the contents of the can will reveal in a satisfactory\r\nmanner the state of health of the carcass from which the meat has been\r\nsecured or the sanitary conditions under which it has been prepared. It\r\nis hoped the new methods of inspection established by the Secretary of\r\nAgriculture will secure the desired purity of meat products.\r\n\r\n\r\nLARD.\r\n\r\nThe fat of swine, properly separated from the other tissues, is known\r\nas lard. The process of separation is termed “rendering.” Various\r\nmethods of rendering are practiced, all depending, however, upon the\r\nuse of heat, which liquefies the fat and gradually frees it from its\r\nconnective tissues.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Parts of Fat Used for Lard Making.=--In the making of lard the highest\r\ngrades are produced from the fat lining the back of the animal and that\r\nconnected with the intestines. The sheets of fat which are found lining\r\nthe back of the animal furnishes a variety known as leaf lard. All\r\nparts of the fat of the animal not used in the meats themselves may be\r\nused in the manufacture of lard. In the preparation of the carcass, the\r\nparts cut off in trimming the pieces and containing fat are sent to the\r\nrendering tank. The leaf lard is also removed by tearing it off from\r\nthe back of the animal, and the intestinal fat is separated from the\r\nviscera in like manner. There is probably no question of wholesomeness\r\nbetween the lards made from different parts of the carcass. The lard\r\ndiffers in its chemical composition and its physical consistence as\r\ndetermined by its location in the body. Inasmuch as it is important\r\nthat lard should have a certain degree of consistence even in summer\r\ntime and not become too soft or liquid in character, the lard which has\r\na high melting point is preferred, especially during the summer. The\r\nlards made from the feet and some other parts of the hog have lower\r\nmelting points. The different kinds of fat from all parts of the animal\r\nmight be mixed together and a lard made therefrom representing the\r\naverage consistence of the fat of the whole body. A small quantity of\r\nstearin is often added to raise the melting point, but the addition of\r\nthis substance without notice must be regarded as an adulteration.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Names of Different Kinds of Lard.=--The names applied to the different\r\nkinds of lard may be referred principally to the parts of fat used,\r\nsuch as leaf lard, intestinal lard, etc., or to the method of preparing\r\nit. The old-fashioned method of preparing lard for family use consisted\r\nin placing the fat in an open kettle and heating usually over the open\r\nfire. The rendering takes place as the mass increases in temperature,\r\nso that the residual tissues become browned by the high temperature\r\nreached. Lard made in this way is of most excellent quality and, of\r\ncourse, being made under family supervision, its character is well\r\nunderstood and the parts of the body used are well known. In the large\r\npacking establishments the lard is usually rendered by the application\r\nof heat in the form of steam under pressure, of a suitable temperature\r\nto make the character of lard uniform. Large yields can be secured in\r\nthis way with less charring of the residual tissues, and consequently\r\na finer and whiter color in the lard itself. Lard of this kind is\r\nsometimes known as steam rendered lard.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Uses of Lard.=--The fat of swine prepared as above mentioned, and\r\nknown as lard, finds a very extended use in every kitchen. It is\r\nmixed with various forms of bread making materials, cake, etc., and\r\nis often known in this sense as “shortening.” It is also employed\r\nfor lubricating the pans and other culinary utensils used for baking\r\npurposes. It is sometimes employed for the purpose of cooking by\r\nthe process of frying or of introducing the substance to be cooked\r\ndirectly into the hot lard, as in the frying of oysters, the making of\r\ndoughnuts, and similar operations. Lard has come to be looked upon as a\r\nnecessity in every kitchen, even of the humblest citizen.\r\n\r\nMany objections are made to the use of lard on hygienic grounds, and\r\nprobably on account of its cheapness and general utility it is more\r\nfreely used in American cooking than it should be. In other words,\r\nAmerican cooking is under the reproach of being too greasy. There is no\r\nreason to question the digestive and nutritive value of lard when used\r\nin proper quantities and in proper conditions. It is a typical fat food\r\ncomposed of materials which are almost wholly oxidized in the body and\r\nwhich upon combustion produce a higher number of units of heat than\r\nthat of any other class of food substances.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF AMERICAN LARD.\r\n\r\n  -----------+-----+-------+------+-----+-------+--------+-------+------\r\n             |     |       |      |     | CRYS- |        |       |\r\n             |     |       |      |MELT-| TAL-  | RISE OF|       |\r\n             |     |SAPONI-|      | ING |LIZING | TEMPER-|       |\r\n             | SPE-| FICA- |      |POINT| POINT | ATURE  |       |\r\n             |CIFIC| TION  | MELT-|  OF |  OF   |  WITH  | IODIN |\r\n             |GRAV-| EQUIV-|  ING |FATTY| FATTY |SULFURIC|  AB-  |\r\n             | ITY.| ALENT.|POINT.|ACID.| ACID. | ACID.  |SORBED.|WATER.\r\n  -----------+-----+-------+------+-----+-------+--------+-------+------\r\n             |     |       |      |     |       |        |  Per- | Per-\r\n             |     |       | C. ° | C. °| C. °  |  C. °  |  cent | cent\r\n  Leaf lard, |.9057| 272.64| 41.6 | 43.0| 40.40 |  39.7  | 59.60 | .165\r\n  Pure leaf  |     |       |      |     |       |        |       |\r\n  lard,      |.9028| 281.01| 44.9 | 42.8| 40.40 |  37.1  | 53.04 | .025\r\n  Prime steam|     |       |      |     |       |        |       |\r\n  lard,      |.9052| 279.06| 38.4 | 41.8| 39.53 |  33.7  | 63.84 | .040\r\n  -----------+-----+-------+------+-----+-------+--------+-------+------\r\n\r\n\r\n=Adulteration of Lard.=--The principal adulteration to which lard\r\nis subjected is admixture with other and cheaper fats. Among the\r\nfats which are used for this purpose may be mentioned beef fat and\r\ncottonseed oil. Beef fat has a higher melting point than lard and\r\ncottonseed oil a much lower melting point, being liquid at ordinary\r\ntemperatures. A mixture of beef fat and cottonseed oil may, therefore,\r\nbe made, having approximately the same melting point as lard itself.\r\nThe addition of this mixture to lard would not alter its melting\r\npoint to any sensible extent. Instead of using the whole cottonseed\r\noil for the purpose mentioned it may be previously chilled and its\r\nproduct of a higher melting point, or as it is sometimes called, the\r\nstearin of cottonseed oil, may be used for admixture with lard. Large\r\nquantities of these mixed fats were formerly made in this country under\r\nthe name of “compound lard” in which the above adulterants were the\r\nchief constituents. The laws of the various states are happily of a\r\ncharacter which forbids the sale of a mixture of a compound of lard\r\nand other fats under the name of lard, although there is no objection\r\nto such admixture from a hygienic and dietetic point of view. There\r\nare many hygienists who are of the opinion that the more extended use\r\nof vegetable oils instead of lard would be of value to the health of\r\nthe public. If this be true, the admixture of a vegetable oil with\r\nlard would improve it from a hygienic standpoint. The principal,\r\nperhaps the sole, objection to such admixtures is their fraudulent\r\ncharacter. Vegetable oils, especially cottonseed oil, being very much\r\ncheaper than lard, their use in lard without notification cheapens\r\nthe product and defrauds the customer. Lard may also be adulterated\r\nwith its own stearin. In the manufacture of lard oil a residue is left\r\nof a much higher melting point and this residue may be mixed with a\r\nvegetable oil, such as cottonseed, in the production of a compound\r\nof approximately the same melting point as lard itself. In a case of\r\nthis kind both constituents are fraudulent, in as much as neither the\r\ncottonseed oil nor the lard stearin may be regarded in any sense as\r\nlard.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Detection of Adulterations.=--The presence of cottonseed oil in any\r\nform in lard is at once determined by the application of a simple color\r\ntest known as the Halphen test. This is not a reliable test in those\r\ncases where the animal has been fed cottonseed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Halphen Reaction for Cottonseed Oil._--Carbon disulfid, containing\r\nabout one percent of sulfur in solution, is mixed with an equal volume\r\nof amyl alcohol. Mix equal volumes of this reagent and the oil under\r\nexamination and heat in a bath of boiling brine for fifteen minutes. In\r\nthe presence of as little as one percent of cottonseed oil an orange or\r\nred color is produced, which is characteristic.\r\n\r\nLard and lard oil from animals fed on cottonseed meal will give a faint\r\nreaction; also the fatty acids thereof.\r\n\r\nThis test is more sensitive than the Bechi test (nitrate of silver)\r\nand less liable to give unsatisfactory results in the hands of an\r\ninexperienced person. It is not affected by rancidity. The depth\r\nof color is proportional, to a certain extent, to the amount of oil\r\npresent, and by making comparative tests with cottonseed oil some idea\r\nas to the amount present can be obtained, but it must be remembered\r\nthat different oils react with different intensities, and oils which\r\nhave been heated from 200° to 210° C. react with greatly diminished\r\nintensity. Heating ten minutes at 250° renders cottonseed oil incapable\r\nof giving the reaction.\r\n\r\nCottonseed oil also has the property of reducing silver in silver\r\nnitrate to a metallic state. When mixed with a solution of silver\r\nnitrate under proper conditions a blackening or precipitation of black\r\nmetallic silver is observed. This is known as the Bechi test which is\r\nconducted as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bechi or Silver Nitrate Test for Cottonseed Oil._--_Reagent_: Dissolve\r\n2 grams of silver nitrate in 200 cubic centimeters of 95 percent\r\nalcohol and 40 cubic centimeters of ether, adding one drop of nitric\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nMix 10 c.c. of oil or melted fat, 5 c.c. of reagent, and 10 c.c. of\r\namyl alcohol in a test tube. Divide, heat one-half in a boiling water\r\nbath for ten minutes, and then compare with portion not heated. Any\r\nblackening due to reduced silver shows presence of cottonseed oil.\r\n\r\nOther oils which have become rancid, and lards which have been steamed\r\nor heated at high temperature, contain decomposition products which\r\nhave a reducing action on silver nitrate. There were found in testing\r\na large number of salad oils some which contained no cottonseed oil,\r\naccording to the Halphen test, but gave a brown coloration with Bechi\r\nreagent, and in some cases reduced silver. These same oils on being\r\npurified gave no reaction. Hence the oils or fats should be purified\r\nbefore testing.\r\n\r\nTo purify the oils and fats, heat from 20 to 30 grams on water bath for\r\na few minutes with the addition of 25 c.c. of 95 percent alcohol, shake\r\nthoroughly, decant as much of the alcohol as possible, and wash with\r\ntwo percent nitric acid, and finally with water. The oil or lard thus\r\npurified will give no reduction at all if it contains no cottonseed\r\noil. Heating the oils or fats to 100° C. or simple washing with two\r\npercent nitric acid is not sufficient, except in a few cases.\r\n\r\nWith oils the use of the Halphen and Bechi tests will be found to\r\nbe useful as a means of approximately determining the amounts of\r\nadulteration present. If Halphen gives a reaction and Bechi does not,\r\nthe adulteration with cottonseed oil is probably less than 10 percent.\r\n\r\nThe admixture of beef fat with lard is best detected by means of\r\nthe microscope. The fat is dissolved in ether and allowed to slowly\r\ncrystallize. If it is composed of pure lard the crystal assumes a form\r\nwhich is represented in Fig. 8.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, beef fat be mixed with lard, the crystals will\r\nassume a radiated fan-shaped appearance shown in Fig. 9. Even one\r\nwho is an expert with the microscope may not be able without some\r\ndifficulty to detect these adulterations by the simple tests above\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--LARD CRYSTALS. × 140.--(_Bureau of Chemistry._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--BEEF FAT CRYSTALS. × 140.--(_Bureau of\r\nChemistry._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Commercial Classification of Lards.=--In addition to the kinds of lard\r\nmentioned above other varieties are known in commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Neutral Lard.=--This, which is one of the best varieties of lard, is\r\nmade from the fat derived from the leaf lard of the slaughtered animal\r\nin a perfectly fresh state, that is, taken immediately after slaughter\r\nand before the carcass is cold. The leaf lard, when it is removed from\r\nthe animal, is at once placed in cold storage or put into cold water,\r\nin order to rapidly remove the animal heat. As soon as it is thoroughly\r\nchilled it is reduced to a pulp in a grinder and sent at once to the\r\nrendering kettle. The fat is rendered at a very low temperature, from\r\n105 to 120 degrees F. (40-50 degrees C). It is evident that only a part\r\nof the lard is separated at this temperature, and this part is regarded\r\nas being of the best quality, almost tasteless, free of acids and\r\nother impurities. The residue from the making of neutral lard is sent\r\nto other kettles, where it is subjected to a higher temperature and\r\nthe remainder of the lard extracted, which is sold under the name of\r\nanother grade. Neutral lard, obtained as above, while still liquid, is\r\nwashed with water containing a trace of sodium carbonate, common salt,\r\nor a dilute acid. The product thus formed is almost neutral in its\r\nreaction to litmus paper containing not to exceed .25 percent of free\r\nacid, but it has more water and mineral matter than is found in the\r\npure rendered untreated lard. The neutral lard made in this way is not\r\nused so commonly for culinary purposes but chiefly in the manufacture\r\nof oleomargarine.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Leaf Lard.=--The residue of lard obtained by rendering the unseparated\r\npart of lard from the above process at a higher temperature is also\r\nof a high quality and is sometimes improperly designated leaf lard, a\r\nterm which should be reserved for the whole product instead of a part\r\nobtained by rendering the residual leaf fat.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Choice Kettle-rendered Lard.=--The amount of neutral lard which is\r\ndemanded in the manufacture of oleomargarine does not by any means\r\nexhaust the supply of leaf lard. For making choice kettle-rendered lard\r\nthe leaf lard together with the fat cut from the back of the animal is\r\nrendered in steam-jacketed open kettles and produces a lard of a high\r\nquality known as kettle-rendered or choice kettle-rendered lard. The\r\nhide is removed from the fat portion of the back used for this purpose\r\nbefore the rendering. Both the leaf and pieces of the back are passed\r\nthrough a fine sausage grinder before they enter the rendering kettle.\r\nAccording to the requirements of the Chicago Board of Trade, choice\r\nlard, which is another term for the above variety, is to be made from\r\nleaf and trimmings only, either steam-rendered or kettle-rendered, and\r\nthe manner of rendering to be branded on each package.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Prime Steam Lard.=--The prime steam lard of commerce is made as\r\nfollows: The whole head of the hog, after the removal of the jowl,\r\nis used for rendering. The heads are placed in the bottom of the\r\nrendering tank. The mesenteric fat adhering to the small intestines is\r\nalso used in the tank. Any fat that may be attached to the heart or\r\nother organs of the animal may also be used. In those factories where\r\nkettle-rendered lard is not made the scrap fat from the back of the\r\nanimals and trimmings are also used. When there is an excess of leaf it\r\nis also put in the rendering tank and, in general, all the fat portions\r\nof the body which are removed in the trimming process. It is thus seen\r\nthat prime steam lard is a term which may practically represent the\r\naverage fat of the whole animal.\r\n\r\nPrime steam lard is thus defined by the Chicago Board of Trade:\r\n“Standard prime steam lard shall be solely the product of the\r\ntrimmings and other fat parts of hogs, rendered in tanks by the direct\r\napplication of steam, and without subsequent change in grain or\r\ncharacter by the use of agitators or other machinery except as such\r\nchange may unavoidably come from transportation. It shall have proper\r\ncolor, flavor, and soundness for keeping, and no material which has\r\nbeen salted shall be included. The name and location of the renderer\r\nand the grade of the lard shall be plainly branded on each package at\r\nthe time of packing.” All the lard which is made is subjected to the\r\napproval of inspectors both as to the material employed and the method\r\nof procedure, together with the character of the final product.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Disposition of the Intestines of the Hog.=--In the term intestines\r\nis included all of the abdominal viscera of the animal but not the\r\nthoracic viscera, namely, the heart and lungs. The material is\r\nhandled in the following way: When the animal is opened the viscera\r\nare separated, including the flesh surrounding the anus and a strip\r\ncontaining the external genito-urinary organs. The heart is thrown\r\nto one side and the fatty portions trimmed off for lard. The rest of\r\nthe heart is used for sausage or for fertilizer. The lungs and liver\r\nare either used in the manufacture of sausage or for fertilizer. The\r\nrectum and large intestines are separated from the intestinal fat\r\nand peritoneum and, along with the adhering flesh and genito-urinary\r\norgans, sent to the trimmer. All flesh from the above-mentioned organs\r\nis cut away and the intestine proper is used for sausage casings. The\r\ntrimmings, including the genito-urinary organs, are washed and placed\r\nin the rendering tank where lard is made. The small intestine is also\r\nseparated from the fatty membrane surrounding it and prepared for\r\nsausage casings. The remaining material, consisting of the peritoneum,\r\ndiaphragm, stomach, and adhering membranes, together with the\r\nintestinal fat, constitutes the “guts” which are subjected to washing\r\nin three or four different tanks. In the first tank the stomach and\r\nperitoneum are split open, and also any portion of the intestines which\r\nstill adhere to the peritoneum. The portions then go from tank to tank,\r\nusually four in number, and are then ready for the rendering tank. The\r\nomentum fat is cut from the kidneys, and the kidneys with any adhering\r\nfat go into the rendering vat. The spleen, pancreas, vocal cords,\r\ntrachea, and œsophagus also go into the tank.\r\n\r\nIn general it may be said that everything connected with the viscera\r\ngo into the rendering tank with the following exceptions: First, that\r\nportion of the intestines which is saved for sausage casings; second,\r\nthe liver and lungs; third, that part of the heart free from fat.\r\n\r\nIn the killing of small hogs, where the intestines are not of\r\nsufficient size to be suitable for sausage casings, they also go into\r\nthe rendering tank. It should be stated here that the grease or lard\r\nobtained by the rendering of the above described viscera, according to\r\nthe statements of the manufacturers, is used solely in the manufacture\r\nof lard oil and soap, and does not enter into the lard of commerce.\r\n\r\nWhen the processes of manufacture are properly controlled by official\r\ninspection the public may be assured that this disposition of the fat\r\nobtained by the rendering of the intestinal viscera is secured.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Butchers’ Lard.=--A considerable quantity of lard is made for\r\ncommercial purposes by the small butcher for family use, etc. This lard\r\nis made almost exclusively by rendering in the open kettle. In the\r\ncountry where butchering is conducted for family use the ordinary open\r\nkettle is placed over an open fire. All parts of the fat of the animal\r\nwhich can be easily separated and the scraps derived from trimming the\r\nanimal are used for rendering. The offal and refuse of the animal are\r\nalso rendered separately and the product used for soap grease. The\r\nlard made in this way is regarded as perfectly wholesome, but it is\r\nfrequently dark-colored from the charring due to rendering over the\r\nopen fire and by reason of using some portions of the animal, such as\r\ntendons, from which glue is made. Such lard may contain traces or even\r\nconsiderable quantities of glue which, however, cannot be regarded as\r\nan unwholesome product. The partially browned residues in the kettle in\r\nthe country are known as “cracklings” and are used for soap grease.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Inedible Hog Fat Products.=--In the shipping of hogs a great many\r\nare smothered and others die of disease or are in a condition, at the\r\ntime of slaughter, which renders them unfit for human food, either\r\nby the presence of disease or otherwise. The fats are separated from\r\ndead animals of this class and are used for technical purposes such as\r\nburning oils, soap grease, etc. There are several varieties of these\r\ninedible fats of which the following are the principal:\r\n\r\n\r\n_White Grease._--This grease is made chiefly from hogs which die in\r\ntransit by being smothered or from freezing. Formerly it was the custom\r\nto make white grease also from the animals which died of disease, but\r\nthe manufacture of this product has been restricted by certain state\r\nlaws which forbid the use of animals which die of particular diseases,\r\nsuch as hog cholera, from being used for any purpose whatever and\r\ntheir carcasses are to be buried so as to remove all danger of\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Brown Grease._--Brown grease is a product of a lower grade than white\r\ngrease and is made usually by rendering the whole animal. It is one of\r\nthe by-products in the manufacture of tankage from condemned animal\r\ncarcasses, the tankage being used as fertilizer. Both white and brown\r\ngrease are used chiefly in the manufacture of low grade lard oil and in\r\nthe making of soap.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Yellow Grease._--Yellow grease is a product intermediate in value\r\nbetween white and brown grease. It is made chiefly from the carcasses\r\nof animals that die while on the packers’ hands. It is used for the\r\nsame purpose as white and brown grease.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pig’s-foot Grease._--A special variety of grease is made from pigs’\r\nfeet as a by-product in the glue factory. This grease is used also in\r\nmaking lard oil and soap. It is evident that these varieties of grease\r\nare only inedible varieties of lard, and through proper inspection the\r\npublic is protected against the use of these varieties of grease in the\r\nedible product.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lard Stearin.=--Mention has already been made of the fact that by\r\nmelting a fat and cooling it slowly towards its solidifying point,\r\ncertain constituents of the fat which have a higher melting point\r\nseparate first, leaving those constituents with a lower melting point\r\nstill in a liquid condition. Those portions of an oil or fat which\r\nseparate first under such conditions, are the constituents of the\r\nproduct which is known as stearin, while the part that remains liquid\r\nis the constituent known as olein. Lard stearin is made principally for\r\nthe manufacture of mixtures and is a by-product of the highest grade\r\nof lard oil. Lard stearin is made as follows: The lard is melted and\r\nkept in a crystallizing room at from 50 to 60 degrees F., until it\r\nis filled with the crystals of the separated stearin. The product is\r\nthen wrapped in the form of cakes with cloth. Each package contains\r\nfrom 10 to 20 pounds. The cakes are then placed in a large press with\r\nsuitable arrangements to facilitate the escape of the oil and maintain\r\nthe low temperature. The pressure is applied very gradually at first,\r\nand as the process advances, with increasing power. The high grade oil\r\nobtained in this way is known as prime or extra lard oil and is used\r\nfor illuminating and lubricating purposes. The resulting solid product,\r\nwhich is principally stearin, is used as one of the adulterants of\r\nlard, that is, in making a mixture which is sometimes called lard,\r\ncomposed of lard stearin and cottonseed oil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tanks Used for Producing Lard Under Pressure.=--There are various\r\nforms of tanks used for producing steam rendered lard. In the open\r\nkettle there is a jacketed arrangement by means of which steam, at\r\nthe proper temperature, is made to act upon the contents of the inner\r\nkettle. In the closed kettle the steam may be applied in the form of\r\na jacketed arrangement or introduced directly into the kettle. The\r\nresidues which remain after the steaming is completed and after the\r\nlard has been drawn off are withdrawn from the conical lower portion\r\nof the kettle which can be opened for the removal of these residues. A\r\ntypical kettle for rendering lard is shown in Fig. 10. The fragments of\r\nmeat to be received are placed in the opening M which is then properly\r\nclosed when the tank is full. Steam is admitted and the condensation\r\nwhich is produced at first by the cold contents of the tank is drawn\r\noff through a water pipe. After the tank is thoroughly heated and the\r\nfat begins to separate the lard will rise above the water and the solid\r\nfragments and at the end of the process will fill the upper part of the\r\ntank. By means of the cocks at D it can be determined to what depth the\r\ntank is filled with lard and the lard can be drawn off through these\r\ncocks until water begins to flow. The bottom of the tank at G is then\r\nopened and the residues withdrawn, dried and ground for tankage.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Physical Properties of Lard.=--_Specific Gravity._--The specific\r\ngravity of pure lard is to be determined at some definite temperature,\r\ninasmuch as a statement of its specific gravity without some\r\nreference to the temperature at which it is determined is likely to\r\nbe misleading. It is not convenient to ascertain the specific gravity\r\nof a lard at a temperature below its melting point. It is customary,\r\ntherefore, either to take the specific gravity at about 40 degrees C.,\r\nor at a temperature of boiling water.\r\n\r\nThe average specific gravity of pure lard at 40 degrees C. (104 degrees\r\nF.), regarding water as 100, is 89, and at 100 degrees C. it is 86,\r\nthe weight of water being determined at the point of greatest density,\r\nnamely, 4 degrees C. (39 degrees F.). Unfortunately the specific\r\ngravity of pure lard is not very greatly different from that of other\r\noils or other fats used in its adulteration. For this reason it is not\r\nof the highest value for determining whether or not the pure article\r\nhas been subjected to adulteration.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Melting Point._--The melting point of a pure lard is a physical\r\ncharacteristic of great value, since it is chiefly influenced by the\r\npart of the body of the animal from which it is made. The fat which is\r\nrendered from the foot of the hog has the lowest melting point, namely,\r\nabout 35 degrees C. (95° F.). The fat adhering to the intestines has\r\nthe highest melting point, namely, 44 degrees C. (111 degrees F.). The\r\nfat derived from the head of the hog has a slightly higher melting\r\npoint than that from the feet. The kidney fat has a melting point\r\nof 42.5 degrees C. (108.2 degrees F.). In the steam rendered lards,\r\nrepresenting the average of lards passed upon by the Chicago Board of\r\nTrade, the average melting point is found to be about 37 degrees C.\r\n(98.7 degrees F.). The melting point of superior or leaf lard has an\r\naverage value of about 40 degrees C. (104 degrees F.).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Color Reaction._--A pure high grade lard when mixed on a white\r\nporcelain plate with the proper amount of sulfuric or nitric acid\r\nshould give only a very slight coloration. The production of any\r\nconsiderable quantity of color, either brown or black, indicates the\r\npresence of organic impurities in the lard.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rise of Temperature with Sulfuric Acid._--The various fats give\r\ndifferent degrees of heat when mixed, under certain conditions, with\r\nstrong sulfuric acid. It is possible to determine the approximate\r\ndegree of the adulteration of lard by applying this test. The operation\r\nis a simple one and is conducted in the apparatus shown in Fig. 11.\r\nA common test tube about 24 cubic centimeters in length and 5 cubic\r\ncentimeters in diameter is hung as indicated in the figure, provided\r\nwith a stopper carrying a thermometer in the center with a bent glass\r\nrod stirrer passed loosely through the stopper on the side and a funnel\r\nfor the introduction of the acid on another side of the thermometer. A\r\ncoil which is on the stirring rod is so arranged as to permit the bulb\r\nof the thermometer to pass through its center.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Manipulation._--Fifty cubic centimeters of the fat or oil to be\r\nexamined are placed in the test tube and warmed or cooled, as the case\r\nmay be, until the temperature is the one required for the beginning\r\nof the experiment, say 35 degrees C.; 10 cubic centimeters of the\r\nstrongest sulfuric acid at the same temperature are placed in the\r\nfunnel, the stopper being firmly fixed in its place; the test tube\r\ncontaining the oil is placed in a non-conducting receptacle; the wooden\r\ncylinder lined with cork, used in sending glass bottles by mail, is\r\nfound to be convenient for this purpose. The glass rod or stirrer which\r\nfits loosely in the stopper, so as to be moved rapidly up and down, is\r\nheld by the right hand of the operator; with his left hand he opens the\r\nglass stop-cock of the funnel and allows the sulfuric acid to flow in\r\nupon the oil. The glass stirring rod is now moved rapidly up and down,\r\nfor about 20 seconds, thus securing a thorough mixture of the oil and\r\nacid. The mercury rises rapidly in the thermometer and after two or\r\nthree minutes reaches a maximum, and then, after two or three minutes\r\nmore, begins to descend. The reading is made at the maximum point\r\nreached by the mercury. With pure cottonseed oil, linseed oil and some\r\nother substances the rise of temperature is so great as to produce\r\nebullition in the mass, causing it to foam up and fill the tube. To\r\navoid this, smaller quantities of acid should be used or the oil in\r\nquestion be diluted with a less thermogenic one, so that the maximum\r\ntemperature may not be high enough to produce the effect cited.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Chemical Properties.=--_Volatile Acids._--The quantity of volatile\r\nacid arising on the decomposition of a soap made by the saponification\r\nof lard is very minute in lard of high quality. The total amount of\r\nvolatile acid should not be in excess of that necessary to saturate .2\r\ncubic centimeter of deci-normal alkali solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fixed Acid._--The quantity of fixed acid, consisting principally of\r\noleic and stearic, in pure lard should not be less than 93 percent. The\r\ntotal quantity of free acid in lard, that is, acid uncombined with the\r\nglycerine, should not exceed one-half of one percent, and in neutral\r\nlard should be much less than this.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quantity of Iodin Absorbed._--All common fats and oils have the\r\nproperty of absorbing, under given conditions, certain quantities of\r\niodin. Lard of the highest quality should not absorb more than 60\r\npercent of its weight of iodin. The lard made from the feet and certain\r\nother parts of the animal, however, may have a larger iodin number,\r\nrising as high as 75 or even 80.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Properties of Lard.=--The average properties of different classes of\r\nlard in relation to physical and optical conditions are shown in the\r\nfollowing table:\r\n\r\n                          RE-     RISE OF TEMPER-\r\n  SPECIFIC   MELTING   FRACTIVE     ATURE WITH                  IODIN\r\n  GRAVITY.

The average data may be regarded as representing the properties\r\nof the ordinary pure commercial lard on the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Average Properties of Steam Lard.=--Below is given the average\r\ncomposition of eleven samples of steam lard furnished under affidavit\r\nand, apparently, as judged by their chemical and physical properties,\r\ncomposed solely of the fat of swine. Steam lards are not of as high\r\na quality as the lards contained in the preceding table. They have\r\nusually a distinctively strong odor, quite different from that of lards\r\nwhich are rendered in open kettles at low temperature and from selected\r\nportions of fat.\r\n\r\n                          RE-     RISE OF TEMPER-\r\n  SPECIFIC   MELTING   FRACTIVE     ATURE WITH                  IODIN\r\n  GRAVITY.

This compound, however, necessarily differs from the natural\r\nproduct in its physical and microscopic properties and in its reaction\r\nwith various chemicals which give distinct color with the different\r\nfats and oils used as adulterants.

They are mostly mixtures of lard and\r\ntallow stearin with cotton oil or cotton oil stearin.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the adulterations already mentioned as mixing with\r\ncottonseed oil may be added the use of coconut oil. It is not probable\r\nthat in the United States any adulteration of lard with coconut\r\noil has been made for commercial purposes. Such an adulteration,\r\nhowever, is practiced in some foreign countries. Coconut oil contains\r\nconsiderable quantities of volatile acid, and, therefore, when used as\r\nan adulterant of lard, would increase the normal quantity of volatile\r\nacid materially. One sample examined by Allen, of England, was found to\r\ncontain a quantity of coconut oil, amounting to 33 percent.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Summary.=--In the preceding pages has been given a description of the\r\ncharacter of lard, the sources from which it is made, the method of\r\nits preparation, its chemical and physical properties and the common\r\nadulterations to which it is subjected. There is no question of the\r\nwholesomeness of the usual fats and oils, or parts thereof, which are\r\nused in the sophistication of lards. The adulteration is intended\r\nsolely for fraudulent purposes, that is, to sell under the name of a\r\nhigher priced article one of a lower price.\r\n\r\nThere are many persons who prefer to use vegetable oils and fats as\r\nsubstitutes for lard in all cases. It is only fair to the consumer that\r\nthe character of a fat and oil, however, for edible purposes be plainly\r\nmade known to the purchaser. He is then to judge of the propriety or\r\nimpropriety of using the articles in question. It seems quite certain\r\nthat the use of vegetable oils and fats will be greatly increased in\r\nthis country. All hygienists grant that they are at least equally as\r\nwholesome as the animal fat and oil. They are certainly less open to\r\nsuspicion as having been derived from diseased sources. As a rule,\r\nthey are carefully expressed and properly refined, free from rancidity\r\nand from any mechanical or chemical constituents which render them\r\nunpalatable or unwholesome. They are generally much cheaper, perhaps\r\nthe only exception being that of olive oil. These vegetable oils, as a\r\nrule, are excellent for salad dressing, for frying and general cooking\r\npurposes and for the ordinary uses to which lard and other animal fats\r\nare devoted. A proper labeling of all such packages would increase the\r\nquantity consumed, restoring confidence to the public in the character\r\nof the goods purchased, and prove of mutual benefit to the grower, the\r\nmanufacturer and the consumer. It must be remembered, however, that\r\nthere are many people who prefer the animal fats, and so there will\r\nprobably always be a large field for their use. Such consumers are\r\nentitled to secure the pure article, properly prepared from healthy\r\nanimals and free from rancidity and organic impurities. Lard and other\r\nanimal fats offered in this way will have a greater vogue, command a\r\ngreater degree of confidence and secure a larger trade than if sold\r\nunder conditions engendering suspicion and distrust.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUPS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Classification of Soups.=--The soups which are commonly consumed are\r\ndivided into two great classes--those of animal and those of vegetable\r\norigin. Any liquid or semi-liquid preparation of a meat or vegetable\r\nor the two combined which may or may not carry particles of solid\r\nsubstances is classed with these preparations. Soups are generally used\r\nat the beginning of a meal, usually at dinner-time, and, as a rule,\r\ndo not have any very high nutritive value. That they have a useful\r\nfunction cannot be denied, since the introduction of a small quantity\r\nof a condimental and slightly nutritive warm liquid into the stomach\r\nat the beginning of dinner tends to stimulate the secretive glands of\r\nthe stomach walls to greater activity and thus to promote digestion.\r\nSoup should be regarded pre-eminently as a condimental and not as a\r\nnutritive substance.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Preparation of Stock.=--In the making of stock the base of the\r\nmaterial, as a rule, is that part of the meat and bone soluble in hot\r\nwater. The best way of preparing this stock is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe meat and bones selected should be fresh, free from all impurities\r\nand be derived solely from healthy animals as soon as they have\r\nbeen slaughtered. Inasmuch as the shape of the material used is of\r\nlittle consequence the parts of the carcass that are cut away in the\r\npreparation of the usual cuts of the marketable meats are utilized\r\nfor stock making. The flesh should be cut into fragments of proper\r\nsize and the bones broken up into small pieces. This material with the\r\nappropriate amount of water and salt is placed in a vessel capable of\r\nbeing closed in such a way that no aqueous vapor will escape, and a\r\nslight degree of pressure, equal to the half of an atmosphere, can be\r\nsustained. Simple forms of digesters are made for this purpose which\r\nare perfectly safe at low pressure and supplied with a safety valve\r\nso as to allow steam to escape if the pressure runs too high. Several\r\nhours of digestion are necessary for the preparation of stock, and if\r\nan ordinary vessel is used care must be exercised that the liquid does\r\nnot evaporate so as to make the mass dry. Stirring from time to time\r\nassists the solution of the soluble substances. After the extraction\r\nis complete the liquid contents are poured off and the solid material\r\npressed gently to separate the liquid held in solution. The mass\r\nis then put in a cool place and allowed to stand until thoroughly\r\ncooled and all the fat particles are collected at the top. The fat is\r\nthen removed and the resulting liquid strained to remove any solid\r\nparticles. The clear solution thus obtained is set aside and used as\r\nstock in the preparation of the various forms of soups. When properly\r\nflavored and used by itself it produces the soup known as consommé.\r\n\r\nThe soup stock made in this way usually contains not less than 95\r\npercent of water and not more than 5 percent of nutritive matter.\r\nMany of the clear soups prepared in this way contain very much less\r\nnutritive matter, sometimes as low as one percent. It is evident,\r\ntherefore, that the soup stock is valuable as a condiment and flavoring\r\nand not as a food.\r\n\r\nThe number of soups which can be made from soup stock is practically\r\nunlimited. They are formed by the admixture, chiefly of vegetables\r\ncut into small pieces, of starchy materials, mashed peas or beans,\r\nparticles of potato, fragments of parched bread, and in fact almost any\r\nnutritive and palatable substance which the cook may wish to employ.\r\n\r\nA soup made from a stock of the above description with pea flour was\r\nfound to have the following composition:\r\n\r\n  Water,                           88.26 percent\r\n  Protein,                          3.38    „\r\n  Fat,                               .93    „\r\n  Ash,                              1.13    „\r\n  Starch and other carbohydrates,   6.30    „\r\n\r\nA soup made with potatoes from stock of the above description was found\r\nto have the following composition:\r\n\r\n  Water,                           90.96 percent\r\n  Protein,                          1.37    „\r\n  Fat,                              1.53    „\r\n  Ash,                               .99    „\r\n  Starch and other carbohydrates,   5.13    „\r\n\r\nThe French make soups which are very well known and highly valued\r\nby cutting vegetables, such as carrots, beets, radishes and other\r\nvegetable substances, into small pieces and adding them to the soup\r\nstock.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Oyster Soup.=--A soup made of milk, cream, flour, condiments, oysters\r\nand the liquid of oysters is very largely eaten in the United States.\r\nThe difference between oyster soup and oyster stew is chiefly in the\r\namount of oysters employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Green Turtle Soup.=--A soup stock prepared as above described and\r\nflavored with pieces of green turtle is a very common dish.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mock Turtle Soup.=--A soup made in imitation of a turtle soup in which\r\nveal takes the place of turtle for flavoring is known as mock turtle\r\nsoup.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Clam Soup or Clam Chowder.=--This is a soup made of clams in the\r\nsame way that oyster soup is made. When the clams are cut into small\r\npieces and are in great abundance and when potatoes are used in large\r\nquantities in the mixture it is known as clam chowder.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Beef Extract.=--It is evident that a beef extract is only a soup or\r\na soup stock specially prepared from beef. Beef extract first became\r\nknown by the researches of the celebrated chemist Liebig, and has\r\npassed from a mere local preparation to an article which is important\r\nin commerce. Factories have been established in localities far removed\r\nfrom the principal markets of the world, but where cattle are extremely\r\nplentiful, as in South America, and the preparation of beef extract\r\nis carried on on a large scale, the meat of the animal being thrown\r\naway after the preparation of the extract. The method of preparing\r\nbeef extract is practically that described for making a soup stock\r\nunder pressure. Instead of using only the trimmings and refuse of the\r\nanimal, however, usually the whole of the flesh is employed. The bones\r\nare sometimes used in the making of a beef extract. The sound, fresh\r\nmeat is cut into small pieces and extracted under pressure as already\r\ndescribed. After cooking and filtering the product it is brought, in\r\nvacuo, to a proper consistence. Meat extract is, therefore, simply a\r\nconcentrated soup stock. It requires about thirty-four pounds of meat\r\nto yield one pound of concentrated extract, and this extract may be\r\ndiluted for consumption so as to make from six to seven gallons of\r\nbeef tea. The composition of the ordinary beef extract of commerce\r\nshows that it contains from 15 to 20 percent of moisture, from 17 to\r\n23 percent of ash and from 50 to 60 percent of meat bases, that is,\r\nthe soluble nitrogenous contents of meat. The bones and tendons are\r\nnot used in making beef extract on account of the introduction of\r\nconsiderable quantities of gelatine into the material. Liebig does\r\nnot recommend the presence of gelatine in beef extract because, being\r\ncheaper in quality, it is an adulteration of the genuine article, which\r\nshould contain only the pure bases and not the gelatinous principle of\r\nthe meat in the tendons and bones.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Character of Nitrogenous Bodies in Beef Extract._--When beef extract\r\nis prepared according to the Liebig method those nitrogenous bodies\r\ncommonly known as meat bases are found in the concentrated extract.\r\nIn a beef extract which contains a total of 9.28 percent of nitrogen\r\nthe quantity of nitrogen in the form of nitrogenous compounds which\r\nwere found therein is as follows: Nitrogen in the form of soluble\r\nalbumin,--trace; in the form of albumoses,--1.17; in the form of\r\npeptone,--trace; in the form of meat bases,--6.81; in the form of\r\nammonia compounds,--.47; in the form of unenumerated compounds,--.83.\r\nThe chief meat bases which form the principal part of the substance are\r\ncreatin, creatinin, xanthin, carnin and carnic acid.\r\n\r\nThere are many different forms of beef extract upon the market,\r\nsometimes called by fanciful names and sometimes by the name of the\r\nmanufacturer. Among the fanciful names are some which indicate origin\r\nor kind. The extracts which bear the names of the manufacturers are\r\nvery numerous, but all of these extracts are essentially of the\r\nsame character. One of these is a meat extract in which some of the\r\nmeat fiber is contained. The quantity of meat fiber which is used\r\nvaries, but is not very great. A comparison of the dry substance in a\r\npreparation of the class mentioned above with the dry substance in meat\r\nshows the following relation:\r\n\r\n                                      ASH AND\r\n            PROTEIN.  MEAT BASES.  MINERAL MATTER.\r\n            Percent.   Percent.       Percent.\r\n  Extract,    49.7       25.6           24.7\r\n  Meat,       86.7        7.8            5.3\r\n\r\nThe above data show that the extract is essentially different in its\r\ncomposition from dried meat and has added to it a large quantity of\r\nmeat fiber or the meat rendered soluble by some kind of treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nutritive Properties._--It cannot be denied that meat extract, as has\r\nbeen said in the case of soup stock, contains only a small part of\r\nnutritive matter. This nutritive substance is in a state of solution\r\nand probably is more readily absorbed than a similar amount of other\r\nnutritives in the form of ordinary meat. Its chief value as a nutrient,\r\ntherefore, is not in the amount of nutrient material which it contains,\r\nbut in the ease and speed with which it may become absorbed into the\r\ncirculation. In case of illness this is often a very important point.\r\nIt is not a question so much of the utilization of a large amount of\r\nnutrients as the absorption and assimilation in small quantities which\r\nwill sustain life until the disordered conditions disappear. For these\r\nreasons the meat extracts have a value. There is, however, little\r\ndoubt of the fact that in the popular mind a great deal more credit\r\nis given to meat extracts than should properly belong to them. They\r\nmust be regarded principally as condimental and incident to nutrition\r\nrather than as nutritive substances. The claims which are made by the\r\nmanufacturers are sometimes misleading, as, for instance, that one\r\npound of extract contains the nutritive properties of many pounds\r\nof meat. Such a statement, of course, is absurd upon its face and\r\nshould not be allowed to go unchallenged. Even when meat extracts are\r\nreinforced by the addition of soluble or comminuted fiber, as is often\r\nthe case, the quantity of nourishment is very small as compared with a\r\nsimilar weight of meat itself.\r\n\r\nIt is not intended by the above remarks to cast any discredit upon\r\nthe value of beef extract, as its value has been attested in numerous\r\ncases. It is only designed to call attention to the fact that as food\r\nthese extracts have comparatively little value. They may be useful\r\nas stimulants or as condimental substances or as a means of speedily\r\nintroducing a soluble nutrient in the case of disease where it is\r\nextremely important that even small amounts of nutritious material\r\nshould enter the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Beef Juice.=--A distinction is made between a beef extract and a beef\r\njuice. The latter term applies solely to the liquid naturally remaining\r\nin the fresh meat after its proper preparation for consumption, that\r\nis, after the withdrawal of the blood and the proper cooling and\r\nstoring of the flesh. The fresh meat is then subjected to strong\r\npressure and the juices which are extracted are concentrated in vacuo\r\nto the proper consistence. The meat of old bulls is often used. A true\r\nbeef juice must be extracted from the cold meat and not with the aid\r\nof heat, hot water or other solvents. It is difficult to preserve an\r\nextract of this kind without sterilization, and the heat required for\r\nsterilization is likely to coagulate some of the albuminous material\r\nwhich is expressed. It is a great temptation, therefore, in some cases\r\nto preserve the beef juice by a chemical preservative other than common\r\nsalt. Boric acid and sulfite of soda may be used for this purpose, but\r\nthese substances are objectionable on the score of possible injury to\r\nhealth. Glycerine is also used. Inasmuch as these juices are usually\r\ngiven to invalids or those whose digestive functions are impaired it is\r\nmost important that injurious substances should be omitted. In case of\r\npressure it is advisable, in some cases, to chop the meat very fine,\r\nand in this comminuted condition extract the juice with cold water.\r\nThis does not produce any change in the character of the juice and the\r\nwater is subsequently removed by evaporation at a low temperature in\r\nvacuo. Beef juices are usually prepared from heated meats.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Beef Juice._--The composition of beef juice from\r\ndifferent parts of meat which was previously heated externally is shown\r\nin the following table.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF BEEF JUICE AND MEAT EXTRACT.\r\n\r\n                                     BEEF      MEAT\r\n                                    JUICE.

They show that\r\nthere is less nitrogenous bodies present in meat juice than there is\r\nin meat extracts. It is evident that meat extracts cannot be heated\r\nfor sterilization without coagulation of the globulins. When it is\r\nadvisable to use a beef juice in a case of illness it is far better\r\nto prepare it at the time when it is used than to prepare it on a\r\ncommercial scale and preserve it by any of the chemical means in vogue.\r\nMeat juice can be very well prepared for domestic use by chopping\r\nthe meat very fine, placing it in a vessel, heating to 140° F., and\r\npressing it by any simple means, as, for instance, with the hand or by\r\nusing an ordinary lemon squeezer. The juice obtained in this way can\r\nbe flavored with salt and spices to suit the taste of the patient, and\r\nused immediately. In some cases, in order to get a greater yield, pure\r\ncold water may be mixed with the chopped meat and a somewhat dilute\r\njuice obtained but giving a greater yield of nutritive material for the\r\nsame weight of meat.\r\n\r\nVarious names, fanciful and otherwise, are given to the so-called beef\r\njuices. These names are either fanciful or, as in the case of beef\r\nextracts, that of the manufacturer. Some of the fanciful names are,\r\nlike those already mentioned, suggestive of origin. Some of these have\r\nlarge quantities of coagulable protein, like albumin, while others\r\nhave such small quantities as to indicate that they are not wholly\r\nbeef juice. In the case of some of these preparations there is some\r\nindication that they are prepared chiefly from blood and thus are not\r\ntrue meat juices. Naturally there must be particles of blood in a meat\r\njuice and the mere occurrence of blood cells would not be an indication\r\nthat blood itself had been used in its preparation. By reason of these\r\nfacts the use of so-called meat juices is restricted. They contain\r\nrelatively very little nutritive material, they are sometimes preserved\r\nwith harmful chemicals and they may be made from blood, and in general\r\nthere is such a degree of secrecy attending their preparation as to\r\nwarrant the physician and patient to confine themselves to the domestic\r\narticle prepared at the time of using. Another objection which is not\r\nof a hygienic character is found in the great expense of securing a\r\nvery little nourishment by this means. The quantity of juice which meat\r\nwill yield is very small and, therefore, the relative expense for any\r\ngiven quantity of nourishment is far greater than it is even in the\r\ncase of beef extract. While in the case of rich patients an objection\r\nlike this is of little value, in the great majority of cases it should\r\nbe given due consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Soluble Meats.=--Various attempts have been made to put soluble meats\r\nupon the market for use, especially for invalids and in cases of\r\ndisordered digestion. The principle which underlies the preparation\r\nof these meats is to subject them to a certain degree of artificial\r\ndigestion, by means of which the protein matter becomes converted\r\ninto soluble forms, either albumose, proteose or peptone. The\r\nprocess which is employed is a simple one, namely, the comminution of\r\nthe meat into as fine particles as possible and its admixture with\r\nhydrochloric acid and pepsin. It is then subjected to artificial\r\ndigestion until a considerable portion of the meat is soluble. Another\r\nmethod of preparation is to omit the pepsin and after the addition of\r\nhydrochloric acid to place the meat in a digestor where it is subjected\r\nto a temperature of steam under pressure for a considerable length\r\nof time. A goodly proportion of the meat becomes soluble under this\r\nprocess. After the preparation is completed the residual hydrochloric\r\nacid is neutralized by carbonate of soda, forming common salt, which\r\ngives the proper flavor to the compound.\r\n\r\nThe composition of soluble meat prepared in this way is given in\r\nthe following table (Foods and Principles of Dietetics, by Robert\r\nHutchinson):\r\n\r\n  Water,         67.21 percent\r\n  Fat,            5.93    „\r\n  Albumin,       11.00    „\r\n  Peptone,        6.51    „\r\n  Meat extract,   7.55    „\r\n  Ash and salt,   1.74    „\r\n\r\nA meat solution of this kind is not really a solution, since not only\r\nis that part which passes into solution contained in it, but also the\r\nresidual meat fibers which are not dissolved but so softened by the\r\nprocess that they lose their distinct form and can be rubbed up to a\r\nthick pasty mass. The product, therefore, consists not only of the\r\npart of the meat rendered thoroughly soluble in water by the process,\r\nbut also of a residual part, softened and reduced to a paste. The\r\nmass has practically the same nutritive value as an equivalent amount\r\nof meat with the claimed advantage that a large portion of it is\r\nalready soluble. This partial predigestion may be of value in cases of\r\ndisease or disordered digestion of any kind, but there is no reason\r\nfor believing that the healthy stomach requires any sort of artificial\r\npredigestion for the proper conduct of its functions. On the other\r\nhand, there is every reason for supposing that any kind of predigestion\r\nwhich is at all effective will in the end prove injurious to healthy\r\ndigestive organs by depriving them of a part of their normal functions\r\nand thus tending to bring them to a condition of feebleness which may\r\nresult in the omission, in part, of the normal functions of the vital\r\norgans.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Preparations of Blood.=--There is no doubt of the valuable nutritive\r\nproperties of blood and its preparations are sometimes used as foods.\r\nThere is a deep-seated prejudice against the use of blood as human\r\nfood, doubtless based on older and more effective grounds than even\r\nthe laws of health promulgated by Moses. Man is an animal of some\r\nrefinement of character and the sight or use of blood is repugnant to\r\nhis finer instincts. Sometimes blood is dried and powdered and the\r\nblood powder mixed with other food. Another method is to coagulate the\r\nblood, then remove the coagulated portion and use the residue for food\r\npurposes. This preparation, of course, contains no coagulable portions\r\nof blood, that is, the protein thereof known as fibrin. There is no\r\nreason for believing that preparations of blood will ever occupy any\r\nprominent position in the food supply, either of persons in health or\r\nof invalids.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Beef Tea.=--A very common food preparation from beef is that known as\r\nbeef tea. In all essential particulars beef tea is nothing more than\r\na rich unfiltered soup stock. Inasmuch, however, as it is constantly\r\nprescribed in many kinds of illness and is prepared under certain\r\nconditions it should be mentioned specially here in addition to the\r\npreparations already described. As in the case of meat juice, beef tea\r\nshould always be prepared in the home, and immediately before using.\r\nIt is a preparation which can not be properly made and kept without\r\nthe addition of some preservative which renders it totally unfit for\r\nhuman consumption. The very choicest portion of the beef should be\r\nselected in the preparation of beef tea and it should be reduced to a\r\nfine state of comminution. The removal of the fat and tendons should\r\nbe as complete as possible, as particularly the latter tend to add to\r\nthe extract more of the gelatine-like principles than is desirable. The\r\nfragments should be mixed with a sufficient quantity of cold water to\r\nmake the desired amount of beef tea, usually one pound of water to a\r\npound of comminuted beef is a good proportion. The mixture should be\r\nkept cold for a considerable length of time with frequent stirrings in\r\norder to extract as much as possible of the nitrogenous matter which\r\nbecomes coagulated by heating. Salt may be used not only to promote\r\nthe solubility but also to give the proper taste. After the lapse of\r\nan hour or more the vessel may be covered and gradually warmed. During\r\nthis warming the mass should be frequently stirred so to as promote the\r\nsolution. When finally the extraction is complete, before the tea is\r\nadministered it should be cooked, that is, heated to the boiling-point,\r\nby which process the soluble protein is coagulated but not hardened,\r\nand the material is rendered more palatable. The beef tea should be\r\nadministered without separating the coagulated fragments of albuminous\r\nmaterial, which is in a state easily digestible, and adds much to the\r\nnutritive value of the mixture. Finally the residue of beef may be put\r\ninto a bag and subjected to pressure to remove as much of the juice\r\ncontained therein as possible. The difference between beef tea and\r\nsoup stock, as will be seen, is largely in the filtering. The beef tea\r\nshould retain the coagulated flocks, while in the soup stock they are\r\nremoved. One pound of good lean beef and one pint of water yield about\r\none-half pound of good beef tea. As in the case of soup stock, beef\r\ntea is not a very nutritive substance. It is, however, stimulating,\r\nand the nourishment which it contains is quickly absorbed. The soft,\r\ncoagulated flocks of albumin are readily digested, and often a patient\r\nmay be nourished for days on a preparation of this kind when he is in\r\na condition which renders it impracticable to use either solid or other\r\nliquid foods.\r\n\r\nBeef tea is also made on a large commercial scale and with some degree\r\nof approximation to the home prepared article. For various reasons,\r\nhowever, which have already been advanced, a well made domestic beef\r\ntea which can be used as soon as prepared is to be preferred in all\r\ncases to the manufactured article. A beef tea properly made contains\r\napproximately the following composition:\r\n\r\n  Water,                             88.00 percent\r\n  Meat bases,                         3.50    „\r\n  Protein--soluble and flocculated,   8.00    „\r\n  Ash and salt,                       1.50    „\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dried and Powdered Meats.=--The preparation of dried meat has already\r\nbeen described. There has lately been placed upon the market a\r\nnumber of preparations dried and finely ground, under various names,\r\nfanciful and those of the manufacturer. Inasmuch as ordinary meats\r\nare largely composed of water, it is evident that if the water can\r\nbe removed without impairing the quality of the meat, great expense\r\nin transportation would be saved and the use of preservatives would\r\nbe unnecessary. Various attempts, therefore, have been made to place\r\ndried meats upon the market. The meat powders are not only offered\r\nin their natural state of desiccation but also are prepared with a\r\nmore or less previous digestion. One of the most common of these meat\r\npowders is known as somatose, which has been made in large quantities,\r\nand sold throughout all parts of the world. It consists largely of\r\nalbumoses rather than of peptones, but this is true of a great many\r\nof the so-called peptone preparations. The composition of somatose\r\nis represented in the following table (Allen’s Commercial Organic\r\nAnalyses, Vol. IV, page 384):\r\n\r\n  Water,                               14.25 percent\r\n  Albumin rendered soluble by alkali,  21.83    „\r\n  Albumin,                              3.40    „\r\n  Albumoses,                           33.96    „\r\n  Peptone,                              3.06    „\r\n  Meat bases,                           2.62    „\r\n  Ash and salt,                         5.30    „\r\n\r\nThe above data show that the meat still contains nearly 15 percent of\r\nmoisture and that an alkali has been used to render the protein more\r\nsoluble. This alkali has increased the quantity of mineral matter over\r\nthat which would naturally be present. Whatever may be the relative\r\nvalue of the prepared protein matter as compared with that in the\r\noriginal meat, it is seen that a large quantity of it, practically as\r\nmuch as was in the original meat, has been preserved in the finished\r\nproduct. Whether or not it is advisable to use a preparation of\r\nthis kind is a question to be left with the physician. It may be\r\nsaid unhesitatingly that in all cases of health somatose could not\r\npossibly present any advantage over fresh meat. On the contrary,\r\nfor theoretical and practical reasons, it is certain that it is less\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Composition of the Ash of Meat Juice and Meat Broth.=--The principal\r\nmineral component of the natural juice of meat broth or meat extract\r\nis phosphate of potassium, though there are also small quantities\r\nof magnesium and smaller quantities of calcium present. In addition\r\nto this there is a certain quantity of common salt present, which\r\nis determined, however, largely by the method of preparation. The\r\nfollowing analysis shows the composition of the ash of a meat juice to\r\nwhich little or no common salt has been added:\r\n\r\n  Potassium (K),           34.40 percent\r\n  Sodium (Na),              9.70    „\r\n  Calcium (Ca),              .36    „\r\n  Magnesium (Mg),           2.55    „\r\n  Phosphoric acid (P₂O₅),  27.00    „\r\n\r\nOther constituents are not determined in this analysis. The phosphate\r\nof potassium may therefore be regarded as the principal natural ash\r\nconstituent of meat extract and meat juice. (Zeitschrift für Biologie,\r\nVol. XII, 1876.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Adulteration of Meat Extract.=--The principal adulterations of meat\r\nextract have already been mentioned. The substances used in preserving\r\nit are of the greatest hygienic consequence. These are chiefly salt\r\nand glycerol or alcohol. The use of all of these substances is\r\nreprehensible. Fortunately they are seldom used. Another adulteration\r\nwhich has been practiced is mixing the meat extract with extracts\r\nof yeast. The extract of yeast has valuable dietetic properties and\r\ncontains the active principles of fermentation. It also resembles, in\r\nmany respects, physically and chemically, the extract of meat, and can,\r\ntherefore, be mixed with meat extract, and, being a cheaper article,\r\nforms a mixture which can be sold at a greater profit. The presence of\r\nyeast extract in meat extract can easily be determined by treating the\r\nmixture with a strong solution of sulfate of zinc and filtering. In\r\nmeat extract the filtrate obtained is always quite clear, but when a\r\nyeast extract is present the filtrate is turbid.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Active Principles Contained in Meat Extract.=--Attention has already\r\nbeen called to some of the more important active principles, namely,\r\nmeat bases which form a valuable portion of meat extract. There are\r\nvarious forms of nitrogenous bodies, however, besides meat bases,\r\nwhich become soluble naturally in meat or by the treatment of meat\r\nwith digestive ferments. Lean meat, as is well known, consists almost\r\nexclusively of protein matter and water. This protein matter is\r\nprincipally insoluble. Under the action of digestive ferments the\r\nprotein of meat becomes broken up into more soluble bodies, known as\r\nalbumoses, proteoses and peptones,--the latter being the final product\r\nof solution. These bodies are still true protein bodies containing the\r\nelements of sulfur as one of their essential constituents. The meat\r\nbases, on the contrary, contain the other elements that are in protein\r\nbut do not have the sulfur element. They belong to that class of bodies\r\nwhich is known as simple amido compounds. All of these bodies are mixed\r\ntogether in meat juice or beef extract, and it is an important task of\r\nthe chemist to separate them, both from an analytical point of view and\r\nthe determination of their relative abundance. There is also another\r\nsoluble or semisoluble protein substance in these extracts derived\r\nfrom the tendinous tissues and bones, namely, the gelatine or glue.\r\nThis is quite a common product, being the soluble protein procured by\r\nthe digestion of the tendons and bones. It is important, therefore,\r\nthat the chemist should distinguish between the gelatine and the amido\r\nbodies. There is also a true and a false protein form of these soluble\r\nbodies, the true one being formed by natural proteolytic ferments and\r\nthe false one being formed by heat or digestion under pressure of\r\nsteam. The chemist should also be able to distinguish between the true\r\nextract formed directly from the meat and the yeast extract used as an\r\nadulteration.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this manual to enter into the details of how\r\nthese different bodies may be distinguished from one another, as that\r\nis purely a chemical study. It is due, however, to the general reader\r\nthat some explanation be given of the different classes of bodies which\r\nare contained in these extracts.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Relation between the Price of an Extract and its Nutritive\r\nValue.=--The studies made in the Bureau of Chemistry show that there\r\nis little relation between the price of a beef extract and its real\r\nnutritive value. In three cases of extract which are all well known\r\nbrands and are of the thick or pasty variety, showing that a dissolved\r\nmeat had been added to them, the average weight of a package costing\r\n45 cents was only 55 grams, or nearly a cent a gram. In another three\r\nsamples of extract, also well known brands, of the same pasty variety\r\nand costing little more per package, it was found that the weight of\r\nthe more expensive variety was double that of the first, costing only\r\none-half cent per gram. In the case of the liquid extracts where no\r\npasty material is incorporated there is still greater variation in the\r\nrelation of the price to the nutritive constituents. An extract which\r\nretails for one dollar per bottle contains 91.69 percent of water and\r\nonly .42 percent of nitrogen. Another so-called meat extract which\r\nretails at 60 cents per bottle must have been wholly an artificial\r\nproduct, since it contained no creatin or creatinin at all. It was\r\nalso preserved by the addition of alcohol and contained an artificial\r\ncoloring matter.\r\n\r\nThe ash existing in these extracts is, of course, usually due to the\r\npresence of large quantities of common salt. Sodium chlorid is added\r\nto this extract without any definite rule at all and sometimes in very\r\nexcessive quantities. In some cases thirty percent of the total extract\r\nis composed of common salt. In other words, a person taking a solution\r\nof this kind would be injecting into his stomach a very concentrated\r\nbrine. When common salt may be sold at the rate of one dollar per\r\npound, the profit on the transaction is one which ought to make the\r\nbusiness exceedingly attractive.\r\n\r\nThe total phosphoric acid in the ash also shows variations, and if it\r\nwere not so easy to add artificial phosphoric acid the actual amount\r\npresent might be taken as a base by which quality could be judged.\r\nIn the natural extract the total phosphoric acid should be in the\r\nproportion to organic phosphoric acid as 10 to 1, which is the natural\r\ncondition in which it is found in meat extract. In many cases the\r\namount of inorganic phosphorus is so great as to render it certain that\r\na phosphate, probably the phosphate of soda, has been added. In another\r\ncase the quantity of organic phosphoric acid was very much greater than\r\ncould have possibly been the case in a natural product, indicating\r\nthe addition of lecithin or glycerophosphoric acid. The amount of fat\r\nin beef extract, when properly prepared, should be very small and\r\nshould certainly not exceed one percent, since by the proper method\r\nof preparation the fat is largely separated. In the pasty material,\r\nhowever, where the meat is reduced to a pulp and retained in the\r\npackage the amount of fat will be very much greater.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Nitrogenous Bases.=--The average nitrogen content of the pasty or\r\nsolid extracts varies from 6 to 9 percent. The nitrogen in the meat\r\njuice is subject to much greater fluctuation, depending largely on the\r\ncontent of solids. Although a high nitrogen content is not a guarantee\r\nof the character or mode of manufacture of an extract, it is naturally\r\nexpected and is desirable.\r\n\r\nThe addition of gelatine to extracts is now largely practiced and\r\nhas been for some years. By adding gelatine the manufacturer raises\r\nor maintains a certain nitrogen content, but supplies the nitrogen\r\nin a form lacking in all quickly stimulating qualities, and the\r\nnatural flavor of the meat extract nitrogen is lowered. The buyer\r\nis consequently deprived of the characteristic essentials of a beef\r\nextract although the nitrogen content is relatively high. In many\r\ncases only a small proportion of the original gelatine exists in the\r\nextract as such. The gelatine is converted by a gradual process of\r\nhydration into gelatoses and gelatine peptones. While the separation\r\nof gelatine from protein matter is a process in anything but a\r\nsatisfactory condition, it is a far simpler process than the detection\r\nand separation of gelatoses and gelatine peptones from albuminoses and\r\npeptones. The question has not been thoroughly studied up to date.\r\n\r\nThe question of adulteration of meat extracts with gelatine is not\r\nthe only form of adulteration we have to face. The mixing of varying\r\namounts of yeast extract with meat extracts is being practiced at\r\nthe present time in some countries. As we have not investigated this\r\nquestion, we cannot state whether it is practiced in this country at\r\nthe present time or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Kinds of Preparations.=--Meat preparations of the above types in\r\ngeneral may be divided into three classes, liquid extracts, pasty\r\nextracts and powdered extracts. In addition to the above, within the\r\nlast few years beef extract pellets, some of them being enclosed\r\nin gelatine capsules, have appeared upon the market. The old-time\r\nproduct of Liebig’s extract belongs to the second class, in which\r\nwe also find many of our best known brands. The liquid extracts are\r\nvaried and numerous and their number is rapidly increasing. The amount\r\nof meat extractives in some of these liquid products is remarkably\r\nsmall, the quantity of solids in two or three cases being under 10\r\npercent. Alcohol is sometimes met with in these liquid preparations.\r\nThe meat powders are far less numerous than the extracts of the first\r\ntwo classes. They consist largely, if not entirely, of albuminoses and\r\npeptones in addition to some insoluble proteid matter.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is necessary to distinguish between a meat extract\r\ncontaining large amounts of stimulating amido-acids and relatively\r\nsmall percentages of albuminoses, peptones and insoluble proteid matter\r\non the one hand, and, on the other hand, an extract, or, more properly,\r\na meat product, which consists largely of albuminoses, peptones and\r\ninsoluble matter and relatively small amounts of amido-acids. The food\r\nvalue of this last group of products is undoubtedly greater than that\r\nof the former group, but being sold as meat extracts, their value\r\nshould be based on the amount of extractives they contain and not on\r\ntheir food value.\r\n\r\nThe value of the amido-bodies, such as the meat bases, as food, is of\r\nuncertain character, but we must admit, as in the case of alcohol, they\r\ncan at least be burned and furnish energy to the body. Like alcohol,\r\nthe value of meat extractives lies principally in their stimulating\r\nqualities. The active principles of tea and coffee are on a similar\r\nbasis. As these simpler amido-bodies are the final links in the long\r\nchain of hydrolytic products of the proteid molecule prior to the\r\ncomplete resolution of that molecule into carbon dioxid, water, etc.,\r\nit is readily seen that an ounce of meat extractives (the various\r\namido-bodies) represents a far larger amount of beef than an ounce\r\nof albuminoses does. The various protein bodies and amido-acids are\r\nclosely interwoven and it is impossible to produce amido-acids without\r\nproducing albuminoses and peptones. Consequently, every commercial\r\nmeat extract must consist partly of albuminoses, peptones, etc. The\r\nbest of our extracts on the market to-day contain about 50 percent of\r\ntheir total nitrogen in the form of meat base nitrogen. When an extract\r\ncontains less than 5 percent of its nitrogen in the form of meat base\r\nnitrogen the term “extract” seems to be no longer applicable. It is\r\nevident that the product represents much less meat than an extract with\r\n50 percent of its nitrogen in the form of meat base nitrogen, provided\r\nthe total nitrogen in both cases is approximately equal.\r\n\r\nThe proteid matter coagulated by heating to boiling, as well as the\r\nproteid matter insoluble in cold water, are both undesirable factors\r\nin an extract of meat. As a rule, the lower the proportion of these\r\nconstituents, the higher the character of the meat extract. The same\r\nthing holds true in regard to the presence of albuminoses and peptones.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of total nitrogen in the form of meat base nitrogen in\r\nthe best extracts reaches 50 percent. In one of the poorest it is 3.82\r\npercent. The food value of the latter product might be greater than\r\nthat of the former, but its cost of manufacture and its stimulating\r\nvalue are much less.\r\n\r\nCreatin figures are very interesting and of much value in determining\r\nthe source and value of an extract. Creatin is the principal amido-body\r\nfound in meat, consequently we expect to find it or creatinin, its\r\nhydrated form, in still larger quantities in meat extracts. In several\r\ncases which came under our notice where the extract acted suspiciously,\r\nthe creatin values were nil, and in such cases grave doubts exist as to\r\nthe source of the extract. Our best extracts give high creatin as well\r\nas high meat base figures.\r\n\r\nThe xanthin bases and ammonia nitrogen figures present a variety of\r\nproblems. While the xanthin bases are desirable constituents, ammonia\r\nin any amount is not. It is questionable whether the ammonia figures\r\nobtained by the magnesium oxid method do not give too high results (W.\r\nD. Bigelow).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Gelatine.=--Gelatine is a substance obtained from the nitrogenous\r\nportions of bones, hide, horns, hoofs, connective tissue, tendons\r\nand other nitrogenous matter of the animal. One of the principal\r\nconstituents of these bodies is a substance known as collagen. When\r\nthis is heated either under pressure or without pressure it is changed\r\nto gelatine. Glue is unrefined gelatine or impure gelatine to which\r\nusually some substance has been added to increase its holding power.\r\nA type of gelatine known as isinglass is made from the bladders of\r\nsturgeons.\r\n\r\nThe general process of manufacturing gelatine is as follows (Whipple,\r\nTechnology Quarterly, Vol. XV, No. 2, June, 1902):\r\n\r\n“The hide scraps are first macerated and subjected to the action of\r\na solution of lime or caustic soda in pits for two or three weeks.\r\nThis dissolves most of the blood and saponifies the fats. The excess\r\nof lime or soda is then largely removed by washing and the solution\r\nsteamed to dissolve the gelatine, but an excess of heat is avoided.\r\nSulfurous acid is used to bleach the gelatine. When of sufficient\r\nstrength, the gelatine is allowed to harden in molds or on slabs, and\r\nis ultimately dried in sheets on wire nets. Bone gelatine is made in a\r\nsomewhat similar manner. The bones are crushed, boiled, treated with\r\nhydrochloric acid, and the gelatine is dissolved as before, washed,\r\nbleached and dried in sheets. The process requires a number of weeks.”\r\n\r\nGelatine is also made from bones, fresh as well as old, and from the\r\nresidues of bones used in the manufacture of buttons. The thin slices\r\nof the bones are treated with acid until all the phosphate of lime is\r\nextracted. They are then treated with lime and the gelatinous residue\r\nis then dissolved in warm water and purified for use.\r\n\r\nThe use of gelatine as a food has of late years become very common. The\r\nease with which it can be made into jellies, the consistence which it\r\ngives to ice-cream and its general utility in the cuisine have made it\r\ndeservedly popular. Gelatine is the product of some of the nitrogenous\r\nparts of the animal and should be made only from the edible parts\r\nthereof. It is particularly abundant in the tendinous portions of the\r\nanimal and in the tissues about the head, from which a large part of\r\nedible gelatine is made. No portion of the animal which is filthy or\r\nunfit for food should ever enter into the composition of the gelatine.\r\nIf the parts from which the gelatine are made are cured previous to\r\nmanufacture they should be cured in a perfectly sanitary way, as\r\ncarefully as any other part of the meat. There can be no objection to\r\nthe use of gelatine made from these sanitary materials in foods of all\r\nkinds.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a possibility that some of the gelatines on the\r\nmarket may be made from materials wholly unfit for food. The food law\r\nforbids the use of animal substances unfit for food either directly\r\nor indirectly. As an illustration of this condition of affairs I may\r\ncall attention to the fact that a part of the gelatines sold in the\r\nUnited States are made from parts of animals slaughtered in South\r\nAmerica. It is not known to the consumer in what conditions these parts\r\nare preserved and transported. They may be possibly packed with the\r\nhide and sent to Belgium or other countries in a filthy, putrid and\r\nabhorrent state and these parts be cut from the hides before they are\r\nsent to the tanneries and converted into gelatine and sold as edible\r\ngelatine. Such a possibility should not exist, and there is no danger\r\nof its existence with high class manufacturers. A part of the horns\r\nis also used for such purposes, which being of an inedible portion\r\nand unfit for food is not admissible, under the law, as a constituent\r\nof edible gelatine. All such materials should be excluded in the\r\nmanufacture of such an important product. Further than this, it may be\r\nstated that the line of demarcation between gelatine and glue is not\r\nalways as well drawn as it should be, and this is illustrated in the\r\nreport that the gelatine and glue are manufactured in the same factory,\r\nand the same conditions of odor and insanitation which adhere to glue\r\nmay attach themselves to the gelatine. Such a condition, of course,\r\nwould be an exceptional case, but its possibility should be excluded.\r\nUnder the food law only those forms of gelatine first described above\r\ncan be legally made and sold for use in food.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Gelatine._--The adulterations of gelatine are such as\r\nthose referred to above in the form of raw materials employed which\r\nare insanitary and unfit for food. In addition to this, bleaching\r\nagents, namely, sulfurous acid or sulfites and mineral acids, are\r\noften employed in the manufacture, portions of which may remain in\r\nthe finished article. All of these substances must be regarded as\r\nadulterants and as insanitary and unsuitable to gelatine, and to that\r\nextent unfit for human consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Presence of Tetanus in Commercial Gelatine._--The Public Health and\r\nMarine Hospital Service has investigated gelatine to determine whether\r\nor not it may be infected with pathogenic germs. The conclusions of\r\nthe investigation are as follows (Bulletin No. 9, Hygienic Laboratory):\r\n\r\n“Seven samples of gelatine examined; one showed tetanus spores.\r\n\r\n“Two samples showed an oval end-spore rod, whose identity was not\r\nproved, but, in stained specimens, it would be hard to distinguish from\r\ntetanus, if indeed not tetanus with diminished virulence.\r\n\r\n“In tetanus investigations it is important to use _freshly_ made\r\nbouillon, as the organism is apt not to germinate in bouillon over ten\r\ndays old. The thermal death point of the organism isolated was found to\r\nbe between twenty and thirty seconds at 100 degrees C.\r\n\r\n“It is important, therefore, that gelatine to be used for injections\r\nshould be boiled at least ten minutes on account of the variability of\r\nthe thermal death point in different species of tetanus. Whether this\r\namount of heating impairs in any way the hemostatic power of gelatine\r\nhas not been settled, but in case it does it is believed that the\r\ndanger from tetanus more than overbalances its therapeutic value.\r\n\r\n“It is suggested that when, as in hospitals, there is likelihood of\r\ngelatine injections being used for hemostatic purposes the gelatine\r\nsolution be sterilized by the fractional method on three successive\r\ndays and kept ready for use in sterile containers.”\r\n\r\nFrom the data given above it is seen that gelatine may become infected\r\nand the material from which it is made for edible purposes should be\r\nhealthful, sanitary and fit for food. It is not likely that tetanus\r\ngerms would prove dangerous when taken into the stomach, but freedom\r\nfrom infection should be secured if possible. These investigations\r\nshow the wisdom of the pure food law in forbidding the use of parts of\r\nanimals unfit for food, whether manufactured or not, in the production\r\nof food products. It is evident that a sufficient quantity of fresh,\r\nsanitary material or material properly preserved can be obtained in\r\nthis country or in other countries to supply the needs for edible\r\ngelatine without resorting to the use of inedible parts of hides,\r\nhorns, hoofs and other waste and unfit portions of the animal.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Summary.=--Above have been presented some of the principal meat\r\nfoods, the analytical data which show their composition, the processes\r\nby means of which they are prepared and the principal methods,\r\nobjectionable and otherwise, by which they are preserved.\r\n\r\nMeat is a staple article of diet among almost all nations of men. The\r\nanatomical structure of the human animal indicates that his environment\r\nhas adapted him to eating meats of all kinds. In other words, man is\r\nan omnivorous animal. He has been developed in an environment in which\r\nall kinds of meats and vegetables have ministered to his sustenance,\r\nand thus he is an omnivorous animal both by evolution and necessarily\r\nby heredity. That man can live and flourish without meat has been fully\r\nestablished by experiments, but that man cannot be nourished by meat\r\nalone has likewise been fully established, so that if the human race\r\nwere necessarily to be deprived either of animal or vegetable foods, it\r\nwould be the animal food which must be sacrificed.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this manual to discuss the relative merits\r\nof vegetarianism as compared with the common diet of the human race.\r\nIt may not be amiss, however, to say that probably in the United\r\nStates especially, a larger quantity of meat is eaten than is either\r\nnecessary or wholesome. The people of our country are better able to\r\nsupply themselves with expensive foods than those of other countries,\r\nand of the common foods meats are far more expensive than cereals. The\r\neating of larger quantities of cereals and smaller quantities of meat\r\nwould probably be conducive both to economy and health. It appears\r\nto be certain that the meat eating of the future may not be regarded\r\nso much as a necessity as it has in the past, but that meats will be\r\nused more as condimental substances than as staple foods. In all meat,\r\nfor instance, that costs 25 cents a pound, such as steaks, there is\r\nover one-third or a half of it which is inedible, so that the edible\r\nportion really costs double that amount. On the contrary, when a pound\r\nof flour or maize is purchased, the price of which is perhaps only\r\none-eighth that of meat, the whole of it is edible. Thus, from the mere\r\npoint of economy as well as of nutrition the superiority of cereals\r\nand other vegetable products is at once evident. On the one hand, a\r\ncereal is almost a complete food containing all the elements necessary\r\nto nutrition, and it costs only a few cents a pound. On the other hand,\r\na steak or roast is only a partial food and it costs much more than\r\ncereals.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that one purpose of this manual may be secured, namely, by\r\nshowing the consumer the actual composition of the different kinds of\r\nfood and their method of preparation he may be led in the selection of\r\nhis food to follow the dictates of science and economy to a certain\r\nextent rather than merely the impulse of taste. The eating of such\r\nlarge quantities of meat is merely a habit which often is developed in\r\nchildren through the carelessness and ignorance of parents, much to the\r\ndetriment of the child as well as to his future health and activity.\r\nIt is believed that if the true principles of the use of meat were\r\nproperly inculcated a large saving in the energy of the wage earner as\r\nwell as those in more affluent circumstances would be secured.\r\n\r\nSound principles of economy establish a better condition of health and\r\nlead to greater activity and fruitful labor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERRESTRIAL ANIMAL OILS.\r\n\r\nTerrestrial animal oils are obtained directly from parts of the animals\r\nwhich yield, at ordinary temperature, a substance which remains liquid.\r\nThe fats which are in the feet of the animals are usually more liquid\r\nthan in any other part of the body, and hence the natural animal\r\noils are derived largely from the feet. Among the most important\r\nare sheep’s foot oil, horse foot oil, and neat’s foot oil, which is\r\nobtained from the feet of cattle. These oils are all highly valued for\r\ntechnical purposes, especially for lubricating, and for this purpose\r\nbring a very high price. They are not used or should not be used for\r\nedible purposes, though they perhaps may sometimes be used in cooking.\r\nNeat’s foot oil, especially, on account of its high price, is often\r\nsubjected to adulteration, and is mixed for this purpose with cheap\r\nvegetable oils, such as cottonseed. Fish oil is also often used in the\r\nadulteration of neat’s foot oil, though the addition of any of these\r\noils to neat’s foot oil raises the iodin number to a very high degree,\r\nand hence this addition is easily detected by the chemist.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lard Oil.=--Lard oil is one of the most important of terrestrial\r\nanimal oils. It is made from lard by melting it and allowing it to\r\nslowly cool. The stearin in the product crystallizes first, and when it\r\nreaches a condition favoring the separation of the stearin the mass is\r\nsubjected to straining or pressure, whereby the olein or liquid portion\r\nof the oil is separated, and thus, having been freed from the most\r\nof its stearin, remains liquid at ordinary temperature. The residue\r\nis known as lard stearin and is largely employed in the preparation\r\nof lard to give it a higher melting point and in the manufacture of\r\noleomargarine.\r\n\r\nLard oil is used to some extent for edible purposes and is itself\r\nsometimes employed in the manufacture of oleomargarine when mixed with\r\ntallow or tallow stearin.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Properties of Lard Oil._--It is evident that the chemical and physical\r\nproperties of lard oil are determined by the completeness with which\r\nthe stearin is separated. Inasmuch, however, as the conditions of\r\nmanufacture are nearly constant, lard oil has characteristics of a\r\nphysical and chemical nature which do not vary greatly. The specific\r\ngravity of lard oil at 15 degrees is about .916, and its iodin number\r\nvaries from 68 to 75. When made of the best material it has a neutral\r\ntaste, not an unpleasant odor, and, therefore, can be used for edible\r\npurposes without introducing any characteristic odor or flavor into\r\nthe prepared food. In point of fact, however, it is not used to any\r\nextent for edible purposes except in the manufactured articles above\r\nmentioned. When carefully made and of the proper quality pure lard oil\r\nshould be practically free from free acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulterations._--On account of the high value of lard oil for\r\nlubricating and other purposes it has been subjected to extensive\r\nadulterations. The addition of cheaper animal oils or vegetable oils\r\nhas been largely practiced. Fish oil, blubber oil, and other marine\r\nanimal oils have also been freely used in the adulteration of lard\r\noil whenever the difference in price has rendered it advisable. These\r\nadulterations are of such a character that they can be detected only by\r\nthe skilled microscopist and chemist. The other animal oils, both of\r\nmarine and terrestrial origin, while important from a technical point\r\nof view, are of no significance in respect of edible qualities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nPOULTRY AND GAME BIRDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Application of Name.=--The term poultry for descriptive purposes may\r\nbe applied to those classes of feathered domesticated birds used for\r\nhuman food. It, therefore, includes practically all of the domesticated\r\nfowls. The term game bird, for the purpose of this manual, is applied\r\nto feathered animals which are wild and which are used for human food.\r\nThis also may apply to almost all wild birds, since at times they\r\npractically all have been used for food purposes. Here only those\r\nin common use, both domesticated and wild, will be referred to. In\r\nconnection with poultry the eggs of the birds will be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMESTICATED FOWLS.\r\n\r\nThe principal domesticated fowls which are used for human food are\r\nchickens, turkeys, geese, ducks, and guinea hens. The most common of\r\nall is the chicken,--the next perhaps are turkeys in this country and\r\nthe goose in Europe. The others are more infrequently used but are\r\nhighly prized.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Chicken.=--The chicken scientifically is known as _Gallus domesticus_.\r\nFor food purposes the chicken is eaten at various ages. The very young\r\nchicken is commonly called a broiler and is prepared for the table at\r\nvarying ages from six to twelve weeks. Young chickens are also very\r\ncommonly called spring chickens, since they occur in greater abundance\r\nin the spring than at any other time. Since the introduction of the\r\nmodern method of incubation, however, the spring chicken may be had\r\nat all seasons of the year. The “broiler” and “spring chicken” may be\r\nregarded as synonymous terms, though the larger chicks are usually\r\ncalled spring chickens instead of broilers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Full Grown Chickens._--The full grown chicken is better suited for\r\nfood when still young. The flesh loses flavor and gains in toughness as\r\nthe chicken grows older. There is no legal limit fixing the division\r\nof chickens into different classes with respect to age and the only\r\ncriterion is the price and taste of the consumer. There is, perhaps,\r\nno objection to the use of old chickens for food purposes, provided\r\nthey are not sold fraudulently as young chicks. The size and toughness\r\nof the pieces one often secures when ordering spring chicken is an\r\nindication that the age limit is not very definitely established. Both\r\nhens and roosters are used for food purposes, but especially the young\r\nroosters are devoted to food purposes while the young hens are often\r\nkept for the production of eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preparation of Chickens for Food Purposes._--In former times, when the\r\nchickens of commerce were derived chiefly from the farm, no special\r\npreparation was made before the chicken was marketed. The eggs were\r\nhatched in the old-fashioned way by the hens and the chicks sold\r\nto hucksters or in market, at various ages and without any special\r\npreparation or control. All this has been changed in later times by the\r\nintroduction of scientific methods of breeding poultry. It has been\r\ndemonstrated that the breeding and care of poultry require as much\r\nscientific and economic attention as is devoted to any other successful\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--CHICKEN HOUSE, RHODE ISLAND EXPERIMENT\r\nSTATION.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Incubator._--The introduction of the incubator for the hatching\r\nof eggs with the other necessary arrangements for the caring for young\r\nchicks has perhaps done more than any other one thing to revolutionize\r\nthe method of preparing poultry for the market. By the use of the\r\nincubator the hatching of chicks is regulated with the utmost degree\r\nof nicety. A larger percentage of eggs produce chicks and the expense\r\nof the incubating process is greatly diminished. The incubator is in\r\nits widest significance a thermostat in which the eggs may be placed\r\nand maintained constantly at the temperature of the hen’s body, namely,\r\nabout 102 degrees F. The arrangement of the chicken house and the other\r\nenvironments of the young chick are shown in Fig. 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Care of Young Chicks._--The principal points in the care of young\r\nchicks are fresh air, freedom from infection by epidemic or contagious\r\ndiseases, exclusion of insect pests, even high temperature, and\r\nabundance of food. The young chick is especially sensitive to low\r\ntemperatures and must be protected from cold, especially from cold\r\nrains. For this reason the chicks, after hatching, must be kept, if it\r\nis not summer time, in a room where the temperature can be regulated\r\nuntil they have acquired some degree of strength and vitality. The\r\ntemperature of the chicken house for the young birds should not be\r\nlower than 85 or 90 degrees F.\r\n\r\nA temperature of about 102 degrees F. is found very favorable to the\r\ndevelopment of the chicks in the eggs, although the temperature may\r\nsometimes fall to 101 or rise to 103 degrees F. without materially\r\naffecting the results. Experiments show that too low a temperature\r\narrests the development of the chick. On the contrary there seems to\r\nbe no indication that an increase of heat, up to 103 degrees F., has\r\nany tendency to kill the chick in the last stages of development. It\r\nis found best in all cases to set the eggs in the incubator as soon\r\nafter they are laid as possible. Where the age of the egg is not known\r\nit should be carefully candled, that is, held up between the eye and\r\na light in order to determine its condition. In old eggs, the yolk,\r\non candling, becomes more or less diffused with the white and such\r\neggs are to be rejected for incubator purposes as they are not likely\r\nto produce chickens. The fertility of the egg must also be assured\r\nbefore placing in the incubator. An unfertilized egg is so much loss in\r\nthe incubator since it might have been used for food purposes, since\r\nthe egg, for marketable purposes, when fresh is just as good as a\r\nfertilized egg. It is an observed fact that the complete fertilization\r\nof the egg, that is, the proper union of the male and female germ\r\ncells, is not always complete at the time the egg is laid, but the\r\nmingling of the two elements takes place under proper conditions\r\nafterwards. The development will also depend upon the vitality of\r\nthe germ and its component parts. Just, for instance, as the color\r\nof the feathers, the size of the body and the general character of\r\nthe chick may be inherited from either parent, so the vital qualities\r\nare much more strongly shown in some eggs than in others. The proper\r\ngermination of the egg may also be improved by many of the conditions\r\nof environment. In the case of eggs, any slight change which would\r\ninterfere with the functions of the yolk or albumin, both of which\r\nare extremely sensitive to change, would interfere with the growth of\r\nthe embryo either by depriving it of food or subjecting it to other\r\nconditions in which its vitality would be diminished or destroyed.\r\nThe fertilized egg may be separated from the non-fertilized also by\r\ncandling. At the Rhode Island station it is found that a very good\r\nlight for candling is the ordinary calcium carbide bicycle lamp, placed\r\nin a proper candling box. This is a strong white light quite equal in\r\npower to the electric incandescent light and is not so trying to the\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nWhen eggs which have been submitted to incubation permit light to\r\nshine through and show the yolk suspended in the upper half of the\r\ncenter as a clearly defined mass, which quickly reassumes its position\r\nin turning the egg with its long axis nearly horizontal, they are\r\nprobably infertile or sterile. When, on the contrary, the yolk assumes\r\nindefinite outlines, approaching near the upper portion of the shell\r\nat the large end or appears with a thick spur upon its upper side, it\r\nmay be regarded as having started to incubate. In the later stages\r\nthe embryo can be plainly seen, because it becomes opaque and cuts\r\noff more of the light. In the incubation of eggs the candling is\r\nresorted to during the first few days of the experiment in order\r\nthat the unfertilized eggs may be separated. The best time for the\r\ncandling, if it is practiced only once, is on the sixth or seventh day\r\nof incubation. By that time all the eggs which are fertilized will\r\nbe so changed as to be easily recognized by the candling process.\r\nExperience has shown that eggs which are more than two weeks old are\r\nnot profitable for use in incubators since the percentage that does not\r\nhatch is so large. The incubating part of the plant is sometimes placed\r\nin the cellar over which the brooding house is built.\r\n\r\nThe brooding of young chicks is of the utmost significance. In Europe\r\nthe changes in temperature are much less violent than in this country.\r\nThe principal brooding houses in the United States are in the North\r\nwhere the temperature often falls in winter to below zero while in the\r\nsummer it may rise to blood heat, a difference of over 100 degrees F.\r\nFor this reason the incubating houses in the United States are often\r\nplaced in cellars where the uniform conditions of temperature are\r\nmore easily secured. There is no objection to this location provided\r\nproper care be taken to secure ventilation and the proper content of\r\nmoisture in the atmosphere. In Great Britain the incubating houses\r\nare usually placed above ground instead of in cellars. The mean range\r\nof temperature in an incubating room in Great Britain, from March\r\n12, 1903, to March 30, 1904, was 10 degrees. The highest temperature\r\nregistered was 70 degrees on the 24th of June and the lowest 42 degrees\r\nin January. The humidity of the air was also quite constant, the lowest\r\ndegree of humidity being 59 and the highest 94. These data show a very\r\neven temperature in the room itself. Of course the temperature in the\r\nincubator is necessarily greater, being that already referred to,\r\nnamely 102 degrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Early Market._--One principal object in the raising of chicks is to\r\nforce them to an early maturity in so far as size and palatability\r\nare concerned. The sooner the young broilers can be made ready for\r\nthe market the more economy there is in their production. To this end\r\nthey ought to receive a more abundant and specially prepared kind of\r\nfood than if they were intended for ordinary farm purposes. In other\r\nwords, the forcing process should be pushed as far as possible without\r\ninterfering with the health and normal functions of the bird. Foods\r\nwhich are nutritious and stimulating and promote vigorous growth\r\nshould be employed. Birds prepared in this way for the market are\r\nextremely tender and palatable and bring the highest prices where their\r\nmerits are recognized.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Artificial Feeding._--Where chickens of greater age are prepared for\r\nthe market they are subjected, during the last two or three weeks\r\nprevious to sale, to a forcing process in order to produce more fat and\r\nmake their flesh more palatable. To this end the chickens are fed from\r\ntime to time mechanically by passing a tube into the craw and forcing\r\nthe food therein. Fowls prepared in this way bring high prices in the\r\nmarket and the largest profits to the growers. It is a method, however,\r\nwhich is not used in the raising of the ordinary poultry found on the\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preparing Chickens for the Market._--Chickens are sold in four\r\ndifferent conditions in the markets of this country. First, they are\r\noffered alive. A great many purchasers prefer to get their poultry in\r\nthis way because they can then be certain that it has not been long\r\nkilled and kept in cold storage or preserved by means of chemicals. It\r\nis a very common custom for consumers to have their own chicken coups\r\nand buy a number of birds at a time and fatten them particularly for\r\ntheir own use. Under the present system of law this method is highly\r\nto be commended as a certain way of knowing the age of the poultry\r\nconsumed. With proper municipal and state regulations of the markets\r\nit would not be necessary for the consumer to go to this trouble since\r\nwhen rigid inspection and certification are established, the age of the\r\nchicken offered on the market can be easily ascertained. Until such\r\ntime comes, however, on the part of the consumer, the desirability of\r\nsecuring chickens alive cannot be denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Freshly Killed Chickens._--Chickens which have been killed within\r\ntwenty-four or forty-eight hours and properly kept may be regarded\r\nas freshly killed. There is a very wide-spread opinion, and probably\r\nfounded on reliable experiments, that fowls are better if they are kept\r\nsome time after slaughter, provided they are kept in a proper way. In\r\nthe winter time it is customary, especially in Europe, to hang the fowl\r\nfor a week or ten days exposed to the ordinary temperature, before\r\nconsumption. This, of course, is a practice which could not be indulged\r\nin in warm weather. Fowls, however, can be hung in cold storage even in\r\nthe summer time and with the same advantage which accrues by hanging\r\nthem in ordinary temperature in the winter time. Just how long fowls\r\nshould be kept after slaughter in this way in order to secure a maximum\r\ndegree of palatability has not been scientifically determined. There is\r\nevidently a limit beyond which the keeping of slaughtered fowls should\r\nnot be indulged in. If a low and even temperature could be secured it\r\nmay be certain that the hanging of the fowl for a week or ten days is\r\nnot too long. The temperature, however, should not be much above the\r\nfreezing point.\r\n\r\nFreshly killed chickens are offered in two forms, namely, drawn and\r\nundrawn. The proper method of keeping a slaughtered chicken has\r\nbeen the subject of very lively discussions. There are many who\r\nare advocates of the exposure of the chicken in the undrawn state\r\nasserting that in this condition it is less exposed to infection and\r\nkeeps better during the necessary time elapsing between slaughter\r\nand consumption. This argument is advanced chiefly by dealers. On\r\nthe other hand the consumer, as a rule, is in favor of having the\r\nchicken drawn before it is exposed for sale, that is, as soon as it is\r\nslaughtered. There is perhaps much to be said on both sides of this\r\nquestion. If, however, chickens are to be secured by the consumer\r\nwithin forty-eight hours after slaughter there can be no very great\r\ndanger of infection by having them undrawn. The subject is one of\r\nsufficient importance to warrant an extended scientific investigation\r\nand upon this investigation the municipal and state regulations for\r\nthe sale of poultry can be based. It is not wise in such cases to be\r\nswayed solely by prejudice or sentiment but rather by the facts which\r\ncan be ascertained by unbiased scientific investigation. Because a\r\nchicken weighs more undrawn is probably one of the reasons why dealers\r\nprefer them in this state. It may be said, too, that the intestinal\r\norgans are so impenetrable to the diffusion of their contents as not to\r\ncreate any danger of contamination by remaining in the undrawn state.\r\nOn the contrary, the keeping of chickens with the intestinal contents\r\nundisturbed does not appeal to the imagination of the consumer any more\r\nthan the freezing of the carcass of a beef or hog with the viscera\r\nremaining would appeal to the consumer. If the carcass of a chicken can\r\nbe better kept undrawn it is evident that the carcass of a steer or hog\r\ncan also be better kept if subjected to the proper temperature. Upon\r\nthe whole it appears that the safer way would be to have the poultry\r\ndrawn at the time of slaughter and delivered to the consumer at an\r\nearly date thereafter. In this way all danger of infection on the cut\r\nsurfaces becomes avoided. At any rate the consumer should be allowed\r\nthe choice in the matter which, at the present time, is not the case in\r\nmany parts of this country where only undrawn poultry is exposed for\r\nsale.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Poultry in Cold Storage._--Whenever a fowl is kept for a longer\r\nperiod than the week or ten days above referred to for the purpose\r\nof improving its flavor and palatability it is necessary that it be\r\nplaced in cold storage. This method of keeping poultry or other foods\r\nis wholly unobjectionable unless carried to excess. Poultry is a food\r\nproduct which under the present scientific methods of production can\r\nbe furnished in a fresh state all the year. The necessity for cold\r\nstorage, therefore, is not so apparent in this case as in that of\r\nfruit and other perishable foods. It appears then that cold storage\r\nonly should be extended to that limit necessary to secure its delivery\r\nto the consumer. There can scarcely be any excuse for the placing\r\nof poultry in cold storage at certain seasons of the year when they\r\nare slightly less in price by reason of the abundant production than\r\nat other seasons. The methods of producing poultry are such at the\r\npresent time that this excess in supply can easily be avoided on the\r\npart of the producer and thus maintain an even price and an even supply\r\nthe year round. The producer as well as the consumer is benefited by\r\nsuch a condition. The necessity, often, for cold storage in the limited\r\nsense above referred to is acknowledged by all and a reasonable degree\r\nof time in cold storage cannot be regarded as in any way measurably\r\nharmful with reference to the character of the product. It is probable\r\nthat as long as four or six months may be regarded as a justifiable\r\nlimit for securing a proper market for poultry in cold storage though\r\nthe exact length of time in which it may be left in cold storage will\r\nbe determined only by careful scientific investigation. There seems\r\nto be no necessity whatever for carrying fowls for a longer period\r\nand especially, as has been known, for a year or even two years. The\r\ndeterioration, even if the temperature is far below the freezing point,\r\nis very marked during these long periods of time and actual danger\r\nmay accrue to the consumer in the possible development of poisonous\r\ndegradation products in the flesh. Municipal, state, and national\r\nregulations should be of a character to inform the consumer of the\r\nexact length of time which the poultry he proposes to purchase has been\r\nin cold storage. This is the least which the consumer has the right\r\nto know and is a right which the producer and packer should concede\r\nwithout discussion. The unwillingness which has been manifested on the\r\npart of dealers in poultry to make public the length of time which\r\nit has been in cold storage is of itself a suspicious condition. The\r\nargument is constantly heard that the length of time poultry has been\r\nin cold storage does not impair its palatability or wholesomeness. If\r\nthis be true then a statement of the length of time cannot in any way\r\ninjure the market. But to this reply is made to the effect that if the\r\nconsumer is told the fowl has been in cold storage a certain length\r\nof time he will not purchase it. To this the evident answer is,--why\r\nshould you deceive the consumer by selling him an article which if he\r\nknew its character he would not buy? It is evident that such deception\r\nis nothing more nor less than obtaining money under false pretenses.\r\nThe remedy for the evil of cold storage is the label which will\r\nindicate the length of time which has elapsed since the slaughter of\r\nthe fowl.\r\n\r\nThere is, perhaps, no greater blessing which has been conferred upon\r\nmankind during the last quarter of a century than the development of\r\ncold storage methods of preserving food. The continued prosperity\r\nand benefits of this business depend upon a thorough study of the\r\nconditions attendant thereon and the elimination of any evil which may\r\nbe incident thereto. When this is accomplished the absolute confidence\r\nwhich the consumer will have in cold storage will be such that the\r\nmagnitude of the business will be immensely increased. Thus the\r\ninterests of the consumer and the dealer are one and they should work\r\ntogether to promote their common good.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the White Meat of a Chicken._--The meat of a chicken,\r\ncarefully prepared in the laboratory of the Bureau of Chemistry,\r\nwas analyzed by separation into the white and dark portions. The\r\ncomposition of the two meats is as follows:\r\n\r\n                         WATER IN\r\n                         FAT-FREE                         MEAT\r\n               WATER.   SUBSTANCE.    FAT.    PROTEIN.   BASES.\r\n              Percent.   Percent.   Percent.  Percent.  Percent.\r\n  White meat,  61.38      75.08      18.25     17.06       .37\r\n  Dark meat,   59.48      78.44      24.16     15.94      1.03\r\n\r\nThe above data show that there is a notable difference in the\r\ncomposition of the white and the dark meat. The white meat has much\r\nless fat and a correspondingly larger quantity of protein. The quantity\r\nof water in the two classes of meat is not very different although\r\nthere is a slightly less quantity in the dark meat. The dark meat has\r\na much larger proportion of meat bases but as these bases are often\r\nconsidered of little value and sometimes degenerate into poisonous\r\nconstituents it is seen from this point of view that the white meat is\r\nto be preferred to the dark meat.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preserved Chicken._--Practically the only methods of preserving\r\nchickens are the canning processes which have already been described\r\nand cold storage. Chickens may be canned in the same way as has been\r\ndescribed for beef and in that way may be kept for a certain length\r\nof time without notable deterioration. The pickling of chicken is not\r\nvery extensively practiced nor is it cured in the ordinary sense of the\r\nword, that is, by the addition of salt, sugar, vinegar, spices, and\r\nwood smoke. Chicken may also be put up in the form of potted chicken,\r\nwhich has already been described. Practically the only methods which\r\nare in vogue and which can be commended for preserving chicken are\r\nsterilizing or canning and cold storage. These methods, when not unduly\r\nprolonged, are open to no reasonable objection. The preserving of\r\nchickens with spices and condiments may also, perhaps, be considered as\r\ndesirable provided no harmful chemical preservatives are employed. The\r\ntemptation, however, to employ such preservatives is so great as not to\r\nbe always resisted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Potted Chicken and Turkey._--Perhaps there is no other\r\nform of potted meat, with the possible exception of pâté de foie gras,\r\nwhere such an opulent field for sophistication is found as in the case\r\nof potted chicken and turkey. The average composition of ten samples of\r\nalleged potted chicken and turkey, found upon the market, is shown in\r\nthe following table:\r\n\r\n  Water,                        58.52 percent\r\n  Water in fat-free substance,  71.24    „\r\n  Fat,                          17.98    „\r\n  Protein,                      19.12    „\r\n  Meat bases,                     .96    „\r\n  Glycogen,                       .26    „\r\n  Total ash,                     2.67    „\r\n  Of which sodium chlorid,       1.05    „\r\n\r\nAll but one of the ten samples contained starch but not in very\r\nconsiderable quantities, the largest amount being 4.13 percent.\r\n\r\nNone of the samples contained saltpeter. This is an interesting point\r\nbecause of the claim of the packers that saltpeter is used solely for\r\npreservation purposes. When a meat is expected to be of a white color\r\nno saltpeter is found while, on the contrary, where the meat is of a\r\nred character it is frequently found. Tin was present in four samples,\r\ndoubtless due to some contamination with the solder or by corrosion\r\nof the tin can itself. Where tin is present due to the corrosion of\r\nthe can itself it is always in greater abundance in the old than in\r\nthe newly canned sample. It is quite certain that the contents of\r\nthese packages were not made up of chicken and turkey exclusively. The\r\ncharacteristic odor and taste of smoked meats which are found in these\r\npackages would indicate that they are used to give flavor and aroma\r\nto the mixture. The addition of flavoring materials of this kind, or\r\n“force” meats as they are sometimes called, is not objectionable from\r\nany sanitary or dietetic point of view. It is, however, an offense\r\nagainst an ethical principle which must be closely followed in a case\r\nof this kind if the doors of fraud and adulteration are not to be left\r\nwide open. This principle is that no false idea by inference, omission\r\nor otherwise, should be conveyed to the consumer by the label. Some\r\nform of expression for potted meat should be used in which the label\r\ngives the principal or dominant meat in the mixture, accompanied by\r\nthe statement that it is a mixture with other meats also named, spiced\r\nand flavored. Under the present condition of affairs a manufacturer\r\nwho really wishes to put into potted form chicken and turkey with\r\nonly spices and condiments has to undergo an unfair competition with\r\nanother manufacturer who uses the same label and reduces the quantity\r\nof expensive meat to a minimum or may possibly leave it out altogether.\r\nUnder the new food law this unfair competition will be prevented.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Chicken._--The flesh of chicken is not subjected\r\nto any very extensive adulterations. It has been claimed that\r\npreservatives are applied externally to fresh fowls but the evidence\r\non this point is not very conclusive. There is, perhaps, little doubt\r\nthat other methods have been practiced but probably without any very\r\ngreat vogue. The use of chemical preservatives in potted chicken is\r\nalso reprehensible. In general it may be said that there is no very\r\nextensive adulteration of chicken meat. The principal objection to the\r\ncommerce in preserved chicken meat is the use of old chickens, the\r\nunlimited cold storage, the failure to draw at time of slaughter, and\r\nexposure in the market in an unsanitary condition and for an indefinite\r\ntime. Cheaper meats are sometimes substituted for the genuine article\r\nin potted chicken. Turkey and pork are said to be used in chicken salad.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Capons._--The castration of the male bird produces the capon, the\r\nflesh of which is very highly valued as being superior to that of\r\nthe male or female chicken. Capons are much more extensively used in\r\nEurope than in the United States but are gradually coming into favor\r\nin this country. It is difficult to describe the difference between\r\nthe taste of the flesh of the capon and the rooster and hen. A greater\r\ndegree of tenderness and a more delicate taste characterize the flesh\r\nof the capon. In France, especially, the production of capons has\r\nbeen carried to its highest perfection. Caponizing should be practiced\r\nat an early date in the life of the young bird. In fact, as soon\r\nas the distinction in sex is well marked in the young chicken the\r\nremoval of the testes should take place. The young fowl is laid upon\r\nits left side and the skin is exposed by pulling back the feathers\r\nand trimming them off at the proper place until the space between the\r\nfirst and second ribs of the right side is laid bare. An incision is\r\nthen carefully made and the testes removed by instruments particularly\r\nadapted for that purpose. The operation should be done by an expert\r\nalthough theoretically it appears easy of accomplishment. In practice,\r\nhowever, it requires an expert to avoid any injury to the bird and to\r\ninsure a speedy recovery. When done in the proper way, apparently no\r\ngreat inconvenience attends the operation. There is little blood shed\r\nand usually no inflammation when the proper antiseptic measures are\r\nprovided.\r\n\r\nThe capon develops a bird that apparently has little to do except\r\ngrow fat and prepare itself for the market. The caponized bird often\r\ndevelops brooding instincts and when eggs are hatched by the heat of\r\nthe bird the capon makes a better brooder than the hen because of\r\nthe greater spread of the wings and the larger number of eggs that\r\ncan be covered in the operation. The larger breeds of birds make the\r\nbest capons such as the brahmas and plymouth rocks. The capons are\r\nfattened and prepared for the market as in the case of other birds.\r\nWhen skimmed milk is made a large portion of the diet the flesh is\r\nconsidered to be of greater value. The best age for marketing a capon\r\nis at about twelve months. At that time they have attained their full\r\nsize and their maximum degree of excellence as a food bird. The feeding\r\nshould be done upon the principles already described, namely, to keep\r\nthe birds growing in the usual way until about three or four weeks\r\nbefore the market when the extra food is given in as large quantities\r\nas possible for quick fattening. In Europe this extra food is usually\r\ngiven mechanically under the forced system though in this country the\r\nmechanical method of feeding capons has not generally been introduced.\r\n\r\nCapons bring a higher price upon the market than the other varieties of\r\nchicken, sometimes the difference being as much as four or five cents a\r\npound. For this reason the growth of capons becomes more profitable to\r\nthe farmer than that of the ordinary chicken.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Duck= (_Anas boschas_).--The domesticated duck is used very largely\r\nfor food in all parts of the world. Its flavor is not so highly prized\r\nas that of the wild duck but it is an excellent article of diet. The\r\nproduction of ducks is conducted in the same manner as the production\r\nof poultry in general. They are still chiefly grown upon the farm\r\nwithout any special care but the best results are obtained by the\r\nsystematic growth of ducks under scientific conditions in poultry\r\nhouses. The duck is not so extensively used for food as the turkey and\r\nchicken but perhaps in this country much more extensively than the\r\ngoose. The price of the wild duck, however, is still sufficiently low\r\nto limit to a certain extent the production of the domesticated article.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Varieties of Ducks._--There are many varieties of ducks cultivated for\r\nthe market. The Pekin is perhaps the most abundant of all. It is creamy\r\nwhite in color, has a long and graceful body and has been particularly\r\nbred for the market. When ready for the market the average weight of\r\nthe drake is about eight pounds and the duck seven. The Aylesbury is\r\nalso a favorite variety. It is said to be somewhat whiter than the\r\nPekin in color. It is specially valued in England as a market duck.\r\nIt is somewhat larger than the Pekin. Other varieties of ducks are\r\nthe Rover, the Cayuga, the Gray and White Call, the East Indian, the\r\nCrested White, the colored and white Muscovy, and the Indian runner.\r\nThe latter is a very small duck, being only about one-half the size of\r\nthe Pekin. Usually the ducks on the market are not designated by any\r\nparticular variety and, in fact, most consumers are not sufficiently\r\nacquainted with the different varieties of duck to be able to ask for\r\nany particular one. The mallard, canvas-back, and teal are common\r\nvarieties of the wild duck.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Flesh of Ducks._--The flesh of two varieties of\r\nducks, namely the Pekin duck and the Mallard duck, was carefully\r\nseparated in the Bureau of Chemistry and subjected to analysis. The\r\ncomposition of the meat of these two ducks is shown in the following\r\ntable:\r\n\r\n                           WATER IN\r\n                           FAT-FREE                         MEAT\r\n                 WATER.   SUBSTANCE.    FAT.    PROTEIN.   BASES.\r\n                Percent.   Percent.   Percent.  Percent.  Percent.\r\n  Pekin duck,    47.46      78.20      39.31     13.37      .43\r\n  Mallard duck,  69.06      75.98       7.11     19.25      .65\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above data show a striking difference between these two varieties\r\nof ducks. The Pekin duck has a large excess of fat while the Mallard\r\nduck, which is a wild duck and evidently not very fat, has a small\r\npercentage of fat and a large percentage of protein. It is evident\r\nthat the flesh of wild fowl would not, except at a certain season of\r\nthe year, approach that of domesticated fowls in the percentage of fat\r\nwhich it contains.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Goose= (_Anser anser_).--The goose is not so commonly used as a food\r\nproduct in this country as in Europe,--the turkey to some extent has\r\ntaken its place. The remarks which are applicable to the production of\r\nchickens are also applicable to the production of geese. They, perhaps,\r\nare grown more extensively in the old-fashioned way in this country\r\nthan chickens or turkeys at the present time since they are used\r\nchiefly for the feathers which they produce and not for food. Goose is\r\nalso considered a winter dish both in this country and in Europe. It\r\nis customary in Europe that the goose be hung even for a longer period\r\nbefore consumption than the chicken. Its flesh is made more tender and\r\nmore palatable by this preliminary exposure. From one to two weeks is\r\nnot considered too long a time in the winter for hanging in the old\r\ncountry. The remarks relative to cold storage of turkey and chicken\r\napply also to the goose. The goose is, perhaps, the most easily\r\nartificially fattened of any other poultry birds. This is especially\r\ntrue in those regions where fatty goose livers are so highly prized in\r\nthe manufacture of _pâté de foie gras_. By long-continued artificial\r\nfeeding the goose is made excessively fat and the liver especially\r\nis changed in its composition by this treatment so as to make it\r\npeculiarly suitable for the production of this delicacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Varieties of Geese._--The varieties of geese upon the market comprise\r\nthe following leading breeds. The Toulouse is perhaps the most\r\nextensively raised. It is highly prized on account of its hardihood,\r\nits size and the general appearance of its body. It is of a gray to\r\nwhite color and the wings are a deeper gray or brown. The legs are\r\nusually of a deep orange. When ready for the market the average weight\r\nof the gander is 20 pounds and the goose 18. Of the other common\r\nvarieties there are the Embden, the African, the brown and white\r\nChinese, the white or Canada, and the Egyptian. The latter is a small\r\ngoose only weighing about half as much as the Toulouse when ready for\r\nthe market. The wild goose is highly esteemed as a game bird.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Feeding of Young Geese for the Market._--The feeding of geese for\r\nthe market begins as soon as the hatching is complete. The first meal\r\nof the young chicks consists of oat meal, middlings, finely chopped\r\ndandelions, lettuce or some similar green stuff, and milk. The goslings\r\nduring the first week are kept indoors and should be fed four or five\r\ntimes a day on the mixture above named. After this they may go into\r\na yard where there is plenty of grass, not overgrown, and they will\r\nthrive on this very well for a time without hand feeding. Not more than\r\ntwo feedings a day are necessary between the ages of one and six weeks\r\nwhere plenty of grass is at hand. During this time no better food than\r\nground oats and skimmed milk can be used. During all this period great\r\ncare is taken that the goslings are not subjected to any disease or\r\nto cold. They should be carefully housed in sanitary coups where the\r\ntemperature does not sink too low and where they are protected from\r\ncold rains. After the goslings are eight weeks old they are usually\r\nable to take care of themselves in respect of food and need, perhaps\r\nonly one feeding a day. If these goslings are hatched in the early\r\nspring they may be ready for fattening for the Christmas market. The\r\ngeese until shortly before the time for market are allowed to run free\r\nin a field, not too large, where there are ponds or troughs of water\r\nin abundance. In this way the frame of the goose will be sufficiently\r\ndeveloped by the time the fattening period comes but there will have\r\nbeen no unusual expense in the production of the fowl until it is\r\nprepared for the market. The large frame is necessary in order that\r\nthe goose may properly fatten. It usually requires about three weeks\r\nof artificial feeding to bring a goose into proper condition for the\r\nmarket. If the geese are for the Christmas market about the 25th of\r\nNovember they are put up in sheds for fattening for though they have\r\nbeen well fed during the summer and autumn they cannot be called fat\r\ngeese until they have gone through a special course of nutrition. While\r\nthey are confined for fattening, geese require plenty of fresh air but\r\nvery little light and these conditions are procured by housing them in\r\nlarge airy sheds without windows. Before the fattening season these\r\nsheds are thoroughly cleaned and whitewashed and the floor covered with\r\ncinders, ashes, and charcoal. This mixture is not only a good bedding\r\nbut is also a good deodorizer, which is quite important. Food troughs\r\nare arranged along the walls inside the shed and troughs for water\r\noutside in such a way that the birds can reach the water but cannot get\r\ninto it. Clean charcoal is to be put into the shed every day as it is\r\nconstantly eaten by the geese and is valuable. The foods used are oat\r\nmeal, boiled potatoes, linseed meal or other oil cakes, and plenty of\r\nmilk, usually skimmed. The birds should have all of this that they can\r\neat, for in the process we are now describing the artificial forcing\r\nof food into the craw is not practiced. In three weeks a good goose\r\nwill increase four or five pounds in weight and this increase brings\r\nthe goose up from an ordinary bird in good condition to one which is\r\nproperly fed for the market.\r\n\r\nThe killing of geese is practiced in practically the same manner as\r\nthat which is described for slaughtering fowls. A goose is a bird\r\nof large vitality and dies hard as is the case with most fowls. The\r\nfeathers should be taken off the body clean, as they are valuable for\r\ncommercial purposes. Any pin feathers should be cut with a sharp knife\r\nso as to make the bird look as clean as possible when brought to the\r\nmarket. The carcass of the goose should not be packed to send to market\r\nuntil it is entirely cold and in this country, especially, where the\r\ndistances are great, it is advisable to send it packed in ice or in a\r\ncold storage car. The average weight of a goose about nine months old\r\nthus prepared for the market is about fourteen pounds and the flesh is\r\ncertain to be more palatable at this age when fattened in the manner\r\nabove described.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Domesticated Pigeon= (_Columba livia_).--In the last few years the\r\nproduction of domesticated pigeons has been extensively practiced in\r\nthis country, and especially the production of young pigeons which are\r\nknown as squabs. They are rapidly taking the place of game birds at the\r\nhotels and restaurants of the country. The conditions of production,\r\npreparation, etc., are the same as those for the ordinary domesticated\r\nfowl. There are many varieties of the bird grown; some, as the carrier,\r\nfor special purposes. The other principal varieties are barbs,\r\nfantails, jacobins, runts, trumpeters, tumblers, and turbits.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Turkey= (_Meleagris americana_).--In general the statement which has\r\nbeen made regarding the production of fowls or chickens may be applied\r\nalso to the production of turkeys. No further comment, therefore, is to\r\nbe made under that head. The old-fashioned method of securing turkeys\r\ngrown under natural conditions has, to a great extent, given way to the\r\nproduction of turkeys on a large scale and under scientific conditions.\r\nTurkeys, as a rule, are not eaten young, but practically full-grown.\r\nIn this country the turkey is a dish which is particularly affected\r\nfor festive occasions such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, though they\r\nare eaten largely throughout the whole year. The market, however, for\r\nturkeys is particularly a November and December market and the large\r\nintroduction of turkeys in the market is so timed as to furnish them in\r\nproper condition for consumption during those two months.\r\n\r\nThe methods of preparing turkeys for the market, keeping them in cold\r\nstorage, of hanging them previous to consumption and exposing them\r\ndrawn or undrawn for sale, are subject to the same remarks as has been\r\nmade in the case of chickens. Turkeys are said to be more difficult to\r\ncare for, both on the farm and in the professional poultry factory,\r\nthan chickens. They are more subject to disease and more difficult to\r\nbring to maturity than chickens.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Meat of Turkey._--The flesh of the turkey was separated\r\ninto two portions, the white and dark meats, and these were found to\r\nhave the following composition:\r\n\r\n                         WATER IN\r\n                         FAT-FREE                         MEAT\r\n               WATER.   SUBSTANCE.    FAT.    PROTEIN.   BASES.\r\n  White meat,  55.50      74.70      25.71     18.31      1.31\r\n  Dark meat,   54.13      75.76      27.76     16.75      1.15\r\n\r\nA comparison of these two analyses show that there is little difference\r\nin the content of water in the white and dark meat. The dark meat, as\r\nin the case of chicken, has more fat and a correspondingly less amount\r\nof protein. The quantity of protein in the meat of turkey is about the\r\nsame as that of chicken. The white meat of turkey differs from the\r\nwhite meat of chicken more in its content of meat bases than in any\r\nother way, except that the meat of turkey contains more fat, especially\r\nthe white meat, than that of chicken.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Composition of the Meat of Chicken, Turkey, Duck, and Goose.=--The\r\ncomposition of the chicken, turkey, duck, goose, and pigeon as given by\r\nKönig is found in the following table:\r\n\r\n                     WATER.  PROTEIN.  FAT.  ASH.\r\n  Chicken (lean),     76.22   19.72    1.42  1.37\r\n  Chicken (fat),      70.06   18.49    9.34   .91\r\n  Young cock (fat),   70.03   23.32    3.15  1.01\r\n  Turkey,             65.60   24.70    8.50  1.20\r\n  Duck (wild),        70.80   22.65    3.11  1.09\r\n  Goose (fat),        38.02   15.91   49.59   .48\r\n\r\nThe above data show that with the exception of the goose the percentage\r\nof fat given in the flesh of the animals is very much less than that\r\nfound in our own work. Even in the fat chicken only a little over 9\r\npercent of fat was found. It is believed that the composition of these\r\nfowls as given by the work of the Bureau of Chemistry more nearly\r\nrepresents the average composition in this country than the data taken\r\nfrom König.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Importance of Animal Food in the Growth of Poultry.=--Many people\r\nsuppose that poultry can live upon vegetables alone and this is\r\nprobably true. Experience, however, shows that poultry does not thrive\r\nand fatten well on purely vegetable food. This fact was brought out\r\nvery prominently in the experiments at the Cornell station where\r\npoultry of the same origin and character was fed two kinds of diet,\r\none being partly of animal food and the other purely vegetable foods.\r\nThe ration of the animal food consisted of Indian corn meal, wheat\r\nflour, ground oats, wheat bran, wheat middlings, pea meal, linseed\r\nmeal, meat, and fresh bone. The vegetable ration consisted of pea\r\nmeal, linseed meal, wheat bran, ground oats, Indian corn meal, wheat\r\nmiddlings, gluten meal, and skimmed milk. Before the experiment had\r\nbeen long under way it was noticed that the birds receiving the meat\r\nfood were developing rapidly and evenly while those that received\r\nthe purely vegetable diet were becoming thin and uneven in size. The\r\nauthors of the bulletin say that it was sometimes almost pitiful to\r\nsee the long-necked, scrawny, vegetable-fed birds, with troughs full\r\nof abundant good, wholesome food before them, stand on the alert\r\nand scamper in hot haste after the unlucky grasshopper or fly which\r\nventured into their pen, while the contented looking meat-fed ducks lay\r\nlazily in the sun and paid no attention to the buzzing bee or crawling\r\nbeetle. The vegetable-fed birds literally starved to death, at least\r\nmany of them, so that only twenty of the thirty-three with which the\r\nexperiment was commenced were alive at the close of the fifteen weeks\r\nof feeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Forced Fattening of Poultry.=--Allusion has already been made to\r\nthe forced fattening of poultry secured by injecting food into the craw\r\nin larger quantities than would naturally be taken by the fowl if left\r\nto itself. There is much to be said both for and against this method\r\nof fattening. In favor of this method it may be stated that the birds\r\nfattened in this way are more highly prized by the connoisseur, are\r\nnaturally fatter by reason of the enforced idleness of the birds during\r\nthe fattening process, thus diminishing muscular activity, and more\r\ntender than the birds left at freedom and forced to secure their own\r\nfood. From the point of view of the seller, also, the birds are heavier\r\nand the artificially fattened fowl usually brings a higher price, pound\r\nfor pound, on the market. Against the method it is urged that it is\r\nbarbarous, imposing upon the birds a diet far beyond normal capacity\r\nand thus tending to damage and injure the organs of the body charged\r\nwith the assimilation of food and the secretion of the waste products.\r\n\r\nThe above indictment is doubtless true is almost every respect. In\r\nexplanation it may be said that the period of forcing food is always\r\na short one, rarely extending beyond three weeks, and, therefore,\r\nany injury to the organs which might be induced is not of sufficient\r\nduration to establish any real form of disease. In other words, the\r\nbirds are slaughtered before any lesions of the organs are produced.\r\nThe livers of the animals, especially geese, thus artificially\r\nfattened, take on an extra quantity of fat during this period but it\r\ncannot be said that they become really diseased. The fatty livers, as\r\nis well known, are used particularly in the manufacture of a mixed\r\nspiced meat known as _pâté de foie gras_.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole it is believed that no injury is done the bird by this\r\nprocess of feeding which could in any way be regarded as detrimental to\r\nthe flesh as a food product. In regard to the apparent barbarity of the\r\nprocess little need be said. The slaughter of animals for human food\r\nin itself is a barbarous practice from one point of view but if this\r\npractice is justified, as it doubtless is, by the exigencies of human\r\nnutrition, the slight degree of force which is employed in artificial\r\nfattening cannot be condemned. Moreover the artificial fattening of\r\nthe fowl is of necessity a somewhat limited operation and confined to\r\nthose establishments that are devoted exclusively to the production\r\nof high-grade and high-priced poultry for the market. The fattening\r\nis done by experts and, in so far as the experience of feeding men in\r\nthe same way is concerned, is not attended with any pain or discomfort\r\nother than that incident to a chronically full craw.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Increase in Weight._--There is a larger increase in the weight of\r\nartificially fattened poultry over those fed in the ordinary way and\r\nallowed to run free than is usually supposed. It is stated by some\r\nauthors that the average increase in weight of artificially fattened\r\nbirds is as much as 35 percent. There is no secret connected with the\r\nmethod of artificial fattening as is sometimes supposed. There are\r\nperhaps proprietary methods for preparing foods for fattening purposes\r\nbut there is no secret in the mechanism of the process. In fact the\r\nprocess is so simple that it might be easily taught in a general\r\nway so that the farm hand would become an expert in its use and the\r\nfarmer’s poultry instead of being sent to market in a half-emaciated\r\ncondition might be offered to the public in the best possible shape.\r\nPoultry running at large use up a large part of the value of their\r\nfood in the heat and energy developed in the ordinary search for food.\r\nWhen confined and fed artificially this excess of heat and energy is\r\nnaturally stored as fat.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that the artificial feeding must be a limited\r\none and the bird must be sent to market as soon as it has reached its\r\nmaximum of perfection under the process. Experience has also shown\r\nthat in the artificial feeding it is best to have each bird in a small\r\ncompartment to itself with the cage so arranged that the bird can put\r\nits head through a slat in front and thus receive the food from the\r\nmachine without disturbing any of its neighbors. That the birds are\r\nperfectly willing to take the food in this way is evidenced by the fact\r\nthat they voluntarily put their heads through the apertures to receive\r\ntheir food. Each individual coup must be kept scrupulously clean and\r\ndisinfected and the air in the room kept perfectly fresh and sweet.\r\nLime should be used freely in all parts of the coup house in the form\r\nof whitewash or sprinkled about the floor or upon the floors of the\r\ncoups. Gypsum or ordinary land plaster is also highly prized as another\r\nform of lime which is found to be very valuable. The whitewash must be\r\nfreely indulged in and at frequent intervals.\r\n\r\nThere are various forms of fattening food used in this country. Indian\r\ncorn meal forms an important part. The presence of certain animal\r\nproducts must not be neglected in the food as it has been shown that\r\nfowls thrive better when given, in their food, a certain amount of\r\nanimal matter, both of flesh and finely ground bone. The fattening food\r\nmust be in the form of a finely ground paste of the proper consistency\r\nto be handled well in the machine. It is a universal practice which\r\ncustom has shown to be necessary to mix with the food a certain\r\nquantity of finely pulverized charcoal, usually about three pounds of\r\nthe charcoal to 97 pounds of food. Some feeders prefer to mix the paste\r\nabout twenty-four hours before it is administered, believing that the\r\nslight fermentation thus produced is beneficial.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cramming Machine._--Various forms of machines are employed for\r\nintroducing the food into the craw. The tube carrying the food is\r\nintroduced into the esophagus of the bird in a manner to avoid any pain\r\nand the apparatus is so adjusted that with a single movement of the\r\nmachine, usually operated by the foot, the proper amount of food is\r\ninjected. The birds should be arranged according to size so that all of\r\na certain size may have exactly the same quantity of food administered.\r\nThe operator would thus be saved the difficulty of guessing the\r\ndifferent sizes. The arrangement of the coups and the kind of the\r\ncramming machine vary greatly. In the beginning of artificial feeding\r\nthe birds should not be pushed to their full capacity. An increasing\r\nquantity of food should be given up to the end of the first week or\r\nten days before the full maximum dose is administered. In general it\r\nis found best to take the bird out of the coup for feeding, holding\r\nit under the arm so that the neck can be made perfectly straight and\r\ngently inserting the flexible tube which carries the food and thus\r\nwith the single movement of a lever, filling the craw. The use of the\r\nmachine, however, is found to be advantageous from a point of economy\r\nalthough it is claimed that the cramming of birds by means of a\r\nfunnel has been found very efficacious. With a good machine an expert\r\noperator can feed about 250 birds in an hour. An important point in the\r\nfattening is that the food should be given regularly.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Slaughtering Fowls for the Market.=--It is important that a uniform\r\nand proper method be used for killing fowls intended for the market.\r\nThere are two methods in common vogue, namely, by bleeding and by\r\ndislocation of the neck. The method of killing is important in order\r\nthat the proper method of dressing for the market may be secured. A\r\nfowl which is offered for sale ought to be attractively dressed and any\r\nbrutal or defacing method of slaughter makes it impossible afterwards\r\nto render the fowl attractive to the customer.\r\n\r\nIn killing by the dislocation of the neck the operator takes the bird\r\nby the thigh and top of the wing in the left hand and the head in the\r\nright and then draws it steadily until dislocation takes place. The\r\nskin remains unbroken and no bruised effect is produced but all the\r\nblood in the body drains into the neck and remains there. This method\r\nis one especially practiced in England (Journal, Board of Agriculture,\r\n1904-5, page 306). Where the bird is very large, as is the case with\r\nturkeys, it may require the full strength of a man in order to produce\r\nthe dislocation in the manner mentioned. In this case it is often\r\nnecessary to first hang the bird up by the leg to secure the best\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nIn killing a fowl by bleeding it is strung up by the legs with its\r\nhead hanging downward. The operator then gives it a sharp blow with a\r\nstick on the back of the head and when he has stunned it by this means\r\nhe inserts a sharp knife into the roof of the mouth, penetrating the\r\nbrain. He also severs the large artery of the throat by rotating the\r\nknife and the bird rapidly bleeds to death. This method of killing, it\r\nis seen, is not a very humane one. If, for instance, the sensation of\r\nthe bird is not destroyed by the first blow the other process must be\r\nneedlessly painful. This process, simplified somewhat by omitting the\r\nhanging, is the one commonly followed by professionals in this country.\r\nIn England turkeys which are prepared for the market are plucked but\r\nnot drawn. One of the newest methods of plucking is known as the\r\nDevonshire style and consists in stripping the feathers clean off the\r\nbreast and thighs but leaving the neck, back and wings covered. The\r\nfowls are then tied around the legs with a strong cord in such a manner\r\nas to show the plumpness of the breast prominently.\r\n\r\nThe methods of preparation of the fowls depend largely on the demands\r\nof the market to which they are going. Some require the fowls to be\r\nclean plucked and others prefer some of the feathers left on.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Eggs.=--Eggs are a common article of diet throughout the world. The\r\neggs of domesticated fowls are those which are principally used for\r\nfood, though the eggs of wild fowls, and birds and reptiles are also\r\nedible but on account of the difficulty of getting them and their\r\nrarity are not to be considered as a commercial article. The chief\r\nsources of supply are the eggs of chickens, ducks, and geese. Chicken\r\neggs are by far the most important, duck eggs the next important, and\r\ngoose eggs the least important. The eggs of fish also constitute an\r\narticle of food of considerable value and are extensively used. For\r\ninstance the fresh eggs of shad are used in large quantities during\r\nthe whole of the shad season and are often kept in cold storage for\r\nuse at other times. The eggs of sturgeon are used extensively in the\r\nfresh state and when pickled as caviar are highly esteemed throughout\r\nthe world. These two kinds of eggs are probably the most important of\r\nfish eggs used for food purposes. Chicken eggs vary greatly in size\r\naccording to the age and variety of the fowl. The average weight of\r\nchicken eggs is 680 grams per dozen. They vary also in color from pure\r\nwhite to a brownish yellow. Duck eggs are larger and also variegated in\r\ncolor. The average weight of duck eggs is 847.2 grams per dozen. Goose\r\neggs are the largest of the three varieties, varying also in color.\r\nThey weigh on an average 2284.8 grams per dozen. Eggs also vary greatly\r\nin shape, being generally ovoid but some being much more spherical than\r\nothers according to the species of the fowl and variety. The number\r\nof eggs which a chicken will lay varies greatly. Attempts have been\r\nmade, with great success, at experiment stations, to develop chickens\r\nwith high laying powers. A hen which will produce over 200 eggs a year\r\nis regarded as a high-grade fowl for egg-producing purposes. Eggs are\r\nproduced more abundantly during the early spring and summer than during\r\nthe winter months. One of the purposes of scientific egg producing is\r\nthe development of fowls that will produce eggs more evenly throughout\r\nthe whole year, thus avoiding the very great depression in the price of\r\neggs in the spring and the excessively high price of eggs in the winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Eggs._--A large number of eggs have been analyzed in\r\nall quarters of the world and found to vary but little in composition\r\nin different localities, and very little also in regard to the variety\r\nof the fowl. The egg consists essentially of two portions,--an\r\nexternal highly albuminous portion known as the white and an internal\r\ncolored portion, yellow or reddish in tint, known as the yolk. The\r\nwhite of an egg is composed almost entirely of albumin partially\r\ndissolved in water. The yolk of the egg is composed of albumin, fat,\r\nand a phosphorus-bearing material of high nutritive value known as\r\nlecithin. The yolk of an egg is a much richer food product than the\r\nwhite, containing in addition to the nitrogenous element the fat and\r\nmineral bodies necessary to nutrition. Both the white and yolk of an\r\negg are composed principally of water as will be seen by the following\r\nanalytical data:\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF EDIBLE PART OF EGGS.\r\n\r\n           WATER.

The\r\ntemperature of preservation should be as nearly the freezing point\r\nas can be secured. The vital processes are continually going on in\r\na fresh egg and hence there is a development of a certain degree of\r\nheat due to these activities. For this reason eggs can be placed in an\r\natmosphere below the freezing point of water without being frozen. An\r\nadditional reason for this is found in the fact that the water which is\r\npresent in eggs holds the albumin and other bodies in solution and the\r\nfreezing point of a solution is always lower than that of the solvent\r\nalone. For domestic purposes where refrigerating establishments are not\r\navailable the fresh eggs should be kept in a cool dark place where the\r\ntemperature is not allowed to go above 50 or 60 degrees. At a higher\r\ntemperature than this fresh eggs lose their freshness in a remarkably\r\nshort time. The porous nature of the shell is a condition which favors\r\nthe deterioration of the egg by the admission of air and microbes into\r\nthe substance of the egg itself.\r\n\r\nThe preservation of eggs is, therefore, materially assisted by coating\r\nthe egg artificially with a varnish or film of some kind which renders\r\nthe egg impervious to air and water. One of the cheapest, simplest,\r\nand best of these coatings, as has already been noted, is soluble\r\nglass. This is produced by dissolving the chemical substance known\r\nas silicate of soda in water, and dipping the egg into the solution,\r\nremoving and allowing to dry. The silicate of soda which is thus left\r\nin a thin film over the surface of the egg penetrates and stops the\r\npores and renders the egg shell practically impervious both to air and\r\nwater. This material has the property of becoming totally insoluble in\r\nwater when it has once been dried so that even if the egg is afterwards\r\nsubjected to rain or water in any form the film is not removed. Many\r\nother methods of coating eggs have been employed and are dependent upon\r\nthe same principle but are perhaps not so effectual and simple as the\r\ninexpensive method above described.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cold Storage._--Eggs either with or without the coating of the\r\nsurface, usually without, may be kept for a considerable length of time\r\nwithout deterioration in cold storage. In this case it is advisable\r\nto reduce the temperature to the lowest possible point to retain the\r\nsemi-fresh condition of the contents. Water freezes at 32 degrees,\r\nbut for the reasons above mentioned the temperature at which the egg\r\nis stored may be reduced notably below 32 degrees without danger of\r\nsolidifying. The eggs kept in cold storage gradually acquire a taste\r\nand aroma which are quite different from the fresh article and the\r\nperiod of preservation should never be prolonged, probably a month or\r\nsix weeks is the extreme limit for keeping eggs which can still be\r\nregarded as having the qualities of the fresh article. In practice,\r\neggs are kept often a very much longer time since the principal object\r\nof cold storage is to lay in a supply in the spring and summer when\r\nthey are abundant and keep them over until the next winter. The average\r\nage of cold storage eggs is probably more than six months. At this\r\ntime the eggs have acquired a distinctly unpleasant odor and flavor\r\nwhich enables even one who is not an expert to distinguish between\r\nthem and the fresh article. Such eggs should not be allowed on the\r\nmarket except under their proper designation so that the purchaser may\r\nknow the character of the product he is getting. There is a determined\r\nopposition on the part of those dealing in cold storage eggs against\r\nsuch marking, an opposition which can only be explained by the fact\r\nthat the amount of deterioration is fully as great as specified. If\r\ncold storage eggs have not been kept long enough to develop any of\r\nthe objectionable conditions mentioned above and are inferior only in\r\nrespect of taste and aroma there seems to be no just reason why they\r\nshould be forbidden sale. They usually bring a lower price than fresh\r\neggs produced at the time of sale and thus are brought more readily\r\nwithin the means of those who are less able to pay the higher prices.\r\nCold storage eggs are extensively used for baking purposes and in this\r\ncondition escape the detection of the consumer. This appears, however,\r\nto be no just reason for their use without notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Broken Eggs._--An extensive industry has been practiced for many years\r\nin the product known as broken eggs. In the preparation of broken eggs\r\nat times of great abundance, the eggs are collected and broken and\r\nthen mixed together in containers of various sizes, often as large as\r\nbarrels, and preserved by the admixture of borax. From two to four\r\npounds of borax are usually employed per 100 pounds of broken eggs.\r\nIn this condition the eggs are kept from the time of great abundance\r\nuntil the time of higher prices, namely, from six to eight months, and\r\nthen sent into commerce. The use of broken eggs of this kind for edible\r\npurposes is totally indefensible. While borax prevents the development\r\nof bacteria it does not entirely inhibit enzymic action and hence that\r\nsubtle change of nitrogenous matter which produces poisonous bodies may\r\ngo on in the presence of borax while apparently the egg itself remains\r\nundecomposed. Broken eggs were formerly sent to this country in large\r\nquantities from China and other Asiatic countries but since the passage\r\nof food inspection laws as applied to foreign commerce the importation\r\nof this class of food products has been prohibited, on the ground that\r\nthey are unfit for human consumption. Other preserving agents have been\r\nused in place of borax for these products, but all are open to similar\r\nobjections. Broken eggs are used chiefly by bakers in large cities.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dried Eggs._--The rapid drying of fresh eggs is perhaps an\r\nunobjectionable method of preservation. The drying may take place by\r\nspreading the eggs in a thin film on a dry surface, which is the usual\r\nmethod, or by forcing the egg product through small orifices under\r\na high pressure into a drying chamber so adjusted as to temperature\r\nand size as to secure the desiccation of the minute particles of egg\r\nspray before they fall to the bottom. This method is perhaps the best\r\nwhich has yet been developed in the desiccation of such products. The\r\negg powder thus formed is almost devoid of moisture and when properly\r\ncollected and stored out of contact with the air, may be kept for\r\na time without deterioration. Dry egg products such as have been\r\ndescribed made from fresh eggs, may be considered unobjectionable for a\r\nreasonable length of time. Unfortunately dried products are sometimes\r\nmade from decayed eggs. During the past year a factory making a product\r\nof this kind was discovered by the food inspector of one of our large\r\ncities.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Egg Substitutes._--Many products have been put upon the market of a\r\nyellow color and containing protein under the guise of eggs. There is a\r\nnumber of so-called egg powders offered for making cakes, etc., which\r\ncontain no egg at all. They are composed of other forms of protein\r\nmatter, generally casein from milk, and colored to resemble the egg in\r\ntint. Starchy substances are also colored and sold as egg powder. These\r\nsubstances may be regarded as adulterations when sold under the name\r\nor in the guise of an egg product. There are no other adulterations of\r\neggs of any consequence practiced except the simulation of egg material\r\nby such products as those just mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Poisonous Principles in Eggs._--While fresh eggs for most people\r\nform a food product entirely devoid of danger, nutritious and easily\r\ndigestible, eggs may easily become injurious and even poisonous.\r\nAccording to experiments made by Bouchard (Scientific American, August\r\n11, 1896, page 95), even fresh eggs, unless the sanitary conditions in\r\nwhich the fowls live are well cared for, may become very poisonous.\r\nThe fowl producing eggs, as a rule, is not a cleanly animal, and this\r\nis especially true of the duck. Thus injurious organic material rich\r\nin microbes may contaminate the egg and the microbes may penetrate\r\nthe shell thus rendering the egg unsuitable for consumption. Eggs\r\ncontaminated in this way have given evidence of toxic phenomena even\r\nin a fresh state. Experiments have shown too that the food material\r\nof eggs if directly injected into the blood of an animal produces\r\ntoxic effects whereas if injected into the stomach no unfavorable\r\neffects are produced. Egg albumin, that is, the albumin of the white\r\nof the egg, when fed in considerable quantities to animals partially\r\nescapes digestion and thus becomes a source of irritation and even\r\nof poisoning. There are many people who are remarkably sensitive to\r\nthe influence of eggs and those who possess this idiosyncrasy are\r\ninjured even by eggs which are perfectly harmless to other people. A\r\nlarge number of species of injurious microbes which infect eggs have\r\nbeen identified. These even are found in fresh eggs in the unsanitary\r\nconditions above mentioned. Eggs kept for a long while in cold storage\r\nor decayed in any way are extremely injurious. Fortunately decayed\r\neggs are self protecting since they can only be eaten by accident. If,\r\nhowever, decayed eggs be eaten in diluted form by mixing with other\r\nfoods they may be eaten without their characteristic odor or taste\r\nbeing known and thus great injury arises. It is advised in all cases\r\nwhere eggs are to be kept for some time even in cold storage to varnish\r\nthem with some substance impenetrable to air. For this purpose, as has\r\nalready been mentioned, soluble glass, which is chemically a silicate\r\nof soda, has been found extremely effective. Any of the varnishes which\r\nmake the shell of an egg air tight tends to restrain the activities\r\nof bacterial life since the bacteria cannot live without air. The\r\nofficials who inspect food should direct special care to the storing\r\nof eggs in order that no damage may result from keeping them too long\r\nin cold storage or otherwise. It must not be understood that poisoning\r\nby eggs is of common occurrence. In fact it is very rare. The fact\r\nthat the egg itself, which is such a common article of diet, may be\r\nunsanitary and improperly kept is a matter of great concern to the\r\nconsumer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parasites in Eggs._--The egg also when produced in unsanitary\r\nconditions may become infected with parasites. Many of these are\r\napparently harmless, but some are injurious and even dangerous. The\r\nmere fact that parasites may exist in eggs is of itself a sufficient\r\nreason for the consumer to insist that the eggs he eats, like the milk\r\nhe drinks, shall be free from all infections due solely to carelessness\r\nin production.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nFISH FOODS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFISH.\r\n\r\n\r\nFish furnish a very important and useful part of the animal food\r\nof man. Both the fish growing in fresh water and in salt water are\r\ngenerally edible. Usually the smaller-sized fish are considered more\r\npalatable, but this is not universally the case. The large-sized fish\r\nare apt to be coarse, and have a less desirable flavor than those of\r\nsmaller size. The size of the fish usually depends upon the magnitude\r\nof the body of water in which the species grow, the largest being in\r\nthe lakes and oceans, the medium-size in rivers, and the smallest in\r\nbrooks. Fish are known chiefly by their common names, and these names\r\nare different for the same species of fish in different parts of the\r\ncountry. For instance, the term trout covers a multitude of species,\r\nand, likewise, under the term sardine a large number of different\r\nspecies or varieties of fish are considered. There is also a large\r\nnumber of varieties known as salmon, perch, bass, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the following table are given the common and the scientific names of\r\nthe principal food fishes used in the United States (see Report of U.\r\nS. Commission of Fish and Fisheries, 1888, pages 679-868):\r\n\r\n  _Acipenseridæ_:\r\n    _Acipenser sturio oxyrhynchus_, Sturgeon.\r\n  _Catostomidæ_:\r\n    _Moxostoma velatum_, Small-mouthed red-horse.\r\n  _Clupeidæ_:\r\n    _Clupea harengus_, Herring.\r\n      _pilchardus_, Sardine.\r\n      _vernalis_, Alewife.\r\n      _sapidissima_, Shad.\r\n  _Salmonidæ_:\r\n    _Osmerus mordax_, Smelt.\r\n    _Coregonus clupeiformis_, Whitefish.\r\n      sp., _tullibee_ or _artedi_, Ciscoe.\r\n    _Oncorhynchus chouicha_, California salmon.\r\n    _Salmo salar_, Salmon.\r\n      subsp. _sebago_, Land-locked salmon.\r\n    _Salvelinus namaycush_, Lake trout.\r\n      _fontinalis_, Brook trout.\r\n  _Esocidæ_:\r\n    _Esox lucius_, Pike.\r\n      _reticulatus_, Pickerel.\r\n      _nobilior_, Muskellunge.\r\n  _Anguillidæ_:\r\n    _Anguilla rostrata_, Eel.\r\n  _Mugilidæ_:\r\n    _Mugil albula_, Mullet.\r\n  _Scombridæ_:\r\n    _Scomber scombrus_, Mackerel.\r\n    _Scomberomorus maculatus_, Spanish mackerel.\r\n    _Orcynus thynnus_, Tunny.\r\n  _Carangidæ_:\r\n    _Trachynotus carolinus_, Pompano.\r\n  _Pomatomidæ_:\r\n    _Pomatomus saltatrix_, Bluefish.\r\n  _Stromateidæ_:\r\n    _Stromateus triacanthus_, Butter-fish.\r\n  _Centrarchidæ_:\r\n    _Micropterus salmoides_, Large-mouthed black bass.\r\n      _dolomieu_, Small-mouthed black bass.\r\n  _Percidæ_:\r\n    _Perca fluviatilis_, Yellow perch.\r\n    _Stizostedion vitreum_, Wall-eyed pike.\r\n      _canadense_, Gray pike.\r\n  _Serranidæ_:\r\n    _Roccus lineatus_, Striped bass.\r\n      _americanus_, White perch.\r\n    _Centropristis atrarius_, Sea bass.\r\n    _Epinephelus morio_, Red grouper.\r\n  _Sparidæ_:\r\n    _Lutjanus blackfordi_, Red snapper.\r\n    _Stenotomus chrysops_, Porgy.\r\n    _Diplodus probatocephalus_, Sheepshead.\r\n  _Sciænidæ_:\r\n    _Sciæna ocellata_, Red bass.\r\n    _Menticirrus saxatilis_, Kingfish.\r\n    _Cynoscion regale_, Weakfish.\r\n  _Labridæ_:\r\n    _Hiatula onitis_, Blackfish.\r\n  _Gadidæ_:\r\n    _Phycis chuss_, Hake.\r\n    _Brosmius brosme_, Cusk.\r\n    _Melanogrammus æglefinus_, Haddock.\r\n    _Gadus morrhua_, Cod.\r\n    _Microgadus tomcod_, Tomcod.\r\n    _Pollachius virens_, Pollock.\r\n  _Pleuronectidæ_:\r\n    _Hippoglossus hippoglossus_, Halibut.\r\n    _Platysomatichthys hippoglossoides_, Turbot.\r\n    _Paralichthys dentatus_, Flounder.\r\n    _Pseudopleuronectes americanus_, Flounder.\r\n  _Petromyzontidæ_:\r\n    _Petromyzon marinus_, Lamprey eel.\r\n  _Raiidæ_:\r\n    _Raia_ sp., Skate.\r\n\r\nSome of the scientific names in the above list have been modified\r\nby recent research, but it is advisable to present the above\r\nclassification for purpose of reference. The variations from these\r\nnames will be given in the part of the discussion relating to the food\r\nvalue of fish, in which the classification of Jordan and Evermann is\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Edible Portion of Fish.=--As in the case of other animals large parts\r\nof fish as taken from the water are inedible. In the preparation of\r\nfish the head is usually removed, especially if the fish be of any\r\nsize, and the entrails rejected. If the fish be scaly, the scales are\r\nalso removed. The latter vary very greatly in different specimens\r\naccording to species, size, etc. Usually the edible portion of the fish\r\nis larger in quantity than the inedible, though this is not by any\r\nmeans universally the case. Taking fish of all kinds together it may be\r\nsaid that from 55 to 60 percent of the total weight is edible. This,\r\nof course, excludes the bones as well as the other portions already\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Principal Constituents of the Flesh of Fish.=--In the flesh of cattle,\r\nswine, and other edible animals already mentioned it is seen that the\r\nprotein is the principal part of the edible portion. In many kinds\r\nof meat, however, the fat is the principal portion, as in bacon. In\r\nthe flesh of fish the albuminoids occupy a more prominent part than\r\nin the flesh of domesticated animals or game. In other words the\r\nproportion of fat, which is one of the principal ingredients of the\r\nflesh of other animals, is less than in the other kinds of flesh. The\r\nprotein in the water-free substance often constitutes over 90 percent\r\nof the total matter, and rarely falls below 80 percent. The next most\r\nimportant constituent of the dry flesh of fish naturally is the fat.\r\nThe average content of fat in the dry flesh of fish is under 10,--it\r\nrarely goes above 20 and sometimes falls as low as 2 or 3 percent. The\r\nmineral content of the dry flesh of fish is quite constant. It rarely\r\nfalls below 4 or goes above 8 percent; 5 percent may be regarded as a\r\nfair average content of mineral matter. The mineral matter consists\r\nchiefly of phosphate of potash and lime, together with some common\r\nsalt. In the analyses made by Atwater, adopted in the following pages,\r\nhe grouped together the fish analyzed in proportion to the quantity of\r\nthe edible portion or flesh which they contained. Groupings were also\r\nmade on account of the dry substance in the flesh and in proportion\r\nto the water and fat which they contained.

Twelve colored plates and several\r\n  hundred full-page plates from photographs from life and text-figures.\r\n  Doubleday, Page & Co., New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Alewives.=--A fish belonging to a genus very close to that to which\r\nthe herring belongs is known as alewife. The name of the genus is\r\n_Pomolobus_. It is commonly known as a herring. For instance, the\r\nfresh-water skipjack or blue herring,--the tailor herring or hickory\r\nshad,--and the real alewife or branch herring are all common species of\r\nthis genus. One specimen of this genus is the fresh-water skipjack or\r\nblue herring (_Pomolobus chrysochloris_) found in the larger streams in\r\nthe Mississippi valley and also in Lake Erie and Lake Michigan. It is\r\nstrictly a fresh-water fish, but has also been found in salt water on\r\nthe Gulf coast. The tailor herring is found along the Atlantic coast\r\nfrom Cape Cod to Florida. In the Potomac river it is known as tailor\r\nshad or “fresh-water tailor,” and is highly esteemed as a food fish in\r\nWashington and vicinity. Their value is found rather in their coming\r\nearlier than the shad than in their true value, for as soon as the\r\nshad come in great abundance there is no longer any market for the\r\nalewife.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Alewife._--\r\n\r\n               FRESH.           DRY.\r\n  Water,    74.41 percent\r\n  Protein,  19.17    „      75.87 percent\r\n  Fat,       4.92    „      19.08    „\r\n  Ash,       1.47    „       5.78    „\r\n\r\nThis fish, it is seen, has very much less oil in it than the true\r\nherring,--in fact, only a little more than one-half as much. It,\r\nhowever, has a correspondingly larger percentage of protein.\r\n\r\nThe tailor herring and hickory shad are distributed along the\r\ncoast from Cape Cod to Florida. The branch herring (_Pomolobus\r\npseudoharengus_) is found along the Atlantic coast as far south as\r\nCharleston, entering fresh-water streams to spawn, usually two or three\r\nweeks ahead of the shad. It occurs also in Lake Ontario and in several\r\nof the small lakes in northern New York in which it is land-locked. The\r\nsummer herring (_Pomolobus æstivalis_) also occurs along the Atlantic\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Anchovy.=--The anchovy is a small fish which is eaten more as a relish\r\nin the pickled state than in the fresh state, and is highly prized by\r\nmany connoisseurs. Anchovies of various species are found on both the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific coasts,--on the Atlantic coast from Cape Cod to\r\nBrazil and on the western coast from southern California southward.\r\nThese fish reach a length of from 2 to 7 inches. The very small ones\r\nare sometimes known as “whitebait.” Those that are pickled and used for\r\nfood are usually from 3 to 6 inches in length.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Preserved Anchovies._--\r\n\r\n  Water,                    57.8 percent\r\n  Protein,                  22.3    „\r\n  Fat,                       2.2    „\r\n  Ash (principally salt),   23.7    „\r\n\r\n\r\n=Black Bass.=--Two species of black bass are well known to the\r\nAmerican fisherman and to the American cuisine. The one is called the\r\nsmall-mouth black bass (_Micropterus dolomieu_) and the other the\r\nlarge-mouth black bass (_Micropterus salmoides_). These fishes are\r\nfound in the fresh waters of the United States, especially in the\r\nnorthern portion, almost everywhere. Both species have been propagated\r\nboth by the National and State Fish Commissions. Especially have they\r\nbeen introduced into the northeastern waters where they originally did\r\nnot occur, or only in small numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bluefish.=--The bluefish (family Pomatomidæ) is one of the valuable\r\nfood fishes of our Atlantic coast. It is a voracious, carnivorous fish,\r\nand apparently loves to destroy as well as to eat. It is stated that\r\nthe bluefish copies after the style which was once said to be in vogue\r\nin Rome, viz., when its stomach is filled it disgorges it for the\r\npurpose of eating a new ration. The size of the bluefish runs from 3 to\r\n5 pounds, though occasionally very much larger examples are taken. As a\r\nfood fish it is said to rank in the estimation of the connoisseur with\r\npompano and Spanish mackerel. The bluefish is one of the popular fishes\r\nin all the large markets of the Atlantic coast. The flesh has a fine\r\nflavor, but, like the pompano, it does not keep well.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition._--\r\n\r\n               FRESH.          DRY.\r\n  Water,    78.46 percent\r\n  Protein,  19.02    „     90.13 percent\r\n  Fat,       1.25    „      5.79    „\r\n  Ash,       1.27    „      5.91    „\r\n\r\nA comparison of the flesh of this fish with the pompano shows that it\r\nis particularly a protein food, the fat being even less abundant than\r\nthe mineral matter. It, therefore, is not so well balanced a ration\r\nas the flesh of the pompano and other fish in which the fat forms a\r\nconsiderable portion of the edible matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Carp.=--The carp is a fish used very largely for food purposes, but\r\nit has not the fine flavor and character of most fishes. The carp\r\ncultivated in America is known as the German carp (_Cyprinus carpio_).\r\n\r\nThe carp belongs to the large family of fishes known as the minnows or\r\nCyprinidæ. This family is a large one, having about 200 genera and more\r\nthan 1000 species, all of which are inhabitants of fresh water in North\r\nAmerica and Eurasia. None of this family is highly regarded as food in\r\nthe sense of flavor and aroma, except, perhaps, some of the smaller\r\nspecies. The nutritive value of the carp, however, is probably as great\r\nas that of any, but it is coarser and less attractive to the taste.\r\nSome of the most common species of this family are the dace, fallfish,\r\nriver chub, creek chub, squaw-fish, and roach.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Catfish.=--Catfish, of which there are many species, belong to the\r\nfamily of Siluridæ, and are among the most common fresh-water fishes\r\nfound in the United States. They occur in small as well as large\r\nfresh-water streams and lakes, and it is one of the species which\r\nthe American boy most delights in catching with hook and line. The\r\ncatfish is most conveniently taken after night, and the smouldering\r\nfire and small boy on the bank of a stream is a frequent picture of\r\nAmerican country life. There are more than 100 genera of the catfish\r\nfamily and about 1000 species. Only about one-third of the species\r\ninhabit salt water. The North American fresh-water species are confined\r\nparticularly to the Atlantic coast, the Mississippi valley, and the\r\nGulf states. There are no native species of the catfish in the fresh\r\nwaters of the Pacific coast. The blue catfish, known as the Mississippi\r\ncatfish, is the most prominent species (_Ictalurus furcatus_). It is\r\nfound particularly in the Mississippi river and its large tributaries.\r\nSometimes it grows to an immense size, individuals having been found\r\nreaching 150 pounds in weight. If the stream in which the catfish\r\nlives runs north and south it will be found in the southern part of\r\nthe stream in the winter and in the northern part in summer. This fish\r\nis highly prized for edible purposes. In the small streams the catfish\r\nis correspondingly small and weighs from less than one pound to two or\r\nthree pounds only. The small catfish, especially in the small streams\r\ntributary to the Ohio and Mississippi, has edible properties which are\r\nfar superior to the large catfish growing in the rivers themselves.\r\n\r\nThe catfish of the small streams and lakes are commonly known as\r\nbullheads, since the head is large and wide. The name of the most\r\ncommon or best known species is _Ameirus nebulosus_. This species is\r\nfound from Maine westward and southward. In Pennsylvania it is known as\r\nthe Schuylkill cat, and everywhere generally throughout the country as\r\na small catfish.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Codfish.=--One of the most famous food fish of the American waters\r\nis the codfish. It is a widely distributed fish. There are said to be\r\nabout 25 genera and 140 species. The codfish is particularly a fish of\r\nthe northern waters. Only one genus is found in fresh-water lakes and\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Common Cod.=--The common codfish (family Gadidæ) is the species\r\n_Gadus callarias_. It is rarely found south of the Virginia coast,\r\nbut is especially abundant off the New England and Newfoundland\r\ncoast. The great center of the codfish industry is in the vicinity\r\nof Newfoundland. Gloucester, Massachusetts, is the principal town\r\ndevoted to the codfish industry in the United States. The cod is an\r\nomnivorous fish and especially fond of crustaceans, mollusks, and small\r\nfish. It also eats vegetation, and it is stated by Jordan and Evermann\r\nthat all sorts of things have been found in cod stomachs, such as oil\r\ncans, finger rings, rubber dolls, rocks, pieces of clothing, etc. The\r\nlivers of the cod, especially those of Norwegian origin, are extremely\r\nvaluable, being the source of cod liver oil, which is considered by\r\nmany to be the most valuable medicinal food known. Cod liver oil, while\r\nnot palatable, is highly nutritious. The cod livers contain, according\r\nto some authorities, over 60 distinct chemical substances, many of\r\nwhich are highly important for their medicinal qualities. The cod move\r\nin schools, but not in such dense bodies as the mackerel, herring, and\r\nmenhaden. Their movements are largely controlled by the temperature of\r\nthe water and their desire for food. This species probably does not\r\nreach a greater length than 3 feet and a weight of more than 25 pounds.\r\nThe average weight of the large-size cod in New England waters is about\r\n15 pounds and on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland 20 pounds. The average\r\nweight of the small-size cod in these waters is about 12 pounds. It is\r\none of the most prolific of fishes. The ovaries of a 21-pound cod were\r\nfound to contain 2,700,000 eggs and of a 75-pound cod 9,100,000 eggs.\r\nThe eggs are very small and require about 337,000 to make a quart.\r\nThe cod is one of the most valuable of all fishes from a commercial\r\npoint of view and also on account of international relations. On some\r\noccasions this country has apparently been on the verge of war with\r\nGreat Britain respecting questions relating to the fisheries on the\r\nbanks of Newfoundland. The U. S. Bureau of Fisheries has probably done\r\nmore to propagate the cod than any other variety of fish. More than\r\nfive hundred million cod fry have been liberated at different times by\r\nthe Bureau and the number in one year has approximated 100,000,000. The\r\ncolor of the common cod is green or brown, but is subject to very great\r\nvariations,--sometimes it is yellow or red and a variety of tints are\r\nassumed.\r\n\r\n_Composition._--\r\n\r\n               FRESH.          DRY.\r\n  Water,    82.64 percent\r\n  Protein,  15.77    „     95.13 percent\r\n  Fat,        .36    „      2.07    „\r\n  Ash,       1.23    „      7.08    „\r\n\r\nThese data show that the flesh of cod fish is perhaps the most\r\nexclusively nitrogenous of any of the more abundant food fish. The\r\nquantity of fat contained therein is less than ¹⁄₄₀ of the total\r\nweight. The flesh of the fresh cod is more largely composed of water\r\nthan that of the ordinary fish, containing approximately 83 percent of\r\nthat substance. The flesh of the cod itself is an unbalanced ration,\r\nand needs to be eaten with butter and potatoes in order to make a\r\ncomplete ration. The hake, which is sometimes substituted for the cod\r\nwithout the knowledge of the purchaser, has very much the same chemical\r\nconstituents, containing--\r\n\r\n              FRESH.

This, however, does not justify the\r\nsubstitution of the hake for the cod, inasmuch as the hake is inferior\r\nin palatability to the cod.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Salted and Dried Cod.=--In the United States the cod is particularly\r\ndevoted to the use of curing and salting, and in this cured state is\r\neven more highly valued, especially for the making of codfish balls,\r\nthan it is in its fresh state. The old-fashioned method of salting and\r\nsmoking produced a flesh of very high flavor, yielding under proper\r\ntreatment in the kitchen a most delicious base for the fish ball. Under\r\nthe modern system of quick curing, the salting and smoking have largely\r\ndisappeared and the fish are cured in brine, and with the help of borax\r\na product is produced which is less palatable than the old-fashioned\r\ncured fish.\r\n\r\n_Composition of dry Salted and Dried Cod._--\r\n\r\n  Protein,  45.65 percent\r\n  Fat,        .53    „\r\n  Salt,     53.82    „\r\n\r\nThese data show that more than half of the weight in the water-free\r\nstate is composed of salt. The codfish is also put up as boned fish in\r\nwhich nothing but the flesh is found, as desiccated cod, as shredded\r\ncodfish and in various other forms.\r\n\r\n_Average Composition of Codfish Balls._--\r\n\r\n  Water,            65.43 percent\r\n  Solids,           34.57    „\r\n  Nitrogen,          1.05    „\r\n  Phosphoric acid,    .25    „\r\n  Sulfur,             .10    „\r\n  Fat,               7.84    „\r\n  Ash,               4.05    „\r\n  Protein,           6.58    „\r\n\r\nThe difference between the composition of the fish balls and the\r\naverage composition of fish is clearly brought out by the data\r\nrecorded. In the average composition of fish the sum of the fat, ash,\r\nand protein is greater than the solids obtained by difference by 0.36\r\npercent. In the codfish balls the sum of the ingredients mentioned is\r\nless than the solids by difference by 16.10 per cent. This is due to\r\nthe added potato, salt, etc.\r\n\r\n_Average Composition of Shredded Codfish._--\r\n\r\n  Water,               46.52 percent\r\n  Ash (chiefly salt),  22.81    „\r\n  Fat,                   .33    „\r\n  Protein,             30.85    „\r\n\r\n\r\n=Eels.=--The common eel is a fish which is extremely long in proportion\r\nto its size and gives the general appearance, to the uninitiated, of\r\na snake. The resemblance of the eel to a snake in shape is probably\r\none of the reasons why it is not more highly valued as a food. The\r\neels, perhaps, are not to be considered as true fish. The common eel\r\n(_Anguilla chrysypa_) is widely distributed throughout most parts of\r\nthe United States, especially the eastern part. It extends southward\r\nas far as the West Indies, and is found in more or less abundance on\r\nthe Gulf coast. Although a salt-water fish, it differs from most other\r\neels in its penchant for ascending fresh-water streams. It often goes\r\nto the very headwaters, especially in the rivers of the Atlantic coast\r\nand Mississippi valley. Eels are often found in lakes which seem to\r\nhave had no communication with the sea, which shows that they are\r\nable to surmount barriers which seem impossible to cross. Jordan and\r\nEvermann claim that the eel is really a fresh-water fish and that its\r\nreal home is in the fresh-water rivers and lakes, and that it runs\r\ndown to salt water only at spawning time, thus showing a quality or\r\ncharacteristic exactly opposite to that of the salmon and shad, which\r\nare true salt-water fish and come into fresh waters for spawning. Eels,\r\nlike the carp, are more or less scavengers, feeding upon all manner of\r\nrefuse, especially dead fish. They are very destructive of other fish,\r\nespecially of young shad and herring. When nets are placed for shad and\r\nherring and the fish are caught therein the eels often invade the net,\r\nand when it is drawn it is filled largely with the skeletons of the\r\nfish, the flesh of which has been removed by the eels. Eels have a high\r\nvalue as food fish, both on account of their nutritive value and their\r\nflavor. The average length of the eel is from 2 to 3 feet, though much\r\nlarger examples are sometimes found.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Eel._--\r\n\r\n                FRESH.         DRY.\r\n  Water,    71.60 percent\r\n  Protein,  18.28    „     65.25 percent\r\n  Fat,       9.11    „     31.92    „\r\n  Ash,       1.01    „      3.60    „\r\n\r\nThese data show that the eel is rather richer in fat than the majority\r\nof fish, although there are some that exceed it in this constituent.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Conger Eel.=--The conger eel belongs to the family Leptocephalidæ. It\r\ninhabits salt water only, is scaleless, and grows to much larger sizes\r\nthan the common eel, sometimes as long as 7 or 8 feet. It is not used\r\nfor food in the United States, but is to some extent in Europe and the\r\nWest Indies. On the east coast of the United States they do not occur\r\nvery frequently. Only a few species are known, and these are of small\r\nextent and have little food value.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Summer Flounder.=--This fish (_Paralichthys dentatus_) is quite\r\nabundant on the Atlantic coast, frequenting the coast from Cape Cod to\r\nthe Carolinas. It reaches a length of from 2 to 3 feet and has a weight\r\nof about 15 pounds. It is caught very extensively off the New England\r\ncoast. The principal fishing grounds are in the region of Block Island,\r\nMarthas Vineyard, and the eastern end of Long Island. There is another\r\nspecies known as the southern flounder (_Paralichthys lethostigmus_),\r\nwhich flourishes from Charleston southward, and is found along the\r\nentire Gulf coast. There is also another species on the Gulf coast\r\ncalled the Gulf flounder (_Paralichthys albiguttus_). There is also a\r\nwide flounder or common flatfish (_Paralichthys americanus_). It is\r\nfound on the coast of Labrador and extends down to the Carolinas. It\r\nis especially abundant along the coast of southern New England. It is\r\na small species, rarely being over 20 inches in length, the average\r\nlength being from 12 to 15 inches, and weighs from 2 to 3 pounds. This\r\nspecies of flounder has been extensively propagated by the U. S. Bureau\r\nof Fisheries, as many as 100,000,000 fry having been planted in one\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Summer Flounder._--\r\n\r\n                FRESH.

They occur chiefly in northern or Arctic waters. One\r\nspecies found in Michigan is known as the Michigan grayling. It is a\r\nfish that is not only distinguished on account of its food value but\r\nalso on account of its graceful shape and pleasing appearance. Another\r\nspecies occurs in Montana, and has been distributed very largely by the\r\nBureau of Fisheries. It is not a fish which is of any great economic\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Haddock.=--This is a fish very nearly related to the cod, but it\r\nhas a smaller mouth and differs in other essentials, particularly in\r\nits chemical constituents, from the cod. The haddock has a food value\r\nwhich is probably not inferior to that of the cod. It is one of our\r\nmost abundant fishes, and by some consumers the flesh is preferred\r\nto that of the cod. The usual weight of the haddock is about 3 or\r\n4 pounds. It is, therefore, a much smaller fish than the cod. The\r\nspecies is _Melanogrammus æglefinus_. On the Atlantic coast it does not\r\noccur north of the Straits of Belle Isle. The haddock is particularly\r\nabundant on the Massachusetts coast in summer. Like the cod, the\r\nhaddock is well suited for salting, smoking, and curing in various\r\nways. It, however, has not been used to such an extent as the cod for\r\nthose purposes, finding a more ready market in the fresh state.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition._--\r\n\r\n  Water,    81.69 percent\r\n  Protein,  16.83    „\r\n  Fat,        .25    „\r\n  Ash,       1.23    „\r\n\r\nIn the dry substance.\r\n\r\n  Protein,  93.89 percent\r\n  Fat,       1.34    „\r\n  Ash,       6.76    „\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the haddock, it is seen, is even more exclusively\r\nnitrogenous than that of the cod. The two species resemble each other\r\nvery closely in composition.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Hake.=--There are several species of hakes, family Merluccidæ. The\r\ncommon European hake is the species _Merluccius merluccius_. The hake\r\nwhich is found mostly in American waters is _Merluccius productus_,\r\nand occurs very abundantly on the Pacific coast and is largely eaten\r\nas food. The flesh, however, is rather coarse and not very palatable.\r\nAnother species which is found on our Atlantic coast from New England\r\nnorthward is _Merluccius bilinearis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Halibut.=--The halibut (_Hippoglossus hippoglossus_) is a fish which\r\nis highly esteemed and occurs in great quantities. It is a fish which\r\nfrequents northern waters, and especially the North Atlantic on the\r\nAmerican coast. It has not been taken south of Montauk Point, but\r\nextends as far north as the coast of Greenland, and is also found\r\nabout Iceland and Spitzbergen in a latitude of 80 degrees. It does not\r\nlike water above 45 degrees F., and is often found in water at the\r\nfreezing point, namely, 32 degrees. The halibut is also found on the\r\nPacific coast, especially off Oregon and Washington and in British\r\nColumbia and Alaska. It is one of the largest of food fish. The fish\r\nweighing about 80 pounds are considered the best for food, although\r\nthe halibut sometimes reaches a weight of over 500 pounds. The male is\r\nalways smaller than the female and less palatable. The annual value\r\nof the halibut fisheries on the North Atlantic coast is probably ³⁄₄\r\nmillion dollars. It is probably slightly more than this on the Pacific\r\ncoast,--in fact the Pacific coast fisheries have grown so extensively\r\nthat halibut is shipped eastward across the continent. Vast freight\r\ntrains known as the “Halibut Express” have been sent across the\r\ncontinent from Vancouver to Boston, making the trip in six or seven\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition._--\r\n\r\n                FRESH.         DRY.\r\n  Water,    75.42 percent\r\n  Protein,  18.35    „     77.18 percent\r\n  Fat,       5.17    „     19.32    „\r\n  Ash,       1.06    „      4.39    „\r\n\r\nThe halibut is a fish containing considerable quantities of fat, and\r\nis not so peculiarly nitrogenous in its character as the cod or the\r\nhaddock. It, therefore, makes a better balanced ration than either of\r\nthe other fish. The halibut in the fresh state is esteemed fully as\r\nhighly as the cod, and the halibut steak is a very common part of the\r\nfish sold upon the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Herring.=--The herrings form a very important group of fishes\r\nbelonging to the family Clupeidæ. There are about 30 genera in the\r\nfamily and 150 species. The herrings are essentially salt-water\r\nfishes and are usually found in large schools. Many species, and some\r\nof these the most valuable for food, ascend fresh-water streams for\r\nspawning. Certain species, for instance, are caught at the same season\r\nas the shad in the Chesapeake and Susquehanna. There are a few species\r\nwhich remain permanently in fresh water. The common herring (_Clupea\r\nharengus_) is one of the most important of the food fishes of the\r\nwhole Atlantic coast, and really over almost all the north Atlantic,\r\nthroughout which it is generally distributed. The principal herring\r\nfisheries are in the North Sea, in Denmark and Norway. Important\r\nfisheries are also found off the coast of Great Britain, Belgium,\r\nFrance, and the United States. It is estimated that as many as three\r\nbillion herring may be found in a shoal covering a dozen square miles.\r\nHerring shoals of much larger extent are on record. The herring do not\r\nfrequent southern waters, but are found in the cool and more northern\r\nwaters of the Atlantic. On the coast of the United States it has been\r\nfound as far south as Cape Hatteras, though it does not occur very\r\nabundantly further south than New England. The fish at the period of\r\nspawning are considered the most valuable for food purposes.\r\n\r\nThe herring is either sold in a fresh state or it may be smoked,\r\nsalted, or pickled, and in this condition is very extensively used\r\nas food. A species of herring is found on the Pacific coast known as\r\nCalifornia herring (_Clupea pallasii_). It does not differ very greatly\r\nin its general aspect from its relation on the Atlantic coast. This\r\nspecies occurs very abundantly in the region of Puget Sound, especially\r\nin summer time, and in southeast Alaska. They are extremely abundant\r\nin San Francisco markets in the spring time, so much so that it is\r\ndifficult to find a sale for them.\r\n\r\nThe California herring are more highly valued and bring the highest\r\nprice in the early winter, when they are the fattest.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Herring._--\r\n\r\n                FRESH.          DRY.\r\n  Water,    69.03 percent\r\n  Protein,  18.46    „     61.69 percent\r\n  Fat,      11.01    „     35.55    „\r\n  Ash,       1.50    „      4.83    „\r\n\r\nThe above data show that the flesh of herring is particularly rich\r\nin fat. In fact the herring is sometimes used as a source of oil. In\r\nsoutheast Alaska are extensive oil and guano works which utilize the\r\nherring for these purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Horse Mackerel.=--Another species belonging to the mackerel family\r\nis the horse mackerel or tuna (_Thunnus thynnus_), which is found in\r\nconsiderable abundance on our North Atlantic coast and on the coast\r\nof southern California. Its common name is “tuna,” “tunny,” “horse\r\nmackerel,” or “great albacore.” The horse mackerel is a fish of very\r\ngreat size and is the very largest of the whole mackerel family. They\r\noccasionally attain a length of 10 feet or more and a weight of 1500\r\npounds. The average dimensions, of course, are very much less than\r\nthis. The horse mackerel does not grow so large in Europe or upon the\r\nPacific coast. In these regions a horse mackerel weighing 500 pounds\r\nis considered of an extraordinary size. The very large ones are never\r\ntaken with hook and line, but there are records of fish of over 200\r\npounds that have been captured in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Hogfish.=--The hogfish of the West Indies and our southern\r\ncoasts is another of the wrasse-fishes whose scientific name is\r\n_Lachnolaimus maximus_. It is called in Porto Rico “el capitan.” It\r\noften reaches a weight of 20 pounds and a length of from 2 to 3 feet.\r\nThe name “hogfish” doubtless is derived from the shape of the head,\r\nwhich resembles somewhat that of the hog. It is valued as a food fish\r\nthroughout the West Indies.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lake Herring.=--The so-called lake herring is very closely related to\r\nthe whitefish. The name of the species is _Argyrosomus artedi_. The\r\nlake herring has a large number of common names, of which the most\r\nwidely applied is the term “Cisco.” The terms blueback, greenback, and\r\ngrayback are also applied to these herring. The habitat of this fish\r\nis that of the whole region of the Great Lakes and north to Hudson\r\nBay. It has much the same habitat as the whitefish. The average weight\r\nof the lake herring is about one pound. The subspecies (_Argyrosomus\r\nartedi sisco_) is found in Lake Tippecanoe and other small lakes in\r\nWisconsin and northern Indiana.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Cisco._--\r\n\r\n                FRESH.          DRY.\r\n  Water,    76.15 percent\r\n  Protein,  19.12    „     80.75 percent\r\n  Fat,       3.48    „     14.59    „\r\n  Ash,       1.25    „      5.25    „\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mackerel.=--The mackerel is a food fish which is very commonly used\r\nin a cured state in the interior of the country and is eaten fresh on\r\nthe sea coast. Its habitat is principally the North Atlantic ocean. On\r\nthe coast of the United States it is found from Cape Hatteras north to\r\nthe Strait of Belle Isle. In Europe it is found from Norway southward\r\nto the Mediterranean and Adriatic. The mackerel on the Atlantic coast\r\nusually appear first in the spring near Cape Hatteras and following the\r\ncustom of the shad are found later farther north in the New England\r\nstates and also in the British possessions. They leave the coast in the\r\ninverse order in the autumn, disappearing first in the northern regions\r\nand later in the southern portion.\r\n\r\nThe mackerel is one of the most abundant of fishes in the Atlantic\r\nOcean, traveling in immense schools. There is record of a school which\r\nwas seen in 1848 which was at least half a mile wide and 20 miles long.\r\nIn some seasons the mackerel is extremely abundant and in others very\r\nscarce. The average catch is probably about 300,000 barrels. Boston\r\nand Gloucester are centers of the mackerel fishing industry. It is\r\nestimated that from 150 to 300 vessels of American bottoms are engaged\r\nin the mackerel industry. The U. S. Bureau of Fisheries has been\r\nparticularly interested in the propagation of mackerel, but the result\r\nhas not been as satisfactory as in the case of many other fishes. The\r\nyoung mackerel or small fishes are known as “spikes,” “blinkers,” and\r\n“tinkers.” When they are about two years old they measure from 5 to\r\n9 inches in length. The mackerel attains its full size at about the\r\nfourth year. The scientific name of the common mackerel is _Scomber\r\nscombrus_ Linnæus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Mackerel._--Edible portion:\r\n\r\n                FRESH.

It is one of the most abundant fishes taken upon\r\nour Atlantic coast and is used almost exclusively as a source of oil,\r\nthe residue being dried and ground for fertilizing purposes. In this\r\nsense it has great value because of the high nitrogen content of the\r\nresidue and also of the considerable quantity of phosphoric acid which\r\nis contained therein.\r\n\r\nThe menhaden is known scientifically as _Brevoortia tyrannus_. Up to\r\n1880 immense quantities of menhaden were taken off the Atlantic coast.\r\nSince that time the supply has not been considered so great. In the\r\nyear 1877 it is stated by Jordan and Evermann that one oil company took\r\n20 million fish and in one town alone, namely Booth Bay, 50 million\r\nfish were caught.\r\n\r\nThe fecundity of the menhaden is very great, exceeding that of the\r\nshad. More than 140,000 eggs have been taken from a single fish. The\r\nmenhaden are not eaten very extensively in a fresh state as food but\r\npreserved in salt they have a considerable value for that purpose.\r\nAn extract has also been made from the flesh of the menhaden on the\r\nsame principle of manufacture as is utilized in preparation of meat\r\nextracts. The menhaden is known under a great number of common names,\r\nsome thirty of which have been enumerated by Dr. Goode.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Menhaden._--\r\n\r\n  Water,                  77.15 percent\r\n  Fat,                     3.91    „\r\n  Protein by difference,  18.94    „\r\n\r\nThe water-free flesh contains (including bones) 21.7 percent of mineral\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Mineral Matter._--\r\n\r\n  Lime,              8.67 percent\r\n  Phosphoric acid,   7.78    „\r\n  Silicic acid,      1.33    „\r\n  Potash,            1.54    „\r\n  Soda,              1.02    „\r\n  Magnesia,          0.67    „\r\n  Chlorin,           0.69    „\r\n                    -----\r\n      Total,        21.70    „\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mullet.=--The mullet belongs to the Mugilidæ, an important family of\r\nfishes in which there are several genera and species. The mullet is\r\nnot particular about its food but is in the habit of swallowing large\r\nquantities of mud, or rather partially swallowing it and separating the\r\nrefuse and most obnoxious particles by means of the gills. The common\r\nmullet or striped mullet (_Mugil cephalus_) is a widely distributed\r\nspecies. This fish is common along the Atlantic coast and in Hawaii,\r\nusually traveling in large schools, and is most abundant in the\r\nshallow waters of the coast. It sometimes reaches a length of two feet\r\nand is an important food fish. The mullet is very abundant on the\r\nFlorida coasts. While the mullet may be regarded as a scavenger, living\r\nprincipally on mud, it does not eat any other species of fish, but is\r\nitself eaten by nearly all fishes that can gain access to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Mullet._--\r\n\r\n               FRESH.

It is a native of the Great Lakes and is\r\nespecially found in the upper St. Lawrence. It is not a very abundant\r\nfish, but is highly prized from the angler’s point of view. It is of\r\nvery great size, having been found as long as 8 feet and weighing\r\nover 100 pounds. Two other species of muskallunge are known, one\r\n(_Esox ohiensis_ or the Chautauqua muskallunge) in the Ohio river\r\nbasin, particularly in Lake Chautauqua, where it has been artificially\r\npropagated with great success, and the unspotted muskallunge (_Esox\r\nimmaculatus_), which occurs sparingly in certain small lakes of\r\nnorthern Wisconsin and Minnesota.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Muskallunge._--\r\n\r\n               FRESH.

The pike of the Great\r\nLakes belongs to the species _Esox lucius_ Linnæus. It is found in the\r\nfresh waters of North America, Europe, and Asia, but is not found on\r\nthe Pacific coast except in Alaska. It reaches in some cases a large\r\nsize, having been found as much as 4 feet in length and weighing 40 to\r\n50 pounds. The Kankakee in northern Indiana is a well-known fishing\r\nground for this species of pike.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Pickerel._--Edible portion:\r\n\r\n                FRESH.

The fat falls to an insignificant quantity, being only about\r\nhalf as much as the ash.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Wall-eyed Pike.=--The wall-eyed pike or pike perch (_Stizostedion\r\nvitreum_) is a fish most abundant in Lake Champlain, the Great Lakes,\r\nand in eastern Canadian lakes; it occurs also in certain small lakes\r\nand streams in the upper Mississippi valley. In some localities it is\r\nknown as the salmon or jack salmon, but of course these are misnomers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition._--\r\n\r\n                FRESH.

It has been\r\nfound as far north as Cape Cod on the Atlantic coast, but does not\r\noccur in sufficient numbers to make it of any economic value as a food\r\nfish north of Florida. It is taken chiefly in the Gulf waters. The\r\naverage weight of the pompano is from 2 to 3 pounds, though very much\r\nlarger examples are sometimes found. As a food fish there is none that\r\nis regarded more highly than the pompano, especially when it is eaten\r\nfresh from the water and prepared in the manner of the creole cooks of\r\nNew Orleans.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition._--\r\n\r\n                FRESH.

The latter exists in quantities of\r\napproximately one-third of the former. It is not so much its nutritive\r\nvalue which makes the pompano desirable as a food fish but the extreme\r\ndelicacy of flavor and the richness of its taste. It does not bear\r\nshipping well, and therefore is found in its greatest perfection only\r\nnear the place where it is taken.\r\n\r\nIn New Orleans and in Florida the pompano is one of the principal food\r\nfishes furnished by the high-class hotels and restaurants to their\r\nguests.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Red Snapper.=--The red snapper (_Lutianus aya_) is the most noted fish\r\nof all the snapper family (Lutianidæ), although there are others which\r\nare highly prized, such as the gray snapper. It sometimes reaches a\r\nlength of two or three feet and a weight of from 10 to 35 pounds. It is\r\nparticularly abundant in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico and off\r\nthe west coast of Florida. The red snapper bears shipping better than\r\nmost of the Gulf fish, and Pensacola is one of the principal points\r\nwhere the fish are packed in ice as soon as possible after capture and\r\ndispatched to northern markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition._--\r\n\r\n                FRESH.

It is the\r\nfish which the American boy, living near small streams, most delights\r\nto catch. The size of the rock bass varies largely according to the\r\nmagnitude of the body of water in which it lives. The average weight of\r\nthe fish in streams of ordinary size is probably about a pound, though\r\noften it is considerably more. The rock bass has been propagated to\r\nsome extent by the Bureau of Fisheries and has been introduced into\r\nwaters where it formerly did not occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Salmon.=--The salmon is one of the most important food fishes of\r\nthe United States. It belongs to the genus _Oncorhynchus_. The five\r\nspecies of this genus are, in America, confined to our Pacific coast.\r\nOf these species the one known as blueback or sockeye is found most\r\nabundantly in the Fraser and Columbia rivers and in Alaska, the silver\r\nsalmon in Puget Sound, the chinook salmon in the Columbia, and the dog\r\nsalmon along the coast from California to Bering Sea. The salmon begin\r\nrunning early in the spring and the early run is considered of greater\r\nvalue than the later. The habits of the salmon in the deep waters of\r\nthe ocean are not very well known. It is only when they come into\r\nfresh water for spawning purposes that their life history can be well\r\nstudied. It is believed, however, that they do not go very far from\r\nthe shore. The run of salmon on the Pacific coast usually begins about\r\nthe latter part of March and lasts through the spring and greater part\r\nof the summer. On account of the great abundance of these fish on the\r\nPacific coast and the distance from large markets the canning industry\r\nhas developed with great rapidity. In fact on the Pacific coast the\r\nproduct of salmon fishing is devoted almost exclusively to canning\r\npurposes. In the canning of salmon no particular care is taken, and\r\nperhaps none at all to designate upon the can whether its contents are\r\nof the early salmon or the later, less valuable run. It is claimed by\r\nmany authorities that the salmon of the Pacific coast of America, taken\r\nall together in their relation to the economic problem of fish food,\r\nare the most important and valuable fish in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of a Pacific Coast Species._--\r\n\r\n                FRESH.

In fact in the edible portion of the fish the fat is\r\nalmost as great as the protein.\r\n\r\nAnother species of Pacific salmon is the humpback salmon (_Oncorhynchus\r\ngorbuscha_), which appears in great abundance in the rivers of Alaska,\r\nbut not every year,--usually coming in larger quantities in alternating\r\nyears. As a fish to be eaten fresh, this is one of the very best of\r\nthe salmons. Owing to the pale color of the flesh, this species does\r\nnot hold as high a rank for canning purposes. It cans well, however,\r\nand the product is very palatable and doubtless very nutritious. The\r\ntrade-name of the canned product is “pink salmon,” as its flesh is of\r\na paler color than that of the chinook salmon or red salmon. Another\r\nspecies is known as dog salmon. It is found in considerable abundance\r\nfrom California northward to Bering Strait, spawning usually late in\r\nthe fall. It is considered as the least valuable for food purposes,\r\nalthough it is now coming to be used very extensively by freezing, in\r\nwhich form it finds a ready market both in this country and abroad.\r\nWhen canned it is put on the market as “chum.” Its chief interest at\r\nthe present time is on account of the fact that it is sometimes sold\r\nunder the names of better species.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Chinook Salmon= (_Oncorhynchus tschawytscha_).--This species is also\r\nknown as quinnat, king, Columbia river, and Sacramento river salmon. It\r\nis, next to the sockeye, the most important of all salmon in commercial\r\nvalue. The individuals of this species reach a larger size than those\r\nof any other. They have been known to weigh 90 pounds, and fish of\r\nfrom 40 to 60 pounds in weight are not infrequently taken. The average\r\nweight of the king salmon which are captured in the Columbia river is\r\nprobably not far from 22 pounds, while those that run further south,\r\nfor instance in the Sacramento river, average 16 pounds.\r\n\r\nAnother species, known as silver salmon (_Oncorhynchus kisutch_), also\r\nhas a number of other names, mostly of Eastern or Russian origin. It\r\nis quite an important member of the genus and its average weight is\r\nabout 5 pounds. It is very valuable as a food fish, only the Chinook\r\nand blueback salmon going ahead of it. It is also a species which\r\nbears shipment in a fresh state very well. The silver salmon resembles\r\nvery closely the Chinook, but is easily distinguished therefrom by\r\nexperienced fishermen. The canned product of this species is usually\r\nput on the market as “medium red” or “coho” salmon, names which have\r\nnow come to have a definite meaning and are perfectly understood by the\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Sockeye or Blueback Salmon= (_Oncorhynchus nerka_).--This is the\r\nspecies which has the greatest commercial value and forms a large part\r\nof the catch of the Pacific coast. It is the most abundant of all the\r\nspecies of salmon in Alaska. Its flesh has a rich red or “salmon”\r\ncolor, and lends itself admirably to canning processes. In palatability\r\nand attractiveness as a canned product it is not inferior to any,\r\nunless, possibly, the Columbia river chinook.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Canning of Salmon._--The canning of salmon is one of the most\r\nimportant of the fish industries of the United States. The immense\r\ncoast line possessed by the United States on the west, which is so\r\nvastly extended by the Alaskan coast and Aleutian Islands, affords the\r\nmost extensive fisheries of salmon in the world. As has already been\r\nstated, there are no large markets in that region in which the fresh\r\nsalmon can find a purchaser. The fish, therefore, must be neglected\r\nas a food product or else prepared in some way to enable them to be\r\nshipped to great distances. Probably the most unobjectionable way is\r\nby canning. The principles of the canning of salmon are not different\r\nat all from those which underlie the sterilization of any kind of\r\nfood. The establishments in which the canning takes place are perhaps\r\nthe most extensive in the world. The prime necessity in these cases\r\nis to secure complete sterilization. In the case of fish any failure\r\nto secure the proper sterilization is the more reprehensible, because\r\nfish decompose so readily, forming fermentative products which are\r\nextremely poisonous. Cases of poisoning from eating canned salmon have\r\nbeen reported, and in some cases they may prove fatal. Every can of\r\nsalmon which is to be eaten ought to be examined carefully in order to\r\nsee if there are any incipient signs of decomposition. A bad smelling\r\nor otherwise imperfect can should be rejected without question. Only\r\nthe fish which is perfectly fresh to the taste and odor and which gives\r\nno signs of any kind of deterioration should be eaten. When properly\r\nprepared, canned salmon affords a delicacy as well as a food product\r\nwhich can hardly be too highly prized.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Canned Salmon._--Mean of three samples.

There is a very close resemblance between the\r\ntwo genera, and the common name “salmon” is applied to the individuals\r\nof each. The Atlantic salmon is a fish which has been known from the\r\nearliest time. The Roman people became acquainted with it in the early\r\nhistory of the Republic, and especially when they conquered Gaul and\r\nBritain. It is found distributed over the whole North Atlantic coast,\r\nbut especially the northern portion from Massachusetts northward. The\r\nsalmon extends, as far as observations have been made, beyond even\r\nthe Arctic circle, and the same species is found upon the western and\r\nnorthern shores of Europe. The salmon enters the St. Lawrence and has\r\nbeen found as far up as Niagara Falls. Our principal fisheries for this\r\nspecies are in Maine and in Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick.\r\nThey do not extend southward beyond the Delaware and have rarely been\r\nfound in that river. The shad and salmon were particularly abundant\r\nin early colonial days. The shad were so abundant that they were not\r\nregarded as useful for food purposes, but their value as a fertilizer\r\nwas taught to the whites by the Indians. Salmon, apparently, were\r\nequally abundant, and it was considered an affront to offer salmon\r\nmore than twice a week even to servants. In this respect they were\r\non the same plane as the diamond back terrapin and canvas back duck,\r\nwhich were so abundant, in those days, that they were a drug on the\r\nmarket. The salmon enters the fresh-water streams for the purpose of\r\nspawning. The eggs are largely laid late in the fall, and in that case\r\ndo not hatch until the next spring. The Atlantic salmon often reach a\r\nvery large size. Individuals have been known to weigh from 40 to even\r\n80 pounds. The average weight of the salmon taken in Maine waters is\r\nabout 10 pounds each. Another valued specimen of salmon is known as the\r\nSebago salmon (_Salmo sebago_), from the lake in which it occurs. It is\r\na fresh-water fish, having been doubtless landlocked in some way after\r\noriginally entering from the sea. Still a third species is the famous\r\nouananiche (_Salmo ouananiche_), inhabiting the waters of the Lake St.\r\nJohn region north of Quebec.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Atlantic Salmon._--\r\n\r\n                FRESH.

This difference is\r\nshown chiefly in the relative proportion of fat. In the Pacific salmon\r\nthe fat approaches in quantity the protein, while in the Atlantic\r\nsalmon the protein is much greater than the fat. The Atlantic salmon\r\nis used chiefly in the fresh state for two reasons, first, because\r\nthe catch is very much smaller than that of the Pacific species while\r\nthe markets are very much more numerous and very much larger; second,\r\nbecause it is commercially more profitable to dealers in the fresh\r\nstate. In Europe and Scotland the salmon is constantly used in a\r\nfresh state during the whole of the summer and a dinner is scarcely\r\nconsidered complete without it. It is also very commonly used at\r\nluncheon. It is generally eaten cold and offers a food product of high\r\npalatability and great nutritive value in so far as the protein is\r\nconcerned. Eaten with plenty of potato, as it usually is, it forms a\r\nreasonably well-balanced ration. The American visitor who is not used\r\nto eating salmon every day is likely to find its constant occurrence\r\nupon the English table in the summer to be a bit trying to his taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sardines.=--The sardine belongs to the herring family--in fact\r\nsmall herring along the coast of Maine are put up as sardines. The\r\nsardines are very closely related to the herrings, but there are\r\nrather important differences. The European sardine, which is known\r\nas the sardine, is the _Sardinia pilcharda_, and does not occur on\r\nthe coast of the United States. The species existing on the Pacific\r\ncoast is known as the California sardine (_Sardinia cærulea_). It is\r\nquite abundant on the California coast and spawns in the open sea. It\r\nresembles very strongly the European sardine, but has no teeth. The\r\nSpanish sardine (_Sardinia pseudohispanica_) is found rather abundantly\r\nin Cuba and is often carried northward in the Gulf Stream as far as\r\nWoods Hole or Cape Cod. It is about 8 inches in length and of high food\r\nvalue, resembling very closely the European sardine. There has been a\r\ngood deal of discussion as to whether or not small herring which are\r\npacked as sardines in the United States should be allowed, under the\r\nfood laws of the various states and of the United States, to be sold by\r\nthat name. The answer to this is that any deception in the label should\r\nbe avoided. The herring, however, belongs to the same genus as the\r\ntrue sardine, and, differing from it only in the variation of species,\r\nmay have some right to the name. The true ethical principles of trade,\r\nhowever, would require that they should be named Maine sardines or\r\nherring sardines and not bear the name simply sardines, which is\r\nreserved exclusively for the species _Sardinia pilcharda_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Canned Sardines._--\r\n\r\n  Water,                 56.37 percent\r\n  Water-free substance,  43.63    „\r\n  Protein,               24.87    „\r\n  Fats,                  12.71    „\r\n  Ash,                    5.00    „\r\n  Sodium chlorid,         0.61    „\r\n\r\nThe above data are based upon the analysis of the sample after the oil\r\nhas been separated by drainage.\r\n\r\n\r\n=European Sardines.=--The sardine is eaten fresh along the Spanish\r\nand French coast, where they are taken in great abundance and form a\r\ndelicious food in this condition. The number which is given to a single\r\nindividual is quite generous, as the writer has had served him on the\r\nMediterranean coast in Spain as many as twenty fresh sardines at one\r\norder. The number, however, was not found any too large when the\r\npalatability of the product is taken into consideration. Sardines are\r\npreserved by salt and smoke and particularly by packing in oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Method of Packing in Oil._--The sardines after proper cleaning are\r\nheated in oil for the purpose of sterilizing them. Olive oil is usually\r\nemployed for this purpose, though some packers prefer to heat the fish\r\nin peanut oil, claiming that it gives them a better color. There seems\r\nto be, however, no sufficient ground for this claim. The peanut oil\r\nis probably used simply because it is cheaper. When the fish are thus\r\nsterilized and thoroughly cooked they are placed in boxes in the well\r\nknown manner in which they are found and covered with oil, sealed,\r\nand, if necessary, again sterilized in order to prevent decomposition.\r\nOlive oil is the oil usually employed for packing purposes, though\r\ncheaper grades of edible oil are very commonly found in sardines.\r\nThe substitutes for olive oils which are usually employed are peanut\r\noil, cottonseed oil, and sesame oil, either single or mixed. When the\r\nsardines have been previously boiled in a cheaper oil and then packed\r\nwith olive oil the olive oil will be contaminated with the cheaper oil\r\nused in the boiling.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Sardines._--As indicated above, the chief adulteration\r\nof sardines is in the misbranding respecting the nature of the fish\r\nand the oil used in packing. A young herring packed in the manner\r\nof a sardine properly demands a special label instead of the word\r\n“sardine” alone. A difference respecting the misbranding in regard to\r\nthe oil employed is avoided by the statement on the package of the\r\ncharacter of the oil used. The phrase “Sardines packed in oil” should\r\nbe construed always to mean in the highest grade oil, that is, olive\r\noil. This phrase, however, is usually employed when inferior oils are\r\nused. Inasmuch as oil is not the name of any individual product but of\r\na large class of products, including that of both animal and vegetable\r\norigin, it is generally held that the term “oil” is not a sufficient\r\nindication of the character of the oil used. In all cases the packages\r\nshould designate the special kind of oil used in the preparation. The\r\naddition of chemical preservatives to sardines in so far as the author\r\nknows, is not practiced, at least not to any appreciable extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The French Fisheries._--The sardine fisheries in France are mostly\r\noff the coast of Brittany, and are subject to many very serious\r\nfluctuations. For instance, the present year, 1906, has been one\r\nof disaster to the French fisheries. What is the cause of the\r\ndisappearance of the pilchard (the true sardine) is not known. The\r\nfishermen think that large fish have driven the small ones either into\r\nthe Bay of Biscay or the Mediterranean, or even to the west shores of\r\nAfrica. The fish are thought to originate in the Mediterranean, and\r\ntheir name is derived from the fact that they were originally found in\r\ngreat quantities off the coast of Sardinia. When the spring comes and\r\nthe fine weather is established they migrate first along the coast of\r\nSpain, finally reaching the French coast some time during the month\r\nof May. By this time the young fish are nearly grown to a proper size\r\nfor catching. The fishing, however, does not really begin until July\r\nand is usually finished by November. The little town of Concarneau is\r\nthe seat of these fisheries. About two thousand small boats go out\r\nfrom this town and at or near this place are also the large canneries\r\nand packing establishments. The fishing grounds are about five miles\r\nfrom the coast and the small boats sail out from two to four o’clock\r\nin the morning. The fishing is by means of nets and a very important\r\npart of the work is the spreading of the bait upon the surface of the\r\nwater to attract the fish. The principal bait or _roque_ is the roe of\r\nthe cod, which sometimes reaches a price of $60 per barrel. Sometimes\r\na single boat will use from 30 to 40 barrels of bait. Only the most\r\nskilled fisherman, usually the master himself, is allowed to distribute\r\nthis precious material. As many as one hundred thousand fish have\r\nbeen caught in the net, though this magnitude of catch is, of course,\r\nexceptional. When the fish are brought ashore they are counted into\r\nbaskets, about 200 to a basket, and those unfit for use are thrown out.\r\nThey are taken to the canneries as quickly as possible to be cleaned,\r\nboiled, dipped in oil, and then hermetically sealed into a tin in which\r\nthey are sent into commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration._--The chief adulteration of sardines is found in\r\nmisbranding as to country of origin. The French catch has the highest\r\nreputation of any in the world and for this reason the label is often\r\nmade to represent the fish as of French origin when in reality they\r\nare caught on the shores of Spain or of other countries. Formerly the\r\nfish were brought in great numbers from the Spanish coast into France.\r\nThey were naturally much deteriorated in transit. Nevertheless they\r\nwere tinned and marked as of pure French origin. This practice has now\r\nbeen forbidden by law in France. The Norwegian fish known as Sprötten\r\n(sprats) on the German and Holland coasts are packed as sardines and\r\nsent into this country as sardines.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Scup.=--The scup is a fish (family Sparidæ) which is taken in great\r\nabundance on our Atlantic coast in the summer and autumn and is brought\r\nin immense quantities to the market. The proper name of the fish is\r\n_Stenotomus chrysops_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition._--\r\n\r\n                FRESH.          DRY.\r\n  Water,    74.99 percent\r\n  Protein,  18.52    „     75.33 percent\r\n  Fat,       5.11    „     19.25    „\r\n  Ash,       1.38    „      5.64    „\r\n\r\nThe flesh of this fish is a better balanced ration than that of the red\r\nsnapper, the proportion of fat being much larger.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Shad.=--One of the most important food fishes on the Atlantic coast\r\nis the shad. It is found along the whole Atlantic coast, coming into\r\nfresh water for spawning, where it is caught for food purposes. The\r\nshad begin to appear in the streams of the south Atlantic coast early\r\nin the winter and as the spring advances they go northward. They\r\nappear in the Potomac in April and May, and later in the Delaware and\r\nConnecticut rivers and other fresh-water streams further north. The\r\nfish is, therefore, to be had fresh upon the market over a long period\r\nof time. The common shad is known scientifically as _Alosa sapidissima_\r\n(Wilson). As a result of the work of the U. S. Bureau of Fisheries\r\nthe shad has been introduced into the waters of the Pacific coast\r\nwhere none was found originally. The shad fry were first introduced\r\ninto the Sacramento river and afterward into the Columbia river. The\r\nenvironments on the Pacific coast were found congenial. The fish soon\r\nfound grounds on which they could spawn, and they have spread over\r\nalmost the entire length of the Pacific coast. It has, of late, become\r\na very common and abundant food fish on the Pacific coast and has lost\r\nnone of its palatability by transplanting. Science has not been able to\r\nascertain anything of very great interest respecting the life of the\r\nshad in the sea. When they leave the rivers they practically disappear,\r\nand are not known again until the next spawning season returns. For\r\nspawning purposes the shad prefer a water temperature of from 55 to 65\r\ndegrees. Whenever the temperature goes above the latter figure they\r\nbegin to disappear. The males and females go in separate schools. The\r\nmales usually precede the females. It is stated by Jordan and Evermann\r\nthat of 61,000 shad received at the Washington market from March 19 to\r\n24, 99 percent were male. As the season advanced the males became very\r\nmuch less frequent and at the end extremely scarce. The U. S. Bureau of\r\nFisheries has taken especial pains to increase the number of shad in\r\nall waters. During the spring of 1900 there were artificially planted\r\nin the Atlantic coast streams over 240,000,000 young shad. One fish\r\noften contains as many as 150,000 eggs. The average number, however, is\r\nabout 30,000. Shad roe is the most valuable part of the fish and brings\r\na much higher price in the market than an equal weight of fish itself.\r\nPlanked shad is one of the greatest delicacies of the Washington\r\nmarkets. At Marshall Hall, opposite Mount Vernon, there are given a\r\ngreat many shad bakes during the season. Oak wood is placed in long\r\nlines and burned,--oak planks are set up on each side of the line of\r\nburning wood, inclined at an angle of about 60 or 70 degrees. On these\r\noak planks the shad are cooked, held usually by driving a nail through\r\nthe head,--the cut surface being exposed to the heat of the burning\r\nfire. In addition to being cooked in this way the fish absorbs a small\r\namount of the empyreumatic odors of the burning wood. During the baking\r\nthe shad are treated from time to time with melted butter. There is no\r\nother way which a shad can be cooked which renders it so delicious as\r\nby this primitive method. The shad, from an economic point of view, is\r\nthird in importance in the United States, only the salmon and the cod\r\nexceeding it in value. The annual catch of shad on the Atlantic sea\r\ncoast numbers from 10 to 20 million, weighing from 40 to 60 million\r\npounds and worth from one and one-half to two million dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Shad._--\r\n\r\n               FRESH.

Roe shad also are\r\nmore highly prized as a food fish than the male shad. As a result, roe\r\nshad sell for a much higher price on the market than the male shad. The\r\neggs are quite small, and as has already been said, occur in immense\r\nnumbers, the average number to a fish being about 30,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Shad Roe._--\r\n\r\n  Water,    71.2 percent\r\n  Protein,  23.4    „\r\n  Fat,       3.8    „\r\n  Ash,       1.6    „\r\n\r\nAside from the water of the roe, it is noticed that by far the most\r\nabundant component is the protein. This, of course, is what would be\r\nexpected of an egg product. The protein is a little more than six times\r\nas great as the fat. The ash contains large quantities of phosphorus,\r\nwhich exists in the original egg, largely in the form of lecithin,\r\nin which state it is regarded as most valuable for nourishing the\r\nphosphatic tissues of the body. Shad roe is eaten almost entirely in\r\nthe fresh state. It does not produce a pickled or cooked product of\r\nanything like the value of the sturgeon eggs. So far as the author\r\nknows no form of shad egg preparation similar to caviar is on the\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nThere are three species of shad in America, but the only one of great\r\nimportance is the common Atlantic shad which has been described.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Sheepshead.=--This abundant and important food fish exists in\r\nlarge numbers along the Atlantic coast. It also belongs to the Sparidæ\r\nand its scientific name is _Archosargus probatocephalus_. This species\r\nis found from Cape Cod to Texas. It is especially found in the vicinity\r\nof oyster beds, where it is destructive to the oysters. It is quite\r\nabundant in the Indian river, being, next to the mullet, the most\r\nfrequently found fish in those waters. Though strictly a salt-water\r\nfish, it often runs up into fresh waters. The fish is distinguished by\r\nthe number of broad silvery colored bands extending around its entire\r\nbody. The average weight of the sheepshead is three or four pounds,\r\nthough occasionally a fish three or four times that size is captured.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Sheepshead._--\r\n\r\n                FRESH.

Although a sea fish, it often enters\r\nrivers and becomes landlocked in lakes. It is found abundantly in Lakes\r\nChamplain and Memphremagog and many of the New England and Nova Scotian\r\nlakes. The smelt in early times was a very abundant fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Smelt._--Edible portion:\r\n\r\n                FRESH.          DRY.\r\n  Water,    79.16 percent\r\n  Protein,  17.37    „     84.31 percent\r\n  Fat,       1.79    „      8.65    „\r\n  Ash,       1.68    „      8.16    „\r\n\r\nThese data show that the flesh of the smelt is very rich in protein,\r\nthe fat falling to a very small proportion of the total edible\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Spanish Mackerel.=--This is a very highly prized fish and is eaten\r\nlargely in the fresh state along the Atlantic coast. Its scientific\r\nname is _Scomberomorus maculatus_. The catch is subject to great\r\nvariations. In early years the Spanish mackerel was scarcely known on\r\nour coast, but in the last forty years it has assumed considerable\r\nimportance. Although more abundant than formerly it still commands a\r\nvery high price. The weight of the full-grown mackerel is usually from\r\nfive to eight pounds, though occasionally very large individuals are\r\ntaken. Jordan and Evermann speak of one which was 41 inches long and\r\nweighed 25 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition._--Edible portion:\r\n\r\n               FRESH.          DRY.\r\n  Water,    68.10 percent\r\n  Protein,  20.97    „     67.25 percent\r\n  Fat,       9.43    „     29.56    „\r\n  Ash,       1.50    „      4.71    „\r\n\r\nIn this fish it is seen that the fat is a little less than one-third\r\nthe quantity of the protein.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sturgeon.=--The sturgeon belongs to the family of Acipenseridæ.\r\nThey are large fishes frequenting the sea and also the fresh waters\r\nof northern regions. Most of the species are anadromous, entering\r\nfresh water and ascending the streams in spring. There are two genera\r\nbelonging to this family and 20 species that are well defined, although\r\nabout 100 nominal species have been described. The white sturgeon or\r\nOregon sturgeon is found on the Pacific coast from Monterey north to\r\nAlaska. It ascends the large rivers during the spring, notably the\r\nSacramento, Columbia, and Fraser rivers. Some of them are very large\r\nand their value for food and commercial purposes has only been lately\r\nrecognized. They are principally valuable, however, for their eggs or\r\nroe, since it is from the eggs of sturgeon that caviar is made. The roe\r\nin the fresh state is worth from 25 to 30 cents a pound. The fresh fish\r\nare frozen and shipped to Eastern markets.\r\n\r\nThe common sturgeon (_Acipenser sturio_) frequents the east and north\r\nAtlantic coast and ascends the rivers in the spring, especially the\r\nDelaware. The quantity of sturgeon taken, however, has constantly\r\ndecreased for several years. The principal part of the caviar made in\r\nthe United States is procured from the common sturgeon and the Lake\r\nsturgeon, which is found in the Great Lakes, the upper Mississippi\r\nValley, and the Lake of the Woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preparation of Caviar._--After the eggs have been removed from the\r\nfish, they are placed in large masses upon a stand, the top of which\r\nis formed of a small-meshed screen. On the under side is placed a\r\nzinc-lined trough, about 18 inches deep, 2 feet wide and 4 feet long.\r\nThe operator gently rubs the mass of eggs back and forth over the\r\nscreen, whose mesh is just large enough to let the eggs drop through\r\nas they are separated from the enveloping membrane. They thus fall\r\ninto the trough from which they are drawn off into tubs through a\r\nsliding door in one end of the trough. After all the roe has been\r\nseparated, the tub is removed and a certain proportion of the best\r\nLuneberg salt is added and mixed with the eggs by careful stirring\r\nwith the hands. This is the most delicate part of the whole process,\r\nand the best results can be obtained by that proficiency which comes\r\nfrom long experience. After adding the salt, the eggs at first become\r\ndry, but in 10 or 15 minutes the salt has drawn from the eggs their\r\nwatery constituents and a copious brine is formed, which is poured off\r\nwhen the tub becomes too full. The salted eggs are then poured into\r\nfine-meshed sieves which hold about 10 pounds each, where they are\r\nallowed to drain for 8 to 20 hours. The eggs have now become the caviar\r\nof commerce, which is put in casks or cans of various sizes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Flesh of Sturgeon._--\r\n\r\n                FRESH.

The roe of a number\r\nof fishes is celebrated both for flavor and food value. The two most\r\nimportant roes are those of the sturgeon, used in the manufacture of\r\ncaviar, and the roe of shad, used principally in the fresh state.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Composition of Roe.=--The composition of shad roe, fresh sturgeon\r\ncaviar, and pickled caviar is given in the following table:\r\n\r\n  ---------------+---------+---------+---------+---------\r\n                 |  WATER. | PROTEIN.|   FAT.  |   ASH.\r\n  ---------------+---------+---------+---------+---------\r\n                 |_Percent_|_Percent_|_Percent_|_Percent_\r\n  Shad roe,      |  71.25  |  23.44  |   3.78  |   1.53\r\n  Fresh caviar,  |  56.97  |  27.87  |   2.85  |   2.31\r\n  Pickled caviar,|  50.92  |  27.92  |  13.59  |   7.57\r\n  ---------------+---------+---------+---------+---------\r\n\r\nThe above data show a marked difference between the composition of shad\r\nroe and sturgeon roe, the latter being very much richer in fat and\r\nalso containing a greater quantity of ash. The large quantity of ash\r\nin the pickled caviar is doubtless due to the common salt used in the\r\ncuring. There is not a very great difference between the composition\r\nof the roe and that of the flesh of fish. The roe is essentially a\r\nnitrogenous food, also with a considerable quantity of fat and with\r\na certain amount of mineral matter. It contains less water than the\r\nflesh of fish, and, therefore, pound for pound in the fresh state has\r\na larger quantity of nutrients. Otherwise, for food purposes, there is\r\nbut little difference. It is doubtless true, however, that the mineral\r\nmatters of the roe are somewhat different from those of the flesh of\r\nfish in containing a larger quantity of organic phosphorus in the form\r\nof lecithin.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Striped Bass.=--The striped bass or rock (_Roccus lineatus_) is a fish\r\nof the family Serranidæ and quite common in the Potomac. It occurs\r\ncommonly around the Atlantic coast. Its scientific name is _Roccus\r\nlineatus_. It is taken in all waters along the coast from the Carolinas\r\nto New England, and especially near the mouth of the Potomac and in\r\nChesapeake Bay. It is a fairly common as well as one of the best food\r\nfishes at Washington and in many of the fish markets on the Atlantic\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\n                FRESH.         DRY.\r\n  Water,    77.70 percent\r\n  Protein,  18.31    „     83.28 percent\r\n  Fat,       2.83    „     12.50    „\r\n  Ash,       1.16    „      5.22    „\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sole.=--The term “sole” is applied here to certain species of\r\nflounders and the two terms are sometimes used synonymously. The\r\ntrue soles, however, of which there are several species, belong to a\r\ndistinct though closely related family. The species of flounder to\r\nwhich the term “sole” is generally given is _Eopsetta jordani_. It\r\noccurs along the Pacific coast from Monterey to Puget Sound. Large\r\nnumbers are taken in Monterey Bay. The average weight of this “sole”\r\nis about three pounds. It is highly esteemed as a food fish. They are\r\ndried in great numbers by the Chinese, who suspend them by strings on\r\na frame placed on the roofs of the houses, where, after they become\r\ndry, they strike against each other when moved by the wind, producing\r\na sound which is something like that emanating from the leaves of a\r\nforest.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tautog.=--The _Tautoga onitis_ is one of the wrasse-fishes (family\r\nLabridæ) and is abundant along the Atlantic coast from New Brunswick to\r\nthe Carolinas. East of New York it is commonly called the “tautog.” On\r\nthe New York coast it is known as “blackfish,” and further south as the\r\n“oyster fish.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tilefish.=--The tilefish is interesting not because of its high food\r\nvalue but because of the fact that it was discovered by accident in\r\n1879 when a fisherman off the coast of Nantucket captured 5000 pounds\r\nof a fish which was new to him. The species was also new to science.\r\nThis fish disappeared as suddenly as it came and no more were caught\r\nuntil 1892. Since then they have been taken rather frequently. The\r\ntilefish reaches a length sometimes of three feet and a weight of 30\r\npounds. It is pronounced by experts to be the equal of the pompano.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Trout.=--Trout, of which there are many species, are greatly prized\r\nboth on account of their value as game fishes, affording sport for\r\nanglers, and because of their high palatable qualities. They belong\r\nto the same family as the Atlantic salmon and often it is difficult\r\nto distinguish by any of its common characteristics a trout from a\r\nsalmon. This is especially true of trout of western America. The\r\nspecies of trout which are most highly prized on the Pacific coast\r\nare the cut-throat trout (_Salmo clarkii_), the rainbow trout (_Salmo\r\niridens_), and the steel-head (_Salmo gairdneri_). The familiar silver\r\ntrout of Lake Tahoe is another closely related species. They are\r\ndistinguished by a remarkable system of spots of a circular form, black\r\nin color, and of varying size. The Lake Tahoe trout which is commonly\r\nsecured is not the same as the silver trout of Lake Tahoe but is of a\r\nlittle different character, and is also known as the Truckee Trout,\r\n“Pogy,” and “Snipe.” It reaches a weight of from three to six pounds\r\nand is sometimes served on the dining cars of the Central Pacific\r\nRailway, in running through Idaho and into California. Various other\r\nspecies of the trout are found in Utah, in the Rio Grande and the\r\nColorado, and in the lakes of Colorado. Perhaps the most important of\r\nthese is the steel-head trout occurring along the Pacific coast. The\r\nrainbow trout is also a fish that is highly prized along the Pacific\r\ncoast. The brook trout of western Oregon is also an important fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Trout of the Great Lakes._--The fish known as trout in the Great\r\nLakes belong to a different genus from those already mentioned, namely,\r\ngenus _Cristivomer_. It has, however, the typical spots, which are of\r\na grayish color instead of red or black like those of the other trout\r\nwhich have been mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe principal species which abounds in the Great Lakes is the Mackinaw\r\ntrout (_Cristivomer namaycush_). It is also found in the large lakes\r\nfrom Maine westward to the Pacific ocean and even to northern Alaska.\r\nThis is the largest species of trout. The average weight of the fish\r\nprobably does not exceed 15 or 20 pounds. Individual examples have been\r\nfound weighing over 100 pounds. There is only one common fish which\r\nexceeds it in weight, namely, the sturgeon. Next to the white fish it\r\nis the most important commercial fish of the Great Lakes. The supply of\r\nlake trout has been diminishing and the price increasing for several\r\nyears. The spawning season of lake trout begins in September and\r\ncontinues until December.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Lake Trout._--\r\n\r\n                FRESH.

DRY.\r\n  Water,    77.72 percent\r\n  Protein,  18.97    „     86.62 percent\r\n  Fat,       2.10    „      9.16    „\r\n  Ash,       1.21    „      5.39    „\r\n\r\nThe above data show that lake trout has a flesh which approximates in\r\ncomposition that of Pacific salmon, being quite rich in fat, while the\r\nbrook trout has a composition more like the Atlantic salmon, being\r\nvery rich in protein and poor in fat. Trout of all kinds are used\r\npractically in only a fresh state. The catch is not large enough to\r\nwarrant the establishment of canning factories and all that are caught\r\nin the northern and central northern lakes and streams find a ready\r\nmarket in a fresh state at much more remunerative prices than could be\r\nobtained by canning. It is always a fortunate circumstance when the\r\ncondition of the catch and of the market are such as to enable the fish\r\nto be eaten as fresh as possible from the water. Fish is a kind of food\r\nwhich is never improved by keeping in any way and is at its best the\r\nminute the fish is taken from the stream. The brook trout do not belong\r\nto the same genus as the lake trout but to the genus _Salvelinus_.\r\nThey have a general resemblance, however, to that genus. As a fish to\r\nbe caught by the hook and as a victim of sport the brook trout perhaps\r\noccupies the highest place among the fish of the country; especially\r\nis it sought for in the mountain streams, and it occurs in most parts\r\nof the northeastern United States. It extends from Maine to northern\r\nGeorgia and Alabama, especially in the Appalachian Mountains and west\r\nthrough the Great Lakes to the Mississippi, while in Canada it is found\r\nfrom Labrador to the Saskatchewan.\r\n\r\nThe brook trout has been especially cultivated by the U. S. Bureau of\r\nFisheries and introduced into waters in the United States where it is\r\nnot found naturally. The season for spawning for the brook trout is in\r\nthe autumn, when the water is growing colder, and continues from August\r\nto December, according to the latitude. In spawning time the fish come\r\nup into the smallest parts of the stream where shallow water can be\r\nfound. The eggs remain until the next spring, when they are hatched.\r\nThe brook trout varies greatly in size, according to the magnitude of\r\nthe stream. In the small streams it weighs often less than ¹⁄₄ pound,\r\nwhile in large streams it weighs 2 or 3 pounds. The large trout has\r\nalmost disappeared from the small streams as a result of the activity\r\nof fishermen.\r\n\r\nThere are many other species of trout which are known in different\r\nparts of the country. For instance, the Dublin Pond trout of Dublin\r\nPond, N. H., the Dolly Varden trout in the northern Pacific states and\r\nAlaska, the Sunapee trout in the northeastern states, and the Blueback\r\ntrout in Maine. These fishes all have practically the same quality,\r\nvarying only in minute details, and have the same value as a food.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Turbot.=--A species of halibut known as Greenland halibut\r\n(_Reinhardtius hippoglossoides_) is also known as turbot in this\r\ncountry. It occurs chiefly off the coast of Greenland, and is taken\r\nin the very coldest part of the year. The European turbot is _Psetta\r\nmaxima_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Weakfish.=--The weakfish belongs to the croaker family (Sciænidæ)\r\nand has a high value as a food fish, the flesh being rich in flavor\r\nand very tender and easily disintegrated, from which quality it is\r\nbelieved the name “weakfish” is derived. The common weakfish is the\r\nspecies _Cynoscion regalis_. It is also known in some localities as\r\nthe squeteague. The fish is rather long in proportion to its breadth\r\nand sometimes grows to a large size. Examples weighing over 25 pounds\r\nhave been captured. Very rarely, however, does a weakfish weigh more\r\nthan 10 pounds, and the average is perhaps not more than one-half that.\r\nThe weakfish is, particularly when young, a victim of the bluefish,\r\nand great numbers succumb to the ravages of its more powerful enemy.\r\nThe weakfish is found over the entire length of the Atlantic and Gulf\r\ncoasts as far north as the Bay of Fundy. The weakfish sometimes ascends\r\nthe tidal waters and congregates around the river mouths, where the\r\nfood is more abundant. While found on the markets in the North, it is\r\nmore highly prized in the southern markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition._--\r\n\r\n                FRESH.         DRY.\r\n  Water,    78.97 percent\r\n  Protein,  17.45    „     84.63 percent\r\n  Fat,       2.39    „     11.37    „\r\n  Ash,       1.19    „      5.64    „\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the weakfish, as shown by the above data, is one in which\r\nthe protein exists in very much greater proportion than the fat. It is\r\nnot so rich in protein, however, as some of the other species which\r\nhave been mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Whitefish.=--This fish occurs in large numbers in all our Great Lakes,\r\nand is an abundant article of food. Its scientific name is _Coregonus\r\nclupeiformis_. It inhabits the whole of the Great Lakes regions from\r\nLake Champlain to Lake Superior. It does not occur in very great\r\nabundance, if at all, west of Lake Superior, although it has been\r\nreported to have been found in the fresh water lakes both to the north\r\nand west of that region.\r\n\r\nThe common whitefish prefers the deep water of the lakes, coming\r\nonly into shallow water near the shore at spawning time, which, in\r\nthe Great Lakes, is from October to December. During the months of\r\nJanuary, February, and March the fishing for whitefish is practically\r\ndiscontinued, since the fish at that time have returned to deep water\r\nand are not accessible.\r\n\r\nThe size of the whitefish in the Great Lakes is not so great as\r\nthe extent of water would indicate. Probably three pounds would be\r\nan average size, although the individual fish range from 1¹⁄₂ to 6\r\npounds. The weight rarely, however, exceeds 4 or 5 pounds. Occasionally\r\nwhitefish have been found weighing as high as 20 pounds, but this is\r\nvery rare. The whitefish reaches its full average size about the end\r\nof the fourth year. The number of eggs which are found in the female\r\nfish is not so large as in the shad, but usually the number does not\r\nfall below 10,000 and sometimes reaches as high as 75,000. The eggs are\r\nvery small comparatively, and about 36,000 of them make a quart. The U.\r\nS. Bureau of Fisheries has done a great deal to increase the supply of\r\nwhitefish by planting millions of whitefish fry in suitable water.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Different Species of Whitefish._--There are many species of whitefish\r\nbesides the common whitefish which appear in the Great Lakes. Coulter’s\r\nwhitefish is found in the waters of British Columbia, but it is not\r\ndistributed very widely throughout the country. The Rocky Mountain\r\nwhitefish is very widely distributed, occurring in all suitable waters\r\nfrom the west slope of the Rockies to the Pacific. There is also a\r\nsubspecies of this fish occurring in the headwaters of the Missouri\r\nriver. Menominee whitefish occur in the lakes of New England, New York,\r\nand the Great Lakes,--it is also known as round whitefish, frostfish,\r\nshadwaiter, pilotfish, chivey, and blackback.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Whitefish._--\r\n\r\n                FRESH.         DRY.\r\n  Water,    69.83 percent\r\n  Protein,  22.06    „     76.00 percent\r\n  Fat,       6.49    „     21.51    „\r\n  Ash,       1.62    „      5.36    „\r\n\r\n\r\n_Average Composition of Fish._[16]--\r\n\r\n  Water,            76.06 percent\r\n  Solids,           23.94    „\r\n  Nitrogen,          3.51    „\r\n  Phosphoric acid,    .52    „\r\n  Sulfur,             .24    „\r\n  Fat,               1.45    „\r\n  Ash,               1.21    „\r\n  Protein,          21.92    „\r\n\r\n  [16] Average analysis of cod, halibut, bass, etc., used at the\r\n  hygienic table of the Bureau of Chemistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fluorids in Fish.=--Nearly all kinds of fish yield a distinct test\r\nfor fluorin which is not to be mistaken for an adulteration. The\r\nfluorin is found normally in the bones of the fish and sometimes in\r\ntraces in the flesh. The addition of fluorid as a preservative is\r\nhighly reprehensible, and its presence is indicated by the increase in\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Marketing of Fish.=--In the food act it is provided that no animals\r\nshall be used for food which have died otherwise than by slaughter.\r\nWhether or not this would apply to fish is a matter of some doubt.\r\nUnfortunately fish, as a rule, are allowed to die by being deprived of\r\noxygen, which they get from the water as it passes over their gills.\r\nThe common practice is to take the fish for commercial purposes in\r\nseines or other gear and allow them to die, as it were, by suffocation.\r\nThe greater number of fish exposed upon our markets have died in this\r\nway and are then packed in ice and kept until sold. The ideal way\r\nto treat fish would be to transfer them from the seine to a pool of\r\nwater, fresh or salt, in which they are kept alive until they are\r\nwanted for cooking. This method is practiced in some very high-grade\r\nrestaurants and hotels where the diner may pick for himself from the\r\npool the fish he desires to eat. It is evident that for commercial\r\npurposes where a cheap food is desirable a method of this kind could\r\nnot be practiced. It is a question which the hygienist as well as the\r\npractical man should consider, that is, whether or not it is possible\r\nto slaughter the fish and, as soon as they are taken, dress them, pack\r\ntheir carcasses in ice, and in this way deliver them to the markets.\r\nWhere fish are used for canning or salting purposes they are often\r\nslaughtered as soon as caught. This is particularly true of herring\r\ncaptured in the Potomac and Susquehanna rivers. It is an interesting\r\nproblem to study whether or not the flavor and character of the flesh\r\nare impaired by the suffocation process subsequent to their capture.\r\nIn all cases except in cold weather, the fish after capture, no matter\r\nwhether they are allowed to die by suffocation or slaughtered, should\r\nbe packed in ice and kept until the market is reached, which should be\r\nat as early a date as possible. Fish are never so good as when fresh\r\nand the fresher the better.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cold Storage.=--Fish is a product which is often found in cold storage\r\nin large numbers and kept there for a long time. The usual problem\r\nattending the cold storage of food is even more important when\r\napplied to fish. In cold storage fish are frozen solid and kept in\r\nthis state until ready for consumption. Just how long the palatability\r\nand wholesomeness of fish can be preserved when frozen solid has not\r\nbeen determined. It follows logically that the colder the temperature\r\nthe less the degree of deterioration, but it does not follow logically\r\nthat this temperature can be maintained indefinitely without injuring\r\nthe character of the product. One thing appears to be certain, namely,\r\nthat the consumer is entitled to know whether in any given case the\r\nfish he purchases is a fresh or a cold storage article. At the present\r\ntime, in so far as I know, there are no national, state, or municipal\r\nlaws whereby this fact can be ascertained. Without raising the question\r\nof comparative value or palatability there is no doubt but what the\r\nconsumer is entitled to know the character of the fish he purchases.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Canning Fish.=--Allusion has already been made to the practice of\r\ncanning fish, especially salmon. Great precautions must be used in\r\ncases of this kind, since fish is a food which tends to develop\r\npoisonous principles incident to decomposition. Canned fish, therefore,\r\nmust be thoroughly sterilized so that no fermentative action tending to\r\nproduce ptomain poison can possibly take place. It should be the duty\r\nof inspectors of food to frequently examine packages of canned fish to\r\ndetermine, first, by the external appearance of the can, and, second,\r\nby opening a certain number of them, whether any decomposition has\r\ntaken place. Too great care cannot be exercised in this matter, since\r\ndangerous and often fatal results follow the consumption of spoiled\r\nfish.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Drying and Salting Fish.=--The preservation of fish by pickling,\r\nsalting, drying, and smoking is a great industry and produces some of\r\nthe most palatable products. Mackerel, herring, and cod are types of\r\nfish which upon proper curing make a most delectable dish. Nothing but\r\nencouragement should be given to industries of this kind, but in order\r\nthat they be of their true value they should be conducted properly with\r\ndue regard to hygienic principles and for the sole purpose of making a\r\nwholesome and palatable product.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Adulteration of Fish Products.=--Attention has already been called\r\nto the adulteration of salmon by canning an inferior grade or even a\r\ndifferent kind of fish under the name of a better species. The same\r\nremark may be made respecting all fish, hake, haddock, and cusk being\r\noften offered as cod. In the case of sardines a similar practice is\r\nin vogue, and the small herring which are captured off the coast of\r\nMaine are often sold under the name of sardines. The substitution of\r\none variety of fish for another, however, is injurious only in the way\r\nof fraud, the substitute fish presumably being of equal wholesomeness\r\nto the other under whose name it is sold. On the contrary, the form\r\nof sophistication which permits the introduction of deleterious\r\nsubstances into fish food is highly objectionable from the dietetic\r\npoint of view. Following the general principles of nutrition, all\r\nchemical, non-condimental preservatives are to be rigidly excluded\r\nfrom fish products. This rule excludes boric acid, borax, benzoic acid\r\nand benzoates, sulfites, formaldehyde, and all other forms of chemical\r\npreservatives.\r\n\r\nWhen fish are packed in oil the character of the oil used should\r\nbe made known to the consumer. Especially is this true if from the\r\nlocality where the fish is preserved and the general method of packing\r\nthe consumer is led to believe that a high-grade oil such as olive oil\r\nhas been used.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Value of Fish as Food.=--From the statements which have been made\r\nin connection with fish in particular and the analyses which have\r\nbeen given it is seen that fish is a food of a peculiarly nitrogenous\r\ncharacter. The edible portions, exclusive of water, are at least\r\nthree-fourths, and probably more composed of protein. The other edible\r\nnutritive product is fat or fish oil. The mineral nutrients compose\r\nthe remaining edible portion of fish after the protein and fat are\r\nconsidered. The mineral portions of fish cannot be regarded as not\r\nnutritious since they contain phosphoric acid and lime, which are\r\nessential ingredients of food. The flesh of fish, however, as it has\r\nbeen seen, is not a complete ration, but is lacking in carbohydrates,\r\nand for this reason fish should be eaten with potatoes, rice, or other\r\nhighly starchy foods. The value of fish as a food is unquestionable and\r\nits more general consumption would doubtless prove beneficial.\r\n\r\nThose who live in the interior of large and extensive regions where\r\nfresh water fish are not very abundant do not appreciate the value of\r\nfish as food as do those who live upon the coasts washed by salt water\r\nand near the interior fresh waters where an abundant supply of fish is\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHELLFISH.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Clams.=--Clams are shellfish which, though not so extensively used as\r\nthe oyster, are valued food products. The clams of commerce are of two\r\nkinds. The species known as long or soft clam is abundant on the New\r\nEngland coast, and is of considerable commercial importance both fresh\r\nand as a canned product. This is the clam used at clam bakes, for which\r\nthe New England coast is famous. Its technical name is _Mya arenaria_.\r\n\r\nThe other species, the round or hard clam, northward known as quahog,\r\nis the most common clam of the markets south of New York. Its\r\nscientific name is _Venus mercenaria_.\r\n\r\nA very small round clam is known as the little neck. This has a flavor\r\nwhich is extremely delicate and it takes the place, in the warm months,\r\nof the blue point oyster on the menus of the hotels and restaurants.\r\nThe clam may be considered as a supplemental shellfish to the oyster,\r\nbeing most delicious and most abundant during the closed oyster\r\nseason. The average weight of the round clam is about 60 grams, of\r\nwhich about one-fourth is flesh, one-fourth liquid, and one-half shell\r\nand refuse. There are many specimens very much larger than this but the\r\nweight is given for those usually eaten.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Clams._--Edible portion:\r\n\r\n  Water,         78.57 percent\r\n  Protein,       14.86    „\r\n  Fat,            1.78    „\r\n  Ash,            2.49    „\r\n  Undetermined,   2.30    „\r\n\r\nThe liquid which escapes upon the opening of the shell is composed\r\nchiefly of water and salt and its composition is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Water,         96.02 percent\r\n  Protein,         .65    „\r\n  Fat,            None\r\n  Common salt,    2.81    „\r\n  Undetermined,    .52    „\r\n\r\nThe flesh of clams, it is seen, is not very different from that of fish\r\nin general. It is composed chiefly of water and of the nutrients the\r\nprotein is the predominating constituent. The ash content is somewhat\r\nhigher than is the case with fish.\r\n\r\nIf the flesh and fluid substance of the clam be considered together the\r\ncomposition of the whole mass is represented by the following data:\r\n\r\n  Water,         86.11 percent\r\n  Protein,        8.71    „\r\n  Fat,            1.01    „\r\n  Ash,            2.63    „\r\n  Undetermined,   1.54    „\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Water-free Substance of the Flesh._--\r\n\r\n  Protein,       69.37 percent\r\n  Fat,            8.32    „\r\n  Ash,           11.64    „\r\n  Undetermined,  10.67    „\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Dry Substance of the Liquid Portion._--\r\n\r\n  Protein,       16.37 percent\r\n  Fat,             .10    „\r\n  Ash,           70.41    „\r\n  Undetermined,  13.12    „\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Dry Substance of the Flesh and Liquid Together._--\r\n\r\n  Protein,       62.81 percent\r\n  Fat,            7.30    „\r\n  Ash,           18.92    „\r\n  Undetermined,  10.97    „\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Lobster= (_Homarus americanus_).--The lobster is a crustacean\r\nwhich occurs along the northern Atlantic coast. Formerly it was so very\r\nabundant that it was almost a drug on the market. In the last quarter\r\nof a century the increase in the consumption of the lobster has been\r\nmore rapid than the increased growth, so that the price has become\r\nhigher and higher; and this, to a certain extent, is limiting the\r\nconsumption. The coast of Maine is especially the fishing grounds for\r\nthe American lobster, though it is found much further south and also\r\nin great abundance further north. The lobster varies greatly in size.\r\nThe law, at the present time, prevents very young lobsters from being\r\nsent into commerce. They are usually from 10.5 to 15 inches in length,\r\nthough occasionally examples of enormous size are taken. The edible\r\nportion of the lobster is the liquid and the flesh of the body, claws,\r\nand tail. Only about one-half the weight of the lobster, including the\r\nliquid, therefore, is edible. The rest is refuse. In a lobster weighing\r\na thousand grams (2.2 pounds), five hundred grams (1.1 pound) will be\r\nthe average edible portion, and the other half the refuse and loss.\r\nThe average lobster of the present day, perhaps, weighs scarcely two\r\npounds, though in former times the weight was very much greater because\r\nthe younger and smaller lobsters were not sent to the market. The color\r\nof the lobster as it comes from the water is dark green, almost black\r\nat times. Heat changes the color of the shell, so that after boiling or\r\nbaking the lobster becomes red. The flesh of the lobster is decidedly\r\nsweet, owing to the large quantity of glycogen which it contains. There\r\nis only one kind of meat that is eaten which approaches the lobster in\r\nits content of glycogen, and that is horse meat.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Lobster._--Edible portion:\r\n\r\n                 FRESH.

Numerous species of crabs are used for food.\r\nThese are used in two forms--as hard-shelled or soft-shelled crabs. The\r\nspecies most valued is _Callinectes hastatus_. It is very abundant on\r\nthe middle and south Atlantic coast. Crabs are quite abundant on the\r\nPacific coast also. About 44 percent of the total weight of the crab is\r\nedible and 56 percent shell and refuse. In the edible portion about 77\r\npercent is water and 23 percent solid matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Water-free Substance of the Crab._--\r\n\r\n  Protein,  72.56 percent\r\n  Fat,       8.55    „\r\n  Ash,      13.64    „\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the crab is, therefore, essentially a nitrogenous food,\r\ncontaining only a small quantity of fat. A considerable portion of the\r\nash is common salt.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Crawfish.=--The crawfish may be regarded as a fresh-water lobster. It\r\nis found practically over the whole of the United States in the fresh\r\nwaters but is not used to any extent for food purposes, except on the\r\nPacific coast. It contains even a less proportion of edible matter\r\nthan the lobster. The refuse, shell, etc., form about five-sixths of\r\nits weight. In the edible portion the water constitutes 81.22 percent,\r\nwhile the solid matters are only 18.78 percent.\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Water-free Substance of the Crayfish._--\r\n\r\n  Protein,  85.19 percent\r\n  Fat,       2.45    „\r\n  Ash,       6.98    „\r\n\r\n\r\n=Canned Lobster, Clams, and Crabs.=--As in the case of oysters, there\r\nis a large industry in the United States engaged in the canning of\r\nthe flesh of lobsters, clams, and crabs. The same precautions should\r\nbe observed in the eating of these canned products as those mentioned\r\nin the case of salmon. Numerous instances of illness and sometimes of\r\ndeath have been recorded as the result of eating these canned products\r\nwhich have been imperfectly sterilized. When the flesh is canned\r\nimmediately after the capture of the animal, before any incipient\r\ndecomposition has taken place and when the sterilization is perfect,\r\nthe canned product can be eaten without fear. Where the health of the\r\npeople is so seriously involved, the factories where these products\r\nare prepared should be carefully inspected either by the municipal,\r\nstate, or federal authorities. All material used in canning which is\r\nnot perfectly fresh from the water is to be rejected and the processes\r\nemployed in the preparation and sterilization must be those which will\r\neffectively secure a complete immunity from subsequent fermentation and\r\nthe development of ptomain products.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Canned Lobster (Dry Substance)._--\r\n\r\n  Protein,  81.46 percent\r\n  Fat,       4.64    „\r\n  Ash,      11.23    „\r\n\r\nAs seen from the above the composition of the dry substance in canned\r\nlobster, except content of water, is not perceptibly different from\r\nthat of the fresh sample.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Dry Substance of Canned Crabs._--\r\n\r\n  Protein,  79.10 percent\r\n  Fat,       7.55    „\r\n  Ash,       9.68    „\r\n\r\n\r\n=Shrimp= (_Crangon vulgaris_).--The shrimp is a highly valued article\r\nof food, especially when it can be had fresh or properly canned.

This is a most reprehensible form of adulteration.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Canned Shrimps.=--In the total dry edible portion, including solids in\r\nthe liquid contents of the can, are found:\r\n\r\n  Protein,   86.89 percent\r\n  Fat,        3.44    „\r\n  Crude ash,  8.84    „\r\n\r\nIn edible portion (flesh plus liquids):\r\n\r\n  Water,                  70.80 percent\r\n  Water-free substance,   29.20    „\r\n  Protein,                25.38    „\r\n  Fat,                     1.00    „\r\n  Crude ash,               2.58    „\r\n  Extractives,             0.24    „\r\n  Nitrogen,                4.06    „\r\n  Total edible portion,  100.00    „\r\n\r\nThe above data show that the shrimp in the canned state has less water\r\nin it than in the fresh state, and contains one-fourth of its weight of\r\nprotein.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Aquatic Reptiles.=--All forms of turtle may be used for edible\r\npurposes, both of the fresh-water and salt-water species. Both the\r\nturtle and terrapin are amphibious animals; that is, they can live\r\neither in the water or on the land. Among the turtles the marine\r\nvariety known as the green turtle is most highly prized for food\r\npurposes. Its Latin name is _Chelonia mydas_. It grows sometimes to an\r\nenormous size, weighing several hundred pounds, and specimens weighing\r\n50 and 100 pounds are not unusual. It is utilized chiefly for making\r\nsoup, and green turtle soup is considered of high quality by experts.\r\nThe flesh is also edible, and in the making of some varieties of green\r\nturtlesoup pieces of the flesh are included.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Green Turtle._--The edible portion of the green\r\nturtle has the following composition:\r\n\r\n  Water,    79.78 percent\r\n  Protein,  19.83    „\r\n  Fat,        .53    „\r\n  Ash,       1.20    „\r\n\r\nThe edible portion of the green turtle is not very large in proportion\r\nto its weight, as it forms only from 20 to 24 percent of the whole\r\nweight of the turtle.\r\n\r\nAmong the reptiles there are several aquatic species which are used\r\nas food. The most noted of these is the diamond-back terrapin, which\r\nis found in the salt-water bays, lagoons, and marshes of our Atlantic\r\ncoast from New Jersey to Texas. Its center of greatest abundance is\r\nin Chesapeake Bay. There is no fish or other water animal that has\r\na higher value for edible purposes than the terrapin. The extreme\r\ndelicacy of its flavor, the richness of its aroma, and its easy\r\ndigestibility give to it a rank which perhaps no other usual food\r\nproduct possesses. In addition to this the increased scarcity of\r\nthe terrapin, especially the more famous variety of it, namely, the\r\ndiamond-back, has gradually increased the cost until at the present\r\ntime the terrapin is eaten only by the rich. In the United States it\r\nexists along the whole Atlantic coast from New York southward and also\r\nalong the Gulf coast. Formerly it was most abundant on the Maryland\r\ncoast, but the nearness of this field to the great markets of the\r\ncountry has resulted in such a depletion of the stock as to make the\r\nterrapin very scarce. Many attempts have been made at artificial\r\ngrowing of terrapin and these have been more or less successful, but\r\nhave not met with pronounced success which has been expected. The\r\nenclosure in which the terrapin are kept, viz., the “crawl,” is a\r\nfeature in the artificial cultivation or breeding of these marine\r\nvertebrates. It is to be hoped that greater success in the future will\r\nattend the artificial breeding of terrapin, since the natural stock\r\nseems well on the way to extinction.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Terrapin._--Edible portion:\r\n\r\n               FRESH.

It\r\noccurs in almost all parts of the United States in the fresh waters and\r\nin external appearance resembles to some extent the oyster, but the\r\nshell is usually smoother. In the mussel is often developed concretions\r\nof the carbonate of lime in a particular form known as pearls. In fact\r\nthe chief value of the mussel is in the supply of pearls which they\r\nfurnish, since their flesh, although often eaten, is not considered\r\nvery palatable nor desirable. Pearls may be found in mussels in\r\nevery locality, but in some regions they are more abundant than in\r\nothers,--for instance, the mussels of Wisconsin are especially noted\r\nfor the occurrence of the pearls. Pearls are also frequently found in\r\noysters, but by no means so frequently as in the mussel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Mussel._--The edible portion of the mussel forms\r\nabout one-half its weight.\r\n\r\n  Water,         78.64 percent\r\n  Protein,       12.51    „\r\n  Fat,            1.67    „\r\n  Ash,            1.73    „\r\n  Undetermined,   5.45    „\r\n\r\n\r\n=Oysters.=--Oysters belong to a class of animals known as mollusks.\r\nThey grow in salt or brackish water and are found along almost the\r\nwhole of the coast of the United States. They exist in the greatest\r\nabundance along the coast in the vicinity of Long Island Sound,\r\nNorfolk, Virginia, along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, off the coast\r\nof Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, and along the Pacific coast from\r\nSan Francisco to the northern limits of Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Size._--The size of an oyster depends greatly upon its food and also\r\nupon its species. There are some varieties which at a given period of\r\ngrowth are naturally very much larger than others. The larger variety\r\ngrows near Norfolk and along the Gulf coast. A smaller species is\r\nespecially abundant on the Pacific coast, though a number of very large\r\nspecimens of oysters have been found on that coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Age._--An oyster is eaten at any time after two years. Oysters,\r\nhowever, three or four years old are, perhaps, in all respects the\r\nbest. The age is determined largely by the appearance of the shell,\r\nexperts being able to practically determine the age of an oyster by an\r\nexamination of the shell.\r\n\r\nThe oyster grows within a shell which is composed almost exclusively\r\nof carbonate of lime. The periphery of the shell is ovoid in shape,\r\nirregular, and the surface, especially of old oysters, is corrugated,\r\nrough, and unattractive. The interior of the shell is smooth and\r\ngenerally white, but sometimes has a blue or reddish tinge. The shells\r\nof edible oysters vary in size from 2 to 6 inches in length and from\r\n2 to 4 inches in width. The oysters sold in the market are known by\r\nvarious names, usually derived from the location from which they come.\r\nA small variety distinguished by a blue color on the inside of the\r\nshell is known as blue points. The real blue points come only from Long\r\nIsland. Another variety named Rockaway is also a Long Island variety,\r\nand should come exclusively from Rockaway or vicinity. Shrewsbury is\r\nanother highly prized variety from the neighborhood of Shrewsbury, New\r\nJersey. Buzzards Bay, James River, Norfolk, Lynnhaven, Rappahannock,\r\nStony Creek, Saddle Rock, etc., are names commonly found in the trade.\r\nUnfortunately, the name of the location is not always an indication of\r\nthe actual source from which the oysters may have come. For instance\r\nthe term “blue point” is now very commonly given to small oysters not\r\nexceeding 2 or 2¹⁄₂ inches in length with a correspondingly diminished\r\nbreadth. On the contrary “saddle rock” is a name given to very large\r\noysters no matter from what region they may come. It is a common\r\npractice to separate the oysters taken from one location into groups of\r\nsimilar size and attach to each group a special name which may or may\r\nnot be indicative of location.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cultivation of Oysters._--The natural beds of oysters are rapidly\r\nexhausted by the free fishing which is in some cases allowed, and\r\nthe supply must be kept up by proper cultivation. Oyster farming\r\nhas become a great industry along all parts of the coasts where the\r\nconditions are well suited to culture. The ideal conditions are inlets\r\nwhere the oysters are protected from the action of ocean waves and\r\nwhere abundant food can be derived from the low marshy grounds in the\r\nvicinity. The laws in force in the states protect the oyster farms\r\nfrom poachers and deeds are given for oyster beds which are beyond the\r\nlow water line. The conditions of culture vary in various states. The\r\npublic beds are also protected by law in many states and incipient\r\nwar is sometimes carried on between the authorities of one state and\r\nthe poachers from other states. Maryland, especially, has laws of a\r\nvery strict character respecting the taking of oysters, and the state\r\nfurnishes armed forces for the protection of public beds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Season for Oysters._--The best season for oysters on the Atlantic\r\ncoast of the United States extends from September first to May. These\r\ndates may also be applied to oysters of the Gulf and Pacific coasts.\r\nIt is commonly said that all months which have an “R” in them are\r\nsuitable for eating oysters. In point of fact oysters are eaten the\r\nyear round, especially on the Atlantic coast, though to a very limited\r\nextent during the spring and summer months. Those who own their own\r\noyster beds are privileged to take oysters at all seasons, and it is\r\nnot unusual that a restaurant furnishes oysters during the whole year,\r\nthose in the closed season being derived from private beds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Life of an Oyster._--After an oyster is taken from its bed it may be\r\nkept alive for a long time at a temperature which does not rise too\r\nhigh nor sink too low. The best temperature for keeping oysters alive\r\nis about 40 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit. The oysters should be protected\r\nfrom the sunlight by a proper covering in a cool place and kept moist\r\nwith sea water or brine which is sprinkled over them in such a way as\r\nto come in contact with each oyster in the heap. Oysters kept under\r\nthese conditions often remain in an excellent state for consumption for\r\na week or ten days or even longer. If such conditions are maintained\r\noysters may be shipped in bulk to all parts of the country in cars kept\r\ncool, and this is the best way in which oysters should be distributed\r\nfor consumption in a fresh state.\r\n\r\nThe treating of oysters with fresh water in order to swell them and\r\nthus make them appear larger and plumper than they really are is a\r\ntreatment which is reprehensible in every respect. Not only does\r\nit deceive the customer in regard to the size of the oyster but it\r\ndeprives the oyster of its proper taste and flavor. “Soaked” oysters\r\nquickly lose their flavor, whereas the oysters kept as above described\r\nand sprinkled with brine retain their natural flavor and odor. The\r\nobjection to the transportation of oysters in this way is that the\r\nshell usually weighs many times more than the oyster and the same\r\nrate of freight must be paid upon it as upon the oyster itself.\r\nNevertheless, the fact remains that fresh oysters should be eaten\r\ndirectly after removal from the shells. As soon as the shell is removed\r\nand the oyster killed by this removal it begins to deteriorate and in a\r\nshort time its flavor and aroma are impaired. It is a common practice\r\nin many cities, even where oysters are delivered fresh daily from\r\ntheir beds, to open large quantities of them and put them in tubs and\r\nsell them from these tubs to customers. It thus happens that customers\r\noften buy oysters that have been opened 24 hours or more and which are\r\nnaturally of a very changed flavor. Strict regulations in regard to the\r\nuse of fresh oysters, favoring their being opened when they are ready\r\nfor consumption or requiring that they should be kept in the condition\r\nof palatability and properly kept cool until ready for consumption,\r\nshould be observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Shipment of Opened Oysters._--Opened oysters are shipped extensively\r\nto all parts of the country. After removal from the shell the oysters\r\nare washed to remove the natural water, since this becomes ropy during\r\nshipment. They are then packed in wooden tubs of various sizes, a\r\npiece of ice added, covered, and delivered to the fast express or\r\nfreight service. In this way the oysters may be kept free of dangerous\r\ndeterioration for several days. In such cases care must be exercised\r\nto keep the temperature low and to secure a sanitary environment.\r\nThus protected the oysters should arrive at their destination without\r\nany further change than the necessary loss of flavor caused by the\r\nconditions of preparation and transportation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Proportion of Shell and Oysters._--The following illustration (Report\r\nof the U. S. Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries for 1888, page 784)\r\nshows the relative proportion of the flesh, liquid, and refuse for two\r\nor three varieties of oysters:\r\n\r\n  Name: Oysters (“East Rivers”).\r\n\r\n  Locality: Cow Bay, Long Island Sound, New York.\r\n\r\n  Received: April 8, 1881, from E.

There is also about 10 pounds of liquid\r\nor juice that escapes when the oyster is opened. There is an average\r\nof 80 pounds of shell and other refuse. When it is remembered that, as\r\nwill be shown in the table given below, in 10 pounds of the meat there\r\nis over 80 percent of water it is seen that the actual nourishment\r\ncontained in 100 pounds of oysters is reduced to a little over 1 pound.\r\nThere is a general opinion that oysters are a very nutritious food and\r\nthis is true in so far as the nitrogenous element of food, that is, the\r\nprotein, is concerned, and in proportion to the quantity present. As a\r\nnourishing food the oyster cannot be considered as worthy of any very\r\ngreat esteem. It must be confessed that it will continue to be used as\r\nit has been in the past, that is, practically, as a condimental food\r\nsubstance and not to satisfy hunger nor provide the heat and energy of\r\nthe human activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Process of Floating._--Reference has already been made to the practice\r\nof soaking oysters in fresh water for the purpose of making them\r\nmore plump and increasing their weight. This, in the language of the\r\nfisherman, is called “floating,” “drinking,” or “laying out.” By this\r\nprocess the body of the oyster affects a plumpness and largeness which\r\nmaterially increases its selling qualities, as it increases its weight\r\nand size and, therefore, the profits of the dealer. The principle of\r\nthis process depends upon the fact that when a soft substance like an\r\noyster, containing a mineral salt in its composition, is brought in\r\ncontact with water, a process of diffusion takes place which is known,\r\nin chemical physics, as osmosis, whereby water passes through the cell\r\nwalls and enters the cells of the oyster and the mineral substance\r\nthereof is forced out into the external water. Larger volumes of water\r\npass into the cells than accompany the particles of mineral matter to\r\nthe outside of the cells and the result is a swelling of the oysters\r\nand consequent increase in the size and weight by the addition of pure\r\nwater, but at the expense of the natural salt, mostly chlorid of sodium\r\nor common salt, which the oyster contains.\r\n\r\nThe U. S. Bureau of Fisheries has been experimenting to show the change\r\nwhich takes place with the following results:--\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS OF WEIGHTS, ETC., OF SPECIMENS OF OYSTERS.\r\n\r\n  ----------------+-------------------------------------+\r\n                  |            JAMES RIVER.[17]         |\r\n  ----------------+------------------+------------------+\r\n                  |                  |                  |\r\n  CONSTITUENTS.   |    From beds.    |   From floats.   |\r\n                  +------------------+------------------+\r\n                  | Lab.

---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n_Result of Treatment._--As shown by the data the first result is one\r\nwhich would naturally be expected, namely, that the total weight of\r\nthe oyster thus inflated with water is increased relatively to the\r\ntotal weight of the shell since no change takes place in the weight\r\nof the shell during floating. The gain of weight in the oyster is due\r\nto the absorption of the water, although there is a loss of mineral\r\nsalt. The average gain of the oyster was, in round numbers, 10 percent.\r\nThe danger of infecting oysters thus treated with any germs, which\r\nmay be present in the water or ice used, should also be taken into\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nIn respect of the composition of the oyster itself when subjected to\r\nfloating the chief change is in the increase of the water content. As\r\nhas already been said the process of floating is fatal to the flavor\r\nand palatability of the product.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration._--The chief adulterations of oysters are the “floating”\r\nabove described and the treatment of the “shucked” oysters with\r\nformaldehyde, boron compounds, and other preservatives to keep them\r\nfrom spoiling. These processes are thoroughly reprehensible and are\r\nrapidly disappearing. The consumer who lives near the source of\r\nsupply should never eat any but freshly shelled oysters and those at\r\na distance confine themselves to the properly prepared and shipped\r\narticle. The chief delight of the epicure is the freshness, and not the\r\nquantity of nourishment of this justly prized bivalve.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Average Composition of Oysters:_[19]--\r\n\r\n  Water,            60.08 percent\r\n  Solids,           39.92    „\r\n  Nitrogen,          1.56    „\r\n  Phosphoric acid,    .42    „\r\n  Sulfur,             .19    „\r\n  Fat,               9.48    „\r\n  Ash,               1.77    „\r\n  Protein,           9.73    „\r\n\r\n  [19] Average of samples used at Hygienic Table, Bureau of Chemistry.\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMAL OILS.\r\n\r\nThe same distinction is made between oils and fats for animal products\r\nas has been made for the vegetable preparations further on. An animal\r\nfat remains solid or semisolid at the ordinary temperature of the\r\nliving room. An animal oil, on the other hand, is one which at ordinary\r\ntemperature is a liquid. Animal oils, as a rule, are not used for\r\nedible purposes directly, but are used to some extent in cooking, and\r\nto a large extent as medicinal food. Inasmuch as these oils are used\r\nfor medicinal food purposes, those which are most important in this\r\nuse may be very properly described in this manual. As these oils are\r\nderived both from sea and land animals they are often conveniently\r\ndivided into marine animal oils and terrestrial animal oils. There is\r\nalso a marked difference as a rule between the oils of marine origin\r\nand those of terrestrial origin. The oils of marine origin, as a rule,\r\nhave a very high iodin number while the animal oils of terrestrial\r\norigin have an iodin number not much greater than the fats from which\r\nthey are derived. This distinction corresponds somewhat closely to\r\nthose vegetable oils which belong to the drying and non-drying variety.\r\nThe iodin number represents the percentage of iodin absorbed by a unit\r\nweight of substance. If one gram of an oil absorb 0.67 gram of iodin,\r\nthe iodin number is 67. The marine oils correspond to the dry vegetable\r\noils and the terrestrial oils to the non-drying vegetable oils. While\r\nthis difference is one which is marked, it does not always exist in\r\neach individual case.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARINE ANIMAL OILS.\r\n\r\nThe marine animal oils may be conveniently divided into fish oils,\r\nliver oils, and blubber oils. Of these the liver oils are the most\r\nimportant from an edible point of view or a medicinal edible point of\r\nview. The fish oil and blubber oil are used chiefly for illuminating\r\nand other technical purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fish Oils.=--These are obtained by rendering from all parts of a fish\r\nwhere fat exists. The herring, sardine, salmon, and the menhaden are\r\nthe fish which are chiefly used for getting oil of this kind. The fish\r\noils have very much improved in quality since the steamer has taken the\r\nplace of the sail boat for gathering the fish. During the days of the\r\nsail boat the fish were often kept for ten days after seining before\r\nthey were brought ashore. The decomposition which took place would\r\nnaturally affect the oil. At the present day the steamers fishing close\r\nto the shores deliver their products much more frequently, often the\r\nsame day they are caught, and thus a better quality of oil is produced.\r\nIn this country menhaden is the chief fish used for obtaining oil.\r\nThe scientific name of menhaden is _Brevoortia tyrannus_. These fish\r\nappear in enormous quantities around the Atlantic coast from May until\r\nNovember. It is estimated that nearly one-half million tons have been\r\ntaken of these fish during a season. Menhaden oil is rarely if ever\r\nused for edible purposes. It is used principally in the leather trade\r\nand sometimes in the adulteration of cod liver oil made in Newfoundland.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sardine Oil._--Sardine oil is principally prepared in Japan from the\r\nJapan sardine (_Clupea sardinus_). It is not used to any extent for\r\nedible purposes. It is also prepared to some extent in the boiling of\r\nsardines in France preparatory to packing in oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Salmon Oil._--This oil is obtained in large quantities on the Pacific\r\ncoast. It is one of the fish oils which has an agreeable odor and taste\r\nand, therefore, can be used for edible purposes. It has a specific\r\ngravity at 15 degrees of about .926 and its iodin number is about 160.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cod Liver Oil._--The most important of all the animal oils for food\r\npurposes is the oil which is obtained from the liver of the cod (_Gadus\r\ncallarias_). Cod liver oil is valuable for food purposes not on account\r\nof its odor and taste, which are usually quite disagreeable, but by\r\nreason of the specific effect which it is often said to exercise in\r\ncases of emaciation and general disorder of the functional activities\r\nof the body. It is a food or medicine, whichever it may be best called,\r\nwhich is highly prized in tuberculosis and similar diseases. The oil\r\nis chiefly prepared in the Loffoden Islands. Different classes of oil\r\nare prepared which are differentiated chiefly by their color, the\r\nlighter the color the higher the quality of the oil. The chemical\r\ncomposition of cod liver oil is extremely complex, many different\r\nkinds of substances having been found in it by various authorities.\r\nThe probability is that many of these supposed substances are only\r\nmixtures of others. Yet it cannot be denied that the number of chemical\r\ncompounds occurring in cod liver oil is very much greater than that\r\nwhich occurs in ordinary oils. Both the medicinal and food values of\r\nthe oil are often attributed to these bodies which occur in minute\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Properties._--Cod liver oil at 15 degrees has a specific gravity of\r\n.922. Its iodin number varies very greatly but is always high, ranging\r\nfrom 150 to 180. Its refractive index is also very high, namely 1.47.\r\n\r\nAn important constituent of cod liver oil is cholesterol. Cod liver oil\r\ncontains naturally a small quantity of iodin and this natural compound\r\nof iodin is one of the properties to which much of its medicinal virtue\r\nhas been attributed. The quantity present is extremely minute, and\r\nprobably never exceeds .002 of one percent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Cod Liver Oil._--Owing to its increasing price cod\r\nliver oil has been subjected to many forms of adulteration. The chief\r\nadulteration consists in the admixture of fish liver oil of lower\r\nquality or the use of blubber oil. Seal and whale oils have been used\r\nvery extensively in the adulteration of cod liver oil. Japan fish\r\noil and, in fact, all other fish oils which are of a character not\r\nto disguise the properties of cod liver oil have been used. It is\r\nevident that it is with extreme difficulty that the presence of these\r\nadulterants can be detected, especially if they are used in small\r\nquantities. The only certain method of guarantee of the purity of a cod\r\nliver oil is in the proper inspection and control of the manufacturing\r\nworks. The livers of many other kinds of fish are employed in the\r\nmanufacture of cod liver oil, but the other varieties have little\r\nvalue as compared with the cod liver oil itself and they are probably\r\nused almost exclusively in the adulteration of the genuine article.\r\nThe Norwegian cod fish gives a much better character of oil than those\r\ncoming from the Atlantic coast of America. In fact the latter product\r\nis of little medicinal food value and is used chiefly in the leather\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Blubber Oil.=--Blubber oil includes the oils made from seals, whales,\r\nturtles, etc., and is used exclusively for technical purposes, unless\r\nsurreptitiously placed in cod liver oil as an adulterant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\nMILK AND MILK PRODUCTS AND OLEOMARGARINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILK.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Limitation of Name.=--By the term “milk,” unless qualified in some\r\nway, is meant a lacteal secretion of the healthy cow, free of colostrum\r\nand of standard quality. If the milk of other mammals is meant the\r\nname of the class of animal is used in connection with the term, such\r\nas ewe’s milk, goat’s milk, etc. Milk is one of the most important\r\narticles of commerce and, by reason of its composition, high nutritive\r\ncharacter, and easy digestibility, it is not only the natural food of\r\ninfants but a most important food for children and adults. It is also\r\nan indispensable food in many, if not most, cases of disease where\r\nnutrition is impaired. In some cases life may often be sustained over a\r\ncritical period by the use of milk as a food where other forms of food\r\nwould fail of digestion and prove injurious instead of beneficial.\r\n\r\nThe United States standard for milk is found in Appendix A.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Average Composition of Milk.=--Perhaps there is no food substance\r\nwhich has been subjected to so many and such severe analytical tests as\r\nmilk. Hundreds of thousands of analyses have been made in all civilized\r\ncountries, not only of the milk of the individual cow but of herds of\r\ngreater or less size.\r\n\r\nThere is a great variation in the composition of milk in different\r\nbreeds of cattle and also in different individuals of the same breed.\r\nFor instance, the Holstein breed of cattle affords a milk with a very\r\nlow content of fat, sometimes as low as 3.25 percent, and in individual\r\ncases lower. On the other hand the Jersey breed of cattle affords a\r\nmilk of a very high content of fat, sometimes reaching as high as 6\r\npercent, and in individual cases very much higher. The content of the\r\nnitrogenous element in milk is more stable than that of fat and the\r\ncommon content of casein in milk ranges from 2¹⁄₂ to 3¹⁄₄ percent.\r\nThe sugar in the milk is usually the complementary substance with the\r\nfat, diminishing in relative proportions as the fat increases and vice\r\nversa. The average content of sugar in cow’s milk is approximately\r\n4 percent. The content of mineral substances in milk is also quite\r\nconstant, being about 0.70. The ash contains the phosphoric acid which\r\nis one of the essential food components of milk. A milk of fair average\r\nquality contains 12 percent of solids and 88 percent of water. This\r\nis an expression for milk during the various seasons of the year and\r\nfrom all breeds and kinds of cows. The influence of season has much\r\nto do with the quantity of milk produced. It is always greater in the\r\nspring and summer months, when the cows are turned out to pasture and\r\nthe growth on which they feed is unusually succulent. The increase in\r\nvolume is not attended with a proportionate increase of solids, and\r\nthus the percentage of solids in spring and summer milk is less than\r\nthat in the winter milk unless the cows are particularly well fed\r\nduring the winter on a generous diet, including large quantities of\r\nroots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--COW STABLES, MAPLETOWN FARM, SUMNER,\r\nWASHINGTON.]\r\n\r\nThe character of the milk is greatly influenced by the environment\r\nin which the cow lives. The stable in which the cow is kept should\r\nbe clean, well ventilated, and protected against extreme changes in\r\ntemperature, thus being cooler in the summer than the hot air on the\r\noutside and much warmer in the winter. An excellent arrangement of the\r\nstables to secure cleanliness and good ventilation is shown in Fig. 13.\r\nCows should be supplied with an abundant quantity of pure water and\r\nshould not be allowed access to stagnant pools when pasturing in the\r\nsummer. Every animal giving milk should be examined from time to time\r\nby a competent veterinarian to determine, by the injection of serum or\r\notherwise, whether or not the animal is afflicted with tuberculosis.\r\nEvery animal infected with tuberculosis should be separated from the\r\nherd and destroyed. Tuberculosis is an infectious disease and may\r\nspread from a single cow to every one in the herd. It is still by some\r\nauthorities claimed that there is no authentic case of transmission\r\nof bovine tuberculosis to the human system. Other authorities hold\r\nthat such transmission is possible, even if it has not been proven in\r\na particular case. Since experts disagree on this point the same rule\r\nis applicable here as in other cases of the same kind, namely, where\r\nexperts disagree on a point relating to the public health the benefit\r\nof the doubt, if any, should be given to the public, and the advice\r\nof those experts followed which is the most radical respecting the\r\nprotection of health from infection of any kind. It would be difficult\r\nto prove, for example, in any case of tuberculosis in man that it had\r\nbeen contracted from the sputa of tuberculosed patients, yet because it\r\nis possible, in the opinion of many experts, that such infection and\r\ntransmission of disease can take place, it is the part of wisdom to\r\nguard against it.\r\n\r\nIt is, I think, a statement which will be accepted by all that it\r\nis possible in this country to secure and keep a sufficient number\r\nof healthy cows to give the milk supply of the nation. Therefore,\r\nit is the duty of the state, either by municipal, state, or federal\r\ninspection, to eliminate, as far as possible, and, if necessary, at the\r\nexpense of the state, every diseased animal from the dairy herd. The\r\nfarmer whose herd becomes infected through no fault of his can justly\r\nclaim a compensation for the destruction of his animals for the common\r\ngood. There is, perhaps, no more important point connected with the\r\nkeeping of sanitary conditions than the proper inspection of the dairy,\r\nnot only furnishing milk for family use, but especially for sale. It\r\nis the plain duty of every municipality and state to prohibit the\r\nsale of milk to its citizens from dairies which are not periodically\r\nand frequently subjected to the most rigid expert inspection. Such\r\ninspection would not only secure the health of the animals but tend\r\ndirectly toward the cleanliness of the dairy. Only by the exercise of\r\nunusual care is it possible to keep milk from becoming contaminated.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Preparation of Milk.=--Every part of the animal, especially the\r\nudders, should be kept scrupulously clean by proper currying and\r\nwashing. The milk should be collected in vessels with as small an\r\norifice as possible. As soon as drawn the milk should be strained and\r\nartificially cooled to a temperature of at least 50 degrees F., if not\r\nlower. A convenient apparatus for cooling the milk is shown in Fig.\r\n14. In this condition, without being exposed to infection and being\r\nprotected from every point by closed vessels, stoppered when necessary\r\nby sterilized cotton, the milk is conducted into sterilized bottles and\r\nagain stoppered with a sterilized cork of some description. The milk is\r\nkept cold until delivered to the consumer and by the consumer should\r\nbe kept cold until used. By following these precautions it is possible\r\nto deliver a pure, wholesome, unpasteurized milk in a condition which\r\nkeeps practically unchanged for even a longer period than twenty-four\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--APPARATUS FOR COOLING MILK.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Certified Milk.=--Dairies which are inspected either by operation\r\nof the law or, voluntarily, by a competent body of medical and\r\nscientific experts duly authorized to make such inspection furnish to\r\nthe market what is known as certified milk. Each bottle of this milk\r\nbears the stamp of certification and this stamp may be used from the\r\ntime of one inspection until a certain date specified on the stamp\r\nwhen the next inspection takes place. The duty of the inspectors is\r\nto see that diseased animals are at once removed from the dairy, that\r\nthe sanitary conditions of the stable are perfect, that the food is\r\nabundant and wholesome, that the milking process is conducted according\r\nto the principles above outlined, and that the proper precautions are\r\ntaken to prevent infection during the preparation of the milk for the\r\nmarket. The milk should be examined chemically and bacteriologically at\r\neach inspection, or oftener, to see that it is of a standard quality,\r\nboth in respect of the number and character of the organisms which\r\nit contains and of its chemical constituents. Certified milk is, of\r\ncourse, more expensive than non-certified, inasmuch as the dairy is\r\nnecessarily called upon to bear the expense of inspection. However, the\r\nsuperior quality of such milk and its certain freedom from infection\r\nmore than offsets the increased price, and makes certified milk the\r\nideal food of a milk character, not only in the family, but especially\r\nin the hospitals, orphan asylums and other public institutions. It\r\nseems quite certain that in the near future practically all the milk\r\nthat is sold upon the market of the country will be of a certified\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pasteurized Milk.=--When milk is heated to a temperature of about\r\n140 to 160 degrees the greater part of the living organisms contained\r\ntherein are destroyed. At the same time the temperature is not high\r\nenough to give to the milk that peculiar taste which it acquires when\r\nboiled. Such pasteurized milk, placed in sterilized bottles, stoppered\r\nwith sterilized stoppers and kept in a cool place, will keep many\r\ndays and even weeks without apparent deterioration. Physicians and\r\nhygienists are quite agreed that pasteurized milk is not so wholesome,\r\nespecially for children, as certified milk which has not been subjected\r\nto a heat sufficiently high to kill the organisms contained therein.\r\nThe natural ferments of the milk, namely, the enzymes which produce\r\nthe lactic fermentations, promote rather than interfere with the\r\ndigestion of the product. The killing of the beneficial organisms of\r\nthe milk is only justified when there is danger of pathological germs\r\nbeing present. Hence the pasteurization of milk must in this sense be\r\nregarded as a substitute for inspection and certification.\r\n\r\nThere may arise cases where pasteurizing even of certified milk may\r\nbe desirable, namely, when from necessity it must be kept for a\r\nconsiderable period before use, as on shipboard, and other places\r\ninaccessible to a daily supply of fresh milk. Pasteurizing is also\r\njustifiable in miscellaneous milk supplies, the origin of which is\r\nunknown. It is safer, by far in this case, to pasteurize than take the\r\nchance of consuming pathological germs.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pasteurizing of Milk.=--A convenient method of pasteurizing milk is\r\nrecommended by the Dairy Division of the Department of Agriculture,\r\nwhich is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n=Directions for the Pasteurization of Milk=.[20]--The pasteurization\r\nof milk for children, now quite extensively practiced in order to\r\ndestroy the injurious germs which it may contain, can be satisfactorily\r\naccomplished with very simple apparatus. The vessel containing the\r\nmilk, which may be the bottle from which it is to be used or any other\r\nsuitable vessel, is placed inside of a larger vessel of metal, which\r\ncontains water. If a bottle, it is plugged with absorbent cotton, if\r\nthis is at hand, or in its absence other clean cotton will answer. A\r\nsmall fruit jar loosely covered may be used instead of a bottle. The\r\nrequirements are simply that the interior vessel shall be raised about\r\nhalf an inch above the bottom of the other, and that the water shall\r\nreach nearly or quite as high as the milk. The apparatus is then\r\nheated on a range or stove until the water reaches a temperature of 155\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit, when it is removed from the heat and kept tightly\r\ncovered for half an hour. The milk is rapidly cooled without removing\r\nit from its containers and kept in a cool place. It may be used any\r\ntime within twenty-four hours. A temperature of 150 degrees maintained\r\nfor half an hour is sufficient to destroy any germs likely to be\r\npresent in the milk, in cold weather, or when it is known that the milk\r\nreaches the consumer soon after milking, and it is generally safe to\r\nadopt this limit. It is found in practice that raising the temperature\r\nto 155 degrees and then allowing the milk to stand in the heated water\r\nfor half an hour insures the proper temperature for the required time.\r\nIf the temperature is raised above 155 degrees the taste and quality of\r\nthe milk will be affected.\r\n\r\n  [20] By Dr. De Schweinitz.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the milk furnished to consumers in large cities in summer\r\ncontains at the time of delivery an immense number of miscellaneous\r\nbacteria, this procedure may not fully meet the requirements during\r\nhot weather, not only because such milk will not remain sweet for\r\ntwenty-four hours unless kept in a good refrigerator, but also because\r\nthe bacteria not destroyed by the heating may at times produce\r\ndigestive disturbances in the very young. Under such circumstances it\r\nis best to keep the bottles in the water until it boils or to use one\r\nof the many steamers now on the market. After the bottles have been\r\nkept at the boiling point for three to five minutes (or longer if they\r\nare large) they should be cooled as promptly as possible and kept in a\r\nrefrigerator until used.\r\n\r\nThe simplest plan is to take a tin pail and invert a perforated tin\r\npie-plate in the bottom, or have made for it a removable false bottom\r\nperforated with holes and having legs half an inch high to allow\r\ncirculation of the water. The milk-bottle is set on this false bottom,\r\nand sufficient water is put into the pail to reach the level of the\r\nsurface of the milk in the bottle. A hole may be punched in the cover\r\nof the pail, a cork inserted, and a chemical thermometer put through\r\nthe cork, so that the bulb dips into the water. The temperature can\r\nthus be watched without removing the cover. If preferred, an ordinary\r\ndairy thermometer[21] may be used and the temperature read from time to\r\ntime by removing the lid. This is very easily arranged, and is just as\r\nsatisfactory as the patented apparatus sold for the same purpose. Any\r\nother simple method of procedure will give the same result.\r\n\r\n  [21] Before using the dairy thermometer it is best to have it tested,\r\n  as it may be unreliable in the upper parts of the scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Average Content of Fat in American Milk._--From the thousands of\r\nanalyses of American milks that have been made it appears that the\r\naverage content of fat therein is about 3.90 percent. Of the different\r\nbreeds of cows the Holsteins produce milk with the least content of fat\r\nand the Jerseys with the greatest. It is not unusual to find in the\r\nmilk of a Jersey cow a content of 6 or 7 percent of fat.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Comparison of Cow’s Milk with Other Varieties.=--Human milk differs\r\nfrom milk chiefly in having a much lower content of casein and a higher\r\ncontent of milk sugar. Goat’s milk has a higher content of casein than\r\nmilk, somewhat higher content of fat, and slightly less sugar. Ewe’s\r\nmilk is very rich both in protein and fat. Mare’s has a low casein and\r\nfat content and is exceptionally rich in sugar. Ass’s milk has less\r\ncasein and protein than milk but more sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cream.=--When milk is allowed to stand for some hours in a cool place\r\nor when it is mechanically treated in a separator the fat particles,\r\nbeing of a less specific gravity, are separated, and when they reach a\r\ncertain degree of consistence they form a product known as cream. The\r\nquantity of fat in cream varies according to the method of separation.\r\nOn standing for a period of about twelve hours in a cool place the\r\nseparated cream may be removed by skimming and should contain at least\r\n18 percent of milk fat. Under the action of the separator, cream of\r\na much greater content of fat is usually produced, often reaching as\r\nmuch as 30 percent or more. The separation of cream mechanically in a\r\nseparator is preferable to the method of time separation by gravity\r\nalone. The cream secured by the separator is very much fresher, as it\r\ncan be removed as soon as the milk is drawn and cooled. Its content\r\nof butter fat can also be regulated to the desired amount and, in the\r\nthird place, a more complete separation is secured than by gravity.\r\nBy the proper manipulation of the separator almost all of the fat in\r\nmilk is readily removed. Cream should be kept under the same conditions\r\nas has been described for sanitary milk. When placed in sterilized\r\ncontainers, properly stoppered and kept cool, fresh cream will keep\r\nsweet as long as milk under similar circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn large dairy industries the separator is practically the only method\r\nnow employed for securing cream while for farm use the gravity method\r\nof standing in a cool place for twelve or twenty-four hours is the\r\ncommonly practiced method.\r\n\r\nCream is used on the table with fruit and cereal foods and especially\r\nin beverages such as tea and coffee. It is also prescribed by\r\nphysicians for certain diseases and derangement of the digestive organs\r\nwhere the nitrogen content of milk produces irritation and fails of\r\ndigestion. Cream is not a complete food in the sense that milk is\r\ninasmuch as the other constituents of milk are less in proportion as\r\nthe percentage of fat is increased, yet cream contains at least a\r\npart of all the food elements in milk, as, for example, nitrogenous\r\nconstituent, principally, casein, milk, sugar, and mineral matters.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered in this case that the fat is the variable\r\nelement and as that is increased the proportion of other ingredients,\r\nnecessarily, is diminished.\r\n\r\nThe most important use of cream is in the manufacture of butter.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Standards of Cream.=--The composition of cream varies with almost\r\nevery sample. The standards for cream vary in different states and\r\ncities. The national standard requires 18 percent of fat.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Skimmed Milk.=--The residue which is left from the removal of cream\r\nis known as skimmed milk. Skimmed milk contains the principle part\r\nof the nitrogenous constituents of milk, the greater quantity of its\r\nsugar and a very large quantity of its mineral matter. It is still a\r\nvery valuable food product, lacking only the element of fat. When eaten\r\nwith nuts or other oily food skimmed milk would complete the ration and\r\nmake a well balanced food. The chief prejudice against skimmed milk is\r\nthat it has been so often sold for whole milk. When sold and consumed\r\nunder its own name it is not a fraudulent body and is deserving of a\r\nhigher place in the dietary than has been ascribed to it. In the large\r\ncreameries of the country the skimmed milk is usually fed to animals.\r\nIt is one of the most highly esteemed foods for pigs and poultry, and\r\nis largely used for those purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Skimmed Milk._--Naturally the composition of skimmed\r\nmilk would be that of milk corrected for the abstraction of fat. It\r\ncontains some little fat when prepared by the gravity method and only a\r\nvery small portion when separated mechanically. The abstraction of the\r\nfat increases the relative proportions of sugar and casein.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Curd Test for Purity of Milk.=--The Wisconsin curd test is conducted\r\nas follows: 1. Sterilize milk containers so as to destroy all bacteria\r\nin vessels. This step is very important, and can be done by heating\r\ncans in boiling water or steam for not less than one-half hour.\r\n\r\n2. Place about one pint of milk in covered jar and heat to about 98\r\ndegrees F. (Figs. 15 and 16).\r\n\r\n3. Add ten drops of standard rennet extract and mix thoroughly with the\r\nmilk to quickly coagulate.\r\n\r\n4. After coagulation, cut curd fine with case knife to facilitate\r\nseparation of whey; leave curd in whey one-half hour to an hour; then\r\ndrain off whey at frequent intervals until curd is well matted.\r\n\r\n5. Incubate curd mass at 98 to 102 degrees F. by immersing jar in warm\r\nwater. Keep jars covered to retain odors.\r\n\r\n6. After 6 to 9 hours incubation, open jar and observe odor; examine\r\ncurds by cutting the same with sharp knife and observe texture as to\r\npresence of pin holes or gas holes. Observe odor.\r\n\r\n7. Very bad milks will betray presence of gas-producing bacteria by the\r\nspongy texture of the curd and will have an off flavor.\r\n\r\n8. If more than one sample is tested at the same time, dip knife and\r\nthermometer in hot water before each time used.\r\n\r\n“Normal milk contains practically no organisms but the straight lactic\r\nacid bacteria. These germs produce no gas and no bad odors, but purely\r\nlactic acid and the curd formed therefrom is such as is represented in\r\nFig. 17.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--IMPROVISED WISCONSIN CURD TEST.\r\n\r\nC, Can used to hold sample; P, pipette for measuring rennet; K, knife\r\nfor breaking curd.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--A, MILK; B, BROKEN CURD IN WHEY; C, MATTED\r\nCURD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--CURD FROM A GOOD MILK. LARGE, IRREGULAR HOLES\r\nMECHANICAL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--CURD FROM A TAINTED MILK. LARGE, IRREGULAR\r\nHOLES MECHANICAL; SMALL PINHOLES DUE TO GAS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--CURD FROM FOUL MILK.]\r\n\r\n“Milk contaminated by the introduction of dust, dirt, fecal matter,\r\nor kept in imperfectly cleaned cans becomes fouled with gas-producing\r\nbacteria that break down the milk sugar and so produce gases and\r\nusually undesirable odors.... Therefore milks showing the presence of\r\ngas or bad odors in any considerable degree are milks that have been\r\nmore or less polluted with extraneous organisms or carelessly handled,\r\nand as a consequence such milks show a type of curd revealed in Figs.\r\n17, 18, and 19.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Whey.=--The residue left from milk in the process of the making of\r\ncheese is known as whey. Whey consists of that portion of milk which\r\nis not precipitated by the rennet and which separates when the casein\r\nof milk is coagulated and sets in the process of cheese making. The\r\nwhey contains the principal portion of the water in milk, the most of\r\nthe milk sugar therein, and small quantities of butter and soluble\r\nnitrogenous portions (albumin) and solid particles which remain\r\nsuspended in the solution. It may, therefore, be properly considered\r\nas milk from which the greater part of the nitrogenous portions and\r\nfat particles has been separated. The value of whey as a food product\r\nconsists chiefly in the milk sugar which it contains. It is not\r\nvery largely used for human food but is valued as a food for young\r\ndomesticated animals, especially pigs and poultry.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Composition of Whey.=--The whey resulting from the manufacture of\r\ncheese contains nearly all the foods of the whole milk with the\r\nexception of the casein and fat. It is composed of from 6 to 8 percent\r\nof solids consisting chiefly of milk sugar, some albumin, a little fat,\r\nand about 0.6 percent of mineral matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Koumiss.=--Koumiss originated in Asia Minor in the production of a\r\nfermented drink from mare’s milk, which is richer in milk sugar than\r\nthe lactic secretions of most other mammals. By the fermentation of\r\nthe milk sugar mare’s milk is converted into a fermented beverage\r\ncontaining a small percentage of alcohol. In this country koumiss is\r\nmade almost exclusively from cow’s milk and by special fermentation at\r\na low temperature. It is a beverage valued especially by convalescents\r\nand invalids and frequently is capable of nourishing the body in\r\ndiseases which affect the digestive organs when other foods fail of\r\nassimilation. It is also a cooling and delicious beverage for those in\r\nhealth when properly prepared and stored.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Modified Koumiss or Kephir._--Koumiss made from cow’s milk with the\r\nprevious addition of milk or cane sugar to increase the alcoholic\r\ncontent cannot be regarded as a natural product but rather one to which\r\nthe term “modified” may be applied. The greater part of koumiss made in\r\nthe United States from cow’s milk is of this modified variety. Cow’s\r\nmilk contains on an average about 4 or 5 percent of sugar and does not\r\nyield a fermented beverage of a sufficient alcoholic content without\r\nreducing the actual sugar content of the beverage below the point of\r\npalatability. Cane sugar is usually employed as the modifying agent.\r\nWhile modified koumiss cannot be regarded as of equal value with the\r\nnatural article made from mare’s milk it is a palatable and wholesome\r\nbeverage when produced and stored under proper conditions. The quantity\r\nof alcohol produced in any case is not very great and the change in\r\ncomposition which renders koumiss so easily assimilable in many cases\r\ncannot be due alone to the alcohol formed but to the fermentative\r\nchanges produced by enzymic action which takes place in the other\r\nconstituents of koumiss, especially casein during the process of\r\nfermentation.\r\n\r\nKoumiss or kephir, which is the name applied to koumiss made from cow’s\r\nmilk, is also prepared with the addition of honey, in the place of\r\nsugar, and small quantities of wheat flour, not exceeding 20 parts to\r\n1500 parts of other constituents. Koumiss is sometimes artificially\r\nfortified by the addition of small quantities of alcohol, but this\r\npractice must be regarded as extremely reprehensible. The alcohol of\r\nkoumiss is incident to its fermentation and should not be increased\r\nbeyond the normal amount. One of the important points in the making of\r\nkoumiss is the control of the temperature which, during fermentation,\r\nought not to rise above 50 degrees in order to get the best results.\r\nKoumiss may be made in the bottle in which it is kept, in fact, it is\r\nbest made so, and its fermentation then resembles that of champagne.\r\nDuring the process of fermentation the bottle should be shaken at least\r\nonce a day in order that the part which coagulates cannot be unevenly\r\ndistributed throughout the mass. The bottle should be strong enough\r\nto resist the pressure produced by the carbon dioxid which is formed\r\nand the cork should be securely tied in. As in the case of champagne\r\nit is best to place the bottle with the cork down. Before using,\r\nthe bottle containing the koumiss should be well shaken in order to\r\nthoroughly mix the contents which form a creamy, foamy mass extremely\r\npalatable, highly nutritious, and valuable not only as a beverage but\r\nin many cases of disease and disordered digestion as a food. In fact\r\nthe value of koumiss for medicinal purposes, that is for medicinal\r\nfood, is not thoroughly appreciated by the medical profession. This\r\nmay be due to the fact that the art of making koumiss is not generally\r\nknown, and while the general principles upon which its manufacture is\r\nbased have been set forth it requires an expert to make a palatable\r\nand useful article (“British Dairy Farming” by Jas. Long). It is\r\nworthy of suggestion now that the use of horses for draft purposes has\r\npractically been superseded by the automobile and the trolley that the\r\nproduction of real koumiss from mare’s milk might become a very useful\r\nfield of industry in the United States. It is perfectly certain that\r\nthe genuine article must possess properties which are not wholly found\r\nin the imitations of koumiss which are so common in this country. It\r\nis well understood by physicians that a natural product produced from\r\nnatural material is always superior in character both as a food and\r\nmedicine to the synthetic or artificial product. Whenever, therefore,\r\na fermented beverage produced from natural sources is contaminated\r\nby artificial products the resulting compound is not so useful nor\r\ndigestible. For instance, wine which is made partially from sugar and\r\nbeer made partially from dextrose, although they may be healthful and\r\nwholesome beverages, are inferior in quality and character to the real\r\nproduct made from grape juice or barley malt.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Buttermilk.=--The residue left in the churn in the manufacture of\r\nbutter is termed buttermilk. There are two distinct varieties of\r\nbuttermilk, namely, that resulting from the churning of unsoured cream\r\nand that remaining from the churning of soured and ripened cream.\r\nThe first kind of buttermilk does not differ in its characteristic\r\nessentials from skimmed milk and therefore is not considered here.\r\nThe second class of buttermilk is far more common and is a beverage\r\nof pleasing acid taste. When made from properly ripened cream it is\r\nwholesome and delicious, especially in summer time. Its composition\r\nis that of cream subjected to enzymic action during the ripening\r\nprocess by which an agreeable degree of acidity is produced due to\r\nlactic acid, together with the incidental changes which take place in\r\nthe composition of other parts of the liquid due to enzymic action.\r\nButtermilk also usually contains small particles of butter itself\r\nwhich escape aggregation during the final process of churning. In well\r\nprepared buttermilk, however, these particles of butter are not very\r\nnumerous and they add nothing to the palatability, although they do add\r\nsomething to the nutritive properties of the beverage. The buttermilk\r\nrepresents that portion of milk which is one of the chief constituents\r\nof cream as far as bulk is concerned, freed practically from its butter\r\nfat. It does not differ greatly, therefore, in its chemical properties\r\nfrom skimmed milk, although there is a slight difference in the\r\nrelative percentages of the milk solids in cream as compared with the\r\nsame constituents in whole milk. The composition of buttermilk is shown\r\nin the following table:\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF BUTTERMILK.\r\n\r\n               FROM SWEET   FROM SOUR\r\n                 CREAM.      CREAM.\r\n                _Percent._  _Percent._\r\n  Water,         89.74        90.93\r\n  Fat,            1.21         0.31\r\n  Milk sugar,     4.98         4.58\r\n  Protein,        3.28         3.37\r\n  Ash,            0.79         0.81\r\n  Acidity,         ...         0.80\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bonnyclabber.=--Bonnyclabber is a term applied to milk which\r\nhas become soured by lactic fermentation, producing a gelatinous\r\ncoagulation of casein which is sufficiently firm at times to prevent\r\nthe liquid from being poured. Clabber may be regarded as a natural\r\ncheese curd except that the fat is chiefly on top. It is a beverage\r\nor food of a very agreeable taste to most persons and is often eaten\r\nwith sugar. In the summer it is often formed during hot murky\r\nweather, especially of that character which produces thunder storms.\r\nFor this reason it is a common supposition that thunder or lightning\r\nsours milk. The thunder and lightning, however, have nothing to do\r\nwith this process. The condition of the atmosphere which produces an\r\nenvironment favorable to electrical disturbances of this kind also\r\nfavors in the highest degree the growth of the organisms which produce\r\nthe lactic ferments. Hence thunder storms and the rapid souring of milk\r\nare frequently coincident leading to the popular impression as above\r\nmentioned. Inasmuch as the souring of milk usually takes place after\r\nthe cream has risen the composition of clabber is practically that of\r\nskimmed milk modified by the lactic fermentation which has taken place.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTER.\r\n\r\nWhen cream, especially cream in which incipient lactic fermentation\r\nhas been set up, is subjected to agitation in a churn under proper\r\nconditions of temperature the particles of butter therein contained\r\nare collected into masses so that the butter can be separated from\r\nthe residual liquid. This process is technically called churning. The\r\ndomestic churn in its simplest form is perhaps well known to almost\r\neveryone, especially those who have lived in the country. In the\r\ndomestic manufacture of butter the cream is collected and set aside\r\nuntil sour, that is, until lactic fermentation has set up. When this is\r\nsufficiently advanced the cream is placed in a churn, the simplest form\r\nof which is a wooden, cylindrical vessel of appropriate size, being\r\nmuch longer than its horizontal diameter. The churn is provided with\r\na dasher, namely a perforated wooden disk with a handle which passes\r\nthrough a hole in the cover. When the churn is charged the butter is\r\nproduced by agitation with the dasher. In winter time warm water is\r\nadded to the mixture in order to raise the temperature to the proper\r\ngathering point of butter, namely 65 to 70 degrees F. For the same\r\nreason cold water is added in the summer time. The art of the dairy\r\nmaid is shown in the proper regulation of the temperature to secure the\r\nbest results. When the cream is properly ripened and the temperature is\r\nsuitable the gathering of butter will be accomplished in from twelve to\r\nthirty minutes. In unfavorable conditions the duration of churning may\r\nbe for a much longer period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--POWER CHURN READY FOR USE.--(_Courtesy of the\r\nBureau of Animal Industry._)]\r\n\r\nIn dairies and large establishments churning is accomplished by\r\nmachinery with very different mechanical appliances, but the principle\r\nwhich underlies the process is the same as those outlined above. The\r\naccompanying figures illustrate the process of churning by mechanical\r\nmeans in a modern dairy (Figs. 20 and 21).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--POWER CHURN, OPEN.--(_Courtesy of the Bureau\r\nof Animal Industry._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Treatment of Butter.=--The crude butter secured by churning is\r\nsubjected to washing and seasoning processes in order to prepare it\r\nfor the market. The washing or working of butter is accomplished by\r\nmeans of water. The object of this “working” is to separate from the\r\ncrude butter as much of the curd and other non-fatty constituents of\r\nthe cream as can be conveniently accomplished. The removal of these\r\nmechanical particles not only makes a butter of a higher grade but\r\nalso one of better keeping qualities. The working of butter also has\r\nmuch to do with its grain or texture, which is one of the characters\r\nof butter to which great attention must be paid. The best grade of\r\nbutter and that which brings the highest price in the market is that\r\nwhich receives no treatment other than that of the washing and working\r\nprocess to which attention has been called. This kind of butter is\r\nknown as natural or unsalted or uncolored butter, that is, a fresh,\r\nsweet product of an agreeable aroma, palatable, of fine texture and\r\ngrain, and is the best product of its kind for human consumption. It\r\nalso brings the highest price on the market and, by reason of its\r\nmethod of preparation, the consumer can usually be assured that it is\r\nfresh in character.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Salting Butter.=--In the United States, especially, consumers of\r\nbutter generally require that it shall be salted. For this purpose\r\nfine grades of dairy salt are used as free as possible from impurities\r\nand consisting of fine particles or crystals which rapidly dissolve in\r\nthe residual moisture of butter. This promotes a uniform distribution\r\nof the salt in the form of brine throughout the mass of butter.\r\nThe existence in butter of undissolved particles of salt is highly\r\nprejudicial to its taste and character. The quantity of salt used in\r\nbutter is determined by the taste of the consumer. The more salt the\r\nbutter contains the less value it is as butter and hence the quantity\r\nshould be limited to the smallest possible amount demanded by the\r\nconsumer’s taste. Often butters are found in commerce which are so full\r\nof salt as to be wholly unpalatable and there is a tendency on the part\r\nof the greedy manufacturer to add excessive quantities of salt because\r\nit is very much cheaper than the butter itself and thus he hopes to add\r\nto the profit of the industry. On the contrary this practice usually\r\nresults in loss, since such highly salted butter naturally brings the\r\nlowest price. The amount of salt which is used in butter should not\r\nexceed two percent.\r\n\r\nIt is a common supposition that salt in butter is a preservative. This\r\nis true when used in large quantities, that is, in quantities which\r\nrender the butter somewhat unpalatable. The very small quantity of salt\r\nused purely for condimental purposes cannot be regarded as aiding in\r\nany material way the preservation of the product.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Coloring Butter.=--Unfortunately the practice of artificially coloring\r\nbutter is very prevalent in the United States. Practically all the\r\nbutter found upon the market, even in the spring and summer, is more or\r\nless artificially colored, often with coal tar (anilin) dyes which, to\r\nsay the least harm of them possible, are open to suspicion in respect\r\nof wholesomeness. The practice of coloring butter produced in winter\r\nmay be regarded as universal, though none the less reprehensible on\r\nthat account. The object of coloring butter is, undoubtedly, to make\r\nit appear in the eyes of the consumer better than it really is, and\r\nto this extent can only be regarded as an attempt to deceive. If cows\r\nare properly fed during the winter months with wholesome, nutritious\r\nfood to which a small proportion of roots such as carrots or ruta bagas\r\nare added or with yellow maize and clover hay, even in winter time the\r\nbutter produced will have an attractive light amber tint which appeals\r\nstrongly to the æsthetic sense of the consumer. The natural tint of\r\nbutter is as much more attractive than the artificial as any natural\r\ncolor is superior to the artificial. There is the same difference\r\nbetween the natural tint of butter and the artificial as there is\r\nbetween the natural rose of the cheek and its painted substitute. It\r\nis claimed, and perhaps justly, that the use of certain vegetable\r\ncolors, such as annotto, does not introduce any unwholesome substance\r\ninto the product. Admitting this, we must next ask whether it deceives\r\nthe consumer. If so, it is difficult to understand upon what ethical\r\nprincipal any plea for the artificial coloring of butter can rest.\r\nIf it is admitted that there is no valid reason why butter should be\r\ncolored other than the artificial coloring of foods in general, which\r\nis a practice so reprehensible that it is almost universally denounced,\r\nits practice cannot be easily defended. The dairymen of our country\r\nare honest and honorable and evidently do not clearly see the false\r\nposition in which the practice of coloring butter puts them. When the\r\ndairymen of our country understand that the naturally colored products\r\nwill bring the highest price on the market and appeal more strongly to\r\nthe confidence of the consumer it is believed the artificial coloring\r\nin butter will be relegated to the scrap pile of useless processes. It\r\ncannot be claimed in any sense that coloring of butter artificially\r\never adds anything to its value as a nutritive substance.\r\n\r\nOne of the claims for justifying the coloring of butter is that it\r\ndistinguishes it from oleomargarine. This, however, is not the case\r\nsince, under the law, oleomargarine may be colored upon the payment of\r\na tax of ten cents per pound. The consumer has at his disposition a\r\ncomplete protection against fraud in the use of oleomargarine by the\r\noperation of state and federal laws, irrespective of the tint of the\r\nproduct. Oleomargarine and butter are distinguished from each other by\r\ntheir natural colors and also by their chemical and physical properties\r\nand, therefore, there can be no justification for the coloring of\r\nbutter on the plea that it distinguishes it from oleomargarine. Thus,\r\nfrom every point of view it is evident that the artificial coloring of\r\nbutter is undesirable. It interferes with the right of the consumer,\r\nwho should know the exact character of the product he buys, and it\r\nstands in the way of the prosperity of the manufacturer by keeping upon\r\nthe market a cheaper product which tends to decrease the price even of\r\nthat of better quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Standard Butter.=--According to the standard established by Congress\r\nbutter must contain more than 16 percent water and not less than 82.5\r\nbutter fat.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Renovated Butter.=--The law of Congress which controls the manufacture\r\nof renovated butter is executed jointly by the Treasury and\r\nAgricultural Departments. The quantity of renovated butter produced\r\nduring the year ending June 30, 1905, was 60,290,421 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Adulterated Butter.=--The quantity of adulterated butter which was\r\nproduced under the authority of the Act regulating the manufacture\r\nof oleomargarine and butter and on which is laid a tax of 10 cents\r\nper pound during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1905, was 3,671\r\npounds. These data show that the tax of 10 cents per pound laid upon\r\nadulterated butter has practically destroyed the manufacture of\r\nthat article. Normal butter has from 12 to 14 percent of water. It\r\nis sometimes rechurned with water to raise the water content to 16\r\npercent. Such a practice results in adulteration whether the content of\r\nwater exceeds 16 percent or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Influence of Food upon Butter.=--The character of butter is very\r\neasily affected by the nature of the food consumed by the cow. Butter\r\nhas the faculty of absorbing very readily odors of all kinds. Foods,\r\ntherefore, which have characteristic odors impart them to the butter. A\r\nmost striking instance of this is in the eating of wild garlic. In this\r\ncase both the milk and the butter are affected to such a degree as to\r\nbe in many cases unpalatable. Hence foods or substances in foods which\r\nare aromatic or odoriferous are likely to impart their peculiar odor to\r\nthe milk, cream, and butter. Of all the constituents of milk the fat\r\nappears to have the highest faculty of absorbing these objectionable\r\nodors. Therefore, the feeding of distillery slops is also apt to impart\r\nan unpleasant odor to milk and butter, whereas if these slops be dried\r\nand their volatile aromatic principle expelled little discomfort is\r\nexperienced in their use. The physical characteristics of butter are\r\nalso changed in a marked degree by the character of the food. Butter\r\nfat, as has already been indicated, is distinguished from other animal\r\nfats by its content of soluble and volatile acids of which butyric is\r\nthe chief. There are certain kinds of foods which decrease or tend to\r\ndecrease the content of butyric acid in butter.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Influence on Melting Point.=--The character of the food also has a\r\nmarked influence upon the melting point of butter. The author showed\r\nmany years ago that the use of cottonseed meal as food for cows tends\r\nto raise the melting point of butter. This was regarded as an index\r\nof some value for the southern portion of the country, where a high\r\ntemperature obtains over a period of six or seven months of the year.\r\nIf the melting point of butter, which when normal is about 33 degrees\r\nC. (91° F.), could be increased to 35 or 36 degrees C. (95° F.), it\r\nwould be of immense advantage in these warm climates and, in fact,\r\nin all parts of the country during the months of July, August, and\r\nSeptember. There is no apparent tendency to increase the melting point\r\nof butter by feeding other oil cakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Transmission of Other Principles in the Food to the\r\nButter.=--Experience has shown that when cows are fed cottonseed meal\r\nor its products the quality of cottonseed oil which responds to the\r\ncolor test known as the Halphen test, namely, the production of a red\r\ncolor with carbon disulfid and amyl alcohol, is transmitted also to\r\nthe butter. In some cases this reaction is extremely faint while in\r\nothers it is displayed with an intensity which is claimed by some to be\r\nequal to that of the admixture of 5 percent of cottonseed oil with the\r\nbutter. The use of cottonseed meal, on the contrary, does not seem to\r\nnotably affect either the content of volatile acid in the butter nor\r\nits refractometer reading. (Experimental Station Record, Volume 25,\r\nPage 716.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOLEOMARGARINE.\r\n\r\nOleomargarine is the name applied to any fatty substance which is\r\nprepared to be used in the same manner as butter. Oleomargarine is\r\ndefined by Act of Congress as follows:\r\n\r\nAn Act defining butter, also imposing a tax upon and regulating the\r\nmanufacture, sale, importation, and exportation of oleomargarine.\r\n(Approved August 2, 1886.)\r\n\r\n“That for the purposes of this act certain manufactured substances,\r\ncertain extracts, and certain mixtures and compounds, including such\r\nmixtures and compounds with butter, shall be known and designated\r\nas “oleomargarine,” namely: All substances heretofore known as\r\noleomargarine, oleo, oleomargarine oil, butterine, lardine, suine,\r\nand neutral; all mixtures and compounds of oleomargarine, oleo,\r\noleomargarine oil, butterine, lardine, suine, and neutral; all lard\r\nextracts and tallow extracts; and all mixtures and compounds of tallow,\r\nbeef fat, suet, lard, lard oil, vegetable oil, annotto, and other\r\ncoloring matter, intestinal fat, and offal fat made in imitation or\r\nsemblance of butter, or, when so made, calculated or intended to be\r\nsold as butter or for butter.”\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of oleomargarine can only take place in the United\r\nStates under the supervision of officials of the Internal Revenue.\r\nAll oleomargarine which is artificially colored a yellow or yellowish\r\ntint in semblance of natural butter pays an internal revenue tax of\r\n10 cents per pound. Oleomargarine uncolored pays a revenue tax of\r\none-fourth cent per pound. Oleomargarine when made under proper\r\nsanitary conditions from sanitary raw materials is a wholesome and\r\nnutritious article of diet and usually can be sold at a smaller price\r\nthan butter. It is especially a food product which commends itself to\r\nthose who are under the necessity of practising strict economy in the\r\ncost of food in the family. The principal objection, and in fact the\r\nonly valid objection, to its use is found in the frauds which have\r\nbeen committed in its manufacture and sale. There has been a constant\r\ndisposition on the part of dishonest manufacturers and dealers, since\r\nthe time when oleomargarine became a commercial commodity, to sell\r\nit as butter. Although the penalties of national and state laws are\r\nvery severe in this respect the practice is continued. The opportunity\r\nfor gain is so great that the cupidity of the manufacturer overcomes\r\nhis fear of punishment and disgrace. With a more rigid national and\r\nstate inspection, it is reasonable to hope that this fraudulent use of\r\noleomargarine can be avoided and the pure, unadulterated article under\r\nits own name be supplied to those who prefer it either on account of\r\nits properties or its price.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Materials Used in the Manufacture of Oleomargarine.=--_Neutral\r\nLard._--One of the principal basic components of oleomargarine is\r\nneutral lard or lard stearin, the properties of which have already\r\nbeen described. Beef fat stearin is another basic ingredient of\r\noleomargarine and is the stearin derived from tallow or tallow itself.\r\nBeef fat has a higher melting point than lard and beef fat stearin a\r\nstill higher melting point than the tallow. Hence it forms an ideal\r\ningredient with which to mix the oily components which enter so largely\r\ninto the manufacture of oleomargarine. The beef fat or beef fat stearin\r\nis easily distinguished by means of the microscope. It forms beautiful\r\nradiated fan-like crystals, the characteristic appearance of which is\r\nshown in Fig. 9, page 67.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cottonseed Oil and Cottonseed Oil Stearin._--These are also\r\nimportant ingredients of oleomargarine affording the oily or more\r\nliquid constituents which, when mixed with the lard and stearin above\r\nmentioned, form a compound the melting point of which is slightly above\r\nthat of butter and sufficient to maintain it in an unmelted state even\r\nin warm weather. The quantities in which these different ingredients\r\nare used vary greatly in different manufacturing establishments and\r\ndepend largely upon the location where the oleomargarine is to be used.\r\nWhen manufactured for tropical or subtropical regions larger quantities\r\nof stearin are employed than when used in temperate zones or for winter\r\nconsumption, in which case larger quantities of cottonseed oil and\r\ncottonseed oil stearin are employed with the mixture. After the fats\r\nare mixed it is usually the practice to churn them with milk in order\r\nto give a flavor of butter to the product. In some cases the yolk of\r\neggs is mixed with oleomargarine, as it is claimed that they impart\r\nthereto a firmer and more homogeneous structure which renders the mass\r\nbetter, especially for cooking purposes. All the ingredients which are\r\nused in the manufacture of oleomargarine are made known and recorded\r\nin the books of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and thus it is a\r\nproduct which it may be said is strictly under government supervision.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Description of Process of Manufacture.=--The fat is taken from the\r\ncattle in the process of slaughtering, and after thorough washing is\r\nplaced in a bath of clean, cold water, and surrounded with ice, where\r\nit is allowed to remain until all animal heat has been removed. It is\r\nthen cut into small pieces by machinery and cooked at a temperature of\r\nabout 150 degrees until the fat, in liquid form, has separated from\r\nthe fibrine or tissue, then settled until it is perfectly clear. Then\r\nit is drawn into graining vats and allowed to stand a day, when it is\r\nready for the presses. The pressing extracts the stearin, leaving the\r\nremaining product, which is commercially known as oleo oil, which, when\r\nchurned with cream or milk or both and with or without a proportion of\r\ncreamery butter, the whole being properly salted, gives the well-known\r\nfood-product, oleomargarine.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Adulteration of Oleomargarine.=--Since the coloring of oleomargarine\r\nis permitted upon the payment of a tax, oleomargarine which is\r\ncolored cannot be said to be adulterated when the tax has been paid,\r\nalthough if coloring were not a legalized operation it would be an\r\nadulteration. Yellow oleomargarine is an imitation of natural butter\r\nand its manufacture should be prohibited unless the product is marked\r\n“imitation.” The character of the coloring materials used is not\r\nprescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue but as a rule the\r\ncoal tar dyes are preferred in the coloring of oleomargarine to the\r\nvegetable coloring matter such as annotto and saffron. The remarks\r\nwhich have been made in connection with the use of poisonous materials\r\nin other products apply to oleomargarine.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration with Egg Yolks._--An adulteration which has been\r\npracticed in this country is the admixture of preserved egg yolks.\r\nUsually these yolks are secured in China, broken, and placed in\r\nvessels and preserved with borax or boric acid or salt. These eggs are\r\ngenerally collected during the early spring and summer months and are\r\nnot sent to the United States until the fall or winter. The importation\r\nof such articles is now prohibited under the food laws of the country\r\nso that the adulterations with the imported article is no longer to be\r\nfeared. It is possible to preserve domestic eggs in the same way, and\r\nthe use of them in this manner is regarded as an adulteration, since\r\nsuch preserved egg products cannot be regarded as suitable for human\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration with Preservatives._--Fortunately preservatives are not\r\nused to any extent in the manufacture of oleomargarine when intended\r\nfor domestic use. The most suitable preservative in such a case as\r\nthis would be borax or boric acid. It is not believed that these\r\npreservatives are used to any extent when the product is intended for\r\ndomestic consumption. Whether or not preservatives are used in the\r\nproduct sent abroad I am unable to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Production of Oleomargarine.=--According to the report of the\r\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue the quantity of oleomargarine taxed\r\nat 10 cents a pound produced in the United States for the fiscal year\r\nending June 30, 1905, was 5,584,684 pounds, and for 1906, 4,888,968\r\npounds. The quantity produced in 1906 taxed at one-fourth cent a pound\r\nwas 50,545,914 pounds.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF OLEOMARGARINE.\r\n\r\n                               SOL.

The components used in the\r\nmanufacture of oleomargarine, when properly made, are all wholesome\r\nand digestible materials such as are consumed in eating various food\r\nproducts. It does not appear, therefore, that any valid objection\r\ncan be made against the use of oleomargarine from a physiological or\r\nhygienic standpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEESE.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Historical.=--The preparation of cheese is one of the oldest of the\r\ntechnical processes. It appears that it was known during the time of\r\nKing David, at least a thousand years before Christ, and the Greeks\r\nwere acquainted with it before the writings of Homer. Aristotoles and\r\nHypocrates describe the curdling of milk which at that time appears\r\nto have been accomplished by the use of the juice of the fig. The\r\nuse of cheese was very common in Rome in the earlier historical days\r\nbut the most of it was imported from the North. Cæsar speaks of the\r\npreparation of cheese among the German tribes. Cheese must, therefore,\r\nbe regarded as one of the very oldest forms of prepared food used\r\nby man. It probably is almost, if not quite, as old as wine. These\r\nhistorical facts are interesting in showing how from the earliest times\r\nman has made use of the natural ferments to prepare food from the raw\r\nmaterial. Attention must be called in this connection to the fact that\r\nmany people claim that such foods as these are not natural foods but\r\nwholly artificial. The fallacy of such a claim is not difficult to\r\nshow. An artificial food is one which is prepared out of materials\r\nwhich, themselves, are not edible food products or, at least, are not\r\ndigestible or of a character which does not naturally occur by ordinary\r\nprocesses. Artificial foods, therefore, are purely synthetic, that\r\nis, made up from the elemental substances, or they are mixtures or\r\ncompounds. On the contrary a food like cheese or wine is not a mixture\r\nor compound but a natural product from materials which themselves are\r\nfood products. Milk is the raw material of cheese as the must of the\r\ngrape is of wine. Both milk and must are rich and nutritious foods. The\r\nchanges which each undergoes are in many respects the same. The must of\r\nwine undergoes an alcoholic fermentation and the milk sugar of cheese\r\nis subjected to a lactic fermentation and its casein to a proteolytic\r\nchange which materially alters its character.\r\n\r\nCheese products are a very important part of food materials of the\r\ndairy. The term cheese is applied to the solid product produced from\r\nmilk by coagulation of the casein with rennet or lactic acid and\r\nsubjecting the solid product thus produced to a process of fermentation\r\nand ripening by the addition of appropriate seed material, seasoning,\r\nand storage at convenient temperature for varying periods of time.\r\nIn the precipitation of the casein of milk the fat particles become\r\nmechanically entangled and form a part of the precipitate. There is\r\na certain quantity of other milk constituents incorporated in the\r\nform of water, milk sugar, and mineral matter in the precipitated\r\nmass. The greater part of the other bodies which the milk contains,\r\nconsisting of the milk sugar and a considerable portion of the soluble\r\nmineral matter, are separated in the form of whey. The composition of\r\nfresh cheese is that of that part of the milk which is precipitated\r\nand which is entangled mechanically in the precipitated matter. The\r\nripened cheese is changed in its chemical constituents mostly as the\r\nresult of fermentative action upon its nitrogenous constituents, that\r\nis, the casein, albumin, etc., contained therein. The ferments tend to\r\nchange the casein into a more soluble form of protein, while at the\r\nsame time they develop a flavor and aroma in a way agreeable to the\r\nnostril and palate. Various forms of moulds and other organisms grow on\r\nand in cheeses which influence their palatability and character. The\r\nfinal product of the ripened cheese varies not only with the nature\r\nof the original material as determined by the milk itself but with\r\nthe character of the preparation and the nature of the organisms and\r\nferments which are active during the ripening period, and also with the\r\ntime and temperature of storage.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Kinds of Cheese.=--It is not necessary and perhaps it would be\r\nimpossible to attempt an enumeration of all the various kinds of cheese\r\nwhich are offered on the market. The first classification of cheese\r\ndepends upon the character of the milk used. The term “cheese” in this\r\ncountry naturally refers to a product made from cow’s milk since that\r\nis the principal milk used in the United States for cheese making.\r\nThe term is used in this manual in that sense and when there is no\r\nqualifying word employed it is always understood that the product in\r\nquestion is made from the cow’s milk. This implies that the milk is at\r\nleast a standard milk, that is, a whole milk, unskimmed and containing\r\nnot less than 3.25 percent of butter fat. According to the definition\r\nfixed by the Congress of the United States the term cheese is applied\r\nnot only to this product but also to one containing a larger percentage\r\nof fat than this. The term cheese applies both to cheese made from milk\r\nand cheese made partially from milk and partially from cream. The term\r\n“full cream cheese” is also often used in the trade but is likely to\r\nbe misleading and deceptive. The real significance of the term full\r\ncream cheese is that it is made of whole milk or milk unskimmed which\r\ncontains its full complement of cream. The term “cream cheese” is also\r\noften used to indicate a cheese made partially of milk and cream. It is\r\nevident that the term cream cheese in this sense is misleading, since\r\nit can be properly applied only to a cheese made from cream alone.\r\nSuch cheeses are made but, inasmuch as cream must have not less than\r\n18 percent of fat in order to be called cream according to the United\r\nStates standard, the cheeses made from such a source are too oily and\r\nfatty for ordinary consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cheese Made from Goat’s Milk.=--Goat’s milk is also frequently used\r\nin making cheese. It is extensively employed in France and Switzerland\r\nfor cheese making and also in other parts of Europe, and to a limited\r\nextent in this country. Some of the varieties of cheese which are most\r\nhighly prized are made from goat’s milk, such as Roquefort.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Adulteration and Misbranding of Cheese.=--The most common form of\r\nadulteration or sophistication of cheese is the misbranding thereof in\r\nrespect of the country where made or in respect of character. This is\r\na form of deception which has long been established in the trade and\r\none which cannot be condoned or excused. There are certain varieties of\r\ncheese whose names should be respected and in fact, in the case of all\r\nvarieties that have an established character and reputation, their name\r\nshould not be applied to other articles made in imitation thereof. In\r\nthis country there is a national law which prohibits the marking of a\r\nfood or dairy product falsely as to the state or territory where made.\r\nFor instance, a cheese made in Ohio cannot be marked New York cheese\r\nand peaches grown in Delaware cannot be marked California peaches,\r\nmaple sirup made in Indiana cannot be labeled Vermont maple sirup, etc.\r\nThe ethical principle underlying this law is one which will meet the\r\napprobation of every well meaning man and therefore the extending of\r\nthis principle to other forms of misbranding is an easy step. If it is\r\na violation of the law to mark a cheese made in Ohio as made in New\r\nYork it is certainly a violation of the ethical principle underlying\r\nthat law to name a cheese made in Connecticut Cammerbert. Unhappily,\r\nhowever, there are cheeses made in the United States to which foreign\r\nnames are given, the universal excuse being that they are cheeses of\r\nthe same type. In many cases this excuse is not a valid one and in\r\nno case is it an accepted one. To name a cheese made from cow’s milk\r\nthe same as that made from ewe’s milk is a distinct misbranding in\r\nevery sense of the term. There should be no difficulty in established\r\nvarieties of cheese made in this country having names which are not\r\ndeceptive and not intended to mislead the consumer as to the state,\r\nterritory, or country where made. In one sense all cheese may be said\r\nto be of the same type, but because the taste and odor of a cheese\r\nmade in the United States imitates to some extent that of a cheese\r\nmade in France is no excuse for giving the French name to the American\r\nproduct. A further illustration of this principle is found in the\r\nfollowing: The term Roquefort, for instance, is not properly applied to\r\nany cheese product except that which is made at or in the vicinity of\r\nRoquefort. In no other part of France can cheese be made bearing the\r\nname of Roquefort. The use of the term Roquefort, therefore, in any\r\nway upon American cheese is a misbranding and an attempt to deceive\r\nwhich usually is successful. There is not so great an objection to the\r\nterm Swiss cheese as to Roquefort, but there is the same kind of an\r\nobjection. The cheese which bears the name of Schweitzer-Käse is very\r\nextensively manufactured in Germany and sold under that name. A similar\r\ncheese is also extensively made in this country and sold under the name\r\nof Schweitzer-Käse. In this case there is no particular location or\r\nplace which originated the name and has the sole right to use the name\r\nSwiss cheese. It is the name of a whole country and not of a location,\r\nand yet it is evident that Swiss cheese properly can only be made in\r\nSwitzerland and not in Germany or in the United States. Any hard, tough\r\ncheese in which a large number of holes is found and which on cutting\r\nmakes a flexible, semi-leathery slice has to a certain extent the\r\nappearance and perhaps the taste and flavor of genuine Swiss cheese.\r\n\r\nIt should not be difficult to find a market for all good cheese made in\r\nthis country, under appropriate American names indicating their origin.\r\nIf the term Swiss cheese is at all allowable on a package it should be\r\nplaced as a minor part of the label and with the statement that it is\r\nof that type. Even this transgression is perhaps difficult of excuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Artificial Coloring.=--Next to misbranding and misnaming of cheeses,\r\nperhaps the most common adulteration is that of artificial coloring.\r\nThe public taste has been led in the matter of cheeses, especially\r\nof American origin, to look for a deep yellow color. This is also\r\nassociated with the idea of the use of a large quantity of rich,\r\nnaturally yellow-colored cream. The addition of an artificial color to\r\na cheese never adds anything to its value, and to the really æsthetic\r\neye detracts much from its appearance. The presence of this rich\r\nartificial tint is calculated in many instances to excite a suspicion\r\nin regard to the character of the cheese and thus interferes with its\r\nproper gustation. There is another more serious objection than the one\r\njust mentioned, namely, that it is possible from skimmed milk to make\r\na highly colored cheese which would appear to the consumer to be made\r\nof whole milk or of milk and cream, and thus a deliberate deception\r\nis perpetrated. The consumer of cheese should demand that artificial\r\ncoloring of all kinds be omitted from cheese products.\r\n\r\nMoreover, these colors may of themselves be deleterious in character\r\nand there is no restriction, so far as I know, at this time in the\r\nUnited States to prevent a manufacturer, if he so desires or through\r\nhis ignorance of the use of coloring materials of a poisonous\r\ncharacter, from using any amount.[22] The coal tar dyes are cheaper and\r\nproduce faster and more natural looking tints than the vegetable colors\r\nsuch as annotto and saffron, and hence, unless they are prohibited\r\nby law, they are almost universally employed. All of these dyes in\r\na concentrated form are highly poisonous and injurious and several\r\ninstances are on record of death, especially in the case of young\r\nchildren, from eating concentrated colors. The fact that a poison of\r\nthis kind is diluted by the cheese is no excuse for its use. The only\r\nprotection which the consumer has, which is reliable in all cases, is\r\nthe prohibition of coloring matter in cheese.\r\n\r\n  [22] Written before the passage of the food-bill.\r\n\r\nBy Act of Congress of June 6, 1896, coloring matter is permitted to be\r\nused in cheese in the United States and doubtless it will continue to\r\nbe used under this authority until that portion of the Act is repealed\r\nor until the consumer demands an uncolored article. The pure, natural\r\ncolor of the cheese is universally acknowledged to be best, most\r\npalatable, and most desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Preservatives.=--Fortunately there is little to be said in regard to\r\npreservatives in cheese because they are almost unknown. The addition\r\nof a preservative to a cheese at the time of its production would so\r\nseriously interfere with the ripening process as to defeat the purpose\r\nof storage altogether. Hence in so far as preservatives are concerned\r\nthere is little danger of adulteration.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Impure Raw Materials.=--If cheese be made of standard milk as provided\r\nfor by the commissioners it must be made of pure, wholesome material.\r\nOn the contrary, inasmuch as there is no official inspection of cheese\r\nfactories, it is entirely possible through carelessness, ignorance,\r\nor design to use in the making of cheese milk which may itself be\r\ninfected. Cheese made from such milk of course would carry the\r\ninfection of the milk. This is a sort of adulteration which can only be\r\nexcluded by careful sanitary inspection of cheese factories.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Filled Cheese.=--Formerly there was a very considerable adulteration\r\nof cheese by manufacturing it from skimmed milk and supplying from an\r\nartificial source the necessary fat. Cottonseed oil, lard, and other\r\nedible oils are used for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Filled Cheese_ (Circular No. 11, Bureau of Animal\r\nIndustry).--Neutral lard is the principal fat which is substituted for\r\nmilk fat in filled cheese. It is used to the extent of two or three\r\npounds for every 100 pounds of skimmed milk. The principal objection\r\nto a filled cheese is not on account of its containing lard, which in\r\nitself is not unwholesome. But lard is an entirely different fat from\r\nmilk fat, and differs in the character of the fermentation which takes\r\nplace. The characteristic flavors and odors which are contributed\r\nby the milk fat in the cheese are entirely wanting, and the cheese\r\nis devoid of aroma and flavor and is nothing more than a mixture of\r\ncasein with lard. Filled cheese is such a poor imitation of the genuine\r\narticle that it can never have any very great vogue, and especially\r\nunder the present law which requires it to be labeled and the payment\r\nof a tax. The law relating to filled cheese is found in the appendix.\r\n\r\nA filled cheese which is on the market not properly stamped and duty\r\npaid in harmony with this Act of Congress is adulterated, and they who\r\nmake and sell it are amenable to the law. The annual report of the\r\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue for the year ending June 30, 1905,\r\nshows that no receipts were obtained by the tax on filled cheese during\r\nthat year. If any was made it was made surreptitiously and in defiance\r\nof the law.\r\n\r\nFrom the above data it is seen that the manufacture and sale of filled\r\ncheese in the United States is almost a thing of the past and this form\r\nof adulteration, assuming that the law is thoroughly executed, is not\r\nnow likely to be often met with.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cottage Cheese.=--Cottage cheese is a term applied to a product\r\nwhich is usually only a raw material of cheese. It is the fresh,\r\nprecipitated, and unripe milk product, above described as used\r\nin cheese making. It is a highly nutritious and very palatable\r\nproduct, usually prepared at home and not suitable for keeping or\r\ntransportation. It is often made from sour milk in which the casein is\r\ncoagulated by the natural development of lactic acid. The sour milk is\r\nplaced in a cloth bag and the whey allowed to escape by gravitation.\r\nThe final portion of the whey may be forced out by pressure. The\r\nresidue, when properly seasoned with salt or in any way to suit the\r\ntaste of the consumer, is very palatable. Cream is often added to this\r\nresidue which increases the normal amount of fat which it contains.\r\n\r\nCOMPARATIVE COMPOSITION OF AMERICAN AND EDAM CHEESE.\r\n\r\nThe chemical composition of some of the principal varieties of cheese\r\nare shown in the following table:\r\n\r\n                     WATER.     ASH.      FAT.    PROTEIN.\r\n                    Percent.  Percent.  Percent.  Percent.\r\n\r\n  American cheese,   27.5       4.1      32.5      28.38\r\n  Edam cheese,       36.34      4.24     31.17     22.28\r\n\r\nThe data show that cheese is essentially a nitrogenous and fat food,\r\ncontaining only small quantities of carbohydrates, and therefore it is\r\nnot a complete ration. It is a ration, however, which is complementary\r\nto a highly starchy diet such as rice or maize bread or potatoes.\r\nBread and cheese or potatoes and cheese or rice and cheese, therefore,\r\nmake a well balanced diet, highly nutritious, easily digestible, and\r\nquite palatable.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Manufacture of American Cheeses.=--The large cheeses which are\r\nprincipally found upon the American market may be said, in general, to\r\nresemble the Cheddar type, although the calling of these cheeses by the\r\nname “Cheddar” is misleading, and to that extent a misbranding of the\r\nproduct.\r\n\r\nThere are two common methods of making these cheeses which are in\r\nvogue in the United States, namely, the “stirred curd” or “granular”\r\nmethod and, second, the Cheddar method. (Bulletin 104, Department\r\nof Agriculture of Pennsylvania, 1902.) The latter one is the more\r\nextensively used. The second product does not differ essentially in\r\ncharacter from the first, though the latter method, it is claimed,\r\ngives a more solid cheese and one of more uniform character and\r\nwith a slightly less content of moisture. Since the Cheddar method\r\nhas practically come into sole use, displacing the first method,\r\na description of the Cheddar method alone will be sufficient to\r\nillustrate the method of making large cheeses which are now so common\r\non the American market and which have such a well merited reputation.\r\nThe process is divided into eight parts: First, coagulating the milk;\r\nsecond, cutting the curd; third, heating the curd; fourth, removing the\r\nwhey; fifth, cheddaring the curd; sixth, milling the curd; seventh,\r\nsalting and pressing the curd; eighth, curing the cheese.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rennet._--As has been said in the description of cheese making, the\r\nmaterial which is most useful in the precipitation of the curd is\r\nrennet. The rennet is the secretion of the stomach of various animals,\r\nthat of the calf being most highly priced for cheese making. The fourth\r\nstomach of the animal is the one which is used in the manufacture of\r\nrennet. The aqueous extract made from these stomachs contains a ferment\r\nwhich has the property of coagulating casein in a very high degree.\r\nOne part of good rennet preparation from healthy stomachs of calves\r\nwill coagulate 1000 parts of milk. In former days rennet was freshly\r\nmade and used at the factories. At the present time it is largely\r\nprepared on a commercial scale and sold to the cheese maker. It is\r\nhighly important that the rennet used in cheese making should be of\r\nthe best quality, as an inferior grade gives a bad taste and color\r\nto the cheese. Just as in the manufacture of fermented beverages and\r\nmaking of bread the character of the yeast is a dominant factor in the\r\nnature of the finished product, so it is even to a greater degree in\r\nthe case of rennet. Those who purchase the rennet already made should\r\ntherefore be certain it is of a quality to give the desired character\r\nto the cheese. The greater the amount of milk fat in milk the larger\r\nthe proportion of rennet, since the milk fat protects to some extent\r\nthe casein from the action of the ferment. Experience has shown also\r\nthat during the summer the rennet acts more readily upon the milk,\r\nprobably due to the higher temperature. Care should be taken to avoid\r\nthe use of any excess of rennet, since anything more than the amount\r\nnecessary to conduct the coagulation is apt to add an unpleasant flavor\r\nto the cheese. The curd also in such cases is less cohesive and makes a\r\ntougher and drier product which does not lend itself so readily to the\r\nripening process. For this reason the rennet which is to be used should\r\nalways be tested in small quantities of milk beforehand in order that\r\nthe proper proportion to be used may be known so that the process in a\r\nlarge way may be conducted with certainty and not by guess. (“British\r\nDairy Farming,” by Jas. Long.)\r\n\r\nRennet is sometimes treated with borax to preserve it during transit.\r\nIn such cases the borax may not all be removed by the whey and is\r\nconsequently found in ripened cheese. Its introduction in this way\r\nshould be avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coagulating the Milk by Rennet Extract._--This process is often\r\ntermed by the cheese makers “setting the milk with rennet.” The milk\r\nwhich is used for the purpose of cheese making should be, in the\r\ntechnical language of the cheese maker, “ripe,” that is, containing a\r\nsufficient quantity of lactic acid. The principal method of producing\r\nthe proper amount of lactic acid in milk is by keeping it warm, namely,\r\nat a temperature of about 84 degrees. At this temperature the most\r\nfavorable conditions exist in milk for the rapid growth of the lactic\r\nacid ferments. If the natural ferments which produce lactic acid are\r\nnot in sufficient quantity in the original milk it is better, rather\r\nthan to wait too long a time, to start the development of the lactic\r\nacid by adding an artificial ferment. Lactic ferments are specially\r\nprepared for this purpose, or some previously ripened milk may be added\r\nto the mass. This is called a “starter.” From two to five pounds of\r\n“starter” are usually required for each one hundred pounds of milk.\r\nThe degree of ripening is ascertained by measuring the quantity of\r\nlactic acid present. The proper condition of the milk is tested by\r\nmeans of a rennet preparation and if the milk will coagulate, when\r\nthus tested, in about one minute or a little more it is an indication\r\nthat a sufficient amount of acid has been developed to add the rennet\r\nfor the proper coagulation of the milk. It is important to have the\r\nmilk in just the right condition in order that the proper operations\r\nin cheese making may go on uniformly. Care must be taken, however, not\r\nto have too much lactic acid in the milk. For instance, 0.2 of one\r\npercent is too great, and such a milk is very liable to give trouble in\r\nsubsequent operations. In the curding of milk by rennet the temperature\r\nshould be kept between 82 and 86 degrees. The amount of rennet extract,\r\nof course, varies with its character and strength, and this is best\r\ndetermined by the cheese maker’s experimenting in order that the proper\r\nquantity to be added to the great mass of milk may be known beforehand.\r\nA sufficient quantity of rennet extract should be used to curdle the\r\nmilk in fifteen or twenty minutes for a quick-curing cheese, and in\r\nthirty to forty minutes for a slow-curing cheese. The rennet extracts\r\nin common use are added at the rate of from one-half to five ounces\r\nfor 1000 pounds of milk. Before adding, the extract should be diluted\r\nwith from 20 to 40 times its volume of water at a temperature of from\r\n85 to 90 degrees. The rennet thus diluted acts with uniformity on the\r\nmilk, preventing the production of curd of a lumpy character. Previous\r\nto adding the rennet extract the mass of milk is thoroughly stirred in\r\norder to mix the fat therewith and the dilute rennet added evenly and\r\nslowly with constant stirring which is continued for several minutes.\r\nA gentle stirring of the surface of the milk should be continued\r\nuntil the curd is at least half formed, in order that the fat may not\r\nseparate. After the stirring is finished, a cloth is placed over the\r\ntop of the vat to keep the surface of the milk from cooling, and the\r\nmilk is then left undisturbed until the coagulation is complete. The\r\ncoagulation goes on gradually until the whole mass of milk is one solid\r\ncoagulum produced by the changing of casein into paracasein.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cutting the Curd._--In order that the whey may be separated it is\r\nnecessary that the curd be cut into pieces. The smaller the pieces of\r\ncurd, the more rapidly will the whey escape. As soon as the curd is\r\nformed it shows a tendency to contract and this tends to force out\r\nthe whey. By cutting the extent of the surface from which the whey\r\ncan exude is amplified and the rapidity of the process is enormously\r\nincreased. The time at which the curd is to be cut is one of great\r\nimportance and is determined by the skill and experience of the cheese\r\nmaker. If the curd is cut when it is too soft there may be large loss\r\nof fat and a decreased yield of cheese. If the curd is too hard the\r\nwhey is more difficultly removed and the quality of the cheeses is not\r\nso fine. The following test is used to determine when the curd is in\r\nthe right condition to cut. The end of the index finger is inserted\r\nobliquely into the curd half an inch or more and then slowly raised\r\ntoward the surface. If the curd breaks apart with a clean fracture\r\nwithout leaving any particles on the finger and the whey which exudes\r\nfrom the broken surface is clear and not milky it shows the proper time\r\nhas come for cutting. Specially devised knives are used for cutting the\r\ncurd, which leave it in small cubes of about one-half inch surface.\r\nSkill in the use of the cutting knife is important and can only be\r\nacquired by proper experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Heating the Curd._--As soon as the curd is cut the whey begins to\r\ngo out of it and the curd settles to the bottom of the vat, the whey\r\nbeing of a higher specific gravity than the curd. After the pieces of\r\ncurd sink to the bottom the surface easily reunites and, when broken\r\napart, additional fat is lost. As soon, therefore, as the curd is cut\r\nthe whole mass is kept in gentle motion by hand stirring or with a wire\r\nbasket designed for the purpose, care being taken to avoid breaking or\r\ncomminuting the cubes. When properly stirred the whey appears clear and\r\nis free of small particles of curd.\r\n\r\nThe curd contracts and hardens during this process, and soon reaches\r\na condition when the surface does not adhere so readily. The vat\r\nshould be kept warm during the process of separation of the whey, the\r\ntemperature being raised to about 90 degrees and finally, toward the\r\nlast, to 98 degrees, about blood heat.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Separating the Curd._--The precipitated curd is left in contact with\r\nthe whey for some time, and during this period some of the lactic\r\nacid in the whey unites with the paracasein. The setting of the curd\r\nis finished when a small mass which has been squeezed in the hand to\r\nremove the whey is pressed against a bar of iron heated to little short\r\nof redness, and it is found that there is left, adhering to the iron,\r\nfine silky threads. These threads are formed by the compound of lactic\r\nacid and paracasein, and the more of this compound there is the longer\r\nwill the strings be. When the curd shows by the hot iron test strings\r\none-eighth inch long it is an index that the time has arrived for the\r\nseparation of the curd from the whey.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gathering the Curd._--After the whey is removed the cubes of curd\r\nare left in the bottom of the vat until they mat or pack together, a\r\nprocess which is technically known as cheddaring. The curd is sometimes\r\nremoved from the vat and placed on a special apparatus for this purpose\r\ncalled a curd-sink. When the curd has matted together, forming a solid\r\nmass, it is cut into blocks 8 × 8 × 12 inches. These blocks are turned\r\nin the vat in order to facilitate the removal of more whey. The blocks\r\nof curd are carefully placed, one over the other until they form a\r\nlarge mass.\r\n\r\nThe process of solidifying or cheddaring accomplishes two purposes:\r\n\r\nFirst, the whey is expelled to a considerable extent and, second,\r\nthe lactic acid unites with more of the curd, changing not only its\r\nchemical composition but also its physical state from a spongy, tough,\r\nrubber-like consistence, with a high water content, to a mass having a\r\nsmooth, velvety appearance and feeling, and a soft, somewhat plastic\r\nconsistency.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Milling the Curd._--This process consists in cutting the lumps of curd\r\ninto small pieces in order to introduce the salt and to handle it more\r\nreadily when it is to be placed into hoops for pressing. This process\r\nis done by special mills which avoid, in so far as possible, the loss\r\nof fat.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Salting and Pressing._--Salt is added for several purposes, chiefly\r\nfor flavoring, but it also has other uses. It aids in removing the\r\nwhey,--it hardens the curd and it checks or retards the formation of\r\nlactic acid. Excessive salting, however, is injurious. From 2¹⁄₂ to 3\r\npounds of salt should be added to the curd made from 1000 pounds of\r\nmilk. Before putting in the press the curd is cooled to a temperature\r\nof about 80 degrees, and after putting into the mold it is subjected to\r\npressure to give it a proper form, rather than to remove the whey which\r\nis practically all gone by this time. If the whey has not been properly\r\nremoved before the cheese goes into the press it is almost impossible\r\nto get it out then. The pressure should be uniform and continued for\r\nat least twenty-four hours. If a screw is used the pressure should be\r\nlight at first and gradually increased. After the cheese has been in\r\nthe press about an hour it is removed, turned, a cloth adjusted about\r\nit, and the entire surface wiped carefully with a cloth wrung out of\r\nhot water.\r\n\r\nThe sizes in which American cheeses are made depends largely upon\r\nthe market, the more common size being 15 inches in diameter, and\r\nthe cheese weighs from 60 to 65 pounds. There is also a very large\r\nmanufacture of cheese seven inches in diameter, known as “Young\r\nAmericas” and weighing only from 8 to 10 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Curing._--The higher the temperature to which cheese is exposed in\r\ncuring the more rapid the curing process will take place, but the\r\npoorer the quality of the cheese. Experience has shown that a low\r\ntemperature, 55 degrees F. or even less, gives much better results,\r\nalthough it requires a greater length of time. If cured at a higher\r\ntemperature the fat is apt to exude, and will not be evenly distributed\r\nin the cheese. It is, therefore, more profitable, as well as better for\r\nthe consumer, to cure at low temperatures, producing a superior quality\r\nwith less loss of moisture and a cheese which sells for a better price.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Moisture in the Curing Cellar._--The cellar in which the curing\r\ntakes place should contain air with a proper degree of moisture. The\r\nrelative percentage of moisture in the air as compared with the total\r\namount which it can hold should be from 65 to 75. This is determined by\r\nplacing in the curing room a hygrometer which registers the degree of\r\nsaturation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Qualities of American Cheese.=--The quality of cheeses is judged\r\nby (1) flavor, (2) body, (3) texture, (4) color, and (5) general\r\nappearance. In regard to flavor it is impossible to describe what is\r\nmeant. Only the connoisseur can determine properly whether a cheese\r\nhas a flavor which is sound, healthy, and indicative of the highest\r\nquality. The cheese flavor should be free from any admixture of other\r\nflavors. Cheese resembles butter in this respect, that it absorbs and\r\nthen gives off foreign flavors with great facility. Therefore in the\r\nwhole process of cheese making care must be exercised to exclude every\r\nodor or flavor of an undesirable character from the cheese house.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Flavor._--Under flavor also may be described taste, which should be of\r\nthat biting, incisive character due to proper development of ripening\r\nand its attendant bacterial and enzymic products. The various foreign\r\nflavors in cheese may be due to the odor of cows or the stable or may\r\nsuggest “rotten eggs,” or it may be the flavor of rancid butter due to\r\nthe decomposition of butter fat in the cheese.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Body._--This is also a term which it is difficult to define. An\r\nAmerican cheese is said to have a perfect body when it is solid, firm,\r\nand smooth in substance. This quality is ascertained by pressing the\r\ncheese between the fingers. When it does not press down evenly between\r\nthe finger and thumb it is said technically to be “corky.” It is\r\nsmooth when it feels velvety-like and is not harsh or gritty.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Texture._--The term texture applied to American cheese refers mainly\r\nto its compactness. It is nearly related to body. The texture may be\r\nfine and close or porous. The texture is perfect when a cut surface\r\nof the inside of the cheese presents to the eye a solid, compact,\r\ncontinuous appearance, free from breaks, holes, or lumps. Cheese should\r\nnot show any visible or separated moisture or fat. The texture of\r\nAmerican cheese should be smooth, free from breaks, and fairly hard.\r\nThe bandage should be smooth and neat, extending over the edge on each\r\nend of the cheese about two inches.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Color._--A true and unadulterated cheese should have only the color\r\nof the milk from which it is made, and any other color incident to\r\nripening which is usually green. Unfortunately cheeses of American\r\norigin are often artificially colored. An over-deep yellowish or\r\nreddish tint, therefore, should be regarded as a mark of inferiority.\r\nArtificially colored cheese should not rank as high on the market as\r\nthat of a natural tint, which is much more pleasing to the eye and\r\nmuch less objectionable to the æsthetic taste. Color is often added to\r\nconceal inferiority in the milk used.\r\n\r\nThe sides of the cheese should be straight and of uniform height all\r\naround.\r\n\r\nThe following scale of points is used in judging cheese, according to\r\nthe above qualities: Flavor, 45 to 50; texture, 30 to 35; color, 10 to\r\n15; general appearance, 5 to 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cream Cheese.=--This is a soft cheese which is rapidly growing in\r\npopularity. It is made from rich milk or milk and cream mixed together.\r\nIt resembles in general Neufchatel, but it is richer in butter fat and\r\nis put up in a different form. The temperature of the room in which\r\nthe cheese is made is quite important. It should be kept as nearly as\r\npossible at 75 degrees. The milk is first warmed to 70 degrees and run\r\nthrough a separator by means of which the cream is taken out, together\r\nwith one-half the volume of milk. This makes either dilute cream or\r\nvery rich milk, as you may choose to call it. The cream is heated to\r\n84 degrees and about four or five ounces of rennet extract added per\r\nthousand pounds. The rennet is carefully and gradually stirred into\r\nthe mixture, using about fifteen minutes for the addition. The mass is\r\nthen allowed to remain at rest until whey is seen around the sides.\r\nThe whey is then removed by draining, the resulting curd pressed and\r\nmixed with about 3 percent of salt. The cheese is not subjected to a\r\ncuring process. It is molded into flat, thin cakes about 3 by 4 inches,\r\nwrapped in parchment paper, and in this condition packed for shipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Manufacture of Foreign Types of Cheese in the United States.=--The\r\nimprovement of cheeses made in the United States by securing different\r\nforms of ferments and utilizing the best method of setting, pressing\r\nthe curd, and ripening used in other countries is worthy of all\r\nencouragement. Unfortunately a disposition has arisen in our country\r\nof giving the names of foreign varieties to the domestic articles.\r\nMany fancy domestic cheeses are sold under strictly foreign names\r\nsuch as Cheddar, Stilton, Cheshire, Schweitzer, Limburger, Camembert,\r\nBrie, Roquefort, etc. In fact there seems to be no limitation upon\r\nthe adoption of a name already identified with a distinct type and\r\nlocality. Such a tendency is greatly to be regretted and perhaps it is\r\nonly necessary to point out to our people the ethical offense which\r\nthey are committing by such practices to secure their discontinuance.\r\nIt is, however, a perfectly legitimate undertaking to import the\r\nferments which produce the famous cheeses of the world and utilize them\r\nto the fullest extent in cheeses of American origin. This, however,\r\nshould be done in such a way as to carefully avoid applying the name of\r\nthe original article to the domestic product. Perhaps it would be no\r\nethical offense or no very great offense to place upon the labels of\r\nthe cheese products a statement that they are of the same type as the\r\nforeign product they imitate. This, however, should be an explanatory\r\nphrase and not a part of the label which attracts principal attention.\r\nIt is far better that a manufacturer should adopt some local name which\r\nwould become identified with his product, and thus become a valuable\r\ntrade-mark. The attempt to pass domestic cheese under foreign names is\r\nan offense against good ethics and also against the law. It is nothing\r\nmore nor less than misbranding, and cannot be justified even in the\r\nabsence of a law forbidding it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Success with Foreign Ferments._--Considerable success has attended\r\nthe introduction of the foreign processes into the United States,\r\ntogether with the ferments which produce the cheeses abroad. The\r\nenvironment, however, cannot be imported and therefore the ferments\r\nmay rapidly assimilate different properties under changed conditions,\r\nand the continued importation of fresh ferments may be necessary to\r\npreserve the type of cheese. Some of the principal types of foreign\r\ncheeses made in the United States are those which are mentioned above.\r\nA particularly excellent study has been made of the process of making a\r\nCamembert type of cheese in this country. (Bureau of Animal Industry,\r\nBulletin 71, 1905.) This particular cheese is a type of Camembert which\r\nis made at the Storrs Agricultural Experiment Station of Connecticut.\r\nFor these experiments a cheese maker familiar with the Camembert\r\nmanufacture in France was secured. The method of making the cheese and\r\nalso of separating the curd and ripening was as nearly as possible like\r\nthat used in France. The style of the packages was the same, so that\r\nfrom external appearances it would be quite difficult to distinguish\r\nthem from the genuine Camembert cheese of France. The success attending\r\nthese experiments shows that it is possible to improve domestic\r\ncheeses by scientific effort in the direction of using the proper\r\nferments. These soft cheeses made in Connecticut were of good quality\r\nand had something of the flavor and type of the Camembert itself,\r\nthough it was not difficult for even a novice to distinguish the two\r\nvarieties from one another.\r\n\r\nThese studies above referred to have resulted in a marked degree of\r\nprogress in the knowledge of the real changes which take place in\r\nthe ripening of cheeses. The officials in charge of the work differ\r\nsomewhat with the author in respect to the character of the product,\r\nclaiming that the making of Camembert cheese is not dependent upon\r\nuniform conditions obtained only in certain localities but rather\r\non securing the proper cultures and conditions which are possible\r\nalmost anywhere. The fact of the case is that the cheeses made at\r\nthe Connecticut station are probably made under much more scientific\r\nconditions and much more rigid control than the real Camembert cheese\r\nmade in France. The success which attended these efforts is only a\r\nproof of the statement made above that the introduction of these\r\nprocesses for making fancy cheeses in this country will doubtless\r\nresult in the development of types of American origin of peculiar\r\nflavor and quality. Such cheeses when properly named and not confused\r\nwith those of foreign origin will become quite as familiar and well\r\nknown, both at home and abroad. (Bureau of Animal Industry, Bulletin\r\n82, 1906.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sage Cheese.=--The consumption of the variety of cheese known as sage\r\ncheese is not very large at the present time in the United States and\r\nis restricted to certain localities, yet it is rapidly growing in\r\nfavor. Consumers who are accustomed to it are willing to pay a larger\r\nprice for it than for ordinary cheese. Sage cheese is made exactly in\r\nthe same manner as that described for the manufacture of Cheddar. The\r\nflavor of sage is imparted in three different ways, first, by adding\r\nthe sage extract or tea to the milk; second, by adding the extract to\r\nthe curd before salting; third, by adding the sage leaves to the curd\r\nbefore salting. The latter method is found to be the most satisfactory\r\nrequiring the least amount of sage to give any definite flavor. Three\r\nounces of sage leaves are found to be sufficient to flavor the curd\r\nfrom 1000 pounds of milk. The stems and impurities of the sage leaves\r\nare carefully removed and the leaves ground to a fine powder before\r\nmixing with the curd (Michigan Board of Agriculture, 1904).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Principal Cheeses of England.=--The principal English cheeses are\r\nStilton, Cheshire, Cheddar, double and single, Gloucester, Derby, and\r\nLeicester. According to Dr. Voelcker, the finest flavored cheese is\r\nCheshire, which differs from any other in being made from milk which\r\nis perfectly sweet, and some authors think its peculiar aroma is due\r\nto this fact. On the contrary, the more general opinion is that the\r\nbest cheeses are made from milk slightly sour rather than that which is\r\nperfectly sweet.\r\n\r\nCheshire cheese is manufactured by mixing the evening milk, which is\r\nkept cool over night, with the morning milk, and then warming the\r\nmixture until the temperature is about 90 degrees. The proper quantity\r\nof rennet is added and when the cheese is to be extremely yellow also\r\nsome annotto. After thoroughly mixing, the mass is left for nearly an\r\nhour, by which time the coagulation is completed. The next operation\r\nis the breaking down or cutting up of the fresh curd, and this is an\r\nimportant process. Upon the care which is exercised in doing this\r\ndepends in a large measure the richness and quality of the finished\r\nproduct. When properly manipulated the whey which is separated will be\r\nof a greenish color and clear, while the proper combination of milk\r\nfat and casein which is secured in separating the whey will make a\r\ncheese of first class quality. The curd is so dense as to naturally\r\nseparate from the whey by deposition, and the latter is thus drawn off\r\nby a stopcock properly placed in the vat. The curd is then placed upon\r\na cloth stretched over lattice work in order that the separation of\r\nthe whey may be complete. Finally before passing to the cheese house\r\nthe curd is treated with eight ounces of salt to twenty pounds of\r\ncurd. After the cheese is molded it is placed in a warm room for one\r\nor two days, and then taken to the press house where it is subjected\r\nto the usual pressure. The pressing process is continued by wrapping\r\nthe cheese in dry cloths and subjecting to new pressure every day for\r\nfive or six days. The cheese is then removed to the ripening cellar\r\nwhere it is turned two or three times a week. It is ripe and ready for\r\nconsumption in less than one year. There are a great many variations\r\nfrom this method of making Cheshire cheese, but they all follow the\r\nsame general plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Manufacture of Cheddar Cheese._--The cheese is made in various parts\r\nof England though chiefly in Somerset, the period of manufacture\r\nextending from April to November. Cheddar cheeses are made in\r\nlarge sizes varying from 60 to 100 pounds each. The temperature\r\nof precipitation for Cheddar cheese is somewhat less than for the\r\nCheshire cheese, being about 80 degrees. Rennet is used solely in the\r\ncoagulation, lactic acid not being liked for that purpose. In the\r\nmaking of Cheddar often some of the fat escapes in the whey and this is\r\nafterwards collected and made into butter. Two pounds of salt to 100\r\npounds of curd are used.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Derby cheese_ is a name applied to cheese made in Derby. The Cheddar\r\nsystem of making it is usually employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gloster cheeses_ are made on the same plan as that of the Derby and do\r\nnot need any further description.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Leicester cheese_ is a variety of cheese which is very popular and\r\nmade chiefly in the county of Leicester. The coagulation of Leicester\r\ncheese is made at a little lower temperature than that previously\r\ndescribed, varying from 76 to 84 degrees. The curd is allowed to stand\r\nfor about one-half hour before it is broken up and the whey separated.\r\nThe best manufacturers of cheese disapprove of the use of artificial\r\ncoloring and it may be said that eventually it is pretty certain that\r\nall cheese makers will come to the same conclusion. The use of coloring\r\nmatter in cheese, even of annotto, adds nothing to its richness, and\r\ntends to deceive the customer into thinking that the milk employed was\r\nricher in cream than it really was. The Leicester cheeses are small in\r\nsize compared with Cheddar. About eleven pounds of milk are used to\r\nmake an ordinary cheese.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stilton cheese_ is probably the most familiar and highly prized of\r\nall English varieties. It is not always to be obtained, and many\r\nimitations of Stilton are made and bear its name. The name it bears is\r\nfrom the name of the town where it was first, and is now, made. It is\r\na cheese which has been known for about a century and a quarter. It is\r\nprincipally made between March and September and solely from the milk\r\nof cows fed on natural pasture, that is, for the finest variety. The\r\nuse of artificial food for the cows is at once detected in a change for\r\nthe worse in the character of the cheese. At first the rennet employed\r\nwas made from the stomachs of lambs instead of cows and in the olden\r\ntimes the cheeses were not considered to be sufficiently mellow and\r\nripe until they were two years old and exhibited spots of green in the\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nThe most approved modern process of manufacture is mixing the morning\r\nand evening milk and bringing it to a temperature of 79 degrees. Rennet\r\nis then added and the mass allowed to stand for about an hour and a\r\nhalf. The curd is removed into cloths set in frames for the purpose\r\nof allowing the whey to separate. Usually about an hour is allowed\r\nfor the natural separation. The cloths are then tightened and brought\r\ncloser together to produce slight pressure and placed in a cheese tub,\r\nseveral of them together, where they are allowed to remain for twelve\r\nhours. Usually a longer time is allowed before the curd is cut up. The\r\nsalt is added in proportion of one pound to 60 pounds of fresh curd.\r\nThe curd is then placed in tin cylinders with perforated sides, the\r\ncylinder being 12 inches deep and 12 inches in diameter, and put in\r\na room at about 65 degrees to favor the separation of the whey which\r\nrequires from six to seven days. The cheeses are then removed from the\r\ncylinders, brought into proper shape by a knife and wrapped with strong\r\ncotton cloth and allowed to remain for twelve days longer when they are\r\nremoved to the drying room and kept at 65 degrees. During this process\r\nthe original curd placed in the cell loses about one-half its weight\r\nso that ten pounds of curd in the end make five pounds of cheese. A\r\nvery common method also is to make cheese twice a day from morning\r\nmilk and evening milk separately. Extra cream is often added in making\r\nStilton cheese, only whole milk or milk and added cream being used. The\r\nprincipal point to be considered with curing is the regulation of the\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nOther varieties of cheese which are known in England are mostly named\r\nfrom the localities where they are produced and partake in general of\r\nthe character of cheeses already described. These are Lancastershire,\r\nWensleydale, skimmed milk cheese, butter milk cheese, potato cheese,\r\nand various forms of soft cheese or those used without being allowed to\r\nripen for any length of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Varieties of Cheese Made in France.=--There is a general idea that\r\nFrance is pre-eminently a cheese making country and this is true in so\r\nfar as the making of certain brands of cheese which have international\r\nreputations is concerned. France, however, according to statistics,\r\nimports a larger quantity of cheese than she exports though probably\r\nthe value of her exports is greater than the imports because of the\r\nhigh character and price of the exported articles.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Manufacture of Camembert._--The first cheese of this variety was made\r\nin 1791 by Marie Fontaine on a farm in the community of Camembert, near\r\nVimontiers. The period of manufacture of Camembert cheese extends from\r\nMarch to September. It is made from whole cow’s milk from which none of\r\nthe cream has been extracted. The rennet is added at the temperature at\r\nwhich the milk comes from the cow as nearly as possible and the milk is\r\nartificially heated, the morning and evening milk being mixed, to this\r\ntemperature. After the addition of rennet the milk is gently stirred\r\nfor two or three minutes, a wooden cover placed over the pan, and\r\nleft for five or six hours. The curd is sufficiently set when touched\r\nwith the finger it does not adhere thereto. The curd is removed from\r\nthe pan by a spoon and put into cylindrical metal molds open at the\r\nend and from these molds the whey is allowed to escape. It requires\r\nabout two liters of milk to make one cheese. The whey is allowed to\r\ndrain for about two days. After that time the mold is turned, a little\r\nfine white salt placed upon the top and allowed to drain for another\r\nday. After about 48 hours the cheeses are taken from the molds and\r\nsalted. They are then placed in the drying room upon racks covered\r\nwith straw. The drying room must be well ventilated and the air which\r\nis blown in for ventilation must be strained to be free of dust and\r\ninsects. Care is taken also to exclude the sunlight, as this is very\r\ninjurious to the proper development and ripening of cheese. The cheese\r\nremains in the dryer from 20 to 25 days. The ripening cellar is the\r\nnext point to which the cheese is removed, and this cellar is kept as\r\nnearly as possible at 50 degrees F. The cheeses remain in the ripening\r\ncellar about 30 days, during which time they are frequently turned and\r\ncarefully watched. The progress of the fermentation which takes place\r\nin the cheese is indicated by its appearance. In modern times the\r\nmanufacture of Camembert cheese is continued practically throughout the\r\nwhole year, but the artificially ripened cheese, that is, made during\r\nthe winter by the aid of artificial heat, does not compare in quality\r\nwith the product which is naturally ripened during the summer months.\r\nThe manufacture of Camembert cheese has extended to a considerable\r\ndistance from the original village, but it is all made in that part of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Emmenthaler Cheese._--Emmenthaler cheese is a variety of Swiss cheese\r\nof the same type as Gruyère. It is sometimes called the “cart-wheel”\r\ncheese on account of its immense size. These cheeses are sometimes\r\nthree or four feet in diameter and of a disk-like shape, something\r\nlike a wooden wheel sawed out of a round tree. It is a cheese which\r\nwas originally made in Switzerland, although the manufacture of it has\r\nspread over into that part of France bordering Switzerland. It has the\r\ngeneral character of Swiss cheese in texture, also in composition and\r\nnutritive value.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Brie Cheese._--This is one of the most famous of French cheeses. It\r\nis made in the form of a round flat mass about 16 inches in diameter\r\nfor the grande Brie and 12 inches in diameter for the petite Brie. The\r\nthickness of the cheese is about one inch. The method of preparation is\r\nnot very greatly different from that of cheeses in general. During the\r\ncuring process, as in the case of Camembert, mould develops, especially\r\non the outside of the cheese, and the change which goes on in the\r\ninterior breaks down the casein, forming a creamy mass of a strong,\r\npiquant flavor. The mould which grows upon the outside of Brie cheese\r\ngives it a strong odor which reminds one of decomposition. Brie cheese\r\nmight be said to resemble in general properties the Camembert variety\r\nof cheese.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Roquefort_ cheese is a very popular cheese made in France from sheep’s\r\nmilk. When properly ripened it shows a green mould. It is made in a\r\nparticular way at Roquefort, and according to König has the following\r\ncomposition:\r\n\r\n  Water,        36.85 percent\r\n  Fat,          30.61    „\r\n  Proteids,     25.25    „\r\n  Lactic acid,   1.90    „\r\n  Ash,           5.39    „\r\n\r\n\r\n_Port Du Salut._--This variety of cheese has a most deserving\r\npopularity, not only upon the Continent but in the United States. It\r\nis, however, not so generally known in this country as the Roquefort\r\nand Camembert varieties. It was long manufactured by a secret process\r\nby the Trappist monks of Bricquebec in the Department of Manche.\r\n\r\nThe secret of the manufacture of this variety of cheese is guarded\r\nwith the same jealousy by the monks as is the secret of making the\r\nchartreuse liqueur. Port Du Salut is always put up in very small\r\npackages of cylindrical form, flat, and about one inch in thickness.\r\nThe cheese has a number of holes, in which it resembles the Swiss\r\ncheese. Its flesh, however, is mellow, and does not have the toughness\r\nnor solidity which characterizes the flesh of Swiss cheese. Although\r\nthe monks’ secret has been well guarded the general method of its\r\nmanufacture has been described (“Cheese and Cheese Making,” by Jas.\r\nLong and John Benson). The milk is brought to a temperature of 86\r\ndegrees F., and is treated with rennet in such a way as to separate the\r\ncurd in about one-half hour. The separation of whey is secured in the\r\nusual manner, first, by allowing broken curd to stand, and afterwards\r\nby pressure. A peculiar form of pressure is said to be used by the\r\nmonks,--a number of screws are placed side by side on a beam and a\r\nnumber of cheeses may be pressed at the same time. The pressure is\r\napplied solely by the hands and so is not very severe. After pressure\r\nthe cheeses are placed in a ripening cellar, which is kept at about\r\n54 degrees F. Care is taken in the ripening that the cheese does not\r\nbecome too dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pont L’Evêque_ cheese is well known upon the Continent, especially in\r\nFrance where it is made. It takes its name from the village where the\r\nmanufacture is carried on, which is not very far from Havre. The cheese\r\nis usually put up in a square or oblong package about one inch in\r\nthickness and of a size weighing about one pound. It has a tough crust\r\nand may be kept for some time after it is ripe with safety. The milk is\r\nset at a temperature of 88 degrees and a sufficient amount of rennet\r\nadded to produce precipitation of the curd in about fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nWhen the curd is stiff enough to be cut and removed it is placed upon\r\na mat made of rye straw through which the whey is allowed to filter.\r\nAs the whey runs off the curd becomes tougher and the mat is brought\r\ntogether in such a way as to exert gentle pressure. This separation of\r\nthe whey is continued until the curd can be placed in metal molds which\r\nvary in size according to the size of the intended cheeses. The cheese\r\nis ripened at a temperature of about 58 degrees in a humid cellar so as\r\nnot to lose too much water.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gervais_ cheese belongs strictly to the family of fancy cheese, being\r\nmade of a mixture of milk and cream. It is produced in large quantities\r\nin France and finds almost an exclusive domestic market. It is named\r\nfor its manufacturer, M. Gervais. The mixture is set at a very low\r\ntemperature, about 65 degrees. The rennet which is used is diluted with\r\nwater and added in small quantities so that the curd does not separate\r\nfor eight or ten hours. The whey is separated in a cloth bag and under\r\nvery gentle pressure. The cheeses are usually sold in only a partially\r\nripe state and the cheese combines the flavor of both cheese and cream.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bondon_ cheese is another cheese which is made largely in the region\r\nof Rouen. The size of the cheese is usually very small, from seven to\r\nnine being made from a gallon of milk. The method of manufacture is\r\nmore like that of Gervais and differs from it chiefly in being made\r\nsolely from milk instead of a mixture of milk and cream.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Limburger Cheese._--Limburger cheese is one of the most famous of the\r\ndifferent varieties of foreign cheese, chiefly because of its bad odor.\r\nThis odor is due to specific forms of ferments introduced during the\r\nripening process. Generally Limburger cheese is made from pure milk,\r\nbut occasionally skimmed or partially skimmed milk is used. The milk\r\nis set at rather a high temperature, from 92 to 100 degrees. After the\r\ncoagulation has taken place the curd is broken into pieces the size\r\nof a hen’s egg and allowed to settle to the bottom of the kettle as\r\nthe whey separates. In England a copper kettle is usually employed for\r\nthe testing vessel. After the whey has separated the curd is taken out\r\nand placed in rectangular molds with perforated bottoms, then laid on\r\ntables so that the remaining portion of the whey may drain off. The\r\nmolds are turned from time to time to promote the separation of the\r\nwhey and to make the cheeses keep their form. The cheeses are next\r\nplaced in rows on a flat table with thin pieces of boards between them\r\nand subjected to light pressure. During this time they are salted\r\nby applying salt externally and rubbing the surface at frequent\r\nintervals for three or four days. The salt dissolves and permeates\r\nthe mass. During the salting and pressing the cheeses are kept at a\r\nuniform temperature of about 60 degrees. The curing takes place in\r\ncellars, well ventilated but very moist, at a temperature of about 60\r\ndegrees. As the cheeses ripen they grow soft. The curd takes on its\r\ncharacteristic greasy appearance at the time of the ripening, becoming,\r\nat first, a yellow and then a reddish yellow. The softening begins on\r\nthe outside and proceeds toward the center and the cheese is considered\r\nto be marketable when one-fourth of it has taken on its characteristic\r\ntexture. The softening of Limburger cheese is due to a ferment which\r\nbreaks down into a soft mass the casein or paracasein of which the\r\ncheese is largely composed. By using the same kind of ferments and by\r\nfollowing the same process, imitations of Limburger cheese are made in\r\nthe United States and other countries. These imitations, however, never\r\nequal the original in the character of the product nor in flavor or\r\ntaste, and should not bear the name of the real article.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF LIMBURGER CHEESE.\r\n\r\n  Water,                        35.7 percent\r\n  Fat,                          34.2    „\r\n  Casein products,              24.2    „\r\n  Milk sugar and undetermined,   3.0    „\r\n  Ash,                           2.9    „\r\n\r\nLimburger cheese was first made in the Province of Lüttick in Belgium.\r\nIt has, however, come to be considered chiefly as of German production.\r\nThe chief cause of the putrefactive fermentation which takes place in\r\nLimburger cheese is the extremely moist condition in which it is kept.\r\nFor this purpose the atmosphere of the ripening cellar should be almost\r\nsaturated with aqueous vapor, containing at least 95 percent of its\r\nmaximum degree of saturation. This moist atmosphere, together with the\r\nlow temperature at which the curing takes place, keeps the cheese soft\r\nand promotes the putrifactive ferments. Under these conditions the\r\nsurface soon begins to get shiny and soft and changes from white to a\r\nreddish yellow. This change makes its way to the center, converting the\r\nharsh curd to a soft condition. The time required for this softening\r\nof the cheese is from four to six weeks. (“Cheese Making,” by John W.\r\nDecker.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edam Cheese._--Edam cheese is one of the most famous of the cheeses\r\nof Holland. It is made at the town of Edam, situated on the Zuyder\r\nZee, about twelve miles northeast of Amsterdam. The milk from which\r\nEdam cheese is made should be properly acidified as has already been\r\ndescribed. The coagulation takes place and the curd is separated much\r\nin the same manner as is used in the manufacture of Cheddar cheese. The\r\ncurd is held for a time in the vat in a granular condition in order to\r\ndevelop greater acidity and until it will string one-half inch or one\r\ninch on the hot iron already described. It is then ready for the mold.\r\nThe molds are of such a character as to give the cheese a spherical\r\nshape about six inches in diameter. Each cheese weighs about four\r\npounds. It has a perfectly solid texture and its flavor is something\r\nlike that of old Cheddar, except that it is a little more salty and\r\nsomewhat harder. It is cured at a temperature of about 60 degrees and\r\nat a humidity of about 80 degrees. The curing period is somewhat longer\r\nthan for most cheeses, lasting about eight or ten months and even a\r\nyear. A slow curing is particularly necessary in the production of Edam\r\ncheese.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coating with Paraffine._--In the curing of cheese sometimes it is\r\ncoated with paraffine to avoid loss of weight. Coating with paraffine\r\ndoes not necessarily interfere with the character of the cheese, though\r\nit is probable that it must interfere in some way with the normal\r\nferments. Paraffine is wholly indigestible and may produce injurious\r\neffects if swallowed with the cheese. (“Farmers’ Bulletins,” Nos.\r\n186-190.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fancy Cheeses.=--There is a large number of cheeses made in which\r\ncream enters as a prominent part. It is difficult to give these any\r\nparticular name and the term “fancy cheese” has been applied to this\r\nform of cheese as a whole. They are usually put up in small packages\r\nor little pots and thus form an article of diet quite distinct from\r\nthe large press cheese of commerce. In fact they are intended more for\r\ncondimental purposes and to be eaten in something of the same manner as\r\nbutter rather than cheese. These cheeses usually are sold for a much\r\nhigher price and, therefore, can be regarded more as a luxury than as a\r\nregular article of diet.\r\n\r\nIt might be well to mention some of the more particular varieties of\r\nthese fancy cheeses.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gruyère._--Gruyère is a cheese made in Switzerland, where it is much\r\nprized and from where it is sent to the various parts of the world.\r\nIt is a pressed cheese and is rather of a larger size than the fancy\r\ncheeses already described, and it is difficult to say whether or not it\r\nshould find a place among them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parmesan._--Parmesan is a variety of cheese made in Italy. It is\r\nabout the same size as Gruyère and thus has an intermediate place\r\nbetween the large pressed cheeses of commerce and the fancy cheeses\r\nabove mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gorgonzola_ cheese is a very familiar cheese made in Italy and belongs\r\nto the same class as the two preceding ones. It is in one sense a fancy\r\ncheese and yet is made in such quantities as to belong rather to the\r\ncommercial variety.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bacterial Activity in Cheese.=--Modern science has led to the\r\nconclusion that the ripening of cheese is due principally to bacterial\r\nactivity. The changes which take place in the chemical and physical\r\nproperties of cheese materials, the flavor and aroma which are\r\ndeveloped, the production of mould and other growths are marks of the\r\nactivity of organisms of different character, living and unorganized.\r\nDue credit must be given to the enzymic (unorganized) action in these\r\nprocesses and the enzymes are not regarded as living organisms but,\r\non the other hand, as catalytic agents inducing chemical changes\r\nsimilar to those produced in starch by the action of diastase. The\r\npeculiar flavors of cheeses which are found in different kinds have\r\nbeen ascribed in late years almost exclusively to the character of\r\nbacterial activity. This assumption is perhaps correct, but it must\r\nnot be forgotten in this connection that the same species of bacteria,\r\nin changed environments, does not always produce the same results. The\r\nactivities of bacteria are peculiarly sensitive to the environment,\r\nsuch as change of temperature, physical conditions of different kinds,\r\nlocality, and other factors of a complex nature, making up the total\r\nconditions in which the organisms live. For this reason the attempts to\r\nproduce peculiar cheeses which belong in particular localities in other\r\nlocalities have not been gustatorily even if technically successful. It\r\nis true that cheeses may be made of the types mentioned, having some of\r\nthe general characteristics but lacking that indescribable something\r\nwhich after all gives true character. Just as it is impossible to make\r\na Rhine wine in California or a Bordeaux wine in New York so is it\r\nimpossible to make a Cheddar cheese in Ohio or a Camembert cheese in\r\nConnecticut.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Number of Bacteria.=--The number of bacteria, per gram, which appear\r\nin cheese varies according to the age of the cheese, conditions under\r\nwhich it is made, temperature, etc. The usual number of bacteria in one\r\ngram of cheese varies from five hundred thousand to nearly one hundred\r\nmillion (21st Annual Report of the Wisconsin Agricultural Experiment\r\nStation).\r\n\r\nAgeing does not seem to increase the number of organisms, since it has\r\nbeen found by some observers that the maximum number present in cheese\r\nis found at the time it is taken from the press. It is difficult also\r\nto properly sample a cheese for the number of bacteria, since they\r\nare unequally distributed in different parts thereof, and the trier,\r\nby means of which the sample is secured, may show largely differing\r\nnumbers in different parts of the same cheese. During the process of\r\ncuring, especially if the curing be at a high temperature, the number\r\nof organisms decreases. At first the decrease is very rapid and then\r\nbecomes slower as the cheese becomes riper. The decrease in the number\r\nof bacteria when the temperature of curing is raised is somewhat\r\ncontrary to expectations. It has been found that when a cheese is taken\r\nfrom cold storage, say at 24 degrees F., and placed in a temperature\r\nof 60 degrees F., the decline in the number of bacteria is always\r\ngreater than when the cheese is retained at the lower temperature. This\r\nmay be due to the fact that bacteria which have been developed at a\r\nlow may lose their vitality at a higher temperature. On the contrary,\r\nthe development of flavor does not seem to depend upon the number of\r\norganisms since the peculiar flavor of cheese is more rapidly developed\r\nat the higher temperature, provided it be not too high, although this\r\nbe attended with a diminution in the number of organisms. Evidently the\r\nconditions which favor the metabolic activities of organisms also favor\r\ntheir destruction, since when they have performed their functions they\r\nundergo natural disintegration. The character of cheese is such that\r\nwhen it is once formed there is no more opportunity given for a rapid\r\nproliferation of the organisms.\r\n\r\nIt may be found, however, that the development of bacterial life is\r\nnot the sole or perhaps not the dominant factor in the development of\r\nflavors and aromas in cheeses but that this process is due very largely\r\nto the enzymic activities obtained from the rennet and which pre-exist\r\nin the milk.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Chemical Changes Which Take Place During the Ripening of the\r\nCheese.=--_Loss of Weight._--During the process of ripening of cheese\r\nthere is considerable loss of weight, amounting to from 15 to 20\r\npercent of the total weight of the fresh product. This loss is due\r\nchiefly to the evaporation of water, while in the fermentation which\r\ntakes place volatile bodies are formed which also escape with the\r\nwater. For instance, any free gas, either carbon dioxid, hydrogen, or\r\nnitrogen, which is produced will escape, likewise any alcohol which is\r\nformed will at least partially volatilize. There may be also a slight\r\nloss due to mechanical attrition, but that is not of any consequence.\r\nOwing to the loss of water some of the constituents which may diminish\r\nin actual quantity have their percentages proportionately increased.\r\nThese changes are illustrated by the following analytical data:\r\n\r\n                                                     MILK\r\n                            WATER.  PROTEIN.  FAT.  SUGAR.  ASH.\r\n  Fresh cheese,              40.42    24.80  28      1.65   5.43\r\n  In the dry substance,       ....    41.62  46.99   ....   ....\r\n  Same cheese one year old,  33.12    27.35  31.70   2.96   4.87\r\n  In the dry substance,       ....    40.89  47.40   ....   ....\r\n\r\nThe quantity of water which is lost in part depends upon the\r\ntemperature of the store house and the dryness of the air. The loss of\r\nwater should not be too great, otherwise the cheese would be dry and\r\nthe ripening process would not go on in a proper manner. In some of\r\nthe processes which take place during the ripening of cheese water is\r\nformed. If, therefore, there is no loss of weight during the process\r\nof ripening, the ripened cheese would have more water than the fresh\r\ncheese and this would impair the quality of the product. The loss of a\r\ncertain part of water, namely, from 15 to 20 percent must be regarded\r\nas an advantage in the production of cheese.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Changes in the Protein._--The most important chemical changes, from\r\na digestive point of view, which take place in the cheese are those\r\nwhich the protein undergoes. This protein substance consists chiefly\r\nof casein and undergoes profound alteration due to enzymic action\r\nduring the process of ripening. The casein which when dry naturally\r\nforms a leathery, tough material changes into a more soluble and softer\r\nproduct, and during this change there are produced aromas and flavors\r\nwhich add much to the value of the cheese for edible purposes.\r\n\r\nThe character of the coagulation of the cheese originally has much\r\nto do with the general changes which the product undergoes during\r\nfermentation. The cheese makers for this reason must pay special\r\nattention to the rennet which they employ in the production of the\r\nprecipitate. One of the most important of the changes which the casein\r\nundergoes is that which results in the production of ammonia. This\r\nindicates a complete decomposition of the protein substance, at least\r\nin part, so that the total amount of protein which is lost as such\r\nmay reach as high as 25 or 30 percent of that present in the original\r\ncheese. There are also produced notable quantities of lucin and other\r\nnitrogenous compounds soluble in alcohol. In general it may be said\r\nthat the changes in the nitrogen constituents of cheese are extremely\r\nhelpful to digestion. Not only is the protein of ripened cheese more\r\nsoluble but even the parts which remain unchanged as far as the protein\r\nconstituent is concerned are so affected by the action of fermentation\r\nas to render them more readily subject to the action of the digestive\r\nferments in the alimentary canal. There is a popular superstition that\r\nthe use of cheese at the end of a meal helps to digest the other food\r\nwhich has given rise to the adage “Cheese, thou mighty elf, digesting\r\nall things but thyself.” There is a base of scientific truth in this\r\nexpression since in ripe cheese the enzymes remain still in an active\r\nform and when taken into the stomach must necessarily exercise an\r\ninfluence of considerable magnitude upon the process of digestion. The\r\ncustom, therefore, which is so universal, of finishing a dinner with a\r\nbit of cheese is evidently based upon sound physiological as well as\r\ngastronomical principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Changes in the Fat._--The chemical changes which the fat undergoes in\r\nthe process of ripening the cheese are also of considerable importance.\r\nIt is claimed by some authors that additional fat is produced from\r\nthe casein during the process of ripening, which is the cause of the\r\nlardy appearance of some cheeses. Many observers have found in ripened\r\ncheese a larger percentage of fat than that which was noticed in the\r\nfresh cheese. This apparent increase, however, may be due to analytical\r\nerror, since in the fresh cheese the fat becomes entangled with highly\r\ninsoluble caseous matter and is difficult of extraction, whereas after\r\nthe ripening of the cheese and degradation and breaking up of the\r\ncaseous tissues the fat is much more readily extracted. While it is not\r\nimpossible that fat should be formed by the fermentation of the casein\r\nit does not seem that it is probable.\r\n\r\nIn examinations which were made of fresh and ripened cheese of the\r\nvariety known as Roquefort there was found in the dry substance of\r\nthe fresh cheese 40.80 percent of protein and 53.91 percent of fat.\r\nIn the same cheese after it was quite old there was found in the dry\r\nsubstance 37.78 percent of protein and 56.14 percent of fat. These data\r\nserve to bear out the theory that fat is formed from the protein. On\r\nthe contrary, it must be remembered that in the fermentation of the\r\nprotein a number of volatile bodies are formed, especially ammonia, and\r\nthus the diminution in the percentage of protein is probably due to\r\nthe loss of volatile bodies, and the increase in the quantity of fat\r\nis therefore a relative one, probably, and not absolute. There is no\r\ndoubt, however, of the fact that the quantity or character of the fat\r\ndoes change considerably during the process of ripening. There is no\r\nreason for supposing that the fat alone of all the contents of cheese\r\nescapes enzymic action. It is profoundly changed in its character by\r\nthe fermentations to which it is subjected, and this change, while it\r\nunsuits the fat for butter, may probably make it more palatable and\r\ndesirable in cheese.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Digestibility of Cheese.=--Reference has already been made to the fact\r\nthat in the ripening of cheese the protein of the milk, consisting\r\nprincipally of casein, undergoes certain changes which apparently, at\r\nleast, increase its digestibility. I use the word “apparent” because\r\nthe flavor and aromas which are produced in the ripening of a cheese\r\nact as condimental substances and thus naturally excite the glands\r\nwhich secrete the digestive enzymes to greater activity. Therefore the\r\nincreased digestibility may be due in part to the increased activity of\r\nthe digestive ferments as above described rather than to the changes\r\nin the casein itself. It must be admitted, however, that these changes\r\nduring ripening tend to make the casein more granular, softer, and\r\nto convert it into compounds more easily acted upon, and are thus\r\nfavorable to increased digestibility. Experimental studies have shown\r\nthat in a well ripened American cheese of the Cheddar type 93 percent\r\nof the protein present in the cheese and 95 percent of the fat are\r\ndigested. Artificial digestion experiments have also shown that the\r\npancreas ferments have much more effect upon cheese digestion than\r\nthe peptic, showing that the cheese is more acted upon in the small\r\nintestines, perhaps, than in the stomach. Attention must also be paid\r\nto idiosyncrasies in these cases, as there are many people who find\r\nit impossible to digest cheese in any form. The eating of larger\r\nquantities than are necessary also tends to derange the digestive\r\norgans. A well ripened cheese, therefore, should be eaten rather as a\r\ncondimental substance than as an actual food product, though its value\r\nas a food is fully attested. (“Farmers’ Bulletin,” No. 162.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Effect of Cold Storage on the Curing of Cheese.=--Attention has been\r\ncalled, in the description of different methods of making varieties of\r\ncheeses, to the ordinary temperature at which cheeses are cured. In\r\nEuropean countries these temperatures are maintained without the use\r\nof artificial means. In the United States it is difficult to maintain\r\na very low temperature in summer time without the use of artificial\r\nrefrigerators. Experimental studies have determined that when the\r\ntemperature of ripening or storage is reduced to a considerable extent\r\nbelow that usually specified for the standard varieties of cheese the\r\nquality of the cheese is superior although the time for storage or\r\nripening is very much prolonged. The artificial curing of cheese has\r\nbeen secured at as low a temperature as 40 degrees. There is also a\r\nless loss of weight in cheese cured at this low temperature. A cheese\r\nwhich was cured at 40 degrees when examined by experts scored a mark\r\nof 92.4 while the same cheese ripened at 60 degrees scored 95. Another\r\ntest of a cheese cured at 40 degrees scored 95.7 while the same cheese\r\ncured at 50 degrees was marked 94.2 and the cheese cured at 60 degrees\r\n91.7.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Preparations of Casein.=--Properly in connection with cheese\r\npreparations may be mentioned those products which are of a food value,\r\nprocured from casein itself. The precipitated casein is prepared for\r\nthe market by washing, drying, and grinding to a fine powder, and is\r\nthen sometimes called protein flour. Sanose is a mixture consisting\r\nof about 80 percent of casein and 20 percent of the protein derived\r\nfrom the white of egg. The addition of the white of egg enables the\r\ncasein to remain in suspension when mixed with water and thus causes\r\nthe preparation to resemble milk. Casein preparations of this form are\r\npractically insoluble in water and, therefore, are not perhaps of the\r\nbest forms of nitrogenous food for invalids. To avoid this insolubility\r\nthe casein has been combined with alkalies and the preparations are\r\nknown as _nutrose_ and _eucasein_. Plasma is also a preparation of\r\ncasein with alkalies which are added in sufficient quantities to give\r\n7 percent of ash. These caseinates, as they are sometimes called,\r\nthat is, combinations of casein with alkalies, are soluble in water\r\nand are found to be to a certain extent digestible and nutritive\r\npreparations. Casumen and sanatogen are other preparations of casein\r\nwith alkalies or glycero-phosphate. Wonderful claims are made by\r\nmanufacturers concerning the digestibility and nutritive properties of\r\nthese preparations. It is doubtful, however, if they have much greater\r\nvalue, if any, than natural casein in the form of milk or as ripened\r\nin cheese. Preparations of this kind usually appeal strongly to those\r\nwho suffer from digestive disorders and therefore high-sounding names,\r\nwhich are given to practically the same preparations, lead the seeker\r\nafter health often to try the same substance under a dozen different\r\nappellations. These remarks are not made for the purpose of decrying\r\nin any way the merits which these preparations may have but only\r\nto illustrate a very marked tendency on the part of many people to\r\nattribute extreme virtues to ordinary food substances which are sold\r\nunder attractive and sometimes deceptive names and whose properties and\r\nvirtues are advertised in an expert manner. Because a food substance\r\nconsists almost wholly of pure protein is no indication whatever of\r\nits exceptionally high food value. Protein is only one form of food\r\nand a concentrated ration of protein in any of these forms is just\r\nas likely to do harm as good. For emergency rations, for economy in\r\ntransportation, and for certain diseased conditions of the digestive\r\norgans these preparations are undoubtedly valuable, but they have\r\nlittle claim upon the general public in a state of health as staple\r\narticles of diet. They are much more nutritive than the extracts\r\nof beef and other meats which have obtained a vogue wholly out of\r\nproportion to their dietetic or medicinal value. (“Foods and Principles\r\nof Dietetics,” by Robert Hutchinson.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V.\r\n\r\nCEREAL FOODS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARLEY (GENUS _Hordeum_).\r\n\r\nIn the United States barley is not used to any extent as human food.\r\nIt has all the nutritive properties of the common cereals and may be\r\nconsidered as a food product, although its chief use is in the making\r\nof fermented beverages which will be described in full in the second\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\nBarley is cultivated chiefly in the northern and western portions of\r\nthe United States and is similar to the oat in this respect, that when\r\nthe grain is threshed by the ordinary process the first layer of chaff\r\nis not separated, and, therefore, it goes into the market unhulled.\r\nThere are varieties of naked barley which are not much cultivated. The\r\ncultivated varieties (_Hordeum sativum_ Pers.) belong practically to\r\none species, although there are very many different varieties grown.\r\n\r\nThe character of barley best suited to malting will be discussed in the\r\nsecond volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Acreage and Yield of Barley._--The area planted to barley in the\r\nUnited States and other statistical data relating thereto for the year\r\n1906 are as follows:\r\n\r\n  Acreage,             6,323,757\r\n  Yield per acre,             28.3 bushels\r\n  Total production,  178,916,484     „\r\n  Price per bushel,           41.5 cents\r\n  Value of crop,      74,235,997   dollars\r\n\r\n\r\n=Composition of a Typical Unhulled Barley.=--From a comparative study\r\nof a number of samples of American barley the following numbers are\r\nregarded as typical of the composition of the unhulled barley grown in\r\nthe United States:\r\n\r\n  Weight of 100 kernels,    4.53 grams\r\n  Moisture,                10.85 percent\r\n  Protein,                 11.00    „\r\n  Ether extract,            2.25    „\r\n  Crude fiber,              3.85    „\r\n  Ash,                      2.50    „\r\n  Starch and sugar, etc.,  69.55    „\r\n\r\nThe important points brought out in the above data are that the\r\npercentage of fiber in the unhulled barley is less than one-half that\r\nof the unhulled oat, as stated further on, while the percentage of\r\nether extract is only about one-half that of the unhulled oat, and the\r\nprotein is also decidedly less than in the whole oat.\r\n\r\nAs has been stated, barley is not very generally used in this country\r\nfor human food, but is used in this and other countries as an\r\ningredient of soup.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--BARLEY STARCH. × 200.--(_Bureau of\r\nChemistry._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Protein of Barley.=--The following protein compounds are found in\r\nbarley in proportionate weight to the total weight of the seed:\r\n\r\n  Leucosin,           0.30 percent\r\n  Hordein,            4.00    „\r\n  Edestin,            1.95    „\r\n  Proteose,           1.95    „\r\n  Insoluble protein,  4.50    „\r\n\r\nAs seen from the above table the most important of the soluble proteins\r\nis hordein, which in quantity is almost equal to the insoluble protein\r\nof the barley grain. The starch granules of barley are recognized by\r\ntheir distinctive shape and size, as revealed by the microscope. A\r\ntypical microphotographic view of barley starch is shown in Fig. 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUCKWHEAT (_Polygonum fagopyrum_ L.).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Buckwheat= is usually classed with the cereals, but botanically it\r\ndoes not belong to the order of true grasses to which the cereals\r\nbelong.\r\n\r\nBuckwheat is commonly grown in many parts of the United States, and its\r\nseed is highly prized for bread and cake making purposes. The buckwheat\r\nis ground and the outer black tough hull separated, and the flour is\r\nused chiefly for making hot breakfast cakes which are much prized\r\nthroughout the country. Properly ground buckwheat flour has a more\r\nor less dark tint, due to fine particles of the outer envelope which\r\nescape the bolting process.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Acreage and Yield of Buckwheat._--This crop is not grown in many\r\nstates. New York, Pennsylvania, and Michigan produce the largest\r\nquantities. The statistical data for buckwheat grown in the United\r\nStates in 1906 are as follows:\r\n\r\n  Acreage,              789,208\r\n  Yield per acre,            18.6 bushels\r\n  Production,        14,641,937     „\r\n  Price per bushel,          59.6 cents\r\n  Total value,        8,727,443   dollars\r\n\r\n\r\n=Composition of Buckwheat Flour.=--The composition of finely bolted\r\nbuckwheat flour is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Moisture,              11.89 percent\r\n  Protein,                8.75    „\r\n  Ether extract,          1.58    „\r\n  Ash,                    1.85    „\r\n  Fiber,                   .52    „\r\n  Starch and sugar,      75.41    „\r\n  Calories per gram,  3,854\r\n\r\nThe above is the composition of a white flour more finely ground and\r\nbolted than is advisable for palatable purposes. In the grinding of the\r\nabove flour the germ which contains a greater part of ether extract is\r\neliminated and also a large quantity of the bodies rich in protein.\r\nThe composition of a less highly refined flour and one which is more\r\npalatable and more nutritious is given in the following data:\r\n\r\n  Moisture,              11.19 percent\r\n  Protein,                9.81    „\r\n  Ether extract,          2.33    „\r\n  Ash,                    1.53    „\r\n  Fiber,                   .73    „\r\n  Starch and sugar,      74.41    „\r\n  Calories per gram,  3,954\r\n\r\n\r\n=Milling Process.=--In the preparation of the so-called highest grade\r\nof buckwheat flour, that is, that which is most carefully ground and\r\nthoroughly bolted, the process employed is as follows: During the\r\nprocess of milling the buckwheat grains pass to a receiving separator\r\nwhich removes all the coarse particles, stones, straws, etc., by means\r\nof a series of sieves. At the same time any dust which they contain\r\nis blown out by a current of air. The sifted grains pass next to the\r\nscouring machines, in which they are thoroughly scoured, cleaned, and\r\npolished. From these machines the grains pass to a separator containing\r\nmagnets, by means of which any pieces of metal, in the form of nails,\r\nscrews, pieces of wire, etc., are removed.\r\n\r\nThe grains next pass through a steam dryer for removing the greater\r\nportion of the water employed for the scouring. As soon as they are dry\r\nthey are again treated to a blast of air, which removes any dirt, dust,\r\nor light particles which may have been detached during the process of\r\ndrying. The grains next pass to the shelling rolls, where the greater\r\npart of the outer hulls is removed. This process is accomplished by\r\nmeans of an apparatus which is called a sieve scalper. After the\r\nseparation of the outer hulls the residue of the material passes to\r\na drying chamber, where the moisture is reduced to about 10 percent,\r\nthus insuring the keeping qualities of the flour. After drying the\r\ngrains are ready for the rolls. After entering the rolls the process\r\nis practically the same as that which is employed in milling wheat,\r\nconsisting of a series of breaks and reductions, with the attendant\r\nbolting and grading, and this process is prolonged until the flour is\r\npractically removed from the feed or middlings. The sifting cloths used\r\nin the bolting of buckwheat flour are somewhat coarser than those for\r\nwheat, and this allows some of the dark particles of the inner hulls\r\nto pass into the flour, which gives it a dark color on baking. It is\r\nquite possible to make a buckwheat flour as white as that from wheat,\r\nbut in this country the public taste requires a darker product, so\r\nthat the white flour does not readily sell. The requisite degree of\r\ndarkness is secured by using bolting cloths which will allow a part\r\nof the inner hulls (middlings) to pass into the flour. Two grades of\r\nflour are generally produced--a whiter one in which finer cloths are\r\nused, and a darker flour made by using coarser bolting cloths, allowing\r\nlarger quantities of middlings to pass through. The outer hulls which\r\nare first removed are used for fuel, although from their composition it\r\nis seen that they contain a large quantity of carbohydrates and might\r\nbe very profitably used in connection with some highly nitrogenous\r\nfood, such as cottonseed meal or flaxseed meal for feeding cattle.\r\nThe middlings are used principally as cattle food, and especially by\r\ndairymen.\r\n\r\nThe above process, while it makes a white and fine-looking flour, is\r\nnot to be compared with the meal made in the old-fashioned way of\r\ngrinding between stones and separating the principal part of the outer\r\nhull by bolting. This old-fashioned flour is more nutritious, that is,\r\nit contains more fat and protein, has a greater fuel value, or in other\r\nwords has a greater number of calories and makes a much more palatable\r\ncake than the fine modern flour.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Buckwheat Cakes.=--Buckwheat cakes are prepared from batter made by\r\nmixing buckwheat flour into a paste of the proper consistency, seeding\r\nit with yeast, and allowing it to remain in a moderately warm place\r\nuntil fermentation takes place. The proteins of buckwheat have some\r\nagglutinating power, and thus, when treated as above, make a cake\r\ncapable of a considerable degree of aeration. Baking powders are\r\noften used as a substitute for yeast and permit of preparation in a\r\nfew minutes instead of waiting for the fermentation above mentioned.\r\nThe product made in this way cannot be considered so palatable or\r\nnutritious as the old-fashioned product. The batter is baked on a\r\nsmooth hot iron or soapstone, polished and kept bright in order to\r\nprevent the sticking of the cake. The proper polishing of the iron is\r\na better means of preventing sticking than greasing. The batter is\r\npoured over the smooth iron and is of a consistency to flatten out\r\nwithout help and to form a film over the baking iron, which produces a\r\ncake about one-fourth of an inch in thickness. The cake is to be turned\r\nas soon as the side in contact with the iron is brown. It is evident\r\nthat in this baking process there can be no very profound change in\r\nthe starch granules, but this does not appear to materially interfere\r\nwith the digestibility of the product. Buckwheat cakes are eaten hot,\r\nusually with butter and sirup. Maple sirup, sorghum sirup, or cane\r\nsirup in a pure state are highly prized for use with buckwheat cakes.\r\nThese sirups are both condimental and nutritious. Mixed sirups made\r\nof glucose, melted brown sugar, or molasses, or mixtures of all these\r\nbodies are more commonly furnished to the consumer than the pure sirup\r\nmentioned above. Honey is also used very extensively as a condimental\r\nflavor for cakes of this kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Adulterations.=--There is probably no bread or cake making material\r\nwhich is subjected to more extensive adulteration than buckwheat flour.\r\nMuch of what is sold as buckwheat flour may be regarded as imitations\r\nof that substance. Mixtures of rye flour, Indian corn flour, wheat\r\nflour, and other ground cereals are used as a substitute for buckwheat.\r\nThere can be no objection from the hygienic point of view to such\r\nsubstitutes but the use of these mixtures under the name of buckwheat\r\ncan be regarded in no other light than as an unpardonable fraud.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Detection of Adulterations.=--There is rarely any mineral adulteration\r\npracticed with buckwheat flour and if so it is easily detected by\r\nincineration. Any content of ash, unless baking powder has been\r\nused, above 2 percent may be regarded with suspicion as indicating\r\nan admixture of some mineral substance. The cereal flours used for\r\nadulteration are readily detected by the microscope in the hands of\r\nan experienced observer. The field of the microscope has only to be\r\ncompared with the microscopic appearance of genuine buckwheat starch in\r\norder to detect the added substance.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Buckwheat Starch.=--The microscopic appearance of buckwheat starch\r\nis shown in the accompanying figure. The granules of buckwheat starch\r\nare very characteristic. They consist of chains or groups of more or\r\nless angular granules with a well defined nucleus, and without rings or\r\nwith very faint rings. The contour of buckwheat starch is more angular\r\nthan that of any other common cereal with exception of maize and rice,\r\nand it is this and the relative size which enable the observer to\r\ndistinguish it from other starches. The size of the granules is quite\r\nuniform, varying usually only from 10 to 15 microns[23] in diameter. In\r\nso far as the angular appearance is concerned the granules of buckwheat\r\nstarch have a general resemblance to that of maize and rice and oats,\r\nbut a comparison under the microscope of the three starches reveals\r\nlines of distinction which with a little practice would prevent the\r\nobserver from drawing a false conclusion.\r\n\r\n  [23] A micron is one thousandth of a millimeter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--BUCKWHEAT STARCH. × 200.--(_Courtesy of Bureau\r\nof Chemistry._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN CORN (_Zea mays_).\r\n\r\nNext to wheat the most important cereal used as a human food in the\r\nUnited States is Indian corn. According to the magnitude of the crop,\r\nIndian corn is the leading cereal of the country. Statistical data on\r\nthe production of Indian corn in the United States during 1906 are\r\ngiven in the following table:\r\n\r\n  Acreage,              96,737,581\r\n  Yield per acre,               30.3 bushels\r\n  Production,        2,927,416,091     „\r\n  Value per bushel,             39.9 cents\r\n  Total value,       1,166,626,479   dollars\r\n\r\n\r\n=Indian corn= is universally employed as food throughout all parts\r\nof the country, but more especially in the South, where the daily\r\ndietary is rarely complete without one or more meals in which Indian\r\ncorn is served in some form or other. Although it is grown much more\r\nextensively in the North than in the South, it is not so generally used\r\nas human food. Indian corn grows in all kinds of soil and produces,\r\nunder favorable conditions, large yields in all parts of the country.\r\nIt is the most important agricultural crop of many states, namely,\r\nIndiana, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, and Kansas. It is planted in the\r\nlate winter and spring in different parts of the country. The planting\r\nseason varies from January in Florida to June in Maine and Minnesota\r\nand the earlier varieties will mature in 120 days.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Maize= is a crop which requires an abundance of rainfall and a high\r\ntemperature during the growing season. Maize is planted in rows about\r\nthree and one-half feet apart and in hills of about the same distance\r\napart, or it may be drilled between the rows so that one stalk grows\r\na distance of about from nine inches to a foot from its fellows. It\r\nrequires constant cultivation during the early period of its growth and\r\na careful preparation of the seed bed. Good farmers give from four to\r\nseven cultivations to the growing crop. The field must be kept free of\r\nweeds and in good tilth to secure the best results.\r\n\r\nMany hundreds of analyses of the maize kernel have been made, but\r\na combination of them all in the following data may be regarded as\r\ntypical of the Indian corn grown in this country.\r\n\r\n  Weight of 100 kernels,   38    grams\r\n  Moisture,                10.75 percent\r\n  Ether extract,            4.25    „\r\n  Protein,                 10.00    „\r\n  Fiber,                    1.75    „\r\n  Ash,                      1.50    „\r\n  Starch and sugar, etc.,  71.75    „\r\n\r\nThe consideration of the above data shows that Indian corn is a ration\r\nin which the protein is rather low. In other words, the ratio of\r\nprotein to the carbohydrates and fat is rather large. It is a food\r\nproduct which is particularly well suited to furnish heat and energy\r\nand support a high degree of muscular exertion. For this reason it is a\r\nfood product which is particularly well adapted to men engaged in hard\r\nmanual labor.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Varieties.=--There are many distinct varieties of Indian corn.\r\nSturtevant has published a description of several hundred. These\r\nvarieties are classified under various subspecies. The polymorphic\r\nspecies, _Zea mays_, according to Sturtevant, can be divided into a\r\nnumber of groups which, on account of their well defined and persistent\r\ncharacters, may be considered as presenting specific claims and may\r\nproperly receive specific nomenclature. The grouping adopted is founded\r\nupon the internal structure of the kernel for cultivated varieties, and\r\nthe presence of a husk to the kernel in the assumed aboriginal form.\r\nHence Sturtevant offers the names _Zea tunicata_ for the husk-kernel\r\nforms, _Zea everta_ for the popcorn, _Zea indurata_ for the flint\r\ncorns, _Zea indentata_ for the dent corns, _Zea amylacea_ for the soft\r\ncorns, and _Zea saccharata_ for the sweet corns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--SECTION OF RAW POPCORN. × 150.--(_Courtesy of\r\nBureau of Chemistry._) Shows cells with the small angular starch grains\r\nclosely packed together within them.]\r\n\r\nArgument in favor of the specific claims for these groups is based\r\nprimarily on the convenience thus attained; secondarily, on the absence\r\nor rarity of intermediate or connecting forms, so far as present data\r\nextend, and also on the antiquity of the separation. It seems almost\r\ncertain that in the order of evolution (excluding from consideration\r\nthe puzzling sweet corn group) progress has been from the pops, through\r\nthe flints and the dents, to the softs. Certainly the soft corns in\r\nsome of their varieties present a kernel that is larger, softer, and\r\nless fitted to the struggle with natural conditions than is the kernel\r\nfrom any of the other groups. Yet soft corns are the prevailing form in\r\nthe mummy burials of Peru and of our Southwestern states. The popcorn,\r\non the contrary, has stronger regerminative powers than have the other\r\ngroups, is better fitted to contend against natural vicissitudes, and\r\nis the kind that has been reported as found growing wild in Mexico\r\nunder the name of Coyote corn, _Zea canina_ Watts.\r\n\r\nSome of these subdivisions may not be accepted by botanists, but they\r\nare convenient for purposes of description. The principal field\r\nvarieties which are grown are the flint corn, _Zea indurata_, and the\r\ndent corn, _Zea indentata_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPCORN.\r\n\r\nThis variety of maize is used very largely in the United States as\r\na delicacy, and with sugar and cream as a dessert. It is a hard,\r\nsmall-grained variety which has the property, when heated, of exploding\r\nwith a very great enlargement of the starch grain, producing a soft and\r\nvery delicate edible material which is highly prized.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--SECTION OF POPCORN IN FIRST STAGE OF POPPING,\r\nSHOWING PARTIALLY EXPANDED STARCH GRAINS AND RUPTURED CELL WALLS. ×\r\n150.--(_Courtesy of Bureau of Chemistry._)]\r\n\r\nIn the raw popcorn the starch grains are packed together very closely\r\nwithin the cells. When popping begins there is an expanding of the\r\nstarch grains, producing a cavity nearly circular in form in each\r\ngrain. This causes a rupturing of the cell walls, though fragments\r\nare plainly visible in the early stages. In the fully expanded or\r\npopped kernel the starch grains have expanded until each is about\r\nhalf or two-thirds as large as the original cells of the endosperm.\r\nThe cell walls in this stage are practically obliterated as far as\r\ndetecting in a section is concerned. The exploding of the starch\r\ngrains is influenced by the water content of the kernel. It must not\r\nbe too wet nor too dry; about 10 or 12 percent is the proper content\r\nof moisture. These changes are beautifully shown in the accompanying\r\nmicrophotographs, Figs. 24, 25, and 26, by Mr. Howard, of the Bureau of\r\nChemistry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--SECTION OF FULLY POPPED POPCORN. ×\r\n150.--(_Courtesy of Bureau of Chemistry._) The fully expanded starch\r\ngrains are nearly half as large as the original cells in which they\r\nwere contained.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET CORN.\r\n\r\nThis is a variety of maize which develops a high sugar content and\r\nis eaten while the starch is yet soft, in other words, in an unripe\r\nstate. It is a food product of immense importance in the United States,\r\nalthough almost unknown in Europe. The content of sugar varies from\r\n5 to 8 percent in the fresh, soft kernel. The sugar which is present\r\nin the kernel rapidly disappears after the husking or removal from\r\nthe stalk. In order to secure the maximum sweetness the corn should\r\nbe cooked and eaten as soon as possible after removal from the stalk.\r\nWhere it is not possible to do this it should be placed in cold storage\r\nafter removal from the stalk and remain unhusked until it is ready for\r\ncooking. Green corn is universally eaten hot. It is usually cooked by\r\nboiling in water, although it may also be roasted before the fire. It\r\nhas a high food value, and the composition of the grains of fresh,\r\nsoft, green corn is shown in the following table:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Fresh Green Indian Corn_:\r\n\r\n  Moisture,     73.00 percent\r\n  Starch,       13.50    „\r\n  Sugars,        6.00    „\r\n  Protein,       5.00    „\r\n  Crude fiber,   1.20    „\r\n  Ash,            .70    „\r\n  Fat,            .60    „\r\n\r\n\r\n=Maize Proteins.=--The proteins of maize are composed principally of\r\ntwo zeins. The two forms are differentiated by their behavior toward\r\nalcohol. The first form constitutes the zein soluble in alcohol and\r\nthe second the zein insoluble in alcohol. There are two other proteins\r\nin maize existing in small quantities which have been named myosin and\r\nvitellin, respectively. There is also a third unnamed variety and small\r\nquantities of albumin.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Variation in Maize, under Different Climatic Conditions.=--It\r\nis possible that most of the varieties and subvarieties of maize\r\nare simply the existing standard varieties modified by changing\r\nenvironments. There are certain conditions of climate, soil, and\r\ndistribution of rainfall which tend to produce a large, starchy, soft\r\ngrain, while other conditions tend to produce a small, hard grain\r\nricher in protein. The variations of importance are those of the\r\ncarbohydrates and the protein, which are complementary, since as the\r\nprotein rises the carbohydrates fall in relative proportion. There\r\nis also a marked variation in the carbohydrates, due to variety and\r\nclimatic conditions combined. It is, for instance, the increase of the\r\nsugar at the expense of the starch that produces the body known as\r\nsweet maize eaten in the green state, as already described. Even in\r\nthe sweet variety the relative proportion of sugar varies in different\r\nlocalities and under different conditions of growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Early Varieties.=--There are certain varieties of maize which are\r\nof especial value on account of their early maturation. This is a\r\nproperty extremely valuable in the sweet variety of maize or that\r\neaten in the green state, since it is important to get these varieties\r\ninto the market as early as possible and to continue them as long as\r\npossible. This is secured by planting the early variety at as early\r\ndate as possible and planting later maturing varieties at intervals\r\nthereafter. By the selection of varieties of different periods of\r\nmaturing it is possible in the climate of Washington to offer green\r\ncorn from neighboring fields on the market from July until the advent\r\nof a killing frost which is usually the last of October or first of\r\nNovember. This gives a period of nearly four months during which the\r\ngreen corn may be delivered to the local market. Further south the\r\nperiod of supply is longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Canned Corn.=--Immense quantities of green corn are grown for the\r\npurpose of canning in order to supply the market during the closed\r\nseason. The canning industry for green corn is located chiefly in the\r\nnorth. In the eastern states the industry is of great importance, from\r\nMaryland to Maine. The northern-grown corns are often preferred as\r\nthey are supposed to be sweeter and more palatable. In the central\r\nwestern states, northern Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, northern\r\nIllinois, and Iowa are the principal centers of the canning industry,\r\nalthough it is practised to a greater or less extent in almost all\r\nparts of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Adulterations of Canned Corn.=--Unfortunately in the canning process\r\nof corn additions have been made to the product which are of an\r\nobjectionable nature. Chief among these is the use of bleaching agents\r\nsuch as sulfur in the form of burnt sulfur or of sulfite or bisulfite\r\nof soda or potash. These bleaching agents impart to the corn a white\r\ncolor which some consumers prefer, but at the expense of introducing\r\na substance which must be regarded as deleterious to health. Still\r\nmore objectionable is the practice of using saccharin instead of sugar\r\nas a sweetening agent. Saccharin is a coal tar product which has an\r\nintense, sweet taste, very persistent, and when used alone becomes\r\ndisagreeable. A very small quantity of it is sufficient to impart\r\na very sweet taste to the canned corn at a much less expense than\r\ncould be secured by using the pure sugar. This form of adulteration\r\nis extremely reprehensible both because it deceives the consumer and\r\nadds a substance which by most hygienists is regarded as prejudicial\r\nto health. The bleaching agent and the artificial sweetener are wholly\r\nunnecessary. The manufacturers of sweet corn are expected to use the\r\nbest and freshest and sweetest materials and cannot be excused for\r\ntampering with them in any way which either produces deception or\r\ninjury to health.\r\n\r\nSugar added to make an ordinary corn taste like sweet corn is to be\r\nregarded as an adulteration unless its use is noted on the label.\r\n\r\nMaize starch is also often added to sweet corn at the time of canning\r\nand this practice can only be regarded as an adulteration.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Detection of Adulterations in Sweet Corn.=--_Test for Sulfurous\r\nAcid._--To about 25 grams of the sample (with the addition of water, if\r\nnecessary) placed in a 200-c.c. Erlenmeyer flask, add some pure zinc\r\nand several cubic centimeters of hydrochloric acid. In the presence\r\nof sulfites, hydrogen sulfid will be generated and may be tested\r\nfor with lead paper. Traces of metallic sulfids are occasionally\r\npresent in vegetables, and by the above test will indicate sulfites.\r\nHence positive results obtained by this method should be verified\r\nby the distillation method.[24] It is always advisable to make the\r\nquantitative determination of sulfites, owing to the danger that the\r\ntest may be due to traces of sulfids. A trace is not to be considered\r\nsufficient as indicating either a bleaching agent or a preservative.\r\n\r\n  [24] U. S. Dept. Agr. Bureau of Chemistry, Circular No. 28, pp. 11-12.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Detection of Saccharin._[25]--Add from 25 to 40 c.c. of water to about\r\n20 grams of the sample; macerate and strain through muslin; acidify\r\nwith 2 c.c. of sulfuric acid (1 to 3) and extract with ether. Separate\r\nthe ether layer, allow the ether to evaporate spontaneously, and take\r\nup the residue with water. If saccharin be present its presence will\r\nbe indicated by the sweet taste imparted to the water. To confirm this\r\ntest add from one to two grams of sodium hydroxid, and place the dish\r\nin an oil bath. Maintain the temperature of the oil at 250° C. for 20\r\nminutes, when the saccharin will be converted into salicylic acid.\r\nAfter cooling and acidifying with sulfuric acid, extract in the usual\r\nway and test for salicylic acid. This test, of course, presupposes the\r\nabsence of salicylic acid in the original sample. If salicylic acid is\r\npresent in the original sample it must be removed before making the\r\ntest for saccharin.\r\n\r\n  [25] _Ibid._, Bul. 65, p. 51.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--INDIAN CORN STARCH. × 200.--(_Bureau of\r\nChemistry._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Starch of Indian Corn.=--Maize starch has characteristics which enable\r\nit to be easily detected by the microscope. The granules of this\r\nstarch are of a more uniform size than those of wheat and vary from\r\n20 to 30 microns in diameter. Occasionally very much smaller granules\r\noccur which probably are more of the original size and which have\r\nbeen arrested in growth by the ripening of the grain. The granules of\r\nmaize starch are more or less polyhedral in form with round angles.\r\nThe only common cereal starch which they can be mistaken for is rice,\r\nbut they are generally larger than the granules of rice. Under the\r\nmicroscope with ordinary light they give only the faintest sign of\r\nrings but show in most cases a well developed hilum, which is at times\r\nstar-shaped or like an irregular cross, while at other times it has\r\nthe appearance of a circular depression. The maize starch granular is\r\na type of the angular, as the wheat is of the sphere or spheroid form.\r\nThe characteristic appearance of maize starch kernels is shown in the\r\naccompanying Fig. 27. Viewed with polarized light the starch grains\r\nof Indian corn present deep, well marked crosses, which divide each\r\ngrain into four distinct parts as shown in Fig. 28. It is interesting\r\nto note that the angularity of maize starch is greatly influenced by\r\nthe hardness of the kernels from which the grains are taken. The hard\r\nvarieties, such as popcorn, have very angular grains while those from\r\nsoft varieties have a great many almost spherical forms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--STARCH GRAINS OF INDIAN CORN, UNDER POLARIZED\r\nLIGHT. × 200.--(_Courtesy of Bureau of Chemistry._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Maize Flour= (_Corn Meal_).--Formerly the maize kernel was ground\r\nbetween stones, bolted to remove the bran, and the maize flour or\r\ncorn meal thus produced used directly as a human food. Modern milling\r\noperations have changed the method of producing maize flour so that not\r\nonly is the outer bran removed but also, to a large extent, the germ\r\nitself, thus diminishing the quantity of fat in the prepared meal. This\r\nis notably true of the maize flour which is prepared for exportation.\r\nLeaving in the flour such a large quantity of fat tends to produce\r\nrancidity during shipment. To avoid any change of a deleterious nature\r\nwhich the flour may undergo during shipment, it is also frequently\r\nkiln-dried before being sent to foreign shores and even when intended\r\nfor domestic consumption at points remote from the mill.\r\n\r\nWhile this preparation of maize flour is doubtless important for\r\ntransportation purposes, it impairs the palatability and nutritive\r\nvalue of the product. It is advisable to continue to have the maize\r\nflour prepared in the old-fashioned way and sent directly into\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Method of Preparation.=--One method of preparing the maize flour is as\r\nfollows: The grains are broken into large pieces and dried with steam\r\nheat at a temperature of from 105° to 110° C. (221°-239° F.). The mass\r\nwhile still hot passes into a mill composed of two stones which revolve\r\nrapidly in opposite directions. The smaller portions of the meal,\r\nwhich have been reduced to a kind of gum by the high temperature, are\r\nseparated by this process from the covering or the bran of the kernel.\r\nA small mass of the starchy matter leaves the mill in the form of small\r\nnoodles, which are freed from any particles of bran by sifting. In this\r\nmanner a mass is obtained which is quite free from fiber and fat.\r\n\r\nThe composition of maize meal prepared by the above process is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Moisture,                     9.70 percent\r\n  Protein,                     12.68    „\r\n  Ether extract,                1.19    „\r\n  Ash,                           .60    „\r\n  Fiber,                         .35    „\r\n  Starch, sugar, and dextrin,  71.48    „\r\n\r\nThis method of preparing maize meal is not used to any extent in this\r\ncountry, but is said to be commonly employed in Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Composition of Maize Flour.=--The color of maize flour depends upon\r\nthe color of the corn from which it is produced,--it may be white or\r\nyellow. The starch granules when heated in water to 62.5° C. swell up\r\nand become deformed, except a few, usually the small ones, which resist\r\nthe action of water at that temperature. The starch granules of maize\r\nflour under polarized light present a black cross, very marked and very\r\ndistinct when the field is obscured. When viewed under polarized light\r\nwith a selenite plate the starch grains of maize are colored red with a\r\ngreen cross or reciprocally, and this coloration is very brilliant.\r\n\r\nAs has already been said, the composition of Indian corn meal made by\r\nthe old-fashioned method of grinding and removing only the bran is\r\npractically that of the whole grain itself.\r\n\r\nThe composition of degerminated maize meal (Indian corn flour) is shown\r\nby the following average data:\r\n\r\n  Moisture,                                  12.57 percent\r\n  Protein,                                    7.13    „\r\n  Ether extract,                              1.33    „\r\n  Ash,                                         .61    „\r\n  Fiber,                                       .87    „\r\n  Starch and sugar,                          78.36    „\r\n  Calories calculated on the moist meal,  3,837\r\n\r\nThe above data show that the refined Indian corn meal has lost more\r\nthan three-fourths of its fat, a large portion of its mineral matter,\r\nand also a very considerable proportion of its protein, due to the\r\nseparation of the bran which is extremely rich in protein and the germ\r\nwhich is rich both in oil and protein. A mere glance at the data shows\r\nthat this refined Indian corn meal is much less nutritious than the\r\nnatural meal in so far as its content of tissue-forming bodies and its\r\nfaculty to furnish heat and energy are concerned. In other words, the\r\ncalories are very much lower than in the natural corn meal. This is\r\nanother reason for urging our people to return to the consumption of\r\nthe old-fashioned material.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Adulteration of Indian Corn Meal.=--Owing to the cheapness of\r\nIndian corn in so far as is known there is no adulteration practiced.\r\nThe refined Indian corn flour itself is sometimes used as an\r\nadulteration for buckwheat flour, wheat flour, and other cereal flours,\r\nbut has not itself been subjected to adulteration.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Corn Bread= (_Indian Corn Bread_).--Corn bread is a very common diet\r\namong all classes of people in the southern states and also to a\r\nconsiderable extent in the north.\r\n\r\nOwing to the lack of agglutinating powers of the nitrogenous\r\nconstituents of Indian corn flour, corn bread cannot be aerated or\r\nraised, as is the case with wheat bread. It is often eaten in an\r\nunleavened state. It may be partially leavened by the usual agent,\r\nnamely, yeast or a chemical baking powder. Two varieties of bread are\r\nvery commonly used, namely, that made of white flour or meal and that\r\nmade of yellow. There is apparently no difference in the nutritive\r\nvalues of these two kinds. Some consumers prefer the white loaf and\r\nsome the yellow.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Composition of Indian Corn Bread.=--The composition of bread depends\r\nupon whether the whole grain flour is used from which only the coarse\r\nbran has been removed by bolting or whether the decorticated and\r\ndegerminated meal is used. In the first case bread is made richer in\r\nfat and protein and in the second case richer in starch. In the bread\r\nwill also be found the materials used in its preparation, namely,\r\nsalt, lard or other fats, milk, yeast, or baking powder residues. The\r\nbest bread is made from the freshly ground flour of the whole grain\r\nfrom which only the outer covering, namely, the coarse bran has been\r\nremoved. As offered at many of our hotels and some private houses,\r\ncorn bread has been so manipulated as to lose a large part of its\r\npalatability, without any compensating improvement of its nutritive\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\n\r\nOATS (GENUS _Avena_).\r\n\r\nThis cereal is an important food product, being used very largely in\r\nEurope, especially in Scotland, and also very extensively in this\r\ncountry as human food. The chief use of oats is for cattle food,\r\nespecially for horses. It is extraordinarily rich in its nutritive\r\nconstituents and, therefore, is prized highly as a food in the building\r\nand restoration of nitrogen tissues, such as the muscles. The variety\r\nin common cultivation is _Avena sativa_ L.\r\n\r\nOats are grown in almost every part of the United States, but chiefly\r\nin the northern and western portions. In the southern states the crop\r\nis planted in the late autumn or early winter. In the northern states\r\nit is chiefly a spring crop, being sown early in the spring as soon as\r\nthe ground is in fair condition. The oat crop is one which requires a\r\nrather abundant and well-distributed rainfall. A spring drought is very\r\ndetrimental to the growth of oats, much more so than wheat or rye. It\r\nis a crop which is well suited to be grown under irrigation.\r\n\r\nThere are many varieties of oats in cultivation, but in general\r\ncharacteristics they all correspond to one description. The husk\r\nadheres firmly to the grain, and when threshed the grain of a common\r\nvariety of oat carries the first layer of husk or chaff with it. Oats,\r\nas bought in the market, therefore, consist not only of the kernel or\r\ngrain but also of this outer, chaffy envelope. The magnitude of the\r\ncrop in the United States is very great, but only an inconsiderable\r\nproportion of the whole is used for human food, and this chiefly in\r\nsome form of oatmeal. The statistics of the crop grown in the United\r\nStates during 1906 are given in the following table:\r\n\r\n  Acreage,                    30,958,768\r\n  Yield per acre, bushels,            31.2\r\n  Total yield, bushels,      964,904,522\r\n  Price per bushel, cents,            31.7\r\n  Total value at farm,      $306,292,978\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ratio of Kernel to Hull.=--Numerous examinations of unhulled oats show\r\nthat the average percentage of kernel to hull for 100 parts is as 73 to\r\n27. In the oats grown in the western states the proportion of kernel is\r\nrelatively higher and in the southern states lower.\r\n\r\nIn the analytical process if the hull or chaff is ground with the\r\ngrain the proportion of fiber or crude cellulose is very considerably\r\nhigher than in the class of cereals ground without the chaff. The\r\nmean composition of unhulled kernels of oats of American growth is\r\nrepresented by the following table:\r\n\r\n  Weight of 100 unhulled grains,  2.92 grams\r\n  Moisture,                      10.06 percent\r\n  Protein,                       12.15    „\r\n  Ether extract,                  4.33    „\r\n  Crude fiber,                   12.07    „\r\n  Ash,                            3.46    „\r\n  Starch and sugar,              57.93    „\r\n\r\nA study of the above data shows that the flour of unhulled oats is rich\r\nin fat, fiber, and ash. The large percentage of fiber and ash is due to\r\na great degree to the composition of the hulls or chaff. The fat or\r\noil comes chiefly from the germ.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Composition of Hulled Oats.=--Inasmuch as the chaff is always\r\nseparated from the oat flour when the latter is to be used for human\r\nfood, the composition of the oat in the hulled state is of greater\r\nimportance to the present purpose than in the unhulled condition.\r\nThe means of 179 analyses show the hulled oats to have the following\r\ncompositions:\r\n\r\n  Moisture,           6.93 percent\r\n  Protein,           14.31    „\r\n  Ether extract,      8.14    „\r\n  Crude fiber,        1.38    „\r\n  Ash,                2.15    „\r\n  Starch and sugar,  67.09    „\r\n\r\nThe removal of the hulls, as is seen, and the partially dried condition\r\nof the grain in the above analysis increases the percentage of other\r\ningredients. The protein and fat are especially large in quantity.\r\nOatmeals may be regarded as the richest of the cereal flours, both in\r\nprotein and in oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Protein of Oat Kernels.=--There are three principal products in\r\nthe oat kernels characterized by their different degrees of solubility,\r\nnamely, protein soluble in alcohol, protein soluble in dilute salt\r\nsolution, and protein soluble in alkali. The protein soluble in alcohol\r\nconstitutes about 1.25 percent of the whole grain, the protein soluble\r\nin dilute salt solution about 1.5 percent, and the protein soluble in\r\nalkali the remainder, viz., 11.25 percent. The protein of oats has very\r\nlittle agglutinating power and, therefore, oat flour is not suitable\r\nfor making bread, or rather it is very little used for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Oat Products.=--As has been intimated before, the principal oat\r\nproducts, as far as food is concerned, are the various forms of oatmeal\r\ncommonly classed as breakfast foods. These products are prepared in\r\nvarious forms of agglutination and physical texture but if made from\r\ngenuine oats, as there is little cause for doubt, they have essentially\r\nthe same composition and nutritive power. It is doubtful if there is\r\nany preparation of oatmeal any more nutritious or palatable than the\r\nplain oat grain properly cooked. The forms in which the oat products\r\nare offered to the public are perhaps more convenient for use and in\r\nsome cases by reason of heating and preparation require less trouble,\r\nbut otherwise they apparently have no advantage over the simple product.\r\n\r\nThe mean composition of a number of oat flour products is shown in the\r\nfollowing table:\r\n\r\n  Moisture,           7.66 percent\r\n  Protein,           15.48    „\r\n  Ether extract,      7.46    „\r\n  Crude fiber,        1.20    „\r\n  Ash,                1.29    „\r\n  Starch and sugar,  67.61    „\r\n\r\nIn the dry substance:\r\n\r\n  Protein,              16.77 percent\r\n  Ether extract,         8.08    „\r\n  Crude fiber,           1.38    „\r\n  Ash,                   1.94    „\r\n  Starch and sugar,     73.20    „\r\n  Calories,          4,875\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the above average analysis that the products\r\nexamined are made from the whole kernel without the removal of the germ\r\nbut with a very careful removal of the hull and bran. The composition\r\nof these products compares very favorably with the typical composition\r\nof the kernel itself. These data show the high nutritive value of these\r\noat products, both in respect of fat and protein.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--OAT STARCH. × 200.--(_Courtesy of Bureau of\r\nChemistry._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Adulterations.=--There are very few adulterations of oatmeal.\r\nFortunately the price of this cereal is such that the admixture of\r\nother cereals would not be profitable. Doubtless such admixtures have\r\noften been made but evidently, from the examination of the products\r\nupon the open market, they are not very frequent. The characteristic\r\nappearance of oat starch is shown in Fig. 29.\r\n\r\nOat starch grains average about 10 microns in diameter. There are\r\nusually present some grains of somewhat oval shape, which assist in\r\nidentifying oat products when present. The starch granules also have\r\na tendency to agglutinate into masses of varying size, as shown in the\r\nphotograph.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Detection of Adulterations.=--The adulteration of oatmeal with the\r\nflour of other cereals can easily be detected by the use of the\r\nmicroscope. Oat starch when highly magnified presents a peculiar\r\ncellular structure of pentagonal character which might be compared\r\nto the effect produced by grinding a large number of faces upon a\r\nprecious stone. This peculiar appearance is caused by the tendency of\r\nthe starch granules in oats to become compacted in large masses. The\r\nappearance of the separate granules and also the compact aggregate\r\nare shown in the figure on the preceding page. The large aggregated\r\nmasses are of different sizes, ranging from .02 to 1.2 millimeters in\r\nlength. These masses are usually broken up by grinding or pressure and,\r\ntherefore, are not found in very great abundance in the commercial\r\noatmeal. When separated into single granules these are found to be\r\nirregular in outline, due to the compression to which they have been\r\nsubjected, more or less pentagonal in structure, and from .015 to .02\r\nmillimeter in diameter. The starch granules do not show any very marked\r\ncharacteristics under polarized light and have neither lines nor hilum.\r\nThe above statements can easily be verified by any one who can operate\r\nan ordinary microscope, but before attempting to detect adulteration a\r\ncareful examination of starch granules, prepared by the investigator\r\nhimself, should be made.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICE (_Oryza sativa_).\r\n\r\nRice is one of the most important food cereals. It furnishes a large\r\npart of the food of the inhabitants of China and Japan. It is a food\r\nrich in starch and poor in protein, and furnishes, therefore, heat and\r\nenergy, and is well adapted for the nourishment of those engaged in\r\nhard labor or who undergo extreme physical exertion. The cultivation of\r\nrice is rapidly extending in the United States, especially in Louisiana\r\nand Texas. The statistical data relating to the rice crop for 1906 are\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  Acreage,              575,014   acres\r\n  Production,        17,854,768   bushels\r\n  Yield per acre,            31.1   „\r\n  Price per bushel,          90.3 cents\r\n  Total value,       16,121,298   dollars\r\n\r\nThe adulteration of rice is confined to coating it with talc,\r\nparaffin, and glucose. The object of this treatment is to give a\r\nbetter appearance to the grain and to protect it from the ravages of\r\ninsects. The use of indigestible substances such as talc and paraffin\r\nis scarcely justifiable. The starch granules of rice have distinctive\r\nproperties which enable them to be readily recognized under the\r\nmicroscope, as shown in Fig. 30.\r\n\r\nThe rice starch grains are polygonal in form and have sharp angles.\r\nThe grains vary in size from 2 to 10 microns, though the latter size\r\nis seldom reached, the most of the grains being about 6 microns. The\r\nhilum is seldom visible. The grains occur in the rice kernels mostly in\r\ngroups of a considerable number of the individual grains forming starch\r\nmasses of ovoid or angular form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--RICE STARCH. × 200.--(_Courtesy of Bureau of\r\nChemistry._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nRYE.\r\n\r\nThis is the source of the principal supply of bread in many European\r\ncountries, but is not extensively used in the United States except\r\namong our citizens of foreign birth. It is also extensively used for\r\nmaking whisky. Rye belongs to the genus _Secale_. Only one species\r\n(_Secale cereale_ L.) is commonly cultivated, but this species has\r\na great many different varieties or races. According to the time of\r\nsowing there are two great classes of rye, namely, that planted in the\r\nautumn or early winter and that planted in the early spring, generally\r\nknown respectively as winter and spring rye. This is one of the\r\nhardiest of cereals, and grows well in all locations where wheat and\r\nother common cereals flourish. The area planted in rye in the United\r\nStates in 1906 and the quantity harvested are given in the following\r\ntable:\r\n\r\n  Acreage,            2,001,904\r\n  Yield per acre,            16.7 bushels\r\n  Production,        33,374,833     „\r\n  Price per bushel,          58.9 cents\r\n  Total value,       19,671,243   dollars\r\n\r\n\r\n=Composition of Rye.=--From a study of many hundreds of analyses of rye\r\nof American origin the following table may be given as approximating\r\nthe composition of a typical American rye:\r\n\r\n  Weight of 100 kernels,   2.50 grams\r\n  Moisture,               10.50 percent\r\n  Ether extract,           1.50    „\r\n  Protein,                12.25    „\r\n  Fiber,                   2.10    „\r\n  Starch and sugar,       71.75    „\r\n  Ash,                     1.90    „\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--RYE STARCH. × 200.--(_Courtesy of Bureau of\r\nChemistry._)]\r\n\r\nThe percentage of moisture in American grown rye is usually less than\r\nthat of European origin. The American rye, also, has smaller kernels\r\nas a rule than that of foreign growth. In the content of protein the\r\nAmerican samples of rye are fully equivalent to those of foreign\r\norigin, and in their mean composition, except as noted above, do not\r\ndiffer greatly from that of standard varieties collected abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Protein of Rye.=--As is the case with other cereals more than one\r\nnitrogenous constituent exists in the rye. Three of the principal\r\nones have been separated and named as follows: leucosin, gliadin,\r\nand edestin. Other proteins belonging to the globulin, albumin, and\r\nproteose family are also found in small proportions. The gliadin of\r\nrye resembles in its chemical and physical properties the gliadin of\r\nwheat. There is, however, in the rye no protein compound corresponding\r\nto the glutenin of wheat, and, therefore, rye flour does not form a\r\ngluten similar in quality to that of wheat, although it comes more\r\nnearly doing so than any other cereal. The gliadin of rye is soluble in\r\nalcohol, the leucosin of rye is soluble in water, and the edestin is\r\nsoluble in a salt solution.\r\n\r\nIn a typical sample of American rye there will be found about 5.16\r\npercent of gliadin, 2.27 percent of edestin and proteose, 0.55 percent\r\nof leucosin, and 3.14 percent of protein soluble in salt solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Adulteration of Rye Flour.=--Rye flour is frequently adulterated\r\nby the admixture of flours of other cereals. Real rye flour is\r\ndistinguished by the character of the starch granules, as shown in Fig.\r\n31.\r\n\r\nRye starch grains are lenticular in form, and the largest grains are\r\nof about 50 microns diameter. They average somewhat larger than wheat\r\nstarch grains and are characterized by many of the large grains having\r\na fissure in the form of a slit, cross, or star, which is rare in wheat\r\nand barley. The rings and hilum are indistinctly seen in some of the\r\ngrains.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Rye Bread.=--This bread may be made leavened or unleavened, since the\r\nanalogy in the property of its protein to that of wheat renders the\r\nleavening of rye bread somewhat more easy of accomplishment than that\r\nof the other cereals, with the exception of wheat.\r\n\r\nRye bread made of pure rye flour has a dark color, sometimes almost\r\nblack. It is often baked long in advance of the time of eating and\r\nkeeps well, is highly nutritious, and is the staple bread of many\r\nEuropean countries.\r\n\r\nA partial rye flour bread is made by mixing rye flour with other\r\nflours, such as wheat, barley, Indian corn, etc., and this is the kind\r\nwhich is commonly used in this country and in many portions of Europe\r\nwhere the light-colored breads are preferred to the dark.\r\n\r\nThe large consumption of bread made from rye and Indian corn indicates\r\nthat even if the supply of wheat should become limited there is no\r\nreason to fear a famine of bread. It would be easy to substitute bread\r\nmade wholly or in part of Indian corn and rye for that made wholly of\r\nwheat and thus to supply practically any demand for bread which the\r\nincreasing population of the earth may make.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEAT (GENUS _Triticum_).\r\n\r\nIn respect of human nutrition wheat is the most important of the\r\ncereals. It is grown in the temperate regions of almost every country,\r\nbut does not flourish in tropical or subtropical countries.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the wheat is divided in respect of the period of\r\nits growth into two great classes, namely, winter or fall planted wheat\r\nand spring or spring planted wheat. Winter wheat is usually planted\r\nfrom September to November and spring wheat from the last of March to\r\nthe last of April.\r\n\r\nIn this country wheat is not cultivated, that is, there is no\r\ncultivation of the soil after seeding. The soil is, however, plowed and\r\nharrowed before planting. In the winter wheat regions the harvesting\r\nis in the month of June, though in the southern localities it comes\r\nsomewhat earlier and in the more northern localities may extend into\r\nJuly. In the spring wheat regions the harvesting is from the last of\r\nJuly to the middle or end of August. The statistics of wheat grown in\r\nthe United States during 1906 are as follows:\r\n\r\n                                 WINTER.         SPRING.\r\n  Acreage,                     29,599,961      17,705,868\r\n  Yield per acre (bushels),            16.7            13.7\r\n  Total yield (bushels),      492,888,004     242,372,966\r\n  Total value at farm,       $336,435,081    $153,897,679\r\n  Price per bushel (cents),            68.3            63.5\r\n\r\nAll the different varieties of wheat which are now known are\r\ncultivated. The simplest form, namely, the one grain wheat is the only\r\none which grows wild, and the origin of the other varieties of wheat is\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nBotanists recognize three species, namely--Species 1, one grain wheat\r\n(_Triticum monococcum_ Lam.); species 2, Polish wheat (_Triticum\r\npolonicum_ L.); species 3, common wheat (_Triticum sativum_ Lam.). All\r\nof these species are distinct, especially the third one, of which the\r\nmost valuable variety is the common wheat, _Triticum vulgare_ Vill.\r\n\r\nThe quality and properties of wheat depend more upon the environment\r\nin which it is grown than upon the species to which it belongs. There\r\nis perhaps no other field crop in which the environment, namely,\r\ncondition of the soil, temperature, precipitation, etc., makes a\r\ngreater difference than in wheat. In general, the environment and the\r\nspecies together produce two kinds of wheat as far as milling and bread\r\nmaking are concerned, namely, the soft or starchy wheat and the hard or\r\nglutinous wheat. In the first variety there is a larger percentage of\r\nstarch in relation to the content or protein matter than in the second.\r\nTaking the wheat as a whole its average composition is shown in the\r\nfollowing table:\r\n\r\n  Weight of 100 kernels,                  3.85 grams\r\n  Moisture,                              10.60 percent\r\n  Protein,                               12.25    „\r\n  Ether extract,                          1.75    „\r\n  Crude fiber,                            2.40    „\r\n  Ash,                                    1.75    „\r\n  Carbohydrates other than crude fiber,  71.25    „\r\n  Dry gluten,                            10.25    „\r\n  Moist gluten,                          26.50    „\r\n\r\nIn regard to protein American wheat, as a rule, is quite equal to\r\nthat of foreign origin. This is an important characteristic when it\r\nis remembered that both the milling and food value of a wheat depend\r\nlargely upon the nitrogenous matter which is present. It must not be\r\nforgotten, however, that merely a good percentage of protein is not of\r\nitself a sure indication of the milling value of a wheat. The ratio\r\nof gluten to the other protein constituents in a wheat is not always\r\nconstant, but it is the gluten content of a flour on which the bread\r\nmaking qualities chiefly depend.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Gluten.=--The principal part of the protein in wheat is known as\r\ngluten. Gluten as such does not exist in the wheat but is formed when\r\nthe pulverized wheat, that is, the wheat flour, is mixed with water\r\nby the union of two elements in the wheat, namely, gliadin, which is\r\nsoluble in dilute alcohol and forms nearly half of the whole protein\r\nmatter of the wheat kernel, and glutenin, a compound insoluble in\r\nwater, dilute salt solutions, and dilute alcohol and which is quite as\r\nabundant as gliadin in the wheat kernel. In fact, the gliadin and the\r\nglutenin together make the whole of the protein, except a little over\r\none per cent.\r\n\r\nThere are three other forms of protein, as pointed out by Osborne,\r\nin the wheat kernel, making altogether nearly 1¹⁄₂ percent of total\r\nprotein content. The average quantity of these compounds in the protein\r\nof wheat is as follows.\r\n\r\nConstituents:\r\n\r\n  Globulin,   0.70 percent\r\n  Albumin,    0.40    „\r\n  Proteose,   0.30    „\r\n  Gliadin,    4.25    „\r\n  Glutenin,   4.35    „\r\n             -----\r\n             10.00\r\n\r\n\r\n=Starch in the Wheat Kernel.=--The most abundant constituent of the\r\nwheat kernel is the starch. The appearance of wheat starch is shown in\r\nthe figure. Wheat starch grains ordinarily show the rings and hilum in\r\na few cases only under the most favorable conditions, though there are\r\nsometimes cases where the striations are quite distinct. The granules\r\nof starch vary greatly in size, being from 5 to 10 microns in diameter.\r\nThere are, in fact, two kinds of granules in wheat starch, one having\r\nthe appearance under the microscope of irregularly rounded particles\r\nin sections like a circular disk, and the other of elongated particles\r\nwith a distinct hilum, as shown in Fig. 32. The appearance of the\r\ngranules under polarized light is shown in Fig. 33.\r\n\r\nWheat starch is not very commonly used for commercial purposes but is\r\nhighly prized for some things, especially in the sizing of textile\r\nfabrics. The germ in wheat is particularly rich in oil and the bran or\r\noutside covering in protein. The common idea that the bran is composed\r\nmostly of silicious matter is wholly erroneous. On the contrary the\r\nbran is a highly nutritious food, and the objection to it for human\r\nfood is mostly of a mechanical nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Adulterations.=--Wheat grains are never adulterated but they may\r\nsometimes contain dirt and foreign seeds, due to the growth of some\r\nbody in connection with the wheat itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Standards.=--Wheat, commercially, is sold under three standards,\r\nnamely, one, two, three. The difference is an arbitrary one and not\r\nfounded upon any chemical data but wholly upon the physical appearance,\r\ndegree of moisture, and freedom from extraneous admixtures.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Wheat Products.=--The principal product of wheat is flour. The\r\nmilling process for wheat is highly interesting both from a chemical\r\nand technical point of view, but cannot be described in full in this\r\nmanual. The old-fashioned milling of wheat, namely, pressing between\r\nstones and separation of the flour by bolting has been almost entirely\r\nsuperseded by the modern milling with metal rollers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--WHEAT STARCH. × 200.--(_Courtesy of Bureau of\r\nChemistry._)]\r\n\r\nAltogether nearly a hundred different products are made incident or\r\nfinal to the milling of wheat. Only those products, however, which are\r\nused for human food interest us at the present time.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Chief Varieties of Flour.=--The highest grade of wheat flour is known\r\nusually by the term “patent”; a lower grade is known as “bakers’ flour”\r\nand a third as low grade flour. A barrel of flour weighs 196 pounds\r\nand requires about 258 pounds of wheat for its manufacture. The whole\r\nproduct from the 258.35 pounds of wheat is shown in the appended table.\r\n\r\nIn general it may be said that about 75 percent of the weight of the\r\nwheat is obtained as merchantable flour of some kind, about 60 to 70\r\npercent being good grade or straight flour. About 24 percent of the\r\nweight of the wheat is obtained as cattle food and about 1 percent is\r\nlost during the process of manufacture.\r\n\r\n  PRODUCT.         POUNDS.

The name,\r\ntherefore, should be applied to all flour made from well grained\r\nwheat, ground, and unbolted. Most of the flours however, which are\r\nsold nowadays as graham flours are produced by a more or less perfect\r\nbolting process. From the above it is seen that true graham flour will\r\ncontain practically the same constituents as the wheat kernel itself\r\nand in the same proportion and have the same composition as wheat.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Entire Wheat Flour._--This name would naturally carry the idea of\r\na flour corresponding to the graham flour above mentioned. It is,\r\nhowever, a misnamed trade-mark for a flour produced in a special manner\r\nwhich consists in the removal of the outer or purely branny covering\r\nof the grain. “Entire wheat” flour, therefore, contains all the\r\ningredients of wheat grains, save those which are found in the outer\r\nbranny covering.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gluten Flour._--This is a name applied to a flour which is produced\r\nby removing the greater part of the starch from ordinary flour. It is\r\nespecially recommended for the use of diabetic patients. Unfortunately,\r\nthe name is very commonly applied to flours made from wheat containing\r\na little higher percentage of protein than the ordinary and sometimes\r\neven to an ordinary wheat flour. Its use with such a product is purely\r\nfraudulent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mixed Flour._--The act of Congress of June 13, 1898, defines mixed\r\nflour and imposes a tax upon the manufacture, sale, importation, and\r\nexportation of that article. The maximum tax laid upon mixed flour is 4\r\ncents on a barrel of 196 pounds. The total number of barrels of mixed\r\nflour returned for taxation for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1905,\r\nwas 362; half barrels, 59,443; quarter barrels, 6,265; eighth barrels,\r\n24,974. The total quantity of mixed flour returned for taxation during\r\nthe year is 5,495,937 pounds. The above data show that the amount of\r\nmixed flour offered for sale is a very small part of the total flour\r\nmanufactured in the United States. It may be that there is a great\r\ndeal of flour mixed and sold in violation of the law since it is\r\nquite impossible in the inspection of the stores to supervise all the\r\ntransactions of business deals in flour; especially is it believed that\r\nrye flour and buckwheat flour are often adulterated by mixing with\r\nthem the flour of other cereals. This adulteration is not one which is\r\nat all injurious to health but is simply practiced for the purpose of\r\nmaking a rye or buckwheat flour look whiter or because the added flours\r\nare cheaper than the real rye or buckwheat.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Properties Affecting the Commercial Value of Flour.=--Aside from its\r\nnutritive properties wheat flour has a commercial value depending\r\nupon its color and texture and upon the gluten which it contains. The\r\ncharacter of gluten also varies largely in different varieties of wheat\r\nand in wheat grown in different localities. A chemical examination\r\nwill not always tell the bread making properties of a flour, and the\r\ncharacter of the bread itself depends often quite as much upon the\r\nskill of the baker as upon the flour which is used.\r\n\r\nIn cases where loaves are sold by weight, a flour with a high\r\npercentage of tenacious gluten is often preferred, since it permits of\r\nthe forming of loaves containing a maximum percentage of water. With a\r\nflour rich in gluten it is not difficult to make a palatable loaf which\r\ndoes not bear any evidence of an excess of water, containing as much\r\nas 40 percent of moisture. The baking of bread is an art which is most\r\nsuccessfully practiced by professionals, and the American method of\r\nhome bread making does not always lead to the happiest results.\r\n\r\nThe ideal flour for bread making is one which contains a sufficient\r\nquantity of gluten to make a porous and spongy loaf, but not one which\r\npermits an excessive quantity of moisture to be incorporated in the\r\nloaf itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Average Composition of Different Varieties of Flour.=--Analyses of a\r\ngreat number of samples of different varieties of flours lead to the\r\nfollowing data, which may be accepted as a very close approximation\r\nof the average variety of different grades of flour offered upon the\r\nAmerican market:\r\n\r\n  -------------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n                           |        |   PRO- |   PRO- |        |\r\n                           |        |  TEIDS |  TEIDS |        |\r\n                           |  MOIS- |   N ×  |   N ×  |  MOIST |\r\n        NAME OF FLOUR.     |  TURE. |  6.25. |  5.70. | GLUTEN.|\r\n  -------------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n                           |_Perct._|_Perct._|_Perct._|_Perct._|\r\n  Patent flour,            |  12.77 |  10.55 |   9.62 |  25.97 |\r\n  Bakers’ and family flour,|  11.69 |  12.28 |  11.20 |  34.70 |\r\n  Common market flour,     |  12.28 |  10.18 |   9.28 |  24.55 |\r\n  Miscellaneous flour,     |  12.73 |  10.45 |   9.52 |  26.80 |\r\n  Self-raising flour,      |  11.45 |   9.75 |   8.89 |  26.97 |\r\n  Gluten flour,            |  12.99 |  13.30 |  12.13 |  39.68 |\r\n  -------------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n\r\n  -------------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n                           |        |        |        | STARCH |\r\n                           |        |        |        |  N ×   |\r\n                           |   DRY  |        |        | 6.25.  |\r\n        NAME OF FLOUR.     | GLUTEN.|  OIL.  |  ASH.  |  [26]  |\r\n  -------------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n                           |_Perct._|_Perct._|_Perct._|_Perct._|\r\n  Patent flour,            |   9.99 |   1.02 |   0.44 |  74.76 |\r\n  Bakers’ and family flour,|  13.07 |   1.30 |   0.57 |  73.87 |\r\n  Common market flour,     |   9.21 |   1.30 |   0.61 |  75.63 |\r\n  Miscellaneous flour,     |  10.22 |   1.08 |   0.49 |  75.23 |\r\n  Self-raising flour,      |   9.65 |   0.70 |   4.45 |  73.66 |\r\n  Gluten flour,            |  14.84 |   1.05 |   0.55 |  72.11 |\r\n  -------------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n\r\n  -------------------------+--------+--------+-------\r\n                           | STARCH |        |\r\n                           |  N ×   |        |\r\n                           | 5.70.  |  CRUDE | CALO-\r\n        NAME OF FLOUR.     |  [26]  | FIBER. | RIES.\r\n  -------------------------+--------+--------+-------\r\n                           |_Perct._|_Perct._|\r\n  Patent flour,            |  76.14 |   0.21 |3,858.0\r\n  Bakers’ and family flour,|  74.98 |   0.22 |3,929.6\r\n  Common market flour,     |  76.53 |   0.28 |3,882.5\r\n  Miscellaneous flour,     |  76.15 |   0.25 |3,846.3\r\n  Self-raising flour,      |  74.51 |   0.21 |3,719.3\r\n  Gluten flour,            |  73.28 |   0.32 |3,891.1\r\n  -------------------------+--------+--------+-------\r\n\r\n  [26] In the first of these columns the starch is calculated by\r\n  difference, assuming the protein to be the quantity of nitrogen\r\n  present multiplied by 6.25, and in the second column the figure is\r\n  obtained in the same way, using 5.70 as the protein factor.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Separation of Gluten.=--The character of a wheat flour, as has already\r\nbeen intimated, is measured largely by the quantity of gluten which\r\nit may contain. The separation of gluten may be accomplished by any\r\none, even without a chemical training, by a little practice. It is,\r\ntherefore, one of the tests for the value of a wheat flour which can be\r\neasily and generally applied. The principle of separation of the gluten\r\nrests upon the fact that when wheat flour is moistened and kneaded into\r\na sticky mass it may be washed with pure water with constant kneading\r\nuntil nearly all the starch has been removed from the mass. Meanwhile\r\nonly that portion of the protein is removed which is soluble in the\r\nwater and the gluten which is formed by the process of kneading remains\r\nas a sticky mass. When this moist mass is kneaded and rolled until all\r\nthe moisture is taken out of it that can be removed in this way, it may\r\nbe weighed and the proportion of moist gluten in the sample determined.\r\nIt may then be placed in an oven and dried, and then the proportion\r\nof dry gluten secured. The following method is one which is easily\r\napplied. Place 10 grams of the sample in a porcelain dish and moisten\r\nwith from 6 to 7 cubic centimeters of water, knead, and allow to stand\r\nfor an hour. Work into a ball, being careful that none of the material\r\nadheres to the dish. Holding the mass in the hand knead it in a slow\r\nstream of cold water until the starch and all soluble matter are washed\r\nout. Place the ball of gluten thus formed in cold water and allow to\r\nstand for one hour; remove from water, press as dry as possible between\r\nthe hands, roll into a ball, and weigh in a flat-bottomed dish. After\r\nweighing, place the ball of moist gluten in the drying oven for twenty\r\nhours; cool and weigh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--KEDZIE’S FARINOMETER SHOWING THE\r\nPARTS.--(_Bulletin 13, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Gluten Tester.=--A simple test for determining the approximate\r\npercentage of gluten in flour may be used, based upon the principle\r\nthat the viscosity of dough is a measure of its practical gluten\r\ncontent. The name applied to a gluten tester is farinometer.\r\n\r\nA convenient form of farinometer devised by Kedzie is shown in the\r\naccompanying figure. It is patterned somewhat upon the plan of Jago’s\r\nviscometer. The instrument is shown in parts in Fig. 34. The instrument\r\nas in use is exhibited in Fig. 35. Parts shown in Fig. 34 are as\r\nfollows: No. 1 is the stand or support of the parts. No. 2 is the cap\r\nof No. 1, and discloses the half-inch opening (half closed by the\r\nslide) through which the dough is forced by the pressure of the rod No.\r\n4. The slide by which this opening is closed is plainly shown; also\r\nthe socket for holding No. 3. No. 3 is a brass tube 3 inches high and\r\n1 inch internal diameter, with a small knob to fit into the notched\r\nopening in the side of the socket seen in No. 2, to hold No. 3 firmly\r\nin place. No. 4 is a steel rod ¹⁵⁄₁₆ inch in diameter and 12 inches\r\nlong, with a thin brass cap 1 inch in diameter, beveled slightly so\r\nthat the front edge fills the barrel of No. 3 without friction, and is\r\nyet dough-tight. Near the top the rod is marked into inch spaces.\r\n\r\nIn using the farinometer two points are considered:\r\n\r\n1. The water-absorbing power of a flour, or the percentage of water it\r\nwill take up to form a dough of a certain consistency.\r\n\r\n2. The viscosity of such dough, or its resistance to change of form\r\nunder a uniform force; _e. g._, the length of time in seconds required\r\nto force a cylinder of dough 1 inch high through a hole one-half inch\r\nin diameter under the pressure of a vertical steel rod 13 inches long\r\nand weighing 2¹⁄₂ pounds avoirdupois.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--KEDZIE’S FARINOMETER IN USE.--(_Bulletin 13,\r\nU. S. Dept. of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bleaching of Flour.=--At the present time flour is extensively\r\nbleached for the purpose of making an inferior article resemble a\r\nsuperior one. By this means a greater percentage of the flour produced\r\ncan be rated as of first quality. Ozone and oxids of nitrogen developed\r\nby electrical discharges are the principal bleaching agents employed.\r\nBleached flour should bear a label indicating to the purchaser the\r\ncharacter of the manipulation to which it has been subjected.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Adulterations of Flour.=--The adulteration of wheat flour is not\r\npracticed to any extent in this country. The most common adulteration\r\narises from grinding with wheat foreign seeds and other foreign\r\nmatter, rust, smut, etc., which may be present in the grain. Other\r\nadulterations are the mixture with wheat flour of the starch or\r\nflour of maize and other cereals. The adulteration with any form of\r\nterra alba or white powdered earthy substance is exceedingly rare.\r\nAlthough some attempts have been made to introduce such adulterations\r\nin this country they have not reached any commercial success. The\r\nadulterations, with the exception of those with white earthy powders,\r\nare most readily ascertained by microscopic examination for foreign\r\nmatters and other varieties of starch than grow naturally in the wheat.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Standard.=--The United States standard for flour is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n=Flour= is the fine, sound product made by bolting wheat meal and\r\ncontains not more than thirteen and one-half (13.5) percent of\r\nmoisture, not less than one and twenty-five hundredths (1.25) percent\r\nof nitrogen, not more than one (1.0) percent of ash, and not more than\r\nfifty hundredths (0.50) percent of fiber.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Graham flour= is unbolted wheat meal.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Whole wheat flour=, entire =wheat= flour, improperly so called, is\r\nfine wheat meal from which a part of the bran has been removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Gluten flour= is the product made from flour by the removal of starch,\r\nand contains not less than five and six-tenths (5.6) percent of\r\nnitrogen and not more than ten (10) percent of moisture.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Age of Flour.=--The freshly ground flour is most highly esteemed by\r\nmany consumers on account of palatability and freedom from all danger\r\nof mold and ferments. Older flours are likely to lose flavor, become\r\nmoldy and infested with weavil and other insect pests. The last-named\r\nevils are avoided by the use of wheat containing no fungus, none of the\r\neggs of the weavil, nor of other insects, and enclosing the freshly\r\nground flour in packages not accessible to infection. Even then it\r\nis advisable to consume the flour as soon as convenient after the\r\nmilling process. Many manufacturers and experts contend that flour is\r\nimproved by keeping for a certain length of time, and this contention\r\nis based on the assumption that the flour assumes a lighter color and\r\nimproves in flavor on keeping. There is of course a certain limit to\r\nimprovements of this kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Substitutes for Flour.=--Wholesome ingredients are used in part\r\ninstead of flour in bread making, and when that fact is clearly made\r\nknown the admixture of these substances with flour is not considered\r\nan adulteration. Bread which is made of an admixture of Indian corn\r\nmeal with flour or rye flour with flour or other cereal products is\r\nwell liked by many people. Potatoes are also used very often in bread\r\nmaking. Acorns, buckwheat, and other farinacious and oily substances\r\nare also employed. The admixture of inert substances with flour merely\r\nto increase the bulk and weight of the loaf, even if notified, cannot\r\nbe regarded as other than an adulteration.\r\n\r\nIn times of famine such admixtures are sometimes made in order to\r\nincrease the size and weight of the loaf. Such substances are known\r\nin times of famine as “hunger bread.” Finely ground straw, bark, the\r\nhulls of nuts, etc., are often used for this purpose. These bodies\r\npractically have no nutritive value and serve no useful purpose except\r\nto deceive the eater respecting the quantity of bread he consumes.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREAD.\r\n\r\nThe term “Bread” when used alone is understood in this country to apply\r\nto bread made from wheat flour or some form of wheat. If made from\r\nother cereals a prefix is used to distinguish this fact, as Indian\r\ncorn bread, rye bread, etc. The term bread includes also the materials\r\nwhich are used necessarily therewith in the ordinary process of baking.\r\nThus, the term bread would apply to a loaf which contains not only\r\nthe wheat flour as the base and chief part of its mass but also the\r\nyeast or other leavening agent employed, together with salt, lard, or\r\nbutter used in its preparation. The presence of these bodies, used in\r\nthe sense above described, is not regarded as an adulteration. The\r\nterm “bread,” however, is not to be used to include those other forms\r\nof nutriment made from wheat flour in which condimental substances,\r\nespecially sugar, are used to such an extent as to give the dominant\r\ntaste of the condiment or condiments employed. Thus, the ordinary cake\r\nof all descriptions, tarts, puddings, and other edible substances made\r\nlargely from wheat flour, but to which the condiment or condiments\r\nimpart a distinct taste, are not included under the term bread.\r\n\r\nIn the generic sense the term bread may be used in the largest\r\nsignification to signify food in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Varieties of Bread.=--In general all forms of bread may be divided\r\ninto two great classes, leavened and unleavened. By far, the greater\r\nquantity of bread consumed belongs to the former class. Unleavened\r\nbread is used chiefly for certain religious festivals, in the form\r\nof biscuits or in certain varieties of Indian corn bread such as hoe\r\ncake, johnnie cake, etc. Of the leavened bread there are two distinct\r\nclasses, namely, bread which is baked and eaten cold and bread which\r\nis consumed hot from the oven. Bread intended to be consumed cold is\r\ngenerally eaten within twenty-four or forty-eight hours from the time\r\nof making though some varieties may be kept for an indefinite period.\r\nThe use of hot bread is not commended by hygienists though it is\r\ndifficult to see why, when properly made, the consumption of a good hot\r\nroll can be regarded as injurious. The apparent injury which may result\r\ntherefrom is probably due to the larger quantity eaten on account of\r\ngreater palatability than is the case with cold bread. That variety\r\nof bread which is baked so as to present a maximum of crust and made\r\nof flour which gives a tough consistency to the loaf is most highly\r\nregarded both for palatability and nutritive purposes. This form of\r\nbread is improperly called French or Vienna rolls in this country.\r\n\r\nUnleavened bread is particularly advisable for use in emergency rations\r\nfor marching soldiers, in logging camps, etc. This bread is compact,\r\ncomparatively free of moisture and has a high nutritive value. The\r\nleavened bread may be divided into distinct classes in respect of the\r\nleavening agent employed.\r\n\r\nClass 1 is bread in which the leavening agent is yeast. Class 2 is\r\nbread in which the natural ferments residing in the flour or wheat are\r\nutilized for the leavening agent as in the making of that variety known\r\nas salt rising bread. Class 3 includes that form of bread in which the\r\nleavening is secured by chemical reagents mixed with the dough. Class\r\n4 includes that variety in which a leavening reagent such as carbon\r\ndioxid or air is mechanically incorporated with the dough during the\r\nkneading process.\r\n\r\nUnleavened bread is also divided into several technical forms. The\r\nfirst class includes the biscuit of commerce, sometimes incorrectly\r\ncalled crackers, and intended to be used soon after preparation. The\r\nsecond class includes biscuits which are intended for long storage\r\nand transportation. The third class includes wafers and other\r\ndelicate forms of unleavened bread for special use. Class 4 is the\r\nunleavened loaves which are made most frequently from Indian corn\r\nmeal and intended to be eaten while still hot. Class 5 includes any\r\nmiscellaneous unleavened loaves or cakes made in various ways and for\r\ndifferent purposes.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all forms of unleavened bread made from wheat flour the dough\r\nis thoroughly beaten, and mechanically mixed or kneaded, in order to\r\nmake it lighter in color and more crisp and hard after baking.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Yeast.=--Bakers’ yeast is one form of the ordinary yeast ferments\r\nor a mixture thereof producing alcoholic fermentation under proper\r\nconditions. All flour contains a certain quantity of sugar which is\r\neasily fermented. By the action of the yeast upon this sugar carbon\r\ndioxid and alcohol are formed. The particles of carbon dioxid become\r\nentangled in the gluten of the wheat flour when it is mixed into a\r\ndough and thus make the mass spongy and light. When placed in the oven\r\nto be baked these minute particles of carbon dioxid expand still more\r\nand produce additional lightness and sponginess of the loaf. The yeast\r\nmay be propagated from one mass of dough to another, may be used in a\r\nmoist state or, as is very commonly the case, manufactured in large\r\nquantities, and sold either moist or more commonly in a partially dried\r\nand pressed cake.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Spontaneous Ferments.=--All cereals contain ferments of a character to\r\nproduce alcoholic fermentation spontaneously under proper conditions.\r\nIt is possible even to ferment dough by seed from one loaf to another\r\nor by developing a spontaneous fermentation. This method is quite a\r\ncommon one in the rural districts, and all bread made in this way is\r\nknown as salt rising bread. It may be made according to the following\r\nreceipt:\r\n\r\nA quarter of a pint of fresh whole milk is slowly heated to near the\r\nboiling point, but not allowed to boil. This process will sterilize the\r\nmilk and prevent the development of a too rapid lactic fermentation\r\nin the subsequent processes. The heated milk is added to a quantity\r\nof maize meal sufficient to make with the milk a stiff batter, and\r\nthe whole is thoroughly mixed. The vessel containing the batter is\r\nwrapped with paper and then with a heavy flannel cloth, and kept in a\r\nwarm place at a uniform temperature of about blood heat for several\r\nhours, until fermentation is fully established and the batter assumes\r\na definite sour odor. At this point a teaspoonful of salt is stirred\r\ninto a pint of blood-warm water and into this a sufficient quantity of\r\nhigh-grade wheat flour is stirred to make a moderately stiff batter.\r\nThis is thoroughly mixed with the sour mass obtained by the previous\r\nfermentation and the mixture exposed for from three-fourths to one\r\nhour to a blood heat as before. If the fermentation has been well\r\nconducted the mass will now be in a sufficiently active state to secure\r\na proper porosity of the loaf. The salt rising thus prepared is mixed\r\nwith a wheat flour dough made with warm water in sufficient quantities\r\nto make from four to six loaves, the whole mass well kneaded, molded\r\ninto loaves and put aside at a temperature of blood heat until the\r\nfermentation has proceeded far enough to make the loaf light and\r\nspongy. The loaf is then baked in the ordinary way.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Chemical Aerating Agents.=--In this country a very common method of\r\naerating bread is practiced, based upon the use of certain chemical\r\nreagents which when mixed in the dough set free carbon dioxid. These\r\nreagents are known as baking or yeast powders and are especially prized\r\nby reason of the fact that it is possible with their aid to prepare\r\nin a few moments a light spongy loaf or roll which would require from\r\n10 to 24 hours to make by the ordinary fermenting with yeast. The\r\nprincipal objection to the use of baking powder lies in the fact that\r\nthe residues arising from the chemical reaction are necessarily left in\r\nthe loaf. While these residues may not have any specific or poisonous\r\nproperties they increase the quantity of mineral matter in the bread,\r\nand this mineral matter is in the inorganic state and as such does not\r\ntake any part in the process of nutrition. It can only be regarded as a\r\nwaste product, burdening, to that extent, the excretory organs of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Constituents of Baking Powder.=--The essential constituents of baking\r\npowder are a carbonate of some kind and an acid reagent capable of\r\ndecomposing this carbonate and setting the carbon dioxid free. The\r\ncommon carbonate of a baking powder is bicarbonate of soda. The\r\nclassification of baking powders rests upon the acid elements which\r\nthey contain. They may be classified as follows: (1) Cream of tartar\r\nbaking powder, in which the acid constituent is cream of tartar\r\nwhich is known chemically as acid potassium tartrate. Other forms of\r\ntartaric acid may be used in baking powders of this class but they\r\nare not common. (2) Phosphate powders, in which the acid constituent\r\nis phosphoric acid usually in the form of the acid phosphate of lime.\r\n(3) Alum powders in which the acid constituent is alum or some form of\r\naluminium sulfate, usually the basic sulfate of alumina.\r\n\r\nThe acid and basic constituents of these powders may be kept in\r\nseparate containers and mixed together at the time of making the dough.\r\nA more common form is to use them in such a way that until they mix\r\nwith the dough they do not exert any notable effect upon each other.\r\nFor instance, perfectly dry bicarbonate of soda and perfectly dry acid\r\npotassium tartrate may be mixed together and kept for quite a while\r\nwithout any notable decomposition of the bicarbonate taking place.\r\n\r\nIn order to render any such possible action minimum in its effect it\r\nis customary to add to the mixture a small quantity of starch, milk\r\nsugar, or some other diluent. These materials tend to keep apart the\r\nparticles of acid and base and render it possible to make a mixture\r\nof them which may be kept for a long while without any notable loss\r\nof leavening power. When a cream of tartar baking powder is mixed\r\nwith dough the moisture of the dough gradually dissolves the two\r\ningredients and in this state a chemical reaction occurs between them.\r\nThe carbon dioxid is set free as a gas, commonly known as carbonic\r\nacid. The mineral substance which results is a tartrate of sodium and\r\npotassium that is a union of tartaric acid with potash and soda. This\r\ncompound is commonly known under the term of Rochelle salts. If there\r\nbe a sufficient quantity of water in the bread to allow the Rochelle\r\nsalts to crystallize in the usual way a portion of the water becomes\r\nincorporated with the salt. Two teaspoonsful of a tartrate baking\r\npowder leave a residue of about 11 grams (165 grains) of crystallized\r\nRochelle salts in the loaf.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Phosphate Powders.=--As has already been said, the acid constituent\r\nof phosphate powder is chiefly acid phosphate of lime. In this case\r\nthe acid phosphate of lime decomposes the bicarbonate of soda with\r\nthe production of carbon dioxid and leaves a residue consisting of\r\na mixture of sodium and lime phosphate. If in two teaspoonsful of\r\nphosphate powder there are approximately 16 grams (250 grains) there is\r\nformed a crystallized residue, about an equal weight of phosphate of\r\nsoda and lime, which is left in the loaf.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Alum Powders.=--Perhaps by far the largest part of baking powders used\r\ncontain alum in some form as the acid constituent. Formerly the common\r\nsubstance known as alum or burnt alum was employed but in late years an\r\naluminium basic salt known as basic sulfate of aluminium has largely\r\nsucceeded the old form of alum. When the reaction takes place in the\r\ndough between these two constituents of alum baking powder there\r\nis formed an equivalent quantity of sulfate of soda and hydroxid of\r\nalumina if the acid constituent be basic aluminium sulfate.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of residue left in the loaf if two teaspoonsful of baking\r\npowder be used is about 11 grams (165 grains).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Harmfulness of Baking Powder Residues.=--The question of the\r\nharmfulness of the residues left by the various forms of baking powder\r\nis one which has been of much interest to the hygienist and physician.\r\nIt is not claimed in any case that these residues are beneficial. The\r\nprincipal question which has been discussed is which of them is the\r\nleast harmful. This is a question which it is not proper to enter into\r\nin this manual. It might, however, not be out of place to say that the\r\nuse of chemical reagents for leavening bread is not as advisable as the\r\nuse of the ordinary fermentation. It would be better, evidently, if all\r\npeople used more yeast bread and less baking powder rolls. At the same\r\ntime the utility and convenience of baking powder cannot be denied, and\r\nthis is a factor which must be taken into consideration in the general\r\ndiscussion and final resolution of the question.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Character of Alum Residues.=--Every one is agreed that the substance\r\nknown as alum, namely, the sulfate of alumina in conjunction with\r\nanother mineral or base, such as soda, potash, or ammonia, is not\r\na desirable constituent of food products. In the manufacture of\r\nbaking powders containing alum an effort is made to so balance the\r\nconstituents that when the reaction is completed no undecomposed\r\nalum remains. If this condition is secured in every instance the\r\nmaterials which remain in the bread are not alum but the residues above\r\nmentioned, consisting of aluminium hydrate, and sulfates of soda,\r\npotash, or ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe residue of chief importance is the hydroxid or hydrate of\r\nalumina, which is the form in which the alumina itself should appear\r\nwhen a complete reaction like that defined above takes place. When\r\nthe hydroxid of alumina is dried and especially when ignited it is\r\nconverted into an oxid of alumina which is highly insoluble in water\r\nand only slightly soluble in a very dilute acid solution. The claim is\r\nmade by the manufacturer of alum powders that the aluminium residue\r\nwhich is formed is insoluble in the digestive juices and therefore\r\ncannot produce any effect usually ascribed to the soluble salts of\r\naluminium. It is important that the conditions which are found in the\r\nbaking of a loaf are such as to produce this highly desirable result.\r\nThe temperature of the interior of the loaf during baking does not rise\r\nmuch above that of boiling water, although the exterior temperature,\r\nwhich is sufficient to produce the browning of the crust, is very much\r\nabove that temperature. It is evident that as long as any considerable\r\nproportion of water remains in the loaf it will be difficult to raise\r\nthe interior of the loaf to the temperature just mentioned, and if this\r\nwere done the caramelization would take place throughout the whole\r\nloaf. Unfortunately, from a scientific point of view the investigation\r\nof this subject has not been always undertaken under conditions which\r\nare wholly beyond criticism. Many of the investigations have been in\r\nthe interest of rival baking powder companies, and it is very desirable\r\nthat this matter should be undertaken in a wholly unbiased way and\r\nconducted in such a manner as to lead to results which all will accept.\r\nChemical and physiological investigations, which have even as a remote\r\nobject the promotion of the sale of one compound and the repression\r\nof the sale of another, lose at the outset much of that claim upon\r\nthe public confidence which such investigations made from a purely\r\nscientific point of view should have.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Statement._--In respect of the use of chemical leavening\r\nagents in general it may be said that they introduce an extraneous\r\nproduct into the bread which is not likely to promote the health and\r\nwhich, therefore, on general principles should be excluded. On the\r\nother hand, large experience has shown that the consumption of bread\r\nmade by these leavening agents does not produce any general effect\r\nupon the public health which is noticeable. This, it is understood,\r\nis not any valid argument in favor of the process. It must also be\r\nacknowledged that a fermentation of a bread with yeast also introduces\r\nextraneous matter into the food, viz., alcohol and congeneric products\r\nof fermentation, and hence this process may be open to a certain\r\nextent to the same objection as the one above. It is too early yet to\r\nformulate definite principles either of inclusion or exclusion of these\r\nproducts, and the purpose of this manual is secured when the general\r\ncharacter and effects thereof are briefly outlined.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Composition of Bread.=--Because of the many different methods of bread\r\nmaking which are practised it is not possible to give in a chemical\r\nform an analysis which would do more than represent in general the\r\ncharacter of the bread in common use. For instance, the quantity of\r\nwater which is found in bread varies greatly and the nature of bread\r\nitself must be influenced by the character of the flour from which it\r\nis made. The flour depends upon the quality of the wheat used in its\r\nmanufacture. Hence the same brand of bread prepared in the same way\r\nand baked in the same manner must necessarily vary in composition from\r\nseason to season and even from day to day. It must be understood also\r\nthat it is a very common custom in the United States to use milk in\r\nthe mixing of dough, and thus a food product is introduced which of\r\nitself is not of constant character. Some bakers use whole milk, others\r\nskimmed, and others sour milk.\r\n\r\nA very good formula for mixing dough for bread making consists in using\r\nthe following proportions of ingredients mentioned:\r\n\r\n  Flour,       2,000 grams\r\n  Whole milk,    500   „\r\n  Water,         650   „\r\n  Salt,           25   „\r\n  Yeast cake,     10   „\r\n\r\nWhen properly leavened and kneaded and baked these quantities of\r\nmaterials will make a loaf of bread weighing 2750 grams.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Average Composition of Bread._--In the following tables are given the\r\naverage composition of bread of different classes. Class 1 is composed\r\nof loaves of the so-called Vienna or French type; Class 2 consists of\r\nwhat is known as home made bread or bread baked at the home and not in\r\nthe bakery; Class 3 consists of bread made from graham flour; Class\r\n4 consists of bread made largely of rye flour; Class 5 is a second\r\ncollection of home made bread which may be very properly compared with\r\nClass 2; Class 6 consists of bread of miscellaneous origin bought on\r\nthe open market. The data given represent the mean composition of\r\nnumbers of samples (Bull. 13, Bureau of Chemistry):\r\n\r\n                           MOIS-              ETHER\r\n                           TURE.

This comparison leads to the following composition:\r\n\r\n  Moisture,          35.00 percent\r\n  Protein,            8.00    „\r\n  Ether extract,       .75    „\r\n  Starch and sugar,  54.45    „\r\n  Fiber,               .30    „\r\n  Ash,                1.50    „\r\n\r\nOf the ash mentioned in the above analysis .50 percent may be ascribed\r\nto the natural mineral ingredient of flour and 1 percent to added salt.\r\n\r\nThe chief variations from the typical composition of bread made from\r\nhigh-grade flour are found in the moisture and ether extract. The\r\nmoisture may rise above 40 percent in breads made of flour rich in\r\ngluten or sink to 30 percent or under when flour of an inferior gluten\r\ncontent is employed. The quantity of ether extract depends chiefly upon\r\nthe amount of milk which is used in the making of bread and the amount\r\nof fat employed either in the bread itself or in greasing the pan in\r\nwhich it is baked. There is great difficulty in extracting a fatty\r\nbody which has been mixed with a glutinous material like flour. The\r\nanalytical data, therefore, do not represent in the ether extract all\r\nthe fat naturally present in the flour plus that added in the making of\r\ndough or in baking.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of moisture in bread may also be determined largely by\r\nthe time of baking and the temperature of the oven. A bread baked for\r\na long while at a low temperature will be much drier than a bread\r\nbaked quickly at a high temperature. The high temperature solidifies\r\nthe exterior of the loaf so as to make it difficult for the interior\r\nmoisture to escape. By quickly baking the bread the temperature of the\r\ninterior does not reach so high a temperature as in an oven with a low\r\ntemperature and a long-continued heat.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Standard for Moisture._--The quantity of moisture in bread of standard\r\nquality in the District of Columbia may not exceed 31 percent.\r\n\r\nThe average temperature of the baking oven is about 240° C. (464° F.).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Quantity of Sugar in Bread.=--The quantity of sugar found in fermented\r\nbread is always less than that present in the flour, added in milk,\r\nor otherwise introduced in the preparation of the dough. The sugar\r\ndisappears largely under the influence of the fermentation due to the\r\nyeast.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Quantity of Ash.=--The quantity of ash in bread is uniformly higher\r\nthan the content of mineral matter in the flour. This is due to the\r\naddition of common salt which is uniformly employed in all bread, and\r\nin the case of bread made from baking powder the retention of the\r\nmineral residues in the loaf increases to that extent the content of\r\nash. With the exception of the ash, the ether extract or fat, the\r\nsugar, and the dry material of bread correspond in quantity to the same\r\nmaterials in the flour from which it is made, except the loss due to\r\nthe caramelization of the crust.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Acidity of Bread._--The development of the lactic acid ferments is\r\nimportant in regard to hygienic conditions and to palatability. Flour\r\ncontains practically no acid in a free state, and the acidity of bread\r\nis itself due to the changes which take place in its preparation\r\nunder the influence of the ferments therein. Bread baked in the usual\r\nmanner after the yeast ferments have exerted their activity shows the\r\npresence of acetic acid, lactic acid, and other acids and salts. The\r\nacidity of bread adds to its palatability and also, doubtless, to its\r\ndigestibility. Bread, containing, as it does, a large percentage of\r\nprotein, is digested in an acid medium. The natural acidity of bread,\r\ntherefore, must be regarded as beneficial.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Comparative Nutritive Properties of Indian Corn Bread and Wheat\r\nBread.=--There is a widespread opinion that the products of Indian\r\ncorn are less digestible and less nutritious than those of wheat. This\r\nopinion amounts to a conviction in most European countries, where the\r\nproducts obtained by the milling of Indian corn are not regarded as fit\r\nfor human food in an unmixed state. The above opinion, it appears, has\r\nno justification either from the chemical composition of the two bodies\r\nor from recorded digestive and nutritive experiments.\r\n\r\nA study of the analytical data of the whole grain shows that in so\r\nfar as actual nutrition is concerned the maize is fully as nutritious\r\nas wheat. In respect of its content of fat Indian corn and its direct\r\nproducts easily take precedence of all the other cereals, with the\r\nexception of hulled oats. In round numbers Indian corn flour or bread\r\nmade therefrom contains twice as much fat or oil as wheat, three times\r\nas much as rye, twice as much as barley, and nearly as much as hulled\r\noats. In regard to digestible carbohydrates, that is digestible starch,\r\nsugar, dextrin, and fiber, Indian corn flour possesses a higher content\r\nthan hulled oats and almost the same content as wheat. In regard to\r\ndigestible protein Indian corn has nearly the same quantity as the\r\nother leading cereals, except oats. What it lacks, however, in its\r\nquantity of protein in so far as nutrition is concerned is more than\r\nmade up in its excess of fat.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Comparative Digestibility and Nutrition of Wheat and Indian Corn from\r\nExperiments Made in South Dakota Station, Bulletin 38.=--Pigs were fed\r\nwith Indian corn and wheat, or rather the ground Indian corn and ground\r\nwheat, and it was found that pound for pound there was a greater gain\r\nin the case of Indian corn flour than wheat. For 100 pounds of flour\r\nfed the average gain with Indian corn was 21.83 pounds and where wheat\r\nflour was used 20.79 pounds. These experimental data show that in\r\nregard to nutritive properties Indian corn flour cannot be considered\r\ninferior to wheat flour. Indian corn bread is particularly well suited\r\nfor persons engaged in hard manual labor. A ration which is composed\r\nlargely of Indian corn products and oatmeal is found to be particularly\r\nvaluable for those engaged in lumbering, harvesting sugar-cane, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Indian Corn Flour Pudding._--Various forms of pudding are prepared\r\nfrom Indian corn flour. Among the most important is that known in\r\nthe New England States as hasty pudding and in the west and south\r\nas mush. A simple method of preparing Indian corn pudding, hasty\r\npudding, or mush is to stir into water, very slowly, the Indian corn\r\nflour in such a way as to avoid the formation of lumps. The flour\r\nshould be sifted into the water either cold or at boiling temperature\r\nand the mixture vigorously stirred meanwhile. By this means a thin,\r\nuniform paste is secured which is allowed to cook slowly until quite\r\nthick in consistence and until all the starch granules are thoroughly\r\ndisintegrated. The product is improved by allowing to stand for several\r\nhours at near the boiling point after the cooking is finished, provided\r\nprecautions are taken not to allow the mass to become too solid. This\r\nproduct is eaten hot with butter, milk, or cream, or is much prized\r\nwhen allowed to cool, cut into thin slices and fried. A very important\r\ndish for the children of working people and farmers of the south and\r\nwest is mush and milk, namely the product above mentioned eaten with\r\nskim milk. This mixture forms a palatable and wholesome diet. Various\r\nother forms of pudding are made into which Indian corn enters to a\r\ngreater or less degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Composition of Biscuits.=--The composition of a biscuit or dry\r\nunleavened bread does not differ essentially from that of the ordinary\r\nbread except in the content of moisture. The biscuits are usually baked\r\nin thin cakes or loaves which become heated throughout and sometimes\r\ncaramelize throughout a large part of their substance. This favors\r\nthe expulsion of the greater part of the moisture which the dough\r\noriginally contained. The average composition of biscuits is shown in\r\nthe following data:\r\n\r\n  Moisture,           7.13 percent\r\n  Protein,            9.43    „\r\n  Ether extract,      8.67    „\r\n  Fiber,               .47    „\r\n  Ash,                1.57    „\r\n  Salt,                .99    „\r\n  Starch and sugar,  73.77    „\r\n\r\nIn the dry substance:\r\n\r\n  Protein,              10.18 percent\r\n  Ether extract,         9.33    „\r\n  Fiber,                  .53    „\r\n  Ash,                   1.70    „\r\n  Salt,                  1.08    „\r\n  Starch and sugar,     78.79    „\r\n  Calories,          4,755\r\n\r\nThe above data show that biscuits vary in composition from bread\r\nchiefly in their content of moisture and fat or oil. The moisture, as\r\nis noted, is very low, while the quantity of fat which the biscuit\r\ncontains is from 8 to 10 times as great as that contained in flour\r\nfrom which they are made. The salt content and the mineral ingredients\r\nof the biscuit are often higher than in bread or flour. Inasmuch as a\r\nlarge quantity of fat and salt are used commonly in the manufacture of\r\nbiscuits the presence of these bodies cannot in any sense be regarded\r\nas an adulteration. In forty-eight samples examined only four were free\r\nof notable quantities of added fat. In one case over 16 percent of fat\r\nwas found, and as it has been shown that all the fat which is added is\r\nnot extracted by ether it is evident that in this case an amount of fat\r\nequal to 20 percent of the weight of the flour may have been used.\r\n\r\nIt appears, from a study of the composition of biscuits, that it is\r\nadvisable to use them as a relish or delicacy for eating with cheese,\r\netc., in ordinary daily life, while they become almost a necessity in\r\nsome form or other in the preparation of emergency rations for marching\r\narmies, on shipboard, in logging camps, etc. It is not advisable to\r\nemploy them in the daily diet to the exclusion of bread. Their nutrient\r\ncontents have, in comparison with bread, a lower coefficient of\r\ndigestibility, due largely to the added fat.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Amount of Sugar Lost in Fermentation.=--The total quantity of sugar\r\nand other carbohydrates lost in fermentation amounts to about 2 percent\r\nof the weight of flour used. Sometimes it is much greater and sometimes\r\nless than this. The nutritive value of the product is diminished in\r\nproportion to the extent of the loss of sugar. The carbon dioxid\r\nproduced during fermentation has no food value, and the alcohol is\r\nlargely lost in the form of vapor during the process of baking. About\r\nhalf the loss is due to carbon dioxid and half to alcohol. The alcohol,\r\nalthough lost mostly during the baking, serves a useful purpose,--in\r\nthe expansion of the vapor it aids the carbon dioxid in making the\r\nbread more porous. The hydrolysis which takes place in baking converts\r\nsome of the starch to dextrinoid or saccharoid conditions. It is\r\nevident that from 6 to 8 percent of total starch present in the flour\r\nis changed during the fermentation and baking into more or less soluble\r\nforms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--COMPARATIVE APPEARANCE OF BREADS OF DIFFERENT\r\nKINDS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Texture and Size of Loaves Made from Different Kinds Of Flour.=--The\r\nvariations in bread and size of loaves made from different kinds of\r\nflour when the conditions of fermentation and baking are the same\r\ndepends upon the texture and quantity of the gluten material in the\r\nflour. The difference in the appearance and size of loaves is shown by\r\na photograph of the cross-sections of three loaves of bread in Fig. 36.\r\n\r\nIt is seen that the loaves made from graham flour and entire wheat\r\nflour are somewhat coarser in structure and are less in size than those\r\nmade from the same quantity of standard patent flour.\r\n\r\n\r\nMACARONI.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of wheat flour of a high glutenous character and molded\r\ninto various forms, usually tubes, cylindroids, or fine shreds, is\r\nknown in the trade under various names such as noodles, spaghetti, and\r\nmacaroni. An examination of a number of these bodies shows them to have\r\nthe following average composition:\r\n\r\n  Moisture,           9.66 percent\r\n  Protein,           12.02    „\r\n  Ether extract,       .42    „\r\n  Crude fiber,         .56    „\r\n  Ash,                 .78    „\r\n  Starch and sugar,  77.12    „\r\n\r\nIn the dry substance:\r\n\r\n  Protein,              13.33 percent\r\n  Ether extract,          .47    „\r\n  Crude fiber,            .62    „\r\n  Ash,                    .86    „\r\n  Starch and sugar,     85.34    „\r\n  Calories,          4,428\r\n\r\nThese bodies, it is seen, do not have a composition very different from\r\nthat of a first-class bread except in their content of moisture and\r\nprotein. They are made from various kinds of wheat, especially hard\r\nwheat which forms a tenacious gluten product well suited to molding\r\ninto the different forms which these bodies have. Their nutritive\r\nvalue is practically the same as that of good wheat bread of the same\r\nmoisture content.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Domestic Macaroni.=--The introduction of varieties of wheat with the\r\nproperties suitable for making macaroni has been thoroughly exploited\r\nby the Department of Agriculture. The macaroni wheat grown as a\r\nsubvariety is known botanically as _Triticum durum_. The durum wheats\r\nare not regarded as of equal value to the ordinary wheats for general\r\nmilling purposes and command a lower price. The French name is Blé dur\r\nand the German name is Hartweizen. The wheat of this subspecies grows\r\nrather tall, having broad, smooth leaves of a whitish green color\r\nand a very hard cuticle. The heads are comparatively slight in most\r\nvarieties, compactly formed, and occasionally very short. All the durum\r\nwheat is bearded and the beards are exceptionally long. The kernels\r\nare hard and glassy, often partly translucent. They are generally\r\nyellowish white in color, occasionally inclined to red, and the grains\r\nare generally rather large. In other aspects this wheat resembles\r\nbarley and for this reason in Germany it is often called Gerstenweizen.\r\nThe general appearance of these wheats both in the field and in the\r\nindividual heads is shown in the accompanying figures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--A FIELD OF DURUM WHEAT.--(_Courtesy of Bureau\r\nof Plant Industry._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--DROUGHT-RESISTANT MACARONI WHEATS (HEADS AND\r\nGRAINS).\r\n\r\n1, Kubanka; 2, Nicaragua; 3, Velvet Don; 4, Black Don; 5, Wild\r\nGoose.--(_Bulletin No. 3, Bureau of Plant Industry, U. S. Dept. of\r\nAgriculture._)]\r\n\r\nMacaroni wheats are well adapted to semi-arid regions; in fact it\r\nmay be said that they are the product of such an environment rather\r\nthan adapted to it. For this reason they are wheats which are able to\r\nresist continued dry weather and high temperature. These wheats do not\r\ngrow well in acid soils but flourish best in an alkaline soil of fine\r\ntexture and well supplied with humus and the necessary plant foods. The\r\nlargest quantity of macaroni wheat is grown in east and south Russia.\r\nThese wheats have given very good results in the semi-arid regions of\r\nthe United States. The appearance of the wheat as it grows in the field\r\nis shown in the accompanying plate.\r\n\r\nThe domestic macaroni is now made in many factories in the United\r\nStates and there is a continually increasing demand for the domestic\r\narticle. The hardiest varieties of wheat are used in the manufacture of\r\nthis article in the United States, especially the hard Kansas winter\r\nwheat.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Domestic Macaroni._--In the table below is given the\r\nmean composition of twenty samples of macaroni of domestic origin, made\r\nfrom domestic wheat. In the second column is given the mean composition\r\nof five samples of imported macaroni.\r\n\r\n                         DOMESTIC  FOREIGN\r\n                         PRODUCT.

In the United States the flour which\r\nis used is obtained by selecting the hardest wheat and preparing the\r\nflour in the usual manner. In France and Italy the preparation of\r\nsemolina is accomplished in separate mills. The devices for grinding\r\nare essentially the same as those for producing the best grade flour,\r\nthe main difference being that the wheat is moistened slightly before\r\ngrinding and the flour is less fine than ordinary baking flour.\r\n\r\nEvidently very slight changes in the method of milling would enable the\r\nordinary mill to produce a fine grade of macaroni flour either from\r\nthe macaroni wheat or from any very hard glutinous wheat grown in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Manufacture of Macaroni.=--As practiced in the best districts of\r\nItaly, macaroni is manufactured according to the following method:[27]\r\n\r\n  [27] Fairchild, U. S. Dept. Agr., Bureau of Plant Industry, Bulletin\r\n  25.\r\n\r\nThe durum wheat is ground into semola and sieved to remove the starchy\r\npart of the grains and leave the clear, light amber, or glutinous part.\r\nThree or four grades of quality are made, and these depend on the size\r\nof the sieve meshes.\r\n\r\nThe semola is put into a special iron mixer, shaped like an\r\nold-fashioned artillery mortar, except that it is square instead of\r\ncylindrical, and furnished in the bottom with special screw-shaped fans\r\nwith which to stir the paste or dough. Boiling water is added to the\r\nsemola and the dough is mixed for about seven minutes. The mass is then\r\nput on a flat, circular kneading board and kneaded by two sharp-edged\r\nparallel beams which rise and fall as the table turns and press into\r\nthe dough as they descend. A few minutes of kneading are sufficient\r\nand the homogeneous dough is then put into the cylinder and the piston\r\ndescends upon the mass, forcing it in strings slowly through the\r\nperforated plate at the bottom. Fifteen minutes are required to convert\r\nthe gallons of dough into thousands of feet of yellow macaroni. The\r\nyellow color is produced by the use of saffron or of a coal tar dye of\r\nwhich a very small quantity is put into each batch of dough. This is a\r\nreprehensible practice.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the strings of fresh paste which issue continually from\r\nthe die are of the proper length they are cut and thrown over a reed\r\npole and carried into the sunlight, if the weather is fair, or into\r\nsheltered terraces, protected by curtains from the rain, if the weather\r\nis unfavorable. On bright days the strings of macaroni are exposed\r\nto the sunlight only two hours. They must be dried out only slightly\r\nbefore being cellared for the night in dungeon-like underground vaults\r\nsimilar to the Bavarian beer cellars.\r\n\r\nFor twelve hours or more the poles of macaroni are kept in these damp\r\nplaces, until the dough has become moist and pliable again and the\r\nstrings have lost the brittleness that the exposure to the sunlight\r\nhas given them. From the cellars the poles are carried to shaded\r\nstorehouses open on all sides to the air but not lighted from above.\r\nHere, in great masses of millions of strings, they hang for several\r\ndays, from eight to twenty being required, depending upon the dryness\r\nof the atmosphere. According to the statements of a manager of a\r\nfactory this process of drying is necessary to give to the brittle\r\npaste a horn-like toughness and fit it to withstand the rough handling\r\nto which it will be subjected without breaking into small pieces.\r\n\r\nIn all this simple process the one point at which bacteria might have a\r\nchance to play a rôle is in the first drying, cellaring, and subsequent\r\nslow drying in the shade. The theory that the water is responsible for\r\nthe flavor must rest, it seems to the writer, on other than bacterial\r\ngrounds, for from the appearance of the tank which supplied the hot\r\nwater the inference is easy that the water is chalybeate, for the tank\r\nwas incrusted with iron.\r\n\r\n\r\nROLLS.\r\n\r\nThe term rolls is given to bread usually leavened with yeast or baking\r\npowder, and usually eaten warm, or hot. The term biscuit is generally\r\nbut improperly used in this country for hot bread made with baking\r\npowder. The composition of rolls varies greatly with their method\r\nof preparation. Those made with yeast have practically the same\r\ncomposition as ordinary fermented bread, while those made with a\r\nbaking powder or with exceptionally large additions of milk, butter,\r\nor lard vary in composition accordingly. In the making of hot rolls\r\nwith baking powder, lard or butter is commonly used to a very large\r\nextent as “shortening.” These fatty bodies render the gluten less\r\ntenacious, and the roll is thus easily broken and is without toughness\r\nor elasticity. Owing to this irregular use of shortening and of mineral\r\nmatter, including salt, the composition of rolls of commerce is\r\nextremely variable. In eleven samples of rolls analyzed, for instance,\r\nthe content of moisture varied from 7 to 34. Evidently the sample sold\r\nas a roll which contained only 7 percent of moisture was in point of\r\nfact a biscuit and not a roll. The percentage of ether extract in these\r\nsamples varied from .43 to 7.55. The average composition of the eleven\r\nsamples is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Moisture,          27.98 percent\r\n  Protein,            7.48    „\r\n  Ether extract,      3.41    „\r\n  Crude fiber,         .60    „\r\n  Ash,                1.31    „\r\n  Salt,                .69    „\r\n  Starch and sugar,  59.82    „\r\n\r\nIn the dry substance:\r\n\r\n  Protein,           10.46 percent\r\n  Ether extract,      4.74    „\r\n  Crude fiber,         .77    „\r\n  Ash,                1.81    „\r\n  Salt,                .81    „\r\n  Starch and sugar,  82.99    „\r\n  Calories,          4,538\r\n\r\n\r\nCAKES.\r\n\r\nWheat flour is one of the principal constituents of that class of\r\nsweetened bread known generally as cake. The kind and character of\r\ncake vary so greatly that no general statement of any very great value\r\ncan be made respecting the average composition. In addition to the\r\nsugar and flour which are used in the manufacture of cake various\r\nflavoring ingredients or essences are employed, and usually excessive\r\nquantities of butter or lard for shortening purposes. In addition to\r\nthis, other forms of cake are cooked in oil after the dough is made,\r\nthus adding an additional quantity of fatty matter to the material.\r\nEggs are also a common constituent of cakes and these introduce into\r\ntheir composition additional quantities of protein and fat. Baking\r\npowder is very generally used in this country instead of yeast for the\r\nleavening of the cake and thus an additional quantity of mineral matter\r\nis introduced into their composition.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of sweetened cakes the flour is mixed with eggs and\r\nsugar and butter or lard to the proper consistency with or without\r\nthe use of milk or cream. The cakes are baked in all kinds of sizes\r\nand shapes and may be eaten plain or in layers separated by a jelly,\r\nmarmalade, or some other preserve. The exterior of the cake is often\r\nfrosted with a mixture consisting of the white of egg beaten up with\r\nwhite sugar. The methods of mixing the ingredients of these cakes as\r\nwell as the method of frosting are so various that it would not be\r\npossible to undertake any minute description of them.\r\n\r\nFor flavoring various materials are employed, either the real article\r\nor the imitation thereof, such as artificial strawberry, vanilla, etc.\r\nThe cake or sweet cake is a very common dainty which is served at\r\ndessert. The ordinary cane sugar of commerce is the common sweetening\r\nmatter usually employed in the refined state although sometimes yellow\r\nsugar is used. Honey is not so commonly used as a sweetening agent in\r\nthis country as it is in European countries.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of one of the common varieties known as ginger cake\r\nsugar-cane sirup or molasses is a common ingredient.\r\n\r\nAn examination of a large number of samples of cake shows the following\r\naverage composition:\r\n\r\n  Moisture,       11.65 percent\r\n  Protein,         6.29    „\r\n  Ether extract,   9.81    „\r\n  Crude fiber,     0.50    „\r\n  Ash,             1.17    „\r\n  Salt,            0.39    „\r\n  Sugar,          24.57    „\r\n  Starch,         46.01    „\r\n\r\nIn the dry substance:\r\n\r\n  Protein,         7.29 percent\r\n  Ether extract,  11.41    „\r\n  Crude fiber,     0.57    „\r\n  Ash,             1.30    „\r\n  Salt,            0.44    „\r\n  Sugar,          27.84    „\r\n  Starch,         51.59    „\r\n  Calories,       4,805\r\n\r\nA study of the individual data shows extremely wide variations from the\r\nmean. The ether extract in the moisture samples in some cases amounted\r\nto over 19 percent and in the dry substance to over 24 percent. The\r\nmoisture in one case was over 64 percent while in the dry cake of\r\nbiscuit character it sinks below 5 percent and in one case below 4\r\npercent. The average data, therefore, are to be considered only as\r\na representative of this class of bodies and not as a type of any\r\nparticular variety.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Adulterations.=--It is difficult to speak of adulterations of a\r\nsubstance of the composition of cake. Any wholesome flavoring or\r\nsweetening ingredient or other wholesome ingredient may be used in the\r\nmanufacture of a cake of this kind without being an adulterant. From\r\nthis class of bodies, however, there is excluded artificial colors\r\nand artificial flavoring essences bearing the name of genuine. A\r\nyellow cake which does not owe its color to the eggs or other normal\r\ningredients employed must be regarded as an adulterated article,\r\nespecially if the dye used in producing the yellow is one of the coal\r\ndyes or coal tar derivatives such as naphthol yellow. The use of\r\nimitation fruit flavors such as the so-called strawberry, blackberry,\r\nraspberry, vanilla, etc., is also to be regarded as an adulteration.\r\nThe adulteration of cakes may be regarded as confined particularly to\r\nthese two classes of article assuming that all the other ingredients\r\nare wholesome and without injurious effects upon the digestion. The\r\neggs used in cake making should be fresh and palatable. Too often passé\r\nstorage eggs and eggs broken and preserved with borax or formaldehyde\r\nand unfit for consumption have been used by the bakers of cakes.\r\n\r\nMineral coloring matters have sometimes been found in cakes and\r\nthese are more objectionable by far than the artificial colors above\r\nmentioned. Where molasses from sugar-cane factories is used in the\r\nmanufacture of cake a considerable trace of chlorid of tin or of\r\nzinc salts may be found therein, derived from the wash used in the\r\ncentrifugal when drying sugar crystals or from the process of bleaching\r\nthe molasses. This must be regarded as a very serious adulteration and\r\nmolasses of this kind should never be used in the manufacture of cake\r\nnor for edible purposes upon the table. Sulfurous acid may also be\r\nabsorbed during the process of bleaching the sugar-cane juices.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to add that cake with its complex character should be\r\neaten as a relish rather than a diet. There is no hygienic or dietetic\r\nobjection to the mixture of sugar with the flour in the making of\r\nordinary sweetened bread. Such bread must be regarded as highly\r\nnutritious and as differing from ordinary bread only in a disturbance\r\nof the natural food content of the loaf caused by the addition of a\r\ncarbohydrate to the bread. Many of the cakes which are sold contain\r\nso small a quantity of sugar that they ought not to be classed with\r\nthe sweet cake. Out of the whole number of samples used in the making\r\nup of the above average only four contained so little sugar as to be\r\nineligible to bear the name of sweet cake or sweetened bread.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Breakfast Foods.=--A very large variety of cereal preparations\r\nare on the market under the general name of breakfast foods. These\r\npreparations are made directly from the cereals more or less completely\r\nground by subjecting them to certain manipulations of a fermentative or\r\nculinary character by means of which the preparations are made ready\r\nfor immediate consumption or at least with only a moderate degree of\r\nadditional cooking. The changes which take place in the preparation\r\nof cereals for breakfast foods are of two general characters, namely,\r\nthose produced by fermentative action with malt, yeast, or other\r\nferments, and, second, changes produced by heating, either in the\r\nmoist or dry state. Often both sets of changes are produced in the\r\nsame product. The general difference, therefore, between a so-called\r\nbreakfast food and the raw material from which it is made is found in\r\nthe conversion of more or less starch into sugar and the change in the\r\ncomposition of the material produced by moist heat or dry heat. In the\r\nlatter case the temperature may be raised to the state of considerable\r\ncaramelization.\r\n\r\nBreakfast foods may also contain added condimental substances, such\r\nas salt, sugar, etc., sometimes used in their preparation. Nearly all\r\nthe cereals or mixtures of cereals are represented in these prepared\r\nfoods. Oats probably occupy the first rank and the preparations of\r\noatmeal have to a large extent in the United States taken the place\r\nof home-prepared oatmeal for the breakfast table. Wheat, barley, and\r\nIndian corn are not far behind oats in their contributions to the\r\nnumerous varieties of breakfast foods.\r\n\r\nThe particular methods of preparation are usually trade secrets and at\r\nany rate the description of the extensive technical processes would be\r\nimproper in this manual. The secrets, however, are merely methods of\r\nmanipulation, since it is certain that the changes of a chemical nature\r\nwhich take place are of the general character or class described above.\r\n\r\nBreakfast foods are usually sold under trade-mark names which may or\r\nmay not give an indication of their origin or character. Sometimes, in\r\nfact, the trade name gives a false indication and the use of such trade\r\nnames must be considered as entirely reprehensible. Whenever a name\r\nused is descriptive it should be used in a practical sense and not for\r\nthe purpose of misleading or deceiving. Breakfast foods may represent\r\npractically the whole grain or the grain with a removal of a proportion\r\nof the outer covering or they may represent the refined flour from\r\nwhich all or a considerable proportion of the germ and some of the rich\r\nnitrogenous ingredients have been removed.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to give a list of the names which have been applied to\r\nbreakfast foods would consume many pages and be of little value.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Composition of Breakfast Foods.=--In so far as possible the breakfast\r\nfoods noted in the following tables have been arranged in accordance\r\nwith the raw material from which they have been produced and the data\r\ngiven represent the average composition of breakfast foods of the\r\nclasses mentioned. Individual variations from the average are often\r\nvery great.\r\n\r\n  Class   I.--Breakfast foods made from Indian corn products.\r\n  Class  II.--Breakfast foods made from wheat products.\r\n  Class III.--Breakfast foods made from oat products.\r\n  Class  IV.--Breakfast foods made from starch and tapioca.\r\n  Class   V.--Breakfast foods made from noodles, spaghetti, and\r\n              macaroni.\r\n  Class  VI.--Breakfast foods made from barley.\r\n  Class VII.--Breakfast foods of miscellaneous origin, that is\r\n              consisting of those compounds of raw material not\r\n              specified.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF BREAKFAST FOODS.[28]\r\n\r\n                                                     ETHER\r\n                                  MOIS-     PRO-       EX-\r\n                                  TURE.

The quantity of fiber also shows that the\r\nmaize flour produced has been very carefully bolted. The ash is almost\r\nnormal, showing only a small addition, probably of salt. The mean\r\nquantity of protein is that which would be predicted of an Indian\r\ncorn product ground by the most approved milling process in order to\r\nmake as white a flour as possible. These methods of preparing the\r\nflour, although so common, are not to be preferred either by reason of\r\npalatability or nutritive properties of the products. The old-fashioned\r\nmilling process makes a more palatable and more nutritious diet and\r\naffords a higher degree of heat and energy.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of the Indian corn products show that they are very much\r\nlower in protein than would be expected from an analysis of the whole\r\nkernels. The low content of fat in the products is doubtless due to\r\nthe complete degermination of the grain during the milling and to the\r\nfurther fact that the baking and other preparation of the material tend\r\nto occlude the fat particles, making their extraction quite difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Class II, Wheat Products._--The study of wheat products used as\r\nbreakfast foods shows that the wheat germ is not removed to any very\r\ngreat extent during the preparation of the raw material. In fact the\r\nquantity of ether extract appears somewhat greater than would be\r\nexpected in pure wheat products, and this leads to the supposition\r\nthat oatmeal or Indian corn must be mixed with the food product\r\nin small quantities, since the ether extract in the case of wheat\r\nproducts is more than three times as great as in the case of Indian\r\ncorn products of a similar character. This is an indication either of\r\nthe use of mechanical methods as stated above or else to the admixture\r\nof other bodies without mention. There does not appear to have been\r\nany notable quantity of mineral substance, common salt or otherwise,\r\nadded during the process of preparation. The quantity of protein in the\r\nproduct is that which would be predicted from the composition of wheat\r\nflour from which the samples are supposed to be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Class III, Oat Products._--The oat products have evidently been made\r\nwithout any extensive degermination, as is shown by the high content of\r\nfat or oil. The average composition of oat products shows that genuine\r\noatmeal is used in their preparation and the probability is that little\r\nadulteration is practiced. The high content of oil and protein produces\r\na corresponding depression in the quantity of carbohydrates. The high\r\nnutritive value of the product, both in respect of fat and of proteins,\r\nis fully illustrated by the analytical data obtained. The calories, as\r\nwill be noticed, are very much higher than in the corresponding product\r\nfrom Indian corn, wheat, or in fact of any other of the breakfast foods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Class IV, Products made of starch and tapioca_ show, in the analytical\r\ndata, that very high-grade starch materials are employed in the\r\npreparation of these bodies. The protein, ether extract, fiber, and ash\r\nalmost disappear. As shown in the data for the dry substance, more than\r\n99 percent of the whole material consists of carbohydrates, chiefly\r\nstarch. The calories are correspondingly diminished since starch and\r\nsugar have the least heat value of any class of food products, except\r\nthose of a mineral character. Foods of this kind are highly unbalanced,\r\nthat is, contain a large excess of starch and sugar, and are often very\r\nprejudicial to the health of persons whose ability to digest starch and\r\nsugar has been lessened by disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Class V, Noodles, spaghetti, and macaroni_ are often used as breakfast\r\nfoods, though not by any means so universally as many others in this\r\ncategory. The analytical data show that these bodies correspond very\r\nwell to the material, that is to the flour, rich in gluten, from\r\nwhich they are supposed to be made. The protein content is high,--the\r\nether extract, fiber, and ash low, and the calories correspond to the\r\nchemical composition of the material.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Class VI, Barley Products._--Barley products are not very commonly\r\nused as breakfast foods, but the malt used in the preparation of other\r\nbreakfast foods is usually made of barley, since the barley malt has\r\nthe highest diastatic value of any of the cereals.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Class VII, Miscellaneous breakfast foods_ are so called because the\r\ncharacter of the materials of which they are made is not known or no\r\nstatement is made by the manufacturer or dealer concerning them. The\r\nanalytical data, of course, do not lead to any decision regarding\r\nthe nature of the raw material employed. The percentage of protein,\r\nhowever, taken in conjunction with the rather low ether extract,\r\nindicates that they are probably made chiefly from wheat products.\r\n\r\nMuch may be said in favor of the use of prepared breakfast foods,\r\nfor, in so far as I know, they are usually palatable, wholesome, and\r\nnutritious. There are many points which may be urged against their\r\ngeneral use, chief of which is in regard to their cost. There is no\r\ncereal now in general use for edible purposes which is worth as much\r\nas two cents per pound in the markets of this country, yet breakfast\r\nfoods, which are only prepared cereals, are often sold for 10 or 15\r\ncents per pound. This is a high price in comparison with the cost\r\nof the raw material, but it must not be forgotten that the cost of\r\nmanufacture is to be considered. In the second place the cereal foods\r\nare undoubtedly best at the moment they are prepared. Unless carefully\r\npacked, they may become infected with insects of various kinds, which\r\ncertainly add nothing to their value and detract very much from their\r\ndesirability. In moist climates they become infested with mould and\r\neven with bacterial growths. Inasmuch as necessarily a large proportion\r\nof the prepared cereals remain for an indefinite time unsold, the\r\nconsumer is liable at any time to come into possession of one of these\r\ndeteriorated packages. In the third place there is no reason to believe\r\nthat a prepared breakfast food is any more digestible, nutritious,\r\nor favorable to the health of the healthy individual than the broken\r\ncereal itself properly cooked. Further than this it may be stated that\r\nthere is no preparation of cereals better than those which are freshly\r\nmade from the freshly broken or ground grain. If, therefore, one has\r\nthe time to properly prepare the fresh grains of the cereals they will\r\nbe more palatable and more nutritious and equally as digestible as\r\nany of the prepared articles. On the other hand, there are cases of\r\ndiseased or disordered digestion in which the prepared cereals will\r\nbe more digestible, but this is certainly not the case in a state\r\nof health. There is reason to believe, therefore, that the demand\r\nfor prepared cereals will continue, but the old-fashioned method of\r\npreparation of the cereal from the grain will still have its advocates.\r\n\r\nI think it may be said with certainty that the proper home preparation\r\nof a cereal as a breakfast food will not cost any more than the\r\noriginal cereal itself, and hence the price of this food ought not to\r\nbe much more than 4 cents per pound without counting the added water in\r\nits preparation.\r\n\r\nI believe, therefore, that our people of limited means can be safely\r\nadvised on the score of economy, palatability, and nutrition to prepare\r\ntheir own cereals for ordinary breakfast purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VI.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLES, CONDIMENTS, FRUITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCCULENT VEGETABLES.\r\n\r\nThe term vegetable as applied to food in the broadest sense of the\r\nword means that class which distinguishes it from animal food. In\r\na narrower sense, however, the term vegetable is used to denote a\r\ncertain class of food which is of a succulent or juicy nature. While\r\ncereals and fruits are vegetables in the broadest sense of the word\r\nthey are not in the narrow and common meaning. The term “vegetable” in\r\nthis section therefore refers to those substances commonly known as\r\nvegetables upon the market and which are characterized by their high\r\nwater content. On account of this abundance of liquid or juice the term\r\nsucculent is applied to them. The common vegetables which are included\r\nin this class consist of lettuce, spinach, potatoes, cauliflower,\r\nbeets, radishes, turnips, cabbage, green Indian corn, peas, beans,\r\ntomatoes, yams, etc. These vegetables contain in a fresh state from\r\n70 to 95 percent of water. Many of them can be kept for a length of\r\ntime without deterioration, especially the potato and beet, and for\r\na short time cabbage, radishes, etc., if kept cool and moist. Other\r\nkinds of vegetables are not easily preserved for any length of lime\r\nexcept in cold storage, such as lettuce, peas, beans, tomatoes, etc.\r\nIf the potato and other starchy tubers are kept out of account these\r\nvegetables do not have a very high nutritive value, as will be seen by\r\nthe analysis which follows. They have, however, an important part in\r\nthe ration because of their palatability and the effect which they have\r\nupon the general activity of the alimentary canal. For instance, there\r\nis very little nourishment obtained in eating a turnip which perhaps is\r\n95 percent water,--yet its palatability, its condimental character, and\r\nits general salutary effect upon digestion is such as to make it worth\r\nwhile to pay even a high price in proportion to its nutriment. For this\r\nreason, as well as for their nutritive value, the use of succulent\r\nvegetables is to be very highly commended.\r\n\r\nIn general, as has been said, these vegetables are eaten in a fresh\r\nstate or after being kept for a considerable time in cold storage\r\nor otherwise. The potato, for instance, can be kept by properly\r\ncovering it in the earth or in bins through the winter. Cabbages\r\nare also kept in the same way and many other vegetables without\r\napparent deterioration. These vegetables are often desiccated, and\r\nin this way can be kept for a much longer period. Unfortunately no\r\nmethod of desiccation has been developed which preserves entirely the\r\npalatability of the vegetable, although its nutrient properties, which\r\nare perhaps the least important of its properties in many respects, are\r\npreserved to a certain extent by desiccation.\r\n\r\nWe may, however, leave out of consideration the desiccation of fresh\r\nvegetables. Certain of the vegetables above mentioned naturally become\r\ndesiccated on maturity as in the case of peas and beans, but then they\r\nare removed from the category of succulent vegetables. Green Indian\r\ncorn is also often dried, but in this process its palatability is to a\r\ncertain extent impaired even when it is prepared for cooking in such\r\na way as to restore practically all of the water which has been lost.\r\nSucculent vegetables are eaten either in a raw state or after cooking.\r\nFor instance radishes and vegetables of this class are rarely cooked.\r\nOn the other hand, potatoes, peas, and beans are always cooked and\r\npractically never eaten raw. Green Indian corn is also universally\r\ncooked before eating. There are other vegetables which are sometimes\r\neaten raw and sometimes cooked, as, for instance, the turnip, while on\r\nthe other hand the beet, which is very sweet and naturally would be\r\nconsidered a suitable food for eating in a raw state, is always cooked\r\nbefore it is consumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Artichoke.=--This vegetable, while not very extensively grown in the\r\nUnited States, is cultivated to a very extensive degree in Europe.\r\nThe tubers of the artichoke (_Cynara Scolymus_) are essentially\r\na carbohydrate food, growing underground, and thus belong, in a\r\nmeasure, to the same class as the potato, the yam, and the beet. The\r\ncarbohydrates which are present in artichokes do not contain very\r\nmuch starch. In this respect they differ from the potato and the yam.\r\nWhen the starch of the potato and yam is converted by fermentation or\r\notherwise into sugar it forms chiefly dextrose or maltose. On the other\r\nhand, when the carbohydrates of artichokes are converted into sugar\r\nthey form chiefly levulose. The principal part of the carbohydrate\r\nis known as inulin or levulin. The artichoke can be easily kept over\r\na long period of time, and may remain without much detriment in the\r\nground, where the winters are not severe, from autumn until spring.\r\nAfter harvesting it may be kept for some time without any very great\r\nloss in its food value.\r\n\r\nIn the following table are given the data showing the composition of\r\nthe artichoke, harvested in the autumn and also in the spring:\r\n\r\n  Spring:\r\n    Water,              79.03 percent\r\n    Inulin or levulin,  17.76    „\r\n    Protein,             1.27    „\r\n    Ether extract,        .18    „\r\n    Ash,                  .99    „\r\n\r\n  Fall:\r\n    Water,              79.70 percent\r\n    Inulin or levulin,  16.93    „\r\n    Protein,             1.48    „\r\n    Ether extract,        .14    „\r\n    Ash,                 1.08    „\r\n\r\n  (Behrend, J. für Landwirtschaft, vol. 52, p. 134, 1904.)\r\n\r\nThe above data show that the artichoke, like the potato, is a food\r\nproduct poor in protein and in fat and rich in carbohydrate material.\r\nIn so far as known the carbohydrates of artichokes are equally as\r\ndigestible and nutritious as those of other tubers.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Asparagus.=--Asparagus (_Asparagus officinalis_ L.)--French, asperge;\r\nGerman, spargel; Italian, sparagio; Spanish, esparrago--is a highly\r\nprized vegetable and is a native of Europe. The edible asparagus is\r\nthe young, fresh, undeveloped shoots taken at an early period of\r\ngrowth. They are highly valued when stewed or for use as a salad. There\r\nis a number of varieties of asparagus, among which may be mentioned\r\nthe Giant Dutch asparagus, the common green asparagus, white German\r\nasparagus, etc. These are different in kind only, since they all belong\r\nto the same botanical species and the variations are produced chiefly\r\nby different methods of cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition._--\r\n\r\n  Water,                93.96 percent\r\n  Ash,                    .67    „\r\n  Protein,               1.83    „\r\n  Fiber,                  .74    „\r\n  Sugar, starch, etc.,   2.55    „\r\n  Fat,                    .25    „\r\n\r\nAsparagus is composed chiefly of water, which amounts, in round\r\nnumbers, to 94 percent of its entire weight. Its edible portion is rich\r\nin protein as compared with the beet and many other vegetables. It\r\nis somewhat richer also in fat than the beet or the turnip. Its food\r\nvalue, as will be seen, is largely of a condimental character.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Bean.=--The bean belongs to the family Fabaceæ. It is a native\r\nof America and has been cultivated from the earliest times. There are\r\nmany different varieties of the bean which are cultivated in this\r\ncountry. They grow over the whole range of the United States. There\r\nare early and late maturing varieties. Beans are used for food both in\r\nthe fresh state, while the pods are tender and can be eaten with the\r\nimmature beans, and also in the dry state, in which condition they are\r\na staple article of food. There are many different varieties of beans\r\nwhich, while not always botanically identical, are sufficiently so to\r\nwarrant the use of the common name. Two general classes, however, may\r\nbe distinguished, namely, those that grow in small clusters or bunches\r\nand those that grow upon vines or tendrils which have to be supported.\r\nIn regard to the kinds of culture to which beans are subjected there\r\nmay be mentioned field beans, which are cultivated over a large area,\r\nand garden beans, which are cultivated in small gardens for the green\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Kidney Bean._--The kidney bean, or French bean, is a special botanical\r\nvariety (_Phaseolus vulgaris_ L.). It is what is known in French as\r\nharicot; in German as Bohne; Dutch, Boon; Italian, faginolo; Spanish,\r\nhabichuela. This variety of bean is commonly called a French bean and\r\nis a native of South America. It does not seem to have been known\r\nbefore the discovery of the American continent and hence is not thought\r\nto have grown wild in any other part of the world. The kidney bean\r\nis not very well suited to very high northern latitudes, since it is\r\nparticularly sensitive to the cold, even if the temperature is not low\r\nenough to produce frost. The kidney bean is cultivated over large areas\r\nand is also a garden crop. There are early and late varieties, so that\r\nthe season for the kidney bean is a long one. The pods of this bean\r\nare distinguished by being long and slender, and it is particularly\r\nvaluable for edible purposes while green and is also prized for\r\ncanning. This is true, especially, of that variety which has a tender\r\npod.\r\n\r\nThere is another variety of bean in which the pod is tough, and this,\r\nof course, is not so well suited for eating green, although when very\r\nyoung, even the tough-podded bean can be used. There are a great many\r\ndifferent varieties of kidney beans known, one of which is called the\r\n“dwarf kidney bean” on account of its growing only on low bushes and\r\nneeding no support for the vines. In this variety the pods hang in\r\nthick clusters, the lower ends often touching the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Butter Beans._--There is another large class of beans known as butter\r\nbeans. This variety is also known as Geneva, or plainpalais, or wax\r\nbean.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lima Beans._--The Lima bean is also a different botanical species\r\nknown as _Phaseolus lunatus_ L. It is nearly related to the kidney\r\nbean, being also a native of South America. The vine is a very long\r\none, often reaching more than 10 feet if a proper support be offered\r\nit. The common Lima bean is one which matures rather late in the\r\nseason, but it is most highly valued for its product, which is eaten\r\nshelled. There are smaller varieties of this bean known as the dwarf\r\nLima or small Lima.\r\n\r\nThe total number of varieties of beans which are known and cultivated\r\nis, perhaps, more than 100, but they belong in general to the large\r\nclasses specified.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Average Composition of Green, String, and Lima Beans._--\r\n\r\n  Lima beans:\r\n    Water,          68.46 percent\r\n    Ash,             1.69    „\r\n    Protein,         7.15    „\r\n    Crude fiber,     1.71    „\r\n    Carbohydrates,  20.30    „\r\n    Fat,              .69    „\r\n\r\n  String beans:\r\n    Water,          87.23 percent\r\n    Ash,              .76    „\r\n    Protein,         2.20    „\r\n    Crude fiber,     1.92    „\r\n    Carbohydrates,   7.52    „\r\n    Fat,              .37    „\r\n\r\nThe above data are for green _Lima_ beans with the pod removed and\r\nfor _string_ beans including the pod. The latter, it is seen, are\r\ncomposed largely of water, containing less than 13 percent of dry\r\nmatter. Of the dry matter almost 20 percent is protein. The soluble\r\ncarbohydrates, including the starch and sugar, are the most important\r\nof the ingredients of the dry substance in so far as actual weight\r\nis concerned. In the Lima bean the protein is more than three times\r\nas great as in the string bean, and the starch and sugar almost\r\nthree times as much. As a nutrient, therefore, the Lima beans are\r\nfar more valuable than the string beans. These data may be taken as\r\nrepresentative of all varieties of green beans, hulled and unhulled,\r\nthe Lima beans being types of hulled beans and the string variety being\r\nthe type of beans including the pod.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Dry Bean._--\r\n\r\n  Water,                15.86 percent.\r\n  Ash,                   3.53    „\r\n  Protein,              20.57    „\r\n  Fiber,                 3.86    „\r\n  Sugar, starch, etc.,  55.49    „\r\n  Fat,                    .69    „\r\n\r\nThe analyses show that the dry bean is much richer in protein than the\r\ncereals.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Beets.=--All the varieties of edible beets belong to the common\r\nspecies _Beta vulgaris_ L. French, betterave; German, Salat-Rübe;\r\nDutch, Betwortel; Italian, barbabietola; Spanish, remolacha.\r\n\r\nThe most important of these beets, economically, is the variety which\r\nhas been cultivated for the purpose of producing sugar. By long years\r\nof selection and improvement the sugar content of the natural beet,\r\nwhich is not more than from four to six percent, has been brought up to\r\nan average of about 14 percent, often reaching much larger quantities.\r\nThe sugar beet itself, in its earlier stages, makes an excellent\r\nvegetable for the table, being particularly sweet and palatable. Its\r\ntannin content, however, is very high, and before cooking, especially,\r\nit has quite a bitter taste, at times. This disappears in the young\r\nbeets when they are cooked. The sugar beet has a perfectly white flesh,\r\ninasmuch as the attempt was made in the early period of cultivation\r\nto develop a beet without color in order to produce a white sugar\r\nwith as little trouble as possible. On the other hand the garden beet\r\nis usually highly colored, the red beet being especially prized. The\r\nnumber of varieties of beets in cultivation is very great. Among the\r\nmost important may be mentioned the long blood-red beet, which is the\r\ncommon garden beet, the rough-skinned red beet, the pear-shaped beet,\r\nthe turnip-shaped beet, all of which are of the red color. There is\r\nalso cultivated for eating purposes a beet with yellow flesh, though it\r\nis not by any means so common as the red garden beet.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Beet._--The following data represents the average\r\ncomposition of the red beet used as a vegetable:\r\n\r\n  Water,                88.47 percent\r\n  Ash,                   1.04    „\r\n  Protein,               1.53    „\r\n  Fiber,                  .88    „\r\n  Sugar, starch, etc.,   7.94    „\r\n  Fat,                    .14    „\r\n\r\nThe above data show that the average garden beet has a little less than\r\n12 percent of solid matter and a little more than 88 percent of water.\r\nIt is rather poor in protein, though it is not a vegetable which can be\r\nclassed as being excessively deficient in nitrogenous constituents. Its\r\nchief food value, however, is in the sugar which it contains, which is\r\nmore than 7 percent. It is quite deficient in fat.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Brussels Sprouts.=--Brussels sprouts is a variety of cabbage which is\r\ngrown over large areas in different countries and has a deservedly high\r\nreputation on the table. The French name is chou de Bruxelles; German,\r\nBrüsseler Sprossen-Kohl; Italian, cavolo a germoglio; Spanish, bretones\r\nde Bruselas. The composition of Brussels sprouts is practically the\r\nsame as that of cabbage.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cabbage.=--The botanical name of the cabbage is _Brassica oleracea_\r\nL. and it belongs to the family Brassicaceæ. It is a plant which is\r\nindigenous to both Europe and Asia, and still grows wild in some parts\r\nof the European continent. It is eaten both raw, in the form of salad,\r\nslaw, etc., and cooked in various methods. It is also subjected to a\r\nfermentation, producing the highly prized dish known as sauer-kraut.\r\nIts French name is chou cabus; German, Kopfkohl; Italian, cavolo\r\ncappuccio; Spanish, col repollo.\r\n\r\nThe cabbage is a plant which, as it approaches maturity, has its leaves\r\nfolded upon each other in a solid mass, producing the head. These\r\nleaves naturally become bleached and are extremely crisp and tender.\r\nThe external, free leaves are not prized as a food. The varieties of\r\nthe cabbage are almost legion and are produced by different methods of\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition._--\r\n\r\n  Water,                90.52 percent\r\n  Ash,                   1.40    „\r\n  Protein,               2.39    „\r\n  Fiber,                 1.47    „\r\n  Starch, sugar, etc.,   3.85    „\r\n  Fat,                    .37    „\r\n\r\nThe above data show that cabbage is composed chiefly of water,\r\namounting to as much as 91 percent of its weight. Its principal food\r\nconstituents are starch, sugar, and digestible fiber. Its most valuable\r\nfood constituent is most probably the protein, of which it contains a\r\nlarge proportionate quantity. In all its forms cabbage is a wholesome,\r\nif not very nutritious, dish.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Carrot.=--The botanical name of the carrot is _Daucus carota_ L.\r\nFrench, carotte; German, Mohre; Italian, carota; Spanish, zanahoria.\r\n\r\nThis plant is indigenous to Europe. The carrot is naturally a biennial\r\nplant, though it is often produced in a single season, and especial\r\nefforts are made to produce quick-growing carrots. This vegetable is\r\nmuch more common in Europe than in the United States, and when grown\r\nhere at all it is used chiefly in soups and often for cattle food.\r\nThere is a large number of varieties of carrots, but practically all\r\nbelong to the same botanical species. The flesh is often of a yellow\r\ntint, though blood-red carrots are grown and highly prized.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition._--\r\n\r\n  Water,                88.59 percent\r\n  Ash,                   1.02    „\r\n  Protein,               1.14    „\r\n  Fiber,                 1.27    „\r\n  Starch, sugar, etc.,   7.56    „\r\n  Fat,                    .42    „\r\n\r\nIt is seen from the above data that the carrot has almost exactly the\r\ncomposition of the garden beet. Its principal food value is in the\r\nsugar and other carbohydrates which it contains. It also has a notable\r\nproportion of protein and has almost 12 percent of solid matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cauliflower.=--Cauliflower is a variety of cabbage the edible portion\r\nof which is the extraordinarily modified and thickened flower cluster.\r\nIt is more tender and delicate in its structure than the common\r\ncabbage. The French name is choufleur; German, Blumenkohl; Italian,\r\ncavolfiore; Spanish, coliflor.\r\n\r\nIt is highly prized when prepared for the table with a sauce. It is a\r\ndish which is much more common in Europe than in this country, where\r\nit is not appreciated as it should be. There is a large number of\r\nvarieties produced, chiefly by the different methods of cultivation and\r\nthe effect of environment in which they are grown.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition._--\r\n\r\n  Water,                90.82 percent\r\n  Ash,                    .81    „\r\n  Protein,               1.62    „\r\n  Fiber,                 1.02    „\r\n  Sugar, starch, etc.,   4.94    „\r\n  Fat,                    .79    „\r\n\r\nThe cauliflower is very close to the cabbage in composition, having,\r\nhowever, a slightly larger proportion of digestible carbohydrates and\r\na much larger proportion of fat. Its dietetic value, however, is not\r\nnotably different from that of the cabbage.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Celery.=--One of the most important vegetables upon the table in this\r\ncountry is celery. The botanical name of celery is _Apium graveolens_\r\nL. The French name is celeri; German, Sellerie; Italian, sedano;\r\nSpanish, apio.\r\n\r\nCelery is indigenous to Europe. It is eaten in its young state, and\r\nis most valued when the stalks are bleached. This is accomplished by\r\nhilling up the earth around them or protecting them from the light by\r\nboards or otherwise. Kept in the dark in this way the green color fades\r\nand the stalks becomes more crisp and brittle. There is a number of\r\nvarieties of celery, and these are chiefly due to the different methods\r\nof cultivation. Celery is not only eaten raw but also stewed and is a\r\ncommon constituent of soup. Celery seeds are supposed to have not only\r\na condimental but a medicinal value.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Chicory.=--The botanical name of chicory is _Cichorium intybus_ L.\r\nIn French it is called chicorée sauvage; German, wilde or bittere\r\nChichorie; Italian, cicoria selvatica; Spanish, achicoria amarga o\r\nagreste.\r\n\r\nThe wild chicory is used chiefly, even in its cultivated state, for\r\nsalad purposes, the roots not being of any value on account of their\r\nsmallness. The chicory, however, develops under cultivation a large\r\nroot like the carrot or turnip, and this variety of chicory is used\r\nchiefly on account of the roots, which, when they are roasted properly,\r\nare highly prized as a substitute for coffee. The common wild chicory\r\nhas been used from time immemorial as a salad. The leaves have rather a\r\nbitter taste and are more highly prized for salad purposes when mixed\r\nwith lettuce or other leaves which have a less pronounced flavor. The\r\nvariety of chicory of which the roots are used as a substitute for\r\ncoffee is known as “Brunswick chicory,” or Magdeburg large-rooted\r\nchicory.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Root._--\r\n\r\n  Water,                     79.20 percent\r\n  Ash,                        1.11    „\r\n  Sugars,                      .60    „\r\n  Inulin,                    14.00    „\r\n  Fiber,                      1.29    „\r\n  Protein and undetermined,   3.50    „\r\n\r\nStarch does not appear to be among the carbohydrates in chicory but\r\ninulin takes its place. In this respect chicory resembles the artichoke\r\nin its composition.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Roasted Chicory._--When chicory is used as a substitute for coffee or\r\nas a substance added to coffee it is roasted, and its composition is\r\nthus materially changed, as is represented by the following data:\r\n\r\n  Moisture,                  13.3 percent\r\n  Ash,                        5.9    „\r\n  Sugar,                     12.4    „\r\n  Inulin,                     4.3    „\r\n  Fiber,                      6.9    „\r\n  Caramel and undetermined,  57.2    „\r\n\r\nFrom the data of the above analysis the inulin does not appear to have\r\nbeen very largely converted into levulose by roasting, but rather into\r\nthe insoluble carbohydrate matter. Whether or not, therefore, the\r\ninulin exists in the large proportion given in the analysis of the\r\nfresh chicory is a matter of some doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cranberry.=--The cranberry is grown extensively in the swampy grounds\r\nof the northern part of the United States, especially in New England,\r\nNew Jersey, and Wisconsin. It is a red, hard berry, not at all pleasant\r\nto the taste in its fresh state, very acid, but greatly valued during\r\nthe autumn and winter months when stewed with sugar and served as a\r\nsauce, especially with turkey. Its chief use, in fact, is to eat with\r\nturkey or chicken. The cranberry is a fruit which contains naturally a\r\nsmall quantity of benzoic acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition._--\r\n\r\n  Water,           86.10 percent\r\n  Solids,          13.90    „\r\n  Soluble solids,   8.43    „\r\n  Acidity,          1.98    „\r\n\r\n  (Measured as grams of sulfuric acid per 100 grams of material.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cress.=--The botanical name of cress is _Lepidium sativum_ L. French,\r\ncresson alenois; German, Garten-Kresse; Italian, agretto; Spanish,\r\nmastuerzo.\r\n\r\nIt is a plant which is indigenous to Persia. It grows in this country\r\nin moist gardens and particularly in the warmer parts of the country.\r\nThe real water cress belongs to a different species, its botanical\r\nname being _Rorippa nasturtium_. It grows only in water, in which it\r\ndiffers from the preceding variety. It is highly prized as an aromatic\r\nflavoring material and for table use. There are very many varieties in\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cucumbers.=--The botanical name of cucumber is _Cucumis sativus_ L.\r\nFrench, concombre; German, Gurke; Italian, cetriulo; Spanish, cohombro.\r\n\r\nThe cucumber is indigenous to East India, but is now cultivated in all\r\ncountries. It is a plant which develops vines which often run to great\r\ndistances. The cucumber is used almost exclusively in its green state,\r\nand the very young cucumbers are most highly prized for making pickles,\r\nthough all sizes are used for that purpose, from the very smallest to\r\nthe giant variety. The number of varieties cultivated is extremely\r\ngreat. The variety known as the gherkin is highly prized for pickling.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Cucumber._--\r\n\r\n  Water,                95.99 percent\r\n  Ash,                    .46    „\r\n  Protein,                .81    „\r\n  Fiber,                  .69    „\r\n  Starch, sugar, etc.,   1.83    „\r\n  Fat,                    .22    „\r\n\r\nThe above data show that the cucumber is not much more than solid\r\nwater, there being just enough of other material to give it a flavor\r\nand consistence.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Egg Plant.=--Another vegetable which is highly prized for the table\r\nis the egg plant, _Solanum melongena_ L. French, aubergine; German,\r\nEierpflanze; Italian, petronciano; Spanish, berengena.\r\n\r\nThe egg plant is indigenous to India. Its name is derived from the\r\nshape of some of its varieties, though many of them have ceased to\r\nresemble the egg in appearance. There is a large number of varieties,\r\nbut the one which is known as the white egg plant looks more like an\r\negg both in shape and color than most of the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition._--\r\n\r\n  Water,                92.93 percent\r\n  Ash,                    .50    „\r\n  Protein,               1.15    „\r\n  Fiber,                  .77    „\r\n  Starch, sugar, etc.,   4.34    „\r\n  Fat,                    .31    „\r\n\r\nThe egg plant is a highly succulent vegetable containing only a little\r\nmore than 7 percent of solid matter, and this is chiefly sugar, starch,\r\nand other digestible carbohydrates.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Garlic.=--The botanical name of garlic is _Allium sativum_ L. French,\r\nail ordinaire; German, Gewöhnlicher Knoblauch; Italian, aglio; Spanish,\r\najo vulgar.\r\n\r\nThis highly prized aromatic vegetable is indigenous to southern Europe.\r\nIt is a perennial plant, and the edible bulbous portion grows chiefly\r\nunderground. This part is used for spicing food. It is eaten in large\r\nquantities by the Latin nations of southern Europe, and is employed\r\nthroughout the world as a seasoning or flavoring for many dishes. When\r\neaten in excess it makes the breath extremely disagreeable, as can be\r\nwitnessed by all who have traveled in the Latin countries of Europe and\r\neven among the South Germans. Garlic is not eaten to any extent by our\r\nnative citizens, but is used by our first-class cooks extensively as a\r\nseasoning. A little of it is known to go a great way. Its composition\r\nis very much like that of the onion. A wild garlic grows in the United\r\nStates over wide areas. It is often eaten by cows, and it imparts to\r\nthe milk a very disagreeable flavor and smell.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Gourds.=--Gourds themselves are not very much used for edible\r\npurposes, but the varieties which include all the species of pumpkin\r\nand squash belong to the important vegetable foods in the United\r\nStates. The most important member of this family is the pumpkin,\r\n_Cucurbita pepo_ L., which grows often to an enormous size and has a\r\nbeautiful yellow color. The French name for the pumpkin is potirons;\r\nGerman, Melonen oder Centner Kurbiss; Italian, zucca; Spanish, calabaza\r\ntotanera.\r\n\r\nThe pumpkin of California, especially, is noted for its gigantic\r\nproportions. The pumpkin is used very extensively in New England, as\r\nwell as other parts of the country, for making pies, and is also used\r\nas a sauce. The pumpkin is not eaten raw. As a cattle food it is highly\r\nprized in all parts of the country, and when fed to milch cows it\r\nimparts to the butter, even in the winter, a delicate amber tint.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Flesh of the Pumpkin._--\r\n\r\n  Water,                93.39 percent\r\n  Ash,                    .67    „\r\n  Protein,                .91    „\r\n  Fiber,                  .98    „\r\n  Sugar, starch, etc.,   3.93    „\r\n  Fat,                    .12    „\r\n\r\nIt is seen that the flesh of the pumpkin is essentially a watery food,\r\nthe chief ingredient of the solid matter being sugar. Its value,\r\ntherefore, as a food is more condimental than nutritive.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Horse-radish.=--The botanical name of horse-radish is _Cochlearia\r\narmoracia_ L. French, raifort sauvage; German, Meerettig; Italian,\r\nrafano; Spanish, taramago.\r\n\r\nThe horse-radish is prized as one of the principal condimental\r\nvegetable substances in common use in the United States. It is\r\nparticularly used with oysters and other foods of similar character\r\nand as a sauce or spice in a salad. It is indigenous to Europe, but is\r\nnow cultivated everywhere. There are many varieties, but they are all\r\ncharacterized by a sharp, pungent taste and odor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Horse-radish._--Other vegetable substances, as,\r\nfor instance, the more highly spiced aromatic turnips, are often\r\nsubstituted for horse-radish.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Jerusalem Artichoke.=--This is a plant of the aster family\r\n(_Helianthus tuberosus_ L.) producing a heavy ovoid head the fleshy\r\nparts of which, including the base to which they are attached, are\r\nhighly valued as food, being usually eaten with a sauce. This plant is\r\nmore largely cultivated in France and other European countries than in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Kale.=--Kale is a variety of cabbage which is somewhat different\r\nbotanically from the common cabbage. This form of cabbage does not make\r\na firm head, but grows only with free leaves. It is especially adapted\r\nfor use in much the same manner as the common substance known by the\r\nhousewife as greens. It is a hardy plant and grows well even in cold\r\nclimates. There are a great many varieties of kale, and the composition\r\nis practically that of the cabbage.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Leek.=--The leek is of the same variety of plant as the garlic. Its\r\nbotanical name is _Allium porrum_ L. French, poireau; German, Lauch;\r\nItalian, porro; Spanish, puerro.\r\n\r\nThe leek is thought to be indigenous to Switzerland, though this is not\r\nquite certain. It is closely related to the garlic and onion and is\r\nvalued for the same purposes, namely, its highly aromatic condimental\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lettuce.=--Among the most valued of the succulent vegetables is the\r\nlettuce. Its botanical name is _Lactuca sativa_ L. French, laitue\r\ncultivée; German, Lattich; Italian, lattuga; Spanish, lechuga.\r\n\r\nLettuce is thought to be indigenous to India or Central Asia. It has\r\nbeen cultivated, however, for so long that its origin is a matter of\r\ndoubt. There is a legion of varieties of lettuce, but they all have\r\nessentially the same characteristics and have little food value.\r\nLettuce is now found practically throughout the whole year in all\r\ncivilized countries, being grown under glass in winter so as to furnish\r\na continuous supply for the markets throughout the year. It is used\r\nchiefly as salad, and among the varieties which are most highly prized\r\nfor this purpose are the cabbage lettuce and the variety known as\r\nRomaine. The Romaine is distinguished from the common lettuce by the\r\nshape of the leaves, which are much longer and narrower than those of\r\nordinary lettuce. The Romaine lettuce is more highly prized by most\r\nconnoisseurs as being more tender and brittle than the first variety.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition._--\r\n\r\n  Water,                93.68 percent\r\n  Ash,                   1.61    „\r\n  Protein,               1.41    „\r\n  Fiber,                  .74    „\r\n  Sugar, starch, etc.,   2.18    „\r\n  Fat,                    .38    „\r\n\r\nThe data show that lettuce is a highly succulent vegetable. Its chief\r\nfood constituents are protein and sugar. Its real value as a food is\r\nnot shown by chemical analysis because it consists in a delicate,\r\naromatic flavor which is not revealed by the crucible.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Melons.=--There are two kinds of melons eaten in the United\r\nStates,--the first the watermelon, and the second the cantaloupe or\r\nmuskmelon. In Europe the principal melon which is used is one having\r\ndeep yellow flesh resembling the color of a pumpkin and known as the\r\nFrench melon. The botanical name is _Cucumis melo_ L. French, melon;\r\nGerman, Melone; Italian, popone; Spanish, melon.\r\n\r\nThe French melon is indigenous to Asia, but only the cultivated\r\nvarieties are known now. The flesh is very sweet and is, as has already\r\nbeen said, usually of a deep yellow color, though there are many\r\ndifferent varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cantaloupe.=--This is a general name given to the melons of the\r\nFrench type or varieties thereof growing in the United States. It is\r\nsupposed to have had its origin in Italy, though its history is so old\r\nas not to be certain. The cantaloupe is of various sizes and shapes\r\nand various degrees of sweetness. In the United States the variety\r\ngrown at Rocky Ford, Colorado, is noted for its sweetness and general\r\npalatability. For this reason many melons not grown at Rocky Ford are\r\nimproperly sold under that name. There are a great many varieties of\r\ncantaloupes. Generally the flesh of the cantaloupe is green instead of\r\nyellow. The cantaloupe is often called muskmelon.\r\n\r\nANALYSIS OF JUICE OF MUSKMELONS.\r\n\r\n                 FROM RIND OF MELON.\r\n  --------+-----+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n   SERIES |     | NITRO- |        |        |REDUCING\r\n     NO.  |BRIX.|  GEN.  |  ASH.  |SUCROSE.| SUGAR.\r\n  --------+-----+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n          |     |Percent.|Percent.|Percent.|Percent.\r\n  495,    | 11.5|  .106  |  1.23  |  3.99  |  3.97\r\n  554,    |  8.4|  .018  |  0.66  |  2.47  |  3.62\r\n  587,    |  5.0|  .053  |  0.47  |  2.25  |  2.84\r\n  613,    | 10.3|  .156  |  0.93  |  2.77  |  3.64\r\n          | ----|  ----  |  ----  |  ----  |  ----\r\n  Average,|  8.8|  .083  |  0.82  |  2.87  |  3.52\r\n  --------+-----+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n          JUICE OF EDIBLE PORTION OF MELON.\r\n  --------+-----+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n   SERIES |     | NITRO- |        |        |REDUCING\r\n     NO.  |BRIX.|  GEN.  |  ASH.  |SUCROSE.| SUGAR.\r\n  --------+-----+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n          |     |Percent.|Percent.|Percent.|Percent.\r\n  495,    | 12.9|  .130  |  1.20  |  6.60  |  2.88\r\n  554,    |  8.2|  .069  |  0.87  |  4.96  |  2.47\r\n  587,    |  5.8|  .043  |  0.50  |  2.26  |  2.57\r\n  623,    | 11.5|  .134  |  0.95  |  5.19  |  2.25\r\n          | ----|  ----  |  ----  |  ----  |  ----\r\n  Average,|  9.6|  .094  |  0.88  |  4.75  |  2.54\r\n  --------+-----+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n\r\n\r\n=Watermelons.=--This is an entirely different variety from the French\r\nmelon or cantaloupe. Its botanical name is _Citrullus citrullus_ L.\r\nFrench, melon d’eau; German, Wasser-Melone; Italian, cocomero, Spanish,\r\nsandia.\r\n\r\nThe watermelon is said to be indigenous to Africa. It is grown\r\nextensively in the United States, especially in the southern part. It\r\nis a field crop of considerable importance, especially in the state\r\nof Georgia. The watermelon grows best on a sandy soil, though it\r\nrequires it to be well fertilized. The vines, when they reach their\r\nfull growth, cover the entire field. The melons often grow to a very\r\nlarge size,--specimens weighing from 50 to 60 pounds being not unusual.\r\nThe average size, however, is much less than that. The Georgia melon\r\nis somewhat oval in shape, reaching generally from a foot to eighteen\r\ninches in length and from a foot to fifteen inches in diameter. The\r\nflesh is generally red and the seeds usually black. The watermelon\r\nis in the market from early summer until the late autumn. It bears\r\nshipping quite well, and is sent usually in box cars without crating,\r\nand, if kept at a low temperature, will remain palatable for many\r\ndays or even weeks. The fresh ripe melon, however, is far superior in\r\nquality to any that are harvested partly green and kept for a long\r\ntime. About forty or fifty varieties of watermelons grow in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Melons._--The following data show the composition of\r\nthe flesh of the muskmelon and the watermelon:\r\n\r\n  Muskmelon:\r\n    Water,                89.50 percent\r\n    Ash,                    .60    „\r\n    Protein,                .60    „\r\n    Fiber,                  .92    „\r\n    Starch, sugar, etc.,   8.20    „\r\n    Fat,                    .18    „\r\n\r\n  Watermelon:\r\n    Water,                91.87 percent\r\n    Ash,                    .33    „\r\n    Protein,                .40    „\r\n    Fiber,                  .55    „\r\n    Starch, sugar, etc.,   6.65    „\r\n    Fat,                    .20    „\r\n\r\nThe above data show that the edible portion of the muskmelon contains\r\nmore nutrient matter than that of the watermelon, the difference being\r\nchiefly in the content of water and carbohydrates.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Okra.=--The French name for okra is gombo; Italian, ibisco; Spanish,\r\ngombo.\r\n\r\nOkra is a vegetable grown very largely in the United States and\r\nespecially valued for use in soup making. For this purpose the young\r\nseed-vessels are employed. The seed pods of the okra are long,\r\ntapering, and rigid by reason of quite sharp angles. The okra is often\r\nknown as gombo or gumbo.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition._--\r\n\r\n  Water,                87.41 percent\r\n  Ash,                    .74    „\r\n  Protein,               1.99    „\r\n  Fiber,                 3.42    „\r\n  Starch, sugar, etc.,   6.04    „\r\n  Fat,                    .40    „\r\n\r\n\r\n=Onion.=--The botanical name of the onion is _Allium cepa_ L. The\r\nFrench name is ognon; German, Zwiebel; Italian, cipolla; Spanish,\r\ncebolla.\r\n\r\nThe onion is a plant which is valued for edible purposes throughout\r\nthe whole world. It is supposed to have been indigenous to Asia, but\r\nits exact origin is not known with certainty. Both the pulp and the\r\npart of the stem immediately attached thereto are edible. In fact\r\nin very young plants the whole plant is edible. Its highly aromatic\r\ncharacter and flavor rather than its nutritive qualities give it its\r\nchief value. The onion is eaten both raw and in various cooked forms.\r\nCooking the onion, especially boiling, expels a large part of its most\r\npungent character, so that the cooked onion does not manifest itself\r\nso unpleasantly in the breath when eaten as is the case with the raw\r\nonion. The onion is also very commonly eaten in this country fried,\r\nespecially with beefsteak. The variety of onions cultivated is legion,\r\nbut they are due rather to different methods of cultivation, etc., than\r\nto botanical character.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition._--\r\n\r\n  Water,                87.55 percent\r\n  Ash,                    .57    „\r\n  Protein,               1.40    „\r\n  Fiber,                  .69    „\r\n  Sugar, starch, etc.,   9.53    „\r\n  Fat,                    .26    „\r\n\r\nThe onion, it is seen, is rather poor in protein but rich in sugar and\r\nallied bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Parsnips.=--The botanical name of the parsnip is _Pastinaca sativa_\r\nL. French, panais; German, Pastinake; Italian, pastinaca; Spanish,\r\nchirivia.\r\n\r\nThe parsnip is nearly related to the carrot in its appearance and also\r\nits properties. The root is usually long and straight and gradually\r\ntapering. It, however, often has other shapes, as is the case with the\r\ncarrot and beet.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition._--\r\n\r\n  Water,                80.34 percent\r\n  Ash,                   1.03    „\r\n  Protein,               1.35    „\r\n  Fiber,                  .53    „\r\n  Sugar, starch, etc.,  16.09    „\r\n  Fat,                    .66    „\r\n\r\nThe above data show that the parsnip is not much richer in nutrients\r\nthan most of the roots grown, except in sugar and starch content. The\r\nlarge quantity of carbohydrates gives it its chief food value. These\r\ncarbohydrates are not by any means all sugar and starch, but include\r\na very considerable proportion of cellulose which is more or less\r\ndigestible.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Peas.=--The botanical name of the pea plant is _Pisum sativum_ L.\r\nFrench pois; German, Erbse; Italian, pisello; Spanish, guisante.\r\n\r\nThe pea is quite as highly valued for table use as the bean, and,\r\nperhaps, is almost as extensively cultivated. The pea, however, is not\r\nusually eaten in the pod. It is probably indigenous to Central Europe,\r\nbut has been so long cultivated that an exact history of its original\r\ndistribution is not known. There are many different varieties of the\r\npea, but the one most highly prized is a small and very sweet pea. The\r\nlarger variety does not have the palatability and other highly prized\r\nedible qualities that distinguish the smaller variety. The pea is found\r\nin the markets of the United States throughout the whole year, being\r\ngrown under cover in the winter time. It becomes an abundant crop from\r\nearly in the spring until very late in the autumn. Immense quantities\r\nof peas are preserved by canning, and in this condition they retain\r\ntheir edible properties almost without impairment throughout the entire\r\nwinter. The pea is valued as a food in many forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition._--\r\n\r\n                                                      STARCH,\r\n                                                       SUGAR,\r\n               WATER.

Even in the green pea nearly four percent of\r\nits weight is protein.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the composition of the pea with that of the bean shows\r\nthat the pea is even more nitrogenous in character than the bean.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Potatoes.=--One of the most important vegetables as well as food\r\nproducts in general is that class of products to which the term\r\npotato is given. The term strictly should apply only to that class\r\nknown as white or Irish potato (_Solanum tuberosum_ L.). The potato,\r\nas indicated by the name, belongs to a family of plants which is\r\nconsidered poisonous, but in the cultivated variety the poisonous\r\nprinciple has been practically eliminated. The potato belongs,\r\nessentially, to the starchy group of foods. If we assume, which is\r\nvery nearly correct, that the average content of water in different\r\nvarieties of potatoes at the time they are most suitable for edible\r\npurposes is 80 percent, it is found that at least three-fourths of\r\nthe remaining solid dry matter is starch. The potato contains a trace\r\nof sugar and notable quantities of other carbohydrates than starch\r\nand sugar, namely, fiber. It also contains a very small proportion of\r\nnitrogen and mineral matter.\r\n\r\nThe potato is grown chiefly in temperate climates. It flourishes\r\nparticularly well in the northern part of Europe, in England, Scotland,\r\nand Ireland, and in the northern portion of the United States. The\r\nnorthern part of Maine, especially, is noted for the production of\r\npotatoes of high edible qualities. It grows very well also in the\r\nsouthern part of the United States. The potato may be produced from\r\nseed, but that method of propagation has long since ceased to be\r\npracticed for agricultural purposes. The potatoes of commerce are\r\nproduced from the eyes of the tubers. The best results in the growth of\r\npotatoes are secured in the loose somewhat sandy soil into which the\r\nroots of the plant can easily penetrate and which gives way readily to\r\nmake place for the growing tuber. Hard, clay soils are unsuited to the\r\ngrowth of this vegetable. The planting is accomplished in the early\r\nspring after a thorough preparation of the seed bed by plowing to the\r\nusual depth, often subsoiling and reducing the surface of the soil\r\nto the proper tilth. The cuttings of potatoes or the whole potatoes\r\nare planted in rows to a depth of two or three inches, where they may\r\nsprout and even reach the surface at a temperature which at times may\r\nfall below the frost point on the surface of the soil. The leaf of the\r\npotato, when it has once appeared above the surface of the soil, is\r\nvery susceptible to the action of frost. If killed at an early stage\r\nit may grow again without replanting. The potato is a crop which the\r\nfarmer may plant early in the spring. There are other varieties which\r\nare planted later, even in the middle of summer, and produce good\r\nresults. The planting season may continue over a period of two or three\r\nmonths. During the growth of the crop by the cultivation of the soil\r\nthe surface is kept in good tilth, the weeds and grass prevented from\r\ngrowing, and the soil gradually drawn up around the growing tubers with\r\nthe hoe or plow in the form of ridges. This heaping up of the soil\r\ntends to promote the development of the tubers, affording them a loose\r\nand more abundant bedding and a greater supply of plant food.\r\n\r\nThe greatest enemies to which the potato crop is obnoxious are found\r\nin the various forms of the potato bug (_Doryphora decemlineata_),\r\nwhich feed upon their leaves. To prevent the ravages of these insects\r\nit becomes necessary to dust over the leaves of the growing plants\r\nsome powerful insecticide which will destroy the life of the insects\r\nfeeding upon them. The active ingredient of these insecticides is\r\nusually arsenic. Fortunately the growing tuber does not absorb, so\r\nfar as known, even traces of arsenic, or at least not more than the\r\nmerest trace, which may be used for insecticidal purposes. It is quite\r\nimpossible in most localities to secure a crop of potatoes without such\r\ntreatment. The alternative is a constant inspection of the growing\r\nplant and the removal and killing of the bugs as they appear, but this\r\nis only practicable over very small areas as its general application\r\nwould increase the cost of the product beyond the reach of the average\r\nconsumer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Yield._--Potatoes are produced in every state and territory of the\r\nUnited States. The statistics for the year ended December 31, 1905,\r\nshow that the total area devoted to potatoes in the United States is\r\n2,996,757 acres. The largest area in any one State is found in New\r\nYork, namely, 428,986 acres, and the smallest area, aside from Arizona,\r\nnot reported, is found in New Mexico, namely, 1,470 acres. The yield\r\nof potatoes for the year is given as 260,741,294 bushels. The largest\r\ntotal yield was in New York, the average yield per acre for the\r\ncountry being 87 bushels. The largest yield per acre is reported from\r\nMaine, namely, 175 bushels, and the smallest from Louisiana and Texas,\r\nnamely, 64 bushels per acre. The average price per bushel for the whole\r\ncountry at the farm is 61.7 cents, making the total value of the crop\r\n$160,821,080. The highest price per bushel was obtained in Florida,\r\nnamely, $1.20, and the lowest price per bushel in Nebraska, namely, 37\r\ncents. The weight of a bushel of potatoes is 60 pounds. As the average\r\namount of fermentable matter in potatoes grown in the United States\r\nis 20 percent, the total weight of fermentable matter in a bushel of\r\npotatoes is 12 pounds, which would yield approximately 6 pounds or 3.6\r\nquarts of alcohol.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition.--Starch content:_ The quantity of starch in American\r\ngrown potatoes varies from 15 to 20 percent. Probably 18 percent might\r\nbe stated as the general average of the best grades of potatoes. In\r\nthis connection it must be remembered that at the present time potatoes\r\nare grown in the United States chiefly for table use. Generally, only\r\nthe imperfect or injured samples are used for stock feeding or for\r\nstarch making, and this condition will probably continue as long as\r\ngood edible potatoes bring a higher price for table use than can be\r\nobtained by utilizing them for starch or for feeding purposes.\r\n\r\nUnder the microscope the granules of potato starch have a distinctive\r\nappearance. They appear as egg-shaped bodies on which, especially\r\nthe larger ones, various ring-like lines are seen. With a modified\r\n(polarized) light under certain conditions of observation a black\r\ncross is developed upon the granule. It is not difficult for an expert\r\nmicroscopist to distinguish potato from other forms of starch by\r\nits appearance, which is well shown in Figs. 39 and 40. Many of the\r\ngranules are quite large, and most of them are ovoid in shape.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of protein in the potato is quite low compared with that\r\nof cereal foods; in round numbers it may be said to be 2.5 percent. The\r\npotato contains very little material which is capable of fermentation\r\naside from starch and sugars.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sugar content:_ Although the potato is not sweet to the taste in a\r\nfresh state, it contains notable quantities of sugar. This sugar is\r\nlost whenever the potato is used for starch-making purposes, but is\r\nutilized when it is used for the manufacture of industrial alcohol.\r\nThe percentage of sugar of all kinds in the potato rarely goes above 1\r\npercent. The average quantity is probably not far from 0.35 percent,\r\nincluding sugar, reducing sugar, and dextrin, all of which are soluble\r\nin water. In the treatment of potatoes for starch making therefore it\r\nmay be estimated that 0.35 percent of fermentable matter is lost in the\r\nwash water.\r\n\r\nOne German author, Saare, claims to have found much larger quantities\r\nof sugar in potatoes than those just mentioned. The minimum quantity\r\nfound by this author is 0.4 percent, and the maximum 3.4 percent,\r\ngiving a mean of 1.9 percent. Ten varieties of potatoes used for the\r\nmanufacture of industrial alcohol were examined in the securing of\r\nthese data. It appears that some varieties have a greater tendency to\r\nproduce sugar than others. The German variety known as “Daber” contains\r\nthe smallest quantities of sugar, while the variety known as “Juno”\r\ncontains the largest quantities. The percentages of sugar, as reported\r\nby Saare, however, are larger than those reported by other observers,\r\nand probably are larger than are usually found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--POTATO STARCH (× 200).--(_Courtesy Bureau of\r\nChemistry._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--POTATO STARCH UNDER POLARIZED LIGHT (×\r\n200).--(_Courtesy Bureau of Chemistry._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Average composition:_ Frazier, of the Cornell station, has collected\r\nanalyses of a large number of different varieties of potatoes, and\r\nfinds them to have the following average composition:\r\n\r\n  Water,               75.00 percent\r\n  Starch,              19.87    „\r\n  Sugars and dextrin,    .77    „\r\n  Fat,                   .08    „\r\n  Cellulose,             .33    „\r\n  Ash,                  1.00    „\r\n\r\nThe following analyses show in detail the composition of potatoes from\r\ndifferent localities:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Analysis of Maine potatoes:_ The Bureau of Chemistry a few years\r\nago made an investigation in connection with the experiment station\r\nin Maine of the composition of potatoes grown in that state used for\r\ntable purposes and for starch making.

As\r\na portion of the cellulose may also become a source of alcohol, it is\r\nobserved that the average percentage of fermented matter in the French\r\npotato used for industrial purposes is not far from 20 percent.\r\n\r\nThe following varieties show a variation in starch content of 6.8\r\npercent, the minimum being 15.9 and the maximum 22.7 percent:\r\n\r\n  Red starchy,            22.7 percent of starch\r\n  Shaw,                   20.5    „         „\r\n  Institute of Beauvais,  17.7    „         „\r\n  Kernours,               17.9    „         „\r\n  White Elephant,         16.0    „         „\r\n  British Red,            16.0    „         „\r\n  Giant Blue,             15.9    „         „\r\n\r\n\r\n_Analysis of Potatoes from German Sources._--_Average composition and\r\nstarch content:_ The content of starch in potatoes examined in the\r\nlaboratory of the Association of German Spirit Manufacturers during\r\nthe year 1905 varied from 12.1 to 25.1 percent. Eleven percent of the\r\ntotal number examined contained between 12 and 14 percent of starch, 20\r\npercent between 14 and 16 percent of starch, 13 percent between 16 and\r\n18 percent of starch, 24 percent between 18 and 20 percent, 24 percent\r\nalso between 20 and 22 percent, and 8 percent between 22 and 25.1\r\npercent.\r\n\r\nThese data show that 56 percent of the total number of samples\r\nexamined contained between 18 and 25 percent of starch. It is evident,\r\ntherefore, that the general average content of starch in the potatoes\r\nused in the German distilleries is not far from 18 to 20 percent.\r\n\r\nThe mean composition of potatoes as given by three German authorities,\r\nnamely, König, Lintner, and Wolff, is as follows:\r\n\r\nAVERAGE ANALYSIS OF POTATOES BY THREE GERMAN AUTHORITIES.\r\n\r\n                      KÖNIG.

The potatoes used for the manufacture of alcohol in\r\nGermany are not of the variety raised for edible purposes. In a large\r\nnumber of experiment stations in Germany systematic efforts have been\r\nmade for many years to grow a potato rich in starch without respect\r\nto its edible qualities. These potatoes are coarser in structure and\r\nless palatable than those grown for the table. The object of the\r\ncultivation of this class of potatoes is to produce as much starch and\r\nother fermentable matters per acre as possible. It is evident that our\r\nown experiment stations should undertake work of a similar character\r\nif the potato is to be used to any great extent in the manufacture of\r\nindustrial alcohol. There is no doubt of the fact that success equal to\r\nthat attained by the German experimenters will attend any systematic\r\nefforts of this kind in our country. Not only will larger crops per\r\nacre of potatoes be grown, but these potatoes will contain larger\r\nquantities of starch and other fermentable substances. If the crop of\r\npotatoes is to remain at the present average, namely, less than 100\r\nbushels per acre, profitable returns for alcohol making can not be\r\nexpected, either by the farmer or by the manufacturer. A much larger\r\nquantity must be grown and, if possible, at less expense, in order that\r\nencouraging profits may be realized.\r\n\r\nMaercker, one of the most celebrated of German authors, states that\r\nin certain instances the potato in Germany reaches a very high starch\r\ncontent. Some varieties, in exceptional instances, have shown as high\r\nas 29.4 percent, 28.1 percent, and 27.3 percent, respectively. In\r\nwarm, dry seasons potatoes often are found containing from 25 to 27\r\npercent of starch. According to Maercker, the sugar content, including\r\nall forms of sugar, varies greatly. Perfectly ripe potatoes contain\r\ngenerally no sugar or only a fractional percentage. When potatoes are\r\nstored under unfavorable conditions, large quantities of sugar may be\r\ndeveloped, amounting to as high as 5 percent altogether. In general, it\r\nmay be stated that the content of sugar of all kinds will vary from 0.4\r\npercent to 3.4 percent, according to conditions.\r\n\r\nWhile potatoes grown thus to increase the content of starch are not\r\ngenerally used as food, yet they are nutritious but not as palatable as\r\nthose grown especially for table purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ash analyses:_ The mineral matters which the potato extracts from the\r\nsoil or from the fertilizers which are added thereto consist chiefly\r\nof phosphate of potash. The mean average composition of the ash of the\r\npotato is shown in the following table:[31]\r\n\r\n  Potash (K₂O),            60.37 percent\r\n  Soda (Na₂O),              2.62    „\r\n  Lime (CaO),               2.57    „\r\n  Magnesia (MgO),           4.69    „\r\n  Iron oxid (Fe₂O₃),        1.18    „\r\n  Phosphoric acid (P₂O₅),  17.33    „\r\n  Sulfuric acid (SO₃),      6.49    „\r\n  Silicic acid (SiO₂),      2.13    „\r\n  Chlorin,                  3.11    „\r\n\r\n  [31] Maercker, “Handbuch der Spiritusfabrikation,” p. 99.\r\n\r\nThis analysis was made upon the so-called pure ash, deprived of its\r\nunburned carbon, and freed of sand and carbon dioxid.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Effect of fertilization on the yield and starch content:_ Experience\r\nin Germany has shown not only that liberal fertilization with nitrogen\r\nis favorable to the production of a large crop of potatoes, but also\r\nthat this is accomplished without decreasing the percentage of starch\r\ntherein. The following table shows the increase in yield, percentage of\r\nstarch, and amount of starch obtained by nitrogen fertilization, the\r\nresults being expressed in hectares[32] and kilograms:\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF NITROGEN FERTILIZATION ON YIELD AND STARCH CONTENT OF\r\nPOTATOES.\r\n\r\n  ---------------+-------------------------+-------------------------\r\n                 |    WITHOUT NITROGEN.    |     WITH NITROGEN.\r\n                 +-------+--------+--------+-------+--------+--------\r\n                 |       |  Yield |  Yield |       |  Yield |  Yield\r\n                 |       |   of   |   of   |       |   of   |   of\r\n                 |       | tubers | starch |       | tubers | starch\r\n    VARIETY OF   |       |   per  |   per  |       |   per  |   per\r\n      POTATO.    |Starch.|hectare.|hectare.|Starch.|hectare.|hectare.\r\n  ---------------+-------+--------+--------+-------+--------+--------\r\n                 | Per-  |  Kilo- |  Kilo- | Per-  |  Kilo- |  Kilo-\r\n                 | cent. | grams. | grams. | cent. | grams. | grams.\r\n  ---------------+-------+--------+--------+-------+--------+--------\r\n  Seed,          | 18.01 | 20,900 |  3,780 | 18.17 | 24,870 | 4,507\r\n  Champion,      | 21.33 | 19,510 |  4,152 | 21.48 | 24,470 | 5,233\r\n  Imperator,     | 19.00 | 22,560 |  4,235 | 18.70 | 26,830 | 5,007\r\n  Magnum Bonum,  | 18.41 | 19,170 |  3,522 | 18.07 | 22,510 | 4,057\r\n  Aurelie,       | 19.47 | 18,950 |  3,653 | 19.75 | 23,550 | 4,609\r\n  Reichskanzler, | 22.78 | 14,300 |  3,236 | 22.61 | 17,250 | 3,875\r\n  Juno,          | 19.33 | 17,590 |  3,422 | 19.92 | 20,900 | 4,199\r\n  Amaranth,      | 22.47 | 16,180 |  3,619 | 22.84 | 18,310 | 4,188\r\n  Charlotte,     | 19.42 | 17,041 |  3,305 | 19.67 | 20,774 | 4,081\r\n  Gelbfleischige |       |        |        |       |        |\r\n  Zwiebel,       | 19.97 | 19,888 |  3,946 | 19.91 | 21,772 | 4,323\r\n  Dabersche,     | 21.82 | 17,377 |  3,778 | 21.80 | 20,313 | 4,399\r\n  Weissfleischige|       |        |        |       |        |\r\n  Zwiebel,       | 20.51 | 16,877 |  3,442 | 20.58 | 19,501 | 3,936\r\n  Schneerose,    | 18.84 | 19,653 |  3,724 | 18.66 | 22,343 | 4,186\r\n  Nassengrunder, | 19.08 | 19,701 |  3,725 | 22.12 | 21,889 | 4,813\r\n  Gelbe Rose,    | 21.09 | 16,847 |  3,547 | 20.60 | 20,177 | 4,129\r\n  Hortensie,     | 17.72 | 22,416 |  3,907 | 17.45 | 26,381 | 4,532\r\n  Richter’s Lange|       |        |        |       |        |\r\n  Weisse,        | 19.37 | 22,134 |  4,267 | 19.19 | 24,490 | 4,664\r\n  Rosalie,       | 18.27 | 19,866 |  3,557 | 18.25 | 22,186 | 4,003\r\n  Achilles,      | 21.02 | 18,886 |  3,962 | 20.93 | 20,913 | 4,376\r\n  Alcohol,       | 16.47 | 16,270 |  2,673 | 16.31 | 20,339 | 3,327\r\n                 +-------+--------+--------+-------+--------+--------\r\n    Average,     | 19.77 | 18,806 |  3,673 | 19.85 | 21,998 | 4,332\r\n  ---------------+-------+--------+--------+-------+--------+--------\r\n\r\n  [32] 1 hectare = 2.471 acres. 1 kilogram = 2.205 pounds.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the data given in the table that the liberal\r\napplication of nitrogenous fertilizers increases the yield per\r\nacre of tubers and of starch to a very marked extent, although the\r\naverage percentage of starch present is increased very little.\r\nConverting the average data given in the foregoing table into their\r\nequivalents in pounds per acre, we have the following results: Without\r\nnitrogen--yield of tubers, 16,781 pounds per acre; yield of starch,\r\n3,277 pounds per acre.

It is used in many countries almost\r\nexclusively in the production of starch for the laundry and for general\r\ndomestic uses.\r\n\r\nThe potato is not very extensively used for starch production in the\r\nUnited States except in the state of Maine and perhaps in one or two\r\nother localities. The starch of the potato has a particular value for\r\nuse in the textile industry in the sizing of cloth. Practically all of\r\nthe potato starch which is produced in the United States is devoted to\r\nthat purpose, and for this reason it brings a higher price than the\r\nordinary starch made of Indian corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Technique of the Production of Starch from Potatoes._--There is\r\nscarcely any manufacturing process which is more simple in its method\r\nthan the manufacture of starch from potatoes. The process consists\r\nsimply in the rasping or grinding of the potato to a fine pulp, which\r\nis afterward placed upon sieves in a thin layer and sprinkled with\r\nwater which detaches the starch granules from the pulp matter, carries\r\nthem through the sieve, and thus separates them from the fibrous\r\nportion.\r\n\r\nIt will be interesting to the general reader, on account of the\r\nimportance of this product, to give a brief description of the method\r\nemployed and the results obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Potato Starch._--In this country potato starch is manufactured\r\nchiefly in Maine, Wisconsin, and Colorado. The factories are of a\r\nvery primitive type, the machinery consisting of a rasper constructed\r\nusually by wrapping a wooden cylinder with sheet-iron punctured so\r\nthat the ragged edges of the hole are on the exterior surface as shown\r\nin Fig. 41. Water is added at the time of rasping, and the starch\r\npulp goes onto gauze shaking tables where the starch grains are washed\r\nthrough the sieve, as indicated in Figs. 42 and 43. The separated\r\nstarch and water go into settling tanks. Where the starch has settled\r\ninto a firm mass it is broken up and sent to the drying kiln. Potato\r\nstarch is highly prized as a sizing in the textile industry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--RASPING CYLINDER FOR MAKING STARCH.--(_Courtesy\r\nDepartment of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--SHAKING TABLE FOR SEPARATING THE STARCH FROM\r\nTHE PULPED POTATO.--(_Courtesy Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Use of the Potato in the Manufacture of Spirits._--A much more\r\nimportant technical use of the potato is in the manufacture of\r\ndistilled spirits. Distilled spirits made from the potato are not\r\ngenerally used for potable purposes but are devoted to industrial\r\nuses. In the United States, very little if any distilled spirits are\r\nmade from the potato. In Europe, however, especially in Germany, the\r\nindustry is one of great magnitude. Practically all of the industrial\r\nspirits used in Germany and in many parts of Europe are made from\r\nthe potato. The process is a simple one. The pulp of the potato, or\r\nstarch, separated therefrom is subjected to the action of malt or other\r\ndiastatic action for the purpose of converting the starch into sugar.\r\nIn some cases this conversion takes place by more strictly chemical\r\nmeans, namely, by heating the pulpy matter or the starch separated\r\ntherefrom in a proper state of dilution, in contact with an acid at\r\na high temperature and pressure. Hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid\r\nis usually employed for this purpose. The action of the acid converts\r\nthe starch into fermentable sugar, namely, dextrose, a form of sugar\r\ndiffering in its quality and character from that produced by malt\r\nknown as maltose. Both sugars, however, are fermentable to the same\r\ndegree and produce, for equal quantities of sugar, the same quantity of\r\nalcohol. When the starch is converted into sugar by one or the other\r\nof these methods it is subjected to fermentation by an appropriate\r\nquantity of yeast which is of the same family as that used in the\r\nalcoholic fermentation of other saccharine products.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--THE POTATO RASPING CYLINDER ARRANGED FOR\r\nWORK.--(_Courtesy Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\nSpecial characters of yeast, however, are reserved for special\r\npurposes, since the variety of yeast determines to a certain extent\r\nthe character of the secondary products which are formed during\r\nfermentation and thus determine the character, flavor, and aroma of the\r\nfinished product. After the fermentation has been completed the residue\r\nis technically known as beer, and is subjected to distillation for the\r\nseparation of the spirit.\r\n\r\nA description of the process of distillation will be found in the\r\nsecond volume of this manual and is therefore omitted here.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Radish.=--The botanical name of the radish is _Raphanus sativus_ L.\r\nThe French name is radis; German, Radies; Italian, ravanello; Spanish,\r\nrabanito.\r\n\r\nThe radish is a vegetable which is found throughout the whole year in\r\nall the principal markets of the United States, being grown under cover\r\nduring the cold weather. It is ready for market within a short time\r\nafter sowing, so that crop after crop can be grown during the year on\r\nthe same soil. It is most highly prized when it is young, as it tends\r\nto acquire a pungent and bitter taste as it approaches maturity. The\r\ntwo principal varieties grown, as respects the roots, is the one having\r\na long, tapering root, and the other a short, spherical bulb. The\r\nlatter are more prized for eating purposes. There are many varieties\r\ngrown.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Edible Portion._--\r\n\r\n  Water,                           91.8 percent\r\n  Protein,                          1.3    „\r\n  Fat,                              0.1    „\r\n  Sugar, and other carbohydrates,   5.8    „\r\n  Ash,                              0.7    „\r\n\r\n\r\n=Rhubarb.=--The botanical name for rhubarb is _Rheum_ L. The French\r\nname is rhubarbe; German, Rhabarber; Italian, rabarbaro; Spanish,\r\nruibarbo.\r\n\r\nRhubarb is a vegetable which is widely distributed in the United\r\nStates and grows generally very early in the spring. It is a highly\r\nacid plant, and is used chiefly as a sauce and for making pies. It\r\nrequires a very large addition of sugar to make it palatable. It has\r\nmedicinal properties which give it additional value. There are many\r\nvarieties grown. It is a plant that is ready for use very early in the\r\nspring, being available in the farmer’s garden almost before any other\r\nvegetable, and this makes it of still greater value.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Edible Stem._--\r\n\r\n  Water,                92.67 percent\r\n  Ash,                    .94    „\r\n  Protein,                .83    „\r\n  Fiber,                 1.11    „\r\n  Sugar, starch, etc.,   3.26    „\r\n  Fat,                   1.19    „\r\n\r\nThe above data show that the rhubarb is practically valueless as food\r\nand is chiefly condimental. In regard to its nutrients the fat is in a\r\nlarger proportion than in that of almost any other succulent vegetable.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Squash.=--Another variety of the gourd family which is highly prized\r\nas a food product is the squash. It is used in the same manner as the\r\npumpkin, and is highly valued both as a food for man and domesticated\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Flesh of the Squash._--\r\n\r\n  Water,                88.09 percent\r\n  Ash,                   1.72    „\r\n  Protein,                .92    „\r\n  Fiber,                 1.04    „\r\n  Sugar, starch, etc.,   8.05    „\r\n  Fat,                    .18    „\r\n\r\nThe above data show that the squash is a much more nutritive substance\r\nthan the pumpkin. In other respects it is little different in its\r\ncomposition, being only a dryer form of pumpkin.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sweet Potato.=--The vegetable known as sweet potato is known\r\nbotanically as _Convolvulus batatas_ L.\r\n\r\nFrom the name it is seen that the sweet potato does not belong to the\r\nsame botanical family as the potato itself. By reason, however, of its\r\nsimilar condition of growth and, to a certain extent, its chemical\r\ncomposition and uses, the term potato has, in this country at least,\r\nbecome to be universally applied to both, although the prefix “sweet”\r\nis quite commonly used with the sweet potato, whereas if any prefix is\r\nused with the potato, properly so-called, it is the word “white” or\r\n“Irish.” The sweet potato is grown extensively in the United States and\r\nin other respects, agriculturally, may be regarded as complemental to\r\nthe potato.\r\n\r\nWhile the potato grows best in the northern parts of the country and in\r\nmild climates, the sweet potato flourishes in the greatest abundance in\r\nthe southern and warmer portions. In respect to the character of the\r\nsoil the two vegetables are quite similar, both doing best in a sandy\r\nor loose soil, provided it is sufficiently supplied with plant food for\r\nthe use of the growing plant. The sweet potato is a thickened root, and\r\nis propagated almost exclusively by means of shoots called “slips.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Planting and Cultivation._--There is a very distinct difference\r\nbetween the planting of the sweet potato and that of the potato. The\r\nformer are rarely planted in the field where the crop is to mature. It\r\nis quite a universal custom to plant the sweet potato in beds where\r\nthe young growth can be forced both by means of artificial heat and\r\nby a generous mulch of highly nutritious soil. The plants can then\r\nbe set very early in the spring and by the time they are ready to be\r\ntransplanted to the field have acquired a considerable size. When ready\r\nfor transplanting the seed bed is prepared with the same care as that\r\nrequired for the potato. The ridging of the rows, which in the case\r\nof potatoes takes place during cultivation, is accomplished in the\r\ncase of sweet potatoes before planting. If the soil is moist and the\r\ntemperature not too high the young plants are removed from the seed bed\r\nand set on top of the apexes in the formed rows. The cultivation of the\r\nfield during the growth of the crop is sufficient to keep the surface\r\nin good tilth and prevent the growth of weeds, grass, etc. Care must\r\nbe exercised in the cultivation not to draw the earth away from the\r\nridges which have been formed, but to increase their size by drawing\r\nthe earth more and more toward the apex of the ridge. The cultivation\r\nis continued until the growing vines practically cover the surface of\r\nthe soil and thus form a natural mulch, which not only conserves the\r\nmoisture and tilth of the soil but also prevents the growth of weeds\r\nand grass. The sweet potato, in respect of its flavor, is particularly\r\nsensitive to the influence of frost, also the leaves are more sensitive\r\nto frost than those of the potato. If a heavy frost is experienced\r\nbefore the tubers are harvested it is apt to impart an unpleasant taste\r\nto the potato and injure its edible qualities. For this reason, if it\r\nis not possible to harvest the potato before the advent of frost, it\r\nis advisable to cut the vines at the point where they emerge from the\r\nsoil. When this has been done the injurious effects of the frost, above\r\nmentioned, are not experienced. In the southern portion of the country\r\nthe sweet potato is often allowed to remain in the soil during the\r\ngreater part of the winter, and, if the vines are removed, it keeps in\r\nexcellent condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Yield and Composition of the Sweet Potato._--As has already been\r\nmentioned, there is a general resemblance, in so far as chemical and\r\nnutritive properties are concerned, between the sweet potato and the\r\npotato. The sweet potato is usually colored a yellowish tint, due to\r\nthe distribution of more or less xanthophyll throughout its substance.\r\nThe sweet potato also contains notable quantities of cane sugar, to\r\nwhich its name is due. It, however, contains large quantities of starch\r\nand fiber and small quantities of protein, resembling in this general\r\nmanner the potato itself. The sweet potato has not been used in the\r\nUnited States for the making of alcohol. In the Azores great quantities\r\nof sweet potatoes are grown for this purpose, and make an alcohol of\r\nfine quality, which is used to a large extent in fortifying port wines.\r\nThere are large areas in the United States, especially in the Southern\r\nStates, where the sweet potato can be grown in great abundance. The\r\nexperiments at the South Carolina station show that as high as 11,000\r\npounds of sweet potatoes can be grown per acre. The percentage of\r\nstarch is markedly greater than in the white or Irish potato. In all\r\ncases over 20 percent of starch was obtained in the South Carolina\r\nsweet potatoes, and in one instance over 24 percent. As high as 2,600\r\npounds of starch were produced per acre.\r\n\r\nIn addition to starch, the sweet potato contains notable quantities\r\nof sugar, sometimes as high as six percent being present, so that the\r\ntotal fermentable matter in the sweet potato may be reckoned at the\r\nminimum at 25 percent. A bushel of sweet potatoes weighs 55 pounds, and\r\none-quarter of this is fermentable matter, or nearly 14 pounds. This\r\nwould yield, approximately, 7 pounds, or a little over one gallon of 95\r\npercent alcohol. It may be fairly stated, therefore, in a general way,\r\nthat a bushel of sweet potatoes will yield one gallon of industrial\r\nalcohol. The average yield of sweet potatoes, of course, is very\r\nmuch less than that given in the South Carolina reports, where heavy\r\nfertilization was practised. On plots to which no fertilizer was added\r\nthe yield was about 8,000 pounds of sweet potatoes per acre, yielding\r\nin round numbers 1,900 pounds of starch. The quantity of sugar in the\r\n8,000 pounds is about 350 pounds, which, added to the starch, makes\r\n2,250 pounds of fermentable matter per acre. This will yield 1,125\r\npounds of industrial alcohol of 95 percent strength, or approximately\r\n160 gallons per acre.\r\n\r\nThe yield of sweet potatoes in the above computation must be regarded\r\nas exceptionally high. A safer calculation will be based upon the\r\nyield of 100 bushels of sweet potatoes per acre, a little above\r\nthe average of the yield of the potato, or a total of 5,500 pounds\r\nper acre. One-quarter of this amount is fermentable matter--about\r\n1,400 pounds--which would yield, approximately, 700 pounds of 95\r\npercent alcohol, or 100 gallons of 95 percent alcohol per acre. In\r\naddition to the sugar in the form of sucrose, or common sugar, which\r\nthe sweet potato contains, there is also an appreciable amount of\r\nnon-crystallizable sugars. The total sugars in the sweet potato have\r\nnot been overstated in the above estimate. In fact, the contrary,\r\nrather, is true, since the two sugars together probably average about\r\nsix percent of the weight of the potato. If the average quantity\r\nof starch in the sweet potato is 20 percent, which is rather a low\r\nestimate, the total fermentable matter in the sweet potato is 26\r\npercent instead of 25 percent, as estimated above.\r\n\r\nCHANGES IN COMPOSITION OF THE SWEET POTATO OF DIFFERENT VARIETIES ON\r\nSTORING.[33]\r\n\r\nFIRST LOT (November 28).\r\n\r\n

Exp. Sta., Bul. 63, p. 25.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Effect of Storage on Composition._--Experiments have shown that the\r\nquantity of starch diminishes and the quantity of sugar increases on\r\nstoring. Further, it may be stated that in the varieties of sweet\r\npotatoes which are most esteemed for table use there is less starch\r\nand perhaps more sugar than are stated in the above examples. In one\r\ninstance of an analysis made on the 7th of January of stored potatoes,\r\nthe starch had fallen to a little less than 13 percent, while the\r\nsugars had increased to over 11 percent in less than six weeks. The\r\ntotal quantity of fermentable matter, however, as will be seen, had not\r\nbeen greatly changed, although there was probably a slight loss. In the\r\nsouthern agricultural work referred to, the yam and the sweet potato\r\nare considered together. The composition and the changes on keeping are\r\nwell illustrated by the preceding data.\r\n\r\nThe above data apparently are sufficient to show the high value which\r\nattaches to the sweet potato and the yam, not only as edibles, but\r\nespecially for the purpose of making alcohol. It is also seen that the\r\nsweet potato would not be a valuable material for making starch alone,\r\nbecause in starch making the sugar which the sweet potato contains is\r\nlost, whereas in the manufacture of alcohol the sugar and the starch,\r\nas well as any fermentable celluloses or gums in the potato, are\r\nutilized.

(21 varieties).\r\n  Water,           69.00 percent      70.27 percent\r\n  Ash,              1.15    „          1.14    „\r\n  Protein,          2.08    „          2.41    „\r\n  Fat,              1.00    „          0.99    „\r\n  Total sugars,     5.55    „          6.81    „\r\n  Starch, etc.,    24.23    „         24.00    „\r\n  Crude fiber,      2.62    „          1.26    „\r\n\r\nIncluded in the starch of the above data are the substances soluble in\r\nboiling dilute acid and alkali.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Turnip.=--The botanical name of the turnip is _Brassica napus_ L. The\r\nFrench name is navet; German, Herbst-Rübe; Italian, navone; Spanish,\r\nnabo.\r\n\r\nThe turnip is grown very largely in the United States both as a\r\nvegetable and as a field crop for feeding purposes. The turnip used as\r\na vegetable usually has a spherical bulb. It is a crop that grows late\r\nin the autumn. In the central part of the country it is usually sown as\r\na field crop after the harvesting of some of the early crops as, for\r\ninstance, early potatoes, and is ready for harvest late in the autumn,\r\njust before freezing weather begins. Grown as a vegetable, however, it\r\nis grown early as well as late. It has a spicy, pungent taste which\r\nmakes it extremely palatable. It is sometimes eaten raw, but generally\r\nstewed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition._--\r\n\r\n  Water,                90.46 percent\r\n  Ash,                    .80    „\r\n  Protein,               1.14    „\r\n  Fiber,                 1.15    „\r\n  Sugar, starch, etc.,   6.27    „\r\n  Fat,                    .18    „\r\n\r\nThe above data show that the turnip is not a very nutritious vegetable\r\nand that its chief nutrients are carbohydrates.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Yam.=--Another variety of edible root or substance belonging to the\r\nsweet potato class is known as the yam. It is also, like the sweet\r\npotato, particularly suited to growing in the subtropical or warm\r\nclimates. The name yam properly belongs to a tropical root similar\r\nin appearance to the sweet potato but produced by various species of\r\nvines of the genus _Dioscorea_, not belonging even to the same family\r\nas the sweet potato. In the southern United States, however, the name\r\nyam is applied to certain varieties of the sweet potato with large\r\ncoarse stems. It is cultivated extensively in the southern part of the\r\nUnited States, and is valued both as a food for man and specially for\r\ndomesticated animals. The character of the soil, method of planting,\r\nand cultivation are the same as in the case of the sweet potato. It\r\nis particularly valued for fattening the variety of swine so common\r\nin the South, known as the “razor-back” hog. This animal does his own\r\nharvesting, and thus removes from the agriculturist a portion of his\r\nlabor which is not of the most agreeable kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Yams._--The composition of yams does not differ to any\r\nnotable extent from that of the sweet potato.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Uses of the Yam and Sweet Potato._--In addition to the use of\r\nthe yam and sweet potato for human food, reference has already been\r\nmade to their value as food for domesticated animals. These bodies are\r\nparticularly relished by hogs and cattle. The feeding of sweet potatoes\r\nor yams to milk cows insures a healthy condition of the body, and also\r\nimparts to the milk, cream, and butter the distinct amber tint which\r\nis regarded as a mark of excellence. Thus even in the winter months\r\nthe butter which is made from milk produced in this way will have the\r\nlight amber tint, which should distinguish it from the highly tinted\r\nartificially colored product which does so much to bring good butter\r\ninto bad repute. Both sweet potatoes and yams are capable of yielding\r\nabundant supplies of distilled spirits. It is probable that under the\r\nnew law which permits the use of denatured alcohol free of taxation in\r\nthe arts an abundant supply of this product can be secured from the\r\nsweet potato and the yam. There are millions of acres of cheap land of\r\na sandy character in the South Atlantic and Gulf states where potatoes\r\nand yams can be successfully grown under scientific principles of\r\nagriculture. If not needed for food purposes as above mentioned, the\r\nresidue can be very profitably devoted to the manufacture of industrial\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANNED VEGETABLES.\r\n\r\nIt probably will excite no opposition to state that if fresh, succulent\r\nvegetables can be placed upon the table of the consumer they are to be\r\npreferred to the same kind of vegetables preserved in any manner. There\r\nare many circumstances, however, which render it difficult, if not\r\nimpossible, to secure a regular supply of fresh, succulent vegetables\r\nupon the consumer’s table. Those who possess abundant wealth may have\r\na proper supply of vegetables at all seasons of the year without\r\nresorting to any preserving process other than the refrigeration\r\nincident to transportation. But the great majority of consumers must\r\nof necessity adapt themselves to the conditions of the market and\r\nthe proximity of supply. Succulent vegetables properly harvested\r\nand refrigerated may be sent long distances and over a considerable\r\nperiod of time, and reach the consumer in practically the same state\r\nof freshness and palatability as when first harvested. Owing to the\r\nexigencies of intermediary supply and the cost of transportation the\r\ngreat industry of keeping succulent vegetables by sterilization has\r\nbeen founded. Commonly vegetables prepared in this way are known\r\nas “canned” vegetables in this country and “tinned” in England. By\r\navailing himself of this process the consumer, even of moderate means,\r\nis able to command at all seasons of the year and in all locations an\r\nabundant supply of wholesome, fresh, succulent vegetable materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Principles and Process of Canning.=--The sterilization of succulent\r\nvegetables depends upon the same principles as that of meat, already\r\ndescribed. The decay of these vegetable substances is due to the\r\naction of certain ferments, either organic or inorganic, which act as\r\nagents in securing the oxidation and decay of the organic material. If\r\nthe action of these organisms can be prevented or inhibited the food\r\nmaterial will remain for a certain length of time, not yet definitely\r\ndetermined, in an excellent, almost perfect state of preservation and\r\nwithout losing, notably, any of its nutritive or palatable properties.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this manual to describe the technique of\r\ncanning, further than to illustrate the principles thereof in their\r\nrelations to wholesome and nutritive food.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Selection of Materials.=--It is of the highest importance in the\r\ncanning industry, both for the reputation of the manufacturer and the\r\nhealth and comfort of the consumer, that the vegetables selected for\r\ncanning be fresh, free from disease, and prepared in such a way that\r\nall adhering dirt or other foreign substances be excluded. The process\r\nof preparation for canning should begin as soon as possible after the\r\nharvesting of the vegetables, since a delay, especially at the high\r\ntemperature which usually prevails at the time of canning, produces\r\nrapid deterioration, both as respects the quality of the vegetable\r\nand its flavor. After the proper cleaning and preparation of the\r\nfresh vegetables they are next subjected to the process of canning.\r\nIt is then the vegetables are heated to a temperature of, or above,\r\nthat of boiling water for a sufficient length of time to thoroughly\r\ndestroy all the living germs and spores contained therein. The degree\r\nof temperature and the length of time of heating depend upon the\r\nnature of the vegetable substance, the size of its particles and of\r\nthe package and the relative difficulty of preservation. Where only\r\nliving organisms are present the proper temperature is that which will\r\ndestroy the life of the germ. It is well known that spores from which\r\nfermentative germs may be developed are more resistant to the action\r\nof heat than the germ itself. When, therefore, spores of this kind\r\nare present, the temperature of heating must be higher and the time\r\nmore prolonged, or, in lieu of this, the food should be heated on two\r\nor three consecutive days during which time any spores which may have\r\nbeen present will have developed into organisms and been killed. Some\r\nforms of vegetable materials are sterilized much more readily than\r\nothers. For instance, the kernels of green Indian corn are of such a\r\ncharacter and degree of hardness as to resist, with a considerable\r\ndegree of success, the influence of heat on the life of the germs\r\nwhich they contain. In such cases it is customary to previously cook\r\nthe vegetable substance before placing it in the cans. The cans should\r\ncontain enough water to fill the interstices between the particles of\r\nvegetable matter. It is the practice in many instances to add a little\r\nsalt and sometimes also sugar to this liquid. When the can is filled\r\nand closed the sterilizing is best completed by placing it in a strong\r\nboiler, which is then closed and heated by steam under a pressure of\r\ntwo or three atmospheres or even higher, namely, from 30 to 45 pounds\r\nand over per square inch. By heating under pressure in this way the\r\ndevelopment of any pressure in the can due to the production of steam\r\nis counterbalanced by the pressure without the can, so that a swelling\r\nor cracking of the can cannot take place. If the cans are heated\r\nin an open bath of water or brine it is customary to leave a small\r\nperforation in the top of the can through which the combined gas of the\r\ninterior of the can may escape, and this vent is closed by a small drop\r\nof solder applied before or at the time of taking the cans from the\r\nbath. The canning of vegetables may also be done in a small way in the\r\nhousehold and the principle on which this process is based is exactly\r\nthe same as that set forth. The vegetables must be properly prepared,\r\nplaced in the cans, and heated a sufficient length of time to destroy\r\ngerms and spores, and the vent in the can stopped with solder. For\r\nfamily purposes the use of closed boilers for heating is not practical\r\non account of the expense of securing such apparatus. All kinds of\r\nvegetables which are eaten in a cooked state can be preserved by the\r\ncanning process. This cannot be applied, however, to those forms of\r\nvegetables which are eaten raw, such as lettuce, radishes, etc.\r\n\r\nThe principal forms of canned vegetables are described below:\r\n\r\n\r\n=Canned Beans.=--Fresh, green beans used for canning purposes are\r\ngenerally preserved in the pod and not shelled, as is the case with the\r\npea. The raw material should be selected with the same care as that\r\nwhich attends the selection of other vegetable products intended for\r\npreserving purposes. If the pods are small they may be placed whole\r\nin the can. Sometimes they are cut into small lengths in order to fit\r\nbetter in the package. As in the case of peas, the interstices between\r\nthe particles of beans are filled by the addition of a sufficient\r\nquantity of brine of the proper strength to fill the can to the top.\r\nThe process of sterilization is the same as that for other vegetable\r\nsubstances. Cooked beans are also preserved by canning and are often\r\nimproperly called baked beans.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Composition of Typical Samples of Canned Beans.=--The composition of\r\ntypical samples of canned beans is shown in the following table:\r\n\r\n  -------------+------+-----+------+------+-----+------+-----\r\n               |      |     |      |STARCH|     |      |\r\n               |      |     |      |  AND |PRO- |      |\r\n    SUBSTANCE. |WATER.| FAT.|FIBER.|SUGAR.|TEIN.| ASH. |SALT.\r\n  -------------+------+-----+------+------+-----+------+-----\r\n               |  Per-| Per-|  Per-|  Per-| Per-|  Per-| Per-\r\n               | cent.|cent.| cent.| cent.|cent.| cent.|cent.\r\n  String beans,|94.33 | .06 |  .51 | 3.03 | .92 | 1.16 | .80\r\n  Unstringed   |      |     |      |      |     |      |\r\n  beans,       |93.91 | .07 |  .58 | 2.91 |1.14 | 1.40 | .92\r\n  Lima beans,  |79.68 | .30 | 1.16 |13.24 |4.00 | 1.62 | .77\r\n  Canned baked |      |     |      |      |     |      |\r\n  beans,       |67.19 |3.18 | 2.46 |17.88 |7.14 | 2.15 |1.03\r\n  -------------+------+-----+------+------+-----+------+-----\r\n\r\nAs in the case of peas it is noticed that the beans in the hull are\r\nnot a particularly nutritious vegetable in proportion to the quantity\r\nconsumed and that the protein is the most valuable constituent in the\r\ndry matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Canned Beans._--The same adulterations may be found in\r\ncanned beans as in canned peas. No additional remarks, therefore, are\r\nneeded on this point.\r\n\r\nBoth canned peas and beans form condimental, palatable, wholesome, and\r\ndesirable forms of these leguminous vegetables. The great cheapness\r\nwith which they can be grown and the improved method of canning make\r\nit possible to produce these articles of food in quantities, and for\r\na price which bring them within the reach of those even in the most\r\nhumble circumstances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--VIEW OF INDIAN CORN CANNING FACTORY, SHOWING\r\nACCUMULATION OF HUSKS AND COBS.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the manufacturer restores absolute confidence in the purity\r\nof his products by completely excluding all adulterations the trade\r\nin these articles will be greatly increased and immensely greater\r\nquantities thereof consumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Canned Indian Corn.=--In the United States a dish which is very\r\nextensively consumed throughout all parts of the country is one almost\r\nunknown in Europe, namely, succulent Indian corn. In the growth of\r\nIndian corn, at the period when the starch is formed in the grain and\r\nbefore it becomes set or hard, the immature grains make a palatable\r\nand excellent food product. In the appropriate season this delicious\r\nvegetable substance is eaten principally on the cob. A variety of\r\nIndian corn, which has already been described, namely, sweet corn, is\r\nthe one chiefly used for edible purposes in this immature state. The\r\nIndian corn canning industry is a most extensive one in this country.\r\nThe estimate of the number of cans of Indian corn produced during the\r\nyear ended Dec. 31, 1905, is 13,939,683 cases of 24 cans each.\r\n\r\nThe principal centers of the industry are found in the New England\r\nStates, especially in Maine, New Jersey, Maryland, New York, Ohio,\r\nIowa, Illinois, and Indiana. By planting different varieties of Indian\r\ncorn which mature at different ages and extending the planting season\r\nover a long period, the canning season, for instance, in Maryland, may\r\nbe continued from the last of July to the advent of killing frost,\r\nusually the middle or last of October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Technique of the Process._--The ears of sweet Indian corn are plucked\r\nfrom the stalk together with the husks, and brought in wagons in this\r\ncondition to the factory. The husks are removed by hand or machinery\r\nand the ears passed through machinery by means of which, owing to the\r\noperation of knives, the grains are as evenly as possible removed from\r\nthe cob. Care is taken not to cut too close to the cob so as to avoid\r\nmingling any of its particles with the corn. The separated grains are\r\nput into cans, treated with a sufficient quantity of water to fill\r\nthe interstices, soldered, and subjected to sterilization. Nearly all\r\nof these operations are conducted by machinery. The sterilization is\r\noften effected by placing the cans upon an endless conveyer dipping\r\ninto water or brine of the proper temperature and moving slowly through\r\nthis bath at a pace determined by the length and temperature thereof,\r\nso that upon emerging the sterilization is complete. The cans may\r\nalso be heated in closed vessels as already described. A typical view\r\nof a factory employed in the canning of Indian corn is given in the\r\naccompanying illustration, Fig. 44.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Canned Indian Corn._--The composition of canned Indian\r\ncorn varies so greatly that it is only possible to give analyses of a\r\nsomewhat general character, without attempting to express the extremes\r\nof composition which may be found. The immature Indian corn differs\r\nfrom the dry mature variety principally in the following respects:\r\nThere is usually more sugar, as compared with the same amount of dry\r\nsubstance, and less starch and protein than in the matured variety.\r\nIn fact, the constituent which is of chief value in the green Indian\r\ncorn is the natural sugar which it contains. This natural sweetening\r\ncannot be imitated by the addition of sugar although the mixture may\r\nbe made very sweet by this method. There is a delicacy of flavor and\r\na peculiar palatability in the natural sweetness of Indian corn which\r\nmust necessarily be due to the form of combination with other natural\r\ningredients in which the sugar is found, and not solely to the sugar\r\nitself, which is practically ordinary sugar, sucrose, or its inverted\r\nproduct. While there is less starch in the immature kernel of Indian\r\ncorn the starch is in a different physical state. In other words, it\r\nhas not become solidified into aggregates of solid particles. The\r\nstarch in this form also appears to be more palatable, and perhaps\r\nsomewhat more digestible, than in its aggregate and solidified\r\ncondition. As a nutrient the green corn is not so valuable by any means\r\nas its equal weight when dry. The percentage of water in green corn is\r\nmany times as great as in the dry variety. For mere nutritive purposes,\r\ntherefore, it would not be worth while to go to the trouble of canning\r\ngreen Indian corn. Its value is that which is attached to a succulent\r\nfresh vegetable, that is, it is condimental and hygienic as well as\r\nnutritive.\r\n\r\nThe mean analysis of many samples of canned sweet Indian corn is given\r\nbelow:\r\n\r\n  Water,             75.50 percent\r\n  Dry matter,        24.50    „\r\n\r\n  Oil and fat,        1.26    „\r\n  Cellulose,           .79    „\r\n  Ash,                 .93    „\r\n  Salt,                .23    „\r\n  Protein,            3.51    „\r\n  Sugar and starch,  17.58    „\r\n\r\nThese data were obtained on samples bought in the open market, some of\r\nwhich had been artificially sweetened and to some of which starch had\r\nprobably been added. The analysis of the fresh green corn is given on\r\npage 227.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Canned Corn._--Unfortunately many adulterations have\r\nbeen practiced in connection with the canning of Indian corn which,\r\nwhile not extensive or applicable to the great mass of material, have\r\ncast an unjust suspicion on the unadulterated product. The trade in\r\nthis canned product would be vastly increased if the consumer could be\r\nassured that all forms of adulteration had been eliminated from the\r\nindustry. The principal adulterants used are mentioned on page 228, but\r\nthe following additional statements are pertinent:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration with Starch._--In order to make a more creamy liquid\r\nin the can the addition of starch has been largely practiced. There\r\nare two objections to the addition of starch to canned corn. In\r\nthe first place it unbalances the ration and makes it more or less\r\nunwholesome. Starch itself is an unbalanced food product, but Nature\r\nhas so distributed the starches in various foods as to present them in\r\nthe most favorable form for digestion and assimilation, and when this\r\nnatural balance is disturbed by artificial means the result is more\r\nor less injurious to the organs of digestion. There are many persons\r\nto whom starchy foods are not nutritious nor easily digested, and\r\nwhen persons of this kind consume canned Indian corn to which starch\r\nhas been added their health may be injured. The addition of starch,\r\ntherefore, is reprehensible for hygienic reasons. In the second place\r\nit is objectionable because it is deceptive, since the canned product\r\nhas a richer and better appearance to the eye by this addition than it\r\notherwise would have, and because more water can be used in the can.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration with Sugar._--It seems strange to speak of adulterating\r\nwith sugar, and yet the addition of sugar without notice to canned\r\nIndian corn may become an adulteration. It has already been mentioned\r\nthat the nature of Indian corn for canning purposes depends very\r\nlargely upon its natural sugar content, and when corn of the proper\r\nsweet variety is selected the addition of other sweetening material is\r\nunnecessary. The use of sugar, therefore, in connection with canned\r\nIndian corn serves to cover up the defects of a corn whose natural\r\nsweetness is below the standard and thus the consumer is deceived. In\r\naddition to this, attention is also called to the fact already stated\r\nthat no artificial sweetening, even with sugar, can produce that\r\ndelicate and desired saccharine quality which the natural sweet corn\r\npossesses. The addition of sugar, therefore, to canned Indian corn\r\nwithout the notice thereof being plainly stated on the label is not to\r\nbe encouraged.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Addition of Saccharin._--The use of benzoic sulfinid, or, as it is\r\ncommonly known, saccharin, to canned corn unhappily is too often\r\npracticed. This body, which has no relation chemically or hygienically\r\nto sugar, which is not a food, which is wholly indigestible, and which\r\nthe majority of experts regard as harmful to health, should never be\r\nplaced in canned Indian corn, even if its use is notified upon the\r\nlabel. It produces an intense, but not agreeable, sweet taste and\r\nyet one which the unwary consumer would naturally attribute to the\r\nsugar present in the corn itself. Thus the consumer is deceived, and\r\nat the same time he is consuming a drug which has valuable uses in\r\nmedicine but which should only be administered with the consent and\r\nby the advice of a physician. It is believed that under the scrutiny\r\nof municipal, state, and national inspection the use of saccharin in\r\nfood products will disappear. Moreover, the name saccharin itself\r\nis misleading. It is an application of a word which by common usage\r\nis attributed to natural sugar substances to a substance which has\r\nno relation of any kind to sugar. The use of a word of this kind is\r\nevidently objectionable. The canner himself who uses this product often\r\nbuys it under another name, which gives no indication of its true\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Character of the Cans._--It is important that the containers in which\r\ncanned vegetables are preserved should be of a character to yield no\r\npoisonous or injurious substance to the contents therein. What is said\r\nhere in respect of canned Indian corn is generally applicable to canned\r\nproducts of all descriptions.\r\n\r\nThe approved standards for food products in the United States require\r\nthe following properties for the containers:\r\n\r\n  “I. Suitable containers for keeping moist food products such\r\n  as sirups, honey, condensed milk, soups, meat extracts, meats,\r\n  manufactured meats, and undried fruits and vegetables and wrappers in\r\n  contact with food products contain on their surfaces, in contact with\r\n  the food products, no lead, antimony, arsenic, zinc, or copper or\r\n  any compounds thereof or any other poisonous or injurious substance.\r\n  If the containers are made of tin plate they are outside soldered\r\n  and the plate in no case contains less than one hundred and thirteen\r\n  (113) milligrams of tin on a piece five (5) centimeters square or one\r\n  and eight-tenths (1.8) grains on a piece two (2) inches square. The\r\n  inner coating of the containers is free from pin-holes, blisters, and\r\n  cracks.\r\n\r\n  “If the tin plate is lacquered, the lacquer completely covers the\r\n  tinned surface within the container and yields to the contents of the\r\n  container no lead, antimony, arsenic, zinc, copper, or any compounds\r\n  thereof.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=Souring and Swelling of Canned Corn.=--In all cases where\r\nsterilization is not complete, or where spores remain undestroyed\r\nwhich afterward develop and produce various kinds of ferments, the\r\ncanned corn spoils. The contents usually become sour and acquire a bad\r\ntaste, and, in many cases, on puncturing the container gas escapes.\r\nThe pressure of this gas in the can is sometimes great enough to\r\nproduce a swelling, and hence the technical term “swelled” applied to\r\ncans of this kind. Various forms of ferments are active in producing\r\nthese conditions. The usual alcoholic ferment does not usually occur\r\nby reason of the fact that the yeasts which produce this form of\r\nfermentation are readily destroyed in the sterilizing process. Ferments\r\nwhich produce lactic, butyric, and other acids, and those which act\r\nupon the nitrogenous matter and tend to form various decomposition\r\nproducts are the most common.\r\n\r\nIn the case of canned corn and other canned vegetables the nitrogenous\r\ndecomposed products are not usually very poisonous. On the other hand\r\nin the case of meat, and especially of fish and crustaceans, the\r\ndegradation products from the nitrogen constituents of the food become\r\npoisonous and are known collectively under the name of ptomains.\r\n\r\nIf the sterilization has not been complete at the time of preparation,\r\nsweet corn as well as other foodstuffs in similar circumstances\r\nundergoes a kind of fermentation which renders it unfit for food. The\r\nfermentation is usually due to the greater vitality of spores and\r\nfungi, the real bacteria usually succumbing to the heat of preparation.\r\nVarious gases beside carbon dioxid are produced, causing the corn to\r\nswell. All swelled goods should be rejected for food purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Canned Peas and Beans.=--These leguminous products lend themselves\r\nreadily to canning purposes, and are preserved in great quantities in\r\nthe United States in this way. Peas are always shelled before canning,\r\nand are harvested at a time to secure their greatest succulence. If the\r\npeas be too ripe they make a hard, unpalatable berry which detracts\r\nfrom the value of the canned product. The smaller variety of pea is\r\npreferred to the larger for canning, but, irrespective of size, they\r\nshould be fresh, succulent, and not too mature. In the large canning\r\nfactories the peas are harvested with machines such as are used for\r\nthe cereals. The harvested material is passed through a shelling\r\nmachine, by means of which the pods are opened and the peas separated.\r\nThe rest of the pods, stalks, leaves, etc., are very valuable for\r\ncattle food or fertilizing purposes. Peas, before canning, should be\r\nseparated into different sizes so that all those entering one can may\r\nbe as nearly uniform in size as possible. This separation not only\r\nmakes the contents of the can appear more attractive but also renders\r\nthe sterilization more certain and easy. If a large and small pea are\r\nput in the same can the heat of sterilization must be high enough and\r\ncontinue long enough to sterilize completely the large pea, and this\r\nmight induce an over-cooking and impair the edible properties of the\r\nsmall one.\r\n\r\nThe technique of the canning process is not at all different except in\r\nthe preparation of the material, as described above, from that of other\r\nvegetable canning factories.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Canned Peas._--The composition of typical varieties of\r\ncanned peas compiled from a large number of analyses is shown in the\r\nfollowing table:\r\n\r\n  Water,             85.47 percent\r\n  Fat,                 .21    „\r\n  Fiber,              1.18    „\r\n  Protein,            3.57    „\r\n  Starch and sugar,   7.79    „\r\n  Ash,                1.11    „\r\n  Salt,                .67    „\r\n\r\nFrom the above data it is seen that the canned pea does not have a high\r\nnutritive value, considering its bulk. In the canned pea one of the\r\nprincipal food elements in the wet material is the protein which it\r\ncontains, both the pea and the bean being very rich in this important\r\nfood material.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Canned Peas._--The principal form of adulteration\r\nwhich is practiced in the canning of peas is the addition of sulfate\r\nof copper for the purpose of producing an intense green color. The\r\ndelicate shade of green of the fresh, succulent pea tends to assume a\r\nyellowish tint on canning, and especially after keeping for some time.\r\nTo such an extent does this oxidation of the natural chlorophyl go\r\non that in many samples when opened, instead of a green, we discover\r\na decidedly yellowish tint. When a copper salt, such as sulfate, is\r\nheated in contact with a nitrogenous substance, such as that which\r\nexists in the pea, a chemical combination is formed between the copper\r\nand nitrogenous bodies which has an intensely green tint.\r\n\r\nIt is often supposed that the sulfate of copper is added to canned\r\npeas to preserve their natural color. This, however, is not the case.\r\nThe copper combination, as above mentioned, produces a dye of a very\r\nbright green hue. Sulfate of copper is a highly poisonous substance,\r\nand for this reason should be excluded from food products. It is only\r\nfair to state that those who use this material claim that in the form\r\nof the combination produced it remains insoluble during the process\r\nof digestion, and therefore the copper is inert. This claim is not\r\nsustained by the facts in the case. It is quite certain that the copper\r\nproduct forming the dye or the excess of the copper which is used\r\nremains in a state of very unstable composition which is easily broken\r\nup under the action of the acids and enzymes in the digestive organs.\r\n\r\nIt is greatly to the credit of the canners of the United States that\r\nthe use of sulfate of copper has never come into use in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tests for Copper._--Fortunately the presence of copper in canned peas\r\nis easily ascertained even by the novice. If a portion of the peas be\r\nrubbed in a mortar to a fine paste and mixed with water acidulated with\r\ntwo or three drops of hydrochloric acid, a paste will be formed which\r\non boiling will deposit copper on a clean metallic substance such as\r\nsilver, steel, or iron. If a bright steel knife or a clean iron nail be\r\nplaced in this paste, the surface will soon be covered with metallic\r\ncopper. This simple test shows that the copper is not combined in any\r\nsuch permanent form as is claimed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Saccharin._--The use of saccharin as an imitation of the natural sweet\r\nof the pea is, unfortunately, very largely practiced and is open to the\r\nsame objections as were pointed out in the case of Indian corn. The use\r\nof sugar, salt, and other condimental substances in canned peas cannot\r\nbe regarded as an adulteration unless deception results therefrom. It\r\nis claimed there is no special variety of pea distinguished by its\r\ncontent of sugar, and therefore the addition of sugar does not cause\r\none variety of pea to imitate the properties of another. If this be\r\ntrue no deception is practiced, and, if the sugar is pure, no injury\r\nis done. In all cases of this kind, perhaps, it would be better if the\r\nmanufacturer would plainly mark on the label the name of the added\r\nmaterials. Then there could be no question of the nature of the product.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Canned Tomatoes.=--Next, perhaps, in importance to the industry of\r\ncanned corn, is the preservation of tomatoes. Immense quantities of\r\nthese goods are produced annually in the United States. The technique\r\nof the canning process is not at all different from that of canned\r\ncorn. By reason of the pulpy condition of the material and its freedom\r\nfrom hard and impenetrable matter in the preparation for canning, the\r\nsterilization is accomplished in less time and with greater certainty\r\nthan in the case of Indian corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preparation of the Raw Material._--Only fresh, ripe, mature, and sound\r\ntomatoes should be used in the preparation of the canned goods. These\r\nare delivered by the farmer or contractor in baskets or otherwise to\r\nthe factory. After sorting and rejecting all those that are unfit, the\r\nportions selected for preservation are treated in the usual manner to\r\nsecure sterilization.\r\n\r\nThe skins, cores, and rejected portions of the tomatoes should be\r\nremoved to a sufficient distance from the factory to prevent any bad\r\nodor or danger of infection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Canned Tomatoes._--The chemical composition of canned\r\ntomatoes is shown in the following analysis:\r\n\r\n  Water,             93.59 percent\r\n  Fat,                 .23    „\r\n  Fiber,               .60    „\r\n  Starch and sugar,   3.47    „\r\n  Protein,            1.29    „\r\n  Ash,                 .66    „\r\n  Salt,                .14    „\r\n\r\nFrom the above data it is seen that the tomato is not particularly\r\nvaluable on account of its nutrient properties. It consists chiefly of\r\nwater, and its value as a food product is principally condimental. It\r\nmust not be denied, however, that it has that peculiar value which is\r\npossessed by all edible succulent vegetables and fruits, namely, it is\r\na means of keeping the digestive processes in good form, preventing\r\nconstipation, and promoting the general metabolic activity. In this\r\nsense it is seen that it is more than condimental. It also, of course,\r\nhas a distinct food value, due chiefly to the carbohydrates it contains.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Addition of Sugar and Spices._--Sugar and other condimental substances\r\nare often used in the preparation of tomatoes. In this case it is\r\ndoubtful whether the addition of pure sugar can be regarded in any\r\nsense as an adulteration if properly notified on the label. It is\r\nclaimed that there is no distinction in the classification of tomatoes\r\nbased upon their sugar content. If there was a variety of distinctly\r\nsweet tomato as distinguished from the ordinary field crop, then\r\nthe addition of sugar to the field crop to imitate the sweet of the\r\nnaturally sweet article would be an adulteration. But even in this case\r\nunripe or imperfect tomatoes may be used and sugar added to conceal\r\ninferiority. The use of common condimental substances, such as salt,\r\nspices, vinegar, etc., in the preparation of various products of\r\ntomatoes must be regarded as a perfectly legitimate operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Canned Tomatoes._--Fortunately there are few\r\nadulterations practiced in the case of canned tomatoes. The use of\r\nantiseptics to insure the conservation of the contents of the can was\r\nformerly practiced to some extent, salicylic and benzoic acids being\r\nthe chief antiseptics employed. Since it has been made possible to\r\neasily, speedily, and economically sterilize the contents of the cans,\r\nthe use of antiseptics is practically a thing of the past. The most\r\ncommon adulteration of tomatoes, perhaps, has been artificial coloring.\r\nThe use of artificial coloring is resorted to solely for deceptive\r\npurposes. Where green or immature tomatoes are used, or other portions\r\nand parts of such fruits as are not suitable for the production of\r\nthe highest grade products, the naturally red color of the tomato is\r\nimitated artificially, usually by the addition of cochineal or a coal\r\ntar dye. The use of artificial color in canned tomatoes has almost\r\nceased in this country.\r\n\r\nSaccharin is also sometimes used as an adulterant to imitate the\r\nproperties of pure sugar.\r\n\r\nIt has already been intimated that green or unfit tomatoes or the\r\nresidue of better grades are sometimes prepared and sold as the real\r\narticle. This is a form of adulteration which is most reprehensible.\r\nUnfortunately, except in so far as the artificial color is concerned,\r\nthis adulteration is not readily revealed by either chemical or\r\nmicroscopic examination, although the latter is exceedingly valuable\r\nin detecting certain forms of this kind of material. Only by a rigid\r\ninspection of the factories can this form of adulteration be excluded\r\nwith certainty. The use of such immature fruits or scraps without\r\nnotice to the consumer is, without doubt, an adulteration of an\r\nexceedingly bad type. If there be a desire to make a very cheap grade\r\nof the product out of these materials the nature of them should be\r\nplainly stated upon the label and then, perhaps, there would be a valid\r\nexcuse for their appearance on the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Other Canned Vegetables.=--There is no necessity to enter into the\r\ndetail of the preparation of other canned vegetables further than to\r\nsay that practically all vegetables which are offered on the market,\r\nexcept those which are necessarily eaten in a raw state, are preserved\r\nor can be preserved by the sterilizing process.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tomato Ketchup.=--A sauce which is used in large quantities in the\r\nUnited States and in other countries is known as tomato ketchup and is\r\nmanufactured in many parts of the country. Tomato ketchup is the pulp\r\nof sound, ripe tomatoes mixed with various condimental substances and\r\nflavoring matters to make it palatable and desirable as a sauce. The\r\ncharacter of flavor and condimental substances employed is left to the\r\njudgment of the manufacturer and the taste of the consumer, provided\r\nthe materials are wholesome and sanitary. It has been claimed by some\r\nmanufacturers that it is impracticable to place this desirable product\r\nupon the market without the use of chemical antiseptics. They admit,\r\nas in the case of the manufacture of fruit sirups, that tomato ketchup\r\ncan be sterilized and kept properly until the bottle is opened for\r\nconsumption; but, inasmuch as it is used in small quantities and a\r\nbottle of it lasts for many days, it cannot be kept in a proper state\r\nexcept by the use of such preservatives. The principal antiseptics\r\nwhich are used in connection with tomato ketchup are salicylic and\r\nbenzoic acids.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that these claims are not of sufficient value to\r\nwarrant the exception of tomato ketchup from the ordinary regulations\r\nrespecting pure food. The habit of leaving a tomato ketchup bottle upon\r\nthe table where the material adheres to the rim and becomes hardened to\r\na gummy paste, serving as a pabulum for flies, does not appeal with any\r\ngreat force to the æsthetic sense relative to dining rooms. A ketchup\r\nbottle carefully opened and used in such a way as to avoid infection\r\nand then returned to the ice box can be kept for many days without\r\ndanger of fermentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Artificial Colors._--Tomato ketchup is sometimes subjected to\r\nartificial coloring. This is done to imitate the color of the best raw\r\nmaterial. If red, ripe, sound tomatoes are used no artificial color is\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Use of Refuse for Making Ketchup._--It has been stated that the\r\nripe, imperfect tomatoes at the time of harvesting are cooked in\r\nlarge quantities and treated with benzoic acid and stored in large\r\ncontainers until the canning season is over, after which this material\r\nis made into ketchup and artificially colored. Further statements have\r\nalso been made to the effect that the skins, cores, and refuse of the\r\ncannery have been treated in the same way as indicated below. The\r\nproper inspection of the factories would exclude from the preparation\r\nof ketchup unfit material of the kind mentioned. It is doubtless true\r\nthat when the people are finally convinced that the ketchup which is\r\nused is made of the best material and contains no artificial color or\r\nno harmful antiseptic, its use will be immensely increased.\r\n\r\nA manufacturer of ketchup recently made the following statement\r\nrespecting the utilization of the refuse matter at the cannery:\r\n\r\n“We use in our standard catsup the peelings and small tomatoes. We\r\npreserve the pulp with four ounces of sodium benzoate to each 50 gallon\r\nbarrel, cooked and whipped through a cyclone pulp machine. It takes two\r\nbarrels of this stock to produce 60 gallons of catsup, and we use eight\r\nounces more of sodium benzoate to preserve it.”\r\n\r\nIf waste material of this kind is sound and wholesome, there can be no\r\nvalid objection to its use if the product be offered for sale under its\r\nproper designation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARCHES USED AS FOODS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Edible Starches.=--Attention has already been called to the fact\r\nthat starch is the principal constituent of many of the common foods,\r\nsuch as cereals and the different varieties of the potato and other\r\nvegetables. Starch is often separated from the part of the plant\r\nproducing it, and is then largely consumed as food in practically a\r\npure state. Starches used in this way are presented in the form of\r\npudding or desserts of some kind, and are often richly spiced, highly\r\nsweetened, and often eaten with cream. Starch also appears in the\r\nmarket under other names such as tapioca, arrowroot, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Arrowroot._--The plant which furnishes the substance known as\r\narrowroot belongs to the natural family Cannaceæ and is principally\r\nnative of tropical regions. The most important source of the arrowroot\r\nof commerce is the _Canna indica_. The starch of this plant exhibits in\r\na strong degree certain characteristic qualities of starches derived\r\nfrom this natural family. The hilum in this starch is round and in some\r\nvarieties double. The appearance of this starch under the microscope\r\nis shown in Fig. 45. The product of commerce is obtained from the\r\nrhizome and tubers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bermuda Arrowroot._--The Bermuda arrowroot is obtained principally\r\nfrom the _Maranta arundinacea_. This arrowroot is also produced very\r\nlargely in St. Vincent and other West Indian localities. The granules\r\nof the starch are very much smaller than in the two species just\r\ndescribed. The hilum is prominent, and frequently takes the shape of\r\na well defined slit instead of the usual round spot. These arrowroots\r\nand those of South African origin are very extensively used for invalid\r\nfoods where starchy foods are indicated, which, however, is not\r\nvery often the case. These starches form a firm and semitranslucent\r\njelly-like body when heated to the boiling point in a small quantity\r\nof water. The term arrowroot is applied to starch from plants of the\r\norigin mentioned because the natives of the country producing them use\r\nthe bruised rhizomes as a poultice for wounds caused by arrows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--MARANTA (ARROWROOT) STARCH (× 200).--(_Courtesy\r\nBureau of Chemistry._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Canna edulis._--This species of Cannaceæ also furnishes a starch of\r\ncommerce nearly allied to the _Canna indica_. The common commercial\r\nname of this variety of starch is “Tous les mois.” The starch granules\r\nof this species are rather larger than those of the _Canna indica_, and\r\nthe concentric markings are more delicate and regular.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Madagascar Arrowroot._--There is also produced in Madagascar an\r\narrowroot from a different form of plant, namely _Tacca pinnatifida_.\r\nIt is not, however, of any very great commercial importance. A similar\r\nstarch is made from the same plant in Otaheite.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plantain Meal._--The plants of the natural family Musaceæ are\r\nimportant articles of food in many tropical regions, the plant\r\nyielding also, in addition to the starch, fibers suitable for textile\r\nuse. The fruit of the _Musa paradisiaca_ is chiefly employed for\r\nthis purpose. It is quite similar in its character to the fruit of\r\nthe allied species, _Musa sapientum_, or common banana. The starch\r\ngranules which make up the plantain meal are remarkable for their long\r\nand narrow shape. The lines marking their surface are only faintly\r\ndistinguishable, and the hilum is small and somewhat indistinct.\r\nPlantain meal is not used to any very great extent outside of the\r\ncountry where it is produced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.--A CASSAVA FIELD IN GEORGIA.--(_Photograph by\r\nH. W. Wiley._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sago._--Another form of starch which has a high value as a food\r\nproduct is made from the natural family Palmaceæ. The palm starch or\r\nsago is consumed in immense quantities in many parts of the world, and\r\nis probably in importance only second to the starch derived from the\r\ncereals as human food. The starch granules are rather large and coarse,\r\nalthough very many small granules are found mixed with them. Some of\r\nthe larger granules appear to be partially divided or broken. The hilum\r\nis distinct and very long. The sago of commerce is like a tapioca\r\nmade from the palm starch. It has been subjected to heat while still\r\nmoist in the process of manufacture, so that it is quite difficult,\r\nas a rule, to find the distinct starch granules of the palm in the\r\ncommercial article. Sago is grown principally in the Moluccas and\r\nSumatra.\r\n\r\n\r\n_South African Arrowroot._--There are many species of Marantaceæ\r\ncultivated in South Africa from which arrowroot is manufactured. They\r\nare of the same variety as that used in Bermuda and the West Indies.\r\nThe cultivation of the plant has modified to some extent the action\r\nof the starch granules as originally found in the uncultivated plant.\r\nThe starch granules in the cultivated variety approach more nearly a\r\nspherical form. The concentric lines are much more distinct and the\r\nhilum more prominent than in the wild variety.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tapioca._--The most important of the starch products used as food is\r\nthe tapioca. It is made from the plant belonging to the natural family\r\nEuphorbiaceæ, and is derived particularly from the variety of cassava\r\nplant known as _Manihot_. Attention has been called to the fact that\r\nmany of the varieties of cassava plant are highly poisonous, due to\r\nthe natural development during growth of hydrocyanic acid, one of the\r\nmost violent of known poisons. This substance, however, is of quite\r\na volatile character, and when comminuted cassava root is heated or\r\nboiled, all or at least the principal part of the hydrocyanic acid\r\n(prussic acid) disappears. None of it or at least not more than a trace\r\nis found in the food product tapioca. A comparatively sweet variety of\r\ncassava that is containing but a small proportion of prussic acid is\r\ngrown in Florida and Georgia. The appearance of a field of cassava is\r\nshown in Fig. 46. The tapioca of commerce is prepared by the separation\r\nof the starch in the usual way by grinding and washing with water.\r\nBefore the starch becomes dry, in fact, while it is still containing\r\nits maximum degree of moisture, it is submitted to heat first at a\r\nlow temperature, gradually increased until the starch granules are\r\ndisintegrated or agglutinated into a somewhat firm and gelatinous mass.\r\nThe heat is then continued at the proper temperature until the water is\r\nnearly all driven off. The starch from this plant is sometimes known as\r\nBrazilian arrowroot.\r\n\r\nThe starch granules of the bitter cassava are very small and often\r\nangular in shape, although some of them appear as well rounded\r\nspheroids. The hilum is, as a rule, clearly distinguished. The\r\nmicroscopic appearance of the grains of cassava starch is shown in Fig.\r\n47.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Tapioca._--The true tapioca should only be made from\r\nstarch of the cassava. Any starch, derived from any source whatever,\r\nif taken in the moist state may be subjected to the same process of\r\nheating, and forms an imitation tapioca which possesses many of the\r\nphysical and probably all of the edible properties of the genuine\r\narticle. The substitution, however, of any of the other starches for\r\nthat of the cassava is at least an imitation, if not an adulteration,\r\nof the genuine article.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.--CASSAVA STARCH (× 200).--(_Courtesy Bureau of\r\nChemistry._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Food Starches Derived from Cereals._--The starches which are derived\r\nfrom the common cereals are also extensively used as food products,\r\nespecially the maize starch in the United States. It is commonly\r\nsold as “corn” starch, and is largely used for the purpose already\r\nmentioned. It may be in its natural state or it may be previously\r\nsubmitted to the action of heat while still moist, so that it takes\r\non the character of tapioca or sago. In the United States the Indian\r\ncorn is practically the only cereal which furnishes the food starch in\r\nvery large quantities, although rye starch is extensively used for this\r\npurpose in other countries.\r\n\r\nThe starches of certain of the legumes, such as peas and beans, have\r\nalso been separated and used for food purposes. They are not, however,\r\nused to any such extent as would warrant any especial reference to\r\nthem at this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Starch from the Peanut._--The peanut also yields a starch which has\r\nsometimes been separated and used for food purposes. The quantity so\r\nemployed, however, is of no consequence as far as magnitude of product\r\nis concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Food Starch Derived from the Potato._--Potato starch is also used\r\nvery extensively for food purposes, either in its natural form or when\r\nsubjected to heat while still moist, as in the preparation of tapioca\r\nand sago.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Starches._--The most common adulteration of starches\r\nis rather a misbranding than adulteration. The practice of adding inert\r\nwhite powdered mineral matters to starches is practically unknown\r\nin this country. Starch sometimes contains sulfurous acid used as a\r\nbleach in its preparation. This is an injurious substance and should\r\nbe excluded from edible starches. The naming of a starch of one kind\r\nby the name of another and more valuable kind is simple deception. It\r\nis practiced to some extent in this and other countries. Starch itself\r\nmay be used as an adulterant, as when maize starch is mixed with wheat\r\nflour or powdered starch mixed with granulated sugar. This kind of\r\nadulteration is quite unknown in this country. The selling of cheaper\r\nstarches for tapioca and sago is more common than it should be.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDIMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Condiments other than Sugar, Salt, Vinegar, and Wood Smoke.=--The\r\nprincipal condimental substances which are used for food are of\r\nvegetable origin and of a highly aromatic character. Condimental\r\nsubstances themselves may have food value, that is, contain digestible\r\nmaterial which takes part in the metabolic processes. Their utility,\r\nhowever, and their value do not depend upon the amount of food which\r\nthey contain, but upon their aromatic and condimental principles above\r\nmentioned. Condimental substances are used in a variety of ways, but\r\nin general it may be said that in an air-dried state they are reduced\r\nto a fine powder and employed in this way. Extracts may also be made\r\nfrom these condimental substances, either with water or usually with\r\nalcohol, and this extractable matter used as a condiment. The essential\r\noils which they contain are also frequently separated by distillation,\r\nand in this purified and concentrated state are, after dilution with\r\nalcohol, used for condimental purposes. Peppermint oil is a type of\r\nthis character of condiments.\r\n\r\nIt will be sufficient for the purpose of this manual to mention the\r\nprincipal condimental substances and refer for the character of their\r\ncomposition to the standards of purity established for them under\r\nauthority of Congress in Appendix A.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Allspice_, also known as pimento, is the dried fruit of the _Pimenta\r\npimenta_ L.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anise._--The anise is a plant which grows from 14 to 16 inches in\r\nheight. Its botanical name is _Pimpinella Anisum_ L. French, anis;\r\nGerman, Anis; Italian, aniso; Spanish, anis.\r\n\r\nThe anise produces abundant seeds, which are the principal condimental\r\npart. The seeds are used either directly in bread and other foods or\r\nespecially in the manufacture of liqueurs and confections. Anise seed\r\nis one of the oldest of condimental substances of which historical\r\naccount has been preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bay leaf_ is the dried leaf of the _Laurus nobilis_ L. In a powdered\r\nform it is used as a condimental substance in food, but it is chiefly\r\nemployed in flavoring alcohol in the manufacture of the material known\r\nas bay rum.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Capers._--The capers are obtained by drying the flower buds of the\r\ncaper bush. The botanical name is _Capparis spinosa_ L. French,\r\ncaprier; German, Kapernstrauch; Italian, cappero; Spanish, alcaparra.\r\n\r\nThe caper is a plant which is a native of southern Europe of shrub-like\r\nproportions, growing to a height of from three to five feet. The\r\nflower buds are gathered when they are about as large as peas and are\r\npreserved by pickling in vinegar.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Caraway._--This is a plant which is native to Europe, is either annual\r\nor biennial, and belongs to the botanical species _Carum Carvi_ L.\r\nFrench, carvi; German, Feld-Kümmel; Italian, carvi; Spanish, alcaravea.\r\n\r\nThe seeds contain the aromatic principles which make the caraway\r\nvaluable as a condiment. The plant often grows wild. The roots have\r\nsome value as food and are also highly spiced, but are seldom eaten.\r\nThe seeds are used very largely for flavoring bread, especially among\r\nthe Germans. They are also used in certain varieties of cheese,\r\nespecially that made in Holland. Often they are found in certain\r\ncandies and other confections.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cassia_ is that variety of cinnamon obtained from other species of\r\ncinnamon than _Cinnamomum zeylanicum_, and is not so highly valued for\r\ncondimental and other purposes as the true cinnamon.\r\n\r\nCassia buds, which are often used for condimental purposes, are the\r\ndried immature fruit of any species of the cinnamomum plant. The\r\ncinnamon, as it is offered for condimental purposes, is usually finely\r\nground, and the same is true of cassia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Celery Seed._--The seeds of celery are highly prized for condimental\r\npurposes, either directly or in the form of an extract. The seeds or\r\ntheir extracts are also often recommended for medicinal purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cinnamon._--The cinnamon is the bark of various species of plants\r\nbelonging to the genus _Cinnamomum_. The true cinnamon is derived\r\nsolely from the bark of _Cinnamomum zeylanicum_ Breyne.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cloves._--Cloves are dried buds of the _Caryophyllus aromaticus_ L.\r\nThey are used either in the original dried state or as a finely ground\r\npowder.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coriander._--The aromatic principles of coriander which is used for\r\ncondimental purposes are the dried seeds of the _Coriandrum sativum_\r\nL. This is a plant which is indigenous to southern Europe, growing\r\nfrom two to two and a half feet high. The seeds are used in the\r\nmanufacture of liqueurs and for seasoning a great number of culinary\r\npreparations. It is stated by some authorities that the leaves are used\r\nfor condimental purposes, but this is not the case. The leaves as well\r\nas the other green parts of this plant have a very unpleasant odor from\r\nwhich the name of the plant is derived. This odor is of a character\r\nwhich would exclude the leaves from use for condimental purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cumin Seed._--The cumin plant (_Cuminum Cyminum_ L.) is thought to\r\nbe indigenous to Egypt. It is an annual plant, sometimes growing from\r\nfour to five inches high. The seeds are the aromatic part and are used\r\nfor condimental purposes. They have a hot, acrid taste and a strong\r\naromatic flavor. They are used chiefly for flavoring soups and in the\r\nmanufacture of pastry of all kinds. They are also found in many kinds\r\nof liqueurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dill._--The dill plant (_Anethum graveolens_ L.) is indigenous to\r\nsouthern Europe. It is an annual plant and grows from two to two and a\r\nhalf feet high. The seeds, which are the condimental part of the plant,\r\nare flat and have a strong and bitter flavor. They are used in this\r\ncountry principally for flavoring a kind of pickle known as the dill\r\npickle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fennel._--The fennel plant (_Fœniculum fœniculum_ L.) is indigenous\r\nto southern Europe. It grows both wild and under cultivation. The\r\ncommon garden fennel is biennial in its habits. The seeds contain the\r\ncondimental properties of the plant, and the seeds of the cultivated\r\nfennel are usually about twice as long as those of the wild variety.\r\nThey are flat on one side and convex on the other and crossed by thick\r\nyellow-colored ribs. The seeds are used chiefly in the manufacture of\r\nliqueurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ginger._--The ginger is the root of the plant _Zingiber zingiber_ L.,\r\nand is one of the most highly prized of the condimental substances. It\r\nis a plant which naturally contains a large amount of starch, which\r\nforms nearly half of its weight in the dried state. The roots are\r\noften sent into commerce covered with lime, either for the purpose of\r\npreserving them or bleaching them. This is such a common condition\r\nthat the limed ginger or bleached ginger is recognized as a legitimate\r\narticle of commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mace._--The mace of commerce is composed of the dried arillus of\r\n_Myristica fragrans_ Honttyn. Mace contains a large quantity of fatty\r\nsubstance, usually not less than 20 nor more than 30 percent of its\r\ntotal weight. There are several varieties of mace on the market, the\r\nprincipal one being Macassar mace, which is obtained from the dried\r\narillus of _Myristica argentea_ Warb. The Bombay mace is derived from\r\nthe dried arillus of _Myristica malabarica_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marjoram_ is the dried leaf of the plant known by the botanical name\r\nof _Majorana majorana_ (L.) Karst. or _Origanum vulgare_ L. This plant\r\nis a native of Europe and is a very common wild plant in France,\r\nespecially on the borders of the forests. It is also extensively\r\ncultivated. It is a perennial. The leaves of the plant are the\r\ncondimental portions. A plant known as mountain mint is frequently sold\r\nas marjoram and has some of its condimental properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mustard._--The mustard seed is derived from various species,\r\ndistinguished largely by the color of the seeds. For instance, the\r\nwhite mustard is the seed of _Sinapis alba_ L., the black mustard the\r\nseed of _Brassica nigra_ (L.) Koch, and the black or brown mustard\r\nthe seed of _Brassica juncea_ (L.) Cosson. The mustard is a widely\r\ndistributed plant probably indigenous to Europe. It grows extensively\r\nwild and is also largely cultivated. The mustard seed forms one of the\r\nmost important condiments of commerce. The mustard is often ground\r\nbefore it is sold, and frequently it is mixed with other spices and\r\nwith oils and is known as prepared mustard. This latter variety is\r\nsubjected to all kinds of adulterations, frequently containing very\r\nlittle mustard but with enough turmeric to give the preparation a\r\nyellow color resembling that attributed to the pure article. Prepared\r\nmustard should be a thick paste composed largely of ground mustard seed\r\ntogether with salt, spices of different kinds, and vinegar. It may also\r\nbe ground in oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nutmeg._--Nutmeg is the seed of _Myristica fragrans_. The seed is\r\nsent into commerce with a thin coating of lime, which, of course, must\r\nbe removed before the nutmeg is used. It is principally used as the\r\nunground nut and by grating it into the food which is to be flavored at\r\nthe time of use. The nut thus retains its flavor much better than when\r\nall ground at once and kept for some time. There are many varieties of\r\nnutmeg on the market, the principal ones being the Macassar, Papua,\r\nmale, and long nutmegs. These are all the dried seeds of the _Myristica\r\nargentea_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pepper._--Pepper is one of the most important of the principal\r\naromatic condimental substances. There are many standard varieties\r\nwhich are known to the trade and which are derived from distinct\r\nbotanical species. The principal varieties are black pepper, white\r\npepper, and paprika pepper. Black pepper is the dried immature berry\r\nof _Piper nigrum_ L. White pepper is the dried mature berry of _Piper\r\nnigrum_ L. from which the outer and the inner coatings of the seed have\r\nbeen removed. Paprika pepper is a red pepper of very mild aromatic\r\nqualities grown chiefly in Hungary and in Spain.\r\n\r\nCayenne pepper is a very active aromatic red pepper which is the dried\r\nfruit of _Capsicum frutescens_ L. or _Capsicum baccatum_ L.\r\n\r\nThe red peppers, therefore, may be divided into two distinct classes,\r\nnamely, cayenne or hot, acrid pepper and the paprika or mild-flavored\r\npepper. There is another variety of pepper known on the market as long\r\npepper which is the dried fruit of _Piper longum_ L.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Saffron_ is the dried stigma of _Crocus sativus_ L.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sage_ is a common garden plant which is very extensively used for\r\ncondimental purposes, belonging to the species _Salvia officinalis_ L.\r\nSage is used very extensively by the housewife in the preparation of\r\ndomestic sausage, and is perhaps more commonly used in meat products of\r\nthis description than in other foods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Savory_ or _summer savory_ is a preparation from the leaf, the\r\nblossom, and tender tips of the branches of _Satureja hortensis_ L.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sweet Basil._--This plant is indigenous to India, growing usually\r\nabout one foot high. The botanical name is _Ocymum Basilicum_ L.\r\nFrench, basilic grand; German, Basilikum; Italian, basilico; Spanish,\r\nalbaca.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of the plant are the aromatic part and are extensively used\r\nfor condimental purposes of different kinds. There are many varieties\r\nof basil in use.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thyme._--Thyme is a plant indigenous to southern Europe and belongs to\r\nthe botanical species _Thymus vulgaris_ L. It is a perennial plant and\r\ngrows in the form of a small dwarf shrub. The plant may be propagated\r\neither by cuttings or may be grown from the seed. The leaves and young\r\nshoots of the thyme may be used for condimental purposes. Some other\r\nspecies of the thyme are also used for condimental purposes, especially\r\nthe varieties known as lemon thyme and mother-of-thyme.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Vegetable Flavoring Extracts.=--In speaking of condimental substances\r\nit was stated that they were either used directly in a state of fine\r\nsubdivision for flavoring purposes or their extracts were employed.\r\nThe use of the extract is often more convenient than the use of the\r\npowdered material, and, also, it secures a more even distribution of\r\nthe flavoring principal throughout the food product. It is doubtful,\r\nhowever, if for really condimental purposes there is any advantage in\r\nthe use of the extracted materials. Nevertheless there are many food\r\nproducts in which it would be inconvenient to use the powdered aromatic\r\nsubstance itself and the flavoring extract has become established as a\r\nlegitimate article of a condimental nature.\r\n\r\nAll the common extracts used in foods are described in the standards\r\nof purity established by the Secretary of Agriculture by authority of\r\nCongress, and will be found in Appendix A.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUITS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Definition.=--Under the term “fruit” is included the edible products\r\nof many trees and shrubs. The term “fruit” in its general sense can be\r\napplied to any kind of a food product, as for instance the fruit of\r\nthe farm, the fields, and the forest, but in a restricted sense, as\r\nit will be used here, it is applied to the class of orchard products\r\nrepresented by apples, peaches, pears, etc. Fruits, in a general sense,\r\ninclude also that class of wild or cultivated edible bodies known\r\nas berries. The term “berry” is restricted in its present sense to\r\nthe products of certain small shrubs or vines, such as gooseberries,\r\nblackberries, raspberries, etc. The fruits that grow upon small\r\nbushes, such as the currant and gooseberry, occupy an intermediate\r\nposition between the orchard fruits which have been mentioned and\r\nberries. Orchard fruits are conveniently divided into large and small\r\nfruits, the large fruits being represented by the apple, pear, peach,\r\nquince, etc., and the small fruit by the cherry and plum. Fruits were\r\ndoubtless among the earliest foods of man, and this leads to another\r\nclassification of fruits, namely, wild and cultivated. Wild fruits,\r\nat the present time, do not include any large proportion of human\r\nfoods. There are certain trees growing wild, such as the mulberry, the\r\nwild cherry, and others, which produce delicious fruits, usually of\r\nsmall size. The term “fruit” as used herein does not include that very\r\nvaluable class of foods known as nuts, which is considered under a\r\nseparate classification.\r\n\r\n\r\n=General Characteristics of Fruits.=--The general characteristics of\r\nfruits include their color, flavor, odor, and nutritive properties in\r\nso far as we are concerned with them in this manual. They are composed\r\nvery largely of water, perhaps 80 percent or more. The solid matter\r\nconsists of the usual cellulose structure of vegetable bodies, sugars,\r\ngums, organic acids, and mineral matters. Fruits are all succulent,\r\nthat is, by reason of their high content of water, composed chiefly\r\nof matters in solution which constitute their juices. All fruits,\r\ntherefore, when subjected to pressure yield a juice which contains the\r\nprincipal portion of their dietetic constituents. The study of the\r\ncomposition of the fruit juices would, therefore, naturally accompany\r\na study of the fruits themselves. The chief characteristics of fruit\r\nfrom a dietetic point of view and also a palatable standpoint are\r\ntheir sugars and acids. The characteristic of taste depends on these\r\ntwo constituents principally. In addition to this, the fruits contain\r\naromatic substances belonging to the class of essential oils and\r\ncompound ethers which give to them the agreeable odor which adds so\r\nmuch to their value. Fruits are naturally colored and these colors, to\r\nwhich the eye is accustomed, become marks of distinction and excellence\r\nin many cases. The prevailing colors of fruits are red, yellow, and\r\ngreen. All shades of colors, however, are represented by the mingling\r\nof the primary tints. Certain colors are associated with certain fruits\r\nas, for instance, red with the cherry, raspberry, etc., green, red,\r\nand yellow with apples, and shades of red and yellow with peaches.\r\nThese colors are due to the different conditions of the chlorophyll\r\nor vegetable coloring matter which the skin of the fruit contains.\r\nThe three principal color tints which are produced are known as\r\nchlorophyll, green, xanthophyll, yellow, and erythrophyll, red. The\r\nmingling of these three distinct colors in the plant coloring matter\r\nforms the various tints which are seen in fruits and which render them\r\nso attractive to the eye.\r\n\r\nThe sugars in fruit include both the common sugar (sucrose) and invert\r\nsugar, which contains equal quantities of dextrose and levulose. As the\r\nsugar is more or less abundant in proportion to the other ingredients\r\nthe fruit is more or less sweet. The different fruits contain different\r\nquantities of sugar,--the richest perhaps is the grape which often in\r\na state of complete maturity may have from 25 to 30 percent of sugar.\r\nApples contain from five to 15 percent of sugar, and peaches and pears\r\nsomewhat less. In fact this range in sugar will cover nearly all the\r\nfruits, large and small, as well as most of the berries. The quantity\r\nof sugar contained in each of the fruits will be especially noted in\r\ntreating of them individually. One of the most important constituents\r\nof fruit from a palatable point of view is found in its organic acids.\r\nThese vary in different classes of fruits. The most common organic acid\r\nin fruit is malic, which is the chief acid in the apple and allied\r\nforms. In citrus fruits, such as the lemon and orange, citric acid is\r\nthe principal organic acid. In grapes the principal organic acid is\r\ntartaric. More than one of these acids is, however, usually contained\r\nin a single fruit, and other organic acids than those named are found\r\nin small quantities in various fruits. The three mentioned may be\r\nregarded as the typical acids in fruits. These acids, if prepared\r\nchemically and administered in a pure state, have practically no food\r\nvalue at all, and cannot be considered as wholesome material to place\r\nin the stomach. When, however, they are eaten in their natural state\r\nin combination with the potash and other bases which fruits contain,\r\nand mingled, as Nature has done, with the other constituents, they\r\nadd not only to the palatability but also to the wholesomeness of the\r\nproduct. This is only another illustration of the fact that natural\r\nproducts are often wholesome and desirable where artificial products\r\nof the same kind chemically are hurtful and undesirable. Many fruits\r\ncontain considerable quantities of a carbohydrate allied to some extent\r\nin its composition to sugar and starch but which has the property of\r\nsetting to a semi-resilient mass known as jelly. This constituent in\r\nfruit is known as pectin or pectose and is present in greater or less\r\nquantities in almost all fruits. It is by the utilization of this\r\ncomponent of fruit that the jellies which are so common an article of\r\nfood are prepared. While in its physical properties the jelly of fruits\r\nhas some resemblance to the gelatine or jelly of animals, its chemical\r\ncomposition and nutritive values are entirely different. The gelatine\r\nor jelly of animals is essentially a nitrogenous product while the\r\npectin or jelly of fruit is essentially a carbohydrate product. The\r\ntwo, therefore, are not to be confounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Nutritive Uses.=--The edible fruits are not only valuable on account\r\nof the nourishment they contain but particularly so because of\r\nthe general effect which they have upon the digestive operations.\r\nTheir judicious use is conducive to health in many ways. The fruits\r\nare mildly laxative, as a rule, although there are some exceptions\r\nto this. For instance, in some berries, like the blackberry, the\r\nquantity of tannin present is sufficient to cause a styptic or binding\r\naction. While all the fruits contain tannin it is usually not in such\r\nproportions as to produce a constipating effect. On the other hand the\r\ncombination of the acids, bases, pectins, and sugars favors a free\r\nand natural progress of the food through the alimentary canal. The\r\nentire withdrawal of fruit from the dietary, even if the nourishment\r\nit supplies be provided in some other way, would work great damage\r\nto health. There are certain dangers, however, to be avoided in the\r\ngeneral use of fruit. Immature and imperfect fruits are unwholesome.\r\nFruits are often subjected, moreover, to infection with eggs of various\r\nkinds of insects, and these organisms and the larvæ or eggs thereof may\r\nbe introduced into the stomach with more or less injurious effects. In\r\nthe eating of fruit, care should be exercised in the inspection and\r\nproper preparation of the article; it should be free from infection,\r\ndecay, and insect life. The natural condition in which fruit is eaten\r\nis in the raw state, and in general it may be said that this is the\r\nmore wholesome and preferable way of eating it. On the other hand the\r\ncooking of fruit sterilizes it and makes the consumer secure against\r\nany infection from bacteria and insect life, and in some ways promotes\r\nto a certain degree the digestive processes. This is especially true of\r\nfruits of a hard or unyielding nature. Cooked fruits, as a rule, may be\r\nconsidered less desirable than the natural article, but they deserve\r\nmention on account of their freedom from infection, wholesomeness, and\r\ngeneral dietetic value. Some fruits, such as apples and pears, contain\r\nnotable quantities of starch, especially in the immature state, and\r\nthis disappears to a greater or less extent during the process of\r\nripening. At the period of complete maturity the starch is reduced to\r\na minimum and the sugar in the fruit reaches a maximum. After this\r\nperiod the fruit begins to lose in dietetic value, due to the natural\r\nprocess of decay, which is not even entirely checked by placing the\r\nfruit in cold storage. The sugar gradually ferments and disappears. The\r\nfruit becomes more spongy and less palatable and its general properties\r\nare impaired. Other fruits, such as the orange and lemon, berries,\r\netc., contain little or no starch at any period of their growth. By\r\ncareful storage the period of maturity may be prolonged for weeks or\r\neven months, and thus the fruit made available over a very much longer\r\nperiod than would otherwise be the case. Under the existing conditions\r\nof communication with all parts of the world it is not impracticable\r\nfor even those who are not blest with wealth to have a daily supply of\r\nfresh fruits grown in different parts of the world. In temperate climes\r\nfresh fruits are available from June until May of the following year,\r\neither furnished directly from the orchard or properly preserved by\r\nstorage.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Apples.=--The apple is one of the principal fruits in the market both\r\nfor its crop value and for its general properties.\r\n\r\nIt is the most abundant as well as the most valuable of fruits. The\r\napple is grown practically in all parts of the United States, but\r\nthere are some localities in which the apple tree flourishes in great\r\nabundance. Among the states which are famous for apple growing may be\r\nmentioned New York, Virginia, Michigan, and Missouri.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of apples are so numerous that it will be useless to\r\nattempt to mention them. Some of the most important are the Ben Davis,\r\nthe Pippin, the Winesap, Jonathan, Rhode Island Greening, York,\r\nAlbemarle Pippin, Clayton, Early Harvester, Sweet June, Tompkins King,\r\nNorthern Spy, Russet, Yellow Bellflower, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Acidity of Apples._--One of the chief points in the palatability of\r\napples as well as in their general character is their acidity. While\r\napples are not relished when too sour they are as little relished\r\nwhen too sweet. The sugar and acid in apples are the chief factors\r\nin their palatability, not excluding the delicate flavor imparted by\r\nessential oils and ethereal substances which, though present in such\r\nsmall quantities as not to be measured chemically, nevertheless are\r\nhighly important in making up the total effect of palatability and\r\nwholesomeness. The chief acid in apples is malic. It exists during all\r\nperiods of the growth of the apple, but is more apparent in the green\r\nand immature state than in the ripe fruit. The relative quantity of\r\nmalic acid in respect of sugar and starch is given under the heading of\r\n“Behavior of Apples During Storage.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Apples._--There is, of course, no adulteration of\r\napples in their natural state except the attempt which is sometimes\r\nmade to deceive the purchaser respecting the character of the whole\r\npackage by placing the best and most attractive fruit on the top. This\r\nis such a well known practice, though regrettable, as not to demand any\r\nparticular comment. The purchaser who has his own interest at stake\r\nwill usually inspect the bottom as well as the top of the package\r\nbefore buying. The chief forms of debasement are those which are not\r\npracticed with any attempt to deceive. They consist in offering apples\r\nwhich are bruised by carelessness in gathering, or which are infected\r\nby insect life. In fact the greatest damage to which the apple is\r\nsubject is that of the ravages of insects. There are certain kinds\r\nof insects which naturally breed in the apple. The egg is often laid\r\nin the early development of the fruit and by the time the apples are\r\nready for consumption the larvæ stage has been reached and the worm has\r\nproduced ravages to a great extent which are often not indicated by\r\nany external appearance. It is evident that the farmer cannot be held\r\nresponsible in all cases for this condition of the fruit. Nevertheless\r\nit is only fair to state that in the modern development of the spraying\r\nindustry the ravages of insect pests can be restrained and controlled,\r\nif not entirely prevented, by the proper spraying of the fruit. This\r\nspraying introduces another danger which cannot be forgotten, namely,\r\nthe remaining upon the surface of the fruit of some of the spraying\r\nmaterial itself. If present at all this material is apt to be either at\r\nthe point of the junction of the stem with the fruit or at the opposite\r\nextremity of the apple. For this reason the fruit when eaten raw should\r\nbe peeled in order that any remaining particles of the poisonous\r\nmaterial used in spraying may be removed. It is to the interest of the\r\nmerchant to present fruit of this kind in the most attractive form, by\r\nthe exclusion of bruised, rotten, or infected apples and the offering\r\nof the sound, ripe fruit in as presentable a condition as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Apples at Various Stages of Maturity._--The following\r\ntable shows the analysis made of one variety of apple, the Baldwin, at\r\nvarious stages of maturity:\r\n\r\n  ------------+-------+------+------+-------+---------+------\r\n              |       |      |      |       | ACIDITY |\r\n              |       |      |      |       | AS MALIC|\r\n              |       |INVERT| CANE |       |  ACID.  |\r\n   CONDITION. |SOLIDS.|SUGAR.|SUGAR.|STARCH.|PER CENT.| ASH.\r\n  ------------+-------+------+------+-------+---------+------\r\n              | _Per- |_Per- |_Per- | _Per- |  _Per-  |_Per-\r\n              | cent._|cent._|cent._| cent._|  cent._ |cent._\r\n  Very green, | 18.47 | 6.40 | 1.63 |  4.14 |   1.14  | 0.27\r\n  Green,      | 20.19 | 6.46 | 4.05 |  3.67 |   ....  | ....\r\n  Ripe,       | 19.64 | 7.70 | 6.81 |   .17 |    .65  |  .27\r\n  Overripe,   | 19.70 | 8.81 | 5.26 |  None |    .48  |  .28\r\n  ------------+-------+------+------+-------+---------+------\r\n\r\nThe chief point of interest in the above analysis is the gradual\r\ndecline of the starch. When the apple is overripe the starch is\r\nentirely gone. When the apple is ripe only a small part of the starch\r\nis found. In the green apple very large quantities of starch are found.\r\nThe sugar increases as the starch diminishes. There is a little over\r\n14 percent of sugar in the perfectly ripe apple but much less in the\r\ngreen. The acidity calculated as malic acid diminishes as maturity is\r\napproached. In general it may be said that in the ripening of an apple\r\nthe starch is converted into sugar and the acidity is diminished.\r\n\r\nThe composition of apples varies very greatly, as may be easily\r\nunderstood, with the variety of the apple examined, the character of\r\nthe season in which it grew, and with the individual apple or sample.\r\nThe best that can be done in showing the composition of apples is to\r\ngive some of the most reliable analyses, covering the largest range of\r\nexaminations in this and other countries. In the following table are\r\ngiven three sets of analyses of American apples and two sets of foreign\r\napples, the first three being American and the second series being\r\nforeign.\r\n\r\nThe table gives the number of samples included in the analytical data,\r\nand the mean, maximum, and minimum results of the analyses.\r\n\r\n  -----------+-----+-------+------+-------+------+------+------+------\r\n             |     |       |      |ACIDITY|      |      |      |\r\n             | NO. |       |      |  EX-  |  PRO-|      |      |\r\n             |  OF |       |      |PRESSED|  TEIN| RE-  |      |\r\n             | SAM-| TOTAL |      |  AS   |  N × |DUCING| CANE | CRUDE\r\n             |PLES.|SOLIDS.| ASH. | H₂SO₄.| 6.25.|SUGAR.|SUGAR.|FIBER.\r\n  -----------+-----+-------+------+-------+------+------+------+------\r\n             |     | _Per- |_Per- | _Per- |_Per- |_Per- | _Per-|_Per-\r\n             |     | cent._|cent._| cent._|cent._|cent._|cent._|cent._\r\n  _Series 1_:|     |       |      |       |      |      |      |\r\n    Average, |     | 13.77 | .240 |  .376 |  .590|  7.04| 4.59 | ....\r\n    Maximum, |  13 | 16.47 | .320 |  .670 |  .806|  ....| 7.79 | ....\r\n    Minimum, |     |  9.37 | .170 |  .190 |  .356|  ....| 1.80 | ....\r\n  _Series 2_:|     |       |      |       |      |      |      |\r\n    Average, |     | 16.43 | .27  |  .486 |  ....|  7.92| 3.99 | ....\r\n    Maximum, |  27 | 23.36 | .34  |  .811 |  ....| 11.75| 6.81 | ....\r\n    Minimum, |     | 13.46 | .17  |  .073 |  ....|  5.34| 1.74 | ....\r\n  _Series 3_:|     |       |      |       |      |      |      |\r\n    Average, |     | 13.65 | .288 |  .452 |  .694|  8.73| 1.53 | 0.96\r\n    Maximum, |  23 | 16.55 | .404 |  .863 | 1.094| 10.80| 2.81 | 1.29\r\n    Minimum, |     | 10.60 | .228 |  .139 |  .421|  6.89|  .15 |  .70\r\n             |     |       |      |       |      |      |      |\r\n  FOREIGN    |     |       |      |       |      |      |      |\r\n  VARIETY.   |     |       |      |       |      |      |      |\r\n  _Series 1_:|  17 | 16.42 | .310 |  .614 |  .39 |  7.73| .... | 1.98\r\n  _Series 2_:|     |       |      |       |      |      |      |\r\n    Average, |     | 15.07 | .290 |  .234 |  ....| 10.12|  .55 | ....\r\n    Maximum, |   5 | 16.03 | .360 |  .329 |  ....| 10.69| 1.11 | ....\r\n    Minimum, |     | 14.04 | .240 |  .190 |  ....|  9.77| None | ....\r\n  -----------+-----+-------+------+-------+------+------+------+------\r\n\r\nThe combination of the average data of the American series shows a mean\r\npercentage of reducing or invert sugar of 7.90 and of cane sugar of\r\n3.40. The average American apple therefore contains 11.30 percent sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dietetic Value._--The wholesomeness of apples is well recognized by\r\nall authors on physiology and hygiene, and the necessity of at least a\r\npartial fruit diet is acknowledged by all. Inasmuch as the apple is one\r\nof the most abundant of fruits, being produced in enormous quantities\r\nand sold often at a very low rate, its value as a food product is\r\nprobably not as fully acknowledged by our own people as it should be.\r\nThrough a greater part of the year apples can be made a staple article\r\nof diet. They are, of course, to be most highly recommended uncooked,\r\nand especially those varieties which have high palatable qualities and\r\na suitable softness of texture. Very hard apples, even if palatable,\r\nare not recommended for eating raw. In a cooked state the apples are\r\nscarcely less wholesome and nutritious than in the raw state. It is\r\ntrue that in pastry their good qualities are often counteracted by the\r\npoor quality of the pastry envelop which, by reason of the method of\r\nits preparation, usually with an excessive quantity of lard or some\r\nother oil or fat, is rendered sometimes not only unpalatable but also\r\ndifficult of digestion. In a stewed condition or prepared in some\r\nother unobjectionable manner no adverse criticism can be made upon the\r\nquality of the apple as an edible product. It may also be preserved in\r\ncans by sterilization by the process described under canned fruits. In\r\nthis condition the product is known as “canned apples.” When prepared\r\nin this way the apples are often flavored with sugar and sometimes with\r\nspices.\r\n\r\nMany suggestions are often given as to the proper time for eating\r\napples, but it probably makes little difference, so far as their\r\ndietary or hygienic character is concerned, whether they are eaten\r\nbefore or after meals or during meals. Since it is advisable, as a\r\nrule, not to introduce into the stomach continually fresh portions of\r\nfood, it may be regarded as safe advice to suggest that the consumption\r\nof fruit be made practically a function of the meal and that it be\r\nnot used indiscriminately, loading the stomach between meals with\r\nadditional quantities of material which require digestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Length of Harvest._--By selecting varieties that mature early in\r\nthe summer, in the early autumn, and in the late autumn the period\r\nfor harvesting apples may be prolonged in the northern states from\r\nAugust to November. During this period, if the different varieties are\r\nproperly selected for the maturing time, the ripe apple can be offered\r\nto the markets fresh from the tree during the entire season. As a rule\r\nthe later maturing varieties are more palatable, more aromatic, and\r\nmore nutritious than those that mature early.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pectose Content of Apples._--The juice of apples like the juice\r\nof many other fruits has the property of coagulating to a solid or\r\nsemi-solid material on boiling to a proper consistence and allowing to\r\nstand. It is due, essentially, to the existence of pectin or pectose\r\nbodies as described in the introduction on the chapter on fruits. This\r\nis a body allied to the carbohydrates and must be regarded as one\r\nof the essential constituents of apples and as imparting to them a\r\ncharacteristic flavor and quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Picking and Care of Apples._--The greatest difficulty experienced in\r\nmarketing apples is in the danger of bruising either at the time of\r\npicking or during transportation. The apple when removed from the tree\r\nstill remains a living organism with all of its functional activities,\r\nexcept additional growth, continuing in full power. As a rule, at the\r\ntime of picking the apple is not yet mature, and unless intended for\r\nimmediate consumption the utmost care should be exercised that the skin\r\nbe not broken or the flesh bruised. Wherever the flesh of the apple is\r\nbruised it lessens its vitality and decay soon begins. This is shown\r\nvery conclusively in the studies in the Bureau of Chemistry, where\r\nit was found that the starch which is still present in apples at the\r\ntime of picking is gradually converted into sugar during the storage\r\nof the apple, thus increasing the palatability of the fruit. In those\r\nparts of the flesh that have been bruised and the vitality impaired the\r\nstarch remains unchanged during the process of ripening. By the careful\r\npicking of the fruit and wrapping in soft papers, so as to prevent\r\nbruising in transit, apples of the proper character can be transported\r\nlong distances, even beyond the seas, and arrive in good condition.\r\nThis is an especially important fact in the American product, because\r\nour foreign trade in fresh apples is very large and constantly\r\ngrowing. It is useless to attempt to send a bruised or decaying apple\r\non a long journey, since it will arrive in a condition unfit for\r\nconsumption and, further than this, the organisms which are active in\r\ndecay are conveyed to the sound fruit, and thus a whole package may be\r\ninfected from a single apple in bad condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Storage of Apples._--The apple is a crop which is capable of being\r\nstored through many months, especially in winter time, without any\r\nmaterial deterioration. The subject of the storage of apples has been\r\ncarefully studied in the Bureau of Chemistry and the Bureau of Plant\r\nIndustry, and the following are some of the conclusions which have been\r\nreached:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tannin Principle._--Apples, as is the case with other fruits, have a\r\nnotable content of tannin in some form. This constituent of apples is\r\nalso active in giving flavor and palatability to the product. It is\r\nnot present in quantities which render the apple unusually bitter or\r\nstyptic in its character. Inasmuch as tannin is practically a universal\r\nconstituent of all vegetable substances it must not be neglected as\r\na normal constituent of fruit, while some of the fruits, especially\r\nthe grape, owe some of their chief characteristics as to flavor and\r\npalatability to their tannin content.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preparation of Apples for Drying._--The apples usually are brought to\r\nthe large factories in wagons or by railway and are pared and sliced\r\nby machinery. Where proper control is exercised all the imperfect,\r\nrotten, and infected apples are rejected, and are used either for\r\ncattle feeding or sometimes, unfortunately, in cider making. The sound\r\napples, after they are pared and sliced, are placed in trays and passed\r\nto a sulfuring apparatus where they are exposed to the fumes of burning\r\nsulfur to prevent their becoming dark upon evaporation. In other\r\nwords it is essentially a bleaching process. The fumes of sulfur are\r\nalso strongly antiseptic in character, and thus the finished product\r\nis less likely to decay or become infected with mould than a similar\r\nproduct not exposed to the fumes of sulfur. This process is extensively\r\npracticed, but its extent does not render it immune from proper\r\ncriticism. Of 24 samples of evaporated fruits purchased on the open\r\nmarket 13 samples had been treated with sulfur fumes. This shows that\r\nover 50 percent of evaporated fruits are sulfured during the process\r\nof preparation and evaporation. The greater number of physiological\r\nand hygienic experts agree that the fumes of burning sulfur, commonly\r\nknown as sulfurous acid, are injurious to health. It has been shown by\r\nresearches in the Bureau of Chemistry that sulfurous acid or sulfites\r\nhave a specific influence upon the red corpuscles of the blood, tending\r\nto diminish them very largely in relative numbers. This acid has also\r\nmany other influences upon metabolism of an objectionable character.\r\nThe question is one worthy of very careful consideration--whether for\r\nthe sake of preserving a light color and securing immunity from mould\r\nor decay it is advisable to introduce into a food product any quantity\r\nwhatever of a substance injurious to health. The answer to this\r\nquestion seems almost unavoidable, and it is, and should be, negative.\r\nIt is highly advisable that the manufacturer of evaporated apples, as\r\nwell as other fruits treated in a similar manner, should at once begin\r\na series of experimental determinations for the purpose of ascertaining\r\nwhether or not a product equally as palatable and more wholesome\r\ncannot be made without the use of sulfurous acid. The result of this\r\ninvestigation cannot be doubted. There is no doubt whatever, even at\r\nthe present time, that by the elimination of the sulfuring process\r\na product can be made which is far more wholesome, although perhaps\r\nnot so presentable as that which is now made. If all manufacturers of\r\nevaporated fruits practice the same method there can be no injury in\r\nthe market as a result of a darker color which the finished product\r\nwould assume. On the contrary the consumer of this product would soon\r\nunderstand that the darker color was due to a more hygienic method of\r\npreparation, and hence the product would be commended in such a way\r\nas doubtless to enter more largely into consumption. Instead of the\r\nmanufacturer being injured by the prohibition of the use of sulfur he\r\nwould in a very short time be greatly benefited. It is hoped that by\r\nthe means of general information which is spread abroad concerning\r\nmatters of this kind among our people and also through the operations\r\nof national and state laws the use of injurious substances, such as\r\nthe fumes of burning sulfur in connection with food products, may be\r\nentirely discontinued.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dried Apples._--A very important industry in this country is the\r\npreservation of apples by drying or evaporation. The term “dried”\r\napples is usually applied to the product which is naturally dried\r\nby cutting the apples into convenient sizes and exposing them to\r\nthe action of the sun. This is more of a domestic than a commercial\r\nindustry, and until the introduction of artificial drying was practiced\r\nvery generally by the farmers’ wives of the country. It was not an\r\nunusual thing in the autumn to see the roofs of smoke houses or\r\nkitchens practically covered with sliced apples exposed to the drying\r\ninfluence of the autumnal sun. In such cases care must be exercised\r\nalways to have the exposed articles under such control as to enable\r\nthem to be gathered up and put away when rain is threatening. The\r\ndried apple is a wholesome fruit, although somewhat unattractive in\r\nappearance owing to the darkening of the surface during the long\r\nexposure necessary to secure the proper degree of evaporation. When\r\nproperly prepared the dried apple has its moisture content reduced to\r\napproximately 30 percent or less.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Evaporated Apples._--The term “evaporated” is applied to apples\r\nproduced on the same principle as “dried,” but instead of being exposed\r\nto the heat of the sun they are artificially dried by evaporation. This\r\nindustry has reached a great magnitude in this country, and Wayne Co.,\r\nNew York, especially, may be regarded as one of the centers of the\r\nevaporating industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cherries.=--The cultivated cherry tree is believed by Bailey and\r\nPowell to have been derived from its ancestral type, the sour cherry\r\n(_Prunus cerasus_ L.), which is characterized by a diffuse and\r\nmostly low, round-headed growth with fruit which is always red, with\r\nsoft flesh and very sour taste, and from the sweet cherry (_Prunus\r\navium_ L.), a tall growing tree with the bark tending to peel off\r\nin birch-like rings and with variously colored fruit, spherical or\r\nheart-shaped, with the flesh hard or soft and generally sweet. There\r\nare a great many varieties of these trees. The cherry orchard begins to\r\nbear profitably at about the age of five years; the trees often live to\r\na great age and continue to bear fruit. Records of cherry trees over a\r\nhundred years old are known. However, it is believed that about thirty\r\nyears is the limit for profitable bearing. Cherries grow in all parts\r\nof the United States. Formerly the crop was a very important one in the\r\nEast, especially New York, but of late years the California cherries\r\nhave been more and more occupying the market. As a rule the California\r\ncherries are finer in appearance, larger, and freer from worms and\r\nimperfections, and possess a flavor which is often equal to that of the\r\nbest flavored cherries grown in the East.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Cherries._--What has been said respecting the\r\nvariations in the composition of apples is applicable with equal force\r\nto cherries. In the following table is given first the mean composition\r\nof six samples of cherries of American origin with the maximum and\r\nminimum. Following this is the mean composition of nine samples of\r\nforeign cherries.\r\n\r\n  ------------------+------+-------+------+-------+------+-------\r\n                    |      |       |      |ACIDITY|      |\r\n                    |      |       |      |  EX-  | PRO- |\r\n                    |NO.

The total\r\nsolids represent that part of the cherry which is not water, including\r\nprincipally the cellulose, the ash, and the protein. The quantity of\r\nprotein, as is seen, is quite small, the average being a little less\r\nthan 1¹⁄₂ percent. The total sugar present, including cane sugar and\r\nreducing sugar, is a little over 11 percent. The analytical table does\r\nnot give the minute portions of essential oils, ethereal substances,\r\nand acids to which the juice owes its distinctive flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Varieties._--There are a great many trade-names given to different\r\nvarieties of cherries. In New York the common varieties are the Black\r\nTartarian, Black Eagle, Napoleon, Yellow Spanish, Windsor, May Duke,\r\nRobert’s Red Heart, Governor Wood, Early Richmond, etc.\r\n\r\nA great many cherry trees are also grown in Iowa. The varieties\r\nmost prized in Iowa are the Malaheb, the Mazzard, Wild Bird Cherry,\r\nSand Cherry, American Morello, Russian Seedling, Northwest, Duchess\r\nd’Angoulême, and very many others.\r\n\r\nIn Virginia the principal varieties, in addition to those mentioned,\r\nwhich are cultivated, are the Coe, Early Purple, Kirtland Mary,\r\nRockport, Olivet, Philippe, etc.\r\n\r\nThe cherry owes one of its chief values to the fact that it is one\r\nof the first orchard fruits to ripen. In the vicinity of Washington\r\ncherries ripen in May, and further north not later than June. The\r\ncherry, therefore, offers a delicious and wholesome fruit early in the\r\nseason, and is the precursor of the crops of orchard fruits which begin\r\nearly in May and last until the frosts of autumn. It is eaten raw,\r\nstewed, or in the form of pie or pudding. For cooking purposes it is\r\ndesirable that the pit of the cherry be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Grapes.=--There is no fruit more highly esteemed in this and other\r\ncountries than grapes. The utilization of grapes for wine making is\r\nreserved for discussion in the companion volume to the present manual\r\ndevoted to beverages. Table grapes are grown extensively in this\r\ncountry in New York, Ohio, Virginia, Missouri, and California. In\r\nfact, such grapes are grown in almost every state, but those mentioned\r\nembrace the principal grape-growing districts. The Catawba and Delaware\r\nvarieties are the chief products of the northern vineyards. Many other\r\nvarieties are produced in California, such as the Tokay, Muscat, and\r\nMalaga, while in the South one of the principal varieties is the\r\nScuppernong. The oldest grape vine known in the United States is the\r\noriginal Scuppernong stock.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Dr. B. W. Kilgore, of Raleigh, N. C., for the\r\nfollowing description of the vine and also for Fig. 48.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “THE SCUPPERNONG VINE ON ROANOKE ISLAND, NORTH CAROLINA.\r\n\r\n  “The old scuppernong grape vine on Roanoke Island is probably the\r\n  oldest fruiting plant in America--certainly one of the oldest of\r\n  which there is definite knowledge. A clear record of it begins in\r\n  1797, when the land on which it was growing was purchased by Maurice\r\n  Baum. Previous to his purchase nothing definite is known as to its\r\n  age or to whom it belonged, save the fact that it was then a very old\r\n  vine, as Maurice Baum was told by his father that he had eaten grapes\r\n  from it when a boy. From Maurice Baum the estate, of which the\r\n  vine was a part, descended to his daughter, Mahala, and from her to\r\n  Benjamin F. Meekins, her son, who is the present owner.\r\n\r\n  “The vine is situated on the northern end and on the eastern shore\r\n  of the island, about two miles south of the supposed site of Fort\r\n  Raleigh. It covers an area of about one-fourth of an acre, and as far\r\n  back as can be remembered its growth has been stationary, probably\r\n  due to a lack of proper training and inducement to spread. The vine\r\n  has five large trunks averaging two feet in circumference which\r\n  are indescribably gnarled and twisted. It is still vigorous and\r\n  yields abundantly, seemingly unaffected by age in this respect. A\r\n  conservative estimate of its yield is an average of sixty bushels of\r\n  grapes a season.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.--SCUPPERNONG GRAPE VINE, ROANOKE\r\nISLAND.--(_Courtesy B. W. Kilgore._)]\r\n\r\nThere is no part of the country, however, that grows grapes so\r\nabundantly as California. Many thousands of acres are covered with\r\nvines, both for table use and wine making. The climate is remarkably\r\nwell suited to produce a grape very rich in sugar. The edible grapes do\r\nnot have so high a content of sugar as those used for wine making, as\r\nis shown by the data below.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of California Grapes_ (three samples) (edible portion):\r\n\r\n  Water,             80.12 percent\r\n  Protein,            1.26    „\r\n  Sugar,             16.50    „\r\n  Pure ash,           0.50    „\r\n  Fat, fiber, etc.,   1.62    „\r\n\r\nThe preceding analyses are evidently of grapes for table use.

W. Wiley._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Peaches.=--One of the most valued orchard fruits in the United States\r\nis the peach. The peach is a tree which is particularly sensitive to\r\nthe environment in respect of bearing a crop. In many localities where\r\npeaches have once been valuable they have ceased to produce with any\r\nregularity, which renders the planting of an orchard inadvisable. The\r\nprincipal danger in the peach tree is the too early blooming and the\r\nexposure of the tender fruit to late frosts. The peach tree is also\r\nsubject to many forms of disease, one of which, namely, the yellows,\r\nhas baffled up to the present time the efforts of the experts to\r\ndiagnose and treat. In planting a peach orchard experience has shown\r\nthat it is well to plant the trees upon high ground or upon the sides\r\nof hills. By being placed on high ground near deep ravines it has been\r\nfound that the chilling of the air, which would naturally come with\r\nfrosts, makes the air heavier, so that it rolls down into the valleys,\r\nreplacing the air on the hills with fresh portions unchilled and thus\r\nprotecting the high ground from frost while the low ground is chilled\r\nbelow the freezing point. Everyone must have noticed, especially in\r\nthe autumn at the time of the first frosts, that the vegetation in\r\nlow lying land is usually killed before that on the adjacent hills.\r\nThe peculiar susceptibility of the peach tree to the environment\r\nmentioned above has practically confined the culture of peaches to\r\ncertain definite localities, as for instance to Michigan, Connecticut,\r\nDelaware, Maryland, Tennessee, and Georgia. The danger of late frosts\r\nof course does not attach to the peach tree grown in California and\r\nsimilarly situated localities. At the present time Georgia is probably\r\nthe most important peach-growing state in the Union, both on account of\r\nthe reasonable certainty of the crop and also because of the early date\r\nat which the peach can reach the markets of the large cities of the\r\neast and central portions of our country.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made to protect the peach tree against the\r\ndanger of premature blossoming and consequent exposure to the late\r\nfrosts. In the cultivation of the trees it has been desirable to secure\r\na variety which blooms as late in the spring as possible. The building\r\nof fires around a peach orchard in the spring when a frost is imminent\r\nhas sometimes protected the orchard from disaster. This process is\r\nknown as smudging. Another method of protecting the trees from the\r\ndanger of late frosts is by whitewashing. The colors which absorb heat\r\nmost readily are black and purple. White is one of the best protections\r\nby reason of its reflective power. A whitewashing of the branches of\r\nthe trees and in fact of all the tree has been practiced with some\r\nsuccess as retarding the early bloom of the buds. Elaborate studies of\r\nthis method of treatment have been carried on by the Missouri station,\r\nand it has been developed that there is a considerable difference\r\nbetween the temperature of whitewashed and unwhitewashed peach twigs.\r\nThe whitewash is therefore recommended as a means of retarding the\r\ndevelopment of the buds. The whitewashed trees bloom from a week to\r\nten days later than those which are not thus treated. It is reasonably\r\ncertain that by means of this kind or by cultivation a peach tree may\r\nbe produced in any given locality which will put forth its buds from\r\na week to ten days later than the normal period of blooming in that\r\nneighborhood. In regions where the winters are severe, the development\r\nof the tree in the early spring may also be prevented by placing straw\r\nround about it when the ground is frozen. The straw protects the frozen\r\nground from rapid thawing and thus delays the development of the buds.\r\nThe varieties of peach trees are legion, and it is useless to try to\r\nname them here. Some of the varieties most prized in Georgia are the\r\nBishop, Champion, Crawford’s Early, Chinese Free, Crimson Beauty,\r\nCrosby, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Peach._--Naturally, the peach varies greatly in\r\nits composition according to the variety, environment, and general\r\naccidental conditions. Its chief characteristics, of course, are the\r\nacid which it contains, its sugar content, and the taste and aroma due\r\nto the essential oils, ethers, etc., which are developed with proper\r\ndelicacy in the fruit. The peach also has a distinct flavor associated\r\nwith small quantities of hydrocyanic acid. This poisonous compound\r\nis developed in considerable quantities in the kernel of the fruit,\r\nand there are sufficient traces of the flavor above mentioned in the\r\nfruit itself to give a distinct and characteristic taste. The mean\r\ncomposition of some of the different varieties of peaches is given\r\nbelow:\r\n\r\n  Water,                          88.1 percent\r\n  Protein,                          .7    „\r\n  Fat,                              .1    „\r\n  Ash,                              .7    „\r\n  Sugar and other carbohydrates,  10.8    „\r\n\r\n\r\n_Free and Cling Peach._--Peaches may be divided into two great classes\r\nin respect of persistence with which the flesh adheres to the pit\r\nof the fruit. Peaches in which the flesh is separated easily from\r\nthe pit, leaving the external surface of the pit dry and clean, are\r\ncalled freestones, while in the other variety, where the flesh is\r\nfirmly attached to the pit and on the removal of the flesh a portion\r\nadheres thereto, the term “clingstone” is applied. There is probably no\r\ndifference in the value of the two varieties, but by reason of the ease\r\nwith which the freestone peach can be utilized for eating and cooking\r\npurposes it is sometimes preferred.\r\n\r\nSince the development of rapid means of transportation and the\r\neffective manner of cold storage the peach is exposed in the city\r\nmarkets from early spring to late autumn. The peaches in Florida are\r\nready for the market in May and in Georgia from June on, while in the\r\nnorth the peach ripens at later periods up to October. In fact in the\r\nnorth the late peaches are esteemed as better in flavor and quality,\r\nand especially suitable for canning and preserving purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Uses of the Peach._--Peaches are perhaps the most esteemed of all the\r\ncommon fruits for eating purposes. On the table the sliced peaches with\r\nsugar and cream is a common dish through the whole summer in almost\r\nevery part of the country. Peach cobbler (a deep pie) and peach pudding\r\nare dishes which are highly esteemed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Plums.=--(Native Plums.) The following data represent the mean\r\ncomposition of three samples of California plums:\r\n\r\n  Total solids,  21.60 percent\r\n  Ash,             .52    „\r\n  Acidity,        1.00    „\r\n  Protein,         .40    „\r\n  Total sugars,  13.25    „\r\n\r\nThe plums imported from Japan and the hybrids produced therefrom\r\nare considered of higher value than the native plum. The Japan plum\r\n(_Prunus triflora_) has been introduced into this country for many\r\nyears. They are larger and handsomer and have better shipping qualities\r\nthan those of native origin, except perhaps in a few cases. The trees\r\nare also less subject to that great enemy of the plum, the curculio,\r\nthan the native plum. Of the plum trees grown in Georgia the varieties\r\nof native trees which are recommended are the Clifford and the Wilder,\r\nof Japan trees the Lutts, Red June, Abundance, and Chabot, and of the\r\nhybrid varieties, the Wickson. Plums in Georgia mature from the first\r\nof June until the middle of July. Further north the date of maturity\r\nis later. The plum, as well as the cherry, flourishes especially in\r\nCalifornia, which is more famous for these fruits than any other state.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Quince.=--The quince is a fruit which is not very extensively used\r\nraw, but is valued chiefly as a preserve. The quince flourishes in\r\nlocalities that produce good apples, but the magnitude of the crop is\r\nvery restricted as compared with apples.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALL FRUITS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Blackberries= (_Rubus nigrobaccus_ var. _Sativus_ Bailey).--Among the\r\nsmall fruits one of the most common and abundant is the blackberry.\r\nThis fruit grows wild over large areas in the United States, mostly in\r\nthe middle portion between the extreme north and south. The brier on\r\nwhich it grows is an annual plant, springing each year from the roots\r\nand dying after bearing fruit. The plant is very largely cultivated,\r\nbearing larger and more presentable berries, but gaining nothing in\r\nflavor and palatability. The berries are generally black when fully\r\nripe, though red during the ripening stage and sometimes when mature.\r\nThey are eaten raw, stewed, and in pies or “cobblers.” The berry is\r\nextensively used for making jams, jellies, and preserves, and for\r\ncanning purposes. The juice of the berry is used for making a wine,\r\nusually with the admixture of sugar. Blackberry cordial is blackberry\r\njuice preserved in whisky or brandy.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dewberry.=--This is a variety of blackberry in which the vines lie on\r\nthe ground instead of standing upright. Some of the dewberries possess\r\nunusual fragrance and palatability. In other respects they conform to\r\nthe statements relating to blackberries.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Gooseberry= (_Ribes oxyacanthoides_ L.).--The gooseberry resembles\r\nvery closely the currant in its general properties. In the European\r\ngooseberry the surface is covered with prickles, but the American\r\nvariety is smooth. The gooseberry bush is found in most gardens,\r\naffording a fruit of high condimental value. The fruit is eaten raw,\r\nbut principally in pies and as preserves.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Huckleberry= (_Gaylussacia resinosa_ Torr. and Gray).--The fruit\r\nof the huckleberry bush is used very extensively for making pies,\r\nespecially in the northeastern parts of the United States. There\r\nare many varieties of the berry on the markets. The blueberry is one\r\nvariety that is very abundant. The term whortleberry is also applied to\r\nthis fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mulberry= (_Morus nigra_).--The mulberry grows wild over extensive\r\nareas in the United States, especially in the Ohio valley. It is a\r\ntree valued highly for its wood, which is lasting and excellent for\r\nfence-posts. The berries ripen early in the summer or late in the\r\nspring and are used as food to a limited extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Raspberry= (_Rubus strigosus_ Michx.).--The raspberry is nearly\r\nrelated to the blackberry in all of its characters. It is chiefly a\r\ncultivated plant, being less hardy than the blackberry, and therefore\r\nnot growing wild to such an extent. The fruit matures just before\r\nthe blackberry, and is usually of a red color and of a pleasant\r\ncharacteristic taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Strawberry= (_Fragaria Chiloensis_ Ehrh.).--For edible purposes in its\r\nfresh state the strawberry is the most important of the small fruits.\r\nIt is offered on the markets at all seasons of the year--ripening in\r\nthe winter time in Florida and California and coming into the markets\r\nin the late summer in the northern and northeastern states. It grows\r\non vines lying on the ground and ripens early in the spring in the\r\nlatitude of Washington, viz., from about the middle of May. It is eaten\r\nraw--often with sugar and cream--more extensively than any other small\r\nfruit. The wild strawberry is not so large as the cultivated variety,\r\nbut is more highly prized for its aroma and taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Small Fruits._--\r\n\r\n                                                 SUGAR,\r\n                                                 STARCH\r\n                   WATER.

There are three varieties, known as follows:\r\nSweet-sop (anona) (_Anona squamosa_ L.), sour-sop (guanabana) (_Anona\r\nmuricata_ L.), and custard apple (chirimoya) (_Anona reticulata_ L.).\r\nThe sour-sop is a green, irregular-shaped, pod-like fruit, varying\r\nfrom 3¹⁄₂ inches to 12 inches in length and about two-thirds as broad\r\nnear the top, and curving to a blunt point at the lower end. The skin\r\nis thick and covered with numerous small, hooked briers. The pulp has\r\nthe appearance of wet cotton and surrounds the numerous seed sacs\r\ncontaining the small brown seeds. A fibrous core runs through the fruit\r\nfrom the stem to the lower point. The fruit weighs from 3.5 ounces to\r\n2.2 pounds. The flavor is acid, but not too much so. This fruit is\r\nmore extensively used in the manufacture of cooling beverages than\r\ndirectly as a food, but it is also used very extensively for making\r\npreserves. The sweet-sop resembles the sour-sop in general character,\r\nbut does not attain by any means to so large a size. The fruit is\r\nheart-shaped and deeply creased. The pulp contains more sugar and less\r\nacid than that of the sour-sop. This variety is eaten fresh and is also\r\nused for flavoring beverages, but is not extensively used for making\r\npreserves. The third variety, known as the custard apple, varies in\r\ncolor from light green to reddish brown, and is shaped something like\r\na strawberry. It has a thick skin and black seeds, and a pulp very\r\nsimilar to that of sweet-sop in flavor. It is eaten chiefly raw, and is\r\nnot very extensively used in the manufacture of preserves.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Sour- and Sweet-sop Varieties._--\r\n\r\n  ------+--------+-------+-------+--------+------+--------\r\n        | EDIBLE |       | TOTAL |        |      |\r\n        |PORTION.|SOLIDS.|SUGAR. |PROTEIN.| ASH. |ACIDITY.\r\n  ------+--------+-------+-------+--------+------+--------\r\n        |  _Per- |  _Per-|  _Per-|  _Per- | _Per-|  _Per-\r\n        | cent._ | cent._| cent._| cent._ |cent._| cent._\r\n  ------+--------+-------+-------+--------+------+--------\r\n  Sour- |        |       |       |        |      |\r\n  sop,  | 72.30  | 19.03 | 13.07 |  1.65  |  .41 |    .51\r\n  Sweet-|        |       |       |        |      |\r\n  sop,  | 30.00  | 28.10 | 10.07 |  2.13  |  .92 |    .20\r\n  ------+--------+-------+-------+--------+------+--------\r\n\r\nThe above analyses show that the anona is a fruit which has about half\r\nthe nutritive value of the banana. It has a much larger percentage of\r\nwaste, especially the sweet-sop variety, where nearly three-fourths of\r\nthe fruit is not edible.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anona Preserves._--The anona preserves should be made exclusively\r\nwith sugar and thus have the character of the fruit modified only by\r\nthe amount of sugar added. In one sample of preserves analyzed the\r\nfollowing data were obtained:\r\n\r\n  Total solids,  54.33 percent\r\n  Total sugar,   49.66    „\r\n  Protein,         .73    „\r\n  Ash,             .43    „\r\n  Acidity,         .19    „\r\n\r\nThe above data show that the natural constituents of the fruit have\r\nbeen diminished in quantity in proportion to the amount of sugar added.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Avocado= (_Persea persea_).--The avocado is a fruit which has\r\nonly lately been introduced into the United States. Its common name is\r\nalligator pear and it is already very highly prized.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the alligator pear was first undertaken as a\r\nnovelty, and its real value as a dessert fruit is only beginning to be\r\nappreciated. It is evident that this fruit will have a great vogue in\r\nthe near future, and will be in much demand as soon as its production\r\nis on a scale which makes it accessible to the people of ordinary\r\nmeans. The edible part of the fruit is a sweet, soft substance with\r\nan agreeable taste and of a semi-solid consistence. It has a nutty and\r\npeculiar flavor which is highly prized.\r\n\r\nIn the regions where the alligator pear is grown it is often used in\r\nthe raw state or after having been treated with a little salt. It is\r\nhighly prized when served in this manner. It is also often cut into\r\nsmall pieces and put into soup and is said to give a most agreeable\r\nodor and flavor thereto. The ripe fruit has different colors; it may be\r\ngreen, yellow, brown or dark purple or a combination of any of these\r\ncolors. The alligator pear is particularly valued as a salad fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Avocado._--\r\n\r\n  Water,             81.10 percent\r\n  Protein,            1.00    „\r\n  Fat,               10.20    „\r\n  Starch and sugar,   6.80    „\r\n  Ash,                 .90    „\r\n\r\nThe above data show that the alligator pear is not a fruit which is\r\nvery highly nutritious. Its principle nutrient is fat, the next most\r\nimportant being starch and sugar, but it is extremely deficient in\r\nprotein, and therefore could not be regarded as a balanced ration. Its\r\nprinciple value, therefore, is mostly on account of its condimental\r\nproperties rather than for its nutrients. Bulletins 61 and 77 of the\r\nBureau of Plant Industry, Department of Agriculture, give important\r\ninformation regarding the avocado. The accompanying illustration is\r\ntaken from Bulletin 77, above mentioned.\r\n\r\nFrom the amount of fat in the alligator pear it might be regarded as\r\na nut instead of a fruit, but its paucity of nitrogenous constituents\r\nexcludes it from that category.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bananas= (_Musa_).--One of the most abundant and most important of\r\nthe tropical fruits, for food purposes, is the banana. The banana\r\nis not grown to any extent for food purposes in the United States,\r\nthough it is produced on a limited scale in southern Florida. Immense\r\nquantities of bananas come into this country from the Central American\r\nstates, particularly from Guatemala and Nicaragua. This fruit can be\r\nlanded at New Orleans at very small expense for transportation, and for\r\nthis reason can be distributed all over the country at a price which\r\nlooks to be ridiculously small when it is considered that the fruit\r\ncomes from so great a distance. It is also sent in large quantities\r\nto other ports, notably New York, Boston, and Baltimore. For shipping\r\npurposes the banana is gathered while still green, and often the\r\nripening has not reached the stage when the ordinary yellow color\r\nwhich characterizes the ripe fruit is seen when it reaches the markets\r\nin the center of the country. The banana is not only valued for its\r\npeculiar flavor, which is pleasant and sweet, sometimes almost too much\r\nso, but it also has a high nutritive value, being a substance rich in\r\ncarbohydrates and growing in such abundance that its price is within\r\nthe reach of the poorest classes. Great quantities of bananas are also\r\ngrown in Cuba, but they are mostly consumed by the native population,\r\nforming one of the principal foods of the island.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--AVOCADO TREE.--(_Courtesy Department of\r\nAgriculture._)]\r\n\r\nThe banana has perhaps less waste than almost any other fruit, as\r\nthe whole of the inner portion is edible. In the green fruit there\r\nis a large proportion of starch, which gradually changes into invert\r\nsugar in the ripe fruit. In thoroughly mature bananas the quantity of\r\nsugar is relatively high and the quantity of starch correspondingly\r\nlow. Bananas are not only eaten raw but also fried and in various\r\nother forms. The banana is a fruit which, when properly cared for,\r\ncan be transported over long distances and kept for a long time. When\r\nproperly prepared the banana forms a nutritious diet, probably equal\r\nin value to the same amount of solid matter contained in the common\r\nfresh fruits. One hundred grams may be taken as the average weight\r\nof the banana, although some of them are very much larger. About 70\r\npercent of the banana is edible and 30 percent inedible, that is, the\r\nskin, which while not wholly inedible is usually rejected. The banana\r\nis essentially a carbohydrate food, the percentage of protein not\r\nusually rising above 1.3. Nearly all the carbohydrates in the ripe\r\nfruit consist of sugars which are present both as reducing and as cane\r\nsugars. The average total percentage of sugar present in the banana is\r\na little over 20.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the banana is shown in the following table which\r\ncontains the data of analyses of two samples bought in the open market\r\nin Washington.\r\n\r\n  ---------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n           |  EDIBLE  |  SOLIDS. |   TOTAL  | PROTEIN. |   ASH.\r\n           | PORTION. |          |  SUGARS. |          |\r\n  ---------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n           |_Percent._|_Percent._|_Percent._|_Percent._|_Percent._\r\n  Sample 1,|  62.10   |  26.13   |  21.71   |   1.13   |    .84\r\n  Sample 2,|  64.50   |  26.24   |  21.76   |   1.21   |    .86\r\n  ---------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n\r\nThe analytical data were obtained upon the edible portion and not upon\r\nthe whole fruit.\r\n\r\nThe bananas which are imported from Jamaica and Central America are\r\nrepresented by the analyses given above. They are commonly known as\r\nthe Johnson banana. Smaller fruits with better flavors are grown in\r\nCuba,--some of them are of a red color like the oronoco and colorado.\r\nThe indiano is a large, yellow, angular fruit with a salmon-colored\r\npulp and a rather disagreeable acid flavor.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the banana as a food product it is seen that,\r\nincluding the starch and digestible cellulose, it consists of at least\r\n25 percent, in its edible portion, of carbohydrates suitable for food\r\npurposes. Its low content of protein indicates that it is not a well\r\nbalanced ration, but should be eaten in connection with beans, peas,\r\nor other vegetables rich in protein, or with lean meat in order to\r\nsecure a proper quantity of protein in the diet.\r\n\r\nOn account of the great abundance of the product and luxuriance of\r\ngrowth in the Central American states, it is evident that the banana\r\nmight become a profitable source of industrial alcohol in that locality.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cashew= (=Maranon=) (_Anacardium occidentale_).--The cashew, of which\r\nthe principal habitat is Cuba, is a small, oddly shaped, yellow and\r\nred fruit from two to three inches long and from ¹⁄₂ to two inches\r\nin diameter at the bottom, decreasing gradually in diameter toward\r\nthe top. The seed is small and kidney-shaped and grows outside of the\r\nfruit at the lower end. The seed is regarded as poisonous until it has\r\nbeen roasted, due probably to the presence of hydrocyanic acid. After\r\nroasting it is regarded as a delectable edible. The meat of the seed of\r\nthe cashew resembles the roasted chestnut, but contains more oil. The\r\npulp is of a dull yellow color, is tough and very juicy, with an acid\r\nastringent flavor and a disagreeable odor. The fruit is not eaten raw\r\nbut chiefly in preserves. The composition of the cashew is shown in the\r\nfollowing table:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Edible Portion--85.9 percent._--\r\n\r\n  Solids,  12.84 percent\r\n  Sugar,    6.76    „\r\n  Acid,      .31    „\r\n  Ash,       .36    „\r\n\r\nThe composition is somewhat like that of the hicaco, but the cashew\r\ncontains a larger proportion of acid and hence is better suited for\r\npreserves. The sample of cashew preserves examined had the following\r\ncomposition:\r\n\r\n  Solids,   71.22 percent\r\n  Sugar,    66.89    „\r\n  Protein,    .26    „\r\n  Acidity,    .08    „\r\n  Ash,        .14    „\r\n\r\n\r\n=Citrus Fruits.=--The term “citrus fruit” is applied to that class\r\nof fruits represented by the orange, lemon, grape fruit, and lime.\r\nIn the United States extensive areas are devoted to the production\r\nof citrus fruits, and it is claimed by connoisseurs that some of the\r\nbest varieties grown anywhere in the world are the products of this\r\ncountry. Florida and southern California are two localities where\r\nthe development of the citrus fruit industry has been carried to the\r\ngreatest extent. The phenomenally cold winter which occurred in Florida\r\nsome ten years ago almost ruined the citrus fruit industry in that\r\nstate for the time being. In the reëstablishment of it the center of\r\nproduction has been extended farther south than it was before. It\r\nis believed that at the present time the industry has been extended\r\nsufficiently far south in the Florida peninsula to avoid any repetition\r\nof the great disaster which ruined the citrus groves in certain\r\nportions of the state at the time mentioned. The climate of southern\r\nCalifornia is more equable, and no injury has ever been experienced in\r\nthat location from very low temperature. In Florida the oranges are\r\ncultivated without irrigation, while in southern California irrigation\r\nis universally practiced. The seasonal conditions are therefore under\r\nbetter control in California than in Florida.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRYING FIGS\r\n\r\n  1. SMYRNA          3. ADRIATIC\r\n  2. SMYRNA SECTION  4. ADRIATIC SECTION\r\n\r\n_From Yearbook, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, 1897_]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Figs= (_Ficus carica_ L.).--The fig is a fruit which is well known in\r\nbiblical and profane history. Together with the grape it is the fruit\r\nwhich is most often mentioned in the Bible.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the fig as a fruit and food is recognized in all\r\nthe earlier writings, both sacred and profane. When dried and pressed\r\ninto convenient forms it is a food which can be easily transported,\r\nand makes a ration well suited to supply heat and energy, although\r\ndeficient in nitrogen in so far as a complete ration is concerned.\r\nThe fig tree is extensively cultivated in all localities where the\r\ntemperature permits its growth. It grows in the open in the whole\r\nsouthern part of the United States, and I have seen fig trees of large\r\nsize grow in the yard as far north as Washington.\r\n\r\nThe fig tree grows luxuriantly and to a great size in California, and\r\nthe fruit, both fresh and dried, is of superior excellence. A typical\r\nillustration of a California fig tree is shown in Fig. 51.\r\n\r\nThe Smyrna fig has lately been introduced into the southern and western\r\npart of the United States with great success. It grows especially well\r\nin the southern part of California and Arizona. The Smyrna fig is one\r\nof the varieties which requires fertilization of the flower through the\r\nmediation of an insect. This process is called caprification. Although\r\nthis variety of fig has only been introduced into California to any\r\nextent in the last five or six years, the growth of this most highly\r\nesteemed variety has so increased that at the present time the output\r\nof California alone amounts to about twelve million pounds per annum.\r\nThe Smyrna and Adriatic figs, used largely for drying and preserving\r\npurposes, are seen in their natural colors in the appended colored\r\nplate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Fresh Figs (Edible Portion)._--\r\n\r\n  Water,             79.11 percent\r\n  Protein,            1.52    „\r\n  Sugar,             15.53    „\r\n  Pure ash,            .58    „\r\n  Fat, fiber, etc.,   3.26    „\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Dried Figs._--\r\n\r\n  Water,            28.78 percent\r\n  Total sugar,      51.43    „\r\n  Acid as malic,      .71    „\r\n  Protein,           3.58    „\r\n  Ether extract,     1.27    „\r\n  Cellulose, etc.,   5.29    „\r\n  Crude fiber,       6.19    „\r\n  Ash,               2.75    „\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--FIG TREE THIRTY FEET HIGH NEAR YUBA,\r\nCALIFORNIA.--(_Photograph by H. W. Wiley._)]\r\n\r\nThe interesting process of caprification is thus described by Professor\r\nHugh N. Starnes of the Georgia Experiment Station:\r\n\r\n“In the base or false ovary of the gall flowers, which are merely\r\ndegenerate pistillates, the egg of the _Blastophaga grossorum_ or fig\r\nwasp--a minute insect--is deposited and develops to maturity. The\r\nwingless males emerge first and, with their powerful mandibles, cut\r\ninto the flowers containing the female wasps, partially release them,\r\nand impregnate them. The gravid females shortly complete the liberating\r\nprocess and, being winged, at once seek to escape for the instinctive\r\npurpose of laying their eggs. They emerge from the eye of the\r\ncaprifig, after squeezing through the mass of pollen-covered anthers\r\nprotecting the exit, and seek other fruit in which to lay their eggs.\r\nNaturally they would enter the nearest caprifig in the proper stage of\r\ndevelopment. But, meanwhile, if the caprifig containing the colony has\r\nbeen plucked from its stem and suspended in the branches of an adjacent\r\nSmyrna tree, the female on emerging forces her way in a fruit of the\r\nlatter class, losing her wings in the process, and at once begins a\r\nfrantic scramble around the interior, searching for the anticipated\r\ngall flowers in which to deposit her eggs. Failing, necessarily, to\r\nfind them, and incapable of again taking flight, she finally curls up\r\nand dies heartbroken, but not until she and her companions have between\r\nthem pollinated every female flower in the cavity with the plentiful\r\nstore of pollen conveyed from the caprifig--thereby insuring the\r\ndevelopment of the fruit.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=Grape Fruit= (=Pomelo=) (_Citrus decumana_).--The so-called grape\r\nfruit or pomelo is one of the biggest products of the citrus family and\r\nalso possesses properties which may be regarded as a cross between the\r\nlemon and the orange. It is more acid than the orange and more sweet\r\nthan the lemon. This fruit is perhaps more highly esteemed than any\r\nother citrus variety for direct edible purposes, forming a breakfast\r\ndish which is eaten very extensively throughout all parts of the United\r\nStates by those who are able to afford the luxury, for so it still is\r\nby reason of the high price of the product. Grape fruit grows to a\r\nlarge extent in the United States, and its culture is confined to the\r\nsame region as that where the orange and lemon are grown.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Grape Fruit (Pomelo)._--The composition of the pomelo\r\nas given for the California product (Station Report, 1892, p. 256)\r\nshows this fruit to have the following composition:\r\n\r\n  Average weight,  357.00 grams\r\n  Rind,             23.50 percent\r\n  Seeds,             3.70    „\r\n  Edible portion,   72.80    „\r\n\r\nComposition of the juice from the edible portion:\r\n\r\n  Total solids,       13.20 percent\r\n  Total sugars,        9.50    „\r\n  Acids (as citric),   2.70    „\r\n\r\nProfessor Colby says in discussing these analyses that the proportion\r\nof acid is larger in these samples than the general taste demands.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cuban Grape Fruit._--The grape fruit which is grown in Cuba has quite\r\na different character. Its flavor is mild, and it is almost devoid of\r\nthe bitter taste which is found in the American product, and which\r\nadds greatly to its palatable properties when the consumer becomes\r\naccustomed to it.\r\n\r\nA marmalade is made from the grape fruit similar in all respects,\r\nexcept the peculiar flavor given by the raw material, to that made\r\nfrom oranges. It is evident from its high palatable properties and its\r\nwholesomeness that grape fruit will become more and more an article of\r\nvalue and be consumed in large quantities throughout the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Guava= (_Psidium Guajava_).--This fruit is grown very extensively in\r\nboth California and Florida, also in Cuba, where a number of varieties\r\ngrow wild. The white guava is a small, round fruit, grayish-white\r\nor yellow in color, and having an average weight of 1.5 ounces. The\r\npear-shaped fruit, the guava of Peru, is about twice the size of\r\nthe white variety, but otherwise resembles it very closely. Both\r\nvarieties contain large numbers of small seeds scattered throughout\r\nthe yellowish-white pulp. As a rule the guava is not eaten raw, but it\r\nis a fruit from which some of the most highly prized jelly pastes and\r\npreserves are made.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Guava._--The guava contains, in its fresh state,\r\nan average of a little less than 80 percent of water and a little\r\nmore than 20 percent of solid matter. The solid materials in guavas\r\nare quite insoluble in water, more than one-half of them not passing\r\ninto solution. The chief part of the soluble constituents of guavas\r\nare the sugars, and these exist chiefly in the invert state. The total\r\npercentage of sugar in guavas in the fresh state averages about six,\r\nthe protein amounts to about one percent, and the ash to a little over\r\none-half of one percent. The value of the guava, therefore, is more\r\ncondimental than nutritive, and for this reason it is seen why it is\r\nnot a valuable food product eaten in the raw state.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Guava Preserves._--A large number of preserves are made from the\r\nguava, and these products are well known and relished throughout the\r\ncountry. The preserves are in various forms, being chiefly pastes,\r\nmarmalades, and jellies. These preparations contain the aromas and\r\nflavoring qualities of the fruit, and when pure contain no added\r\nproduct save sugar. They contain from 60 to 75 percent of added\r\nsugar. The preserved products of the guava are generally packed in\r\nwooden boxes, lined with paper, though some are packed in glass. The\r\ncrystallized guava, the guava cream, and the pastes contain large\r\nquantities of added sugar, namely, about 80 percent. These preserves\r\nnaturally have a very low acid content by reason of the quantity of\r\nsugar which has been added in their preparation. In this country often\r\nthe whole fruits are preserved in sugar sirup.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hicaco= (_Chrysobalanus icaco_).--The fruit of the hicaco is small and\r\nround, varying from one to three inches in diameter. The average weight\r\nof each fruit is about ¹⁄₄ oz. The skin is thin and green in color,\r\nshading to red on the side exposed to the sun. It grows on a small\r\nshrub and is sometimes called the cocoa plum. The surface is somewhat\r\nshrivelled and wrinkled, and the seed weighs almost half as much as the\r\nwhole fruit. The fruit is not eaten in a fresh state, but is used for\r\nmaking preserves. It is sweet to the taste and has a low acid content.\r\nThe composition of the fresh fruit is shown by the following table:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Edible Portion--68.9 percent._--\r\n\r\n  Total solids,  14.29 percent\r\n  Total sugar,    5.18    „\r\n  Protein,         .46    „\r\n  Acidity,         .10    „\r\n  Ash,             .96    „\r\n\r\nThese data show that the hicaco is a fruit low in nutritive value, in\r\nso far as sugar is concerned, of a low content of protein and very\r\nslight acidity.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hicaco Preserves._--A sample of hicaco preserves was found to have the\r\nfollowing composition:\r\n\r\n  Total solids,  65.07 percent\r\n  Sugar,         60.08    „\r\n  Protein,         .12    „\r\n  Ash,             .14    „\r\n  Acidity,         .05    „\r\n\r\nThe above data indicate only the change in composition which would\r\ncome from adding the sugar in the process of manufacture. By reason\r\nof the low acidity of the fruit the sugar in the preserves would,\r\ntheoretically, be largely cane sugar. In the case mentioned, however,\r\none-third of the sugar was inverted. Whether this was accomplished by\r\nthe action of the acid on the sugar during the process of manufacture\r\nor whether by the use of molasses instead of sugar in the preserves\r\ndoes not appear. More likely it is due to the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Kumquat= (_Citrus japonica_).--The kumquat is one of the smallest of\r\ncitrus fruits. It stands as one extreme of that important family of\r\nwhich the grape fruit or pomelo represents the other. The fruit is\r\noval in shape, about one inch in diameter, and is one and one-half\r\ninches long. It may be regarded as a dwarf orange, and was brought\r\ninto the United States from Japan, although it is a native of China.\r\nThe name--kumquat--is of Chinese origin and is intended to mean “Gold\r\nOrange.” The kumquat tree, under favorable circumstances, reaches a\r\nheight of 10 or 12 feet and forms a compact, symmetrical, and handsome\r\nhead. The pulp of the fruit is very tender and agreeably acid and the\r\nrind is spicy, as is the case with most of the acid fruits. It is\r\nnot only valued as a fruit, but the tree is also highly prized as an\r\nornament. Its beautifully colored fruit, in contrast with its green\r\nleaves, presents a most agreeable spectacle. It is grown in the United\r\nStates principally in Florida. The composition of the kumquat is\r\npractically that of the orange.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lemons.=--The citrus fruit, next in importance to the orange, if not\r\nmore important, is the lemon (_Citrus limonum_). This fruit is grown\r\nextensively in the United States in the same localities that produce\r\nthe orange, that is, chiefly in Florida and southern California.\r\nIts method of cultivation, general treatment, time of ripening and\r\nharvesting are the same as that of the orange. Its principal difference\r\nfrom the orange is in its greater acidity and in certain peculiarities\r\nof its aromatic and oily substances. From the rind is produced an\r\nessential oil which, while resembling that of the orange in general\r\ncharacter, has distinct properties which easily discriminate it\r\nfrom the orange product. The lemon also has a correspondingly less\r\nproportion of sugar than the orange. In 22 analyses of California\r\nlemons they were found to contain 5.26 percent of acid and only 2.33\r\npercent of sugar. The distinct feature of the lemon, therefore, is its\r\nacidity. The principal acid present in lemons is citric acid, though\r\nother organic acids are also found. The acids are either free or in\r\ncombination with a base, the principal base being potash. On account\r\nof its high acidity and low sugar content the lemon is used more as\r\na relish and in the manufacture of acid beverages than directly as a\r\nfood. There are some varieties known as sweet lemons which are eaten as\r\noranges or used directly for food purposes, but generally the lemon is\r\ntoo sour and acid for consumption in this manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lime.=--A species of citrus fruit which is even more acid than the\r\nlemon is known as the lime (_Citrus hysrix acida_).\r\n\r\nLimes are not eaten directly as food on account of their high acidity,\r\nbut their expressed juice is sold throughout the world for beverages\r\nand medicinal purposes. The lime also yields an essential oil, which\r\nis very similar in character to that derived from lemons. In fact the\r\nlime may be regarded as a very sour lemon, just as the orange may be\r\nregarded as a very sweet one.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Lime Juice._--Unfortunately lime juice is offered\r\non the market often in entirely spurious forms, that is, a mixture\r\nmade up with flavoring of an acid character resembling that of the\r\nnatural juice. The natural juice is also frequently adulterated by the\r\naddition of preservatives. Among these, sulfurous and salicylic acids\r\nare perhaps the most frequent. Lime juice can be perfectly preserved by\r\nsterilization, and there is no necessity for the use of preservatives\r\ntherein.\r\n\r\nIn the tropics there is also found a lime of a saccharine character\r\nknown as the sweet lime, but this fruit does not have a very great\r\nvogue.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mamey Colorado.=--This is a tropical fruit which is very extensively\r\ngrown in Cuba, and derives its local name from a very slight outward\r\nresemblance to the mammee (_Mammea americana_). These two fruits,\r\nhowever, have no botanical or other relation to each other, nor do they\r\nhave any internal resemblance. The mamey colorado is chocolate brown\r\nin color, oval or round in shape, and its average weight is about 1.5\r\npounds. The skin is thick and coarse. The pulp has a yellowish color,\r\nvarying to a deep scarlet, and is slightly fibrous and firm, but\r\nmealy and rather dry. It has a sweetish taste with very little acid\r\nflavor. It is eaten chiefly in the fresh state and is also stewed with\r\nsugar. The fruit usually contains but one seed, though as many as four\r\nare sometimes found. The seeds are imbedded in a soft core and are\r\nirregularly oval. The natural season is from December to August. These\r\nfruits are very largely used for making preserves.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the mamey colorado is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Edible Portion--86.10 percent._--\r\n\r\n  Solids,       34.01 percent\r\n  Total ash,      .80    „\r\n  Acid,           .10    „\r\n  Total sugar,  22.05    „\r\n\r\nThe analysis shows that the mamey colorado is a fruit which in its\r\nedible properties and nutritive value very closely resembles the banana.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mamey de Santo Domingo= (_Mammea americana_).--This is a fruit\r\nextensively used in Cuba and other tropical countries. It is of a\r\nlight brown color, from three to ten inches in diameter, and weighs\r\nsometimes as much as 1¹⁄₂ pounds. The skin is thick and fibrous, the\r\nouter surface being tough and covered with small brown spots. The\r\npulp is dark yellow in color, firm, and very juicy. It has a sweet\r\ncharacteristic flavor and a pleasant aromatic odor. The seeds sometimes\r\nmeasure three inches in diameter and cling tenaciously to the pulp.\r\nIt is very commonly eaten raw and is highly esteemed for preserving\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the mamey de Santo Domingo is shown in the following\r\ntable:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Edible Portion--60.70 percent._--\r\n\r\n  Solids,       14.12 percent\r\n  Total ash,      .31    „\r\n  Acids,          .42    „\r\n  Protein,        .49    „\r\n  Total sugar,   9.47    „\r\n\r\nThe above data show that this fruit is very much less sweet and very\r\nmuch more acid than the mamey colorado and for nutritive purposes is\r\nof much less value, but by reason of its greater acidity and higher\r\nflavoring it is more suitable for the manufacture of preserves than\r\nthe fruit resembling it in external appearances and name. It is used\r\nextensively in the manufacture of preserves and marmalades which are so\r\nsimilar in composition as not to be distinguished from each other by\r\ntheir chemical analyses.\r\n\r\nThe compositions of a preserve known as mamey en almibar and a\r\nmarmalade known as mermelade de mamey are shown in the following table:\r\n\r\n  ---------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n           |          |  TOTAL   |          |          |  TOTAL\r\n           |  SOLIDS. |   ASH.   |  ACIDS.  | PROTEIN. | SUGARS.\r\n  ---------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n           |_Percent._|_Percent._|_Percent._|_Percent._|_Percent._\r\n  Mamey en |          |          |          |          |\r\n  almibar, |  60.05   |   .154   |   .194   |   .363   |  57.45\r\n  Mermelade|          |          |          |          |\r\n  de mamey,|  69.74   |   .149   |   .123   |   .269   |  62.68\r\n  ---------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--JAMAICA MANGO TREE.--(_By permission American\r\nNut and Fruit Co._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mango= (_Magnifera indica_ L.).--The mango is a fruit which is highly\r\nprized throughout the world. It is a native of southern Asia, where it\r\nhas been known from earliest times. In the United States the mango is\r\nchiefly grown in Florida as a horticultural crop. The mango is a tree\r\npeculiarly sensitive to frost, and therefore does not grow as far north\r\nas oranges. Its profitable cultivation at present is confined to the\r\nextreme southern part of the Florida peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe mango is an evergreen tree. In Florida, under favorable conditions\r\nof growth, it reaches as high as 40 or 50 feet. It makes a tree of\r\ngraceful appearance with a dense, dome-shaped top. The color of the\r\nmango fruit is varied; it may be red, green, or yellow, or a mixture of\r\nthese colors. The tree and fruit both possess an agreeable odor, and\r\nevery part of the tree, almost, can be of some economic value. The ripe\r\nfruit is a delicious dessert and is wholesome. It is often recommended\r\nfor its medicinal properties. The rind and fiber, as well as the unripe\r\nfruit, are acid and full of tannin, which makes them astringent to the\r\ntaste. Mangos may be eaten in the raw state, and they are also valued\r\nfor making preserves, pickles, marmalades, and jelly. A very popular\r\nsauce known as mango chutney is prepared from the mango and is largely\r\nused in the United States and England, being mostly imported from\r\nIndia. The appearance of the tree is shown in Fig. 52.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Oranges= (_Citrus aurantium_).--This fruit is characterized by its\r\ndelightful flavor and by the distribution of certain aromatic oils,\r\nespecially in the rind, which give it a peculiar aroma and flavor. The\r\norange has a thick yellow rind which, while edible, is not usually\r\neaten, but is the source of valuable essential oils. A large part\r\nof the orange, as far as weight is concerned, is not usually eaten;\r\nusually from 25 to 40 percent of the weight is in the rind or some\r\ninedible portion. The ash of the orange is usually less than one-half\r\nof one percent. The predominant organic acid of the orange is citric,\r\nalthough other organic acids are present. The quantity of protein\r\npresent in an orange is very small, usually not exceeding very much a\r\nhalf of one percent. The quantity of sugar varies greatly in different\r\nsamples. It is present both as cane sugar or sucrose and as reducing\r\nor invert sugar. In the very sweet orange the quantity reaches as\r\nhigh as 10 percent or even greater, while in the sour orange it is\r\nless. The principal food value of the orange, as far as nutriment\r\nis concerned, is its sugar. The orange, however, has other valuable\r\nproperties, especially from a hygienic standpoint, aside from its\r\nnutriment. The organic salts which it contains, the organic acids, and\r\nother condimental material make the orange an exceptionally wholesome\r\nfruit, exercising a beneficial effect upon the digestive process and\r\nespecially aiding in the passage of the undigested food through the\r\nalimentary canal. The orange is a fruit which has lasting keeping\r\nqualities. It is not unusual to see ripe oranges which are edible\r\nhanging on the same tree with the blossoms which are blooming for the\r\nnext year’s crop. In California and Florida the oranges begin to ripen\r\nin November and may be continuously harvested until the following\r\nApril, if it be advisable to leave them on the tree for that length of\r\ntime. Owing to the thick and resistant skin of the orange, it can be\r\nkept for a long time without material deterioration after harvesting,\r\nif care be taken to avoid bruising or injuring the fruit in any way\r\nwhile handling. Oranges thus harvested and wrapped in paper and kept\r\nat a low temperature will keep for weeks and even months, and still be\r\nedible and nourishing. This property of the orange makes it possible\r\nto supply the markets of the world practically throughout the entire\r\nyear with one of the most delicious and nutritious of fruits. In former\r\nyears the orange was regarded as a luxury, but at the present time it\r\nis a staple article of diet even for people in moderate circumstances,\r\nand is often eaten by those who are poor. In Fig. 53 is given a typical\r\nillustration of a California orange grove.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.--AN EDGE OF A CALIFORNIA ORANGE GROVE.--(_Bureau\r\nof Plant Industry._)]\r\n\r\nThe culture of the orange has demanded the highest agricultural and\r\nscientific skill, and perhaps there is no crop produced to which\r\ngreater attention has been paid. In Florida, especially, the oranges\r\nare grown on soil which is not much more than poor sand, and hence the\r\nscientific feeding of the trees, that is, the fertilization of the\r\nsoil in which they grow, is necessary to success. As a result of this\r\napplication of science luxuriant crops of oranges are found growing\r\nupon sandy soil which without scientific treatment would be almost\r\nbarren. The soils in southern California, on the other hand, are very\r\nrich in natural plant food, but this does not obviate the necessity\r\nof scientific manuring. Oranges grow throughout the year in tropical\r\nand semi-tropical regions. It is considered by connoisseurs, however,\r\nthat the oranges grown in the semi-tropical regions, that is far enough\r\nnorth for a little frost to come during the winter, but without a\r\nsufficient degree of cold to injure the trees, are of better quality\r\nthan those grown in tropical regions where frost is unknown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.--THE ORIGINAL SEEDLESS ORANGE TREE.--(_Courtesy\r\nBureau of Plant Industry._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Seedless Orange._--The variety of orange which contains no seed\r\nhas been widely cultivated in the United States, and by reason of the\r\nabsence of seeds is more highly prized by many than the ordinary orange\r\nfor edible purposes. Since the orange tree has been cultivated by\r\ngrafting rather than by direct production of the different varieties\r\nfrom the natural seed, it has been possible to secure a fruit without\r\nseeds. Whether such an unnatural product will continue to maintain its\r\nhigh rank as an edible product remains to be seen. The seedless orange\r\ntree, from which are descended the greater part of these trees in the\r\nUnited States, was secured by Mr. William Sanders from Bahia. Its\r\npresent appearance in the greenhouse of the Department of Agriculture\r\nis shown in Fig. 54. The naval orange is exceedingly beautiful as it\r\ngrows upon the tree. A bunch of these oranges growing on the parent\r\ntree in Washington is shown in Fig. 55.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--A GROUP OF THE WASHINGTON NAVEL ORANGE ON THE\r\nTREE.--(_Courtesy Bureau of Plant Industry._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pineapple.=--The pineapple is a fruit grown very extensively in\r\ntropical and also subtropical countries. It is a crop of great\r\nimportance in Florida. The flavor and aroma of the pineapple grown\r\nin subtropical countries is often preferred to that of the tropical\r\ngrown fruit. Pineapples grow best when sheltered to some extent from\r\nthe direct rays of the sun. In Florida it is planted near live oaks,\r\nwhere a partial shade is secured. It is often artificially covered by\r\nmeans of narrow boards placed near together and yet leaving abundant\r\nspace for the sunlight. Sometimes these covered fields are two or three\r\nacres in extent. In Fig. 56 is given a representation of the pineapple\r\ngrowing under a covering of this kind in Florida at the Agricultural\r\nExperiment Station, Lake City.\r\n\r\nFormerly pineapples were regarded as great luxuries, and often were set\r\nup in the center of the table as an ornament rather than as a dessert.\r\nThey have now become very common and are frequently used as a dessert,\r\nfor flavoring ice cream, for preserving, and for general use as a fruit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--COVERED PINEAPPLE.--(_Courtesy of Florida\r\nExperiment Station._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Pineapples._--The only adulterations which are found\r\nin pineapples are of course in the canned product. Investigations in\r\nthe Bureau of Chemistry show that adulteration is not extensively\r\npracticed, unless the addition of cane sugar without notice can be so\r\nregarded.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the collection of duties, the addition of\r\ncane sugar without notice is an adulteration, since under provision\r\nof law pineapples canned in their own juice pay one rate of duty and\r\nwhen preserved with sugar pay another. Inasmuch as the label of a food\r\nproduct should tell the whole truth concerning it, the addition of\r\ncane sugar, without notice to that effect upon the label, is calculated\r\nto deceive and should not be practiced. There is no objection of any\r\nkind to the use of cane sugar in the canning of pineapples if the\r\nlabel indicates that this has been done. On the other hand there is no\r\nreason why the addition of sugar should be practiced. The pineapples\r\nare bought and consumed for their natural flavor, and not on account of\r\nthe added sugar which they may contain. In the canning of pineapples it\r\nis just as easy to secure complete sterilization in their own juice as\r\nit is to secure it with the added sirup. In practice, however, it is\r\nmore convenient after filling the cans with the pieces of pines to add\r\na sugar sirup to fill up the spaces than to secure sterilization by the\r\napplication of heat alone, which would not cause a sufficient quantity\r\nof juice to exude to fill up the interstices of the cans, and they,\r\ntherefore, would be partially empty.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Canned Pineapples._--There is a very large trade in this country in\r\ncanned pineapples imported from Singapore and the Straits Settlements\r\nand the Bahamas. The pines are usually canned with the addition of\r\nsugar, and those that come to our ports are as a rule sweetened only\r\nwith cane sugar.\r\n\r\nA large number of analyses has been made of these canned pineapples in\r\nthe Bureau of Chemistry and the general data which were secured are\r\npresented below:\r\n\r\nCanned pineapples from Singapore, average, maximum, and minimum\r\ncomposition:\r\n\r\n  --------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n          |  SOLIDS. |  SUGAR.  | PROTEIN. |   ASH.   | ACIDITY.\r\n  --------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n          |_Percent._|_Percent._|_Percent._|_Percent._|_Percent._\r\n  Average,|  20.15   |  17.90   |    .46   |    .28   |   .30\r\n  Maximum,|  25.30   |  25.10   |    .60   |    .36   |   .43\r\n  Minimum,|  18.18   |  14.87   |    .39   |    .21   |   .16\r\n  --------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n\r\nThe above data show that it is possible to compute the average quantity\r\nof sugar which is added in the preparation of the sample. If we assume\r\nin round numbers that the natural pine contains 12 percent of sugar,\r\nwe find that approximately eight pounds per hundred of fruit have been\r\nadded in the preparation of the pines from Singapore.\r\n\r\nBelow is found the average, maximum, and minimum composition of ten\r\nsamples of canned pineapples from the Straits Settlements:\r\n\r\n  --------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n          |  SOLIDS. |  SUGAR.  | PROTEIN. |   ASH.   | ACIDITY.\r\n  --------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n          |_Percent._|_Percent._|_Percent._|_Percent._|_Percent._\r\n  Average,|  21.04   |  18.45   |    .47   |    .26   |   .26\r\n  Maximum,|  24.28   |  21.94   |    .57   |    .32   |   .32\r\n  Minimum,|  17.32   |  14.54   |    .39   |    .22   |   .17\r\n  --------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n\r\nThese data show that the preparation of the pines in the Straits\r\nSettlements for shipment in cans is the same as that in Singapore. The\r\naverage amount of sugar added appears to be about one percent greater.\r\n\r\nAverage composition of canned pineapples from the Bahamas:\r\n\r\n  --------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n          |  SOLIDS. |  SUGAR.  | PROTEIN. |   ASH.   | ACIDITY.\r\n  --------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n          |_Percent._|_Percent._|_Percent._|_Percent._|_Percent._\r\n  Average,|  13.78   |  10.69   |    .34   |    .38   |    .57\r\n  Maximum,|  26.78   |  22.43   |    .46   |    .50   |   1.18\r\n  Minimum,|   8.54   |   6.33   |    .20   |    .22   |    .22\r\n  --------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n\r\nThe above data show that nearly all the canned pineapples coming from\r\nthe Bahamas must be regarded as canned in their natural juice without\r\nthe addition of sugar. Of the whole number of samples examined, only\r\nfour gave any indication of containing added sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Pineapple._--The average composition of twenty-two\r\nsamples of fresh pineapple grown in Florida, as determined in the\r\nBureau of Chemistry, is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Total solids,  13.85 percent\r\n  Total sugar,   11.69    „\r\n  Protein,         .40    „\r\n  Ash,             .42    „\r\n  Acidity,         .52    „\r\n\r\nOf the sugars 4.44 percent existed in the form of invert or reducing\r\nsugar and 6.88 percent as cane sugar. These data show that the value\r\nof a pineapple as a food product lies chiefly in the sugar which it\r\ncontains. The ethereal and aromatic properties of the pineapple give to\r\nit its chief value as a food, since it is the flavor and aroma rather\r\nthan the nutriment in the fruit which make it valued as a food. These\r\nflavors and aromas are due to essential oils and ethers or compound\r\nethers, and they exist in such minute quantities as to escape ordinary\r\nchemical investigation. A study of the details of analyses show that\r\nthere is a wide variation in the percentage of sugar. In two instances\r\nthe total sugar fell below eight percent, but those evidently were\r\ngreen and imperfect samples and were not included in the general\r\naverage.\r\n\r\nThe highest quantity of sugar found in any case of a Florida pineapple\r\nwas 15.28 percent.\r\n\r\nThe data show that in general it may be said that the Florida pineapple\r\ncontains nearly 12 percent of its weight of sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Average Composition of Cuban Pineapples._--The average composition of\r\n10 samples of Cuban pineapples examined in the Bureau of Chemistry is\r\nshown in the following data:\r\n\r\n  Total solids,  14.52 percent\r\n  Sugars,        11.87    „\r\n  Protein,         .40    „\r\n  Ash,             .35    „\r\n  Acidity,         .56    „\r\n\r\nThese data show that the Cuban pineapple is only a trifle sweeter than\r\nthat grown in Florida and has in general the same composition.\r\n\r\nThe Florida pineapples when placed on the market have qualities which\r\nare by most connoisseurs judged to be superior to those of Cuban\r\norigin, although these qualities are not indicated by any marked\r\ndifference in the analytical results.\r\n\r\nThe average composition of Bahama pineapples, examined in the Bureau of\r\nChemistry, is given in the following table:\r\n\r\n  Total solids,  14.81 percent\r\n  Sugar,         12.22    „\r\n  Protein,         .48    „\r\n  Ash,             .40    „\r\n  Acidity,         .77    „\r\n\r\nThe Bahama pineapple, as is seen by the above data, is somewhat sweeter\r\nthan the Florida or Cuban grown fruit and also has a higher acidity.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Average Composition of Porto Rican Pineapples._--Two samples of Porto\r\nRican pines, examined in the Bureau of Chemistry, had the following\r\ncomposition:\r\n\r\n  Total solids,  15.91 percent\r\n  Total sugar,   15.36    „\r\n  Protein,         .48    „\r\n  Ash,             .37    „\r\n  Acidity,         .72    „\r\n\r\nThe other samples of pines coming from Porto Rico were so immature that\r\nit was found they contained only about one-half the percentage of sugar\r\nand one-half the total solids of the ripened fruits. They were probably\r\nharvested in an immature state in order to withstand the vicissitudes\r\nof transportation. The above data show that the ripe pines of Porto\r\nRico are even richer than those of the Bahamas in sugar and nutritive\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nThe average, maximum, and minimum of all samples of the fresh pine from\r\nall countries examined in the Bureau of Chemistry show the following\r\ncomposition:\r\n\r\n  --------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n          |  SOLIDS. |   SUGAR. | PROTEIN. |   ASH.   | ACIDITY.\r\n  --------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n          |_Percent._|_Percent._|_Percent._|_Percent._|_Percent._\r\n  Average,|  14.17   |  11.90   |    .42   |    .40   |   .60\r\n  Maximum,|  18.86   |  15.28   |    .57   |    .55   |   .85\r\n  Minimum,|  10.78   |   8.20   |    .21   |    .27   |   .30\r\n  --------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n\r\nIn order that some idea might be obtained of the composition of the\r\npines grown at Singapore and Nassau, the consuls in those localities\r\nwere requested to secure the preservation of the pines by sterilization\r\nwithout the addition of any substance, that is, their preservation in\r\ntheir natural juice. In this condition the fruit of the pine, naturally\r\npreserved, was sent to the Bureau of Chemistry and subjected to\r\nanalysis with the following average results:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Average Composition_ (ten samples from Singapore).--\r\n\r\n  Solids,   13.39 percent\r\n  Sugars,   11.73    „\r\n  Protein,    .48    „\r\n  Ash,        .38    „\r\n  Acidity,    .39    „\r\n\r\n\r\n_Average Composition_ (two samples from Nassau).--\r\n\r\n  Solids,   13.18 percent\r\n  Sugars,   10.86    „\r\n  Protein,    .40    „\r\n  Ash,        .41    „\r\n  Acidity,    .58    „\r\n\r\nThe above data show that the pineapples grown in Singapore and Nassau\r\nare not notably different in composition from those grown in Florida,\r\nCuba, and Jamaica. All the data indicate that the pineapples grown in\r\ndifferent parts of the world have practically the same composition at\r\nthe same state of maturity.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sapota= (=Sapodilla=) (_Sapota zapotilla_ (Jacq.) Coville).--This is\r\na tropical fruit which is grown in large quantities in Cuba, where two\r\nvarieties are known, differing only in shape, one being round and the\r\nother oval. In the Havana markets the latter variety is incorrectly\r\nknown as the nispero. This name, however, is properly applied to the\r\nfruit loquat (_Eriobotrya japonica_). The fruit is small, weighing\r\nusually under two ounces, has a brown or brownish-green color and\r\nin general appearance resembles a smooth, dark potato. The skin is\r\nthick and coarse in texture, the pulp is yellowish-brown in color,\r\ngranular in texture, and rich in juice. The odor is characteristic,\r\nand the taste is quite sweet. The seeds number from one to five and\r\nare contained in a soft open core,--they are of a brownish-black color\r\nwith a single white stripe. They measure from three-quarters to one\r\ninch in length. The fruit comes into use about the first of April and\r\nlasts until the end of summer. It is a very popular fruit in summer\r\nand deserves more attention in the various markets than it has yet\r\nreceived. The sap of the sapota tree and juice of the green fruit\r\nwhen concentrated furnish the material known as chicle, from which\r\nchewing-gum is made. The compositions of the round and long sapota and\r\nthe natural preserved pulp of the sapota are given in the following\r\ntable:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Edible Portion._--\r\n\r\n  -------------------------+--------+-----------------------------------\r\n                           |        |  COMPOSITION OF EDIBLE PORTION.\r\n                           |        +-------+------+------+------+------\r\n                           | EDIBLE |       | Total|      | Pro- |Total\r\n                           |PORTION.|Solids.| ash. |Acids.| tein.|sugar.\r\n  -------------------------+--------+-------+------+------+------+------\r\n                           |  _Per- | _Per- | _Per-|_Per- | _Per-| _Per-\r\n                           | cent._ |cent._ |cent._|cent._|cent._|cent._\r\n  Round sapota,            |  76.40 | 23.07 | 0.384| 0.132| 0.350| 10.85\r\n  Long sapota,             |  80.90 | 21.01 |  .555|  .162|  .650| 12.76\r\n  Natural sapota preserves,|  ....  | 22.95 |  .399|  .086|  .231| 11.30\r\n  -------------------------+--------+-------+------+------+------+------\r\n\r\nThe sapota is also used in the manufacture of preserves by boiling it\r\nwith sugar in the usual way. The analyses show that the sapota is a\r\nfruit which is principally valuable as a carbohydrate food. It has,\r\nhowever, very little acid, and is a much sweeter fruit than the anona\r\nand, therefore, more pleasant to the taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Star-apple= (=Cainito=) (_Chrysophyllum cainito_).--The star-apple is\r\none of the less important fruits which abound in Cuba. It is not very\r\nextensively used, but medicinal properties are attributed to it. Three\r\ndifferent varieties are sold in the Havana markets,--one of a white\r\ncolor and two purple. The first attains the size of a small apple,\r\napproaching about seven ounces in weight. There are two kinds of meat\r\nin the pulp; the outer portion is a white, gelatinous matter which\r\ncontains the small black seed and is really the edible portion, and\r\nconstitutes about one-third the weight of the fruit. The outer fibrous\r\nand purple portion of the flesh is inedible. The inner pulp has a sweet\r\ncharacteristic flavor and is eaten raw. No preserves were found made of\r\nthis in Cuban markets. The composition of the white star-apple is shown\r\nin the following table:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of Edible Portion--41.80 percent._--\r\n\r\n  Solids,   14.23 percent\r\n  Sugar,     7.91    „\r\n  Protein,    .67    „\r\n  Ash,        .35    „\r\n  Acidity,    .05    „\r\n\r\nThese data show that the fruit is not of a very high nutritive order,\r\nand on account of its low acidity it is not suitable for the making of\r\npreserves.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tamarind= (_Tamarindus Indica_).--This fruit belongs to the leguminous\r\nfamily and forms a dark brown pod from one to six inches in length\r\nand from three-fourths of an inch to one inch in width. The rind is\r\nthin and very brittle. Within the pod is found a dark-colored pasty\r\nmaterial, closely attached to the seed sacks and joined to the stem of\r\nthe pod by coarse fibers. This pasty material constitutes the edible\r\nportion of the fruit and has a very sour taste which serves to mask\r\nthe large amount of sugar, sometimes as much as 30 percent, which it\r\ncontains. The tamarind is remarkable as having the highest content both\r\nof acid and sugar of any of the edible fruits which are in common use.\r\nIt contains more acid, for instance, than the sourest lime and more\r\nsugar than the sweetest fruit. The tamarind is not very largely used\r\ndirectly for edible purposes but is a component of many refreshing\r\nsummer beverages and is used for flavoring other products. It has\r\nmild purgative properties, and hence its intermittent use in small\r\nquantities tends to keep in proper regulation the mechanical movements\r\nwhich are so necessary to normal digestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Tamarind._--\r\n\r\n  Water,    47.47 percent\r\n  Acid,      6.03    „\r\n  Sugar,    31.43    „\r\n  Protein,   1.36    „\r\n  Ash,       1.56    „\r\n\r\nThe above data show that the tamarind is essentially of a carbohydrate\r\nnature, its chief food value being in the sugar which it contains. On\r\naccount of its high acidity very little of the sugar which is present\r\nis in the form of sucrose or cane sugar, but is mostly in an invert\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preparation of Tamarinds._--Tamarinds are not only used directly\r\nbut most extensively in the form of tamarind paste which is made up\r\nchiefly by the addition of cane sugar to the pulp; as much as 75\r\npercent of sugar is often added to the making of paste. Another form\r\nof preparation is called tamarind pulp, which has practically the same\r\ncomposition as the paste. These two bodies may be called tamarind\r\npreserves. The proportion of pulp to added sugar is about as 20 to 80.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mineral Constituents of Tropical Fruits.=--The mineral content of\r\nthe edible portions of fruits is important, both from a dietetic and\r\nchemical point of view.\r\n\r\nThe mineral substances in fruits not only add to their palatability\r\nbut also have important functions in digestion and assimilation. The\r\nlime and phosphoric acid which the ash of fruits contain are foods\r\nthat nourish certain tissues of the body, such as the bones. The other\r\nmineral ingredients of fruits take an active part in the circulation of\r\nthe fluids of the body. Since the modern development of physiological\r\nchemistry, what is known as osmotic force, or the power that causes\r\nsolutions to pass through membranes, is believed to be due largely\r\nto the mineral constituents of the juices of the body. These mineral\r\nconstituents are therefore necessary in the food. The following table\r\ngives the total quantity of ash in the edible portion of the tropical\r\nfruits named, together with the composition of the ash in respect of\r\nits most important constituents (Bulletin 87, Bureau of Chemistry):\r\n\r\nANALYSES OF THE ASH OF THE EDIBLE PORTION OF THE SEVERAL FRUITS.\r\n\r\n  --------------------+------+-------+------+------+--------+\r\n                      |      |       |      |      |        |\r\n  DESCRIPTION         |TOTAL | SILICA|POTASH| LIME |MAGNESIA|\r\n  OF SAMPLE.          | ASH. |(SiO₂).|(K₂O).|(CaO).| (MgO). |\r\n  --------------------+------+-------+------+------+--------+\r\n                      | _Per-|  _Per-| _Per-| _Per-|  _Per- |\r\n                      |cent._| cent._|cent._|cent._| cent._ |\r\n  Orange (china),     | 0.52 |  1.01 | 40.66|10.26 |  5.27  |\r\n  Orange (rough skin),|  .55 |   ..  | 49.15| 2.62 |  1.41  |\r\n  Orange (sour),      |  .57 |   ..  | 45.09| 7.95 |  2.17  |\r\n  Grape fruit,        |  .39 |   ..  | 44.19| 7.34 |  3.92  |\r\n  Lime,               |  .98 |   ..  | 43.01| 7.84 |  2.36  |\r\n  Sweet lemon,        |  .98 |   ..  | 54.35| 4.29 |  1.08  |\r\n  Tamarind,           | 1.56 | 15.57 |   .. |  .68 |  2.19  |\r\n                      |      |  [34] |      |      |        |\r\n  Guava,              |  .84 |  1.13 | 55.00| 2.48 |  1.64  |\r\n  Banana (niño),      |  .70 |   ..  | 46.46|  .95 |   .42  |\r\n  Banana (oronoco),   | 1.08 |   ..  | 52.41| 1.02 |  1.90  |\r\n  Banana (colorado),  |  .83 |   ..  | 51.47|  .37 |   .65  |\r\n  Mango (French),     |  .53 |   ..  | 47.37| 6.38 |  1.62  |\r\n  Mango (Filipino),   |  .41 |  1.75 | 51.79| 1.74 |  3.25  |\r\n  Manga,              |  .78 |  2.14 | 49.37| 2.38 |   ..   |\r\n  Guanabana,          |  .86 |  1.48 | 48.93|  .44 |  2.17  |\r\n  Anona,              |  .80 |   .63 | 47.27|  .81 |  2.07  |\r\n  Chirimoya,          | 1.04 |   ..  | 49.73| 2.21 |   .66  |\r\n  Sapota,             |  .50 |   ..  | 43.13| 7.49 |  2.83  |\r\n  Mamey (colorado),   |  .80 |   ..  | 50.57| 1.38 |  1.36  |\r\n    Do.,              |  .89 |   ..  | 48.20| 1.73 |  3.35  |\r\n  Hicaco,             |  .91 |   ..  | 35.15| 5.84 |  4.51  |\r\n  Cainito,            |  .35 |   ..  | 54.75| 1.31 |   ..   |\r\n  Pineapple,          |  ..  |   ..  | 59.18| 9.44 |  5.52  |\r\n   Do.,               |  ..  |   ..  | 57.13| 4.80 |  3.44  |\r\n  --------------------+------+-------+------+------+--------+\r\n\r\n  --------------------+--------+----------+--------+-------\r\n                      | FERRIC |PHOSPHORIC|SULFURIC|\r\n  DESCRIPTION         |  OXID  |   ACID   |  ACID  |CHLORIN\r\n  OF SAMPLE.          |(Fe₂O₃).|  (P₂O₅). | (SO₃). | (Cl).\r\n  --------------------+--------+----------+--------+-------\r\n                      |  _Per- |   _Per-  |  _Per- |  _Per-\r\n                      | cent._ |  cent._  | cent._ | cent._\r\n  Orange (china),     |  1.09  |    8.56  |  2.84  |  2.44\r\n  Orange (rough skin),|  4.51  |    7.42  |  3.42  |  1.50\r\n  Orange (sour),      |  2.40  |    8.70  |  2.72  |   .98\r\n  Grape fruit,        |  1.28  |   11.09  |  3.39  |  1.38\r\n  Lime,               |   ..   |    8.45  |  2.62  |  4.07\r\n  Sweet lemon,        |   ..   |    9.83  |  4.09  |  1.32\r\n  Tamarind,           |   ..   |    4.99  |  1.40  |   .48\r\n                      |        |          |        |\r\n  Guava,              |   ..   |    8.29  |  3.58  |  5.33\r\n  Banana (niño),      |   ..   |   10.36  |  2.36  |  6.59\r\n  Banana (oronoco),   |   ..   |    5.16  |  3.32  |  8.48\r\n  Banana (colorado),  |   ..   |    3.25  |  2.77  |  7.63\r\n  Mango (French),     |   ..   |    6.49  |  3.67  |  3.88\r\n  Mango (Filipino),   |   ..   |    9.04  |  4.88  |  1.56\r\n  Manga,              |   ..   |    5.57  |  3.84  |  4.20\r\n  Guanabana,          |   ..   |    9.15  |  4.54  |  3.40\r\n  Anona,              |   ..   |   13.63  |  3.19  |  3.51\r\n  Chirimoya,          |   ..   |    6.57  |  4.49  |  7.40\r\n  Sapota,             |   ..   |    2.74  |  4.55  | 17.41\r\n  Mamey (colorado),   |   ..   |    4.90  |  3.54  | 17.34\r\n    Do.,              |   ..   |    9.66  |  3.80  | 16.00\r\n  Hicaco,             |   ..   |    3.09  |  4.77  | 18.62\r\n  Cainito,            |   ..   |   11.00  |  5.50  |  9.46\r\n  Pineapple,          |   ..   |    6.51  |  3.04  |  3.22\r\n   Do.,               |   ..   |    4.29  |  3.65  |  4.08\r\n  --------------------+--------+----------+--------+-------\r\n\r\n  [34] 2.88 percent sand.\r\n\r\nThe above data show that the percentage of ash in the edible portion\r\nof tropical fruits is never very high. In only three instances in\r\nthe above table does it exceed one percent and in two of those only\r\nslightly. The principal mineral constituent is potash, which in round\r\nnumbers may be said to constitute one-half of the total ash. Of the\r\nacid constituents phosphoric acid is the most important. In four cases\r\nthe amount of phosphoric acid is greater than 10 percent of the total\r\nweight of the ash. The proportion of sulfuric acid in the ash is quite\r\nconstant, while the amount of chlorin varies from less than one-half of\r\none percent to more than 18 percent.\r\n\r\nIn this case of high ash there is a low content of phosphoric acid,\r\nwhich leads to the supposition that the chlorin is partially or wholly\r\ncombined with sodium and potassium. In addition to the elements\r\nmentioned above the ash of edible fruits often contains notable\r\nquantities of silica and sometimes considerable quantities of sand,\r\nadded accidentally or by the collection of dust. The ash of fruit also\r\nquite universally contains iron. In some cases the quantity of iron\r\namounts to as much as four percent of the total weight of the ash. The\r\ndata in the above table are calculated on the percentage of total ash\r\nand not on the percentage of pure ash, that is, ash deprived of its\r\ncarbon, sand, and carbonic acid.\r\n\r\nThere are some peculiarities in the composition of the ash of tropical\r\nfruits to which attention may be called. The citrus fruits contain\r\nsomewhat larger amounts of lime and iron than ordinary fruits. The\r\nash of the tamarind contains large quantities of silica. The ash of\r\nthe banana has a low content of lime and magnesia and a high content\r\nof chlorin. Attention is also called to the fact that in the ordinary\r\ncombustion of an organic substance to secure the mineral matter notable\r\nquantities of the phosphoric acid and chlorin contained may be lost.\r\nTherefore, the data for phosphoric acid and for chlorin are probably\r\nlower than would be the case if all of these substances present in\r\nthe fruit had been secured in the ash. The ash of pineapples is not\r\npeculiar in any respect, nor does it contain any marked amount of a\r\nconstituent by which it can be identified. The pineapple, as is seen,\r\ncontains slightly more potash than the other tropical fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGAR AND ACID IN FRUIT.\r\n\r\nThe palatable quality of fruit depends largely upon the aromatic\r\nsubstances which they contain in the form of essential oils, esters,\r\nand ethers, and especially upon their sugar and acid content. The\r\nsweet taste of sugar in fruits and also often in nuts is modified and\r\nrelieved by the acid or astringent materials, chiefly tannin, with\r\nwhich it is associated. In the analyses indicating the composition of\r\nfruits and of nuts and also of vegetables the sugar has not always been\r\ngiven separately, but as one member of a group consisting of sugar,\r\nstarch, and cellulose materials soluble in weak acid and alkalies,\r\nand for this reason deemed to be digestible. It seems advisable to\r\nsupplement this information with a special table giving the average\r\nquantity of sugar and acid found in some of the principal fruits. It\r\nmust not be forgotten that in individual cases the quantity of sugar\r\nand acid may vary largely from the average, but the following data may\r\nbe regarded as expressing very accurately the average content of sugar\r\nand acid in the common fruits.\r\n\r\n                                   SUGAR.

Practically,\r\nnevertheless, every fruit which has been produced in this country has\r\nbecome a commercial article in the form of canned goods. With the\r\nexception of the method of preparation, the process of canning and\r\nother treatments are essentially the same as that of vegetables and\r\ntherefore does not warrant any further description.\r\n\r\nIn the following data are found a brief description and the composition\r\nof the leading varieties of canned fruit:\r\n\r\n\r\n=Canned Cherries.=--Cherries are one of the fruits which are valued for\r\ncanning purposes. The pits may or may not be removed, according to the\r\ndesire of the manufacturer and the demand of the consumer. The galvanic\r\naction which the cherry juice sets up on the tin plate tends to bleach\r\nthe natural color of the cherry, and this action can be avoided by\r\ncoating the interior of the can with a gum or some similar substance\r\nwhich entirely protects the metallic surface from contact with the\r\njuice of the fruit. When treated in this way the natural color of the\r\ncherry is preserved for a reasonable length of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Canned Cherries._--The only adulteration of canned\r\ncherries which is of any consequence is that which relates to\r\nartificial coloring. By reason of the tendency to bleach the color,\r\nmentioned above, it has been quite customary to add an artificial color\r\nto the cherry so that the red color may be preserved. Coal tar dyes,\r\nunder various names, and an animal dye, cochineal, have been used for\r\nthis purpose. The practice of artificial coloring is reprehensible and\r\nmay, in the case of some colors, be harmful to health. By observing the\r\nprecautions already mentioned, the natural color of the cherry may be\r\npreserved without artificial color, and in general this is desirable.\r\nThe consumer should at all times demand canned cherries which have not\r\nbeen artificially colored.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Maraschino Cherries._--A very common method of treating cherries is to\r\nbleach them in a brine of common salt and sulfurous acid until all the\r\nnatural color has disappeared. The cherries are then thoroughly washed\r\nfor the removal of the salt and sulfurous acid and at the same time the\r\njuice and soluble portions of the cherry are removed, so that at the\r\nend of the washing there is little left but the cellular structure. The\r\ncherries are then saturated with sugar or sugar and glucose and colored\r\na deep artificial red by coal tar dye or cochineal. If the natural\r\nflavor of cherries has been destroyed by the bleaching an artificial\r\nflavor is often added. The product is a cherry of an even deep red\r\ntint, more or less sweet, according to the use of greater or less\r\nquantities of sugar or glucose, and having a flavor of almond oil. When\r\ncherries of this kind are preserved in a solution of alcohol, flavored\r\nor unflavored, they are called maraschino cherries. The name is taken\r\nfrom a kind of cherry first used in making the product. They are used\r\nto a very large extent with certain beverages such as cocktails, soda\r\nwater, mint juleps, etc., and also in ice cream and other preparations\r\nfor the table. Little can be said in praise either of the taste or\r\nwholesomeness of these preparations and they are valuable chiefly for\r\ntheir supposed attractive appearance. The offense which is committed\r\nagainst the æsthetic taste of the individual in the preparation of\r\nsuch a product probably offsets any good effect which comes from\r\nattractiveness or ornamentation. The product cannot be regarded in any\r\nsense as resembling even in color the natural fruit, since practically\r\nthe whole of the natural fruit, except its cellular structure, has been\r\nwithdrawn and artificial substances substituted in place thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Canned Peaches.=--A great industry in this country is the canning of\r\npeaches. Some of the finest and most perfect varieties are used for\r\nthis purpose. Peaches may be canned whole or by slicing in half or\r\nquarters and removing the pit. The principles of sterilization are not\r\ndifferent from those which have already been described. Since the peach\r\nis a fruit which decays easily and is thus difficult of transportation,\r\nthe establishment of canning factories in the vicinity of large peach\r\norchards renders it possible to preserve this delicate fruit in a\r\ncondition practically as good as that of the natural article, and thus\r\nmakes it accessible to the people in all parts of the country at all\r\nseasons of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Canned Peaches._--Fortunately in this case there\r\nis no record of adulterations which is of any consequence. The\r\nperfection of the method of sterilization has rendered it unnecessary\r\nto make further use of antiseptics for canned peaches. The use of\r\nthe artificial sweetening agent, saccharin, is almost unknown and is\r\nabout the only adulteration which at the present time can be practiced\r\nwithout easy detection. It may be confidently stated that the consumer\r\ncan rely, with a fair degree of assurance, upon the purity of the\r\nproduct which is taken from the can. The only real danger is in the\r\naction of the fruit juice upon the imperfect tin plate, and this is a\r\ndanger which probably will soon pass away, since there is a tendency\r\nmanifested now to so protect the tin by a varnish of some kind as\r\nto render it impossible for any electric action to take place which\r\nimpairs the color or flavor of the fruit and also to exclude the\r\npoisonous salts of tin and lead from the contents of the can.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Adulteration of Canned Fruit.=--_Artificial coloring:_ The principal\r\nadulteration of canned fruit is that due to artificial coloring.\r\nThere is, perhaps, no other form of adulteration which has so little\r\nexcuse. It only needs a cursory observation of the fruits of Nature\r\nto show that even in the same varieties they differ to a vast degree\r\nin natural tint. Bright colors are especially prized in fruits. For\r\ninstance, the yellow of the peach, the red of the cherry, the purple of\r\nthe plum, etc. The object of artificial coloring is to make all kinds\r\nand varieties of these fruits imitate those of naturally rich color.\r\nIts sole purpose is deception, since it can add nothing whatever to\r\nthe nutritive value. The claim that it adds to the dietetic value of\r\nthe fruit, as in other cases of the same kind of argument, is plainly\r\nfallacious. The very moment the consumer realizes he is eating an\r\nartificially tinted fruit, if his temperament be as artistic as should\r\nalways be the case, he becomes sensitive to the effort made to deceive\r\nhim. Such artificially colored foods, thus, instead of tasting better\r\nthan they otherwise would, have a worse taste due to the feeling of\r\nantipathy excited by their presence. Hence there can be no excuse,\r\nunder any circumstances, for the addition of artificial colors to food\r\nproducts of this kind, or in fact, of any kind except those which are\r\npurely synthetic and have no relation in composition or in quality to\r\na natural product. With the exception of cherries and berries, the\r\naddition of artificial color to canned fruits is not common.\r\n\r\nAnother form of adulteration, which fortunately is seldom practiced in\r\nfruit, is one which has already been described in sufficient detail,\r\nthat is, the addition of saccharin, a substance which has even less\r\nplace in fruits than in vegetables. The addition of a non-sugar, such\r\nas saccharin, with an intensely sweet taste for the purpose of inducing\r\nthe consumer to believe that the article is a natural sweet product,\r\nis an adulteration of the most reprehensible type, to say nothing of\r\nthe evil effects of the adulterant employed upon health. The addition\r\nof spices and other condimental substances to fruit products cannot\r\nbe regarded as an adulteration, because they reveal their own presence\r\nand are not added for the purpose of imitation or deception. As has\r\nbeen mentioned above, the manufacturer would save all criticism in\r\nsuch cases by a plain statement upon the label of the nature of the\r\nsubstance added.\r\n\r\nCanned fruits properly preserved retain their natural aroma and\r\nflavor better than any other form of canned food and deserve the high\r\nestimation in which they are held by the consumer. The time is now\r\nrapidly approaching when all such goods will be free of any imitation\r\nor adulteration, and this will add greatly to their value in the\r\nmarkets of the country. The consumer will then only need to have the\r\ndate of preservation marked on the can to be fully protected.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUIT SIRUPS.\r\n\r\nThe expressed juice of fruits mixed with the proper proportion of\r\nsugar produces an important article of commerce known as fruit sirup.\r\nThese fruit sirups are used principally in the preparation of cooling,\r\nnon-alcoholic beverages such as are drunk at the “soda fountains”\r\nso-called in the United States. In the preparation of fruit sirups\r\nonly the choicest and best fruits are to be used. The juice, after\r\nexpression, is properly freed from suspended matter by filtration or\r\nsedimentation and is brought to a proper consistence by mixing at\r\nonce with pure sugar. When it is used as soon as prepared no further\r\npreparation in regard to its preservation is necessary, since juice\r\nprepared in this way and kept in an ice-box will keep several days\r\nwithout fermenting. When prepared on a large scale for commercial\r\npurposes it becomes necessary to prepare these sirups in some more\r\npermanent form. To this end they are subjected to the usual process of\r\npasteurization. On account of their liquid condition, sterilization,\r\nthat is, the use of a temperature of boiling water, is rarely\r\nnecessary. If, on pasteurization, a precipitate is formed in these\r\nsirups, they should be heated to the temperature of pasteurization\r\nprevious to the final processing and any deposited matter be separated\r\nby filtration or deposit. The sirup thus clarified is placed in\r\nbottles or separate containers and subjected to the pasteurizing\r\nprocess for a sufficient length of time, and is then ready for the\r\nmarket. These pasteurized sirups, if stored in a cool place, will keep\r\nalmost indefinitely. In all cases where pasteurization is practiced\r\nat a very low temperature it is necessary to keep the product at a\r\nlow temperature, since, as is well known, pasteurization does not\r\nkill all the spores, but does act with deadly effect upon the yeasts\r\nwhich produce alcoholic fermentation. Fresh sirups thus prepared and\r\npasteurized are wholesome and palatable and are unobjectionable.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Composition of Fruit Sirup.=--Naturally the principal constituent\r\nof fruit sirup is the added sugar. The other constituents correspond\r\nto those of the juice from which the sirup is made. As one of the\r\nprincipal constituents of fruit juice is sugar, it is seen that the\r\nnatural sugar plus the addition makes up practically the total solid\r\ncomponents in articles of this kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Adulteration of Fruit Sirup.=--Fruit sirups have been extensively and\r\nunnecessarily adulterated. The principal adulteration is the omission\r\nof the pasteurization process and the preserving of the fruit juice\r\nby means of an antiseptic. The two antiseptics which have been most\r\ncommonly employed for this purpose are salicylic and benzoic acids. At\r\nthe present time, by reason of prohibitive legislation in respect of\r\nsalicylic acid, benzoic acid or its compounds are quite universally\r\nemployed. These antiseptics are injurious to health and even in small\r\nquantities cannot fail to have some deleterious effect upon the system.\r\nAs they are not necessary in the preservation of fruit sirups, they\r\nshould be rigidly excluded therefrom. In justice to those who use\r\nantiseptics of this kind it is said that, as a rule, they frankly admit\r\nthat these sirups can be preserved by sterilization, but that when\r\nconsumed they are used only in small quantities, and when the air has\r\naccess to the remaining portion fermentation is set up. To this the\r\nanswer may be made that if unstoppered and used under proper conditions\r\nto avoid the admission of germs, and if kept on ice or in a cool place,\r\nfermentation will not set up for several days, during which time\r\nopportunity will be had for disposing of the contents of the bottle.\r\nIt does not appear that there is any convincing reason to warrant the\r\ncontinuance of the use of preservatives in this kind of products.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Imitation Fruit Sirups.=--By far the most general adulteration of\r\nfruit sirups is that of the imitations thereof, pure and simple, by\r\nsynthetic products. The flavors which give to fruits their character\r\nand aroma are chemical compounds produced by Nature and are chiefly of\r\nthe nature of a volatile oil or compound ether. Of these flavors, the\r\ncompound ethers especially are readily produced by purely synthetic\r\nprocesses. It is possible, therefore, for the chemist to make an\r\napproximate imitation of the natural fruit flavor. No difference\r\nhow great his skill, however, or the skill of the mixer, there is\r\nalways a gustatory and hygienic difference between the synthetic\r\nand the natural product, and the natural product always has the\r\nadvantage of the difference. While I do not go so far as to say that\r\nsynthetic flavors or sirups should be excluded in the preparation of\r\nnon-alcoholic beverages, I do say with emphasis that they should never\r\nbe used, except with notification to the consumer, and never, under any\r\ncircumstance, if they contain any ingredient which is prejudicial to\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal arguments which has been made against the\r\nenactment of the pure food bill has been that it would exclude from the\r\nmarket these synthetic products. At least let them be sold under their\r\nproper designations. A law which requires plain and honest branding can\r\nhardly be objected to on any ground whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMS, JELLIES, AND PRESERVES.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of various fruits or fruit juices with sugar is an\r\nimportant industry both for domestic purposes and for commerce in the\r\nUnited States. When the fleshy portion of the fruit is treated with\r\nsugar sirup and boiled, it produces the product known as preserves.\r\nWhen a fruit is reduced to a pulp and treated with sugar sirup and\r\nboiled, it makes a product known as jam. When the fruit juice itself\r\nis treated with sugar and boiled, it forms a product known as jelly.\r\nThe above are general definitions of three important classes of fruit\r\nproducts, though it is not intended by any means in the definitions\r\nto describe the details of preparation. These vary greatly in respect\r\nof the method of preparation, the fruit, the quantity of sugar used,\r\nthe length of time the boiling is continued, and the consistency of\r\nthe final product. These definitions merely outline the three distinct\r\nclasses of products which are made from fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Selection of the Fruit.=--In the selection of the fruit for making\r\nthese sweet products it is highly important that only the very best\r\nquality should be used. The fruit should be of a proper degree of\r\nmaturity, and yet not overripe. The practice of using immature, waste,\r\nor partially deformed or decayed fruit for the purposes named cannot be\r\ntoo strongly condemned. The great advantage of preparing these products\r\nat the home consists in the fact that the character of the material\r\nused is under the immediate supervision of the housewife. In large\r\nfactories where no official inspection is exercised it is possible that\r\nany kind of fruit or any portion of the fruit may be devoted to the\r\npurpose. All deteriorated raw material should be rigidly excluded from\r\nthe factory. Various fruits are utilized in different manners in the\r\npreparation of the above-named products. Large fruits with tough skins,\r\nsuch as apples, peaches, and pears, are pared, the cores removed, and\r\nall decayed or infected portions cut away, and the clean, fresh, fleshy\r\nportion of the fruit used for manufacturing purposes. Small fruits,\r\nsuch as berries, after the exclusion of all dirt, immature or imperfect\r\nsamples, and the removal of the stem, are used in the whole state for\r\nthe purposes named.\r\n\r\nIt would be manifestly impracticable, as a rule, to remove even the\r\nseeds of small fruits, except where jelly is to be manufactured. The\r\nfruits, having been properly prepared, are mixed with sugar or thick\r\nsugar sirup and subjected to heat for two purposes. The first purpose\r\nof heat is to sterilize completely the material so that no bacteria,\r\ngerms, or spores may be left alive in the finished product. The\r\nsecond purpose of heating is to concentrate the material to a proper\r\nconsistence and to thoroughly saturate all portions with sugar sirup.\r\nIncidentally, the heating also by the combined action of temperature\r\nand free acids in the fruit inverts a large quantity of the cane sugar\r\nthat is used and thus prevents the finished product from granulating.\r\nThe crystallization of the sugar in these bodies renders them very\r\nmuch less desirable and suitable for consumption. For this reason,\r\namong others, the precaution above mentioned, namely, that the fruit\r\nshould not be overripe, should be observed. It has been seen that\r\noverripe fruit diminishes in acidity, and hence it is less suitable for\r\nconverting the cane sugar than fruit just short of complete maturity.\r\nFor this reason, too, the more strongly acid fruits are better suited\r\nfor making these sweetened products than those in which the acidity is\r\nless strongly developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Jams.=--As has already been said, jams differ from jellies in that\r\nthey contain not only the juice of the fruit but the whole pulp of the\r\nfruit or the whole fruit. The methods of preparation in effect produce\r\nthe same changes upon the sugars that are produced by the fruit juice.\r\nThe fruit after proper comminution is boiled with large quantities of\r\nsugar a sufficient length of time to reduce the fruit flesh to a pulp\r\nand to invert more or less of the sugar which is used. The insoluble\r\nmatter which jam contains consists chiefly of the cellulose and pectose\r\nmatter in the fruit, together with the seeds of the small fruit. The\r\nvarious solids are made up of the solid bodies in the fruits, including\r\nthe sugars which are added. The character of the ash of the jams is\r\na good indication whether or not they are pure, that is, made out of\r\nsugar and fruit only. While it is true that the ash of fruit varies, it\r\nis also true that the real ash of fruit has certain characteristics in\r\nregard to alkalinity which are not possessed by the ash of adulterated\r\nfruit products. For the sake of convenience and reference it is seen\r\nadvisable to append a table showing the composition of the ash of some\r\nof the fresh fruits (Bulletin 66, Bureau of Chemistry).\r\n\r\n  ---------+------+-------+------+------+------+------+--------\r\n           |      |       |      |      | P₂O₅.| SO₃. |\r\n           |      |       |      |      | PHOS-| SUL- |\r\n           | PURE |  K₂O. | Na₂O.| CaO. |PHORIC| FURIC|  Cl.\r\n  FRUIT.   | ASH. |POTASH.| SODA.| LIME.| ACID.| ACID.|CHLORIN.\r\n  ---------+------+-------+------+------+------+------+--------\r\n           | _Per-|  _Per-| _Per-| _Per-| _Per-| _Per-| _Per-\r\n           |cent._| cent._|cent._|cent._|cent._|cent._|cent._\r\n  Apple,   | 0.264| 55.21 | 11.69|  4.79| 12.83| 4.62 |  0.83\r\n  Apricots,|  .508| 59.36 | 10.26|  3.17| 13.09| 2.63 |   .45\r\n  Banana,  | 1.078| 63.06 |  2.34|   .86|  1.62| 2.32 | 26.93\r\n  Cherries,| 0.440| 57.67 |  6.80|  4.20| 15.11| 5.83 |  1.83\r\n  Figs,    |  .682| 57.16 |  2.38| 10.90| 12.76| 3.90 |  2.05\r\n  Grapes,  |  .500| 50.95 |  6.32|  4.96| 21.27| 4.28 |  1.54\r\n  Lemons,  |  .526| 48.26 |  1.76| 24.87| 11.09| 2.84 |   .39\r\n  Oranges, |  .432| 48.94 |  2.50| 22.71| 12.37| 5.25 |   .92\r\n  Prunes,  |  .486| 63.83 |  2.65|  4.66| 14.08| 2.68 |   .34\r\n  ---------+------+-------+------+------+------+------+--------\r\n\r\nFrom the above table it is seen that there is not a very large\r\npercentage of sulfuric acid in the natural ash in fruits, and very\r\nlittle chlorin, with the exception of the banana, in which the ash\r\nis principally potassium chlorid. Since the ash of glucose, as it is\r\nmade at the present time, consists almost entirely of sulfates and\r\nchlorids, any considerable increase of these ingredients of an ash over\r\nthe normal may be regarded as an indication that the fruit product\r\nfrom which the ash is obtained contains added glucose. Inasmuch as\r\nthere are chemical and physical methods of detecting glucose which\r\nare entirely reliable, the utility of the composition of ash for this\r\npurpose is rather confirmatory than otherwise. Since the added sugar\r\nis the chief constituent of jams there is little difference in other\r\nrespects in the composition of jams made from different fruits, as will\r\nbe seen by the table of analysis given below:\r\n\r\n  ------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n              |   TOTAL  |          | REDUCING |   CANE   |  TOTAL\r\n  DESCRIPTION.|  SOLIDS. | ACIDITY. | SUGAR.   |  SUGAR.  |  SUGAR.\r\n  ------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n    _Jams._   |_Percent._|_Percent._|_Percent._|_Percent._|_Percent._\r\n  Apple,      |  63.22   |   0.282  |   25.52  |   29.11  |  54.63\r\n  Blackberry, |  55.42   |    .851  |   18.77  |   29.00  |  47.77\r\n  Grape,      |  56.64   |    .744  |   33.44  |   11.33  |  44.77\r\n  Orange,     |  80.52   |    .433  |   13.61  |   54.23  |  67.84\r\n  Pear,       |  61.52   |    .163  |   13.20  |   33.74  |  46.94\r\n  Peach,      |  65.65   |    .500  |   36.48  |   23.16  |  59.64\r\n  Pineapple,  |  73.92   |    .314  |   14.05  |   46.40  |  60.45\r\n  Plum,       |  50.43   |   1.012  |   28.29  |    9.70  |  37.99\r\n  ------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of fruit which give the special flavors to the jams\r\nare imparted by constituents such as ethers, essential oils, and other\r\naromatic substances, together with the free acids which are present\r\nin such quantities as not to be susceptible of easy quantitative\r\ndetermination by chemical means. The relation which exists between the\r\ncane sugar and the invert sugar is not a safe index of the method of\r\npreparation, but is rather an indication of the excess or deficiency\r\nof the acid in the fruit employed.

--------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n\r\nThe analytical data show that the jams, in so far as active food\r\nconstituents are concerned, are composed chiefly of sugar. These sugars\r\ninclude both that natural to the fruit and that which has been added.\r\nThe average content of sugar in round numbers is 58.5 percent, while in\r\nround numbers the average content of solids, not sugar, is 7.5 percent.\r\nIt is thus seen that the amount of sugar present in round numbers is\r\neight times as great as that of the other solids. It is also noticed\r\nthat the percentage of reducing sugar is about one-third greater than\r\nthe cane sugar, indicating that the inversion of the sugar, when the\r\nreal fruits have been used in the manufacture, has been carried to such\r\nan extent as to avoid any danger of crystallization. These data are all\r\nin complete refutation of the claims made by many manufacturers that\r\nit is necessary to add glucose in the manufacture of complex products\r\nof this kind in order to prevent crystallization. If the real fruit is\r\nused in the proper quantity and the manufacture conducted according to\r\nthe approved method, there is no danger of crystallization except in\r\nthose rare cases where the fruits used have little or no acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Jams._--The adulterations of jams are practically\r\nthe same as those which are practiced with jellies. Artificial colors\r\nhave been very extensively used together with the artificial flavors\r\nresembling the fruits, the names of which appear erroneously upon the\r\npackages. Glucose is used to a large extent in these adulterated goods.\r\nIn the adulterated articles a preservative is nearly always present.\r\nStarch is used but very rarely for adulterating articles of this kind.\r\n\r\nFifty-eight samples of jams which proved to be adulterated were bought\r\non the open market by the Bureau of Chemistry, none of which bore any\r\nlabel or description indicating that it was an adulterated article.\r\nThe character of the principal adulterant (glucose) in each case\r\nis revealed at once by the polarization, which is always strongly\r\nright-handed, and also by other chemical tests for glucose. The\r\nquantity of sulfate and chlorid in the ash of these samples is always\r\nvery considerably increased over that of the natural product. The\r\nquantity of glucose in some of the samples is so great as to indicate\r\nthat practically the whole of the solid matter is composed of this\r\nsubstance. In two samples the alleged jam contained no fruit product\r\nwhatever. In many cases more than 70 percent of glucose is found and\r\nin one instance as high as 76 percent. In a great majority of the\r\ncases the glucose is approximately one-half of the whole weight of\r\nthe jam. In a great many cases the glucose was present in quantities\r\nwhich indicated the utilization of some fruit product. There were a few\r\ncases where the amount of glucose fell below 10 percent. Artificial\r\ncoloring matter was present in almost every case, and in the great\r\nmajority of cases either benzoic acid or salicylic acid is present as a\r\npreservative. The colors used are coal tar dyes and cochineal.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that articles of food adulterated in this manner should\r\nnot be permitted to bear the name of the natural product, and in many\r\nof the states the local laws forbid the use of a misleading name.\r\nThe national law, which was approved on the 30th of June, 1906, also\r\nforbids misbranding of this description.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the jams which on their labels bore no indication of\r\nthe adulterations, a number of samples of jam were purchased labeled\r\n“Compound,” or in some way indicating that they were not the pure\r\narticle. Thirteen samples of this kind were examined in the Bureau of\r\nChemistry and all of them had very large quantities of glucose, the\r\nlargest amount present in any one case being 37 percent. They were all\r\nartificially colored, and ten of them contained preservatives, either\r\nbenzoic or salicylic acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Jellies.=--In addition to the jellies which were made in the\r\nlaboratory of the Bureau of Chemistry for the purpose of controlling\r\nthe manufacture, 44 samples of jelly were bought upon the open market.\r\nOf these commercial samples 19 contained no glucose, 13 of them\r\ncontained glucose, but were not so labeled, and 12 were labeled as\r\ncompound or adulterated articles. Nearly all of the commercial jellies\r\nwere made with apple jelly as the base. The apple jelly and glucose\r\nmade up practically the total solids, no matter what name was applied.\r\nThe flavors were artificial, and a very large number of the samples\r\ncontained preservatives. The samples of jelly which contained no\r\nglucose were evidently made of the natural fruit,--they contained no\r\nartificial coloring matter and in only a few instances did they contain\r\npreservatives. On the other hand the jellies which were made of glucose\r\nwere uniformly colored and contained preservatives.\r\n\r\nIt is of interest here to say a few words about the very cheapest of\r\nadulterated jellies which are found upon the market. These jellies were\r\nmade with some apple juice, but chiefly of glucose. They contained\r\nlarge quantities of preservatives, and the ash was rich in sulfates and\r\nchlorids except in two instances. In these cases it is possible that\r\nthe glucose which was used was manufactured by some special process not\r\ninvolving the use of either sulfuric or hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Adulteration of Jelly.=--Jellies are of the class of fruit products\r\nwhich have been extensively adulterated. The markets of the country\r\nhave been flooded for years with so-called “compound jellies” or\r\nimitations of jelly. The chief forms of adulteration are the following:\r\nThe use of apple stock for making all kinds of jelly. Attention has\r\nalready been called to the fact that apples contain a large number\r\nof pectose bodies which favor jellification. A common method of\r\nmanufacturing jelly has been to use a stock of apple juice or cider\r\nor a preparation made from the cores, skins, and rejected portions\r\nof the apple at evaporating factories or from whole rejected apples.\r\nThis stock is used as a common base for the manufacture of jellies\r\nof different kinds. Whenever apple juice enters into the composition\r\nof a jelly made from any other fruit than the apple it becomes an\r\nadulteration. Apple juice is not an adulteration in the sense of being\r\nan injury to health, but in the sense of being substituted for other\r\nfruit juices.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Artificial Coloring.=--In as much as each kind of fruit tends to give\r\nto a jelly a particular color, it is evident that if apple stock is\r\nused the natural colors of the other fruits must be imitated.\r\n\r\nTo this end coal tar dyes have been generally employed, and sometimes\r\nvegetable or animal coloring matter to imitate the color of the fruit\r\nwhose name is given to the product.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Artificial Flavors.=--Since when apple stock is used as a base of\r\nmanufacture it imparts to the finished product only the flavor of\r\napples, artificial chemical flavors resembling other fruits are\r\nemployed. Thus the jellies which, presumably, are made from other\r\nfruits, have the particular flavor of those fruits imitated in a wholly\r\nartificial way.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Composition of Jelly.=--The properties of a jelly, in respect of its\r\ndistinct character, are due solely to the fruit from which it is made.\r\nEach one of the fruits contains essential oils, ethereal substances,\r\nacids, etc., which give to it a distinct character. These bodies are\r\ncarried with the fruit juice into the finished product and give to\r\nit its distinct characteristics. The sugar, of course, in all these\r\nproducts is the same. In the following table are found the data showing\r\nthe composition of jellies made from different fruits in the Bureau of\r\nChemistry.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF JELLY.\r\n\r\n  -----+----------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n       |                |        |        |  TOTAL |        |\r\n       |                |        |        |  ACIDS |        +\r\n   SE- |                |        |        |   EX-  |        |\r\n   RIAL|                |        |        | PRESSED|PROTEIDS|\r\n   NUM-|  DESCRIPTION   |  TOTAL |        |   AS   |  (N ×  |\r\n   BER.|   OF SAMPLE.   | SOLIDS.|  ASH.  | H₂SO₄. | 6.25). |\r\n  -----+----------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n       |                |_P. ct._|_P. ct._|_P. ct._|_P. ct._|\r\n  20408|Apple (fall     |        |        |        |        |\r\n       |pippin)         |  59.18 |  0.22  |  0.279 |  0.175 |\r\n  20405|Blackberry      |  59.63 |   .33  |   .475 |   .243 |\r\n  20410|Crab apple      |  63.28 |   .11  |   .171 |   .137 |\r\n  20405|Grape (Ives     |        |        |        |        |\r\n       |seedling)       |  63.66 |   .45  |   .524 |   .175 |\r\n  20412|Huckleberry     |  63.02 |   .28  |   .245 |   .069 |\r\n  20435|Orange (Florida |        |        |        |        |\r\n       |navel)          |  68.56 |   .30  |   .171 |   .418 |\r\n  20437|Peach           |  69.98 |   .21  |   .245 |   .175 |\r\n  20434|Pear (Bartlett) |  69.12 |   .34  |   .181 |   .156 |\r\n  20436|Pineapple       |  80.28 |   .43  |   .328 |   .387 |\r\n  20433|Pineapple husk  |  76.34 |   .73  |   .352 |   .350 |\r\n  20404|Plum (damson)   |  45.56 |   .68  |  1.127 |   .350 |\r\n  20409|Plum (wild fox) |  54.49 |   .40  |  1.029 |   .138 |\r\n  20411|Plum (wild fox),|        |        |        |        |\r\n       |boiled down     |  73.01 |   .65  |  1.529 |   .175 |\r\n  20407|Mixed fruit     |  66.58 |   .21  |   .367 |   .069 |\r\n  -----+----------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n\r\n  -----+----------------+-----------------------------------+\r\n       |                |              SUGARS.              |\r\n       |                +--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n   SE- |                |        |        |        |  Cane  |\r\n   RIAL|                |        |  Cane  |  Cane  |  sugar |\r\n   NUM-|  DESCRIPTION   |Reducing| sugar  | sugar  |   in-  |\r\n   BER.|   OF SAMPLE.   | Sugars.| added. | found. | verted.|\r\n  -----+----------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n       |                |_P. ct._|_P. ct._|_P. ct._|_P. ct._|\r\n  20408|Apple (fall     |        |        |        |        |\r\n       |pippin)         |  20.78 |  51.76 |  33.04 |  36.17 |\r\n  20405|Blackberry      |  12.51 |  54.89 |  44.90 |  18.20 |\r\n  20410|Crab apple      |  34.93 |  57.61 |  23.68 |  58.88 |\r\n  20405|Grape (Ives     |        |        |        |        |\r\n       |seedling)       |  32.29 |  60.29 |  30.52 |  49.33 |\r\n  20412|Huckleberry     |  24.27 |  53.39 |  32.74 |  37.54 |\r\n  20435|Orange (Florida |        |        |        |        |\r\n       |navel)          |   3.95 |  65.59 |  62.52 |   4.91 |\r\n  20437|Peach           |   8.75 |  63.70 |  56.59 |  11.16 |\r\n  20434|Pear (Bartlett) |   6.58 |  63.09 |  58.46 |   7.33 |\r\n  20436|Pineapple       |  22.13 |  72.98 |  56.70 |  28.45 |\r\n  20433|Pineapple husk  |   7.40 |  70.22 |  65.22 |   7.12 |\r\n  20404|Plum (damson)   |  19.18 |  38.00 |  22.67 |  40.38 |\r\n  20409|Plum (wild fox) |  24.00 |  48.05 |  25.48 |  46.97 |\r\n  20411|Plum (wild fox),|        |        |        |        |\r\n       |boiled down     |  44.22 |  64.66 |  22.37 |  66.18 |\r\n  20407|Mixed fruit     |  39.70 |  59.72 |  24.22 |  40.38 |\r\n  -----+----------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n\r\n  -----+----------------+--------------------\r\n       |                |   POLARIZATIONS.\r\n       |                +------+------+------\r\n   SE- |                |      |      |\r\n   RIAL|                |Direct|Invert|Invert\r\n   NUM-|  DESCRIPTION   |  at  |  at  |  at\r\n   BER.|   OF SAMPLE.   |18° C.|18° C.|86° C.\r\n  -----+----------------+------+------+------\r\n       |                | _°V._| _°V._| _°V._\r\n  20408|Apple (fall     |      |      |\r\n       |pippin)         | +24.0| -20.6| -1.2\r\n  20405|Blackberry      | +47.0| -20.1|  0\r\n  20410|Crab apple      | +13.0| -19.0|  0\r\n  20405|Grape (Ives     |      |      |\r\n       |seedling)       | +22.3| -18.9| + .2\r\n  20412|Huckleberry     | +24.1| -20.1| -

The data show that the quantity\r\nof cane sugar inverted varies greatly with the different fruits. Some\r\nof the fruit juices appear to have little or no effect whatever in the\r\ninversion of sugar. This is particularly true of the orange, the pear,\r\nand the jelly made from the husks of pineapples.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Manufacture of Jellies.=--In the manufacture of jellies the fruit\r\njuices are separated from the pulpy mass of the fruit, and these alone\r\nare used in the process. The most common method of procedure is to boil\r\nthe fruit with more or less water until the juices are more or less\r\nseparated and then to remove them by straining or pressure. The fruits\r\nare heated for this purpose with sufficient water to prevent scorching\r\nuntil they are thoroughly softened and then reduced to a pulp. The best\r\njellies are made from juices which are obtained by simply allowing the\r\npulpy mass to drain through cloth. The juices thus obtained are clear\r\nand free of any suspended matter. When pressure is used the juices are\r\nless clear and contain more or less suspended solid matter. In the\r\npreparation of jellies approximately equal portions of pure cane sugar\r\nand the strained juices are used, and the mixture is heated to the\r\nboiling point. It is evident that in the manufacture of jelly where\r\nboiling is not continued for any length of time the amount of sugar\r\ninverted is less than in the manufacture of jams and preserves where\r\nthe boiling is continued for a greater length of time.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of non-crystallizing material in the juices from which the\r\njellies are made, namely, the pectose bodies in fruits, is sufficient\r\nin most cases to prevent the crystallization of the cane sugar in the\r\njelly. The jelly is formed by these pectose bodies being present in the\r\njuice in sufficient quantities to become semi-solid on cooling after\r\nmanufacture. The solidifying may take place in a short time or only\r\nafter several hours. The juice at the time of completion of the boiling\r\nis thoroughly sterilized, and in this hot condition should be placed\r\nin sterilized vessels and covered before setting away with sterilized\r\nparchment paper or a thin film of sterilized paraffine. The covering\r\nof the surface will prevent the deposition of the seed of moulds and\r\nbacteria which often infect the top layer of jellies or other fruit\r\nproducts prepared in a similar manner whose surface is not properly\r\nprotected.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Preservatives.=--Since the care which is necessary to prepare a jelly\r\nin a thoroughly sterilized condition and to protect the exposed surface\r\nso that infection thereof cannot take place is a matter of expense and\r\nrequires great attention to details, it has been sought to avoid these\r\nby the use of chemical preservatives. Salicylic acid and benzoic acid\r\nor benzoate of soda have been the principal preservatives employed,\r\nand until state and municipal laws introduced a proper inspection or\r\nanalysis of these products the use of these chemical preservatives was\r\nvery common. In later years their use has been gradually diminished,\r\nowing to the objections on the part of the laws and the public to the\r\npresence of these bodies in the finished products. There are, however,\r\nstill on the market many products which are preserved by salicylic\r\nacid, benzoic acid, or benzoate of soda or some similar active agent.\r\n\r\nFrom the above résumé it is seen that the consumer who buys in the\r\nopen market is not quite certain that he is getting the product for\r\nwhich he pays. This condition of affairs will doubtless pass away\r\nwith the advent of the proper inspection of fruits which are used\r\nin manufacturing on a large scale and a proper supervision of the\r\nmanufacturing establishments, together with a rigid execution of the\r\nnational and state food laws. Under such conditions the adulterations\r\nwill either disappear from the market or be so labeled as to\r\npractically inform the purchaser of their character.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Marmalade.=--The term “marmalade” is applied to a special character\r\nof fruit product prepared in the same manner as jam in which the fruit\r\nis not so thoroughly pulped. The orange is a fruit which is used very\r\nextensively for making marmalade,--an orange marmalade, in other words,\r\nis only a fruit product of the character of jam and made after the same\r\nmanner. This class of fruit products is so nearly the same as jam as\r\nnot to need any special description.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration._--The adulterations to which the marmalades are\r\nsubjected are practically the same as for jams. In the study of\r\nmarmalade in the Bureau of Chemistry 96 samples were examined. Of\r\nthis number 86 were commercial products and 10 were prepared in the\r\nlaboratory of the Bureau. Of the commercial articles 18 samples,\r\nsomewhat less than 20 percent, contained no glucose. Fifty-three\r\ncontained glucose, but were not so labeled, and 15 were labeled as\r\ncompound or artificial. The percentage of solids in these products\r\nvaried within a wide limit. The maximum percentage of solids found\r\nwas 82.46 and the minimum 53.43. The average percentage of ash in the\r\nmarmalade not containing glucose was 0.32, and the average alkalinity\r\nof the ash as measured by a standard acid was 0.26. In the adulterated\r\nmarmalade containing glucose the average percentage of ash was 0.59,\r\nalmost as great as in the pure article, and the average alkalinity was\r\n0.29, somewhat greater than in the pure article.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Compound Jams and Jellies.=--A word should be said respecting\r\nthe meaning of the word “compound” as attached to fruit products,\r\nespecially jams and jellies, since it is a word which has been\r\nselected as somewhat more euphonious than the term “adulterated” or\r\n“misbranded.” So true is this that the word “compound” when placed\r\nupon a food product indicates at once to the purchaser that the\r\narticle is a mixture or substitute. The term, therefore, indicates the\r\ncharacter of sophistication. To such an extent may this be practiced\r\nthat the actual material named in connection with the word “compound”\r\nmay be absent from the mixture altogether. The term arose first on\r\naccount of the desire of the manufacturer to leave off of the labels\r\na statement of the exact composition of the contents of the package\r\nand to substitute a word of less significance, and at the same time to\r\ncomply with certain state laws which require that all fruit products\r\ncontaining glucose be labeled with the word “compound” or some similar\r\nterm. A much simpler and more direct method would be to make the label\r\na truthful one, indicating, as nearly as possible, the character of the\r\nproduct. A compound generally means a jelly or jam made without the\r\nfruit named, that is, largely of glucose. It also indicates, as a rule,\r\nthat the product is artificially colored and artificially flavored. In\r\nthese cases the word “imitation” is to be preferred, inasmuch as the\r\nmixtures bearing the word “compound” can only be regarded in reality as\r\na mixture of unlike substances.\r\n\r\n\r\n=General Conclusions.=--In regard to fruit products made by boiling\r\nwith sugar, the general statement that they should be true to name and\r\nfree from artificial colors, preservatives, or other adulterations\r\napparently covers the whole ground. If it is desired to make a cheaper\r\narticle for the benefit of consumers of small means, the principles\r\nwhich should guide the manufacturers are plain. The materials which\r\nare added should be wholesome and free of deleterious or injurious\r\nmatter. The poor man, while entitled to get a cheaper article, is\r\nlikewise entitled, as well as the rich man, to protection against\r\ndeleterious substances. In the present state of our knowledge, glucose\r\nis not regarded by the majority of hygienists as a substance injurious\r\nto health. If it be injurious it is due more to a lack of care in\r\nmanufacture than to any inherent properties. Pure glucose, being simply\r\na hydrolyzed production of starch, cannot be regarded as a substance\r\ninjurious to health. The objections to glucose which have been\r\nlegitimately made are due to the fact that the acids which have been\r\nused in converting the starch and also the sulfurous acid which has\r\nbeen used in bleaching the product have not been entirely removed. It\r\nappears that the glucose used for food purposes can be freed from all\r\nobjection by inverting the starch with which it is made with diastase\r\nand avoiding the use of all bleaching reagents. The glucose thus made\r\nwould not be water-white, nor is it desirable for edible purposes that\r\nit be so, since it is always, except, perhaps, in the manufacture\r\nof certain candies, used in connection with naturally colored food\r\nproducts. There is no reason to believe that a glucose made as above\r\nand possessing, as it naturally would, an amber or reddish color would\r\nbe made less desirable than a product which is absolutely colorless.\r\nThis suggestion, therefore, is made to the manufacturer of glucose\r\nfor edible purposes in the interest of public health and to avoid\r\nany possible condemnation of the glucose by reason of the method\r\nof manufacture, namely, that the use of acid in the manufacture of\r\nglucose be discontinued, that malt or some other form of diastase\r\nbe substituted and that bleaching, except by passing through animal\r\ncharcoal, be entirely omitted. The product made in this way would be\r\nfree from the objections which have been, and may in the future still\r\nbe, urged with reason against the use of the article at the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Preserves.=--The term “preserves” is a general one which is applied\r\nin common language to a preparation of fruit preserved by boiling\r\nwith sugar until complete sterilization is accomplished. The term in\r\nits general application includes the different varieties of preserves\r\nwhich have already been mentioned, namely, jams, marmalades, etc. It\r\nmust also be extended to include the class of fruit products known as\r\njellies, though, as a rule, it is not made so comprehensive in meaning,\r\ninasmuch as the jelly does not contain any of the solid particles\r\nof fruit. Perhaps there is no other part of the food-manufacturing\r\nindustry which is so universally practiced in the household as the\r\nmanufacture of preserves. Not only is this true of farm life in the\r\ncountry but also of those living in the city. The sterilization of\r\nfresh fruit without the use of sugar is not nearly so common as the\r\nmaking of the domestic supply of preserved fruits in the sense above\r\nmentioned. There is only one sufficient reason for the preparation of\r\nsuch foods, namely, the suspicion which attaches to the manufactured\r\narticle appearing upon the market. So universal has been the custom\r\nof artificially coloring the product, and of the use of glucose and\r\npreservatives, as to create a general impression among consumers that\r\nthe articles thus purchased in the open market are adulterated and\r\nmisbranded. When these preparations are made in the household we are at\r\nleast assured of the genuineness of the product. It must be admitted\r\nthat the art and technique of manufacture cannot possibly be so perfect\r\nin the home as in the large factories. It follows as a necessary\r\nconsequence that such goods as those indicated ought to be better and\r\ncheaper and more readily preserved if made in large manufacturing\r\ncenters than when made at home. Even those who make the genuine product\r\nsuffer in common with those who make adulterated articles, since the\r\nsuspicion of adulteration attaches to the whole output. The practice\r\nof domestic manufacture will undoubtedly continue until the public is\r\nfully convinced that better and cheaper articles can be purchased in\r\nthe open market.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Peach Preserves.=--A common practice among the housewives throughout\r\nthe United States is to boil peaches with sugar or sugar sirup, forming\r\nthe well known product, peach preserves. Preserves of this kind are\r\nconsidered a delicacy, and, as they are easily made and kept, they are\r\na very common article of diet throughout all parts of the country where\r\npeaches are grown.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fruit Butter.=--There are several preparations of fruit which differ\r\nin some respect from those just mentioned, to which the term “butter”\r\nhas been applied, such as apple butter, peach butter, etc., and these\r\nare common articles of domestic manufacture. This type of article is\r\nillustrated by a description of apple butter.\r\n\r\nApple butter is made by boiling comminuted, sound, carefully selected\r\napples of a proper degree of maturity with cider until the whole mass\r\nforms a bulk of the proper consistence. The preparation thus made is\r\ntreated with certain spices according to the desire of the manufacturer\r\nand the taste of the consumer. There is quite a quantity of material\r\ninsoluble in water in genuine fruit butter. The rest consists of water,\r\nthe added sugar, if any, and the fruit juice with which the butter is\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Fruit Butter._--Very extensive adulterations are\r\npracticed with fruit butter offered in the open market. In the Bureau\r\nof Chemistry as high as 30 percent of glucose has been found as an\r\nadded product. The addition of cane sugar cannot be regarded as an\r\nadulteration but the best fruit butters are made without it. Artificial\r\ncolors are sometimes used, and preservatives, especially benzoic acid,\r\nare quite common in the commercial article.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Brandied Fruit.=--The use of brandy in common with sugar in the\r\npreservation of fruit is widely practiced. Sometimes alcohol alone\r\nis relied upon as a preserving agent. At other times greater or less\r\nquantities of cane sugar are used. Usually heat is employed in addition\r\nto the other preserving agents to complete sterilization. Nearly all\r\nforms of fruit may be preserved in this way. Brandied cherries and\r\npeaches are perhaps the most abundant. The quantity of alcohol employed\r\nvaries between 15 and 20 percent of the total weight of the goods. The\r\nquantity of cane sugar used has been found to range from six to 20\r\npercent of the weight of the fruit. Fruit preserved in this way cannot\r\nbe regarded in the light of food solely, but only as a condimental\r\nsubstance. The eating of any large quantity of food containing that\r\npercentage of alcohol could not be accomplished without danger of\r\nintoxication. The utilization of such foods upon the table should be of\r\na restricted character, and, especially, they should not be used with\r\nchildren or very young people where the danger from the direct effects\r\nof the alcohol is magnified and the possibility of forming the alcohol\r\nhabit is also present.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Brandied Fruits._--The principal adulteration of\r\nbrandied fruit is in the use of alcohol which is not genuine brandy.\r\nIt is well known that much of the brandy offered in commerce is\r\nfictitious, that is, is not the pure distilled alcoholic product\r\nfrom sound wine properly aged in wood before using. When brandy is\r\npurchased for preserved fruit, unless special care is taken to secure\r\nthe genuine article the imitation article may be supplied. Instead of\r\nthe real brandy the manufacturers may use an article which is entirely\r\ndevoid of any product of the distillation of wine or containing only\r\na small amount thereof. The term “brandy” used with the fruit in such\r\na case is a misnomer and the article would be deemed misbranded under\r\nthe provisions of the law. The manufacturer can assure himself of the\r\npurity of the brandy by obtaining it from a bonded warehouse, since it\r\nis made under the supervision of the officials of the internal revenue\r\nand kept under such supervision until delivered to the consumer.\r\nInasmuch as preparations of this kind are regarded as delicacies and\r\nthe cost of the product does not enter materially into consideration it\r\nis highly advisable that only genuine brandy, distilled from sound wine\r\nand aged in wood for a period of not less than four years, be employed\r\nin the manufacture.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Importance of the Canning and Preserving Industries.=--The statistics\r\nfor the canning and preserving industries for the calendar year ending\r\nDecember 31, 1904, form a part of the census of manufactures, which is\r\nmade in conformity with the act of Congress of March 6, 1902, and are\r\ncompared with similar statistics for the census of 1900, which covered\r\nthe fiscal year ending May 31st.\r\n\r\nThere has been a large increase in those industries. The slight\r\ndecrease in the average number of wage-earners is more apparent than\r\nreal, and is due largely to the fact that a considerable number were\r\nemployed in fish canneries under a contract system. The contractor\r\nfurnishes the laborers and is paid for an agreed quantity of product.\r\nThe establishment reporting has no record of the number employed by\r\nthe contractors, and they were not included in the number reported,\r\nthe amount paid for such contract work being included in the item of\r\nmiscellaneous expenses. Fishermen were not included in the census, and\r\nit is possible that a larger proportion of the salted fish was prepared\r\nin connection with the actual catch than at the census of 1900, thus\r\naccounting in part, at least, for the decrease in the quantity.\r\n\r\nCANNING AND PRESERVING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, AND FISH AND OYSTERS.\r\n\r\nCOMPARATIVE SUMMARY--CENSUSES OF 1904 AND 1900.\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------+-------------+-------------+-------+\r\n                             |             |             |PERCENT|\r\n                             |             |             | OF IN-|\r\n                             |    1904.    |     1900.   |CREASE.|\r\n  ---------------------------+-------------+-------------+-------+\r\n  Number of establishments,  |        2,687|        2,182|  23.1 |\r\n  Capital,                   |  $69,589,316|  $47,970,787|  45.1 |\r\n  Salaried officials, clerks,|             |             |       |\r\n  etc.:                      |             |             |       |\r\n    Number,                  |        3,604|        2,418|  49.0 |\r\n    Salaries,                |   $3,216,773|   $1,926,639|  67.0 |\r\n  Wage-earners:              |             |             |       |\r\n    Average number,          |       50,258|       51,955|   3.3 |\r\n                             |             |             |  [35] |\r\n    Wages,                   |  $14,154,730|  $12,759,459|  10.9 |\r\n  Miscellaneous expenses,    |    8,544,497|    3,290,459| 159.7 |\r\n  Materials used,            |   69,814,330|   52,243,948|  33.6 |\r\n  Products:[36]              |             |             |       |\r\n    Aggregate value,         | $107,534,464|  $81,020,384|  32.7 |\r\n      Fruits and Vegetables--|             |             |       |\r\n        Total value,         |  $72,570,974|  $44,460,665|  63.2 |\r\n          Canned Vegetables--|             |             |       |\r\n            Pounds,          |1,672,759,438|1,142,327,265|  46.4 |\r\n            Value,           |  $45,262,148|  $28,734,598|  57.5 |\r\n          Canned Fruits--    |             |             |       |\r\n            Pounds,          |  295,760,355|  293,637,273|    .7 |\r\n            Value,           |  $11,644,042|  $11,311,062|   2.9 |\r\n          Dried Fruits--     |             |             |       |\r\n            Pounds,          |  343,579,623|   81,189,406| 323.2 |\r\n            Value,           |  $15,664,784|   $4,415,005| 254.8 |\r\n        Fish--               |             |             |       |\r\n          Total value,       |  $24,452,533|  $20,542,691|  19.0 |\r\n            Canned--         |             |             |       |\r\n              Pounds,        |  259,469,861|  167,836,808|  54.6 |\r\n              Value,         |  $15,966,513|  $14,308,723|  11.6 |\r\n            Smoked--         |             |             |       |\r\n              Pounds,        |   35,439,619|   21,252,066|  66.8 |\r\n              Value,         |   $2,362,740|     $973,041| 142.8 |\r\n            Salted--         |             |             |       |\r\n              Pounds,        |  112,156,655|  125,669,131|  10.8 |\r\n                             |             |             |  [35] |\r\n              Value,         |   $6,123,280|   $5,260,927|  16.4 |\r\n        Oysters--            |             |             |       |\r\n          Value,             |   $3,799,412|    2,054,800|  84.9 |\r\n       All other products,   |    6,711,545|  $13,962,228|  51.9 |\r\n                             |             |             |  [35] |\r\n  ---------------------------+-------------+-------------+-------+\r\n\r\n  [35] Decrease.\r\n\r\n  [36] Exclusive of fruits and vegetables valued at $715,920, fish at\r\n  $274,403, and oysters at $12,900, manufactured by establishments\r\n  classified as food preparations, pickles, preserves and sauces,\r\n  slaughtering and meat packing, wholesale, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Importance of the Industry.=--The importance of the canning industry\r\nis not to be measured solely by its commercial extent. The principle of\r\nthe conservation of food products by sterilization or pasteurization is\r\nof immense significance in the nutrition of man. It enables nourishing\r\nfoods of a perishable character to be kept and transported to great\r\ndistances and to be used in localities where fresh foods of similar\r\nkinds are otherwise unobtainable. Such preserved foods mean everything\r\nto pioneers, explorers, armies, and navies. The “winning of the west”\r\nin the United States has been marked by the débris of the rusty cans.\r\nThe roads along which the pioneers who settled the great American\r\ndesert marched since 1865 have been bordered with the discarded\r\npackages in which they carried their foods.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtless true that foods when they can be had fresh are to\r\nbe preferred to those which have been sterilized. It is also true\r\nthat many unsterilized foods from unsanitary environments are more\r\ndangerous in the fresh state than when they have been exposed to a\r\nhigh temperature. Taking into consideration all the circumstances\r\nin the case, it must be conceded that the process of sterilization,\r\nfirst practiced by Appert and afterward placed on a scientific basis\r\nby Pasteur, has proved of almost immeasurable advantage to mankind.\r\nThus for this greater reason the character and quality of foods thus\r\npreserved should be wholly above suspicion, and no adulteration\r\nor sophistication of any kind should be practiced therewith. The\r\nmanufacturer is quite as much interested as the consumer in placing the\r\nwhole output of sterilized foods on a plane above suspicion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VII.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE OILS AND FATS, AND NUTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE OILS AND FATS.\r\n\r\nThe production of a substance known as fat or oil, composed of oxygen,\r\nhydrogen, and carbon in the form of a fatty acid and combined with\r\nglycerine, is a function of almost every plant. The fat acids are\r\nusually in combination with glycerine, which plays the part of a\r\nbase and in so far as its proportion by weight is concerned is much\r\nless important than the fatty acid itself. In round numbers it may\r\nbe said that nine-tenths of all glycerids or fats are composed of a\r\nfatty acid and one-tenth of glycerine. When at ordinary temperature\r\nthis combination is in a liquid form it is called an oil, and when\r\nat ordinary temperature it is in a solid or semi-solid condition it\r\nis known as a fat. The term “ordinary temperature” means in this\r\nconnection that of an ordinary living room and not the extremes\r\nof outside temperature. In general terms it may be said that the\r\ntemperatures referred to are included between the minimum of 50 degrees\r\nand the maximum of 85 degrees F. In so far as chemical composition and\r\ndietetic properties are concerned, there is no distinction between\r\nthe oils and the fats. The names are simply a means of ordinary\r\ndiscrimination which has assumed importance by reason of common usage.\r\n\r\nThere are three of the fatty acids which are particularly important\r\nfrom a dietetic point of view which go to make up the greater part\r\nof these fatty and edible vegetable oils and fats. These three acids\r\nare oleic, stearic, and palmitic. Of the three, oleic acid is by far\r\nthe most important, as it constitutes the greater part of nearly all\r\nthese bodies, especially of oils. In fact the term “olein” and oil\r\nare of common origin. Palmitic acid exists chiefly in certain forms\r\nof vegetable oil and fats, while stearic acid is a very important\r\nconstituent of animal oils and fats.\r\n\r\nThese three acids uniting with glycerine form the glycerids which\r\nmake up the great body of edible and animal oils and fats, and these\r\nprincipal glycerids are known as olein, palmitin, and stearin,\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Chemical Characteristics.=--The chemical composition of these bodies\r\nhas been pointed out above. There is, however, in almost all cases,\r\nsome free acid present in the compound, that is, an acid which is\r\npresent uncombined with the glycerine. This free acid is usually\r\npresent in small quantities and is more abundant in the overripe and\r\nolder plants than in the freshly matured parts. The natural oil also\r\ncontains certain other ingredients which may be regarded as impurities,\r\nand which it is necessary to remove from the oils by a process of\r\npurification or refining before they are ready for the table. These\r\nimpurities may be of a mechanical nature, that is, consisting of\r\nparts of the material itself from which the oil is expressed or\r\nof certain juices not oils which are found in the animal tissue,\r\nportions of protein and other forms of nitrogenous matter, and traces\r\nof carbohydrates and gums. The oils have certain definite chemical\r\nreactions which are common to them as a class. Among these may be\r\ncited, principally, the faculty of absorbing, under certain conditions,\r\nthe halogens, namely iodin, bromin, and chlorin.\r\n\r\nWithout entering into any technical description of this process it is\r\nsufficient to say here that the degree of absorption of iodin is in\r\na measure the test for the varieties of oil. The different vegetable\r\noils have, as a rule, certain definite relations to the absorption of\r\niodin by means of which they may be to a certain extent identified or\r\nseparated from similar bodies. The degree of absorption is expressed\r\nin the percentage by weight of the oil itself and is known as the\r\niodin number. If, for instance, a gram of any particular oil absorbs\r\none gram of iodin, it is said to have an iodin number of 100. Many\r\noils absorb more than their own weight of iodin, while many others\r\nabsorb very much less. Another characteristic of oil is found in the\r\nfact that with certain reagents, such as an acid either in a dilute\r\nstate or in a concentrated state, definite colors are produced which\r\nare characteristic of the variety of oil in question. As an example\r\nof this may be cited the faculty which cottonseed oil has of reducing\r\nnitrate of silver to the metallic state, leaving the silver in that\r\nfinely divided form which has a black color. This is the only oil in\r\ncommon use which has this faculty, and hence it may be regarded as a\r\ncharacteristic test.\r\n\r\nAnother characteristic chemical property of cottonseed oil is the color\r\nwhich is produced in the Halphen reaction, which has already been\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nOne of the most valuable chemical properties of oil is the amount\r\nof heat which is produced when it is burned. Inasmuch as oils in\r\nrelation to their food value are useful chiefly for the production\r\nof animal heat, this chemical property becomes of great hygienic and\r\ndietetic significance. Of all classes of food products the oils and\r\nfats have the highest calorific power. If, for instance, it is said\r\nin general that one gram of carbohydrates, such as sugar or starch,\r\non complete combustion will yield 4,000 calories, one gram of protein\r\n5,500 calories, then one gram of oil or fat will yield 9,300 calories.\r\nThe fats and oils vary among themselves in respect of the number of\r\ncalories yielded, but all of them give, approximately, the number\r\nlast mentioned. It therefore follows that oils and fats are the most\r\nvaluable constituents of food in respect of the production of heat and\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Crystalline Characteristics.=--The forms of crystals which the fats\r\nassume on solidifying are valuable indicators of the nature of the oil.\r\nWhile these crystal forms are not in all cases distinct, yet they are\r\ninfluenced to a greater or less extent by the nature of the oil itself.\r\nThus the presence of any particular oil may very often be ascertained\r\nby the examination of the crystals produced by lowering the temperature\r\nvery slowly or by dissolving the oil in a volatile solvent and\r\ngradually evaporating the solvent. Tests of even greater delicacy may\r\nbe obtained by first saponifying the fat or oil, separating the fatty\r\nacid, and subjecting it to crystallization.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Distribution of Oils in Plants.=--In nearly all cases the part of the\r\nplant which contains the most oil is the seeds. In fact all of the\r\nvegetable oils which are used for edible purposes are extracted from\r\nthe seed of the plant. In the case of olives the meaty portion around\r\nthe seed yields the edible oil of highest value, but in all other\r\ncases of edible oils they are derived from the seeds themselves. It is\r\na mistake to suppose that the seeds are the only parts of the plant\r\nthat contain oil. It is found in all parts of vegetable substances,\r\nbut is usually concentrated in the seed. It is rather an interesting\r\nfact to know that in the seeds of plants both the protein and fats or\r\noils are found, as a rule, in a highly concentrated state, while the\r\ncarbohydrates are not found chiefly in the seed itself, that is the\r\ngerm, but distributed in the fleshy envelope surrounding it or in roots\r\nor tubers.\r\n\r\nThe oils and fats are almost all soluble in ether and petroleum ether,\r\nthough there are some exceptions to this, as in the case of castor\r\noil, which is also insoluble in petroleum ether or gasoline. On the\r\ncontrary, oils and fats, as a rule, are not soluble in alcohol, but the\r\nfatty acids derived from them are. Castor oil is also an exception to\r\nthis rule, since it is quite soluble in pure alcohol.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Drying and Non-drying Vegetable Oils.=--It might be supposed that if\r\none vegetable oil be edible they all would be. This would probably be\r\nthe case if vegetable oils were all composed almost exclusively of the\r\nthree classes of glycerids, which have been mentioned above, but such\r\nis not the case. There are other fatty acids in combination with the\r\nglycerids which exist in vegetable oils, and chief among these may be\r\nmentioned linoleic acid, which exists in considerable quantities in the\r\noil of flax seed, and gives to it its valuable property of a drying\r\noil which makes it so useful in the manufacture of paints. Whenever\r\nvegetable oils and fats contain any especial quantity of linoleic acid,\r\nor any other fatty acid which has drying properties, they are rendered\r\nmore or less unfit for human consumption. The number of drying oils is\r\nvery great, but the most important are linseed oil, hempseed oil, and\r\npoppyseed oil. Other vegetable oils have, to a certain degree, drying\r\nproperties, and among those which are most marked in this particular\r\nmay be mentioned cottonseed oil, sesamé oil, maize or corn oil, and\r\nrapeseed oil. Types of the oils which have the least drying properties\r\nand which are regarded as types of non-drying oils are olive oil and\r\npeanut oil. The castor oil group is distinguished partially from the\r\nother vegetable oils because it contains, or is likely to contain, more\r\nor less of a somewhat poisonous substance, namely, ricinolein, which is\r\npeculiar to castor oil and to which its purgative value as a medicine\r\nis due. The castor bean also contains a very poisonous nitrogenous\r\nbase, ricin, very small quantities of which may be incorporated in the\r\noil itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Melting Point and Solidifying Point._--The oils and fats differ\r\ngreatly among themselves in the temperature at which they become solid\r\nor liquid. If a solid fat or oil is subjected to a gradual rise of\r\ntemperature it does not pass at once or suddenly from a solid to a\r\nliquid state, but there is a gradual liquefying,--thus olein first\r\nbecomes liquid and the stearin and palmitin become liquid at a higher\r\ndegree of temperature. The same phenomenon in its inverse order occurs\r\nwhen a liquid fat is cooled until it solidifies. The moment at which\r\nthe fats become semi-liquid, liquid, or semi-solid, therefore, is not\r\nto be determined with absolute precision, but only approximately, and\r\nthat temperature is designated as the melting or solidifying point\r\nrespectively. When the process is carefully conducted under standard\r\nconditions the different fats and oils have very definite melting\r\nor solidifying points, as determined in the manner described above,\r\nand these temperatures should be sufficient to make the melting and\r\nsolidifying points valuable indications of the character or kind of oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Physical Characteristics.=--The difference in the physical\r\ncharacteristics of vegetable fats and oils is even greater than\r\nin their chemical composition. Unfortunately for the chemist, the\r\nvegetable fats and oils naturally have about the same color or at least\r\nvery slight variations therefrom, namely, an amber tint, so that, as a\r\nrule, it is impossible to discriminate between these oils by their mere\r\ncolor alone. The edible oils also have very much the same taste, so\r\nthat this physical property is not of any very great diagnostic value.\r\nSome of the more important physical properties by which the oils are\r\ndistinguished are the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n=Refractive Index.=--The well-known phenomenon which is shown by water\r\nof bending sharply a ray of light falling upon it in a direction\r\noblique to its surface is known as refraction, and the degree of\r\ndeflection of the ray is a measure of the refractive index. This is\r\neasily illustrated by putting a straight stick or rod into still water\r\nat an angle to its surface. The stick or rod will appear to be broken\r\nor bent at the surface. Oils have a higher faculty of deflecting\r\nthe ray of light than water. For instance, if in round numbers the\r\nrefractive index of water is represented by 1.33, the refractive\r\nindex of oil may be represented by 1.44. The oils differ greatly\r\namong themselves in the magnitude of the refractive index, but these\r\nindexes are all approximately of the magnitude last mentioned. Hence a\r\ndetermination of the refractive index is a valuable means of helping to\r\ndiscriminate between oils of different kinds.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Reichert-Meissl Number.=--Attention was called above to the fact that\r\nin addition to three special forms of fatty acids there were many\r\nothers present in oils in small quantities. Among these are found acids\r\nwhich are volatile in a current of steam, which is not the case with\r\nthe oleic, palmitic, and stearic acids. Among the most important of the\r\nvolatile acids is the one which exists in large quantities in butter,\r\nnamely butyric acid. The quantity of volatile acid is determined\r\narbitrarily by the amount of a standard alkali solution which will be\r\nneutralized by the volatile acid from five grams of fat. In the case of\r\nbutter, for instance, it may be said that in round numbers it requires\r\n28 cubic centimeters of standard alkali to neutralize the volatile acid\r\nproduced according to the above method of procedure. In cottonseed oil\r\nthe amount of standard solution required to neutralize the volatile\r\nacid obtained in the same way is extremely minute, amounting to less\r\nthan one-half cubic centimeter.\r\n\r\nI have given above a brief description of some of the physical and\r\nchemical characteristics of oils and fats in order that the reader not\r\nspecially trained in chemistry may understand thoroughly the references\r\nmade to these properties in the general description given of vegetable\r\nfats and oils. It is not necessary to be a skilled chemist in order\r\nto have a general knowledge of some of the points which are of most\r\ninterest in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Saponification Value.=--As is well known, one of the most common uses\r\nof oils and fats is in soap making. Soap consists of the products\r\nof chemical reactions by means of which the glycerine contained in\r\nan oil or fat are set free and a mineral or other base substituted\r\ntherefor. For instance, lye consists of the hydrate or carbonate of\r\npotash and soda. When an oil is heated with a lye the fatty acid\r\nleaves the glycerine in the oil and combines with the potash or soda\r\nof the lye. The number of milligrams of potash or soda required to\r\nsaponify one gram of fat or oil is called its saponification value. For\r\ninstance, in the case of cottonseed oil it requires, in round numbers,\r\n190 milligrams of potash or hydrate of potash (KOH) to replace the\r\nglycerine in one gram of oil. The quantity of potash required for an\r\nedible oil to make a complete saponification varies, and hence this\r\nnumber becomes one of the means of distinguishing between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Specific Gravity.=--The relative weight of a given volume of oil\r\ncompared with the weight of the same volume of water at the same\r\ntemperature or at some standard temperature is known as its specific\r\ngravity. The oils and fats are universally lighter than water, and in\r\nthe comparison the unit weight of water is assumed to be unity or 100\r\nor 1000--usually unity or 1000. If the relative weight of water is\r\nunity, then the relative weight or specific gravity of oil is expressed\r\nas a decimal fraction. For instance, if water is taken as unity the\r\nspecific gravity of oil equals .912; if the relative weight of water is\r\nassumed to be one thousand then the specific gravity expressed above\r\nis 912. Unless it is stated otherwise, in all references to specific\r\ngravity of these oils it is assumed that the comparison is between the\r\nunit weight of water and oil at the same temperature. This is the most\r\nconvenient form for comparison for general use, though for strictly\r\nscientific purposes it is customary to refer all specific gravity\r\nnumbers to water at the temperature of its maximum density, namely 4\r\ndegrees C. (39 degrees F.). At this temperature a given weight of water\r\nhas its smallest volume, in other words its greatest density. When\r\nwater is raised to a temperature above that mentioned, it expands and\r\nits volume becomes larger. When it is cooled to a temperature below\r\nfour degrees C., its volume also expands.\r\n\r\nThe variations in the specific gravity of the common oils is not very\r\ngreat, and therefore the specific gravity is not the most valuable\r\nindication in discriminating between these oils.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIBLE VEGETABLE OILS.\r\n\r\nWhile there is very little chemical difference between the fats\r\nof animals and the oils of plants, the difference is sufficiently\r\ndistinguished to secure a proper degree of identification and\r\nclassification. Both classes of bodies are composed of the fatty acids\r\ncombined with glycerine. The three fatty acids which are most important\r\nfrom the edible point of view and also from the chemical are oleic,\r\nstearic, and palmitic. When these acids are united with glycerine as\r\nthe basic element, they form three classes of oils or fats to which\r\nthe names olein, stearin, and palmitin are respectively given. A\r\ndistinction may also be made between a fat and an oil by observing its\r\nphysical consistence at ordinary room temperature of approximately\r\nfrom 70 to 80 degrees F. It is usual to speak of the bodies which are\r\nliquid at such temperature as oils, while those that are solid under\r\nlike conditions are known as fats. A compound of this description does\r\nnot pass suddenly from one state to another. In the case of a fat, for\r\ninstance, which is solid at ordinary temperature, it passes by gradual\r\nstages from that condition to a slowly softening mass and then to a\r\ncomplete liquid as the temperature is raised. On the other hand, an oil\r\npasses gradually through the same stages to the condition of a solid\r\nbody as the temperature is lowered. Of the different constituents the\r\nolein has the lowest melting point, pure olein being still liquid at\r\nquite a low temperature, approaching even the freezing point of water.\r\nStearin and palmitin on the contrary, if in a pure state, are solid\r\nat a temperature even above that of the room and above that of blood\r\nheat. In the mixture of these bodies it is evident that a complicated\r\nstructure must be present which is composed of different bodies of\r\nvarying melting points and passing through all different degrees of\r\ntemperature from a solid to a liquid state or vice versâ. It is evident\r\nthat an oil has a larger proportion of olein in its composition and a\r\nfat a larger proportion of stearin and palmitin.\r\n\r\nAnimal fats are composed chiefly of olein and stearin, while strictly\r\nvegetable oils are principally olein, and palm oil is composed chiefly\r\nof stearin and palmitin.\r\n\r\nIn butter fat there is introduced an important additional compound of a\r\nfatty acid with glycerine, namely butyrin, which is made up of a union\r\nof glycerine with butyric acid. Butter also contains other components\r\nor glycerids, but in small quantities. Oleic, stearic, and palmitic\r\nacids are insoluble in water and not volatile at the boiling point of\r\nwater. Butyric acid is soluble in water and is volatile at the boiling\r\npoint of water. The first kinds of acid are therefore called “fixed”\r\nand the second “volatile.”\r\n\r\nThe edible vegetable oils like the animal fats are highly nutritious\r\nin the sense that they afford to a greater degree than any other kind\r\nof food product the elements necessary to the production of heat and\r\nenergy. The average number of calories to one gram of edible oil is\r\nin round numbers 9,300. When this number is compared with the average\r\nnumber of calories in one gram of sugar or starch, namely 4,000, it is\r\nseen that fats and oils are two and one-fourth times as valuable as\r\nsugar in the production of heat and energy. Since the greater part of\r\nthe food consumed by an animal is utilized in the production of heat\r\nand energy, it is seen that the fats and oils must be classed as the\r\nmost concentrated and in that sense the most valuable human foods.\r\n\r\nThe use of edible vegetable oils is also advisable for hygienic\r\npurposes. They are readily assimilated and digested, and they produce\r\na physical effect upon the process of digestion which is a matter of\r\nimportance. The free use of edible vegetable oils is to be recommended\r\nin cases of constipation or where there are mechanical difficulties\r\nin the digestive process. In these cases it is consumed in larger\r\nquantities than would ordinarily be the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Use of Edible Oils.=--The edible oils are used most extensively on\r\nthe table as the base of salad-dressing. Many succulent vegetables,\r\nas has already been stated, are eaten very commonly with condimental\r\nsubstances such as vinegar, salt, spices, etc., and as a vehicle for\r\nthese condimental substances there is nothing superior or even equal to\r\nthe edible vegetable oils. Vinegar, itself, owes its active principle,\r\nnamely, its acid, to a member of the fatty acid series, so that the\r\nmixture of vinegar with oil is not a bringing together of two wholly\r\ndifferent substances but of two substances belonging to the same\r\ngeneral family. Vinegar itself has no value as a food, but is useful\r\nsolely for condimental purposes. On the other hand the edible oil is\r\nnot only condimental, increasing the pleasant taste of the compound,\r\nbut also has a high food value. Edible oils may also be used in the\r\nplace of lard and other animal fats in the preparation of bread and\r\npastry, serving the purpose of shortening. Edible oils are also highly\r\nuseful as a vehicle for frying foods, such as oysters, croquettes,\r\ndoughnuts, etc.\r\n\r\nThe heating of an oil or fat to a high temperature produces a certain\r\ndegree of decomposition with a development of an aromatic and sometimes\r\nunpleasant product known as acrolein. It is not believed that this\r\nchange is as detrimental to digestion as is commonly supposed. Products\r\nwhich are fried in oil, or boiled in oil, which is probably a better\r\nterm, as described above, are not to be considered wholly indigestible,\r\nthough it cannot be denied that they are not the best things for\r\ndelicate stomachs or those which are in any way weakened by disease.\r\nIn the case of a healthy individual, however, a moderate quantity of\r\nsuch products may be eaten without any great danger of producing a\r\nderangement of digestion. If these bodies are found to be indigestible,\r\nit is probably not due to the fact that they contain large quantities\r\nof oil but rather to the decomposition effected by the high temperature\r\nand the hardening of the periphery of the bodies to such an extent as\r\nto make them difficultly amenable to the activities of the digestive\r\nferments.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Acorn Oil.=--The oil of the acorn is sometimes used for edible\r\npurposes. It is extracted by pressure, and the nature of the product\r\ndepends upon the variety of the acorn. Acorn oil has at 15 degrees a\r\nspecific gravity of .916 and an iodin number of 100. It is not of any\r\ncommercial importance as an edible oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Almond Oil.=--Almond oil is not so commonly used for edible purposes\r\nas it is for pharmaceutical preparations. By reason of its flavoring\r\nproperties, however, it may sometimes be used for food purposes, and a\r\nbrief description, therefore, is advisable.\r\n\r\nAlmond oil is obtained from the seed of the bitter almond, a variety of\r\n_Amygdalus communis_ L. It may also be extracted from the seeds of the\r\nsweet almond, but these contain less oil than the bitter almond seed\r\nand the oil is not so useful for flavoring purposes. The bitter almond\r\nwhose seeds are used for the extraction of oil are grown chiefly in\r\nMorocco, the Canary Islands, Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Sicily,\r\nSyria, and Persia. The almond kernel contains about 40 percent of oil.\r\nAlmond oil is said by most observers to be free from stearin, and it\r\nis therefore an oil which is composed almost exclusively of olein.\r\nThe specific gravity of almond oil at 15 degrees C. is almost exactly\r\nthat of rapeseed oil, being only a trifle higher. The average number\r\nexpressing the specific gravity at that temperature is .918. Its iodin\r\nvalue is slightly lower than that of rapeseed oil, being about 97.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulterations._--Almond oil is often adulterated with other cheaper\r\noils. Among these those which are principally used are cottonseed\r\noil, walnut oil, poppyseed oil, sesamé, peanut, apricot-kernel and\r\npeach-kernel oil, and lard oil. Those most frequently used are\r\nthe apricot and peach, since these oils contain the characteristic\r\nprinciple which gives the bitter taste to the kernels of this class in\r\nfruits. Often almond oils are offered to the trade which are composed\r\nexclusively of peach-kernel or apricot-kernel oil. Whenever the iodin\r\nnumber of an almond oil runs very high it is an indication that it\r\nis composed largely of peach or apricot oil. The detection of small\r\nquantities of these oils when added to almond oil is a very difficult\r\nmatter and can only be accomplished by the expert chemist.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cottonseed Oil.=--One of the most important edible oils in the world,\r\nand especially from the point of view of production in the United\r\nStates, is that derived from the seed of the cotton plant (_Gossypium\r\nherbaceum_).\r\n\r\nThe cotton plant grows over a wide area in the United States, including\r\nall of the southern states and extending into southern Virginia,\r\nsouthern Kentucky, southern Missouri, and Oklahoma. In former years\r\nthe cotton plant was cultivated solely for its fiber. It is only in\r\nthe last quarter of a century that the high value of its seed for\r\nmany purposes has been realized. The seed of the cotton plant is\r\npreëminently rich in oil and protein. It contains traces of certain\r\npoisonous alkaloids, betain and cholin, the presence of which renders\r\nits indiscriminate use for cattle food in some cases dangerous. In the\r\npreparation of oil, however, no trace of these poisonous substances is\r\nfound, since they exist solely in the non-fatty tissues of the seed.\r\nThe production and refining of the oil has now grown to be a great\r\nindustry and has already added much to the wealth of the cotton growers\r\nand the comfort and nutrition of the people in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Magnitude of the Cottonseed Oil Industry._--The average cotton crop of\r\nthe United States is about 12,000,000 bales of about 500 pounds each.\r\nFor every bale of cotton there is produced 1,000 pounds of seed. This\r\nwould make the average cottonseed crop of the country about 6,000,000\r\ntons. It is estimated that not over two-thirds of this is used in the\r\nmills; this would make about 4,000,000 tons. The average yield of 40\r\ngallons to a ton shows the production of crude oil to be 3,200,000\r\nbarrels of 50 gallons each. This oil in refining loses on the average\r\nabout 8 percent, which would leave 2,944,000 barrels of refined oil for\r\nedible and other purposes. Not less than two-thirds of this oil is used\r\nfor edible purposes. A conservative estimate would place the quantity\r\nused for food between two millions and two millions and a half barrels\r\nper annum. The quantity varies with the prices of other fats.\r\n\r\nCotton seed is brought to the mills from the gins either by rail in\r\nbox cars or in wagons. On arrival at the mills, it is stored in large\r\nsheds, known as seed houses. A single seed house will often contain\r\nas much as 5,000 to 10,000 tons. The seed is carried into the mill by\r\nmeans of conveyers. It first goes through coarse screens which remove\r\nthe greater part of the trash and sand, after which it is passed over\r\nmagnetized iron plates which remove nails and pieces of iron which may\r\nhave accidentally gotten into the seed. After the seed is thoroughly\r\ncleaned it passes through gins known as linters, which remove from 40\r\nto 50 pounds of short staple cotton known in the trade as “linters.”\r\nThis cotton is used for preparing cotton batts, mattresses, etc.\r\nConveyers carry the seed from the linters to the hullers, which are\r\nrapidly revolving drums covered with cutting knives which chop up the\r\nseed. From the hullers the cut-up seed pass over a series of screens\r\nwhere the meats are shaken out while the conveyors carry the hulls to\r\na suitable store house. The hulls are used for cattle food. The meats\r\nare carried to the crusher rolls, through which they pass. These rolls\r\nbreak up oil cells to a large extent and leave the meats in a finely\r\ndivided condition. From the crusher rolls the meats are carried to\r\nsteam-jacketed kettles provided with agitators. There they are cooked\r\nto the proper point, which is determined by feel and smell. From the\r\nheaters the meats are dropped into cake formers, where they are formed\r\ninto shape of cakes between camel’s hair press cloths in which they are\r\nplaced in the heavy hydraulic presses which press out the oil. Good\r\npress-room work will give out 45 gallons of oil to the ton and leave in\r\nthe cake between 6 and 7 percent of oil.\r\n\r\nThe crude oil as it leaves the presses varies in color from light\r\nsherry to deep claret. The variation is due to local conditions\r\naffecting the seed, also the manner of treatment in cooking. The flavor\r\nof the crude oil varies greatly in the different parts of the country.\r\nThat made in Georgia and Carolina has a strong flavor of peanut, while\r\nthat made in the Mississippi Valley and Texas has more the flavor of\r\nsweet Indian corn.\r\n\r\nTo prepare crude oil for edible purposes, it must go through a process\r\nof refining; this is accomplished by agitating in large tanks with\r\ncaustic soda solution. When the soda is added in the proper amount,\r\nthe coloring matter, free fatty acids, and vegetable matter contained\r\nin the oil are converted into a mucilaginous soap which separates in\r\ndark-colored flakes through the oil when heat is applied. When the\r\ngranulation has reached the proper point, agitation is stopped, and the\r\nflaky soap stock settles at the bottom of the tank, leaving a clear,\r\nlight, greenish-golden oil on top. The best practice allows tanks to\r\nsettle about 12 hours, after which the soap stock has drawn off and\r\nthe well settled yellow oil is removed to a settling tank where it\r\nis gently heated to remove moisture and remaining soap stock. This\r\nproduces what is known as prime summer yellow oil. This oil has a sweet\r\nflavor and light yellow color. Unfortunately when used for cooking\r\nit gives off a very disagreeable odor and leaves a bad flavor in the\r\narticle of food cooked with it. This renders further purification\r\nnecessary. The oil is heated to temperatures varying from 150 to 200\r\ndegrees F. and agitated in kettles with fuller’s earth, after which\r\nit passes through filter presses, which remove the fuller’s earth\r\nand leave the oil very nearly white. In this condition the oil is\r\nstill unfit for cooking purposes, on account of the peculiar flavor\r\ngiven by the fuller’s earth treatment, which is commonly removed by\r\ntreatment with steam. Details of this deodorizing process vary and are\r\nregarded as trade secrets. The oil so prepared is largely used in the\r\npreparation of substitutes for lard and similar cooking fats. Such oil\r\nis a great improvement over the ordinary summer yellow and bleached\r\noils, but falls short of being an ideal oil.\r\n\r\nWithin the last few years a cottonseed oil has been put on the market\r\nin which the objections to the use of cottonseed oil as food have been\r\nas nearly overcome as the chemical nature of the oil will permit. The\r\noil produced by this process is practically odorless and tasteless and\r\ncan be used satisfactorily for all culinary purposes. Large quantities\r\nare used by the bakers in place of lard. (David Wesson.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Further Details._--The cotton seed from various sources is put through\r\na screen to take out the bolls and coarse material. The seed is then\r\nput through a gin to remove as far as possible any remaining lint, of\r\nwhich about 20 pounds per ton of seed are obtained. The clean seed is\r\nnext sent to a huller composed of revolving cylinders covered with\r\nknives, which cut up both seed and hull. The chips are then conveyed\r\nto a screen placed on a vibrating frame, through which the kernels\r\nfall. The hulls are carried by an endless belt to the furnaces, where\r\nthey are burned. The kernels of the seed are conveyed to crusher\r\nrolls, where they are ground to a fine meal. The meal is then sent to\r\na heater, where it remains from twenty to forty minutes. These heaters\r\nhave a temperature of 210 to 215 degrees F.\r\n\r\nThe hot meal is formed into cakes by machinery; these are wrapped in\r\ncloth and placed in the press. About sixteen pounds of meal are put in\r\neach cake. The cakes are placed in a hydraulic press, where a pressure\r\nof from 3,000 to 4,000 pounds per square inch is applied. The press is\r\nalso kept warm. The expressed cakes contain only about 10 percent of\r\noil. The cake is sold as cattle food or for fertilizing purposes. The\r\ncrude oil as thus expressed contains about 1.5 percent of free acid,\r\nalso a notable quantity of water and solid matters in suspension. The\r\nmanufacture of cottonseed oil usually takes place in the winter months\r\nimmediately after the ginning of the cotton is completed. The oil is\r\nlikely to become rancid if kept unpurified until the hot months. The\r\ncrude oil is collected in oil tanks at the press and shipped to the\r\nrefining houses. In winter time when tanks are sent to the north where\r\nthe temperature is very low the contents of the tank become solid\r\nunless protected from the action of the cold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.--REMOVING THE OIL CAKES FROM A COTTONSEED\r\nPRESS.--(_Courtesy of David Wesson._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Refining Process._--The first step in the refining of a crude\r\ncottonseed oil is to have it stored in large and deep tanks where it\r\nremains at rest for a proper length of time. During this period of\r\nrest the heavy mechanical impurities and water settle to the bottom\r\nof the tank and are typically known as “foots.” The oily portions of\r\nthese fats are used in the manufacture of soap and for other technical\r\npurposes. The tanks may be connected with steam jackets in order to\r\nkeep the oil at a proper temperature. During the process of deposition\r\nthe oil is also treated with an alkali to neutralize the free acid\r\nwhich it contains. The precipitate formed by this process together\r\nwith the principal part of the soaps produced are recovered with the\r\n“foots.” A solution of caustic or carbonated soda is one generally\r\nemployed in this process of refining. If the admixture of caustic\r\nsoda occurs at the time of filling the tank, the contents are kept\r\nwell agitated for a sufficient length of time to secure an intimate\r\nmixture of the oil with the lye. Usually the deposition of the solid\r\nmatter is accomplished in from two to three days. The supernatant oil\r\nis of a light yellow color, but not sufficiently pure to admit of\r\nbeing used for edible purposes. This yellow oil is treated again in\r\na similar manner and allowed to settle a second time, or it is mixed\r\nwith some substance which will facilitate the operation, and subjected\r\nto filtration by means of which a perfectly bright oil is secured. If,\r\nduring this process, the oil has never been chilled so as to separate\r\na part of its stearin, it is called summer oil, as an indication that\r\nit only remains clear during the hot weather. Oils intended for winter\r\nuse are chilled before finally being put into packages, and the stearin\r\nwhich is separated at this low temperature is removed by filtration.\r\nThe residual oil which is capable of remaining liquid at a low\r\ntemperature by reason of the removal of a portion of its stearin, as\r\nabove described, is known in the trade as winter oil. In this process\r\nof filtration fuller’s earth is frequently employed, which not only\r\npromotes the filtration but also absorbs and retains a large part of\r\nthe color of the oil, which thus treated is almost colorless. Where\r\ncottonseed oil is used for mixing with lard it is highly important that\r\nit be practically free of color. When, however, it is used for mixing\r\nwith oleomargarine the more yellow it is the more highly prized.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extraction of Oil by Means of Petroleum._--The light oils which are\r\nproduced in the refining of petroleum and commonly called gasoline are\r\ntypical solvents for fat and oil. Instead of extracting the oil by the\r\npressure process, as described above, a practically complete extraction\r\nmay be secured by successive treatments with the light petroleum oils.\r\nThe principle of the process is exactly that of the extraction of sugar\r\nfrom sugar beets by hot water in the process of the manufacture of beet\r\nsugar. The cottonseed cake or pressed meal is broken into fragments of\r\napproximate size, placed in tanks, and treated with successive portions\r\nof light petroleum. The extraction is arranged in such a way as to be\r\na continuous one, that is, the vessels for handling the oil cakes are\r\narranged _en batterie_ as in the case of beet sugar extraction. By this\r\nmethod all except a mere trace of the oil is extracted from the cake.\r\nThe light petroleum oils are subsequently separated from the cottonseed\r\noil by distillation and are used again in the process. There is little\r\nloss of petroleum oil. Where cottonseed oil is used for technical\r\npurposes there is no objection to this method of extraction, and much\r\nis to be said in its favor since greater yields of oil are secured.\r\nWhen used for edible purposes, however, petroleum extracted cottonseed\r\noil is not of as high a quality as that extracted by pressure. It is\r\ndifficult to remove all traces of petroleum, especially the odor, and\r\nthere are constituents extracted by petroleum which are not mixed with\r\nthe oil when it is separated by pressure. It is advisable, therefore,\r\nthat cottonseed oil used for edible purposes be cold-press extracted\r\nand not petroleum extracted oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Standard for Cottonseed Oil._--The official standards for cottonseed\r\noil are as follows:\r\n\r\n“Cottonseed oil is the oil obtained from the seeds of cotton plants\r\n(_Gossypium hirsutum_ L., _G. Barbadense_ L., or _G. herbaceum_\r\nL.) and subjected to the usual refining processes; it is free from\r\nrancidity; has a refractive index (25 degrees C.) not less than one\r\nand forty-seven hundred ten-thousandths (1.4700) and not exceeding one\r\nand forty-seven and twenty-five ten-thousandths (1.4725); and an iodin\r\nnumber not less than one hundred and four (104) and not exceeding one\r\nhundred and ten (110).\r\n\r\n“‘Winter-yellow’ cottonseed oil is expressed cottonseed oil from which\r\na portion of the stearin has been separated by chilling and pressure.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hazelnut Oil.=--The oil of the hazelnut is to a limited extent used\r\nfor edible purposes. It is extracted from the seed of the hazelnut\r\ntree (_Corylus avellana_ L). The seeds are very rich in oil and are\r\nsaid to contain from 50 to 60 percent thereof. The oil is almost free\r\nof stearin and is said to contain only about one percent. The rest of\r\nit consists chiefly of olein, there being but 12 percent of palmitin.\r\nWhile it is an edible oil, it is used chiefly in the manufacture of\r\nperfumes and as a lubricating oil. Its high price, however, excludes it\r\nfrom any general use, except for special purposes. Its specific gravity\r\nat 15 degrees is .916, and it absorbs about 86 percent of its weight of\r\niodin.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Olive Oil.=--By far the most important of edible oils, both on account\r\nof its abundance and of its palatability, is olive oil. Olive oil has\r\nbeen used from the earliest historical times and probably was the first\r\nvegetable oil that was manufactured to any considerable extent in\r\nthe early history of civilization. Its qualities have maintained for\r\nit a market among the nations of the world in spite of the fact that\r\nmany other palatable and wholesome vegetable oils have been produced\r\nwhich, while not inferior in nutritive value to olive oil, are so very\r\nmuch cheaper that unless the olive oil possessed peculiar properties\r\nit would be forced out of the market. Its delicate flavor, extreme\r\npalatability, high nutritive power, and other general characteristics\r\nhave maintained for it a market against the strongest competition.\r\n\r\nOlive oil is procured from the fruit of the olive tree (_Olea Europæa_\r\nL.), and when it is to be used for edible purposes the method of\r\nextraction is by pressure. When olive oil is used for technical\r\npurposes, such as lubricating and the manufacture of soap, it is\r\nvery commonly secured by extraction with a volatile solvent, such as\r\npetroleum. The olive is very rich in oil, the quantity varying from\r\n40 to 60 percent. The quality of olive oil upon the market varies in\r\na very great degree according to the country from which it comes,\r\nthe degree of maturity of the olive from which the oil is extracted,\r\nthe method of expression employed, and the character of the refining\r\nprocess to which the expressed oil has been subjected. Botanically,\r\nthere are very many varieties of olive trees and thus nature would\r\nimpart to the olive peculiarities due to the origin of the oil itself.\r\nThe environment also has a great deal to do with the character of the\r\nolive and necessarily with the character of the oil produced. The olive\r\ntree flourishes best in semi-arid regions where the rainfall is not\r\nvery abundant and the sunlight is not greatly obscured by clouds and\r\nthe heat is reasonably high. The principal regions, at the present\r\ntime, from which the commercial olive oils are obtained are Spain,\r\nItaly, Greece, southern France, and southern California.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLIVES\r\n\r\n  1. MISSION  2. SEVILLANO\r\n\r\n_From Yearbook, U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, 1897_]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Olive Oil._--By reason of its great value as an edible\r\noil and its high price there is no one of the edible oils which has\r\nbeen subjected to such a systematic and extensive adulteration. By\r\nreason of the resemblance in general character of many of the edible\r\nvegetable oils to olive oil, adulterations of the most extensive\r\ncharacter may be practiced without indicating to the eye any change\r\nin composition. Nearly all the edible vegetable oils have the light\r\namber tint which is characteristic of many grades of olive oil, and the\r\ndifference between the color of the olive oil and other edible oils is\r\nnot greater than the difference between the tints of the various olive\r\noils themselves. The connoisseur of extremely delicate taste is usually\r\nable to distinguish by the taste any given edible oil from olive\r\noil. If, however, any given edible oil be mixed with olive oil in small\r\nproportions not exceeding 25 to 30 percent, even the skilled taster\r\nwill be deceived. In such cases only the chemist who has much skill and\r\npractice is able to detect the adulteration.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration with Cottonseed Oil._--In the United States the principal\r\nadulteration of olive oil is with cottonseed oil. This is an oil which\r\nhas already been described as of high nutritive value and to which no\r\nobjection can be made from any hygienic or dietetic point of view. It\r\nis made in great quantities in the United States, and when subjected to\r\nthe most careful refining processes can be offered to the consumer at\r\na price probably not greater than one-fifth that of high-grade olive\r\noil. It becomes the ideal material with which to adulterate olive oil.\r\nThis adulteration extends often to complete substitution, the oil in\r\nquestion, though represented as olive oil both by the dealer and the\r\nlabel, containing no trace whatever of that substance. Such bare-faced\r\nsubstitution has apparently almost passed away under the quickening\r\nethical sense of the manufacturer and merchant and the character\r\nof the national and state laws. Many of the oils which are used to\r\nadulterate olive oil have a greater specific gravity, hence whenever\r\nthe specific gravity of an olive oil at 15 degrees goes above .917 it\r\nis ground for suspicion of adulteration though by no means a positive\r\nproof. The presence of cottonseed oil in olive oil is easily detected\r\nby the Halphen test, which has already been described. In Europe a\r\nvery common method of adulteration is with sesamé oil, the properties\r\nof which are described below. Peanut oil is also extensively used for\r\nthe same purpose. These two oils are easily detected when mixed with\r\nolive oil. The sesamé oil is distinguished by the color reaction to be\r\ndescribed. Peanut oil is distinguished by the saponification of the\r\noil, separation of the fatty acids, and consequent crystallization\r\nof the arachidic acid, which produces a crystalline form which is\r\nreadily recognized by an expert. Rapeseed oil and poppy-seed oil\r\nare also extensively used as adulterants in Europe, but not very\r\nextensively in this country. Nearly all the oils which are employed in\r\nthe adulteration of olive oil have high iodin numbers, and therefore\r\nwhenever an iodin number is above 89 or 90 it may be regarded as\r\na suspicious circumstance. There are, however, many genuine olive\r\noils which would be condemned as adulterated if this test alone were\r\nemployed. In addition to the oils mentioned, small quantities of castor\r\noil, lard oil, fish oil, and even of petroleum oil, have been found as\r\nadulterants in olive oil. These, however, occur very infrequently, and\r\nit is not likely that they have been employed in this country.\r\n\r\nIf the examination shows that a given sample is free of cottonseed,\r\nsesamé, and peanut oil, and other characteristics in the sample are\r\nthose of olive oil, it may be safely accepted as a pure sample.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Color of Olive Oil._--The color of the freshly expressed olive oil is\r\nusually green or dark from the chlorophyl and other coloring matter\r\nderived from the olive. When refined and ready for commerce the oil\r\nis of a yellowish-green tint usually. Sometimes the oil obtained from\r\nthe first pressing is almost colorless, but as a rule an amber-green\r\ntint is observed in most of the commercial varieties. Lower grade oils\r\nare often decidedly green, but still edible, due to the admixture of\r\nchlorophyl from the green olive employed. The flavor of olive oil\r\nis a pleasant and agreeable one, but differs greatly in oils from\r\ndifferent sources. The further north the oils are produced the less\r\npronounced the flavor and the sweeter the taste. The more southern\r\noils, such as are obtained in the south of Italy and Spain, have a\r\nstronger and more pronounced flavor which, however, is very much prized\r\nby those accustomed to it. Large quantities of olive oil are produced\r\nalso in the French and other possessions in the north of Africa.\r\nThese, however, have a stronger flavor than those produced upon the\r\ncontinent of Europe and are not so highly prized when used alone.\r\nOlive oil is almost free of stearin, being composed chiefly of olein\r\nwith some palmitin. The amount of free acid in olive oil varies with\r\nthe character of the olives employed and the age of the oil. On long\r\nstanding, without becoming rancid, olive oil develops a large quantity\r\nof free acid. It is a common supposition that rancidity in an oil\r\ndepends upon the development of free fatty acid, but this is not the\r\ncase. If an oil be free of rancidity it may contain a large percentage\r\nof free acid without becoming inedible. It is not uncommon to find in\r\nolive oil as high as 3 percent or more of free acid. This is due to\r\nthe fact that in the refining of olive oil alkalies are not usually\r\nemployed, and therefore any free acid which the natural olive possesses\r\nis not neutralized by the alkalies, as is the case in the refining of\r\ncottonseed oil and some other vegetable oils.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Constituents of Olive Oil._--Olive oil consists almost exclusively\r\nof olein and palmitin. There is very little, if any, stearin in the\r\nhighest grade oil. If all the solid fatty acid at ordinary temperature\r\nbe regarded as derived from palmitin, the quantity of palmitin may be\r\nregarded as varying from three to 20 percent, according to the origin\r\nand character of the sample. While the olein and palmitin, therefore,\r\nmay be regarded as the principal constituents of olive oil, there are\r\nothers, also, existing in smaller quantities. The quantity of free\r\nfatty acid varies very greatly in olive oil. It is highly important\r\nthat the oil be separated from the pomace as speedily as possible,\r\nsince any fermentation of the pomace increases the quantity of free\r\nfatty acid. The largest number of high-grade oils contain less than\r\nthree percent of free fatty acid, but a larger quantity, as has been\r\nstated, does not render the oil inedible unless actual fermentation has\r\ntaken place producing rancidity. Rancidity appears to be the result of\r\nthe generation of other acids than oleic, and also aldehyds, formic,\r\nbutyric, acetic, and œnanthylic acids have been found. Olive oil is a\r\ntypical non-drying oil and therefore shows a less rise in temperature\r\nwhen mixed with sulfuric acid than other vegetable oils. The specific\r\ngravity of olive oil at 15 degrees may be placed at the average\r\nfigure of .917. It sometimes falls as low as .912 and rises as high\r\nas .919. It absorbs from 80 to 90 percent of its weight of iodin. In\r\nsome samples the weight of iodin absorbed is less, falling as low as 77\r\npercent, but this is only in very extraordinary cases. Occasionally it\r\ngoes above 90 percent. Probably the number 87 would represent about the\r\nmean percentage of iodin absorbed by most edible oils.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Method of Preparation._--The very finest quality of olive oil is\r\nthat derived from the hand-picked olive. Just as in the preparation\r\nof fruits for the market the very best qualities are carefully picked\r\none by one from the tree, so in the preparation of the highest grade\r\nof oil the olives are picked one by one, only those of uniform\r\nmaturity and character being selected. This specially selected fruit\r\nis pressed cold, and the first running from this pressure collected\r\nseparately is designated in English by the term “virgin oil.” Virgin\r\nolive oil, therefore, ranks the highest in quality. Unfortunately the\r\nuse of the term for commercial purposes has not been restricted to\r\nthe quality of oil to which it actually belongs, and at the present\r\ntime the expression “pure virgin olive oil” which is placed upon the\r\nbottles or containers is no guarantee that this quality of oil is found\r\ntherein. In fact, this expression upon the label has been found in many\r\ninstances of olive oil highly adulterated and belonging to the cheapest\r\ngrade. It would be impossible here to enumerate all the different names\r\nby which olive oil is found upon the market. The consumer has to depend\r\nfor protection upon his knowledge of the character of the dealer and\r\nhereafter, to a greater extent than ever before, he may be protected by\r\nthe application of the pure food laws of the various countries.\r\n\r\nAfter the first pressing from which the best oil is secured the\r\nresulting pomace is removed from the press, heated or mixed with hot\r\nwater, and again subjected to a much higher pressure from which a\r\nsecond quantity of oil is secured, still suitable for edible purposes\r\nbut of a lower quality than that first produced. While the oils which\r\nare obtained in this way are used largely for technical purposes such\r\nas lubricating, soap making, etc., they are not infrequently employed\r\nas edible oils.\r\n\r\nIn the largest establishments for the preparation of olive oil the\r\nkernels are separated from the pulp, but in the smaller works the\r\npulp and kernel are pressed together. Finally the residue from the\r\nsecond pressure may be dried and extracted with bisulfid of carbon or\r\npetroleum ether, by which means practically all the residual oil which\r\nthe cake contains may be secured. Oils extracted in this manner are\r\nwholly unfit for edible purposes and are used or should be used solely\r\nfor technical purposes, among which soap making is perhaps the most\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Olive-kernel Oil._--An oil is extracted from the kernel of the olive\r\nwhich in some respects of physical and chemical properties resembles\r\nolive oil itself. It is usually not considered suitable for edible\r\npurposes. Its taste resembles more that of almond oil than that of\r\nolive oil. Some of this oil is doubtless mixed with olive oil when the\r\npulp and kernel of the olive are pressed together, but the quantity\r\nthus secured is not very great and does not introduce into the\r\nsubstance anything which gives a specific reaction. It is by no means\r\nas high a grade of oil as that expressed from the flesh of the olive\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Peanut Oil.=--Peanut oil is the refined expressed oil of the peanut,\r\nprepared in the manner above described, and is highly valued as a table\r\nor salad oil and, unfortunately, is used very often as an adulterant of\r\nolive oil, the mixture being sold under the name of the more valuable\r\nof its constituents.\r\n\r\nPeanut oil contains arachidic acid, which in combination with\r\nglycerine forms one of the constituents which serves to distinguish it\r\nparticularly from other edible oils. There is no other edible oil which\r\ncontains arachidic acid in sufficient quantities to lead to any mistake\r\nconcerning its relationship to peanut oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Renard’s Test for Peanut Oil as Modified by Tolman._--Place 20\r\ngrams of oil in an Erlenmeyer flask. Saponify with alcoholic potash,\r\nneutralize exactly with dilute acetic acid, using phenolphthalein\r\nas indicator, and wash into a 500 c.c. flask containing a boiling\r\nmixture of 100 c.c. of water and 120 c.c. of a 20 percent lead acetate\r\nsolution. Boil for a minute, and then cool the precipitated soap by\r\nimmersing the flask in water, occasionally giving it a whirling motion\r\nto cause the soap to stick to the sides of the flask. After the flask\r\nhas cooled, the water and excess of lead can be poured off and the soap\r\nwashed with cold water and with 90 percent (by volume) alcohol. Now add\r\n200 c.c. of ether, cork the flask, and allow to stand for some time\r\nuntil the soap is disintegrated, then heat on the water bath, using a\r\nreflux condenser, and boil for about five minutes. In the oils most\r\nof the soap will be dissolved, while in lards, which contain so much\r\nstearin, part will be left undissolved. Cool the ether solution of soap\r\ndown to from 15° to 17° C., and let stand until all the insoluble soaps\r\nhave crystallized out--about twelve hours are required.\r\n\r\nFilter and thoroughly wash the precipitate with ether. Save the\r\nfiltrate for the determination of the iodin number of the liquid fatty\r\nacids by the Muter method. The soaps on the filter are washed back into\r\nthe flask by means of a stream of hot water acidified with hydrochloric\r\nacid. Add an excess of dilute hydrochloric acid, partially fill the\r\nflask with hot water, and heat until fatty acids form a clear, oily\r\nlayer. Fill the flask with hot water, allow the fatty acids to harden\r\nand separate from the precipitated lead chlorid; wash, drain, repeat\r\nwashing with hot water, and dissolve the fatty acids in 100 c.c. of\r\nboiling 90 percent (by volume) alcohol. Cool down to 15° C., shaking\r\nthoroughly to aid crystallization. From 5 to 10 percent of peanut oil\r\ncan be detected by this method, as it effects a complete separation\r\nof the soluble acid from the insoluble, which interferes with the\r\ncrystallization of the arachidic acid. Filter, wash the precipitate\r\ntwice with 10 c.c. of 90 percent (by volume) alcohol, and then with\r\nalcohol of 70 percent (by volume). Dissolve off the filter with boiling\r\nabsolute alcohol, evaporate to dryness in a weighed dish, dry and\r\nweigh. Add to this weight 0.0025 gram for each 10 c.c. of 90 percent\r\nalcohol used in the crystallization and washing if done at 15° C.;\r\nif done at 20°, 0.0045 gram for each 10 c.c. The melting point of\r\narachidic acid obtained in this way is between 71° and 72° C. Twenty\r\ntimes the weight of arachidic acid will give the approximate amount\r\nof peanut oil present. No examination for adulterants in olive oil is\r\ncomplete without making the test for peanut oil.\r\n\r\nThe above process to be of any particular value can only be carried\r\nout by an experienced chemist, but the presence of peanut oil may be\r\nreadily determined by any one who is experienced by following out the\r\nabove process.\r\n\r\nWhere only small quantities of peanut oil are concerned, namely, not to\r\nexceed five percent, even in the hands of an experienced chemist, the\r\nabove process may not lead to certain results.\r\n\r\nPeanut oil is obtained from the peanut by the ordinary method of\r\nhydraulic pressure. The first cold pressing furnishes the oil of finest\r\ncharacter for edible purposes. Subsequent pressures or pressure with\r\nheat furnish an additional supply or a great quantity of oil but not\r\nof the same palatability. Peanut oil is highly prized as a salad oil\r\neither alone or mixed with other oil, notably olive oil and sesamé.\r\nThe oil is purified by a large settle and by filtration and by the\r\nprocesses usually practiced with other oils of vegetable origin. The\r\noil is easily and completely digested and furnishes an abundant source\r\nof heat and energy to the system. The number of calories produced by\r\nthe combustion of one gram of oil, either by ordinary burning or by\r\noxidation in the body is about 9,300.\r\n\r\nThe cake which is left after the pressing out of the oil is very highly\r\nnutritious, containing still considerable quantities of oil, the whole\r\nof the protein matter, and other digestible solids of the nut.\r\n\r\nAs before stated, it is extensively used as cattle food and as\r\nfertilizer. It may also be ground to a meal and used as human food, but\r\nfurnishes an unbalanced ration in which the protein is far in excess.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Rape Oil= (=Colza Oil=) (_Brassica campestris_ L.).--There are\r\ndifferent kinds of oil which belong to the general class which is\r\nknown as rape oil or rapeseed oil. The different kinds are derived\r\nfrom different varieties of _Brassica campestris_. The English names\r\nof the three most important varieties are--(1) colza oil, derived from\r\nthe seeds of _Brassica campestris_; (2) rape oil, derived from the\r\nseeds of _Brassica napus_ L.; (3) rübsen oil, derived from the seeds\r\nof _Brassica rapa_ L. The character of the oil also varies according\r\nto the manner of its extraction. The first pressings from the cold\r\npowdered seeds is of a finer quality for salad purposes than the\r\nheavier later pressings from the hot seeds. The oil is also sometimes\r\nchilled and the crystallized stearin separated in order to keep it in\r\na liquid state during the winter time, so that the winter and summer\r\nvarieties are sometimes recognized in trade. There is, however, no\r\ndifference in the other characteristics of the oil.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity of rape oil at 15.5 degrees C., compared with\r\nwater at the same temperature, is about .916. The variations from this\r\nmean number are not very great. Rapeseed oil absorbs almost its exact\r\nweight of iodin,--the average iodin number being not far from 99.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Chief Adulterations of Rape Oil._--The chief adulteration of rape\r\noil consists in the admixture of cheaper or flavoring oils. Among\r\nthose which are often used in the adulteration of rape oil are linseed\r\noil, hempseed oil, poppy-seed oil, chamomile oil, cottonseed oil, the\r\nvarious mustard oils, refined fish and blubber oils, rosin oil, and\r\nparaffin. Some of these adulterations, it is seen, cannot be added to\r\nrapeseed oil when used for edible purposes. The chief adulteration of\r\nrapeseed oil, when intended for edible purposes, is the addition of\r\ncottonseed oil. The detection of these various adulterations, with the\r\nexception of that of cottonseed oil, can be accomplished only by an\r\nexpert chemist. The presence of cottonseed oil can be detected by the\r\napplication of the Halphen test already described.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Technique of Extraction._--The extraction of oil from the rape\r\nseed is not different from that of other oily seeds. It is either\r\nextracted by pressure, which is the proper way always when it is to\r\nbe used for edible purposes, or when used for technical purposes it\r\nmay be extracted by means of carbon bisulfid or petroleum ether. When\r\nextracted by pressure for edible purposes the oil should be refined\r\nby a similar treatment to that applied to cottonseed oil and finally\r\nfiltered, preferably after mixing with fuller’s earth or other similar\r\nmaterial, in order that it may be perfectly pure and bright and free\r\nfrom suspended matter which interferes with its utility as an edible\r\noil.\r\n\r\nA very common treatment of the expressed oil, in order to coagulate and\r\nseparate the mucilaginous matter which it contains, is with sulfuric\r\nacid. This acid has the very valuable property of coagulating this\r\nclass of bodies. When treated with sulfuric acid it is necessary that\r\nthe oil be thoroughly washed many times in pure water in order to\r\nremove the last trace of the acid.\r\n\r\nThe residue or oil cake is prized as a cattle food or as a fertilizer.\r\nThe average content of oil in rape seed is about 37 percent.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sesamé Oil.=--Sesamé oil is very commonly used for salad oil and for\r\nthe other purposes to which the edible oils are devoted. It is also\r\nknown as gingili oil and teel oil. Sesamé oil is obtained by pressure\r\nfrom the seed of the sesame plant,--_Sesamum orientale_ L.\r\n\r\nSesamé oil possesses a light amber color when properly made, is free\r\nfrom any unpleasant odor, has an agreeable taste, and when expressed\r\ncold produces what is known as the cold-drawn oil which is regarded\r\nby many as of equal palatable value with olive oil. Sesamé oil, in\r\naddition to containing stearin, palmitin, and olein, also contains\r\na small quantity of a glycerid which exists in large quantities in\r\nflaxseed oil, namely, linolein. When prepared for edible purposes it\r\ncontains only a small quantity of free acid, is free from rancidity,\r\nclear, and brilliant in appearance and has a sweet agreeable taste. The\r\nspecific gravity of sesamé oil at 15 degrees C. varies from .9225 to\r\n.9237. It absorbs from 103 to 108 percent of its weight of iodin and\r\nhas a refractive index at 15 degrees of about 1.4748.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Sesamé Oil._--Some of the other vegetable oils are\r\ncheaper than sesamé and are added to it for the purpose of adulteration\r\nand cheapening the product. Among the most common oils used for the\r\nadulteration of sesamé are poppyseed oil, cottonseed oil, and rape oil.\r\nThe presence of cottonseed oil in sesamé oil is easily distinguished\r\nby the Halphen test already given. The presence of poppyseed oil is\r\nrevealed by the high iodin number and the high degree of heat produced\r\nwhen mixed with sulfuric acid.\r\n\r\nOnly the best variety of cold-drawn sesamé oil is used for edible\r\npurposes and for making oleomargarine. The inferior qualities are used\r\nin soap making, the making of perfumes, etc., and the lowest quality of\r\noil is used for burning purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Characteristic Reaction._--A test which is known as Baudouin’s is\r\nextremely delicate and reliable and is easily applied. It consists in\r\nthe development of a red color when a small quantity of sesamé oil is\r\ntreated with hydrochloric acid in the presence of furfural. The test\r\nis easily carried out as follows: Place a few drops of a two percent\r\nsolution of furfural in a test-tube with 10 cubic centimeters of sesamé\r\noil or the oil to be tested for sesamé and 10 cubic centimeters of\r\nhydrochloric acid of 1.19 specific gravity, and shake the mixture well\r\nfor half a minute. When the tube is left at rest, if sesamé oil be\r\npresent the aqueous acid layer which forms will have a distinct crimson\r\ncolor. Any coloration which is produced by other oils is entirely\r\ndistinct from this one and therefore can be easily distinguished.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geographical Distribution._--The sesamé plant is grown chiefly for\r\ncommercial purposes in India, China, Japan, and West Africa. The\r\ntechnical preparation of the oil, in so far as is known, is not\r\npracticed in the United States. It is pressed and prepared for commerce\r\nchiefly in France. The seeds are rich in oil, yielding a larger\r\npercentage by pressure or extraction than most of the oil-bearing seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sunflower Oil.=--The oil extracted from the seed of the sunflower is\r\nof high quality for edible purposes. Although not in general use in\r\nthis country, it is very extensively used in Russia and some other\r\nparts of Europe. There is every reason to believe that a profitable\r\nindustry could be established in the preparation of edible oils from\r\nsunflower seeds. The plant grows in the greatest luxuriance in nearly\r\nall parts of the country, and the yield is sufficiently great to make\r\nit an object of more interest to our agricultural population than it is\r\nat the present time.\r\n\r\nThe oil is obtained from the seed of the sunflower (_Helianthus annuus_\r\nL.). It is of a pure amber tint with an agreeable odor and pleasant\r\ntaste. As has already been said it is grown largely in Russia and\r\nalso in Indo-China. The seeds are very rich in oil. Before expression\r\nthe hulls should be removed, since these form a porous substance, and\r\nif the seeds are crushed with the hulls large quantities of oil are\r\nabsorbed and cannot be recovered.\r\n\r\nThe method of preparation is the same as that for other edible\r\noils, the kernel, after the removal of the hull, being ground and\r\ncold-pressed for the highest grade. By heating and renewing pressure\r\nlower grades of oil are secured suitable for soap making. Where all\r\nthe oil is required the extraction with bisulfid of carbon or gasoline\r\nis advised. Such oils, however, are not suitable for edible purposes\r\nbecause of the difficulty of removing the last traces of the solvent.\r\nThe specific gravity of sunflower oil at 15 degrees is approximately\r\n.925. It absorbs a very high percentage of iodin, and in this respect\r\nit may be classified with the drying oils. Its iodin number ranges from\r\n120 to 130. No specific color reactions have been established by means\r\nof which sunflower oil may be readily distinguished from the other\r\nedible oils.\r\n\r\nIn fact sunflower oil has not been subjected, by any means, to as\r\ncritical a study as many other vegetable oils.\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE FATS.\r\n\r\nThe fatty principles in vegetables which are solid at ordinary\r\ntemperatures are commonly termed fats instead of oils. They present,\r\nas a rule, a soft mass, usually of an amber tint and somewhat of the\r\nconsistence of butter. Only a few of these solid fats or semi-solid\r\nfats are used for food. Among them the most important are palm-nut oil\r\nor coconut oil or fat, though the fat of the cacao also may be regarded\r\nas belonging to this group. These solid or semi-solid fats are used to\r\na considerable extent for edible purposes in many parts of the world.\r\nCoconut fat and cacao fat are used very extensively in this country\r\neither in a pure state or in chocolate or cocoa.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cacao Butter.=--Cacao butter is the semi-solid fat obtained by\r\npressure from cacao beans, the seeds of the cacao tree (_Theobroma\r\ncacao_ L.). These beans are extremely rich in fat, the content of which\r\nvaries from 35 to 50 percent. On a large scale the cacao beans are\r\nroasted, ground, and the fat expressed while still hot by hydraulic\r\npressure. In order to remove the free acid which it contains the\r\ncarbonates of the alkalies are mixed with the material after grinding\r\nand before extraction. In these cases the expressed fat naturally does\r\nnot contain any free acid, though the soaps which are formed by this\r\nprocess are apt to contaminate the expressed fat.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulterations._--By reason of its high price cacao butter is often\r\nadulterated by the addition of various fats usually of a vegetable\r\ncharacter. Those most generally employed are the stearin derived from\r\nthe coconut fat and the palm-nut fat. The addition of ordinary edible\r\nvegetable oils is easily detected by the usual chemical tests and\r\nis especially recognized by the increase in the percentage of iodin\r\nabsorbed. They also reduce the melting point of cacao butter, and for\r\nthis reason these oils, with the exception of coconut, are not used\r\nvery extensively as adulterants. Beeswax and paraffine wax are also\r\nused to some extent as adulterants, and when used in connection with\r\nvegetable oils they serve to keep the melting point from going too\r\nlow. Tallow has also been used quite extensively as an adulterant. The\r\ndetection of these adulterants is so difficult as to be accomplished\r\nonly by a skilled chemist.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition._--Cacao butter is composed chiefly of stearin and\r\npalmitin, though other fats and oils are present in small quantities.\r\nAlthough it is generally supposed that cacao butter does not tend to\r\nbecome rancid, this is a mistake, since, when exposed to the conditions\r\nwhich favor rancidity, the fermentation which produces this condition\r\ntakes place in the butter, though somewhat more slowly and more\r\nincompletely than in many other fats. The specific gravity of cacao\r\nbutter at 50 degrees C. is .892. It absorbs about 35 percent of its\r\nweight of iodin. It has a much lower melting point than palm fats and\r\neven lower than butter. Its melting point varies from 30 to 33 degrees\r\nC. Cacao butter has some of the properties of ordinary butter and has\r\nbeen recommended as a substitute therefor, but it is not likely that it\r\nwill ever come into common use both because it is less desirable than\r\nbutter and also because of its high price.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Properties._--Cacao butter has a light amber tint and tends to become\r\nbleached on long standing. It has a very pleasant flavor, reminding\r\none of the flavor of the preparations of chocolate. At ordinary\r\ntemperature, 70 degrees F., it is quite solid and sometimes even\r\nbrittle.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Coconut Oil or Butter.=--This is a very abundant natural fat and is\r\nobtained from the kernel of the coconut, especially the two species\r\n_Cocos nucifera_ L. and _Cocos butyracea_ L. At ordinary temperature\r\ncoconut oil is of the consistency of fat. Its taste is pleasant, and it\r\npossesses an odor which is not disagreeable or undesirable. It differs\r\nfrom cacao butter in the ease with which it becomes rancid, at which\r\ntime it takes on a very disagreeable flavor and taste. The coconut\r\noil of commerce is distinguished by different names, according to the\r\ncountry in which it is made.\r\n\r\nCochin oil is a variety which is regarded as of the finest quality,\r\nbeing almost colorless, and is prepared in Malabar.\r\n\r\nCeylon oil is another very important variety made in the neighborhood\r\nof and imported from Ceylon. It is regarded as of somewhat inferior\r\nvariety to Cochin oil, due probably to less care taken in the\r\ncultivation of the plant and the preparation of the oil.\r\n\r\nAnother variety of coconut oil is known as copra oil. The term “copra”\r\nis applied to the sun-dried or kiln-dried kernel of the coconut. In\r\nthis dried state the fruit can be shipped in bulk and large quantities\r\nof it can be sent to Europe or other countries, where the oil is either\r\nobtained by extraction or by compression in a hydraulic press. This is\r\nregarded as of the least desirable quality.\r\n\r\nCoconut oil resembles palm-nut oil in its chemical composition,\r\nwith the exception of the relative proportion of palmitic acid. The\r\nspecific gravity of coconut oil or fat at 40 degrees C. is about .912\r\nand reduced to 15 degrees C. about .925. Coconut oil absorbs very\r\nlittle iodin, which is one of its principal characteristic chemical\r\nproperties. The quantity of iodin absorbed may be taken as about eight\r\npercent of the weight of the oil. Coconut oil is one of the vegetable\r\nfats which resembles butter to some extent in the high content of\r\nvolatile acid which it contains. If, under given conditions, butter\r\nmay be regarded as having a volatile acid number of 27, coconut oil\r\nwill have upon the same scale a volatile acid number of about 7,\r\nwhereas ordinary vegetable oils and fats will have less than 0.5 on\r\na similar scale. Coconut oil may be regarded as the one edible oil\r\nwhich approximates in constitution ordinary butter. Coconut oil has\r\nbeen used very extensively as an adulterant for oleomargarine, since\r\nby reason of its high volatile acid it brings that substance much\r\nnearer to the composition of butter or indicates a larger percentage of\r\nbutter therein than is actually present. While it is used extensively\r\nas human food its principal value is for soap making. It appears as an\r\nedible fat under various names, such as “vegetable butter,” “lactine,”\r\n“nucoline,” “palmin,” etc. Coconut oil is also very extensively used in\r\nthe manufacture of candies and confections.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulterations._--Coconut oil is rarely adulterated. About the\r\nonly adulteration of any consequence is that of the admixture with\r\npalm-kernel oil, which has properties very much like that of coconut\r\noil. These two oils are ordinarily about the same price and therefore\r\nthere is no inducement to practice adulteration.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Palm Oil or Fat.=--This oil is obtained from the fleshy part of the\r\nfruit of the palm tree _Elæis Guineensis_ Jacq. and _Elæis melanococca_\r\nGaertn. Extensive groves of these trees are found in Africa and also\r\nin the Philippines. In Africa they grow particularly upon the western\r\ncoast. There is a large number of varieties of palm trees that afford\r\nthis fat, but the two mentioned are the principal ones. This fat\r\nbecomes solid at about the temperature of the body. It has a somewhat\r\nhigher melting point than butter, which becomes liquid at a temperature\r\nof from 34 to 36 degrees C. When once solid the fat may be heated to\r\n41 or 42 degrees before it again becomes liquid. Palm oil has rather a\r\npleasant taste and is regarded as an edible fat of high quality, and\r\nis largely used as such by Europeans and in Africa and other countries\r\nwhere the fat is produced. The fat also has a very pleasant odor which\r\nis said to resemble somewhat that of violets. This pleasant odor is\r\nquite persistent and remains even in the fatty acids after they have\r\nbeen converted into soap. Palm oil is manufactured in the crudest\r\npossible way by the natives, and immense quantities are lost for this\r\nreason. By reason of this crude method, which leaves the oil in contact\r\nwith the putrescible matter, palm oil often comes into the market in\r\na rancid state or at least with a high content of free fatty acid.\r\nAppreciable quantities of water are also found in the crude article.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the natural color of palm oil is somewhat too deep for\r\nthe taste of the ordinary consumer, ranging from yellow to a dirty\r\nred color, it is often bleached in the refining process before being\r\nsent into commerce. Ordinary exposure to the air tends to bleach this\r\noil, due probably to the bleaching properties which the air sometimes\r\npossesses. Ozone is also employed as a bleaching agent. The bichromate\r\nprocess of bleaching palm oil is very commonly practiced. By this\r\nmethod the oil is freed from its principal impurities and treated with\r\nfrom one to three percent of potassium bichromate and with hydrochloric\r\nacid which decomposes the “chrome” liquor, and in the chemical process\r\nwhich attends this reaction decided bleaching effects are produced. The\r\nbleaching agents are withdrawn and the oil thoroughly washed with water\r\nuntil all traces of chromate and mineral acid are removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulterations._--On account of its great cheapness and the fact that\r\nthe admixture of other oils of lower melting point would detract\r\nfrom its value, palm oil has not been subjected to any extensive\r\nadulteration. The most common adulterations are the impurities which\r\nare left in the oil in the slovenly method of manufacture employed by\r\nthe natives of Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Constituents._--As would be expected from the name, one of the chief\r\nconstituents of palm oil is palmitin. If palm oil is saponified and\r\nthe solid separated from the liquid fatty acid, the former is found to\r\nconsist almost exclusively of palmitic acid. The specific gravity of\r\npalm oil is taken at a high temperature, as much as 50 degrees C. or\r\nabove. The specific gravity at this temperature is about .893. Palm oil\r\nabsorbs a little over one half its weight of iodin. The average iodin\r\nnumber may be regarded as varying from 53 to 55. Aside from the limited\r\nuse of palm oil for human food it is used chiefly in the manufacture\r\nof soap and of candles. It is also used extensively in the tin plate\r\nindustry to spread over the hot iron surface to preserve it from\r\noxidation until it is dipped into the bath of melted tin.\r\n\r\n\r\nNUTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Acorn.=--Many varieties of acorns are used for human food. All\r\nof the nuts of the oak family are edible, but some of the larger and\r\nmore common varieties contain such a quantity of tannin as to be rather\r\nbitter to the taste. The wild acorns were formerly utilized very\r\nextensively for the fattening of swine, producing an article of pork of\r\nhigh palatable value but with the production of a fat of a low melting\r\npoint, unsuitable for the manufacture of lard for summer use. The term\r\napplied to the natural nuts eaten by swine for this purpose is “mast,”\r\nand formerly “mast-fed” pork was an extensive article of commerce. The\r\ndisappearance of the oak and beech forests, however, have practically\r\neliminated this variety of pork from the markets, at least to any\r\nextent which can be called commercial.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Acorn._--Edible portion, 64.4; refuse, 35.6.\r\n\r\n                       EDIBLE PORTION.\r\n  Water,                 4.1 percent\r\n  Protein,               8.1    „\r\n  Fat,                  37.4    „\r\n  Starch and sugar,     48.0    „\r\n  Ash,                   2.4    „\r\n  Calories per pound,  2,718\r\n\r\nThe acorn resembles the chestnut in its composition, containing more\r\ncarbohydrates than fat. It is therefore not an oily seed, but one of a\r\nfarinaceous character.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Almonds.=--There are two species of almond trees, the _Amygdalus\r\ncommunis_, which is the common or sweet almond, and the _Amygdalus\r\namara_, or the bitter almond which flourishes very extensively in\r\nthe south of Europe. California has a climate which, with artificial\r\nirrigation, is favorable to the growth of the almond, and practically\r\nall that are produced in the United States for commercial purposes grow\r\nin that state. It is also cultivated extensively in France, Italy, and\r\nSpain, large supplies of the almonds of commerce coming from those\r\nlocalities. The almond is delicious when eaten in the green state, that\r\nis when the seed is fully formed but before the hull is hardened. It is\r\nrarely eaten in this condition in the United States, but forms a common\r\narticle of diet upon the table of the Europeans in the early summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Almond._--\r\n\r\n  -------------------+-------+--------+------+---------+------\r\n                     |       |        |      |  TOTAL  |\r\n                     |       |        |      | CARBO-  |\r\n                     |WATER. |PROTEIN.|FAT.  |HYDRATES.| ASH.\r\n  -------------------+-------+--------+------+---------+------\r\n                     | _Per- |  _Per- |_Per- |  _Per-  |_Per-\r\n  Edible portion:    | cent._|  cent._|cent._|  cent._ |cent._\r\n  California almonds,| 4.8   |  21.0  |54.9  |  17.3   |2.0\r\n  European almonds,  | 6.0   |  23.5  |53.0  |  14.4   |3.1\r\n  -------------------+-------+--------+------+---------+------\r\n\r\nIn the United States the almond is eaten very extensively, often\r\nroasted and salted. In this condition it is found as a relish in many\r\nmenus. The roasting improves to a certain extent the flavor of the\r\nnut, but the quantity of salt which is used is not always beneficial,\r\ninasmuch as an abundance of salt is eaten with other portions of\r\nthe food. One of the most valued varieties is the Jordan almond,\r\nillustrated in the accompanying colored plate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JORDAN ALMOND\r\n\r\n\r\n_From Yearbook, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, 1902_]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Beechnuts.=--The beech tree is a very common forest tree throughout\r\nthe northern part of the United States. Formerly immense areas in\r\nsouthern Ohio and Indiana were covered almost exclusively by the beech\r\ntree (_Fagus americana_ Sweet). The beechnut is triangular in shape,\r\nresembling buckwheat, and formerly was produced in immense quantities\r\nover the region mentioned above. In the early days it was the principal\r\nfood for swine. The hogs which are fattened by eating the beechnut and\r\nacorn produce a species of pork of a peculiar and very highly prized\r\nflavor. The celebrated hams and bacons of the southern Appalachian\r\nranges were produced from the variety of hogs known as razor-backs\r\nfattened on mast, namely, the chestnut, beechnut, and acorn. The\r\nbeechnut is also one of the principal winter foods of the squirrel and\r\nother animals which store their food for winter use. In the cutting of\r\nthe forests in the winter often large stores of beechnuts are found\r\nstored away by squirrels and birds. The beechnut is not very abundant\r\nupon the markets of the country, but is eaten very largely by those who\r\nlive in the vicinity of beech woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Beechnut._--\r\n\r\n  -------------------+-------+------+------+------+-------+------+------\r\n                     |       |      |      |      | TOTAL |      |\r\n                     |       |      |      |      | CARBO-|      |\r\n                     |       |      | PRO- |      |  HY-  |      | CALO-\r\n                     |REFUSE.|WATER.| TEIN.| FAT. |DRATES.| ASH. | RIES.\r\n  -------------------+-------+------+------+------+-------+------+------\r\n                     | _Per- |_Per- |_Per- |_Per- | _Per- |_Per- |_Per\r\n  _Fagus Americana:_ | cent._|cent._|cent._|cent._| cent._|cent._|pound_\r\n    Edible portion,  |  .... |  4.0 | 21.9 | 57.4 |  12.2 |  3.5 | 3,263\r\n    As purchased,    |  40.8 |  2.3 | 13.0 | 34.0 |   7.8 |  2.1 | 1,932\r\n  _Fagus sylvestris:_|       |      |      |      |       |      |\r\n    Edible portion,  |  .... |  9.1 | 21.7 | 42.4 |  22.9 |  3.9 | ....\r\n    As purchased,    |  33.0 |  6.1 | 14.5 | 28.4 |  15.4 |  2.6 | ....\r\n  -------------------+-------+------+------+------+-------+------+------\r\n\r\n\r\n=Brazil-nut= (_Bertholletia excelsa_ Humb. and Bonpl.).--Large\r\nquantities of this nut are imported into the United States from Brazil\r\nand form an important article of food in many localities. This nut is\r\nnot grown in the United States. It is also known as cream nut. The nut\r\nis triangular in shape and has a dark brown rough exterior. The kernel\r\nis highly flavored and quite oily. The tree is so sensitive to the cold\r\nthat it will not grow successfully even in southern Florida, although\r\nmany attempts have been made to introduce it into that locality.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Brazil-nut._--Edible portion, 50.4; refuse, 49.6.\r\n\r\n  ---------------+-------+------+------+------+-------+------+------\r\n                 |       |      |      |      | TOTAL |      |\r\n                 |       |      |      |      | CARBO-|      |\r\n                 |       |      | PRO- |      |  HY-  |      | CALO-\r\n                 |REFUSE.|WATER.| TEIN.| FAT. |DRATES.| ASH. | RIES.\r\n  ---------------+-------+------+------+------+-------+------+------\r\n                 | _Per- |_Per- |_Per- |_Per- | _Per- |_Per- |_Per\r\n                 | cent._|cent._|cent._|cent._| cent._|cent._|pound_\r\n  Edible portion,|  .... |  5.3 | 17.0 | 66.8 |   7.0 |  3.9 | 3,329\r\n  As purchased,  |  49.6 |  2.7 |  8.6 | 33.6 |   3.5 |  2.0 | 1,678\r\n  ---------------+-------+------+------+------+-------+------+------\r\n\r\n\r\n=Butternut= (_Juglans cinerea_ L.).--The butternut is another variety\r\nof walnut which grows very extensively in the United States and has\r\nthe same geographical distribution as the walnut, except that the\r\nbutternut is not so common west of the Mississippi. The tree does not\r\ngrow so large as the walnut tree, nor is its wood so highly valued for\r\ncommercial purposes. While the walnut is a round nut the butternut is\r\nvery much elongated, forming an oval-shaped nut which is very highly\r\nvalued as a food. The coloring matter of the butternut is practically\r\nthe same as that of the walnut. The butternut also has a fleshy outer\r\ncovering not so thick as that of the walnut and which is removed in the\r\nsame way in the harvesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Dry Butternut._--\r\n\r\n                EDIBLE PORTION.

Bork).--The chestnut tree\r\ngrows in great abundance wild in the United States, especially in the\r\neastern portion on the foothills of the Alleghanies. In some localities\r\nit originally formed vast forests. The value of the timber and the fact\r\nthat the chestnut grows only on good soil were prominent factors in the\r\ndestruction of many of the original forests, especially those covering\r\nthe arable lands. The trees still grow in great abundance, especially\r\nin the hilly regions.\r\n\r\nIn France the chestnut is very widely grown, and the nut is used very\r\nextensively as food by the poor classes. The nuts are often dried and\r\nground to a flour which is mixed with water and baked in thin sheets,\r\nforming a very heavy but a sweet and nutritious cake. The chestnut is\r\nused in the preparation of many dishes, prized even by those in easy\r\ncircumstances. In Italy the chestnut is also widely cultivated, and\r\nthe nut is ground to form a kind of porridge known as polenta which is\r\nvery extensively used as food. In the Apennines a cake made of chestnut\r\nflour and baked on hot stones is used under the name of necci. In Corea\r\nthe chestnut is said to be a very extensive article of food, taking\r\nthe place of the potato. It is eaten raw, boiled, roasted, or cooked\r\nwith meats. The chestnut differs from the oily nuts in the smaller\r\nproportion of fat and the very much larger proportion of sugar and\r\nstarch,--in fact, starch is almost missing in some of the oily nuts,\r\nthe carbohydrates present in the very oily being chiefly sugars. In\r\nthe chestnut the starch is more abundant than the sugar, and for this\r\nreason the chestnut meal is more like the meal of the ordinary cereal\r\nthan that of the oily seeds. The chestnut, also, as it is gathered\r\nfresh contains a great deal more water than the ordinary fresh seeds,\r\nthe quantity ranging from 40 to 50 percent.\r\n\r\nThe average composition of the fresh chestnut, edible portion, is\r\nrepresented by the following data:\r\n\r\n  Water,             42.7 percent\r\n  Protein,            6.5    „\r\n  Fat,                6.3    „\r\n  Starch and sugar,  43.1    „\r\n  Ash,                1.4    „\r\n\r\nThe dried chestnuts, that is, those which have been kept for several\r\nmonths or which have been artificially dried, have a composition\r\nrepresented by the following data:\r\n\r\n  Water,              4.8 percent\r\n  Protein,           11.6    „\r\n  Fat,               15.3    „\r\n  Sugar and starch,  65.7    „\r\n  Ash,                2.6    „\r\n\r\nThe average weight of the hull of the chestnut is 15.9 percent of the\r\ntotal weight of the fresh nut, and 23.4 percent of the average weight\r\nof the dried nut. The above data are confirmatory of the statement that\r\nthe meal of the chestnut in its composition is very much like that\r\nof the oily cereals, for instance, of Indian corn meal or oats. It,\r\nhowever, contains more oil and less protein than the cereals referred\r\nto. It is readily seen from the above data that chestnut meal may not\r\nproperly take the place of Indian corn as human food. The nut of the\r\nchestnut tree ripens at the time of frost.\r\n\r\nThe wild chestnut shrub, which springs up in great numbers where the\r\noriginal trees are cut away, is now extensively grafted with cultivated\r\nvarieties. In Pennsylvania there are large orchards of the Paragon\r\nchestnut which have been grown in this manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Chinese Nut= (_Nephelium litchi_ Cambess.).--This is not a true nut\r\nin the ordinary sense of the word, but is usually classed with nuts.\r\nIt is a product of China and is imported into the United States for\r\nconsumption by our Chinese population. In the fresh state in China it\r\nhas the reputation of being one of the best fruit products of that\r\ncountry, having flesh of a white color and a flavor resembling that of\r\nhigh-grade grapes. 41.6 percent of the fresh nut is refuse matter. The\r\nedible portion has the following composition:\r\n\r\n  Water,                17.9 percent\r\n  Protein,               2.9    „\r\n  Fat,                    .2    „\r\n  Starch and sugar,     77.5    „\r\n  Ash,                   1.5    „\r\n  Calories per pound,  1,453\r\n\r\nThe above data show that in chemical composition the Chinese nut does\r\nnot belong to the class of nuts at all. It is a fruit, its nutritive\r\nmaterial being almost exclusively carbohydrates, while in the true nut\r\nthe principal nutritive substances are the protein and the oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Coconut.=--The coconuts which are consumed in the United States are\r\nmostly imported. It is estimated that three hundred thousand coconut\r\ntrees (_Cocos nucifera_ L.) have been planted in Florida, and from 15\r\nto 20 percent of them are already bearing. The common name of the tree\r\nis the coconut palm. The fruit of the coconut palm is used for many\r\npurposes. The immature nuts are often used medicinally, forming the\r\nbase of a valuable ointment for external use. The jelly which lines the\r\nshell of the more mature nut furnishes a food product of great delicacy\r\nand high nutritive value. The milk of the coconut is itself highly\r\nesteemed as a delicious article of food. Grated coconut is one of the\r\nbasic constituents of that familiar condimental substance, East Indian\r\ncurry. Coconut oil is a very highly edible fat from which butter is\r\nmade. The fat itself is valuable for cooking purposes. The composition\r\nof the coconut is shown in the following table:\r\n\r\n  ---------------+-------+------+------+------+-------+------+------\r\n                 |       |      |      |      | TOTAL |      |\r\n                 |       |      |      |      |CARBO- |      |\r\n                 |       |      | PRO- |      |  HY-  |      | CALO-\r\n                 |REFUSE.|WATER.| TEIN.| FAT. |DRATES.| ASH. | RIES.\r\n  ---------------+-------+------+------+------+-------+------+------\r\n                 | _Per- |_Per- |_Per- |_Per- | _Per- |_Per- |_Per\r\n                 | cent._|cent._|cent._|cent._| cent._|cent._|pound_\r\n  Edible portion,|  .... | 14.1 |  5.7 | 50.6 |  27.9 |  1.7 | 2,986\r\n  As purchased,  |  48.8 |  7.2 |  2.9 | 25.9 |  14.3 |   .9 | 1,529\r\n  ---------------+-------+------+------+------+-------+------+------\r\n\r\nThe solid edible portion of the nut is highly oleaginous and contains\r\nalso a considerable quantity of starch and sugar. Coconut milk is much\r\npoorer in nutrients than cow’s milk, containing over 92 percent of\r\nwater, only .4 percent of protein, and only 1.5 percent of fat. The\r\ncarbohydrates contained therein are chiefly sugars.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Filberts.=--The term filbert, according to some etymologists, is a\r\ncorruption of the term “full beard,” and is so named on account of\r\nits having many long beards or husks. The filbert is the fruit of the\r\ncultivated hazel tree (_Corylus avellana_ L.). The nut contains a\r\nkernel having a pleasant taste and is quite oily and nutritious. It is\r\nnot cultivated to any extent in this country where we rely principally\r\nupon the wild hazel for the hazelnut. The composition of the filbert is\r\nshown in the following table (edible portion, 47.9; refuse, 52.1):\r\n\r\n                       EDIBLE PORTION.\r\n  Water,                  3.7 percent\r\n  Protein,               15.6    „\r\n  Fat,                   65.3    „\r\n  Sugar and starch,      13.0    „\r\n  Ash,                    2.4    „\r\n  Calories per pound,   3,432\r\n\r\nThe filbert is produced in large quantities on the Asiatic shore of the\r\nBlack Sea. The region of Trebizond is the most prolific source of the\r\nfilbert.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hazelnut.=--The hazelnut grows on a small tree or large shrub\r\n(_Corylus avellana_ L.). The species which grows wild in the United\r\nStates is known chiefly as _Corylus america_ Walt. It is from this\r\nshrub that the common wild hazelnut is obtained. There is also another\r\nvariety grown in this country, _Corylus rostrata_ Ait. The hazelnut\r\nis a small, nutritious, and palatable nut of a brown color and grows\r\nover a very large area of the United States, especially in the northern\r\npart of the country. It is quite an article of commerce, but is not\r\ncultivated to any great extent. The cultivated variety, as has already\r\nbeen stated, is known as the filbert.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Hazelnut._--\r\n\r\n  ---------------+-------+------+------+------+-------+------+------\r\n                 |       |      |      |      | TOTAL |      |\r\n                 |       |      |      |      |CARBO- |      |\r\n                 |       |      | PRO- |      |  HY-  |      | CALO-\r\n                 |REFUSE.|WATER.| TEIN.| FAT. |DRATES.| ASH. | RIES.\r\n  ---------------+-------+------+------+------+-------+------+------\r\n                 | _Per- |_Per- |_Per- |_Per- | _Per- |_Per- |_Per\r\n                 | cent._|cent._|cent._|cent._| cent._|cent._|pound_\r\n  Edible portion,|  .... |  3.7 | 15.6 | 65.3 |  13.0 |  2.4 | 3,432\r\n  As purchased,  |  52.1 |  1.8 |  7.5 | 31.3 |   6.2 |  1.1 | 1,644\r\n  ---------------+-------+------+------+------+-------+------+------\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hickory-nut.=--The hickory-nut is another one of the nuts which\r\nsometimes is classed with walnuts and grows very extensively wild\r\nthroughout the United States, having the same geological distribution\r\nas the walnut and butternut. The hickory tree (_Hicoria ovata_ (Mill.)\r\nBritton) produces a nut of highest quality. On account of the character\r\nof the bark, which becomes detached and often widely separated from the\r\ntrunk, it is known as the shagbark or shellbark hickory.\r\n\r\nAnother variety of the hickory tree is known as the pignut (_Carya\r\nglabra_). The nut produced by this tree is much less prized than the\r\nother hickories, often containing a sufficient amount of tannin to make\r\nit distinctly bitter. The wood of the hickory is very tough and elastic\r\nand is used extensively in the manufacture of spokes for wagon-wheels,\r\naxe-handles, etc. The young hickory trees grow thickly together and\r\nhave a slender reed-like growth. They are used extensively in the\r\nmanufacture of hoop-poles. The hickory has suffered from the advance\r\nof the farmer much in the same manner as the walnut and other valuable\r\ntimber trees. The original trees have almost entirely disappeared. The\r\nyoung trees grow vigorously and in a few years will bear nuts, and in\r\nsome localities the care and cultivation of the wild tree has been\r\nestablished for the purpose of securing new forests of nut-bearing\r\ntrees. The hickory-nut is even more highly prized for eating purposes\r\nthan the butternut and walnut, but should be eaten under the same\r\nconditions, namely, before the passing of the first winter after their\r\nproduction. They, also, on account of their high content of oil, tend\r\nto become rancid when they are kept through the warm summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Dry Hickory-nut._--Edible portion, 37.8; refuse,\r\n62.2.\r\n\r\n                       EDIBLE PORTION.\r\n  Water,                 3.7 percent\r\n  Protein,              15.4    „\r\n  Fat,                  67.4    „\r\n  Sugar and starch,     11.4    „\r\n  Ash,                   2.1    „\r\n  Calories per pound,  3,495\r\n\r\n\r\n=Peanuts.=--The peanut is a widely cultivated plant. It grows\r\nextensively in the United States, and is especially regarded as a crop\r\nof high value in North Carolina and Virginia. Very large quantities of\r\npeanuts are grown in Senegal, in Algiers, in Egypt, and in many other\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\nThe pod containing the seed grows underground, but is not a part of\r\nthe roots, properly so-called. The pods are attached by slender stems\r\nto the stalk of the peanut. The pod of the peanut matures underground,\r\nand it may, therefore, be regarded as the seed of the plant, entering\r\nand maturing underground. The seeds are immediately covered by a soft\r\nenvelope and then by several similar coverings. For edible purposes\r\nthey are much improved by roasting, which gives them an aromatic, nutty\r\nflavor which is much admired. A striking illustration of the peanut is\r\nshown in the accompanying colored plate.\r\n\r\nPeanuts are used as food both directly, as after roasting, and\r\nindirectly, by the expression of oil, which after proper refining is\r\nconsidered of high value for edible purposes. The oil of the peanut\r\nforms an edible oil of rich flavor, pleasant taste, and high nutritive\r\nvalue. It is used, either alone or mixed with other edible oils,\r\nnotably with olive oil for table purposes and for the making of salad\r\ndressing. The residue of the pressings for peanut oil are highly valued\r\nas a cattle food, containing large quantities of nitrogenous nutriment,\r\nand also as a manure.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the peanut varies greatly in different localities.\r\nIts chief value as a food material lies in the high percentage of\r\nprotein it contains and the high percentage of fat. The composition of\r\nthe typical hulled peanut is shown in the following table:\r\n\r\n  Water,                 9.2 percent\r\n  Protein,              25.8    „\r\n  Fat or oil,           38.6    „\r\n  Sugar, starch, etc.,  24.4    „\r\n  Insoluble cellulose,   2.5    „\r\n  Ash,                   0.9    „\r\n\r\nOnly the blossoms which form on the lower part of the stalk produce\r\nthe fruit, since it is necessary that the long stem should strike\r\nthe earth and the young fruit penetrate to the depth of from five to\r\nsix centimeters in order that the fruit may mature. This method of\r\npenetrating the earth is shown very well in the colored figure already\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PEANUT (ARACHIDE)\r\n\r\n_From Huilleries Calvé-Delft_ (_Holland_)]\r\n\r\nThe original home of the peanut is not definitely known, but is\r\nsupposed to be Africa. It was first described as occurring on the\r\nAmerican continent by Ferdinand de Oviedo in San Domingo in the\r\nbeginning of the 16th century. It is now very generally distributed in\r\nall the tropical countries in South America, Asia, and Africa, and, as\r\nbefore described, grows very well as far north as the northern boundary\r\nof North Carolina and in southern Virginia. Peanuts are used for food\r\nin all the countries mentioned with previous preparation and roasting.\r\n\r\nThe above data show that the peanut is a food product extremely rich in\r\noil and protein and comparatively poor in carbohydrates. For dietetic\r\npurposes it should be eaten with some highly amylaceous substance, such\r\nas potato, rice, or tapioca.\r\n\r\nThe value of the peanut for food purposes is not fully realized in this\r\ncountry, where it is eaten rather as a relish and as an incident to the\r\ncircus or the picnic. In such cases they are usually consumed in too\r\nlarge quantities and by unbalancing the ration may produce unpleasant\r\neffects from which an unreasonable prejudice against this valuable food\r\nproduct might arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Peanut Butter.=--An oily preparation of the peanut or the oil\r\ntherefrom deprived of a part of its stearin is known as peanut butter\r\nand is used as a substitute for ordinary butter. What has been said\r\nof the nutritive value of the oil of the peanut applies also to this\r\nproduct. The butter has the peculiar flavor of the peanut which is\r\nnot agreeable to all persons, though, perhaps, this fact does not\r\nmaterially interfere with the nutritive value of the product. The\r\nnuts are also powdered more or less finely and mixed with other food\r\nproducts. Peanuts which grow in northern Senegambia are regarded very\r\nhighly for the manufacture of fine salad oil, and peanut oil is used\r\nextensively for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Peanut Butter and Peanolia.=--Peanut butter and peanolia are used to\r\na considerable extent in the United States as food products. They are\r\nprepared from peanuts, properly roasted, ground to a fine powder, and\r\nmixed with an appropriate quantity of salt. The analyses of the samples\r\nof these products, made in the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment\r\nStation, show the following composition:\r\n\r\n                   PEANUT BUTTER.  PEANOLIA.\r\n  Water,                2.10          1.98\r\n  Protein,             28.66         29.94\r\n  Fat,                 46.41         46.68\r\n  Sugar and dextrin,    6.13          5.63\r\n  Starch,               6.15          5.58\r\n  Insoluble cellulose,  2.30          2.10\r\n  Common salt,          3.23          4.95\r\n  Ash,                   .80          1.08\r\n\r\nThe above analyses show that the preparations are produced from the\r\nroasted peanuts, which process reduces the water to about 2 percent.\r\nThe ground, roasted product is mixed with about 4 percent of common\r\nsalt. The other constituents are the same as those of the peanuts from\r\nwhich the preparations were made. Of the carbohydrate content of the\r\npeanut about 4 percent has been found to be pentosans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--PECAN TREE, 30 YEARS OLD, MORGAN CITY,\r\nLA.--(_Courtesy of H. E. Van Deman._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Where Peanuts are Grown.=--Virginia is one of the most important of\r\nthe peanut-growing states, especially in its southeastern portion. The\r\nCommissioner of Agriculture of Virginia reports that about one hundred\r\nthousand acres are planted annually in the state of Virginia, producing\r\nover four million bushels. Fifty bushels per acre is considered a good\r\naverage yield. An important point in the production of good peanuts is\r\nthe selection of the seeds. The most vigorous and well formed kernels\r\nare to be selected for planting, and especially those that are produced\r\nby plants of identical size and shape. By a selection of this kind the\r\nquality of the crop can be greatly improved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n           WILD NUT\r\n  RUSSELL            STUART\r\n          =VAN DEMAN=\r\n  FROTSCHER          PABST\r\n\r\nFIG. 59.--FIVE FORMS OF CHOICE, THIN-SHELLED PECANS. ALSO WILD NUT\r\nSHOWING DIFFERENCE IN SIZE.--(_By permission American Nut and Fruit\r\nCo._)]\r\n\r\nOne of the peculiarities of the peanut is that it is an underground\r\nlegume. All other leguminous fruits mature above the soil. Its\r\nunderground habitat is the reason for its botanical name, hypogæa. If\r\nthe stem carrying the small, yellow, butterfly-shaped flowers and which\r\nsprings from the axis of the branch above the ground fails to reach\r\nthe soil no fruit is formed. If the soil is properly cultivated the\r\ngerm may penetrate of its own accord. However, art assists nature in\r\nthis matter and covers up the pods so as to give them a better start.\r\nThe peanut, like some other leguminous crops, develops nodules upon\r\nits roots in which the bacteria that assimilate free nitrogen live in\r\nsymbiotic union with the plant itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pecan-nut= (_Hicoria pecan_ (Marsh.) Britton; _Carya olivæformis_\r\nNuttall).--The pecan is a nut which is very much valued and grows,\r\nwith a most excellent flavor, in the southern part of the United\r\nStates. Texas, Louisiana, southern Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and\r\nFlorida are the principal regions where the pecan grows, although it is\r\ncultivated in some instances much further north.\r\n\r\nThe pecan belongs to the same family as the hickory-nut and is\r\nindigenous to the United States. It grows wild over a large area,\r\nextending from southern Illinois and Indiana to the Gulf. It often\r\nforms very large trees in the forests. There are several species of\r\n_Hicoria_. The fruit of the pecan is especially valued on account of\r\nthe thinness of the shell and its extremely pleasant and aromatic\r\nflavor. As is the case with most nuts, it is composed chiefly of oil\r\nand proteids, the sugar and starch being in minute proportions. The\r\ncomposition of the fruit of the pecan, when divested of its hard shell,\r\nis given in the following table:\r\n\r\n                        EDIBLE PORTION.\r\n  Water,                  2.9 percent\r\n  Protein,               10.3    „\r\n  Fat,                   70.8    „\r\n  Sugar, starch, etc.,   14.3    „\r\n  Ash,                    1.7    „\r\n  Calories per pound,   3,445\r\n\r\nFor marketing purposes the pecans are now largely grown in orchards,\r\nas the supply of the wild nut is uncertain, and its texture and flavor\r\nare not so fine as the cultivated variety. The cultivated variety may\r\nalso be grafted upon the wild tree with good effects. The tree begins\r\nto bear at four or five years of age. A comparative appearance of the\r\nwild and cultivated nut is shown in the accompanying Fig. 59. The tree,\r\nwhen full grown, is handsome in appearance, and is valued as a shade\r\ntree as well as a fruit producer. The full grown tree is shown in the\r\naccompanying Figs. 58 and 60.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pine-nuts.=--In many portions of the western part of our country\r\npine-nuts are consumed largely as food. There are several species of\r\npines yielding edible nuts on the Pacific coast of the United States\r\nand as far east as Colorado and New Mexico. These nuts are articles\r\nof considerable importance in the commerce of many of the cities of\r\nCalifornia. The principal specimens of pine which yield edible nuts\r\nare _Pinus monophylla_ Torr. and Frem., _Pinus edulis_ Engelm., _Pinus\r\nsabiniana_ Dougl. The refuse is usually less than 50 percent of the\r\ntotal weight of the nut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.--FULL GROWN PECAN TREE.--(_By permission Field\r\nColumbian Museum._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Edible Portion._--\r\n\r\n  -----------------+------+--------+----+------+----+--------\r\n                   |      |        |    |STARCH|    |CALORIES\r\n                   |      |        |    |  AND |    |  PER\r\n                   |WATER.|PROTEIN.|FAT.|SUGAR.|ASH.| POUND.\r\n  -----------------+------+--------+----+------+----+--------\r\n  Pinus monophylla,|  3.8 |   6.5  |60.7| 26.2 | 2.8| 3,327\r\n    „   edulis,    |  3.4 |  14.6  |61.9| 17.3 | 2.8| 3,364\r\n    „   sabiniana, |  5.1 |  28.1  |53.7|  8.4 | 4.7| 3,161\r\n  -----------------+------+--------+----+------+----+--------\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pistachio.=--The nut of the pistachio (_Pistachia vera_) is used very\r\nlargely for flavoring purposes and also for food. The tree is a native\r\nof Syria but has been cultivated in southern Europe for many years. The\r\nnut produced in America, though somewhat larger than the native Syrian\r\nfruit, has not half so high a palatable value. The pistachio is grown\r\nto some extent in the southern part of the United States and also in\r\nCalifornia. The kernel of the fruit is green in color and has a flavor\r\nwhich in some respects is reminiscent of almonds. It is used chiefly in\r\nthis country in the manufacture of confectionery and ice creams.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Pistachio._--\r\n\r\n                       EDIBLE PORTION.\r\n  Water,                 4.2 percent\r\n  Protein,              22.3    „\r\n  Fat,                  54.     „\r\n  Starch and sugar,     16.3    „\r\n  Ash,                   3.2    „\r\n  Calories per pound,  3,235\r\n\r\n\r\n=Walnuts= (_Juglans nigra_ L.).--The American walnut grows wild over a\r\nvery large portion of the country, especially the middle section west\r\nof Maryland to the Mississippi river. The walnut tree is especially\r\nabundant along the Ohio river, where it forms in the early summer a\r\ndense foliage. The trees often attain a very great size, reaching a\r\ndiameter as great as five feet.\r\n\r\nThe walnut trees grow only on rich soil, hence, unless the country was\r\nvery hilly and unsuitable for cultivation, the walnut forests were\r\nthe first to fall before the axe of the pioneer. Later the demand for\r\nwalnut lumber completed the devastation of the walnut forests, until\r\nnow very often in the regions where fifty years ago the trees were\r\nextremely abundant a large walnut tree is rarely seen. The walnut\r\nlumber has peculiar lasting powers, and on account of its natural color\r\nand grain is of the highest value for building and ornamental purposes.\r\nThe early farmers in the Ohio valley made their rail fences out of\r\nwalnut trees. The wild nut grows in a dense kernel and is covered with\r\na thick pericarp which is green even at the time when the fruit is\r\nripe. After a frost when the fruit naturally falls from the trees the\r\nouter covering disintegrates. When the nuts are gathered by boys the\r\nouter covering is usually beaten off with clubs. It contains a coloring\r\nmatter of a brown or brownish-black tint which the early housewives\r\nused for dyeing homespun cloth. The bark of the tree also contains\r\nto a greater or less extent the same coloring matter. The kernel of\r\nthe walnut, that is, the edible portion, is extremely rich in oil and\r\nprotein and has a very pleasant taste. Like other nuts the walnut is\r\nbest during its first winter, since on longer keeping the oil tends to\r\nbecome rancid and the fruit unpalatable.\r\n\r\n\r\n=White Walnut= (_Juglans regia_ L.).--The white walnut, commonly known\r\nas the English walnut, is grown very extensively in France. All the\r\ndepartments of south central and southeastern France grow these walnuts\r\nas a valued crop. The best walnut orchards are at an altitude of from\r\n600 to 900 feet. Only the outer or exposed limbs produce perfect\r\nnuts. In planting the most important precaution is to give the trees\r\nplenty of room, 15 yards is about the usual distance at which they\r\nare planted. The trees are cultivated and fertilized with manure and\r\ncommercial fertilizers every two or three years. A bearing orchard\r\nof these white walnuts in France is worth from four to five hundred\r\ndollars per acre and may yield a revenue of from seventy-five to one\r\nhundred dollars a year per acre. The nuts ripen from the middle of\r\nSeptember to the end of October. These nuts are used largely in America\r\nas a food, for which purpose the kernels are carefully extracted in\r\nhalves, commonly known as “walnut halves.” In France an excellent table\r\noil is expressed from the dry nut which for many culinary purposes is\r\nvalued as highly as olive oil. After extraction the oil cake is used\r\nfor stock food. The white walnut is supposed to have been originally\r\nintroduced from Persia, though it is commonly known as the English\r\nwalnut. In the United States the butternut tree is commonly known as\r\nthe white walnut.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the kernel of the dry walnut is shown by the\r\nfollowing data:\r\n\r\nEdible portion:\r\n\r\n  Water,                 2.5 percent\r\n  Protein,              16.6    „\r\n  Fat,                  63.4    „\r\n  Total carbohydrates,  16.1    „\r\n  Ash,                   1.4    „\r\n\r\nAs purchased:\r\n\r\n  Refuse,               58.1 percent\r\n  Water,                 1.0    „\r\n  Protein,               7.0    „\r\n  Fat,                  26.6    „\r\n  Total carbohydrates,   6.7    „\r\n  Ash,                    .6    „\r\n\r\n\r\n=General Discussion.=--A brief description has been given above of\r\nthe principal edible nuts used in the United States, accompanied by\r\na statement of their chemical composition. The character of the food\r\nproducts is well shown by the analytical data. Nuts as a whole are\r\nextremely oily substances and contain next in importance as a food\r\nmaterial, protein. Alone they constitute an unbalanced ration in which\r\nthe fat and protein are abundantly present at the expense of the\r\nstarch and sugar. For this reason an exclusively nut diet cannot be\r\nrecommended, as it surely tends to unbalance the ratio and to disturb\r\nthe digestion in the great majority of cases. There are doubtless\r\nindividuals of a peculiar temperament who can thrive on a diet of nuts\r\nalone, but such a case is exceptional. On the other hand the value of\r\nthe nut as a food is undeniable, both as a nutrient and as a pleasant\r\ncondimental addition to the food. The large percentage of oil in nuts\r\nalso in many cases is beneficial from the well-known effect of oil in\r\npromoting the digestive activities, mechanical and otherwise. Nuts\r\nshould be eaten in as fresh a state as possible, especially those\r\nof a highly oily character. Rancidity not only spoils the taste but\r\ninterferes largely with their dietetic value. On account of the high\r\namount of oil, nuts are preëminently a heat-forming food and thus can\r\nbe eaten very freely by those engaged in vigorous bodily exercise and\r\nduring cold weather. They also form a food especially useful during\r\nperiods of extreme exertion, since by their combustion they furnish\r\nabundant stores of heat and energy.\r\n\r\nMany fads relating to foods flourish in various localities. Among them\r\nthe school of dietetics, which advises a diet solely of nuts, is worthy\r\nof mention. It is true that life can be sustained for an indefinite\r\ntime on a diet of nuts alone. If the nuts are sought in the forests\r\nand fields the good effects of the exercise and outdoor life are to be\r\ntaken into consideration. There is no reason to believe, however, that\r\nthe general condition of mankind, from a dietetic point of view, would\r\nbe improved by an exclusive nut diet. The impossibility of supplying\r\nman with such a food product is also a factor in the discussion of the\r\nproblem that should not be forgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VIII.\r\n\r\nFUNGI AS FOODS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mushrooms.=--Certain fungi growing wild or in cultivated soils and\r\nhaving an expanded top on a hooded stem are known as mushrooms. The\r\ncommon form of mushroom (_Agaricus campestris_ L.) grows wild over\r\na large portion of the United States. It is especially abundant in\r\nthe autumn, growing sometimes during the night after a warm rain,\r\nover large areas. When properly cooked it forms a delicious food and\r\ncondimental substance, highly prized by connoisseurs and others.\r\nBelonging to the family of mushrooms, however, are many poisonous\r\nvarieties which, when eaten inadvertently, often cause serious illness\r\nand sometimes death. For this reason mushrooms sold in the open market\r\nshould be carefully inspected by experts authorized to see that the\r\npoisonous varieties are excluded. It not only requires a good botanist,\r\nbut also one skilled in the practical differentiation of the different\r\nvarieties by physical appearance rather than by botanical analysis, to\r\nproperly separate the poisonous from the edible varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Historical._--Mushrooms have been, since historical times, extensively\r\nused as human food. In a book written five centuries before the\r\nChristian era, Athenée, in his “Banquet of Learned Men,” speaks of the\r\npoisoning of a mother and her three children by mushrooms. Hippocrates\r\nspeaks of a girl who had been poisoned by mushrooms and who was cured\r\nby the administration of hot honey and by a hot bath. Theophrastes\r\nand Nicandre also speak of mushrooms and the poisoning that occurs\r\ntherefrom. Both Cicero and Horace make reference to mushrooms. Horace\r\nadvises that Epicureans should confine themselves to the mushrooms that\r\ngrow upon meadows and refuse to eat all others on account of the danger\r\nfrom poisoning. Ovid also makes frequent allusions to mushrooms and\r\nspeaks of the influence of warm rains upon their growth. Tacitus refers\r\nto the use of mushrooms for food, and Suétonius, in his “History of\r\nthe Twelve Cæsars,” relates that the Emperor Claudius was poisoned by\r\na dish of mushrooms. It is, therefore, evident that from the earliest\r\ntimes mushrooms were extensively used and the poisonous properties of\r\nsome of the varieties understood.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Production of Mushrooms._--As has already been mentioned, mushrooms\r\ngrow wild over a large area of the United States. They are also\r\ncultivated very extensively, though not so extensively here as in\r\nEuropean countries. The best place for growing cultivated mushrooms is\r\none where the light is excluded or diffused and where the temperature\r\nremains reasonably constant. Cellars, caves, and the artificial\r\ncaverns made by quarrying are peculiarly well suited for the growth of\r\ndifferent varieties of fungi, such as mushrooms.\r\n\r\nThe art of growing mushrooms is not easily acquired. The directions\r\ngiven by the best authorities may be rigidly followed and failure\r\nensue. The skill of the grower appears to be born, not made, and those\r\nwho have acquired the art succeed where theoretical knowledge fails.\r\nFor cultural purposes, the _Agaricus campestris_ is most universally\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Soil._--The soil best suited for the growth of mushrooms is one\r\nrich in decayed or decaying vegetable matter. Mushrooms are often\r\nfound growing in localities where a log or stump has decayed or where\r\nthe inorganic matter from the manure of cattle or horses has been\r\ndistributed on the soil. Artificial beds for the growth of mushrooms\r\nare made up largely of organic manurial substances.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spores._--Mushrooms are grown from spores. The mushroom produces a\r\nbrown powdery material which consists of almost innumerable simple\r\ncells of ovate shape to which the term “spore” has been applied.\r\nA spore is not in the strict sense of the word a seed, but simply\r\na cell which by proliferation produces the new fungus. Generally\r\ngrowers do not use these spores directly in seeding mushroom beds.\r\nEach complete spore, however, is, under favorable conditions, capable\r\nof proliferation or germination, producing a thread-like growth of a\r\nspider-web character which penetrates through the soil, prepared and\r\nmanured, upon which a spore is germinated. This spider-web-like growth,\r\nin the common language of mushroom growers, is called the spawn, more\r\nproperly called the mycelium of the mushroom. When the conditions are\r\nfavorable, there are formed on the threads of this mycelium small\r\nnodules, which are the earlier stages of the complete fungus itself.\r\nFrom the beginning of this growth until the final production of the\r\nmushroom two or three days or even a week may elapse. The earlier\r\nperiods of this growth take place under ordinary circumstances, but the\r\nadvent of a warm rain or other extremely favorable conditions causes\r\nthe budding mushroom to grow at an enormously rapid rate. The mushroom\r\nmay not be said to have a root, stem, and leaf, as is the case with an\r\nordinary green plant, but is practically a single organism, assuming\r\ndifferent shapes which are represented by the different varieties and\r\nspecies of growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Differing Varieties of Edible Mushrooms._--There is a very large\r\nvariety of edible mushrooms differing in form, size, and shape from\r\nthe _Agaricus campestris_. In the Washington markets there are four\r\nprincipal kinds of mushrooms which are found growing wild in the\r\nvicinity of the city. These comprise the common mushroom--_Agaricus\r\ncampestris_, the horse mushroom--_Agaricus arvensis_, shaggy\r\nmushroom--_Coprinus comatus_, and the puff-ball--_Lycoperdon\r\ncyathiforme_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conditions of Growth._--The proper shed or cellars having been\r\nselected, the first thing to do is to see that the temperature is\r\nfavorable to the growth of the fungi. Temperatures above 60 degrees\r\nF., or below 50 degrees F., are not favorable to the growth. The\r\nbest temperatures are from 55 to 58 degrees. The locality where the\r\nmushrooms are grown should be kept very damp and the air highly\r\nsaturated with aqueous vapor. The reason that mushrooms grow best in\r\ncovered places, such as has been mentioned, is due to the particularly\r\nfavorable influence which the even temperature mentioned and a\r\npractically saturated atmosphere have upon the growth. In localities\r\nwhere the changes of temperature are not very severe, mushrooms grow\r\nvery well in the open. In the county of Kent, England, I have seen\r\nmushrooms growing in the open garden, where, by covering with straw,\r\nthey flourish during the greater part of the year. In the winter time\r\nthe temperature may be kept quite even by the covering to make abundant\r\ncrops, while in the months of August, September, and October they grow\r\nin the open in great abundance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preparation of Seed Bed._--The seed bed for the growth of mushrooms,\r\nas has already been indicated, is made principally of well decayed\r\nstable or stall manure. The manure must be well fermented, thoroughly\r\ndisintegrated, and exposed for a sufficient length of time to be in the\r\nproper condition. Mushrooms cannot be obtained until the heat attending\r\nthe fermentation of manure has entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\nDirections for growing mushrooms cannot be given here, but those who\r\nare intending to enter the business should consult the best authorities\r\nand begin in a small way until they acquire the necessary skill before\r\ncommercial success can be obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Growth of Mushrooms in France._--Perhaps in no country has the\r\ncultivation of mushrooms been carried to such a large extent as in\r\nFrance. The principal industries in France are confined to those\r\nregions where artificial caves have been made by the quarrying of\r\nbuilding stone. The most extensive caverns of this kind exist in\r\nthe neighborhood of Paris, near Bordeaux, and particularly in the\r\nneighborhood of Sceaux. These artificial caverns are often miles in\r\nextent and furnish exceptionally favorable opportunities for the growth\r\nof mushrooms. The soils or manures on which they are grown must be\r\ncarried into these caverns, and experience has shown that mushrooms do\r\nnot continue to grow well in the same locality, and, therefore, the\r\nplace of growth must be moved from time to time to different parts of\r\nthe caves. The galleries of these abandoned quarries are sometimes of\r\nenormous extent and are from 30 to 150 feet below the surface. They are\r\ngenerally from seven to ten feet high, but occasionally so low that a\r\nman cannot stand upright in them. In general they are wide enough for\r\ntwo rows of beds with a foot way 18 inches wide in the center. Where a\r\nmushroom bed has been well prepared and properly seeded, it produces\r\nabout six pounds of mushrooms per square yard. These mushrooms bring,\r\nin the market, an average of about 15 cents per pound. It is stated by\r\nsome authorities that the reason the bed ceases to bear after a time\r\nand has to be abandoned or moved is not because of the exhaustion of\r\nthe food but is due to the ravages of an insect or fly which produces\r\na worm which is fatal to the growth of the fungus. At any rate, it is\r\ncustomary to abandon the beds after they have been bearing for six or\r\neight months and to return to them after a year, when they are found to\r\nagain be productive.\r\n\r\nIt is not expected that the general consumer will become an expert in\r\nthe selection of mushrooms. Where mushrooms are exposed in a public\r\nmarket, it is the duty of the municipal officers in charge of food\r\nproducts to see to it that poisonous varieties are not exposed for\r\nsale. It will be of value, however, to the reader to have some idea\r\nof the general shape of some of the more common edible and poisonous\r\nvarieties. It is generally supposed that mushrooms, toadstools, and\r\npuff-balls are entirely distinct species and that only the mushroom,\r\nso-called, is edible. On the contrary, there are many edible toadstools\r\nand many edible puff-balls, and all three classes of fungi belong to\r\nthe same general family.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Food Value of Mushrooms._--The nutritive value of mushrooms is\r\nnot exceptionally high, although there is a popular opinion to the\r\ncontrary. Frequently it has been stated that the mushroom in the\r\nvegetable world holds a similar position to beefsteak among meats,\r\nbeing particularly rich in digestible protein. The analytical data\r\nwhich have been collected from numerous sources on the composition\r\nof mushrooms do not bear out this popular impression, but, on the\r\ncontrary, show that the mushroom is a food product consisting very\r\nlargely of water and of only very small quantities of protein, fat, and\r\ncarbohydrates.\r\n\r\nThe composition of some of the common mushrooms is shown in the\r\nfollowing table (Farmers’ Bulletin, No. 79, Mushrooms as Food):\r\n\r\n  ---------+------+------+------+------+-----+----+-------+------+----\r\n           |      |      |      | NON- |     |    |       |      |\r\n           |      |      | ALBU-| ALBU-|     |    |       |      |\r\n           |      | TOTAL|MINOID|MINOID|     |    | CARBO-|      |\r\n           |      |NITRO-|NITRO-|NITRO-| PRO-|    |  HY-  |      |\r\n           |WATER.| GEN. | GEN. | GEN. |TEIN.|FAT.|DRATES.|FIBER.|ASH.\r\n  ---------+------+------+------+------+-----+----+-------+------+----\r\n  Common   |      |      |      |      |     |    |       |      |\r\n  mushroom,|91.30 | 0.60 | 0.36 | 0.24 | 3.75|0.20|  3.50 | 0.80 |0.50\r\n  Shaggy   |      |      |      |      |     |    |       |      |\r\n  Coprinus,|92.19 |  .45 |  .15 |  .30 | 2.81| .26|  1.40 |  .57 | .98\r\n  Inky     |      |      |      |      |     |    |       |      |\r\n  Coprinus,|92.31 |  .36 |  ..  |  ..  | 2.25| .24|  .... |  .72 |1.29\r\n  Common   |      |      |      |      |     |    |       |      |\r\n  Morel,   |89.54 |  .49 |  .37 |  .12 | 3.06| .50|  1.60 |  .91 |1.08\r\n  ---------+------+------+------+------+-----+----+-------+------+----\r\n\r\nThese data may be compared with the composition of the beefsteak:\r\n\r\n  Water,    62.5 percent\r\n  Protein,  19.5    „\r\n  Fat,      17.0    „\r\n  Ash,       1.0    „\r\n\r\nFrom the above data it is seen that the mushroom does not contain\r\nanything like the amount of protein found in beefsteak. It has\r\none-third more water, one-sixth as much protein, and only one-fortieth\r\nas much fat. Beefsteak contains no carbohydrates except less than one\r\npercent of glycogen, while the amount of carbohydrates in the mushroom\r\nvaries from 1.5 to 3.5 percent. It is evident that the mushroom is\r\nprincipally valuable as a condimental substance and not as a food\r\nproduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Distinction between Poisonous and Edible Varieties._--It has already\r\nbeen stated that only the expert is able to distinguish between the\r\npoisonous varieties of mushrooms and those that are edible. Even the\r\nskilled botanist, as well as the expert, may sometimes make mistakes\r\nin this matter. Hence the only perfectly sure method of protection\r\nagainst the poisonous varieties is the eating of only those which are\r\ncultivated and which are known to be free of poisonous properties.\r\nOn the other hand, the wild variety, by many connoisseurs, is much\r\nmore highly valued as being more delicate and palatable. It should\r\nalso be remembered that the cultivation of mushrooms is not very\r\nwidely extended, and if the supply of the wild variety should be\r\nexcluded there would be a great diminution of the quantity which is\r\naccessible to the consumer. This would be an especial hardship in\r\nthe United States, where mushrooms grow wild over such wide areas\r\nand so abundantly and where the cultivation of them as compared with\r\nsome other countries is somewhat restricted. There are some general\r\ncharacteristics by means of which a distinction can be made between the\r\nedible and the poisonous varieties.\r\n\r\nThe following rules are given for the rejection of the probably\r\npoisonous mushroom by George Francis Atkinson (“Studies of American\r\nFungi--1900”): “In the selection of mushrooms to eat, great caution\r\nshould be employed by those who are not reasonably familiar with\r\nthe means of determination of the species, or those who have not an\r\nintimate acquaintance with certain forms. Rarely should the beginner\r\nbe encouraged to eat them upon his own determination. It is best at\r\nfirst to consult someone who knows or to send first specimens away for\r\ndetermination, though in many cases a careful comparison of the plant\r\nwith the figures and descriptions given in this book will enable a\r\nnovice to recognize it. In taking up a species for the first time it\r\nwould be well to experiment cautiously.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_No Certain Rule to Distinguish the Poisonous from the Edible._--“There\r\nis no test like the ‘silver-spoon test’ which will enable one to tell\r\nthe poisonous mushroom from the edible ones. Nor is the presence of the\r\nso-called ‘death-cup’ a sure sign that the fungus is poisonous, for\r\n_Amanita cæsarea_ has this cup. For the beginner, however, there are\r\ncertain general rules, which, if carefully followed, will enable him to\r\navoid the poisonous ones, while at the same time necessarily excluding\r\nmany edible ones.\r\n\r\n“1st.--Reject all fungi which have begun to decay, or which are\r\ninfested with larvæ.\r\n\r\n“2d.--Reject all fungi when in the button stage, since the characters\r\nare not yet shown which enable one to distinguish the genera and\r\nspecies. Buttons in pasture lands which are at the surface of the\r\nground, and not deep-seated in the soil, would very likely not belong\r\nto any of the very poisonous kinds.\r\n\r\n“3d.--Reject all fungi which have a cup or sac-like envelope at the\r\nbase of the stem, or which have a scaly or closely fitting layer at\r\nthe base of the stem and rather loose warts on the pileus, especially\r\nif the gills are white. _Amanita cæsarea_, however, has a sac-like\r\nenvelope at the base of the stem and yellow gills as well as a yellow\r\ncap, and is edible. _Amanita rubescens_ has remnants of a scaly\r\nenvelope on the base of the stem and loose warts on the cap, and the\r\nflesh, where wounded, becomes reddish. It is edible.\r\n\r\n“4th.--Reject all fungi with a milky juice unless the juice is reddish.\r\nSeveral species with copious white milk, sweet or mild to the taste,\r\nare edible.\r\n\r\n“5th.--Reject very brittle fungi with gills nearly all of equal length\r\nwhere the flesh of the cap is thin, especially those with bright caps.\r\n\r\n“6th.--Reject all Boleti in which the flesh changes color where bruised\r\nor cut, or those in which the tubes have reddish mouths, also those the\r\ntaste of which is bitter. _Strobilomyces strobilaceus_ (Scop.) Berk.\r\nchanges color when cut, and is edible.\r\n\r\n“7th.--Reject fungi which have a cobwebby veil or ring when young, and\r\nthose with slimy caps and clay-colored spores.\r\n\r\n“In addition, proceed cautiously in all cases, and make it a point to\r\nbecome very familiar with a few species first, and gradually extend the\r\nrange of species rather than attempt the first season to eat a large\r\nnumber of different kinds. All puff-balls are edible so long as they\r\nare white inside, though some are better than others. All coral-like or\r\nclub fungi are edible.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Popular Distinction between Toadstools and Mushrooms._--There is a\r\ngeneral opinion that the toadstool is poisonous and the mushroom is\r\nnot. There is, however, no scientific distinction between the two kinds\r\nof fungi, popularly known as toadstools and mushrooms. The distinction\r\nis purely an arbitrary one. The small toadstools are often as delicious\r\nand as harmless as the small mushroom. The small mushroom, on the\r\nother hand, may be as deadly and as undesirable as the worst specimen\r\nof toadstool. There is danger especially to two classes of people\r\nin the discrimination between the poisonous and edible varieties of\r\nmushrooms and toadstools. The first class is composed of those who\r\nare practically unaware of the existence of poisonous varieties and\r\nthe second class of persons are those who claim to be able to tell an\r\nedible mushroom from a certain number of tests or claims which they\r\nregard as infallible. Both of these classes of persons are apt to be\r\ndeceived or injured by dangerous varieties.\r\n\r\nThe following popular signs of distinguishing between the poisonous and\r\nnon-poisonous varieties are pronounced worthless by Gibson (“Our Edible\r\nToadstools and Mushrooms and How to Distinguish Them”):\r\n\r\n  “FAVORABLE SIGNS.\r\n\r\n  1. Pleasant taste and odor.\r\n\r\n  2. Peeling of the skin of the cap from rim to center.\r\n\r\n  3. Pink gills, turning brown in older specimens.\r\n\r\n  4. The stem easily pulled out of the cap and inserted in it like a\r\n  parasol handle.\r\n\r\n  5. Solid stems.\r\n\r\n  6. Must be gathered in the morning.\r\n\r\n  7. ‘Any fungus having a pleasant taste and odor, being found\r\n  similarly agreeable after being plainly broiled without the least\r\n  seasoning is perfectly safe.’\r\n\r\n  “UNFAVORABLE SIGNS.\r\n\r\n  8. Boiling with a ‘silver spoon,’ the staining of the silver\r\n  indicating danger.\r\n\r\n  9. Change of color in the fraction of the fresh mushroom.\r\n\r\n  10. Slimy or sticky on the top.\r\n\r\n  11. Having the stems at their sides.\r\n\r\n  12. Growing in clusters.\r\n\r\n  13. Found in dark, damp places.\r\n\r\n  14. Growing on wood, decayed logs, or stumps.\r\n\r\n  15. Growing on or near manure.\r\n\r\n  16. Having bright colors.\r\n\r\n  17. Containing milky juice.\r\n\r\n  18. Having the gill plates of even length.\r\n\r\n  19. Melting into black fluid.\r\n\r\n  20. Biting the tongue or having a bitter or nauseating taste.\r\n\r\n  21. Changing color by immersion in salt-water, or upon being dusted\r\n  with salt.\r\n\r\n  “These present but a selection of the more prevalent notions. Taken\r\n  _in toto_, they would prove entirely safe, as they would practically\r\n  exclude every species of toadstool or mushroom that grows. But as a\r\n  rule the village oracle bases his infallibility upon two or three\r\n  of the above ‘rules,’ and inasmuch as the entire list absolutely\r\n  _omits_ the _only_ one test by which danger is to be avoided, it is\r\n  a seven days’ wonder that the grewsome toadstool epitaph is not more\r\n  frequent.”\r\n\r\nThe following tests are regarded as favorable by Gibson:\r\n\r\n1. Avoid every mushroom having a cup or suggestion of such, at base;\r\nthe distinctly fatal poisons are thus excluded.\r\n\r\n2. Exclude those having an unpleasant odor, a peppery, bitter, or other\r\nunpalatable flavor, or tough consistency.\r\n\r\n3. Exclude those infested with worms or in advanced age or decay.\r\n\r\n4. In testing others which will pass the above probation let the\r\nspecimen be kept by itself, not in contact with or enclosed in the same\r\nbasket with other species.\r\n\r\nBegin by a mere nibble, the size of a pea, and gentle mastication,\r\nbeing careful to swallow no saliva, and finally expelling all from\r\nthe mouth. If no noticeable results follow, the next trial, with the\r\ninterval of a day, with the same quantity may permit of a swallow of a\r\nlittle of the juice, the fragments of the fungus expelled as before.\r\nNo unpleasantness following for twenty-four hours, the third trial\r\nmay permit of a similar entire fragment being swallowed, all of these\r\nexperiments to be made on an empty stomach. If this introduction of\r\nthe actual substance of the fungus into the stomach is succeeded by\r\nno disturbance in twenty-four hours, a larger piece, the size of a\r\nhazelnut, may be attempted, and thus the amount gradually increased day\r\nby day until the demonstration of edibility, or at least harmlessness,\r\nis complete and the species thus admitted into the “safe” list. By\r\nfollowing this method with the utmost caution the experimenter can at\r\nbest suffer but a slight temporary indisposition as the result of his\r\nhardihood, in the event of a noxious species having been encountered,\r\nand will at least thus have the satisfaction of discovery of an enemy\r\nif not a friend.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that any mushroom, _omitting the Amanita_, which is\r\npleasant to the taste and otherwise agreeable as to odor and texture\r\nwhen raw, is probably harmless and may safely be thus ventured on\r\nwith a view of establishing its edibility. A prominent author on our\r\nedible mushrooms (McIlvaine) applies this rule to all the Agarics\r\nwith confidence. “This rule may be established,” he says: “All\r\nAgarics--excepting the Amanitæ--mild to the taste when raw, if they\r\ncommend themselves in other ways, are edible.” This claim is borne out\r\nin his experience, with the result that he now numbers over one hundred\r\nspecies among his habitual edible list out of the three hundred which\r\nhe has actually found by personal test to be edible or harmless. “So\r\nnumerous are toadstools,” he continues, “and so well does a study of\r\nthem define their habits and habitats, that the writer _never fails\r\nupon any day from April to December to find ample supply of healthy,\r\nnutritious, delicate toadstools for himself and family_.”\r\n\r\n“In gathering mushrooms one should be supplied with a sharp knife. The\r\nmushrooms should be carefully cut off an inch or so below the cap,\r\nor at least sufficiently far above the ground to escape all signs of\r\ndirt on the stems. They should then be laid gills upward in their\r\nreceptacle, and it is well to have a special basket, arranged with\r\none or two removable bottoms or horizontal partitions, which are kept\r\nin place by upright props within, thus relieving the lower layers of\r\nmushrooms from the weight of those above them. Such a basket is almost\r\nindispensable.\r\n\r\n“Before preparing mushrooms for the table, the specimens should be\r\ncarefully scrutinized for a class of fungus specialists which we have\r\nnot taken into account, and which have probably anticipated us. The\r\nmushroom is proverbial for its rapid development, but nature has not\r\nallowed it thus to escape the usual penalties of lush vegetation, as\r\nwitness this swarming, squirming host, minute grubs, which occasionally\r\nhoney-comb or hollow its entire substance ere it has reached its prime;\r\nindeed, in many cases, even before it has fully expanded or even\r\nprotruded above ground.\r\n\r\n“Like the carrion flies, the bees, and wasps, which in early times\r\nwere believed to be of spontaneous origin--flies being generated from\r\nputrefaction, bees from dead bulls, and the martial wasps from defunct\r\n“war-horses”--these fungus swarms, which so speedily reduce a fair\r\nspecimen of a mushroom to a melting loathsome mass, were also supposed\r\nto be the natural progeny of the ‘poisonous toadstool.’ But science has\r\nsolved the riddle of their mysterious omnipresence among the fungi,\r\neach particular swarm of grubs being the witness of a former visit\r\nof a maternal parent insect, which has sought the budding fungus in\r\nits haunts often before it has fully revealed itself to human gaze,\r\nand implanted within its substance her hundred or more eggs. To the\r\nuneducated eye these larvæ all appear similar, but the specialist in\r\nentomology readily distinguishes between them as the young of this or\r\nthat species of fly, gnat, or beetle.\r\n\r\n“As an illustration of the assiduity with which the history of these\r\ntiny scavenger insects has been followed by science, I may mention that\r\nin the gnat group alone over seven hundred species have been discovered\r\nand scientifically described, many of them requiring a powerful\r\nmagnifier to reveal their identities.\r\n\r\n“Specimens of infected or decaying mushrooms preserved within a\r\ntightly closed box--and, we would suggest, duly quarantined--will at\r\nlength reveal the imago forms of the voracious larvæ; generally a\r\nswarm of tiny gnats or flies, with an occasional sprinkling of small\r\nglossy black beetles, or perhaps a beautiful indigo-blue insect half\r\nan inch in length of most nervous habit, and possessed of a long and\r\nvery active tail. This insect is an example of the curious group of\r\nrove-beetles--staphylinus--a family of insect scavengers, many of whose\r\nspecies depend upon the fungi for subsistence.\r\n\r\n“Even the large woody growth known as ‘punk’ or ‘touchwood,’ so\r\nfrequently seen upon decaying trunks, is not spared. A huge specimen in\r\nmy keeping was literally reduced to dust by a single species of beetle.\r\n\r\n“Considering the prevalence of these fungus hosts, it is well in\r\nall mushrooms to take the precaution of making a vertical section\r\nthrough stem and cap, excluding such specimens as are conspicuously\r\nmonopolized, and not being too critical of the rest, for the\r\nover-fastidious gourmet will often thus have little to show for his\r\nmorning walk. I have gathered a hundred specimens of fungi in one\r\nstroll, perhaps not a quarter of which, upon careful scrutiny, though\r\nfair of exterior would be fit for the table. The fungus hunter _par\r\nexcellence_ has usually been there before us and left his mark--a mere\r\nfine brown streak or tunnel, perhaps winding through the pulp or stem,\r\nwhere his minute fungoid identity is even yet secreted. But we bigger\r\nfungus eaters gradually learn to accept him--if not too outrageously\r\npromiscuous--as a natural part and parcel of our Hachis aux\r\nChampignons, or our simple mushrooms on toast, even as we wink at the\r\nsimilar lively accessories which sophisticate our delectable raisins,\r\nprunes, and figs, to say nothing of prime old Rochefort” (pages 33-34).\r\n\r\nE. Faupin, the author of the work “Les Champignons Comestibles et\r\nVénéneux,” gives some valuable hints respecting the confusion of edible\r\nand poisonous varieties of mushrooms. He also says that the so-called\r\nrules which are often formulated to distinguish the good mushrooms from\r\nthe bad are nearly all misleading. If they are applicable in a few\r\nparticular cases they surely are not in all, and consequently ought to\r\nbe judged as of no value. For instance, it has been commonly said that\r\nthe mushrooms whose flesh changes color when exposed are poisonous.\r\nThis is true for certain kinds but it is not true for others. There\r\nare, indeed, some mushrooms whose flesh undergoes an alteration when\r\nit is exposed and which are, nevertheless, of most excellent quality.\r\nAs an example of this, the variety known as “delicious lactaire” may\r\nbe cited. On the contrary there are other kinds whose flesh remains\r\nwhite on exposure and which are decidedly poisonous, as for example\r\n_Amanita citrina_ Pers. It is also said that a mushroom whose stem\r\nis surrounded by a ring is to be considered edible. This indication\r\nis altogether deceptive. Some of the most poisonous varieties have\r\nwell formed rings. It is also misleading to credit the action of the\r\njuice of the mushroom in coloring a piece of silver. It is said that\r\nthose mushrooms whose juice blackens silver are poisonous, while those\r\nwhich do not are harmless. This perhaps is the most dangerous of all\r\nthe rules to go by, as some of the most poisonous varieties would be\r\nadmitted on this test. It is also misleading to suppose, as is commonly\r\nthe case, that mushrooms which are attacked by insects, larvæ, etc.,\r\ncan be eaten without danger. Likewise misleading is the general opinion\r\nthat mushrooms whose odor is agreeable or which have no appreciable\r\nodor are not poisonous. It is high time to eradicate these misleading\r\nnotions and to let the people know with certainty that aside from\r\nthe botanical character there does not exist any particular sign nor\r\nany particular means of affirming that a given mushroom is edible or\r\npoisonous. Science alone, therefore, has the sole power of teaching to\r\ndistinguish the poisonous from the non-poisonous varieties. For many\r\nyears attempts have been made to popularize the science which will give\r\nto the people the desired information, but in spite of these efforts\r\nthe number of cases of poisoning does not seem to diminish, and why?\r\nThe response is evident. It is because the efforts which have been made\r\nby mycologists have not yet been appreciated by the mass of people,\r\nand because it has not yet been possible to point out to the public\r\nat large the poisonous species. The number of species of poisonous\r\nmushrooms which are capable of causing death is happily not very great.\r\nThe _Amanitas_ and the _Volvarias_ are almost exclusively the poisonous\r\nspecies. Let it be understood, therefore, by the people that there do\r\nexist mushrooms which are capable of killing. If the people desire\r\nto place themselves out of danger let them begin by learning these\r\nvarieties. Their number is very limited, as there are only five or\r\nsix species at most. When they are well known it will be very easy to\r\ndistinguish them and to recognize all others as edible. Following is a\r\nlist of the most poisonous mushrooms known, and all that are likely at\r\nany time to produce death:\r\n\r\n  Amanita phalloides Fr.\r\n  Amanita citrina Pers.\r\n  Amanita verna Bull.\r\n  Amanita virosa Fr.\r\n  Volvaria gloiocephala, var. speciosa (Fr.).\r\n  Amanita muscaria (L.) Pers.\r\n  Amanita pantherina DC.\r\n  Lactarius torminosus (Schaeff.) Fr.\r\n  Lactarius rufus Fr.\r\n  Lactarius zonarius (Bull.) Fr.\r\n  Lactarius pyrogalus (Bull.) Fr.\r\n  Russula emetica Fr.\r\n  Russula queletii Fr.\r\n  Russula fœtens (Pers.) Fr.\r\n  Boletus felleus Bull.\r\n  Boletus satanus Lenz.\r\n  Boletus erythropus Cke.\r\n  Boletus luridus Schaeff.\r\n  Entoloma lividum Bull.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Most Poisonous of Mushrooms._--The most poisonous of the common\r\nmushrooms is known as _Amanita verna_ Bull. So active is its poison\r\nthat this variety has become known as the “deadly Amanita.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=Types of Edible Mushrooms.=--While it is quite impossible for\r\na manual of this kind to give any directions by which a person,\r\nnot an expert, may make certain distinctions between the edible\r\nand poisonous varieties of mushrooms, it is thought advisable to\r\ngive a fair technical illustration of the two classes. The common\r\nmushroom, _Agaricus campestris_, is shown in the accompanying Fig.\r\n61,--three-fourths its natural size. The second specimen from the left\r\nis young and is in a state of development known as a button. The figure\r\nat the extreme left is a larger specimen, showing the slightly checked\r\nsurface that sometimes occurs in this species. In fresh specimens the\r\nsurface is white, but various shades of light brown, either checked or\r\nplain, are often found. The specimen at the right shows the gills on\r\nthe lower surface of the cap. These gills in a newly expanded mushroom,\r\nfresh from the field, are of a beautiful delicate pale pink color,\r\noften with a touch of salmon. In the older samples the gills turn to a\r\nlight brown and finally almost to a black color. This discoloration is\r\nchiefly due to the development of almost innumerable spores from which\r\nnew plants are propagated. If the stem of a common mushroom be broken\r\noff and the cap be laid gills downward on a piece of white paper, the\r\nspores will drop off and after a few hours will appear as a brown dust.\r\nThe usual diameter of full-grown specimens of this variety of mushroom\r\nis from 1¹⁄₂ to 3 inches, though many smaller and many larger samples\r\nare found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.--COMMON MUSHROOM, _Agaricus campestris_.\r\nEDIBLE. (THREE-FOURTHS NATURAL SIZE.)--(_F. V. Coville, Circular No.\r\n13, Division of Botany, Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\nThis variety of mushroom is the principal one which is exposed upon the\r\nmarkets of Washington. They are especially abundant in the autumn after\r\ncopious rains often succeeding the usual period of drought in that\r\nregion. October is the banner month for this variety of mushroom. The\r\nmycelium from which the autumn mushroom grows is formed in the spring,\r\nand after the dry period of summer the little spheroid granules formed\r\nupon the mycelium are capable of absorbing the moisture of the warm\r\nautumnal rains and rapidly expand to the full-grown mushroom. After\r\nall the conditions of growth are fulfilled it usually requires only a\r\nsingle night for a button to push through the surface of the soil and\r\nexpand its cap. Mushrooms are particularly obnoxious to the ravages\r\nof insects, and it is always advisable that they should be gathered\r\nand eaten immediately after they are formed. The insect larvæ attack\r\nthe mature mushroom, travelling up through the stem into the cap, and\r\ndecomposition rapidly follows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.--EDIBLE MUSHROOMS (_Agaricus arvensis_\r\nSchaeff.).--(_F. V. Coville._)]\r\n\r\nIt is easy to determine whether a mushroom is wormy or not by breaking\r\noff the stem close to the cap and observing if there are little\r\nholes through which the larvæ have passed upward into the cap. The\r\ncommon mushroom occurs most frequently on lawns and in pastures, and\r\nespecially in neglected fields where weeds have been succeeded by a\r\nscant covering of grass. Sometimes during the spring and summer, as\r\nwell as in the autumn, the common mushroom is found upon the market.\r\nThese mushrooms usually are produced upon the garbage dumping grounds\r\nnear the city. The garbage and refuse from the city furnish the\r\nmanurial conditions required for a speedy development of the mushroom\r\nfrom the mycelium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.--SHAGGY MUSHROOM, _Coprinus comatus_. EDIBLE.\r\n(THREE-FOURTHS NATURAL SIZE.)--(_Coville, Circular 13, Division of\r\nBotany._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Horse Mushroom_ (_Agaricus arvensis_ Schaeff.).--This variety of\r\nmushroom is also one which grows in great abundance in the neighborhood\r\nof Washington and in other latitudes affording a similar environment.\r\nThis specimen is in many respects like _Agaricus campestris_ but\r\nthe surface of the cap is somewhat darker colored. The ring on the\r\nstem is also wider and thicker than in _campestris_. This variety\r\nalso grows larger than _campestris_, and the diameter of the cap is\r\ncommonly from three to six inches. The figure is only about one-half\r\nthe natural size. The horse mushroom is frequently confounded with\r\nthe common mushroom, and there is practically no difference in their\r\nedible qualities. It grows preferably in gardens rather than fields,\r\nand especially in gardens which have been heavily fertilized. It also\r\nfrequently appears in old beds composed of decayed stable manure which\r\nhas been used for forcing beds for early vegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Shaggy Mushroom_ (_Coprinus comatus_ Fr.).--The accompanying Fig.\r\n63 represents a group of three specimens of this variety of mushroom\r\ngrowing from a single base. The largest one is already showing signs\r\nof liquefaction and decomposition and a part of the cap has already\r\ndisappeared. One of the peculiarities of this species is that beginning\r\nwith the edge of the cap the whole mushroom dissolves sometimes within\r\na day, when it is full grown, into an inky-black fluid. A portion of\r\nthis inky fluid has run partly down the white stem of the largest\r\nmushroom. The cap of this mushroom, except when it begins to liquefy,\r\nresembles somewhat the form of a partially closed umbrella. In the\r\nearly stages of growth the cap, gills, and stem are white, except the\r\napex of the cap, which is generally dark-colored. The surface of the\r\ncap is covered with delicate lacerated scales, the characteristic from\r\nwhich the name _comatus_ or shaggy is derived. The juice from the\r\nfresh sample is colorless as water. When it first begins to turn it is\r\nwine-colored, and until the juice is very deeply discolored the sample\r\nis still edible. After the juice has turned completely black it is\r\nconsidered too old to be eaten. This species of mushroom grows best in\r\nshady places, in a soil well supplied with humus. The season in which\r\nthis variety of mushroom is most abundant is late in the autumn or\r\nearly in the winter, when the nights are cold but the ground is not yet\r\nfrozen. The liquefaction and decay of this mushroom come on so quickly\r\nthat it is not usually infested with larvæ which do not have time to\r\ndevelop before the mushroom is reduced to a shapeless mass. The most\r\ncommon organism found is the myriapod, a thousand-legged worm, which\r\noften finds its way between the gills and stem. This cavity should\r\nalways be examined for worms of this kind when the mushroom is being\r\nprepared for the table.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fairy Ring Mushroom_ (_Marasmius oreades_ Fr.).--This variety is one\r\nwhich is interesting both on account of its edible properties and by\r\nreason of the circular areas in which it often grows. This illustration\r\nis about three-fourths of the natural size. The tendency of this\r\nvariety to grow in the annual form designated is beautifully shown\r\nin the accompanying figure, from a photograph taken on the grounds\r\nof the Department of Agriculture. The ring in question is seven feet\r\nin diameter and the photograph was taken early in November. The stem\r\nin this variety has no ring,--the gills are few and widely separated\r\nand the cap as it becomes fully expanded has a peculiar knob-like\r\nprojection in the center. This gives a characteristic appearance to\r\nthis variety of mushroom. The cap and stem are colored a pinkish-buff,\r\nand the gills have a lighter shade of the same color varying in early\r\ngrowth toward a cream tint. The spores are white and can be observed\r\nby placing the cap, as already indicated, on a dark-colored paper,\r\npreferably black glazed paper. The fairy ring mushroom is one of\r\nthe commonest species which grows on the lawns in Washington and\r\nvicinity. As many as twenty of these fairy rings have been found on\r\nthe grounds of the Department of Agriculture in one season. In the\r\nearlier days, when superstition was more rife than at present, these\r\nrings were supposed to mark the places of the dances of the fairies.\r\nAnother fanciful cause assigned for the production of the rings was\r\nthat it was due to the effect of lightning striking the ground and\r\nburning the grass in a circle, and thus favoring the growth of fungi.\r\nInvestigations, however, show that the fairy ring is due to a peculiar\r\nway in which the mycelium is produced, which begins at a central point,\r\ngrowing uniformly in all directions a few inches each year. After\r\na while the central portion, being older, begins to die, and thus\r\na small circular band is formed which each year increases in size,\r\ngrowing regularly on the outside and dying as regularly on the inside.\r\nThe fairy rings are not always complete circles,--they are sometimes\r\nbroken and often are crescent-shaped. This variety of mushroom is quite\r\npermanent, does not tend to decay as rapidly as some, and resists\r\nbetter than most varieties the attacks of insects. They, however, are\r\nvery small as compared with the other common varieties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.--FAIRY RING FORMED BY _Marasmius oreades_, AN\r\nEDIBLE MUSHROOM.--(_Coville, Circular 13, Division of Botany._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Puff-balls._--A typical mushroom known as the puff-ball is the\r\nvariety known as _Lycoperdon cyathiforme_ Bosc. The puff-ball is so\r\nplain in its form that a description of its appearance is difficult.\r\nUsually the outside is colored brown and the covering is more or less\r\nirregularly checked, the white color of the interior showing between\r\nthe darker, elevated areas. When still quite young the flesh is solid,\r\nof a milk-white color, and apparently quite dry. After two or three\r\ndays it becomes soft, has a yellowish tint, develops a watery and\r\nlater an amber-colored juice as it continues its development through\r\nto the later stages. If the mushroom remains ungathered, the interior\r\ndries up into a fine brown powder which is projected into the air when\r\npressed by the finger. It is often blown away by the wind. When the\r\nfungus reaches this stage of decay it is very commonly known as “the\r\ndevil’s snuff-box.” Finally the spores and other dust-like bodies\r\nare blown away, and there is left only a dry and leathery framework.\r\nIn the latter stages the puff-ball is not regarded as edible, not\r\nbecause of its being poisonous, but on account of its dry and leathery\r\nconsistency. In the neighborhood of Washington puff-balls are found\r\ncommonly in the autumn on lawns and in gardens, and especially on\r\nvacant lots where the soil has remained uncultivated and been closely\r\ngrazed by cattle. The puff-ball also tends to grow in a fairy ring\r\nform, and in the circular area in which it grows the grass is likely\r\nto be darker in color, showing the existence of a richer soil. It is\r\nonly while the interior of the puff-ball is still solid and white, with\r\nsomething like the texture of cheese, that it has its highest edible\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.--PUFF-BALL, _Lycoperdon cyathiforme_, TOP VIEW.\r\nEDIBLE. (THREE-FOURTHS NATURAL SIZE.)--(_Coville, Circular 13, Division\r\nof Botany._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cepe_ (_Boletus edulis_ Bull.).--This variety of mushroom is one of\r\nthe most highly esteemed, especially in the south of France. It is\r\nlarge and has a very large, half-pear shaped stem. The flesh of this\r\nvariety of mushroom is white and quite firm in the young mushroom,\r\nbut becomes softer with age and assumes on the outside a wine tint.\r\nIt grows, especially in the late summer and through the autumn, wild\r\nin the forest. In the extreme south of France it sometimes appears\r\nas early as April. (“Nouvel Atlas de Champignons,” Paul Dumée, page\r\n45.) (“The Mushroom Book,” by Nina L. Marshall, page 109.) The cap is\r\nusually from four to six inches in diameter and is a gray, brownish-red\r\nor tawny-brown in color.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.--AMANITA (FULL-GROWN). (ONE-HALF NATURAL\r\nSIZE.)--(_Coville, Circular 13, Division of Botany._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Fly Amanita_ (_Amanita muscaria_ (L.) Fr.).--This is one of the\r\nvery poisonous varieties of mushrooms. In the illustration the fully\r\nmatured mushroom is shown at one-half its natural size. This is the\r\nmost common poisonous mushroom which grows in the District of Columbia\r\nand other nearby localities. The points especially to be noticed are\r\nthe bulbous enlargement at the base of the stem, breaking into thick\r\nscales above, the very broad drooping ring near the top of the stem,\r\nand the corky particles loosely attached to the smooth, glossy upper\r\nsurface of the cap. The stem, gills, and the spores are white, the\r\ncorky particles commonly of a buff color, but sometimes varying almost\r\nto white. The glossy upper surface of the cap, beneath the corky\r\nparticles, varies from a brilliant red to orange-yellow, buff, and even\r\nwhite. Commonly in the vicinity of Washington the coloration is orange\r\nin the center, shading to yellow toward the margin. Brilliant red ones\r\nare rarely seen in this locality, but white ones are not infrequent,\r\nespecially late in the season. This was the variety of mushroom that\r\nlately caused the death of a well known man in Washington. This\r\npoisonous variety is one of the largest, handsomest, and most dangerous\r\nof mushrooms, and is one whose poisonous character has been most fully\r\nstudied. It is abundant in the vicinity of Washington in the fall,\r\ngrowing chiefly in the pine woods and, especially, in the localities\r\nwhich have been frequented by hogs. The chief active poisonous\r\nprinciple of the _fly amanita_ is an alkaloid called muscarine,\r\nbut other poisonous substances whose exact nature has not yet been\r\ndiscovered also occur in the plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.--FLY AMANITA BUTTONS (_Amanita muscaria_).\r\n(NATURAL SIZE.)]\r\n\r\nWhen this variety of mushroom is reduced to a paste and exposed where\r\nit can be eaten by flies the latter are readily poisoned, and hence the\r\ncommon name of “_fly amanita_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=Symptoms of Mushroom Poisoning.=--The symptoms of poisoning from the\r\n_fly amanita_, as deduced from a number of cases, are varied. In some\r\ninstances they begin only after several hours, but usually in from\r\none-half to one or two hours. Vomiting and diarrhea almost always\r\noccur, with a pronounced flow of saliva, suppression of the urine,\r\nand various cerebral phenomena, beginning with giddiness, loss of\r\nconfidence in one’s ability to make ordinary movements, and derangement\r\nof vision. This is succeeded by stupor, cold sweats, and a very marked\r\nweakening of the heart’s action. In case of rapid recovery the stupor\r\nis short and usually marked with mild delirium. In fatal cases the\r\nstupor continues from one to two or three days, and death at last\r\nensues from the gradual weakening and final stoppage of the heart’s\r\naction.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Treatment for Poisoning.=--The treatment for poisoning by _Amanita\r\nmuscaria_ consists primarily in removing the unabsorbed portion of the\r\n_Amanita_ from the alimentary canal and in counteracting the effect\r\nof the muscarine on the heart. The action of this organ should be\r\nfortified at once by the subcutaneous injection, by a physician, of\r\natropin, in doses of from one one-hundredth to one-fiftieth of a grain.\r\nThe strongest emetics, such as tartarized antimony or apomorphin,\r\nshould be used, though in case of profound stupor even these may not\r\nproduce the desired action. Freshly ignited charcoal or two grains of\r\na one percent alkaline solution of permanganate of potash may then be\r\nadministered in order, in the case of the former substance, to absorb\r\nthe poison, or in case of the latter, to decompose it. This should be\r\nfollowed by oils and oleaginous purgatives, and the intestines should\r\nbe cleaned and washed out with an enema of warm water and turpentine.\r\n\r\nExperiments on animals poisoned by the _fly amanita_ and with pure\r\nmuscarine show very clearly that when the heart has nearly ceased to\r\nbeat it may be stimulated to strong action almost instantly by the\r\nuse of atropin. Its use as thus demonstrated has been the means of\r\nsaving numerous lives. We have in this alkaloid an almost perfect\r\nphysiological antidote for muscarine, and therefore in such cases of\r\npoisoning its use should be pushed as heroically as the symptoms of the\r\ncase will warrant.\r\n\r\nThe presence of phallin in _Amanita muscaria_ is possible and its\r\neffects should be looked for in the red color of the blood serum\r\ndischarged from the intestines. (Circular 13, Div. of Botany.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Removal of the Poisonous Principle.=--In some parts of Europe the _fly\r\namanita_ is soaked in vinegar and then is eaten with impunity. Some of\r\nthe colored people in Washington and vicinity are acquainted with this\r\nmethod of treatment, and the practice of soaking these fungi in vinegar\r\nand then eating them is not unknown, though the majority of colored\r\nwomen in the markets who deal in mushrooms look upon this species with\r\nunrestrained horror.\r\n\r\nThe poisonous variety is denatured as follows: The stem is well\r\nscraped, and the gills are removed from the cap and the upper surface\r\npeeled off. The mushrooms prepared in this way are boiled in salt and\r\nwater and afterward steeped in vinegar. They are finally washed in\r\nclear water and then cooked in the ordinary manner and eaten without\r\nany injurious results. It is not recommended, however, that a mushroom\r\nwhich contains so much deadly poison should be eaten at all, even after\r\na preparation of this kind. Any carelessness in the preparation or any\r\nfailure to carry out the process completely would result fatally.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Canned Mushrooms.=--The canning of mushrooms is an industry of large\r\nmagnitude, especially in France. The young, unexpanded mushrooms in the\r\nform of buttons are those which are usually subjected to the canning\r\nprocess. Mushrooms are brought to the factory where they are cleaned\r\nand scraped, the stem cut to a proper length, thoroughly washed in\r\nseveral washings of clean water, and taken to a sulfuring furnace\r\nwhere they are exposed to the fumes of burning sulfur for some time.\r\nThe purpose of this treatment is to bleach the mushroom and make it\r\nas white as possible. Decayed or deformed buttons are not included in\r\nthe cans of highest quality. The prepared mushrooms are then placed in\r\ncans, usually of tin, and preserved by subjecting them to a temperature\r\nat or above boiling water until thoroughly sterilized.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Canned Pieces and Stems of Mushrooms.=--The imperfect portions,\r\nthe pieces which are cut away, and other fragments of the mushroom,\r\nresulting from the preparation of the product described above, are\r\ntreated practically in the same manner for sterilizing purposes and\r\nare sold to the trade under various names, the most common of which\r\nis Champignons d’Hotel. They also frequently appear under the name of\r\nChampignon Choix and other deceptive labels.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Adulteration of Mushrooms.=--There is no adulteration practiced of\r\nfresh mushrooms unless the occasional occurrence of poisonous varieties\r\nmay be so considered. It is evident, however, that the introduction\r\nof poisonous varieties is the result of carelessness or mistake and\r\nnot for any purpose. Nevertheless a most exacting supervision over the\r\npreparation of fresh mushrooms for the market should be required, and\r\nany failure to exercise this care may be considered as resulting in\r\nadulteration or depreciation of the character of the product.\r\n\r\nIn canned mushrooms the presence of sulfurous acid may be regarded\r\nas an adulterant, and such a substance, believed to be inimical to\r\nhealth, is not necessary in the preparation of the goods. It is quite\r\ncertain that the public taste would soon adapt itself to an amber-\r\nor brown-colored product in canned mushrooms and value it as highly\r\nas the buttons which are white. Since the sole purpose of the use\r\nof sulfur is for bleaching, the end secured scarcely justifies the\r\nmeans. It is claimed, naturally, that the use of sulfur is also a\r\nsafeguard in securing a better keeping of the product, but such an\r\nadjunct for keeping purposes is only necessary when the sterilization\r\nis not complete. It is to be hoped that the day will soon come when\r\nmushrooms bleached with sulfurous acid shall no longer be found upon\r\nour market. The use of other preservatives than sulfurous acid has\r\nat times been practiced, but it is not believed that there are many\r\ncans of mushrooms offered upon the market which contain any chemical\r\npreservatives whatever save the sulfurous acid above noted. Since the\r\ncanned mushrooms are valued principally as a condiment, the inclusion\r\nof imperfect or partially decayed or malformed buttons is extremely\r\nunusual. The buttons are separated into sizes of approximately the same\r\nmagnitude, so that a can of the product is uniform in size as well as\r\nin quality. The customer may be reasonably certain that he is getting\r\na good, young, carefully selected product, free from disease and from\r\naccidental impurities which might render the product unwholesome or\r\nunpalatable.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Truffles.=--The truffle has been known almost, if not quite as long\r\nas the mushroom as an edible delicacy. The use of truffles in France\r\nbecame very common during the 14th century, but on account of their\r\nhigh price they remained for a long time a luxury and not a general\r\narticle of commerce. It is only within the 19th century, after 1840,\r\nthat their consumption became general. The truffle belongs to the\r\nbotanical family Tuberaceæ.\r\n\r\nThe propagation of truffles is similar to that of mushrooms, by spores,\r\nwhich first give rise to a mycelium which by further condensation\r\nforms the body of the truffle. This mycelium furnishes the nutritients\r\nfor the tubercle during a certain time of its early growth. In the\r\ncultivation of the truffle, artificially, it is necessary to make use\r\nof a forest or other similar artificial covering. If trees are planted\r\nespecially for the development of truffles it requires six or eight\r\nyears growth before the cultivation of truffles is successful. The\r\ntruffle grows very readily in the shade of nut-bearing trees and in\r\nthe shade of the oak. The mycelium does not produce truffles until\r\nafter several years of vegetation. When it once begins to fructify and\r\nproduce the truffle it continues to bear for many years. The truffle,\r\nlike the mushroom, grows rapidly. At first, as has already been\r\nstated, it is nourished by the mycelium, but when this is exhausted\r\nit is nourished by absorbing the nutritious elements from the soil\r\nand air. When it reaches maturity and its spores are well formed the\r\ntruffle acquires its maximum of aroma and palatability. After it has\r\nreached maturity it can remain a certain time in the soil without being\r\nchanged. However, after a time it is rapidly decomposed and its tissues\r\nbecome the seat of various chemical reactions or it is devoured by\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cultivation of Truffles._--The truffle may only be grown in the midst\r\nof very favorable conditions of climate, altitude, mellowness of the\r\nsoil, moisture, and proper shade. The planting of truffle trees serves\r\nas a _vehicle_ for the spores which are later to give birth to the\r\nmycelium which itself produces the truffle. The spores of the truffles\r\nusually reach the forests in which they are grown by natural means\r\nwithout being particularly planted. Sometimes, however, the spores are\r\ncarried directly to the soil where the new crop is to be grown.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geographic Distribution._--The truffle, like the mushroom, is spread\r\nover all parts of the earth. In Europe it is especially abundant in\r\nFrance and Italy. The provinces in France where it grows in greatest\r\nabundance are Provence, Dauphiné, Languedoc, and Périgord.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Principal Varieties._--The varieties of truffles are not so numerous\r\nas mushrooms, of which perhaps a thousand different varieties are\r\nknown, but still they are sufficiently numerous. One of those\r\nfrequently cultivated in France is known as truffles of Périgord\r\n(_Tuber melanosporum_ Vittad.). It grows best under the shade of a\r\ngrowing walnut or a young oak. The tubers of these plants, which are\r\nthe part valuable for food, may weigh from 60 to 500 grams. Other\r\nbotanical varieties which are much cultivated are _Tuber brumale_\r\nVittad., _Tuber æstivum_ Mich., _Tuber magnatum_ Vittad., and many\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Harvesting of Truffles._--The truffle comes into production from the\r\nsixth to the tenth year after planting the appropriate forest trees.\r\nIt is easy to determine the year when the harvest should begin, since\r\nduring the preceding year there is found in the soil some hypogæan\r\nmushrooms which may be considered as precursors of the truffles.\r\nMoreover, the soil under the tree becomes practically free of all\r\nvegetation. The truffle ripens from November to April, according to\r\nits variety. It is important that it should not be harvested except\r\nat the period of complete maturity. For harvesting purposes certain\r\nanimals are made use of, such as the dog and hog. These animals have\r\na delicate smell in these matters and only bring out of the soil the\r\nripe truffles while they leave the others. Man is not able to make\r\nthis nice distinction, and harvests all indiscriminately, from which\r\nthere results great financial loss. In the harvesting of truffles the\r\nground should be gone over about once in eight days in order that the\r\ntubercles may be secured during the whole winter at the proper time of\r\nmaturity. When the truffles are developed the soil above them is hilled\r\nor cracked, especially after rains. These are the places which are\r\nselected for the harvesting when it is done by the hand of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Harvesting by Means of Flies._--When the weather is warm and clear\r\nthere is seen above the place where the tubers are lying, a multitude\r\nof flies,--these mark the place where the harvest should be made. The\r\nbest time for this kind of a harvest is about nine o’clock in the\r\nmorning. Good results are not obtainable from this sign except when\r\nthe sun rises clear and becomes afterward warm. In order to find the\r\nflies the husbandman stoops down near the surface of the soil and\r\nlooks horizontally over it. The colonies of flies are thus easily\r\ndistinguished, and below each one of these colonies the truffles are\r\nfound. This is also an ineffective method because only the overripened\r\ntubercles attract the flies while those in their very prime are not\r\nthus marked.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Harvesting with Hogs._--The utilization of hogs for harvesting\r\npurposes is by far the best and most economical method. It is employed\r\nespecially in Périgord and Midi. The harvesting can be either in the\r\nmorning or afternoon. The hogs which are used for harvesting should be\r\npreviously well fed in order to prevent them from eating the truffles\r\nwhich they dig out of the ground. Each animal is led with a rope. As\r\nsoon as the hog gets the scent of truffles it pounces upon them and\r\nrapidly uncovers them with its snout. When the weather is favorable a\r\nhog can easily smell a truffle at a distance of 150 feet. As soon as\r\nthe animal has brought the truffle to the surface instead of allowing\r\nhim to eat it he should be recompensed by giving him some suitable food\r\nsuch as maize. If this little attention is neglected the animal soon\r\nbecomes discouraged and refuses to work any longer. Before leaving the\r\nspot the hog assures himself that no other truffles are contained in\r\nthat neighborhood. When the hog becomes very tired he walks very slowly\r\nand with his mouth open. It is then necessary to give him a period of\r\nrest before continuing the harvest. If the search for truffles does not\r\nbring good results the animal becomes morose, indolent, and refuses to\r\nobey. Sometimes when the hog is hungry and wants to eat the truffles\r\nit is necessary to give him a smart blow on the snout with a stick. A\r\nspecial race of hogs is used in this harvesting whose parents have also\r\npossessed the skill, and thus it becomes hereditary. A good hog is able\r\nto engage in the harvesting from the age of two to 25 years but they do\r\ntheir best work at three or four years. A single animal may be able to\r\nharvest from six to 40 pounds of truffles per day, according to their\r\nabundance in the soil. This class of hogs have a very high value, and\r\nare often sold in the south of France for this sole purpose at from\r\n$30.00 to $70.00 per head.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Harvesting with the Dog._--The dog is also employed in regions where\r\ntruffles are produced, and especially in those regions where the yield\r\nis not so great and where the area to be gone over is very large. The\r\ndog is used especially in the Dauphiné, Champagne, Bourgogne, Provence,\r\nand Languedoc, and also in the neighborhood of Paris. These dogs are\r\ntrained, as in the case of hogs, especially for this purpose and should\r\nbe rewarded when a find is made, in the same manner as the hog. This\r\nrecognition of their services should never be forgotten if animals of\r\nthe greatest skill are to be secured. The dog, as is the case with the\r\nhog, locates the truffles by the scent and digs with his four paws\r\nuntil the truffles are laid bare,--the husbandman then draws them out\r\nof the soil with long forceps. The hog is preferable to the dog because\r\nit does the whole harvesting itself, whereas in the case of the dog the\r\nhusbandman must finish the operation.\r\n\r\nThe yield of the truffle farm is naturally extremely valuable, varying\r\nwith the relative abundance of growth and character of the soil itself.\r\nSometimes the yield drops as low as five pounds per acre and sometimes\r\nrises as high as 70 pounds per acre. The average price of truffles is\r\n$2.00 per pound. The largest yield is found in the truffle farms from\r\nthe tenth to the twentieth year.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Properties of Truffles._--It is difficult to describe the properties\r\nof truffles. They are, when prepared for the table, black, rather\r\nfirm in flesh, and have a distinct and most agreeable odor and taste.\r\nA good truffle is extremely firm and resists the ordinary pressure\r\nof the finger. If it is soft it shows that it is lacking in its best\r\ncharacteristic.\r\n\r\nThe size of the truffle has a marked influence upon its value because\r\nthe small truffle loses a large part of its weight in the preparation\r\nfor eating. Truffles of good size are those which weigh from 40 to\r\n50 grams, those of first choice weighing from 60 to 100 grams. After\r\nthe truffle passes 100 grams in weight the increased weight does not\r\nproportionately increase the value. The truffles which come from light\r\nsoil are considered superior to those which come from rich soil. If\r\nthe soil contains a large quantity of iron the truffles are usually of\r\nfiner quality. All truffles are not black, though the best ones, like\r\nthose of Périgord, are black. Others are gray or brown.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Truffles._--Commerce in truffles is the subject of\r\nconsiderable fraud on account of the very high price of the genuine\r\narticle. The principal adulterations are the mixture of the inferior\r\nor imperfect varieties with the choicest or best varieties. This\r\nadulteration is easily discovered by making a careful examination of\r\nthe tubercles individually. Another fraud which is very much practiced\r\nis the introduction of soil into the cracks or crevices in order\r\nto increase their weight. This adulteration, of course, is easily\r\ndiscovered by anyone who prepares the truffles for the table. Another\r\nform of adulteration is the mingling with the ripe truffle of those\r\nwhich have not reached maturity. The unripe tubercles have very little\r\nflavor or taste and are thus easily distinguished from those which are\r\nmature. Also practiced is the pressing together with some kind of a\r\nglue of a number of smaller truffles in order to form a large mass, as\r\nif it were an entire truffle, and thus securing a larger price. This is\r\nalso a fraud easily discovered. Still another form of sophistication is\r\nthe production of artificial truffles made from potatoes and especially\r\nthose which are partially spoiled which are colored in imitation of\r\nthe truffle itself. Only those who are ignorant of the texture of\r\nthe truffle can be deceived by this gross imitation. Another form\r\nof adulteration is the sale of the truffle coming from regions less\r\nesteemed for their products for those of other more esteemed regions\r\nas for instance, the sale of truffles from Sarladais or from Domme for\r\nthose of Périgord.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preservation of the Truffle During Transit._--For the purpose of\r\nkeeping truffles in good condition during transit they may be placed in\r\nmoss, fine sand, or powdered chalk. They can be kept in this way for\r\na few days during transit, but should not be long preserved in this\r\nmanner. Truffles may also be preserved indefinitely by sterilization.\r\nIt is necessary to do this whenever they are to be sent over long\r\ndistances or kept for a long time. The methods of sterilizing are not\r\ndifferent from those described for ordinary vegetables. Truffles are\r\nalso preserved by desiccation, but in this case they lose something\r\nof their odor and taste and are not so highly esteemed. Finally the\r\ntruffles are sometimes preserved by cooking them and preserving them in\r\nwine or olive oil. (Raymond Brunet, “Manuel Pratique de la Culture des\r\nChampignons et de la Truffe.”)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Food Value of Fungi.=--While the mushroom and the truffle are the\r\nprincipal fungi used as food they are by no means the only kinds.\r\nTheir value, as has already been indicated, is rather condimental than\r\nnutritive. Those, however, who have eaten fresh or well preserved\r\nmushrooms or truffles, cooked in the best style of the culinary art,\r\nare fully acquainted with their value. The fear of poisoning does much\r\nto restrict the use of the wild mushrooms. The fields and forests are\r\nfull of many varieties of these fungi, especially in the autumn. Very\r\nfew of the varieties are poisonous, but the conservative gourmand\r\nhesitates to consume the fruits of his own activity as a collector.\r\nIn the hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains near Harper’s Ferry I have\r\nseen large areas of the forest almost covered with these growths in\r\nAugust and September, but the courage leading to their consumption was\r\nwanting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IX.\r\n\r\nSUGAR, SIRUP, CONFECTIONERY, AND HONEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGAR.\r\n\r\nThe term “sugar” is applied by common consent to the pure sugar\r\ncommercially prepared from the sugar cane and the sugar beet. These\r\ntwo kinds of sugar are sometimes designated by their own name, as, for\r\ninstance, the purchaser will ask for cane sugar or beet sugar. When no\r\nother name appears the term sugar is applied as above.\r\n\r\nIn Europe the principal sugar used is that derived from the sugar beet.\r\nIn the United States the principal sugar is that derived from the sugar\r\ncane. Notable quantities of sugar are also found in commerce derived\r\nfrom the maple tree, a small quantity from sorghum, and in Asia a\r\nconsiderable quantity is made from the palm.\r\n\r\nChemically, sugar belongs to the class of bodies known as sucrose or\r\nsaccharose and is a compound in a pure state consisting solely of\r\ncarbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, typical of that class of foods of which\r\nstarch is the most important member, known as carbohydrates. The\r\nelements mentioned are combined in sugar in the proportion of 12 parts\r\nof carbon, 22 of hydrogen, and 11 of oxygen.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of sugar consumed by the people of the United States\r\nis very large. Excluding molasses, honey, and sirups the quantity\r\nconsumed in the United States in the year ending December 31, 1905, was\r\n2,632,216 tons. There should be added to this the total quantity of\r\nsugar found in the articles of diet which are so common in this country\r\nin the form of honey, sirups, and molasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Origin of Sugar.=--In the earliest times practically the only sugar\r\nwhich was used by man was that stored by the bees, namely, honey. The\r\nsugar cane is indigenous to Asia and was not known as a source of\r\nsugar in Europe until the 13th or 14th century, when it was brought\r\nby Eastern merchants to Europe. The discovery of America and the\r\nintroduction of sugar cane into the islands adjacent thereto opened\r\nup a new field for the culture of that plant and laid the foundation\r\nof the great industry which followed. It was not, however, until\r\n100 years ago that the sugar cane industry assumed anything like\r\nthe proportions which indicated its subsequent growth. About 1747\r\nsugar cane was introduced into Louisiana and soon thereafter, about\r\n1790, became one of the most important crops of that state. Until\r\nthe beginning of the Civil War Louisiana produced a large proportion\r\nof the cane sugar consumed in the United States. During the Civil\r\nWar the industry was almost totally destroyed, but since then it has\r\ngrown until it has assumed greater proportions than ever before but\r\nconstantly diminishing proportions in relation to the total supply.\r\nLouisiana is somewhat too far north for the most economic production\r\nof sugar cane, since it is subject to injury by frosts. Sugar cane is\r\na plant which is very sensitive to cold weather and is usually killed\r\nby a hard frost. For this reason its greatest development has occurred\r\nin tropical countries, especially in Cuba, the Hawaiian Islands, and in\r\nother similar localities. At the present time by far the largest part\r\nof the sugar made from sugar cane in the world is produced in Cuba and\r\nthe Hawaiian Islands,--the Cuban crop amounting, in round numbers, to\r\n1,200,000 tons and the Hawaiian to about 400,000 tons.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Beet Sugar.=--The fact that beet sugar is contained in the common\r\ngarden beet was first discovered by a German chemist, Margraff, in\r\n1747. This important discovery remained dormant for nearly half a\r\ncentury when one of Margraff’s pupils, the son of a French refugee from\r\nPrussia, named Achard, resumed the researches which had been started\r\nby Margraff and obtained results which were then regarded as of an\r\nastonishing character. Achard’s statements were the subject of doubt\r\nand of ridicule and even his French co-laborers, members of the academy\r\ndoubted the accuracy of his work, while thinking it of sufficient\r\ninterest to look into further. A commission consisting of some of the\r\nmost important members of the Academy of Science, among them Chaptal\r\nand Vauquelin, investigated the matter and announced that the attempt\r\nto make sugar was unsuccessful but thought perhaps the maple tree might\r\nbe grown in France. Nevertheless the commission modified the methods of\r\nAchard and obtained better results. This was the beginning of that long\r\nseries of investigations which has resulted in the establishment of a\r\nbeet sugar industry, making in round numbers six million tons of sugar\r\nper year, a quantity considerable greater than that produced from the\r\nsugar cane. The name of Chaptal has been mentioned as belonging to the\r\ncommission which was appointed to study Achard’s process because it was\r\nthrough the influence of Chaptal, who had then become a Count, that the\r\nEmperor Napoleon on January 15, 1811, issued his decree establishing\r\nthe beet sugar industry as a national industry of France and granting\r\na subvention thereto. This decree ordered that one hundred thousand\r\nhectares should be planted in beets in France. Both the taxes and the\r\noctroi were withdrawn upon all sugar produced from beets for a period\r\nof four years. There were also to be established, according to the\r\ndecree, four central beet sugar factories, and it was ordered that the\r\ncrop of sugar beets in 1812 and 1813 should reach two million kilograms\r\nof raw sugar. The disastrous Russian campaign and the subsequent fall\r\nof the Napoleonic dynasty interrupted but did not destroy the industry.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of an industry by imperial decree is perhaps a novel\r\nmethod of procedure and gave rise at that time to a caricature in which\r\nthe Emperor Napoleon and the young King of Rome figured as the most\r\nimportant characters. The Emperor was represented as seated in the\r\nnursery with a cup of coffee before him into which he was squeezing the\r\njuice of a beet. Near him was seated the young King of Rome voraciously\r\nsucking a beet root while the nurse standing near and steadfastly\r\nobserving the process is saying to the youthful monarch--“Suck, dear,\r\nsuck, your father says it’s sugar.”\r\n\r\nBy reason of the embargo laid on commerce by England the cane sugar\r\ncoming from tropical islands had been kept out of the continent, so in\r\norder to supply the deficiency the Emperor Napoleon issued the decree\r\nmentioned. Due to this impetus the industry grew rapidly in France\r\neven after the fall of the empire and in the course of 20 years had\r\nassumed proportions of commercial importance. About this period German\r\nscientists became interested in the matter and by studies directed to\r\nthe improvement of the sugar in the beet and methods of manufacture\r\nlaid the foundation of a great industry in Germany which has outclassed\r\nthe similar industries of all other countries.\r\n\r\nThe production of beet sugar in the United States was only a few\r\nthousand pounds in 1879 and during that and succeeding years a number\r\nof factories were built. All of these, however, were unsuccessful\r\nexcept one which was located in Alvarado, California, and which has\r\nbeen continuously operated ever since. In 1884 the U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture undertook anew the investigation of the conditions which\r\nwere favorable to the sugar beet industry and as a result of these\r\ninvestigations a new start was made on a more substantial basis. The\r\nindustry has since then extensively grown in importance until at the\r\npresent time as much sugar is made from the sugar beet in this country\r\nas from the sugar cane. In order that an adequate idea of the magnitude\r\nof the sugar industry in the world may be had a statistical table is\r\nsubmitted on page 471, showing the production of sugar in the world\r\nduring the year 1906.\r\n\r\nThe first important report on the beet sugar industry in the United\r\nStates was made by McMurtrie as a special report No. 28 on the culture\r\nof the sugar beet, issued in 1880 by the Department of Agriculture. It\r\nis there recounted that two Philadelphians, as early as 1880, became\r\ninterested in the beet sugar industry which was then in its infancy\r\nin Europe. Eight years later David L. Child undertook in a small way\r\nthe production of beet sugar in Northampton, Mass., and issued a\r\nsmall work on the subject, entitled “The Culture of the Beet and the\r\nManufacture of Beet Sugar.” He reports that he had grown beets that\r\nwould yield 6 percent of sugar which cost not more than 11 cents a\r\npound. He made in all about one thousand, three hundred pounds of sugar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.--CORRECT POSITION OF A MATURE BEET IN THE\r\nSOIL.--(_Farmers’ Bulletin 52._)]\r\n\r\nThe first factory of any considerable size in the United States was\r\nerected in 1863 at Chatsworth, Ill., but this proved to be a financial\r\nfailure. A beet sugar factory was erected in the Sacramento Valley,\r\nCalifornia, in 1869, and after various vicissitudes a permanent factory\r\nwas established at Alvarado, as has already been mentioned. In 1874 as\r\nmuch as 1,500,000 pounds of beet sugar were made in California. In 1870\r\nand 1871 New Jersey and Massachusetts enacted legislation exempting\r\nfrom taxation for a period of 10 years all property devoted to the\r\nproduction of beet sugar. Factories were established in Massachusetts\r\nand in Delaware later on, but these all suffered financial reverses. It\r\nwas not until the latter part of the 80’s that the beet sugar industry\r\nin the United States was placed upon a paying basis, and even since\r\nthat date many ventures in the manufacture of beet sugar have resulted\r\nin financial loss and in the abandonment of the factories.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.--MAP SHOWING TEMPERATURE ZONE IN WHICH THE\r\nSUGAR BEET ATTAINS ITS GREATEST PERFECTION.--(_Farmers’ Bulletin No.\r\n52, Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conditions of Cultivation._--The sugar beet in the United States\r\ndoes not produce its maximum content of sugar in areas where the mean\r\ntemperature for the three months of June, July, and August rises above\r\n70 degrees F. The southern limit of this area is an irregular, waving\r\nline, as indicated in the accompanying map (Fig. 69). There are, of\r\ncourse, localities where high-grade beets can be produced south of\r\nthis line, but in point of fact nearly every successful beet sugar\r\nenterprise has been located within the field indicated. There is\r\nreally no limit to the northern edge of this belt except that of short\r\nseasons, incident to late frosts of spring and early frosts of autumn.\r\nTo successfully compete in the sugar markets of the world the sugar\r\nbeet should enter the factory with an average percentage of sugar of\r\nnot less than 12. Very much richer beets are often produced and in some\r\nof the irrigated areas of the west, where the climate is remarkably\r\ndry, an average percentage of 16 and 18 even has been obtained. In the\r\nwhole beet sugar crop of the United States the average percentage of\r\nsugar in the beet is probably not far from 13 or 14. In this respect it\r\nis seen that the beet is richer in sugar than the average sugar cane of\r\nLouisiana, which does not contain over 11 or 12 percent of sugar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.--A FIELD OF BEETS READY FOR\r\nHARVESTING.--(_Bureau of Plant Industry._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Yield per Acre._--The average yield per acre of sugar beets in the\r\nUnited States is unfortunately very low, due chiefly to ignorance of\r\nthe proper method of culture. The sugar beet is more of a garden than\r\na field crop and requires special cultivation and fertilization. The\r\naverage yield in the United States has probably not exceeded eight\r\ntons per acre, while the average yield in Europe is twelve or thirteen\r\ntons per acre. In this respect the Louisiana sugar cane has a marked\r\nadvantage, the average crop being over twenty tons, while thirty and\r\neven forty tons are often obtained. As soon as our farmers learn the\r\nprinciples of culture it is certain that the average yield in the\r\nUnited States will be as great as that in Europe. A typical field of\r\nbeets ready for the harvest is shown in Fig. 70.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Manufacture._--The manufacture of beet sugar is both a simple and a\r\ncomplicated operation. The simplicity of it consists in the fact that\r\nit is only necessary to extract the saccharine juices of the beet,\r\nproperly clarify them, and reduce them by evaporation to a point where\r\nthe sugar will crystallize. In reality the operation of successful\r\nmanufacture requires elaborate and costly machinery and a high degree\r\nof technical skill. A brief outline of the method will be sufficient\r\nfor the purpose of this manual.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.--BEETS READY FOR TRANSPORTATION TO\r\nFACTORY.--(_Bureau of Plant Industry._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.--DIFFUSION BATTERY.--(_Farmers’ Bulletin 52._)]\r\n\r\nThe beets, after harvesting, have the tops cut off with a small\r\nquantity of the adhering material of the neck of the beet, which\r\ncontains large quantities of salts and is not suitable to enter the\r\nfactory. In Fig. 71 is shown a view of a beet field after the harvest.\r\nThe beets are then thoroughly washed and passed through a slicing\r\nmachine in which they are cut up into thin slices or ribbons. They then\r\nenter a series of tanks, known as a diffusion battery, in which they\r\nare thoroughly treated with hot water, by means of which practically\r\nall of the sugar which they contain is extracted. The saccharine\r\nproduct obtained, known as the diffusion juice, is treated with a\r\nlarge excess of lime, heated, and carbonic acid derived from a lime\r\nkiln blown through it until the lime is all converted into a carbonate\r\ncarrying down with it the impurities of the juices. The diffusion\r\njuice as it comes from the diffusion battery is usually almost as black\r\nas ink. After carbonatation, as the process above is called, it is of a\r\nclear, light amber tint. To separate the liquid from the solid matter\r\nthe whole is passed through a filter press from which the juice emerges\r\nbright and clear and the carbonate of lime with its adhering impurities\r\nremains in the filter press as hard cakes. This process is repeated in\r\norder to secure as great a purity as possible in the juice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.--MULTIPLE-EFFECT EVAPORATING\r\nAPPARATUS.--(_Farmers’ Bulletin 52._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Evaporation._--The purified juice is conducted into multiple-effect\r\nvacuum pans, Fig. 73, from which the air is partially exhausted by\r\na pump, the vacuum rising in the series. There are usually three or\r\nfour of these pans connected together,--the first one having the least\r\nair exhausted from it and the last one the most, that is, having the\r\nhighest vacuum. The vapor which arises from the first pan is conducted\r\nthrough the copper coils to the second and serves as the heating agent\r\nwhile the vapor from the second pan passes through the copper coils to\r\nthe third and so on to the fourth. Thus the steam used for evaporating\r\nis turned only on the first pan and by this means a great economy in\r\nthe use of fuel is secured. In this way the juice is evaporated to a\r\nsirup. This is usually somewhat colored and if white sugar is made it\r\nis bleached by passing through bone-black or by the application of\r\nsulfur fumes. When sulfur is used it is often applied first to the\r\nunevaporated juice as well as to the sirup.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Final Crystallization._--The sirup is now ready for the final process,\r\nwhich takes place in what is known as the vacuum strike pan, Fig. 74. A\r\nconsiderable quantity of sirup is introduced so as to cover the lower\r\ncoils of this pan and, after the vacuum is established by a pump,\r\nevaporated to the crystallizing point. An additional quantity of cold\r\nsirup is then drawn into the pan, chilling the mass and thus producing\r\nincipient crystallization in the form of extremely minute crystals. The\r\nevaporation is now continued with the addition of sirup from time to\r\ntime, by which process the sugar crystals begin to grow. In the course\r\nof a few hours the pan is full of crystals of the size desired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.--VACUUM STRIKE PAN.--(_Farmers’ Bulletin 52._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Purification of the Sugar._--The vacuum is broken and the crystallized\r\nmass of sugar drawn into a mixing apparatus whereby all lumps are\r\nbroken up and a uniform magma secured. This is done while the mass is\r\nstill warm. Were it allowed to cool it would be extremely difficult\r\nto break it up. The warm mixture is then passed into the centrifugal\r\nmachine, by means of which the molasses is separated from the crystals\r\nand these remain as white pure crystals in the pan. The whole process\r\nof separating the juice from the massecuite, as the mass is called,\r\noccupies only a few minutes. Thus the sugar is often centrifugalled and\r\nin the barrels before it is cold from the vacuum pan.\r\n\r\nThe above is merely the outline of a method which requires complicated\r\napparatus, often of extensive proportions, and which could not be\r\ndescribed in detail except in a technical work. It gives the reader,\r\nhowever, an idea of how the white sugar which he eats is made. Often\r\nwhite sugar is not made at the sugar factory, in which case the\r\nbleaching with bone-black, etc., is omitted and a brown sugar is\r\nproduced which afterward goes to the refinery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.--SUGAR CANE FIELD READY FOR\r\nHARVEST.--(_Photographed by H. W. Wiley._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Growth of Sugar Cane._--The growth of sugar cane is confined to\r\ntropical and subtropical regions. In the United States this crop is\r\ngrown chiefly in Louisiana and Texas. Its cultivation does not extend\r\nnorthward beyond the center of Georgia. Typical scenes in sugar cane\r\nfields are shown in Figs. 75 and 76.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Manufacture of Cane Sugar.=--In the manufacture of sugar from the\r\nsugar cane the first process, naturally, after the harvest, is the\r\nexpression of the juice from the cane. At the time of harvesting the\r\ncanes are topped in such a way as to cut off the green portion of the\r\nupper part of the stalk and the leaves also are removed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.--CANE FIELD PARTLY HARVESTED.--(_Photographed\r\nby H. W. Wiley._)]\r\n\r\nThere are two methods of extracting the juice from the cane, one\r\nsimilar to that described for the sugar beet but used very little.\r\nOnly one or two factories in the United States use this method of\r\nextraction. The most common method of extraction is by passing the\r\ncanes through heavy mills. These mills are made of great strength so\r\nas to bear an immense pressure without breaking. The largest mills\r\nhave a capacity of grinding from 500 to 1000 tons of cane a day. Many\r\nof them grind only from 200 to 500 tons per day. The mills are nearly\r\nalways placed in series, that is, the cane is subjected to a double\r\npressure. The first mill is uniformly composed of three rollers of\r\nthe same size and set so that the first and second are not quite so\r\nclose together as the second and third. The second mill also often\r\nconsists of three rollers the same as the first mill but sometimes\r\nonly two. Occasionally a third is used. It is quite customary to\r\nsprinkle the crushed cane as it comes from the first mill with water\r\nbefore it enters the second mill, thus securing a greater degree of\r\nextraction. The residue from the mill is called bagasse and is commonly\r\ncarried directly to the furnace and used as fuel, furnishing steam,\r\nto evaporate the juice and drive the mill. The mills extract from 75\r\nto 80 percent of the weight of cane in juice. The sugar cane contains\r\nabout 88 percent of its weight of sugar juice. It is seen, therefore,\r\nthat a considerable portion of the sugar remains in the bagasse. By the\r\nprocess of diffusion a larger proportion of the sugar is extracted than\r\nby milling, but the resulting juices are very much diluted and require\r\na greater combustion of fuel for evaporation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clarifying the Juice._--The juice as expressed from the cane is\r\na dirty-looking mass and requires to be clarified before it is\r\nconcentrated. It is a very common practice to subject the fresh juice\r\nto the fumes of burning sulfur. In all cases the first step in the\r\nclarifying is the addition of lime to neutralize the natural acidity\r\nof the juice and facilitate the coagulation of the dissolved matter.\r\nThe limed juice is next subjected to heating and as the boiling point\r\napproaches a separation of the suspended and coagulated matter takes\r\nplace, the light coming to the top and the heavy falling to the bottom.\r\nThe common method of separating these bodies is by skimming the top\r\ncoagulum and settling the bottom portion and drawing off the clear\r\njuice therefrom. In addition to this to get a more complete separation\r\nthe heated juice may be run through a filter press.\r\n\r\nThe clarification of sugar cane juice, as is seen, is much more simple\r\nthan that of beet juice. The method employed for the clarification of\r\nbeet juice is sometimes used for cane juice but not very frequently.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Evaporation of Clarified Juice._--After the clarification is completed\r\nthe further treatment of the juice is exactly the same as that for the\r\nsugar beet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.--TAPPING THE MAPLE TREES.--(_Courtesy Forest\r\nService, Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.--TRANSPORTING THE SAP TO THE SUGAR\r\nHOUSE.--(_Courtesy Forest Service, Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Manufacture of Maple Sugar.=--The maple trees in the United States\r\ngrow chiefly in the New England states, especially in Vermont, New\r\nYork, Ohio, and Indiana. Very little sugar is made in other states.\r\nThe season of manufacture is at the beginning of spring, when the\r\nsap first begins to run and before the buds of the new leaves have\r\ndeveloped very extensively. The season lasts from four to six weeks. In\r\nNew England it begins the latter part of March and in Ohio and Indiana\r\nin February. The trees are bored and a tubular spile driven into the\r\nwood through which the sap escapes into the bucket or other receptacle.\r\nFigs. 77, 78, and 79 are typical scenes in a small maple orchard during\r\nthe season, showing tapping of the trees and collection and boiling\r\nof the sap. The sap of the maple tree is extremely bright and clear\r\nand requires no clarifying. It is usually evaporated in open kettles\r\nor pans, the vacuum process not being employed. The crystallization\r\ntakes place at the final moment of evaporation and usually the whole\r\nmass is sold as sugar, forming what is known in the cane sugar industry\r\nas concrete. Maple sugar is never refined, since in the process of\r\nrefining the peculiar flavor and odor which give it its chief value\r\nwould disappear. The quantity of maple sugar made in the United States\r\nis almost negligible from a commercial point of view, amounting\r\nannually to only about 10,000 tons. Perhaps a greater quantity of maple\r\nsap is used in the form of sirup than of sugar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.--BOILING THE MAPLE SAP.--(_Courtesy Forest\r\nService, Department of Agriculture._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Refining of Sugar.=--All kinds of raw sugar but maple are refined\r\nbefore entering commerce. The public taste has demanded a pure white\r\nsugar and in so far as beet sugar is concerned the refining process is\r\na necessity, inasmuch as raw beet sugar has a very disagreeable soapy\r\ntaste and odor which render it unfit for consumption. On the other hand\r\nraw cane sugar is aromatic, fragrant, and delicious to a far greater\r\ndegree in the raw state than when it is refined, since after the\r\nrefining process it is difficult to distinguish the product of the beet\r\njuice from that of the sugar cane.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Process of Refining._--The manipulation attending the refining of\r\nsugar is a somewhat simple one, but experience has shown that it can\r\nonly be done economically in very large establishments, many of which\r\ncost millions of dollars. The attempt to refine sugar on a small scale\r\nmakes the product too expensive to compete commercially with the\r\nproduct of the large refinery. The raw sugar is first mixed with water\r\nand melted and reduced to the condition of a sirup. In this state it\r\nis treated with lime and clarified as has been described for sugar\r\ncane juice. Sometimes at this stage it is also treated with sulfur\r\nfumes, but not usually. After clarifying the juice is filtered through\r\nbags or filter presses so as to free it from all suspended matter. In\r\norder to decolorize it it is then passed through large cylinders filled\r\nwith bone-black from which it emerges quite or almost water-white.\r\nWhen the bone-black loses its decolorizing properties it is removed\r\nfrom the cylinder and reburned in closed retorts, by which process it\r\nregains its power to decolorize the sugar solution. The decolorized\r\njuices are next taken into vacuum strike pans, as has already been\r\ndescribed in the manufacture of sugar, only of a much larger size. In\r\nthese pans they are evaporated and crystallized and the sugar separated\r\nin centrifugals as described above. After the sugar comes from the\r\ncentrifugal it is placed in a granulating apparatus, a large revolving\r\ndrum supplied with a steam jacket from which it emerges dry. Granulated\r\nsugar is almost chemically pure, often containing 99.9 percent of\r\npure sugar. The molasses from the centrifugal is diluted, passed\r\nthrough bone-black, and reboiled and a new lot of sugar obtained.\r\nFinally when the product becomes so low in sugar as not to yield a\r\nwhite product lower grades of brown sugar are made, which are usually\r\nsold without drying and contain considerable quantities of moisture\r\nand some molasses. The final molasses which no longer crystallizes is\r\nsold usually for mixing with glucose to make table sirup. It contains\r\nso much mineral matter in solution as to be hardly suitable for food\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nLoaf sugar, cut loaf, etc., are forms of pure sugar which are pressed\r\nor cut in the forms in which they appear on the market and then dried\r\ninstead of being dried in a granulated state as described. Powdered\r\nsugar is dry refined sugar reduced to a fine powder.\r\n\r\nIn the refining of sugar it is quite customary to wash the crystals\r\nin the centrifugal with ultramarine blue suspended in water. This is\r\ndone in order to form with the blue water and the yellow tint, which\r\nsometimes accompanies the crystals, a perfectly white appearance, on\r\nthe optical principle which shows that when a blue and a yellow tint\r\nare mixed a white color results. This process is not required for the\r\nfirst-class product coming from the first crystallization and very\r\noften dealers require sugar for special purposes which has not been so\r\ntreated. It would be advisable if all consumers should demand a sugar\r\nof the same character.\r\n\r\nWhile the refining of sugar can probably never be abolished it should\r\nnot be forgotten that the very finest sugar, from a palatable point\r\nof view, is that made from the maple or sugar cane without refining\r\nin which the crystals retain their natural yellow color. If consumers\r\nunderstood thoroughly the value of a sugar of this kind they would\r\ndemand it instead of the dead white product which is now in vogue.\r\n\r\nAs has been stated a raw sugar of this kind could not be used if made\r\nfrom beets.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sugar Crops of the World.=--These figures include local consumption of\r\nhome production wherever known.\r\n\r\nWillett and Gray’s estimates

The product has grown so cheap not\r\nonly in the United States but all over the world that adulterations\r\nare no longer a paying process and whenever adulteration ceases to pay\r\nit requires no law to prevent it. White sugars have been adulterated\r\nfrom time to time by the admixture of white earth or terra alba (either\r\nground silicate, ground gypsum, or ground chalk). I have never found\r\nany adulteration of this kind in an American white sugar. White\r\nflour has also been added to sugar as an adulterant, but that form of\r\nadulteration is not known in this country. The only adulteration which\r\nis found in American sugar, in so far as I know, is that incident to\r\nthe process of manufacture which I have described. When sulfur is used\r\nin sulfuring the juice before clarifying a trace of sulfurous acid may\r\nstill adhere to the finished product. When bluing is used the particles\r\nof ultramarine blue attach themselves to the sugar crystals and become\r\nan adulteration. I have seen sugar so blued that on solution the water\r\nwould turn blue. Sugar granules are also sometimes washed with salts of\r\ntin, a very poisonous compound, and a trace of these salts may still\r\nadhere to the crystals. Sugar has also been mixed with dextrose made\r\nfrom starch, in other words, from starch sugar, or as it is ordinarily\r\ncalled, anhydrous grape sugar. This is a form of adulteration which\r\nhas been little practiced on account of the difficulty of getting a\r\ndry starch sugar in commercial quantities. Recent improvements in the\r\nmanufacture of dextrose have made it more probable that this form of\r\nadulteration may be more frequent in the future. As a food product\r\npure dextrose is probably as valuable as sugar, but if it can be\r\nmade cheaper it would become a fraudulent adulteration or if added\r\nin any way without notice its addition is fraudulent and constitutes\r\nan adulteration. There is little, however, to fear from this form of\r\nadulteration as long as the price of sugar does not go much above 5\r\ncents per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sugar as a Food.=--The food value of sugar is well defined. It\r\nfurnishes next to oil and fat the most complete food for heat and\r\nenergy that can be consumed, ranking, of course, as starch in this\r\nparticular. Sugar is a quick-acting food and therefore is especially\r\nvaluable to relieve exhaustion. It is particularly useful for\r\nsoldiers on a forced march or for people engaged in any extraordinary\r\neffort. A lump of sugar eaten occasionally keeps up the strength and\r\nprevents exhaustion. The value of sugar as a food is not appreciated\r\nas it should be, since it is valued mostly for its condimental and\r\npreservative properties.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIRUP.\r\n\r\nA very common form in which sugar is used in this country is in the\r\nform of sirup. The United States more than any other nation consumes\r\nviscous liquid solutions of sugar as a condimental food product,\r\nespecially at breakfast on hot cakes and other articles of diet. Table\r\nsirup is an almost uniform article of diet upon the American breakfast\r\ntable whether in the household, the hotel, or restaurant.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Maple Sirup.=--Among the sirups, first of all must be mentioned the\r\nmost valuable and highly appreciated, namely, maple sirup. Maple sirup\r\nis the product of the evaporation of the juice of the sap of the maple\r\ntree to a consistency in which only about 25 or 30 percent of its\r\nweight is water. This is sufficient to prevent the crystallization of\r\nthe sugar for at least a reasonable length of time. Maple sirup is\r\nbest when freshly made, and if kept through the summer should be put in\r\ntins and tightly sealed while hot. In this condition it will keep its\r\noriginal flavor almost entirely, whereas if left in barrels or other\r\nordinary receptacles its flavor is impaired. Maple sirup is also made\r\nby dissolving maple sugar as occasion may require, but this kind is not\r\nso highly prized as that made directly from the maple sap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.--SMALL PRIMITIVE MILL FOR EXTRACTING JUICE FROM\r\nSUGAR CANE FOR SIRUP MAKING.--(_Photograph by H. W. Wiley._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Analysis of Maple Sirup._--The average composition of ten samples of\r\nmaple sirup of known purity is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Total solids,    70.50 percent\r\n  Water,           31.40    „\r\n  Ash,               .53    „\r\n  Sucrose,         64.10    „\r\n  Reducing sugar,   1.30    „\r\n\r\nThe study of the ash of maple sirup is an important point in connection\r\nwith its purity. It is distinctly different from the ash of the sugar\r\ncane and sorghum, and its study should not be neglected in all cases\r\nwhere there is any doubt respecting the genuineness of the samples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.--MILL AND EVAPORATING APPARATUS FOR SIRUP\r\nMAKING IN GEORGIA.--(_Bulletin 70, Bureau of Chemistry._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.--RELATIVE LENGTH OF CANES USED FOR SIRUP\r\nMAKING.--(_Photograph by H. W. Wiley._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cane Sirup.=--Sugar cane sirup is made by expressing the juice of\r\nthe sugar cane as described, clarifying, and evaporating the juice\r\nto a consistency where only about 25 or 30 percent of the water\r\nremains, which is sufficient to prevent the sugar from crystallizing\r\nfor a reasonable length of time. Sugar cane sirup is made in hundreds\r\nof small factories in the states of Texas, Louisiana, Alabama,\r\nMississippi, Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida. It is usually\r\nmade in a small way with mills driven by a horse or mule and with\r\nprimitive methods of evaporation in an ordinary kettle. Hard pine wood\r\nis burned for the evaporation and the empyreumatic flavor of the pine\r\nis often absorbed by the sirup. In Figs. 80 and 81 are shown typical\r\napparatus used for the manufacture of sirup from sugar cane in Georgia\r\nand in Fig. 82 the relative length of canes ready for manufacture.\r\nIn factories where modern apparatus is used, in so far as I know,\r\nthe vacuum process is not employed. In fact, except for economy of\r\nfuel, the vacuum process would be objectionable, since by boiling in\r\nan ordinary open kettle a larger quantity of sugar is inverted and\r\nthus the tendency to crystallization is diminished. It is a common\r\nbut reprehensible practice in making sugar cane sirup to subject the\r\nfreshly expressed juice to the fumes of burning sulfur. This makes a\r\nlight-colored sirup but introduces a substance highly objectionable\r\nand one which destroys to a certain degree the flavor of the product.\r\nExperiments made by the Department of Agriculture show that delicious,\r\nwholesome, and palatable sugar cane sirup is best made by clarifying\r\nthe expressed juice solely by means of heat and mechanical separation\r\nof the coagulum. The addition of lime or any other clarifying\r\nreagent is unnecessary and only makes a sirup of less desirable and\r\nless palatable quality. Since cane sirup is made uniformly in open\r\nkettles or pans there is a slight caramellization of the sirup during\r\nevaporation which gives a reddish tint to the product, which should\r\nbe a mark of superiority instead of being so often regarded as a mark\r\nof inferiority. The consumer should always be suspicious of a sugar\r\ncane sirup which is light in color. It is probably a case of “Greeks\r\nbearing gifts” in the form of sulfurous acid or other injurious\r\nbleaching materials. Sugar cane sirup is not appreciated by the people\r\nof the North. In fact it is rarely seen or consumed by them. In its\r\nown country, however, it is a staple article of diet, highly esteemed,\r\nwholesome, palatable, and nutritious.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Analysis of Sugar Cane Sirup._--The average composition of thirteen\r\nsamples of cane sirup of known purity is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Total solids,    75.0 percent\r\n  Water,           25.8    „\r\n  Ash,              1.2    „\r\n  Sucrose,         52.0    „\r\n  Reducing sugar,  17.6    „\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sorghum Sirup.=--The sorghum plant (_Sorghum saccharatum_) is grown\r\npractically in every state in the Union, but principally in Kansas.\r\nSome of the very best sorghum sirup made in the United States, however,\r\nis made in Minnesota, and this plant can be used for sirup making\r\npurposes over the whole area of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe method of manufacture is exactly that of sugar cane sirup. It is\r\nmade in small mills mostly driven by horse power, though some large\r\nfactories have steam apparatus for its manufacture. It should also\r\nbe made without the use of any other clarifying reagent than heat.\r\nSorghum sirup has a peculiar flavor which is not disagreeable to those\r\naccustomed to its use. It is extremely wholesome, highly nutritious,\r\nand palatable. It is a staple article of diet with thousands of\r\nfamilies in the United States, principally in the northern and central\r\nportion. It rarely is made in the New England states and not very often\r\nin those southern states where sugar cane can be used in its place,\r\nsince the sugar cane makes a sirup which is preferred by most people.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Analysis of Sorghum Sirup._--The average composition of ten samples of\r\nsorghum sirup of known purity is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Total solids,    76.0 percent\r\n  Water,           28.6    „\r\n  Ash,              4.0    „\r\n  Sucrose,         36.7    „\r\n  Reducing sugar,  26.6    „\r\n\r\n\r\n=Molasses.=--The term “molasses” is properly applied to the saccharine\r\nproduct which is separated from sugar in the process of manufacture. It\r\nis well to clearly discriminate in the use of the term in order that no\r\nconfusion or misunderstanding may arise. To this end the terms “sirup”\r\nand “molasses” may be contrasted. A sirup is the direct product of the\r\nevaporation of the juice of a sugar-yielding plant or tree without the\r\nremoval of any of the sugar. The term molasses applies to the same\r\nprocess with the exception of the fact that sugar has been removed\r\nat least partially by crystallization and some kind of mechanical\r\nseparation of the crystals from the remaining liquid. Molasses,\r\ntherefore, to use a term employed in chemistry, may be considered the\r\n“mother liquid” which has produced the crystallization of the sugar.\r\nThe production of molasses has already been sufficiently described\r\nin the article on sugar making. The molasses is either separated by\r\ngravitation as in the old style of drying sugar or, as at the present\r\ntime, almost exclusively by centrifugal action. The molasses naturally\r\ncontains all the substances in solution or suspension which are not\r\nretained upon the gauze of the centrifugal. It differs from the total\r\nmass of evaporated sugar liquid only in the fact that a large portion\r\nof the sucrose or crystallizible sugar has been separated. The sugar\r\njuices of the cane and sorghum contain considerable quantities of sugar\r\nof a kind different from sucrose or common sugar, namely, an invert\r\nsugar, a “reducing sugar,” as it is called, which consists usually\r\nof about equal parts of dextrose and levulose. During the process of\r\nmanufacture small portions of the sucrose are converted into sugar of\r\nthis kind thus increasing its quantity. In the final crystallization\r\nthere is always a portion of sugar uncrystallized remaining as a\r\nviscous liquid in contact with the crystallized particles. This natural\r\ninvert sugar which is in the juice, the small portion formed from the\r\nsucrose during the process of manufacture, and the part of sucrose\r\nremaining uncrystallized in the mother liquid constitutes the molasses.\r\nIn the washing of sugar the water which is used also passes into the\r\nmolasses thus diluting it somewhat from its natural consistence. In the\r\nsugar refinery the molasses is made up of practically such materials\r\nas just mentioned, but inasmuch as the separation of the sugar is\r\nmore complete the other portions of the molasses, namely, the mineral\r\nsalts, particularly appear in a very much larger proportion than in the\r\nordinary molasses as will be seen by the analysis of these bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Varieties of Molasses.=--_New Orleans Molasses._--The real New\r\nOrleans molasses is the product of the manufacture of sugar in the\r\nold-fashioned way in the open kettle and without the aid of vacuum\r\npans. In this process the crystallization of the sugar does not take\r\nplace during the boiling but the concentrated liquid is placed in tanks\r\nwhere the crystallization takes place. When this is complete it is\r\nbroken up into small fragments and placed in a hogshead standing in an\r\nupright position, the bottom of which is perforated and covered with\r\nstraw or fragments of sugar cane. When the hogshead is filled with\r\nthe crystallized mixture, through the action of gravity the liquid\r\nportion gradually sinks and passes out at the bottom of the hogshead.\r\nThis natural separation of the molasses makes a product of exquisite\r\npalatability and one of a character which it is difficult to equal even\r\nby the production of high-grade sirup. Before the Civil War this kind\r\nof molasses was used throughout the United States. At the present time\r\nonly extremely small quantities of it are made inasmuch as the open\r\nkettle process is practically a lost industry in the South. The term\r\n“New Orleans molasses” as used at the present day, therefore, applies\r\nto a product of quite a different character.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sugar Cane Molasses._--Since the introduction of modern processes\r\nof making sugar, namely the vacuum pan and centrifugal process, the\r\ncharacter of molasses from the sugar cane factory has constantly\r\ndeteriorated. This is a natural deterioration due to the improvement\r\nin the method of sugar making. Much larger quantities of sugar are now\r\nobtained in a crystallized state than formerly. The molasses is to this\r\nextent impoverished and the impurities contained therein increased\r\nproportionately. It is quite common now in the process of manufacture\r\nof sugar from sugar cane to secure at least three crystallizations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_First Molasses._--When the sugar is crystallized in the vacuum pans\r\nand separated from the molasses in the centrifugal the product which is\r\nobtained is called “first molasses.” Usually this molasses is diluted\r\nto a sirup and reboiled in connection with the clarified juices direct\r\nfrom the sugar cane and thus a second portion of sugar is obtained or\r\nthe molasses may be boiled separately and a second crystallization of\r\nthe sugar separated by the centrifugal. The molasses from this product\r\nis called “_second molasses_” and is inferior in quality to the first\r\nmolasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Third Molasses._--The second molasses is reboiled to a thick\r\nconsistency and placed in wagons, transferred to a warm room where it\r\nis allowed to remain, sometimes for two or three months, when a third\r\ncrystallization takes place. The sugar from this crystallization is\r\nseparated as usual by the centrifugal, and a third molasses produced of\r\nstill greater inferiority. Thus, in the best sugar factories high-grade\r\nmolasses is not made in the United States but only that of inferior\r\nquality. This molasses is largely used for fermentation, or is fed to\r\nthe mules on the plantations. It is also employed to a certain extent\r\nfor mixing purposes as indicated above.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Analysis of First, Second, and Third Molasses._--\r\n\r\n  -------+-------+------+------+------+------+--------+------+------\r\n         |       |      |      |      |      |        |      | ACIDS\r\n         | TOTAL |  SU- | DEX- | LEVU-|      | ALBU-  |      | AND\r\n         |SOLIDS.|CROSE.|TROSE.| LOSE.| ASH. |MINOIDS.|AMIDS.| GUMS.\r\n  -------+-------+------+------+------+------+--------+------+------\r\n         | _Per- |_Per- | _Per-| _Per-| _Per-|  _Per- | _Per-|_Per-\r\n         | cent._|cent._|cent._|cent._|cent._| cent._ |cent._|cent._\r\n  First, | 80.00 | 53.60| 8.76 |  8.00| 4.00 |  0.20  | 0.94 | 4.50\r\n  Second,| 80.00 | 41.70|12.20 | 12.50| 5.35 |  0.25  | 1.50 | 6.50\r\n  Third  | 80.00 | 31.70|15.00 | 16.50| 6.30 |  0.30  | 2.00 | 8.20\r\n  -------+-------+------+------+------+------+--------+------+------\r\n\r\nThe increasing content of dextrose and levulose, of ash, acids,\r\nand gums, and the decreasing content of sucrose or pure sugar are\r\ncharacteristic of the second and third molasses.\r\n\r\nThe above analyses show the progressive change in molasses due to\r\nthe separation of the successive portions of sugar and indicate the\r\nlowering of the quality of the molasses, at least for food purposes,\r\nas the separation of the sugar becomes more complete. It is evident\r\nthat in the manufacture of sugar in this way, in which very probably an\r\neffort is made to get the highest possible yield, the resulting final\r\nmolasses is a substance quite unfit for human consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sugar-house Molasses._--Attention has already been called to the\r\nproduction of sugar-house molasses or sugar refinery molasses. This\r\nis a product which in its physical appearance is far superior to the\r\nthird molasses of the sugar factory and this superiority is due to\r\nthe fact that all suspended matter in the refined molasses has been\r\nseparated by filtration. In so far as soluble materials which are not\r\nfood is concerned, however, the refinery molasses contains even larger\r\nproportions than the sugar factory molasses. The refinery molasses is\r\nnot usually considered suitable for food except when diluted as has\r\nbeen before indicated in the way of mixing sirup.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mixed Sirups.=--By far the greater part of the sirups used in the\r\nUnited States are mixtures of two or more saccharine substances. The\r\nglucose of commerce is the base and perhaps chief constituent of the\r\nmost of these mixtures. The glucose, being colorless and of a thick\r\nbody, forms an ideal base as far as physical properties are concerned,\r\nfor a table sirup. The quantity used varies very largely, but in\r\ngeneral the glucose constitutes by far the larger percentage of the\r\nmixed product. Since glucose has only a very slightly sweet taste\r\nand is devoid of the general palatable properties which make a sirup\r\nattractive, it is colored and flavored with the product of the sugar\r\ncane or the maple tree. Sorghum sirup is also used very extensively in\r\nmixing. The process of mixing is an extremely simple one. The glucose\r\nis warmed until it is easily workable and the added sirups or molasses\r\nwhich are used for coloring and flavoring mixed intimately with it. In\r\nlarge factories this is done by mechanical mixers while in a small way\r\nit may be done by hand. Instead of glucose, one sirup itself may be\r\nused as the base and mixed with another for flavor, as, for instance,\r\nin the case of mixed maple sirup. Very commonly the brown sugar is\r\nmelted with water and this is used as a base for the formation of\r\nsirups. Whichever may be the case the principle of the process remains\r\nthe same, namely, using as the base a cheaper and less palatable\r\nmaterial and flavoring and coloring with the more expensive and more\r\npalatable material. From a dietetic and commercial point of view there\r\ncan be no valid objection raised to this method of mixing sirups. The\r\nproduct is, as a rule, attractive, palatable, and wholesome.\r\n\r\nAttention has already been called to the fact that the final molasses\r\nin the sugar refinery, after all the sugar has been extracted that can\r\npossibly be gotten out by the most approved modern process, is used\r\nvery extensively for mixing purposes. This molasses has a very high\r\ncontent of soluble salts, reaching often 8 percent or more, which gives\r\na distinct flavor and character. It also has acquired a certain flavor\r\nfrom repeated filtering over bone-black and in general has a strong and\r\npronounced flavor which gives it a peculiar value as a flavoring agent.\r\nIt is also a clear product, free from suspended matter by reason of\r\nits repeated filtration. It can thus be mixed with glucose and forms\r\na bright mixture, devoid of suspended matter and turbidity, and is\r\nattractive to the eye. Ten percent of molasses of this kind added to\r\na glucose will make a mixture which is attractive and salable, and,\r\nit may also be added, palatable. The other products which are used\r\nfor mixing with the glucose in the manufacture of table sirup consist\r\nof the molasses obtained from cane sugar factories or the sirups\r\nmade directly from the sugar cane and sorghum. All these bodies have\r\nvaluable mixing properties and small quantities of them give sufficient\r\ncolor and flavor to the mixed product.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Mixed Sirups._--The adulteration of mixed sirups\r\nconsists chiefly of adulterations that are in the materials from\r\nwhich they are made. Glucose itself often contains sulfurous acid\r\nused for bleaching in the process of manufacture. It also contains\r\nconsiderable quantities of sulfate or chlorid of lime incident to its\r\nmanufacture and coming from the sulfuric or hydrochloric acid used\r\nin the hydrolysis of the starch from which it is made. The molasses\r\nwhich is used for coloring and flavoring may also contain injurious\r\nsubstances. For instance, sulfurous acid is very extensively used in\r\nthe manufacture of cane sugar and this acid becomes concentrated in\r\nthe molasses. Lime is used very extensively in the clarification of\r\nthe juices and this lime is not wholly separated but some of it is\r\nconcentrated in the molasses. A moderate amount of lime, however, is\r\nnot objectionable. Salts of tin are frequently employed in washing\r\nthe sugar in a centrifugal and these salts are found concentrated in\r\nthe molasses. The excess of bluing which is used in the centrifugal\r\nis also found in the molasses. Various forms of acid phosphates are\r\nfrequently employed in the clarifying of the cane juices and a part of\r\nthese is also found concentrated in the molasses. In fact the molasses\r\nfrom sugar cane factories very frequently contains such quantities of\r\nthese added substances as to render it unfit for human consumption.\r\nIt is true that these substances are diluted when mixed with glucose,\r\nbut this is not a sufficient excuse to warrant their employment. It\r\nis possible to obtain unobjectionable sirups and molasses for mixing\r\npurposes and manufacturers should be held strictly to account if\r\nthis is not done. In so far as has come to my knowledge there are no\r\nadulterants directly added to the mixed sirups except for bleaching\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nAttention should be called, however, to still another form of\r\nadulteration due to the fact that the molasses from the sugar cane\r\nfactories is often so dark-colored as to be even unfit for mixing.\r\n\r\nIn such cases it is not uncommon to bleach the molasses by adding zinc\r\nand acid producing nascent hydrogen and leaving the salts of zinc,\r\neither the sulfite or chlorid as the case may be, in the product.\r\nMolasses containing salts of any of these heavy metals, namely, zinc,\r\ntin, or lead, should be rigidly excluded from consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n=General Observations.=--If a sirup is to be considered in the light\r\nof the definitions already given, as the result of evaporation, after\r\nproper clarification of the saccharine juices of sugar-producing\r\nplants it is doubtful if the term should be used in connection with\r\nthe mixed products which have been described. I have used it because\r\nthese are the commercial designations. Since molasses is also used\r\nvery extensively in the manufacture of these mixed sirups it might be\r\nasked if they could not also be as properly called molasses as sirup.\r\nIn England the material which is called molasses in this country is\r\nusually known as treacle and the very dark molasses coming from the\r\nrefinery or the sugar factory is known in both countries as “black\r\nstrap.” If molasses be concentrated to a high degree and pulled while\r\ncooling the product is known as taffy in this country or toffy in\r\nEngland,--it is also known as molasses candy.\r\n\r\nThe general conclusion in regard to this matter is that since the\r\nprocesses of sugar making have been so improved as to extract the\r\ngreater part of the crystallizible sugar, thus concentrating the\r\nresidue of an inedible character in the molasses and since, further,\r\nthe use of various chemicals in the clarifying of sugar juices has\r\nbecome general, all of which are practically concentrated in the\r\nmolasses, this latter product has practically ceased to be edible.\r\n\r\nThe laws relating to the distillation of alcohol have been so amended\r\nas to permit the production of industrial alcohol, under conditions\r\nprescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, free of tax.\r\nMolasses is an excellent material for this purpose and, in addition\r\nto this, is the cheapest material which can be used. The obvious\r\ninference is that this material should be used exclusively for the\r\nproduction of industrial alcohol or for some other technical uses and\r\nno longer be prepared for human food. The production of straight, pure\r\nsirups from maple sap and the sap of the sugar cane and of sorghum and,\r\nin certain conditions, from sugar, can be easily secured in quantities\r\nsufficient to supply the demand not only for the consumption of pure\r\nsirups but also for supplying the materials which when mixed with pure\r\nglucose produce the mixed sirups of commerce. Thus inedible molasses\r\nwould be eliminated from human food and mixed sirups be rendered\r\nunobjectionable articles of diet.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONFECTIONERY.\r\n\r\nThe term confectionery is applied to a wide range of products which may\r\nin general be described as preparations of saccharine substances with\r\nvarious colors and flavors. A common appellation used in connection\r\nwith confectionery and one which describes perhaps the major part of\r\nthe product is the term “candy.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=Material Used in the Preparation of Confectionery.=--The saccharine\r\nmaterials which are employed in the preparation of confectionery are\r\nsugars of various kinds, namely, maple, cane, and beet sugar together\r\nwith glucose, dextrose, and invert sugar. Starch, which is not a\r\nsaccharine substance, is sometimes used as a filler in some forms\r\nof confectionery. The colors used are either those of a vegetable\r\ncharacter, such as saffron and annatto, or derived from the animal\r\nsubstances, such as cochineal, or more generally, that large class of\r\nbodies derived from coal tar and generally known under the name of\r\nanilin dyes. The flavors employed are either natural flavors, such as\r\nthose derived from nuts and fruits, or their preparations, extracts,\r\nsuch as the extract of vanilla, and synthetic preparations, including\r\na very large number of artificial flavoring materials resembling\r\nto a greater or less degree the natural flavor of fruits, nuts, or\r\nflowers. Chocolate is one of the most common and one of the most highly\r\nappreciated flavoring reagents employed, being largely mixed with sugar\r\nbefore using. Not to be included in the permissible materials in the\r\nmanufacture of confectionery are any powdered mineral substances or\r\nmineral substances of any kind (except such as are incident to the\r\nmanufacture of the product as the natural constituents of the raw\r\nmaterial), poisonous or harmful colors or flavors, and fermented,\r\nvinous, and distilled liquors and drugs of all kinds.\r\n\r\nUnder adulterations the question of what is harmful or hurtful in such\r\nmaterial will be more fully discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Method of Manufacture.=--Each manufacturer has his own method of\r\nmixing, flavoring, and coloring his products and these are mostly\r\ntrade secrets. A general statement, however, may be made regarding the\r\nmethod of procedure. The saccharine substances are usually dissolved\r\nin water and brought to the proper consistency by heating. The colors\r\nand flavors are added during such part of the process as is most\r\nfavorable to their incorporation and retention. The mass, when of the\r\nproper consistence, is molded into the various forms in which candies\r\nare found in commerce and in many cases polished in revolving drums of\r\ncopper or other polishing device. It would be useless to undertake,\r\neven if they were known, to describe the manifold methods employed to\r\nsecure the fancy and high-class confections which are found upon the\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Crystallized Fruits and Flowers.=--When fruits and flowers are treated\r\nwith sugar sirup which is subsequently allowed to crystallize there are\r\nproduced what is known as candied or crystallized flowers or fruit.\r\nThese substances in this case become confections and should be judged\r\nby the same standards as the straight candy.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Food Value of Candy.=--The food value of confectionery or candy is not\r\nas a rule considered, since it is eaten more for its flavor and general\r\npalatability and attractiveness than for its nutritive properties.\r\nNevertheless, the food value of candy is often very high and is\r\nmeasured chiefly by the sugars it contains.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Adulteration of Confections.=--The question of adulteration of\r\nconfectionery is one which is somewhat difficult to discuss, since\r\nin the definition of confectionery and candies the incorporation of\r\nadded harmless colors and flavors is regarded as a legitimate process.\r\nIt is evident that because a confection is colored or flavored there\r\nis no reason for the statement that it is adulterated. Confections\r\nnot being a natural product their coloring and flavoring cannot be\r\nregarded as deceptive since neither process can be used in any sense\r\nto deceive the purchaser. It follows, therefore, that any kind of a\r\nharmless coloring or flavoring material will be a legitimate addition\r\nto confectionery. The question, however, of what is harmful or harmless\r\nis one difficult to decide. The manufacturer of coloring and flavoring\r\nmaterials and the manufacturer of confectionery are always quite ready\r\nto certify that the colors and flavors used are harmless to health.\r\nOn the other hand the physiological chemist, who stands apart from\r\nthe commercial point of view, may be led with difficulty to adopt the\r\nsame conclusions. It is evident there are some colors, especially\r\nthose of a vegetable character, which must be regarded as harmless.\r\nNearly all vegetables contain natural coloring materials, either\r\nchlorophyll or derivatives therefrom, which are, without doubt, quite\r\nharmless. The addition of coloring matter of a vegetable character to\r\nconfectionery is not regarded as in any way a harmful or deleterious\r\ningredient to the product. The same may be said of animal coloring\r\nmatter, since there are also natural constituents of animal substances\r\nused such as cochineal, which, as is well known, is derived from an\r\ninsect, and hence the addition of such a substance to a food product\r\nmay be regarded in the present light of our knowledge as harmless.\r\nThere are also synthetical preparations which from a chemical point\r\nof view and in so far as known from the physical point of view are\r\nclosely identified with vegetable substances. These preparations\r\nmay, _a priori_, be regarded as substances not injurious to health.\r\nOn the other hand almost the whole range of mineral colors which\r\nformerly were so much used in tinctorial art, namely, the oxids and\r\nsalts of metals such as copper, chromium, lead, arsenic, etc., are\r\nregarded by practically all authorities as injurious substances and\r\nnot suitable for introduction into food products. There is left then\r\nfor consideration in this respect that vast body of coloring matters\r\nderived from coal tar and known in general as anilin dyes, whether\r\ndirectly made from anilin or not. On the question of wholesomeness of\r\nthese bodies there is much division of opinion. Of the many which are\r\nknown, however, only a few are regarded as harmless. Perhaps thirty\r\ndifferent dyes would cover the whole number which have been pronounced\r\nharmless by expert observers. The experts, however, who have rendered\r\ndecisions in this matter do not agree as to the harmlessness of the\r\nlist just mentioned. Some of them include some portions of the list and\r\nexclude others from their commendation. It so happens, therefore, that\r\nonly a few so-called anilin dyes have really escaped condemnation at\r\nthe hands of some of the experts. The general character of anilin dyes\r\nand the well known poisonous property of the radical from which they\r\nare derived leads to the supposition that it would be very unsafe in\r\nany case to make an absolute statement in favor of any of them. These\r\nbodies, as a rule, undergo no change in the metabolic processes. They\r\npass in and through the cellular tissues of the body and are excreted\r\nmostly in the urine and hence place a burden upon the excretory cells\r\nwhich, although light, is unnecessary. The possibility, too, might be\r\ntaken into consideration of a direct toxic effect which they may exert\r\nalthough in a minute degree upon the cell structures through which\r\nthey pass. It is certain that these bodies can exert no beneficial\r\neffect upon the structure of the cells and it is hardly likely, in\r\nthe doctrine of probabilities, that they should be neutral. It is\r\nadvisable, therefore, to suggest to the manufacturer of confectionery\r\nas well as of the other food products, but of confections in\r\nparticular, the wisdom of seeking some method of producing attractive\r\ncolors in their products among sources which are open to no suspicion.\r\nIt might be that this would be attended with some expense and that\r\nthe dyes which are unobjectionable may be more costly. This, however,\r\nshould be a matter of very small consideration to the manufacturer who\r\nhas the welfare of the public at heart. The price of confectionery, as\r\nis well known, is out of proportion to the prices of the raw materials\r\nof which it is made. The quantity of coloring matter which confections\r\ncontain is acknowledged to be minute so that whether the colors cost a\r\ndollar or five dollars a pound makes little difference in the actual\r\ncost of the product and the highest priced colors would not diminish\r\nthe percentage of profit to any noticeable degree.\r\n\r\nAside from the use of harmful colors and flavors, which are always\r\nto be regarded as adulterants, there are many other practices in\r\nconnection with the manufacture of confections that may be classed as\r\nobjectionable. Most of these have, however, been forbidden by law in\r\nthe states and in other countries and are now forbidden by our national\r\nlaw. The addition of ground mineral matter was long known as one of\r\nthe principal adulterations of confectionery. This, in my opinion, is\r\nno longer practiced in the United States. The substances used were\r\ncommonly known as terra alba, that is, ground talc, powdered silicates,\r\npowdered chalk, or ground marble--in fact any white powdered mineral\r\nsubstance. The object of this adulteration is manifestly to increase\r\nthe weight.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Poisonous Mineral Colors._--In the early days of the manufacturing\r\nof confectionery salts of lead and compounds of chromium, as well as\r\ncompounds of other metals such as copper, etc., were employed for\r\ncoloring purposes. The use of these bodies is now extremely rare,\r\nhowever, if it is ever practiced, and hence may be regarded as a\r\npractice of the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Glucose Containing Harmful Substances._--The bleaching of glucose by\r\nsulfurous acid naturally leads to the introduction into candies of this\r\nsubstance. It is present in minute quantities, however, and if the\r\nglucose is carefully made, I may add, in negligible quantities. The\r\ndanger of over-sulfuring must not be forgotten and it is difficult to\r\ndraw a line of demarkation between what may be regarded as negligible\r\nand injurious quantities. The abandonment, therefore, of the use of\r\nsulfur must be regarded as the only safe way of protecting the consumer\r\nagainst an adulteration of this kind. The use of poisonous flavoring\r\nis perhaps more extensive than is generally recognized, especially of\r\nthat flavor which is supposed to be characteristic of the kernel of\r\nthe peach, namely, benzaldehyde or its derivatives. There is also a\r\nsmall amount of hydrocyanic acid in the kernels of the peach, almond,\r\netc. This is a very deadly substance and no artificial preparation\r\nof it should ever be used. If there be any flavor of this kind in a\r\nconfection it should be derived solely from the almond or similar nuts\r\nwhich contain only minute traces. While nature, as is well known,\r\nplaces poisonous substances in many food products, they have been so\r\nskilfully combined as to render their effect the least harmful. When\r\nman produces a similar poisonous article artificially and adds it to\r\na food, the poisonous effect thereof is undoubtedly increased. Hence\r\nthe use of artificial harmful flavors of any kind in a food product,\r\nespecially confectionery, is utterly reprehensible and unpardonable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alcohol._--Alcohol has been placed in different forms in\r\nconfectionery, sometimes enclosed as drops within the saccharine\r\nsubstance. This must be regarded as an adulteration of a very\r\nreprehensible character, since these products are eaten so much by\r\nchildren and the danger of injury from the alcohol and the danger of\r\nforming a habit from eating it in this way is extremely great. This\r\nform of adulteration is specifically forbidden by the national law.\r\nIn view of the fact that children and young persons of both sexes,\r\nand especially girls, eat confectionery so largely it is incumbent\r\nupon every manufacturer to see that no raw material is employed in his\r\nprocesses and no flavoring or coloring or other added ingredient used\r\nwhich is in any way under suspicion as being a harmful or deleterious\r\nsubstance. Manufacturers should remember that a mere certificate of\r\npurity from the person making these substances is of little value\r\nwhatever. Even if the statements made in such certificates are true\r\nthey will always be under suspicion, because it would be supposed that\r\nthey were made for the purpose of furthering trade rather than for the\r\nprotection of the consumer. In the case of two experts of like honesty\r\nand like industry, one employed for the purpose of giving a certificate\r\nto the article of food and one whose researches are entirely\r\nindependent of any commercial relations, the public will generally give\r\nthe decision of the latter a greater weight. Inspection officers under\r\nstate and national food and drug acts should give especial attention to\r\nthe subject of confectionery as an article of diet almost universally\r\nemployed and consumed by a class of the community most susceptible to\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\n\r\nHONEY.\r\n\r\nHoney is defined as the nectar of flowers, gathered and stored by the\r\nhoney bee (_Apis melifica_). While the above is a good definition there\r\nis often found in honey saccharine exudations of the plant other than\r\nthe nectar of flowers. Many plants contain sugar in their saps and when\r\nan exudation of sap takes place and the water in the sap is evaporated\r\na saccharine residue remains which is also gathered by the bee. Many\r\ntrees, especially of the pine family, exude a sweet sap when stung by a\r\nkind of louse (aphis) and this is also gathered by the bees. Thus while\r\nthere may be other exudations of the plant found in honey the fact\r\nremains that the true honey is gathered exclusively from the nectar of\r\nthe flowering plant. A honey which is made by feeding bees sugar sirup\r\nor other artificial sugar food cannot be regarded as a genuine article.\r\nThe feeding of bees, while a strictly legitimate practice, should be\r\nconfined to keeping them over periods of famine or the keeping of them\r\nalive during the winter or at other times when they do not have access\r\nto the flowering plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Historical.=--Honey has been used by man for food from the remotest\r\nantiquity. In fact, in earlier times honey was the only sugar substance\r\nat the disposition of man. He had not yet learned the sources of great\r\nsupply which now are at his command or if he had he was not familiar\r\nwith the technical processes of preparing the commercial article.\r\nHoney is approximately a pure saccharine substance and this, in\r\naddition to its peculiar and, to most people, pleasant flavor, not only\r\ngave it a vogue in the earlier times of necessity but has maintained it\r\nin public favor when other and cheaper sources of saccharine substances\r\nhave been developed. In fact, at the present time it might be said\r\nthat honey owes its value upon the market not to the fact that it is\r\na saccharine body but that it contains flavors and aromas imparted to\r\nit by the flower and by the bee which render it a luxury rather than a\r\nnecessity of life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.--SWARM OF BEES ON BOUGH OF TREE.--(_Courtesy A.\r\nI. Root Co._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Preparation of Honey.=--While bees stored their honey in hollow\r\ntrees or other suitable places in earlier times this was a doubtful\r\nsource of supply. The bee tree is still an object of interest in every\r\nneighborhood. Many wild animals, especially bears, are very fond of\r\nhoney and these animals were the robbers of the honey bee in the days\r\nwhen such animals roamed the forests. Since the removal of the forests\r\nto such a large extent in the interest of agriculture the bee tree is\r\nbecoming a curiosity rather than a matter of common occurrence. Wild\r\nswarms of bees, therefore, at the present time, find other places\r\nfor building their hives than the hollows of trees. They are likely\r\nto light upon almost any point that affords them a temporary support\r\nand attempt, at least, to form a colony. Unless, however, they have\r\nsome natural protection such as that of a hollow tree, these attempts\r\nare usually unsuccessful. In Fig. 83 is shown a swarm of bees, which,\r\ngathering on the bough of a tree, have bent it to the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.--ARTIFICIAL BEE HIVES UNDER SHADE OF GRAPE\r\nVINE.--(_Courtesy of A. I. Root Co._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Artificial Hives.=--The artificial hive has now become an inseparable\r\nincident in bee culture. The various forms of hives and their relative\r\nmerits cannot be discussed in this manual. There are many special works\r\non bee culture in which all these mechanical appliances, which are so\r\nfavorable to the storing of large quantities of honey, are described.\r\nThe most approved form is that which permits the depositing of the\r\ncombs in small boxes which when filled usually weigh about one pound\r\nand which can be easily removed from the comb and are in a condition to\r\nsend to market. The proper method of locating bee hives is indicated in\r\nFig. 84.\r\n\r\nThe art of bee keeping is not easily acquired and it requires a\r\nnatural aptitude as well as long study and research to become an\r\nexpert bee keeper. Experts differ in their opinion respecting the\r\nrelative value of hives, and rival manufacturers also do much in the\r\nway of advertising one or another of these contrivances. All of them\r\nthat have merits are such as protect the bee, during the months when\r\nit is idle, from starvation and disease and afford it every possible\r\nfacility for storing its treasures during the season of activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Distribution of the Honey-producing Industry.=--Every part of the\r\nUnited States is suitable in some respects for the production of honey.\r\nNaturally the extreme northern portion, where the winters are very\r\nsevere, are less favorable than the southern portion for two reasons,\r\nfirst, the difficulty of keeping the bees over the winter is greater in\r\nthe North, and, second, the season of activity is much shorter. On the\r\nother hand the honey which is gathered from the northern flowers is, as\r\na rule, more highly prized than that gathered from the more southern\r\nregions. California, perhaps, is the greatest honey-producing state in\r\nthe Union, though portions of New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and\r\nmany other states have developed great industries. It is very common\r\nalso for the farmer to have a number of bee hives, particularly for\r\nstoring honey for domestic consumption, so that the making of honey is\r\nalmost as common on the farm as the making of butter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.--A FRAME CONTAINING 24 BOXES OF\r\nHONEY.--(_Courtesy A. I. Root Co._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Comb Honey.=--The honey which is produced in the hives and removed\r\nwithout extracting it from the comb is known as “comb honey.” As\r\nindicated above, at the present time large amounts of this product are\r\nmade by the filling of small boxes of a size intended for the market.\r\nThis is, by far, the most convenient method of handling the product.\r\nA frame showing 24 boxes of comb honey as withdrawn from the hive is\r\nillustrated in Fig. 85. It has also the additional merit of a practical\r\nguarantee of the product. In Fig. 86 is seen a box of honey in which\r\nthe capping is incomplete. Many mechanical attempts have been made\r\nto imitate the genuine comb and in many respects a certain degree of\r\nsuccess has been attained. In fact nearly all of the commercial comb\r\nhoney of the present day is made in combs built upon an artificial\r\nbase in which the cells of the comb are started and sometimes built\r\nto a considerable depth. The bee is then only required to fill out\r\nthe remaining portion of the cell and, after filling it with honey,\r\nto cover it over. Thus the labor of the bee is greatly diminished in\r\nrespect of comb building and its energies preserved for a greater\r\nproduction of honey. It must be admitted that honey preserved in the\r\ncomb has a delicacy and daintiness which does not attach to that\r\nwhich has been separated and sold in a liquid form. The comb honey,\r\ntherefore, commands a fancy price.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.--SHOWING BOX OF HONEY PARTIALLY\r\nCAPPED.--(_Courtesy A. I. Root Co._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Extracted Honey.=--Where honey is to be shipped to any great distance\r\nit is found difficult, if not impossible, to transport it in the\r\ncomb, since the jarring and exposure incident to transit break the\r\ndelicate cells and allow the honey to escape. For commercial purposes,\r\ntherefore, especially when honey is to be shipped to distant points,\r\nit is separated from the comb at the place of manufacture. The usual\r\nmethod of separation is by centrifugal force. The caps of the cells\r\nbeing removed, the boxes which contain them are placed in a centrifugal\r\nmachine and the honey forced out by centrifugal action. The boxes are\r\nthen returned to the hives where they are refilled by the bees. By this\r\nprocess extracted honey can be made in great quantities and for a much\r\nlower price than the same quantity of honey still held in the combs.\r\nThe principal objection to extracted honey is due to the fact that it\r\nhas been subjected to such extensive adulterations as will be mentioned\r\nfurther on. There can be no valid objection made to the character of\r\nextracted honey when it has been prepared under competent direction and\r\nwith the skill and care which are required by the professional honey\r\nmakers.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Strained Honey.=--Strained honey is a variety of extracted honey which\r\nfrom the broken or fragmentary combs is allowed to flow by gravity or\r\nby gentle pressure. In such cases, naturally, the cell or honey comb is\r\ndestroyed. The residual comb is sent to market as beeswax.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Properties of Honey.=--Honey at ordinary temperature is a viscous\r\nliquid of a tint varying from almost colorless to almost black,\r\naccording to the character of the flowers and the season in which it\r\nis gathered and the length of time of storage. It contains from 15\r\nto 25 percent of water and usually has a small quantity of foreign\r\nsubstances, incident to its manufacture, such as particles of dust,\r\npollen, fragments of bees, fragments of comb, etc. Honey, therefore,\r\nis a somewhat concentrated solution of sugars and these sugars are the\r\nnatural products of the flowers of plants, modified to some extent, by\r\npassing through the organism of the bee. In passage through the bee the\r\nhoney is impregnated with a small quantity of an acid, named from the\r\nant, formic acid. It also suffers other changes which are very strongly\r\nmarked in flavor and aroma but which cannot be very readily traced\r\nchemically.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Polarization.=--Pure honey, that is, honey gathered solely from\r\nthe saccharine exudations of flowers at the ordinary temperature of\r\nthe laboratory, namely, from 65 to 85 degrees F., has the faculty\r\nof turning a plane of polarized light to the left, which is just\r\nthe opposite of the optical properties of cane sugar. Whenever a\r\nhoney shows a right-handed polarization it is a cause for suspicion\r\nrespecting its purity. A honey of this kind has either been made by\r\nfeeding the bees a sugar sirup or by the gathering, on the part of\r\nthe bees, of the saccharine exudation, before alluded to, known as\r\nhoney dew. It is perfectly true that bees may have gathered honey in\r\nexceptional cases, that is, the saccharine exudations of the plants in\r\ngeneral, which will show a right-handed polarization, but this occurs\r\nso infrequently as to render it advisable to regard such a honey as\r\nabnormal in quality. The polariscope, therefore, becomes an almost\r\nindispensable implement in a study of the purity of honey.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Water.=--As has already been stated, the usual content of water in\r\nhoney is from 15 to 25 percent. It very rarely falls below 15 percent\r\nand also very rarely goes above 20 percent. In extremely dry periods\r\nit is evident that the content of water becomes less, while in times\r\nof rain or at the first advent of the flowers the content of water\r\nwill be greater. The bee naturally modifies to some extent the content\r\nof water in order that the organism may dispose of the product. If\r\nthe content of water is too small the bee handles the product with\r\ndifficulty and if the content of water is too large difficulty in\r\ngathering and storing the honey on account of the excessive fluidity\r\nis experienced. As before intimated, the color of the honey depends\r\nlargely upon the flower from which it is made. White clover gives a\r\nhoney almost water-white and among all the honey-producing flowers\r\nis perhaps regarded the most highly. On the other hand a plant like\r\nthe golden rod, which flowers later in the summer, produces honey of\r\na deep yellow and sometimes almost a black tint. The color of honey,\r\ntherefore, indicates not only the season of the year at which it is\r\nstored, becoming darker as the autumn advances, but also the nature of\r\nthe flower from which it is produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ash.=--The content of mineral matter in honey is extremely small and\r\nperhaps is largely due to the mechanical entanglement of dust in the\r\nnectar rather than the exudation of actual mineral matter itself from\r\nthe flower. In some cases the amount of mineral matter is so small as\r\nto become a mere trace while in other cases it has been found as high\r\nas .3 of one percent. A high content of ash denotes the exposure of the\r\nnectar previous to gathering to an infection of dust or to some other\r\nabnormal condition. A high ash content, therefore, always indicates\r\nthat further study should be made respecting the purity of the product.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sucrose.=--The amount of sugar (cane sugar) which is found in honey\r\nis in normal conditions not very large, but in exceptional cases the\r\nsugar content, that is, the sucrose content, may reach as high as 8 or\r\n10 percent. At such times the honey has only a slightly left-handed\r\npolarization or may become right-handed. Whenever the content of\r\nsucrose in honey reaches as high as 8 percent there is ground for\r\nsuspicion that the bees have been fed on sugar sirup, or that some\r\nother form of adulteration has been practiced.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dextrose and Levulose.=--The two principal saccharine components of\r\nhoney are the sugars known as dextrose and levulose, in other words,\r\ntaken together, inverted sugar, that is, sugar made by the inversion\r\nof cane sugar or sucrose. In the nectar of flowers these two sugars\r\nexist almost in the proportion which would be expected if they had been\r\nformed from sucrose or ordinary sugar by a simple chemical process.\r\nSometimes one of these sugars and sometimes the other may be in slight\r\nexcess. The names of these two sugars indicate their active properties.\r\nDextrose is a right-handed sugar, that is, it turns the plane of\r\npolarization to the right. In this respect it resembles sucrose or\r\nordinary cane sugar, although it is not so strongly right-handed.\r\nLevulose, as the name implies, is a sugar which turns the plane of\r\npolarization to the left. The temperature of the solution has a very\r\nmarked influence upon this active property,--the lower the temperature\r\nthe greater the left-handed rotation. A honey which has a strong\r\nleft-handed polarization, therefore, at ordinary temperature is one\r\nin which the levulose is present in full proportion or very slight\r\nexcess. The other constituents of honey, namely, the pollen which is\r\nmechanically entangled therein, the dust or dirt which is mechanically\r\nattached thereto, the formic acid imparted thereto by the bee, and the\r\nother ingredients, are extremely minute in quantity and are not, as a\r\nrule, expressed as percentage constituents. In fact the most of them\r\nare merely accidental constituents.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Adulteration of Honey.=--Perhaps there is no common food product,\r\nwith the possible exception of condimental substances such as pepper\r\nand spices, that has been subjected to such extensive and general\r\nadulterations as honey.\r\n\r\nThe high price of honey, its position as a luxury as well as a food\r\nproduct, and its attractive flavor and aroma have all combined to\r\nmake it a favorite product for adulteration. In addition to this the\r\ninvention in the last third of a century of an artificial product\r\nresembling honey very closely in its physical properties and being\r\nitself a saccharine body, namely glucose, has put into the hands of\r\nthe adulterator an ideal substitute for the natural product. There is\r\nonly one reason why the adulteration of honey with glucose has not been\r\nmore extensive than it is, namely, the ease with which the chemist can\r\ndetect it. The chemical properties of glucose are very distinct from\r\nthose of honey itself. In spite of this fact, however, the adulteration\r\nof honey has been most extensively exploited and until the methods\r\nof detecting it were developed it was almost universally practiced.\r\nGlucose is a water-white saccharine semi-viscous mass made by the\r\nhydrolysis of starch with an acid and therefore forms the body upon\r\nwhich the adulterated article can be built. It has a low saccharine\r\nvalue and cannot be used alone but must necessarily be mingled with the\r\nhoney. The amount of real honey used is, as a rule, a minimum to give\r\nthe flavor and taste of the genuine article to the admixture. It is\r\nbelieved at the present time that this method of adulterating honey is\r\nvery much less practiced than in former years and this is due, as has\r\nbeen said, to the ease with which it can be detected and also, it may\r\nbe added, to the increased rigidity of national, state, and municipal\r\ninspection, rendering it difficult to place an adulterated article such\r\nas this upon the market without detection. Incalculable harm has been\r\ndone to the honey trade of the country by the practice of this style of\r\nadulteration. Only liquid honey, that is separated or strained, can be\r\neasily adulterated with glucose. Often, however, an attempt has been\r\nmade to still further deceive the customer by placing a portion of the\r\ngenuine comb honey in a jar and then filling it with the adulterated\r\nmixture, giving the appearance of the genuine article to a certain\r\nextent to the whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration with Inverted Sugar._--A much more subtle form of\r\nadulteration, and therefore one much more difficult to detect, is the\r\nadulteration of honey with a sirup made from inverted sugar, that\r\nis, the product obtained from cane sugar by the action of a dilute\r\nacid. This chemical process, as has already been indicated, converts\r\nthe cane sugar into a mixture of dextrose and levulose. These sugars\r\nare identical, for chemical purposes, with the natural dextrose and\r\nlevulose of honey. The chemist, therefore, has a much more difficult\r\ntask to perform when he attempts to diagnose the presence of artificial\r\ndextrose and levulose in a mixture of the natural product. There\r\nare, however, certain qualities of ash, as well as other chemical\r\nconstituents, which guide him in his work. While his conclusions do not\r\nhave that definiteness which attaches to the examination of a honey\r\nadulterated with glucose they are sufficiently distinctive in most\r\ncases to determine whether or not a sophistication has been practiced.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration with Cane Sugar._--A very simple form of adulteration\r\nand one which cannot be practiced to any extent without being easily\r\ndetected is the admixture of a sirup of pure cane sugar to honey. As\r\nlong as the quantity added is not sufficient to change the optical\r\nproperties, so that the mixture becomes right-handed in its rotation,\r\nthe admixture of a small quantity of cane sugar sirup might escape the\r\ndetection of the chemist. Inasmuch, however, as cane sugar exists only\r\nin small quantities in honey the regular and persistent occurrence\r\nof much cane sugar in a honey would be a just cause for suspicion,\r\nalthough its occasional occurrence might be due to purely natural\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mince Meat.=--Under the term “mince meat” is included a large variety\r\nof mixtures used chiefly for pie making and composed of meats,\r\nfruits, evaporated fruits, spices, and sometimes alcohol in some of\r\nits forms. It is not possible to describe any particular combination\r\nwhich would be entitled to bear the name alone, since each housewife\r\nand each manufacturer follows a method of her and his own. A general\r\ndescription, however, may be given of the manufactured article which,\r\nunfortunately, has largely displaced the mince meat of domestic\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\nJudged by the name alone, meat of some kind would be an important\r\nconstituent of this substance. This, however, is not the case. Very\r\nfew of the mince meats contain more than 10 percent of meat, a large\r\nnumber contain less and quite a large number contain none at all. Suet\r\nand tallow are sometimes employed as a substitute for meat, which\r\napparently satisfies the conscience of the manufacturer even if it\r\ndoes not suit the palate of the consumer. Evaporated fruits, such as\r\nraisins, etc., form important constituents of the mixture and also\r\nfresh fruits, in domestic manufacture, are very often used. Spices of\r\nvarious kinds are also employed and the mixture is sometimes flavored\r\nwith brandy or some alcoholic beverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pressed Mince Meat._--The mixture which is above described may be\r\ndried and pressed, or pressed without drying, into a hard firm cake\r\nwhich renders it more suitable for transportation and improves its\r\nkeeping qualities. There is perhaps little difference between the\r\nunpressed and the pressed mince meat except in the matter of a binder.\r\nThe binder consists usually of starch or flour, which serves not only\r\nto give additional weight to the mixture but also to hold the particles\r\ntogether. Starch or flour is sometimes used in unpressed mince meat\r\nalso. There is another advantage in using starch or flour, namely, that\r\nthese bodies absorb large quantities of moisture and thus increase the\r\nweight of the mixture. Mince meat cannot be recommended on sanitary\r\ngrounds, since the method of manufacture is not always known and the\r\nmaterials from which it is made are not always selected with the sole\r\nview to the excellence of the raw materials and the health of the\r\nconsumer. The meat when used often represents waste material from the\r\ntable or factory and the fruits are not necessarily those which look\r\nbest but probably are those usually of the worst appearance and the\r\ncombinations are made with a view of meeting the ordinary demands of\r\nthe market rather than of catering to the tenets of sanitation.\r\n\r\nIt is not the intention of this manual to discourage any kind of\r\nlegitimate manufacturing industry, but, in view of the general\r\ncharacter of substances of this kind, if they are to be used at all,\r\nit seems advisable that they should be made in the home, of material\r\nselected by the housewife and in a manner which requires no special\r\ntreatment for its preservation, rather than to be purchased at random\r\nin the open market, made of materials of unknown origin put together by\r\nan unknown process.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Mince Meat._--Assuming that the materials which\r\nhave been selected are wholesome, sanitary, and of fine quality, the\r\nprincipal adulterations to which mince meat is subjected are the\r\naddition of chemical preservatives and artificial colors. Inasmuch as\r\nmince meat is not expected to be of any very definite color the use of\r\nartificial colors is not common. On the other hand when mince meat is\r\nmade in large quantities, transported long distances, and sometimes\r\nkept for a long while on the shelves of the grocery, the subject of\r\npreservation becomes a matter of serious importance. It is naturally\r\ninconvenient to preserve a mixture of this kind by sterilization,\r\nthough this has been accomplished. The method of drying and pressing\r\nhas already been described. This, of course, detracts somewhat from the\r\nphysical appearance of the product. The common method is the addition\r\nof a chemical preservative. At the present time I believe that benzoate\r\nof soda is the one very commonly used, and it will probably continue\r\nto be so used, by most manufacturers until national and state laws or\r\nan enlightened public opinion eliminate it from food products.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pie Fillers.=--Nearly allied to mince meat in its character is a large\r\nclass of substances known as pie fillers. Mince meat itself, as may\r\nbe seen from the description which has been given of it, is nothing\r\nbut a pie filler of a particular kind. Unfortunately the demand of the\r\ndomestic cuisine is for substances prepared, or partially prepared,\r\nfor immediate consumption. In this way the demand for predigested and\r\nprecooked food has become a very general one and the pie filler is a\r\nlegitimate effort on the part of the manufacturers to meet this growing\r\ndemand. It is far easier for domestic purposes to make a pie of an\r\nalready prepared material than to go to the trouble of constructing\r\nthe material in the kitchen. A housewife loses sight of the fact that\r\nthe fresh domestic pie is probably the only one which, for sanitary\r\nand other reasons, should be admitted to the table. As the pie fillers\r\nare as varied in character as the different kinds of pies from which\r\nthey are made, no definite standard can be prescribed for them. Fruits\r\nare, naturally, the predominating constituent in these fillers and\r\nthe condiments and spices used are certainly unobjectionable. If it\r\nbe possible to prepare spiced fruits and keep them until used for\r\npies there would seem to be no objection to the manufacture, long\r\nbefore using, of these substances in large quantities. The difficulty,\r\nhowever, of preserving the freshness and aroma of a fruit or other\r\nsubstance used for pie making is so evident as to need no particular\r\nemphasis.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Pie Fillers._--The common adulterations in pie fillers\r\nare artificial colors, when they are designed to represent fruit of a\r\nspecial character, and preservatives. The same remarks which were made\r\nrespecting these bodies in mince meat apply with equal force to all\r\nkinds of pie fillers. Bodies of this kind are evidently only properly\r\nmade on the premises where they are consumed and immediately used after\r\nmanufacture. The addition of artificial colors and preservatives in\r\nsuch substances, while apparently necessary in the present condition of\r\ntrade, is wholly objectionable from every other point of view, and in\r\nsuch case trade conditions should properly give way to the demands of\r\npublic and private sanitation and hygiene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART X.\r\n\r\nINVALIDS’ AND INFANTS’ FOODS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most important subjects in connection with the food supply\r\nis the study of the foods which are offered for the use of infants and\r\ninvalids. The demands of modern society, unfortunately, have deprived\r\nthe American infant in many cases of the food which Nature intended\r\nit to have. It is, therefore, a condition, rather than a theory,\r\nconfronting the feeding of the American infant. It often is a choice\r\nbetween starvation and an artificial food. A most self-evident fact\r\nin connection with infant food is that until an infant reaches the\r\nage when it is naturally weaned it should have as a food only milk.\r\nThe common substitute for mother’s milk is cow’s milk. The important\r\npoint in this connection is that the milk should be from a healthy\r\ncow, kept in a sanitary condition, and the milk should be secured in\r\nthoroughly sanitary ways. These methods of preparing milk are, in fact,\r\nthe practical result of modern sanitary theories. The composition of\r\ncow’s milk is not that of mother’s milk. It contains more protein and\r\nless milk sugar than the normal milk of the mother. For this reason\r\nthe cow’s milk is often modified to bring it into nearer relationship\r\nto the natural mother’s milk. When this is done under scientific\r\ndirections and according to a prescription furnished by a competent\r\nphysician or physiologist there is no objection to its use provided\r\nit is accomplished without exposure of the milk to bacteria or other\r\ncontamination. The addition of drugs to milk in its preparation for\r\ninfants’ use cannot be generally commended. The citrate of lime or\r\nlimewater is one of the substances which is often added to milk, and\r\nthat, too, by the direction of a physician. There are conditions of\r\ndisease in infants where such a modification is advisable, but it is\r\ndoubtful if it is ever so in the case of a healthy child. The same\r\nremark may be made respecting the limewater.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Composition of Modified Milk.=--Proteids and ash in cow’s milk are\r\nmuch higher than in human milk and are brought to the proper degree of\r\nreduction by blending with other milk and diluting the milk with water.\r\n\r\n  ---------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n           |     |       |       |DILUTED|DILUTED\r\n           |COW’S|DILUTED|DILUTED| THREE |  FOUR\r\n           |MILK.| ONCE. | TWICE.| TIMES.| TIMES.\r\n  ---------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n  Proteids,| 4.00|  2.00 |  1.35 |  1.00 |  0.80\r\n  Ash,     | 0.70|  0.35 |  0.23 |  0.18 |  0.14\r\n  ---------+-----+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n\r\nThe ingredients commonly employed for modified milk are (1) cream\r\ncontaining 16 percent of fat; (2) centrifugally skimmed milk by which\r\nthe fat has been removed; (3) milk sugar or a standard solution of milk\r\nsugar of say 20 percent strength; and (4) lime water.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Formulæ._--It is obviously impossible to establish formulæ universally\r\napplicable even to healthy infants, but the following may be regarded\r\nas typical, representing the composition of a modified milk, to suit\r\nthe needs of an average growing infant during its first year:\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+----------+----------+----------\r\n   PERIOD.             |   FAT.   | PROTEIDS.|  SUGAR.\r\n  ---------------------+----------+----------+----------\r\n                       |_Percent._|_Percent._|_Percent._\r\n   3 to 14 days,       |    2     |   0.6    |   6\r\n   2 to  6 weeks,      |    2.5   |   0.6    |   6\r\n   6 to 11 weeks,      |    3     |   1.0    |   6\r\n  11 weeks to 5 months,|    3.5   |   1.5    |   7\r\n   5 to  9 months,     |    4     |   2      |   7\r\n   9 to 12 months,     |    4.5   |   2.5    |   3.5\r\n  ---------------------+----------+----------+----------\r\n\r\n(Albert E. Leach, “Food Inspection and Analysis.”)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Solid Infant’s Food.=--A large number of infant foods in the solid\r\nstate are upon the market. These have been studied very carefully by\r\nmany observers with a view not only of determining their chemical\r\nproperties but also their relative digestibility. These prepared infant\r\nfoods are not always made in harmony with the natural demands of young\r\nchildren. As has just been indicated, they are not, as a rule, suitable\r\nfor infants before the time of weaning, being better adapted to the use\r\nof young children. In the following tables are the data representing\r\nthe chemical composition of some of the common infants’ foods.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Invalid Foods.=--The term “invalid foods” is applied to almost every\r\nkind of a concoction containing a food substance which is administered\r\nto an invalid or convalescent, often for medical purposes rather than\r\nfor real nutrition. Chief among these invalid foods may be mentioned\r\nthe meat extracts containing that portion of the meat soluble in hot\r\nwater. These bodies consist chiefly of meat bases together with certain\r\nsoluble salts and it has long been recognized that they have very\r\nlittle nutritive value. They are also found in concentrated or even a\r\ndry state. The unconcentrated invalid foods of this class sometimes\r\ncontain glycerol (glycerine) or alcohol as a preservative. There are\r\nalso many forms of meat juice supposed to be the direct extract by\r\npressure or otherwise of the natural juice of the meat. Since these\r\nbodies could not be preserved otherwise than by sterilization, which\r\nwould coagulate the albuminous portion, they are often preserved\r\nby the addition of glycerine or some other antiseptic substance.\r\nIt is doubtful if any of these preserved bodies are proper food\r\nfor a deranged stomach either in the case of a real invalid or of a\r\nconvalescent.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these there are a great many so-called predigested\r\nor precooked foods which are largely advertised for certain forms\r\nof deranged digestion or malnutrition. The market is flooded with\r\nbrain foods, nerve foods, etc., which, if they were as poor as their\r\nadvertising claims are exaggerated, would be sorry substitutes for\r\nthe natural food which grown people eat. Fortunately these foods are\r\noften far better than one would suppose and many of them are wholly\r\nunobjectionable in character in so far as composition is concerned,\r\nthough the price which one must pay for these nutrients seems out of\r\nall proportion to the actual cost of the raw material. Following are\r\ndata showing the composition of some of the more important foods which\r\nare advertised as having curative or medicinal qualities or as suitable\r\nfor infants and invalids, and thus are brought prominently to the\r\nattention of the invalid or convalescent.\r\n\r\n  ------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-----\r\n        |      |      |      |      |      | COLD |\r\n        |      |      |      |      |  RE- | WATER|\r\n        |      |      |      | PRO- |DUCING|  EX- | DEX-\r\n        |WATER.| ASH. | FAT. |TEIDS.|SUGAR.|TRACT.|TRIN.\r\n  ------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-----\r\n        | _Per-| _Per-| _Per-| _Per-| _Per-| _Per-| _Per-\r\n        |cent._|cent._|cent._|cent._|cent._|cent._|cent._\r\n  No. 1,| 3.76 | 3.02 | 6.30 |  9.21| 52.50| 78.76| Much\r\n  No. 2,| 2.12 | 4.34 | 8.70 | 14.02| 49.02| 75.80|  „\r\n  No. 3,| 1.96 | 3.85 | 0.60 | 11.06| 57.96| 81.10|  „\r\n  No. 4,| 3.25 | 2.20 | 5.65 |  8.66|  ... | 82.00| 11.50\r\n  No. 5,| 1.37 | 1.63 | 4.75 |  9.13|  ... | 46.57| 11.02\r\n  No. 6,| 7.09 | 0.42 | 0.23 | 14.48|  ... |  3.58|  1.74\r\n  No. 7,| 5.73 | 0.86 | 1.00 | 10.41| 26.32| 34.57|  7.30\r\n  No. 8,| 1.55 | 1.20 | 1.10 |  5.69| 57.57| 50.05| Much\r\n  ------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------------\r\n\r\nThe above data give a general view of the relations of nutrient in\r\nfoods of this class. The percentage of mineral matter varies chiefly in\r\nproportion to the varying content of common salt. The fat varies from\r\none to about nine percent. Protein exists in quantities from nearly six\r\nto 15 percent. Sugar constitutes the predominant nutritive component of\r\nalmost all these bodies, only one showing a small percentage thereof.\r\nIt is evident that if any one of these types of food be regarded as a\r\nstandard nearly all the others would prove objectionable.

named.\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., _June 26, 1906_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER OF SUBMITTAL.\r\n\r\n  THE HONORABLE THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE:\r\n\r\n_Sir_: The undersigned, representing the Association of Official\r\nAgricultural Chemists of the United States and the Interstate Food\r\nCommission, and commissioned by you, under authority given by the\r\nact of Congress approved March 3, 1903, to collaborate with you “to\r\nestablish standards of purity for food products and to determine what\r\nare regarded as adulterations therein,” respectfully report that they\r\nhave carefully reviewed, in the light of recent investigations and\r\ncorrespondence, the standards earlier recommended by them and have\r\nprepared a set of amended schedules, in which certain changes have been\r\nintroduced for the purpose of securing increased accuracy of expression\r\nand a more perfect correspondence of the chemical limits to the normal\r\nmaterials designated, and from which standards previously proclaimed\r\nfor several manufactured articles have been omitted because of the\r\nunsatisfactory condition of trade nomenclature as applied thereto; and\r\nalso additional schedules of standards for ice creams, vegetables and\r\nvegetable products, tea, and coffee. They respectfully recommend that\r\nthe standards herewith submitted be approved and proclaimed as the\r\nestablished standards, superseding and supplementing those established\r\non December 20, 1904, and March 8, 1906.\r\n\r\nThe principles that have guided us in the formulation of these\r\nstandards are appended hereto.\r\n\r\nThe several schedules of additional standards recommended have been\r\nsubmitted, in a tentative form, to the manufacturing firms and the\r\ntrade immediately interested, and also to the State food-control\r\nofficials for criticism.\r\n\r\n  Respectfully, WILLIAM FREAR,\r\n  EDWARD H. JENKINS,\r\n  M. A. SCOVELL,\r\n  H. A. WEBER,\r\n  H. W. WILEY,\r\n  _Committee on Food Standards, Association of Official Agricultural\r\n  Chemists._\r\n  RICHARD FISCHER,\r\n  _Representing the Interstate Food Commission._\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _June 26, 1906._\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPLES ON WHICH THE STANDARDS ARE BASED.\r\n\r\nThe general considerations which have guided the committee in preparing\r\nthe standards for food products are the following:\r\n\r\n1. The standards are expressed in the form of definitions, with or\r\nwithout accompanying specifications of limit in composition.\r\n\r\n2. The main classes of food articles are defined before the subordinate\r\nclasses are considered.\r\n\r\n3. The definitions are so framed as to exclude from the articles\r\ndefined substances not included in the definitions.\r\n\r\n4. The definitions include, where possible, those qualities which make\r\nthe articles described wholesome for human food.\r\n\r\n5. A term defined in any of the several schedules has the same meaning\r\nwherever else it is used in this report.\r\n\r\n6. The names of food products herein defined usually agree with\r\nexisting American trade or manufacturing usage; but where such usage\r\nis not clearly established or where trade names confuse two or more\r\narticles for which specific designations are desirable, preference is\r\ngiven to one of the several trade names applied.\r\n\r\n7. Standards are based upon data representing materials produced\r\nunder American conditions and manufactured by American processes or\r\nrepresenting such varieties of foreign articles as are chiefly imported\r\nfor American use.\r\n\r\n8. The standards fixed are such that a departure of the articles\r\nto which they apply, above the maximum or below the minimum limit\r\nprescribed, is evidence that such articles are of inferior or abnormal\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n9. The limits fixed as standard are not necessarily the extremes\r\nauthentically recorded for the article in question, because such\r\nextremes are commonly due to abnormal conditions of production and are\r\nusually accompanied by marks of inferiority or abnormality readily\r\nperceived by the producer or manufacturer.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOD STANDARDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. ANIMAL PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. MEATS AND THE PRINCIPAL MEAT PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\n\r\na. MEATS.\r\n\r\n1. _Meat_, _flesh_, is any clean, sound, dressed, and properly prepared\r\nedible part of animals in good health at the time of slaughter, and\r\nif it bears a name descriptive of its kind, composition, or origin,\r\nit corresponds thereto. The term “animals,” as herein used, includes\r\nnot only mammals, but fish, fowl, crustaceans, mollusks, and all other\r\nanimals used as food.\r\n\r\n2. _Fresh meat_ is meat from animals recently slaughtered and properly\r\ncooled until delivered to the consumer.\r\n\r\n3. _Cold storage meat_ is meat from animals recently slaughtered and\r\npreserved by refrigeration until delivered to the consumer.[37]\r\n\r\n  [37] The establishment of proper periods of time for cold storage is\r\n  reserved for future consideration when the investigations on this\r\n  subject, authorized by Congress, are completed.\r\n\r\n4. _Salted_, _pickled_, and _smoked meats_ are unmixed meats preserved\r\nby salt, sugar, vinegar, spices, or smoke, singly or in combination,\r\nwhether in bulk or in suitable containers.[38]\r\n\r\n\r\nb. MANUFACTURED MEATS.\r\n\r\n1. _Manufactured meats_ are meats not included in paragraphs 2, 3, and\r\n4, whether simple or mixed, whole or comminuted, in bulk or in suitable\r\ncontainers,[38] with or without the addition of salt, sugar, vinegar,\r\nspices, smoke, oils, or rendered fat. If they bear names descriptive of\r\nkind, composition, or origin, they correspond thereto, and when bearing\r\nsuch descriptive names, if force or flavoring meats are used, the kind\r\nand quantity thereof are made known.\r\n\r\n  [38] Suitable containers for keeping moist food products such\r\n  as sirups, honey, condensed milk, soups, meat extracts, meats,\r\n  manufactured meats, and undried fruits and vegetables, and wrappers\r\n  in contact with food products, contain on their surfaces, in\r\n  contact with the food product, no lead, antimony, arsenic, zinc,\r\n  or copper, or any compounds thereof or any other poisonous or\r\n  injurious substance. If the containers are made of tin plate they\r\n  are outside-soldered and the plate in no place contains less than\r\n  one hundred and thirteen (113) milligrams of tin on a piece five (5)\r\n  centimeters square or one and eight-tenths (1.8) grains on a piece\r\n  two (2) inches square.\r\n\r\n  The inner coating of the containers is free from pin-holes, blisters,\r\n  and cracks.\r\n\r\n  If the tin plate is lacquered, the lacquer completely covers the\r\n  tinned surface within the container and yields to the contents of\r\n  the container no lead, antimony, arsenic, zinc, or copper or any\r\n  compounds thereof, or any other poisonous or injurious substance.\r\n\r\n\r\nc. MEAT EXTRACTS, MEAT PEPTONES, ETC.\r\n\r\n(Schedule in preparation.)\r\n\r\n\r\nd. LARD.\r\n\r\n1. _Lard_ is the rendered fresh fat from hogs in good health at the\r\ntime of slaughter, is clean, free from rancidity, and contains,\r\nnecessarily incorporated in the process of rendering, not more than one\r\n(1) percent of substances, other than fatty acids and fat.\r\n\r\n2. _Leaf lard_ is lard rendered at moderately high temperatures from\r\nthe internal fat of the abdomen of the hog, excluding that adherent to\r\nthe intestines, and has an iodin number not greater than sixty (60).\r\n\r\n3. _Neutral lard_ is lard rendered at low temperatures.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. MILK AND ITS PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\n\r\na. MILKS.\r\n\r\n1. Milk is the fresh, clean, lacteal secretion obtained by the complete\r\nmilking of one or more healthy cows, properly fed and kept, excluding\r\nthat obtained within fifteen days before and ten days after calving,\r\nand contains not less than eight and one-half (8.5) percent of solids\r\nnot fat, and not less than three and one-quarter (3.25) percent of milk\r\nfat.\r\n\r\n2.

S. Inspected and Passed._”--This phrase shall mean that the\r\ncarcasses, parts of carcasses, meats, and meat food products so marked\r\nare sound, healthful, wholesome, and contain no dyes, chemicals,\r\npreservatives, or ingredients which render meats or meat food products\r\nunsound, unhealthful, unwholesome, unclean, or unfit for human food.\r\n\r\n_Rendered into Lard or Tallow._--This phrase shall mean that the\r\ncarcasses, parts of carcasses, meats, and meat food products so\r\ndesignated have been passed for the preparation of lard or tallow only.\r\n\r\n“_U. S. Inspected and Condemned._”--This phrase shall mean that the\r\ncarcasses, parts of carcasses, and meat food products so marked are\r\nunfit for food and shall be destroyed for food purposes.\r\n\r\n_Carcass._--This word shall mean an animal that has been killed under\r\nthese regulations, including all parts which are to be used for food.\r\n\r\n_Primal Parts of Carcass._--This phrase shall mean the usual sections\r\nor cuts of the dressed carcass commonly known in the trade, such as\r\nsides, quarters, shoulders, hams, backs, bellies, etc., and entire\r\nedible organs, such as tongues, livers, etc., before they have been\r\ncut, shredded, or otherwise subdivided preliminary to use in the\r\nmanufacture of meat food products.\r\n\r\n_Meat Food Products._--This term shall mean any product used for food\r\ninto the composition of which any portion of the carcass enters, or in\r\nthe preparation of which any portion of the carcass is used, including\r\nlard, mince-meat, extracts, gelatin, oleomargarine, butterine, soups,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n_Vinegar._--The word vinegar, as used herein, shall mean cider vinegar,\r\nwine vinegar, malt vinegar, sugar vinegar, glucose vinegar, or spirit\r\nvinegar, as defined by the Committee on Food Standards in Circular No.\r\n10, Secretary’s Office, United States Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTE-MORTEM EXAMINATION AND INSPECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULATION 13.\r\n\r\nAn ante-mortem examination and inspection shall be made of all cattle,\r\nsheep, swine, and goats about to be slaughtered before they shall be\r\nallowed to enter an establishment at which inspection is maintained.\r\nSaid examination and inspection shall be made in the pens, alleys,\r\nor chutes of the establishment at which the animals are about to\r\nbe slaughtered. The proprietors of the establishments at which the\r\nsaid ante-mortem inspection is conducted shall provide satisfactory\r\nfacilities for conducting said inspection and for separating and\r\nholding apart from healthy animals those showing symptoms of disease.\r\n\r\nAll animals showing symptoms or suspected of being affected with any\r\ndisease or condition which, under these regulations, would probably\r\ncause their condemnation when slaughtered, shall be marked by affixing\r\nto the ear or tail a metal tag as provided in Regulation 20.\r\n\r\nAll such animals, except as hereinafter provided, shall be slaughtered\r\nseparately, either before regular slaughter has commenced or at the\r\nclose of the regular slaughter, and shall be duly identified by a\r\nrepresentative of the establishment to the inspector on duty on the\r\nkilling floor before the skins are removed or the carcasses opened for\r\nevisceration.\r\n\r\nAnimals which have been tagged for pregnancy and which have not been\r\nexposed to any infectious or contagious disease are not required\r\nto be slaughtered, but before any such animal is removed from the\r\nestablishment the tag shall be detached by a Department employee and\r\nreturned with his report to the inspector in charge.\r\n\r\n(_a_) If any pathological condition is suspected in which the question\r\nof temperature is important, such as Texas fever, anthrax, pneumonia,\r\nblackleg, or septicemia, the exact temperature should be taken. Due\r\nconsideration, however, must be given to the fact that extremely high\r\ntemperatures may be found in otherwise normal hogs when subjected\r\nto exercise or excitement, and a similar condition may obtain to a\r\nless degree among other classes of animals. Animals commonly termed\r\n“downers,” or crippled animals, shall be tagged, as provided for in\r\nRegulation 20, in the abattoir pens for the purpose of identification\r\nat the time of slaughter, and shall be passed upon in accordance with\r\nthese regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOST-MORTEM INSPECTION AT TIME OF SLAUGHTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULATION 14.\r\n\r\nThe inspector or his assistants shall, at the time of slaughter, make a\r\ncareful inspection of all animals slaughtered.

Suitable racks or metal\r\nreceptacles shall be provided for retaining such parts.\r\n\r\nCarcasses and parts thereof found to be sound, healthful, wholesome,\r\nand fit for human food shall be passed and marked as provided in these\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\nShould any lesion of disease or other condition that would probably\r\nrender the meat or any organ unfit for food purposes be found\r\non post-mortem examination, such meat or organ shall be marked\r\nimmediately with a tag, as provided in Regulation 27. Carcasses which\r\nhave been so marked shall not be washed or trimmed unless such washing\r\nor trimming is authorized by the inspector.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISPOSAL OF DISEASED CARCASSES AND ORGANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULATION 15.\r\n\r\nThe carcasses or parts of carcasses of all animals which are\r\nslaughtered at an establishment where inspection is maintained, and\r\nwhich are found at time of slaughter or at any subsequent inspection to\r\nbe affected with any of the diseases or conditions named below shall\r\nbe disposed of according to the section of this regulation pertaining\r\nto the disease or condition. It is to be understood, however, that\r\nowing to the fact that it is impracticable to formulate rules covering\r\nevery case, and to designate at just what stage a process becomes\r\nloathsome or a disease noxious, the decision as to the disposition\r\nof all carcasses, parts, or organs not specifically covered by these\r\nregulations shall be left to the veterinary inspector in charge.\r\nCarcasses found, before evisceration has taken place, to be affected\r\nwith an infectious or contagious disease, including tuberculosis, shall\r\nnot be eviscerated at the regular killing bed or bench, but shall\r\nbe taken to the retaining room, or other specially prepared place,\r\nseparate from other carcasses, and there opened and examined.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Anthrax, or Charbon._--All carcasses showing lesions of this\r\ndisease, regardless of the extent of the disease, shall be condemned\r\nand immediately tanked, including the hide, hoofs, horns, viscera,\r\nfat, blood, and all other portions of the animal.

unwholesome, or which contain dyes,\r\nchemicals, preservatives, or ingredients which render such meat or meat\r\nfood products unsound, unhealthful, unwholesome, or unfit for human\r\nfood, and all such condemned meat food products shall be destroyed\r\nfor food purposes, as hereinbefore provided, and the Secretary of\r\nAgriculture may remove inspectors from any establishment which fails to\r\nso destroy such condemned meat food products: _Provided_, That, subject\r\nto the rules and regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture, the\r\nprovisions hereof in regard to preservatives shall not apply to meat\r\nfood products for export to any foreign country and which are prepared\r\nor packed according to the specifications or directions of the foreign\r\npurchaser, when no substance is used in the preparation or packing\r\nthereof in conflict with the laws of the foreign country to which said\r\narticle is to be exported; but if said article shall be in fact sold\r\nor offered for sale for domestic use or consumption, then this proviso\r\nshall not exempt said article from the operation of all the other\r\nprovisions of this act.\r\n\r\nThat when any meat or meat food product

(_Act of July 1,\r\n1902._)\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 2.)\r\n\r\n  OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL RELATING TO THE SCOPE AND MEANING OF\r\n  THE ACT OF JULY 1, 1902 (32 STAT., 632), REGULATING THE BRANDING OF\r\n  DAIRY AND FOOD PRODUCTS FOR INTERSTATE COMMERCE.[48]\r\n\r\n  [48] Published as an unnumbered circular, Office of the Secretary.\r\n\r\n  _August 1, 1903._\r\n\r\nIn order that a correct understanding might be had as to the scope\r\nof the law relating to the branding of dairy and food products,\r\nthe opinion of the Attorney-General was asked concerning certain\r\nfeatures of that act. Samples of labels which were used in commercial\r\noperations were submitted, with the request that an opinion be given\r\nas to whether or not they conformed to the provisions of the law. Two\r\nseparate opinions were asked of the Attorney-General in regard to this\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nFirst, in the case of a firm, ---- ----, established in one State and\r\ndealing in goods which were grown and manufactured in another State,\r\nthe labels, however, bearing the name and address of the firm in its\r\ncentral place of business, the direct question asked was:\r\n\r\n  Is not the label as it stands a distinct statement that the product\r\n  bearing it is manufactured and prepared in (address of the firm\r\n  given)?\r\n\r\nOne particular object of the law appears to be to prevent the\r\nutilization of the name of localities which have become noted for the\r\nproduction of a certain food product in connection with other food\r\nproducts of a similar nature made elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe second point on which the opinion of the Attorney-General was asked\r\nwas as follows:\r\n\r\n  The question which I desire to propose to you now is, whether, under\r\n  the provisions of the two acts referred to (Public--No. 158, approved\r\n  March 3, 1903, regulating the importation of goods, and the act first\r\n  mentioned above) it will be possible to prevent the misbranding of\r\n  foreign products. In other words, would the provisions of Public--No.\r\n  223, referred to first above, apply to any foreign product entering\r\n  into interstate commerce, or do they apply only to articles of food\r\n  of domestic manufacture?\r\n\r\nFrom correspondence conducted with large manufacturing firms, it is\r\nevident that they desire at once to conform to the provisions of these\r\nlaws if they can only be distinctly made known. To this end I have\r\ndeemed it advisable to publish the decisions of the Attorney-General on\r\nthese questions, omitting merely the names of the firms specifically\r\nreferred to, for the information of manufacturers, dealers, and\r\nconsumers.\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE,\r\n  _Washington, D. C., June 22, 1903_.\r\n\r\n  THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\nSIR: I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th\r\ninstant, inclosing one addressed to you by the ---- ---- Company, of\r\nMilwaukee, Wis., together with two samples of labels which they have\r\nsubmitted for your approval, and in which you say:\r\n\r\n  These labels do not seem to fall within either class on which you\r\n  passed your opinion of September 20. The goods described by these\r\n  labels purport to be in every respect goods manufactured by the ----\r\n  ---- Company. They say in their letter, however, that they purchase\r\n  all their goods in Iowa.\r\n\r\n  The question which I desire to propound particularly in this respect\r\n  is the following: Is not the label of ---- ----, as it stands, a\r\n  distinct statement that the product bearing it is manufactured and\r\n  prepared in Wisconsin?\r\n\r\nOne of the labels considered in the opinion of September 20 (24\r\nOpin., 125) read: “Packed for ---- ---- Company (Limited), wholesale\r\ngrocers, Shreveport, La.” The other omitted the words “Packed for”\r\nand “Wholesale grocers,” and was in these words: “The ---- Brand Lima\r\nBeans, ---- ---- Company (Limited), Shreveport, La.” They were held\r\nnot to come within the act of July 1, 1902, c. 1357 (32 Stat., 632),\r\nregulating this subject.\r\n\r\nThe labels now submitted (which are to be used on canned goods) are\r\nsubstantially alike in form and character. One bears the words “----\r\n---- Daisy Sugar Corn, ---- ---- Company, Milwaukee, Wis.” In the\r\nother, “Tip Top” takes the place of the word “Daisy.”\r\n\r\nSection 1 of the act of July 1, 1902, provides--\r\n\r\n  That no person or persons, company or corporation, shall introduce\r\n  into any State or Territory of the United States or the District of\r\n  Columbia from any other State or Territory of the United States or\r\n  the District of Columbia, or sell in the District of Columbia or\r\n  in any Territory any dairy or food products which shall be falsely\r\n  labeled or branded as to the State or Territory in which they are\r\n  made, produced, or grown, or cause or procure the same to be done by\r\n  others.\r\n\r\nSection 2 makes a violation of the act a misdemeanor, punishable by a\r\nfine of not less than $500 or more than $2,000.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of September 20, after stating that the mere omission\r\nof the place of manufacture can not be said to constitute a violation\r\nof the law and that the name of the wholesale dealer on the label or\r\nbrand is not necessarily a representation that he is the producer\r\nor manufacturer of the goods, it was observed: “Of course, if goods\r\nare manufactured or produced in one State, and the wholesale dealer\r\nis a resident of another, and the label or brand is so worded as to\r\nrepresent the dealer as the producer, there would be a violation of the\r\nlaw if such commodities were introduced into one state from another.”\r\n\r\nThe ---- ---- Company, it is stated, purchases all their goods in Iowa.\r\nBut the words “---- Daisy Sugar Corn, ---- ---- Company, Milwaukee,\r\nWis.,” clearly imply that the goods referred to are manufactured or\r\nprepared by that company in Wisconsin. The general public, unfamiliar\r\nwith trade practices, would inevitably reach that conclusion. It seems\r\nto me, therefore, that these labels come within the statute as above\r\nconstrued. To hold otherwise would be to say that nothing short of\r\ndirect and positive misrepresentation is inhibited. But that is more\r\nthan the rule as to the strict construction of penal statutes can be\r\nsaid to require. The act in question aims to prevent the false labeling\r\nor branding of food and dairy products entering into interstate\r\ncommerce. It does not, however, undertake to say what shall be held\r\nto constitute a false label or brand. Each case must therefore rest\r\nupon its own particular facts. But wherever the natural inference to\r\nbe drawn from the form or words of a brand or label is contrary to the\r\nfact as to the State or Territory in which the articles referred to are\r\nmade, produced, or grown, the case would seem to be within both the\r\nletter and the spirit of the law.\r\n\r\nThe papers inclosed are herewith returned as requested.\r\n\r\n  Respectfully,\r\n  P. C. KNOX, _Attorney-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE,\r\n  _Washington, D. C., June 18, 1903_.\r\n\r\n  The Honorable the SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\nSIR: In your note of June 2, 1903, you transmit to me an excerpt\r\nfrom the appropriation act of March 3, 1903 (32 Stat., 1157,\r\n1158), authorizing the Secretary of Agriculture to investigate the\r\nadulteration of foods, drugs, and liquors, and forbidding the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury to deliver to the consignee any such goods imported\r\nfrom a foreign country which the Secretary of Agriculture has “reported\r\nto him to have been inspected and analyzed and found to be dangerous\r\nto health, or which are forbidden to be sold or restricted in sale in\r\nthe countries in which they are made or from which they are imported,\r\nor which shall be falsely labeled in any respect in regard to the place\r\nof manufacture or the contents of the package,” and a copy of the act\r\nof July 1, 1902 (32 Stat., 632), in regard to the introduction into any\r\nState or Territory or the District of Columbia of any dairy or food\r\nproducts which shall have been falsely labeled or branded as to the\r\nState or Territory in which they are made, produced, or grown; and you\r\nask my opinion, in substance, whether, under the provisions referred\r\nto, you have jurisdiction or power to prevent the false labeling or\r\nbranding of such articles imported from foreign countries after they\r\nhave passed the custom-house and are delivered to the consignees;\r\nand whether the act last referred to above applies to such articles\r\nimported from foreign countries, or applies only to articles of\r\ndomestic production.\r\n\r\nIn reply to your question, I have the honor to say that, under the\r\nprovisions of the act of March 3, 1903, to which you refer, the\r\njurisdiction and power of your Department, and that of the Treasury\r\nDepartment, in respect of the matter here considered, end with the\r\ndelivery of the imported article from the custom-house to the owner or\r\nconsignee, and this provision of the act confers no power to prevent\r\nor punish the false labeling or branding of such imported articles\r\nafter such delivery to the owner or consignee. The whole power there\r\nconferred in this respect is to examine such imported articles before\r\nsuch delivery, and to refuse delivery if found to come within the ban\r\nof the act. Whatever power there may be to prevent or punish the false\r\nlabeling or branding of such imported goods after such delivery must be\r\nlooked for elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIf the evils of false labeling of such imported articles have reached\r\na magnitude requiring Congressional legislation, it would seem almost,\r\nor quite, as important to prevent such false labeling after the\r\narticles have passed the custom-house as before; and it would seem that\r\nCongress, while having the matter directly in hand, has omitted what\r\nwould have been very appropriate legislation. But this omission cannot\r\nbe supplied by those called upon to interpret or administer the law.\r\n\r\nBut I think the act of July 1, 1902, may be resorted to for partial\r\nrelief from the evil to which you refer. The first section provides:\r\n\r\n  That no person ... shall introduce into any State or Territory of the\r\n  United States or the District of Columbia, from any other State or\r\n  Territory of the United States or the District of Columbia, or sell\r\n  in the District of Columbia or in any Territory, any dairy or food\r\n  products which shall be falsely labeled or branded as to the State\r\n  or Territory in which they are made, produced, or grown, or cause or\r\n  procure the same to be done by others.\r\n\r\nThe second section provides the penalty for violation of the act.\r\n\r\nThe prohibition is of the introduction into any State or Territory\r\nor the District of Columbia from any other State or Territory or the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, and the sale in said District or any Territory,\r\nof dairy or food products which are “falsely branded or labeled as to\r\nthe State or Territory in which they are made, produced, or grown.”\r\n\r\nIt is important to notice that the prohibition extends to falsely\r\nlabeled articles introduced or brought from another State or Territory,\r\nand is not confined to articles which are made, produced, or grown\r\nin some other State or Territory of the United States. If dairy or\r\nfood products which are falsely labeled or branded as to the State or\r\nTerritory of their origin are introduced or brought into one State or\r\nTerritory or the District of Columbia from another State or Territory\r\nor the District of Columbia, or are sold in any Territory or said\r\nDistrict, this is clearly within the prohibition of the act, no matter\r\nwhether such articles were of domestic or foreign origin. I repeat\r\nthe section does not confine or purport to confine its prohibition to\r\nthe introduction of falsely labeled articles made, grown, or produced\r\nin this country, but extends it to all such articles introduced from\r\nanother State or Territory which are falsely labeled “as to the State\r\nor Territory in which they are made, produced, or grown.”\r\n\r\nBut, as I have stated above, the act can give only partial relief.\r\nFor it is plain from the context that the words “State or Territory”\r\nrefer to a State or Territory of the United States, and can not be\r\nextended to include the wider signification of foreign country. Thus,\r\nif articles of foreign origin are imported into New York, for example,\r\nand thence introduced into another State or Territory with a label or\r\nbrand falsely stating their origin as to another foreign country, the\r\ncase would not fall within the provisions of the statute. On the other\r\nhand, it is certain that if foreign articles imported into New York\r\nare introduced into another State or Territory with a label or brand\r\nshowing them to be of New York make or growth, such articles would be\r\n“falsely labeled or branded as to the State or Territory in which they\r\nare made, produced, or grown,” and such introduction would be within\r\nboth the letter and the spirit and purpose of the act.\r\n\r\nIn this respect Congress can interfere only with interstate trade. It\r\ncan prevent the use of false labels of dairy or food products only\r\nwhen they become objects of commerce between different States or\r\nTerritories. Hence, the prohibition is confined to articles introduced\r\nfrom one State or Territory into another. But this does not imply,\r\nnor is there anything to imply, that the prohibition is confined also\r\nto articles made, produced, or grown in the State or Territory from\r\nwhich they are introduced, or to articles of domestic origin. It is the\r\nuse of false labels on dairy and food products in interstate commerce\r\nwhich is prohibited. And if it is interstate commerce, it is quite\r\nunimportant whether the articles falsely labeled were of domestic or\r\nforeign origin. If an imported article of foreign origin is labeled as\r\nof domestic origin, the article is “falsely labeled or branded as to\r\nthe State or Territory in which it is made, produced, or grown;” and\r\nif such article, thus falsely labeled, is introduced from one State or\r\nTerritory into another or the District of Columbia, it is a violation\r\nof the act. Nor does it make any difference in this respect whether the\r\nfalse label or brand be placed on the article before or after leaving\r\nthe custom-house in a case of foreign importation.\r\n\r\nIf it were required, a familiar rule of construction might be invoked\r\nin support of this interpretation. Statutes should be construed in aid\r\nof their manifest purpose and object. And when it is considered that\r\nthe sole purpose of this act is to prevent the use of false labels or\r\nbrands of dairy or food products, when articles of interstate commerce,\r\nit is manifest that a construction which limits the prohibition to\r\ndomestic articles would defeat rather than aid the purpose of the act.\r\nIndeed, the greater and more prevalent evil in this respect is not\r\nin falsely stating a particular State or Territory as the origin of\r\na domestic article, but is the labeling of a foreign article as the\r\nproduct of some particular State or Territory, or vice versâ. This is\r\nthe more serious and prevalent evil, and in my opinion is as certainly\r\nforbidden by the act referred to as is the labeling of an article of\r\none State or Territory as being the product of another.\r\n\r\nI am, therefore, of opinion that the act of July 1, 1902, applies not\r\nonly to domestic articles, but also to those imported from foreign\r\ncountries which are labeled as being of domestic origin.\r\n\r\n  Respectfully,\r\n  P. C. KNOX, _Attorney-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 3.)\r\n\r\nNOTICE TO EXPORTERS OF WINES.\r\n\r\nA RECENT LAW PASSED BY THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC.\r\n\r\n  _November, 1904._\r\n\r\nThe Argentine Republic has passed a new law relating to wines, and\r\nespecially covering the conditions under which wines are to be imported\r\ninto that country from foreign countries. There are many provisions of\r\nthe law which should be known to the producers and exporters of wines\r\nfrom the United States. The full text of the new law of the Argentine\r\nRepublic is given below:\r\n\r\n  ARTICLE 1. Only those wines obtained by the fermentation of fresh\r\n  grapes, or simply _estacionado_, will be considered as natural wines\r\n  in the Argentine Republic.\r\n\r\n  ARTICLE 2. For the purpose of the present law and of its penal\r\n  dispositions the following will not be considered as natural wines:\r\n\r\n  1. Those manufactured with dried grapes.\r\n\r\n  2. Those manufactured with the cluster (bunch).\r\n\r\n  3. Those to which there shall have been added substances which,\r\n  though natural in natural wines, alter the composition of them or\r\n  modify the equilibrium of the substances composing a natural wine.\r\n\r\n  4. Red wines containing more than 3.5 percent or less than 2.4\r\n  percent of dry extract, the reducing sugar having been deducted. The\r\n  executive is empowered to authorize a lower limit to the minimum\r\n  below for bottled or dessert wines.\r\n\r\n  5. White wines containing less than 1.7 percent of dry extract, the\r\n  reducing sugar having been deducted, with the exception of fine wines\r\n  in bottles.\r\n\r\n  6. Mixtures of wines enumerated in the five preceding paragraphs with\r\n  natural wines.\r\n\r\n  ARTICLE 3. The following will be considered as lawful œnological\r\n  practices:\r\n\r\n  For musts: The addition of saccharose (sugar), of concentrated must,\r\n  of citric, malic, tartaric, and sulfurous acids, pure and neutralized\r\n  by pure potassium and calcium carbonates.\r\n\r\n  For wines: The addition of citric, tartaric, malic, tannic, and\r\n  carbonic acids, of potassium and calcium carbonate, of neutral\r\n  potassium tartrate, of sulfites of sodium and calcium, and of pure\r\n  sulfurous anhydrids.\r\n\r\n  Pure kaolin and pure albumens and gelatins may be employed in the\r\n  clarification of wines.\r\n\r\n  ARTICLE 4. It is absolutely forbidden to add to the wine or to sell\r\n  as such--\r\n\r\n  1. Liquids containing foreign coloring matters, glucose from starch,\r\n  mineral acids, saccharin and other artificial edulcorant matters,\r\n  _abrastol_, salicylic acid and others analogous thereto, salts of\r\n  aluminum, strontium, barium, lead, and, in general, all bodies not\r\n  normally existing in the musts of grapes.\r\n\r\n  2. Wines containing more than 2 grams of sulfate per liter. A larger\r\n  proportion will not be tolerated except for dessert wines.\r\n\r\n  3. Wines containing more than 0.2 percent of sodium chlorid.\r\n\r\n  4. Wines containing per liter more than 200 milligrams of sulfurous\r\n  acid and 20 milligrams of free sulfurous anhydrid.\r\n\r\n  5. Damaged wines or wines altered in consequence of disease may\r\n  not be sold nor made the object of commerce. These liquids shall\r\n  be distilled under supervision of agents of the Treasury or of the\r\n  national chemical laboratories, and only the alcohols resulting from\r\n  their distillation may be utilized.\r\n\r\n  ARTICLE 5. The executive is empowered to augment or modify the\r\n  authorized œnological corrections in conformity with the progress of\r\n  science and the local conditions. He is empowered to add, likewise,\r\n  to those specified in the present law other substances recognized as\r\n  injurious by their quantity or quality.\r\n\r\n  ARTICLE 6. The following treatments followed in the preparation of\r\n  fine wines are considered legal:\r\n\r\n  1. The mixture of several natural wines produced from different\r\n  classes of grapes or from different harvests.\r\n\r\n  2. Limited alcoholization in order to insure the preservation of wine.\r\n\r\n  3. The addition of concentrated must and of pure alcohol in order to\r\n  obtain special dessert wines.\r\n\r\n  4. The addition of saccharose (sugar), of alcohol, of aromatic and\r\n  bitter substances, in order to obtain wines whose composition is\r\n  similar to vermouth or medicinal wines.\r\n\r\n  5. The addition of anhydrous carbonic acid and sugar for the\r\n  preparation of sparkling wines. The alcoholization authorized by the\r\n  present law is for the purpose of insuring the preservation of wine.\r\n  The alcohol employed for this purpose and all other products, the\r\n  usage of which is authorized, must be chemically pure.\r\n\r\n  ARTICLE 7. The beverages enumerated in article 2 and all other\r\n  similar beverages shall bear the name of “artificial beverages,”\r\n  whatever be their nature or process of manufacture, with the\r\n  exception of sparkling wines, vermouth, medicinal wines, and cider.\r\n\r\n  ARTICLE 8. In case natural wines should contain a proportion of dry\r\n  extract inferior or superior to that indicated in paragraphs 4 and\r\n  5 of article 2, the source of this extract will be determined in\r\n  so far as it concerns the wine of the country by the analysis of\r\n  grapes serving for the manufacture of this wine, and in so far as it\r\n  concerns foreign wines by information based on official analytical\r\n  data and of origin.\r\n\r\n  .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .\r\n\r\n  ARTICLE 10. Beverages which do not comply with the conditions\r\n  determined by article 1 may not be imported, circulated, or offered\r\n  for sale as natural wines, and must bear upon a part visible to\r\n  the recipient the indication of the classification to which they\r\n  correspond according to article 7 above.\r\n\r\n  ARTICLE 11. Foreign wines which shall be imported into the territory\r\n  of Argentine for consumption must be sold in the original casks\r\n  showing their origin, or put in bottles under the supervision of\r\n  Government agents and accompanied by certificates of analysis from\r\n  the country where they have been made. Imported wines containing more\r\n  than 3.5 percent of dry extract free from reducing sugar shall be\r\n  sold under the supervision of Government agents.\r\n\r\n  ARTICLE 12. Foreign wines shall be subjected to chemical analysis\r\n  upon their entrance into the country; native wines shall be subjected\r\n  to the same treatment before being delivered for consumption. This\r\n  analysis will be made in the national laboratories established or to\r\n  be established in Buenos Ayres, Rosario, Mendoza, San Juan, Entre\r\n  Rios, Cordoba, Catamarca, Salta, and Tucuman, and in other localities\r\n  where the Government may decide to establish them.\r\n\r\n  .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .\r\n\r\n  ARTICLE 14. The infractions of the provisions of article 10 of the\r\n  law shall be punishable by the confiscation of the merchandise\r\n  with or without a penalty of 50 centavos per liter or of a month’s\r\n  imprisonment of the offenders for each 1,000 liters of liquid or\r\n  fraction thereof.\r\n\r\n  ARTICLE 15. The infractions of the provisions of article 4 shall\r\n  be punished by the destruction of the wines and a fine of 30 paper\r\n  centavos per liter, or five days’ imprisonment for each 1,000 liters\r\n  of liquid or fraction thereof.\r\n\r\n  .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .\r\n\r\n  ARTICLE 19. The rules and proceedings established by law No. 3884\r\n  will remain in force. From January 1, 1905, foreign wines containing\r\n  more than 3.5 percent dry extract, free of reducing sugar, shall be\r\n  subjected to the provisions of the tariff.\r\n\r\nAttention is particularly called to the character of the wines which\r\nwill be admitted and the fact that such wines should be accompanied by\r\nan official certificate of composition and also of origin. Under the\r\nauthority of Congress the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to\r\nfurnish analyses and certificates of food products intended for export\r\nto foreign countries (F. I. D. No. 1).\r\n\r\nUnder this law exporters who desire analyses of their products to show\r\nthat they are in conformity with the laws of the country to which they\r\nare exported may apply to the Bureau of Chemistry of the Department\r\nof Agriculture for such an investigation. The analysis blanks for\r\nmaking the application, instructions for taking the samples, and form\r\nof affidavit to accompany the samples will be furnished intending\r\nexporters on application. In this connection attention is called to the\r\nfact that often American food products are rejected at foreign ports,\r\nand as a result thereof complaint is made to the State Department\r\nand samples of the rejected foods are furnished for analysis. The\r\nDepartment of Agriculture always complies with the requests of the\r\nState Department for assistance in adjusting difficulties of this kind.\r\nIt is evident, however, that all such difficulties would be avoided by\r\nshippers taking advantage of the provision of the law quoted above, to\r\nsecure the proper certification of their products before shipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 4.)\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS TO IMPORTERS OF FOOD PRODUCTS.[49]\r\n\r\n  [49] Circular No. 18, Bureau of Chemistry, U. S. Dept. Agr.\r\n\r\n  _August 6, 1904._\r\n\r\nIn order to facilitate the execution of this law [F. I. D. No. 1]\r\nand to avoid any unnecessary delay in the inspection of products\r\non arrival, the attention of importers is called to the following\r\nsuggestions:\r\n\r\n1. The inspection of food products includes foods, beverages, and\r\ncondiments, and ingredients of such articles.\r\n\r\n2. The inspection, under the language of the law, relates to the\r\nfollowing points:\r\n\r\n(_a_) To ascertain if the imported products be injurious to health.\r\n\r\n(_b_) If they be falsely branded or labeled in regard to the contents\r\nof the packages.\r\n\r\n(_c_) If they be falsely branded or labeled as to the place of\r\nmanufacture or production.\r\n\r\n(_d_) If they be forbidden entry to or be restricted in sale in the\r\ncountry in which they are made or from which they are exported.\r\n\r\n3. A food product, in the absence of contrary judicial interpretation,\r\nwill be deemed by the Department of Agriculture to be adulterated--\r\n\r\n(_a_) If any valuable ingredient naturally present therein has been\r\nextracted.\r\n\r\n(_b_) If a less valuable ingredient has been substituted therefor.\r\n\r\n(_c_) If it be colored, powdered, or polished, with intent to deceive,\r\nor to make the article appear of a better quality than it really is.\r\n\r\n(_d_) If it be a substitute for or imitation of a genuine article and\r\noffered under the name of that article.\r\n\r\n4. Products will be deemed injurious to health in the absence of\r\ncontrary judicial determination--\r\n\r\n(_a_) If any substance, with the exception of the long-used, well-known\r\ncondimental substances, viz., common salt, spices, sugar (sucrose or\r\nsaccharose), wood smoke, and vinegar be added thereto for preserving,\r\ncoloring, or other purposes, which is injurious to health, either as\r\ndetermined by actual experimental evidence or in the predominating\r\nopinion of health officers, hygienists, and physiological chemists.\r\n\r\n(_b_) If the products be decomposed, filthy, decayed, or in any unfit\r\ncondition for human consumption.\r\n\r\n5. Products will be considered by the Department as misbranded in the\r\nabsence of contrary judicial determination--\r\n\r\n(_a_) If any false name or property be assigned thereto in the label,\r\ndirectly or by implication.\r\n\r\n(_b_) If any false statement be contained in the label relating to the\r\nplace of manufacture or production of the contents of the package,\r\ndirectly or by implication.\r\n\r\n(_c_) If they be not of the nature, substance, and quality commonly\r\nassociated with the name under which they are sold or offered for sale.\r\n\r\n6. Food products will also be excluded from entry into the United\r\nStates if they be of a character or kind forbidden entry in the country\r\nwhere they are manufactured or from which they are exported.\r\n\r\n7. Food products will also be excluded from the United States if they\r\nare forbidden to be sold or be restricted in sale in the countries in\r\nwhich they are manufactured or from which they are exported.\r\n\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\nUntil further notice, or until the matter shall have been determined by\r\njudicial decisions, or until the permanent standards for the products\r\nmentioned have been established by proclamation, the Department submits\r\nthe following illustrations for the guidance of importers, as an index\r\nto the action of the Department in cases where the product hereinafter\r\nmentioned, and like products, are offered for import:\r\n\r\n1. _Wine bearing a classed name_, that is, brands of wine of high\r\ngrade, recognized by law and by commercial usage, must be true to name;\r\nfor instance, a wine bearing the name Chateau Larose must be wine\r\ncoming from the vineyard covered by that appellation and no other.\r\nImporters should be ready to furnish certificates, when asked for, of\r\nconformity of the wine to the label used. Stretched wine, that is,\r\nwine containing a part of the original wine, or a similar wine from\r\na different vineyard, should not be labeled with the name of a true,\r\nclassed wine.\r\n\r\n2. _Wine containing sulfurous acid_ in amount greater than that first\r\nmentioned below, added as a preservative or for other purposes,\r\nshould carry upon the label “Preserved with sulfurous acid,” and the\r\ndeclaration accompanying it should state approximately the quantity\r\nof sulfurous acid present. The admission of wines containing not more\r\nthan 200 milligrams of sulfurous acid per liter, added in the usual\r\ncellar treatment, of which not more than 20 milligrams shall be free\r\nacid, is permissible without notification. Wines containing more than\r\n350 milligrams per liter of sulfurous acid should not be offered for\r\nimportation under any conditions.\r\n\r\n3. _Sugar wines_ are wines which are made partly by the addition of\r\nsugar to the must or otherwise previous to fermentation, and should\r\nbear upon the label “Sugar wines,” or some similar legend, and the\r\nquantity of sugar employed in their manufacture should be stated in the\r\ndeclaration before the consul.\r\n\r\n4. _Mixed wines_, that is, blended wines, should not bear the name of\r\nthe vineyard from which a part of the mixture is made unless the label\r\nplainly indicates that it is a blend or mixture with other wines. If\r\nwine from any other country than that where the mixture is made, or\r\nfrom which it is exported, be employed, a statement to that effect\r\nshould be found upon the label and in the declaration. Wines, sulfured\r\nwines, sugar wines, and mixed wines should not contain over 14 percent,\r\nby volume, of alcohol.\r\n\r\n5. _Fortified wines_, that is, wines to which additional alcohol has\r\nbeen added, under the law of the United States regulating fortification\r\nof wines, should contain no added alcohol except that derived from\r\nthe distillation of wine, and the brandy so used should be properly\r\naged in oak casks in order to be free from injurious compounds such as\r\nfusel oils, etc. Raw brandy made from the lees, pomace, and refuse of\r\nthe winery, and containing excessive quantities of fusel oil and other\r\ninjurious ingredients, should not be used in the fortification of wines\r\nimported into the United States. Importers are requested to secure such\r\ninformation from their agents abroad as may enable them to certify\r\nto the character of the brandy used for fortification when any doubt\r\nexists.\r\n\r\n6. _Brandy_ (potable brandy) is the distillate from wine, properly aged\r\nby storage in wood to eliminate the greater part of the fusel oils,\r\netc., which may be present. Brandy should contain not less than 45 nor\r\nmore than 55 percent, by volume, of alcohol and not more than 0.25\r\npercent of total solids (extract). The content of fusel oils should not\r\nexceed 0.25 percent. Brandy should not be mixed with alcohol from any\r\nother source than that of distilled wine. The distillate from the lees,\r\npomace, and refuse of the winery, is not entitled to bear the term\r\n“brandy” in the potable sense. “Cognac” is only admitted as a name in\r\nthe case of brandies made in Cognac from wines grown and manufactured\r\nthere. No artificial color other than that derived from the wood in\r\nwhich they are aged is admitted in brandies.\r\n\r\n7. _Whisky_ is the distilled product of fermented cereal grains,\r\nproperly aged in wood in order to remove the greater part of the\r\nfusel oils, etc., produced during the distillation. Whisky should not\r\ncontain less than 45 nor more than 55 percent, by volume, of alcohol\r\nand not more than 0.25 percent of total solids (extract). The content\r\nof fusel oils should not exceed 0.25 percent. No artificial color other\r\nthan that derived from the wood in which it is stored is admitted in\r\nwhisky. Blended whisky is whisky made of two or more whiskies. Compound\r\nor “rectified” whisky is whisky made with or without the use of some\r\nwhisky from neutral, cologne, or silent spirits; that is, pure alcohol,\r\nto which artificial flavoring and coloring matters may be added.\r\nSuch whiskies should be plainly branded on the label “Compound” or\r\n“Compounded,” even if containing a percentage of pure whisky.\r\n\r\n8. _Beer_ is the fermented product of cereal grains, the starch of\r\nwhich has been converted into sugar by malt or malting, and to which an\r\ninfusion of hops has been added.\r\n\r\n9. _Fruit compounds_, such as jams, jellies, marmalades, etc., are\r\npreparations made from pure fruits or fruit juices, with the addition\r\nof sugar. The presence of artificial coloring matter, flavors,\r\nglucose, preservatives, and other added substances is not admitted for\r\nthe pure products, and when used the fact should be plainly indicated\r\nin the English language upon the label. These bodies should not bear\r\nthe name of any one fruit alone if they are made from mixtures of fruit\r\nor fruit juices.\r\n\r\n10. _Sausage_ is the comminuted edible meat of healthy slaughtered\r\nanimals, commonly used as food, mixed with salt and condimental\r\nsubstances. The packages should bear the certificate of an official\r\ninspector as to purity, and if pork, that it is free from trichinæ. The\r\naddition of preservatives should be plainly stated upon the label, and\r\nif these preservatives be deemed injurious to health, such sausages\r\ncan not be admitted. Coloring matters when used are under similar\r\nrestrictions.\r\n\r\n11. _Salad (edible) oils_ shall bear the name of the substance from\r\nwhich they are made, namely, olive, cottonseed, sesame, peanut, etc.\r\nThe designation “salad oil” is not sufficient. If mixtures, this fact\r\nshould be plainly stated upon the label, in harmony with the principles\r\nalready laid down. The ingredients of a mixed oil should have their\r\norigin (country) named upon the label in order to conform with the\r\nprovisions of the law.\r\n\r\n12. _Vinegar_ should contain not less than 4 percent of acetic acid.\r\nThe kind of vinegar should be named upon the label, namely, cider\r\nvinegar, wine vinegar, malt vinegar, spirit vinegar--meaning vinegar\r\nderived from the acetous fermentation of cider, wine, malt liquors, or\r\ndistilled spirits, respectively. Any added coloring or other foreign\r\nmatter should be noted upon the label and in the declaration.\r\n\r\n13. _Labeling._--If more than one article be present in a food\r\nproduct, the name of one of the substances alone is not deemed to be a\r\nsufficient label. If peas or beans have a portion of copper, the label\r\nshould state that fact. The various natural constituents of a food\r\nproduct need not be noted, for the presence of the usual condimentary\r\nsubstances employed in foods, viz., sugar, salt, spices, vinegar, and\r\nwood smoke. The term “sugar” is used in its usual signification, viz.,\r\nsugar made from sugar cane, sugar beets, maple trees, sorghum etc. When\r\nsugars are made by the artificial hydrolysis of starch, by an acid or\r\nsalt, that fact should be noted on the label by the term “glucose,” or\r\nstarch sugar. “Grape sugar” is not admitted as a correct term for such\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL STATEMENT.\r\n\r\nThe above specific illustrations indicate the position of the\r\nDepartment in regard to the general character of food products which\r\nmay be imported without question.\r\n\r\nThe importer will do well to require his agents in foreign countries to\r\ncarefully comply with the general principles set forth. In a few words\r\nthey may be summarized as follows: Freedom from deleterious substances,\r\nnotification of added foreign substances, truthfulness in labeling.\r\n\r\nThe standards of purity for food products, which have been fixed by\r\nthe Secretary of Agriculture in harmony with existing law, are given\r\nin Circular No. 13 of the Secretary’s Office and are applicable to\r\nimported foods, which should conform to these established standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 5.)\r\n\r\nPROPOSED REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE LABELING OF IMPORTED FOOD\r\nPRODUCTS.[50]\r\n\r\n  [50] Circular No. 21. Bureau of Chemistry, U. S. Dept. Agr.\r\n\r\n  _November 17, 1904._\r\n\r\n(_a_) ARTIFICIAL COLORING MATTER (ESPECIALLY SULFATE OF COPPER).\r\n\r\nThe use of sulfate of copper as a coloring matter in certain green\r\nvegetables has become quite prevalent. Sulfate of copper is a substance\r\nwhich in itself acts as a quick emetic and irritant, and therefore its\r\npresence in food products must be looked upon as undesirable.\r\n\r\n  Copper sulfate is irritant or mildly escharotic, and, when in dilute\r\n  solution, stimulant and astringent. At one time it was given in\r\n  _epilepsy_ and other nervous diseases, but at present it is never\r\n  used internally, except for its influence upon the gastro-intestinal\r\n  mucous membrane. In _chronic diarrhea_ with ulceration it is often\r\n  a useful remedy. In doses of 5 grains it acts as a powerful, prompt\r\n  emetic, without causing general depression or much nausea, but it is\r\n  too irritant to be used freely.\r\n\r\n  A dose of copper sulfate as an astringent is a quarter of a grain (16\r\n  milligrams); as an emetic, 5 grains (330 milligrams).--(United States\r\n  Dispensatory, 18th edition, p. 468.)\r\n\r\nIt is claimed by some manufacturers, chemists, and hygienists that\r\ncopper sulfate when added to green vegetables, forms compounds which\r\nare harmless to health.\r\n\r\nPending investigations which are now making, all food products colored\r\nwith sulfate of copper, or to which sulfate of copper has been added\r\nfor any purpose, should contain upon the label a statement in English,\r\nin letters not smaller than long primer caps, as follows: “Colored\r\nwith sulfate of copper,” or, if preferred, “Prepared with sulfate of\r\ncopper.” A statement of the quantity of copper, if any, which may be\r\npermitted in food products under the provisions of the law is reserved\r\nuntil further study of the question can be made.\r\n\r\nFood products artificially colored with other substances than sulfate\r\nof copper should bear upon the label, in letters of the size described\r\nabove, the legend “Artificially colored,” or, if the manufacturer\r\nprefers, the statement “Colored with anilin dye,” or whatever dye-stuff\r\nmay be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) GLUCOSE.\r\n\r\nManufactured food products in which glucose (sugar made by hydrolysis\r\nwith an acid or otherwise from starch) has been used instead of sugar,\r\nor for other purposes, should bear upon the label in English, in\r\nletters of the size above mentioned, “Prepared with glucose,” or some\r\nstatement of similar import. The glucose which is used must be free\r\nfrom arsenic or other injurious substances.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) FOODS PREPARED WITH OIL.\r\n\r\nIn countries where olive oil is the common edible oil the expression on\r\nfood products “Prepared with oil” or “Packed in oil” will be construed\r\nto mean olive oil. Where a mixture of oils is used, or another oil than\r\nolive oil, a statement to that effect should be made upon the label.\r\n\r\nThis regulation in regard to labeling will go in effect on March 16,\r\n1905. Importers are requested to immediately acquaint their agents\r\nin foreign countries with this ruling, in order that the proper\r\npreparation of the labels may be secured.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 6.)\r\n\r\nSTYLE OF LABEL REQUIRED FOR IMPORTED FOODS.\r\n\r\n[Note size of type.]\r\n\r\nPREPARED WITH GLUCOSE.\r\n\r\nCOLORED WITH SULFATE OF COPPER.\r\n\r\nARTIFICIALLY COLORED.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 7.)\r\n\r\nNOTICE TO EXPORTERS OF DESICCATED FRUITS.\r\n\r\n  _August 31, 1904._\r\n\r\nThe Governments of Prussia and Saxony, in order to unify the practices\r\nof inspectors of desiccated fruits, have issued decrees fixing the\r\nlimit of sulfurous acid in desiccated fruits at 0.125 percent.\r\n\r\nExporters of such products from the United States are asked to take\r\nnotice of this regulation and to refrain from sending to the countries\r\nnamed desiccated fruits containing an amount of sulfurous acid in\r\nexcess of that mentioned above.\r\n\r\nBy authority of Congress, the Department of Agriculture will inspect\r\ncargoes of desiccated fruits intended for exportation, free of charge\r\nto exporters who may request such inspection. On application to the\r\nBureau of Chemistry all necessary blanks will be sent. Exporters are\r\nurged, in order to avoid refusal or confiscation by other countries, to\r\navail themselves of this opportunity to ascertain, before shipment, the\r\npercentage of sulfurous acid contained in goods intended to be exported.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 8.)\r\n\r\nNOTICE TO IMPORTERS OF LIQUID EGG PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\n  _December 14, 1904._\r\n\r\nThis Department has made examinations of invoices of liquid eggs--yolk\r\nof egg, or white of egg, or the two together--offered for import\r\ninto the United States. These food products have been uniformly\r\nfound preserved with boric acid or borax, a substance which the\r\ninvestigations in this Department have shown to be injurious to health.\r\n\r\nNotice is hereby given to importers that the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nwill be requested to refuse admission of food products of this\r\ncharacter consulated subsequent to December 15, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 9.)\r\n\r\nNOTICE TO IMPORTERS OF DRIED EGG PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\n  _February 24, 1905._\r\n\r\nIn regard to the importation of egg products in a dry state, preserved\r\nwith boric acid or with other preservatives, with the exception of\r\nsalt, sugar, vinegar, or wood smoke, further importation will be\r\nregarded as a violation of the provisions of the existing law. Refusal\r\nto admit such importations will not be requested of the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury on invoices consulated prior to January 21, 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 10.)\r\n\r\nTREASURY DECISION ON REFUNDING DUTIES PAID ON CONDEMNED IMPORTATIONS OF\r\nFOOD PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\n  _February 20, 1905._\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury has informed the Secretary of\r\nAgriculture, under date of February 17, 1905, in regard to the duties\r\npaid upon imported food products before the inspection thereof has been\r\ncompleted by the Department of Agriculture, that in case the inspection\r\nis of such a character as to require the reshipment of the products in\r\nquestion beyond the jurisdiction of the United States, estimated duties\r\npaid under such circumstances will be refunded to the importer when\r\ndelivery has been refused and the merchandise has been either destroyed\r\nor exported under the regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 11.)\r\n\r\nSUSPENDING REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE LABELING OF IMPORTED SARDINES AND\r\nOTHER FOOD SUBSTANCES PACKED IN OIL.\r\n\r\n  _March 1, 1905._\r\n\r\nReferring to Circular No. 21 [F. I. D. No. 5_c_], respecting the\r\npacking of sardines and other food substances in oil, representations\r\nhave been made to this Department, officially and otherwise, that in\r\nsome countries where fish--namely, sardines--are packed in this way\r\nolive oil is not the common edible oil of the country, and therefore\r\nthe regulation would not apply. I have directed that investigations be\r\nmade of the character of the oil found in imported packages of sardines\r\nand other fish for the purpose of determining the character of the oil\r\nwhich has been employed.\r\n\r\nPending the result of these investigations, and in view of the fact\r\nthat the packages intended for export to this country were prepared\r\nin many cases prior to the publication of the proposed regulations,\r\nthat part of the circular referring to the marking of the packages\r\nrespecting the character of the oil employed will be suspended until\r\nthe investigations are concluded and until further notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 12.)\r\n\r\nABOLISHING THE RULE TO ADMIT IMPORTATIONS OF FOOD PRODUCTS IN THE CASE\r\nOF FIRST NOTIFICATION.\r\n\r\n  _March 1, 1905._\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the enforcement of the legislation relating to\r\nthe inspection of imported food products, in order to fully acquaint\r\nimporters with the provisions of the law before any penalties were\r\nimposed, the inspecting officers were instructed in cases of first\r\noffense, where no purpose or intent to evade the law could be imputed\r\nto the importer, to pass the invoice under inspection, with notice that\r\nthis was done without prejudice to future decisions.\r\n\r\nThe food-inspection law has now been in force since July 1, 1903, and\r\nit is presumed that every importer is acquainted with its existence\r\nand its requirements. Notice is therefore given that on and after\r\nMarch 16, 1905, the exception which has been made in the case of first\r\nnotification will be abolished.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 13.)\r\n\r\nPROVISIONAL STANDARDS FOR THE LIMIT OF SULFUROUS ACID IN IMPORTED WINES.\r\n\r\n  _March 1, 1905._\r\n\r\nThe regulations in regard to the amount of sulfurous acid permissible\r\nin imported wines, as prescribed in Circular No. 18 [F. I. D. No. 4],\r\nwere based upon the regulations adopted by the consulting committee of\r\nhygiene of the Seine. Since the publication of these regulations the\r\nquantity of sulfurous acid in wines has been the subject of another\r\ninvestigation by an official French committee, with the result that\r\nthe maximum limit of sulfurous acid in wines in France has been\r\nincreased to 400 milligrams of total acid per liter, with a toleration\r\nof 10 percent. Results of the investigations of the French committee\r\nhave been communicated to the Department of Agriculture and are\r\nunder consideration. Investigations have also been conducted by the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture relating to the effects of sulfurous acid\r\nupon health and digestion.\r\n\r\nPending the final conclusions which may result from a study of all\r\nthese data the provisional limit of sulfurous acid in imported wines\r\nwill be established as follows: For dry wines, as defined in the\r\nstandards of purity fixed by this Department in Circular No. 13 of the\r\nSecretary’s Office, entitled “Standards of Purity for Food Products,”\r\n200 milligrams of total sulfurous acid per liter; for wines containing\r\nnot more than 2 percent of sugar, 250 milligrams per liter; for wines\r\ncontaining not to exceed 3 percent of sugar, 300 milligrams per liter;\r\nfor wines containing over 3 percent of sugar, 350 milligrams of total\r\nsulfurous acid per liter. These provisional standards will be in effect\r\nuntil further orders.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 14.)\r\n\r\nANALYSES OF EXPORTS MUST BE MADE BEFORE SHIPMENT, ON SAMPLES TAKEN FROM\r\nACTUAL CARGO.\r\n\r\n  _March 10, 1905._\r\n\r\nIn the case of an attempt to introduce a condensed beef juice into\r\nTurkey the Turkish Government refused to admit the product “until an\r\nanalysis thereof and a report on such analysis, duly certified by the\r\nGovernment of the United States and by the Turkish consul at New York,\r\nis presented to the Turkish authorities.” Application being made to\r\nthe Department of Agriculture, through the Department of State, for\r\nsuch certified analysis, the blank forms used for such certifications\r\nwere supplied, when the following features of the case were developed,\r\nas set forth in a letter from the counsel of the company desiring the\r\ncertificate:\r\n\r\n  The forms which you inclose relate to a specific shipment of goods to\r\n  any particular country and call for the selection of samples from the\r\n  particular lot of goods set aside for shipment....\r\n\r\n  The Turkish authorities evidently do not require that such analysis\r\n  and certificate should be presented in connection with each shipment,\r\n  but only that a general analysis and certificate should be given.\r\n  Upon the presentation of such general certificate permission can\r\n  be obtained for the introduction of such goods without subsequent\r\n  analysis and certificate.\r\n\r\nIn view of these facts the Department, under date of March 10, 1905,\r\nrendered the following decision:\r\n\r\n  I regret that we are not able to adopt the views of the Turkish\r\n  authorities of which you speak, and in harmony therewith make an\r\n  analysis of your product and give a general certificate, as you\r\n  desire. Under the regulations established for carrying out the\r\n  law, to which the Secretary of State called your attention, this\r\n  Department can only make analyses of samples from the actual cargo\r\n  before its shipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 15.)\r\n\r\nPLACING PRESERVATIVES IN VINEGAR.\r\n\r\n  _April 10, 1905._\r\n\r\nFood products which are artificially colored will be admitted\r\ntemporarily provided the color contained therein is not injurious to\r\nhealth. In regard to a preservative in vinegar, in the first place I\r\ncan see no possible reason why a preservative should be put in vinegar,\r\nwhich is itself a preservative. In the second place, not knowing its\r\ncharacter I could base no opinion on its admissibility. If flavoring\r\nmatters are placed in vinegar--that is, aromatic substances--there\r\nis no objection whatever to their presence. Preservatives, with the\r\nexception of salt, sugar, vinegar, and wood smoke, are non-condimental,\r\nand therefore can not be excused on the ground that they add any flavor\r\nor taste to the substance.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 16.)\r\n\r\nFALSE LABELING OF VINEGAR.\r\n\r\n  _April 21, 1905._\r\n\r\nIt is held that the term “vinegar” applied to products made in France\r\nand other wine-producing countries where vinegar is made chiefly from\r\nwine should apply only to such goods or to vinegar made from cider.\r\nThe analytical data in a given case show that the vinegar in question\r\nis not derived from either of these sources, but is evidently the\r\nproduct of oxidation of low wines or alcohol. It does not comply with\r\nthe standard either for vinegar or wine vinegar on page 14 of Circular\r\nNo. 13[51] of the Secretary’s Office. It is evidently a vinegar such as\r\nis described under paragraph 6[52] of the same page and being such a\r\nvinegar should have been so labeled. It is held, therefore, that this\r\nproduct is falsely labeled.\r\n\r\n  [51] 1. _Vinegar_, _cider vinegar_ or _apple vinegar_ is the product\r\n  made by the alcoholic and subsequent acetous fermentations of the\r\n  juice of apples, is lævo-rotatory, and contains not less than four\r\n  (4) grams of acetic acid, not less than one and six-tenths (1.6)\r\n  grams of apple solids, and not less than twenty-five hundredths\r\n  (0.25) grams of apple ash in one hundred (100) cubic centimeters.\r\n  The water-soluble ash from one hundred (100) cubic centimeters of\r\n  the vinegar requires not less than thirty (30) cubic centimeters of\r\n  decinormal acid to neutralize the alkalinity and contains not less\r\n  than ten (10) milligrams of phosphoric acid (P₂O₅).\r\n\r\n  2. _Wine vinegar_ or _grape vinegar_ is the product made by the\r\n  alcoholic and subsequent acetous fermentations of the juice of grapes\r\n  and contains, in one hundred (100) cubic centimeters, not less than\r\n  four (4) grams of acetic acid, not less than one and four-tenths\r\n  (1.4) grams of grape solids, and not less than thirteen hundredths\r\n  (0.13) gram of grape ash.\r\n\r\n  [52] 6. _Spirit vinegar_, _distilled vinegar_, _grain vinegar_ is the\r\n  product made by the acetous fermentation of dilute distilled alcohol\r\n  and contains, in one hundred (100) cubic centimeters, not less than\r\n  four (4) grams of acetic acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 17.)\r\n\r\n  LABELS ATTACHED TO WRAPPERS INSTEAD OF PACKAGES; STATEMENTS RELATING\r\n  TO WHOLESOMENESS OF ADDED SUBSTANCE. PASTER LABELS.\r\n\r\n  _April 21, 1905._\r\n\r\nOur examination showed that these packages of jams were wrapped\r\nwith paper, to which was affixed a paster containing the legend\r\n“ARTIFICIALLY COLORED” in large type, followed in small type by the\r\nphrase “With an infinitesimal proportion of absolutely harmless\r\ncoloring.” While there can be no legal objection to the additional\r\nphrase, it will be understood that the determination of this point is\r\nespecially reserved by law to this Department.\r\n\r\nOn removing the paper wrappers of the packages the label which appeared\r\non the outside of the packages was found attached to the stone jars,\r\nbut the paster was missing. It is a reasonable construction of the law\r\nto say that the label required should be the permanent and not the\r\ntemporary label. In subsequent imports, therefore, of goods of this\r\nkind it is deemed necessary to have the paster attached directly to or\r\nimmediately above or below the principal label on the jar itself. The\r\nuse of a paster is permitted provided it is as firmly attached as the\r\noriginal label in such a way as not to be easily removed, and further\r\nthat it is applied to goods which are already labeled before March\r\n16, 1905. In goods packed subsequent to this date it will be required\r\nthat the part of the label which gives information in regard to added\r\nproducts shall be made an integral part of the original label.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 18.)\r\n\r\nSTATEMENT OF QUANTITY OF ADDED SUBSTANCE IN FOOD PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nLETTER OF IMPORTER.\r\n\r\n  _April 21, 1905._\r\n\r\nWe note certain imported tins containing peas labeled “This tin\r\ncontains ³⁄₄ grain of copper as preservative.” Permit us to inquire if\r\nthe Department accepts this as correct branding.\r\n\r\nIn default, would your Department accept “Prepared with the addition of\r\nan infinitesimal amount of sulfate of copper not exceeding ³⁄₄ grain\r\nper tin?”\r\n\r\nPardon us for asking these questions, our reason being that in\r\nthirty-five years’ dealing in so-called greened peas by our senior,\r\nnot a single case of injury has ever come to his knowledge, and the\r\nbare statement now required on the tins of “Colored” or “Prepared with\r\nsulfate of copper” would appear to the consumer as a new and hitherto\r\nunused ingredient fraught with possible danger, thus seriously injuring\r\nthe commerce in this article and reducing the revenue derived from its\r\nimportation.\r\n\r\nWe beg to assure you that we would not thus appear to insist upon\r\nqualifying the label, if we deemed the article injurious, our personal\r\nconsumption, as well as that of numerous friends, supported by the\r\nreport of the council of hygiene of Paris in 1889, appearing to us as\r\nabsolute proof of the innocuity of vegetables where the chlorophyl is\r\nthus fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECISION OF DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\n  _April 26, 1905._\r\n\r\nWhen a label with letters of proper size and legibility contains\r\nthe statement that it [the food product] is colored with sulfate of\r\ncopper we consider that the conditions required by law are fulfilled.\r\nThis statement, however, should not be in any way connected with any\r\nother matters. If the importers desire to put additional labels on,\r\nstating “This tin contains ³⁄₄ grain of copper,” we should have no\r\nobjections thereto. If, also, they should desire to add to the label\r\nrequired the phrase, “Prepared with the addition of an infinitesimal\r\namount of sulfate of copper not exceeding ³⁄₄ grain per tin,” we could\r\nnot reasonably object. This descriptive matter, however, should not\r\nbe connected with the label required, namely, “COLORED WITH SULPHATE\r\nOF COPPER.” The fact that the people of this country might object to\r\neating goods thus marked is the strongest argument you could give\r\nshowing the justice of the marking. The object of the law was to\r\nprevent deception being practiced upon our people.\r\n\r\nIf any added supplementary statement is shown to be false by the\r\nresults of the analysis it would be considered then as a misbranding,\r\nand treated accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 19.)\r\n\r\nFALSE BRANDING OF MUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\nLETTER OF IMPORTER.\r\n\r\n  _April 25, 1905._\r\n\r\nWe acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 18th advising that a\r\ncertain shipment of mushrooms consigned to us ... are misbranded, for\r\nthe reason that the tins contain nothing but stems and scraps from the\r\ncannery.\r\n\r\nIn answer we beg to advise you that the goods in question are not sold\r\nby us as regular mushrooms to the trade. This particular packing is\r\nused by only the hotel and restaurant trade for the purpose of making a\r\nsauce, and on this account are branded “Hotels.” This is the trade-name\r\ngiven to the character of the goods in question, and it is always\r\nunderstood that they contain nothing but stems and pieces which are\r\nleft over in the packing of the other grades.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions we cannot believe that we are importing goods\r\nthat are misbranded, and would ask you to kindly release the shipment\r\nin question.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECISION OF DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\n  _April 29, 1905._\r\n\r\nIn this connection I desire to state that the understanding of the\r\ntrade respecting branding of food products is not one which should\r\nalways guide the officials in charge of the pure-food law. The object\r\nof the law is the protection of the consumers particularly and not of\r\nthe trade. The addition of the word “Hotel” to the word “Champignons”\r\nin no way describes the character of the product except to those who\r\nare initiated in the secrets of the trade. After all, the consumer is\r\nthe one who suffers, as he eats the mushroom sauce, which is not made\r\nof mushrooms at all, and thus the deception is complete, although the\r\npurchaser may understand the character of the goods. It is extremely\r\ndoubtful whether under the terms of the law such goods would be\r\nentitled to importation under any name, as they certainly are not to be\r\nconsidered as edible. They should bear the label “FRAGMENTS AND SCRAPS\r\nFROM MUSHROOM CANNERY,” or “CHAMPIGNONS, PIECES AND STEMS” in order to\r\nbe properly described. I am not able to see why the patrons of hotels\r\nand restaurants should be subjected to a deception of this character.\r\nI beg to say, therefore, that your explanation does not satisfy me\r\nrespecting the suitability of this invoice for entry.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 20.)\r\n\r\nSTATEMENTS ON LABELS REGARDING HEALTH LAWS OF OTHER COUNTRIES.\r\n\r\n  _May 17, 1905._\r\n\r\nI beg to call your attention to a shipment of beans.... We note after\r\nthe legend “COLORED WITH SULFATE OF COPPER” the additional legend\r\n“ACCORDING TO FRENCH HEALTH LAWS.” Inasmuch as the French laws do not\r\napply to this country, the addition of this phrase is regarded as a\r\ncomplication of the labeling, having for its object to influence the\r\nconsumer respecting the character of the added product. Inasmuch as the\r\nCongress of the United States has placed upon this Department the duty\r\nof deciding upon the wholesomeness or unwholesomeness of substances\r\nadded to foods, we regard such a label as an attempt to forestall the\r\njudgment which this Department may render in accordance with the act of\r\nCongress above referred to. While in the present instance we would not\r\nconsider the addition of the second legend as a cause for rejecting the\r\narticles, your attention is called to the undesirability of any such\r\nstatement appearing upon the label, and it is suggested that in the\r\nfuture it be omitted.\r\n\r\nAttention is further called to the fact that in so far as we can\r\ndiscover by a study of the French laws there are no regulations\r\ntherein respecting the addition of sulfate of copper to food products.\r\nIn this respect, therefore, the second phrase, “ACCORDING TO FRENCH\r\nHEALTH LAWS,” must be considered as a misstatement. It may be that the\r\naddition of copper is not forbidden by the French law, but we do not\r\nbelieve it is added under any regulations thereof. It will be decidedly\r\nadvisable to omit the phrase.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 21.)\r\n\r\nRELABELING IMPORTED FOOD PRODUCTS AFTER ARRIVAL IN THIS COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n  _May 26, 1905._\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the law in regard to labeling is clear, namely, that the\r\nlabels should be properly attached at the time of packing the goods.\r\nShould exceptions be made to this principle and importers be allowed\r\nto relabel goods offered for import after inspection and refusal of\r\nentry, it would be impossible to secure a proper compliance with the\r\nterms of the law. Manufacturers and exporters in other countries and\r\nimporters in this country would prefer in these cases to import the\r\ngoods as usually labeled and thus, if the invoices were not inspected,\r\nthey would enter without delay. If, on the other hand, the invoices\r\nwere inspected they would feel that they could then exercise the\r\nprivilege of relabeling. A courtesy of this kind to one importer would\r\nnecessarily be extended to all, and for this reason a proper compliance\r\nwith the purpose of the law would not be secured. The request for\r\npermission to relabel is therefore denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 22.)\r\n\r\nILLEGIBLE OR CONCEALED LEGENDS ON LABELS.\r\n\r\n  _May 29, 1905._\r\n\r\nThere has been presented for the opinion of this Department a label\r\nin brass marked in large letters “CONSERVES ALIMENTAIRES” and which\r\nby ordinary inspection reveals no legend of any kind relating to any\r\nartificial color which has been used in its preparation. By very\r\ncareful inspection an almost totally illegible label is found printed\r\nin extremely small letters in this way: The word “artificially” is in\r\nthe upper left-hand corner surrounding a circular mark near the margin,\r\nand the word “colored,” similar as to position and letters, is in the\r\nupper right-hand corner.\r\n\r\nPrinting the legend “Artificially colored” in this way can only be\r\nconstrued as an attempt to comply with the letter of the law and to\r\nevade its spirit. This Department holds that in so far as the purpose\r\nof labeling is concerned these words are entirely insufficient. As a\r\nresult of this decision the packages of goods bearing the label have\r\nbeen declared to be misbranded.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 23.)\r\n\r\nLABELING OF PRESERVES SWEETENED WITH CANE OR BEET SUGAR AND GLUCOSE.\r\n\r\nLETTER OF IMPORTER.\r\n\r\n  _June 2, 1905._\r\n\r\nWith reference to the label on preserved strawberries and other fruits\r\nimported from Germany, etc., we would thank you to advise us whether\r\nyou would permit the legend descriptive of the added substance (part of\r\nthe original label) to read, for instance:\r\n\r\n  PRESERVED STRAWBERRIES\r\n  ARTIFICIALLY COLORED\r\n  PREPARED WITH PURE SUGAR AND GLUCOSE.\r\n\r\nThe sirup is almost entirely pure sugar, and it would therefore be an\r\ninjustice to be compelled to say that it was composed exclusively of\r\nglucose.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECISION OF DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\n  _June 5, 1905._\r\n\r\nWhen a label with letters of proper size and legibility contains the\r\nstatement that the goods are prepared with glucose, or with sugar\r\nand glucose, we consider that the conditions required by law are\r\nfulfilled. Manufacturers may add to the label required a statement of\r\nthe percentage of glucose in the goods. If any statement on the label\r\nis shown to be false by the results of the analysis or otherwise, the\r\npackage will be considered as misbranded and treated accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 24.)\r\n\r\n  ADULTERATION OF DOMESTIC FOOD PRODUCTS BY THE ADDITION OF\r\n  PRESERVATIVES, COLORING MATTERS, AND OTHER INGREDIENTS NOT NATURAL TO\r\n  FOODS, NOT REGULATED BY DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\n  _June 14, 1905._\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture is not authorized by law to make any\r\nregulations concerning the above-mentioned substances in food products\r\nof domestic manufacture and intended for domestic commerce either\r\nwithin the State where made or for interstate purposes.\r\n\r\nFor foods intended for export to foreign countries the Department is\r\nauthorized to make examinations and certify whether or not the foods\r\nso offered are in harmony with the laws regulating food products in\r\ncountries to which the products are to be sent.\r\n\r\nIn the case of imported foods the decisions and regulations of the\r\nDepartment are contained in the circulars and regulations issued\r\nherewith.\r\n\r\nNumerous inquiries reach this Department respecting the addition to\r\nfood products of preservatives, coloring matters, and other ingredients\r\nnot natural to foods. This Department has authority of law to fix\r\nstandards of purity for food products, and these standards when\r\ncompleted will cover all the points above mentioned in so far as the\r\nauthority of Congress extends. The Department has no authority besides\r\nthis to establish regulations or conditions affecting the domestic\r\nmanufacture of and commerce in food products containing the ingredients\r\nabove mentioned. This power at the present time is exercised, if at\r\nall, solely by the several States. The food standards, in so far as\r\nthey have been established, are embodied in Circular No. 13, Office of\r\nthe Secretary, which can be had upon application to this Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 25.)\r\n\r\nFOOD PRODUCTS OFFERED FOR ENTRY AND AFTERWARD DECLARED TO BE FOR\r\nTECHNICAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\n  _June 21, 1905._\r\n\r\nOn June 14 this Department was asked to release an invoice of egg\r\nalbumen which had been found to be preserved with boric acid, thus\r\ncontaining a substance prejudicial to health and refused admission on\r\nthat ground, on the statement of the importer that the product would\r\nbe reserved solely for technical purposes. It is manifest that the\r\naction of this Department should not be based upon any statement of the\r\nimporter made subsequent to the sampling of the invoice for examination.\r\n\r\nThe plain provision of the law requires the inspection of food products\r\nwhen deemed advisable, and their exclusion in certain circumstances.\r\nWhen a food product is thus excluded under the regular application of\r\nthe law, it can not be released and permitted entry on a subsequent\r\ndeclaration that it will be reserved for technical purposes only. Any\r\nproduct which may be used either for technical purposes or for food\r\nwill be regarded as a food product, irrespective of any declaration\r\nsubsequent to inspection respecting the use to which it is to be put.\r\n\r\nThe use of a food product for other purposes is incidental, and\r\nshould not be construed as exempting food products of that class from\r\nexamination in the regular way.\r\n\r\n\r\nF. I. D. 26.\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE,\r\n\r\nBUREAU OF CHEMISTRY,\r\n\r\nH. W. WILEY, CHIEF OF BUREAU.\r\n\r\nFOOD INSPECTION DECISION 26.\r\n\r\n\r\nLABELING IMPORTED FOOD PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nBy reason of representations which were made before this Department\r\non June 14 by a committee representing the importers of New York,\r\nit is hereby ordered that all cases of inspection of imported food\r\nproducts to date, where exclusion thereof has been required by reason\r\nof misbranding or false labeling, may be reopened with permission to\r\nrelabel, if granted by the Secretary of the Treasury, under supervision\r\nof an official detailed from the Treasury Department for that purpose.\r\nThese labels shall be in the form of a paster attached securely to, or\r\njust above or below the principal label, in a manner not to be easily\r\ndetached, and bearing a legend showing the contents of the package\r\nnot of the nature represented by the principal label, in letters not\r\nsmaller in size than long primer capitals of the usual facing, such\r\nlabels to be submitted to the proper representative of this Department\r\nand be approved as satisfactory before the release of the invoice.\r\n\r\nIn order to more clearly set forth the requirements of this Department\r\nas contained in Circulars 18 and 21 of the Bureau of Chemistry (F. I.\r\nD. 4 and 5) and in other publications of the Department, the following\r\ngeneral principles of labeling of food products are to be observed:\r\n\r\n  1. A food product should be designated by its usual name, English\r\n  name preferred, and need not bear any further description of its\r\n  components or qualities. Food products which are prepared by\r\n  established processes of refining need not bear upon the label any\r\n  statement respecting the refining process. For illustration, the term\r\n  “flour” is sufficient for the food product known by that name; the\r\n  term “olive oil” is sufficient for the food product known by that\r\n  name. The usual processes of manufacture and refining in these cases\r\n  are not required to be stated.\r\n\r\n  2. When any foreign substance is added to a food product other than\r\n  that necessary to its manufacture or refining, the label should bear\r\n  a statement to that effect. For instance, a food product which is\r\n  artificially colored or to which a preservative has been added should\r\n  have these facts appear upon the label. If a substance which itself\r\n  is not a coloring matter be added to a food product for the purpose\r\n  of preserving or intensifying the natural color of the food, the name\r\n  of the substance shall be specifically mentioned, as, for instance,\r\n  when sulfate of copper is used to intensify or preserve the green\r\n  color of food products.\r\n\r\n  3. Where a substance which is generally understood to have specific\r\n  qualities in the preparation of a food product is replaced by\r\n  another substance either of a similar nature or entirely different\r\n  thereto but with some of the same qualities, the name of the\r\n  substituted substance should appear upon the label. For instance,\r\n  sugar is the usual sweetening substance in the preparation of\r\n  certain food products. If the sugar is wholly or in part replaced\r\n  by another substance, such as glucose, that fact should appear.\r\n  If the sweetening substance used be saccharin, a substance which\r\n  is not related to sugars at all, the label should indicate such\r\n  substitution. Where olive oil is used in the preparation of foods and\r\n  where it is understood by the term “oil” that olive oil is indicated,\r\n  the substitution of any other edible oil for the olive oil should be\r\n  noted on the label.\r\n\r\n  4. Where a substance is made up of fragments or scraps of the\r\n  material usually known by the name upon the label, the name of the\r\n  substance alone will be deemed a misbranding. For instance, if the\r\n  fragments of stems and pieces of mushrooms which remain after the\r\n  canning of the mushrooms themselves be labeled “mushrooms” alone it\r\n  will be deemed misbranding. Such a package should be labeled “pieces\r\n  and stems of mushrooms” or some similar appellation. If the cores and\r\n  peelings of apples be labeled “apples” alone a similar condition is\r\n  presented and the name will be deemed insufficient and misleading.\r\n\r\n  5. If any essential or important ingredient of a food product be\r\n  abstracted, and such abstraction is not necessary nor usual in the\r\n  preparation or refining of such food body, the label should plainly\r\n  indicate the ingredient thus removed. For instance, if a portion\r\n  of the butter fat be removed from milk, even if there remain a\r\n  sufficient quantity of butter fat to comply with the standard, such\r\n  an abstraction is to be noted on the label.\r\n\r\n  6. A food product which is misbranded in respect to the locality\r\n  or country where it is made, produced, or manufactured, under the\r\n  provisions of the law is misbranded and is not entitled to entry. For\r\n  instance, if the product of one country, as the olive oils of Spain,\r\n  be sent to an Italian port and there bottled and labeled as Italian\r\n  oil, such a label will be deemed to be a misbranding. If wine grown\r\n  in Algeria or Italy be bottled in France as a French wine it will be\r\n  deemed a misbranded product.\r\n\r\n  7. If a food product bear a name which is in any way misleading in\r\n  regard to the quality, character, or origin of the product it is a\r\n  misbranding under the law and is a sufficient cause for the exclusion\r\n  of the goods covered by the invoice from entry.\r\n\r\n  8. The addition of the ordinary condimental substances to a food\r\n  product, such as sugar, vinegar, salt, spices, and wood smoke, may be\r\n  practiced without any notice to this effect appearing upon the label.\r\n\r\n  9. Food products of any given name are to correspond in quality to\r\n  the standards established by authority of Congress for such products,\r\n  and if they vary from this standard a notice to that effect is to\r\n  appear upon the label.\r\n\r\n  10. The presentation of properly labeled food products as outlined\r\n  above does not insure their admission. Such products, even when\r\n  properly labeled, may be refused entry because of threatened injury\r\n  to health or because they are of a nature forbidden in the country in\r\n  which they are made or from which they are exported.\r\n\r\n  11. The principal label on a food product, that is, the part of\r\n  the label which declares the character of the product, should not\r\n  be connected with any statement relating to the wholesomeness or\r\n  hygienic qualities of the product itself, nor should it contain any\r\n  reference to the laws relating to such products either applying to\r\n  the country where made or to this country. These are questions which\r\n  are reserved especially for the consideration of this Department by\r\n  act of Congress, and any attempt to prejudice the consumer regarding\r\n  the matter should not be connected in any way with the label itself.\r\n\r\n  12. The actual form and character of the label are left to the\r\n  judgment of the manufacturer. The regulations require certain notings\r\n  of added substances to be in the English language and of a size and\r\n  distinctness easily legible and occupying a position directly on the\r\n  label and not to the side nor on the margin, nor in any position\r\n  where the label itself could be read without the attention of the\r\n  reader being directed to the name of the added substance or other\r\n  special inscription.\r\n\r\n  13. The privilege of relabeling after arrival at a port in this\r\n  country, as hereby extended, shall cease on and after September 1,\r\n  1905, thus giving ample time for all cargoes now afloat to reach our\r\n  ports.\r\n\r\n  14. The name of the added substance or of the abstracted substance\r\n  required by the above regulations should appear as nearly as possible\r\n  in connection with the name of the food product upon the original\r\n  label and in a position as conspicuous as that of the food product\r\n  itself and as legible. The size of type required, namely, not smaller\r\n  than long primer capitals, is the minimum size which it is deemed\r\n  would be easily legible to a consumer in looking at a package of\r\n  food products as offered him in ordinary trade. The letters should\r\n  be not less in size nor less distinct in facing than the following\r\n  legend:\r\n\r\n  COLORED WITH SULFATE OF COPPER,\r\n\r\n  and in all cases this descriptive matter is to be printed in the\r\n  English language, whatever be the language used in naming the food\r\n  products. In all food products packed subsequent to September 1,\r\n  1905, the descriptive matter mentioned in this circular as necessary\r\n  for proper labeling will be required to be a part of the original\r\n  label and not attached as a paster. In food products packed and\r\n  labeled prior to September 1, 1905, the paster above described will\r\n  be admitted upon certificate of this fact until May 1, 1906, after\r\n  which only original labels of correct form are to be admitted as\r\n  sufficient for the purpose of correct labeling.\r\n\r\nPrevious decisions not in harmony with the present order are hereby\r\nmodified in accordance with the above regulations.\r\n\r\n  Approved:\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.

WILEY, CHIEF OF BUREAU.\r\n\r\nFOOD INSPECTION DECISIONS 27-30.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 27.)\r\n\r\nADMISSION OF SARDINES BOILED IN PEANUT OIL AND PACKED IN OLIVE OIL.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the conference held between the Chief of the Bureau of\r\nChemistry and the manufacturers and packers of sardines in Nantes,\r\nBordeaux, and Paris, it appears that it is a practice somewhat common\r\namong the packers of sardines to boil the fish in peanut oil previous\r\nto packing. It is claimed by some manufacturers that this process\r\nimproves the quality of the fish and also the color, and is a distinct\r\nadvantage in the preparation of the fish in packing. Subsequent to the\r\nboiling in peanut oil the fish are so placed as to secure a perfect\r\ndrainage, so that all oil which naturally would exude from the fish is\r\nseparated therefrom. In this condition they are afterwards packed in\r\npure olive oil. A small quantity of peanut oil remaining in the fish\r\ndiffuses in this way with the olive oil to such an extent that the oil\r\ngives a distinct reaction for peanut oil.\r\n\r\nPending further investigations of this process and its necessity,\r\ninspectors at the different laboratories are permitted to admit\r\nsardines labeled “Packed in Olive Oil” in which a small quantity\r\nof peanut oil is found; provided the invoice be accompanied by a\r\ncertificate, approved by the consul, to the effect that the oil used\r\nin packing the sardines was pure olive oil, and that previous to the\r\npacking the sardines had been treated in hot peanut oil as described\r\nabove. The regulations, F. I. D. 5 c and F. I. D. 11, are therefore\r\naccordingly modified, permitting the importation of sardines labeled\r\n“Packed in Olive Oil” when the quantity of peanut oil therein is\r\nfound not to exceed 5 percent, as nearly as can be determined with a\r\nreasonable toleration for difficulties of analysis, and variation in\r\nduplicates.\r\n\r\nThis amendment is of a provisional nature and will be in force until\r\nfurther investigations can be made and until further ordered.\r\n\r\n  Approved:\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., _September 23, 1905_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 28.)\r\n\r\nMAXIMUM QUANTITY OF SULFUROUS ACID IN WINES.\r\n\r\nAs a result of a conference between the Chief of the Bureau of\r\nChemistry and Professor Gayon and other members of the French committee\r\nof œnology and exporters of wines, held at Bordeaux, August 26, 1905,\r\nthe following modifications of F. I. D. 13, issued March 1, 1905, are\r\nmade:\r\n\r\nIt was learned from the French expert, Professor Gayon, who is the\r\nprincipal advisor of the committee of œnology, that steps have already\r\nbeen taken to prevent the excessive use of sulfur, which, it is\r\nadmitted, in years past has been practiced at times in the preparation\r\nof French white wines. The quantities of sulfur which are now permitted\r\nto be burned are prescribed for each kind of wine in order to avoid\r\nany excessive use. It is believed that by these new regulations the\r\nwines which are prepared subsequently to the issue of the regulations\r\nof March 1, referred to above, namely, the wines of the vintage of 1905\r\nand of subsequent vintages, will not contain a quantity of sulfurous\r\nacid in excess of the amounts specified in the regulations of F. I. D.\r\n13. Wines prepared previous to these regulations, however, may still\r\ncontain, even in the absence of notable quantities of sugar, more\r\nsulfurous acid than would be permissible under the existing provisional\r\nstandards.\r\n\r\nWith the desire to meet the wishes of the French makers and exporters\r\nwho are endeavoring now to diminish the quantity of sulfurous acid\r\nin white wines hereafter made, it is deemed advisable to modify the\r\nprovisional regulations slightly to avoid as much as possible any\r\nretroactive intent. It is therefore prescribed, provisionally, in\r\nmodification of F. I. D. 13, that wines imported into the United States\r\nfrom France or other countries, containing not to exceed 350 milligrams\r\nof sulfurous acid, may be admitted without respect to the quantity of\r\nsugar contained therein. There will also be permitted a tolerance of\r\n20 milligrams per liter to cover the difference in different samples\r\nand the variations incident to duplicate analyses. This modification\r\nof F. I. D. 13 will not apply to the wines of the vintage of 1905 nor\r\nto succeeding vintages. To wines of these vintages the provisional\r\nstandards provided in F. I. D. 13 will still apply until further orders.\r\n\r\n  Approved:\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., _September 23, 1905_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 29.)\r\n\r\nCOLORING MATTERS IN SYNTHETIC FOODS.\r\n\r\nThe term synthetic food as herein used is applied to a food product\r\nmade of a mixture of various other food products and not of itself\r\npossessed of any of the characteristics of a natural or uncompounded\r\nfood. Such food products should bear some special name not indicative\r\nof natural origin, character, or quality. A class of products typifying\r\nsuch synthetic foods is the product known as candy or confection. It\r\nhas been customary to use harmless artificial colors in such foods\r\nin preparing them for consumption. Such colors are not calculated to\r\ndeceive or mislead, because the foods themselves do not represent any\r\nnatural food product. The regulations of this Department applying to\r\nimported food products require that such products, when artificially\r\ncolored, should bear a legend on the label to that effect. This\r\nregulation should be construed to apply only to food products which\r\nof themselves have a natural color and in which the use of artificial\r\ncolors would tend to mislead or deceive the purchaser.\r\n\r\nUntil further orders synthetic food products, as described above, not\r\nhaving of themselves any natural color nor bearing any name which would\r\nindicate an origin relating to a food product of a definite color, may\r\ncontain harmless coloring matter without notice on the label. This\r\npermission is not to be construed, however, in any way which would\r\npermit the use of coloring matter if the product by its name indicates\r\na special origin. For instance, candies which are sold under the name\r\nof chocolates should not be permitted to carry a color imitating the\r\nnatural color of chocolate, and this principle should apply to other\r\nconfections bearing names of definite origin. The Department will not\r\nundertake to specify by name the colors which may be used further than\r\nto say that they must be of a harmless character, not injurious to\r\nhealth, and must comply with the laws and regulations of the countries\r\nfrom which the food products are imported.\r\n\r\n  Approved:\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., _September 27, 1905_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 30.)\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF PACKAGES MADE OF TIN PLATE, ON WHICH LABELS HAVE BEEN\r\nPRINTED FOR PRESERVED VEGETABLES, ETC., ORDERED AND DELIVERED TO\r\nMANUFACTURERS PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 1, 1905.\r\n\r\nFrom the investigations lately made by the Chief of the Bureau of\r\nChemistry, it appears that in a few instances European manufacturers\r\nof preserved vegetables, intended for export to the United States,\r\nhad provided a large number of packages made of tin, on which the\r\nlabels had been printed previous to the manufacture of the tin cans.\r\nThe printed matter can not be erased from the cans, nor can it be\r\nconveniently covered without destroying the artistic appearance of\r\nthe packages. These tin cans had been ordered and delivered to the\r\nmanufacturers before the publication of F. I. D. 26, requiring the\r\npresence of preservatives, coloring matters, etc., to be indicated upon\r\nthe original label and not attached by means of pasters subsequent to\r\nSeptember 1, 1905. In many cases considerable expense has been incurred\r\nby the manufacturers in the purchase of these tin cans with the labels\r\nprinted thereon.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as these packages were purchased in good faith and were not\r\nintended to disregard the regulations of the law relating to imported\r\nfood products, permission will be given to use them in packing\r\npreserved vegetables for the season of 1906 on the following conditions:\r\n\r\n1. That the tin cans in the possession of manufacturers shall have been\r\nordered and delivered previous to September 1, 1905.\r\n\r\n2. That the manufacturer shall make a statement before the consul in\r\neach case of the number of such packages which he had on hand at the\r\ndate mentioned.\r\n\r\n3. That the manufacturer shall attach a special paster, in a\r\nconspicuous place on the label, in such a way as to make it practically\r\nirremovable, indicating the presence of the preservative, coloring\r\nmatter, etc., which may have been used in the preparation of the\r\ncontents of the package, by the use of type not smaller than long\r\nprimer capitals, as shown in F. I. D. 6, and submit samples thereof to\r\nthis Department prior to shipment.\r\n\r\n4. That these packages already on hand may be used for the crop of\r\n1906, but not for a longer period.\r\n\r\n5. That the importation of these packages into the United States under\r\nthe regulations above mentioned shall not continue longer than May 1,\r\n1907.\r\n\r\n  Approved:\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.

WILEY, CHIEF OF BUREAU.\r\n\r\nFOOD INSPECTION DECISION 31.\r\n\r\n\r\nLABELS ON DETACHABLE WRAPPERS.\r\n\r\nIn the examination of certain imported goods to ascertain whether the\r\nrequirements of F. I. D. 17, of April 21, 1905, have been complied\r\nwith, instances have been found where wrappers on which a part of the\r\nlabel only is printed are used with packages, and the declarations\r\nrequired in the principal label (in conformity with the decision\r\nreferred to and other decisions) are omitted. Inspectors of imported\r\nfood products will be instructed to regard a package as misbranded if\r\na wrapper is placed over the label attached to the package and the\r\nstatements on said wrapper omit any of the declarations required on the\r\nprincipal label.\r\n\r\nAn illustration of this ruling is found in the examination of a recent\r\nimportation on the principal label of which it is stated that salicylic\r\nacid was used in the preparation of the sample. The package is inclosed\r\nin a wrapper on which is found a part of the label, namely, the name\r\nof the substance together with the name of the manufacturer, but no\r\nstatement of the fact that salicylic acid was used in its preparation.\r\nInasmuch as these packages may be sold without the removal of the\r\nwrapper, the wrappers would not in their present form convey the\r\nnecessary information to the purchaser and consumer.\r\n\r\nThe provisions of this decision will be enforced on and after January\r\n1, 1906.\r\n\r\n  Approved:\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.

WILEY, CHIEF OF BUREAU.\r\n\r\nFOOD INSPECTION DECISION 32.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOODS ENTERED FOR THE PURPOSE OF SALE TO OUTGOING SHIPS.\r\n\r\nAn importer has made the following statement relating to the labeling\r\nof certain products, namely:\r\n\r\n  We should like, however, to point out to you that our trade is one\r\n  by itself, and these goods, and mostly all the other goods that we\r\n  import, are not for consumption in the United States, but are shipped\r\n  by us on board foreign-going vessels. Our business is the ship-supply\r\n  trade, and these importations are brought in to enable us to give\r\n  the same supplies to the different vessels as we are in the habit\r\n  of furnishing in Great Britain. Under the circumstances, therefore,\r\n  we hope if we furnish bonds or give you a guarantee that any goods,\r\n  such as marmalade, imported by us would not be consumed in the United\r\n  States it would enable you to pass the goods as they have been of\r\n  late.\r\n\r\nThis is a case similar to F. I. D. 25, “Food Products Offered for Entry\r\nand Afterwards Declared to be for Technical Purposes.” The principle\r\ninvolved is that a declaration respecting the uses to which a food may\r\nbe put does not in any way affect its inspection when offered for entry\r\nand delivered to the consignee. If a food product be regularly offered\r\nfor importation into the United States the subsequent use to which it\r\nmay be put is not a matter which can affect in any way the duties of\r\nthe inspecting officers. It is not the duty of these officers to follow\r\nthe food into consumption nor to see what becomes of it after it is\r\ndelivered to the consignee. The duty of these officers is to see that\r\nthe food at the time of inspection conforms to the provisions of the\r\nlaw, that it has had no injurious substance added to it, that it is\r\nin a state fit for consumption, that it is properly labeled, and that\r\nit is not of a character forbidden sale or restricted in sale in the\r\ncountry where it is made or from which it is exported. If the foods in\r\nquestion conform to these provisions of the law, they are permitted to\r\nbe delivered to the consignee. The purpose of the consignee in securing\r\nthe goods and the disposition which he makes of them after they are\r\nsecured do not appear to have any bearing upon the subject of the\r\ninspection itself. In the present case it is declared that the goods\r\nare intended to be sold to outgoing steamships. At the time of sailing\r\nthese steamships are subject to the laws of the United States. The\r\nprovisioning of these ships is made under the laws of the United States\r\nwith articles of food produced in or imported into the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the enforcement of the law it makes no difference whether the foods\r\nare intended for disposition in this way or for ordinary consumption.\r\nIf it is desired to use such foods for transshipment, they could be\r\nentered in bond, never passed through the custom-house, and removed\r\nfrom bond and reshipped. If the foods are treated in this way, and\r\nthus never brought within the jurisdiction of the United States, this\r\nDepartment will have no control over them in any way whatever. They\r\nwould remain solely under the control of the Treasury Department, and\r\nthat Department would see to it that they were reshipped beyond the\r\njurisdiction of the United States. Even in this case it does not seem,\r\nhowever, that it would be possible to sell such goods for consumption\r\non ships carrying the American flag. The application of the importer\r\nfor a special ruling, therefore, in such cases is denied.\r\n\r\n  Approved:\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.

D. 33.)\r\n\r\nTHE IMPORTATION OF A BEVERAGE UNDER A MISLEADING NAME.\r\n\r\nA shipment of food product has been offered for importation labeled\r\n_Raspberry Vinegar_. On notice that it was held for inspection, a\r\nrepresentative of the importer appeared and stated that the substance\r\nwas not a vinegar, but a drink, and intended to be used as a beverage.\r\nIn this case the material is held to be misbranded, as a vinegar is\r\nnever intended for a beverage, but only as a condiment.\r\n\r\nNotice is given that after May 1, 1906, importations of this\r\ndescription, or similar thereto, will not be admitted if misbranded in\r\nthe manner mentioned. The name of the article, if descriptive, must\r\nindicate its true character. It is suggested that the term _Raspberry\r\nBeverage_ is a suitable designation. It will be held, however, that\r\nif so labeled it must be a beverage made solely from raspberries or\r\nraspberry juice, and not preserved with any substance unmentioned on\r\nthe label, except sugar, vinegar, or spices. Any substance added to\r\nsuch a product must not be injurious to health nor in violation of the\r\nlaws of the country whence it comes.\r\n\r\n  Approved:\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., _January 16, 1906_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 34.)\r\n\r\nPRESERVATIVES IN SAUSAGES.\r\n\r\nAn importer has made the following request:\r\n\r\n  About two years ago we had some difficulty with the Department of\r\n  Agriculture on account of an added preservative or acid being found\r\n  in German Frankfurter sausages. Our manufacturer has discontinued\r\n  using any preservative, and we find that the sausages do not keep\r\n  very well without this added preservative. We would ask you to kindly\r\n  let us know if there is any objection to our using salicylic acid,\r\n  boracic acid, benzoic acid, or, in fact, any preservative, if it is\r\n  plainly stated on the label.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as letters of this nature are occasionally received, it\r\nis deemed advisable to make a general statement concerning the\r\nattitude of this Department in matters of this kind. It is neither\r\npracticable nor advisable for the Department to act in the capacity of\r\nscientific adviser to any importer or manufacturer of food products.\r\nThe Department should be left free in all cases to decide according to\r\nthe existing law the fitness of any food product to be delivered to\r\nthe consignee. It can not, therefore, advise in respect of the use of\r\nany preservative or any other added substance further than is done in\r\nthe regular decisions published in this series. The addition of any\r\npreservative of any kind to a food product may be objected to for three\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\n(1) It may be a case of misbranding when the added body is not\r\nmentioned on the label.\r\n\r\n(2) The added substance itself may be deemed to be injurious to\r\nhealth either as the result of present knowledge or of subsequent\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\n(3) The added substance may be forbidden by the laws of the country in\r\nwhich the foods are made or from which they are exported.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the German sausage referred to, both boric and salicylic\r\nacids are prohibited by the German laws. Boric acid has been declared\r\nby this Department to be injurious to health. It does not appear that\r\nthere is any convincing reason for the use of any preservatives in\r\nsausages except the usual condimental ingredients--salt, vinegar,\r\nspices, and wood smoke.\r\n\r\nUntil the results of experiments conducted in the Bureau of Chemistry\r\nare declared, small quantities of benzoic acid and benzoates, salicylic\r\nacid and salicylates, sulfurous acid and sulfites and copper sulfate\r\nare permitted in food products when plainly declared upon the label and\r\nwhen not forbidden by the laws of the countries where the foods are\r\nproduced or from which they are exported. With respect to sulfurous\r\nacid in wine, this decision is not intended to supplant the principles\r\nlaid down in F. I. D. 28. This permission is given without prejudice\r\nto any future decision of the Department excluding such substances by\r\nreason of excessive quantity or as being prejudicial to health, or for\r\nother legal causes.\r\n\r\n  Approved:\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., _January 16, 1906_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 35.)\r\n\r\nMODIFYING IN CERTAIN CASES PROVISIONS IN F. I. D. 12 AND F. I. D. 26.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that in some cases the literal execution of\r\nthe provisions of F. I. D. 12, of March 1, 1905, relating to first\r\nnotice to importer, and of F. I. D. 26, relating to the date at which\r\nrelabeling after arrival in the United States may be permitted, namely,\r\nSeptember 1, 1905, may cause unnecessary annoyance and inconvenience.\r\nIt is therefore ordered that these two decisions be modified to permit\r\nin certain cases the importation of an article not labeled strictly in\r\nharmony with the provisions of the food-inspection laws after it is\r\nrelabeled in a manner satisfactory to the Department. Such action seems\r\nespecially desirable at the smaller ports, where exact information\r\nrespecting the requirements of the inspection of foods is not so easily\r\nobtainable.\r\n\r\nF. I. D. 26 is also amended so that in certain cases importation after\r\nrelabeling will be permitted. It is difficult to state exactly in what\r\ncases these amendments to F. I. D. 12 and F. I. D. 26 will be applied.\r\nIn general, it may be said that where a food product is misbranded, but\r\nno substance deleterious to health has been added, and where neither\r\nthe importer nor the shipper has had notice of the existence of the\r\nlaw or of its requirements, permission to relabel may be given. A\r\nsimilar permission will be extended to all food products already afloat\r\nat the time of receiving the first notice, or which are so advanced\r\nin shipment that they can not be countermanded by cable or otherwise.\r\nOther miscellaneous requests for permission to relabel will be decided\r\nupon the merits of the case presented, and permission to relabel be\r\ngranted when it is evident that neither negligence nor indifference is\r\nresponsible for the failure to secure a proper branding of the product.\r\nA similar permission will also be granted when it is apparent that the\r\npurpose of the law may thereby be fully accomplished. This action is\r\nnot to be taken in case of food products containing added substances\r\ninjurious to health or forbidden by the laws of the country from which\r\nthe substance comes.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is suggested to importers that all orders for\r\nfood products in the United States be given subject to the passing\r\nof the inspection at the ports of entry. It will not be considered\r\na sufficient excuse for the importation of improperly branded or\r\notherwise objectionable food products to show that they were paid for\r\nbefore the inspection took place. The law has now been in force long\r\nenough to acquaint foreign exporters with its existence and domestic\r\nimporters with its provisions. It is therefore held that paying for\r\nfood products before inspection is completed will not be deemed\r\na sufficient excuse for asking for the relabeling, remarking, or\r\nadmission thereof.\r\n\r\nThere are certain other cases in which relabeling of an importation of\r\nfood products may be permitted, but in no case will such a courtesy be\r\nextended where it is evident that either importer or exporter has had\r\nample opportunity and notice to comply with the provisions of the law.\r\nSuch cases include those where evidently honest attempts have been made\r\nto comply with the conditions of the law and where failure has been due\r\nto ignorance of the exact nature of the conditions required, or some\r\nunavoidable cause. These amendments are made to prevent unnecessary\r\nannoyance and hardships, and will not be construed in any way to excuse\r\na failure to comply with the conditions of the law where it is evident\r\nthat these conditions have been fully understood and opportunity\r\nafforded for their application.\r\n\r\n  Approved:\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., _January 16, 1906_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 36.)\r\n\r\nSUBSTANCES, ORDINARILY FOOD PRODUCTS, INTENDED FOR TECHNICAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe question has been raised on several occasions whether food products\r\nwhich are offered for importation for other purposes than to be used\r\nin foods are subject to the inspections of similar products when\r\nintended for consumption. It has been held (F. I. D. 32) that it is\r\nnot the purpose of the law, nor is it possible, to follow the ordinary\r\nfood product into consumption in order to determine to what use it is\r\nfinally put. The law levying duty on olive oils specifically provides\r\nthat when such oil is imported for mechanical purposes it is free from\r\nduty as an edible oil, provided it is in a condition of rancidity or\r\nother state which renders it unfit for consumption as human food. There\r\nis no statute covering a similar condition for other food products. It\r\nseems only reasonable, however, to apply this principle of law to other\r\nfood products when it can be done without complicating the question of\r\nthe ordinary inspection.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore held that a substance which ordinarily is considered a\r\nfood product, when offered for importation for technical purposes may\r\nbe admitted without inspection on the following conditions:\r\n\r\n(1) That in the invoice and accompanying declaration it is specifically\r\nstated that the substance in question is to be devoted solely to\r\ntechnical use.\r\n\r\n(2) That the substance be so denatured, either by natural or artificial\r\nmeans, as to render it unfit for consumption as human food.\r\n\r\nThis Department reserves the right to determine in any given case\r\nwhether or not the denaturing process is of a character which would\r\nrender it impracticable to recover the article in a form suitable for\r\nconsumption as human food. When substances ordinarily food products are\r\npresented hereafter for import into this country with the invoice and\r\ndeclaration above mentioned and in the denatured condition specified,\r\nthey will not be detained for inspection by this Department longer\r\nthan is necessary to ascertain the above facts. A denaturing process\r\nwill be held to be valid provided it so changes the taste of the\r\nfood product as to make it impossible for it to be consumed for food\r\npurposes, as, for instance, by the addition of an excessive quantity\r\nof common salt or other denaturing agent which would impart a taste of\r\nsuch a character as to cause it to be rejected by any one attempting to\r\nconsume it.\r\n\r\nThis decision shall not be considered in any way to change the opinion\r\nof this Department with reference to food products offered as such\r\nfor importation and afterwards declared to be intended for technical\r\npurposes, as stated in F. I. D. 25, of June 21, 1905.\r\n\r\n  Approved:\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., _January 18, 1906_.\r\n\r\n\r\nF. I.

D. 37.)\r\n\r\nLABELING OF CHOCOLATES.\r\n\r\nThe question of the proper marking of plain or bitter chocolates and\r\nsweet chocolates has arisen on several occasions in the inspection of\r\nimported food products, and, after full investigation of all the facts\r\nof the case and the relations of previous decisions thereto, it appears\r\nthat the following points are established:\r\n\r\n1. Chocolate, plain or bitter, is imported for cooking and not for\r\ndirectly edible purposes.\r\n\r\n2. Sweet chocolates are imported practically as a candy or confection.\r\n\r\nThis question is covered to a certain extent in F. I. D. 26, section 8,\r\nwhich reads as follows:\r\n\r\n  8. The addition of the ordinary condimental substances to a food\r\n  product, such as sugar, vinegar, salt, spices, and wood smoke, may be\r\n  practiced without any notice to this effect appearing upon the label.\r\n\r\nSection 9 limits the application of section 8. It reads as follows:\r\n\r\n  9. Food products of any given name are to correspond in quality to\r\n  the standards established by authority of Congress for such products,\r\n  and if they vary from this standard a notice to that effect is to\r\n  appear upon the label.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the standards adopted by authority of Congress\r\n(Circular No. 13, Office of the Secretary) that chocolate, plain or\r\nbitter, can not have any substances added to it not noted in the\r\nstandard and remain a standard product. If, therefore, chocolate, plain\r\nor bitter, have any starch or other substance added thereto for any\r\npurpose whatever, or sugar in insufficient quantities to make it a\r\nsweet chocolate, the addition of these bodies should be indicated by an\r\nappropriate statement on the label.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, sweet chocolate, being intended for and plainly\r\nbeing a confection, would not require a statement to the effect\r\nthat sugar had been added or a statement in regard to any of the\r\nother substances mentioned in the standard. If, however, any foreign\r\nsubstance other than that mentioned in the standard should be added to\r\na sweet chocolate, a proper statement indicating that fact would be\r\nrequired upon the label.\r\n\r\nThis decision is given without prejudice to revision in case it should\r\nbecome advisable, as a result of experience, to further distinguish\r\nbetween these two bodies by some appropriate designation.\r\n\r\n“Milk chocolate” will be considered as a sweet chocolate to which whole\r\nmilk (fresh, evaporated, or desiccated) has been added.\r\n\r\n  Approved:\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.

D. 38.)\r\n\r\nLABELING OF COCOAS.\r\n\r\nCocoas, in the preparation of which alkalis or other substances have\r\nbeen employed in order to increase the apparent solubility of the\r\nproduct, should bear on the label a declaration of such treatment.\r\nThe phrase “Prepared with Alkali” (or alkalis) or “Manufactured with\r\nAlkali” (or alkalis), or some similar treatment, would be a sufficient\r\nnotification. This declaration should also be in keeping with the\r\nprovisions of F. I. D. 26. The denomination of such products as\r\n“soluble cocoas” will not answer, since the term “soluble,” as used\r\nin this connection, is, to a certain extent, misleading. The apparent\r\nincreased solubility of products treated as above is due rather to the\r\nsuspension of the particles than to their solubility. The descriptions\r\nof the manufacture of these products show that potassium carbonate,\r\nsodium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, ammonium carbonate, and ammonium\r\nhydroxid are the principal alkaline salts employed. Tartaric acid is\r\nalso at times used to correct any undue alkalinity produced by these\r\nadded substances. The subject of the wholesomeness of these added\r\nproducts is reserved for further consideration.\r\n\r\n  Approved:\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.

A small amount of coloring matter is also frequently added to\r\nmacaroni. It appears that Martius yellow is often used for coloring\r\nthese products. This substance is held to be injurious to health and is\r\nso classed by the laws of several European countries, especially Italy,\r\nwhich has decreed that, among other colors, Martius yellow (dinitro\r\nyellow, naphthol yellow, Manchester yellow, saffron yellow, and gold\r\nyellow) must not be used in the preparation of foods. In view of this\r\nfact no importation of macaroni colored with Martius yellow or other\r\ncolors forbidden by the Italian law, or preserved with fluorids or\r\nother preservatives injurious to health, will be permitted after June\r\n1, 1906, and all importations of macaroni which contain any permissible\r\ncoloring matter must be labeled with the words “Artificially colored,”\r\nin accordance with F.

Attention is called to the fact\r\nthat when a general guaranty has been thus filed every package of\r\narticles of food and drugs put up under the guaranty should bear the\r\nlegend, “Guaranteed under the Food and Drugs Act, June 30, 1906,” and\r\nalso the serial number assigned thereto, if the dealer is to receive\r\nthe protection contemplated by the guaranty. No other word should go\r\nupon this legend or accompany it in any way. Particular attention is\r\ncalled to the fact that nothing should be placed upon the label, or in\r\nany printed matter accompanying it, indicating that the guaranty is\r\nmade by the Department of Agriculture. The appearance of the serial\r\nnumber with the phrase above mentioned upon a label does not exempt it\r\nfrom inspection nor its guarantor from prosecution in case the article\r\nin question be found in any way to violate the food and drugs act of\r\nJune 30, 1906.\r\n\r\n  Approved:\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.

D. 41.)\r\n\r\nAPPROVAL OF LABELS.\r\n\r\nNumerous requests are referred to this Department for the approval of\r\nlabels to be used in connection with articles of food and drugs under\r\nthe food and drugs act of June 30, 1906. This act does not authorize\r\nthe Secretary of Agriculture nor any agent of the Department to approve\r\nlabels. The Department therefore will not give its approval to any\r\nlabel. Any printed matter upon the label implying that this Department\r\nhas approved it will be without warrant. It is believed that with\r\nthe law and the regulations before him the manufacturer will have no\r\ndifficulty in arranging his label in harmony with the requirements set\r\nforth. If there be questions on which there is doubt respecting the\r\ngeneral character of labels, decisions under the food and drugs act\r\nwill be rendered, of a public character and published from time to\r\ntime, covering such points.\r\n\r\n  Approved:\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.

D. 42.)\r\n\r\nMIXING FLOURS.\r\n\r\nThe following communication has been received respecting the mixing of\r\nflours of different cereals:\r\n\r\n  In conformity with the custom of a century or more, the manufacturers\r\n  of rye flour, in order to produce a lighter and more easily worked\r\n  flour, have added a proportion of wheat flour to their rye and\r\n  branded it “Rye Flour.”\r\n\r\n  This custom simply conforms to the consumers’ demand for a whiter\r\n  loaf and from every standpoint is a perfectly legitimate operation.\r\n\r\n  Under the interpretation of the food and drugs act of June 30, 1906,\r\n  apparent restrictions are placed upon this compounding, and I would\r\n  therefore respectfully ask your ruling upon the following points:\r\n\r\n  1. Under this interpretation will it be necessary to add the word\r\n  “compound” to the brands?\r\n\r\n  2. Will it be necessary in accordance with this interpretation to\r\n  name in the brand the fact that a wheat admixture has been made, in\r\n  addition to the use of the word “compound,” providing that word is\r\n  necessary?\r\n\r\n  3. Referring to paragraph f, Regulation 17, which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n  “An article containing more than one food product or active medicinal\r\n  agent is misbranded if named after a single constituent,”\r\n\r\n  will it be permissible to still name the rye-wheat admixture “rye\r\n  flour”?\r\n\r\nThe food and drugs act of June 30, 1906, and the rules and regulations\r\nmade thereunder, provide for the proper marking of food product and\r\npenalties for misbranding.\r\n\r\nThe act also provides that a food product is not misbranded “in\r\nthe case of articles labeled, branded, or tagged so as to plainly\r\nindicate that they are compounds, imitations, or blends, and the word\r\n‘compound,’ ‘imitation,’ or ‘blend,’ as the case may be, is plainly\r\nstated on the package in which it is offered for sale.”\r\n\r\nKeeping in view these provisions of the law, and rules and regulations\r\nmade thereunder, it appears that the mixing of rye flour and wheat\r\nflour is not prohibited by the law provided the package is marked\r\n“compound” or “mixture,” the word standing alone and without\r\nqualification, and also if the label contain the information which\r\nshows that it is properly branded. The mixture may also be denominated\r\na “blend” if rye flour and wheat flour be regarded as like substances.\r\nIt is held that this information in the case mentioned would be a\r\nstatement of the ingredients used in making the compound. It is further\r\nheld that the use of an ingredient in small quantity simply for the\r\npurpose of naming it in the list of ingredients would be contrary to\r\nthe intent of the law, and therefore that the ingredients must be used\r\nin quantities which would justify the appearance of their names upon\r\nthe label. The statement made of the constituents used should be of a\r\ncharacter to indicate plainly that the article is a compound, mixture,\r\nor blend.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the above explanation that the naming of a mixture\r\nof this kind “rye flour” would be plainly a violation of the law and\r\nthe regulations made thereunder.\r\n\r\nAttention is called also to the act of Congress approved June 13, 1898,\r\nU. S. Revised Statutes, sections 36 to 49, inclusive, imposing special\r\ntaxes under the supervision of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on\r\nmixed flour.\r\n\r\n  Approved:\r\n\r\n  W. M.

D. 43.)\r\n\r\nRELABELING OF GOODS ON HAND.\r\n\r\nThe following is a type of numerous communications received concerning\r\nthe operation of the food law:\r\n\r\n  The retail grocers of our city, as well as some of the jobbers, are\r\n  very much concerned over stocks of canned goods and other similar\r\n  goods they might have in stock on January 1, 1907, when the new\r\n  pure-food act goes into effect.\r\n\r\n  We are under the impression that where there is nothing deleterious\r\n  to health contained in such goods so held it is not the Department’s\r\n  intention to interfere in any way, shape, or form with them.\r\n\r\n  Where these goods are held by retailers in our own city does this\r\n  come within the jurisdiction of the National law, or is it controlled\r\n  only by State laws?\r\n\r\nSimilar letters have been received relating to drugs, medicines, and\r\nother articles affected by the operation of the law. A general answer\r\nis deemed advisable, which, it is hoped, wilt cover the cases in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nSection (_i_) of Regulation 17 provides that--\r\n\r\n  The regulation regarding the principal label will not be enforced\r\n  until October 1, 1907, in the case of labels printed and now on\r\n  hand, whenever any statement therein contained which is contrary to\r\n  the food and drugs act, June 30, 1906, as to character of contents,\r\n  shall be corrected by a supplemental label, stamp, or paster. All\r\n  other labels now printed and on hand may be used without change until\r\n  October 1, 1907.\r\n\r\nIt is held that under this regulation labels which contain statements\r\nrelating to the name of manufacturer, the place of manufacture,\r\netc., which are not in harmony with the general meaning of the law\r\nmay be used if on hand on the 1st of January, 1907, the day on which\r\nthe regulations become effective. Any statement, however, respecting\r\nthe character of the contents which is false or misleading should be\r\ncorrected as indicated. The correction should secure the obliteration\r\nof the misstatement either by placing the supplemental label or paster\r\nover it or obliterating it in some other way. If the goods contain\r\nartificial color or preservative other than ordinary condimental\r\nsubstances (salt, sugar, vinegar, wood smoke, spices, and condiments\r\nof all kinds), that fact should appear upon the supplemental stamp or\r\npaster. If any of the words required to be placed upon drugs and foods\r\nin the specific wording of the act do not appear upon the label, such\r\nas alcohol, opium, etc., it is held that the correction must include\r\nthe enumeration of these substances, as provided for in Regulations 28\r\nand 29.\r\n\r\nIf goods that are packed and sealed in a carton which contains the\r\nbottle or other package also sealed and labeled were not in the hands\r\nof the manufacturer after January 1, 1907, but had been already\r\ndelivered to the jobber or dealer, it will be held sufficient to mark\r\nthe external carton alone, provided the goods are sold only in the\r\nunbroken carton. If the container, however, holds a large number of\r\nseparate packages, it will be necessary that each of the separate\r\npackages to be sold as such shall be labeled with the words required\r\nspecifically by the act.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that Regulation 17, section (_i_), is for\r\nthe purpose of avoiding the expense of relabeling articles already\r\npacked and branded at the time the regulations go into effect and which\r\nnecessarily could not have been so packed and branded with any intent\r\nto evade the provisions of the law, and it is expected that jobbers and\r\ndealers will do everything in their power to bring the packages now\r\non hand into as close harmony with the provisions of the act and the\r\nregulations made thereunder as possible.\r\n\r\nAll articles in the hands of manufacturers, jobbers, and dealers on\r\nthe 1st day of January, 1907, which are sold wholly within the State\r\nin which they are found on that date are exempt from the provisions\r\nof the act. Thus the use of the supplemental label, stamp, or paster\r\nis required only on those articles which on or after the 1st day of\r\nJanuary, 1907, enter interstate commerce or are offered for sale in\r\nthe District of Columbia and the Territories. It is believed that\r\nthe provisions of Regulation 17, section (_i_), can be complied with\r\nwithout great annoyance and expense. It will be deemed sufficient if\r\nthe supplemental pasters and labels are attached at the time the goods\r\nare shipped beyond the State line, that is, they need not necessarily\r\nbe attached to such article on the 1st day of January, but at any\r\ntime thereafter when prepared for interstate commerce. Thus the labor\r\nof meeting this requirement will be distributed according to the\r\nexigencies of actual trade. On and after October 1, 1907, the label\r\nmust be originally properly printed, and no further amendment will be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n  Approved:\r\n\r\n  W. M.

D. 44.)\r\n\r\nSCOPE AND PURPOSE OF FOOD-INSPECTION DECISIONS.\r\n\r\nFrom the tenor of many inquiries received in this Department it appears\r\nthat many persons suppose that the answers to inquiries addressed to\r\nthis Department, either in letters or in published decisions, have\r\nthe force and effect of the rules and regulations for the enforcement\r\nof the food and drugs act of June 30, 1906. The following are\r\nillustrations of the inquiries received by this Department:\r\n\r\n  Must we stamp all goods as conforming to the drug and food law,\r\n  whether they have alcohol and narcotics therein, or not?\r\n\r\n  On a brand of salad oil, which is a winter-strain cottonseed oil, can\r\n  it be sold under the brand of salad oil, or must it state that it is\r\n  cottonseed oil?\r\n\r\nIt seems highly desirable that an erroneous opinion of this kind\r\nshould be corrected. The opinions or decisions of this Department do\r\nnot add anything to the rules and regulations nor take anything away\r\nfrom them. They therefore are not to be considered in the light of\r\nrules and regulations. On the other hand, the decisions and opinions\r\nreferred to express the attitude of this Department in relation to\r\nthe interpretation of the law and the rules and regulations, and they\r\nare published for the information of the officials of the Department\r\nwho may be charged with the execution of the law and especially to\r\nacquaint manufacturers, jobbers, and dealers with the attitude of\r\nthis Department in these matters. They are therefore issued more\r\nin an advisory than in a mandatory spirit. It is clear that if the\r\nmanufacturers, jobbers, and dealers interpret the rules and regulations\r\nin the same manner as they are interpreted by this Department,\r\nand follow that interpretation in their business transactions, no\r\nprosecution will lie against them. It needs no argument to show that\r\nthe Secretary of Agriculture must himself come to a decision in\r\nevery case before a prosecution can be initiated, since it is on his\r\nreport that the district attorney is to begin a prosecution for the\r\nenforcement of the provisions of the act.\r\n\r\nIn so far as possible it is advisable that the opinions of this\r\nDepartment respecting the questions which arise may be published. It\r\nmay often occur that the opinion of this Department is not that of the\r\nmanufacturer, jobber, or dealer. In this case there is no obligation\r\nresting upon the manufacturer, jobber, or dealer to follow the line of\r\nprocedure marked out or indicated by the opinion of this Department.\r\nEach one is entitled to his own opinion and interpretation and to\r\nassume the responsibility of acting in harmony therewith.\r\n\r\nIt may be proper to add that in reaching opinions and decisions on\r\nthese cases the Department keeps constantly in view the two great\r\npurposes of the food and drugs act, namely, to prevent misbranding\r\nand to prohibit adulteration. From the tenor of the correspondence\r\nreceived at this Department and from the oral hearings which have been\r\nheld, it is evident that an overwhelming majority of the manufacturers,\r\njobbers, and dealers of this country are determined to do their\r\nutmost to conform to the provisions of the act, to support it in every\r\nparticular, and to accede to the opinions of this Department respecting\r\nits construction. It is hoped, therefore, that the publication of the\r\nopinions and decisions of the Department will lead to the avoidance\r\nof litigation which might arise due to decisions which may be reached\r\nby this Department indicating violations of the act, violations\r\nwhich would not have occurred had the opinions and decisions of the\r\nDepartment been brought to the attention of the offender.\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., _December 1, 1906_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 45.)\r\n\r\nBLENDED WHISKIES.\r\n\r\nMany letters are received by the Department making inquiries concerning\r\nthe proper method of labeling blended whisky. Manufacturers are anxious\r\nto know the construction placed by the Department upon this particular\r\npart of the food and drugs act of June 30, 1906, and to ascertain under\r\nwhat conditions the words “blended whisky” or “whiskies” may be used.\r\nThe following quotation from one of these letters presents a particular\r\ncase of a definite character:\r\n\r\n  On account of the uncertainty prevailing in our trade at the present\r\n  time as to how to proceed under the pure-food law and regulations\r\n  regarding what will be considered a blend of whiskies, I am taking\r\n  the liberty of expressing to you to-day two samples of whisky made up\r\n  as follows:\r\n\r\n  Sample A contains 51 percent of Bourbon whisky and 49 percent of\r\n  neutral spirits. In this sample a small amount of burnt sugar is\r\n  used for coloring, and a small amount of prune juice is used for\r\n  flavoring, neither of which increases the volume to any great extent.\r\n\r\n  Sample B contains 51 percent of neutral spirits and 49 percent of\r\n  Bourbon whisky. Burnt sugar is used for coloring, and prune juice\r\n  is used for flavoring, neither of which increases the volume to any\r\n  great extent.\r\n\r\n  I have marked these packages “blended whiskies” and want your ruling\r\n  as to whether it is proper to thus brand and label such goods.\r\n\r\n  My inquiry is for the purpose of guiding the large manufacturing\r\n  interests in the trade that I represent.\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent letter from the same writer the following additional\r\nstatement is made:\r\n\r\n  The reason for wanting your decision or ruling in this matter is just\r\n  this: No house in the trade can afford to put out goods and run the\r\n  risk of seizure and later litigation by the Government on account of\r\n  the odium that would be attached to fighting the food and drugs act.\r\n\r\nThe question presented is whether neutral spirits may be added to\r\nBourbon whisky in varying quantities, colored and flavored, and the\r\nresulting mixture be labeled “blended _whiskies_.” To permit the use of\r\nthe word “whiskies” in the described mixture is to admit that flavor\r\nand color can be added to neutral spirits and the resulting mixture\r\nbe labeled “whisky.” The Department is of opinion that the mixtures\r\npresented can not legally be labeled either “blended whiskies” or\r\n“blended whisky.” The use of the plural of the word “whisky” in the\r\nfirst case is evidently improper for the reason that there is only one\r\nwhisky in the mixture. If neutral spirit, also known as cologne spirit,\r\nsilent spirit, or alcohol, be diluted with water to a proper proof for\r\nconsumption and artificially colored and artificially flavored, it does\r\nnot become a whisky, but a “spurious imitation” thereof, not entirely\r\nunlike that defined in section 3244, Revised Statutes. The mixture of\r\nsuch an imitation with a genuine article can not be regarded as a\r\nmixture of like substances within the letter and intent of the law.\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., _December 1, 1906_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  F. I. D. 46, as amended.                        Issued March 22, 1907.\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE,\r\n\r\nBUREAU OF CHEMISTRY,\r\n\r\nH. W. WILEY, CHIEF OF BUREAU.\r\n\r\nFOOD INSPECTION DECISION 46, AS AMENDED.\r\n\r\nFICTITIOUS FIRM NAMES.\r\n\r\n  F. I. D. 46, ISSUED ON DECEMBER 13, 1906, ON THE SUBJECT OF\r\n  FICTITIOUS FIRM NAMES, IS HEREBY AMENDED TO READ AS FOLLOWS, FOR\r\n  THE PURPOSE OF OBVIATING ANY AMBIGUITY THAT MAY HAVE EXISTED IN THE\r\n  ORIGINAL DECISION. THE AMENDED PORTION IS SET IN ITALICS.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from a letter is typical of a question frequently\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n  In connection with our manufacture of flavoring extracts, we produce\r\n  an article containing a certain percentage of artificial coumarin and\r\n  vanillin. This product has been placed on the market under the name\r\n  of ---- and Company, a fictitious firm, although dealers have always\r\n  understood that it was our product. Is there any objection to our\r\n  continuing to brand the product as manufactured by ---- and Company?\r\n\r\nThe same question has frequently been asked by importers who state that\r\nthey desire to assume the responsibility for particular brands.\r\n\r\nIt has been held by the Attorney-General (F. I. D. 2) that--\r\n\r\n  the words “... Daisy Sugar Corn, ---- ---- Company, Milwaukee, Wis.,”\r\n  clearly imply that the goods referred to are manufactured or prepared\r\n  by that company in Wisconsin. The general public, unfamiliar with\r\n  trade practices, would inevitably reach that conclusion.\r\n\r\nRegulation 18 provides that if the name of the manufacturer and the\r\nplace of manufacture be given, they must be the true name and the\r\ntrue place. If would appear, therefore, that the use of a fictitious\r\nname in such a manner that it would be understood to be the name of\r\nthe manufacturer would be clearly a violation of Regulation 18. It is\r\napparent that the provisions of Regulation 18 will not be fulfilled by\r\nthe nominal incorporation of a fictitious firm. The regulations require\r\nthat goods must be actually manufactured by the firm represented on the\r\nlabel as the manufacturer.\r\n\r\nWhen a proper name, other than that of the manufacturer, is placed upon\r\na label it must not be used in the possessive. For instance,\r\n\r\n  CHARLES GASTON’S\r\n  OLIVE OIL\r\n  BORDEAUX\r\n\r\ncan only be properly used on an oil manufactured by Charles Gaston at\r\nBordeaux. The same is true if the designation\r\n\r\n  GASTON’S\r\n  OLIVE OIL\r\n  BORDEAUX\r\n\r\nbe employed.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the word “Gaston” might be used in an adjective\r\nsense, and not in the possessive case as qualifying the words “olive\r\noil,” in a manner that would indicate that it represented a brand and\r\nnot a manufacturer, as\r\n\r\n  GASTON OLIVE OIL.\r\n\r\nOr,\r\n\r\n  OLIVE OIL, GASTON BRAND.\r\n\r\nIn such case, however, neither given name nor initials should be\r\nemployed. The word “Gaston” should be in the same type as “olive oil”\r\nand in equal prominence, thus forming a part of the label.\r\n\r\n_The phrase “Olive Oil, Charles Gaston Brand,” may be used, in which\r\ncase the name of the actual manufacturer should appear, in order that\r\nno false indication of the name of the person or firm manufacturing the\r\nproduct may be given._\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., _February 21, 1907_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 47.)\r\n\r\nFLAVORING EXTRACTS.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of alcohol is not required to be stated in the case of\r\nextracts sold for the preparation of foods only. It is held, however,\r\nthat extracts which are sold or used for any medicinal purpose whatever\r\nshould have the percentage of alcohol stated on the label.\r\n\r\nNumerous inquiries are received regarding the proper designation of\r\nproducts made in imitation of flavoring extracts or in imitation of\r\nflavors. Such products include “Imitation vanilla flavor,” which is\r\nmade from such products as tonka extract, coumarin, and vanillin, with\r\nor without vanilla extract. They may also include numerous preparations\r\nmade from synthetic fruit ethers intended to imitate strawberry,\r\nbanana, pineapple, etc. Such products should not be so designated as\r\nto convey the impression that they have any relation to the flavor\r\nprepared from the fruit. Even when it is not practicable to prepare\r\nthe flavor directly from the fruit, “imitation” is a better term than\r\n“artificial.”\r\n\r\nThese imitation products should not be designated by terms which\r\nindicate in any way by similarity of name that they are prepared from\r\na natural fruit or from a standard flavor. The term “venallos,” for\r\ninstance, would not be a proper descriptive name for a preparation\r\nintended to imitate vanilla extract. Such products should either be\r\ndesignated by their true names, such as “vanilla and vanillin flavor,”\r\n“vanillin and coumarin flavor,” or by such terms as “imitation vanilla\r\nflavor” or “vanilla substitute.”\r\n\r\nArticles in the preparation of which such substitutes are employed\r\nshould not be labeled as if they were prepared from standard flavors\r\nor from the fruits themselves. For instance, ice cream flavored with\r\nimitation strawberry flavor should not be designated as “strawberry ice\r\ncream.” If sold as strawberry ice cream without a label the product\r\nwould appear to be in violation of Regulation 22.\r\n\r\nArtificial colors should be declared whenever present.\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., _December 13, 1906_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 48.)\r\n\r\nSUBSTANCES USED IN THE PREPARATION OF FOODS.\r\n\r\nThe following letter was recently received at the Department of\r\nAgriculture:\r\n\r\n  We import a preparation of gelatin preserved with sulfurous acid for\r\n  the purpose of fining wine. This gelatin is not used as a food and\r\n  does not remain in the wine, although a small amount of the sulfurous\r\n  acid may be left in the wine. Please inform us if the sale of this\r\n  product is a violation of the food law.\r\n\r\nIt is held that the products commonly added to foods in their\r\npreparation are properly classed as foods and come within the scope of\r\nthe food and drugs act. The Department can not follow a food product\r\ninto consumption in order to determine the use to which it is put.\r\nPending a decision on the wholesomeness of sulfurous acid as provided\r\nin Regulation 15 (_b_), its presence should be declared.\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.

D. 49.)\r\n\r\nTIME REQUIRED TO REACH DECISIONS ON DIFFERENT PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH\r\nTHE FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, JUNE 30, 1906.\r\n\r\nMany letters have reached the Department asking for action on very\r\nimportant questions connected with the food and drugs act which require\r\nmuch study and time to secure all the facts necessary to the rendering\r\nof a just decision. It is quite impossible to answer all such letters\r\nin detail. The following general statement shows the attitude of the\r\nDepartment on questions of this kind:\r\n\r\nAll manufacturers and dealers have copies of the law and regulations\r\nor can secure them and study them carefully. Each manufacturer and\r\ndealer should conduct his business as nearly as possible in harmony\r\nwith the law as he interprets it. When each particular problem involved\r\nreaches a solution in this Department, it is hoped it will be found\r\nthat the manufacturers and jobbers have come also to a similar decision\r\nin the matter. Public notice will be given of each decision as it is\r\nissued, that the manufacturers and dealers may be informed and be\r\nable at once to place themselves in line with the decisions of the\r\nDepartment. In this way it is hoped that all injustice will be avoided\r\nin the execution of the law and everyone be given an opportunity to put\r\nhimself right and to have due notice of decisions which may be made.\r\n\r\nThe Department will use every endeavor to reach prompt decisions, but\r\nmust take time to collect the facts and subject them to a proper study;\r\notherwise the decisions would not have the value which should attach to\r\nthem in important matters affecting the execution of the law.\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., _January 8, 1907_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 50.)\r\n\r\nIMITATION COFFEE.\r\n\r\nA manufacturer writes as follows:\r\n\r\n  We beg to ask for your opinion as regards the hyphenated word\r\n  “Cereal-Coffee,” and whether or not we are entitled to its use\r\n  for a cereal substitute for coffee.... In our opinion the term\r\n  “Cereal-Coffee” would come under the so-called trade-name and\r\n  distinctive name.\r\n\r\nIt is held that since the product mentioned is not a coffee it can not\r\nproperly be called by the term mentioned. Regulation 20 (d) provides\r\nthat a distinctive name shall give no false indication of character.\r\nThe use of the name “cereal-coffee” might be taken to indicate that the\r\nproduct is coffee or has the properties of coffee, and hence the use\r\nof this term does not comply with the definition of distinctive name.\r\nEven if the product consist in part of coffee, the name would not be\r\ncorrect. It is suggested that products of this nature be designated as\r\n“imitation coffee,” as provided in Regulation 21 (f). In such case the\r\nword “imitation” should be in uniform type, on uniform background, and\r\nshould be given equal prominence with the word “coffee.”\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., _January 18, 1907_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 51.)\r\n\r\nCOLORING OF BUTTER AND CHEESE.\r\n\r\nNumerous inquiries, of which the following is an illustration, have\r\nbeen received by the Department:\r\n\r\n  Will you kindly inform me concerning the coloring of butter and\r\n  cheese under the pure-food law? Would it be unlawful to color butter\r\n  and cheese as now practiced?\r\n\r\nThe coloring of butter is specifically permitted in the law of August\r\n2, 1886 (24 Stat., 209), and the coloring of cheese in the law of June\r\n6, 1896 (29 Stat., 253). It is held by the Department that the food\r\nand drugs act does not repeal the provisions of the acts referred to\r\nabove and the addition of harmless color to these substances may be\r\npracticed as therein provided, and that the presence of coloring matter\r\nspecifically recognized by acts of Congress as a constituent is not\r\nrequired to be declared on the label.\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., _January 18, 1907_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 52.)\r\n\r\nFORM OF LABEL.\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract from a letter recently received.\r\n\r\n  We do not understand the requirements of the regulations respecting\r\n  the arrangement of labels; that is, the order in which the various\r\n  features of the label should be arranged.\r\n\r\nTo meet the requests for the opinion of the Department regarding the\r\nproper arrangement of a label, the following order is suggested:\r\n\r\n1. Name of substance or product.\r\n\r\n2. In case of foods, words which indicate that the articles are\r\ncompounds, mixtures, or blends, and the word “Imitation,” “Compound,”\r\nor “Blend,” as the case may be.\r\n\r\n3. Statements designating the quantity or proportion of the ingredients\r\nenumerated in the law, or derivatives and preparations of same,[53]\r\nas mentioned under Regulation 28; also statements of other extraneous\r\nsubstances whose presence should be declared, such as harmless coloring\r\nmatter, or any necessary statement regarding grade or quality.\r\n\r\n  [53] Attention is called to the fact that the declaration of alcohol\r\n  and its derivatives is not required in foods.\r\n\r\n(The statements specified in paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, should appear\r\ntogether without any intervening descriptive or explanatory matter.)\r\n\r\n4. Name of manufacturer (if given).\r\n\r\n5. Place of manufacture (if given, or when required in case of food\r\nmixtures or compounds bearing a distinctive name).\r\n\r\nIt is stated in Regulation 17 that if the name of the manufacturer and\r\nplace of manufacture be given they should appear upon the principal\r\nlabel. Although the law does not require that the name of the\r\nmanufacturer be given, or the place of manufacture, except in case of\r\nfood mixtures and compounds having a distinctive name, it is held that\r\nif they are given they must be true, and should be placed with the\r\nrequired information on the principal label. The arrangement of the\r\nlabel is the same for both food and drug products and an example of\r\neach is given.\r\n\r\n                        _Sample label for food product._\r\n                                +--------------------------------------+\r\n  [Name of product.]            |              KETCHUP.                |\r\n                                |                                      |\r\n  [Declaration required by      |         ARTIFICIALLY COLORED.        |\r\n  paragraphs 2 and 3.]          |                                      |\r\n                                |                                      |\r\n                                | [Descriptive matter, if desired, but |\r\n                                |    preferably at bottom of label.]   |\r\n                                |                                      |\r\n  [Name of manufacturer, if     |            BLANK & CO.,              |\r\n  given.]                       |                                      |\r\n  [Place of manufacture, if     |            PORTLAND, ME.             |\r\n  given.]                       |                                      |\r\n                                |  [Descriptive matter, if desired.]   |\r\n                                +--------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n                  _Sample label for drug product._\r\n                               +--------------------------------------+\r\n  [Name of product.]           |             COUGH SYRUP.             |\r\n                               |                                      |\r\n  [Declarations required by    | ALCOHOL, 10 PERCENT.                 |\r\n  paragraphs 2 and 3.]         | MORPHIN, ¹⁄₂ GRAIN PER               |\r\n                               |   OUNCE.                             |\r\n                               | CHLOROFORM, 40 MINIMS                |\r\n                               |   PER OUNCE.                         |\r\n                               |                                      |\r\n                               | [Descriptive matter, if desired, but |\r\n                               |    preferably at bottom of label.]   |\r\n                               |                                      |\r\n  [Name of manufacturer, if    |         JOHN JONES & CO.,            |\r\n  given.]                      |                                      |\r\n  [Place of manufacture, if    |         WASHINGTON, D.

Statements\r\nregarding the reason for using alcohol, artificial coloring matter,\r\nand other extraneous substances, come under the head of descriptive\r\nor explanatory matter, and should not be interspersed with the\r\ndeclarations required under Nos. 2 and 3.\r\n\r\nThe information called for under No. 3 should be so worded as to give\r\nonly the required information, as, for example, “alcohol 17 percent”\r\nor “artificially colored.” All numbers used in expressing quantity or\r\nproportion of substances required to be stated (see Regulation 28)\r\nshould be expressed in the Arabic notation.\r\n\r\nEach substance required to be declared under No. 3 should be printed on\r\na separate line and in type specified in Regulation 17 (c).\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., _January 18, 1907_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 53.)\r\n\r\nFORMULA ON THE LABEL OF DRUGS.\r\n\r\nMany inquiries are received relative to the necessity of giving the\r\nformula of medicinal remedies on the label. The following is typical:\r\n\r\n  I should like to know if it will be necessary for me to state on a\r\n  label the name of the products from which I prepare my proprietary\r\n  medicine in order to conform with the pure food and drugs act. If\r\n  I do this, it will prohibit me from manufacturing and selling a\r\n  remedy which is a secret of my own; and anyone buying it could,\r\n  from the label, tell what ingredients were used in its preparation\r\n  and make his own supply of this medicine. How does the United\r\n  States Government expect to protect those who have secret medicinal\r\n  preparations they wish to sell at a profit? If the Pure Food\r\n  Commission desires, I will send them a sample bottle of my medicine\r\n  for their inspection and approval.\r\n\r\nThe food and drugs act, June 30, 1906, does not require the formula\r\nof drug products to be given on the label, but requires only that the\r\nquantity or proportion of the ingredients enumerated in the law, and\r\nderivatives and preparation of same (Regulation 28), shall be clearly\r\nset forth on the label or labels of all preparations used for the\r\ntreatment or prevention of disease, either internally or externally,\r\nfor man or other animals. This includes sample packages as well as\r\nregular trade packages.\r\n\r\nThe question is also frequently asked whether a medicinal preparation\r\nwould be exempt from the operation of the law if the formula were given\r\non the label. The formula on the label is very desirable, but this\r\ninformation is not required by the law. The act forbids the use of any\r\nstatement, design, or device in connection with any drug product which\r\nis false or misleading in any particular. A defect of this kind would\r\nnot be corrected by giving the formula on the label. If the formula is\r\ngiven, it must be the correct and complete formula. It is held that, in\r\naddition to those substances required by the act to be named, if only a\r\npart of the active medicinal agents used in the manufacture of a drug\r\nproduct are set forth on the label, such a procedure is misleading and\r\ntherefore forbidden by the law. All drug products and their labels must\r\nconform to the act, whether the formula is or is not given on the label.\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.

D. 54.)\r\n\r\nDECLARATION OF THE QUANTITY OR PROPORTION OF ALCOHOL PRESENT IN DRUG\r\nPRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nThe question of stating the percentage of alcohol present in drug\r\nproducts has caused a multitude of inquiries. The following questions\r\nalong this line serve as examples:\r\n\r\n  Is it necessary to give the amount of alcohol present in U. S.\r\n  Pharmacopœial or National Formulary products? It seems to me that\r\n  such a requirement is absurd, and not contemplated within the spirit\r\n  of the act. None of them are patent medicines. Will I be compelled to\r\n  tell how much alcohol is present in such goods?\r\n\r\n  If we apply for and obtain a serial number, must we in addition to\r\n  putting this number on our labels state the percent of alcohol?\r\n\r\n  Will it be necessary to give the percent of alcohol present in such\r\n  products as ether, chloroform, collodion, spirit of nitrous ether,\r\n  and similar preparations?\r\n\r\nThe law is specific on the subject of declaring the amount of\r\nalcohol present in medicinal agents, as can readily be seen from the\r\nfollowing language: “An article shall also be deemed misbranded ...\r\nif the package fail to bear a statement on the label of the quantity\r\nor proportion of any alcohol ... contained therein. No medicinal\r\npreparations are exempt, whether they are made according to formulæ\r\ngiven in the U. S. Pharmacopœia or National Formulary or formulæ taken\r\nfrom any other source. The serial number, with or without the guarantee\r\nlegend, does not exempt a preparation from this requirement. The law\r\ndoes not make any statement as to the amount of alcohol that may or may\r\nnot be employed. It requires, however, that whatever amount be present\r\nshall be set forth on the label. The percentage of alcohol given on the\r\nlabel should be the percentage of absolute alcohol by volume contained\r\nin the finished product. The manner in which it should be printed is\r\nshown in F. I. D. 52.\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., _March 13, 1907_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 55.)\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF STATING QUANTITY OR PROPORTION OF PREPARATIONS (CONTAINING\r\nOPIUM, MORPHIN, ETC.) USED IN MANUFACTURING OTHER PREPARATIONS.\r\n\r\nMany inquiries are received as to the method of stating the quantity\r\nor proportion of preparations (containing opium, morphin, etc.) used\r\nin the manufacture of other preparations. Of these the following are\r\ntypical:\r\n\r\n  If the label on the bottle were to bear the words “Tincture of\r\n  Opium,” I reason that as this is a definite preparation, constituting\r\n  a preparation of opium, and so definite as to its composition\r\n  that to any intelligent person it expresses definitely all that\r\n  it is desirable to express, the use of this title alone should be\r\n  sufficient. I feel that as a preparation it is distinct from opium,\r\n  and if this particular tincture is used in the manufacture of a\r\n  preparation the mention of it alone should be sufficient.\r\n\r\n  Where extract or tincture of cannabis indica, or extract of opium,\r\n  is employed in making other drug products, would it not be complying\r\n  with the law if the use of such articles be clearly indicated on the\r\n  label as prescribed by the law, or is it necessary to give the actual\r\n  amounts of the drugs themselves represented by these preparations?\r\n\r\nNames of drug products bearing any of the names of the ingredients\r\nenumerated in the act are construed as representing “preparations”\r\nwithin the meaning of the act; and if the same are clearly declared\r\nupon the label as required by Regulations 17 and 30, it will not be\r\nnecessary to give the actual amount of the primary drugs used or\r\nrepresented by such article. It is desirable, however, that the word\r\nor words used in the law shall constitute the first part of the name\r\nof the product. For example: “Opium, Tincture of;” “Cannabis Indica,\r\nExtract of,” followed by the amount of tincture or extract used.\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., _March 13, 1907_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 56.)\r\n\r\nNAMES TO BE EMPLOYED IN DECLARING THE AMOUNT OF THE INGREDIENTS AS\r\nREQUIRED BY THE LAW.\r\n\r\nMany inquiries are coming to this Department relative to the names\r\nthat may be employed in declaring the quantity or proportion of the\r\ningredients, as required by Congress.\r\n\r\nThe following are representative:\r\n\r\n  The word “alcohol” has received so much unfavorable notoriety during\r\n  the last few years that we hesitate to place it upon our labels.\r\n  Could we not employ some other words in place of it, such as “cologne\r\n  spirits,” “spirits of wine,” “pure grain alcohol,” etc.?\r\n\r\n  Would it be satisfactory for us to use “Phenylacetamid,” or the\r\n  following formula, C₆H₅(CH₃CO), for the chemical acetanilid?\r\n\r\n  One of our preparations contains trichlorethidene ethyl alcoholate,\r\n  which would undoubtedly under the law be considered a derivative of\r\n  chloral hydrate. Will it be satisfactory for us to use this name on\r\n  our trade packages in giving the amount of this chemical present in\r\n  the product?\r\n\r\n  In the manufacture of some of our products we use opium. It would,\r\n  however, be a financial loss to state this fact on the label. Could\r\n  we not say this preparation contains 20 grains of the concentrated\r\n  extract of the _Papaver somniferum_ to the fluid ounce?\r\n\r\n  Dover’s powder is mentioned in the regulations as one of the\r\n  preparations of opium. It would seem sufficient at first glance that\r\n  Dover’s powder as a preparation, if mentioned on the label, would be\r\n  all that could be required as to opium.\r\n\r\nOne of the objects of the law is to inform the consumer of the presence\r\nof certain drugs in medicines, and the above terms do not give the\r\naverage person any idea as to the presence or absence of such drugs.\r\nIn enumerating the ingredients, the quantity or proportion of which\r\nis required to be given upon the principal label of any medicinal\r\npreparation in which such ingredients may be present, the act uses\r\nonly common names, and the permission to use any but such common names\r\nfor any ingredients required to be declared upon the label is neither\r\nexpressed nor implied in any part of the law.\r\n\r\nThe term used for acetanilid is “acetanilid” and not phenylacetamid.\r\nNo reference is made to the use of the chemical formula in designating\r\nthe presence of chemicals. The words “chloral hydrate” appear in the\r\nact, but not the chemical name trichlorethidene glycol. It can readily\r\nbe seen that if the act were not closely adhered to in this connection\r\nthere would soon be such a confusion and multiplicity of names and\r\nphrases that one of the objects of the act would be defeated.\r\n\r\nThe names to be employed in stating the quantity or proportion of the\r\ningredients required by the act to appear on the label of all medicinal\r\npreparations containing same are--\r\n\r\nFirst. Those used in the law for the articles enumerated; example,\r\n“alcohol,” not “spiritus rectificatus.”\r\n\r\nSecond. In the case of derivatives: (_a_) The name of the parent\r\nsubstance used in the act should constitute part of the name; example,\r\n“chloral acetone,” not “trichlorethidene dimethyl ketone.” (_b_) The\r\ntrade-name, accompanied in parentheses by the name of the parent\r\nsubstance; example, “dionin (morphin derivative).”\r\n\r\nThird. Names of preparations containing the name of some ingredient\r\nused in the act. In such cases the name used in the act should\r\nconstitute the first portion of the name of the preparation. (See F. I.\r\nD. 55.)\r\n\r\nFourth. Common names (such as laudanum, Dover’s powder, etc.) of\r\npreparations containing an ingredient enumerated in the law, provided\r\nsuch name or names are accompanied in parentheses by some such\r\nphrase as “preparation of opium” or “opium preparation,” followed by\r\nthe number of minims or grains, as specified in the regulations; for\r\ninstance, “laudanum (preparation of opium), 40 minims per ounce.”\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., _March 13, 1907_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 57.)\r\n\r\nPHYSICIANS’ PRESCRIPTIONS.\r\n\r\nTHE STATUS OF PACKAGES COMPOUNDED ACCORDING TO PHYSICIANS’\r\nPRESCRIPTIONS AND ENTERING INTO INTERSTATE COMMERCE.\r\n\r\nPackages resulting from the compounding of physicians’ prescriptions\r\nunder the food and drugs act are the subject of many queries, of which\r\nthe following are representative:\r\n\r\n  If a druggist compounds a physician’s prescription and sends it into\r\n  an adjoining State, will it be necessary to state upon the label the\r\n  amount of alcohol, morphin, etc., that may be present?\r\n\r\n  Supposing a regularly licensed practicing physician has patients\r\n  located in various States of the Union and supplies medicines to\r\n  them through the mails, by express, and otherwise, do such packages\r\n  come under the provisions of the law, and, if so, can the required\r\n  information be given in pen and ink on the label?\r\n\r\n  We treat drug addictions on a very gradual tonic treatment reduction\r\n  plan. For instance, if John Doe writes for information as to the\r\n  home treatment for his addiction, I send him a symptom blank which\r\n  contains, among other questions, an inquiry as to the kind of drug\r\n  he uses, how he uses it, the length of time he has used it, etc. In\r\n  addition to giving me a complete history of his case, he states he\r\n  is using 10 grains of sulf. of morphin (each twenty-four hours),\r\n  hypodermically or internally, as the case may be. In prescribing in\r\n  his case I immediately put him on just one-half of the amount he\r\n  reports as his daily allowance, combining same with a bitter tonic.\r\n\r\n  It is necessary for the reduction in drug cases to be made without\r\n  the patient’s knowledge. It is, of course, understood by all\r\n  physicians that you can not trust a drug habitué to properly make his\r\n  own reductions, for, as a matter of fact, if he knew to what extent\r\n  I was reducing his daily allowance of opiates, he would imagine the\r\n  reduction too rapid, he would get frightened, and would take to his\r\n  former drug for relief. Treatment prepared in this way I do not\r\n  think would come under the head of a proprietary preparation or a\r\n  patent medicine, as I prescribe the contents of each bottle to meet\r\n  the requirements of each individual patient. All instructions as\r\n  to the conduct of treatment and the use of auxiliary remedies are\r\n  given by letter; consequently there are no printed labels or cartons\r\n  containing any claims concerning the efficacy of this treatment.\r\n\r\n  I would be pleased to have you inform me whether in your opinion I\r\n  would be violating the pure-food law in any manner, shape, or form\r\n  should I continue to label my preparations as I am now doing, and in\r\n  having them prepared in ---- and forwarded direct to my patients in\r\n  this and other States.\r\n\r\nIf a package compounded according to a physician’s prescription be\r\nshipped, sent, or transported from any State or Territory or the\r\nDistrict of Columbia to another State or Territory or the District of\r\nColumbia by a compounder, druggist, physician, or their agents, by\r\nmail, express, freight, or otherwise, the label upon such package is\r\nrequired to bear the information called for by Congress. If, however,\r\nthe patient himself, or a member of his household, or the physician\r\nhimself carries such package across a State line, and such package is\r\nnot subject to sale, it is held that such package need not be marked\r\nso as to conform with the law, because such a transaction is not\r\nconsidered one of interstate commerce.\r\n\r\nThe package may be marked so as to comply with the act by either\r\nstamp, pen and ink, or typewriter, provided all such written matter\r\nis distinctly legible and on the principal label, as prescribed in\r\nRegulation 17.\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., _March 13, 1907_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 58.)\r\n\r\nTHE LABELING OF PRODUCTS USED AS FOODS AND DRUGS AS WELL AS FOR\r\nTECHNICAL AND OTHER PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nFrequent requests for information relative to the proper labeling\r\nof products bearing the names of foods and drugs, but used also for\r\ntechnical and other purposes, are received. The following are typical:\r\n\r\n  We will kindly ask you to advise us in regard to the new law that\r\n  governs the line of oils. We manufacture a compound product,\r\n  so-called “turpentine,” which contains pure turpentine and a very\r\n  fine petroleum product. It is used in most branches where pure\r\n  turpentine is used, with the exception of medicinal purposes, for\r\n  which we do not sell it.\r\n\r\n  We understand that if we were to sell any cottonseed oil so branded\r\n  as to indicate that it was intended to be used as a food, as, for\r\n  example, under the brand “Blank Salad Oil,” it would be necessary\r\n  to observe the requirements of the law referred to; but we are in\r\n  doubt and would be glad to have your opinion as to whether a sale or\r\n  shipment of this oil (for lubricating purposes) under the ordinary\r\n  trade-brand of cottonseed oil, and without anything to indicate that\r\n  it was of a quality suitable for use as a salad oil, would subject us\r\n  to the provisions of the act.\r\n\r\nDuring personal interviews the question of marking chemical reagents\r\nhas also been discussed.\r\n\r\nProducts used in the arts and for technical purposes are not subject\r\nto the food and drugs act. It is, however, a well-recognized fact\r\nthat many articles are used indiscriminately for food, medicinal, and\r\ntechnical purposes. It is also well known that some products employed\r\nfor technical purposes are adulterated or misbranded within the meaning\r\nof this act. Inasmuch as it is impossible to follow such products into\r\nconsumption in order to determine to what use they are finally put,\r\nit is desirable that an article sold under a name commonly applied to\r\nsuch article for food, drug, and technical purposes be so labeled as\r\nto avoid possible mistakes. The ordinary name of a pure and normal\r\nproduct, whether sold for food, drug, technical, or other purposes,\r\nis all that is necessary. Pure cottonseed oil or turpentine may be\r\nsold without any restrictions whatever, whether such article is sold\r\nfor food, medicinal, or technical purposes, but it is suggested that\r\na cottonseed oil intended for lubricating purposes, or a so-called\r\nturpentine consisting of a mixture of turpentine and petroleum oils,\r\nused by the paint trade, be plainly marked so as to indicate that they\r\nare not to be employed for food or medicinal purposes. Such phrases as\r\nthe following may be used: “Not for Food Purposes,” “Not for Medicinal\r\nUse,” or for “Technical Purposes Only,” or “For Lubricating Purposes,”\r\netc.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid complication it is suggested that chemical reagents\r\nsold as such be marked with such phrases as the following: “For\r\nAnalytical Purposes,” or “Chemical Reagent,” etc.\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., _March 13, 1907_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 59.)\r\n\r\nNATIONAL FORMULARY APPENDIX.\r\n\r\nThe National Formulary is one of the standards recognized under the\r\nlaw. The question has been asked a number of times whether the appendix\r\nof this authority would be construed as part and parcel of the book\r\nitself. On page iv of the preface it is distinctly stated that the\r\nformulæ collected in the appendix of the National Formulary are “no\r\nlonger designated as ‘N. F.’ preparations.” This shows that these\r\nformulæ are not integral parts of the book under the law, which covers\r\nonly those products of the National Formulary recognized as such by\r\nthis authority. By this it is understood that if a drug product is\r\nsold under a name contained in the appendix of the National Formulary,\r\nit will not be necessary for such product either to conform to the\r\nstandard indicated by the formula or to declare upon the label its\r\nown standard strength, quality, and purity if a different formula is\r\nemployed in its manufacture. Such articles are, however, subject to the\r\nlaw in every other respect, as is the case of other medicinal products\r\nnot recognized by the U. S. Pharmacopœia or National Formulary.\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., _March 13, 1907_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 60.)\r\n\r\nMINOR BORDER IMPORTATIONS.\r\n\r\nInquiry has frequently been made regarding the application of\r\nRegulation 33 (requiring a declaration to be attached to the invoice)\r\nto foods and drugs brought into the United States in small quantities\r\nby farmers living near the border. One correspondent says:\r\n\r\n  Farmers along the border are in the habit of occasionally bringing\r\n  in, in their own teams, maple sugar in small quantities, also butter\r\n  and like articles of food products of their own raising, and offering\r\n  the same for entry at the different offices on the frontier.... The\r\n  main question is as to whether or not the affidavits and other proof\r\n  required by the pure-food law shall be required in these instances of\r\n  minor importations of this class of articles.\r\n\r\nConsidering the nature of these importations it is held that Regulation\r\n33 does not apply to them and that they may be imported without the\r\ndeclaration. Such products are subject to inspection, however, and if\r\nfound to be in violation of the law will be excluded.\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., _March 25, 1907_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 61.)\r\n\r\nCOCOA BUTTER SUBSTITUTES.\r\n\r\nA manufacturer writes:\r\n\r\n  We use in the preparation of chocolate sticks a guaranteed pure\r\n  production of cocoanut oil. May this product be sold merely as\r\n  confectionery, and not as chocolate sticks? If not, would it be\r\n  satisfactory for us to mark the product as “Chocolate sticks prepared\r\n  with substitute butter”?\r\n\r\nRegulation 22 prohibits the sale, or offer for sale, in interstate or\r\nforeign commerce or in the District of Columbia or in any Territory\r\nof the United States, of a food or drug product which bears no label\r\nwhatever if said product be an imitation of or offered for sale under\r\nthe name of another article. It would clearly be a violation of the\r\nlaw to sell an article which was made in imitation of chocolate, even\r\nthough it be sold under the general name of a confection. Such an\r\narticle should be labeled in such a manner as to correctly represent\r\nits true nature.\r\n\r\nRegulation 25 (_a_) provides:\r\n\r\n  When a substance of a recognized quality commonly used in the\r\n  preparation of a food or drug product is replaced by another\r\n  substance not injurious or deleterious to health, the name of the\r\n  substituted substance shall appear upon the label.\r\n\r\nIt is held that cocoa butter is the only fat that can be used in\r\nchocolate. The declaration of foreign fats merely as “substitute\r\nbutter” is apparently not sufficient; the nature of the fat employed\r\nshould be stated.\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., _March 25, 1907_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 62.)\r\n\r\nGUARANTY ON IMPORTED PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nMany inquiries of the following type have been received by the\r\nDepartment:\r\n\r\n  We will take it as a favor if you will advise us if (since our goods\r\n  are all imported and so must pass the custom-house before being sold)\r\n  the fact of their having passed the customs authorities and the\r\n  Department of Agriculture examination is not in itself a guaranty\r\n  that they conform with the pure-food laws as defined by the act of\r\n  Congress approved June 30, 1906, entitled “An act for preventing the\r\n  manufacture, sale, or transportation of adulterated or misbranded or\r\n  poisonous or deleterious foods, drugs, medicines, liquors,” etc.\r\n\r\nThe Department makes a systematic inspection of imported foods and\r\ndrugs when they arrive at the custom-houses; and while such inspection\r\ndoes not include an examination of samples taken from every package of\r\nthe aforesaid articles, it is sufficient to indicate that the article\r\nis suitable to enter the country and be sent into interstate commerce\r\nas long as it retains its identity in the unbroken package. If imported\r\nfoods and drugs are taken from the original packages and repacked, they\r\nbecome subject to inspection as if of domestic origin, and the persons\r\nhandling and selling said articles are not immune from prosecution\r\nin the event that a subsequent inspection discloses that all or any\r\nportion of said foods or drugs are adulterated or misbranded according\r\nto the provisions of said statute or the regulations made thereunder.\r\n\r\nOnly a wholesaler, jobber, manufacturer, or other party residing in the\r\nUnited States can give a guaranty within the meaning of said act. A\r\nforeign manufacturer or other foreign dealer can not give the guaranty\r\nprescribed in said law, nor can the agent of such foreign manufacturer\r\nor dealer give said guaranty unless such agent be a resident of the\r\nUnited States and unless he actually sells the goods covered by the\r\nguaranty.\r\n\r\nThe person who owns and sells imported goods can make a guaranty for\r\nthe purpose aforesaid, though the goods may be shipped directly by the\r\nfirm of whom the guarantor buys them to the customer of the guarantor.\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., _March 25, 1907_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 63.)\r\n\r\nUSE OF THE WORD “COMPOUND” IN NAMES OF DRUG PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nMany inquiries are received concerning the use of the word “compound”\r\nin names of drug products. There seems to be a general impression that\r\nthis word can be applied as a corrective to many misbranded products.\r\nThe following extracts serve as examples:\r\n\r\n  You have on file our formula (active agents--croton oil and cascara),\r\n  and we would ask if it is possible to call the same “castor pill\r\n  compound” and comply with the regulations?\r\n\r\n  This liniment has been in use for forty years. The ingredients, each\r\n  separately and collectively, are sanitary and highly curative. The\r\n  one ingredient after which it was named happens to be present in\r\n  the least proportion. Can not the compound be called by the name\r\n  “Compound Sassafras Cream”?\r\n\r\nAn eminent jurist writes:\r\n\r\n  I shall be glad to know the views entertained by your Department\r\n  as to when a druggist has satisfied this act by a label or printed\r\n  matter which he puts on the package or bottle in relation to a\r\n  compound. Take, for example, the product put on the market as\r\n  Cascarin Compound, or Aloin Compound. I am impressed with the fact\r\n  that such label must have added a statement as to what the other\r\n  ingredients of the compound are. This may not mean, and probably does\r\n  not mean, that the formula must be given or the exact proportions,\r\n  but a purchaser has the right to know what is in the compound in\r\n  order to determine for himself, or to receive proper advice, as to\r\n  whether it is safe to be used.\r\n\r\nIn no case can a preparation be named after an ingredient or drug which\r\nis not present. The word “compound” should not be used in connection\r\nwith a name which in itself, or together with representations and\r\ndesigns accompanying same, would be construed as a form of misbranding\r\nunder the act.\r\n\r\nIt is held that if a mixture of drugs is named after one or more but\r\nnot all of the active medicinal constituents (not vehicle) present in\r\na preparation, the word “compound” can be used in connection with the\r\nname, (_a_) provided the active constituent after which the product\r\nis named is present in an amount at least equal to that of any other\r\nactive medicinal agent present. Example: If it is desired Lo make a\r\nmixture consisting of oil of sandalwood, balsam copaiba, and castor\r\noil, and call this product “Oil of Sandalwood Compound,” the oil of\r\nsandalwood should constitute at least 33¹⁄₃ percent of the entire\r\nmixture. Or (_b_) provided the potent active constituent after which\r\nthe product is named is present in sufficient amount to impart the\r\npreponderating medicinal effect. Example: If a product is named after\r\nthe active constituent, strychnine, the strychnine or one of its salts\r\nshould be present in sufficient amount to produce the preponderating\r\nmedicinal effect of the preparation. Or (_c_) provided the complete\r\nquantitative formula, as outlined in the United States Pharmacopœia\r\nand National Formulary, be given on the principal label. A declaration\r\nof the complete quantitative formula, however, does not exempt the\r\nmanufacturer or dealer from giving the information required by the act\r\nin the manner prescribed by the regulations. The ounce shall be the\r\nunit. The amounts of the ingredients present (excepting alcohol, which\r\nis to be stated in percent) shall be given in grains or minims, and if\r\nit is desired the metric equivalent may be given in addition.\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., _March 23, 1907_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(F. I. D. 64.)\r\n\r\nLABELING OF SARDINES.\r\n\r\nMany inquiries have been made of this Department respecting the extent\r\nto which the term “sardine” can be used in food products entering into\r\nforeign or interstate commerce. The question of the proper labeling of\r\nfish of this kind was submitted by the Department to the Department\r\nof Commerce and Labor, Bureau of Fisheries. After reviewing the\r\nnomenclature and trade practices the Department of Commerce and Labor\r\nreached the following conclusion:\r\n\r\n  Commercially the name sardine has come to signify any small, canned,\r\n  clupeoid fish; and the methods of preparation are so various that\r\n  it is impossible to establish any absolute standard of quality. It\r\n  appears to this Department that the purposes of the pure-food law\r\n  will be carried out and the public fully protected if all sardines\r\n  bear labels showing the place where produced and the nature of the\r\n  ingredients used in preserving or flavoring the fish.\r\n\r\nIn harmony with the opinion of the experts of the Bureau of Fisheries,\r\nthe Department of Agriculture holds that the term “sardine” may be\r\napplied to any small fish described above, and that the name “sardine”\r\nshould be accompanied with the name of the country or State in which\r\nthe fish are taken and prepared, and with a statement of the nature of\r\nthe ingredients used in preserving or flavoring the fish.\r\n\r\nIt is held that a small fish of the clupeoid family, caught upon or\r\nnear the shores of and packed in oil in Norway, or smoked and packed in\r\noil, is properly labeled with the phrase “Norwegian Sardines in Oil,”\r\nor “Norwegian Smoked Sardines in Oil,” the nature of the oil being\r\ndesignated. In like manner a small fish of the clupeoid family caught\r\nupon or near the shores of and packed in France may be called “French\r\nSardines in Oil,” the nature of the oil being specified. Following the\r\nsame practice, a fish of the clupeoid family caught on or near the\r\nshores of and packed in the United States may be labeled “American\r\nSardines Packed in Oil,” or “Maine Sardines Packed in Oil,” or be\r\ngiven some similar appellation, the nature of the oil being stated. It\r\nis suggested that the name of the particular fish to which the term\r\nsardine is to be applied should also be placed upon the label--for\r\nexample, “Pilchard,” “Herring,” etc.\r\n\r\n  JAMES WILSON,\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.
