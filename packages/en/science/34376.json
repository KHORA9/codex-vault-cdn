U.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nTen years ago aviculture had hardly been thought of as a school subject.\r\nTo-day it is taught in thousands of schools, and in some states\r\ninstruction in poultry culture is required by law. This rapid change in\r\nsentiment and situation has resulted from a combination of causes. When\r\nagricultural colleges established poultry departments, it was found that\r\na large part of those applying for admission to them had neither the\r\npractical knowledge of poultry nor the general education that they\r\nneeded to do work of college grade. About this time also the interest in\r\nnature study began to take a more practical turn, and attention was\r\ndirected to the superiority of domesticated to wild animals and plants\r\nas material for school studies of the phenomena of physical life. Added\r\nto these special causes was a general cause more potent than either:\r\ngreat numbers of people had reached the stage of experience in various\r\nlines of aviculture where they realized keenly that a little sound\r\ninstruction in the subject in youth would have been of great value to\r\nthem later in life, saving them from costly mistakes. To these people it\r\nseemed both natural and necessary that the schools should teach poultry\r\nand pigeon culture.\r\n\r\nDeveloping as the result of such a combination of causes, the demand for\r\nan elementary textbook on poultry came with equal force from country\r\nschools, where poultry might be kept on the school grounds as well as by\r\nevery pupil at home, from city schools, in which all instruction must be\r\nby book, and from all types of schools and conditions of life between.\r\nHad there been only the extreme classes of schools to consider, the\r\nnatural way to supply the demand would be with a special book for each\r\ndistinct type of school. The idea of one book for all schools, from\r\nwhich each might use what seemed to suit its requirements, was dismissed\r\nas impractical while so large a proportion of teachers were but slightly\r\nacquainted with the subject. It is believed that the plan of making an\r\nelementary reading course for general use, and a secondary book of a\r\nmore technical character for use where practice courses are given, is\r\nthe best solution of the problem under existing conditions.\r\n\r\nIn this first book the object is to tell in plain language the things\r\nthat every one ought to know about poultry, pigeons, and cage birds; to\r\nteach fundamental facts in such a way that they will be fixed in the\r\nmind; to excite interest in the subject where none existed; and to\r\ndirect enthusiasm along right lines. While the demand has been almost\r\nwholly for a poultry book, pigeons and cage birds are included, because\r\nthey are of more interest than some kinds of poultry and better adapted\r\nthan any other kind to the conditions of city life.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the time that should be given to this course, one period a\r\nweek for forty weeks is better than a period a day for forty days,\r\nbecause the average person, young or old, retains a great deal more of\r\nwhat is read or heard about a diversified subject if the ground is\r\ncovered by easy stages with comparatively long intervals between.\r\nReferences for collateral readings and suggestions for original\r\ninvestigations are omitted, because, in the author's opinion, what work\r\nof this kind it is desirable for a high-school pupil to do should be\r\ndone by those taking practice work in the advanced course.\r\n\r\n                                        JOHN H.

The covering of\r\nfeathers is the only character common to all birds and not possessed by\r\nany other creature. The other characters--the bill, the wings,\r\negg-laying, etc.--by which we usually distinguish birds from animals of\r\nother kinds are not exclusive bird characters. Turtles have beaks, and\r\nthere is one species of mammal (the ornithorhynchus) which has a bill\r\nlike that of a duck. Many insects and one species of mammal (the bat)\r\nfly. Insects, fishes, and reptiles lay eggs, and there are several rare\r\nspecies of mammals that lay eggs and incubate them. On the other hand,\r\nsome birds are deficient in one or more of the typical bird characters.\r\nThe ostrich cannot fly. The penguin can neither fly nor run, and cannot\r\neven walk well. The cuckoo lays its eggs in the nests of other birds,\r\nleaving to them the hatching and rearing of its young. These exceptional\r\ncases are very interesting because they show that animals now quite\r\ndifferent in structure and habits had a common origin, but in no case is\r\nthere such a combination of characters that any doubt arises whether the\r\ncreature is a bird or a mammal. The characters which typically belong to\r\nbirds attain their highest development in them, and in most cases this\r\nis due to peculiar adaptabilities of the feathers.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Saxons' name for a bird was _fugol_ (the flying animal). The\r\nyoung feathered creature they called _bridd_ (the thing brooded). This\r\nname was also sometimes given to young mammals, but it applied\r\nespecially to the young of feathered creatures which were more dependent\r\nupon the parent for warmth than others. Our English words \"fowl\" and\r\n\"bird\" come from these Anglo-Saxon terms. At first \"fowl\" was applied to\r\nlarge birds and \"bird\" to small ones, but gradually the use of the name\r\n\"fowl\" was limited to the common domestic fowl, and \"bird\" became the\r\ngeneric name for all feathered creatures.\r\n\r\n=Place of birds in the animal kingdom.= Zooelogists rank mammals higher\r\nthan birds because man is a mammal and his general superiority to other\r\ncreatures determines the rank of the class to which he belongs. Yet,\r\nwhile placing birds below mammals in a simple classification of animals,\r\nnaturalists point out that birds are the most distinct class in the\r\nanimal kingdom. If we compare birds and the lower mammals, and compare\r\nthe relations of each class to man, we see at once that nothing else\r\ncould take the place of birds either in nature or in civilization. Among\r\nbirds are found the highest developments of animal locomotion and of the\r\nnatural voice, capacity for language far beyond that of other creatures\r\n(except man), and family and community relations resembling those of the\r\nhuman race. Hitherto in the history of the world mammals have been more\r\nuseful to man than birds, but birds have given him some of his best\r\nideas, and with the advance of civilization the lower mammals become\r\nless necessary and birds more necessary to him.\r\n\r\n=Flight of birds.= It has been said that \"on the earth and on the sea\r\nman has attained to powers of locomotion with which, in strength,\r\nendurance, and velocity, no animal movement can compare. But the air is\r\nan element on which he cannot travel, an ocean which he cannot navigate.\r\nThe birds of heaven are still his envy, and on the paths they tread he\r\ncannot follow.\"\r\n\r\nSince that was written practical flying machines have been invented, but\r\nin these, as in boats and ships, man has merely devised a machine which\r\nunder his control can do laboriously and at great risk what the bird\r\ndoes naturally and easily. To birds man is indebted for his first\r\nlessons in navigating the water as well as for his ideas about airships.\r\n\r\n=Voices of birds.= With few exceptions the different kinds of animals\r\nhave natural languages through which individuals of the same species can\r\nto some extent hold communication with each other, and which are partly\r\nintelligible to other creatures. In all mammals except man, and in most\r\nbirds, the range of expression is very limited and the sound of the\r\nvoice is disagreeable; but a great many species of birds have very\r\npleasing notes, many have very beautiful natural songs, and some readily\r\nlearn the songs of other species. Man learned melody from the song\r\nbirds. There are also many species of birds that can imitate a great\r\nvariety of sounds, and even learn to speak words and short sentences.\r\nBirds that learn to talk often show intelligence in their use of words.\r\nThis is the more remarkable because the intelligence of birds is not of\r\na high order, but is distinctly inferior to that of the common\r\ndomesticated mammals.\r\n\r\n=Social relations of birds.= In aerial birds (except the cuckoos) the\r\nmale and female pair, build a nest, and both take part in the incubation\r\nof the eggs and the feeding of the young. Usually a pair once mated\r\nremain mated for life and are very devoted to each other. In wild land\r\nbirds the pairing habit is not of advantage to a species, but still the\r\ntendency to single matings is very strong. When land and water birds are\r\ndomesticated man tries to break them of this habit because the males\r\nproduce no eggs and he prefers to eat them while they are young and\r\ntheir flesh is tender. But, as will appear in detail when the different\r\nspecies of birds of this class are described, he does not always succeed\r\nin doing this. Even the domestic fowl and duck, in which pairing has\r\nbeen prevented for centuries, often show a strong tendency to pair; and\r\nthe females with broods of young usually separate from the flock until\r\nthe little ones no longer need their care. With this separate family\r\nlife there is still in most species of birds concerted action by\r\ncommunities in migrations, in forming colonies, in attacks on other\r\ncreatures, and in defense from enemies. From the earliest times of which\r\nwe have knowledge the devotion of birds to their mates and to their\r\nyoung has afforded the most common and most beautiful illustration of\r\nfamily life in nature.\r\n\r\n=Place of birds in domestication.= The place of birds among domestic\r\nanimals corresponds to that of garden vegetables, small fruits, and\r\nflowers among cultivated plants. The great staple agricultural\r\ncrops--corn, wheat, oats, barley, hay, apples, oranges, horses, cattle,\r\nsheep, hogs, etc.--are produced mostly by men who make farming and\r\nstock-growing their business. But, while large quantities of garden\r\nvegetables, small fruits, flowers, poultry, pigeons, etc. are grown by\r\npeople who specialize in them, the greater part of the supply in all\r\nlands comes from small gardens and small flocks on ordinary farms and in\r\nthe back yards of town homes.\r\n\r\n=Uses of birds in domestication.= With the exception of the cage birds\r\nand the ostrich, all our domestic birds are valuable for their flesh;\r\nbut, as some kinds can be produced more easily and cheaply than others,\r\npeople growing birds for the table give most attention to those that can\r\nbe grown most profitably, and the others are grown principally by those\r\nwho prize them for rarity, beauty, or some peculiar quality.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of all birds are edible, but birds differ greatly in the number\r\nof eggs that they lay and in the disposition to lay them in places\r\nprovided for the purpose. So, nearly all who keep birds for their eggs\r\nkeep fowls, which are the most prolific and most docile, and hens' eggs\r\nare the staple eggs in the markets.\r\n\r\nThe feathers of birds are used for pillows and beds, for feather\r\ndusters, and in various ways for ornament. Except in the case of the\r\nostrich, however, the value of the feathers of domesticated birds is so\r\nsmall that no one grows birds primarily for their feathers. On the\r\nother hand, those who keep birds for pleasure find their greatest\r\nenjoyment in breeding them with colors and markings difficult to\r\nproduce. Choice specimens of fancy-bred birds bring prices many times\r\ngreater than the value of their flesh and eggs for food and of their\r\nfeathers for use or ornament. Fancy feathers have no more value than\r\nothers except on the living birds.\r\n\r\nWhile those who keep birds for pleasure nowadays give most attention to\r\nbreeding fancy stock for exhibition, several kinds of pigeons are kept\r\nto entertain by their flying performances; and--outside of the limited\r\nclass of those who breed them especially for exhibition--canaries are\r\nvalued according to ability to sing. The brutal sport of cockfighting\r\nwas a popular pastime with our ancestors until prohibited by law, and is\r\nstill prevalent in many lands. In early times birds of prey were\r\ncaptured when very young and carefully trained to hunt for their\r\nmasters. Under the feudal system there were regulations prescribing the\r\nkinds of birds which different classes of men might use in this way: the\r\neagle and vulture were for emperors only; the gyrfalcon for kings; the\r\nlesser falcons for nobles; the harrier for esquires; the merlin for\r\nladies; the goshawk for yeomen; the kestrel for servants; the sparrow\r\nhawk for priests.\r\n\r\nMuch of the value of various kinds of poultry comes from their ability\r\nto destroy insects which damage vegetation, and to maintain themselves\r\non these and on foods not available for the larger domestic mammals. The\r\nservices of poultry in this respect being limited to those insects that\r\ncan be secured from the ground, and to areas on which the birds can live\r\nsafely and do no damage to crops, we are dependent upon wild aerial\r\nbirds to keep insect life in check on trees and high bushes and on land\r\nnot occupied by poultry.\r\n\r\n=Place of wild birds in civilization.= As no insect-eating aerial birds\r\nhave been domesticated, the preservation of wild birds that destroy\r\ninsects is of as much importance to man as the production of domestic\r\nbirds. Indeed, the wild birds are much more valuable to us in the wild\r\nstate than they would be if domesticated.\r\n\r\nIn nature species prey upon each other--the lowest forms of life upon\r\ninorganic and decayed matter, the higher forms upon the lower, the\r\nlarger creatures upon the smaller, the savage upon the defenseless.\r\nFertile lands not only produce luxuriant vegetation but teem with insect\r\nlife, which, if not kept in check, would soon destroy that vegetation.\r\nIn tropical and semitropical regions there are mammals, some of them\r\nquite large, which feed upon insects. In temperate regions where insects\r\nare not to be obtained during the winter, there would be no adequate\r\ncheck upon their increase and the consequent destruction of vegetation\r\nif it were not for the vast numbers of insect-eating migratory birds\r\nwhich come to these regions for the summer. Necessary as these birds are\r\nto vegetation on uncultivated lands, they are more necessary in\r\ncultivated fields, orchards, and gardens where the crops are more\r\nattractive to insects than the mixed vegetation on wild lands. As insect\r\ndestroyers the domestic birds that are kept on cultivated lands only\r\nfill the place of the nonmigratory wild birds that have been driven away\r\nor exterminated. So it is to the interest of every one to protect\r\ninsect-eating wild birds, for although these birds may do some damage to\r\ncrops, their service usually more than pays for it.\r\n\r\n=Classes of domestic birds.= There are three classes of domestic\r\nbirds--poultry, pigeons, and cage birds. The poultry class comprises\r\nland and water birds and contains nine kinds--fowls, ducks, geese,\r\nturkeys, guineas, peafowls, pheasants, swans, and ostriches. The pigeon\r\nclass has but one kind, the pigeon, which is the only aerial bird\r\ndomesticated for economic purposes. The cage-bird class has as its most\r\nimportant representative the canary. The other birds of this class have\r\nnever been popular in America.\r\n\r\nThe question of increasing the number of species of birds in\r\ndomestication interests many people. There is a general impression among\r\nthose not familiar with the commercial aspect of aviculture that many\r\nmore species might be domesticated. While it is true that many birds\r\ncapable of domestication have not been domesticated, there are few of\r\nthese that would serve any purpose not better served by some species\r\nalready domesticated. It will be shown as the different kinds and\r\nvarieties of domestic birds are discussed that the most useful kinds are\r\nalways the most popular, and that many others are kept principally as\r\nornaments. The number of ornamental creatures that can be kept in\r\ndomestication is limited, for as a rule animals, like people, must earn\r\ntheir living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS AND HABITS OF BIRDS RELATED TO USE\r\n\r\n\r\n=Feathers.= The feathers of a bird are the most highly developed form of\r\nprotective covering in animals, serving other important functions in\r\naddition to the primary one. Compared with the hair of a mammal or the\r\nscale of a fish or of a reptile, a typical soft feather from the body of\r\na bird is a very complex structure, partaking of the characters of both\r\nscales and hair. The fact that birds have scales and hair as well as\r\nfeathers shows their relation to these other forms of animal covering.\r\nThis is best observed on a fowl. The legs of a fowl are normally smooth,\r\nwith scales on the front of the shank and on the upper surfaces of the\r\ntoes. In feather-legged fowls the feathers appear first along the outer\r\nsides of the shanks and toes. As the number of feathers is increased\r\nthey grow longer and more feathers appear, until in the most heavily\r\nfeathered specimens the soft skin is covered and the scales are almost\r\nhidden.\r\n\r\nThe face of a fowl is normally almost bare, the skin being a bright red\r\nlike the comb and wattles; but at a distance of a few feet we can\r\nusually see some very small, fine feathers on it, and if we examine\r\nclosely we see in addition still finer growths--hairs. Among the body\r\nfeathers of a fowl, too, are quite long hairs. These are most easily\r\nobserved after a bird is plucked. They do not come out with the\r\nfeathers, and are removed by singeing.\r\n\r\n=Structure of feathers.= The smallest feather that to the naked eye\r\nappears as something more complex than a hair, looks like a little bunch\r\nof fuzzy filaments. This is called down.\r\n\r\nIn the next higher form of feather a small round quill appears with\r\nfilaments protruding from it like the hairs in an artist's brush. Such\r\na feather is called a stub feather, or simply a stub. The best place to\r\nfind these is on the outside of the shank of a fowl with scantily\r\nfeathered legs.\r\n\r\nThe first form of the complete feather is best observed either on the\r\nhead of a fowl or at the hock joint. The feathers in these places are\r\nvery small, yet complete. The round quill is lengthened into a shaft.\r\nExtending from each side of this shaft is a single row of filaments,\r\ncalled barbs, the edges of which, interlocked with little hooks, form\r\nthe web of the feather. On other parts of the body of the bird the\r\nfeathers are larger, but the general structure is always the same. The\r\nsize and special structure of the feather are always adjusted to suit\r\nthe part on which it grows or the service which it has to perform.\r\n\r\nAs the first function of the feathers is to keep the bird dry and warm,\r\nthe body feathers are all soft as compared with the large stiff feathers\r\nof the wings and tail; yet as we look at the feathers on different parts\r\nof the body of a bird we notice differences in their structure, and also\r\nnotice that the structure of a feather is not always the same throughout\r\nits length. On the exposed parts of the feathers of the neck, back,\r\nwings, and breast the web is perfect and the feathers overlap so closely\r\nthat they present a smooth surface. Under the surface, especially next\r\nthe skin, the barbs are not smoothly joined, but are fluffy. Thus the\r\nsame feathers which present a hard, smooth surface to the weather\r\nprovide a soft, warm garment next the skin. Under the wings and on the\r\nunderside of the body the feathers are quite fluffy throughout their\r\nwhole length.\r\n\r\n=Arrangement of the feathers.= As you look at a living bird the feathers\r\nappear to grow on all parts of the body. When the feathers are removed\r\nfrom the bird you see that while the skin is nearly all rough, with the\r\nlittle elevations where the feathers were removed, there are quite large\r\nareas where the skin is perfectly smooth, showing that no feathers grew\r\nthere. These places are bare because feathers on them would interfere\r\nwith the movements of the bird. The feathers on adjacent parts give the\r\nsmooth areas sufficient protection.\r\n\r\n=Decorative feather forms.= The natural decorative forms of plumage are\r\nfound mostly in male birds and consist of extraordinary developments of\r\nthe plumage of the neck and back, where the male birds of some species\r\nalways have feathers differing in form from the feathers on the same\r\nparts of the female. When a feather appendage not common to a species is\r\ndeveloped on some varieties, as the crest and beard on fowls and the\r\nruff on pigeons, both sexes have it. The most interesting feather\r\ndecorations will be described particularly in the chapters on the\r\nspecies on which they occur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. Brown Leghorn chick (one day old)]\r\n\r\n=Color in feathers.= While colors in the plumage are distributed very\r\ndifferently in different species of birds, often making combinations\r\npeculiar to a species, there is in all the same wonderful formation of\r\npatterns, that depends for its effect in a section upon some overlapping\r\nfeathers being marked alike and others having a different marking; and\r\nfor the effect in a single feather, upon adjacent barbs being now alike,\r\nnow different, in the distribution of the pigment in them. The best\r\ncommon example of a pattern covering a series of feathers is found on\r\nthe wing of a Mallard Duck or of a Rouen Duck. Interesting examples of\r\nthe formation of patterns on a single feather may be found in the\r\nplumage of barred, laced, and penciled fowls, and also in the lacings on\r\nthe body feathers of the females of the varieties of ducks mentioned.\r\nPerhaps the most interesting illustrations of this kind, however, are to\r\nbe seen on the plain feathers of the guinea and the gorgeous tail of the\r\npeacock.\r\n\r\nThe pigment which colors the plumage may be found in soluble form in\r\nthe quills of immature colored feathers. It is not conspicuous unless it\r\nis quite dark. In black fowls it is often so abundant that a part\r\nremains in the skin when the feathers are removed. After the pigment is\r\ndeposited in the web of the feather the color is fast. Water does not\r\naffect it, but it fades a little with age and exposure. New plumage\r\nusually contains a great deal of oil, a condition which is most\r\nconspicuous in white birds, to whose plumage the oil gives a creamy\r\ntint. In colored birds the presence of a large amount of oil in feathers\r\nis desirable because it gives greater brilliance to the plumage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. White Leghorn chicks (ten days old)]\r\n\r\n=Growth and molting of feathers.= The first covering of a young bird is\r\ndown. The young of birds which nest on the ground have the down covering\r\nwhen hatched; others acquire it in a few days. In small land birds which\r\nfeather quickly, as Leghorn and Hamburg chicks, the largest wing\r\nfeathers may have started to grow before the chick leaves the egg. In\r\nmost kinds of poultry, however, the young show no signs of feathers for\r\nsome days. The down is gradually replaced by small feathers, and these\r\nby larger feathers as the bird grows. As feathers in all stages of\r\ngrowth are found on the young bird at the same time, it is not known\r\nwhether all feathers are molted the same number of times. In cases where\r\nsome feathers were marked and watched, or where the colors changed with\r\nthe changing feathers, it appeared that after the down three sets of\r\nfeathers were grown in succession, the third and last making the adult\r\nplumage of the bird. This coat remains until the following summer or\r\nfall, when it is molted and replaced by a new one.\r\n\r\n=Flight.= The habit of flying is objectionable in domestic birds because\r\nit makes them more difficult to control. It has no direct use except in\r\npigeons kept for flying. There is, however, a very important connection\r\nbetween development for flying and the value of birds for the table. The\r\nmuscles of the wings furnish the greater part of the edible meat of most\r\nbirds. The most desirable birds for food purposes are those which have\r\nthe wing muscles well developed, yet not quite strong enough to enable\r\nthem to fly easily. In such birds the breast meat remains comparatively\r\nsoft through life, while in birds that fly well it becomes hard in a\r\nvery short time. That is why the breast meat of the pigeon is relatively\r\ntougher in an old bird than the breast meat of a fowl or turkey.\r\n\r\nThe balance between capacity for flight and neglect to use it, which is\r\ndesired in birds grown for the table, is secured by giving them\r\nopportunity to exercise their wings moderately but not for progressive\r\npractice in flying, which would soon enable them to fly easily over the\r\nfences used to confine them. To regulate such exercise the perches for\r\nbirds that roost are made low, or in an ascending series in which each\r\nperch after the first is reached from the one below it, while fences are\r\nmade so much higher than the distance the bird is accustomed to fly that\r\nthe failures of its first efforts to go over them discourage it. Ducks\r\nand geese, which do not roost, flap their wings a great deal, and if\r\nthey have room often exercise them by half running and half flying along\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n=Mechanism of the wing.= In its structure and in the muscular power that\r\nmoves it, the wing of a bird is a wonderful piece of mechanism. A bird\r\nin flying strikes the air with its wings so rapidly that the movements\r\ncannot be accurately counted. The heron, which is a slow-flying bird,\r\nmakes from one hundred twenty to one hundred fifty downward strokes of\r\nits wings a minute. As each downward stroke must be preceded by an\r\nupward stroke, this means that the wings make from two hundred forty to\r\nthree hundred separate movements a minute. In such swift-flying birds as\r\nthe pigeon the movements of the wings can be distinguished but cannot be\r\ncounted. The fastest movements of the wings are not made by the swiftest\r\nfliers. In order to fly at all some land birds with comparatively small\r\nwings have to move them so fast that the movements make a blur and a\r\nwhirring noise. The partridge is an illustration of a bird of this\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nIf the supporting surface of the wing of a bird were made of skin, like\r\nthe web of the foot of a swimming bird, it would be necessary to fold\r\nthe wing for each upward stroke. It is here that the structure of\r\nfeathers adapts itself to the rapid action required for movement in the\r\nair. The wing is not one surface but a series of narrow surfaces lapping\r\nin such a manner that they unite to form one broad surface when the\r\ndownward stroke is made, and with the upward stroke are separated so\r\nthat the air passes between them. Greater power in the downward stroke\r\nand less resistance in the upward stroke are also secured by the\r\ncurvature of the wing. The under side is concave, the upper side convex.\r\nThus in the downward stroke the wing gathers the air under it and so\r\nincreases the pressure, while in the upward stroke it scatters the air\r\nand reduces the pressure.\r\n\r\nIf the wing were equally rigid throughout, the movement of the bird\r\nwould be mostly upward. The bird in flying moves forward because the\r\nfront of the wing is rigid and the tips of the feathers, which are\r\ndirected backward, are flexible. So the air compressed by the wing in\r\nthe downward stroke escapes backward, and in doing so propels the bird\r\nforward. The principle is the same that is applied in the screw\r\npropeller of a boat or an airship, except that the wing vibrates while\r\nthe propeller revolves.\r\n\r\nThe most important function of the tail in flight is to balance the\r\nbird. It is of some assistance in steering, but a bird steers its course\r\nmostly by manipulation of the wings.\r\n\r\n=Scratching.= With the exception of the aquatic birds and the ostrich,\r\nall the species of poultry belong to the group called by naturalists\r\n_Rasores_ or _Scratchers_. Birds of this class have legs of moderate\r\nlength and very strong, with toes terminating in a stout claw. Normally\r\nthey have three toes upon which the foot rests when they are standing on\r\na flat surface, and a fourth toe, like a thumb, which assists the other\r\ntoes to grasp a perch. Some individual birds and some races of birds\r\nhave the fourth or hind toe double. The leg of a bird is so constructed\r\nthat when it is bent as the bird sits on a narrow support the toes\r\ncontract and grasp the support and hold it without any effort on the\r\npart of the bird. Thus the bird is as secure in its position on a limb\r\nwhen asleep as if wide awake and looking out for itself.\r\n\r\nIn proportion to their ability to scratch, birds are able to find seeds\r\nand insects concealed among dead or living vegetation on the surface of\r\nthe ground, and also to dig below the surface. Scratching capacity is\r\nmost highly developed in the fowl. Compared to it the other land birds\r\nare very feeble scratchers, and do little damage by scratching if free\r\nto roam about. For ages the scratching propensity of fowls was regarded\r\nas a vice in them, but since people began to give special attention to\r\npoultry they have learned that fowls are much more contented and thrifty\r\nin confinement if their food is given them in a litter of leaves, straw,\r\nor shavings, in which they must scratch for it, and have also found that\r\nto some extent fowls may be used to cultivate crops while destroying\r\ninsects and weeds among them.\r\n\r\n=Swimming.= Capacity for swimming has an economic value in domestic\r\nbirds because it adapts those possessing it to places which land birds\r\nrarely frequent. It will be shown when the different kinds of aquatic\r\nbirds are described that each has its special place and use in\r\ndomestication.\r\n\r\nThe swimming faculty in these birds is of further interest because of\r\nits relation to the development of the body plumage. If a land bird is\r\nplaced in the water, the feathers are quickly saturated, the water\r\npenetrating to the skin. A duck or other swimming bird will remain in\r\nthe water for hours without the water penetrating the feathers. This is\r\ncommonly supposed to be due to the presence of a large amount of oil in\r\nthe feathers, but the difference in the oiliness of the feathers of\r\nfowls and of ducks is not great enough to account for the difference in\r\nresistance to the penetration of water. The peculiar quality of the\r\nplumage of swimming birds is its density. If you take up a fowl and\r\nexamine the plumage you will find that it is easy to part the feathers\r\nso that the skin can be seen. It may be done with the fingers, or even\r\nby blowing gently among the feathers with the mouth. Now try to separate\r\nthe feathers of a duck so that the skin will be visible. You find it\r\nmuch harder, because the feathers are so thick and soft and at the same\r\ntime so elastic. The familiar phrase \"like water from a duck's back\" is\r\nnot especially appropriate. The feathers on the back of most birds are a\r\nvery effective protection against rain. The feathers all over a duck are\r\nsuch poor conductors of water that it is hard to remove them by\r\nscalding. The structure of the plumage of swimming birds adds to their\r\nbuoyancy in the water. They do not have to exert themselves to remain on\r\nthe surface, but float like cork.\r\n\r\n=Foods and mode of digestion.= All kinds of poultry and most of our\r\ncommon wild birds are omnivorous eaters, but the proportion of different\r\nfoods usually taken is not the same in different kinds of birds. Some\r\neat mostly grains, some mostly animal foods. Some can subsist entirely\r\non grass if they can get it in a tender state; others eat very little\r\ngrass. The scratching birds like a diet of about equal parts of grain,\r\nleaves, and insects. Pigeons and canaries live almost entirely on grains\r\nand seeds, but like a little green stuff occasionally.\r\n\r\nDomestic birds which produce many eggs require special supplies of food\r\ncontaining lime to make the shells. Until within a few years it was\r\nuniversally believed--and it is still commonly supposed--that birds\r\nneeded grit to take the place of the teeth nature did not give them, and\r\nassist in the grinding of the food in the gizzard. Many close observers\r\nnow reject this idea because they find that birds supplied with\r\ndigestible mineral foods do not eat those that are not digestible. A\r\nbird does not need teeth to grind its food, because it is softened in\r\nthe crop and the gastric juice acts upon it before the grinding process\r\nbegins.\r\n\r\n=Peculiarities of birds' eggs.= The only animal foodstuff produced in a\r\nnatural package, easily preserved and handled, is the egg. In the\r\nvegetable world we have a great many such things--fruits, seeds, roots,\r\nnuts, with coverings of various textures to protect the contents from\r\nthe air. In all of these the material stored up is either for the\r\nnourishment of the seeds in the first stages of growth as plants, or for\r\nthe nourishment of a new or special growth. An egg is the seed of an\r\nanimal. All animals produce eggs, but in mammals the new life\r\noriginating from the egg goes through the embryonic stages within the\r\nbody of the parent, while in insects, fishes, reptiles, and birds the\r\negg is laid by the creature producing it before the embryo begins to\r\ndevelop.\r\n\r\nIn mammals the embryo grows as a part of the body of the parent, the\r\nsubstances which build it up coming from the parent form as they are\r\nneeded. In birds a tiny germ--the true egg--is put, with all the\r\nmaterial needed for its development as an embryo, in a sealed package,\r\nwhich may be taken thousands of miles away from the parent, and, after\r\nlying dormant for weeks, may begin to grow as soon as the proper\r\nconditions of temperature are applied. The food value of the germ of an\r\negg is inappreciable. We use the egg to get the material stored up in it\r\nfor the young bird which would come from the germ.\r\n\r\n=Development of the egg.= The method of the formation of an egg is very\r\ninteresting. It is the same in all birds, but is most conveniently\r\nstudied in fowls. If a laying hen is killed and the body is opened so\r\nthat the internal organs can all be seen, one of the most conspicuous of\r\nthese is a large, convoluted duct having its outlet at the vent. In this\r\nduct, which is called the oviduct, are eggs in various stages of\r\nformation. At its upper extremity, attached to the backbone, is a bunch\r\nof globular yellow substances which are at once identified as yolks of\r\neggs in all sizes. The organ to which these are attached is the ovary.\r\nThe smallest yolks are so small that they cannot be seen without a\r\npowerful microscope. These yolks are not germs, but as they grow the\r\ngerm forms on one side of each yolk, where it appears as a small white\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nWhen a yolk is full-grown it drops into the funnel-shaped mouth of the\r\noviduct. Here it is inclosed in a membranous covering, called the\r\nchalazae, and receives a coating of thick albumen. The function of the\r\nchalazae is to keep the yolk suspended in the center of the egg. It does\r\nnot merely inclose the yolk, but, twisted into cords, extends from\r\neither end and is attached to the outer membrane at the end of the egg.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the funnel the egg passes into a narrow part of the\r\noviduct, called the isthmus, where it receives the membranous coverings\r\nwhich are found just inside the shell. From the isthmus it goes into the\r\nlowest part of the oviduct--the uterus. Here the shell is formed, and at\r\nthe same time a thin albumen enters through the pores of the shell and\r\nthe shell membranes and dilutes the thick albumen first deposited. After\r\nthis process is completed the egg may be retained in the oviduct for\r\nsome time. It is, however, usually laid within a few hours.\r\n\r\n=Rate and amount of egg production.= In the wild state a bird, if not\r\nmolested after it begins laying, produces a number of eggs varying in\r\ndifferent kinds, according to the number of young that can be cared for,\r\nand then incubates them. If its first eggs are removed or destroyed,\r\nthe bird lays more, usually changing the location of its nest. In\r\ndomestication the eggs of most kinds of birds are removed from the nests\r\ndaily as laid, and the birds lay many more eggs before they stop to\r\nincubate than they do in the wild state.\r\n\r\nIt is, and has been for ages, the common opinion that the wild birds and\r\npoultry, when first domesticated, were capable of laying only a small\r\nnumber of eggs each season, and that laying capacity has been enormously\r\nincreased in domestication; but the oldest reports that we have of the\r\namount of egg production indicate that the laying capacity of fowls was\r\nas great centuries ago as it is at the present time. Recent observations\r\non wild birds in captivity show that even birds which pair and usually\r\nlay only a few eggs each season have a laying capacity at least equal to\r\nthe ordinary production of hens. Quails in captivity have been known to\r\nlay about one hundred eggs in a season, and an English sparrow from\r\nwhich the eggs were taken as laid produced over sixty.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional capacity to produce ovules is now known to be far\r\ngreater than the power of any bird to supply the material for the\r\nnourishment of germs through the embryonic stage. The principal factors\r\nin large egg production are abundance of food and great capacity for\r\ndigesting and assimilating it.\r\n\r\n=Incubation.= A bird before beginning to lay makes a nest. Some birds\r\nbuild very elaborate and curious nests; others merely put together a few\r\nsticks, or hollow out a little place on the ground. In birds that pair,\r\nthe male and female work together to build the nest. Even in polygamous\r\ndomestic birds like the fowl and the duck, a male will often make a nest\r\nfor the females of his family and coax them to it as a cock pigeon does\r\nhis mate.\r\n\r\nIf the birds are left to themselves and the eggs are not molested, an\r\naerial bird will usually lay a number of eggs equal to the number of\r\nyoung the parents can feed as long as they require this attention, while\r\na terrestrial or aquatic bird will usually lay as many eggs as she can\r\ncover. The desired number of eggs having been laid, the process of\r\nincubation by the parents begins.\r\n\r\nThe incubation of their eggs by birds is one of the most remarkable\r\nthings in nature. We say that \"instinct\" leads birds to build their\r\nnests and to keep their eggs warm for a period varying from two weeks\r\nfor small birds, to six weeks for the ostrich; but \"instinct\" is only a\r\nterm to describe the apparently intelligent actions of the lower\r\nanimals, which we say have not intelligence enough to know the reasons\r\nfor the things that they do.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. Sitting hen]\r\n\r\nThe mother of a young mammal knows that it came from herself, and she\r\ncan see that it is like her and others of her kind. It at once seeks her\r\ncare and responds to her attentions. The egg which a bird lays is as\r\nlifeless--to all appearances--as the stones which it often so closely\r\nresembles. Only after many days or weeks of tiresomely close attention\r\ndoes it produce a creature which can respond to the care lavished upon\r\nit. The birds incubating eggs not only give them the most unremitting\r\nattention, but those that fill their nests with eggs before beginning to\r\nincubate methodically turn the eggs and change their position in the\r\nnest, this being necessary because otherwise the eggs at the center of\r\nthe nest would get too much heat and those at the outside would not get\r\nenough. A bird appears to know that if she begins to sit before she has\r\nfinished laying, some of the eggs would be spoiled or would hatch before\r\nthe others; and, as noted above, aerial birds seem to know better than\r\nto hatch more young than they can rear. But no bird seems to have any\r\nidea of the time required to hatch its eggs, or to notice the lapse of\r\ntime, or to care whether the eggs upon which it sits are of its own\r\nkind or of some other kind, or to know whether the young when hatched\r\nare like or unlike itself. If eggs fail to hatch, domestic birds will,\r\nas a rule, remain on the nest until the eggs are taken away or until\r\nsheer exhaustion compels them to abandon the hopeless task. In\r\ndomestication, however, those birds which continue laying most freely\r\nwhen their eggs are removed as laid, tend to lose the habit of\r\nincubation. Turkeys and geese will often begin to incubate after having\r\nlaid about the number of eggs that they could cover. Many fowls will do\r\nthe same, but most fowls lay for several months before attempting to\r\nincubate, and in many races not more than two or three per cent of the\r\nhens ever incubate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. Fresh egg[1]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. Infertile egg (after twenty-four hours'\r\nincubation)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. Fertile egg (after twenty-four hours'\r\nincubation)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. Embryo (after seventy-two hours' incubation)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. Embryo (after seven days' incubation)]\r\n\r\n[1] Photographs (Figs. 4-8) from Bureau of Animal Industry, United\r\nStates Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. Chick ready to break shell]\r\n\r\n=Development of the embryo in a bird's egg.= The condition required to\r\nproduce a live bird from a fertile egg is the continuous application of\r\na temperature of about 102 or 103 degrees Fahrenheit from the time the\r\nheat is first applied until the embryo is fully developed and ready to\r\nemerge from the shell. In nature the heat is applied by contact with the\r\nbodies of the parent birds. Development of life will start in an egg at\r\nabout 10 degrees below the temperature required to maintain it, but at\r\nthis temperature the germ soon dies. The temperature in incubation may\r\noccasionally go higher than 103 degrees or may be as low as 70 degrees\r\nfor a short time without injury to the germ. Some germs will stand\r\ngreater extremes of temperature than others, just as some living\r\ncreatures will.\r\n\r\nThe first stages of the development of life in the egg of a bird may be\r\nobserved by holding the eggs before a strong light in a darkened room.\r\nWhite-shelled eggs are the best for this purpose. In about thirty-six\r\nhours from the beginning of incubation it will be found that the germ\r\nhas turned red, and little red veins radiate from it somewhat like the\r\nlegs of a spider. For several days the egg is quite translucent and the\r\nyolk shows plainly. As the germ grows, the contents of the egg become\r\nclouded and dense, and the air space at the large end of the egg is\r\nclearly defined, the density being greatest near it. From the time that\r\nthe egg becomes dense, observations of development must be made by\r\nbreaking one or more eggs daily or every few days, according to the\r\nnumber available for observation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10. Egg before exclusion and partially excluded\r\nchick]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11. Light Brahma (day old)]\r\n\r\nThe embryo grows until it fills the egg. The mere application of heat to\r\nthe egg has gradually transformed that little germ and the yellow and\r\nwhite of egg into bones, flesh, skin (and, in some cases, down), and all\r\nthe organs of a living creature. When the embryo has filled the shell,\r\nit lies curled up, usually with the head at the large end of the egg and\r\nthe beak almost touching the shell, at about one third of the distance\r\nfrom the large to the small end of the egg. At the point of the beak of\r\nthe young bird on the curved tip of the upper mandible is a small horny\r\nscale. Without this scale it would be hard for the embryo to break the\r\nshell because it cannot, as it lies, strike it a direct blow with the\r\npoint of its beak. This scale is a remarkable character. Its only use is\r\nto help the bird out of the shell. A few days after exclusion it\r\ndisappears.\r\n\r\nIf you take a hen's egg about the eighteenth or the nineteenth day of\r\nincubation and hold it closely in your hand, you may be able to feel the\r\nchick move. If your hand is a little bit cold, the chick is much more\r\nlikely to squirm in the egg and may utter a peep. If, with the egg in a\r\nwarm hand, you hold it to your ear, you will about this time hear an\r\noccasional tap, tap, caused by the chicken striking its beak against the\r\nshell. The tapping is kept up more or less steadily until the shell\r\ncracks where the point of the beak strikes it and a little piece is\r\nbroken out. The chick usually rests awhile now,--perhaps for some\r\nhours,--then resumes the attack on the shell. It turns in the shell,\r\nbreaking out little pieces as it turns, until there is a crack nearly\r\nall the way around, when, by pushing with its head and feet, it forces\r\nthe shell apart and sprawls out of it.\r\n\r\nThe process is the same for all birds, except that those that take\r\nlongest to develop in the shell take a longer rest after first breaking\r\nit. The young of aerial birds, which are naked when hatched, are ugly\r\nlittle things. Young poultry, too, are almost repulsive with their\r\nsprawling forms and the wet down plastered to the skin, but in a few\r\nhours they grow strong, the down dries and becomes fluffy, the bright\r\nlittle eyes seem to take in everything, and they are the most attractive\r\nof all baby animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nSPECIES AND THEIR DIVISIONS IN DOMESTIC BIRDS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three general classes of domestic birds include few species but many\r\nvarieties, and, outside of the distinct varieties, an indefinite number\r\nof individual types. Where varieties are as numerous as in the fowl,\r\nwhich has about three hundred, and the pigeon, which has a much greater\r\nnumber, the differences between them are often very slight. Sometimes\r\nthe form of a single small character is the only distinguishing feature.\r\nBut, if this is a fixed character, the variety is distinct. Where there\r\nare so many varieties it is hard to make short, appropriate descriptive\r\nnames for all, if considered simply as varieties. For such diversity\r\nthere must be a more extended classification. Such a classification,\r\ngrowing gradually with the increase in the number of varieties, will not\r\nbe consistent throughout. Hence to understand clearly the relations of\r\nthe artificial divisions of species in domestication we must know what a\r\nspecies is and how these divisions arise.\r\n\r\n=Definition of species.= Species are the natural divisions of living\r\nthings. Each plant and animal species retains its distinctive character\r\nthrough long ages because the individuals composing it can produce\r\nperfect offspring only (if asexual) of themselves, or (if bisexual) with\r\nothers of their species.\r\n\r\nThe self-isolation of species is well illustrated when similar plants\r\ngrow together, as grasses in the same field and practically on the same\r\nspot; yet year after year all the old kinds are found and no new ones\r\nsuch as might come from a mixture of two kinds, if they would mix. In\r\nthe higher animals, where the parent forms are of different sexes, they\r\nchoose mates of their own kind, and so each species remains distinct;\r\nbut if in a species there are many different types, such as we find in\r\ndomestic fowls, the members of the species, when free to do so, mate as\r\nreadily with types quite different from their own as with individuals\r\nexactly like them, and produce offspring of intermediate types with all\r\nthe essential characters of the species. In domestication individuals of\r\ndistinct yet similar species are sometimes mated and produce offspring\r\ncalled hybrids, but these are sterile. The mule, which is a hybrid\r\nbetween the ass and the mare, is the most familiar animal of this kind.\r\nHybrid, or mule, cage birds are produced by crossing the canary with\r\nseveral allied species. Among other domestic birds hybrids are almost\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\n=Origin of species.= Until near the close of the last century it was\r\ncommonly believed that each species had been created in perfect form and\r\nthat species were unchangeable; but long before that time some keen\r\nstudents of the natural sciences and close observers of the changes that\r\ntake place in plants and animals in domestication had discovered that\r\nspecies were not perfectly stable and were changing slowly. Geologists\r\nestablished the fact that the earth, instead of being only a few\r\nthousand years old, had existed for countless centuries. Among fossil\r\nremains of creatures unlike any now known they had found also other\r\nforms which appeared to be prototypes of existing species. The idea that\r\nthe forms of life now on the earth had come from earlier and somewhat\r\ndifferent forms had occurred to several scientists more than a hundred\r\nyears ago, but it was not until about 1860 that a satisfactory\r\nexplanation of progressive development of forms of life was given to the\r\nworld. This mode of creation is called evolution.\r\n\r\nThe theory of evolution is that partly through their own inherent\r\ntendency to vary and partly through the influence of external things\r\nwhich affect them, all organisms change slowly; that things of the same\r\nkind, separated and living under different conditions, may in time so\r\nchange that they become separate species; and that this process may be\r\nrepeated indefinitely, the number of species constantly increasing and\r\nbecoming more diversified and more highly developed.\r\n\r\nSuch a theory would not be entitled to serious consideration unless it\r\nwas known that the earth was millions of years old, because we know that\r\nraces of fowls separated for over three thousand years (and perhaps\r\ntwice as long) and developed into quite different varieties will breed\r\ntogether as readily as those of the same variety. But when it is certain\r\nthat the earth is so old that there has been ample time for changes in\r\nliving forms that would require periods of time beyond our\r\ncomprehension, some of the relations of varieties and species of birds\r\nhave an important bearing on the theory of evolution.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of fowls just noted, we find that domestic ducks of the\r\nsame species, after a separation of several thousand years, breed freely\r\ntogether. But our domestic ducks are not, like the fowls, all of the\r\nsame species, and if individuals of different species are paired they\r\nproduce only a few weak hybrids. Our domestic geese are probably\r\ndescended from two wild varieties, but races that were not brought\r\ntogether for thousands of years after they were domesticated are\r\nperfectly fertile together, while when mated with the American Wild\r\nGoose, which is not domesticated but will breed in captivity, they\r\nproduce only hybrids. The general resemblance between geese and ducks is\r\nvery striking, yet they will not breed together at all.\r\n\r\nA comparison of these facts indicates that while three thousand, or even\r\nfive or six thousand, years of separation may not be enough to break\r\ndown the natural affinity of varieties of the same species, separation\r\nand difference of development will eventually make of varieties distinct\r\nspecies, a union of which will produce only hybrids, while a longer\r\nseparation and further increase of differences makes the break between\r\nthe species absolute and they will not breed together at all.\r\n\r\n=Natural varieties.= A species having developed as a variety of an\r\nearlier species will continue to develop as one variety or as several\r\nvarieties, according to conditions. If a part of a species becomes so\r\nseparated from the rest that intercourse ceases, each division of the\r\nspecies may become a well-defined variety.\r\n\r\n=Varieties in domestication.= How a species when domesticated breaks up\r\ninto varieties is well illustrated by the case of the fowl. The original\r\nwild species has long disappeared, but there is good reason to suppose\r\nthat in size and color it was something between a Brown Pit Game and a\r\nBrown Leghorn. The birds were smaller than most fowls seen in this\r\ncountry to-day. The prevailing color was a dull brown, because that\r\ncolor best conceals a small land bird from its enemies. Fowls that were\r\ndomesticated and given good care and an abundance of food would usually\r\ngrow larger than the wild stock. Thus if any person, or the people\r\ngenerally in any community, systematically gave their fowls good care, a\r\nvariety of unusual size would be developed.\r\n\r\nDifferent colors would also appear in the flocks of fowls, because the\r\nbirds of unusual colors would be protected and preserved, instead of\r\nbeing destroyed as they usually are in the wild state. Other\r\npeculiarities, too, such as large combs, crests, and feathered legs,\r\nwould be developed in some lands and neglected in others. This is how it\r\nhappened that after thousands of years in domestication the races of\r\nfowls in different parts of the world were quite different in size and\r\nform, but alike in being of many colors.\r\n\r\nFrom a species in this condition modern poultry breeders have made\r\nhundreds of distinct varieties. The easiest method of making a variety\r\nin domestication is to select specimens for breeding as near the desired\r\ntype as possible, and to breed only from a few individuals in each\r\ngeneration which come nearest to the ideal type. In this way a variety\r\nthat breeds quite true to the type may be established in from three or\r\nfour to eight or ten years, according to the number of characters to be\r\nestablished as distinctive of the variety. Varieties are also made by\r\ncrossing unlike individuals. This process is longer than the other, and\r\nsometimes requires a series of crosses to produce specimens\r\napproximating the ideal sought. After such specimens have been obtained\r\nthe method is the same as in the first case. A variety is commonly\r\nconsidered to be well established when the greater part of the specimens\r\nproduced are easily identified as of that variety. But no domestic\r\nvariety is ever established in the sense that a species is. All are\r\nartificial, produced by compulsory separation and preserved only as long\r\nas it is continued.\r\n\r\n=Classification of domestic varieties of birds.= Domestic varieties of\r\nall kinds of live stock were at first mostly shape-varieties; that is,\r\nthe individuals of a variety were alike in shape but of various colors.\r\nThis is the case still with some varieties. These shape-varieties are\r\nmostly the common types of certain countries or districts. Thus the\r\nLeghorn fowl is the common fowl of Italy, and the Houdan is a type\r\ncommon in a small district in France. Such shape-varieties are called\r\n_breeds_. When other types were made by crossing such breeds they also\r\nwere called breeds.\r\n\r\nWhen people first began to be interested in the improvement of live\r\nstock, the popular idea of a breed was that it was a domestic species,\r\nand there are still many people who hold this view. This popular\r\nmisconception of the nature of a breed is responsible for much of the\r\ninconsistency and confusion in the ordinary classifications of domestic\r\nvarieties. To it also is due the use of the term \"variety\" to apply\r\nespecially to color-varieties, which are the principal divisions of\r\nbreeds.\r\n\r\nIn the classification of domestic birds a _variety_ is properly a\r\ncolor-variety of a breed. Thus in the Plymouth Rock breed there are six\r\ncolor-varieties--barred, white, buff, partridge, silver-penciled, and\r\nermine (called Columbian); and in Fantail Pigeons there are six\r\ncolor-varieties--white, blue, black, red, yellow, and silver. Birds of\r\nthe same breed (shape) and the same variety (color) may differ in some\r\nother character, as the form of the comb or the presence or absence of\r\nfeathers in certain places. In accordance with such differences\r\nvarieties are divided into _subvarieties_. Thus, in Leghorn Fowls the\r\nbrown, white, and buff varieties have single-combed and rose-combed\r\nsubvarieties.\r\n\r\nIn any breed, variety, or subvariety certain families are sometimes\r\ndistinguished for general or special excellence of form or color. Such a\r\nfamily is called a _strain_.\r\n\r\n=Systematic mixtures of breeds and varieties.= Although so many distinct\r\nvarieties have been developed from common domestic stocks, the improved\r\nraces do not always displace the mongrels. When the old mongrels\r\ndisappear their place is often taken by a new mongrel stock produced by\r\nmixtures of the distinct breeds with each other and with the old mongrel\r\nrace. The greater part of such stock is so mixed that its relation to\r\nany established breed could not be determined or expressed, but\r\nsystematic mixtures are sometimes made, and to describe these the\r\nfollowing terms are used: _Crossbred_--having parents of different,\r\ndistinct breeds, varieties, or subvarieties. A Leghorn male mated with a\r\nCochin female produces offspring each of which is in blood one half\r\nLeghorn and one half Cochin. _Grade_--having more than half of the blood\r\nof a breed.\r\n\r\nIf the offspring of a cross such as is described in the preceding\r\nparagraph are mated with birds of one of the parent breeds, the\r\noffspring of this mating will have three fourths of the blood of that\r\nbreed. If these in turn are mated to birds of the same pure breed, the\r\noffspring will have seven eighths of the blood of that breed. Animals\r\nbred in this way are called _grades_ until the process has been carried\r\nso far that they are practically pure-bred. Mongrel stock is often\r\ngraded up in this way. As a rule stock that is seven eighths pure is not\r\ndistinguishable from average pure stock of the same breed.\r\n\r\n=Pure-bred, thoroughbred, and standard-bred.= A _pure-bred_ animal is,\r\nstrictly speaking, one having the blood only of the variety to which it\r\nbelongs. From what has been said of the making of breeds and varieties\r\nit is plain that absolute purity of blood is not a universal attribute\r\nof well-bred domestic birds. A _thoroughbred_ animal is one that is\r\nthoroughly bred for some purpose or to some type. A _standard-bred_\r\nanimal is one that is bred especially to conform to requirements agreed\r\nupon by breeders and exhibitors.\r\n\r\nA great deal of misapprehension and confusion in the use of these terms\r\nhas been caused by the attitude of those who maintain that the term\r\n\"thoroughbred,\" having been used as a name for highly bred running\r\nhorses, cannot properly apply to any other kind of live stock, and that\r\n\"pure-bred\" should apply to all thoroughly bred races. The noun\r\n\"Thoroughbred\" is the name of a breed of horses. The adjective\r\n\"thoroughbred\" is common property. Writers on aviculture who wish to be\r\naccurate prefer it in many instances to \"pure-bred\" because absolute\r\npurity of blood is rare and is not of the importance in breeding that\r\nnovices usually suppose. Not only are many new varieties made by\r\ncrossing, but in long-established breeds outcrosses are regularly made\r\nto restore or intensify characters.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the use of the three terms in application to a single\r\nbreed: A stock of Light Brahmas might be kept pure for half a century,\r\nyet at the end of that period might have changed its type entirely. It\r\nmight be so deteriorated that it was worth less than common mongrels;\r\nyet it is pure-bred stock. Another stock of the same variety might be\r\nbred for table qualities, egg-production, and the same principal\r\ncolor-characteristics of the variety, but without attention to the fine\r\npoints of fancy breeding. Such a stock is thoroughbred but not\r\nstandard-bred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nFOWLS\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12. Pet fowls--White Wyandottes and Game Bantams.\r\n(Photograph from Dr. J. C. Paige, Amherst, Massachusetts)]\r\n\r\nThe most useful of all birds is the common fowl, seen on almost every\r\nfarm and in the back yards of many city and village homes. The fowl\r\ntakes to the conditions of domestic life better than any other land\r\nbird. It is more cleanly in its habits, more productive, more\r\nintelligent, and more interesting than the duck, which ranks next in\r\nusefulness. Fowls supply nearly all the eggs and the greater part of the\r\npoultry meat that we use. Their feathers are of less value than those of\r\nducks, geese, and turkeys. In the days when feather beds were common\r\nthey were made usually of the body feathers of fowls. Now the feathers\r\nof fowls are used mostly for the cheaper grades of pillows and cushions,\r\nand in the making of feather boas and like articles. The wing and tail\r\nfeathers have been much used for decorating ladies' hats, and since the\r\nuse of small wild birds in millinery decorations has been prohibited,\r\nthe hackle feathers of cocks are quite extensively used in trimming\r\nhats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13. Single-combed Rhode Island Red male[2]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14. Rose-combed Rhode Island Red female[2]]\r\n\r\n[2] Photograph from Lester Tompkins, Concord, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n=Description.= Ordinary fowls are rather small land birds. The males at\r\nmaturity weigh from four to five pounds each, and the females about a\r\npound less. They are plump, rugged, and very active. If treated well\r\nthey are bold, and with a little attention can easily be made very tame.\r\nIf neglected and abused, they become shy and wild. The most striking\r\npeculiarities of the fowl are the fleshy comb and wattles which ornament\r\nthe head, and the full tail which is usually carried well up and spread\r\nperpendicularly. The head appendages vary much in size and form. They\r\nare sometimes very small, but never entirely wanting. The carriage of\r\nthe tail also varies, but except in a few breeds bred especially for low\r\ntails it is noticeably high as compared with that of other poultry.\r\nFowls are readily distinguished from other birds by the voice. The male\r\ncrows, the female cackles. These are their most common calls, but there\r\nare other notes--some common to both sexes, some peculiar to one--which\r\nare the same in all races of fowls. An abrupt, harsh croak warns the\r\nflock that one of their number has discerned a hawk or noticed something\r\nsuspicious in the air. A slowly repeated cluck keeps the young brood\r\nadvised of the location of their mother. If she finds a choice morsel of\r\nfood, a rapid clicking sound calls them about her. When she settles down\r\nto brood them she calls them with a peculiar crooning note. The male\r\nalso cackles when alarmed, and when he finds food calls his mates in the\r\nsame way that the female calls her young under the same circumstances.\r\nOther poultry and sometimes even cats and dogs learn this call and\r\nrespond to it. If the food discovered is something that a stronger\r\nanimal wants, the bird making the call may lose it because of his\r\neagerness to share the treasure with the members of his family.\r\n\r\nIn adult fowls the male and female are readily distinguished by\r\ndifferences in appearance as well as by the voice. The comb and wattles\r\nof the male are larger, and after he has completed his growth are always\r\nof the same size and a bright red in color. In the female the comb is\r\nmuch smaller than that of a male of the same family, and both size and\r\ncolor vary periodically, the comb and wattles being larger and the whole\r\nhead brighter in color when the female is laying. The tail of the male\r\nis also much larger than that of the female and has long plumelike\r\ncoverts. The feathers of his back and neck are long, narrow, and\r\nflowing, and in many varieties are much brighter in color than the\r\ncorresponding feathers on the female. The male has a short, sharp spur\r\non the inside of each leg, a little above the hind toe. Occasionally a\r\nfemale has spurs, but they are usually very small. With so many\r\ndifferences between male and female the sex of an adult fowl is apparent\r\nat a glance. In the young of breeds which have large combs the males\r\nbegin to grow combs when quite small, and so the sex may be known when\r\nthey are only a few weeks old. In other breeds the sex may not be\r\ndistinguished with certainty until the birds are several months old, or,\r\nin some cases, until they are nearly full-grown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15. White Polish male (crowing) and female.\r\n(Photograph from Leontine Lincoln Jr., Fall River, Massachusetts)]\r\n\r\nThe adult male fowl is called a _cock_, and also, in popular phrase, a\r\n_rooster_. The adult female fowl is called a _hen_. The word \"hen\" is\r\nthe feminine form of _hana_, the Anglo-Saxon name for the cock. It is\r\nlikely that the name \"cock,\" which it is plain was taken from the first\r\nsyllable of the crow of the bird, was gradually substituted for _hana_\r\nbecause it is shorter. _Hana_ means \"the singer.\" A young fowl is called\r\na _chicken_ until the sex can be distinguished. After that poultry\r\nfanciers call the young male a _cockerel_ and the young female a\r\n_pullet_. The word \"pullet\" is also used by others, but the popular\r\nnames for a cockerel are _crower_ and _young rooster_. The word\r\n\"cockerel,\" as is seen at a glance, is the diminutive of \"cock.\" The\r\nword \"pullet,\" sometimes spelled _poulet_, is a diminutive from the\r\nFrench _poule_, \"a hen.\"\r\n\r\n=Origin of the fowl.= Of the origin of the fowl we have no direct\r\nknowledge. It was fully domesticated long before the beginnings of\r\nhistory. There is no true wild race of fowls known. For a long time it\r\nwas commonly held that the _Gallus Bankiva_, found in the jungles of\r\nIndia, was the ancestor of all the races of the domestic fowl, but this\r\nview was not accepted by some of the most careful investigators, and the\r\nmost recent inquiries into the subject indicate that the so-called\r\n_Gallus Bankiva_ is not a native wild species but a feral race, that is,\r\na race developed in the wild from individuals escaped from\r\ndomestication.\r\n\r\n=Appearance of the original wild species.= The likeness of the fowls\r\nshown in ancient drawings to the ordinary unimproved stock in many parts\r\nof the world to-day shows that--except as by special breeding men have\r\ndeveloped distinct races--fowls have not changed since the most remote\r\ntimes of which records exist. From the constancy of this type through\r\nthis long period it is reasonably inferred that no marked change in the\r\nsize and shape of the fowl had occurred in domestication in prehistoric\r\ntimes, and therefore that the original wild fowl very closely resembled\r\nfowls which may be seen wherever the influence of improved races has not\r\nchanged the ordinary type. The particular point in which the wild\r\nspecies differed from a flock of ordinary domestic fowls was color.\r\nDomestic fowls, unless carefully bred for one color type, are usually of\r\nmany colors. In the wild species, as a rule, only one color would be\r\nfound, and that would be brown, which is the prevailing color among\r\nsmall land birds.\r\n\r\n=Distribution of fowls in ancient times.= From drawings and\r\ndescriptions on ancient tablets and from figures on old coins it appears\r\nthat the fowl was familiar to the Babylonians seven thousand years ago,\r\nand that it was introduced into Egypt about 4600 B.C. Chinese tradition\r\ngives 1400 B.C. as the approximate date of the introduction of poultry\r\ninto China from the West. At the time of the founding of Rome the fowl\r\nwas well known throughout Northern Africa, and in the Mediterranean\r\ncountries of Europe as far west as Italy and Sicily. It was also known\r\nin Japan at this time. Whether it was known in India is uncertain; if\r\nnot, it was brought there soon after. It is supposed that immediately\r\nfollowing their conquests in Central and Western Europe the Romans\r\nintroduced their poultry into those regions. Thus, at about the\r\nbeginning of the Christian Era, the fowl was known to all the civilized\r\npeoples of the Old World and had been introduced to the less civilized\r\nraces of Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16. Light Brahma cockerel]\r\n\r\n=Development of principal races of fowls.= There is no evidence that any\r\nof the ancient civilized peoples made any effort to improve the fowl,\r\nnor have any improved races been produced in the lands where those\r\ncivilizations flourished. Outside of this area many different types were\r\ngradually developed to suit the needs or the tastes of people in\r\ndifferent countries and localities. Thus in the course of centuries were\r\nproduced from the same original wild stock fowls as unlike as the\r\nmassive Brahma, with feathered legs and feet, and the diminutive Game\r\nBantam; the Leghorn, with its large comb, and the Polish, with only the\r\nrudiments of a comb and in its place a great ball of feathers; the\r\nSpanish, with monstrous development of the skin of the face, and the\r\nSilky, with dark skin and hairlike plumage. Except in a few limited\r\ndistricts these special types did not displace the ordinary type for\r\nmany centuries. Until modern times they were hardly known outside of the\r\ndistricts or the countries where they originated. Of the details of\r\ntheir origin nothing is known. They were not of the highly specialized\r\nand finished types such as are bred by fanciers now. Their distinctive\r\nfeatures had been established, but in comparatively crude form. The\r\nrefining and perfecting of all these types has been the work of fanciers\r\nin Holland, Belgium, England, and America in modern times. These\r\nfanciers have also developed new races of more serviceable types.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17. Light Brahma hen]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18. Red Pile Game Bantam cock]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19. Red Pile Game Bantam hen]\r\n\r\n=How fowls were kept in old times.= Less than a century ago it was\r\nquite a common practice among the cottagers of England and Scotland to\r\nkeep their fowls in their cottages at night. Sometimes a loft, to which\r\nthe birds had access by a ladder outside, was fitted up for them.\r\nSometimes perches for the fowls were put in the living room of the\r\ncottage. Such practices seem to us wrong from a sanitary standpoint, but\r\nit is only within very recent times that people have given careful\r\nattention to sanitation, and in old times, when petty thieving was more\r\ncommon than it is now, there was a decided advantage in having such\r\nsmall domestic animals as poultry and pigs where they could not be\r\ndisturbed without the owner's knowing it. The practice of keeping fowls\r\nin the owner's dwelling seems to have been confined to the poorer\r\npeople, who had no large domestic animals for which they must provide\r\nsuitable outbuildings. On large farms special houses were sometimes\r\nprovided for poultry, but they were probably oftener housed with other\r\nanimals, for few people thought it worth while to give them special\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20. White-Faced Black Spanish cockerel. (Photograph\r\nfrom R. A. Rowan, Los Angeles, California)]\r\n\r\nThroughout all times and in all lands the common domestic birds have\r\nusually been the special charge of the women and children of a\r\nhousehold. In some countries long-established custom makes the poultry\r\nthe personal property of the wife. A traveler in Nubia about seventy\r\nyears ago states that there the henhouse, as well as the hens, belonged\r\nto the wife, and if a man divorced his wife, as the custom permitted,\r\nshe took all away with her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21. Silver-Spangled Polish cock and hen. (Photograph\r\nfrom Leontine Lincoln Jr., Fall River, Massachusetts)]\r\n\r\nThe flocks of fowls were usually small in old times. It was only in\r\nareas adjacent to large cities that a surplus of poultry or eggs could\r\nbe disposed of profitably, and as the fowls were almost always allowed\r\nthe run of the dooryard, the barnyard, and the outbuildings, the number\r\nthat could be tolerated, even on a large farm, was limited. As a rule\r\nthe fowls were expected to get their living as they could, but in this\r\nthey were not so much worse off than other live stock, or than their\r\nowners. But, while this was the ordinary state of the family flock of\r\nfowls, there were frequent exceptions. The housewife who is thrifty\r\nalways manages affairs about the house better than the majority of her\r\nneighbors, and in older poultry literature there are occasional\r\nstatements of the methods of those who were most successful with their\r\nfowls, which we may well suppose were methods that had been used for\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22. Black Langshan cock. (Photograph from Urban\r\nFarms, Buffalo, New York)]\r\n\r\n=Modern conditions and methods.= About a hundred years ago people in\r\nEngland and America began to give more attention to poultry keeping, and\r\nto study how to make poultry (especially fowls) more profitable. This\r\ninterest in poultry arose partly because of the increasing interest in\r\nagricultural matters and partly because eggs and poultry were becoming\r\nmore important articles of food. Those who studied the situation found\r\nthat there were two ways of making poultry more profitable. One way,\r\nwhich was open to all, was to give the birds better care; the other was\r\nto replace the ordinary fowls with fowls of an improved breed. So those\r\nwho were much interested began to follow the practices of the most\r\nsuccessful poultry keepers that they knew, and to introduce new breeds,\r\nand gradually great changes were made in the methods of producing\r\npoultry and in the types of fowls that were kept in places where the\r\ninterest in poultry was marked.\r\n\r\nNearly all farmers now keep quite large flocks of fowls. Many farmers\r\nmake the most of their living from poultry, and in some places nearly\r\nevery farm is devoted primarily to the production of eggs and of poultry\r\nfor the table. Fowls receive most attention, although, as we shall see,\r\nsome of the largest and most profitable farms are engaged in producing\r\nducks. In the suburbs of cities and in villages all over the land many\r\npeople keep more fowls now than the average farmer did in old times.\r\nThese city poultry keepers often give a great deal of time to their\r\nfowls and still either lose money on them or make very small wages for\r\nthe time given to this work, because they try to keep too many in a\r\nsmall space, or to keep more than they have time to care for properly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23. Black Langshan hen. (Photograph from Urban\r\nFarms, Buffalo, New York)]\r\n\r\nThe breeding of fancy fowls is also an important pursuit. Those who\r\nengage in this line on a large scale locate on farms, but many of the\r\nsmaller breeders live in towns, and the greater number of the amateur\r\nfanciers who breed fine fowls for pleasure are city people.\r\n\r\nOn large poultry farms the work is usually done by men. There are many\r\nsmall plants operated by women. The ordinary farm and family flocks are\r\ncared for by women and children much oftener than by men, because, even\r\nwhen the men are interested in poultry, other work takes the farmer away\r\nfrom the vicinity of the house, and the city man away from home, so much\r\nthat they cannot look after poultry as closely as is necessary to get\r\nthe best results. Many women like to have the care of a small flock of\r\nfowls, because it takes them outdoors for a few minutes at intervals\r\nevery day, and the eggs and poultry sold may bring in a considerable\r\namount of pin money. Many boys, while attending the grammar and high\r\nschools, earn money by keeping a flock of fowls. Some have saved enough\r\nin this way to pay expenses at college for a year or more, or to give\r\nthem a start in a small business. When there are both boys and girls in\r\na family, such outdoor work usually falls to the lot of a boy. A girl\r\ncan do just as well if she has the opportunity and takes an interest in\r\nthe work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24. Pit Game cock. (Photograph from W. F. Liedtke,\r\nMeriden, Connecticut)]\r\n\r\n=Native fowls in America.= To appreciate the influence of improved races\r\nof fowls from various parts of the Old World upon the development of\r\npoultry culture in America, we must know what the fowls in this country\r\nwere like when poultry keepers here began to see the advantages of\r\nkeeping better stock, and must learn something of the history of the\r\nimproved races in the countries from which they came.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25. Dominique cockerel. (Photograph from W. H.\r\nDavenport, Coleraine, Massachusetts)]\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of native fowls in America we mean fowls derived from the\r\nstocks brought here by the early settlers. The fowl was not known in the\r\nWestern Hemisphere until it was brought here by Europeans. Britain,\r\nFrance, Spain, Holland, and Sweden all sent colonists to America, and\r\nfrom each of these countries came, no doubt, some of the ordinary fowls\r\nof that country. Perhaps improved varieties came from some of these\r\nlands in early colonial times, but the only breeds that retained their\r\nidentity sufficiently to have distinctive names were the Game Fowls,\r\nwhich came mostly from England, and the Dominiques (bluish-gray barred\r\nfowls which probably came from Holland or from the north of France,\r\nwhere fowls of this type were common).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26. Dominique hen. (Photograph from Skerritt and\r\nSon, Utica, New York)]\r\n\r\nThe Game Fowls, being prized for the sport of cockfighting, were often\r\nbred with great care, but the Dominique fowls (also called cuckoo fowls\r\nand hawk-colored fowls) were mixed with other stock, and the name was\r\ncommonly given to any fowl of that color, until after the improvement\r\nof fowls began. Then some people collected flocks of fowls of this color\r\nand bred them for uniformity in other characters. Well-bred fowls,\r\nhowever, were comparatively rare. Most of the stock all through the\r\ncountry was of the little mongrel type until about the middle of the\r\nlast century. Then that type began to disappear from New England, New\r\nYork, New Jersey, and eastern Pennsylvania. It remained longer in the\r\nNorthern states west of the Allegheny Mountains and a generation ago was\r\nstill the most common type in the upper Mississippi Valley. It is now\r\nunknown outside of the Southern states, and within ten or twenty years\r\nit will disappear entirely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27. Silver-Gray Dorking cock]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28. Silver-Gray Dorking hen]\r\n\r\n=Old European races of fowls.= With the exception of the Leghorn, most\r\nof the distinct breeds of European origin were brought from England, and\r\nthe types introduced were not the types as developed in the places\r\nwhere the breeds (other than English breeds) originated, but those\r\ntypes as modified by English fanciers. In America, again, most of these\r\nbreeds have been slightly changed to conform to the ideas of American\r\nfanciers. So, while the breed characters are still the same as in the\r\noriginal stocks, the pupil looking at birds of these breeds to-day must\r\nnot suppose that it was just such birds that came to this country from\r\nseventy to a hundred years ago, or that, if he went to the countries\r\nwhere those races originated, he would find birds just like those he had\r\nseen at home. Except in the case of the distinctly English breeds, such\r\nas the Dorking and the Cornish Indian Game, which are bred to greater\r\nperfection in their native land than elsewhere, he would find most of\r\nthe European races not so highly developed in the countries where they\r\noriginated as in England and America, where fanciers are more numerous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29. Single-Comb Brown Leghorn cockerel. (Photograph\r\nfrom Grove Hill Poultry Yards, Waltham, Massachusetts)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30. Rose-Comb Buff Leghorn hen. (Photograph from H.\r\nJ. Fisk, Falconer, New York)]\r\n\r\n=Italian fowls.= Strictly speaking, the Italian fowls in Italy are not\r\nan improved race. The fowl which is known in this country as the Leghorn\r\nfowl (because the first specimens brought here came from the port of\r\nLeghorn) is the common fowl of Italy and has changed very little since\r\nit was introduced into that country thousands of years ago. It is found\r\nthere in all colors, and mostly with a single comb. The Italian type is\r\nof particular interest, not only because of its influence in modern\r\ntimes, but because from it were probably derived most of the other\r\nEuropean races. Italian fowls were first brought to this country about\r\n1835, but did not attract popular attention until twenty-five or thirty\r\nyears later.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31. Silver-Spangled Hamburg cock[3]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32. Silver-Spangled Hamburg hen[3]]\r\n\r\n[3] Photograph from Dr. J. S. Wolfe, Bloomfield, New Jersey.\r\n\r\n=English races of fowls.= It is supposed that fowls were introduced into\r\nBritain from Italy shortly after the Roman conquest. The type was\r\nprobably very like that of ordinary Leghorn fowls of our own time, but\r\nwith smaller combs. From such stock the English developed two very\r\ndifferent races, the Pit Game and the Dorking. Game fowls were bred in\r\nall parts of the kingdom, but the Dorkings were a local breed developed\r\nby the people in the vicinity of the town of Dorking, where from very\r\nearly times the growing of poultry for the London market was an\r\nimportant local industry. Each in its way, these two breeds represent\r\nthe highest skill in breeding. In the Old English Game Fowl, symmetry,\r\nstrength, endurance, and courage were combined to perfection. The\r\nDorking is the finest type of table fowl that has ever been produced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33. White-Crested Black Polish cock[4]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34. White-Crested Black Polish hen[4]]\r\n\r\n[4] Photograph from Charles L. Seely, Afton, New York.\r\n\r\n=German and Dutch races.= The breeds now known as Hamburgs and Polish\r\nare of peculiar interest to a student of the evolution of races of\r\nfowls, because they present some characters not readily derived from the\r\nprimitive type of the fowl. The feather markings of some varieties of\r\nboth these breeds are unlike those of other races, and are markings\r\nwhich would not be likely to become established unless the fowls were\r\nbred systematically for that purpose. So, too, with the large crest of\r\nthe Polish fowl: to carry it the structure of the head must be changed.\r\nSuch changes require systematic breeding for a long period. Dutch and\r\nGerman artists of the sixteenth century painted many farmyard scenes\r\nshowing fowls of both these types, frequently in flocks with common\r\nfowls and with some that appear to be a mixture. To any one versed in\r\nthe breeding of poultry this indicates that these peculiar types had\r\nbeen made by very skillful breeders long before. The most reasonable\r\nsupposition is that these breeders were monks in the monasteries of\r\nCentral Europe. Throughout the Middle Ages the monks of Europe, more\r\nthan any other class of men, worked for improvement in agriculture as\r\nwell as for the advancement of learning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35. Houdan cock. (Photograph from the Houdan Yards,\r\nSewickley, Pennsylvania)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36. White Minorca hen. (Photograph from Tioga\r\nPoultry Farm, Apalachin, New York)]\r\n\r\n=French races.= The Houdan is the only French breed well known in\r\nAmerica. It is of the Polish type, but heavier, and the plumage is\r\nmottled irregularly, not distinctly marked as in the party-colored\r\nvarieties of Polish. The breed takes its name from the town of Houdan,\r\nthe center of a district in which this is the common type of fowl.\r\n\r\n=Spanish races.= The fowls of Spanish origin well known outside of Spain\r\nare the White-faced Black Spanish, the Black Minorca, and the Blue\r\nAndalusian. The fowls of Spain at the present time are mostly of the\r\nItalian type, with black (or in some districts blue) the predominant\r\ncolor. The Black Spanish seems to have been known in Holland and England\r\nfor two hundred years or more. In Spain the white face is but moderately\r\ndeveloped. The monstrous exaggeration of this character began in Holland\r\nand was carried to the extreme by British fanciers who admired it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37. Black Minorca cock. (Photograph from Arthur\r\nTrethaway, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania)]\r\n\r\nThe Black Minorca is supposed to have been brought to England direct\r\nfrom Spain about a century ago. There it was bred to much greater size,\r\nwith the comb often so large that it was a burden to the fowl. Blue\r\nAndalusians, at first called Blue Spanish and Blue Minorcas, were first\r\nknown in England about 1850.\r\n\r\n=Asiatic races of fowls.= The evolution of races of fowls in the Orient\r\ngave some general results strikingly different from those in Europe. As\r\nfar as is known, after the introduction of fowls into China and India\r\nsome thousand years ago the stock which went to those countries and that\r\nwhich descended from it was completely isolated from the fowls of\r\nWestern Asia, Africa, and Europe until the eighteenth century. When\r\ncommerce between Europe, India, and the East Indies began, the Europeans\r\nfound in these countries fowls of a much more rugged type than those of\r\nEurope. Some of these fowls were much larger than any that the visitors\r\nhad seen. The Aseel of India was a small but very strong, stocky type of\r\nGame. Among the Malayans the common fowl was a large, coarse type of\r\nGame. The hens of these breeds laid eggs of a reddish-brown color, while\r\nhens of all the races of Europe laid white eggs. Birds of both these\r\ntypes were taken to England early in the last century, and perhaps in\r\nsmall numbers before that time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38. Buff Cochin hen[5]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39. Buff Cochin cock[5]]\r\n\r\n[5] Photograph from Tienken and Case, Rochester, Michigan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40. Dark Brahma hen]\r\n\r\n=Chinese races.= In China a type of fowl in some ways much like the\r\nMalay, in others quite different, had been developed as the common stock\r\nof the country. They were about as tall as the Malays, much heavier, and\r\nvery quiet and docile. They were of various colors, had feathers on the\r\nshanks and feet, and laid brown eggs. Some of these fowls were brought\r\nto America in sailing vessels very early in the last century and\r\noccasionally after that until the middle of the century, but attracted\r\nno attention, for the birds were brought in small numbers for friends of\r\nsailors or for persons particularly interested in poultry, and at that\r\ntime there was no means of communication between fanciers in different\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41. Dark Brahma cockerel]\r\n\r\n=Japanese races.= Although the Japanese races of fowls had no particular\r\ninfluence on the development of poultry culture in America, they are of\r\ngreat interest in a study of poultry types, because, when intercourse\r\nbetween Japan and Western nations began, it was found that the ordinary\r\nfowls of Japan were much like the ordinary fowls of Europe and America,\r\nand not, as would be expected, like the fowls of China. This indicated\r\nthat there had been no exchange of fowls between China and Japan after\r\nthe type in China became changed. It also affords strong evidence that\r\nthe fowls of India and China, although so changed, were originally like\r\nthe European and Japanese common fowls. The special races developed in\r\nJapan were Game Fowls, more like the European than the Malay type; a\r\nlong-tailed fowl, very much like the Leghorn in other respects; and the\r\nvery short-legged Japanese Bantam.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42. Long-Tailed Japanese Phoenix cockerel.\r\n(Photograph from Urban Farms, Buffalo, New York)]\r\n\r\n=The \"hen-fever\" period.= We are all familiar with the phrase \"the hen\r\nfever\" and with its application to persons intensely interested in\r\npoultry, but few know how it originated. The interest in better poultry\r\nthat had been slowly growing in the Eastern states culminated in 1849 in\r\nan exhibition in the Public Garden in Boston, to which fanciers from\r\neastern Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and eastern Connecticut brought\r\ntheir choicest and rarest specimens. This was the first poultry show\r\nheld in America. Nearly fifteen hundred birds were exhibited, and the\r\nexhibitors numbered over two hundred. There were a few birds of other\r\nkinds, but fowls made by far the greater part of the show. All the\r\nprincipal races of Europe and Asia were represented. Most of the\r\nexhibitors lived in the immediate vicinity of Boston. About ten thousand\r\npeople attended this exhibition.\r\n\r\nSuch an event created a great sensation. Newspaper reports of it reached\r\nall parts of the country. The Chinese fowls, so large when compared with\r\nothers, were most noticed. At once a great demand for these fowls and\r\nfor their eggs arose, and prices for fancy poultry, which previously had\r\nbeen but little higher than prices for common poultry, rose so high that\r\nthose who paid such prices for fowls were commonly regarded as\r\nmonomaniacs. While the interest was not as great in other kinds of fowls\r\nas in the Shanghais, Cochin Chinas, and \"Brahmaputras,\" as they were\r\nthen called, all shared in the boom, and within a few years there was\r\nhardly a community in the northeastern part of the United States where\r\nthere was not some one keeping highly bred fowls. When the interest\r\nbecame general, the famous showman, P. T. Barnum, promoted a show of\r\npoultry in the American Museum in New York City. Many celebrated men\r\nbecame interested in fine poultry. Daniel Webster had been one of the\r\nexhibitors at the first show in 1849. The noted temperance lecturer,\r\nJohn B. Gough, was a very enthusiastic fancier.\r\n\r\nAfter a few years the excitement began to subside, and most people\r\nsupposed that it was about to die, never to revive. A Mr. Burnham, who\r\nhad been one of the most energetic promoters of Asiatic fowls, and had\r\nmade a small fortune while the boom lasted, had so little confidence in\r\nthe permanence of the poultry fancy that he published a book called \"The\r\nHistory of the Hen Fever,\" which presented the whole movement as a\r\nhumbug skillfully engineered by himself. This book was very widely read,\r\nand the phrase \"the hen fever,\" applying to enthusiastic amateur poultry\r\nkeepers, came into common use.\r\n\r\nSubsequent developments showed that those who had supposed that the\r\ninterest in fine poultry was only a passing fad were wrong. The true\r\nreason for its decline at that time was that the nation was approaching\r\na crisis in its history and a civil war. When the war was over, the\r\ninterest in poultry revived at once, and has steadily increased ever\r\nsince. The prices for fine specimens, which were considered absurd in\r\nthe days of the hen fever, are now ordinary prices for stock of high\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43. Barred Plymouth Rock cock. (Photograph from\r\nBureau of Animal Industry, United States Department of Agriculture)]\r\n\r\n=How the American breeds arose.= It is natural to suppose that with such\r\na variety of types of fowls, from so many lands, there was no occasion\r\nfor Americans to make any new breeds. If, however, you look critically\r\nat the foreign breeds, you may notice that not one of them had been\r\ndeveloped with reference to the simple requirements of the ordinary\r\nfarmer and poultry keeper. It was the increasing demand for eggs and\r\npoultry for market that had given the first impulse to the interest in\r\nspecial breeds. The first claim made for each of these was that it was a\r\nbetter layer than the ordinary fowl. In general, these claims were true,\r\nbut farmers and others who were interested primarily in producing eggs\r\nand poultry for the table were rather indifferent to the foreign breeds,\r\nbecause, among them all, there was not one as well adapted to the\r\nordinary American poultry keeper's needs as the old Dominique or as the\r\noccasional flocks of the old native stock that had been bred with some\r\nattention to size and to uniformity in other characters.\r\n\r\nTo every foreign breed these practical poultry keepers found some\r\nobjection. The Dorking was too delicate, and its five-toed feet made it\r\nclumsy. The Hamburgs, too, were delicate, and the most skillful breeding\r\nwas required to preserve their beautiful color markings. The superfluous\r\nfeathers on the heads of the crested breeds and on the feet of the\r\nAsiatics were equally objectionable. All the European races except the\r\nLeghorns had white skin and flesh-colored or slate-colored feet, while\r\nin America there was a very decided popular preference for fowls with\r\nyellow skin and legs. The Leghorns and the Asiatics met this\r\nrequirement, but the former were too small and their combs were\r\nunnecessarily large, while the latter were larger fowls than were\r\ndesired for general use, and their foot feathering was a handicap in\r\nbarnyards and on heavy, wet soils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44. Barred Plymouth Rock hen. (Photograph from\r\nBureau of Animal Industry, United States Department of Agriculture)]\r\n\r\nSo, while fanciers and those who were willing to give their poultry\r\nspecial attention, or who kept fowls for some special purpose which one\r\nof the foreign breeds suited, took these breeds up eagerly, farmers and\r\nother poultry keepers usually became interested in them only to the\r\nextent of using male birds of different breeds to cross with flocks of\r\nnative and grade hens. In consequence of this promiscuous crossing, the\r\nstock in the country rapidly changed, a new type of mongrel replacing\r\nthe old native stock.\r\n\r\nWhile the masses of poultry keepers were thus crossing new and old\r\nstock at random, many breeders were trying systematically to produce a\r\nnew breed that would meet all the popular requirements. Even before the\r\ndays of the hen fever two local breeds had arisen, probably by accident.\r\nThese were the Jersey Blue and the Bucks County Fowl, both of which\r\ncontinued down to our own time but never became popular. At the first\r\nexhibition in Boston a class had been provided for crossbred fowls, and\r\nin this was shown a new variety called the Plymouth Rock. From the\r\ndescriptions of these birds now in existence it appears that they looked\r\nmuch like the modern Partridge Plymouth Rock. Those who brought them out\r\nhoped that they would meet the popular demand, and for a short time it\r\nseemed that this hope might be realized, but interest in them soon\r\nwaned, and in a few years they were almost forgotten.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45. White Plymouth Rock hen (Photograph from C. E.\r\nHodgkins, Northampton, Massachusetts)]\r\n\r\nIn the light of the history of American breeds which did afterwards\r\nbecome popular we can see now that the ideas of the masses of American\r\npoultry keepers were not as strictly practical as their objections to\r\nthe various foreign breeds appeared to show. The three varieties that\r\nhave just been mentioned, and many others arising from time to time, met\r\nall the expressed requirements of the practical poultry keeper quite as\r\nwell as those which subsequently caught his fancy. Indeed, as will be\r\nshown farther on, some of the productions of this period, after being\r\nneglected for a long time, finally became very popular. Usually this\r\nhappened when their color became fashionable.\r\n\r\n=The modern Barred Plymouth Rock.= Shortly after our Civil War two\r\npoultrymen in Connecticut--one a fancier, the other a farmer--engaged in\r\na joint effort to produce the business type of fowl that would meet the\r\nfavor of American farmers. A male of the old Dominique type was crossed\r\nwith some Black Cochin hens. This mating produced some chickens having\r\nthe color of the sire, but larger and more robust. Another and more\r\nskillful fancier saw these chickens and persuaded the farmer to sell him\r\na few of the best. A few years later, when, by careful breeding and\r\nselection, he had fixed the type and had specimens enough to supply eggs\r\nto other fanciers, he took some of his new breed to a show at Worcester,\r\nMassachusetts. Up to this time he had not thought of a name for them,\r\nbut as people who saw them would want to know what they were called, a\r\nname was now necessary. It occurred to this man that the name \"Plymouth\r\nRock,\" having once been given to a promising American breed, would be\r\nappropriate. So the birds were exhibited as Plymouth Rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46. Buff Plymouth Rock cock]\r\n\r\nThis new breed caught the popular fancy at once, for it had the color\r\nwhich throughout this country was supposed always to be associated with\r\nexceptional vigor and productiveness, and it had greater size than the\r\nDominique. The fame of the new breed spread rapidly. It was impossible\r\nto supply the demand from the original stock, and, as there is usually\r\nmore than one way of producing a type by crossing, good imitations of\r\nthe original were soon abundant. Farmers and market poultrymen by\r\nthousands took up the Plymouth Rock, while all over the land fanciers\r\nwere trying to perfect the color which their critical taste found very\r\npoor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47. Silver-Penciled Plymouth Rock hen]\r\n\r\n=Other varieties of the Plymouth Rock.= The success of the Plymouth Rock\r\ngave fresh impetus to efforts to make new breeds and varieties of the\r\nsame general character. Great as was its popularity, the new breed did\r\nnot suit all. Some did not like the color; some objected to the single\r\ncomb, thinking that a rose comb or a pea comb had advantages; some\r\npreferred a shorter, blockier body; others wanted a larger, longer body.\r\nThe off-colored birds which new races usually produce in considerable\r\nnumbers, even when the greater number come quite true, also suggested to\r\nsome who obtained them new varieties of the Plymouth Rock, while to\r\nothers it seemed better policy to give them new names and exploit them\r\nas new and distinct breeds.\r\n\r\nBoth black and white specimens came often in the early flocks of Barred\r\nPlymouth Rocks. The black ones were developed as a distinct breed,\r\ncalled the Black Java. The white ones, after going for a while under\r\nvarious names, and after strong opposition from those who claimed that\r\nthe name \"Plymouth Rock\" belonged exclusively to birds of the color with\r\nwhich the name had become identified, finally secured recognition as\r\nWhite Plymouth Rocks. Almost immediately Buff Plymouth Rocks appeared.\r\nFor reasons which will appear later, the origin of these will be given\r\nin another connection. Then came in rapid succession the\r\nSilver-Penciled, the Partridge, or Golden-Penciled (which, as has been\r\nsaid, is probably quite a close duplicate of the type to which the name\r\n\"Plymouth Rock\" was originally given), and the Columbian, or Ermine,\r\nPlymouth Rock. These were all of the general type of the Barred variety,\r\nbut because in most cases they were made by different combinations, and\r\nbecause fanciers are much more particular to breed for color than to\r\nbreed for typical form, the several varieties of the Plymouth Rock are\r\nslightly different in form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48. Silver-Laced Wyandotte pullet. Photographed in\r\nposition showing lacing on back]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49. Silver-Laced Wyandotte cockerel]\r\n\r\n=The Wyandottes.= Closely following the appearance of the Barred\r\nPlymouth Rock came the Silver-Laced Wyandotte, called at first simply\r\nthe Wyandotte. The original type was quite different in color from the\r\nmodern type. It had on each feather a small white center surrounded by\r\na heavy black lacing. This has been gradually changed until now the\r\nwhite center is large and the black edging narrow. At first some of\r\nthese Wyandottes had rose combs and some had single combs. The rose comb\r\nwas preferred and the single-combed birds were discarded as culls.\r\n\r\nStrange as it seems in the case of an event so recent, no one knows\r\nwhere the first Wyandottes came from. It is supposed that they were one\r\nof the many varieties developed either by chance or in an effort to meet\r\nthe demand for a general-purpose fowl. They appear to have come into the\r\nhands of those who first exploited them in some way that left no trace\r\nof their source. They went under several different names until 1883,\r\nwhen the name \"Wyandotte\" was given them as an appropriate and\r\neuphonious name for an American breed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50. White Wyandotte cockerel. (Photograph from W. E.\r\nMack, Woodstock, Vermont)]\r\n\r\nNext appeared a Golden-Laced Wyandotte, marked like the Silver-Laced\r\nvariety but having golden bay where that had white. This variety was\r\ndeveloped from an earlier variety of unknown origin, known in Southern\r\nWisconsin and Northern Illinois (about 1870 and earlier) under the name\r\nof \"Winnebago.\"\r\n\r\nThe Silver-Laced Wyandottes, like the Barred Plymouth Rocks, produced\r\nsome black and some white specimens. From these were made the Black\r\nWyandottes and the White Wyandottes. Then came the Buff Wyandottes\r\n(from the same original source as the Buff Plymouth Rocks), and after\r\nthem Partridge Wyandottes, Silver-Penciled Wyandottes, and Columbian, or\r\nErmine, Wyandottes. From the three last-named varieties came the\r\nPlymouth Rock varieties of the corresponding colors, the first stocks of\r\nthese being the single-combed specimens from the flocks of breeders of\r\nthese varieties of Wyandottes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51. Silver-Penciled Wyandotte cockerel. (Photograph\r\nfrom James S. Wason, Grand Rapids, Michigan)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52. Partridge Wyandotte pullet]\r\n\r\n=The Rhode Island Red.= Among the earliest of the local types developed\r\nin America was a red fowl which soon became the prevalent type in the\r\negg-farming section of Rhode Island and quite popular in the adjacent\r\npart of Massachusetts. Most of the stock of this race was produced by a\r\ncontinuous process of grading and crossing which was systematic only in\r\nthat it was the common practice to preserve none but the red males after\r\nintroducing a cross of another color. A few breeders in the district\r\nbred their flocks more carefully than others, but the race as a whole\r\nwas not really thoroughbred until after it became more widely popular.\r\n\r\nAlthough the formation of this race began about 1850 (perhaps earlier),\r\nit was fifty years before it became known outside of the limited area in\r\nwhich it was almost the only type to be seen. Indeed, the first birds of\r\nthis race to attract the attention of the public were exhibited about\r\n1890 as Buff Plymouth Rocks and Buff Wyandottes. At that time very few\r\nof the Rhode Island Reds were as dark in color as the average specimen\r\nnow seen in the showroom, and buff specimens were numerous. Birds with\r\nrose combs, birds with single combs, birds with pea combs, and birds\r\nwith intermediate types of comb could often be found in the same flock.\r\nSo it was not a very difficult matter, among many thousands of birds, to\r\npick out some that would pass for Buff Plymouth Rocks and some that\r\nwould pass for Buff Wyandottes. These varieties were also made in other\r\nways, mostly by various crosses with the Buff Cochin, but for some years\r\nbreeders continued to draw on the Rhode Island supply.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53. Columbian Wyandottes. (Photograph from R. G.\r\nRichardson, Lowell, Massachusetts)]\r\n\r\nSome people in the Rhode Island district thought that a breed which\r\ncould thus furnish the foundation for varieties of two other breeds\r\nought to win popularity on its own merits. So they began to exhibit and\r\nadvertise Rhode Island Reds. At first they made little progress, but as\r\nthe breed improved, many more people became interested in it, and soon\r\nit was one of the most popular breeds in the country. The modern\r\nexhibition Rhode Island Red is of a dark brownish red in color.\r\n\r\n=The American idea in England; the Orpington.= At the time that the\r\nChinese fowls were attracting wide attention in America and England some\r\nwere taken to other countries of Europe. In almost every country they\r\nhad some influence upon the native stock, but as each of the old\r\ncountries had one or more improved races that suited most of those\r\ngiving special attention to poultry culture, the influence of the\r\nAsiatics was less marked than in our country.\r\n\r\nWhen the Plymouth Rock and the Wyandotte became popular in America, they\r\nwere taken to England, where, in spite of the preference for white skin\r\nand flesh-colored legs, they were soon in such favor that a shrewd\r\nEnglish breeder saw the advantage of making another breed of the same\r\ngeneral type but with skin and legs of the colors preferred in England.\r\nHe called his new breed the Orpington, giving it the name of the town in\r\nwhich he lived. The first Orpingtons were black and were made by\r\ncrossing the black progeny of Plymouth Rocks (which in America had been\r\nused to make the Black Java), Black Minorcas, and Black Langshans. Then\r\nthe originator of the Orpingtons put out a buff variety, which he\r\nclaimed was made by another particular combination of crosses, but which\r\nothers said was only an improvement of a local breed known as the\r\nLincolnshire Buff. Later White Orpingtons and Spangled Orpingtons\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\n=Present distribution of improved races.= Having briefly traced the\r\ndistribution of the fowl in ancient times, and the movements which in\r\nmodern times brought long-separated branches of the species together,\r\nlet us look at the present situation.\r\n\r\nThe Plymouth Rocks, Wyandottes, Rhode Island Reds, and Orpingtons, which\r\nare essentially one type, the differences between them being\r\nsuperficial, constitute the greater part of the improved fowls of\r\nAmerica and England and are favorites with progressive poultry keepers\r\nin many other lands. In many parts of this country one rarely sees a\r\nfowl that is not of this type, either of one of the breeds named or a\r\ngrade of the same type. After the general-purpose type, the laying type,\r\nwhich includes the Italian, Spanish, German, and Dutch races, is the\r\nmost popular, but in this type popularity is limited in most places to\r\nthe Leghorns and to a few breeds which, though classed as distinct\r\nbreeds, are essentially the same. The Ancona is really a Leghorn, and\r\nthe Andalusian, although it comes from Spain, is, like other races in\r\nthat land, distinctly of the same type as the fowls of Italy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54. Single-Combed Buff Orpington cock. (Photograph\r\nfrom Miss Henrietta E. Hooker, South Hadley, Massachusetts)]\r\n\r\nWith the growth of a general-purpose class, interest in the Asiatic\r\nfowls rapidly declined. They are now kept principally by fanciers and by\r\nmarket poultry growers who produce extra large fowls for the table.\r\n\r\n=Deformed and dwarf races.= Although some of the races of fowls that\r\nhave been considered have odd characters which, when greatly\r\nexaggerated, are detrimental and bring the race to decay, such\r\ncharacters as large combs, crests, feathered legs, and the peculiar\r\ndevelopment of the face in the Black Spanish fowl, when moderately\r\ndeveloped, do not seriously affect the usefulness of fowls possessing\r\nthem. With a little extra care they usually do as well as fowls of\r\ncorresponding plain types. Poultry keepers who admire such decorations\r\nand keep only a few birds do not find the extra care that they require\r\nburdensome, and consequently all these races have become well\r\nestablished and at times popular. It is notable that in all fowls of\r\nthis class the odd character is added to the others or is an\r\nexaggeration of a regular character. There are two other classes of odd\r\ntypes of fowls. The first of these is made up of a small group of\r\nvarieties defective in one character; the second comprises the dwarf\r\nvarieties, most of which are miniatures of larger varieties.\r\n\r\n=Silky fowls.= In all races of fowls individuals sometimes appear in\r\nwhich the web of the feathers is of a peculiar formation, resembling\r\nhair. Such fowls are called silkies. They are occasionally exhibited as\r\ncuriosities but are not often bred to reproduce this character. There is\r\none distinct race of white fowls, so small that it is usually classed as\r\na bantam, having feathers of this kind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55. Single-Combed White Orpington hen. (Photograph\r\nfrom Bureau of Animal Industry, United States Department of\r\nAgriculture)]\r\n\r\n=Frizzled fowls.= The feathers of a fowl are sometimes curled at the\r\ntips, like the short curls in the feathers which indicate the sex of a\r\ndrake. Such birds are called frizzles or frizzled fowls. True frizzles,\r\nlike true silkies from races having normal plumage, are very rare. Many\r\nof the fowls exhibited at poultry shows as Frizzles are ordinary birds\r\nthe feathers of which have been curled artificially.\r\n\r\n=Rumpless fowls.= The tail feathers of a fowl are borne on a fleshy\r\nprotuberance at the lower end of the spine. It sometimes happens that\r\none or more of the lower vertebrae are missing. In that case the fowl has\r\nno tail and the feathers on the back, which in a normal fowl divide and\r\nhang down at each side, fall smoothly all around. True rumpless fowls\r\nare rare. Many of the specimens exhibited are birds from which the rump\r\nwas removed when they were very young.\r\n\r\n=Bantams.= Dwarf, or bantam, fowls, on account of their diminutive size\r\nand pert ways, are especially attractive to children. Breeding them to\r\nsecure the minimum size, the desired type, and fine quality in plumage\r\ncolor has the same fascination for a fancier as the breeding of large\r\nfowls, and as the small birds are better adapted to small spaces,\r\nfanciers who have little room often devote themselves to the breeding of\r\nbantams. The larger and hardier varieties of bantams are good for eggs\r\nand poultry for home use, but are not often kept primarily for these\r\nproducts. Most people who keep bantams keep only a few for pleasure, and\r\nthe eggs and poultry they furnish are but a small part of what the\r\nfamily consumes. Bantam keepers who have a surplus of such products can\r\nusually find customers in their own neighborhood. The very small bantams\r\nand the very rare varieties are usually delicate and so hard to rear\r\nthat amateurs who try them soon become discouraged and either give up\r\nbantams or take one of the hardy kinds. It is better to begin with one\r\nof the popular varieties, which are as interesting as any and, on the\r\nwhole, are the most satisfactory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56. White Cochin Bantam cockerel]\r\n\r\n=Origin of bantams.= After the explanation of the origin of varieties\r\ngiven in Chapter III, and the description of the evolution of the\r\ndifferent races of fowls in the present chapter, it is perhaps not\r\nreally necessary to tell how dwarf races of fowls originated; but the\r\nbelief that such races were unknown until brought to Europe from the\r\ncity of Bantam, in the Island of Java, is so widespread that it can do\r\nno harm to give the facts which disprove this and in doing so to show\r\nagain how easily artificial varieties are made by skillful poultry\r\nfanciers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57. Bantams make good pets]\r\n\r\nAs has been stated, people who do not understand the close relations of\r\nthe different races of fowls, and do not know how quickly new types may\r\nbe established by careful breeding, attach a great deal of importance to\r\npurity of breed. Hence, unscrupulous promoters of new breeds have often\r\nclaimed that they received their original stock direct from some remote\r\nplace or from some one who had long bred it pure. The idea of assigning\r\nthe town of Bantam as the home of a true species of dwarf domestic fowl\r\nseems to have occurred to some one in England more than a hundred years\r\nago, and to have been suggested because of the resemblance of the name\r\nof this Asiatic city to the English word \"banty,\" the popular name for a\r\ndwarf fowl. It seems strange that such a fiction should be accepted as\r\naccounting for dwarf varieties of European races, but it was published\r\nby some of the early writers, used by lexicographers, and, having found\r\na place in the dictionaries, was accepted as authoritative by the\r\nmajority of later writers on poultry, even after some of the highest\r\nauthorities had shown conclusively that this view of the origin of dwarf\r\nraces was erroneous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58. Black-Tailed White Japanese Bantams. (Photograph\r\nfrom Frederick W. Otte, Peekskill, New York)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59. White Polish Bantam hen]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60. White Polish Bantam cock]\r\n\r\nNo evidence of the existence of a dwarf race of fowls in Java has ever\r\nbeen produced. The Chinese and Japanese bantams did not come to Europe\r\nand America until long after the name \"bantam\" came into use. Dwarfs\r\noccur and undoubtedly have occurred frequently in every race of fowls.\r\nUsually they are unsymmetrical and weakly, and are called runts and put\r\nout of the way as soon as possible. But occasionally an undersized\r\nindividual is finely formed, active, and hardy. By mating such a\r\nspecimen with the smallest specimen of the other sex that can be found\r\n(even though the latter is much larger), and by repeated selection of\r\nthe smallest specimens, a dwarf race may be obtained. It could be made,\r\nthough not so rapidly, by systematic selection of the smallest ordinary\r\nspecimens and by keeping the growing chicks so short of food that they\r\nwould be stunted. The latter process, however, is so tedious that no one\r\nis likely to adopt it. Usually the idea of making a new variety of\r\nbantams does not occur to a breeder until he sees a good dwarf specimen\r\nof a race of which there is no dwarf variety. Then, if he undertakes to\r\nmake such a variety, he is likely to use in the process both small\r\nspecimens of large races and birds of long-established dwarf races.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61.

Light Brahma Bantam hen with brood[8]]\r\n\r\n[8] Photograph from Brook View Farm, Newbury, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n=Varieties of bantams.= The most popular bantams in this country to-day\r\nare the Cochin Bantams, formerly called Pekin Bantams because the first\r\nthat were seen in Europe and America had come from Peking. Only the\r\nself-colored varieties--buff, black, and white--are natives of China.\r\nThe Partridge variety was made in England, where there are several other\r\ncolor varieties not known in this country. The Common Game Bantam is a\r\ndwarf Pit Game fowl; the Exhibition Game Bantam is a dwarf type\r\nresembling the Exhibition Game, developed from the Common Game Bantam.\r\nRose-Comb Black and Rose-Comb White Bantams are diminutive Hamburg\r\nfowls; Polish Bantams are diminutive Polish. The Sebright Bantams are of\r\nthe same general type as the Rose-Combs, but in color they are laced\r\nlike the large varieties of Polish, not spangled like the party-colored\r\nHamburgs. They are further distinguished by being \"hen-tailed,\" that is,\r\nthe males having tails like hens. Sebright Bantams were made in England\r\nabout a hundred years ago, by Sir John Sebright, for whom they were\r\nnamed. Although the large Brahmas and Cochins are originally of the same\r\nstock, no bantams of the colors of the Brahmas have come from China. The\r\nLight and Dark Brahma Bantams were made in England and America in very\r\nrecent times. From Japan has come a peculiar type of bantam with very\r\nshort legs, a large tail carried very high, and a large single comb. In\r\ntheir native country the Japanese Bantams are not separated into\r\ndistinct color varieties. In England and America there are black, white,\r\ngray, black-tailed white, and buff varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF FOWLS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe methods of managing fowls vary according to the conditions under\r\nwhich they are kept and the time that the keeper can give them. Fowls\r\nought to have an outdoor run, and it is desirable that this should be\r\nlarge enough to be kept in sod; but very few people in towns can give\r\ntheir fowls grass yards, and the advantages of an outdoor run will not\r\nin themselves compensate for neglect in other matters. Hence we often\r\nsee fowls under poor conditions, with good care, doing better than\r\nfowls, in a much more favorable environment, that are given indifferent\r\ncare. No absolute rules for keeping fowls under any given conditions can\r\nbe made. In general, small flocks of fowls that have free range or\r\nlarge, grassy yards need very little attention, while those that are\r\nclosely confined require a great deal.\r\n\r\nWith good care the egg production of fowls in close confinement is often\r\nbetter than that from fowls at liberty, but if the cost of caring for\r\nthe fowls is computed at current rates for common labor, the rate of\r\ncompensation is often higher on fowls running at large than on fowls in\r\nconfinement which are producing many more eggs. The question of profits\r\nfrom amateur poultry keeping, however, should not be considered solely\r\nwith reference to the compensation for time used, nor should such work\r\nbe adjusted wholly with reference to economic results, for it combines\r\nrecreation, education, and money compensation, and the first two results\r\nshould have as much consideration as the last.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter the methods adapted to small flocks are first described\r\nfor the instruction of the pupil, and then descriptions of operations on\r\na larger scale are given for his information.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALL FLOCKS ON TOWN LOTS\r\n\r\n=Numbers in flocks.= The average number of fowls kept by a town family\r\nfor its own use is about one dozen. Very few who keep hens have less\r\nthan half a dozen, and not many who plan only to supply their own tables\r\nhave more than a dozen and a half. Six fowls, if well cared for, will\r\nproduce all the eggs used by an average family of two or three persons\r\nduring the greater part of the year.\r\n\r\n=Houses and yards.= For a dozen medium-sized fowls the house should be\r\nabout 8 ft. x 8 ft. on the ground, with the highest point of the roof\r\nabout 6 or 7 feet from the floor. The general rule is to make the\r\npoultry house face the sun, and have the windows and the outside doors\r\nin or near the front. The object of this is to get as much sunlight in\r\nthe house as possible in winter, when the sun is low, and to have the\r\nwalls tight that are exposed to the prevailing cold winds. In the\r\nNorthern Hemisphere the front of the house is toward the south; in the\r\nSouthern Hemisphere it is toward the north. In tropical and subtropical\r\ncountries houses are often so constructed that they can be kept open on\r\nall sides in summer and closed tightly, except in front, during cool\r\nweather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69. Small house used for fowls and pigeons]\r\n\r\nIf the land on which a house stands is sandy and well drained, the floor\r\nmay be of earth. The common practice where earth floors are used is to\r\nfill the earth level with the top of the sill and renew it once a year\r\nby removing the soil that has become mixed with droppings of the fowls\r\nand putting in fresh earth. When a house stands on wet land or on clay\r\nsoil, it is better to have a floor of boards or of cement.\r\n\r\nFowls may be confined to a house for a year or more and lay well and be\r\nin apparently good condition at the end of such a period, but as the\r\nchickens hatched from the eggs of fowls that have been so closely\r\nconfined for even a few months are almost invariably less vigorous than\r\nthose produced from fowls that live a more natural life, this plan is\r\nnot much used except by those who keep a few fowls for their eggs only\r\nand renew the stock by purchase as often as necessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70. An old-style small poultry house and yard]\r\n\r\nTo give a flock of a dozen fowls outdoor air and exercise enough to keep\r\nthem in good condition, a yard containing about 300 sq. ft. is\r\nnecessary. There is no perceptible advantage in giving more yard room\r\nthan this, unless the yard can be made so large that grass will grow\r\ncontinuously in the greater part of it. On most soils this would\r\nrequire a yard containing from 750 to 1000 sq. ft. in sod before being\r\nused for poultry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71. Coop and shade for flock of Bantams[9]]\r\n\r\n[9] The coop is an old dry-goods box; the shade is a burlap bag.\r\nMakeshift arrangements are not always nice looking, but some of the\r\nfinest chickens are kept in very poor quarters.\r\n\r\nWhen fowls are confined to their houses, or to the houses and small\r\nyards, the droppings must be removed at frequent, regular intervals. To\r\nfacilitate this it is customary to have a wide board, called the\r\ndroppings board, under the roost at a distance of eight or ten inches.\r\nAll the droppings made while the birds are on the roost fall on this\r\nboard and are easily collected and removed. It is a good plan to keep a\r\nsupply of dry earth in a convenient place, and strew a little of this\r\nover the droppings board after each cleaning. Sifted coal ashes, land\r\nplaster, and dry sawdust are sometimes used instead of earth on the\r\ndroppings boards. The droppings of fowls, when not mixed with other\r\nmatter, are often salable for use in tanning leather, but in most cases\r\nthe difference in their value for this purpose and for use as plant\r\nfertilizer is not great enough to pay for the extra trouble which is\r\nmade by saving them for the tanners. Poultry manure is one of the most\r\nvaluable fertilizers and can always be used to good advantage on lawns\r\nand gardens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 72. Neat house for six hens]\r\n\r\nIf the floor is of wood or of cement, a thin layer of earth or sand\r\nspread upon it makes it more comfortable for the fowls. On all kinds of\r\nfloors the modern practice is to use a few inches of litter of some\r\nkind. There is a great variety of materials that will serve this\r\npurpose. Lawn clippings raked up after they are dry, dried weeds and\r\ngrass from the garden, leaves collected when dry and stored to be used\r\nas wanted, straw, hay, cornstalks cut into short lengths, and shavings,\r\nsuch as are sold baled for bedding horses and cattle, are all good.\r\nFresh litter should be added in small quantities about once a week.\r\nAbout once a month the coarse litter on top should be raked aside, and\r\nthe fine litter mixed with droppings underneath removed. Once or twice a\r\nyear all the material should be taken out and a fresh start made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73. House for a dozen fowls. Floor, 8 ft. x 8 ft.;\r\nheight at sides, 4 ft.; height in middle, 7 ft.]\r\n\r\nWhen kept in a house having an earth floor, fowls will scratch aside the\r\nlitter from small spaces and wallow and dust themselves. In houses\r\nhaving hard floors, shallow boxes about 2 ft. square, containing\r\nseveral inches of dry earth, are placed for the birds' dust baths. Fresh\r\nearth must be provided frequently or they will not use the bath as\r\nfreely as is desirable. For use in winter the earth must be so dry that\r\nit will not freeze, but the birds prefer earth that is slightly moist.\r\nThe first function of the dust bath is to clean the feathers, and damp\r\nearth does this much better than earth that is very dry. In wallowing to\r\nclean their plumage fowls also rid themselves of lice. When it is not\r\nconvenient to store much earth, the same material may do double\r\nservice--first in the dust bath, then on the droppings board.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74. Small houses in back yard]\r\n\r\nIn a bare yard the soil should be turned over often, all the matter that\r\ncan be raked up with a fine rake having first been removed. A yard that\r\nis in grass requires little care except near the house, where the ground\r\nmay be bare. Here it should be forked over occasionally.\r\n\r\n=Feeding.= The feeding of a small flock of fowls is a very simple\r\nprocess. The table and kitchen waste of an ordinary family will furnish\r\nall the soft food that they need, and usually enough green food to\r\nprevent their suffering for lack of such foods if no other provision is\r\nmade for supplying them. This waste should not be carried from the house\r\nas it is made, and thrown on the ground for the fowls to pick out of the\r\ndirt. A better way is to provide a covered jar large enough to hold the\r\naccumulation of this material for a day. Into this may be put all the\r\nleavings from the table, except such things as orange and banana\r\npeelings, large bones, and pieces of fat meat. Once a day, at whatever\r\ntime is most convenient, the contents of the jar should be mixed with as\r\nmuch corn meal and bran (equal parts by measure) as will take up the\r\nwater in them and make a moist but not sloppy mash. This should be fed\r\nin a clean trough. If the trough stands high enough from the floor to\r\nkeep the contents clean, it will do no harm if more food is given than\r\nthe birds will eat up at once, but the quantity given should never be so\r\ngreat that it will not be eaten before the next feeding time.\r\n\r\nMost people find the morning the most convenient time to give the mash.\r\nIf the mash is fed in the morning, a small feed of hard grain should be\r\ngiven about noon, and a more liberal one an hour or two before sunset.\r\nSome poultry keepers feed the different grains separately; others mix\r\nthem before feeding. Advocates of different practices often imagine\r\nadvantages for that which they favor, but no advantage can be\r\ndemonstrated for either. Wheat and cracked corn are the grains most used\r\nin this country; they are about equal in feeding value. As corn is\r\nnearly always cheaper than wheat, the usual practice is to feed about\r\ntwice as much corn. When the grains are mixed, one part (by measure) of\r\nwheat is used to two parts of cracked corn. When they are fed\r\nseparately, it is usual to feed the wheat at noon, as the light feed,\r\nand the corn in the evening, as the heavy feed. All the common grains\r\nexcept rye make good poultry foods. Why fowls do not like rye is one of\r\nthe puzzles of poultry keeping. In some countries it is used for poultry\r\nto a greater extent than in the United States, and fowls forced to eat\r\nit here have done very well for short periods, but will not eat it\r\nreadily if they are accustomed to other grains and can get enough to\r\nsustain life without it. Fowls do not like dry oats so well as corn and\r\nwheat, but have not such a dislike for them as for rye. They are very\r\nfond of oats soaked in water and partly sprouted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75. With curtains closed]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76. With one curtain open]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77. As an open-front house]\r\n\r\nPOULTRY HOUSE USED AT THE CENTRAL EXPERIMENT STATION, OTTAWA, CANADA.\r\n(Photograph from the station)\r\n\r\nThe quantity of grain to be given any flock of fowls must be determined\r\nby trial and observation. The grain should not be fed in troughs from\r\nwhich the birds can eat it very quickly, but scattered in the litter on\r\nthe floor, so that the fowls will take exercise scratching it out, and\r\neat slowly. There is an advantage in giving some soft and quickly\r\ndigested food, but if too much of the food can be eaten quickly, the\r\nbirds do not take exercise enough. When there is grass in the poultry\r\nyard, it is a good plan to scatter the grain in the grass sometimes in\r\nfine weather. The hens will find it all, and in scratching it out will\r\nbring up the dead grass, and a better sod will grow afterward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78. Flock of Barred Plymouth Rocks]\r\n\r\nA dozen medium-sized fowls, if fed in the morning with the mash\r\ndescribed above, would probably need a little over a pint of grain in\r\nthe middle of the day and about a quart toward evening. An experienced\r\nfeeder can usually tell by the eagerness of the fowls for their food\r\nwhether to increase or diminish the quantity; but the most expert\r\npoultry keeper does not rely upon this kind of observation alone.\r\nOccasionally, before giving food, he looks in the litter to see if there\r\nis grain left there from previous feedings, and if he finds much, gives\r\nno more until the birds have eaten this all up clean.\r\n\r\nWater should be given as often as is necessary to keep the supply quite\r\nfresh. In cool (but not freezing) weather, once a day is usually\r\nsufficient. In hot weather the water should be fresh two or three times\r\na day, in order that the birds may have cool drinks. In freezing weather\r\nmany poultry keepers give the water warm, because then it does not\r\nfreeze so quickly. The advantage of this is very slight, and wattles\r\nthat are wet with warm water in extreme cold weather become especially\r\nsusceptible to frost. It is not really necessary to give fowls water\r\nwhen they can get snow or ice in a form in which they can eat it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 79. Flock of Single-Comb White Leghorns]\r\n\r\nHens that are laying must be well supplied with oyster shells or lime in\r\nsome form for the shells of the eggs. They can get a part of the lime\r\nrequired for this purpose from the lime in foodstuffs, but not nearly\r\nenough to make good thick shells for all their eggs when they are laying\r\nwell. Ground oyster shells are sold by all dealers in poultry supplies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80. White Wyandotte hen and chicks]\r\n\r\n=Growing chickens.= Where old fowls have to be kept in close\r\nconfinement, very little can be done in growing chickens. Some amateur\r\npoultry keepers raise in small, bare yards birds that are as good as the\r\naverage chickens grown under more favorable conditions, but where one\r\nsucceeds in doing this a hundred fail. Most of the chickens grown in\r\nclose quarters are very poor indeed in comparison with farm-grown\r\nchickens, and quite unfit to be kept for laying or breeding purposes.\r\nThose who succeed in growing good chickens in a small place usually give\r\na great deal more time to the work than the chickens produced are worth.\r\nThe best way for a poultry keeper so situated to get as much as possible\r\nof the pleasure of this interesting line of work is to hatch a few\r\nbroods and, when the chicks are large enough, broil, eat, or sell all\r\nbut a few of the best pullets and one or two cockerels. If these\r\nthrive, they may be worth keeping for a year; but if, as they mature,\r\nthey do not seem rugged, it is not wise to use them for laying stock.\r\n\r\nWhere there is room to give young chickens a good grass yard, a limited\r\nnumber can be grown to maturity year after year on a town lot and used\r\nfor laying and breeding purposes. Many town poultry keepers who might\r\ngrow a few very good chickens never grow a good one because they always\r\ntry to raise too many for the space at their disposal. Fifty or a\r\nhundred chickens may be kept until two months old on a plot of land only\r\nlarge enough to carry twelve or fifteen to maturity. So people start out\r\nwith a great many more chickens than they ought to have on their land,\r\nnever thinking that the better their chickens do at the start the sooner\r\nthey will begin to overcrowd their quarters, and that when that stage is\r\nreached, the promising results of several months' work may in a few days\r\nbe ruined beyond remedy. After they are two or three months old, young\r\nchickens will not make the best growth of which they are capable unless\r\nthey have either a great deal of room or a great deal more care than\r\nmost people who raise only a few, and have other work to do, can afford\r\nto give them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALL FLOCKS ON ORDINARY FARMS\r\n\r\n=Numbers in flocks.= The ordinary farm flock consists of from fifty to\r\none hundred adult fowls and, during the growing season, from one hundred\r\nto two hundred chickens. The old stock is usually kept in one or more\r\nsmall houses located among the other outbuildings, and all run together\r\nduring the day. If the farmer wants to keep the fowls out of the\r\ndooryard and the kitchen garden, he does not make yards for the fowls,\r\nbut incloses the dooryard and garden. Outside of these the birds go\r\nwhere they please. The coops for the young chickens are often kept in\r\nthe dooryard or the garden until the chickens are weaned, but after\r\nthat the young birds are nearly always turned out to take their chances\r\nwith the old ones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 81. A small farm stock of fowls, ducks, and turkeys]\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions a farm flock is not often very productive, yet, as\r\nthe birds secure a large part of their food by foraging, the flock may\r\nbe more profitable than a more productive flock for which all food is\r\nbought and upon which a great deal of labor is expended. While this way\r\nof keeping fowls on farms is not in itself commendable, it is not to be\r\naltogether condemned, because circumstances often compel the farmer to\r\ntreat his fowls as a sort of volunteer or self-producing crop. The\r\nconditions on a farm admit of this, and as a matter of fact the greater\r\npart of our enormous total production of eggs and poultry comes from the\r\nhalf-neglected flocks on the ordinary farms. Hence the conditions are\r\ntolerable where they are necessary, but whenever it is possible to give\r\nfarm fowls enough attention to obviate the faults of common practice,\r\nthe product and the profits can be greatly increased with very little\r\nincrease in the cost of production. In this section we consider the\r\nbest methods of securing this result when all the old stock is to be\r\nkept as one flock. Old stock and young ought always to be separated\r\nunless the old birds constitute an insignificant portion of the flock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 82. Good poultry house on Texas farm. (Photograph\r\nfrom Bureau of Animal Industry, United States Department of\r\nAgriculture)]\r\n\r\n=Single houses for farm flocks.= It is as true on a farm as elsewhere\r\nthat the greatest yields of eggs and the best growth in young birds are\r\nsecured when the flock is divided into small groups. But a farm flock of\r\nthe class under consideration, while it makes its headquarters in such\r\nbuildings as may be provided, will forage a considerable distance in\r\nevery direction, going among growing crops from which the larger farm\r\nanimals must be excluded, and also following the larger animals in their\r\nstables, yards, and pastures and picking up food left by them. As fowls\r\nalso eat many weeds and seeds of weeds, and all kinds of destructive\r\ninsects, the advantages of letting them run at large more than make up\r\nfor lower production. Also the production is normal and can be easily\r\nmaintained from year to year in the same line of stock, while high\r\nproduction secured by extra care is forced and can be maintained in the\r\nsame line of stock for only a few generations. A flock of one hundred\r\nfowls or less, that run together, may all be kept in one house just as\r\nwell as in several, if the size of the house and the equipment are in\r\nproportion to the size of the flock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 83. Rude poultry house on a Kansas farm. (Photograph\r\nfrom Bureau of Animal Industry, United States Department of\r\nAgriculture)]\r\n\r\nIf the snow lies long on the ground, so that the fowls are confined to\r\nthe house much of the time in winter, the allowance of floor space\r\nshould be about 5 sq. ft. per bird. Where the snow rarely lies more than\r\na day or two at a time, less space may be given, because the birds will\r\nnot occupy the house much of the time during the day. Under such\r\nconditions the allowance of floor space may be as low as 3 sq. ft. per\r\nbird. Those who go to this limit, however, should consider that, in the\r\nunusual case of a snowstorm keeping the hens confined to the house for\r\nmore than a very few days, overcrowding may cause losses that more than\r\noffset what was gained by using the highest capacity of the house.\r\n\r\nUsually a flock of fifty hens needs a house with a floor surface of\r\nabout 250 sq. ft. This is obtained in a house 16 ft. square or in a\r\nhouse 12 ft. x 24 ft. A house 20 ft. square is about right for\r\nseventy-five or eighty hens, and is not badly overcrowded if one hundred\r\nmedium-sized birds are put into it. If an oblong building is preferred,\r\na house 12 ft. wide by 42 ft. long gives one hundred birds 5 sq. ft. of\r\nfloor space per bird. Houses of such size should be from 4 ft. to 7 ft.\r\nhigh at the sides, and from 7 ft. to 10 ft. high at the highest point of\r\nthe roof, according to the style of construction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 84. Good poultry house on a Kansas farm. (Photograph\r\nfrom Bureau of Animal Industry, United States Department of\r\nAgriculture)]\r\n\r\n=Feeding.= In the feeding of a farm flock the first thing to consider is\r\nwhat the birds can pick up by foraging. The poultry keeper on a farm,\r\neven more than the poultry keeper elsewhere, should make it a rule to do\r\nnothing for poultry that they can do for themselves. Fowls can do more\r\nfor themselves at some seasons than at others, because natural food is\r\nmore abundant. As fowls do not usually go very far from their house, the\r\nlarger the flock the less food each bird will secure. On some farms\r\nquite a large flock of fowls can get all the food they need about the\r\nbarns and stockyards and in orchards and fields near the homestead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 85. Poultry house at Mississippi Agricultural\r\nCollege.[10] (Photograph from the college)]\r\n\r\n[10] In this house the part of the rear wall above the roost platform is\r\nmade to open wide, thus affording perfect ventilation in summer.\r\n\r\nWhen the conditions are such that it may reasonably be supposed that the\r\nfowls can get all the food they require without going farther than fowls\r\nusually wander, the best way to determine whether this supposition is\r\ncorrect is to give them no food until evening, then throw out a little\r\ngrain and see how much they will eat. If it appears that they need to be\r\nfed a considerable quantity, it is better to give a light feed in the\r\nmorning and another in the evening than to give a heavy feed once a day,\r\nbecause if they learn to expect a full feed at a regular time, they will\r\nnot forage so well. Fowls that have an opportunity to secure\r\nconsiderable food by foraging should never be fed so much in the\r\nmorning that they will sit around for hours. When hens on a farm need\r\nonly one or two light feeds a day, whatever grain is most convenient may\r\nbe given them. Where they get so much exercise and a good variety of\r\nother foods, whole corn is as good as anything. A good way to feed it is\r\nto break the ears into short pieces and let the birds pick the grain\r\nfrom the cob.\r\n\r\nIn winter the feeding of the farm flock should have more attention,\r\nespecially if little food can be secured around the stables and\r\nstockyards. It is a good plan to give, once a day, a warm mash made of 1\r\npart (by measure) of corn meal and 2 parts of bran, and to give as much\r\ngrain at one other feeding as the hens will eat. Some farmers use sheaf\r\noats for litter in the floors of their poultry houses, throwing in a\r\nsheaf or two as often as is necessary to keep a good depth of litter on\r\nthe floor, and then give as much corn in addition as the hens will eat\r\nreadily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 86. Open-front house with hood. (Photograph from\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, Victoria, British Columbia)]\r\n\r\nIf it is not convenient to make a mash, what grain the fowls will eat\r\nquickly from a trough may be prepared for a warm breakfast for them by\r\npouring boiling water on it in the evening and letting it soak\r\novernight. Any of the small grains and cracked corn may be fed in this\r\nway; whole corn needs longer soaking. In hard, freezing weather no more\r\nmash or soaked grain should be given than the fowls will eat before it\r\ncan freeze. A favorite old-time practice still used on many farms is to\r\nheat shelled corn in the oven and feed it while warm.\r\n\r\nThe best vegetable foods for fowls in winter are cabbages and\r\nmangel-wurzels. The cabbages can be hung up by the roots and the fowls\r\nwill eat all but the stump. The most convenient way to feed the beets\r\nis to split them and impale the pieces on spikes in the wall at a\r\nconvenient distance from the floor. Sound, sweet turnips are also good,\r\nbut bitter turnips and those that have begun to spoil are likely to give\r\nan unpleasant flavor to the eggs. A little freezing does not seem to\r\naffect the value of these vegetables for poultry food, and the birds\r\nwill usually eat them when frozen. The quantity fed at one time,\r\nhowever, should not be so large that it may freeze and thaw several\r\ntimes before it is all eaten.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 87. Movable poultry house on United States\r\nGovernment farm, Beltsville, Maryland. (Photograph from Bureau of Animal\r\nIndustry)]\r\n\r\nWhen hogs and cattle are killed on a farm, the blood and other offal,\r\nand the small trimmings when the carcasses are cut up, should be saved\r\nand fed to the fowls regularly in moderate quantities, but care should\r\nbe taken not to leave fat trimmings where the fowls can help themselves,\r\nfor if fowls have been short of animal food, they eat meat very\r\ngreedily and are often made sick by it. Blood and lean meat are not\r\nvery injurious, but too much fat meat has very bad effects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 88. The upper shutter is closed only at night in\r\nextreme cold weather]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 89. Lower part of front open for hot weather]\r\n\r\nANOTHER STYLE OF MOVABLE HOUSE AT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FARM,\r\nBELTSVILLE, MARYLAND. (Photograph from Bureau of Animal Industry)\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to give the fowls water when there is snow on the\r\nground. Delicate fowls that are accustomed to close confinement may not\r\nbe able to stand running out on the snow, but if they have a comfortable\r\nhouse, with a good supply of litter on the floor, and are free to go and\r\ncome at will, rugged birds that are out in all kinds of weather are not\r\nin the least hurt by going out on snow and ice and wet ground in cold\r\nweather, and will usually take snow in preference to water when they can\r\nget it. When the ground is bare and frozen, water or finely chipped ice\r\nshould be supplied. In extreme cold weather the latter is better,\r\nbecause the water soon freezes and the fowls go thirsty until a fresh\r\nsupply is given them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 90. Barred Plymouth Rock hen with Light Brahma\r\nchicks]\r\n\r\n=Reproducing the flock.= Fowls are short-lived creatures. They mature in\r\nless than a year; their period of greatest productiveness is usually\r\nover before they are two years old, and only a very small proportion of\r\na flock are worth keeping after that. Hence the entire stock of fowls on\r\na farm is renewed in two years. Most farmers intend to kill off all\r\ntheir two-year-old hens each year, thus keeping up the number in the\r\nflock by growing annually about as many young birds as there are hens in\r\nthe flock. To allow for losses, for an excess of males, and for inferior\r\npullets which are not worth keeping for layers, it is necessary to hatch\r\nabout four times as many chickens as are to be reserved.\r\n\r\n=The hatching season.= Most of the chickens reared on farms are hatched\r\nin the spring months. The late-hatched chickens are nearly all from hens\r\nthat steal their nests. People on farms do not want late chickens; among\r\nso many larger ones a few small birds have very little chance to make\r\ngood growth. But those who have a place to keep a few early chickens and\r\ntime to take care of them often set a few hens in the winter. Eggs will\r\nhatch at any season of the year, and chickens will grow if they get\r\nproper care; but there is a comparatively short season in the spring\r\nwhen eggs hatch better and chickens grow better than at any other time,\r\nand the easiest way to get a given number of good chickens that will be\r\nfull-grown at the beginning of winter is to hatch them in this natural\r\nhatching season. This season cannot be exactly defined, because it\r\nvaries according to latitude and also from year to year according to the\r\nweather. Perhaps the best general rule is to have the first chicks hatch\r\nwhen the grass is beginning to grow. To effect this the hens must be set\r\nthree weeks earlier, when there may be no signs of spring. No one can\r\ntime hatches to a natural phenomenon of this kind with certainty, but by\r\nplanning with reference to the advance of spring in a normal season, the\r\nfirst hatches are usually brought very near to the desired time.\r\n\r\n=Broody hens.= When a hen wants to incubate eggs, or, as the common\r\nphrase is, to sit, she remains on her nest continuously and, unless very\r\nshy, will not leave it when approached and will resent any interference.\r\nThe hen is then said to be broody. Because the broody hen makes a\r\nclucking noise, she is sometimes called a clucking hen. Hens that are\r\nshy when they begin to cluck, and that fly from the nest when\r\napproached, usually become tame and allow themselves to be handled after\r\na few days. Broody hens cannot always be obtained at the time they are\r\nwanted. In that case there is nothing to do but wait, or try to buy,\r\nhire, or borrow them. There is no way of forcing or inducing hens to\r\nbecome broody before they would do so of their own accord. When broody\r\nhens are hard to get, people think that hatching with incubators will\r\nrelieve them of trouble and prevent delay, but the incubator, too, has\r\nits uncertainties. Success in artificial hatching requires careful\r\nattention to the operation of the incubator and good judgment in\r\nadjusting and regulating it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 91. Nest boxes, made in pairs, for sitting hens.\r\nInside dimensions: large, 16\" x 16\" x 18\"; small, 12\" x 12\" x 15\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 92. Same as Fig. 91, with nest boxes closed]\r\n\r\n=Setting the hens.= As many broody hens as can be obtained should be set\r\nat the same time. The most convenient style of nest is that shown in\r\nFigs. 91 and 92, which can be kept closed if desired. The best nest\r\nmaterial is soft hay or straw. In preparing the nest a poultry keeper\r\nshapes the nest material with his hand, to give it a bowl shape,\r\npressing it down to make a smooth, firm surface upon which the eggs will\r\nlie evenly. It is a good plan to make the nests and place the hens in\r\nthem, giving to each a few China nest eggs two or three days before the\r\neggs that are to be hatched are given to them. The eggs for hatching\r\nshould be of good size and shape, with good strong shells, and as\r\nuniform in color as can be obtained. The usual number of eggs placed\r\nunder a hen is thirteen. After the weather becomes warm, even a small\r\nhen will cover thirteen eggs well, and medium-sized hens will cover\r\nfifteen or sixteen eggs and often hatch every one, but early in the\r\nseason it is better to give a hen eleven eggs or perhaps only nine. The\r\nnumber of eggs given a hen is almost always an odd number. There is an\r\nold superstition that an even number will not hatch. The reason commonly\r\ngiven by writers on poultry is that an odd number of eggs arrange in\r\nbetter form in the nest, but this is mere fancy. However the practice\r\nstarted, the real reason why odd numbers of eggs are placed in nests of\r\nsitting hens now is that the custom is so well established, and the\r\nhabit of thinking of eggs for hatching in odd numbers is so strong, that\r\nmost poultry keepers do it unconsciously.\r\n\r\n=Care of sitting hens.= The best food for sitting hens is whole corn. As\r\nthe hen will leave the nest only once a day, and not always daily unless\r\nremoved, the food is given in a vessel from which she can eat it\r\nreadily. The usual way is to keep a supply where the hens are, so that\r\nwhenever they leave the nest they can get something to eat. Whether to\r\nlet them choose their own time to leave the nest or to keep the nests\r\nclosed except when they are let off at a regular time each day is a\r\npoint to be determined in each case according to the circumstances. If\r\nall the hens in the same place are quiet and get along well together and\r\ndo not quarrel for the possession of particular nests, they may be left\r\nvery much to themselves; otherwise the poultry keeper should regulate\r\nthings so that there will be no quarreling and no danger of a nest of\r\neggs getting cold while two hens crowd on another nest and break some of\r\nthe eggs in it.\r\n\r\nBesides grain the hens need water and a place to dust. Most sitting hens\r\nwill dust themselves every time they leave the nest, if they have an\r\nopportunity to do so. As lice multiply rapidly on sitting hens, it is a\r\ngood idea, even when the hen can dust herself, to apply an insect powder\r\nto her and to the nest two or three times during the period of\r\nincubation.\r\n\r\nThe eggs may be tested at the end of the seventh day by using a light,\r\nas described on page 21. While fertility can be determined earlier,\r\nwaiting until the seventh day enables one to tell more surely whether\r\nfertility is strong or weak, and to discard weak germs as well as\r\ninfertile eggs. An infertile egg is clear, that is, shows no signs of\r\ndevelopment or decay, at every period of incubation. The eggs that rot\r\nare fertile eggs in which the germs have died. A rotten egg is\r\ndistinguished from a fertile egg through the tester by the movement of\r\nthe line between the transparent air space at the large end of the egg\r\nand the dark contents, this movement showing that the contents are in a\r\nfluid state. The eggs which are the most opaque and have the air space\r\nmost distinctly marked are those which have the strongest germs. Eggs\r\nthat are conspicuously light-colored (as they appear before the light)\r\nwhen compared with these may as well be discarded. If many eggs are\r\ndiscarded, those that remain may be given to a part of the hens, and the\r\nrest of the hens reset.\r\n\r\n=Attention at hatching time.= The eggs of medium-sized fowls usually\r\nhatch in from twenty to twenty-one days. The eggs of small fowls take\r\nabout a day less, and those of large fowls about a day more. Hens' eggs\r\nhave been known to hatch as early as the seventeenth day and as late as\r\nthe twenty-fourth, but as a rule chickens that come before the\r\nnineteenth day or after the twenty-second are weakly. Hens sometimes\r\ntrample the chickens in the nests or crush the eggs after they are\r\npicked, so that the chicken cannot turn to break the shell in the\r\nregular manner. Sometimes this is due to the nervousness or to the\r\nclumsiness of the hen, but oftener it is caused by the nest being too\r\nmuch dished (that is, hollowed so much that the eggs tend to roll toward\r\nthe center) or by lice disturbing her. The chickens may be saved either\r\nby removing them to other broody hens or by putting them in a flannel\r\nwrapping in a warm place. Unless, however, the conditions are bad, it is\r\nbetter to leave them with the hen. Hens with little chicks should be\r\nleft in the nests until all the eggs that will hatch have hatched and\r\nthe chicks are dry and begin to show an inclination to run about. Then,\r\nif the weather is fine, the hen and her brood may be taken at once to a\r\ncoop out of doors, but if it is cold or stormy, the little chicks are\r\nbetter indoors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 93. Coop for hen and chicks, to be used without run]\r\n\r\n=Coops for broods.= The coop for a hen and chickens should be so\r\nconstructed that they will have plenty of fresh air at night. There\r\nshould be a small run attached to it, to which the hen can be confined\r\nwhile the chickens run about or come to her to be brooded, as they may\r\nwish. It is not a good plan to let a hen run with her brood while the\r\nchicks are very small. The chickens do much better if the mother is\r\nconfined and gives more attention to keeping them warm than to feeding\r\nthem. The coops should not be placed in the same spot year after year,\r\nnor should they be on land upon which the old fowls run during any\r\nconsiderable portion of the year. Sod ground is best.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 94. Coop to be used with runs, as in Fig. 95]\r\n\r\n=Feeding young chickens.= From early times in America the most common\r\nfood for young chickens has been corn meal moistened with water. When\r\nfresh this is a good food for chickens that run about and eat a great\r\ndeal of green food, insects, worms, and small seeds, but a mash of\r\nscalded corn meal and bran, such as is given old fowls, or a baked\r\njohnnycake, is better. There is no need of fussing with such foods as\r\nfinely chopped hard-boiled eggs, cracker crumbs, pinhead oatmeal, and\r\nother things often recommended as most appropriate for the first feeds\r\nof little chicks. Healthy hen-hatched chicks raised by the natural\r\nmethod on a farm need nothing but one soft feed (such as has been\r\nmentioned) in the morning, a little hard grain toward evening, and then,\r\njust before dark, all the soft food they will eat. The best grain for\r\nthem is sound cracked corn; the next best is wheat. The chickens should\r\nhave good water always before them, and may be given all the milk they\r\nwant. Skim milk, sour milk (either thin or clabbered), and buttermilk\r\nare all eaten with relish and promote health and growth. Vessels in\r\nwhich milk is given must be cleaned often or they will become very\r\nfilthy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 95. Coops and runs for hens and chicks[11]]\r\n\r\n[11] Burlap bags are used to shade the interior or to keep out rain.\r\nWhen not in use they are turned back on the top of the coop.\r\n\r\n=Management of growing chicks.= Of course, healthy chickens are growing\r\nall the time, and growing at a very rapid rate, too; but after the\r\nchicks are weaned, they have usually reached the point in growth when\r\nthe increase in size in a short period is very noticeable. So poultry\r\nkeepers commonly speak of chickens from weaning time until maturity as\r\ngrowing chicks. At this time the rudest kind of shelter will suit them\r\nas well as any. Indeed, they hardly need shelter from the weather at\r\nall. The most essential things are a good range, apart from the old\r\nfowls, and an abundance of food. They should be able to pick up a great\r\ndeal of food for themselves, but should have enough given them to make\r\nsure that they always have all the food they can eat. It does not pay to\r\nstint them to make them forage farther. Young chickens will always take\r\nall the exercise that they need if they have the opportunity, and the\r\nmore they eat the better they grow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 96. Small house for growing chicks, in Maine\r\norchard]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 97. Small house for growing chicks, in orchard in\r\nNew York State]\r\n\r\nWhen the range near their coops ceases to afford them good picking, the\r\ncoops should be moved to a place where the food to be secured by\r\nforaging is more abundant.\r\n\r\n\r\nLARGE STOCKS ON GENERAL FARMS\r\n\r\nWhen farmers in America began to keep larger stocks of fowls, the most\r\ncommon practice nearly everywhere was to increase the general flock\r\nuntil there were far too many fowls on the land that they would usually\r\nforage over. Under such conditions fowls on the farm were not\r\nprofitable. They damaged every crop to which they had access, and made\r\nthe farm most unsightly in the vicinity of the dwelling house. Then some\r\nfarmers would reduce the flock and return to the old practice of keeping\r\nonly a few dozen hens, while others would adopt the city plan of\r\nbuilding houses with many compartments and keeping the fowls yarded in\r\nsmall flocks. This plan was usually abandoned within a few years,\r\nbecause, while it worked very well in the winter, when the farmer had\r\ntime to give the hens extra care, they were not as well off in the\r\nsummer, when the farmer had to give attention to his field crops first.\r\nSuch was the usual course of development of farm methods of managing\r\nfowls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 98. Stone poultry house about two hundred years old,\r\non farm of F. W. C. Almy, Tiverton Four Corners, Rhode Island]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 99. Rhode Island colony poultry house for\r\nthirty-five fowls]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 100. Colony poultry houses on Rhode Island farm]\r\n\r\n=The colony system.= But occasionally a farmer whose flock had outgrown\r\nits accommodations as one flock would divide it, moving a part to\r\nanother place on the farm, and so was able to maintain the increase in\r\nnumbers without adopting laborious methods. This idea was carried out\r\nmost systematically and most extensively in the vicinity of Little\r\nCompton, Rhode Island, where the Rhode Island Red fowl originated. The\r\nfirst settlers in this part of Rhode Island built large stone poultry\r\nhouses like that shown in Fig. 98. Some of these old buildings are still\r\nused for poultry. This district is most favorably situated for poultry\r\nkeeping. The snow rarely lies long, and the birds can be outdoors nearly\r\nevery day in winter as well as in summer. Being near the fashionable\r\nsummer resort of Newport, the farmers here early found a large demand\r\nfor their eggs and poultry at high prices in the summer time, when in\r\nmany places the prices were low. Then in the winter they could send eggs\r\nto Boston and Providence, which were the best markets in the country for\r\nthis class of produce. So these farmers had every inducement to devise a\r\npractical method of indefinitely increasing their stocks of fowls. The\r\nplan which they adopted was very simple. Small houses, which could\r\neasily be moved from place to place with a two-horse team, and which\r\nwould accommodate from twenty-five to thirty-five fowls, were made and\r\ndistributed over the farm. Sometimes these houses were placed in\r\npastures not suitable for mowing or for cultivation and remained there\r\npermanently, but as a rule they were moved from time to time to suit the\r\nrotation of crops on the farm. As the number of these houses on a farm\r\nincreased, and they were spread over a larger area and sometimes placed\r\nin fields and pastures a long distance from the farmhouse, the work of\r\ncaring for the fowls, even by the simple method used, became too heavy\r\nto be done by man power alone, and a horse and cart was used in carrying\r\nfood and water, collecting eggs, and moving chicks and fowls from one\r\npart of the farm to another. Thus the work was put on a very economical\r\nbasis, and keeping fowls by this method became a common feature of the\r\nfarming of this section of Rhode Island. The methods used here have\r\nchanged little, if at all, since the system was started sixty or seventy\r\nyears ago. The system is so primitive that people who are familiar with\r\nmore elaborate methods often imagine that the Rhode Island farmer, who\r\ndoes so well by his simple methods, would certainly do very much better\r\nif he applied more of the modern ideas. But the test of time has\r\ndemonstrated that this simple colony system is easily made permanent,\r\nwhile most of the more ambitious and complex systems either fail utterly\r\nor have but a transient success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 101. Collecting eggs on Rhode Island farm. The\r\nlittle girl is in the box in which dough is carried in the morning]\r\n\r\n=Numbers of hens kept.= The number of hens kept on a farm in this\r\nsection varies from four or five hundred to over two thousand. Stocks of\r\nfrom eight hundred to twelve hundred are most common. The principal\r\nobject is to produce market eggs, but as the two-year-old hens and the\r\ncockerels that are not needed for breeding purposes are sold every year,\r\nthe receipts from the sale of live poultry are sometimes considerable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 102. Colony houses at Michigan Agricultural College.\r\n(Photograph from the college)]\r\n\r\n=Feeding, care, and results.= The hens, being well distributed over the\r\nfarm, pick a large part of their living. Hard grain (usually cracked\r\ncorn) is kept always before them in the house, in hoppers which will\r\nhold a bag of grain each. Once a day, in the morning, the hens are given\r\na feed of mash (or, as it is called in this locality, dough) of about\r\nthe same composition as the mash described on page 89. The dough is\r\ncooked in a large iron set-kettle in the evening and left there until it\r\nis to be fed the next morning. Then it is loaded into boxes or large\r\ntubs on a cart. The cart also carries a barrel of water. As he reaches\r\neach house the driver, with a shovel, throws what dough the hens need on\r\nthe grass near the house. Then he fills the water pail and drives on to\r\nthe next house. The hens require no more attention until evening, when\r\nthe man collects the eggs and gives more water where it is necessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 103. Moving one of the houses in Fig. 102]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 104. Colony houses at Iowa Agricultural College.\r\n(Photograph from the college)]\r\n\r\nSome of the smaller stocks of fowls on these farms--flocks that have\r\nbeen selected with care and are given a little more attention than is\r\nusual--give an average annual production of eleven or twelve dozen eggs\r\na hen, but the general average is only eight or nine dozen. Although the\r\nprofit per hen is small, the compensation for labor and investment is\r\nbetter than on most poultry plants where a much greater product per hen\r\nis secured. Even when eggs are the most important money crop on the\r\nfarm, the care of the laying hens is but a small part of the day's work\r\nof the man who looks after them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 105. Colony houses at Hampton Institute]\r\n\r\n=How the chickens are grown.= The number of chickens reared each year on\r\none of these colony farms is usually about equal to the number of fowls\r\nkept. Where there are so many hens of a sitting variety, and very early\r\nhatching is not practiced, there is rarely any shortage of sitting hens\r\nat the time when they are wanted. Usually twenty or thirty hens are set\r\nat the same time, and it is expected that they will hatch eight or ten\r\nchickens each. Sometimes sixty or seventy hens are set at one time. As\r\nit is almost always quite warm when the chickens are hatched, it is\r\ncustomary to give each hen twenty or more chickens. The coops are placed\r\nin rows, several rods apart each way, on a piece of grassland that has\r\nhad no poultry on it for a year or more. Most of the farmers are very\r\nparticular on this point, and prefer to put the young chickens on land\r\non which there has been no poultry for at least two years. They have\r\nlearned by experience that under such conditions they can rear a much\r\nlarger percentage of the chickens hatched, and that the chickens will\r\ngrow more evenly and mature earlier. In planning the field crops grown\r\non the farm they always try to arrange so that the small chickens may\r\nhave fresh land not too far from the farmhouse; land seeded to grass the\r\nyear before is best.\r\n\r\nThe chickens are fed the same dough as is given to the hens, but are fed\r\noftener. They have a second meal of dough about noon, and their grain\r\nsupply, which is given in small troughs, is replenished frequently.\r\nWhile the hens are with the chickens the food is placed where the hen\r\nconfined to the coop can get her share. After the hens are taken away,\r\nthe dough is thrown on the grass as the cart passes up and down the rows\r\nof coops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 106. Coop for hen and chicks, used on Rhode Island\r\nfarm]\r\n\r\nWhen the hay has been harvested and the corn has grown tall, a part of\r\nthe young chickens may be removed from the land where they were started,\r\nand the coops placed where they can forage on mowing lands, in\r\ncornfields, and wherever they can go without damage to a growing crop.\r\nAs they become too crowded in the small coops, the cockerels are sold\r\nand, if there are still too many birds in a coop, a few pullets are\r\ntaken from each of the overcrowded coops and new colonies are started,\r\nso far from their old associates that they will not find their way back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 107. Colony house for growing chicks, at Macdonald\r\nCollege. (Photograph from the college)]\r\n\r\nIn the early fall as many of the oldest hens are sold as is necessary to\r\nvacate the houses needed for the pullets reared that season. Then the\r\nhouses are thoroughly cleaned. (They may not have been cleaned before\r\nfor six months or a year.) If a house is to be moved to a new location,\r\nthe change is usually made at this time. One or two cartloads of clean\r\nsand are put into each house, to make the floor higher than the ground\r\noutside and to provide an absorbent for the droppings which are allowed\r\nto accumulate. When they are brought to the house, which will probably\r\nbe their home as long as they live, the pullets are confined to the\r\nhouse, or a small temporary yard is attached to it, so that they cannot\r\nwander away. After a few days of confinement they accept the new home as\r\ntheir headquarters.\r\n\r\n=Adaptability of the colony system.= The colony system as developed in\r\nRhode Island attracted little attention elsewhere until very recent\r\nyears. Since about 1900 many descriptions of it have been published, and\r\nnumerous efforts have been made to adapt features of this system to\r\noperations in other localities. The principal obstacles to this are snow\r\nand predacious animals. Where snow lies deep for months it is not\r\npractical to keep fowls in widely distributed flocks in winter. In some\r\nplaces the plan of distributing the houses in summer and parking them\r\n(that is, placing them close together in a regular order) in winter has\r\nworked very well. Where wild animals are numerous, colony methods cannot\r\nbe extensively applied, but on most farms a limited application of the\r\nsystem will greatly increase the amount of poultry that can profitably\r\nbe kept.\r\n\r\nIn England many farmers use smaller colony houses than those in use in\r\nRhode Island, and move them often, not letting a house stand in the same\r\nspot long enough to kill the grass. Some of the houses used in this way\r\nare provided with small wheels. The advantage of moving houses often is\r\ngreatest when the fowls are on good arable land, upon which there are,\r\nor will be, crops that can utilize the manure which the birds leave on\r\nthe land. If the houses are moved methodically, the fertilizer will be\r\nevenly distributed.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTENSIVE POULTRY FARMS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 108. Colony houses in foreground; sheds for ducks\r\nbeyond. (Photograph from Bureau of Animal Industry, United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture)]\r\n\r\n=Reasons for concentration.= In the early days of the poultry fancy in\r\nthis country the tendency was for each fancier to keep as many different\r\nvarieties as he could find room for or could afford to buy. Most of\r\nthese fanciers were city people who thought that, as they kept their\r\nfowls in small flocks anyway, they might just as well have as many\r\ndifferent kinds of poultry as they had separate compartments in their\r\npoultry yards. When rich men with large estates became interested in\r\nfancy poultry, they usually built large houses containing many small\r\npens, each with its small yard, and bought a few of each known variety.\r\nBy far the greater part of the choicest poultry was kept in small\r\ninclosures, and the flocks that laid remarkably well were usually city\r\nflocks that were given good care. This seemed to a great many people to\r\nprove that fowls did not need the room and the freedom which for ages\r\nthey had enjoyed on farms, and that the limit of the possible extension\r\nof the city method of keeping fowls in small, bare yards depended in\r\nany case upon the business capacity of the poultry keeper.\r\n\r\n=Concentration not profitable.= Very few people who have not had\r\nexperience in growing large numbers of poultry under both good and bad\r\nconditions can be made to understand how futile industry and business\r\nmethods are when many other things which affect results are unfavorable.\r\nEven when the obstacles to the application of intensive methods on a\r\nlarge scale are pointed out to them, most novices imagine that the\r\ndifficulties are exaggerated for the purpose of discouraging them. They\r\nthink that the successful poultry keeper wishes to discourage\r\ncompetition, and that the person who has failed does not want to see any\r\none else succeed, and so warns others to let such projects alone. Those\r\nwho have been very successful in their first efforts in a small way\r\nseldom lack perfect confidence in their ability to make good on any\r\nscale if once they are in a position to devote themselves entirely to\r\nthis work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 109. Commercial laying house at New Jersey\r\nExperiment Station. (Photograph from the station)]\r\n\r\nFor some seventy or eighty years, but more especially for the last\r\nthirty or forty years, the most conspicuous phase of the poultry\r\nindustry in America has been the widespread and continuous movement to\r\ndevelop large plants of this character. There has been no time, for a\r\nquarter of a century, when poultry plants of this kind, which to the\r\nuninitiated appeared to be highly profitable, have not been numerous.\r\nThe owners of many of these plants have claimed that they were making\r\nvery large profits, and their claims have led others to engage in the\r\nbusiness, following in every detail the methods in use on some large\r\nplant which they suppose is very successful. So, while well-informed\r\npoultry keepers know that these methods are not practical on a large\r\nscale, except in a few limited lines of production, there is in the\r\nbusiness a constant succession of newcomers who try to operate egg farms\r\nand breeding farms and combinations of various lines by methods that are\r\nnot suited to their purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 110. Interior of a compartment in commercial poultry\r\nhouse, United States Government farm, Beltsville, Maryland. (Photograph\r\nfrom Bureau of Animal Industry)]\r\n\r\n=Common type of intensive poultry farm.= The ordinary special poultry\r\nfarm is a run-down farm upon which have been erected the buildings\r\nnecessary for the accommodation of from four or five hundred to two or\r\nthree thousand fowls kept in comparatively small yards. The buildings\r\nare nearly always neat and substantial, the fences strong and durable.\r\nThe arrangement of the plant is orderly, and, when well stocked with\r\nfowls and kept clean, it presents a most attractive appearance. The\r\nhouses and yards for adult stock, the incubator cellar and the brooder\r\nhouses, the barns and sheds, and the dwelling of the owner or manager\r\noccupy but a very small part of the farm--usually from one to three\r\nacres. The young chickens are grown year after year on the nearest land\r\nnot occupied by the permanent buildings and yards. In most cases the\r\nland is so heavily stocked with them that they secure almost nothing by\r\nforaging.\r\n\r\nThe routine of work on such a farm is very exacting. The fowls can do so\r\nlittle for themselves and require so much extra care that the poultry\r\nkeeper knows from the start that he cannot make his business pay unless\r\nhe gets a very high production. So all his efforts are devoted to this\r\nend. He uses labor-saving appliances, carefully systematizes his work,\r\nand by great effort often succeeds in making a fair profit for a few\r\nyears. It is at this stage of his progress that the poultry keeper of\r\nthis class does the boasting which misleads others. Then things begin to\r\ngo wrong with his stock. His eggs do not hatch well, because his\r\nchickens, while nominally on free range on a farm, have really been no\r\nbetter off than chickens reared under ordinary conditions in town. His\r\nchickens do not thrive, because they are weak and the land is tainted.\r\nHe himself is worn out with long hours of work and no holidays, and if\r\nhe does not realize his mistake and close out the business in time, it\r\nis only a question of continuing until his income and credit combined no\r\nlonger suffice to keep the business going.\r\n\r\nThis in brief has been the history of all special poultry farms where\r\nintensive methods were used, except the duck farms and the several\r\nclasses to be described farther on in this chapter. By no means all\r\nsucceed to even the extent described, because a great many people who go\r\ninto the business have so little capital that they have to give up the\r\nbusiness before they have been able to make it show a profit. When the\r\nowners have capital, plants are sometimes operated for years at a loss,\r\nbut it is very rare indeed that a poultry farm of this kind (except in\r\nthe classes to be described later) is continued for more than seven or\r\neight years, and few of them last five years. Those who wish to make a\r\npoultry business permanent must adopt other methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROILER GROWING\r\n\r\nThe desire for what is rare and costly is a common trait in human\r\ncharacter. In nothing is it more plainly displayed than in the demand\r\nfor food products out of their natural season. An article which in its\r\nseason of abundance is a staple article of diet, within the means of all\r\nbut the very poorest, at its season of scarcity becomes a luxury which\r\nonly the wealthy can afford.\r\n\r\nBefore cold-storage methods had been brought to high efficiency, there\r\nwas a period in the latter part of the winter and the early spring when\r\nyoung chickens were very scarce. The number that could be hatched with\r\nhens to meet a demand at this season was small, and those who were\r\nhatching autumn and winter chickens by the natural method found it more\r\nprofitable to keep them to sell as roasters late in the spring and early\r\nin the summer.\r\n\r\n=The \"broiler craze.\"= A little before 1890, artificial incubators being\r\nthen first brought to a perfection which made them popular, some poultry\r\nkeepers began to hatch chickens in the winter to meet the demand for\r\nearly broilers. Those who were successful made a very good profit on\r\nwhat chickens they had ready to sell while the prices were high. Most of\r\nthem operated in a very small way, taking up this work simply for\r\noccupation when they had nothing else to do. Many were gardeners who had\r\njust about enough slack time, after the harvest of one year was over, to\r\nhatch and grow one lot of broilers before beginning their regular spring\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThese people were not under any delusions about the limitations on this\r\nline of production. They knew that the demand for very small chickens at\r\nvery high prices was limited and easily satisfied. But, as usual, the\r\npublished accounts of what they were doing set a great many people to\r\nfiguring the possibilities of profit from such a business conducted on a\r\nlarge scale. For a few years the broiler craze affected nearly every one\r\ninterested in poultry keeping. Thousands who never engaged in it were\r\nrestrained only because of lack of capital or inability to adapt it to\r\ntheir circumstances. Many people who had been through several\r\nunsatisfactory ventures in poultry keeping thought that they saw in this\r\nthe one sure road to wealth, and began to make plans to grow broilers in\r\nlarge quantities. Besides these business ventures there were countless\r\nsmall ones, sometimes conducted under the most unsuitable conditions.\r\nPeople tried to grow broilers in living rooms, in attics, in all sorts\r\nof unheated outbuildings, and in house cellars to which the daylight\r\nhardly penetrated.\r\n\r\n=Present condition of broiler growing.= The production of broilers as a\r\nspecialty did not last long. The improvement in cold-storage methods\r\nsoon made it possible for speculators to carry over large quantities of\r\nsummer chickens, and the poultry keepers in other lines could easily\r\narrange to produce all the fresh broilers that could be sold at a good\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\n\r\nROASTER GROWING\r\n\r\n=Description of a good roaster.= To roast nicely, a fowl must be\r\nfull-grown and well filled out, but young, soft-meated, and fat. A fowl\r\nis \"ripe\" for a choice roaster for only a short period after arriving at\r\nmaturity. When a pullet has laid a few eggs, her flesh becomes harder\r\nand is never again as tender and juicy as it was before she laid an egg.\r\nWhen the spurs of a cockerel begin to harden and to grow a long, sharp\r\npoint, and the bird becomes boisterous and quarrelsome, the flesh\r\nbecomes dry and tough and is not fit for roasting.\r\n\r\n=General and special supplies.= From July, when the earliest farm\r\nchickens are large enough for roasting, until about the first of\r\nFebruary, when the last of the late-hatched farm chickens disappear from\r\nthe markets, there are nearly always enough very good roasting chickens\r\nin the general market receipts to supply the demand for that class and\r\ngrade of poultry. Then for four or five months there are no fresh\r\nroasting chickens on the market except those grown especially for this\r\ntrade. This line of poultry culture was developed first near\r\nPhiladelphia, in southern New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania, about\r\nforty years ago. The chickens were hatched with hens in the autumn and\r\nearly winter, each grower having only a few hundred. They were sold not\r\nonly in Philadelphia but in New York and Boston, and in smaller Eastern\r\ncities where there was a demand for them. They were, and still are,\r\ncommonly known as Philadelphia chickens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 111. Massachusetts soft-roaster plant]\r\n\r\n=Large roaster plants.= After incubators came into common use, the\r\nproduction of Philadelphia chickens increased, but a more remarkable\r\ndevelopment of that line of production took place in Plymouth County,\r\nMassachusetts, just about the time the broiler craze started. The\r\ngrowing of winter chickens had been carried on to some extent in\r\nsouthern New England in the same way as in the vicinity of Philadelphia,\r\nbut the local supply was small and irregular until artificial methods\r\nwere adopted. Then, quite suddenly, the industry developed extensively\r\nin the vicinity of Norwell, Hanover, and Rockland. Its growth was\r\nremarkable, both because of the number of people who were successful on\r\na comparatively large scale, and because it attracted almost no\r\nattention outside of this district until long after it had become a\r\nwell-established local industry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 112. Incubator cellar]\r\n\r\nThe methods of the roaster growers in this district are very intensive,\r\nbut as originally developed their business was not a continuous line of\r\nintensive poultry culture, nor is it continuous now except in some\r\ncases. For many years after the business began, the growers bought the\r\neggs that they incubated from farmers whose flocks were kept under good\r\nconditions and were strong and vigorous; but as the numbers engaged in\r\ngrowing winter chickens increased, the supply of eggs from the farms was\r\nnot sufficient, and some of the roaster growers began to keep hens to\r\nsupply a part of the eggs they used. Later some produced all the eggs\r\nfor hatching that they needed for their own use, and a few sold to\r\nothers also. This, however, can be done only by those having quite large\r\nfarms. Some of the most successful growers have only a few acres of land\r\nand do not attempt to keep breeding fowls.\r\n\r\nHatching begins in August or September and is continued until all the\r\nchickens that can be handled are hatched. If the eggs hatch well from\r\nthe start, a large grower may have his houses full by December, but\r\nusually it takes until January to complete hatching, and sometimes it\r\ntakes longer. The price paid for eggs for hatching is only a little\r\nabove the price of market eggs, and the buyer takes all the risks of\r\npoor hatches. The chickens are kept in warm brooder houses as long as\r\nthey need artificial heat, then they are removed to cold brooder houses\r\nof the same type or to colony houses. Those who have land enough use\r\nmostly colony houses. While in the heated brooder houses the chickens\r\nare fed in the regular way--with mixed ground grains, either dry or\r\nmoistened, and small whole or cracked grains. After they leave the\r\nbrooder houses they have cracked corn, beef scrap, and water always\r\nbefore them; for green food they have cabbage or the winter rye or grass\r\ngrowing on the land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 113. House used for growing roasting chickens]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 114. Group of houses like that in Fig. 113]\r\n\r\nAs the object of the grower is to have chickens that will grow large and\r\nremain soft as long as possible, the breeds used are principally Light\r\nBrahmas and Plymouth Rocks, although when eggs of these varieties cannot\r\nbe obtained in sufficient quantities, Wyandottes are used. The cockerels\r\nare caponized when they are about two months old. A capon does not grow\r\na comb or spurs, nor does it crow. If a perfect capon, it remains\r\nalways soft-meated and may grow very large, though it does not, as is\r\ncommonly supposed, grow larger than a cockerel within the time it is\r\nusually kept before being killed. An imperfect capon will after a time\r\ngrow a comb and short spurs and, though sterile, becomes harder in flesh\r\nthan a perfect capon. An imperfect capon is technically called a _slip_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 115. Petaluma egg farm. (Photograph from Bureau of\r\nAnimal Industry, United States Department of Agriculture)]\r\n\r\nAbout the first of March some of the earliest pullets may begin to lay.\r\nFrom that time all the pullets that begin to lay, and the slips as they\r\nappear, are marketed; all others are kept, because the grower realizes\r\nthe largest profit on those that can be marketed in June and July, when\r\nthe price is highest. By the middle of July, at the latest, everything\r\nis sold. The poultry keeper then begins to prepare for the next crop of\r\nchickens by taking up all his fences, plowing land that is not in grass,\r\nand planting it with winter rye or cabbage or some late garden crop. Rye\r\nand cabbage are preferred, because the rye will remain green all winter\r\nand furnish green food for chickens that have access to it, and the\r\ncabbage makes the best of green food for the little chickens in the\r\nbrooder houses. It is just as good for the others, too, but not many of\r\nthe poultry keepers grow enough to continue feeding it to them\r\nthroughout the winter.\r\n\r\nWhile the land on these plants is heavily stocked with poultry, the\r\nbirds are on it only half of the season,--when vegetation grows\r\nfreely,--and during the remainder of the season a great deal of manure\r\nis removed from the soil by gross-feeding crops like rye and cabbage. So\r\nthe land may be heavily stocked longer than it could be if fowls were on\r\nit all the time. The chickens grown in this way do not usually grow so\r\nlarge as those that are given more room, but they are grown at less cost\r\nand are as large as the market demands. By this method the land will\r\ncarry a large crop of chickens year after year for many years, yet it\r\nfinally becomes so contaminated that chickens do not thrive on it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 116. Group of houses on a Petaluma egg farm.\r\n(Photograph from Bureau of Animal Industry, United States Department of\r\nAgriculture)]\r\n\r\n\r\nINTENSIVE EGG FARMING\r\n\r\nStill another important development due to artificial incubation took\r\nplace in California. The climate of the Pacific Coast is well suited to\r\nfowls of the Mediterranean class, the cold never being severe enough to\r\naffect their large combs. Hence these fowls early became very popular\r\nwith farmers in this section, but as they were non-sitters, those who\r\nkept them had to keep hens of another breed to hatch and rear the\r\nchickens. When an incubator factory was established at Petaluma,\r\nCalifornia, the farmers in that vicinity began to use incubators, and\r\nsome small egg farms grew up in the town. White Leghorns were kept\r\nalmost exclusively. Before long the egg industry here had grown to such\r\nproportions that it was the most important local industry, and the\r\ndistrict became celebrated as a center of egg production. Although the\r\nproduct is different, and a different type of fowl is used, the\r\nconditions at Petaluma closely resemble those in the roaster-growing\r\ndistrict of Massachusetts. The special egg farms are small, each\r\ncontaining from five to ten acres. The houses for the laying hens are\r\nlarger than the colony houses used in Rhode Island, and are arranged in\r\ngroups of three, each group containing about five hundred hens.\r\n\r\nThe egg farmers grow their own pullets but, as a rule, do not breed or\r\nhatch them. The hatching is done by custom hatcheries, the eggs coming\r\nfrom flocks of White Leghorns on farms that do not specialize in poultry\r\nbut keep a flock of Leghorns under more favorable conditions than exist\r\non the egg farms. Here, as in the Massachusetts district, the bad\r\neffects of intensive methods are reduced for a time, because the fowls\r\naffected by them are not used for reproduction.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOULTRY FANCIERS' FARMS\r\n\r\nA large proportion of poultry fanciers are city people who have very\r\nlittle room for their fowls. Some have no room at all for growing\r\nchickens, although, by giving them the best of care, they can keep a\r\nsmall flock of adult birds in fair condition. Such fanciers have to find\r\nfarmers to grow chickens for them. This is not so easy as is commonly\r\nsupposed, for the farmers who are sufficiently interested in poultry to\r\ngive them the care required to make good exhibition birds usually want\r\nto give their own birds all the time they can spare for work with\r\npoultry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 117. Yards of a small poultry fancier]\r\n\r\nSo it happens that, after a few years' experience in keeping fine fowls\r\nin close quarters, an amateur fancier almost always wants to move to a\r\nfarm where he can grow more and better chickens. A small farm near a\r\ncity suits the average fancier best, because, when so situated, he can\r\ncontinue his regular work and look after his poultry in leisure time.\r\nFanciers generally use houses with many pens under one roof, because,\r\neven when they have only one variety, the different matings must be kept\r\nseparate during the breeding season, the adult males must be kept\r\nseparate at all times, and valuable hens cannot be kept in large flocks\r\nexcept when damage to plumage may be remedied before they are to be\r\nexhibited or sold. A fancier will keep only five or six birds, and\r\nsometimes only two or three, where a utility poultry keeper would keep a\r\ndozen. If the yards connecting with the pens in the houses are small, he\r\nwill arrange so that each lot of fowls may have access to a large yard\r\ndaily or on alternate days. In every way practicable the experienced\r\nfancier arranges to give his fowls all the advantages of natural\r\nconditions, while isolating them as completely as is necessary to keep\r\neach individual in perfect condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 118. Large fancy-poultry farm]\r\n\r\nPoultry farms that were started as intensive market-poultry or egg farms\r\nare sometimes converted into fancy-poultry farms. This is very likely to\r\nbe the case if thoroughbred stock is used and the owner becomes skillful\r\nas a breeder. If he can breed fowls of a quality to command high prices,\r\nhe may be able to produce enough of them on a small farm to make a very\r\ngood living, when it would be very much harder, or perhaps impossible,\r\nto make the farm profitable with ordinary stock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 119. Growing chicks in a fancier's yard]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 120. Young stock in cornfield on a fancier's farm]\r\n\r\nWhile farmers usually care more for horses, cattle, sheep, and hogs,\r\nmany become interested in poultry, and if they are natural fanciers and\r\ngood business men, it often happens that the growing of fancy poultry\r\nbecomes one of the most important industries on the farm. Many women on\r\nfarms become interested in fancy poultry, and some become very skillful\r\nbreeders and exhibitors. A farmer-fancier's poultry plant is usually a\r\ncombination of extensive and intensive methods. Some buildings with\r\nsmall compartments must be provided, but all except the choicest birds\r\ncan be managed just like the ordinary fowls on a farm where\r\narrangements are made with a view to giving them the full advantage of\r\nthe good conditions which the place affords.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 121. Summer quarters for poultry. (Photograph from\r\nNew York State Agricultural College at Cornell University)]\r\n\r\nTo a novice in fancy-poultry culture the number of chickens grown by\r\nexpert fanciers seems very small for the equipment and the land used,\r\nbut the old fancier has learned in the costly school of competition, by\r\nthe bitter experience of defeat, that in growing exhibition poultry it\r\npays to give the birds a great deal more room, both indoors and\r\noutdoors, than is needed simply to get quick growth and good size.\r\nElegance of form, depth and brilliance of color, and the indefinable\r\nqualities of style and finish that distinguish the high-class exhibition\r\nfowl are obtained in a much larger proportion of birds when they are\r\ngiven a great deal more room than they apparently need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nDUCKS\r\n\r\n\r\nDucks rank next to fowls in economic importance. If there were no fowls,\r\ndomestic ducks would probably be as numerous as fowls are now, for it is\r\nmuch easier to produce eggs and meat from ducks than from any known\r\nspecies of gallinaceous bird except the fowl. To most people who are not\r\naccustomed to eating them, neither the flesh nor the eggs of ducks seem\r\nquite as palatable as the flesh and eggs of fowls. On the other hand,\r\npeople accustomed to eating fat ducks and the eggs of ducks, which\r\ncontain a much higher percentage of fat than hens' eggs, often consider\r\nthe flesh and eggs of fowls rather insipid. The feathers of ducks are\r\nmore valuable commercially than those of fowls but are not\r\ncorrespondingly profitable to the producer, because ducks are much\r\nharder to pluck.\r\n\r\n=Description.= Common ducks are about the same size as common fowls. The\r\nimproved breeds vary greatly in size but do not present such extremes of\r\nsize and diversity of form as are found in the races of fowls. As the\r\nduck in a state of nature lives much upon the water, its form is at\r\nnearly every point different from the typical form of the fowl. The duck\r\nis usually described as boat-shaped, but, while this is a good\r\ndescription, it would be more correct to say that a boat is duck-shaped.\r\nThe duck was the natural model for the first builders of boats.\r\n\r\nThe bills of ducks are large, rather flat, and broad at the tip. The\r\nspecies to which most of our domestic ducks belong has no head ornaments\r\ncorresponding to the comb and wattles of the fowl. There is one variety\r\nof this species which has a topknot, or crest. The Muscovy Duck, which\r\nis of a different species, has a bare face with a carunculated red skin.\r\nThe plumage of ducks is very soft and dense, forming a thick covering\r\nwhich, when the feathers are in a natural position, is impenetrable to\r\nwater and so perfect a protection from wind and cold that hardy ducks\r\nare quite indifferent to keen winds and low temperatures, and, if left\r\nto themselves, rarely seek shelter in winter. During a heavy snowfall\r\nthey will get under cover to escape being buried in the snow. At other\r\ntimes they seem quite as comfortable on snow and ice as on the ground.\r\nOne of the most interesting sights of the poultry yard is to see a duck\r\nsit down on the snow or ice when the temperature is below zero, draw up\r\nits feet and work them into the feathers at the side of its body until\r\nthey are completely covered, tuck its bill into the feathers of its back\r\nuntil only the nostrils and a little of the base of the bill are\r\nexposed, and remain this way through the coldest nights rather than go a\r\nfew feet to a comfortable house with warm bedding on the floor. Being\r\nbetter adapted to cold than fowls, they are, as would be expected, much\r\nmore susceptible to heat and suffer greatly in hot summer weather if\r\nexposed to the sun or kept where there is not a good circulation of air.\r\n\r\nThe tails of ducks are short, spread laterally, and are usually folded\r\nclose and carried with the tip a little higher than the base. The legs\r\nare very short, comparatively slender, and weak. Most ducks walk\r\nawkwardly and fall down and flounder about helplessly when they try to\r\nrun. The legs of a duck are so weak that it is not safe to catch or\r\nhandle them by the legs, as fowls are usually caught and handled. It is\r\nvery easy to break or dislocate the leg of a duck in this way. Hence,\r\nthe usual method is to catch and carry them by the neck, which is very\r\nstrong. Most persons who are not used to handling ducks are afraid of\r\nchoking them by grasping the neck firmly, but there is very little\r\ndanger of this. The feet of a duck are webbed between the forward toes,\r\nwhich makes them more serviceable as paddles in swimming. They are not\r\nsuited to perching. There is a wild tree duck, and it is said that the\r\ndomestic Muscovy Duck sometimes alights in trees or on objects above the\r\nground, but the familiar kinds of ducks rest only on the surface of the\r\nland or on the water.\r\n\r\nAlthough the males average a little larger, the male and female of the\r\nsame stock are usually nearer the same size than in gallinaceous birds.\r\nThe only marks by which sex can be distinguished in all ducks are the\r\nvoice and the presence or absence of the small curled feathers on the\r\ntail which characterize the males. In party-colored varieties the color\r\nmarkings of the male and female are sometimes different. The \"quack\" of\r\nthe duck is the note of the female; the male makes a very subdued\r\nsimilar sound, comparing with it as a hoarse whisper compares with the\r\nnatural tones of the human voice.\r\n\r\nThe duck derives its English name from its habit of ducking its head\r\ninto the water in search of food at the bottom of the shallow waters,\r\nwhich it prefers. The term \"duck\" is applied to males and females\r\ncollectively, and also to the female as distinguished from the male. The\r\nmale is called a _drake_. The name \"drake\" is supposed to be derived\r\nfrom an Old German word meaning \"the chief duck.\" Any one who is\r\nfamiliar with the habits of ducks will see at once the appropriateness\r\nof the term. Ducks often march in single file, and when they do so, all\r\nthe drakes in a group go first, the ducks following them, usually with a\r\nlittle space between. So if there is only one male, he marches a little\r\nahead of his flock, like a commander. Young ducks are called\r\n_ducklings_, the name being applied to both sexes. In our language there\r\nare no special terms applying to a young duck and a young drake as\r\ndistinguished from adult birds.\r\n\r\n=Origin.= Useful domestic ducks are of two species. All the breeds of\r\nthis class, except the Muscovy Duck, are derived from the wild Mallard\r\nDuck, specimens of which are still frequently captured and domesticated.\r\nThe Mallard takes very readily to domestication. Although in the wild\r\nstate it is a migratory bird, in domestication it soon becomes too heavy\r\nto fly far. After a few generations in domestication it becomes as large\r\nas common domestic stock, loses its power of flight, and cannot be\r\ndistinguished from stock that has been domesticated for centuries.\r\nMallard Ducks captured in the wild state and kept in captivity have been\r\nknown to lay from eighty to one hundred eggs in a season, which is as\r\nmany as the average domestic duck lays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 122. Domesticated Mallard Ducks, Brook View Farm,\r\nNewbury, Massachusetts]\r\n\r\nWhen ducks were first domesticated is not known. The figure of a duck\r\nwas used in the earliest Egyptian hieroglyphics. As the Mallard is\r\nwidely distributed and so easily tamed, and as domestic ducks of the\r\nsame type (but apparently not related in domestication) are found in\r\nwidely separated parts of the earth, it is plain that the distribution\r\nof domestic ducks has been less dependent upon the movements of the\r\nhuman race than the distribution of the fowl. Wherever at any time in\r\nthe history of the world male and female wild Mallards happened to be\r\ncaught and kept in captivity, a domestic race might be developed. A\r\nmissionary who went to Africa in 1885 and worked among the Bakubas--a\r\npeople more than a thousand miles from the west coast of the\r\ncontinent--reported that he found there such little mongrel fowls as are\r\ncommon elsewhere in Africa, and a local race of domestic ducks varied\r\nin color as are the common ducks of Europe and America, but as large as\r\nthe Rouen and Pekin ducks. The Bakubas had had so little intercourse\r\nwith civilized peoples that it was not at all likely that an improved\r\nrace of ducks had been introduced from the outside world, and whatever\r\npossibility of that might be supposed to exist, the fact that the ducks\r\nof this country, like the domestic quadrupeds, were dumb indicates that\r\nthey are a distinct and very old domestic race.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 123. Colored Muscovy Ducks. (Photograph by E. J.\r\nHall)]\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting in this connection that the missionary, Dr. William\r\nH. Sheppard, found it the accepted opinion among this savage people\r\nthat, by a process of natural selection, the character of dumbness had\r\nbeen acquired by the domestic animals, to which it gave a measure of\r\nprotection from wild enemies in the forest around them. It seems\r\nwonderful that the theory of evolution was found out by such people\r\nbefore it was developed by modern scientists.\r\n\r\n=The common duck.= Like the ordinary mongrel fowl, the common duck\r\n(sometimes called the puddle duck, because, when it cannot find water\r\nelsewhere, it appears to be perfectly satisfied with the filthiest\r\npuddles) is much the same in all parts of the world and is a very\r\ninferior bird in comparison with ducks of the improved races. Common\r\nducks are usually very slow growers and weigh at maturity from three to\r\nfour pounds each. As a rule they are very indifferent layers, laying\r\nonly in the spring. They are of various colors.\r\n\r\n=Improved races.= Nearly all our improved races of ducks are of foreign\r\norigin. At the poultry exhibition at Boston in 1849 the only kinds\r\nexhibited were the Aylesbury, the Muscovy, and the ornamental Wood\r\nducks.\r\n\r\nThe Aylesbury Duck is a large white duck developed as a local variety in\r\nthe vale of Aylesbury, in England. It has a flesh-colored bill, and legs\r\nof a pale orange color. Although the favorite market duck in England,\r\nand early known in America, it never became a favorite here.\r\n\r\nThe Muscovy Duck is, as has been stated, of a different species from our\r\nother useful breeds. It is a native of South America and is supposed to\r\nhave been taken to Europe in the seventeenth century. It was probably\r\nbrought to North America from Europe less than a hundred years ago. It\r\ndiffers from ducks of Mallard origin in several other particulars\r\nbesides the naked head with its bright-red, carunculated skin. The male\r\nis very much larger than the female. The tail is longer and more\r\ndepressed. There is an entire absence of red pigment in the plumage. The\r\nnatural color is black and white, unevenly distributed. This variety is\r\ncalled the Colored Muscovy Duck. Many specimens are nearly black. The\r\nWhite Muscovy Duck is an albino variety. By crossing these two varieties\r\na blue variety is sometimes obtained, but, although Blue Muscovy Ducks\r\nhave been made at various times, fanciers have never taken enough\r\ninterest in them to encourage the originators to continue their\r\nbreeding.\r\n\r\nThe Rouen Duck takes its name from the town of Rouen, in the north of\r\nFrance, though the type seems to have been common over quite a large\r\narea and not peculiar to the vicinity of that town. It is like the\r\nMallard in color, and is just such a duck as by good care and selection\r\nfor size might be developed at any time from common ducks of that color.\r\nRouen Ducks are said to have been well known in the south of England\r\nearly in the nineteenth century. When they were brought to this country\r\nis not known. Although for a long time they have been familiar to those\r\nwho attend poultry shows, and have been widely distributed in small\r\nnumbers, they have never been extensively bred because the Rouen, having\r\ndark plumage, is not desirable for the production of young ducks for\r\nmarket. When mature it dresses clean and the quality of its flesh is\r\nunsurpassed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 124. Rouen Ducks, Brook View Farm, Newbury,\r\nMassachusetts]\r\n\r\nThe Cayuga Duck is an improved black duck developed about the middle of\r\nthe last century in Cayuga County, New York. Some early accounts of its\r\norigin stated that it was a domesticated wild black duck, but it is much\r\nmore reasonable to suppose that it was developed by selection from black\r\nand nearly black common ducks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 125. Flock of Pekin Ducks]\r\n\r\nThe White Pekin Duck is a Chinese breed closely resembling the Aylesbury\r\nDuck of England. It has an orange-yellow bill and legs. No large ducks\r\nof other colors than white have ever been brought to this country or to\r\nEurope from China. As far as is known, the importations from China to\r\nEngland and the United States consisted of only a few birds and were\r\nmade about 1872-1875. Information about these is not very definite. The\r\nmost commonly accepted version is that they were brought to England in\r\n1874 and to the United States from England in the following year, but\r\nsome accounts say that both England and America received them direct in\r\n1873, and one account places the first importation to England in 1872.\r\nThe exact truth is not of importance in such a matter, but those who are\r\ninterested in the remarkable developments in duck culture which followed\r\nthe arrival of this breed in the Western World naturally wish to know\r\nthe facts. All accounts agree that there were only a few ducks brought\r\nfrom China. In England the Pekin became quite popular at once. It was\r\nhardier and more prolific than the Aylesbury, and was used largely in\r\noutcrosses, to give vigor to Aylesbury stock. In America it became\r\nimmensely popular in a few years. It was found to be remarkably well\r\nadapted to intensive methods of poultry keeping, and large duck farms\r\nwere built up; some of these made very large profits for long periods of\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Runner Duck is a small, active duck which originated long ago\r\nas the common duck on the meadows of certain marshy districts in the\r\nNetherlands. The peasants of these districts compelled their ducks to\r\nforage for their food, and so developed ducks with a more upright\r\ncarriage and stronger legs than the other races. In the Netherlands\r\nthese ducks are of all colors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 126. Indian Runner Ducks. (Photograph from owner,\r\nClayton Ballard, White Pine, Tennessee)]\r\n\r\nDucks of this type, in color white with fawn-colored markings, were\r\nintroduced to poultry fanciers in England in 1893 or 1894 as Indian\r\nRunner Ducks. It was said that they had been first brought from India to\r\nCumberland fifty or sixty years before, and that ever since that time\r\nthey had been bred pure by a few breeders and more or less mixed with\r\nthe common stock of that section by many others. The story of their\r\nhistory in England is much more plausible than that of their origin in\r\nIndia. When the breed was shown on the Continent of Europe it was at\r\nonce recognized by fanciers there as an improved variety of a common\r\nduck.\r\n\r\nCompared with other ducks the Indian Runner is a remarkable layer, but\r\nit does not, as many admirers of the breed claim, surpass fowls in egg\r\nproduction, and the market for duck eggs is so limited that it is easily\r\noverstocked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 127. Flock of White Indian Runner Ducks. (Photograph\r\nfrom Bureau of Animal Industry, United States Department of\r\nAgriculture)]\r\n\r\nBlue Swedish Ducks and Buff Orpington Ducks are simply color varieties\r\nof an improved type of the common duck. There are several other quite\r\nwell-marked varieties in Europe that have not been seen in this country.\r\n\r\n=Ornamental ducks.= The ornamental ducks of the same species as the\r\ncommon duck, and derived either from common ducks or directly from the\r\nMallard, are the East India Duck, the Black, White, and Gray Call Ducks,\r\nand the Crested White Duck. The Call Ducks are so named because their\r\npersistent quacking makes them valuable for calling wild ducks within\r\nrange of the guns of hunters, and they are much used as decoys. They are\r\nvery small and were produced by dwarfing common ducks. The name \"gray,\"\r\nto describe the colored variety, is misleading. The color is like that\r\nof the Mallard but of a lighter shade. Some Mallards are quite as gray\r\nas the average Gray Call Duck. The Black East India Duck is a dwarf\r\nblack duck differing so little from the Call Ducks as to leave no doubt,\r\nin the mind of any one acquainted with the mysteries of making and\r\nnaming breeds of poultry, that, like the Call Ducks, it is of European\r\norigin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 128. Blue Orpington Ducks. (Photograph from owner,\r\nSunswick Farm, Plainfield, New Jersey)]\r\n\r\nThere are many ornamental ducks of other species, the most interesting\r\nof which are the brilliantly colored Wood Duck (sometimes called the\r\nCarolina Duck) and the Mandarin Duck, which, besides being gorgeously\r\ncolored, has a peculiar crest and has some of the feathers on its wings\r\noddly curved and spread, giving it a singular appearance. Specimens of\r\nthese ducks are almost always to be seen in a collection of fancy\r\nwaterfowl. The Wood Duck is a native of North America, the Mandarin Duck\r\nof Northern China.\r\n\r\n=Place of ducks in domestication.= It has been stated that if there were\r\nno fowls, the duck would make the best substitute, but as we have fowls\r\nin great variety, and as they suit us better than ducks for nearly every\r\npurpose for which either might be used, ducks are not often kept in\r\nplace of fowls. Small flocks of ducks are kept in addition to a flock of\r\nfowls, both on farms and by town poultry keepers, either because the\r\nowner likes to have them about or to add to the variety of poultry meat\r\nfor home consumption. The flocks of ducks so kept are of comparatively\r\nlittle economic importance. The ratio of ducks to fowls is only about\r\none to fifty, and the ratio of values of the products of these two kinds\r\nof poultry is probably nearer one to one hundred. But when poultry\r\nkeeping is made a special business, duck growing gives the surest and\r\nthe largest profits, because ducks can be grown in large numbers more\r\neasily than any other domestic animal. The largest permanently\r\nsuccessful poultry farms in the world are the great duck farms of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 129. Black and White Call Ducks, Brook View Farm,\r\nNewbury, Massachusetts]\r\n\r\nTo the fancier, ducks are decidedly less interesting than fowls, not\r\nonly because, as has already been stated, they present fewer superficial\r\ncharacters upon which he can exercise his art, but because they are, on\r\nthe whole, less intelligent and less capable of developing confidence in\r\none who handles them. Fowls are much easier to handle in the way the\r\nfancier must often handle his birds for thorough examination. As a\r\nrule, a fowl quickly learns that it is not going to be hurt, and the\r\nmore it is handled the tamer it becomes. Young ducks are almost stupidly\r\nfearless of the person who feeds them, as long as he goes among them\r\nwithout touching them, but after he catches them they are as stupidly\r\nshy. It takes very much more patience to handle ducks as a fancier\r\nhandles birds than the average human being possesses, and so very few\r\npeople find them satisfactory for pets after they cease to be a novelty.\r\n\r\nPerhaps if the interest in the breeding of ducks for exhibition were\r\ngreater, stocks of ducks that were free from this timidity could\r\ngradually be developed. Individual birds are often found which are not\r\nat all shy; and, as a rule, persistent selection for any quality will\r\neventually make it a race characteristic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF DUCKS\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough ducks delight in the water and, when they have an opportunity\r\nto do so, spend a considerable part of the time in it, they are often\r\nkept very successfully where they have no water except for drinking.\r\nSome duck breeders, who have kept their ducks for many generations\r\nwithout water in which they could swim, have said that the ducks lost\r\nall desire to swim, and that birds of such stock would not go into the\r\nwater even when they had the opportunity to do so. This statement\r\ngreatly exaggerates the facts. Any young duck, no matter how the stock\r\nfrom which it came has been kept, will take to the water as soon as it\r\ncan run about if it is given access to water at that time; but if young\r\nducks are kept away from the water until they are several weeks old, and\r\nthen given access to water in which they can swim, they are often as\r\nmuch afraid of the water as they would be of any object to which they\r\nwere not accustomed. If they remain near the water, however, it will not\r\nbe long before they follow their natural instinct to get into it. Having\r\nonce entered the water, they are immediately as much at home there as if\r\nthey had always known the pleasures of life in that element.\r\n\r\nAs comparatively few people keep ducks, and specialization in duck\r\nculture is mostly in the line of producing young ducks for market, on a\r\nlarge scale, there is not as much variety in methods of managing ducks\r\nas in methods of managing fowls. If ducks are expected to do the best of\r\nwhich they are capable, they must be given a great deal of attention.\r\nWhile no bird will endure more neglect without appearing to suffer,\r\nthere is none that will respond to good care more generously.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALL FLOCKS ON TOWN LOTS\r\n\r\n=Numbers.= The small flock of ducks on a town lot is usually a _very_\r\nsmall flock, kept more from curiosity and for a little variety in\r\npoultry keeping than with any definite purpose. Most of such little\r\nflocks are composed of a drake and from one to five ducks. Where a\r\nlarger flock is kept for the eggs they produce, the number rarely\r\nexceeds fifteen or twenty. Many town people who want to grow only a few\r\nducks each year prefer not to keep any adult stock, but to buy a few\r\neggs for hatching when they want them.\r\n\r\n=Houses and yards.= Ducks require about the same amounts of house and\r\nyard room per bird as fowls. While they will stand crowding better than\r\nany other kind of poultry, they appreciate an abundance of room and good\r\nconditions, and are more thrifty when they are not overcrowded. Where\r\nthey can be allowed to remain outdoors at night, they really need no\r\nshelter but a shed large enough to give them shade from the sun on hot\r\ndays and protection from hard, driving storms. On most town lots,\r\nhowever, it is advisable to have them indoors at night for protection\r\nfrom dogs and thieves. Also, the amount of roughing that they like,\r\nwhile not at all detrimental to them, is not conducive to early laying.\r\nSo most duck keepers prefer to have the ducks housed at night and in\r\nsevere weather, and give them approximately the same space that would be\r\ngiven to an equal number of fowls.\r\n\r\nThe floor of the house should be littered with straw, hay, or shavings.\r\nThe object of littering the floors of duck houses is not to afford them\r\nexercise, but to provide them with dry bedding. The droppings of ducks\r\nare very watery, and the bedding must be changed often enough to keep\r\nthe ducks clean. It is customary to provide shallow nest boxes, placing\r\nthem on the floor next the wall, preferably in a corner. The ducks are\r\nquite as likely to leave their eggs anywhere on the floor, or out in the\r\nyard (if they are let out before they lay), but the nests are there if\r\nthey want them, and many will use the nests regularly.\r\n\r\nThe only other furnishings needed are a feed trough and a drinking\r\nvessel, but it is advisable to have a tub or a pan in which the birds\r\ncan take a bath, and to supply them with water in this once or twice a\r\nweek. The drinking vessel must be one that they cannot get into, for if\r\nthey can get into it they will certainly do so. An ordinary wooden water\r\npail, or a small butter tub with the part above the upper hoop sawed\r\noff, makes a very satisfactory drinking vessel for adult ducks. It will\r\nhold enough water for the ducks to partially wash themselves, which they\r\ndo by dipping their heads in the water and then rubbing them on their\r\nbodies and wings. For the regular bath for two or three ducks one of the\r\nlargest-sized bath pans made for pigeons will do very well, or an old\r\nwashtub cut down to six or eight inches deep may be used. For a flock of\r\neight or ten ducks a good tub may be made from one end of a molasses\r\nhogshead. The bath should always be given outdoors, because it takes the\r\nducks only a few minutes to splash so much water out of the tub that\r\neverything around it is thoroughly wet. The drinking water should also\r\nbe given outdoors whenever the houses are open.\r\n\r\nAs the ducks of the breeds usually kept can hardly fly at all, very low\r\npartitions and fences will keep them in their quarters, but to keep\r\nother poultry or animals out of their yards it may be necessary to build\r\nhigher fences. For the heavier breeds, like the Pekin and Rouen, fences\r\nare usually made from 18 inches to 24 inches high. The ducks will rarely\r\nattempt to go over these, but occasionally a drake learns to climb a\r\ntwo-foot fence by using his bill, wings, and toes, and may then manage\r\nto get over a higher fence. For the small, light breeds, fences 3 or 4\r\nfeet high may be needed. If their yard is on a slope and is large enough\r\nto give them a chance to start a flight high up on the slope, so that\r\nthey will rise above the fence at the lower side, it may be necessary\r\neither to put a very high fence on that side or to cover the yard.\r\n\r\nWhile the fence for ducks need not be either high or strong, there must\r\nbe no holes in it that a duck, having put its head through, could by\r\npressure enlarge enough to let its body pass. A piece of wire netting\r\nthat has begun to rust a little may be as good as ever for fowls for a\r\nlong time, but if used for a duck fence it will be most unsatisfactory,\r\nbecause the ducks will soon make many holes in it. If wire netting alone\r\nis used, it should be fastened to the ground with pegs every three or\r\nfour feet.\r\n\r\n=Feeding.= The feeding of ducks differs from the feeding of hens in that\r\nducks need mostly soft food, and that, if the keeper wishes to force\r\ngrowth or egg production, they may be fed much larger proportions of\r\nsuch concentrated foods as beef scraps and meat meals. As has been\r\nstated, in its natural state the duck gets the greater part of its food\r\nfrom the water. This is all soft food, and the bird swallows a great\r\ndeal of water with it. It does not, therefore, need a large crop in\r\nwhich to soak its food before it passes into the gizzard. So the crop of\r\nthe duck is small--merely an enlargement of the gullet. Some of the old\r\nbooks on poultry say that the duck has no crop, but you can see by\r\nlooking at a duck that has just had a full meal that the food it has\r\ntaken remains in the passage, sometimes filling it right up to the\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 130. Pekin duckling six weeks old]\r\n\r\nWith a mash (just the same as is given to hens) morning and evening, a\r\ncabbage to pick at, plenty of drinking water, and a supply of oyster\r\nshell always before them, ducks will do very well. If they have no\r\ncabbage, about one third (by bulk) of the mash should be cut clover or\r\nalfalfa. When the days are long, it is a good plan to give them a little\r\ncracked corn or whole wheat about noon. The water supply should always\r\nbe replenished just before feeding, for as soon as a duck has taken a\r\nfew mouthfuls of food of any kind, it wants a drink of water.\r\n\r\n=Laying habits.= With the exception of the ducks of the Indian Runner\r\ntype, which lay some eggs at other seasons, as hens do, ducks usually\r\nlay very persistently for about six months, and then stop entirely for\r\nabout six months. Occasionally ducks of other breeds lay a few eggs in\r\nthe autumn, but this trait has not been developed in them as it has in\r\nthe Indian Runner. If they are comfortably housed and well fed, Pekin\r\nand Rouen Ducks usually begin to lay in January. If they are allowed to\r\nexpose themselves to rough weather, and are fed indifferently, they may\r\nnot begin to lay until March or April. When they do begin, they usually\r\nlay much more steadily than hens until hot weather comes, and then\r\ngradually decrease their production until by midsummer they have stopped\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 131. Pekin drake four months old, weighing nine\r\npounds]\r\n\r\nThe eggs are usually laid very early in the morning. Ducks often lay\r\nbefore daylight and almost always lay before eight o'clock. When a duck\r\nlays in a nest, she is very likely to cover the egg with the nest\r\nmaterial when she leaves it. A duck will often make a nest and remain on\r\nit an hour or more and then go and drop her egg somewhere else and pay\r\nno further attention to it.\r\n\r\n=Growing ducklings.= For a poultry keeper who has only a little room it\r\nis much easier to grow a few ducks than to grow an equal number of\r\nchickens. There are two reasons for this: One is that the ducklings\r\nstand close confinement better and are not so sensitive to unsanitary\r\nconditions; the other is that ducks of the improved breeds grow much\r\nmore quickly than chickens and are grown up before the novelty of caring\r\nfor them wears off and the keeper tires of giving the close attention\r\nthat young poultry need when grown under such conditions.\r\n\r\nThe ducks of the improved breeds are mostly non-sitters. Unless one has\r\ncommon ducks, Muscovy Ducks, Rouen Ducks with some wild Mallard blood,\r\nor Mallards not long domesticated, he is not likely to have a duck \"go\r\nbroody,\" and so small lots of duck eggs are usually hatched under hens.\r\nAs duck eggs are larger than hen eggs, a smaller number is given to the\r\nhen. Eleven medium-sized duck eggs are given to a hen that would cover\r\nthirteen hen eggs. If the eggs are large, it is better to give such a\r\nhen only nine.\r\n\r\nThe development of a fertile duck egg that has a white or slightly\r\ntinted shell can be seen very plainly when the egg is held before a\r\nlight, much earlier than the development of a hen egg. If the shell is\r\ngreen and quite dark in color, the development of the germ may not show\r\nany better than in a brown-shelled hen egg. The period of incubation is\r\nabout four weeks. Eggs are sometimes picked as early as the twenty-fifth\r\nday, but usually on the twenty-sixth day. As stated in Chapter II, the\r\nduckling usually waits quite a long time after chipping the shell before\r\nit completes the process and emerges.\r\n\r\nIn a little duckling we find the most striking resemblance to a reptile\r\nthat is to be seen among domestic birds. It has a long, soft body, a\r\nlong neck, short legs, and a wriggling movement, and sometimes, when it\r\nis wriggling through a small hole, it looks very snakelike. While they\r\nare very small, ducklings are the most interesting of young birds. They\r\nwill go to the water as soon as they leave the nest. Dabbling in it\r\nwill not hurt them in the least if the weather is pleasant, if the water\r\nis not cold, and if they can leave it when they are tired and go to\r\ntheir mother and get dry and warm. Much of the pleasure of growing young\r\nducks is in watching their behavior in the water. For this purpose a\r\nlarge pan or a small, shallow tub may be placed in their coop. It should\r\neither be sunk in the ground, so that they can get in and out easily, or\r\ntwo short pieces of board should be nailed together at such an angle\r\nthat they will form a little walk from the ground outside, over the edge\r\nof the vessel, and to the bottom inside. This walk enables the ducklings\r\nto get out if the water gets so low that they cannot scramble from its\r\nsurface over the sides of the pan or tub. The best way to teach the\r\nlittle ducks to use the walk is to put a little pile of sods or earth\r\nbeside the vessel containing the water. The ducks will learn very\r\nquickly to go into the water in this way, and will soon find their way\r\nout by the board walk. After they have come out by the walk a few times,\r\nthey will begin to go in by it. It is very important to make sure that\r\nif young ducks are given water to play in, they can get out of it\r\neasily. Many who have not had experience in handling them neglect this\r\nand feel very bad when some of their ducklings are drowned.\r\n\r\nIf proper provision is made for the safety of the ducklings, they afford\r\na great deal of entertainment. One of the first things a little duck\r\ndoes when it gets into the water is to go through the peculiar ducking\r\nperformance that gives the name to its species. The little fellows duck\r\ntheir heads to the bottom, and their tails and feet go up into the air\r\nwhile they mechanically feel with their bills for the food which\r\ninstinct seems to suggest should be there. They play in the water, going\r\nthrough all the motions of feeding in it. If the sun is warm, they are\r\nas likely to lie down together in the sun when they leave the water as\r\nthey are to go to the hen to be brooded. As they lie on the ground they\r\noften turn one eye toward the sky and look steadily upward, as if they\r\nknew intuitively that one of their most dangerous natural enemies might\r\nappear from that quarter. In every way they comport themselves just as\r\nold ducks do and not at all in the ways of their hen mother.\r\n\r\nThe young ducks may be fed, as the old ones are, on mash, but should be\r\nfed oftener, unless their coops are where they can eat all the grass\r\nthey want and can get a great many flies, worms, and insects. They are\r\nexpert flycatchers, and if there is anything in their coop to attract\r\nflies, they will get a great many of them. Under such conditions three\r\nfeeds a day will be sufficient. If they have no grass they should be fed\r\nfive times daily and should be supplied with tender green food of some\r\nkind. For the first few days the mash given them should have a little\r\nvery fine gravel or coarse sand mixed with it--about a heaping\r\ntablespoonful to a quart of mash. At any time after that when the ducks\r\nseem dull and weak, a little fine gravel in the mash will usually tone\r\nthem up.\r\n\r\nLittle ducks grow very fast and in a few weeks are entirely independent\r\nof the hen. At ten or twelve weeks they are fully feathered and almost\r\nfull-grown, and are ready to be killed and eaten as \"green ducks.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALL FLOCKS ON FARMS\r\n\r\n=General conditions.= The small flock of ducks on the farm is usually\r\nmost profitable if it can be given the run of a small pasture or orchard\r\nwhere the birds have good foraging and have access to a pond or stream\r\nbut cannot wander away. Ducks on the farm are often allowed to run with\r\nother poultry. This may do very well if the flocks of all kinds are\r\nsmall and can separate when foraging, but as a rule it is better to put\r\nthe ducks where they will be away from other poultry. A small flock of\r\nducks properly placed on a farm should require very little food and very\r\nlittle attention. If possible the birds should be free at night,\r\nbecause the worms and grubs come to the surface in greatest abundance\r\nthen, and they can get as much in an hour early in the morning as they\r\ncan in several hours after the sun is high. The principal objections to\r\nleaving them out at night are that they may be attacked by animals that\r\nprey upon them, and that the ducks may lay their eggs where they are not\r\neasily found. The person in charge of the ducks has to use his judgment\r\nas to whether the risks in his case are so great that the ducks should\r\nbe confined at night.\r\n\r\nWhen a flock of ducks on a farm has liberty to wander at will, it often\r\nmakes a great deal of trouble, because ducks are prone to stop for the\r\nnight wherever they happen to be when they have eaten their fill late in\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\n=Feeding.= If the ducks are kept in until they have laid, they should\r\nhave a little food when they are let out. It does not make much\r\ndifference what this is. If a mash is made for other poultry, some of it\r\nmay be given to them. Otherwise, a little whole grain will make them\r\ncomfortable until they can pick up a more varied breakfast. The best\r\nmethod of feeding the young ducks will depend upon the conditions. As a\r\nrule it is better to keep them quite close for the first two or three\r\nweeks and feed them well. The ideal way is to coop them on grass, or in\r\na garden where they can get a great deal of green food and worms.\r\nTreated in this way they will get a better start and will grow much\r\nfaster and larger than if they are allowed to wear themselves out by\r\nrunning about while small. On a farm where there is no water near the\r\nhouse, but where there is a stream at a little distance, the young ducks\r\nshould be so placed that they cannot make their way to this stream. Very\r\nsmall ducks at liberty will often find their way alone to water so far\r\nfrom their home that it was not supposed that they could locate it. If\r\nthey have an opportunity to do so, small ducks are much more likely than\r\nolder ones to wander off in search of water, and instinct seems to\r\ndirect them toward it.\r\n\r\nAfter the ducklings are three or four weeks old, they may be given as\r\nmuch freedom as old ducks. Unless natural food is very abundant, they\r\nshould be fed some grain for a while. Ducks grown in this way cannot be\r\nsold to advantage as green ducks. At this stage of growth they cannot be\r\ncollected from small flocks and marketed in condition to bring the\r\nprices paid for those from the special duck farms, and as it costs the\r\nfarmer little or nothing to keep his ducks until mature, it is usually\r\nmore profitable for him to do so than to sell them earlier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 132. Duck farms at Speonk, Long Island]\r\n\r\nOn a farm near a market where there is a good demand for green ducks it\r\nmight pay very well to grow several hundred a year. On this scale the\r\nmethods should be similar to those used on the special duck farms,\r\nexcept that the hatching might be done with hens. It would not do to let\r\nthe ducks run about as recommended for stock which is to be kept until\r\nmature, because then they would not be fat at the age for killing them.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKET DUCK FARMS\r\n\r\n=History.= The growing of ducks for the New York City market began on\r\nLong Island at a very early stage of specialization in poultry culture.\r\nMany farmers there produced a few hundred ducks for this market each\r\nyear, and found it very profitable. As the demand increased they tried\r\nto increase production to meet it, but were unable to do this, because\r\nthere was then in this country no duck adapted to their needs. The\r\nAylesbury Duck, the favorite table duck in England, was too delicate.\r\nThe only hardy white duck that they had was the White Muscovy. This\r\nbreed was not very satisfactory, because the females are much smaller\r\nthan the males, but they had to use white ducks, for the colored ducks\r\nwill not pick clean at the age at which ducks can be marketed most\r\nprofitably; so they did the best they could with the White Muscovy Duck,\r\nunder the restrictions placed upon their operations by the difficulty of\r\ngetting broody hens. While the industry was mostly on Long Island, there\r\nwere duck growers here and there on the mainland in the vicinity of New\r\nYork and also near Boston, but there were no duck farms of any\r\nimportance in other parts of the country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 133. View from the windmill tower in Fig. 132]\r\n\r\nWhen the White Pekin Ducks were brought from China, and reports of their\r\nhardiness, prolificacy, and rapid growth were circulated, the duck\r\ngrowers were at first very skeptical, but they soon learned that the\r\nreports which they had supposed were greatly exaggerated were literally\r\ntrue. Then every duck grower had to have Pekin Ducks. The production\r\nincreased very much after the introduction of the Pekin Duck, but the\r\ngrowth of the industry was still retarded by the impossibility of\r\ngetting all the hens that were needed to hatch the eggs. Several\r\nincubators had been invented, which hatched very well for those who had\r\nthe skill to operate them, but which, in the hands of unskilled\r\noperators, spoiled most of the eggs placed in them. About 1890 appeared\r\nthe first incubators with automatic regulators that really worked so\r\nthat the ordinary person could manage the machines successfully. One of\r\nthe New England duck growers who had invented the best of the machines\r\nused before this time was already growing ducklings on quite a large\r\nscale. On Long Island, where most of the duck farms were located, the\r\nfarmers were hard to convince of the superiority of incubators for their\r\nwork. Indeed, the only way that they could be convinced was by practical\r\ndemonstrations right on their own farms. The first incubators used there\r\nwere machines set up on trial by a manufacturer who had invented an\r\nincubator which was very easy to operate. This man went to the duck\r\ngrowing district, placed machines on various farms, and went from farm\r\nto farm daily to attend to them, until the farmers were fully convinced\r\nthat the machines would do what was claimed for them. In a very short\r\ntime the artificial method had displaced hatching with hens on the\r\ncommercial duck farms, and the business was growing amazingly. Within\r\nten years there were many farms producing from 15,000 to 20,000 ducks a\r\nyear, and a few producing from 40,000 to 50,000. One man on Long Island,\r\nwho operated two farms a few miles apart, sometimes grew 80,000 ducks in\r\na season. Those who were successful on a large scale became moderately\r\nrich. Without exception the successful duck farms have been built up\r\nfrom small beginnings by men who had very little capital to start with.\r\nSome of these farms have been operated on a large scale for twenty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 134. House and yards for breeding stock]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 135. Brooder house for young ducklings]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 136. Fattening sheds and yards]\r\n\r\nVIEWS OF WEBER BROTHERS' DUCK FARM, WRENTHAM, MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\r\nAs would be expected, the success of the big duck farms has led many\r\npeople with large capital to undertake to establish duck farms on a\r\nstill larger scale. But these undertakings do not last long, because it\r\nis practically impossible to secure for such a plant an organization as\r\nefficient as one developed by the owner of a plant which has grown from\r\nsmall beginnings under his own management.\r\n\r\n=Description.= A large duck farm is a very interesting place at any\r\ntime, but is most interesting at the height of the growing season, when\r\nall the operations in the business are going on at the same time. The\r\ntotal number of birds on a farm at any time is very much less than the\r\nproduct for the season, because the first ducks hatched will have gone\r\nto market before the eggs which produce the last are laid, but in flocks\r\nof more than 10,000 the impression on the visitor is much the same, no\r\nmatter what the numbers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 137. Duck house and yards on seashore, Fishers\r\nIsland, New York]\r\n\r\nDuck farms are of two types: those located on streams or inlets have the\r\nyards for all but the smallest ducks partly in the water; the inland\r\nduck farms, on which the young ducks grown for market are given no water\r\nexcept for drinking. Some of the inland farms give the breeding stock\r\naccess to streams and ponds only during the molting season, when they\r\ncan be allowed to run in large flocks and a small area of water will\r\nserve for all. For a time after the large inland duck farms were first\r\nestablished it was claimed by many that ducks grew faster when not\r\nallowed to swim than they did when allowed to follow their natural\r\ninclination to play in the water. No doubt some ducks which were in dry\r\nyards grew better than some having access to large bodies of water, and\r\non the whole as good ducks were grown on the inland farms as on those\r\nnear the water, but it has long been known that it is much easier to\r\nmanage the ducks when they have water in their yards. There are two\r\nreasons for this: in the first place, they are much more contented in\r\nthe water; in the second place, they feel very much safer on the water\r\nwhen anything alarms them, and will keep quiet on it when, if they could\r\nnot retreat to the water, they would rush about in a panic and many\r\nwould be injured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 138. Quarters for breeding stock on an inland duck\r\nfarm. Swimming tanks in the yards]\r\n\r\nDucks are very timid and easily panic-stricken. The duck grower has to\r\ntake every possible precaution to guard against disturbances of this\r\nkind, because ducks are so easily injured, and even if they are not\r\nhurt, a sudden fright will make them shrink a great deal in weight.\r\nVisitors who come merely out of curiosity are not desired on duck farms\r\nat any time, and none but those familiar with the handling of ducks are\r\never allowed to go about the farm without a guide who will see that the\r\nducks are not disturbed. Many visitors think that this is unreasonable,\r\nbut the duck grower knows that the mere presence of a stranger excites\r\nthe ducks, and that a person walking about might put a flock in a panic\r\nwhich would at once extend to other flocks, simply because he was not\r\nfamiliar enough with the ways of ducks to detect the signs of panic in a\r\nflock which he was approaching, and to stand still until they were\r\nquiet, or move very slowly until he had passed them. If a stranger,\r\nwalking between yards where there were five thousand ducks fattening,\r\nmade an unconscious movement that set the ducks in motion, the loss to\r\nthe grower could hardly be less than from five to ten dollars, and might\r\nbe very much more. Where such little things can cause so much trouble\r\nand loss, the difference between success and failure may lie in\r\npreventing them.\r\n\r\nOn a duck plant with a capacity of 50,000 ducks everything is on a big\r\nscale. Although ducks will stand more crowding than other kinds of\r\npoultry, it takes a large farm for so many. The buildings will cover\r\nmany thousands of square feet of land and, though of the cheapest\r\nsubstantial structure, will represent an investment of fifteen or twenty\r\nthousand dollars. Incubators, appliances, breeding stock, and supplies\r\non hand will amount to about as much. The incubator cellar will be\r\nseveral times as large as the cellar under the ordinary dwelling house.\r\nBefore the so-called mammoth incubators were made, the largest-sized\r\nmachines heated with lamps were used on all duck farms, and an incubator\r\ncellar would sometimes contain as many as seventy incubators having a\r\ncapacity of from 200 to 300 eggs each. Now many of the large farms use\r\nthe mammoth incubators, with a capacity of from 6000 to 18,000 eggs\r\neach. These mammoth incubators are really series of small egg chambers\r\nso arranged that the entire series is heated by pipes coming from a\r\nhot-water heater, instead of each chamber having an independent lamp\r\nheater as in the small, or individual, machines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 139. Feeding young ducks on farm of W. R. Curtiss &\r\nCo., Ransomville, New York]\r\n\r\nAs nearly all kinds of supplies are bought by the carload, and as stocks\r\nmust be kept up so that there will be no possibility of running short of\r\nfoodstuffs, a great deal of space is required for storage. Large\r\nquantities of ice are needed to cool the dressed ducks before shipping\r\nthem to market, so the farm must have its own ice houses and store its\r\nown supply of ice in the winter. For some years after duck farms grew to\r\nsuch large proportions, the mixing of mash was all done by hand, with\r\nshovels. Often one man was kept busy all day long mixing mash, and very\r\nhard work it was. Now the men on the large farms mix the food in big\r\ndough mixers, such as are used by bakers, and work that would take a man\r\nan hour is done in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nIn some sections the killing and dressing of the ducks is done by men\r\nwith whom duck picking is a trade at which they work during its season.\r\nIn others the killing is done by men, but the pickers are women living\r\nin the vicinity of the farm, who can be secured for this work whenever\r\nthey are needed. A farm that markets 50,000 ducks in a season will keep\r\na large force of pickers busy the greater part of the time for many\r\nmonths. Quite a large building is required to provide room for the\r\npickers to work in, for tanks for cooling 500 or more ducks at once, for\r\nspace for the men who pack them, and for lofts for drying the feathers\r\nbefore they are sold. This drying process must be used whether the birds\r\nare dry-picked or are scalded before the feathers are removed. Water on\r\nfeathers dries quickly, but the oil in the quills dries very slowly. The\r\nfeathers from one duck are worth only a few cents, and where small\r\nnumbers are grown the feathers are hardly worth the trouble of saving\r\nand curing. On a large plant the total product of feathers for a season\r\namounts to several thousand dollars, and it pays to provide facilities\r\nfor taking proper care of them.\r\n\r\nAfter the crop of ducks on an inland farm is marketed, the fences must\r\nbe removed and the land plowed and sowed with winter rye. This crop is\r\nused extensively for this purpose, because it is a gross feeder and\r\ntakes the impurities from the soil very fast, and also furnishes a good\r\nsupply of green food for the stock ducks during the winter and for the\r\nfirst young ducks put on the land in the spring. Where the farms are\r\nlarge enough, all ducks may be kept off a part of the land each year and\r\ncrops grown on it. The farms located at the waterside do not have to\r\nlook to the purification of the land so carefully, because the rains\r\nwash a great deal of the droppings away. Some of these farms get large\r\nquantities of river grass from the streams and cut it up to mix with the\r\nfood for the ducks.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUCK FANCIERS' METHODS\r\n\r\nThere are two general classes of duck fanciers: those who breed one or\r\nmore of the useful varieties for fine form and feather points, and those\r\nwho breed the ornamental varieties. Breeders of the latter class usually\r\nkeep other kinds of ornamental poultry also.\r\n\r\nThe methods of the fanciers of useful kinds of ducks compare with those\r\nof the practical growers who handle small numbers as do those of the\r\nfowl fancier with the methods of the poultry keeper who keeps a few\r\nfowls for his own use. In a general way they are the same, yet wherever\r\nit is necessary they are modified to secure the best possible\r\ndevelopment of the type. If a duck fancier has not a natural water\r\nsupply for his ducks, he either makes a small artificial pond or ditch\r\nor gives them water for bathing much oftener than the commercial duck\r\ngrower thinks is necessary. He also gives both old and young ducks more\r\nroom, and encourages them to take exercise, because this makes them\r\nstronger, more symmetrical, and better able to stand transportation and\r\nthe handling to which they are subjected when taken to shows. Most duck\r\nfanciers are also fanciers of fowls or of some other kind of poultry.\r\nThe competition in ducks is not nearly so keen as in fowls. Hence they\r\nare so much less interesting to a fancier that few are satisfied with\r\nthe sport that may be obtained from exhibiting ducks only.\r\n\r\nWhen the growing of green ducks for market began to be developed upon a\r\nlarge scale, many of those engaged in this line exhibited stock and sold\r\nbirds for breeding and eggs for hatching. They soon found that while the\r\nPekin Duck was unrivaled as a market duck, it was not of sufficient\r\ninterest to fanciers to excite the competition that creates high prices\r\nfor the finest specimens, and that it paid them better to devote\r\nthemselves exclusively to the production of market ducks. At the present\r\ntime only a few market duck growers make a business of selling breeding\r\nand exhibition stock. Most of them will not take small orders, but will\r\nfill large orders when they have a surplus of breeding stock and can get\r\na good price for it. On almost every large commercial duck farm there\r\nare hundreds of birds much better than most of the Pekin Ducks seen at\r\npoultry shows, and many better than the best exhibited. There is\r\nprobably no other kind of poultry in which so large a proportion of the\r\nfinest specimens are found on the plants of those producing for market.\r\n\r\nThe ornamental varieties of ducks are given much less attention in\r\nAmerica than they deserve. Few are seen except in large collections of\r\nfancy waterfowl, and sales from these collections are principally for\r\nspecial displays at shows. On many farms the Mallard, Call, and East\r\nIndian Ducks might be established and left to themselves, to increase in\r\na natural way, only enough being sold or killed to keep them from\r\nbecoming too numerous. If located in a suitable place, such a flock\r\nmakes a very attractive feature on a farm. The highly ornamental\r\nMandarin and Carolina Ducks, being able to fly quite as well as pigeons,\r\nmust be kept in covered runs. They will breed and rear their young in a\r\nvery small space. A covered run 6 ft. wide, 6 ft. high, and from 20 to\r\n30 ft. long, built in a secluded place and having a small shelter at one\r\nend, makes a very satisfactory place for a pair of ducks of any of the\r\nsmall breeds to live and rear their young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nGEESE\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople who are not familiar with animals often get wrong ideas of the\r\ncharacters of certain creatures from the popular metaphorical use of\r\ntheir names. Perhaps those who first applied these metaphors understood\r\nthem correctly, but after long use by people acquainted with the\r\nmetaphor but not familiar with the animal to which it relates, a part of\r\nthe meaning is likely to be lost. This is what has happened to the term\r\n\"goose\" as applied to a person. When one acts stupidly foolish about\r\nsome little thing he is often called a goose. Most people, associating\r\nthe idea of stupidity with the name of the goose, suppose that geese are\r\nvery stupid and uninteresting. If you will notice how the term \"goose\"\r\nis commonly applied to persons, you will discover that it is very rarely\r\nused except to apply to a person for whom the speaker has a great deal\r\nof affection. Under the same circumstances others are more likely to be\r\ndesignated by some harsher term. The most marked characteristic of a\r\ngoose is not stupidity but an affectionate disposition. The ancient\r\nEgyptians noted this, and in their hieroglyphic writing a goose stood\r\nfor \"son.\" The goose is a very intelligent and interesting bird. It is\r\nof a most social nature and becomes very much attached not only to its\r\nmates but to other animals and to people. No domestic animal except the\r\ndog develops so much affection for its master as a goose will if it is\r\npermitted to do so. But, while interesting in some ways, the goose has\r\nso little of the other qualities which lead man to make a companion and\r\npet of an animal, that its devotion is not usually encouraged.\r\nCommercially geese and ducks belong to the same class and are used in\r\nthe same way (the goose being preferred where size is desired), but in\r\nsome points of character, structure, and habits they are quite\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\n=Description.= In general appearance a goose resembles a duck so closely\r\nthat people not familiar with both often mistake large white ducks for\r\ngeese, but no one that knows either kind well is likely to make mistakes\r\nin the identity of any of the common varieties. While many of the small\r\ndomestic geese are no heavier than the largest ducks, geese are on the\r\naverage more than twice as large as ducks. Their legs are longer and\r\nmuch stronger. Their bills are larger at the juncture with the head and\r\nsmaller and more pointed at the tip. While ducks are usually very timid,\r\ngeese are bold, and this makes a marked difference in their attitude\r\nwhen approached and also in the carriage of their bodies. They are very\r\nstrong birds, quite able to defend themselves against the attacks of\r\nsmall animals and from annoyance by children. Indeed, they are very\r\nlikely to take an aggressive attitude toward persons or animals that\r\nthey regard as trespassers, and a large gander when angry is a dangerous\r\ncustomer. A blow from his wing might knock a child down or even break a\r\nsmall child's arm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 140. Emden Geese]\r\n\r\nThere are no regular distinguishing marks of sex in geese. The males\r\naverage larger than the females, but the difference is slight and some\r\nfemales may be larger than some males of the same breeding. In some\r\nforeign varieties, not known in this country, the males are mostly of\r\none color and the females of another, but as there are exceptions to\r\nthis rule, it is not reliable. In those varieties which have a knob on\r\nthe bill this is likely to be more prominent in the males. There is\r\nnothing in the form of the plumage to distinguish the male, like the\r\nlittle curl in the tail of the drake. The voices of males and females\r\nare so nearly alike that, while a difference may sometimes be noted in\r\nthe voices of birds known to be of different sexes, the voice is not a\r\nplain indication of the sex. There are some males so distinctly\r\nmasculine, and some females so distinctly feminine, in appearance and\r\nbehavior, that a person familiar with geese will not often make a\r\nmistake in identifying the sex by the general appearance. There are\r\nothers about which the most expert goose breeder is in doubt until the\r\nlaying season arrives and the production or nonproduction of eggs shows\r\nwithout doubt which birds are females and which are males.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 141. Toulouse Geese]\r\n\r\nThe name _goose_ is applied to either male or female without reference\r\nto sex, and also to the female as distinguished from the male. The male\r\nis called a _gander_. The young are called _goslings_. _Goose_ and\r\n_gander_ are the modern forms of Anglo-Saxon names.\r\n\r\n=Origin.= Our fully domesticated geese all originated in the Old World.\r\nThe European stock is believed to be derived from the Gray Lag Goose,\r\nwhich is still found in Europe in the wild state. The origin of the\r\ncurious name \"Gray Lag\" has been the subject of much speculation. The\r\nmost plausible theory is that which takes \"lag\" in its common meaning\r\nand supposes that the term was applied to this species of goose because\r\nit was slower in motion, or because it lingered longer in Northern\r\nEurope, than the less familiar species. As in the wild state the Gray\r\nLag Goose ranged over Europe and Northern Asia, it may have been\r\ndomesticated many times in many different places. Wild specimens may\r\nstill be brought into domestication, but there are no authentic reports\r\nof such cases. The Chinese breeds of geese, which will shortly be\r\ndescribed, are quite different in appearance from the European races,\r\nbut the difference does not necessarily show that they are of different\r\norigin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 142. Toulouse goslings three weeks old]\r\n\r\n=Common geese.= Throughout Europe and America the ordinary geese are of\r\nmuch the same type as their wild progenitor. They are a little heavier\r\nand coarser than the Gray Lag Goose, and have not its great power of\r\nflight, yet some of them can fly better than any other domestic poultry.\r\nThe author has seen flocks of common geese fly from a high hill over the\r\nroofs of tall buildings at its foot and alight in a stream fully an\r\neighth of a mile from where they started. It is perhaps needless to say\r\nthat they always walked home. Such geese were hard-meated and tough\r\nexcept when quite young. They were geese that picked the most of their\r\nliving where food was none too plenty. Well-kept stocks of common geese\r\nhave probably always been very good table poultry.\r\n\r\n=Improved races.= In various parts of Europe the common geese have\r\nsomewhat distinctive race characteristics. The Roman Geese are supposed\r\nto be the oldest distinct race. They differ from ordinary geese in that\r\nthe prevailing color is white, and they are more prolific layers. The\r\nPomeranian Goose, found throughout Germany and Southeastern Europe, is\r\nsomewhat larger. The female of this race is usually white, the male\r\nwhite with a gray back. Because of the peculiar markings of the male\r\nthis variety is sometimes called the Saddleback Goose. The Emden and\r\nToulouse Geese are very large. The Emden was developed in Germany, where\r\nit was at one time called the Brunswick Goose. The first specimens seen\r\nin America came from Bremen in 1826 and were called Bremen Geese. They\r\nhad been known in England for a long time and had become very popular\r\nthere under the name of \"Emden Geese.\" The name \"Bremen\" was used in\r\nthis country until about 1830, when the English name was adopted.\r\n\r\nThe Toulouse Goose is a very large gray goose which originated in a\r\ngoose-growing district in the vicinity of Toulouse in the South of\r\nFrance. It was introduced into England about 1840 and into America about\r\nfifteen years later.\r\n\r\nIn Russia gander fighting was from very ancient times a popular sport,\r\nand several varieties of geese were bred especially for their fighting\r\nqualities. The most common of these is the Tula Goose, which is usually\r\ngray in color but is sometimes clay-colored. The latter point is very\r\ninteresting for its bearing on the question of the common origin of the\r\nEuropean and Asiatic breeds of geese, to be discussed in the next\r\nparagraph. None of the Russian races of geese are known in this country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 143. White China Geese. (Photograph from Charles\r\nMcClave, New London, Ohio)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 144. Brown China Geese. (Photograph by E. J. Hall)]\r\n\r\nThe Asiatic races of geese probably came to America as early as the\r\nAsiatic races of fowls. They were early known in England under a variety\r\nof names, and were quite popular there over a hundred years ago as\r\nSpanish Geese. A writer in an agricultural paper in 1848 stated that he\r\nhad seen White China Geese in Virginia in 1817. It appears, however,\r\nthat the early introductions were immediately so mixed with the native\r\ngeese that the distinct type was lost, and that it was not until nearly\r\n1850 that the specimens were brought here from which the stocks now\r\nknown were produced. There are two varieties of the China Goose--White\r\nand Brown. They are smaller and more graceful than the improved European\r\nvarieties and are more prolific layers than any except perhaps the Roman\r\nGoose. They have a large knob on the head at its juncture with the upper\r\nmandible. Most of the geese of Europe are either white or gray\r\n(black-and-white). The red which appears to a slight extent as brown in\r\nthe Gray Lag Goose has been lost or so reduced that it is not noticed\r\nexcept in the Tula Goose, which is sometimes clay-colored. The colored\r\nvariety of the China Goose is distinctly brown. Hence, if they came from\r\nthe same wild species as the European geese, the red which was reduced\r\nin Europe was greatly increased in China. But if, as is not impossible,\r\nthey came from different wild species, a most interesting question\r\narises: The Chinese types and the European types are perfectly fertile\r\nwhen bred together. Would their wild ancestors (supposing them to have\r\nthe same characteristics) be equally fertile? Unless we can find a wild\r\nancestor for the Chinese type, all that we know of the relations of\r\ndomestic races points to the conclusion that they, like the European\r\nraces, are descended from the Gray Lag Goose.\r\n\r\nThe variety known as the African Goose is a larger and coarser type of\r\nthe Brown China, and is probably obtained by crossing with the Toulouse\r\nor by selection from mixed flocks. Nothing definite is known of the\r\norigin of this type, but to any one familiar with the stock in the\r\ngoose-growing district of Rhode Island, and with the breeding methods of\r\nthe farmers there as applied in the development of the Rhode Island Red\r\nfowl, it appears probable that African Geese came from this district.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 145. African Geese on a Rhode Island farm]\r\n\r\n=Ornamental varieties.= There are two ornamental varieties of domestic\r\ngeese and quite a number of species of wild geese that are kept in\r\ncollections of fancy waterfowl. The Sebastopol Goose evidently belongs\r\nto the common domestic species. It is about the size of the common\r\ngoose, is white in color, and has a peculiar development of some of the\r\nfeathers of the body and wings, this development of the plumage giving\r\nthe variety its ornamental character. A number of feathers on the back\r\nof this bird are long and twisted, as if they had been loosely curled,\r\nand lie in a wavy mass on the back and rump. The Egyptian Goose is the\r\nsmallest domestic goose. It is unlike other domestic geese in being\r\nquite gaudy in color. It is found in the wild state and also in\r\ndomestication in many parts of Africa. Sebastopol and Egyptian Geese are\r\nrare in this country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 146. Sebastopol Geese on an English farm]\r\n\r\n=The Canada Goose, or American Wild Goose.= Few persons in America have\r\nnot at some time seen a flock of wild geese flying in wedgelike\r\nformation as they migrate in the spring and fall. Their honking can\r\noften be heard when they cannot be seen. Hunters watch for these flocks\r\nand, when they are flying low, sometimes shoot them as they pass, but\r\nthe favorite method of hunting wild geese is to induce them to approach\r\na hunter concealed where he can get a better shot at them. For this kind\r\nof hunting, shooting stands are built near bodies of water where wild\r\ngeese may alight in their passage. These stands are either concealed in\r\nthe bushes or masked by green boughs. In order to bring near the stands\r\nany wild geese that may alight of their own accord, and also to attract\r\nany flying by, captive wild geese are used as decoys. At first the birds\r\nused for this purpose were those crippled but not killed by the hunters\r\nand kept in confinement. As the supply secured in this way was small,\r\nand as the wild birds bred readily in captivity, the breeding of wild\r\ngeese for decoys soon became quite common in districts where the\r\nshooting of this kind of game was good. The wild geese will mate with\r\ndomestic geese, producing a sterile hybrid called a mongrel goose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 147. A pet Canada gander. (Photograph from George E.\r\nParrett)]\r\n\r\n=Place of geese in domestication.= In ancient Egypt and Rome the goose\r\nwas a sacred bird, not an object of worship but reserved for the use of\r\nthe priests, who keenly appreciated the advantage of having a monopoly\r\nof the use of the best domestic table bird then in existence. In later\r\ntimes, until the turkey was introduced, goose was the favorite kind of\r\npoultry for festal occasions all through Europe. Then it lost some of\r\nits popularity in those places where turkeys were extensively grown. In\r\nGermany, Austria, and Russia there is still a very large production of\r\ngeese. In this country geese are grown in small numbers by a few persons\r\nin almost every community. The feeding and flocking habits of geese\r\nespecially adapted them to the conditions under which they were kept\r\nwhen stock of all kinds was allowed to run at large and to feed on\r\ncommon or unoccupied land in charge of a gooseherd. As towns grew, and\r\nas people became less tolerant of the trespassing of live stock, the\r\ngrowing of geese in towns declined. Nearly all the geese now produced in\r\nthis country come from flocks on general farms. The production of geese\r\non farms has been restricted to some extent by the abundance and\r\ncheapness of turkeys. As turkeys become scarce and dear in any locality\r\nthe production of geese seems to increase. From early times geese have\r\nbeen prized for their feathers. So valuable have these been considered\r\nthat it has been a practice to pluck the live geese each year before\r\nthey molted. Public opinion now condemns this barbarous practice, and\r\npersons plucking live geese are sometimes punished for cruelty to\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 148. Mongrel Geese on a Rhode Island farm]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF GEESE\r\n\r\n\r\nGeese will bear confinement well if given proper attention, but they\r\nrequire such large quantities of succulent green food that it does not\r\npay to grow them where they cannot secure most of this by foraging. Very\r\nfew people who keep geese in inclosures too small to furnish them with\r\ngood pasture can conveniently supply them with all the green food that\r\nthey need. Hence no one engages in growing geese in close quarters for\r\nprofit. Many, however, grow a few geese under such conditions because of\r\nthe interest a small flock affords. Goose growing cannot be developed on\r\nintensive lines as duck growing has been. One obstacle to this is the\r\ndifficulty of supplying green food under such conditions. Another is\r\nthat the average egg production is small. The description of the\r\nmanagement of geese on farms will show more fully why this branch of\r\npoultry culture is likely always to be restricted to general farms.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALL FARM FLOCKS\r\n\r\n=Size of flock.= On the ordinary farm, where only a few dozen geese are\r\ngrown each year, a flock of one male and from two to four females gives\r\na sufficient number of breeding birds. It is more difficult to get a\r\nstart with geese than with fowls or ducks, because a young gander will\r\noften mate with only one goose, and an old gander separated from mates\r\nto which he has become attached may be very slow about establishing new\r\nfamily relations. An experienced goose grower does not expect to get\r\nvery good results the first season that a flock of breeding birds are\r\ntogether. On the other hand, a flock once harmoniously mated does not\r\nhave to be renewed every year or two. As long as the old birds are\r\nvigorous the entire product of young may be sold each season without\r\nreducing the producing capacity of the flock. The average gander is past\r\nhis prime after he is six or seven years old, but geese are often good\r\nbreeders until ten or twelve years old. Occasionally a goose lives to a\r\ngreat age. There are reliable accounts of geese breeding well when over\r\ntwenty years old. Some stories of geese living to more than eighty years\r\nof age have been widely circulated, but little credence is to be given\r\nsuch tales; people who originate them and suppose that they are true do\r\nnot know how difficult it would be to make sure of the identity of a\r\ngoose through so long a period.\r\n\r\n=Houses and yards.= Geese, like ducks, prefer to live in the open air,\r\nand do not often voluntarily take shelter from any element but heat. It\r\nis customary to provide a small shelter which they may use if they wish.\r\nIn most cases it is not necessary for a farmer to make a yard especially\r\nfor geese. The permanent fences or walls between the divisions of the\r\nfarm will usually keep geese in the pasture allotted to them. The best\r\nplace for geese is a marshy meadow in which some parts of the surface\r\nare elevated enough to be quite dry at all seasons. These places afford\r\nmore comfortable resting places when the birds tire of the wet land.\r\nThey also furnish different kinds of grass from those growing on very\r\nwet land. On many farms there are tracts of land much more suitable for\r\ngeese than for any other live stock. Cattle and hogs sometimes cut up\r\nsuch land very badly, destroying the vegetation on it and making it\r\nunsightly. Such a piece of land is sometimes a part of a pasture used\r\nfor cattle. In that case it may be a good plan to fence the cattle from\r\nthe soft ground with a wire or rail fence, which keeps them out of the\r\npart reserved for the geese, yet allows the geese the range of the whole\r\npasture. A small number of geese in a large pasture will not hurt the\r\npasture for cattle or horses. Too many geese in a pasture spoil the\r\ngrass for themselves as well as for other stock. Even when cattle have\r\naccess to all parts of a pasture in which there are geese, a small space\r\nshould be inclosed for a feeding pen, where food for the geese will be\r\nout of the reach of other stock. This is especially necessary during the\r\nbreeding season, when they usually require extra food.\r\n\r\n=Feeding.= A flock of geese in a good pasture need no other food except\r\nat the breeding season or when they are being fattened. If there is any\r\ndoubt about the pasturage being sufficient, a small trough or box\r\ncontaining grain of any kind that it is convenient to give them should\r\nbe put where they can eat what they want. When there is snow on the\r\nground, they should have a little grain and all the cabbage, beets,\r\nturnips, or other vegetables they want.\r\n\r\n=Laying season and habits.= Geese usually begin to lay in February or\r\nMarch. As many nests should be provided as there are geese, for while\r\ntwo or more geese sometimes lay peaceably in the same nest, it is more\r\nlikely that each goose will want one to herself. A barrel placed on its\r\nside in a secluded place makes a good nest. Geese are sometimes very\r\nnotional about the location of the nest and, neglecting one provided for\r\nthem, may choose a spot right out in the open or in some place where the\r\nnest is not well protected. When they do this, it is a good plan to\r\nplace over the nest, without disturbing it, a large box with a hole cut\r\nin one end for passage. Geese, like ducks, lay very early in the\r\nmorning. When they begin laying while the weather is cold, the person\r\nwho has charge of them must be up early and get the eggs before they are\r\nchilled. A goose usually lays from twelve to eighteen or twenty eggs and\r\nthen goes broody. The common practice is to set the first lot of eggs\r\nunder hens, and keep the goose away from her nest until she shows no\r\ninclination to sit. She may then be allowed access to the nest and\r\nbefore long will begin laying again. As a rule the second lot of eggs\r\nwill be fewer in number than the first. When the goose goes broody the\r\nsecond time, it is as well to set her, for if stopped again she may not\r\nresume laying. Occasionally a goose lays for a whole season without\r\ngoing broody.\r\n\r\n=Hatching and rearing goslings.= In hatching goose eggs under hens the\r\nhens are managed in just the same way as if they had hen eggs. Each hen\r\nis given four or five eggs, according to the size of the eggs and the\r\nsize of the hen. A goose must be set in the nest where she has been\r\nlaying. If she is inclined to be very cross if approached while sitting,\r\nshe should be left to herself as much as possible, care being taken that\r\nnothing can molest her. With the help of the gander a goose can defend\r\nher nest against almost anything likely to attack it, but some eggs\r\nwould probably be broken in the fray.\r\n\r\nThe period of incubation is from thirty to thirty-five days. The\r\ngoslings sometimes chip the eggs two days before completing the process.\r\nThey should be left in the nest until they begin to run about. Then, if\r\nthey are with a goose mother, they may safely be left to the care of the\r\nold ones, and may not even need to be fed. The early goslings with hen\r\nmothers should be placed on sod ground where the grass is fine and soft,\r\nin coops such as are used for little chickens, with a small pen in front\r\nof each coop to keep them from wandering away. This pen may be made of\r\nboards 8 or 10 inches wide, set on edge and kept in place by small\r\nsticks driven into the ground. It is best to give them only grass to eat\r\nthe first day. After that two or three light feeds of mash may be given\r\ndaily, but they should always have all the fresh, succulent green food\r\nthat they can eat. The coops and pens should be moved as often as is\r\nnecessary to secure this end. The goslings should also be constantly\r\nsupplied with drinking water. They will appreciate a bath occasionally.\r\n\r\nGoslings grow very rapidly. In from ten to fourteen days they are so\r\nlarge that they no longer need the hen mother and she may be taken away.\r\nAt this stage several broods may be combined and the flock allowed the\r\nrun of any place where it can graze unmolested. A shelter should be\r\nprovided for protection from the sun, and a roomy coop with a dry floor\r\nto keep them in at night. If allowed to do so, they would stay out and\r\ngraze at intervals during the night, but the owner will sleep more\r\ncomfortably if he is sure that nothing can disturb them. Although very\r\nbig babies, they are quite soft and helpless at this stage. When six\r\nweeks old a gosling is nearly half-grown. Young goslings that were\r\nstarted with hen mothers may then be put into the pasture with the old\r\ngeese. When ten or twelve weeks old they will be almost as large as the\r\nadult birds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 149. Goslings three or four days old]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 150. Goslings three weeks old]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 151. Goslings nine weeks old]\r\n\r\nIn growing geese on the farm the most important thing is to provide good\r\npasture. Grass is not only the most economical food, but it is the best\r\nfood. Geese will grow and fatten on grass without grain, but will not\r\nfatten as quickly or be as firm-fleshed. To fatten for market they\r\nshould be confined for from ten to twenty days before they are to be\r\nkilled, and fed all that they will eat of some very fattening food. Corn\r\nsoaked in water until it is soft is an easily prepared food and a very\r\ngood one.\r\n\r\n\r\nLARGE FLOCKS OF GEESE ON FARMS\r\n\r\nThe most important goose-growing district in the United States is that\r\npart of Rhode Island where the colony system of egg farming is used.\r\nThis district is well adapted to goose growing. The winters are not\r\nsevere, and the birds can have grass almost the year round. The breeding\r\ngeese are often kept in pastures occupied by hens and cattle, but there\r\nare also many small ponds and marshy places used exclusively for geese.\r\nThe absence of foxes makes it possible to keep them in fields a long way\r\nfrom the farmhouses, and for this reason many spots are used for geese\r\nwhich in other districts would be too exposed. The large flocks of hens\r\nin this district give an abundance of sitters to hatch the early\r\ngoslings. As the person who looks after the sitting hens and the young\r\nchickens on one of these farms has to give the greater part of his time\r\nto that work for several months in the spring, he can often use the\r\nremaining time to best advantage by hatching and rearing a few hundred\r\ngoslings. So a large proportion of the farms which specialize in eggs\r\nalso specialize in geese.\r\n\r\nThe numbers grown on a farm vary from 100 to 500, the average being\r\nbetween 200 and 300. To produce this average number, flocks of 15 or 20\r\ngeese and 4 or 5 ganders are kept. A flock of this kind does not mate\r\nmiscellaneously, as a similar flock of ducks would. It is composed of as\r\nmany families as there are ganders, and if the pasture is large, these\r\nfamilies will remain separate a great deal of the time.\r\n\r\nThe method of handling the geese on these farms differs from the\r\nordinary farm method in that the work is done more systematically and\r\nmore attention is given to the goslings while growing. They are grazed\r\neach year on new grassland. Most of them are sold unfatted, as soon as\r\nthey are of full size, to men who make a business of fattening and\r\ndressing them.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOSE-FATTENING FARMS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 152. Goslings grazing on a Rhode Island farm]\r\n\r\nMarket duck growing is conducted on so large a scale that each grower\r\ncan employ expert pickers and sell his product directly to wholesale\r\ndealers in poultry. So the duck grower fattens his own ducks before\r\nkilling them. It is natural for him to do this, too, because his method\r\nof fattening is a modification of the feeding process which he has used\r\nfrom the start. As he nears the end of his process of feeding, he simply\r\nincreases the proportion of fat-forming material in the food and feeds\r\nall that the ducks will eat. The fattening of geese that have been grown\r\non grass to make them of the quality that will bring the highest price\r\nrequires a change to a heavy grain diet. The farmers who grow these\r\ngeese could fatten them better than any one else and make more profit on\r\nthem, but few of these farmers are willing to give them the special\r\nattention that this requires. So large a part of the geese sold alive\r\nare thin that the men who bought them to dress for market long ago saw\r\nan opportunity to make a greater profit by fattening them before they\r\nwere killed. Some of those who engaged in fattening geese were very\r\nsuccessful and made large profits. As they extended operations in this\r\nline they required a great deal of land. Sometimes as many as 15,000\r\ngeese are fattened on one farm in a season. The fatteners buy in the\r\nearly part of the summer from the farmers who sell the green geese as\r\nsoon as they are grown. As these make the finest geese for the table,\r\nand as the best demand for geese comes at the holiday season in the\r\nwinter, a large part of them are put in storage after being killed.\r\nAfter the green geese are disposed of, the fatteners buy live geese\r\nshipped in from distant points, and have them ready to kill about the\r\ntime when the demand for goose is good.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 153. Scene on a goose-fattening farm in England]\r\n\r\nWhile they are very profitable when everything goes well, fattening\r\ngeese is a business attended by heavy risks. In buying from many\r\ndifferent sources a fattener may get some geese having a contagious\r\ndisease, and the infection may spread through his whole flock before he\r\ndiscovers it, for some diseases have no pronounced symptoms in their\r\nearly stages. Keeping such large numbers of geese on the same land year\r\nafter year also brings trouble through the pollution of the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROWING THOROUGHBRED GEESE FOR EXHIBITION\r\n\r\nThe proportion of thoroughbred geese among those grown for market is\r\nvery small. Most of the geese on farms are grades produced by crossing\r\nthoroughbred or high-grade males on the old unimproved stock. This gives\r\na type of goose which is much better than the old common goose but not\r\nnearly as large as the heavy Emden and Toulouse Geese. The intermediate\r\nsize is, however, large enough to meet the general market demand. The\r\nproduction of thoroughbred geese is carried on to supply stock of medium\r\nquality for the farmers who want to maintain a good grade of stock, and\r\nto supply exhibition birds of the best quality for the relatively small\r\nnumbers of fanciers and breeders of standard-bred stock. The usual\r\nmethod of growing exhibition geese is to keep only one breed on a farm,\r\nand to manage them as ordinary geese are managed, except that, to secure\r\nthe best possible development, the breeder is more careful than the\r\naverage farmer is to provide abundant pasture and all the grain that the\r\nbirds can use to advantage. Occasionally several breeds of geese are\r\nkept on a farm, but most breeders consider one enough.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROWING A FEW GEESE ON A TOWN LOT\r\n\r\nOld geese are so noisy that they are undesirable inhabitants for\r\npopulous places. In such a place a poultry keeper who wants to grow a\r\nfew geese often finds it satisfactory to buy eggs for hatching and\r\neither dispose of the goslings as green geese when three months old or\r\neat one as he wants it until all are gone. The only difference in\r\nhandling goslings in close quarters and on farms is in the method of\r\nproviding the green food. On the farms the birds graze; on the town lot\r\nthey must be fed very abundantly with succulent food. They will eat\r\nalmost any vegetable leaf that is young and not too tough, and they\r\nshould have such food almost constantly before them. Most people who try\r\nto grow geese in a small space injure them by feeding too much grain. If\r\nthey have had no experience in this line, they suppose, quite naturally,\r\nthat birds so much alike as the goose and the duck, both in outward\r\nappearance and in the texture and flavor of the flesh, require the same\r\ndiet. When we compare the duck, which lives so largely on grain and\r\nmeat, with the goose, which makes greater growth in the same period on\r\ngrass alone, we can begin to appreciate what large quantities of bulky\r\ngreen food the goose needs to accomplish so remarkable a result.\r\n\r\nWhile the growing of geese in bare yards is not recommended as a paying\r\nventure, every one interested in poultry should grow a few occasionally\r\nfor observation.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROWING WILD GEESE IN CAPTIVITY\r\n\r\nWild geese mate in pairs. If they are to be bred successfully in\r\ncaptivity, they must have a place away from other animals, where they\r\nwill not be disturbed. They will be more contented if located near a\r\nsmall pool or stream. A pair of wild geese is usually kept during the\r\nbreeding season in a small, isolated inclosure containing a permanent\r\nwater supply. Here the female will make her nest, lay her eggs, and\r\nhatch her brood. The male at this period is very savage and will\r\nvigorously resent any interference with his mate. Most wild geese in\r\ncaptivity lay but a few eggs, and the broods hatched are small. There\r\nare seldom more than five or six goslings in a brood. After the young\r\nare hatched, the parents may be allowed to leave the inclosure with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTURKEYS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe turkey is commonly considered the best of birds for the table, the\r\nmost desirable for any festive occasion, and quite indispensable on\r\nThanksgiving Day. It is the largest bird grown for its flesh. As usually\r\nfound in the markets, geese and turkeys are of about the same weight,\r\nbecause most people, when buying a large bird for the table, want those\r\nthat, when dressed, weigh about ten or twelve pounds; but the largest\r\nturkeys are considerably heavier than the largest geese, and the\r\nproportion of extra large birds is much greater among turkeys.\r\n\r\n=Description.= A dressed turkey and a dressed fowl are quite strikingly\r\nalike in shape. The most noticeable difference is in the breast, which\r\nis usually deeper and fuller in a turkey. The living birds are\r\ndistinctly unlike in appearance, the carriage of the body and the\r\ncharacter and expression of the head of the turkey being very different\r\nfrom those of the fowl. The head and upper part of the neck are bare,\r\nwith a few bristly hairs. The bare skin is a little loose on the head\r\nand very much looser on the neck, forming many small folds, some of\r\nwhich are sac-like. It varies in color from a livid bluish-gray to\r\nbrilliant scarlet. An elongated, trunklike extension of the skin at the\r\njuncture of the beak with the head takes the place of the comb in the\r\nfowl. There is a single wattle under the throat, not pendent from the\r\njaw, as in the fowl, but attached to the skin of the neck. The feathers\r\non the lower part of the neck are short, and the plumage of the whole\r\nbody is closer and harder than that of most fowls. The wings are large.\r\nThe tail spreads vertically and is usually carried in a drooping\r\nposition. This, with the shortness of the feathers of the neck, makes\r\nthe back of the turkey convex. The usual gait of the bird is a very\r\ndeliberate walk.\r\n\r\nThe male and female differ conspicuously in so many points that the sex\r\nof an adult bird is distinguished without difficulty. As a rule the\r\nmales are much larger than the females of the same stock. In colored\r\nvarieties the males are more strongly pigmented, and the shades of color\r\nin them are more pronounced. The head characters of the male are much\r\nmore prominent in size and more brilliant in color. Both sexes have the\r\npower of inflating the loose appendages of the head and neck. In the\r\nmale this is highly developed; in the female only perceptible. The male\r\nhas a brushlike tuft of coarse hair growing from the upper part of the\r\nbreast. This tuft, called the beard, is black in all varieties. The\r\nfemale is usually shy and has a low, plaintive call. The male challenges\r\nattention and often struts about with his tail elevated and spread in a\r\ncircle like a fan, wings trailing on the ground, the feathers all over\r\nthe body erected until he looks twice his natural size, and at frequent\r\nintervals vociferously uttering his peculiar \"gobble-gobble-gobble.\" The\r\nmale turkey has short spurs like those of the male fowl.\r\n\r\nThe name _turkey_ was erroneously given in England when the birds were\r\nfirst known there and it was supposed that they came from Turkey. The\r\nadult male is called a _turkey cock_, also a _tom-turkey_ (sometimes\r\nsimply _tom_) and a _gobbler_. The adult female is called a _turkey\r\nhen_, or a _hen turkey_, the order of the terms being immaterial. Young\r\nturkeys before the sex can be distinguished are variously called _young\r\nturkeys_, _turkey chicks_, and _poults_, the latter being considered by\r\npoultrymen the proper technical name. After the sex can be\r\ndistinguished, the terms _cockerel_ and _pullet_ are applied to turkeys\r\nin the same way as to fowls.\r\n\r\n=Origin.= The turkey is a native of North America. Although not as\r\nwidely distributed as before the country was settled, it is still found\r\nwild in many places. It was domesticated in Mexico and Central America\r\nlong before the discovery of the New World. Domesticated stock from\r\nthese places was taken to Spain and England early in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and was soon spread all over Europe. The domestic stock of the\r\ncolonists in the United States and Canada came from Europe with the\r\nother kinds of domestic poultry. It is probable that from early colonial\r\ntimes the domestic stock was occasionally crossed by wild stock, but we\r\nhave no information about such crosses until after the Revolutionary\r\nWar. From the earliest published statements in regard to the matter it\r\nwould appear that such crosses had long been common, and that the\r\nbenefits of vigorous wild blood were appreciated by the farmers of that\r\ntime. The wild turkey is about as large as a medium-sized domestic\r\nturkey but, being very close-feathered, looks smaller. It is nearly\r\nblack, and the bare head and neck are darker in color than in most\r\ndomestic birds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 154. Common turkeys on a New England farm]\r\n\r\n=Common turkeys.= The turkey is not so well adapted to domestication as\r\nthe fowl, duck, and goose. Under the conditions to which they have\r\nusually been subjected domestic turkeys have lost much of the vigor of\r\nthe wild stock. As far as is known, the birds taken to Europe after the\r\ndiscovery of America were black or nearly black. In Europe white sports\r\nappeared and were preserved, and the colors became mixed--black, white,\r\ngray of various shades, brown, and buff. That has been the character of\r\nmost flocks in this country until quite recent times, and many such\r\nflocks are still found.\r\n\r\n=Improved varieties.= The development of the domestic turkey is unique\r\nin that the most marked improvement in domestic stocks has been due to\r\nextensive introductions of the blood of the wild race. The reason for\r\nthis is indicated in the statement in the preceding paragraph, in regard\r\nto the lack of adaptation of the turkey to the ordinary conditions of\r\nlife in domestication. The turkey deteriorates where the other kinds of\r\npoultry mentioned would improve. So, while in Europe a few color\r\nvarieties were made, and in some localities both there and in America\r\nlocal breeds of special merit arose, on the whole the domestic stocks\r\nwere degenerate. The distinct color varieties were the Black, the White,\r\nand the Gray, but by no means all turkeys of these colors were well-bred\r\nbirds. The color varieties were crudely made by the preference of\r\nbreeders in a certain locality for a particular color. They were impure\r\nand often produced specimens of other colors because of the occasional\r\nuse of breeding birds unlike the flock. In early times it was the almost\r\nuniversal opinion that crossbred stock had more vitality than pure-bred\r\nstock. Hence farmers, although preferring a certain type of animal,\r\nwould often make an outcross to an entirely different type, and then by\r\nselection go back to the type of their preference. When this mode of\r\nbreeding is adopted, undesirable colors may appear for many years after\r\na bird of a foreign variety has been used in breeding.\r\n\r\nThe local European breeds that gained a wide reputation were the Black\r\nNorfolk, the Cambridgeshire Bronze, and the White Holland. Black and\r\nWhite turkeys were perhaps quite as popular and as well established in\r\nother places as in those mentioned. Black turkeys were the most common\r\nkind in Spain and in some parts of France. In some other parts of\r\nFrance, and in parts of Germany and Austria, White turkeys were the most\r\nnumerous, but in general the turkeys of Europe and America were of\r\nvarious colors, with gray predominating.\r\n\r\nIn the United States a local breed of very good quality was developed in\r\nRhode Island about the middle of the last century. It appears to have\r\nbeen known at first as the Point Judith Bronze Turkey, and also as the\r\nNarragansett Turkey, but the first name was soon dropped and has long\r\nbeen forgotten by all but those familiar with the early literature. The\r\nNarragansett Turkey was not bronze as the term is now applied to\r\nturkeys; it was a dark, brownish-gray, which is doubtless the reason why\r\nthe name was changed after the distinctly bronze turkeys became well\r\nknown. Although the Narragansett Turkey is described in the American\r\nStandard, and prizes are still offered for it at some shows, the type\r\nhas almost disappeared.\r\n\r\n=Bronze turkeys.= The accidental crossing of wild with tame turkeys\r\nproduced, in the domestic flocks where such crosses occurred, many\r\nspecimens of exceptional size and vigor, in which the blending of the\r\ncolors of the wild turkey with the gray of the domestic birds gave rise\r\nto a very beautiful type of coloration. It was neither black nor brown\r\nnor gray, but contained all these shades and had an iridescent bronze\r\nsheen. As the crosses which produced these were only occasional, the\r\nwild blood being reduced in each generation removed from it, the bronze\r\ntype was usually soon merged with and lost in the common type. As the\r\nwild birds became scarce, crosses were rare, and what improvement had\r\nbeen accidentally made was in danger of being lost, when the awakening\r\nof interest in all kinds of poultry stirred turkey growers to more\r\nsystematic efforts for the improvement of domestic stock by crossing\r\nwith the wild stock. Those who were able to do so captured wild birds\r\nand bred them in captivity, producing both pure wild and half-wild\r\nstock. They also secured the eggs of wild birds and hatched and reared\r\nthe young with tame hens. With wild stock under control, they were able\r\nto use as much wild blood as they desired in their flocks, and soon\r\nfixed and improved the bronze type until they had a variety of turkeys\r\nthat were extremely hardy, larger than the wild race or any domestic\r\nstock that had hitherto been produced, and also more attractive in\r\ncolor. The name \"Bronze\" was soon applied exclusively to this type of\r\nturkey in America. In England they are called American Bronze, to\r\ndistinguish them from the Cambridge Bronze, which seems to be very\r\nnearly a duplicate of the Narragansett.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 155. White Holland Turkey cock. (Photograph by E. J.\r\nHall)]\r\n\r\nThe evolution of the Bronze Turkey in America is one of the most\r\ninteresting things in poultry culture. The work was done on a very large\r\nscale. It was not just a few breeders that engaged in grading up\r\ndomestic turkeys with wild blood, but a great many scattered all over\r\nthe country. Many, remote from places where wild turkeys ranged, paid\r\nhigh prices for full-blooded wild males, and also for grades with a\r\nlarge proportion of wild blood. In this way the wild blood was very\r\nwidely distributed. As the superiority of the bronze type became\r\nestablished, turkey growers everywhere bought Bronze males to head their\r\nflocks, and so in a remarkably short time Bronze Turkeys of a type much\r\nsuperior to the old domestic stock became the common turkeys in many\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 156. Flock of White Holland Turkeys]\r\n\r\nInterest in the American Bronze Turkey arose in England at a very early\r\nstage of this development. In fact, there is some reason to believe that\r\nthe publicity given to several early shipments of small lots of wild\r\nturkeys to France and England did more than anything else to direct the\r\nattention of breeders in this country to the value of systematic\r\nbreeding to fix the characters which wild blood introduced. The most\r\ncelebrated of these shipments was one taken to France by Lafayette on\r\nhis return from his last visit to the United States in 1825. About this\r\ntime, or earlier, an English nobleman, who had some American wild\r\nturkeys, presented his sovereign with a very fine horse. The king,\r\ninstead of expressing pleasure with the gift, intimated that he would\r\nprefer some of the wild turkeys, and was accordingly presented with a\r\npair. The use of wild blood to give greater vigor to domestic stock\r\ncontinues, though it gives no better results now than the use of\r\nvigorous Bronze Turkeys many generations removed from wild ancestry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 157. Bronze Turkey cock. (Photograph by E. J. Hall)]\r\n\r\n=Influence of the Bronze Turkey on other varieties.= Although White\r\nturkeys have long been very popular in some parts of Europe, in this\r\ncountry they were, until recently, considered too weak to be desirable\r\nfor any but those who kept them as a hobby. By chance mixtures of Bronze\r\nand White turkeys, and in some instances by systematic breeding, white\r\nturkeys that were large and vigorous were produced. Some of these were\r\nlarge enough to be called mammoths, as the largest Bronze Turkeys were.\r\nA few breeders who had these big white turkeys advertised them as\r\nMammoth White Turkeys produced by Mammoth Bronze Turkeys as sports and\r\nin no way related to the old, weakly white birds. But whatever may have\r\nbeen the case at the outset, in a few years the Mammoth Whites were so\r\nmixed with others that the distinction was lost, for the best buyers of\r\nsuperior white turkeys were those who liked the color and had inferior\r\nstock which they wished to improve. All white turkeys in America now go\r\nby the old name, \"White Holland Turkeys.\"\r\n\r\nYellow or buff turkeys were often seen among the old common turkeys.\r\nThey were usually small and very poor in color. The mixture of bronze\r\nturkeys with these birds occasionally produced larger birds of a\r\ndarker, more reddish buff but very uneven in color, with the tail and\r\nwings nearly white. From such birds, by careful breeding, a dark red\r\nrace with white wings and tail was made. This variety is called the\r\nBourbon Red, from Bourbon County, Kentucky, where it originated.\r\n\r\n=Other varieties of the turkey.= The only other variety worthy of\r\nmention here is the Slate Turkey. Birds of this color are often seen in\r\nmixed flocks. Some of very good size and color have been bred for\r\nexhibition, and the Slate Turkey in America is classed as a distinct\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 158. Bourbon Red Turkeys. (Photograph from owner,\r\nC. W. Jones, Holmdel, New Jersey)]\r\n\r\n=Place of the turkey in domestication.= In discussing the history of the\r\nturkey in domestication much has been said of the influence of\r\nconditions on the type and on the vitality of this bird. The case of the\r\nturkey is peculiar, because it seems as capable of being tamed as the\r\nfowl, the goose, or the duck, yet does not thrive under the conditions\r\nin which it would grow tame. It is peculiarly sensitive to the effects\r\nof soil which has been contaminated by the excrement of animals, and so\r\ninstinctively avoids feeding places on which other animals are numerous.\r\nThus it requires a large range and, if permitted to follow its\r\ninclination, spends most of its time at a distance from the homestead.\r\nThe successful growing of turkeys depends upon the watchfulness of the\r\ncaretaker and the absence of their natural enemies. This will appear\r\nmore clearly when the methods of managing them are described in the next\r\nchapter. Turkey culture is not well adapted to the more intensive\r\nmethods of farming which become necessary after the first fertility of\r\nthe land has been exhausted. Hence the turkey has almost disappeared\r\nfrom many places where turkey growing was once an industry of\r\nconsiderable importance. The farms of the Central West and the mountain\r\nregions of Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee have for\r\nmany years produced most of the turkeys consumed in this country, but\r\nthe changing conditions in these regions seem unfavorable to the\r\nincrease of turkey culture. Attempts to grow turkeys on a large scale\r\nhave been made on the Pacific coast. While these may succeed for a time,\r\nturkey culture in this country is likely to decline rapidly unless\r\nchanges in economic conditions afford cheaper labor on farms, or unless\r\nthe natural enemies of poultry are so reduced that flocks of turkeys may\r\nbe kept in a half-wild state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF TURKEYS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe turkey is almost exclusively a farm product. It is possible to grow\r\na few good turkeys in confinement, but this is rarely done except in\r\nexperimental work or by persons who grow a few for amusement and for an\r\nopportunity to study some of their characteristics. A few adult turkeys\r\nmay be kept on a small farm and remain about the homestead as other\r\npoultry does. The turkeys themselves may get along very well, but they\r\nare likely to abuse the fowls, and as they can easily fly over any\r\nordinary fence, they cannot be controlled except by putting them in\r\ncovered yards. Turkeys kept under such conditions cause so much trouble\r\nthat, after the novelty of watching them has worn off, the owner soon\r\ndisposes of them. It is where the farms are large and there is a great\r\ndeal of woodland and pasture through which the turkeys may roam without\r\nstrict regard to farm boundaries, and large grain and grass fields where\r\nthey can forage after the crops are removed, that turkeys in large\r\nnumbers are grown for market with good profit. On such farms, too, the\r\nfarmer, if he is a good breeder, can produce the finest exhibition\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\n=Size of flocks.= The number of turkeys kept on a farm for breeding\r\nusually depends upon the number of young it is desired to rear, but the\r\ndifficulty of keeping more than one adult male with the flock tends to\r\nrestrict the annual production to what can be reared from one male.\r\nExperience has taught that it is not advisable to have more than ten or\r\ntwelve females with one male. Sometimes a much larger number is kept\r\nwith one gobbler, and the eggs hatch well and produce thrifty poults;\r\noftener an excess of females is responsible for poor results which the\r\nbreeder attributes to other causes. The average hen turkey lays only\r\neighteen or twenty eggs in the spring. Some hens lay even less. Once in\r\na long time a turkey hen lays continuously for many months. A turkey\r\ngrower who raises eight or ten turkeys for each hen in his breeding\r\nflock does very well. To do much better than this the hatches must be\r\nexceptionally good and the losses very light. Those who grow turkeys for\r\nprofit expect them to pick the most of their living from the time they\r\nare a few weeks old until they are ready to fatten for market. A grower\r\nwill, therefore, rarely undertake to hatch more young turkeys than he\r\nthinks can find food on the available range. It takes a very large farm\r\nto provide food for a hundred young turkeys and the old birds which\r\nproduced them, after the young ones are well started. On many large\r\nfarms where turkeys are grown regularly, not more than seventy or eighty\r\nare ever hatched, and if losses are heavy, not more than two or three\r\ndozen may be reared. A farmer who grows from seventy to a hundred\r\nturkeys is in the business on a relatively large scale. Flocks of larger\r\nsize are sometimes seen in the fall, but not very often. The ordinary\r\nfarm flock of breeding turkeys rarely has less than three or four or\r\nmore than ten or twelve hens.\r\n\r\n=Shelters and yards.= The wild turkey living in the woods, with only\r\nsuch shelter from the rigors of Northern winters as the trees afford, is\r\nperfectly hardy. Domestic turkeys are most thrifty when they roost high\r\nin the open air yet are not fully exposed to storms and cold winds. If\r\nleft to themselves they usually select convenient trees near the farm\r\nbuildings, or mount to the ridge of a shed or a barn, or perch on a high\r\nfence. A high perch to which they can mount by a succession of easy\r\nflights has such an attraction for them that it is a common practice to\r\nplace strong perches between trees that are near together, or on tall,\r\nstout poles set for the purpose, where other trees or buildings form a\r\nwindbreak. The turkeys, if at home, will not fail to go to such a roost\r\nas night approaches. One of the most important tasks of the person who\r\nhas charge of a flock of turkeys is to see that the flock is at home\r\nbefore nightfall.\r\n\r\nAfter they begin to roost, young turkeys need no shelter in the spring\r\nand summer. When chilly nights come in the fall, late-hatched turkeys\r\nmay do better housed than in the open. Turkeys that are well grown and\r\nfully feathered do not need to be under cover in the winter except in\r\nprotracted or very severe storms. Turkey growers who wish to have the\r\nbirds partially under control, and want to be able to catch any one when\r\nthey need it, often have the birds roost in a shed or other outbuilding\r\navailable for the purpose. Such places should be very well ventilated,\r\nor the turkeys will become soft and take colds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 159. House and yards for stock turkeys on a\r\nCalifornia ranch. (Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry, United\r\nStates Department of Agriculture)]\r\n\r\nYards are made for turkeys only to enable the person in charge of them\r\nto keep them under control when necessary. The principal uses of the\r\nyards are to confine the hens at the laying season and to separate birds\r\nfrom the general flock when there is any occasion for this. A great deal\r\nof trouble is sometimes saved by having a small yard for such purposes.\r\nThe height of fence required depends on the size and weight of the\r\nturkeys and also upon whether they are in the habit of flying. A turkey\r\nthat is not accustomed to fly may not attempt to go over a fence four or\r\nfive feet high that has no top upon which it could alight. The same\r\nbird, when confined in a strange place, might, without hesitation, fly\r\nto a roof twice as high, because, although not in the habit of flying,\r\nit has the power to fly such a distance and can see that the roof offers\r\na suitable place for alighting. A turkey in the habit of flying over\r\nobstacles will often go over a fence six or seven feet high without\r\ntouching. A turkey hen that is laying will not fly as freely as one that\r\nis not, because the weight and bulk of the eggs in her body encumber her\r\nmovements. For this reason a five-foot fence is usually high enough for\r\na yard for breeding stock, if they are to be confined to it only as much\r\nas is necessary in order to make sure that the hens will lay at home.\r\n\r\n=Feeding.= The natural diet of the turkey, like that of all birds of the\r\norder of _Scratchers_, consists of a variety of vegetable and animal\r\nfoods. Turkeys eat the same things that fowls eat, and apparently in\r\nabout the same proportions, but their foraging habits are quite\r\ndifferent. The disposition of the fowl is to dig for its food wherever\r\nit appears that anything is to be had by scratching. The turkey will\r\nscratch a little, but it prefers to wander over the land, picking up the\r\nfood that is in sight. Fowls will forage from their house to the limits\r\nof their usual range and return many times in the course of a day. A\r\nflock of turkeys, if allowed to do so, leaves its roosting place in the\r\nmorning and makes a wide circuit, often returning home in the afternoon\r\nfrom a direction nearly opposite to the direction they took in the\r\nmorning. On their circuit, which is likely to follow the same course day\r\nafter day, turkeys have their favorite feeding and resting places.\r\nPersons familiar with the route of a flock can tell where they are\r\nlikely to be found at any hour of the day. If food becomes scarce on\r\ntheir circuit, the turkeys extend it, or go on an exploring expedition\r\nwhich takes them a long way from home. If night overtakes them at a\r\ndistance from home, they look for a convenient roosting place and remain\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 160. Turkey roost in shelter of barn on a Rhode\r\nIsland farm]\r\n\r\nThe feeding habits of the turkey make it especially valuable for\r\ndestroying grasshoppers and other insects that damage field crops. To\r\nget an adequate idea of the great quantities of insects destroyed by a\r\nflock of turkeys, and of the waste food that they save and turn to\r\nprofit by eating it, one should take careful note of the amount of food\r\nconsumed when the turkeys are fed all that they can eat at one time (as\r\nwhen they are being fattened), and from this compute the amount that a\r\nflock must pick in order to live, as many flocks do, from spring until\r\nfall almost wholly upon what they get by foraging. Turkeys are much more\r\nsystematic foragers than fowls, working more in concert. A flock\r\nadvances in an irregular yet orderly formation, taking all the choice\r\nfood in its way, but not often tempted to side excursions which would\r\ndisperse the flock.\r\n\r\nMany people who keep turkeys make a practice of feeding a little grain,\r\nusually corn, in the evening as an inducement to them to come home. When\r\nthey require more food, they may be given whatever is fed to the fowls.\r\nIndeed, unless some arrangement is made by which the fowls and turkeys\r\nare fed separately, the turkeys may get the habit of being on hand when\r\nthe fowls are fed, and drive them from the food. This, however, is most\r\nlikely to happen when the range for the turkeys is so restricted that it\r\ndoes not afford good picking.\r\n\r\n=Breeding season and laying habits.= Experienced growers of turkeys like\r\nto get their young turkeys hatched about the time when settled weather\r\nmay be expected in the spring. Little turkeys are less rugged than\r\nlittle chickens, and are very sensitive to cold, damp weather. Although\r\nthe hens may have been very domestic all winter, when they begin to lay\r\nthey develop more of a roving disposition than is at all satisfactory to\r\ntheir keeper. They are very likely to want to hide their nests. When\r\nthis is the case, and there is no yard in which they may be confined,\r\nthey make a great deal of trouble. They often go a long way from home to\r\nfind places for their nests, and make such wide circuits, and double on\r\ntheir tracks so often in going and returning, that the nests are very\r\nhard to find. There is nothing to do in such cases but to confine the\r\nturkey or to follow her day after day until the nest is found. If she is\r\nto be confined, it should be done as soon as she indicates that she does\r\nnot intend to take one of the nests provided or to make one at home.\r\nWhen, in spite of efforts to prevent it, a turkey hen makes a nest at a\r\ndistance and has laid some eggs in it before the nest is discovered, it\r\nis best to allow her to continue to lay there, but the eggs should be\r\nremoved as soon as laid. The egg of a turkey is about twice as large as\r\na hen's egg. The usual color is a light, slightly bluish, brown, with\r\nsmall spots of a darker shade.\r\n\r\n=Hatching and rearing.= Turkey eggs are often incubated by fowls. A\r\nfowl will hatch the eggs just as well as a turkey hen, and may make as\r\ngood a mother for a few turkeys grown on a small place. For young\r\nturkeys grown on the farm, turkey hens make the best mothers, because\r\nthey take them to better foraging ground and remain with them all the\r\nseason. It is a good plan, especially when there are more turkey eggs\r\nthan the turkey hens can cover, to set some fowls on the surplus eggs at\r\nthe same time that the turkey hens are set. Then, as there will rarely\r\nbe a full hatch from all nests, the young turkeys hatched by the fowls\r\nwill fill up the broods of the turkey mothers. A fowl will cover from\r\nseven to nine turkey eggs. As a rule it is better to give the smaller\r\nnumber. A turkey hen will cover from twelve to fifteen of her own eggs,\r\nor even a larger number, but the young turkeys will be stronger if the\r\nnest is not too full. The period of incubation is four weeks. Even when\r\nnormally strong and healthy, little turkeys appear weak in comparison\r\nwith lively young chickens and ducks or the more bulky goslings. They\r\nmay be fed the same as young chickens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 161. Sheltered turkey nest. (Photograph from the\r\nBureau of Animal Industry, United States Department of Agriculture)]\r\n\r\nIt is the common practice to confine the mother to a coop from which the\r\nlittle turkeys can go to a small pen placed in front of it. The pen may\r\nbe made of wide boards placed on edge, or of light frames covered with\r\none-inch-mesh wire netting. The coop and pen should be moved before the\r\ngrass becomes much trampled and soiled. The little turkeys can be kept\r\nin such an inclosure for only about a week or ten days. As they\r\nincrease in size, and as their wings grow, they fly over low obstacles\r\nas easily and naturally as little chickens scratch or as little ducks\r\nswim. Having once flown out of the pen, they cannot be kept in it or in\r\nany inclosure that has not a high fence or a cover. When only two weeks\r\nold, little Bronze Turkeys have been seen flying to the top of a\r\nfive-foot fence and, after a few efforts, reaching it with seeming ease.\r\nNo matter how contented old turkeys that produced them may have been in\r\nconfinement, young turkeys become restless as soon as their wings and\r\nlegs are strong, and, unless prevented from doing so, will begin to roam\r\nlong distances. They do not wait for the mother, whether fowl or turkey,\r\nto take the initiative and lead them. If she is not disposed to rove,\r\nthey start and let her follow. A turkey hen quickly catches their spirit\r\nand goes with them and keeps them together; a fowl is likely to follow\r\nthem reluctantly, allow them to scatter, and lose a part of the brood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 162. Turkey brood coop. (Photograph from the Bureau\r\nof Animal Industry, United States Department of Agriculture)]\r\n\r\nWhen the little turkeys have reached this stage, the best plan of\r\nmanaging them depends upon circumstances. If there is little danger of\r\nenemies disturbing them, they may be given a light feed in the morning\r\nand then allowed to forage where they please, the person in charge\r\nlooking occasionally to see that they do not go too far and, if\r\nnecessary, bringing them back or starting them off in another direction.\r\nIn case of a sudden, hard shower the turkeys must be looked up, and if\r\nany have been caught out in the rain and have been chilled and wet,\r\nthey should be warmed and dried at once. The usual way to do this is to\r\nwrap the bird in a piece of old flannel and place it in an oven at a\r\ntemperature of about 100 degrees, or near a stove. If this is done\r\npromptly, a bird that seemed to be nearly dead from wet and cold may be\r\nrunning about as well as ever in an hour. A large part of the losses of\r\nlittle turkeys is due to lack of attention in matters of this kind, or\r\nto delaying it until the injury cannot be fully repaired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 163. Turkey hen with brood. (Photograph from the\r\nBureau of Animal Industry, United States Department of Agriculture)]\r\n\r\nAfter the young turkeys are five or six weeks old, they do not need such\r\nclose watching. They are now so well feathered that their plumage sheds\r\nrain, and if they are thrifty, a little wetting will not hurt them. It\r\nis at this age that the symptoms of the disease called _blackhead_ begin\r\nto appear, if it is present, and the turkeys pine away and die one by\r\none. Blackhead is a contagious liver disease which affects fowls as well\r\nas turkeys, but is most fatal to young turkeys, because it is a filth\r\ndisease; as has been said, turkeys are especially sensitive to foul\r\nconditions, and the young of all kinds of poultry are more sensitive to\r\nsuch conditions than the adults. The germs of the disease pass into the\r\nsoil with the excrement of affected birds and may remain there for\r\nseveral years. Young birds feeding on land containing these germs may\r\ntake up some with their food. If the birds are vigorous and thrifty and\r\nthe land is not badly infected, no harm may be done, but if the birds\r\nare weakly and the land is so badly infected that they are constantly\r\ntaking up more germs, the disease soon develops in acute form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 164. Driving turkeys to market in Tennessee.\r\n(Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry, United States Department\r\nof Agriculture)]\r\n\r\nMany people suppose that if once they have serious trouble with this\r\ndisease, it is useless for them to try to grow turkeys, but this is an\r\nerror. The germs of the disease are destroyed by cultivating the land\r\nand exposing them to the sun and air. Three or four years of cultivation\r\nwill rid a piece of land of disease germs, no matter how badly it is\r\naffected. The infection is not usually distributed in dangerous\r\nquantities all over a farm or all over the land on which the turkeys and\r\nfowls have ranged. It is principally on the land near the farm\r\nbuildings. There would be very little danger from diseases of this kind\r\non farms if those who feed the poultry would make it a practice to\r\nscatter food on clean grass or cultivated ground at a little distance\r\nfrom the buildings, instead of giving it (as too many do) on ground that\r\nis bare year after year and never cultivated.\r\n\r\nOn a large farm the turkeys should not require close attention after\r\nthey are two months old. A little food may be given to them in the\r\nmorning and again in the evening, to keep them familiar with the person\r\nin charge, and if they are inclined to stray too far, they should be\r\nrounded up soon after noon and started toward home. Having started in\r\nthat direction, they may be left to come at their leisure. They should\r\npick the most of their living until the time comes to begin to fatten\r\nthem. Beginning about three weeks before they are to be killed, they\r\nshould be fed two or three times a day all the whole corn they will eat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nGUINEAS\r\n\r\n\r\n=Description.= The guinea, or guinea fowl, is about the size of a small\r\nfowl. It is very much like the fowl in some respects but not at all like\r\nit in some others. Naturalists classify it in the pheasant family, but\r\nits present place in domestication is so different from that of the\r\npheasant that a poultry keeper hardly ever associates them in his\r\nthought. In appearance the guinea is a unique bird. The shape of the\r\nbody and shape of the head are both peculiar. The body is quite plump,\r\nthe back nearly horizontal, and the tail short and much depressed. The\r\nneck and legs are rather short. The feathers of the neck are short, and\r\nthe head is bare. The skin of the head and face is a bluish-white. The\r\nbird has a small, knoblike red comb and short, stiff, red wattles\r\nprojecting from the cheeks. The plumage of the body is quite long,\r\nloose, and soft, and lies so smoothly that it appears much shorter and\r\ncloser than it is.\r\n\r\nThe male and female are of nearly the same size, and so like in\r\nappearance that the sex cannot be distinguished with certainty by any\r\nexternal character. The comb and wattles of the male are sometimes\r\nconspicuously larger than those Of the female, but this difference is\r\nnot regular. Although the voices of the male and female are different,\r\nthe difference is not easily described, nor is it readily detected\r\nexcept by people who are familiar with the birds, and whose ears are\r\ntrained to distinguish the different notes. Both sexes make a rapid,\r\nsharp, clattering sound, and also a shrill cry of two notes. The cry of\r\nthe male is harsher and has a more aggressive tone; that of the female\r\nhas a somewhat plaintive sound, which some people describe as like the\r\nwords \"come back, come back.\"\r\n\r\nThe name \"guinea\" comes from the country of Guinea in Africa, from\r\nwhich the birds were introduced into America and Western Europe. The\r\nmale guinea fowl is called a guinea cock; the female, a guinea hen; the\r\nyoung, guinea chickens.\r\n\r\n=Origin.= The guinea fowl is a native of Africa. It is said that there\r\nare about a dozen similar species on that continent. This species is\r\nabundant there in both the wild and the domesticated state, and also in\r\na half-wild state. It was probably brought into partial domestication at\r\na very early date, for it was known to the ancient Greeks and Romans, as\r\nwell as to the early civilized nations of Northern Africa. It may have\r\nbeen distributed through Western Europe by the Romans. According to one\r\naccount, some English monks had guineas in the thirteenth century. It is\r\nlikely that they were rare in Europe at that time and soon disappeared,\r\nfor the modern Europeans had never seen them until they were taken to\r\nEurope from the West Indies, where, it is said, they had been brought by\r\nslave ships from Africa. There is a tradition that the first guineas in\r\nAmerica were brought direct from Africa with the first cargo of slaves\r\nfrom that continent. In the West Indies and in South America the guinea,\r\nafter its introduction, ran wild. The natural color of the species is a\r\nbluish-gray with many small, round white spots on each feather. On the\r\nflight feathers of the wings these spots are so placed that they form\r\nirregular bars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 165. White guinea fowls]\r\n\r\n=Varieties.= The only change that has taken place in the guinea in\r\ndomestication is the production of color varieties. White sports from\r\nthe original variety, which is called the Pearl Guinea, were developed\r\nas a distinct variety. Crosses of White and Pearl Guineas produced birds\r\nwith white on the neck, the breast, and the under part of the body.\r\nThese are called Pied Guineas, but are not regarded as a distinct\r\nvariety. Birds with the original white markings but with the color very\r\nmuch lighter and sometimes of a decidedly reddish tinge have also been\r\nproduced by crossing. These are not considered a distinct variety, but\r\nare sometimes exhibited as such under the name of \"Lavender Guineas.\"\r\nSome of the older works on poultry describe the Self-Colored Guinea, a\r\ngray bird without white spots, and the Netted Guinea, in which the\r\noriginal colors are reversed. The author has never seen these varieties,\r\nnor has he found any mention of them in the works of later writers.\r\n\r\n=Place in domestication.= The guinea is as eccentric in nature and\r\nhabits as it is unique in appearance. It is an ill-tempered bird, very\r\npugnacious, and persistently annoys any other birds with which it comes\r\nin contact. While inclined to be shy of man and to resent his control,\r\nit likes to establish itself between wild and domestic conditions, where\r\nit is independent yet enjoys the safety from its enemies that proximity\r\nto the habitations of man affords. The hens are very prolific layers.\r\nThis characteristic is said to be as well developed in the wild as in\r\nthe domestic stock. Although they lay so well, they are not usually\r\nconsidered desirable for egg production, because the eggs are small and\r\nit is hard to keep the birds under such control that the eggs are easily\r\nsecured. The flesh and skin of the guinea are quite dark in color. The\r\ndressed carcass is not at all attractive in appearance, but the meat is\r\nvery good. Many people prefer it to the flesh of the fowl.\r\n\r\nThe guinea is not really a domestic bird. It is possible to keep a few\r\nin confinement and to rear the young with other poultry, but the adult\r\nbirds are so noisy and vicious that very few people want them near the\r\nhouse or with other poultry. They would not be tolerated as much as they\r\nare but for the traditional notion that their noisy clamor keeps hawks\r\naway. Many farmers keep a few guineas, supposing that they are of\r\nservice in this way. Those who have tried to find out whether the noise\r\nof the guinea really has any effect on hawks say that the hawks are just\r\nas bad where there are guineas as where there are none.\r\n\r\nThe only way that guineas can be made profitable is by treating them as\r\nhalf-wild birds--letting them establish themselves in the woods where\r\nthey can maintain themselves--and then shooting or trapping a part of\r\nthe flock each season. The number of guineas now produced in this way is\r\nsteadily increasing in many parts of the United States where the winters\r\nare not severe and where wild animals which prey upon game birds are\r\nkept in subjection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 166. White guinea hen with brood]\r\n\r\n=Management of domestic guineas.= As has been stated, guineas are so\r\nhard to control that few persons try to keep them in close quarters or\r\nwhere they must have particular attention. When a few birds are kept on\r\na farm, they are usually allowed to wander at will; the owner secures as\r\nmany of their eggs as he can find before they spoil, and perhaps hatches\r\na few of them under hens, for the guinea hens often lay a long time\r\nwithout going broody. As they are prone to hide their nests and are very\r\nclever in eluding observation, it not infrequently happens that, when a\r\nnest is found, it contains a great many eggs, a large part of which\r\nhave been spoiled by long exposure to the weather.\r\n\r\nThe first care of the breeder of these birds is to see that he has\r\nsuitable proportions of males and females. Guineas are disposed to mate\r\nin pairs. Some poultry keepers who have observed them closely say that\r\nwhile one or more extra females may associate with a pair, the eggs of\r\nthe extra females do not usually hatch well. Occasionally it happens\r\nthat a small flock are all males or all females, and the owner does not\r\nfind it out until too late in the season to get a bird of the missing\r\nsex. When a supposed guinea hen does not lay in the breeding season, the\r\nowner often thinks that she lays but manages to completely baffle his\r\nsearch for the nest.\r\n\r\nThe period of incubation for guinea eggs is four weeks. The young birds\r\nmay be managed the same as young turkeys while small, but do not need as\r\nclose watching to keep them from wandering away. Those that are hatched\r\nand reared by fowls are tamer than those reared by guinea hens, but are\r\nnot so hardy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nPEAFOWLS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe peacock, or male peafowl, when matured and in full plumage, is the\r\nmost gorgeous of birds. Many smaller birds are more brilliant in color.\r\nMany birds of various sizes and types have beautiful or interesting\r\ncharacters as attractive as those which distinguish the peacock. But\r\nthis bird surpasses them all in attractiveness, because in it are\r\ncombined in the highest degree size, beauty of form, beauty of color,\r\nand the power of displaying its beauties to the greatest advantage.\r\n\r\n=Description.= The adult peacock is so much more striking in appearance\r\nthan the females and the young males, and old males are so often\r\nexhibited alone, that many persons suppose that the peafowl are\r\ndistinctly unlike other domestic birds. The size, shape, and carriage of\r\nthe peacock sometimes suggest to them a resemblance to the turkey\r\ngobbler, but the peacock's most striking characters seem so peculiar to\r\nit that the attention of the observer is usually fixed upon them, to the\r\nexclusion of direct comparisons with other creatures. When, however, one\r\nsees a flock containing several females, or males in which the\r\ncharacteristic plumage is not yet developed, the general resemblance\r\nbetween peafowl and turkeys is immediately noticed. The peafowl is\r\nsmaller, slenderer, and more graceful than the turkey, and is a little\r\nmore agile in motion. But if there were no old males present to identify\r\nthe species, to which they belong, a person who was not familiar with\r\npeafowls, seeing a flock for the first time, would be almost certain to\r\nthink that they were turkeys of a rare breed. Notwithstanding this\r\nstriking general likeness, a close observer will soon note that in\r\nnearly every conspicuous character the differences between the two\r\nindicate that they belong to entirely different species. The voice of\r\nthe peafowl is a harsh, piercing scream.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 167. Indian Peacock. (Photograph from the New York\r\nZooelogical Society)]\r\n\r\nThe development of the plumage in the male at full maturity is like that\r\nof the fowl and of some pheasants. In all of these species in which the\r\ntail of the male assumes a highly decorative form, it is not the tail\r\nproper that is so developed, but the tail coverts and other feathers of\r\nthe back, which in the male are long and flowing. In the peacock these\r\nfeathers are very remarkably developed, both in form and in color. The\r\nlargest are sometimes a yard long. The stem, or shaft, is a marvelous\r\ncombination of lightness and strength. For the greater part of the\r\nlength of the shaft the barbs are so far apart that they do not form a\r\nweb, but make a fringe on each side. Toward the tip of the feather the\r\nbarbs are closer together, and at the extremity they form a broad web.\r\nThe feathers of this structure growing next to the main tail feathers\r\nare the longest. The next are a little shorter, and thus the length\r\ndiminishes until the shortest coverts are only a little longer than the\r\nordinary feathers of the back. This feather formation is called the\r\ntrain. The train of the peacock is the most prominent peculiarity of\r\nthe species, but there is also in both sexes another uncommon feather\r\ncharacter--the curious little tuft, or crest (called the aigret), which\r\ngrows on the head.\r\n\r\nThe surface color of the peacock is a marvelous blending of purples,\r\ngreens, golds, and bronzes of various hues. On the head and neck purple\r\ntints predominate. The train is mostly green with large, eyelike spots,\r\nor spangles, at the tip of each feather. The plumage of the female is a\r\nsoft brown on the body, darkest on the back and shading to nearly white\r\non the abdomen. The brown often shows slight tints of purple and green.\r\nThe neck and throat are a purple-green; much less intense than the\r\ncoloring on the male. The young males are colored like the females until\r\nthey molt in their second year. Then they become much darker, but it is\r\nnot until the next molt, in their third year, that they grow the\r\ncharacteristic train and take on the brilliant coloration which is their\r\ngreatest attraction.\r\n\r\nThe wild peafowls in different parts of Asia vary somewhat in color and\r\nare sometimes thought to be of different species, but they are evidently\r\nall varieties of the same species. Specimens of all are seen in\r\ndomestication. One variety is almost black. Domestic life has had little\r\nif any effect upon the type of peafowls. A white variety has been\r\nproduced, and from the mixture of this with the green variety, birds\r\nthat are partly white are sometimes obtained.\r\n\r\nThe significance of the terms \"fowl,\" \"cock,\" \"hen,\" and \"chick,\" or\r\n\"chicken,\" in combination with the \"pea\" in the name of this bird is, of\r\ncourse, perfectly plain. Those who seek further meaning in the first\r\nsyllable are puzzled until they consult the dictionary and find that the\r\nthree letters as they occur here are not the word \"pea,\" but a\r\ncontraction of _pawa_, which was an Anglo-Saxon corruption of _pavo_,\r\nthe Latin name of the bird. While the original meaning of the name is\r\nnot known, the word came into the Latin language from the Greek, into\r\nwhich it had previously come from the Persian. Hence, the history of\r\nthe name indicates that the distribution of the peafowl was along much\r\nthe same lines in Europe as the distribution of the fowl.\r\n\r\n=Origin.= The peafowl is supposed to be a native of Java and Ceylon. It\r\nis found throughout Southern Asia and is said to be very numerous in\r\nIndia and Ceylon, both in the wild state and in a half-domestic state.\r\nIt was known to the Jews in the time of Solomon, and to all the ancient\r\ncivilized peoples of Western Asia, Europe, and Africa at a very early\r\nperiod. In the days of the Roman Empire a peacock served with the\r\nfeathers on[12] was a favorite dish at the feasts of wealthy Romans, and\r\nthis mode of serving the bird was continued in Western Europe for many\r\ncenturies. At what time they were introduced into that part of the world\r\nis not known, but it is probable that they were distributed to the\r\nvarious countries soon after the Roman conquests. Nor is anything known\r\nof their first introduction into America. It is, however, quite\r\nreasonable to suppose that some were brought here at an early date by\r\nwealthy colonists.\r\n\r\n[12] Of course the bird was not cooked with the feathers on, but was\r\nskinned, the feathers remaining in the skin, and after the flesh was\r\ncooked the skin with the feathers was placed over it before it appeared\r\non the table. Skinning poultry instead of plucking the feathers seems to\r\nhave been quite a common practice in old times. As recently as between\r\n1880 and 1890 the author heard of people who preferred it as the easiest\r\nway of preparing chickens to be cooked immediately.\r\n\r\n=Place in domestication.= In Europe and America the peafowl is now bred\r\nonly for ornamental purposes. That seems to be its status even in the\r\nAsiatic countries, where it is most abundant, and its position has\r\nprobably been much the same in all lands and in all ages. The use of\r\nfully developed peacocks for food at banquets was simply a display of\r\nbarbarous extravagance. Although a young peafowl is very good eating, a\r\nmale old enough to have acquired its full plumage would be hard, tough,\r\nand unpalatable. The peafowl is not prolific enough to be a profitable\r\ntable bird, and is too desirable for its beauty to be used for any other\r\npurpose. In this country peafowls are not common. Very few are seen\r\nexcept in zooelogical collections and at the principal poultry shows. The\r\nscarcity of peafowl is not due wholly to the expense of procuring them\r\nor to the difficulty of rearing them. Indeed, neither of these\r\nconstitutes a serious drawback to their popularity. The peafowl is its\r\nown worst enemy in domestication. It has a very savage disposition\r\ntoward smaller birds, and in this way usually makes itself an\r\nintolerable nuisance to those who grow other poultry. Many owners of\r\nlarge farms, who do not keep turkeys, or who keep only a small flock,\r\nmight maintain a small stock of peafowl with very little trouble.\r\nAlthough they are so vicious when brought in close contact with smaller\r\npoultry, they will flock and forage by themselves if they have room to\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\n=Management.= The methods of managing turkeys apply at nearly every\r\npoint to the management of peafowl. The peafowl matures more slowly and\r\ndoes not breed so early. The females are not fit for breeding until two\r\nyears old; the males not until three years old. They do not pair, but\r\nmate in small polygamous families--one male with from two to four\r\nfemales. The peahen usually lays from four to six eggs--rarely more than\r\neight or ten. The period of incubation is four weeks. Young peachicks\r\nare very bright and active. They begin to fly when only three or four\r\ndays old. If they are to be kept in an inclosure while very small, the\r\nsides must be high or the top must be covered with wire netting.\r\nAlthough so active, they are less independent than most young poultry,\r\nand follow the mother closely until she drives them from her at the\r\napproach of the next breeding season. Peahens are preferred as mothers,\r\nbecause their disposition is to keep their young with them much longer\r\nthan a turkey or a fowl does. Next to the peahen a turkey hen makes the\r\nbest mother for peachicks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nPHEASANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe guinea and the peafowl were described as closely related to the\r\npheasants, and as of limited usefulness to man both because of their\r\nugly dispositions and because of their roving habits. The species of\r\npheasants that are best known are a little farther removed from\r\ndomestication by their extreme shyness, and have often been excluded\r\nfrom lists of domestic birds; yet it is quite possible that some of them\r\nmay become of much greater economic importance in America than either\r\nthe guinea or the peafowl.\r\n\r\n=Description.= The most common kinds of pheasants are about the size of\r\nsmall domestic fowls, but have rounder, plumper bodies. There are also\r\nother characteristic differences. The head of a pheasant, except a part\r\nof the face around the eye, is usually feathered. This bare skin, called\r\nthe wattle, is red in most species, but in a few it is purplish. The\r\nfeathers of the neck are short, and the tail is depressed. Some of the\r\nrarer kinds of pheasants are as large as medium-sized fowls.\r\n\r\nPheasants as a class are distinguished principally for their brilliant\r\nplumage. In most species the male alone has showy coloring, the females\r\nbeing very sober hued. In some species the male has a very long tail,\r\ncorresponding to the train of the peacock; in some the tail is wide and\r\nheavy, as well as quite long; in others the males are feathered like the\r\nfemales.\r\n\r\nThe name \"pheasant\" comes from the name of the river Phasis in Colchis,\r\nat the eastern end of the Euxine Sea. The term \"fowl\" is not used in\r\nconnection with \"pheasant,\" but the words \"cock,\" \"hen,\" and \"chicken\"\r\nare used as in other cases that have been mentioned.\r\n\r\n=Origin.= The pheasants are all natives of Asia, where nearly all known\r\nkinds are found in the wild state. They are well distributed over that\r\ncontinent, and are found in localities differing greatly in climate and\r\nin the character of the soil and of the vegetation. Some species live\r\nmostly at low altitudes; others are peculiar to high mountain regions.\r\nAccording to an old Greek legend the first pheasants known in Europe\r\nwere brought to Greece by the Argonauts on their return from the\r\nexpedition in search of the Golden Fleece. A more probable story is that\r\nwhich says that they were introduced in the time of Alexander the Great.\r\nPheasants were reared in confinement for food by the Greeks and the\r\nEgyptians, and also later by the Romans in Italy. Both the rearing and\r\nthe use of pheasants in those times seem to have been limited to the\r\nvery wealthy. From Greece and Italy they were gradually distributed all\r\nover Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 168. Ringneck Pheasant[13]]\r\n\r\n[13] Figs. 168-172 are from photographs of mounted specimens in the\r\nNational Museum, made to illustrate \"Pheasant Raising in the United\r\nStates,\" _Farmers' Bulletin No. 390_ of the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture.\r\n\r\n=History in America.= The history of pheasants in America is much more\r\nfully known than that of most kinds of poultry. The first importation of\r\nwhich there is a record was made by an Englishman named Bache, who had\r\nmarried a daughter of Benjamin Franklin. In England at that time\r\npheasants were propagated, as they are to-day, in a half-wild state in\r\ngame preserves, and Mr. Bache expected that those which he imported and\r\nreleased on his estate in New Jersey would soon become established\r\nthere. In this he was disappointed. Others who subsequently tried the\r\nsame plan met with no better success. For a long time the only pheasants\r\nknown in this country were those grown in confinement by fanciers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 169. Mongolian Pheasant]\r\n\r\nThe first successful attempt to establish pheasants at liberty on this\r\ncontinent was made in Oregon with pheasants brought direct from China.\r\nThe United States consul at Shanghai sent some Ringneck Pheasants to\r\nOregon in 1880. As most of these died on the way, a second shipment was\r\nsent in the following year. In all about forty birds were liberated. The\r\nshooting of pheasants was prohibited by law in Oregon until 1892, when\r\nthe stock had become so widely distributed and so well established that\r\nshooting them was allowed for a short season. So numerous were the\r\npheasants at this time that on the first day of this open season about\r\n50,000 were shot by the hunters. In many other states efforts have since\r\nbeen made, both by state game commissions and by private enterprise, to\r\nacclimatize pheasants and establish them as game birds. Some of these\r\nefforts have been quite successful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 170. Amherst Pheasant]\r\n\r\n=Species and varieties.= The relationships of the various kinds of\r\npheasants are not positively known. Some kinds that are undoubtedly\r\nvarieties of the same species are commonly classed as different species.\r\nThe best-known of these so-called species interbreed freely. The rare\r\nkinds have not been sufficiently tested, either with common kinds or\r\nwith one another, to show whether they are species or merely varieties.\r\nThe European pheasants, descended from the stocks which came in early\r\ntimes from Western Asia, are called by various names--Common Pheasant,\r\nDarknecked Pheasant, English Pheasant, and Hungarian Pheasant. Two kinds\r\nof pheasants, of the same type but having more distinctive color\r\nmarkings, have in recent times been brought from Eastern Asia. One of\r\nthese is commonly called the Ringneck Pheasant, but the names \"China\r\nPheasant,\" \"Mongolian Pheasant,\" and others are also applied to it. The\r\nsecond variety, also called Mongolian Pheasant, is said by some\r\nauthorities to be the only one to which the name \"Mongolian\" properly\r\napplies. It is not quite like the Ringneck, but, like it, has a white\r\nring around the neck. From Japan still another bird, called the\r\nVersicolor Pheasant, or Japanese Versicolor Pheasant, very similar in\r\ntype, was brought to England. These three varieties from Eastern Asia\r\nhave been mixed with the European pheasants to such an extent that there\r\nare now very few pheasants of the type common in Europe before their\r\nintroduction, and good specimens of the oriental races are equally rare.\r\nThe principal English variety at the present time is a Ringneck produced\r\nfrom the mixture. This is called the English Pheasant; in England it is\r\nalso sometimes called the Common Pheasant. The birds that breed at\r\nliberty in the United States are mostly of the Ringneck type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 171. Manchurian Pheasant]\r\n\r\nAlthough they are very beautiful birds, the pheasants thus far mentioned\r\nappear plain in comparison with the Silver and the Golden Pheasants\r\n(which are the most common of the highly ornamental varieties) and the\r\nReeves and Amherst Pheasants. These are the kinds most often seen in\r\naviaries and at poultry shows. There are many other rare and curious\r\nvarieties which are to be seen only in the finest collections. Among\r\nthese is a class called the Eared Pheasants, because of the little tufts\r\nof feathers which project backward at each side of the head, looking\r\nstrikingly like the ears of a mammal. The pheasants of this class are\r\nmostly dull colored and quite docile in disposition.\r\n\r\n=Place in domestication.= The future place of pheasants in domestication\r\nis not so plainly indicated by their history and present position as the\r\nplaces of the guinea and the turkey seem to be. Pheasants seem to be\r\nmore desirable, easier to control, better suited to confinement, and\r\nalso better adapted to wintering out of doors in cold climates, than are\r\nguineas. The beauty of the ornamental types makes them very desirable to\r\nthose who keep birds for pleasure. Because they are so much smaller than\r\npeafowl, and also because they are able to live amicably with fowls,\r\nthey may be kept where peafowl could not. It is therefore probable that,\r\nas people in America become more familiar with pheasants, and as they\r\nlearn that the greatest pleasure and the surest profit in aviculture are\r\nto be found in growing a few birds under the most favorable conditions\r\nthat can be made for them, the numbers of pheasant fanciers will greatly\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 172. Monaul, a Himalayan pheasant]\r\n\r\nIn England pheasants are extensively grown in game preserves, for\r\nshooting and for sale as breeding stock to those who wish to stock new\r\npreserves. Where the birds are fed by a keeper, as they must be when\r\nthey are very numerous, they become so tame that hunting them is not\r\nvery exciting sport. Some that have been released in this country, and\r\nhave lived in a natural state in places where shooting them was not\r\nallowed, have become quite as tame as the birds in the English\r\npreserves. Altogether the history of efforts to establish pheasants in a\r\nwild state with a measure of protection from hunters shows that it would\r\noften be practical for owners of woodland and waste land to establish\r\nand preserve colonies of wild or half-wild pheasants. Whether this will\r\nbe done to any great extent depends upon the extermination of wild\r\nanimals and upon the placing of proper restrictions upon the domestic\r\nanimals (dogs and cats) which are destructive to land birds; it depends\r\nalso, to some extent, upon concert of action among the landowners in a\r\ncommunity, in securing for themselves the use of the pheasants grown on\r\ntheir lands.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of domesticating pheasants of the Manchurian type, and\r\none or two other rare varieties that, when seen on exhibition, appear\r\nvery docile, is also to be taken into account. The United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture[14] has called attention to the fact that some\r\nof the little-known kinds of pheasants seem especially adapted to\r\ndomestication. Even before that, many poultrymen, seeing these birds at\r\nexhibitions, had been impressed by their appearance, and had remarked\r\nthat they looked like birds that would become thoroughly domestic. At\r\nthe present time persons desiring to grow any of the more common\r\nvarieties of pheasants for table use should first ascertain how the game\r\nlaws of the state in which they live, and of any state into which they\r\nmight want to send pheasants, would affect their undertaking. Sometimes\r\nthe laws made to protect pheasants in a wild state have been passed\r\nwithout due regard for the interests of persons growing them in\r\ncaptivity. Errors of this kind are usually adjusted before long;\r\nmeantime those who may innocently break a law find the situation very\r\nembarrassing.\r\n\r\n[14] Pheasant Raising in the United States, _Farmers' Bulletin No. 390_.\r\n\r\n=Management of pheasants in confinement.= The breeding of pheasants on a\r\nsmall scale may be carried on in any place where suitable runs can be\r\nmade for them. The first essential is a somewhat secluded site where the\r\nbirds will not be subject to frequent disturbances. It should be near\r\nenough to the owner's dwelling to enable him to keep watch of what goes\r\non in its vicinity, yet not so near that the movements of the members of\r\nthe household, as they go about their ordinary affairs, will disturb the\r\npheasants. It should be where trees or bushes make a natural shade but\r\nnot a dense shade; a place where the sun and shade are about equal on a\r\nclear day is best. A light sandy or gravelly soil is to be preferred,\r\nand a clay soil should be avoided. If the land has underbrush on it,\r\nthis need not be cleared from the space occupied by the run, unless it\r\nis so thick that it shades the ground too much.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 173. Coops and yards for breeding pheasants.\r\n(Photograph from Simpson's Pheasant Farm, Corvallis, Oregon)]\r\n\r\nThe house should be of about the same size and construction as would be\r\nused for a few fowls. A roosting place should also be made in the yard,\r\nfor as a rule the birds will prefer to roost outdoors. The house is to\r\nafford them proper shelter from severe storms and during prolonged damp\r\nweather. For either a pair or a pen of a male and several females the\r\nyard should contain about 600 square feet. The fences inclosing it\r\nshould be at least 6 feet high, and the top should be covered with wire\r\nnetting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 174. Young China Pheasants at feeding time.\r\n(Photograph from Simpson's Pheasant Farm, Corvallis, Oregon)]\r\n\r\nThe Silver, Soemmerring, and Swinhoe Pheasants mate in pairs; the other\r\nfamiliar kinds are polygamous, and from one to five or six females may\r\nbe kept with one male.\r\n\r\nPheasants may be fed the same things as are fed to fowls, and in much\r\nthe same manner, but there is one important difference which the\r\npheasant breeder must carefully observe. Fowls will stand abuse in the\r\nmatter of diet much better than pheasants will. In feeding the latter\r\nmore attention must be given to providing regular supplies of green\r\nfood, to having all food sound and good when fed, and to regulating the\r\nquantity given for a meal so that it will not lie about and become sour\r\nor soiled before it is eaten.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 175. Fowls and pheasants in same yard on a New\r\nEngland poultry farm]\r\n\r\nMost pheasant fanciers use large bantams or small common hens to hatch\r\nand rear the young pheasants. The period of incubation is from\r\ntwenty-two to twenty-four days. Until they are weaned from the hens the\r\nlittle pheasants may be managed as young chickens are, but with the same\r\nattention to variety of food and to moderation in feeding that has been\r\nspecified for the old birds. A small number with a good range on grass\r\nor in a garden will pick much of their food. Many of the older works on\r\npoultry which treated of the care of pheasants recommended for the young\r\nbirds a great variety of foods not easily provided. Nowadays the most\r\nsuccessful amateur fanciers feed either a mixture of the common small\r\ngrains or some of the commercial mixtures which contain, in addition to\r\nthese, a number of seeds and grains not much used by poultry keepers who\r\nbuy their grains separately in bulk. Stale cracked corn, which is\r\ndangerous to all young poultry, is especially to be avoided in feeding\r\nyoung pheasants. After the young pheasants are weaned, they must be kept\r\nin covered runs, or their wings must be clipped to prevent them from\r\nflying.\r\n\r\nA large pheasantry is operated on the same general lines as a plant\r\nwhere birds are grown in small numbers. The method is simply an\r\nextension of that just described. When only one kind of pheasant is\r\nkept, the inclosed yard is sometimes made very large, and a hundred or\r\nmore birds are put together. This is not good practice with any kind of\r\npoultry, and is no doubt responsible for much of the trouble which those\r\ngrowing pheasants in large numbers have had. At aviaries where there are\r\nlarge collections of pheasants, including many rare and costly kinds,\r\nthe yards are always made large enough to give the birds good sanitary\r\nconditions, and as a rule each family of adult birds, whether composed\r\nof two or more, has a yard to itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nSWANS\r\n\r\n\r\nNaturalists divide swans into a number of different species. Whether\r\nthis division is correct is not known. The habits of swans, and the\r\ncircumstances under which they are usually kept, tend to prevent the\r\nmingling of different kinds. As far as the author has been able to\r\nlearn, there is no evidence which shows conclusively the relations of\r\nany of the supposed different species. The differences between them are\r\nin some cases very slight. Some of the decisions of the naturalists who\r\nhave classified slightly different kinds as distinct species are based\r\nupon examinations of very small numbers of specimens. Considering the\r\napparent resemblances of the different kinds of swans in the light of\r\nwhat is known of species and varieties in fowls, ducks, geese, and\r\npheasants, it seems probable that the true species of swans are fewer in\r\nnumber than the common classification shows, and it also seems quite\r\npossible that all swans are of the same species.\r\n\r\n=Description.= The common swan, called the domestic swan, is about the\r\nsize of the largest domestic geese, but appears larger because it has a\r\nlonger neck and head and larger wings. The body is also somewhat longer\r\nthan that of a goose of about the same weight, and the swan is a much\r\nmore graceful bird than a large goose. It is sometimes called the Mute\r\nSwan, to distinguish it from the Whistling Swan, which is a very similar\r\nkind not bred in domestication. There are other slight differences\r\nbetween the Mute Swans and the Whistling Swans, but the difference in\r\nthe voice, if it really is as great as is supposed, is the only one of\r\nmuch consequence in deciding their relations. The Mute Swan is not\r\ndumb. It sometimes makes a low, whistling sound. People are not agreed\r\nas to whether there is any real foundation for the familiar tradition\r\nthat the Mute Swan remains silent until about to die, and then sings a\r\n\"song.\" Some people acquainted with the habits of swans declare that the\r\nswan is more vocal when dying than at any other time in its life. Others\r\nsay that the idea probably arose as a result of some one's hearing a\r\ndying swan moaning in pain, as sick animals and birds often do, and\r\nconcluding that it was uttering a series of sounds characteristic of\r\nswans in a dying condition. However that may be, the Mute Swan is\r\ndistinctly less noisy than the wild Whistling Swan.\r\n\r\nUntil 1697 all swans known to civilized people were white, and the swan\r\nwas an emblem of purity of color. In that year a Dutch navigator\r\nvisiting Australia found there a black swan. Afterwards a white swan\r\nwith a black neck was discovered in South America. Had the subject of\r\nheredity been well understood before the discovery of these two swans\r\nthat were not white, people familiar with the white swans would have\r\nknown that there were colored swans in some unexplored country (or that\r\nthey had existed in the known world in a former age), for white swans\r\nare not perfectly white at maturity, and when young they are gray.\r\nNeither is the black swan all black. It has white flight feathers, and\r\nits black color is a rusty black, that is, a black mixed with red.\r\n\r\nSwans are very long-lived birds, but stories of swans living to seventy\r\nor eighty years of age are not to be credited. It cannot be affirmed\r\nthat the birds may not live as long as that, but the evidence in the\r\ncases reported is defective. The reports of swans living for fifty years\r\nare quite credible. The male and female swan are not readily\r\ndistinguished, for there are no external indications of sex, and the\r\nbirds use their voices so rarely that, even if there is a difference in\r\nthe notes of the male and female, it is not practical to use it to\r\ndistinguish between them. The only way to identify the sex with\r\ncertainty is by observing the birds at nesting time.\r\n\r\nThe name \"swan\" is Anglo-Saxon. Nothing is known of its derivation. The\r\nterms \"cock\" and \"hen\" are sometimes applied to swans as they are to\r\nmany other kinds of birds. The swanherds in England call the male a\r\n_cob_ and the female a _pen_. The young swan is called a _cygnet_, from\r\nthe French word for \"swan.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 176. Swan and nest]\r\n\r\n=Origin and history in domestication.= Tradition says that the domestic\r\nswan was brought to England from France by Richard the Lion-hearted. As\r\nthe swan is a migratory bird, still sometimes seen in many parts of the\r\nEastern Hemisphere north of the equator, it is possible that swans were\r\nknown in England long before the reign of this king. However that may\r\nbe, it is certain that, from about the time of the Norman Conquest, the\r\nswan has occupied a peculiar position in England. It was regarded as a\r\nroyal bird, and the privilege of owning swans was granted only to those\r\nin high station. At first the number of those who were permitted to own\r\nswans was very small, but it was afterward extended until, in the reign\r\nof Queen Elizabeth, more than nine hundred different swanmarks were\r\nregistered by the royal swanherd, who had general oversight of all the\r\nswans in the kingdom. The swans were marked by branding or cutting the\r\nbill, this being necessary because they lived largely on the margins of\r\nuninclosed waters, just as in some of our Western states cattle live on\r\nunfenced lands. The right to own swans carried with it the right to keep\r\nthem in such a place.\r\n\r\n=Place in domestication.= Although it has been bred in captivity for\r\ncenturies, the swan is not fully domesticated. It does not, like the\r\nduck and the goose, so increase in size and weight when kept under the\r\ncontrol of man that it becomes incapable of flight, but, like the\r\nAmerican Wild Goose in captivity, it is prevented from flying by\r\nremoving the first joint of one wing, the operation being performed as\r\nsoon as possible after the young birds are hatched. The swan lives more\r\non the water than either the duck or the goose. It subsists largely upon\r\ncoarse aquatic grasses and plants, and is said to eat all kinds of\r\ndecaying matter found in the water.\r\n\r\nIn England in old times the swan was used as food by the wealthy, but\r\nits use for this purpose ceased long ago. It is now kept almost\r\nexclusively for ornament. Most of the swans in America are kept in\r\npublic parks or on large private estates. Very few are reared here; the\r\nsupply is kept up largely by importations from England. The swan is not\r\npopular, because the birds are costly and are not prolific. Still the\r\nbreeding of swans for ornamental purposes or for sale to exhibitors\r\nmight be carried on with profit upon many farms. Under suitable\r\nconditions, swans may, at the same time, perform valuable service and\r\nmake a valuable product. By consuming the kinds of food which they\r\nprefer, they clean ponds and keep sluggish streams open. Being so large\r\nand strong, and requiring so much coarse food, they are a great deal\r\nmore serviceable in this way than are ducks and geese.\r\n\r\n=Management.= When swans were abundant in England, they were kept mostly\r\nupon certain rivers and inlets of the sea where natural food was\r\nabundant. The climate of England is so mild that they can there obtain\r\nfood in such places at all seasons. The colder parts of America do not\r\nafford conditions favorable to swan culture. Where the winters are long\r\nand severe, and streams and ponds are frozen over for months, wintering\r\nswans would be troublesome and expensive, but where the waters are open\r\nthroughout the year, a farmer who had a suitable place for them might\r\nbreed swans with profit. A pair of swans would cost about the same as a\r\ngood cow, and might make about the same net profit. But there would be\r\nthis difference: the cow would require a great deal of care, the swans\r\nvery little; the cow would eat salable food, the swans mostly waste\r\nfood. By this comparison it is not meant to suggest that a farmer might\r\nprofitably replace his cows with swans. The object is simply to show how\r\nthe possible profit from small specialities compares with the usual\r\nprofit from a regular feature of farming.\r\n\r\nThe methods of managing swans are much like the methods of managing wild\r\ngeese in captivity. The principal difference is that the swans must have\r\na larger body of water, and one in which vegetation is abundant. They\r\nare not as fond of land grasses as geese are, and like to float on the\r\nsurface of the water, feeding on the vegetation at the bottom. Their\r\nlong necks enable them to do this in water several feet deep. They need\r\nno shelter but a small hut, which they will use only in rare\r\nemergencies. After they have settled down in a spot, there should be no\r\nneed of building fences to restrain them. As they are not able to fly,\r\nthey will remain quite near their home unless food supplies there are\r\nvery short. In that case extra food should be given them. Even when\r\nnatural food is abundant, it is a good plan to feed swans a little of\r\nsomething else occasionally, to attach them to the person who has charge\r\nof them. As every one knows who has seen the swans in parks, where\r\nvisitors amuse themselves by feeding them, swans are very fond of bread.\r\nThey will eat grain also, although, when not accustomed to it, they may\r\nat first refuse it. Their food is usually given either by throwing it on\r\nthe water or by placing it in troughs from which the birds can eat while\r\nfloating upon the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 177. Feeding swans on the water]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 178. View of an English swannery]\r\n\r\nThe female builds near the water a nest of coarse stalks and small\r\nsticks. Sometimes this is reared to a height of several feet, and\r\nmaterial added around the sides, little by little, during the whole\r\nperiod of incubation. Swans have been known to pile up nearly half a\r\ncord of material for their nest. From five to ten eggs are laid in the\r\nnest. The period of incubation is six weeks. As far as possible,\r\ninterference with the birds should be avoided during the breeding season\r\nand while the young are small. When it is necessary to handle them in\r\nany way, the attendant should have at the start all the assistance he\r\nis likely to require. A blow from a swan's wing may injure a man very\r\nseriously. It is said that such a blow has been known to break a man's\r\nthigh.\r\n\r\nThe young are gray when hatched and do not become entirely white until\r\ntwo years old. Even then many of them are not absolutely white, but show\r\nvery distinct traces of reddish-yellow, especially on the head and upper\r\npart of the neck. There is a story that a young swan of a deep buff\r\ncolor was hatched at Lewes in England.\r\n\r\nIf the swans with young must be fed, the usual practice is to throw the\r\nfood upon the water. Stale bread, grain, and even meal are given in this\r\nway. It looks like a wasteful way of feeding, but the birds will get all\r\nthe food.\r\n\r\nSwanneries are unknown in America. In England a few of those established\r\nmany centuries ago still remain. The largest and most celebrated of\r\nthese is at Abbotsbury. Swans have been bred here continuously for about\r\neight hundred years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nOSTRICHES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ostrich is unlike other birds in many important characters. It is\r\nnot a typical bird. While it has feathers and wings, its feathering is\r\nnot normal, and the muscles of the wings are lacking. In the minds of\r\nmost persons it is associated with the circus menagerie rather than with\r\nthe poultry yard, but, as we shall see, this singular bird has a place\r\nin domestication and, as a useful land bird, belongs to the poultry\r\ngroup. There are two species of ostriches, but only one of these is of\r\neconomic value.\r\n\r\n=Description.= The ostrich is the largest of living birds. A full-grown\r\nmale standing erect measures from six to seven feet in height. The\r\nlargest specimens weigh about three hundred pounds. As, in the\r\natmosphere which now surrounds the earth, a creature of such size and\r\nweight cannot fly at all, the wings of the ostrich have become\r\natrophied, and the muscles of the wings, which form the plump, meaty\r\nbreasts of flying birds, are entirely wanting. Not only have these\r\nmuscles disappeared, but the breastbone, which in flying birds is very\r\nlarge in proportion to the rest of the skeleton, and has a deep,\r\nlongitudinal keel in the middle, is comparatively small in the ostrich\r\nand has no keel at all. The ostrich, having no power of flight, is\r\ndependent for safety upon its speed in running; so its legs are long and\r\nstrong, and the muscles which move them are very large. Indeed, there is\r\nvery little meat on an ostrich except on the thighs. It can run much\r\nfaster than a horse. Because its foot must be adapted to running at\r\ngreat speed, the ostrich has only two toes. Its neck is very long and\r\nslender, and its head is very small and flat. In such a head there is\r\nlittle room for brains. The ostrich is a very stupid creature, but it\r\ndoes not, as is commonly supposed, hide its head in the sand and imagine\r\nthat, not being able to see its enemies, it cannot be seen by them. That\r\nis a myth apparently based upon the fact that, when in repose, an\r\nostrich sometimes lies with its long neck stretched upon the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 179. Side view of male ostrich. (Photograph from the\r\nBureau of Animal Industry, United States Department of Agriculture)]\r\n\r\nSince the wings of the ostrich are useless for flight, the flight\r\nfeathers have lost the structure adapted to that purpose and have\r\ndeveloped into beautiful plumes. The tail feathers have also undergone a\r\nsimilar change. These wing and tail feathers are the ostrich feathers of\r\ncommerce. The neck and head of the ostrich are almost bare of feathers.\r\nThe body is covered with feathers, but not as densely as in most birds.\r\nThere are just enough feathers on the body of an ostrich to protect the\r\nskin from exposure when they lie flat. The areas on the skin where there\r\nare no feathers are much larger than on other birds. The thighs of the\r\nostrich are bare. The skin is in some varieties of a bluish-gray; in\r\nother varieties the bare parts are red and the skin of the body is\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\nThe crop and the gizzard of the ostrich are not separated as in other\r\nbirds, but are joined; the upper part of the stomach performs the\r\nfunctions of a crop and the lower part those of a gizzard.\r\n\r\nThe male ostrich is usually larger than the female. The adult males and\r\nfemales are plainly distinguished by the color of their plumage, the\r\nbody feathers of the male being black, while those of the female are\r\ngray. The plumes of both sexes are white or white mixed with black. The\r\nblack on an ostrich is often of a brownish shade, and this is most\r\nconspicuous when it appears on the plumes.\r\n\r\nThe bill of the male and the scales on the fronts of his shanks become a\r\nbright rose color in the breeding season. The male ostrich utters a\r\nguttural sound, called booming, which is said to resemble the roar of a\r\nlion as heard at a distance. The voice of the female is like that of the\r\nmale, but very faint.\r\n\r\nThe difference in the plumage of the sexes, although it is not complete\r\nuntil after the second adult molt, is noticeable much earlier. The\r\nfemales do not begin to lay until three or four years old. The males are\r\nnot fully matured until four or five years of age. Ostriches are very\r\nlong-lived. Birds whose age could be verified have lived as long as\r\nforty-five years in captivity, and at that age were profitable as\r\nbreeders and also as feather producers. It is believed by some of those\r\nmost competent to judge such matters that under favorable circumstances\r\nan ostrich might live a hundred years or more. Very few of the birds\r\nkept in domestication die of old age. They are so stupid, and their\r\nlong legs, though strong for running, are so easily broken, that an\r\naccident of some kind almost always ends the life of an ostrich long\r\nbefore it has passed its prime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 180. Front view of male and female ostriches.\r\n(Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry, United States Department\r\nof Agriculture)]\r\n\r\nThe name \"ostrich\" has an interesting history. The Greeks called this\r\nsingular bird _struthion'_. This came into the Latin language as\r\n_struthio_. In low Latin, _avis_, the Latin word for \"bird,\" was\r\nprefixed to what remained of the Greek name, giving _avis struthio_.\r\n\"Ostrich\" is a contraction of this low Latin compound. So we have in\r\nthis name a combination of two words from different languages, having\r\nthe same meaning. The terms \"cock,\" \"hen,\" and \"chick\" are used with the\r\nname of the species, to designate respectively the adult male, the adult\r\nfemale, and the young before the first plucking.\r\n\r\n=Origin and history in domestication.= The domestic ostrich is the wild\r\nAfrican ostrich in captivity. It is probable that the ostrich was\r\nfamiliar to the people of Northern Africa, and was known to those of the\r\nadjacent parts of Asia and Europe, in prehistoric times. In very early\r\ntimes ostriches may have been kept in captivity for their feathers, as\r\nthey are now kept in the Sudan, but, until about 1860, when the farmers\r\nof South Africa began to take an interest in the subject, we have no\r\nknowledge of any efforts to breed ostriches in captivity and to improve\r\nthe quality of the feathers by giving the birds more nutritious food\r\nthan they usually get in the wild state. The first stock used in South\r\nAfrica was some of the wild stock found in that part of the continent.\r\nIn 1882 the first ostriches were brought to the United States.\r\n\r\n=Place in domestication.= Commercially the ostrich is valuable only for\r\nits plume feathers. The extent of the development of ostrich culture\r\ndepends upon the demand for ostrich feathers at prices that will warrant\r\nbreeding ostriches to supply them. When the industry was first\r\nestablished in South Africa, ostrich feathers brought high prices and\r\nthe business was very profitable; but so many farmers engaged in it, and\r\nthe supply of feathers increased so rapidly that prices soon became much\r\nlower and have never since returned to the scale that prevailed at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the ostrich is edible, but it is so hard and tough that no\r\none would grow ostriches for their flesh. The egg of an ostrich is about\r\nas large as two dozen hen eggs. Ostrich eggs are said to be very good,\r\nbut they are too large for ordinary use, and the birds are so long in\r\nmaturing that it would not pay to use them to produce eggs for\r\ncommercial purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 181. Ostrich eggs and newly hatched chicks.\r\n(Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry, United States Department\r\nof Agriculture)]\r\n\r\nThe breeding of ostriches for their feathers, however, may be regarded\r\nas a permanent industry, for there will always be a demand for ostrich\r\nplumes, but it cannot be developed as extensively as if the product were\r\na staple article of food. The ostrich farms in America are mostly\r\nspecial farms devoted exclusively to ostrich breeding. Most of these\r\nfarms are owned and operated by companies. Some of them are stock\r\nspeculation projects. In South Africa the industry is more in the hands\r\nof the general farmers, each of those engaged in it growing a few birds.\r\nThe people of South Africa have tried to secure a monopoly in ostrich\r\nfeathers by prohibiting the exportation of ostriches and by purchasing\r\nthe best stock to be obtained in North Africa. Ostrich farming is\r\npractical only in tropical and semitropical countries; the plumage of\r\nthe birds is too scanty to protect them in the cold winters of temperate\r\nclimes. In the United States nearly all the ostrich farms are in\r\nSouthern California and Arizona, but there are some in Texas, Arkansas,\r\nand Florida.\r\n\r\n=Management.= In the places where ostrich farming is carried on, the\r\nbirds need no shelter. They must be kept in inclosures fenced as for\r\ncattle. As ostriches are bred for their plumage, and that of the male is\r\nmost valuable, the breeder does not object to their following their\r\nnatural inclination and mating in pairs, but many males are so injured\r\nin fighting that they must be killed. This leaves an excess of females,\r\nand so two or more females are sometimes mated with one male. The birds\r\nare mated for breeding when they are about three and one-half years old.\r\nThe object of mating them before they are fully mature is to prevent\r\nthem from selecting for themselves partners contrary to the ideas of the\r\nbreeder. Each mating must have its own yard, unless the place where more\r\nthan one family is kept is large enough to allow each family the\r\nexclusive use of a part of it. Under such circumstances each group will\r\nkeep to its own range.\r\n\r\nThe natural food of the ostrich is grass and the leaves of shrubs and\r\ntrees. In domestication it is usually pastured on alfalfa, or fed on\r\nalfalfa hay, according to the season. The alfalfa is often supplemented\r\nwith grain (principally corn), and grit, bone, and shell are provided as\r\nfor other birds.\r\n\r\nMost ostrich growers prefer to hatch the eggs in incubators, because by\r\nremoving the eggs from the nests they induce the hens to lay more, and\r\nbecause the young ostriches are much easier to manage when by themselves\r\nthan when with the old birds. When a pair of ostriches hatch their own\r\neggs, the hen sits during the day and the cock at night. The period of\r\nincubation is six weeks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 182. Flock of ostriches on a California ostrich\r\nfarm. (Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry, United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture)]\r\n\r\nYoung ostriches are fed the same as old ones. They are kept in flocks of\r\nfifty or more until about a year old, when the sexes are separated. The\r\nplumes are cut for the first time when the birds are between six and\r\nseven months old. Although the process of removing these feathers is\r\ncalled plucking, they are not drawn out, but are cut close to the skin.\r\nThe object is to get the feather immediately after it is grown, before\r\nit can be soiled or damaged in any way. At that time the quill is still\r\nfull of blood. Drawing it out would be very painful to the bird, and\r\nmight injure the wing so that the next feather that grew would be\r\ndefective. The stumps of the feathers are allowed to remain until they\r\nare dead and dry, when they are drawn out easily. In South Africa the\r\nKafirs draw the stumps out with their teeth. In about six or seven\r\nmonths after the stumps are removed, the new plumes are grown and the\r\nprocess of plucking is repeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nPIGEONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pigeon is the only species of aerial bird kept in domestication to\r\nprovide food for man. It is also the only useful domestic bird that is\r\nable to maintain itself and increase in numbers in populous districts\r\nwithout the care of man.\r\n\r\n=Description.= The common pigeon is about the size of the smallest\r\nbantam fowls. It is a plump, hard-feathered bird, with a short neck, a\r\nround head free from ornamental appendages, a short beak, and short\r\nlegs. The prevailing color is a dull, checkered blue, varying in shade\r\nfrom a very light blue to nearly black. The blue is sometimes replaced\r\nby red with similar variations in shade. There are also white pigeons,\r\nblack pigeons, and many birds in which all the colors that have been\r\nnamed are irregularly mixed.\r\n\r\nThe male and female pigeons are not distinguished by any regular\r\ndifferences of size, form, color, or voice. The males are usually a\r\nlittle larger and coarser looking, and make themselves conspicuous by\r\ntheir vain posing and domineering ways, but none of these\r\ncharacteristics are reliable indications of sex. The natural voice of\r\nthe pigeon is a soft, gurgling coo repeated over and over with\r\nmonotonous effect. It is sometimes heavier and more prolonged in the\r\nmale, but except in the Trumpeter and Laugher Pigeons, in which the\r\nvoice has been peculiarly developed, the difference in the voices of the\r\nmale and female is not marked. Even in the two varieties mentioned, many\r\nmales have such poor voices that the voice is not an infallible\r\nindication of the sex. The most expert pigeon breeders are often in\r\ndoubt about the sex of some pigeons until they pair.\r\n\r\nThe name \"pigeon\" is from the Latin _pipio_ (to peep or chirp), and\r\ncame into the English language from the French. The Anglo-Saxon name for\r\nthe bird was probably _dufa_, from which we have the word \"dove,\" which\r\nis still sometimes applied to pigeons. _Dufa_ was derived from _dufan_\r\n(to plunge into). It seems probable that the name was given because of\r\nthe pigeon's habit of dropping almost perpendicularly when descending\r\nfrom an elevated position. The male pigeon is called a cock, the female\r\na hen. Young pigeons are called _squabs_, _squeakers_, or sometimes\r\n_squealers_. The word \"squab,\" which means \"fat,\" describes the\r\ncharacteristic appearance of the nestling pigeon; the other terms refer\r\nto the noise it makes as it persistently begs for food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 183. Tame pigeons. (Photograph from Elmer E. Rice,\r\nBoston, Massachusetts)]\r\n\r\n=Origin.= Domestic pigeons are all descended from the wild Blue Rock\r\nPigeon of the Old World. Although many of the improved varieties have\r\nbeen greatly changed in form, they are all perfectly fertile when bred\r\ntogether. The Blue Rock Pigeon is found in the wild state in Europe,\r\nAsia, and Africa. \"Fancy Pigeons,\" by James C. Lyell, the best authority\r\non the subject, contains this statement: \"The British Blue Rock inhabits\r\nthe rocks and caves on our seacoasts, as well as precipitous inland\r\nrocks, and certainly the difference between this bird and a common blue\r\nflying tumbler is very little. Their color is identical, their size\r\nalmost so.... In the west of Scotland, where fanciers keep and show\r\ncommon pigeons, the wild Blue Rock domesticated is the bird so called.\"\r\n\r\nIt is by no means certain that these wild pigeons are a true wild race.\r\nConsidering the habits of the pigeon and its wide distribution in\r\nEngland centuries ago, it seems certain that many, if not all, of the\r\npigeons now found wild in the British Isles are descended from birds\r\nonce domesticated. Rock Pigeons of the same type, however, are found in\r\nmany other parts of the Old World and, whether wild or feral, are\r\nplainly all from the same original stock. The American Wild Pigeon, also\r\ncalled the Passenger Pigeon, which was once found in enormous flocks in\r\neastern North America, is often erroneously mentioned as the ancestor of\r\ndomestic pigeons. The Rock Pigeon and the Passenger Pigeon are of\r\ndifferent species and are very different in appearance and habits. The\r\nRock Pigeon is what is called a shelf builder. It builds its nest on a\r\nledge, or shelf, and will rarely even alight in a tree or a bush. The\r\nPassenger Pigeon is a wood pigeon, nesting and roosting in trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 184. Flock of Dragoon Pigeons[15]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 185. Flying Homer Pigeon[15]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 186. Silver Runt Pigeon[15]]\r\n\r\n[15] Photograph from Elmer E. Rice, Boston, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n=Distribution in ancient times.= The pigeon was domesticated at a very\r\nearly stage of civilization. Like the fowl, the duck, and the goose, it\r\nwas well known to all civilized peoples of antiquity. To what extent the\r\ndistribution of pigeons in domestication followed the early migrations\r\nof the human race is not known. It is probable that pigeons were\r\ndomesticated before the Aryan migrations began, and also that the\r\ndomestic stock was sometimes taken by Aryan colonists to their new\r\nhomes; but it is equally probable that at various times in the history\r\nof the earth people coming to new lands domesticated some of the wild\r\nrock pigeons which they found there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 187. Swiss Mondaine Pigeon[16]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 188. Splashed Homer[16]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 189. Blue-barred Homer[16]]\r\n\r\n[16] Photograph from Elmer E. Rice, Boston, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n=Improved varieties.= Common pigeons are much alike the world over, and\r\nhave changed little from the wild race, but in many different parts of\r\nthe Old World the making of improved varieties began thousands of years\r\nago, and in some places peculiar types were developed which were little\r\nknown elsewhere until modern times. The varieties of the pigeon are so\r\nnumerous that it is practically impossible to make a complete list of\r\nthem. At the large shows in this country, classes are made for more than\r\none hundred fifty named varieties, in about forty breeds. In many of\r\nthese breeds there are eight or ten principal color varieties, and an\r\nindefinite number of less popular varieties, specimens of which compete\r\nin a miscellaneous competition in what is called the \"any other variety\r\nclass.\" There are probably nearly three hundred varieties of pigeons\r\nbred in America and England. On the continent of Europe the number is\r\nvery much greater. The Triganica pigeon has one hundred fifty-two color\r\nvarieties, and it is said that another variety in Germany, not known in\r\nEngland and America, has one hundred thirty-eight color varieties. Where\r\nvarieties are so numerous, many of the color differences are necessarily\r\nslight, and only those who know them well can readily distinguish the\r\ndifferent varieties at sight; others are bewildered when they attempt to\r\ndo so. In this chapter only the most pronounced color varieties and the\r\nbreeds of most interest to beginners will be described, but some of the\r\nmost interesting of the others will be mentioned, to illustrate the\r\nrange of the improved types developed by fanciers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 190. White Hen Pigeons. (Photograph from Elmer E.\r\nRice, Boston, Massachusetts)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 191. Young Jacobin Pigeons. (Photograph from E. R.\r\nB. Chapman, Stoneham, Massachusetts)]\r\n\r\n=The Carrier Pigeon.= The homing instinct--that is, the faculty of\r\nfinding the way home after wandering or being taken away from it--is\r\nfound in animals of all kinds. In some kinds of animals it is much more\r\nhighly developed than in others, and some animals of each kind have more\r\nof it than is usual with their species. It is well known that migratory\r\nbirds usually return to the same localities season after season, and\r\nthat certain pairs often return to the same vicinity year after year and\r\nbuild their nests in the same places. When this instinct is highly\r\ndeveloped in a wild bird, its habit of returning to the same nest is of\r\ngreat interest to those who observe it, but it has no particular value.\r\nIn a domestic bird the homing instinct or habit is of service because\r\nthe owner of a bird relies upon it to make the bird return always to the\r\nplace which he has provided for it, instead of taking shelter elsewhere\r\nor remaining where nocturnal enemies will find it an easy prey. In the\r\ndomestic land birds the instinct has no further use than this, but in\r\npigeons which, while thoroughly domesticated, retain full power of\r\nflight, the development of the homing faculty makes it possible to use\r\nthem as a means of communication when it is necessary to transmit short\r\nletters with great dispatch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 192. Muffed Tumblers with \"saddle\" color pattern.\r\n(Photograph from E. R. B. Chapman, Stoneham, Massachusetts)]\r\n\r\nIt is known that pigeons were used as messengers in war about the\r\nbeginning of the Christian Era. An Egyptian bas-relief of about 1350\r\nB.C. shows pigeons being released from cages just as they are now\r\nreleased in flying matches. The homing instinct is so strong in the\r\ncommon pigeon that any one familiar with its habits may easily suppose\r\nthat pigeons were used to carry messages almost as soon as men had\r\ndevised means of communication by writing upon any material which the\r\nbirds could carry in their flight. There is reason to believe that in\r\nvery ancient times pigeons were bred and trained especially for work of\r\nthis kind in Egypt, Greece, and Rome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 193. Feeding pigeons on Boston Common. (Photograph\r\nfrom Elmer E. Rice, Boston, Massachusetts)]\r\n\r\nThe pigeon which in England and America now goes by the name of \"Carrier\r\nPigeon\" is a type developed as a messenger pigeon in Persia and from\r\nthat country distributed to many parts of the world. As bred in Asia it\r\nwas larger and stronger than the common pigeon, and had a cere, or\r\nconvoluted membrane, around each eye and at the juncture of the head and\r\nthe beak. It is thought that this type of Carrier may have been taken\r\nfrom Asia Minor to England at the time of the Crusades, but nothing\r\ndefinite is known of it in Great Britain until the seventeenth century.\r\nThis old type of Carrier and several closely related varieties were used\r\nfor messengers, and also in flying competitions, until the variety next\r\ndescribed was developed. When the Carrier Pigeon was bred for carrying\r\nmessages, no attention was paid to its color. Pigeon fanciers who were\r\nnot interested in pigeon flying, but liked the Carrier for its other\r\ncharacters, early developed many distinct color varieties and also gave\r\nspecial attention to the form and carriage of the bird and to the\r\ndevelopment of the ceres around the eyes and on the beak. The Carrier\r\nPigeon is now bred only as an exhibition bird.\r\n\r\n=The Antwerp Homer.= Beginning sometime early in the last century,\r\nbreeders of flying pigeons at Antwerp, in Belgium, developed a race\r\nwhich soon became celebrated for superior development of the homing\r\nfaculty and for great speed and endurance. This race was at first called\r\nthe Antwerp Carrier. When the invention of the telegraph made the\r\nservices of pigeons as messengers on land unnecessary, pigeons that\r\ncould fly long distances were still bred and trained for competitive\r\nflying matches. In these, as a rule, they carried no messages; the\r\nobject was to see which bird would reach home first. So gradually the\r\nterm \"homer\" was substituted for \"carrier,\" and the pigeons now called\r\nHomers, or Homing Pigeons, are the Antwerp Homing Pigeons. Good birds of\r\nthis type are larger and stronger than the common pigeon, and have a\r\nbolder, more confident bearing and a more attractive carriage. They show\r\ntheir good breeding very plainly. Many of the pigeons called Homers are\r\ncrosses or grades of the Antwerp Homer, and are not much better in any\r\nway than ordinary pigeons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 194. Flying Homer[17]]\r\n\r\n[17] Photograph from C. E. Twombley, Medford, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe true Homer is also the most popular type of pigeon for the\r\nproduction of squabs for market. Its great prolificacy, strong\r\nconstitution, quick growth, and large size make it a favorite with squab\r\ngrowers. As bred for flying or for market, Homers are of various colors,\r\nand the color varieties are not distinct except as occasionally a\r\nbreeder makes a specialty of producing birds of some particular color.\r\nMany pigeon fanciers breed Homers solely for exhibition. The Exhibition\r\nHomer has many distinct color varieties--Blue, Silver, Mealy, Blue\r\nChecker, Black Checker, Black, Red Checker, White, Yellow.\r\n\r\n=Tumbler and Tippler Pigeons.= The flying powers of pigeons have been\r\ndeveloped for other purposes as well as for traveling long distances. In\r\nrising or descending in flight a pigeon sometimes turns a somersault in\r\nthe air. This trait has been developed in certain races so that many\r\nbirds will perform the feat very often. These races are called Tumblers.\r\nThey are found all over Europe and Asia and in a few localities in\r\nAmerica. The common Tumblers perform in the air, usually at some\r\ndistance from the ground, the tumbling of individual birds being an\r\noccasional feature of the evolutions of a flock circling about in the\r\nvicinity of its home. From this common Tumbler more highly specialized\r\ntypes have been developed. The breeding of these types has become\r\nsomething of an art, and in some cases the sport of flying them has\r\nbecome a well-organized recreation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 195. Squab-breeding Homers. (Photograph from Elmer\r\nE. Rice, Boston, Massachusetts)]\r\n\r\nBy breeding together specimens which performed well when flying,\r\nTumblers were finally produced in which the tumbling propensity was so\r\nexaggerated that they could not fly but, after a few somersaults,\r\nalighted on their feet. These birds were called Inside Tumblers, or\r\nParlor Tumblers, to distinguish them from the common Tumblers, which\r\nrequired more room for their evolutions than any ordinary building\r\nafforded. Although they are incapable of flight, the Parlor Tumblers can\r\nrise a short distance before they fall. The Roller is a Tumbler which\r\nturns many somersaults so rapidly that each revolution of its body is\r\nmade in a very small space. A high-flying Roller falls while rolling in\r\nthe air. An Inside Roller turns over and over backward on the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 196. Clean-legged Red Tumbler[18]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 197. Muffed, or Feather-legged, Tumblers[18]]\r\n\r\n[18] Photograph from E. R. B. Chapman, Stoneham, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nBreeders of common Tumblers do not give them liberty, but release them\r\nfrom their loft only when they wish to see the birds perform, and, by\r\nfeeding them immediately upon their return, coax and train them to\r\nreturn to the loft soon after being released. A good performer is soon\r\nexhausted by tumbling, and is quite willing to return to the loft in a\r\nshort time. But not all birds of Tumbler stock are good and persistent\r\nperformers, and often birds that do not perform prefer liberty for a\r\nlonger period to the food that is waiting for them in the loft. Birds\r\nhave sometimes been compelled to remain in the air for a long time. As a\r\nresult of this treatment of poor Tumblers a type of Tumbler has been\r\nproduced which will perform more or less when ascending or descending,\r\nbut which, having risen to a high elevation, will remain for hours\r\ncircling over its home and perhaps occasionally flying away and\r\nreturning. Tumblers of this type can remain in the air for five or six\r\nhours. In flying them for sport the object is to see which flock will\r\nremain in the air longest. The tumbling habit was gradually bred out of\r\nthe high-flying birds, and after a time many of them did not tumble at\r\nall. Such birds were then called Tipplers (\"tipple\" having in some\r\nEnglish dialects the meaning of \"tumble\"). The modern Tippler Pigeon is\r\na bird in which the tendency to rise to a great height and remain there\r\nfor a long time has been developed to the utmost, as the tendency to\r\nreturn home from great distances has been developed in the Flying Homer.\r\nPerforming Tumblers and Tipplers are usually bred for performance\r\nwithout regard to color, and the colors in a flock of the same breeding\r\nmay be, and nearly always are, various. Exhibition stocks of Tumblers\r\nand Tipplers are bred in many distinct color varieties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 198. English Owl Pigeon[19]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 199. English Red Trumpeter Pigeon[19]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 200. English Saddle Trumpeter Pigeon[19]]\r\n\r\n[19] Photograph from E. R. B. Chapman, Stoneham, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n=The Fantail Pigeon.= The Fantail Pigeon originated in India. The\r\nfan-shaped tail, from which this variety takes its name, was developed\r\nby selection to increase the number of the large, straight main tail\r\nfeathers. Normally a pigeon has from twelve to sixteen of these\r\nfeathers; in the ordinary Fantail the number has been increased to\r\ntwenty-four or twenty-six. Many of the specimens in which this\r\ncharacter is highly developed have a much greater number of tail\r\nfeathers. It is said that forty-two feathers have been counted in a\r\ntail. A tail in which there are so many feathers cannot be carried in\r\nthe natural position; it spreads, forming a major segment of a circle,\r\nand at the same time it is elevated until, in specimens with very full\r\ntails, the highest tail feathers stand nearly perpendicular. To balance\r\nthe large tail carried in this position the Fantail has to carry its\r\nhead very far back. This makes the breast very prominent. The bird\r\ncannot fly well, and when walking about it appears to be strutting to\r\nmake a display of its spectacular tail. Its appearance is in this\r\nrespect deceptive, for it is a very modest bird and has difficulty in\r\nbalancing itself in any other position. The Fantail is gentle and\r\naffectionate, and is the best of all pigeons for those who want birds\r\nfor pets. It is bred in many color varieties. The White Fantail is the\r\nmost popular, because it is the most showy and the easiest to produce\r\nwith uniform color in a flock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 201. White Runt Pigeon[20]]\r\n\r\n[20] Photograph from Elmer E. Rice, Boston, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 202. White Pouter Pigeon]\r\n\r\n=Pouter Pigeons.= All pigeons have in some measure the power of\r\ninflating the crop with air. In the Pouter Pigeons this power has been\r\ndeveloped and its exercise encouraged to such an extent that in many\r\nspecimens the inflated crop is as large as all the rest of the bird.\r\nPouters were introduced into England from Holland several hundred years\r\nago. They were at first called Croppers. The common Pouter is a large\r\npigeon with long legs. It usually stands in a very erect position.\r\nThere is a race of dwarf pigeons of this type, called Pigmy Pouters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 203. Fowl-like, or Maltese Hen, Pigeons[21]]\r\n\r\n[21] Photograph from Elmer E. Rice, Boston, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n=Other important types.= One of the most attractive pigeons is the\r\nJacobin, which has the feathers of the neck turned upward, forming a\r\nhood which sometimes almost conceals the head. The Turbit and Owl\r\nPigeons are distinguished by a frill of feathers on the breast, and by\r\nthe peculiar beak and face, which are very short. The Dragoon is a\r\nlarge, showy pigeon of the Carrier type. The Trumpeter is distinguished\r\nby a crest, which greatly obstructs its sight, as well as by the\r\npeculiar development of the voice, to which it owes its name. The Runt\r\nis a very large pigeon bred both for exhibition and for the table. Some\r\nsquab growers prize it very highly; others say that the smaller and more\r\nprolific Homer is more profitable for squab breeding. The use of a term\r\ncommonly applied to undersized, ill-developed creatures as the name of\r\none of the largest pigeons is one of the curiosities of nomenclature.\r\nThe explanation, however, is simple. In England in old times common\r\npigeons were called runts. The pigeon now called the Runt was introduced\r\ninto England from Spain, and was called by early writers on pigeons the\r\nSpanish Runt, meaning the common pigeon of Spain. With the disuse of the\r\nterm \"runt\" to designate the common pigeon, the term \"Spanish\" was\r\ndropped from the designation of the improved breed, and it became simply\r\nthe Runt. Besides the Runt just mentioned there is another large pigeon,\r\nonce called the Leghorn Runt, which belongs to the class of Fowl-like,\r\nor Hen, Pigeons, so called because in shape they are strikingly like\r\nfowls. The most familiar representative of this class is the Maltese\r\nHen Pigeon.\r\n\r\n=History in domestication.= The history of the pigeon in domestication\r\npresents some very interesting features. Its use as a messenger has been\r\nmentioned. From very early times people of privileged classes took\r\nadvantage of the habits of the pigeon to grow the birds for their own\r\nuse at the expense of the community. The Assyrians and some other\r\nancient peoples considered the pigeon sacred to certain of their\r\ndeities. Sometimes all pigeons were so regarded; at other times and\r\nplaces only white pigeons were sacred, those of other colors being used\r\nby the common people.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 204. Nun Pigeons[22]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 205. German Frillback Pigeons[22]]\r\n\r\n[22] Photograph from E. R. B. Chapman, Stoneham, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nIn medieval times in England, the lord of a manor, when leasing farms to\r\ntenants, reserved the right to let his pigeons forage over them. As\r\npigeons live mostly upon grains and seeds, caring little for green\r\nvegetation and insects, the newly planted fields of the farmer were the\r\nfavorite feeding places of his landlord's pigeons. The landlords, being\r\nable to keep pigeons without other expense than that of providing\r\nshelter for them, built large dovecots near the manor houses and kept\r\ntheir tables plentifully supplied with pigeons. At one time it was\r\nestimated that there were more than twenty thousand such dovecots in\r\nEngland. The destruction of crops by the occupants of these caused\r\nserious losses to the farmers and a great deal of trouble between them\r\nand their landlords. This form of protection for roving pigeons in\r\nagricultural districts was finally abandoned.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the selfishness of landlords was originally responsible for\r\nthis method of protecting pigeons, but the government of the country at\r\nthat time also had something to do with it. Pigeon manure is very rich\r\nin niter, which in those days the government had difficulty in procuring\r\nin such quantities as it needed for the manufacture of gunpowder; so it\r\nadopted the policy of regulating the construction of pigeon houses,\r\nprescribing the method of disposing of the droppings to conserve the\r\nniter in them and appointing official inspectors to see that its\r\nregulations were observed, and collectors to gather the pigeon manure.\r\nIt was much easier to do this when large flocks were kept by landlords\r\nthan when an equal number of the birds were kept in small flocks by the\r\ntenants.\r\n\r\n=Place in domestication.= Although many farmers keep small flocks of\r\npigeons, the pigeon in modern times is a city bird rather than a country\r\nbird. The strong flying types are all well adapted to an independent\r\nlife in towns and cities, where, as has been stated, they often become a\r\nnuisance. This form of nuisance might be partly abated and perhaps\r\nprevented if city authorities would systematically and humanely\r\nexterminate the free flocks of common pigeons, and encourage citizens to\r\nbreed improved varieties under proper control.\r\n\r\nPigeon culture does not afford as many or as good opportunities for\r\nprofit as poultry culture does, but it is suited to conditions under\r\nwhich poultry do not thrive. A flock of pigeons may be permanently\r\nmaintained by a city resident who has so little room for domestic birds\r\nthat, if he kept poultry, he would have to renew his flock every year. A\r\nfew pigeons may be kept by any one who can provide a nesting place for\r\nthem where they will be safe from cats and rats. In this country the\r\ngrowing of squabs has been widely exploited in recent years as a\r\nprofitable commercial industry. Near large cities where the demand for\r\nsquabs is good, squab growing on a large scale is sometimes successful.\r\nElsewhere the small flock that can be cared for in the owner's spare\r\ntime is likely to be more profitable.\r\n\r\nThe breeding of fancy pigeons is also almost wholly a spare-time\r\noccupation. The demand for fancy pigeons is small in comparison with the\r\ndemand for fancy poultry, and a pigeon fancier's trade rarely grows so\r\nlarge that he can give his attention to it exclusively. In Europe the\r\nbreeding of pigeons for exhibition and sport is more popular than in\r\nAmerica, but the interest is growing rapidly in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF PIGEONS\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 206. Small pigeon house and fly[23]]\r\n\r\n[23] The photographs for illustrations in this chapter, when not\r\ncredited to others, are from Elmer E. Rice, Boston, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nAlmost every child knows something of the lives of the common pigeons\r\nthat are seen at large in both city and country. Some flocks have owners\r\nwho take a slight interest in them and make rude provisions for their\r\nsafety and comfort. Nearly all the country flocks, and many of the city\r\nflocks, are in this class. But there are in all large cities, and in\r\nsome smaller places, many flocks of pigeons which no one claims to own.\r\nThey build their nests in high cupolas, in the belfries of churches, on\r\nsheltered ledges under the cornices or other projections of high\r\nbuildings, and in all sorts of places from which they cannot be easily\r\ndislodged. The streets and areas of a great city afford daily food\r\nsufficient for vast numbers of birds. The principal part of this is\r\nfresh oats scattered by thousands of horses as they take their noon meal\r\nfrom pails or nose bags, and oats that, passing through the horses\r\nundigested, are mixed with the dust and dirt of the street. Very large\r\nquantities of food also fall on the streets from torn bags or broken\r\nboxes as cereal products are carted from place to place and handled in\r\ntransportation. Then there are the crumbs and remnants of food thrown\r\nfrom windows by innumerable people who carry their lunches when they go\r\nto their work; and besides these a great deal of waste food from the\r\noccupants of tenements, as well as from many hotel and restaurant\r\nkitchens. Much of this is thrown out at random, but often, when pigeons\r\nbegin to frequent places where food supplies are regular, the people\r\nthere take an interest in the birds and throw out more than they did\r\nbefore. From all these various sources an abundance of food is available\r\nfor birds that forage on the city streets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 207. House and fly for a small flock]\r\n\r\nThe pigeons do their part in saving this waste food, but the people\r\nderive little benefit from the saving, because so many pigeons are not\r\nkept under control, where their produce may be taken and used when it is\r\nready. Good management of pigeons consists in keeping them so that the\r\nowner gets all the benefits of ownership. Good management in the large\r\nsense requires that all pigeons shall be owned by some one who is\r\nresponsible for them, and who keeps them under full control or under\r\npartial control, as the circumstances in each case require.\r\n\r\n=Size of flock.= A flock of breeding pigeons may contain as many pairs\r\nas can nest in the place where they are kept. Most pigeon keepers prefer\r\nlofts about 12 or 14 feet square, because in larger spaces it is harder\r\nto catch the birds when they must be handled, and in many ways the very\r\nlarge flock makes extra trouble for the attendant. A place with a floor\r\narea of from 150 to 200 square feet will accommodate from fifty to sixty\r\npairs of breeding pigeons. Except when undertaking squab breeding on a\r\nlarge scale, pigeon keepers usually begin with a small number and keep\r\nmost of the increase until the full capacity of the loft is used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 208. Small barn and shed arranged for pigeon\r\nkeeping]\r\n\r\n=Quarters for pigeons.= A pair of pigeons may be kept in a coop, box, or\r\ncage about 3 feet square, and 2 or 3 feet high. A cage 4 or 5 feet high,\r\nor one as high as the room in which it is placed, is still better,\r\nbecause it will allow the birds a little room to use their wings. If\r\nsuch a cage has a few perches at various heights, the pigeons will not\r\nseem to miss their liberty. Such close confinement, however, is not\r\nrecommended except for those who cannot provide larger quarters, or who\r\nmerely wish to keep one or two pair a short time for observation. A\r\nhouse about 6 feet square makes a convenient size for a small breeding\r\nflock of pigeons. In a place of that size eight or ten pairs may be\r\nkept. Attached to it there should be a wire-inclosed fly, as pigeon\r\nkeepers call the outdoor compartment for pigeons. The size of the fly\r\ncan be adjusted to suit the conditions and the available space. The\r\nlarger the fly the better the pigeons will like it, but even a very\r\nsmall place where they can be much in the open air and lie and sun\r\nthemselves is better than constant confinement indoors, which makes them\r\nanemic and greatly reduces their vitality.\r\n\r\nWhere the space for pigeons is very limited and there is room for only\r\none small loft and fly, breeding operations are closely restricted. Most\r\npigeon fanciers want at least two lofts of this size--one for the\r\nbreeding birds, the other for the young birds that no longer need the\r\ncare of their parents. With such facilities the work in the breeding\r\nloft goes on better, and promising young birds can be kept until they\r\nare well matured and the breeder can tell whether it is advisable to\r\nkeep some of these and dispose of a part of the old ones.\r\n\r\nTo provide for larger numbers of birds, either more lofts or larger\r\nlofts may be made. A breeder of fancy pigeons usually prefers many small\r\ncompartments. A breeder of squabs for market makes each compartment as\r\nlarge as is convenient and builds as many as he has room for.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 209. Old poultry house arranged for pigeons.\r\n(Photograph from Dr. J. G. Robinson, Pembroke, Massachusetts)]\r\n\r\nBuildings for pigeons are constructed on the same plans as buildings for\r\nfowls. The furnishings of the pigeon loft are different from those of\r\nthe poultry house, and of course the fly is always completely inclosed.\r\nUpper floors or lofts of buildings are used for pigeons to much better\r\nadvantage than for poultry, but where there is room it is more\r\nsatisfactory to have all quarters for pigeons on the ground floor.\r\n\r\nAs the young pigeons remain in the nest and are fed by the parents until\r\nthey are almost full-grown, each pair of old pigeons must have their own\r\nnesting place. As has been stated, the domestic pigeon is a shelf\r\nbuilder. So in arranging for nests the pigeon keeper builds shelves 10\r\nor 12 inches apart, and divides these into compartments about 12 inches\r\nwide, thus forming pigeonholes. Because a hen pigeon often lays again\r\nand begins to incubate before a pair of young are ready to leave the\r\nnest, it is usual to arrange the pigeonholes in pairs. This is sometimes\r\ndone by omitting alternate dividing boards, making each pigeonhole twice\r\nthe size required, so that a nest can be made in each corner. Some\r\npeople prefer to have single pigeonholes and to arrange them in double\r\nsections by making each alternate perpendicular board project several\r\ninches beyond the front edge of the horizontal shelf. When this is done,\r\na pair of pigeons in possession of one side of a double section will\r\nusually claim the entire section and prevent others from entering it\r\neven when they are themselves using only one side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 210. City back-yard squab plant]\r\n\r\nFor indoor perches for pigeons individual perches shaped like an\r\ninverted V are most used. These are attached to the wall, one above\r\nanother, about 12 or 14 inches apart. The pigeons rest on the upper edge\r\nof the perch, and the sloping sides prevent their plumage from being\r\nsoiled by birds roosting above them. In the outdoor flies running boards\r\nare placed along the sides to make exercising and resting places for the\r\nbirds, for they usually prefer a shelf of this kind to the ground. Long\r\nperches are also placed in the fly when the running boards do not give\r\nroom for all the pigeons in the flock. Out of doors the birds get along\r\nvery well on long perches, but in the house each wants a separate perch.\r\nFeed hoppers like those used for fowls are used in pigeon houses.\r\nDrinking vessels for pigeons should be of the fountain type, exposing\r\nonly a small surface of water, because if the vessel is open the birds\r\nwill bathe in it. For the bath any circular vessel with a depth of 4 or\r\n5 inches and a diameter of 18 inches or over may be used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 211. Running boards in pigeon fly. (Photograph from\r\nSpringer Brothers, Bridgeton, New Jersey)]\r\n\r\n=Ventilation and cleanliness.= The ventilation of a pigeon house is\r\nmanaged in the same way as that of a poultry house, by adjusting the\r\nopenings in the front. Most kinds of pigeons are very rugged and, when\r\nfully feathered, can stand a great deal of cold. When a house is open in\r\nwinter, some of the young, unfledged squabs may be chilled and die from\r\nexposure, but breeders agree that, on the whole, it is better to keep\r\nthe windows or other openings for ventilation partly open at all times.\r\nWhile this causes some loss of the weaker squabs, it keeps the old birds\r\nin much better condition than when the house is tightly closed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 212. Constant water supply for pigeons]\r\n\r\nTo keep the loft looking clean and neat the droppings should be removed\r\nfrom the floor, and from all shelves that can be cleaned without\r\ndisturbing breeding birds, at least once a week. Many pigeon keepers\r\nclean the houses oftener than that, but if the ventilation is good and\r\nthe droppings are dry and firm, a house may go uncleaned for weeks or\r\nmonths without detriment to the birds. It is customary to keep the floor\r\nof the pigeon loft thinly covered with fine gravel, coarse sand,\r\nsawdust, or chaff. To prevent the wind from the pigeons' wings from\r\nblowing this from the middle to the sides of the floor, a small box is\r\nplaced in the middle of the floor. Whenever it is possible, the bath pan\r\nis placed outdoors, because in taking a bath pigeons splash the water a\r\ngreat deal, and if they are given the bath indoors, they will make a\r\nnasty mess of the house floor unless it is perfectly clean. The bath\r\nneed not be given oftener than once or twice a week. In bad weather it\r\nis better to let them go without a bath than to have them take one and\r\nget chilled before their feathers dry.\r\n\r\n=Handling pigeons.= When a few pigeons in a small loft get a great deal\r\nof attention, they usually become very tame and allow themselves to be\r\ncaught at any time. For catching pigeons that are shy, pigeon keepers\r\nuse a net, called a landing net, such as is used by fishermen. A pigeon\r\nis held securely in the hand by grasping it so that the breast of the\r\nbird lies in the palm and one wing is held against the side by the thumb\r\nand the other by the fingers. A pigeon may also be carried by the tips\r\nof the wings by bringing them together over the back and letting the\r\nbird hang by them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 213. Small pigeon house and fly]\r\n\r\n=Mating pigeons.= The beginner's first serious difficulty in breeding\r\npigeons is to get the birds in his loft all mated and each pair\r\nattending to the work of hatching and rearing its young. As has been\r\nsaid, the sexes cannot always be identified by appearance. Most of the\r\npigeons sold for breeding are young birds that have not yet mated. Some\r\nbreeders and dealers are very expert in selecting males and females, but\r\nall make some mistakes, and the average person makes a great many of\r\nthem. There are two ways of selling pigeons. The most common way is to\r\nsell the desired number of birds, the seller selecting, according to his\r\nbest judgment, equal numbers of males and females, with the\r\nunderstanding that if, when the birds mate, there is an excess of one\r\nsex, he will make a suitable exchange. The other way is to sell the\r\nnumber of pairs desired, guaranteeing them as mated pairs--which means\r\nthat the pairs are all known to be properly mated. The advantage of\r\nbuying guaranteed mated pairs is that the question of mating requires no\r\nfurther attention at the outset, but the prices for them are so much\r\nhigher than for those not known to be mated, that most beginners buy on\r\nthe other plan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 214. Large squab plant. (Photograph from Dr. J. G.\r\nRobinson, Pembroke, Massachusetts)]\r\n\r\nWhere the flock is small and the birds are to be allowed to select their\r\nown mates, all that is necessary is to watch them closely until all are\r\nmated or it is evident that there is a surplus of one sex. Surplus males\r\nwill quarrel persistently with the other males and endeavor to coax\r\ntheir mates away from them. The unmated males must be provided with\r\nmates or removed from the loft. Unmated females are not so readily\r\nnoticed except when there are only a few birds in the loft, but by close\r\nwatching they will soon be found. When a start is to be made with quite\r\na large number of unmated birds, the best plan is to put the flock first\r\nin a different apartment from that in which they are to be kept\r\npermanently, and, as each pair mate and begin to build their nest,\r\nremove them to their permanent quarters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 215. Neat pigeon house and fly]\r\n\r\nWhen it is desired to mate a particular male and female, the best way is\r\nto place them one in each side of a small coop with a wire partition\r\nacross the middle. This coop should be put where they cannot see other\r\npigeons. Sometimes one of the birds shows a decided antipathy to the\r\nother. In such a case it is, as a rule, useless to continue efforts to\r\ninduce them to pair. In most cases, however, the birds will soon show\r\nmutual affection. When this stage is reached, they may be taken to the\r\nloft and released. Short coarse straw or fine twigs should be placed\r\nwhere pigeons that are building nests can take what they want. No nest\r\nbox or pan is really needed, but many pigeon keepers use a nest bowl,\r\ncalled a nappy, of earthenware or wood fiber.\r\n\r\n=Feeding.= The food of pigeons consists almost wholly of grains and\r\nseeds. The principal grains used in America are wheat and corn (usually\r\ncracked corn). Field peas are also used quite extensively. While pigeons\r\nwill eat the same kinds of ground-grain products as are fed to poultry,\r\npigeon keepers rarely use such foods. They prefer to give a variety of\r\nhard grains and seeds. Those who keep large stocks of pigeons often buy\r\nseparately the feeds which they use, and mix the grains to suit\r\nthemselves, or feed them in such alternation as seems desirable. People\r\nwho keep only a few pairs of pigeons usually find it more satisfactory\r\nto buy the feed mixtures sold by dealers in pigeons' supplies. As a\r\nrule, old grain and seed that are very dry and hard are best for\r\npigeons, and especially for exhibition and breeding stock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 216. An attractive squab plant]\r\n\r\nThe most common practice is to give the feed in hoppers, keeping a\r\nsupply always before the birds. This is done principally because it is\r\nthe most convenient way, particularly for those who are away from home a\r\ngreat deal. For them hopper feeding is really necessary, but pigeon\r\nfanciers seem to agree that when the birds can be fed by throwing on the\r\nfloor of the loft or the fly, two or three times a day, just about the\r\nquantity of food that they need for a meal, they do better and the cost\r\nof food is less than by the hopper method. Unlike poultry, pigeons\r\nrequire considerable quantities of salt. The common practice is to keep\r\nit before them in the form of lumps of rock salt, one large lump being\r\nenough for the birds in a loft of ordinary size. Oyster shell should\r\nalso be supplied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 217. Homer squabs four weeks old]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 218. Carneaux squabs four weeks old]\r\n\r\n=How pigeons rear their young.= After a pair of pigeons have completed\r\ntheir nest, the male seems to come at once to the conclusion that home\r\nduties demand his mate's constant attention. At the nest he struts\r\nabout, cooing and coaxing, entering the nest himself, then leaving it\r\nand plainly showing his wish that she should take the nest. If she goes\r\naway from the nest, he follows her with his head high and his neck\r\ninflated. His cooing turns to scolding. He pecks at her and will not\r\ngive her a moment's peace until she returns to the nest. The hen lays\r\none egg and, after laying it, spends most of her time standing on the\r\nnest until the second or third day after, when she lays another egg and\r\nimmediately begins to sit. She seems to know that if she sat on the\r\nfirst egg before laying the other, one squab would hatch two or three\r\ndays earlier than the other, and the second squab, being smaller and\r\nweaker, would have a hard time. The work of incubation is done mostly by\r\nthe hen, the cock taking only a minor part. For about an hour in the\r\nmiddle of the morning and again in the middle of the afternoon he\r\nrelieves her on the nest, giving her a chance to eat, drink, and take\r\nsome exercise. Counting from the time the last egg was laid, the period\r\nof incubation is sixteen or seventeen days.\r\n\r\nYoung squabs, like all other young birds that are naked when hatched,\r\nare ugly little things. They have apparently insatiable appetites, and\r\ntheir mouths seem to be always open. They are fed by the parents with\r\npigeon milk, which is simply the usual food of the old birds softened in\r\nthe crop. The pigeon has the power of disgorging the contents of the\r\ncrop at will, and feeds its young by forcing food from its crop into\r\ntheir mouths. When they are well fed, the squabs grow very fast. Young\r\nHomers four weeks old often weigh from three quarters of a pound to a\r\npound, or even more, and are ready for market. Many of the fancy\r\nvarieties of pigeons are hard to rear, because the abnormal structure of\r\nthe beak or the interference of peculiar feather characters prevent the\r\nold ones from feeding their young properly. All the breeds described in\r\ndetail in the preceding chapter are known as good feeders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 219. Dressed squabs. (Photograph from Dr. J. G.\r\nRobinson, Pembroke, Massachusetts)]\r\n\r\nPigeons will breed nearly the year round, stopping only while molting,\r\nbut in cold climates many young birds die in the nests in winter. Those\r\nwho are breeding for market take this as one of the risks of their\r\nbusiness. If only half of the squabs are reared in winter, the profits\r\nmay be as great as when the actual results are much better, because in\r\nwinter the prices are much higher than at the seasons when squabs are\r\nmost easily produced. Fanciers do not usually allow their pigeons to\r\nbreed during the coldest winter months, but take the eggs from the nests\r\nor keep the sexes separate until spring approaches. The object of the\r\nfancier is to produce specimens having the finest possible development\r\nof form and color. He cannot do this successfully under conditions that\r\ncause heavy losses. The birds may grow under such conditions but will\r\nnot have the superior quality that he desires, and so he finds it more\r\nprofitable to concentrate all his attention upon the birds that he can\r\nproduce when the weather is most favorable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nCANARIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe canary is the only common cage bird. There are about fifty kinds of\r\nbirds that make desirable pets, but very few of them will breed in small\r\ncages, and many will not breed in confinement even when kept in large\r\naviaries. In the United States the number of kinds of cage birds is\r\nrestricted by state laws which prohibit keeping native song birds in\r\ncaptivity. Such laws are necessary to preserve the birds. Before these\r\nlaws were passed, great numbers of song birds were trapped every year to\r\nsend to Europe, where the keeping of cage birds as pets is more popular\r\nthan in America. Song birds from other parts of the world may be kept in\r\nthis country, but most of them are so scarce and expensive that few\r\npeople would buy them even if the canary were not a more satisfactory\r\npet.\r\n\r\n=Description.= The common domestic canary is a small bird, about five\r\ninches in length, very lively and sprightly in manner, and in color\r\nyellow or a greenish gray and yellow. The male and female are so much\r\nalike that the sex cannot be positively determined by the appearance.\r\nAlthough it often happens that the male is more slender in form and\r\nbrighter in color, the voice is a better index of sex and, in mature\r\nbirds of good singing stock, is very reliable. The male is the singer.\r\nThe female also has a singing voice, but it is so inferior in quality to\r\nthat of the male that few people care for it.\r\n\r\n=Origin.= The domestic canary belongs to the finch family and is found\r\nwild in the Canary Islands (from which it takes its name) and in a\r\nnumber of other islands in that part of the world. The color of the wild\r\nbirds is described, by some who have seen them, as greenish-gray,\r\nchanging to a greenish-yellow on the breast and under parts. Other\r\nobservers describe the wild birds of some localities as brownish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 220. Tricolor Canary[24]]\r\n\r\n[24] The illustrations in this chapter are from \"Our Domestic Animals,\"\r\nby Charles W. Burkett.\r\n\r\nThe canary was introduced into Europe about four hundred years ago. As\r\nthe story goes, a ship with a cargo from the Canary Islands, carrying\r\nseveral thousand canaries, which the traders thought might be sold in\r\nEurope, was wrecked off the coast of Italy early in the sixteenth\r\ncentury. Before the sailors left the ship, they opened the cages\r\ncontaining the canaries. The birds escaped to the Island of Elba and\r\nthere became established in the wild state. From this colony of canaries\r\nbirds were captured and distributed to all parts of Europe and America,\r\ntheir superior song powers and adaptability to domestication making them\r\npopular wherever they became known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 221. Norwich Canary with hood]\r\n\r\nThe wild bird known in America as the wild canary is the American\r\nGoldfinch. It belongs to the same family as the canary but is of a\r\ndifferent species. It is of no value as a singer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 222. Yorkshire Canary]\r\n\r\n=Improvement in domestication.= Nearly all the varieties of the canary\r\nwere developed before the eighteenth century. The German canary fanciers\r\nturned their attention to developing the song of the bird, the Belgian\r\nand British fanciers to making and perfecting shape and color varieties.\r\nIn Germany the celebrated Harz Mountain Canaries were produced. These\r\nare simply common canaries carefully bred and trained for singing. But\r\ntheir excellence as singers is not due to breeding and training alone;\r\nthe climate of the Harz Mountain region seems to be peculiarly suited to\r\nthe development of canaries with beautiful voices. The finest Harz\r\nMountain Canaries are produced at St. Andreasberg, a health resort noted\r\nfor its pure and bracing air. The St. Andreasberg Roller is a canary\r\ntrained to sing with a peculiar rolling note.\r\n\r\nAmong fancy types of canaries the most interesting are the Norwich\r\nCanary, which is larger than the singing canaries and has reddish-yellow\r\nplumage; the Manchester Coppy, a yellow canary almost as large as a\r\nsmall pigeon; the Lizard Canaries (Silver and Golden), which have\r\nspangled markings on the back; the London Fancy Canary, which has an\r\norange body with black wings and tail; and the Belgian Canary, a\r\nmalformed type in which the head appears to grow out of the breast\r\ninstead of being carried above the shoulders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 223. Belgian Canary]\r\n\r\n=Place in domestication.= Most people who have canaries keep them for\r\npets, and have only a few. In perhaps the greater number of cases a\r\nsingle bird--a singer--satisfies the canary lover. A few of those who\r\nkeep canaries as pets also breed them for sale. Occasionally a canary\r\nfancier devotes a room in his house entirely to his birds and, when\r\nbreeding on such a scale, has a great many to sell. The commercial side\r\nof canary breeding, however, is usually subordinate, except in the Harz\r\nMountain district, where the breeding and training of singing canaries\r\nis a very important cottage industry. Canaries from this district are\r\nsold all over the civilized world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 224. English Flatheaded Canary]\r\n\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF CANARIES\r\n\r\n=Cages.= The common wire bird cages used for one or two canaries are so\r\nwell known that no description of them is necessary. For larger numbers\r\nlarger cages must be provided. Large cages cannot always be obtained at\r\nstores which sell the small ones, but they may be obtained from bird\r\nstores in the large cities, or made to order by a local mechanic.\r\nIndeed, any clever boy who has learned to use tools can make one at very\r\nlittle cost. While the small cages are usually made all of metal, the\r\nlarge ones are commonly made with wooden frames. A small cage has a\r\nremovable bottom. A large cage must have two bottoms--the outer one\r\nfixed, the inner one in the form of a movable drawer. A metal drawer is\r\neasier to keep clean than a wooden one.\r\n\r\n=Position of the cage.= The cage in an ordinary room should be hung\r\nwhere its occupants will be comfortable and safe. The greatest foe of\r\nthe domestic canary is the house cat. Some cats can be trained to let\r\ncanaries alone, but very few can be trusted to make no attempt to get a\r\ncanary when left alone in a room with it. When canaries and cats are\r\nkept in the same house, the cage should hang in a place from which cats\r\ncan be excluded when they cannot be watched. The comfort of the bird\r\nwill often require that the position of the cage be changed once or\r\noftener during the day, according to the season or to some particular\r\ncondition. Thus, a sunny window may be very pleasant at some times and\r\ntoo warm at others, or a bird may tire of being constantly in the same\r\nplace. The bird keeper has to learn to know, by observing the actions of\r\nbirds, when they are comfortable and contented, and must use judgment in\r\nplacing the cage to suit them.\r\n\r\n=Feeding.= Canaries live mostly on ripe seeds, but they are also very\r\nfond of the leaves, flowers, and green seeds of many common plants.\r\nBeing such small birds, they eat only small seeds. The seeds most used\r\nas food for canaries are hempseed, flaxseed, rapeseed, and canary seed,\r\nwhich is the seed of the canary grass, a plant indigenous to the Canary\r\nIslands. These are often sold mixed under the trade name of \"birdseed.\"\r\nMany canary fanciers think that it is better to feed the seeds\r\nseparately, or to make the mixtures themselves, so that they can know\r\njust what the birds eat, and can judge whether any trouble which may\r\narise is due to a wrong diet. Rapeseed and canary seed are considered\r\nthe best and safest feed for canaries. They may be mixed in equal parts\r\nand kept before the birds at all times. Canaries like hempseed better\r\nthan anything else, but it is so rich that, if fed heavily, it is\r\ninjurious. When a mixture of seeds containing hempseed is placed in the\r\nfeed cup, canaries will pick out and scatter and waste the other seeds,\r\nto get the hempseed. For this reason it is often left out of the mixture\r\nand given occasionally, a few grains at a time.\r\n\r\nCanaries are very fond of lettuce, chickweed, and plantain. They also\r\nlike the green seeds of many grasses. These things may be given to them\r\nby fastening the leaves or stalks between the wires of the cage where\r\nthe birds can reach them easily. A piece of cuttlefish bone should be\r\nplaced where the birds can eat some whenever they want it. Cuttle bone\r\nfurnishes them with salt and lime.\r\n\r\n=Care.= Canaries should have regular attention. Aside from having the\r\nposition of the cage changed when necessary, they usually require\r\nattention only once a day. This should be at a regular hour, preferably\r\nin the morning. The cage should be placed on a table or stand, and the\r\nbottom removed, that it may be thoroughly cleaned. The best way is to\r\nwash it. While the bottom of the cage is being cleaned the cage with the\r\nbird in it rests upon the table. This is the best time to give the bird\r\nits bath. A shallow pan or dish containing about an inch of water is\r\nplaced on the table under the bottomless cage. Some birds splash so\r\nvigorously that the bath must be given in a room containing nothing that\r\nwould be damaged by the drops of water which they scatter. Some seem to\r\nunderstand that the harder they splash the more trouble they make, and\r\nto take delight in wetting everything about them.\r\n\r\nWhen the bird has had its bath, the cage should be wiped dry, the bottom\r\nreplaced, the drinking cup rinsed and refilled, and the seed cup filled.\r\nIf a bird is very tame and can be easily caught, it may be let out of\r\nthe cage for its bath and for a little exercise. Many canaries will\r\nreturn voluntarily to their cages after bathing and flying around the\r\nroom a few times. Canary fanciers frequently allow their birds the\r\nfreedom of the room for hours at a time. Whenever this is done, special\r\ncare must be taken that no unexpected opening of a door allows the bird\r\nto escape from the room. Neglect of this point often leads to the loss\r\nof a valued bird.\r\n\r\n=Breeding.= The breeding season for canaries is from February until May\r\nor June. The cage for a breeding pair should be a little larger than\r\nthat used for a single bird, and should be firmly attached to the wall\r\ninstead of hanging where it can swing. The nest is usually a small wire\r\nbasket. For nest material cotton batting and cow's hair or deer's hair\r\nare used. Deer's hair may be obtained at bird stores. These materials\r\nare placed in the cage and the birds use what they want. The hen lays\r\nfrom four to six eggs. The period of incubation is two weeks. During the\r\nbreeding season the birds should be fed, in addition to the usual supply\r\nof seed, a little grated hard-boiled egg with cracker or bread crumbs.\r\nThey also need a supply of fine oyster shells. By the time the young are\r\nthree weeks old they are able to leave the nest and to feed themselves.\r\nThey should then be removed to a separate cage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION OF MARKET PRODUCTS\r\n\r\n\r\n=Producers, consumers, and middlemen.= The preceding chapters have\r\ntreated of the characters and the uses of domestic birds, and of the\r\nmethods of producing them. In this chapter we shall consider matters\r\nrelating to the distribution of such of their products as are staple\r\narticles of commerce. There are very few subjects of general interest\r\nthat are as widely misunderstood as some phases of the distribution of\r\nmarket eggs and poultry. Every one uses these products; many millions of\r\npeople produce them in small quantities; but the consumers who are not\r\nproducers live mostly in cities remote from the farming sections which\r\nhave great surpluses of eggs and poultry to send to the cities, and so\r\nthe work of distributing these products is done principally by traders,\r\nor middlemen.\r\n\r\nThe modern developments of poultry culture have been in a very large\r\nmeasure due to middlemen and could not continue without them. In a large\r\nand highly organized population middlemen in many different capacities\r\nperform the services which in primitive or small communities may be\r\nperformed by either the producer or the consumer. Consumers and\r\nproducers are apt to think that the middlemen get more than their fair\r\nshare of the profits on the articles that they buy and sell. The true\r\nsituation and the exact relations of producers, middlemen, and consumers\r\nof poultry products are easily understood if we study the development of\r\nthe existing methods of distribution from the beginning.\r\n\r\n=How the middleman enters local trade.= Suppose that a farmer brings to\r\ntown 30 dozen eggs; that the storekeeper will allow him 20 cents a dozen\r\nfor them; and that by peddling them from house to house he can sell\r\nthem for 25 cents a dozen: how much will he make by selling them\r\ndirectly to the consumers?\r\n\r\nAs an arithmetical example, considering only the factors which appear in\r\nthe statement, this is a very simple problem. It is easy to compute that\r\nby selling the eggs from house to house the farmer will make $1.50. But\r\nthe farmer's practical problem in disposing of his eggs has some very\r\nimportant factors which do not appear in a simple arithmetical problem.\r\nUnless he had regular customers for his eggs, he would probably have to\r\ncall at fifty or sixty houses to sell them. He might have to call at a\r\ngreat many more, and then might not succeed in selling them all. He\r\nwould find that it was of little use to try to sell eggs to families\r\nthat had not engaged them in advance, unless he called very early in the\r\nmorning, before they had ordered eggs from some one else. If he\r\nsucceeded in selling all the eggs, he would still have to consider\r\nwhether it paid him better to spend his time, and that of his team, in\r\nselling the eggs than in working on the farm. Most farmers find that\r\nthey cannot afford to peddle produce themselves, and unless some other\r\nmember of the family can do it without interfering with important farm\r\nwork, they sell such products as poultry, butter, and eggs to the\r\nstorekeepers.\r\n\r\nNow take the consumer's side of the case. The ordinary family uses only\r\n2 or 3 dozen eggs a week. If the eggs can be bought at the store for 25\r\ncents a dozen, and at a farm for 15 cents a dozen, there is an apparent\r\nsaving of 20 or 30 cents by purchasing them at the farm. But in most\r\ncases it would cost the buyer more than 20 or 30 cents to go to the farm\r\nand get the eggs, and so he goes to the store for them.\r\n\r\nThe storekeeper is the middleman, really serving both producer and\r\nconsumer. Every one can see this clearly in cases where there is only\r\none middleman.\r\n\r\n=Additional middlemen.= If the farmers trading at a country store bring\r\nto it more eggs than the people in the town will buy, the storekeeper\r\nmust either sell them elsewhere or refuse to take them. If possible, he\r\nwill find a market for the surplus, usually by shipping them to the\r\nnearest large city. But he does not send them direct to consumers, for\r\nhe could not deal with them any better than the farmers could with the\r\npeople in his town. He may send them to a storekeeper in the city, but\r\nhe is more likely to send them to some one who makes a business of\r\nreceiving eggs from country collectors and selling them at wholesale\r\nwherever there is a demand for them. If the receipts in a city exceed\r\nthe local requirements, the surplus will be sent to one of the great\r\ncities which are the principal receiving centers for produce of all\r\nkinds. The large receivers in the great cities distribute the eggs to\r\nretailers in the cities and also to jobbers and retailers in smaller\r\ncities where local supplies are inadequate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 225. Unloading coops of poultry at a receiving\r\nwarehouse. (Photograph from the Bureau of Chemistry, United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture)]\r\n\r\nThus between the producer and the consumer there may be as many as six\r\nor seven middlemen who in turn handle the eggs. At first thought it\r\nseems that so many middlemen are not necessary. But it is not a\r\nquestion of numbers; it is a question of conditions. The number depends\r\nmore or less upon whether the middleman at any stage finds it more\r\nadvantageous to deal with one next to him in the general series or to\r\npass one or more and deal with another farther away. In the United\r\nStates prices of eggs are finally determined by the demand and supply in\r\nthe large cities of the East; the prices at other points are usually the\r\nprices in these cities, minus the cost of transportation and handling.\r\nIn periods of scarcity, however, there is a tendency to uniformity of\r\nprices in all large cities.\r\n\r\nThe movements of poultry to market are made in much the same way as the\r\nmovement of eggs. As a rule the same people handle both.\r\n\r\n=How the demand for poultry products stimulates production.= In the\r\npreceding sections it was assumed, for the purpose of showing clearly\r\nthe relation of the middleman to both the producer and the consumer,\r\nthat the movement of these articles from the country producer to the\r\ncity buyer came about as the result of the existence of a surplus in\r\nfarming districts. As a matter of fact the movement is produced by the\r\ndemand in localities which do not produce their own supplies. One effect\r\nof the increase of population in cities is to cause farmers near the\r\ncities to grow more poultry and sometimes to establish special poultry\r\nfarms. But as grain and labor cost more near the cities, the poultry and\r\neggs produced near them must be sold at high prices. If the city people\r\nwere dependent upon these local supplies, only the rich could afford\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAs this is true of all perishable food articles, as well as of poultry\r\nproducts, the growth of cities was restricted as long as there was no\r\nmeans of bringing provisions quickly from places where they could be\r\nproduced at low cost. When steam railroads were built, this restriction\r\non the growth of cities was partly removed. Many cities then began to\r\ngrow very fast, and the demands of their population for cheap food led\r\ncity dealers in provisions to look for supplies in the towns and farms\r\nalong the railroads. Many such dealers had before collected provisions\r\nby wagon as far from the city as was practicable. These men could now\r\ngreatly extend their routes, because, having collected a wagon-load,\r\nthey could take it to the most convenient railway station, ship it by\r\nrail to the city, and go on collecting, instead of spending a day or\r\nmore in delivering their load in the city. Very soon after railroads\r\nwere first built, many farmers began to produce more poultry and eggs\r\nand to ship them directly to the best city market that they could find.\r\nAs the demand for their produce was usually much greater than could be\r\nsupplied from their own farms, such farmers often began to buy from\r\ntheir neighbors, thus becoming middlemen as well as producers. In many\r\ncases such men would after a time find it to their advantage to move\r\ntheir headquarters to the city, and would ultimately build up a very\r\nlarge business.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 226. Fattening chickens in crates at a poultry\r\nbuyer's warehouse.[25] (Photograph from the Bureau of Chemistry, United\r\nStates Department of Agriculture)]\r\n\r\n[25] If the farmer sells his chickens without fattening, the buyer can\r\nfatten them in this way and so make an extra profit.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all farming sections, even those most remote from city\r\nmarkets, there is a short period in the spring when there is a large\r\nsurplus of eggs and sometimes a period in the fall when there is more\r\npoultry ready for market than can be sold; but the people in those\r\nplaces rarely make any effort to increase their production, and to\r\nextend the seasons when they have more than enough for themselves, until\r\nthey have good facilities for shipping eggs and poultry and the demands\r\nfrom outside cause a marked increase in the local prices of these\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 227. Driving turkeys to market. (Photograph from\r\nBureau of Chemistry, United States Department of Agriculture)]\r\n\r\nSo from the city and the country, almost simultaneously, but with the\r\ndemand from the city most active and pressing, the modern system of\r\ncollecting and distributing poultry products has grown. At first poultry\r\nproducts were nearly all handled by men who dealt in all kinds of\r\ncountry produce. As the business increased, many firms gave their\r\nattention exclusively to poultry products. Then, when creameries were\r\nestablished in many places, the creamery was found a convenient place\r\nfor the collection of eggs. The large packing houses which handle other\r\nkinds of meat also entered this field and became a very important factor\r\nin the development of poultry culture in the West.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 228. A big drive of turkeys arriving at a killing\r\nhouse. (Photograph from Bureau of Chemistry, United States Department of\r\nAgriculture])\r\n\r\nIn the collection and distribution of poultry products the various\r\nagencies mentioned form a great many different kinds of combinations.\r\nThe arrangements vary according to many different conditions. From first\r\nto last every one who handles an article is trying to make all he can\r\nout of it, but most of the middlemen deal fairly both in buying and in\r\nselling. Indeed, people cannot continue long in any legitimate business\r\nunless they are honest. As we shall see, middlemen are in a position\r\nwhere they are often blamed without just cause, and often have to take\r\nmuch greater risks than either producers or consumers.\r\n\r\n=Losses in distribution.= It has been said that the general tendency is\r\nto reduce as far as possible the number of middlemen concerned in the\r\ndistribution of poultry products. This tendency often goes too far and\r\noverreaches its purpose of economy. The efforts of producers and country\r\ncollectors to deal directly with consumers and retailers in the large\r\ncities often give them less profit than would be obtained by selling\r\nthrough the regular channels of the trade. The reason for this is that\r\nmost producers and a majority of country collectors do not prepare and\r\npack their poultry and eggs so that they will reach those to whom they\r\nare consigned in good condition and bring the prices which the shippers\r\nexpected to realize. The losses due to improper handling of eggs and\r\npoultry by producers and small collectors are enormous, undoubtedly\r\namounting to more than $100,000,000 a year in the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 229. Candling eggs.[26] (Photograph from Bureau of\r\nChemistry, United States Department of Agriculture)]\r\n\r\n[26] The man is posing for the photograph. When he works, the room must\r\nbe dark except for the covered light used in candling.\r\n\r\nTo place eggs and poultry in the hands of consumers in strictly\r\nfirst-class condition, they must be handled with great care at every\r\nstage of preparation and distribution. Eggs must be gathered while\r\nperfectly fresh, kept in a cool place where no bad odors will reach\r\nthem, and protected from heat and frost, as well as from breakage, when\r\nbeing moved from place to place. If the producer is careless about any\r\nof these points, many of his eggs will be tainted or stale or beginning\r\nto rot when they are only a few days old, and though he may call them\r\nfresh eggs and try to sell them as such, he will not get the highest\r\nprice for them. The small collectors are also likely to be careless in\r\nhandling eggs, and to ship them to receivers in bad condition.\r\n\r\nThe receivers in the cities, whose whole business is in perishable\r\nproducts, cannot afford to handle goods in this slipshod way. They\r\ncandle the eggs that are forwarded to them to determine the quality, and\r\npay for eggs not only according to their external appearance, but also\r\nthe appearance and condition of the package in which they are received.\r\nCandling eggs consists in passing them before a bright light, as in\r\ntesting to determine the fertility of eggs that are being incubated.\r\nWhen the egg is held before a light, the expert candler can tell in an\r\ninstant whether it is fresh and good and, if not, just what is wrong\r\nwith it. Except when kept at almost freezing temperature, eggs that have\r\nbegun to decompose continue to deteriorate quite rapidly. Sometimes a\r\nlot of eggs is candled several times and the bad ones removed, before it\r\nreaches the last dealer who handles it.\r\n\r\nMarket poultry and pigeons are sold both alive and dead. Most dead\r\npoultry is dressed (that is, has the feathers removed), but pigeons and\r\nguineas are often marketed dead without plucking, and occasionally\r\nturkeys are treated in the same way. Live birds lose weight in\r\ntransportation, especially when they are shipped in crowded and badly\r\nventilated coops. Frequently many birds in a shipment die before their\r\njourney is over. Because of such losses, and because the price per pound\r\nof the best dressed poultry is usually much higher than the price per\r\npound of the best live poultry, the impression that it is more\r\nprofitable for a producer to dress his poultry is widespread. The result\r\nis that a great many people who have poultry to sell dress it just as\r\nthey would to use at home and, putting it into a box or a barrel, ship\r\nit to a market where the prices are high, expecting to get the highest\r\nprice for it. A large part of such poultry arrives on the market in such\r\na condition that it is hard to sell at any price, and much of it has to\r\nbe thrown away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 230. Barrel of dressed poultry opened on arrival at\r\nits destination.[27] (Photograph from Bureau of Chemistry, United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture)]\r\n\r\n[27] Note the large piece of ice remaining. If the ice should give out\r\non the way, the poultry would spoil.\r\n\r\nBirds that are to be marketed should be kept without food or water for\r\nfrom twenty-four to thirty-six hours before killing. The object of this\r\nis to have the crop, gizzard, and intestines entirely empty. The killing\r\nis done by making a small, deep cut, that will at the same time\r\npenetrate the brain (making the bird unconscious) and sever one or two\r\nveins, thus letting the blood flow freely. This cut is usually made in\r\nthe roof of the mouth, but sometimes in the neck. The former method is\r\npreferred because it leaves no wound exposed to the air. The common\r\npractice in picking poultry for home use is to scald the bird in water\r\njust below the boiling temperature. When this is done just right, the\r\nresults are very good; the feathers come off easily and the skin is not\r\ndamaged. But if the bird is not held in the scalding water long enough,\r\nthe feathers are hard to remove and the skin may be torn in several\r\nplaces in the process. If the bird is held in the water too long, the\r\nskin will be partly cooked. If it is scalded before it has been properly\r\nbled, the hot water will turn the skin red. The defects in scalded\r\npoultry do not show badly at first, and if it is packed and shipped at\r\nonce, the shipper may think that it was in very good condition; but if\r\nhe could see it when the receiver unpacks it, he would be surprised to\r\nfind how many blemishes there were on it and how poor it looked.\r\nRemoving the feathers without scalding is called dry picking. It is an\r\nart which requires considerable practice. The novice who tries it\r\nusually tears the skin of the birds badly.\r\n\r\nIn order to reach the market in good condition, poultry must not only be\r\nproperly killed and picked, but each carcass must be cooled as quickly\r\nas possible, to remove the animal heat that remains in it. This is done\r\neither by hanging the carcasses in a very cool place or by putting them\r\nin cold water. Meat of all kinds that is cooled immediately after\r\nkilling will keep much longer than if cooling is neglected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 231. A badly dressed and a well-dressed fowl.\r\n(Photograph from Bureau of Chemistry, United States Department of\r\nAgriculture)]\r\n\r\nThere are so many details which must have attention in dressing poultry\r\nfor shipment, that it usually pays both producers and small collectors\r\nto sell poultry alive to those who have better facilities for handling\r\nit and whose operations are on such a scale that they can employ experts\r\nfor all parts of the work of preparation.\r\n\r\n=Cold storage of poultry products.= So abundant are the supplies of eggs\r\nin the spring, and of some kinds of dressed poultry in the summer, fall,\r\nand early winter, that large quantities could not be sold at any price\r\nat seasons of plenty if there were no way of keeping them until a season\r\nof scarcity. For about half a century after the production of eggs and\r\npoultry began to receive special attention in this country, the profits\r\nof the ordinary producer were severely cut every spring and fall,\r\nbecause the market was overstocked. Consumers derived little benefit\r\nfrom this situation, because they could not use the surplus before it\r\nspoiled. The popular idea of the way to remedy the conditions was to\r\nhave hens lay when eggs were scarce, and to have poultry ready for sale\r\nwhen supplies were insufficient. Experience, however, has shown that it\r\nis practically impossible to have a very large proportion of things of\r\nthis kind produced out of their natural season. The relatively small\r\nnumbers of people who succeed in doing so make very good profits, but\r\nthe masses of producers and consumers are not benefited.\r\n\r\nThe solution of the problem of carrying the surplus of a season of\r\nabundance to a season of scarcity was discovered when methods of making\r\nice artificially were perfected and it was found that the equipment used\r\nin manufacturing ice could be used to cool, to any desired degree, rooms\r\nfor the storage of perishable produce. This form of refrigeration was at\r\nfirst used in place of the ordinary method (with natural ice), to keep\r\ngoods for short periods. Much larger quantities could be taken care of\r\nin this way when for any reason a market was temporarily overstocked.\r\n\r\nFor hundreds of years it had been quite a common practice to preserve\r\neggs in various ways. By packing them in salt, or in salt brine, or in\r\nlimewater, eggs may be kept in very good condition for several months,\r\nand sometimes for nearly a year. As limed and pickled eggs were\r\nregularly sold in the markets, every dealer in eggs at once saw the\r\npossibilities of cold storage as a factor in the market egg trade.\r\nWherever there was a storage house, dealers began to buy eggs when\r\nprices were low, and store them to sell when prices were high. At first\r\na great many of those who stored eggs lost money on them, either by the\r\neggs spoiling in storage or because they kept the eggs too long, but\r\nafter a few years' experience the operators of cold-storage plants\r\nlearned the best temperatures for keeping the different kinds of produce\r\nand the best methods of arranging different articles in the chambers of\r\nthe storage warehouses. They found that eggs kept best at 34 degrees\r\nFahrenheit, that poultry must be frozen hard, and that the temperature\r\nin a storage chamber must not be allowed to vary. Those who were putting\r\neggs and poultry in cold storage found that it did not pay to store\r\nproduce that was not perfectly sound and good, and that products which\r\nhad been in cold storage must be used promptly after being taken out,\r\nand also that they must plan their sales to have all stored goods sold\r\nbefore the new crop began to come in, or they would lose money.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 232. Dressed fowls cooling on racks in dry-cooling\r\nroom. (Photograph from Bureau of Chemistry, United States Department of\r\nAgriculture)]\r\n\r\nThe development of cold-storage methods and their extensive use have\r\nbeen of great benefit to producers and consumers, as well as to\r\ndistributors of perishable food products. The storing of such products\r\nis a legitimate form of speculative business. It prevents waste and\r\nloss. The demand for eggs and poultry to go into cold storage raises the\r\nprice at seasons of plenty and makes a good market for all eggs and\r\npoultry that are fit to store. The eggs and poultry that have been\r\nstored furnish consumers with supplies at reasonable prices for much\r\nlonger seasons. As a rule supplies in storage are not kept there for\r\nvery long periods. Speculators who want to be on the safe side plan very\r\ncarefully so that most, if not all, of the stuff that they have stored\r\nshall be sold before new supplies become abundant in the market. To do\r\nthis they have to watch very closely every condition affecting the\r\nmarkets, and to use good judgment in selling. Most of them do not, as is\r\npopularly supposed, hold their entire stock for the period when prices\r\nare highest. If they did, all would lose. Eggs begin to come out of\r\nstorage about midsummer, and are withdrawn gradually for about six\r\nmonths. By far the greater part of the poultry stored goes into the\r\nwarehouses in the fall and begins to come out soon after the winter\r\nholidays.\r\n\r\nWithin the limits of the time that goods may be carried in cold storage\r\nprofitably, long storage has no more bad effects on eggs and poultry\r\nthan refrigeration for short periods. Cold-storage products are usually\r\nof better than average quality if used immediately upon being withdrawn\r\nfrom storage.\r\n\r\n=Methods of selling at retail.= For convenience in handling and counting\r\nthem in quantities, eggs are packed in cases containing thirty dozen\r\neach, and wholesale transactions in eggs are by the case, but with the\r\nprice usually quoted by the dozen. Consumers who use large quantities of\r\neggs buy them by the case. The ordinary consumer buys them by the dozen.\r\nThere is a widespread impression that, inasmuch as eggs vary greatly in\r\nsize, the practice of selling them by count is not fair to the consumer.\r\nThis feeling sometimes goes so far that laws are proposed, and even\r\npassed, requiring that eggs shall be sold by weight. Such a law does\r\nnot remain long in force, because weighing small quantities of eggs is\r\ntroublesome and the greater number of consumers prefer to buy them by\r\nthe dozen. In fact, while eggs are nominally sold by count both at\r\nwholesale and at retail, they are usually assorted according to size,\r\nand the prices graduated to suit. Considering size, condition, quality,\r\nand color of shell, as many as ten grades of eggs are sometimes made.\r\nAlthough the color of the shell of an egg has no relation whatever to\r\nits palatability or its nutritive value, eggs of a certain color\r\nsometimes command a premium. Thus, in New York City white eggs of the\r\nbest grades will bring from five to ten cents a dozen more than brown\r\neggs of equal quality, while in Boston the situation is exactly\r\nreversed.\r\n\r\nWhen most of the poultry of each kind in any market is of about the same\r\nsize and quality, it is customary to sell live poultry at wholesale at a\r\nuniform price by the dozen, and to sell at retail by the piece or by the\r\npair. But as soon as any considerable part of the poultry of any kind in\r\na market is larger than the general run of supplies, a difference is\r\nmade, in the prices per dozen or per piece or per pair, between small\r\nbirds and large ones. If the size of the largest specimens further\r\nincreases, the range of weights becomes too great to be classified in\r\nthis way, and selling by weight soon becomes the common practice.\r\nConditions are the same for dead poultry, except that the change to\r\nselling by weight comes more quickly.\r\n\r\nIn preparing poultry for market by the method that has been described\r\nthe head and feet were left on and the internal organs were not removed.\r\nThe reason for this is that poultry keeps much better in this state.\r\nRemoving these parts exposes the flesh at several places to the action\r\nof the air and of bacteria, which cause putrefaction. In many markets in\r\npoultry-producing sections it is customary to sell poultry drawn and\r\nwith the head and feet off. In places where most of the poultry comes\r\nfrom a distance the waste parts of the carcass are not removed until it\r\nis bought by the consumer. Some people who buy in this way think that\r\nthey are being defrauded if the marketman weighs the bird before\r\nremoving the offal. Sometimes, to satisfy such a customer, a dealer\r\nremoves the offal before weighing, and the customer cheerfully pays a\r\nhigher rate per pound, feeling that at any rate he is getting just what\r\nhe pays for when he insists on having it done in this way. As far as the\r\ncost is concerned, it makes no difference to the consumer at what stage\r\nof distribution the offal is discarded.\r\n\r\n=Volume of products.= In the United States and Canada the production and\r\nconsumption of poultry products are very nearly equal, because each\r\ncountry has agricultural areas capable of supplying an enormous\r\npopulation with poultry and eggs. Production in such districts responds\r\nquickly to the increasing demands of other sections, but not in such\r\nvolume as to create large surpluses for export. The present annual\r\nproduction of the United States is variously estimated at from\r\n$600,000,000 to $1,000,000,000. This wide difference exists because the\r\ncensus is only a partial one. In Canada no general census of poultry\r\nproducts has ever been taken.\r\n\r\nThe poultry statistics for the United States as collected decennially by\r\nthe Bureau of the Census may be found complete in the full report of\r\nagricultural statistics. Those for the different states may be obtained\r\nin separate bulletins. Some of the states and provinces collect poultry\r\nstatistics through state and provincial departments and furnish the\r\nreports to all persons desiring them. Persons living in communities\r\nwhich ship poultry products can usually learn from the local shippers\r\nthe approximate amounts and the value of the produce that they handle.\r\nAt the more important receiving points statistics of receipts are kept\r\nby such organizations as the Produce Exchange, Board of Trade, or\r\nChamber of Commerce, and the results published in their annual reports.\r\nFrom such sources it is possible for pupils to get information as to the\r\nstatus and importance of the poultry trade in the communities in which\r\nthey live.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nEXHIBITIONS AND THE FANCY TRADE\r\n\r\n\r\n=Conditions in the fancy trade.= The trade in fancy poultry and pigeons\r\nand in cage birds is on a very different basis from the trade in market\r\nproducts. With the arrangements for collecting poultry products and for\r\nholding them when that is desirable, it seldom happens that market\r\nproducts cannot be sold at any time when the producer wants to dispose\r\nof them. The fancy trade is quite closely limited to certain short\r\nseasons. In this trade prices depend as much upon the reputation of the\r\nseller as upon the quality of his stock. Very high prices are obtained\r\nonly by those who have made a big reputation by winning at important\r\nshows, and have advertised their winnings extensively. Buyers of fancy\r\nstock prefer to deal directly with producers, and the greater part of\r\nthe business is mail-order business. It is almost impossible to force\r\nthe sale of this class of stock except by selling it for the table at\r\nmarket prices. The producer can only advertise and wait for customers,\r\nand what is not sold at fancy prices must be sold at market prices.\r\n\r\n=Exhibitions.= Competitive exhibitions hold a very important place in\r\nthe development and distribution of improved stocks of animals. In old\r\ntimes such exhibitions were informal gatherings of the persons in a\r\nlocality who were interested in the improvement of a particular breed or\r\nvariety. Our knowledge of these early gatherings of breeders of domestic\r\nbirds is very limited and is mostly traditional. From what is known it\r\nappears that they were usually held in the evenings at public houses,\r\nand that each person taking part carried with him to the place of\r\nmeeting one or more of his best birds; that these were compared and\r\ntheir qualities discussed by the company, and that at the close each\r\nparticipant carried his exhibit home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 233. View of a section of a large poultry show in\r\nMechanics Building, Boston, Massachusetts]\r\n\r\nAs the interest in breeding for fancy points extended, such gatherings\r\nbecame larger and assumed a more formal character, and rules were\r\nadopted for comparing, or judging, the birds; but it was not until about\r\nthe middle of the nineteenth century that the modern system of public\r\nexhibitions of poultry, pigeons, cage birds, and pet stock was\r\ninaugurated. The first exhibitions of this kind were held at the\r\nagricultural fairs. Very soon after these began to attract attention,\r\nspecial exhibitions, limited to this class of stock and held in suitable\r\nbuildings in the winter, became frequent. Now large shows are held\r\nannually in nearly every large city and in hundreds of smaller cities,\r\nand every agricultural fair has its poultry department. For the sake of\r\nbrevity, shows at which poultry is the principal feature are called\r\nsimply poultry shows, although they often include other kinds of\r\ndomestic birds and all kinds of small domestic animals.\r\n\r\nA large poultry show, with a great variety of exhibits of birds and of\r\nthe appliances used in aviculture, affords an excellent opportunity to\r\nsee good specimens of many kinds. Those who have such an opportunity\r\nought to make the most of it. But the novice who can attend only small\r\nshows will find that, while he does not see as many different kinds of\r\nbirds there and may not see many really fine specimens, the small show\r\naffords the beginner a much better opportunity to learn something about\r\nthe differences that affect quality and value in fancy poultry and\r\npigeons.\r\n\r\nAt the large show there is so much to see, and the differences between\r\nthe winning specimens in any class are usually so slight, that only\r\nthose who are familiar with many varieties can make a critical\r\nexamination of the exhibits. At the smaller shows the varieties are not\r\nas numerous, the competing classes are smaller, and the differences\r\nbetween the specimens which win prizes are often plainly apparent, even\r\nto a novice, if he has a clue to the method of making the awards. Those\r\nwho visit large shows can use their time to best advantage if they make\r\nas careful a study as they can of the few things in which they take the\r\nmost interest, and take just a casual look at everything else. In the\r\nfour or five days that it is open to the public it is not possible for\r\nany one to make a thorough, discriminating inspection of all that there\r\nis to be seen at a large poultry show, and an experienced visitor to\r\nsuch shows never tries to do so. At many of the small shows even a\r\nnovice, by studying the exhibits systematically, may get a very good\r\nidea of all the classes and may add something to his accurate knowledge\r\nof a number of different kinds of birds.\r\n\r\n=Rudiments of judging.= While even an ordinary poultry show contains a\r\ngreat deal that is of interest to those who know how to get at it, the\r\nvisitor who does not know how to study the exhibits and simply takes a\r\ncursory look at all of them, tires of the regular classes at a show in a\r\nvery short time. After the awards have been made, the ribbons or cards\r\non the coops will show the winning birds and their relative positions,\r\nbut unless one knows something of the methods and rules of judging and\r\ncompares the birds with some care, he is likely to get the impression\r\nthat making comparisons between show birds requires a keener critical\r\nfaculty than he possesses, and to conclude that it is quite useless for\r\nhim to attempt to discover why the birds have been ranked in the order\r\nin which the judge has placed them.\r\n\r\nJudging live stock is not a matter of simple comparisons of weights and\r\ndimensions. The personal opinions of the judge necessarily affect his\r\ndecisions, and as the opinions of men differ, their judgments will vary.\r\nA judge is often in doubt as to which of two or more birds is (all\r\nthings considered) the better specimen, but he must make his decision on\r\nthe birds as they appear to him at the time, and that decision must\r\nstand for that competition. No one, no matter how well he may know the\r\nrequirements of the standard for a variety and the methods of applying\r\nit, can discover by a study of a class of birds all of the judge's\r\nreasons for his decisions; but any one who will keep in mind and try to\r\napply a few simple, general rules can look over a variety that he has\r\nnever seen before, and of which he may not know the name, and (unless\r\nthe judge has been very erratic in his decisions) can see why most of\r\nthe awards in a small class of varied quality have been made.\r\n\r\nThese rules are:\r\n\r\n1. The character or characters that most conspicuously distinguish a\r\ntype are given most consideration in judging.\r\n\r\n2. Color of plumage is given more consideration than shape, unless some\r\nshape character is unusually striking.\r\n\r\n3. Quality in color of plumage consists in evenness and purity of shade\r\nin solid-colored specimens, and in sound colors and distinctness of the\r\npattern in party-colored specimens.\r\n\r\n4. The shape of extraordinary superficial shape characters, such as\r\ncrests, very large combs, heavy foot-feathering, etc., is usually given\r\nas much consideration as color.\r\n\r\nThe first rule really includes all the others, and although this is not\r\nusually admitted by the exponents of current methods of judging live\r\nstock, in practice it is the fundamental rule in judging. One reason why\r\npeople who have a little knowledge of standards for well-bred poultry,\r\nand of the methods of applying them, are almost always puzzled by the\r\nawards at poultry shows is because they try to analyze them in\r\naccordance with the commonly accepted theory of judging by points, which\r\nassigns definite numerical values to certain characters. This theory\r\nassumes that the judge, taking these values as a basis, computes the\r\nvalues of faults with mathematical accuracy. This is not possible where\r\nthe computation is based upon an opinion.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the application of the rules given, let us apply them to\r\nsome well-known varieties, taking first the Barred Plymouth Rock.\r\n\r\nThe conspicuous distinguishing character of this variety is the barred\r\ncolor pattern; therefore color of plumage has most consideration in\r\njudging it. The pattern is the same all over the bird; therefore every\r\nfeather should be barred. The pattern must be sharply defined; therefore\r\nthe colors must be clean-cut and the bars straight and of nearly equal\r\nwidth on each feather, with the width of bars on feathers of different\r\nsizes proportionate to the width of the feather. These requirements seem\r\nvery simple when stated, but a close examination of ordinary exhibition\r\nBarred Plymouth Rocks will show very few specimens that closely approach\r\nperfection according to the rules.\r\n\r\nNow take the White Wyandotte. The most conspicuous character of any\r\nwhite bird is its whiteness. In judging this variety, therefore,\r\nwhiteness will have more consideration than any other quality. White\r\nWyandottes are distinguished from White Plymouth Rocks by the shape of\r\nthe comb; therefore the shape of the comb will be given more attention\r\nby the judge than if there were other distinguishing features.\r\n\r\nSilver-Laced Wyandottes are conspicuous for their color pattern;\r\ntherefore the most important thing is that this shall be well defined\r\nand uniform, the white centers clean and white and the black edges\r\nintensely black. Uniformity in such markings is very difficult to\r\nproduce. A bird may be well marked in one section and very poorly marked\r\nin another.\r\n\r\nIn Partridge Cochins the most conspicuous character is extreme feather\r\ndevelopment; the next is color of plumage, which differs in male and\r\nfemale. Feather development and the shape which it produces will\r\ntherefore have about equal consideration with color. In color the male\r\nis black on the breast and body, with a red neck and back, the feathers\r\nof the hackle and the saddle having black stripes in the center;\r\ntherefore, in the male, quality in color consists in blackness in the\r\nblack sections, a uniform red in the red sections, and clear and sharp\r\nstriping wherever it appears. The Partridge Cochin female has plumage of\r\nbrown penciled with a darker brown; therefore to the eye of a poultry\r\nfancier the beauty of her color consists in well-defined penciling and a\r\nharmonious contrast in the two shades of color.\r\n\r\nA White-Crested Black Polish fowl is most conspicuous for its large\r\nwhite crest; therefore the crest is the most important feature to be\r\nconsidered in judging this variety. But color is also very important,\r\nfor if the white feathers of the crest are partly mixed with black, or\r\nthe black of the body is dull, the effect is not pleasing.\r\n\r\nThe Fantail Pigeon is most conspicuous for its fan-shaped tail;\r\ntherefore this is the most important thing in judging. The tail must not\r\nonly be large and well shaped, but must be carried in an attractive\r\nmanner. It must not be too large, because then the bird cannot carry it\r\nin a good position. In addition to carrying the tail in a good position,\r\nthe bird must pose so that the whole attitude adds to the attractiveness\r\nof the principal feature.\r\n\r\nSimilarly with the Pouter Pigeon, the globular crop, which is its\r\ndistinctive character, must be large and well formed, and in addition\r\nthe general carriage must be such as to show the pouting trait to the\r\nbest advantage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 234. Almost complete view of a poultry show at\r\nWorcester, Massachusetts]\r\n\r\nThe same rules of color which apply to fowls apply also to pigeons. The\r\ncolor patterns of pigeons are much more numerous, but as a rule the\r\nprincipal required features are at once obvious to any one who keeps in\r\nmind the general rules that have been given.\r\n\r\nAfter the more conspicuous characters, many minor characters are given\r\nparticular consideration. In theoretical statements of methods of\r\njudging, these minor characters are often treated as of equal importance\r\nwith the conspicuous characters, but in ordinary judging practice they\r\nare not often so treated, except in the case of disqualifying faults, to\r\nbe noted presently. The less conspicuous characters, including shape of\r\nbody (in regard to which the average fancier and judge is somewhat\r\ncareless, not discriminating between closely related types), become\r\nimportant in making decisions between specimens which appear to be equal\r\nin the more conspicuous characters. Because of this there is a tendency\r\nto exaggerate some one minor character whenever a high degree of\r\nuniformity in characters that are of primary importance in judging is\r\nreached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 235. Saddle Fantail Pigeon[28]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 236. White Fantail Pigeons [28]]\r\n\r\n[28] Reproduced, by permission, from \"Domesticated Animals and Plants,\"\r\nby E. Davenport.\r\n\r\n=Disqualifications.= The practice of judging the relative merits of\r\nexhibition birds principally by a few striking characters tends to make\r\nbreeders and exhibitors neglect many little things which affect the\r\nappearance of a bird. This is especially the case with exhibitors\r\ncompeting under judges who are partial to some conspicuous character. To\r\nprevent this, and to place the heaviest possible penalty upon serious\r\nfaults that are easily overlooked, certain faults are made\r\ndisqualifications; that is, a bird having any one of these faults is\r\nabsolutely debarred from competition, no matter how good it may be in\r\nother respects.\r\n\r\nThere is general agreement as to the wisdom and justice of disqualifying\r\nfor deformities or for mutilations of the feathers to conceal a fault.\r\nIn regard to disqualifying for trivial faults, fanciers differ in\r\nopinion. Many hold that this has been carried to a ridiculous extreme in\r\nsome cases. Thus, in all clean-legged fowls it is required that the\r\nshanks and toes shall be free from small feathers, stubs, or down. Most\r\nfanciers agree that conspicuous feathers and stubs should disqualify,\r\nbut many consider that to disqualify for a minute bit of down, which can\r\nhardly be seen without the aid of a magnifying glass, is going too far.\r\n\r\nUnless the judge has overlooked a disqualification (and this rarely\r\nhappens), none will be found on a bird that has been awarded a prize. If\r\nin any class there is a bird which is not given a place, though\r\napparently superior to any of the prize winners in the characters most\r\ndistinctive of its variety, that bird usually has some disqualification.\r\nThe list of disqualifications is too long to be given here. It is not\r\nthe same throughout for all varieties. Exhibitors and breeders do not\r\nattempt to keep track of the disqualifications (which are changed\r\noccasionally) for any but the varieties in which they are especially\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\n=Methods of judging.= When exhibitions of domestic birds were first\r\nheld, the awards were usually made by committees of two or three judges.\r\nThe object in doing this was to insure impartiality and to make\r\nconnivance between a judge and an exhibitor more difficult. It was found\r\nthat this plan did not work well. Often the opinions of one man\r\ndominated, or, if the man could not have his way, the committee wrangled\r\nand took too long to make its decisions. So by degrees the committee\r\nplan was abandoned and a single judge made the awards in accordance with\r\nstandards and rules agreed upon by associations of exhibitors and\r\njudges.\r\n\r\nAt first all judging was done by comparison of the specimens of each\r\nclass entered in competition. That is the method still in general use in\r\nEurope and widely used in America. But to many exhibitors comparison\r\njudging seemed unsatisfactory, because by it only the winning birds were\r\nindicated, and exhibitors whose birds did not win usually wanted to\r\nknow how their birds compared with the winners. To meet this demand\r\nscore-card judging was adopted. In this method of judging, the\r\ncharacters to be considered are divided into sections, which are named\r\nin order on a card having corresponding blank spaces in which to mark\r\nnumerical cuts for faults in each section. The score cards used at\r\npoultry shows where judging is done by that method do not indicate to\r\nwhich of several possible faults a cut applies, except that, having one\r\ncolumn for shape cuts and another for color cuts, they show in which\r\nclass the fault appears. In many educational and private score cards the\r\nnames of the common faults in each section are printed in the space\r\nallotted that section, in order that the fault may be accurately\r\nchecked. The use of cards with so much detail is not practical in\r\nordinary competition.\r\n\r\nThe score of a bird judged by the score-card method is the difference\r\nbetween 100 (taken as the symbol of the perfect bird of any variety) and\r\nthe sum of all the cuts made for faults. The common cuts for faults are\r\n1/2 for a slight fault, 1 for a pronounced fault, and 11/2 for a very bad\r\nfault. Occasionally larger cuts are made for serious faults.\r\nTheoretically the score is supposed to represent accurately the relation\r\nof a specimen to a perfect specimen, but really scores only represent in\r\na general way the judges' opinions of the relative values of the birds\r\nin a class, and indicate to the exhibitor where the judge found faults\r\nin his bird.\r\n\r\n=Exhibition quality and value.= The winning of a prize at an important\r\nshow gives a breeder of fancy birds a standing that he could not\r\notherwise acquire. The greater part of the sales of poultry of this\r\nclass are made by mail to persons who do not know the breeder personally\r\nand do not see his stock until after purchasing. No matter how good his\r\nstock may be, those who want to buy will not pay much attention to his\r\nclaims for its superior quality until they have such confirmation of\r\nthose claims as is given by the winning of prizes in competition. Then\r\nthe prices which a breeder can get for his stock will be regulated\r\nlargely by the prices obtained by other successful exhibitors at shows\r\nof the same class.\r\n\r\nThere is a wide range of prices from those that can be secured for stock\r\nof the quality that wins at the greatest shows, to those that can be\r\nobtained for the kind that wins at ordinary small shows. High prices are\r\npaid for noted winners and for other stock of the same breeding, as much\r\nfor the advertising value of ownership of fine stock as for the actual\r\nvalue of the birds to breed from or to exhibit again. A breeder who wins\r\nat some very small show may find it hard to sell either stock or eggs\r\nfor hatching except at a slight advance over market prices. Some\r\nbreeders who have made remarkable records in winning at the best shows\r\ncan get very high prices for their prize-winning stock and for the eggs\r\nfrom it. Fowls sometimes sell as high as $500 each, and eggs at $2 each.\r\nPigeons also bring very high prices at times, although fewer people are\r\ninterested in them and sales are not so numerous. The ordinary prices\r\nfor good stock are quite reasonable, considering how few really fine\r\nspecimens are produced. The average novice finds that fowls at from $10\r\nto $25 a trio and pigeons at from $5 to $15 a pair have all the quality\r\nthat he can appreciate.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of modern fancy poultry culture those breeders who had\r\ngreat reputations could get relatively high prices for almost any bird\r\nthat would pass as a breeding specimen of its kind. This is still true\r\nof breeders who successfully introduce new varieties or who suddenly\r\nattain prominence with stock of their own breeding. But as the stock of\r\na leading breeder becomes widely distributed among smaller breeders, the\r\ncompetition of his customers reduces his sales, and especially the sales\r\nof the cheaper grades of stock. The most troublesome problem that the\r\nbest breeders have is to get rid of the lower grades of their stock at a\r\nfair profit.\r\n\r\n=Why good breeders have much low-priced stock.= Novices in the breeding\r\nof fine stock commonly suppose that all pure-bred stock of any variety\r\nis of uniform quality. When they learn that, as a rule, only a small\r\npart of the young birds hatched from good stock is considered of\r\nsuperior quality, they often conclude that the ideas and the standards\r\nof fanciers must be wrong. Even professional and scientific men who\r\nbecome interested in fancy poultry and pigeons often take this view and,\r\nafter considering the question carefully from their standpoint, try to\r\nexplain to fanciers how, by changing a standard, they might secure a\r\nmuch larger proportion of specimens approximately perfect according to\r\nthe standard used. In the case of varieties in which the finest\r\nspecimens of the different sexes are secured from different matings,\r\nmany novices waste a great deal of time trying to convince old fanciers\r\nthat their standards and methods are illogical and unnatural.\r\n\r\nTo those who do not understand the philosophy of the interest in\r\nbreeding to highly specialized types the arguments for standards that\r\nare adjusted to common results and are easy to attain appear to be\r\nunanswerable. Upon the fancier who does understand this philosophy they\r\nmake no impression at all. The breeding and exhibiting of fancy stock of\r\nany kind is primarily a game. The rules of the game are in a measure\r\narbitrary, like the rules in baseball or football or any other game. At\r\nthe same time they must be framed in the interests of the development of\r\nthe game as a sport and also as a spectacle. They must be reasonable and\r\nmust be suited to players of all degrees of skill.\r\n\r\nStandards and rules for judging fancy stock develop just as the rules of\r\nathletic games develop. A generation ago such games as baseball and\r\nfootball were comparatively simple games in which boys and men might\r\ntake very creditable parts without devoting a great deal of attention to\r\npractice. These games still afford recreation to many who use them for\r\nthat purpose only, but they have also been developed so that players of\r\nexceptional skill play competition games for the interest of a public\r\nwhich studies the fine points of these games and compares the abilities\r\nof the players. People who take an interest in and patronize\r\nprofessional or high-class amateur ball games do so because in them\r\nskillful and well-trained players do difficult things. It is the same in\r\nthe breeding of fancy live stock to a high standard of excellence. When\r\na breed or a variety is first made, the interest of the breeders centers\r\nin a few characters, precisely as the interest of a novice in any line\r\ncenters in a few prominent features. As breeders grow in experience and\r\nin skill, and as the characters to which they first give special\r\nattention become fixed, they demand better quality in these and also\r\nturn their attention to the development of other characters. The more\r\ndifficult a combination of characters is to produce, the greater\r\ninterest the fancier takes in trying to produce it. When a standard\r\ncalls for a high degree of excellence in many characters, the proportion\r\nof specimens of high excellence, as measured by that standard, will\r\nalmost always be small. It is because this is the case that the rare\r\nspecimens are considered so valuable.\r\n\r\n=Fancy and utility types in the same variety.= The great majority of\r\nAmerican breeders of fancy poultry seek to secure a high degree of\r\npractical value in combination with fancy quality in their stock. There\r\nare some fanciers who breed only for fancy points, and some market\r\npoultry growers who pay no attention at all to them, but as a rule those\r\nwho give market poultry special attention want well-bred stock of good\r\nordinary quality, and those who keep poultry for pleasure want the flock\r\nkept for this purpose to supply at least their own tables with eggs and\r\nmeat. The breeder who wishes to combine fancy and utility properties in\r\nany kind of live stock must breed only from specimens that are\r\nmeritorious in both directions, selecting much more carefully than when\r\nbreeding for one class of properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS RELATED TO AVICULTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe value of a knowledge of domestic birds is not limited to the use\r\nwhich may be made of it in keeping them for profit or for pleasure. Any\r\noccupation in which a great many people are interested affords\r\nopportunities to combine the knowledge relating to it with special\r\nknowledge or skill in other lines, to the advantage of those who are\r\nable to do so. Just as the large market or fancy poultry business may\r\ndevelop from a small flock kept to supply the owner's table or to give\r\nhim a little recreation, many special occupations grow out of particular\r\ninterests of aviculturists. Some of these have been mentioned\r\nincidentally in preceding chapters. In this chapter the principal\r\noccupations associated with aviculture will be discussed both in their\r\nrelation to that subject and with respect to their possible interest for\r\nthose who plan to devote themselves to lines of work which would qualify\r\nthem for special service in aviculture.\r\n\r\n=Judging fancy poultry and pigeons.= There is the same difference\r\nbetween selecting one's own birds according to quality and judging the\r\nbirds of others in competition that there is between performing well in\r\na friendly game and performing well in a competition where the stakes\r\nare important and feeling runs high. Many fanciers who are good breeders\r\nand also good judges under other conditions make poor judges in\r\ncompetitions. In judging at shows decisions must be made quickly, there\r\nis little opportunity to rectify mistakes, and if a judge makes serious\r\nblunders he is severely criticized. A person who deliberates a long time\r\nbefore coming to a decision, and who is very sensitive to criticisms of\r\nhis errors, even though he knows that some errors are sure to be made\r\nby every one and that unprejudiced exhibitors make allowance for this,\r\nwill not make a successful judge of poultry and pigeons. Judges as a\r\nclass are not the men who know the most about standard-bred birds or who\r\nare the most skillful in breeding them, although some of the best\r\nbreeders are among the best judges. Almost all fanciers get\r\nopportunities to act as judges. If their work is satisfactory, the\r\ndemand for their services increases until in time their income from this\r\nsource may be large enough to make it worth while to adjust their other\r\naffairs to their engagements at poultry shows.\r\n\r\n=Journalism.= There were a few books on poultry and pigeons written in\r\nthe first half of the last century, and a larger number immediately\r\nfollowing the \"hen-fever\" period. These and the articles on poultry and\r\npigeons in agricultural papers constituted the literature of the subject\r\nuntil about 1870. Then there appeared a number of poultry journals, most\r\nof which gave some attention to other domestic birds. The demand for\r\nspecial journals arose because many people who were interested in\r\npoultry were living in cities and were not interested in general\r\nagriculture; they wanted more information about poultry matters than the\r\nagricultural papers could give. Advertisers of poultry and pigeons, and\r\nof goods bought by aviculturists, also wished advertising mediums\r\nthrough which they could reach buyers at less cost than they could\r\nthrough the agricultural papers. The rates for advertising are based\r\nupon circulation, and if only a small class of the readers of a\r\npublication are buyers of a particular class of goods advertised in it,\r\nthe cost of reaching them may be too great. Whenever any interest\r\nbecomes of sufficient importance, journals especially devoted to it are\r\nissued, for the convenience of buyers and sellers as well as for the\r\ninformation they contain. Until about 1890 nearly all poultry journals\r\nwere small publications which the owners looked after in their spare\r\ntime. Then they began to increase in number and importance, and before\r\nlong there were a great many that gave regular employment to editors,\r\nadvertising solicitors, and subscription solicitors, who were employed\r\nfor their knowledge of poultry and their acquaintance with poultrymen as\r\nwell as for special qualifications for their respective departments.\r\n\r\n=Art.= The illustrating of poultry journals and books, and of the\r\ncatalogues of fanciers and other advertisers in poultry literature,\r\ngives employment to a constantly increasing number of artists. In order\r\nto successfully portray birds for critical fanciers, an artist must be\r\nsomething of a fancier. It is not enough that he should draw or paint\r\nthem as he sees them; he must know how to pose birds of different kinds,\r\ntypes, and breeds so that his pictures will show the proper\r\ncharacteristic poses and show the most important characters to their\r\nbest advantage. Since the half-tone process of making illustrations was\r\nperfected, the greatest demand is for photographic work, but unless an\r\nartist is able to work over and complete a defective photograph with\r\nbrush or pencil, he cannot make this line of work profitable. Most birds\r\nare difficult subjects to photograph, and only a small proportion of the\r\nphotographs that are taken can be used without retouching. A\r\nphotographer may work for an hour to get a bird posed to suit him, and\r\nthen, just as he presses the bulb, the bird, by a slight movement of the\r\nhead or foot, may spoil one feature in a photograph that is otherwise\r\nall that could be desired. An artist who can draw birds can remedy such\r\ndefects; the ordinary commercial artist cannot.\r\n\r\n=Invention.= The most important invention used in aviculture is the\r\nartificial incubator. Methods of hatching eggs by artificial heat were\r\ndeveloped independently by the Egyptians and by the Chinese thousands of\r\nyears ago, and are still used in Egypt and China. The arrangements used\r\nin these old hatcheries are crude, and the success of the operation\r\ndepends upon exceptional skill and judgment on the part of the operator.\r\nOperating incubators is a business continued in the same families for\r\ncenturies. Each hatchery does the hatching for a community.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the eighteenth century a French scientist named\r\nReaumur, who was much interested in poultry, began to make experiments\r\nin artificial hatching and brooding. In 1750 he published a very full\r\naccount of these and other experiments which he had made with poultry.\r\nHis idea was to devise a modification of the Egyptian practice of\r\nhatching in ovens, suited to the conditions of a more advanced\r\ncivilization. He succeeded in hatching eggs by utilizing the waste heat\r\nfrom a baker's oven, and also hatched eggs in hotbeds heated with\r\ndecomposing manure. He applied the hotbed principle to the brooding of\r\nchickens with some success. But the methods that he devised were not\r\nadapted to general use.\r\n\r\nAfter Reaumur many others experimented with artificial hatching. Some of\r\nthe ideas were obviously more impractical than those of Reaumur, but the\r\nexperimenters tried them out and sometimes succeeded in hatching\r\nchickens by very peculiar and laborious processes. One man in England,\r\nin the latter part of the eighteenth century, hatched some chickens from\r\neggs placed in cotton batting in a sieve adjusted over a charcoal fire\r\nin a small fireplace. The fire was watched constantly for three weeks,\r\neither by himself or by some member of his family. He demonstrated that\r\neggs could be hatched in this way, but not that it could be done\r\nprofitably. Practical incubators were not produced until about forty\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nAlthough incubators and brooders have been brought to a relatively high\r\nstate of efficiency, they are far from perfect. Inventors of the best\r\nmachines are still studying ways to improve them. In this and many other\r\nfields there are opportunities for inventive genius.\r\n\r\n=Education and investigation.= Lectures on poultry have been given\r\noccasionally at agricultural institutes in the United States since about\r\n1860. After 1890 the demand for such lectures, and the number given,\r\nconstantly increased, and ability to speak in public became valuable to\r\none versed in aviculture. Then the study of poultry culture was\r\nintroduced into agricultural colleges, and a new field was opened to\r\npoultry keepers with a faculty for teaching, and for trained teachers\r\nwith special knowledge of domestic birds. The teaching of poultry\r\nculture impressed upon those engaged in it the need of scientific\r\ninvestigation of many problems not clearly understood even by the\r\nbest-informed poultrymen.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural experiment stations had been giving little attention to\r\nsome of these problems except in a desultory way and without important\r\nresults. As the demands for more accurate information on many topics\r\nincreased, many of the experiment stations began to make important\r\npoultry investigations. For this work men specially trained in various\r\nsciences were required. As a rule the men that were secured for such\r\nwork knew very little about poultry when they began their\r\ninvestigations, but it was much easier for them to acquire a knowledge\r\nof poultry sufficient for their needs than for persons who had poultry\r\nknowledge and no scientific training to qualify for positions as\r\ninvestigators. The field of investigation of matters relating to poultry\r\nis constantly being extended. Proficiency in physics, chemistry,\r\nbiology, surgery, and medicine, and in higher mathematics as far as it\r\nrelates to the problems of any of the sciences mentioned, will always be\r\nin demand for scientific work in aviculture. In the future the most\r\nefficient teachers and investigators will be those whose early\r\nfamiliarity with domestic birds has given a greater insight into the\r\nsubject than is usually possessed by those who take up the study of the\r\nsubject comparatively late in life.\r\n\r\n=Manufacturing and commerce.= It is very much easier to build up a large\r\nbusiness in the manufacture or the sale of articles used by poultry and\r\npigeon keepers than to build up a large business as a breeder of\r\ndomestic birds of any kind. As has been stated in connection with nearly\r\nevery kind of bird mentioned in this book, a poultry keeper's operations\r\nare limited by the difficulty of keeping large numbers of birds\r\ncontinuously on the same land, and also by the exacting nature of the\r\nwork of caring for them under such conditions. In manufacturing and\r\ncommercial operations there are no such limitations. The possibilities\r\nof development depend upon the extent of the demand for the articles\r\nthat are manufactured or sold, and only a small proportion of the\r\nemployees need to be persons versed in aviculture. But in competition\r\nwith other manufacturers or merchants those who understand domestic\r\nbirds and know all the different phases of interest in them have a very\r\ngreat advantage over those who do not.\r\n\r\n=Legislation and litigation.= The rise of new industries creates new\r\nproblems for legislators, executive departments, courts, and lawyers. An\r\nindustry in which many people are interested eventually reaches a stage\r\nwhere it is profitable for lawyers to specialize to some extent in laws\r\naffecting it, and politic for legislators and administrators to do what\r\nis in their power to protect the interests of those engaged in it, and\r\nto advance those interests for the benefit of the whole community. A\r\nspecial field is opening for lawyers familiar with aviculture and with\r\nits relations to other matters, just as within a few years the field has\r\nopened to teachers and investigators.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe possible uses of a knowledge of aviculture to young people who are\r\nnaturally inclined toward intellectual professions, art, invention,\r\nmanufacturing, or trading have not been given for the sake of urging\r\nstudents to direct their course especially toward work connected with\r\naviculture. The object is only to show those who take an interest in the\r\nsubject that it is worth while to cultivate that interest for other\r\nreasons, as well as for the profit or the pleasure that may be\r\nimmediately derived from it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abbotsbury, old swannery at, 229\r\n\r\n  Africa, guinea fowl in, 202;\r\n    ostrich breeding in, 235\r\n\r\n  African goose, 164;\r\n    illustrated, 164\r\n\r\n  Age, of earth, 25;\r\n    of fowls, 92;\r\n    of geese, 169;\r\n    of swans, 223;\r\n    of ostriches, 232\r\n\r\n  Agricultural experiment stations, interest of, in aviculture, 308\r\n\r\n  Agricultural fairs, poultry exhibitions at, 292\r\n\r\n  Aigret of peafowl, 208\r\n\r\n  Albumen, formation of, in egg, 17\r\n\r\n  Alfalfa, 140, 236\r\n\r\n  American Wild Goose, 165;\r\n    illustrated, 166\r\n\r\n  American Wild Pigeon, 241\r\n\r\n  Amherst Pheasant, illustrated, 214\r\n\r\n  Ancona, 64\r\n\r\n  Andalusian, Blue, 49, 64\r\n\r\n  Animal kingdom, place of birds in, 2\r\n\r\n  Animals, having bird characters, 1;\r\n    predacious, prevent use of colony system, 107\r\n\r\n  Annual production of poultry and eggs in United States, 290\r\n\r\n  Antwerp Homer Pigeon, 246\r\n\r\n  Art, relation of, to poultry culture, 306\r\n\r\n  Aseel, 50\r\n\r\n  Ashes, use of, in poultry house, 75\r\n\r\n  Asia, peafowl in, 208;\r\n    pheasants in, 212\r\n\r\n  Asiatic races of fowls, 49\r\n\r\n  Australia, Black Swan discovered in, 223\r\n\r\n  Austria, goose growing in, 167\r\n\r\n  Aylesbury Duck, 129;\r\n    as a market duck in America, 147\r\n\r\n\r\n  Babylonians, knowledge of fowls among, 36\r\n\r\n  Bache, importation of pheasants by, 212\r\n\r\n  Bakubas, ducks among the, 127\r\n\r\n  Bantams, 66;\r\n    illustrated, 37, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70\r\n\r\n  Barbs of feather, 9\r\n\r\n  Barnum, P.
