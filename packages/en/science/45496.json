I have\r\naccordingly added a considerable number of such examples, in most cases\r\naccompanied by figures drawn from the specimens described. I have not\r\nbeen at liberty to alter or expunge, and am not, therefore, responsible\r\nfor any portion of the letterpress except those passages which are\r\nenclosed in brackets [ ]. Some of the specimens from which the figures\r\nhave been drawn are in my own collection, but the greater part are to\r\nbe found in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n

The most\r\nprofound investigations of Philosophy are necessarily connected\r\nwith the ordinary circumstances of our being, and of the world in\r\nwhich our every-day life is spent. With regard to our own existence,\r\nthe pulsation of the heart, the act of respiration, the voluntary\r\nmovement of our limbs, the condition of sleep, are among the most\r\nordinary operations of our nature; and yet how long were the wisest\r\nof men struggling with dark and bewildering speculations before they\r\ncould offer anything like a satisfactory solution of these phenomena,\r\nand how far are we still from an accurate and complete knowledge of\r\nthem! The science of Meteorology, which attempts to explain to us the\r\nphilosophy of matters constantly before our eyes, as dew, mist, and\r\nrain, is dependent for its illustrations upon a knowledge of the most\r\ncomplicated facts, such as the influence of heat and electricity upon\r\nthe air; and this knowledge is at present so imperfect, that even these\r\ncommon occurrences of the weather, which men have been observing and\r\nreasoning upon for ages, are by no means satisfactorily explained, or\r\nreduced to the precision that every science should aspire to. Yet,\r\nhowever difficult it may be entirely to comprehend the phenomena we\r\ndaily witness, everything in nature is full of instruction. Thus the\r\nhumblest flower of the field, although, to one whose curiosity has\r\nnot been excited, and whose understanding has, therefore, remained\r\nuninformed, it may appear worthless and contemptible, is valuable to\r\nthe botanist, not only with regard to its place in the arrangement of\r\nthis portion of the Creator's works, but as it leads his mind forward\r\nto the consideration of those beautiful provisions for the support of\r\nvegetable life, which it is the part of the physiologist to study and\r\nto admire.\r\n\r\nThis train of reasoning is peculiarly applicable to the economy of\r\ninsects. They constitute a very large and interesting part of the\r\nanimal kingdom. They are everywhere about us. The spider weaves his\r\ncurious web in our houses; the caterpillar constructs his silken cell\r\nin our gardens; the wasp that hovers over our food has a nest not\r\nfar removed from us, which she has assisted to build with the nicest\r\nart; the beetle that crawls across our path is also an ingenious and\r\nlaborious mechanic, and has some curious instincts to exhibit to those\r\nwho will feel an interest in watching his movements; and the moth that\r\neats into our clothes has something to plead for our pity, for he came,\r\nlike us, naked into the world, and he has destroyed our garments,\r\nnot in malice or wantonness, but that he may clothe himself with the\r\nsame wool which we have stripped from the sheep. An observation of\r\nthe habits of these little creatures is full of valuable lessons,\r\nwhich the abundance of the examples has no tendency to diminish. The\r\nmore such observations are multiplied, the more are we led forward\r\nto the freshest and the most delightful parts of knowledge; the more\r\ndo we learn to estimate rightly the extraordinary provisions and\r\nmost abundant resources of a creative Providence; and the better do\r\nwe appreciate our own relations with all the infinite varieties of\r\nnature, and our dependence, in common with the ephemeron that flutters\r\nits little hour in the summer sun, upon that Being in whose scheme\r\nof existence the humblest as well as the highest creature has its\r\ndestined purposes. \"If you speak of a stone,\" says St. Basil, one of\r\nthe Fathers of the Church, \"if you speak of a fly, a gnat, or a bee,\r\nyour conversation will be a sort of demonstration of His power whose\r\nhand formed them, for the wisdom of the workman is commonly perceived\r\nin that which is of little size. He who has stretched out the heavens,\r\nand dug up the bottom of the sea, is also He who has pierced a passage\r\nthrough the sting of the bee for the ejection of its poison.\"\r\n\r\nIf it be granted that making discoveries is one of the most\r\nsatisfactory of human pleasures, then we may without hesitation\r\naffirm, that the study of insects is one of the most delightful\r\nbranches of natural history, for it affords peculiar facilities for\r\nits pursuit. These facilities are found in the almost inexhaustible\r\nvariety which insects present to the curious observer. As a proof\r\nof the extraordinary number of insects within a limited field of\r\nobservation, Mr. Stephens informs us, that in the short space of forty\r\ndays, between the middle of June and the beginning of August, he\r\nfound, in the vicinity of Ripley, specimens of above two thousand four\r\nhundred species of insects, exclusive of caterpillars and grubs,--a\r\nnumber amounting to nearly a fourth of the insects ascertained to be\r\nindigenous. He further tells us, that, among these specimens, although\r\nthe ground had, in former seasons, been frequently explored, there\r\nwere about one hundred species altogether new, and not before in any\r\ncollection which he had inspected, including several new genera;\r\nwhile many insects reputed scarce were in considerable plenty.[A] The\r\nlocalities of insects are, to a certain extent, constantly changing;\r\nand thus the study of them has, in this circumstance, as well as in\r\ntheir manifold abundance, a source of perpetual variety. Insects, also,\r\nwhich are plentiful one year, frequently become scarce, or disappear\r\naltogether, the next--a fact strikingly illustrated by the uncommon\r\nabundance, in 1826 and 1827, of the seven-spot lady-bird (_Coccinella\r\nseptempunctata_), in the vicinity of London, though during the two\r\nsucceeding summers this insect was comparatively scarce, while the\r\nsmall two-spot lady-bird (_Coccinella bipunctata_) was plentiful.\r\n\r\nThere is, perhaps, no situation in which the lover of nature and the\r\nobserver of animal life may not find opportunities for increasing his\r\nstore of facts. It is told of a state prisoner, under a cruel and\r\nrigorous despotism, that when he was excluded from all commerce with\r\nmankind, and was shut out from books, he took an interest and found\r\nconsolation in the visits of a spider; and there is no improbability\r\nin the story. The operations of that persecuted creature are among the\r\nmost extraordinary exhibitions of mechanical ingenuity; and a daily\r\nwatching of the workings of its instinct would beget admiration in\r\na rightly-constituted mind. The poor prisoner had abundant leisure\r\nfor the speculations in which the spider's web would enchain his\r\nunderstanding. We have all of us, at one period or other of our lives,\r\nbeen struck with some singular evidence of contrivance in the economy\r\nof insects, which we have seen with our own eyes. Want of leisure, and\r\nprobably want of knowledge, have prevented us from following up the\r\ncuriosity which for a moment was excited. And yet some such accident\r\nhas made men naturalists, in the highest meaning of the term. Bonnet,\r\nevidently speaking of himself, says, \"I knew a naturalist, who, when\r\nhe was seventeen years of age, having heard of the operations of the\r\nant-lion, began by doubting them. He had no rest till he had examined\r\ninto them: and he verified them, he admired them, he discovered new\r\nfacts, and soon became the disciple and the friend of the Pliny of\r\nFrance\"[B] (Réaumur). It is not the happy fortune of many to be able to\r\ndevote themselves exclusively to the study of nature, unquestionably\r\nthe most fascinating of human employments; but almost every one may\r\nacquire sufficient knowledge to be able to derive a high gratification\r\nfrom beholding the more common operations of animal life. His materials\r\nfor contemplation are always before him. Some weeks ago we made an\r\nexcursion to West Wood, near Shooter's Hill, expressly for the purpose\r\nof observing the insects we might meet with in the wood: but we had\r\nnot got far among the bushes, when heavy rain came on. We immediately\r\nsought shelter among the boughs of some thick underwood, composed of\r\noak, birch, and aspen; but we could not meet with a single insect, not\r\neven a gnat or a fly, sheltered under the leaves. Upon looking more\r\nnarrowly, however, into the bushes which protected us, we soon found\r\na variety of interesting objects of study. The oak abounded in galls,\r\nseveral of them quite new to us; while the leaves of the birch and\r\nthe aspen exhibited the curious serpentine paths of the minute mining\r\ncaterpillars. When we had exhausted the narrow field of observation\r\nimmediately around us, we found that we could considerably extend it,\r\nby breaking a few of the taller branches near us, and then examining\r\ntheir leaves at leisure. In this manner two hours glided quickly and\r\npleasantly away, by which time the rain had nearly ceased; and though\r\nwe had been disappointed in our wish to ramble through the wood, we\r\ndid not return without adding a few interesting facts to our previous\r\nknowledge of insect economy.[C]\r\n\r\nIt will appear, then, from the preceding observations, that cabinets\r\nand collections, though undoubtedly of the highest use, are by no\r\nmeans indispensable, as the observer of nature may find inexhaustible\r\nsubjects of study in every garden and in every hedge. Nature has\r\nbeen profuse enough in affording us materials for observation, when\r\nwe are prepared to look about us with that keenness of inquiry,\r\nwhich curiosity, the first step in the pursuit of knowledge, will\r\nunquestionably give. Nor shall we be disappointed in the gratification\r\nwhich is thus within our reach. Were it no more, indeed, than a\r\nsource of agreeable amusement, the study of insects comes strongly\r\nrecommended to the notice of the well-educated. The pleasures of\r\nchildhood are generally supposed to be more exquisite, and to contain\r\nless alloy, than those of riper years; and if so, it must be because\r\nthen everything appears new and dressed in fresh beauties: while in\r\nmanhood, and old age, whatever has frequently recurred begins to wear\r\nthe tarnish of decay. The study of nature affords us a succession of\r\n\"ever-new delights,\" such as charmed us in childhood, when everything\r\nhad the attractions of novelty and beauty; and thus the mind of the\r\nnaturalist may have its own fresh and vigorous thoughts, even while the\r\ninfirmities of age weigh down the body.\r\n\r\nIt has been objected to the study of insects, as well as to that of\r\nNatural History in general, that it tends to withdraw the mind from\r\nsubjects of higher moment; that it cramps and narrows the range of\r\nthought; and that it destroys, or at least weakens, the finer creations\r\nof the fancy. Now, we should allow this objection in its fullest\r\nextent, and even be disposed to carry it further than is usually done,\r\nif the collecting of specimens only, or, as the French expressly\r\ncall them, chips (_échantillons_), be called a study. But the mere\r\ncollector is not, and cannot be, justly considered as a naturalist;\r\nand, taking the term naturalist in its enlarged sense, we can adduce\r\nsome distinguished instances in opposition to the objection. Rousseau,\r\nfor example, was passionately fond of the Linnæan botany, even to the\r\ndriest minutiæ of its technicalities; and yet it does not appear to\r\nhave cramped his mind, or impoverished his imagination. If Rousseau,\r\nhowever, be objected to as an eccentric being, from whose pursuits no\r\nfair inference can be drawn, we give the illustrious example of Charles\r\nJames Fox, and may add the names of our distinguished poets, Goldsmith,\r\nThomson, Gray, and Darwin, who were all enthusiastic naturalists. We\r\nwish particularly to insist upon the example of Gray, because he was\r\nvery partial to the study of insects. It may be new to many of our\r\nreaders, who are familiar with the 'Elegy in a Country Churchyard,' to\r\nbe told that its author was at the pains to turn the characteristics\r\nof the Linnæan orders of insects into Latin hexameters, the manuscript\r\nof which is still preserved in his interleaved copy of the 'Systema\r\nNaturæ.' Further, to use the somewhat exaggerated words of Kirby and\r\nSpence, whose work on Entomology is one of the most instructive and\r\npleasing books on the science, 'Aristotle among the Greeks, and Pliny\r\nthe Elder among the Romans, may be denominated the fathers of Natural\r\nHistory, as well as the greatest philosophers of their day; yet both\r\nthese made insects a principal object of their attention: and in more\r\nrecent times, if we look abroad, what names greater than those of Redi,\r\nMalpighi, Vallisnieri, Swammerdam, Leeuwenhoek, Réaumur, Linnæus, De\r\nGeer, Bonnet, and the Hubers? and at home, what philosophers have done\r\nmore honour to their country and to human nature than Ray, Willughby,\r\nLister, and Derham? Yet all these made the study of insects one of\r\ntheir most favourite pursuits.\"[D]\r\n\r\nAnd yet this study has been considered, by those who have superficially\r\nexamined the subject, as belonging to a small order of minds; and the\r\nsatire of Pope has been indiscriminately applied to all collectors,\r\nwhile, in truth, it only touches those who mistake the means of\r\nknowledge for the end:--\r\n\r\n    \"O! would the sons of men once think their eyes\r\n    And reason given them but to study Flies!\r\n    See Nature, in some partial, narrow shape,\r\n    And let the Author of the whole escape;\r\n    Learn but to trifle; or, who most observe,\r\n    To wonder at their Maker, not to serve.\"[E]\r\n\r\nThus exclaims the Goddess of Dulness, sweeping into her net all those\r\nwho study nature in detail. But if the matter were rightly appreciated,\r\nit would be evident that no part of the works of the Creator can be\r\nwithout the deepest interest to an inquiring mind; and that a portion\r\nof creation which exhibits such extraordinary manifestations of design\r\nas is shown by insects must have attractions for the very highest\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nAn accurate knowledge of the properties of insects is of great\r\nimportance to man, merely with relation to his own comfort and\r\nsecurity. The injuries which they inflict upon us are extensive and\r\ncomplicated; and the remedies which we attempt, by the destruction of\r\nthose creatures, both insects, birds, and quadrupeds, who keep the\r\nravages in check, are generally aggravations of the evil, because they\r\nare directed by an ignorance of the economy of nature. The little\r\nknowledge which we have of the modes by which insects may be impeded\r\nin their destruction of much that is valuable to us, has probably\r\nproceeded from our contempt of their individual insignificance. The\r\nsecurity of property has ceased to be endangered by quadrupeds of\r\nprey, and yet our gardens are ravaged by aphides and caterpillars. It\r\nis somewhat startling to affirm that the condition of the human race\r\nis seriously injured by these petty annoyances; but it is perfectly\r\ntrue that the art and industry of man have not yet been able to\r\novercome the collective force, the individual perseverance, and the\r\ncomplicated machinery of destruction which insects employ. A small ant,\r\naccording to a most careful and philosophical observer, opposes almost\r\ninvincible obstacles to the progress of civilization in many parts\r\nof the equinoctial zone. These animals devour paper and parchment;\r\nthey destroy every book and manuscript. Many provinces of Spanish\r\nAmerica cannot, in consequence, show a written document of a hundred\r\nyears' existence. \"What development,\" he adds, \"can the civilization\r\nof a people assume, if there be nothing to connect the present with\r\nthe past--if the depositories of human knowledge must be constantly\r\nrenewed--if the monuments of genius and wisdom cannot be transmitted\r\nto posterity?\"[F] Again, there are beetles which deposit their larvæ\r\nin trees in such formidable numbers that whole forests perish beyond\r\nthe power of remedy. The pines of the Hartz have thus been destroyed\r\nto an enormous extent; and in North America, at one place in South\r\nCarolina, at least ninety trees in every hundred, upon a tract of two\r\nthousand acres, were swept away by a small black, winged bug. And\r\nyet, according to Wilson, the historian of American birds, the people\r\nof the United States were in the habit of destroying the redheaded\r\nwoodpecker, the great enemy of these insects, because he occasionally\r\nspoilt an apple.[G] The same delightful writer and true naturalist,\r\nspeaking of the labours of the ivory-billed woodpecker, says, \"Would\r\nit be believed that the larvæ of an insect or fly, no larger than\r\na grain of rice, should silently, and in one season, destroy some\r\nthousand acres of pine-trees, many of them from two to three feet in\r\ndiameter, and a hundred and fifty feet high? In some places the whole\r\nwoods, as far as you can see around you, are dead, stripped of the\r\nbark, their wintry-looking arms and bare trunks bleaching in the sun,\r\nand tumbling in ruins before every blast.\"[H] The subterraneous larva\r\nof some species of beetle has often caused a complete failure of the\r\nseed-corn, as in the district of Halle in 1812.[I] The corn-weevil,\r\nwhich extracts the flour from grain, leaving the husk behind, will\r\ndestroy the contents of the largest storehouses in a very short period.\r\nThe wire-worm and the turnip-fly are dreaded by every farmer. The\r\nravages of the locust are too well known not to be at once recollected\r\nas an example of the formidable collective power of the insect race.\r\nThe white ants of tropical countries sweep away whole villages with\r\nas much certainty as a fire or an inundation; and ships even have\r\nbeen destroyed by these indefatigable republics. Our own docks and\r\nembankments have been threatened by such minute ravagers.\r\n\r\nThe enormous injuries which insects cause to man may thus be held\r\nas one reason for ceasing to consider the study of them as an\r\ninsignificant pursuit; for a knowledge of their structure, their food,\r\ntheir enemies, and their general habits, may lead, as it often has\r\nled, to the means of guarding against their injuries. At the same\r\ntime we derive from them both direct and indirect benefits. The honey\r\nof the bee, the dye of the cochineal, and the web of the silk-worm,\r\nthe advantages of which are obvious, may well be balanced against\r\nthe destructive propensities of insects which are offensive to man.\r\nBut a philosophical study of natural history will teach us that the\r\ndirect benefits which insects confer upon us are even less important\r\nthan their general uses in maintaining the economy of the world. The\r\nmischiefs which result to us from the rapid increase and the activity\r\nof insects are merely results of the very principle by which they\r\nconfer upon us numberless indirect advantages. Forests are swept\r\naway by minute beetles; but the same agencies relieve us from that\r\nextreme abundance of vegetable matter which would render the earth\r\nuninhabitable were this excess not periodically destroyed. In hot\r\ncountries the great business of removing corrupt animal matter, which\r\nthe vulture and hyæna imperfectly perform, is effected with certainty\r\nand speed by the myriads of insects that spring from the eggs deposited\r\nin every carcase by some fly seeking therein the means of life for\r\nher progeny. Destruction and reproduction, the great laws of nature,\r\nare carried on very greatly through the instrumentality of insects;\r\nand the same principle regulates even the increase of particular\r\nspecies of insects themselves. When aphides are so abundant that we\r\nknow not how to escape their ravages, flocks of lady-birds instantly\r\ncover our fields and gardens to destroy them. Such considerations as\r\nthese are thrown out to show that the subject of insects has a great\r\nphilosophical importance--and what portion of the works of nature has\r\nnot? The habits of all God's creatures, whether they are noxious, or\r\nharmless, or beneficial, are worthy objects of our study. If they\r\naffect ourselves, in our health or our possessions, whether for good\r\nor for evil, an additional impulse is naturally given to our desire\r\nto attain a knowledge of their properties. Such studies form one of\r\nthe most interesting occupations which can engage a rational and\r\ninquisitive mind; and, perhaps, none of the employments of human life\r\nare more dignified than the investigation and survey of the workings\r\nand the ways of nature in the minutest of her productions.\r\n\r\nThe exercise of that habit of observation which can alone make a\r\nnaturalist--\"an out-of-door naturalist,\" as Daines Barrington calls\r\nhimself--is well calculated to strengthen even the most practical and\r\nmerely useful powers of the mind. One of the most valuable mental\r\nacquirements is the power of discriminating among things which differ\r\nin many minute points, but whose general similarity of appearance\r\nusually deceives the common observer into a belief of their identity.\r\nThe study of insects, in this point of view, is most peculiarly adapted\r\nfor youth. According to our experience, it is exceedingly difficult for\r\npersons arrived at manhood to acquire this power of discrimination;\r\nbut, in early life, a little care on the part of the parent or teacher\r\nwill render it comparatively easy. In this study the knowledge of\r\nthings should go along with that of words. \"If names perish,\" says\r\nLinnæus, \"the knowledge of things perishes also:\"[J] and, without\r\nnames, how can any one communicate to another the knowledge he has\r\nacquired relative to any particular fact, either of physiology, habit,\r\nutility, or locality? On the other hand, mere catalogue learning is as\r\nmuch to be rejected as the loose generalizations of the despisers of\r\nclassification and nomenclature. To name a plant, or an insect, or a\r\nbird, or a quadruped rightly, is one step towards an accurate knowledge\r\nof it; but it is not the knowledge itself. It is the means, and not the\r\nend in natural history, as in every other science.\r\n\r\nIf the bias of opening curiosity be properly directed, there is not\r\nany branch of natural history so fascinating to youth as the study of\r\ninsects. It is, indeed, a common practice in many families to teach\r\nchildren, from their earliest infancy, to treat the greater number\r\nof insects as if they were venomous and dangerous, and, of course,\r\nmeriting to be destroyed, or at least avoided with horror. Associations\r\nare by this means linked with the very appearance of insects, which\r\nbecome gradually more inveterate with advancing years; provided, as\r\nmost frequently happens, the same system be persisted in, of avoiding\r\nor destroying almost every insect which is unlucky enough to attract\r\nobservation. How much rational amusement and innocent pleasure is\r\nthus thoughtlessly lost; and how many disagreeable feelings are thus\r\ncreated, in the most absurd manner! In order to show that the study\r\nor (if the word be disliked) the observation of insects is peculiarly\r\nfascinating to children, even in their early infancy, we may refer\r\nto what we have seen in the family of a friend, who is partial to\r\nthis, as well as to all the departments of natural history. Our\r\nfriend's children, a boy and girl, were taught, from the moment they\r\ncould distinguish insects, to treat them as objects of interest and\r\ncuriosity, and not to be afraid even of those which wore the most\r\nrepulsive appearance. The little girl, for example, when just beginning\r\nto walk alone, encountered one day a large staphylinus (_Goërius\r\nolens?_ Stephens; vulgo, _the devil's coach-horse_), which she\r\nfearlessly seized, and did not quit her hold, though the insect grasped\r\none of her fingers in his formidable jaws. The mother, who was by,\r\nknew enough of the insect to be rather alarmed for the consequences,\r\nthough she prudently concealed her feelings from the child. She did\r\nwell; for the insect was not strong enough to break the skin, and\r\nthe child took no notice of its attempts to bite her finger. A whole\r\nseries of disagreeable associations with this formidable-looking family\r\nof insects was thus averted at the very moment when a different mode\r\nof acting on the part of the mother would have produced the contrary\r\neffect. For more than two years after this occurrence the little girl\r\nand her brother assisted in adding numerous specimens to their father's\r\ncollection, without the parents ever having cause, from any accident,\r\nto repent of their employing themselves in this manner. The sequel\r\nof the little girl's history strikingly illustrates the position for\r\nwhich we contend. The child happened to be sent to a relative in the\r\ncountry, where she was not long in having carefully instilled into her\r\nmind all the usual antipathies against \"everything that creepeth on\r\nthe earth;\" and though she afterwards returned to her paternal home,\r\nno persuasion or remonstrance could ever again persuade her to touch\r\na common beetle, much less a staphylinus, with its tail turned up in\r\na threatening attitude, and its formidable jaws ready extended for\r\nattack or defence.[K] We do not wish that children should be encouraged\r\nto expose themselves to danger in their encounters with insects. They\r\nshould be taught to avoid those few which are really noxious--to admire\r\nall--to injure none.\r\n\r\nThe various beauty of insects--their glittering colours, their\r\ngraceful forms--supplies an inexhaustible source of attraction. Even\r\nthe most formidable insects, both in appearance and reality,--the\r\ndragon-fly, which is perfectly harmless to man, and the wasp, whose\r\nsting every human being almost instinctively shuns,--are splendid in\r\ntheir appearance, and are painted with all the brilliancy of natural\r\nhues. It has been remarked that the plumage of tropical birds is not\r\nsuperior in vivid colouring to what may be observed in the greater\r\nnumber of butterflies and moths.[L] \"See,\" exclaims Linnæus, \"the\r\nlarge, elegant painted wings of the butterfly, four in number, covered\r\nwith delicate feathery scales! With these it sustains itself in the\r\nair a whole day, rivalling the flight of birds and the brilliancy\r\nof the peacock. Consider this insect through the wonderful progress\r\nof its life,--how different is the first period of its being from\r\nthe second, and both from the parent insect! Its changes are an\r\ninexplicable enigma to us: we see a green caterpillar, furnished with\r\nsixteen feet, feeding upon the leaves of a plant; this is changed into\r\na chrysalis, smooth, of golden lustre, hanging suspended to a fixed\r\npoint, without feet, and subsisting without food; this insect again\r\nundergoes another transformation, acquires wings, and six feet, and\r\nbecomes a gay butterfly, sporting in the air, and living by suction\r\nupon the honey of plants. What has nature produced more worthy of\r\nour admiration than such an animal, coming upon the stage of the\r\nworld, and playing its part there under so many different masks?\" The\r\nancients were so struck with the transformations of the butterfly,\r\nand its revival from a seeming temporary death, as to have considered\r\nit an emblem of the soul, the Greek word _pysche_ signifying both the\r\nsoul and a butterfly; and it is for this reason that we find the\r\nbutterfly introduced into their allegorical sculptures as an emblem\r\nof immortality. Trifling, therefore, and perhaps contemptible, as to\r\nthe unthinking may seem the study of a butterfly, yet when we consider\r\nthe art and mechanism displayed in so minute a structure,--the fluids\r\ncirculating in vessels so small as almost to escape the sight--the\r\nbeauty of the wings and covering--and the manner in which each part\r\nis adapted for its peculiar functions,--we cannot but be struck with\r\nwonder and admiration, and allow, with Paley, that \"the production of\r\nbeauty was as much in the Creator's mind in painting a butterfly as in\r\ngiving symmetry to the human form.\"\r\n\r\nA collection of insects is to the true naturalist what a collection\r\nof medals is to the accurate student of history. The mere collector,\r\nwho looks only to the shining wings of the one, or the green rust of\r\nthe other, derives little knowledge from his pursuit. But the cabinet\r\nof the naturalist becomes rich in the most interesting subjects of\r\ncontemplation, when he regards it in the genuine spirit of scientific\r\ninquiry. What, for instance, can be so delightful as to examine the\r\nwonderful variety of structure in this portion of the creation; and,\r\nabove all, to trace the beautiful gradations by which one species runs\r\ninto another? Their differences are so minute, that an unpractised\r\neye would proclaim their identity; and yet, when the species are\r\nseparated, and not very distantly, they become visible even to\r\nthe common observer. It is in examinations such as these that the\r\nnaturalist finds a delight of the highest order. While it is thus one\r\nof the legitimate objects of his study to attend to minute differences\r\nof structure, form, and colouring, he is not less interested in the\r\ninvestigation of habits and economy; and in this respect the insect\r\nworld is inexhaustibly rich. We find herein examples of instinct to\r\nparallel those of all the larger animals, whether they are solitary\r\nor social; and innumerable others besides, altogether unlike those\r\nmanifested in the superior departments of animated nature. These\r\ninstincts have various directions, and are developed in a more or less\r\nstriking manner to our senses, according to the force of the motive by\r\nwhich they are governed. Some of their instincts have for their object\r\nthe preservation of insects from external attack; some have reference\r\nto procuring food, and involve many remarkable stratagems; some direct\r\ntheir social economy, and regulate the condition under which they\r\nlive together either in monarchies or republics, their colonizations,\r\nand their migrations; but the most powerful instinct which belongs\r\nto insects has regard to the preservation of their species. We find,\r\naccordingly, that as the necessity for this preservation is of the\r\nutmost importance in the economy of nature, so for this especial object\r\nmany insects, whose offspring, whether in the egg or the larva state,\r\nare peculiarly exposed to danger, are endued with an almost miraculous\r\nforesight, and with an ingenuity, perseverance, and unconquerable\r\nindustry, for the purpose of avoiding those dangers, which are not to\r\nbe paralleled even by the most singular efforts of human contrivance.\r\nThe same ingenuity which is employed for protecting either eggs, or\r\ncaterpillars and grubs, or pupæ and chrysalides, is also exercised\r\nby many insects for their own preservation against the changes of\r\ntemperature to which they are exposed, or against their natural\r\nenemies. Many species employ those contrivances during the period of\r\ntheir hibernation, or winter sleep. For all these purposes some dig\r\nholes in the earth, and form them into cells; others build nests of\r\nextraneous substances, such as bits of wood and leaves; others roll\r\nup leaves into cases, which they close with the most curious art;\r\nothers build a house of mud, and line it with the cotton of trees, or\r\nthe petals of the most delicate flowers; others construct cells, of\r\nsecretions from their own bodies; others form cocoons, in which they\r\nundergo their transformation; and others dig subterraneous galleries,\r\nwhich, in their complexity of arrangement, in solidity, and in complete\r\nadaptation to their purposes, vie with the cities of civilised man. The\r\ncontrivances by which insects effect these objects have been accurately\r\nobserved and minutely described, by patient and philosophical\r\ninquirers, who knew that such employments of the instinct with which\r\neach species is endowed by its Creator offered the most valuable and\r\ninstructive lessons, and opened to them a wide field of the most\r\ndelightful study. The construction of their habitations is certainly\r\namong the most remarkable peculiarities in the economy of insects; and\r\nit is of this subject that we propose to treat under the general name,\r\nwhich is sufficiently applicable to our purpose, of Insect Architecture.\r\n\r\nIn the descriptions which we shall give of Insect Architecture, we\r\nshall employ as few technical words as possible: and such as we cannot\r\nwell avoid, we shall explain in their places; but, since our subject\r\nchiefly relates to the reproduction of insects, it may be useful to\r\nmany readers to introduce here a brief description of the changes which\r\nthey undergo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Magnified eggs, of _a_, _Geometra armillata_; _b_, of an\r\nunknown water insect; _c_, of the lacquey moth; _d_, of a caddis-fly\r\n(_Phryganea atrata_); _e_, of red under-wing moth (_Catocala nupta_);\r\n_f_, of _Pontia Brassicæ_; _g_, of the Clifden Nonpareil moth.]\r\n\r\nIt was of old believed that insects were produced spontaneously by\r\nputrefying substances; and Virgil gives the details of a process for\r\n_creating_ a swarm of bees out of the carcase of a bull; but Redi, a\r\ncelebrated Italian naturalist, proved by rigid experiments that they\r\nare always, in such cases, hatched from _eggs_ previously laid. Most\r\ninsects, indeed, lay eggs, though some few are viviparous, and some\r\npropagate both ways. The eggs of insects are very various in form,\r\nand seldom shaped like those of birds. We have here figured those of\r\nseveral species, as they appear under the microscope.\r\n\r\nWhen an insect first issues from the egg, it is called by naturalists\r\n_larva_, and, popularly, a caterpillar, a grub, or a maggot. The\r\ndistinction, in popular language, seems to be, that _caterpillars_ are\r\nproduced from the eggs of moths or butterflies; _grubs_ from the eggs\r\nof beetles, bees, wasps, &c.; and _maggots_ (which are without feet)\r\nfrom blow-flies, house-flies, cheese-flies, &c., though this is not\r\nvery rigidly adhered to in common parlance. Maggots are also sometimes\r\ncalled _worms_, as in the instance of the meal-worm; but the common\r\nearth-worm is not a larva, nor is it by modern naturalists ranked among\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _a_, Ametabolous pupa of Cicada; _b_, caterpillar of\r\ntussock moth (_Laria fascelina_); _c_, larva of the poplar beetle\r\n(_Chrysomela populi_); _d_, larva of Sinex; _e_, larva of the common\r\ngnat.]\r\n\r\nThere are, however, certain larvæ, as those of the Cicada, the\r\ncrickets, the water-boatman (_Notonecta_), the cockroach, &c., which\r\nresemble the perfect insects in form, excepting that they are destitute\r\nof wings; but in the pupa state these appear in a rudimentary\r\ncondition, at least in such species as have wings in the mature stage\r\nof existence. The pupæ are active and eat. Insects, the larvæ and pupæ\r\nof which are so similar to the adults, are termed _Ametabolous_ (_a_,\r\nwithout, [Greek: metabolê], change); those the larvæ of which undergo\r\nchanges of a marked character, _Metabolous_ (_Insecta ametabola_ and\r\n_Insecta metabola_, Burmeister).\r\n\r\nLarvæ are remarkably small at first, but grow rapidly. The full-grown\r\ncaterpillar of the goat-moth (_Cossus ligniperda_) is thus seventy-two\r\nthousand times heavier than when it issues from the egg; and the\r\nmaggot of the blow-fly is, in twenty-four hours, one hundred and\r\nfifty-five times heavier than at its birth. Some larvæ have feet,\r\nothers are without; none have wings. They cannot propagate. They feed\r\nvoraciously on coarse substances; and as they increase in size, which\r\nthey do very rapidly, they cast their skins three or four times. In\r\ndefending themselves from injury, and in preparing for their change by\r\nthe construction of secure abodes, they manifest great ingenuity and\r\nmechanical skill. The figures on the preceding page exemplify various\r\nforms of insects in this stage of their existence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _a_, Pupa of a Water-Beetle (_Hydrophilus_); _b_, pupa\r\nof _Sphinx Ligustri_.]\r\n\r\nWhen larvæ are full grown, they cast their skins for the last time,\r\nundergo a complete change of form, excepting in the case of ametabolous\r\nlarvæ, cease to eat, and remain nearly motionless. The inner skin\r\nof the larva now becomes converted into a membranous or leathery\r\ncovering, which wraps the insect closely up like a mummy: in this\r\ncondition it is termed _Pupa_, from its resemblance to an infant in\r\nswaddling bands. Nympha, or nymph, is another term given to insects\r\nin this stage;[M] moreover from the pupæ of many of the butterflies\r\nappearing gilt as if with gold, the Greeks called them _Chrysalides_,\r\nand the Romans _Aureliæ_, and hence naturalists frequently call a pupa\r\n_chrysalis_, even when it is not gilt. We shall see, as we proceed,\r\nthe curious contrivances resorted to for protecting insects in this\r\nhelpless state. The following are examples of insects in the _imago_,\r\nor perfect state.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Insects in the Imago or perfect state.\r\n\r\n_a_, _Nemopteryx coa_, Leach.--_b_, _Myrmeleon formicalynx_,\r\nFabricius.--_c_, _Hesperia comma_, Fabricius.--_d_, _Nepa cinerea_,\r\nLinnæus.]\r\n\r\nAfter a certain time, the insect which has remained in its pupa-case,\r\nlike a mass of jelly without shape, is gradually preparing for its\r\nfinal change, when it takes the form of a perfect insect. This state\r\nwas called by Linnæus _Imago_, because the insect, having thrown off\r\nits mask, becomes a perfect _image_ of its species. Of some, this\r\nlast portion of their existence is very short, others live through\r\na year, and some exist for longer periods. They feed lightly, and\r\nnever increase in size. The chief object of all is to perpetuate\r\ntheir species, after which the greater number quickly die. It is in\r\nthis state that they exercise those remarkable instincts for the\r\npreservation of their race, which are exhibited in their preparations\r\nfor the shelter of their eggs, and the nourishment of their larvæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER II._\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURES FOR PROTECTING EGGS.--MASON-WASPS; MASON-BEES; MINING-BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe provisions which are made by the different species of insects\r\nfor protecting their eggs, appear in many cases to be admirably\r\nproportioned to the kind of danger and destruction to which they\r\nmay be exposed. The eggs themselves, indeed, are not so liable to\r\ndepredation and injury as the young brood hatched from them; for, like\r\nthe seeds of plants, they are capable of withstanding greater degrees\r\nboth of heat and cold than the insects which produce them. According\r\nto the experiments of Spallanzani, the eggs of frogs that had been\r\nexposed to various degrees of artificial heat were scarcely altered in\r\ntheir productive powers by a temperature of 111° of Fahrenheit, but\r\nthey became corrupted after 133°. He tried the same experiment upon\r\ntadpoles and frogs, and found they all died at 111°. Silkworms died at\r\na temperature of 108°, while their eggs did not entirely cease to be\r\nfertile till 144°. The larvæ of flesh-flies perished, while the eggs\r\nof the same species continued fertile, at about the same comparative\r\ndegrees of heat as in the preceding instances. Intense cold has a\r\nstill less effect upon eggs than extreme heat. Spallanzani exposed the\r\neggs of silk-worms to an artificial cold 23° below zero, and yet, in\r\nthe subsequent spring, they all produced caterpillars. Insects almost\r\ninvariably die at the temperature of 14°, that is, at 18° below the\r\nfreezing point.[N] The care of insects for the protection of their eggs\r\nis not entirely directed to their preservation in the most favourable\r\ntemperature for being hatched, but to secure them against the numerous\r\nenemies which would attempt their destruction; and, above all, to\r\nprotect the grubs, when they are first developed, from those injuries\r\nto which they are peculiarly exposed. Their prospective contrivances\r\nfor accomplishing these objects are in the highest degree curious.\r\n\r\nMost persons have more or less acquaintance with the hives of the\r\nsocial species of bees and wasps; but little is generally known of the\r\nnests constructed by the solitary species, though in many respects\r\nthese are not inferior to the others in displays of ingenuity and\r\nskill. We admire the social bees, labouring together for one common\r\nend, in the same way that we look with delight upon the great division\r\nof labour in a well-ordered manufactory. As in a cotton-mill some\r\nattend to the carding of the raw material, some to its formation into\r\nsingle threads, some to the gathering these threads upon spindles,\r\nothers to the union of many threads into one,--all labouring with\r\ninvariable precision because they attend to a single object;--so do\r\nwe view with delight and wonder the successive steps by which the\r\nhive-bees bring their beautiful work to its completion,--striving, by\r\nindividual efforts, to accomplish their general task, never impeding\r\neach other by useless assistance, each taking a particular department,\r\nand each knowing its own duties. We may, however, not the less admire\r\nthe solitary wasp or bee, who begins and finishes every part of its\r\ndestined work; just as we admire the ingenious mechanic who perfects\r\nsomething useful or ornamental entirely by the labour of his own\r\nhands,--whether he be the patient Chinese carver, who cuts the most\r\nelaborately-decorated boxes out of a solid piece of ivory, or the\r\nturner of Europe, who produces every variety of elegant form by the\r\nskilful application of the simplest means.\r\n\r\nOur island abounds with many varieties of solitary wasps and bees; and\r\ntheir nests may therefore be easily discovered by those who, in the\r\nproper seasons, are desirous of observing the peculiarities of their\r\narchitecture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Odynerus._--Natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMason-Wasps.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1828, a common species of solitary mason-wasp\r\n(_Odynerus_, Latr.) was observed by us (J. R.) on the east wall of\r\na house at Lee, in Kent, very busy in excavating a hole in one of\r\nthe bricks, about five feet from the ground. Whether there might not\r\nhave been an accidental hole in the brick before the wasp commenced\r\nher labours, is unknown, as she had made considerable progress in\r\nthe work when first observed: but the brick was one of the hardest\r\nof the yellow sort made in this neighbourhood. The most remarkable\r\ncircumstance in the process of hewing into the brick was the care of\r\nthe insect in removing to a distance the fragments which from time\r\nto time she succeeded in detaching. It did not appear to suit her\r\ndesign to wear down the brick, particle by particle, as the furniture\r\nbeetle (_Anobium pertinax_) does in making its pin-hole galleries in\r\nold wood. Our wasp-architect, on the contrary, by means of her strong\r\n_tranchant_-toothed jaws, severed a piece usually about the bigness\r\nof a mustard-seed. It might have been supposed that these fragments\r\nwould have been tossed out of the hole as the work proceeded, without\r\nfurther concern; as the mole tosses above ground the earth which\r\nhas been cleared out of its subterranean gallery. The wasp was of a\r\ndifferent opinion; for it was possible that a heap of brick chips,\r\nat the bottom of the wall, might lead to the discovery of her nest\r\nby some of her enemies, particularly by one or other of the numerous\r\ntribe of what are called _ichneumon_-flies. This name is given to\r\nthem, from the similarity of their habit of destroying eggs, to that\r\nof the little animal which proves so formidable an enemy to the\r\nmultiplication of the crocodile of Egypt. They may be also denominated\r\n_cuckoo_-flies, because, like that bird, they thrust their egg into\r\nthe nest of another species. These flies are continually prowling\r\nabout and prying into every corner, to find, by stealth, a nidus for\r\ntheir eggs. It might have been some such consideration as this which\r\ninduced the wasp to carry off the fragments as they were successively\r\ndetached. That concealment was the motive, indeed, was proved: for\r\none of the fragments which fell out of the hole by accident, she\r\nimmediately sought for at the bottom of the wall, and carried off\r\nlike the rest. It was no easy matter to get out one of the fragments,\r\nas may readily be conceived when the size of the insect is compared\r\nwith that of the entrance of which this ([Illustration]) is the exact\r\nsize, as taken from the impression of a bit of dough upon the hole\r\nwhen finished. It was only by seizing the fragment with her jaws, and\r\nretreating backwards, that the matter could be accomplished; though,\r\nafter the interior of the excavation was barely large enough to admit\r\nof her turning round, she more than once attempted to make her exit\r\nhead-foremost, but always unsuccessfully. The weight of the fragments\r\nremoved did not appear to impede her flight, and she generally returned\r\nto her task in about two or three minutes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mandibles--Jaws of Mason-Wasp.--Greatly magnified.]\r\n\r\nWithin two days the excavation was completed; but it required two other\r\ndays to line it with a coating of clay, to deposit the eggs, two in\r\nnumber, and, no doubt, to imprison a few live spiders or caterpillars\r\nfor the young when hatched--a process which was first observed by Ray\r\nand Willughby,[O] but which has since been frequently ascertained. In\r\nthe present instance, this peculiarity was not seen; but the little\r\narchitect was detected in closing up the entrance, which was formed of\r\na layer of clay more than double the thickness of the interior lining.\r\nIn November following, we hewed away the brick around this nest, and\r\nfound the whole excavation was rather less than an inch in depth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cuckoo-Fly (_Tachina larvarum?_).--Natural size.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all the precautions of the careful parent to conceal\r\nher nest it was found out by one of the cuckoo-flies (_Tachina\r\nlarvarum?_)--probably a common species very similar to the house-fly,\r\nbut rather larger, which deposited an egg there; and the grub hatched\r\nfrom it, after devouring one of the wasp-grubs, formed itself a cocoon\r\n(_a_), as did the other undevoured grub of the wasp (_b_). Both awaited\r\nthe return of summer to change into winged insects, burst their\r\ncerements, and proceed as their parents did.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mason-Wasp's Nest and Cocoons.--About one-third the\r\nnatural size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mason-Wasp (_Odynerus murarius_).--Natural size.]\r\n\r\nAnother mason-wasp (_Odynerus murarius_, Latr.), differing little in\r\nappearance from the former, may often be seen frequenting sandy banks\r\nexposed to the sun, and constructing its singular burrows. The sort\r\nof sand-bank which it selects is hard and compact; and though this\r\nmay be more difficult to penetrate, the walls are not liable to fall\r\ndown upon the little miner. In such a bank, the mason-wasp bores a\r\ntubular gallery two or three inches deep. The sand upon which Réaumur\r\nfound some of these wasps at work was almost as hard as stone, and\r\nyielded with difficulty to his nail; but the wasps dug into it with\r\nease, having recourse, as he ascertained, to the ingenious device of\r\nmoistening it by letting fall two or three drops of fluid from their\r\nmouth, which rendered the mass ductile, and the separation of the\r\ngrains easy to the double pickaxe of the little pioneers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nests, &c., of Mason-Wasps.--About half the natural size.\r\n\r\n_a_, The tower of the nest; _b_, the entrance after the tower is\r\nremoved; _c_, the cell; _d_, the cell, with a roll of caterpillars\r\nprepared for the larva.]\r\n\r\nWhen this wasp has detached a few grains of the moistened sand, it\r\nkneads them together into a pellet about the size of one of the seeds\r\nof a gooseberry. With the first pellet which it detaches, it lays\r\nthe foundation of a round tower, as an outwork, immediately over the\r\nmouth of its nest. Every pellet which it afterwards carries off from\r\nthe interior is added to the wall of this outer round tower, which\r\nadvances in height as the hole in the sand increases in depth. Every\r\ntwo or three minutes, however, during these operations, it takes a\r\nshort excursion, for the purpose, probably, of replenishing its store\r\nof fluid wherewith to moisten the sand. Yet so little time is lost,\r\nthat Réaumur has seen a mason-wasp dig in an hour a hole the length of\r\nits body, and at the same time build as much of its round tower. For\r\nthe greater part of its height this round tower is perpendicular; but\r\ntowards the summit it bends into a curve, corresponding to the bend\r\nof the insect's body, which in all cases of insect architecture, is\r\nthe model followed. The pellets which form the walls of the tower are\r\nnot very nicely joined, and numerous vacuities are left between them,\r\ngiving it the appearance of filigree-work. That it should be thus\r\nslightly built is not surprising, for it is intended as a temporary\r\nstructure for protecting the insect while it is excavating its hole,\r\nand as a pile of materials, well arranged and ready at hand, for the\r\ncompletion of the interior building,--in the same way that workmen make\r\na regular pile of bricks near the spot where they are going to build.\r\nThis seems, in fact, to be the main design of the tower, which is taken\r\ndown as expeditiously as it had been reared. Réaumur thinks that, by\r\npiling in the sand which has previously been dug out, the wasp intends\r\nto guard her progeny for a time from being exposed to the too violent\r\nheat of the sun; and he has even sometimes seen that there were not\r\nsufficient materials in the tower, in which case the wasp had recourse\r\nto the rubbish she had thrown out after the tower was completed. By\r\nraising a tower of the materials which she excavates, the wasp produces\r\nthe same shelter from external heat as a human creature would who chose\r\nto inhabit a deep cellar of a high house. She further protects her\r\nprogeny from the ichneumon-fly, as the engineer constructs an outwork\r\nto render more difficult the approach of an enemy to the citadel.\r\nRéaumur has seen this indefatigable enemy of the wasp peep into the\r\nmouth of the tower, and then retreat, apparently frightened at the\r\ndepth of the cell which he was anxious to invade.\r\n\r\nThe mason-wasp does not furnish the cell she has thus constructed with\r\npollen and honey, like the solitary bees, but with living caterpillars,\r\nand these always of the same species--being of a green colour, and\r\nwithout feet. She fixes the caterpillars together in a spiral column:\r\nthey cannot alter their position, although they remain alive. They\r\nare an easy prey to their smaller enemy; and when the grub has eaten\r\nthem all up, it spins a case, and is transformed into a pupa, which\r\nafterwards becomes a wasp. The number of caterpillars which is thus\r\nfound in the lower cavity of the mason-wasp's nest is ordinarily from\r\nten to twelve. The mother is careful to lay in the exact quantity of\r\nprovision which is necessary to the growth of the grub before he quits\r\nhis retreat. He works through his store till his increase in this\r\nstate is perfected, and he is on the point of undergoing a change into\r\nanother state, in which he requires no food. The careful purveyor,\r\ncruel indeed in her choice of a supply, but not the less directed by\r\nan unerring instinct, selects such caterpillars as she is conscious\r\nhave completed their growth, and will remain thus imprisoned without\r\nincrease or corruption till their destroyer has gradually satisfied\r\nthe necessities of his being. \"All that the worm of the wasp,\" says\r\nRéaumur, \"has to do in his nest, from his birth to his transformation,\r\nis to eat.\" There is another species of wasp which does not at once\r\nenclose in its nest all the sustenance which its larva will require\r\nbefore transformation, but which from time to time imprisons a living\r\ncaterpillar, and when that is consumed, opens the nest and introduces\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n[The upper figure in the accompanying illustration exhibits two of the\r\ncurious towers built by this interesting insect and drawn of their\r\nnatural size.]\r\n\r\nThe insect is one of the most plentiful in England, and can be found\r\non sunny days, flitting about sand-banks and making its curious\r\nhabitations. The length is nearly half an inch, and the colour is\r\nblack, variegated with five yellow bands upon the abdomen.\r\n\r\nThe lower figure represents the habitations of one of the British\r\nsolitary wasps, _Pompilus punctum_, and is given in order to show a\r\ncurious resemblance in the structure. The specimen from which the\r\nsketch was taken was found under the eaves of a roof which protected\r\na bee-hive. The cells were thirteen in number, very carefully\r\nconstructed of earth, and several of them were closed. Although these\r\ncells were not fossorial in their nature, several other species of\r\nthe same genus are as accomplished burrowers as any insect. _Pompilus\r\nplumbeus_, for example, another black species, burrows into sand, and\r\nis very plentiful on our more southern shores. It may usually be found\r\nhovering about sand-banks, and flitting about with such agility that it\r\nis by no means an easy insect to catch. The male is peculiarly apt to\r\nevade the stroke of the entomologist's net.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThen there is _Pompilus rufipes_, which is a black insect, but\r\ndistinguished by the conspicuous red colour of the hind legs. This is\r\nvery fond of our coasts, and may be found wherever the soil is suitable\r\nfor its excavations. Many species of this genus carry off spiders for\r\nthe purpose of provisioning their nests. Several species, which live\r\nfar inland, prefer light and dry earth to sand, and make therein their\r\nburrows, preferring our little white spider as the provision for their\r\nyoung. Although the same insect may be often observed to carry the\r\nsame kind of prey to its home, it does not at all follow that no change\r\nis ever made.\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable example of this fact may be found in a very\r\ncommon swift-winged insect, black in colour, with a reddish patch on\r\nthe end of the abdomen. Its name is _Trachytes pompiliformis_, and\r\nit generally stocks its nest with small caterpillars. Mr. F. Smith,\r\nhowever, has taken it when in the act of carrying off a small species\r\nof grasshopper--certainly the very last insect that would be thought of\r\nas likely to be immured by a captor which must be scarcely larger than\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThis insect is to be found in most warm and sandy situations, and may\r\nbe looked for at the end of summer and beginning of autumn. It may be\r\neasily known by its red spot on the abdomen, and the large, transverse\r\nhead; it is wider than the thorax.\r\n\r\nOne species of mining-bee, not often found in England, chooses some\r\nvery singular insects wherewith to feed its young. Its name is\r\n_Philanthus triangulum_, and it is a very fierce, waspish-looking\r\ncreature, with a large wide head, wider even than the thorax, sharp and\r\npowerful jaws, and with broad wings. The head and thighs are black,\r\nwith a few spots of a yellowish white, and the abdomen is yellow, with\r\na black spot in the middle of each segment. Its length rather exceeds\r\nhalf an inch. The actions of this insect do not belie its looks, for it\r\nis a fierce and active creature, seizing upon various bees and dragging\r\nthem into its tunnel.\r\n\r\nMr. F. Smith discovered the metropolis of this usually scarce insect\r\nat Sandown Bay, in the Isle of Wight, and has given an interesting\r\ndescription of its habits. He states that although it is so ferocious\r\ntowards other insects, it appears to be perfectly harmless as far as\r\nman is concerned, allowing itself to be handled without even attempting\r\nto use its sting. Indeed, he was quite unable to provoke the insect to\r\ndo so. Various bees were captured by the Philanthus, and the favourites\r\nseemed to belong to the genus Andrena, itself a burrowing bee, and the\r\ncommon hive-bee. The Philanthus seemed perfectly indifferent whether\r\nthey attacked the comparatively small and feeble Andrena, or the\r\nformidable hive-bee, taking them as they came, and caring nothing\r\nfor the sting. The Philanthus that burrowed on the top of the cliff,\r\nseemed to prefer the hive-bee, because the red clover attracted greater\r\nnumbers of that insect. Those that made their burrows at the top of the\r\ncliff, took the Andrenæ. Of course, the Philanthus is obliged to catch\r\nmore of the Andrenæ than the hive bees. Only one species of this genus\r\nis known in England; it is to be found in July and August.\r\n\r\nThere is a very large genus of rather small humming-bees, many of which\r\nare popularly mistaken for wasps, on account of their sharply pointed\r\nand yellow banded abdomen; they belong to the genus Crabro, and are\r\nextremely variable in the material into which they burrow, and the\r\ninsects with which they feed their young. Some species burrow into dry\r\nbramble sticks. If the reader should wish to obtain specimens of them,\r\nas well as other burrowers, he will find bramble, rose, and jessamine\r\nsticks most prolific in them. The best plan is to collect a quantity\r\nof these sticks and put them into glass tubes, with the ends stopped\r\nwith wire gauze; there is then an absolute certainty of identifying the\r\ninsect with its habitation. The spring is the best time for collecting.\r\nSometimes these creatures are afflicted with parasites, which also are\r\ndetained in the tube, so as to yield valuable information to the captor.\r\n\r\nSome species burrow in sand-banks and feed their young with gnats,\r\nothers burrow into dead timber, and stock their tunnels with flies\r\nof various kinds. One very useful species, _Crabro lævis_, burrows\r\nin sand-banks, and provisions its nest with the noxious turnip-fleas\r\n(_Halticæ_), great numbers of which are needed to stock a single\r\nburrow. It is rather a social insect, many burrows being often found\r\nnear each other. The turnip-flea has so hard a shell, that the young\r\nCrabro seems hardly capable of eating it. Mr. Smith, however, has\r\nremarked that another burrowing-bee stocks its nest with certain\r\nweevils that are almost too hard to be pierced with a pin, and that the\r\nshell is probably softened by the damp ground. The greater number of\r\nthis group, however, are burrowers into the ground, and stock their\r\nnests with flies of some kind.\r\n\r\nAnother species of this large genus, _Crabro luteipalpis_, is fond of\r\nmaking its burrows in the mortar of old walls, preferring those spots\r\nwhere nails have been drawn, making the process of burrowing easier\r\nfor the insect. It is not uncommon in the outskirts of London. All\r\ngardeners, especially those who cultivate roses, ought to encourage\r\nthis very little insect, and welcome its presence, for it provisions\r\nits nest with the aphides, or green blight, which infect the\r\nrose-trees, and which have destroyed so many promising plants.\r\n\r\nThe female, which is the larger of the two sexes, measures only three\r\nlines in length. The colour is shining black, and the head is rather\r\nsquared.\r\n\r\nAmong other burrowing species of this genus we may mention _Crabro\r\nvarius_, a rather long and slender insect, black in colour, with yellow\r\nspottings about the thorax. It prefers very hard fine sand, such as is\r\nfound in partially excavated sand-banks, and provisions its burrows\r\nwith gnats. It is tolerably plentiful.\r\n\r\nOur last example of the earth-burrowers belonging to this genus is\r\n_Crabro Wesmoeli_, which chooses similar localities, being mostly found\r\nin sand-banks. It carries off flies of different kinds for the food\r\nof its young. There is a very common insect, closely allied to the\r\nlast mentioned genus, whose horns are worthy of notice. This is called\r\n_Typoxylon figulus_. It is a small creature, with a large head and\r\nslender abdomen. Its colour is black, and on the edges of the segments\r\nof the abdomen there is a little silvery shining down.\r\n\r\nIt generally burrows into light earth, though it sometimes drives its\r\ntunnel into decayed wood. In either case, it provisions its nest with\r\nspiders, flying into the hedges, pulling the unfortunate spiders out\r\nof their webs, and carrying them into the burrow. One burrow contains\r\na series of cells, which are separated from each other by partitions\r\nof sand, the particles of which are firmly cemented together by some\r\nglutinous substance secreted by the insect. Some species of this genus\r\nburrow into the pith of the bramble and other shrubs.\r\n\r\nOne of the most determined of our British burrowers is the insect which\r\nis known by the name of _Ammophila sabulosa_. It has a large, squared\r\nhead, wider than the thorax, a very long and slender body, and short\r\nthough powerful wings. The colour is black, with a slight rust-red tint\r\non the base of the abdomen.\r\n\r\nWhen the female has dug her burrow, she sets off in search of a\r\ncaterpillar of proportionate size, and having conveyed it into her\r\ndwelling, she affixes an egg to the imprisoned larva, and goes off in\r\nsearch of another, carefully stopping up the entrance with stones. In\r\nfine weather she will fill one burrow with caterpillars in a few hours,\r\nand then begin another nursery for the future young. This species\r\nappears always to make use of caterpillars, but another allied species\r\nprefers spiders. Mr. F. Smith mentions that he has found in a high\r\nsand-bank as many as twenty females apparently hibernating together\r\ntill suitable weather enabled them to pursue their usual economy.\r\n\r\nThere really seems to be scarcely any genus of insect that is not\r\nseized upon by one or other of these burrowers, and packed away in a\r\nhalf living state to form food for their young. There is one of these\r\nsolitary burrowing wasps called the _Astata boops_, deriving its\r\nspecific name from its large round eyes, which in the male completely\r\nunite at the back of the head. The abdomen is shaped something like\r\na boy's peg-top, or a symmetrical turnip, the peg of the top, or the\r\npoint of the turnip, corresponding to the top of the abdomen. Its\r\nlength is about half an inch, and its colour is black, with a rust-red\r\npatch on the end of the abdomen.\r\n\r\nThere is a remarkably pretty, and very variable, sand-wasp, which is\r\nplentiful in most parts of the country. The colour is black, and the\r\nabdomen is banded by four yellow bars. Its feet are also yellow. Mr.\r\nSmith has written a very interesting account of the proceedings of this\r\ninsect.\r\n\r\n\"Having frequently observed the habits of the type of this genus,\r\n_Mellinus arvensis_, and reared it from the larva state, a few\r\nobservations are here recorded. When the parent insect has formed\r\na burrow of the required length, and enlarged the extremity into\r\na chamber of proper dimensions, she issues forth in search of the\r\nproper nutriment for her young; this consists of various dipterous\r\ninsects: species of various genera are equally adapted to her\r\npurpose--_Muscidæ_, _Syrphidæ_, &c., are captured.\r\n\r\n\"It is amusing to see four or five females lie in wait upon a patch\r\nof cow-dung until some luckless fly settles on it. When this happens,\r\na cunning and gradual approach is made; a sudden attempt would not\r\nsucceed. The fly is the insect of quickest flight, therefore a degree\r\nof intrigue is necessary. This is managed by running past the victim\r\nslowly, and apparently in an unconcerned manner, until the poor fly is\r\ncaught unawares, and carried off by the Mellinus to its burrow. The\r\nfirst fly being deposited, an egg is laid. The necessary number of\r\nflies are soon secured, and her task is completed. Sometimes she is\r\ninterrupted by rainy weather, and it is some days ere she can store up\r\nthe quantity required.\r\n\r\n\"A larva found feeding became full-fed in ten days. Six flies were\r\ndevoured, the heads, harder parts of the throat, portions of the\r\nabdomen, and the legs, being left untouched. The larva spins a tough,\r\nthin, brown silken cocoon, passes the winter and spring in the larva\r\nstate, changes to the nymph on the approach of summer, and appears\r\nabout the beginning of autumn in the perfect state.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a genus of hymenopterous insects known by the name of\r\n_Scolia_, which are remarkable for their fossorial powers. The species\r\nrepresented in the engraving is called _Scolia Xantiana_, and is a\r\nnative of California.\r\n\r\nWhen the female Scolia is about to fulfil the great object for which\r\nshe came into the world, she looks about for a suitable spot, where\r\nthe ground is not too hard, and digs a perpendicular burrow of some\r\ndepth, enlarging it at the bottom, and digging horizontally, so that\r\nthe general shape of the burrow somewhat resembles that of a boot. When\r\nthe burrow is completed, the insect flies off in search of food for\r\nits young, and presently returns, bearing with her a grub, which she\r\nclasps tightly under her chest, so that her wings may be at liberty.\r\nShe then takes the grub to the bottom of the tunnel, deposits an egg\r\nupon it, and if the grub be a small one, goes off to fetch another.\r\nWhen a sufficiency of food has been obtained, she covers up the grub\r\nand egg and leaves the latter to its fate. In due time it is hatched,\r\nand begins straightway to feed upon its unfortunate fellow-prisoner.\r\nWhen all the food is gone, it is old enough to assume the perfect form,\r\nand when it finally becomes a perfect insect, it makes its way into the\r\nopen air, and straightway looks out for a mate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAn European species of this genus, which is called _Scolia flavifrons_,\r\nis remarkable for the four large, round spots on the upper surface\r\nof the abdomen. This species always feeds its young on the grub of a\r\nbeetle, one of the lamellicorn group, and in this case the grub is so\r\nlarge that one is sufficient.\r\n\r\nIn the illustration, the left hand figure shows a section of the burrow\r\nof _Scolia Xantiana_, and exhibits the enlarged portion of the tunnel\r\nin which are placed the young Scolia and the unfortunate grub which has\r\nto serve it for food. The insect itself is seen in the centre.\r\n\r\nFor figures 3 and 4 the reader is referred to the heading \"Spiders.\"\r\n\r\nThere is another British insect which feeds its young with flies, and\r\nwhich catches them in a manner somewhat similar to that which has\r\nrecently been narrated when treating of the Mellinus. The insect in\r\nquestion is called _Oxybelus unuglumis_, and is a very pretty species.\r\nIts length is seldom much more than a quarter of an inch, and its\r\ncolour is black, with some silvery hair about the face, and with some\r\nspots and bands of white, more or less yellowish, upon the pointed\r\nabdomen. The male is usually smaller than the female, but compensates\r\nfor this want of size by his more brilliant colouring.\r\n\r\nMr. F. Smith has described to me the method employed by this insect in\r\ncatching flies. In the air it would not have a chance of success, and\r\nso it proceeds after a fashion very much like that which is adopted\r\nby the hunting-spider. Choosing some spot where flies are likely to\r\nsettle, such as a bare, sunny bank, the Oxybelus alights upon it and\r\nbegins to run about without any apparent motive. At first the flies\r\nare rather alarmed, but after a while they become accustomed to the\r\nrapid movements of their foe, and allow it to come nearer and nearer\r\nthe cause of its perambulations. As soon as it has succeeded in drawing\r\nwithin a few inches of a fly, the Oxybelus leaps upon it, just like the\r\nhunting spider on its prey, and flies off before the victim knows that\r\nan attack is even meditated.\r\n\r\nThe burrow of this species is made in hard white sand.\r\n\r\nSeveral species of the genus _Cerceris_ are noted, not only as\r\nburrowers, but for the exceeding variety of the food which they store\r\nin their dwellings. The most common species, _Cerceris arenaria_, makes\r\nits tunnel in hard, sandy spots, and is usually to be found about the\r\nmiddle of July and August. The length of this insect rather exceeds\r\nhalf an inch, and its colour is black, profusely spotted and barred\r\nwith yellow. It is rather slenderly made, and gives little external\r\nindications of the great strength which it possesses.\r\n\r\nThis insect prefers to stock its nest with weevils of different\r\nkinds--a most singular choice, when the hardness of the exterior\r\nis taken into consideration. The well-known nut-weevil (_Balaninus\r\nnucum_), with its hard, round body, and long mouth, is frequently taken\r\nby this species of Cerceris, and Mr. Smith further mentions that he\r\nhas captured it in the act of taking the weevil called _Otiorhynchus\r\nsulcatus_ to its nest.\r\n\r\nThis beetle is among the most noxious of our garden foes, and the more\r\nso because its ravages are unseen. In its larval state it infests the\r\nroots of many of our succulent plants and flowers, and has a habit of\r\neating away the plant just at the junction of the root and stem. Even\r\nflowers in pots are apt to be infested by this insect, and often die\r\nwithout the cause of their death being discovered. It is about half an\r\ninch in length, white, and is destitute of feet, their office being\r\nperformed by bundles of stiff hairs, which are dispersed round the body.\r\n\r\nIn its perfect state it is about the third of an inch in length, the\r\ncolour is black, covered with a coating of very fine and short grey\r\nhairs, and along its back are a number of short longitudinal grooves.\r\nFrom this latter circumstance it derives its name of \"_sulcatus_,\" or\r\ngrooved.\r\n\r\nThe exterior of this beetle is extremely hard, even exceptionally so\r\namong the hard-bodied weevils. It is extremely difficult to get a pin\r\nthrough the body, and the entomologist is often obliged to bore a hole\r\nwith a stout needle before the pin can be inserted. Yet, the Cerceris\r\nuses this insect as the food of its young, and stores them away in\r\nits burrow. That the young should eat them seems as impossible as if\r\na lobster or a box-tortoise had been inserted in their place. It is,\r\nhowever, thought by most practical entomologists that the shell of the\r\nweevil is softened by lying in the damp ground, and that as the young\r\nis not hatched for several days after the burrow is sealed up, the\r\nhard wing cases have time to soften.\r\n\r\nAnother species of the same genus, _Cerceris interrupta_, has the\r\ncurious habit of making its burrow in the hardest ground which it can\r\npenetrate, and is generally to be found in well used footpaths. This\r\nspecies also uses weevils for the food of its young, but prefers those\r\nsmall weevils which are classed under the genus _Apion_, and which are\r\nreadily known by their pear-shaped bodies and rather elongated heads.\r\n[There are about seventy species of _Apion_, so that the Cerceris has\r\nplenty of choice.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMason-Bees.\r\n\r\nIt would not be easy to find a more simple, and, at the same time,\r\ningenious specimen of insect architecture than the nests of those\r\nspecies of solitary bees which have been justly called mason-bees\r\n(_Megachile_, Latreille). Réaumur, who was struck by the analogies\r\nbetween the proceedings of insects and human arts, first gave to bees,\r\nwasps, and caterpillars those names which indicate the character of\r\ntheir labours; and which, though they may be considered a little\r\nfanciful, are at least calculated to arrest the attention. The nests\r\nof mason-bees are constructed of various materials; some with sand,\r\nsome with earth mixed with chalk, and some with a mixture of earthy\r\nsubstances and wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mason-Bee (_Anthophora retusa_).--Natural size.]\r\n\r\nOn the north-east wall of Greenwich Park, facing the road, and about\r\nfour feet from the ground, we discovered (J. R.), December 10th, 1828,\r\nthe nest of a mason-bee, formed in the perpendicular line of cement\r\nbetween two bricks. Externally there was an irregular cake of dry mud,\r\nprecisely as if a handful of wet road-stuff had been taken from a\r\ncart-rut and thrown against the wall; though, upon closer inspection,\r\nthe cake contained more small stones than usually occur in the mud of\r\nthe adjacent cart-ruts. We should in fact have passed it by without\r\nnotice had there not been a circular hole on one side of it, indicating\r\nthe perforation of some insect. This hole was found to be the orifice\r\nof a cell about an inch deep, exactly of the form and size of a lady's\r\nthimble, finely polished, and of the colour of plaster-of-paris, but\r\nstained in various places with yellow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Exterior Wall of Mason-Bee's Nest.]\r\n\r\nThis cell was empty; but, upon removing the cake of mud, we discovered\r\nanother cell, separated from the former by a partition about a quarter\r\nof an inch thick, and in it a living bee, from which the preceding\r\nfigure was drawn, and which, as we supposed, had just changed from the\r\npupa to the winged state, in consequence of the uncommon mildness of\r\nthe weather. The one which had occupied the adjacent cell had no doubt\r\nalready dug its way out of its prison, and would probably fall a victim\r\nto the first frost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cells of a Mason-Bee (_Anthophora retusa_).--One-third\r\nthe natural size.]\r\n\r\nOur nest contained only two cells--perhaps from there not being room\r\nbetween the bricks for more.\r\n\r\n[There are only four British species of this genus. One species, _A.\r\nacervorum_, seems perfectly indifferent whether it burrows into banks\r\nor into the mortar of old walls. If possible, the former locality seems\r\nto be the most favoured.\r\n\r\nThis species is notable for the many parasites who infect the\r\nhabitation and destroy the inmates. Perhaps the very worst and most\r\ndestructive of these parasites is the common earwig, which wreaks\r\nwholesale desolation in the nest. It creeps into the burrow, and if it\r\nfinds a store of pollen laid up for the young, it will eat the pollen.\r\nBut if the young grub be hatched it will eat the grub. If the inmate\r\nbe in the pupal state, or even if it be ready to emerge in its perfect\r\ncondition, the earwig will eat it.\r\n\r\nThere are two bees which are parasitic upon this unfortunate insect,\r\nboth belonging the genus _Melecta_.\r\n\r\nBut the most destructive of these parasites appears to be an insect\r\nwhich belongs to the great family of _Chalcididæ_. These insects are\r\nof the hymenopterous order, are of very minute dimensions, and of the\r\nmost brilliant colours. Indeed, if they were an inch or two in length,\r\ninstead of the eighth or twelfth of an inch, they would not suffer in\r\ncomparison with the most gorgeous inhabitants of tropical countries.\r\n\r\nTheir forms are most eccentric, some species having the abdomen small\r\nand round and set on a long footstalk, while others have that portion\r\nof the body placed so closely against the thorax, that the short\r\nfootstalk is scarcely visible. Others have certain joints of the legs\r\nso large that a single joint equals the entire abdomen. Some have\r\nthe ovipositor projecting boldly from the body, while others have it\r\ntucked up underneath, and others again have it quite short. But there\r\nis one point which distinguishes them all, namely, the almost veinless\r\ncharacter of the wings.\r\n\r\nSome of the _Chalcididæ_ are parasitic upon insects in their earliest\r\nstages, actually depositing their eggs in those of moths and\r\nbutterflies. Others are entirely parasitic upon parasites, laying\r\ntheir eggs in the aphidii, which are parasites of the aphis. Some\r\nof them haunt the galls, and contrive to make their young parasitic\r\nupon the immature cynipidæ which lie within the gall. The common\r\nsmall tortoise-shell butterfly is terribly infested with these little\r\ncreatures, and we have bred hundreds of the gem-like _Chalcididæ_ from\r\nthe larvæ and pupæ of that butterfly.\r\n\r\nOne of the _Chalcididæ_, belonging to the genus _Melittobia_, is a\r\nparasite upon the _Anthophora_; and the curious part of the proceeding\r\nis, that it finds there another parasite, which becomes developed in\r\nthe home of the bee: the _Melittobia_ feeds indiscriminately upon the\r\nbee and parasite.\r\n\r\nAlthough the _Melittobia_ does not make such wholesale destruction as\r\nis wrought by the earwig when it gets into a nest, it does more damage\r\nto the bee, on account of its great numbers. Some three or four females\r\nwill lay a great quantity of eggs within a nest, and from those eggs a\r\nhundred of the young will be developed. When the larvæ are fully grown,\r\nthey quit their hold of their prey, and fall to the bottom of the cell,\r\nwhere they lie until they have assumed the perfect form. They then\r\nburst forth, together with those of the bee that may have escaped their\r\nattacks.]\r\n\r\nAn interesting account is given by Réaumur of another mason-bee\r\n(_Megachile muraria_), not a native of Britain, selecting earthy sand,\r\ngrain by grain; her glueing a mass of these together with saliva, and\r\nbuilding with them her cells from the foundation. But the cells of\r\nthe Greenwich Park nest were apparently composed of the mortar of the\r\nbrick wall; though the external covering seems to have been constructed\r\nas Réaumur describes his nest, with the occasional addition of small\r\nstones.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of May, 1829, we discovered the mine from which all\r\nthe various species of mason-bees in the vicinity seemed to derive\r\nmaterials for their nests. (J. R.) It was a bank of brown clay, facing\r\nthe east, and close by the margin of the river Ravensbourn, at Lee,\r\nin Kent. The frequent resort of the bees to this spot attracted the\r\nattention of some workmen, who, deceived by their resemblance to\r\nwasps, pointed it out as a wasps' nest; though they were not a little\r\nsurprised to see so numerous a colony at this early season. As the\r\nbees had dug a hole in the bank, where they were incessantly entering\r\nand reappearing, we were of opinion that they were a peculiar sort of\r\nthe social earth-bees (_Bombi_). On approaching the spot, however, we\r\nremarked that the bees were not alarmed, and manifested none of the\r\nirritation usual in such cases, the consequence of jealous affection\r\nfor their young. This led us to observe their operations more minutely;\r\nand we soon discovered that on issuing from the hole each bee carried\r\nout in its mandibles a piece of clay. Still supposing that they\r\nwere social earth-bees, we concluded that they were busy excavating\r\na hollow for their nest, and carrying off the refuse to prevent\r\ndiscovery. The mouth of the hole was overhung, and partly concealed,\r\nby a large pebble. This we removed, and widened the entrance of the\r\nhole, intending to dig down and ascertain the state of the operations;\r\nbut we soon found that it was of small depth. The bees, being scared\r\naway, began scooping out clay from another hole about a yard distant\r\nfrom the first. Upon our withdrawing a few feet from the first hole,\r\nthey returned thither in preference, and continued assiduously digging\r\nand removing the clay. It became obvious, therefore, from their thus\r\nchanging place, that they were not constructing a nest, but merely\r\nquarrying for clay as a building material. By catching one of the bees\r\n(_Osmia bicornis_) when it was loaded with its burden, we ascertained\r\nthat the clay was not only carefully kneaded, but was also more moist\r\nthan the mass from which it had been taken. The bee, therefore, in\r\npreparing the pellet, which was nearly as large as a garden-pea, had\r\nmoistened it with its saliva, or some similar fluid, to render it, we\r\nmay suppose, more tenacious, and better fitted for building. The reason\r\nof their digging a hole, instead of taking clay indiscriminately from\r\nthe bank, appeared to be for the purpose of economizing their saliva,\r\nas the weather was dry, and the clay at the surface was parched and\r\nhard. It must have been this circumstance which induced them to prefer\r\ndigging a hole, as it were, in concert, though each of them had to\r\nbuild a separate nest.\r\n\r\nThe distance to which they carried the clay was probably considerable,\r\nas there was no wall near, in the direction they all flew towards, upon\r\nwhich they could build; and in the same direction also, it is worthy\r\nof remark, they could have procured much nearer the very same sort of\r\nclay. Whatever might be the cause of their preference, we could not\r\nbut admire their extraordinary industry. It did not require more than\r\nhalf a minute to knead one of the pellets of clay; and, from their\r\nfrequent returns, probably not more than five minutes to carry it to\r\nthe nest, and apply it where wanted. From the dryness of the weather,\r\nindeed, it was indispensable for them to work rapidly, otherwise the\r\nclay could not have been made to hold together. The extent of the whole\r\nlabour of forming a single nest may be imagined, if we estimate that\r\nit must take several hundred pellets of clay for its completion. If a\r\nbee work fourteen or fifteen hours a-day, therefore, carrying ten or\r\ntwelve pellets to its nest every hour, it will be able to finish the\r\nstructure in about two or three days; allowing some hours of extra time\r\nfor the more nice workmanship of the cells in which the eggs are to be\r\ndeposited, and the young grubs reared.\r\n\r\nThat the construction of such a nest is not a merely agreeable exercise\r\nto the mason-bee has been sufficiently proved by M. Du Hamel. He has\r\nobserved a bee (_Megachile muraria_) less careful to perform the\r\nnecessary labour for the protection of her offspring than those we\r\nhave described, but not less desirous of obtaining this protection,\r\nattempt to usurp the nest which another had formed. A fierce battle\r\nwas invariably the consequence of this attempt; for the true mistress\r\nwould never give place to the intruder. The motive for the injustice\r\nand the resistance was an indisposition to further labour. The trial of\r\nstrength was probably, sometimes, of as little use in establishing the\r\nright as it is amongst mankind; and the proper owner, exhausted by her\r\nefforts, had doubtless often to surrender to the dishonest usurper.\r\n\r\nThe account which Réaumur has given of the operations of this class\r\nof bees differs considerably from that which we have here detailed;\r\nfrom the species being different, or from his bees not having been able\r\nto procure moist clay. On the contrary, sand was the chief material\r\nused by the mason-bees (_Megachile muraria_); which they had the\r\npatience to select from the walks of a garden, and knead into a paste\r\nor mortar, adapted to their building. They had consequently to expend\r\na much greater quantity of saliva than our bees (_Osmia bicornis_),\r\nwhich worked with moist clay. Réaumur, indeed, ascertained that every\r\nindividual grain of sand is moistened previous to its being joined to\r\nthe pellet, in order to make it adhere more effectually. The tenacity\r\nof the mass is, besides, rendered stronger, he tells us, by adding a\r\nproportion of earth or garden-mould. In this manner, a ball of mortar\r\nis formed, about the size of a small shot, and carried off to the nest.\r\nWhen the structure of this is examined, it has all the appearance\r\nexternally of being composed of earth and small stones or gravel. The\r\nancients, who were by no means accurate naturalists, having observed\r\nbees carrying pellets of earth and small stones, supposed that they\r\nemployed these to add to their weight, in order to steady their flight\r\nwhen impeded by the wind.\r\n\r\nThe nests thus constructed appear to have been more durable edifices\r\nthan those which have fallen under our observation;--for Réaumur says\r\nthey were harder than many sorts of stone, and could scarcely be\r\npenetrated with a knife. Ours, on the contrary, do not seem harder\r\nthan a piece of sun-baked clay, and by no means so hard as brick. One\r\ncircumstance appeared inexplicable to Réaumur and his friend Du Hamel,\r\nwho studied the operations of these insects in concert. After taking a\r\nportion of sand from one part of the garden-walk, the bees usually took\r\nanother portion from a spot almost twenty and sometimes a hundred paces\r\noff, though the sand, so far as could be judged by close examination,\r\nwas precisely the same in the two places. We should be disposed to\r\nrefer this more to the restless character of the insect than to any\r\ndifference in the sand. We have observed a wasp paring the outside of\r\na plank, for materials to form its nest; and though the plank was as\r\nuniform in the qualities of its surface, nay, probably more so than the\r\nsand could be, the wasp fidgeted about, nibbling a fibre from one, and\r\na fibre from another portion, till enough was procured for one load. In\r\nthe same way, the whole tribe of wasps and bees flit restlessly from\r\nflower to flower, not unfrequently revisiting the same blossom, again\r\nand again, within a few seconds. It appears to us, indeed, to be far\r\nfrom improbable, that this very restlessness and irritability may be\r\none of the springs of their unceasing industry.\r\n\r\nBy observing, with some care, the bees which we found digging the clay,\r\nwe discovered one of them (_Osmia bicornis_) at work upon a nest, about\r\na gunshot from the bank. The place it had chosen was the inner wall of\r\na coal-house, facing the south-west, the brick-work of which was but\r\nroughly finished. In an upright interstice of half an inch in width,\r\nbetween two of the bricks, we found the little architect assiduously\r\nbuilding its walls. The bricklayer's mortar had either partly fallen\r\nout, or been removed by the bee, who had commenced building at the\r\nlower end, and did not build downwards, as the social wasps construct\r\ntheir cells.\r\n\r\nThe very different behaviour of the insect here, and at the quarry,\r\nstruck us as not a little remarkable. When digging and preparing the\r\nclay, our approach, however near, produced no alarm; the work went on\r\nas if we had been at a distance; and though we were standing close to\r\nthe hole, this did not scare away any of the bees upon their arrival\r\nto procure a fresh load. But if we stood near the nest, or even in the\r\nway by which the bee flew to it, she turned back or made a wide circuit\r\nimmediately, as if afraid to betray the site of her domicile. We even\r\nobserved her turning back, when we were so distant that it could not\r\nreasonably be supposed she was jealous of us; but probably she had\r\ndetected some prowling insect depredator, tracking her flight with\r\ndesigns upon her provision for her future progeny. We imagined we could\r\nperceive not a little art in her jealous caution, for she would alight\r\non the tiles as if to rest herself; and even when she had entered the\r\ncoal-house, she did not go directly to her nest, but again rested on a\r\nshelf, and at other times pretended to examine several crevices in the\r\nwall, at some distance from the nest. But when there was nothing to\r\nalarm her, she flew directly to the spot, and began eagerly to add to\r\nthe building.\r\n\r\nIt is in instances such as these, which exhibit the adaptation\r\nof instinct to circumstances, that our reason finds the greatest\r\ndifficulty in explaining the governing principle of the minds of the\r\ninferior animals. The mason-bee makes her nest by an invariable rule;\r\nthe model is in her mind, as it has been in the mind of her race from\r\ntheir first creation: they have learnt nothing by experience. But\r\nthe mode in which they accomplish this task varies according to the\r\nsituations in which they are placed. They appear to have a glimmering\r\nof reason, employed as an accessary and instrument of their instinct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cells of Mason-Bees, built, in the first and second\r\nfigures, by _Osmia bicornis_ between bricks, and in the third, by\r\n_Megachile muraria_ in the fluting of an old pilaster.--About half the\r\nnatural size.]\r\n\r\nThe structure, when finished, consisted of a wall of clay supported by\r\ntwo contiguous bricks, enclosing six chambers, within each of which\r\na mass of pollen, rather larger than a cherry-stone, was deposited,\r\ntogether with an egg, from which in due time a grub was hatched.\r\nContrary to what has been recorded by preceding naturalists with\r\nrespect to other mason-bees, we found the cells in this instance quite\r\nparallel and perpendicular; but it may also be remarked, that the bee\r\nitself was a species altogether different from the one which we have\r\ndescribed above as the _Anthophora retusa_, and agreed with the figure\r\nof the one we caught quarrying the clay--(_Osmia bicornis_).\r\n\r\n[In Mr. F. Smith's elaborate catalogue of the British hymenoptera there\r\nis a most interesting account of the habits of this insect, which is\r\nthe most abundant species of the genus, and is spread not only over the\r\nwhole of England, but over the continent, being found as far south as\r\nItaly and as far north as Lapland.\r\n\r\n\"In a hilly country, or at the sea-side, it chooses the sunny side of\r\ncliffs or sandy banks in which to form its burrows, but in cultivated\r\ndistricts, particularly if the soil be clayey, it selects a decayed\r\ntree, preferring the stump of an old willow. It lays up a store of\r\npollen and honey for the larvæ, which when full grown, spins a tough\r\ndark brown cocoon, in which they remain in the larval state until the\r\nautumn, when the majority change to pupæ, and soon arrive at their\r\nperfect condition. Many, however, pass the winter in the larva state.\r\nIn attempting to account for so remarkable a circumstance, all must\r\nbe conjecture, but it is not of unfrequent occurrence. This species\r\nfrequently makes its burrows in the mortar of old walls.\"\r\n\r\nAnother species (_Osmia bicolor_) sometimes makes its cells in very\r\npeculiar situations. When obliged to have recourse to its natural\r\npowers, it uses its limbs right well, attacks the hard sandy banks,\r\nand works at them with the greatest perseverance. But it will not work\r\none stroke where it can avoid the necessity, and in many cases, it\r\ncontrives to avoid work with much ingenuity.\r\n\r\nLying hidden under hedges, bushes, grass, and herbage, are sure to be\r\nshells of various snails, such as the common garden-snail, and the\r\nbanded-snail, whose diversified shell is the delight of children. These\r\nshells the bee thinks are as good as ready-made burrows, and she uses\r\nthem accordingly.\r\n\r\nShe goes to the end of the shell, carrying her materials with her, and\r\nthen builds a cell, and fills it with pollen and honey. Another cell\r\nis then made, and yet another, until the shell is nearly filled. As\r\nthe shell widens, the _Osmia_ places two cells side by side, and when\r\nthe insect has worked within a short distance of the mouth, she places\r\nthe cells horizontally, so as to fill up the space. There are several\r\nspecimens of these curious habitations in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nWhen the whole series of cells is completed, the bee closes up the\r\nentrance with little morsels of earth, bits of stick and little stones,\r\nall strongly glued together with some very adhesive substance.\r\n\r\nAnother species (_Osmia parietina_) has much simpler habits, and is\r\nmuch easier satisfied with a dwelling. This insect merely looks out for\r\na flattish stone lying on the ground, and crawls under it to see if\r\nthere is any hollow. If so, it attaches the cocoons to the stone and\r\nleaves them. On one stone, seen in the British Museum, no less than two\r\nhundred and thirty cocoons were placed, although the stone is only ten\r\ninches in length by six in width.\r\n\r\nThis insect is almost wholly confined to the north of England.]\r\n\r\nThere was one circumstance attending the proceedings of this mason-bee\r\nwhich struck us not a little, though we could not explain it to our own\r\nsatisfaction. Every time she left her nest for the purpose of procuring\r\na fresh supply of materials, she paid a regular visit to the blossoms\r\nof a lilac-tree which grew near. Had these blossoms afforded a supply\r\nof pollen, with which she could have replenished her cells, we could\r\nhave easily understood her design; but the pollen of the lilac is not\r\nsuitable for this purpose, and that she had never used it was proved\r\nby all the pollen in the cells being yellow, whereas that of the lilac\r\nis of the same pale purple colour as the flowers. Besides, she did not\r\nreturn immediately from the lilac-tree to the building, but always\r\nwent for a load of clay. There seemed to us, therefore, to be only\r\ntwo ways to explain the circumstance:--she must either have applied\r\nto the lilac-blossoms to obtain a refreshment of honey, or to procure\r\nglutinous materials to mix with the clay.\r\n\r\nWhen employed upon the building itself, the bee exhibited the restless\r\ndisposition peculiar to most hymenopterous[P] insects; for she did not\r\ngo on with one particular portion of her wall, but ran about from place\r\nto place every time she came to work. At first, when we saw her running\r\nfrom the bottom to the top of her building, we naturally imagined\r\nthat she went up for some of the bricklayer's mortar to mix with her\r\nown materials; but upon minutely examining the walls afterwards, no\r\nlime could be discovered in their structure similar to that which was\r\napparent in the nest found in the wall of Greenwich Park.\r\n\r\nRéaumur mentions another sort of mason-bee, which selects a small\r\ncavity in a stone, in which she forms her nest of garden-mould\r\nmoistened with gluten, and afterwards closes the whole with the same\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cells of _Chalicodoma_.]\r\n\r\n[In the accompanying illustration is shown a series of cells which are\r\nconstructed by an insect which is closely related to the rose-cutter\r\nbee of our own country, to which it bears a close resemblance.\r\n\r\nIt is a native of South Africa, and its name is _Chalicodoma\r\ncoelocerus_. The insect is about half an inch in length, and the colour\r\nof the head and body is black, that of the abdomen being brick red.\r\n\r\nThe nest is made of mud, which is collected by the patient insect and\r\nstuck against walls, trunks of trees, and similar localities. In this\r\nlump of mud the insect excavates a small number of burrows, each of\r\nwhich contains several cells. If the reader will refer to the central\r\nburrow, he will see that it is divided into three cells. The specimen\r\nfrom which this drawing is taken may be seen in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nThere is another South African insect which makes its mud nest, and\r\nfastens it against trees and walls. This is called _Synagris calida_,\r\nand its colour is almost dingy black, the only exception being the red\r\ntip to the abdomen. The holes seen in the engraving are the apertures\r\nthrough which the young brood has escaped into the world. The nest is\r\nrepresented of half its natural size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nMining-Bees.\r\n\r\nA very small sort of bees (_Andrenæ_), many of them not larger than a\r\nhouse-fly, dig in the ground tubular galleries little wider than the\r\ndiameter of their own bodies. Samouelle says, that all of them seem\r\nto prefer a southern aspect; but we have found them in banks facing\r\nthe east, and even the north. Immediately above the spot where we have\r\ndescribed the mason-bees quarrying the clay, we observed several holes,\r\nabout the diameter of the stalk of a tobacco-pipe, into which those\r\nlittle bees were seen passing. The clay here was very hard; and on\r\npassing a straw into the hole as a director, and digging down for six\r\nor eight inches, a very smooth circular gallery was found, terminating\r\nin a thimble-shaped horizontal chamber, almost at right angles to the\r\nentrance and nearly twice as wide. In this chamber there was a ball\r\nof bright yellow pollen, as round as a garden pea, and rather larger,\r\nupon which a small white grub was feeding; and to which the mother\r\nbee had been adding, as she had just entered a minute before with\r\nher thighs loaded with pollen. That it was not the male, the load of\r\npollen determined; for the male has no apparatus for collecting or\r\ntransporting it. The whole labour of digging the nest and providing\r\nfood for the young is performed by the female. The females of the\r\nsolitary bees have no assistance in their tasks. The males are idle;\r\nand the females are unprovided with labourers, such as the queens of\r\nthe hive command.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cell of Mining-Bee (_Andrena_).--About half the natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nRéaumur mentions that the bees of this sort, whose operations he\r\nhad observed, piled up at the entrance of their galleries the earth\r\nwhich they had scooped out from the interior; and when the grub was\r\nhatched, and properly provided with food, the earth was again employed\r\nto close up the passage, in order to prevent the intrusion of ants,\r\nichneumon-flies, or other depredators. In those which we have observed,\r\nthis was not the case; but every species differs from another in some\r\nlittle peculiarity, though they agree in the general principles of\r\ntheir operations.\r\n\r\n[The genus Andrena is an exceedingly large one, nearly seventy species\r\nbeing acknowledged in England alone. They choose various situations\r\nfor their nest; a very favourite situation is a hard-trodden pathway;\r\ninto this the bees burrow for some six or seven inches, and often drive\r\ntheir tunnels to a depth of ten inches. Digging up these habitations\r\nis not a very easy task, because the tunnel does not run straight, but\r\nturns aside when a stone or any similar obstacle comes in the way, and\r\nin getting out the stone the burrow is mostly broken. The only method\r\nof digging out the nest successfully is either by pushing a small twig\r\nup the hole, and using it as a guide, or by filling the entire hole\r\nwith cotton wool, so as to prevent the earth from falling in.\r\n\r\nThe commonest species is _Andrena albicans_. Its length is rather\r\nless than half an inch, and its colour is black, with a thick coating\r\nof rich red hair on the upper part of the thorax. This species is\r\nplentiful on the continent, and is found as far south as Italy. But it\r\nis equally capable of enduring great cold, as it has been captured in\r\nthe Arctic regions. Sometimes the bee will not trouble itself to make a\r\nnumber of separate burrows, but will drive short supplementary tunnels\r\nfrom the side of the first burrow, so that they all open into one\r\ncommon entrance.\r\n\r\nThe Andrenæ are remarkable for the parasites with which they are\r\ninfested, the most curious of which is that tiny strepsipterous insect\r\ncalled the Stylops.\r\n\r\nOne of the Andrenæ, called _Colletes Daviesana_, is remarkable for the\r\ncharacter of its burrow. Like many of the insects which have already\r\nbeen described, it seems indifferent whether it burrows in sand-banks\r\nor into the mortar of walls, provided that in the latter case the\r\nmortar is soft and friable.\r\n\r\nThe insect burrows a hole which is very deep in proportion to its size,\r\nthe little bee being only the third of an inch in length, and the\r\nburrows some eight or ten inches in depth. When the mother _Colletes_\r\nhas finished her tunnel, she lines the end of it with a thin kind of\r\nmembrane, which has been well compared by Mr. F. Smith to goldbeater's\r\nskin. This lining is intended to enable the bee to store honey in the\r\ncell, as, if there were no such protection, the honey would soak in the\r\nground and be lost.\r\n\r\nHaving stored up enough food for a single offspring, she shuts it off\r\nby a partition of the same membranous substance as the lining. Her next\r\ncare is to make a thimble-like cup at the end, so as to have a double\r\nlining where the honey is to come, and then she puts a fresh supply in\r\nthe new cell. This cell is then closed, and the bee proceeds with her\r\nwork until she has made from six to eight cells in a single burrow.\r\nThis insect suffers terribly from the depredations of the earwig, which\r\ncompletely empties the burrow both of food and of inhabitants. The\r\ncolour of the insect is black, with a little reddish down on the upper\r\npart of the thorax, and some white on the legs. The abdomen is shining\r\nblack, but each segment has a very narrow band of reddish down on its\r\nedge.\r\n\r\nIn 1850, Mr. F. Smith, to whose works such constant reference has been\r\nmade, undertook the study of a genus of mining-bees belonging to this\r\nfamily. The species which he chiefly watched is _Halictus morio_, and\r\nhis observations are peculiarly valuable, as showing the wonderful\r\nmanner in which the economy of the race is managed. It is known that in\r\nthese and many other insects, the pregnant females pass the winter in\r\na state of hibernation, and begin to work in the following spring, and\r\nthat therefore some arrangement must be needful that a supply of such\r\nqueens should be kept up.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith found the case to stand thus. Early in April, the females\r\nappeared abundantly, and could be seen until June, but not a single\r\nmale was to be found. During June and July, almost all the _Halicti_\r\nhad disappeared, the reason being, that the queens had made their\r\nburrows, laid their eggs, stocked their cells, and then died, the\r\nduties of their life having been fulfilled. In the middle of August,\r\nthe males began to appear, and in September the females of the first\r\nbrood came out. They immediately set to work at their burrows, and\r\nlaid their eggs. The ground, thoroughly warmed by the summer sun, soon\r\nhastened the young through their changes, and in an incredibly short\r\ntime the insects of the second brood made their appearance. The females\r\nof this brood meet their mates, and then hide themselves until the\r\nfollowing spring.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of Andrenæ, several tunnels are often made with one\r\ncommon entrance. The insect is very small, scarcely exceeding the\r\nsixth of an inch in length. The head and thorax are a dark green, the\r\nabdomen is white, and the legs are covered with silvery hairs. It is a\r\nplentiful insect, and is found haunting the holes of old walls.\r\n\r\nPassing to another family of British mining-bees, we come to one\r\nspecies that is remarkable not only for its form, but for its economy.\r\nThis is the _Eucera longicornis_, the only known species that inhabits\r\nEngland. In form it is chiefly remarkable from the fact that the\r\nantennæ of the male are as long as the entire body. The pupa of this\r\ninsect is enclosed in a thin membrane, and when the male insect is\r\nabout to emerge from its pupal shell, it has recourse to a rather\r\ncurious expedient. At the base of the first joint of the front feet\r\nthere is a bold notch. When the insect wishes to remove the thin\r\nmembranous pellicle which envelopes the antennæ, it lays these organs\r\nin the notch, draws them through, and thus easily strips off the\r\npellicle. The antennæ are most beautifully formed, the surface of each\r\njoint being marked with an elaborate pattern like net-work, so that\r\nthey form beautiful objects for the microscope.\r\n\r\nThe soil preferred by the _Eucera_ is of a clayey nature. When it has\r\ncompleted the burrow, it presses the soil at the extremity with all its\r\nmight, and smooths it so carefully that the burrow becomes capable of\r\nholding honey without needing any lining. The insect is generally found\r\nabout the end of May or beginning of June, and in some places is found\r\nin great numbers. The ground colour of the insect is black, but the\r\nbody is covered with a coating of short dun hairs. The length rather\r\nexceeds half an inch.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER III._\r\n\r\nCARPENTER-BEES; CARPENTER-WASPS; UPHOLSTERER-BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCarpenter-Bees.\r\n\r\nAmong the solitary bees are several British species, which come under\r\nthat class called carpenter-bees by M. Réaumur, from the circumstance\r\nof their working in wood, as the mason-bees work in stone. We have\r\nfrequently witnessed the operations of these ingenious little workers,\r\nwho are particularly partial to posts, palings, and the wood-work of\r\nhouses which has become soft by beginning to decay. Wood actually\r\ndecayed, or affected by dry-rot, they seem to reject as unfit for their\r\npurposes; but they make no objections to any hole previously drilled,\r\nprovided it be not too large; and, like the mason-bees, they not\r\nunfrequently take possession of an old nest, a few repairs being all\r\nthat in this case is necessary.\r\n\r\nWhen a new nest is to be constructed, the bee proceeds to chisel\r\nsufficient space for it out of the wood with her jaws. We say _her_,\r\nbecause the task in this instance, as in most others of solitary bees\r\nand wasps, devolves solely upon the female, the male taking no concern\r\nin the affair, and probably being altogether ignorant that such a work\r\nis going forward. It is, at least, certain that the male is never\r\nseen giving his assistance, and he seldom, if ever, approaches the\r\nneighbourhood. The female carpenter-bee has a task to perform no less\r\narduous than the mason-bee; for though the wood may be tolerably soft,\r\nshe can only cut out a very small portion at a time. The successive\r\nportions which she gnaws off may be readily ascertained by an observer,\r\nas she carries them away from the place. In giving the history of a\r\nmason-wasp (_Odynerus_), at page 22, we remarked the care with which\r\nshe carried to a distance little fragments of brick, which she\r\ndetached in the progress of excavation. We have recently watched a\r\nprecisely similar procedure in the instance of a carpenter-bee forming\r\na cell in a wooden post. (J. R.) The only difference was, that the bee\r\ndid not fly so far away with her fragments of wood as the wasp did; but\r\nshe varied the direction of her flight every time: and we could observe\r\nthat, after dropping, the chip of wood which she had carried off, she\r\ndid not return in a direct line to her nest, but made a circuit of some\r\nextent before wheeling round to go back.\r\n\r\nOn observing the proceedings of this carpenter-bee next day, we found\r\nher coming in with balls of pollen on her thighs; and on tracing her\r\nfrom the nest into the adjacent garden, we saw her visiting every\r\nflower which was likely to yield her a supply of pollen for her future\r\nprogeny. This was not all; we subsequently saw her taking the direction\r\nof the clay quarry frequented by the mason-bees, as we have mentioned\r\nin page 41, where we recognised her loading herself with a pellet of\r\nclay, and carrying it into her cell in the wooden post. We observed\r\nher alternating this labour for several days, at one time carrying\r\nclay, and at another pollen; till at length she completed her task, and\r\nclosed the entrance with a barricade of clay, to prevent the intrusion\r\nof any insectivorous depredator, who might make prey of her young; or\r\nof some prying parasite, who might introduce its own eggs into the nest\r\nshe had taken so much trouble to construct.\r\n\r\nSome days after it was finished, we cut into the post, and exposed this\r\nnest to view. It consisted of six cells of a somewhat square shape, the\r\nwood forming the lateral walls; and each was separated from the one\r\nadjacent by a partition of clay, of the thickness of a playing card.\r\nThe wood was not lined with any extraneous substance, but was worked as\r\nsmooth as if it had been chiseled by a joiner. There were five cells,\r\narranged in a very singular manner--two being almost horizontal, two\r\nperpendicular, and one oblique.\r\n\r\nThe depth to which the wood was excavated in this instance was\r\nconsiderably less than what we have observed in other species which dig\r\nperpendicular galleries several inches deep in posts and garden-seats;\r\nand they are inferior in ingenuity to the carpentry of a bee described\r\nby Réaumur (_Xylocopa violacea_), which has not been ascertained to be\r\na native of Britain, though a single indigenous species of the genus\r\nhas been doubtingly mentioned, and is figured by Kirby and Spence, in\r\ntheir valuable 'Monographia.' If it ever be found here, its large size\r\nand beautiful violet-coloured wings will render mistakes impossible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cells of Carpenter-Bees, excavated in an old post.\r\n\r\nIn fig. A the cells contain the young grubs; in fig. B the cells are\r\nempty. Both figures are shown in section, and about half their natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nThe violet carpenter-bee usually selects an upright piece of wood,\r\ninto which she bores obliquely for about an inch; and then, changing\r\nthe direction, works perpendicularly, and parallel to the sides of\r\nthe wood, from twelve or fifteen inches, and half an inch in breadth.\r\nSometimes the bee is contented with one or two of these excavations; at\r\nother times, when the wood is adapted to it, she scoops out three or\r\nfour--a task which sometimes requires several weeks of incessant labour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A represents a part of an espalier prop, tunnelled in\r\nseveral places by the violet Carpenter-Bee: the stick is split, and\r\nshows the nests and passages by which they are approached.

E, Carpenter-Bee (_Xylocopa violacea_). F,\r\nTeeth of the Carpenter-Bee, greatly magnified; _a_, the upper side;\r\n_b_, the lower side.]\r\n\r\nThe tunnel in the wood, however, is only one part of the work; for\r\nthe little architect has afterwards to divide the whole into cells,\r\nsomewhat less than an inch in depth. It is necessary, for the proper\r\ngrowth of her progeny, that each should be separated from the other,\r\nand be provided with adequate food. She knows, most exactly, the\r\nquantity of food which each grub will require during its growth; and\r\nshe therefore does not hesitate to cut it off from any additional\r\nsupply. In constructing her cells, she does not employ clay, like the\r\nbee which we have mentioned above, but the sawdust, if we may call\r\nit so, which she has collected in gnawing out the gallery. It would\r\nnot, therefore, have suited her design to scatter this about, as our\r\ncarpenter-bee did. The violet-bee, on the contrary, collects her\r\ngnawings into a little store-heap for future use, at a short distance\r\nfrom her nest. She proceeds thus:--At the bottom of her excavation she\r\ndeposits an egg, and over it fills a space nearly an inch high with\r\nthe pollen of flowers, made into a paste with honey. She then covers\r\nthis over with a ceiling composed of cemented sawdust, which also\r\nserves for the floor of the next chamber above it. For this purpose she\r\ncements round a wall a ring of wood-chips taken from her store-heap;\r\nand within this ring forms another, gradually contracting the diameter\r\ntill she has constructed a circular plate, about the thickness of\r\na crown-piece, and of considerable hardness. This plate of course\r\nexhibits concentric circles, somewhat similar to the annual circles\r\nin the cross section of a tree. In the same manner she proceeds till\r\nshe has completed ten or twelve cells; and then she closes the main\r\nentrance with a barrier of similar materials.\r\n\r\nLet us compare the progress of this little joiner with a human\r\nartisan--one who has been long practised in his trade, and has the most\r\nperfect and complicated tools for his assistance. The bee has learnt\r\nnothing by practice; she makes her nest but once in her life, but it is\r\nthen as complete and finished as if she had made a thousand. She has\r\nno pattern before her--but the Architect of all things has impressed a\r\nplan upon her mind, which she can realize without scale or compasses.\r\nHer two sharp teeth are the only tools with which she is provided for\r\nher laborious work; and yet she bores a tunnel, twelve times the length\r\nof her own body, with greater ease than the workman who bores into the\r\nearth for water, with his apparatus of augurs adapted to every soil.\r\nHer tunnel is clean and regular; she leaves no chips at the bottom,\r\nfor she is provident of her materials. Further, she has an exquisite\r\npiece of joinery to perform when her ruder labour is accomplished. The\r\npatient bee works her rings from the circumference to the centre, and\r\nshe produces a shelf, united with such care with her natural glue, that\r\na number of fragments are as solid as one piece.\r\n\r\nThe violet carpenter-bee, as may be expected, occupies several weeks\r\nin these complicated labours; and during that period she is gradually\r\ndepositing her eggs, each of which is successively to become a grub,\r\na pupa, and a perfect bee. It is obvious, therefore, as she does not\r\nlay all her eggs in the same place--as each is separated from the\r\nother by a laborious process--that the egg which is first laid will be\r\nthe earliest hatched; and that the first perfect insect, being older\r\nthan its fellows in the same tunnel, will strive to make its escape\r\nsooner, and so on of the rest. The careful mother provides for this\r\ncontingency. She makes a lateral opening at the bottom of the cells;\r\nfor the teeth of the young bees would not be strong enough to pierce\r\nthe outer wood, though they can remove the cemented rings of sawdust in\r\nthe interior. Réaumur observed these holes, in several cases; and he\r\nfurther noticed another external opening opposite to the middle cell,\r\nwhich he supposed was formed, in the first instance, to shorten the\r\ndistance for the removal of the fragments of wood in the lower half of\r\nthe building.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat bees of similar habits, if not the same species as the violet-bee,\r\nare indigenous to this country, is proved by Grew, who mentions, in his\r\n'Rarities of Gresham College,' having found a series of such cells in\r\nthe middle of the pith of an elder branch, in which they were placed\r\nlengthwise, one after another, with a thin boundary between each. As he\r\ndoes not, however, tell us that he was acquainted with the insect which\r\nconstructed these, it might as probably be allied to the _Ceratina\r\nalbilabris_, of which Spinola has given so interesting an account in\r\nthe 'Annales du Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle' (x. 236). This noble and\r\nlearned naturalist tells us, that one evening he perceived a female\r\nceratina alight on the branch of a bramble, partly withered, and of\r\nwhich the extremity had been broken; and, after resting a moment,\r\nsuddenly disappear. On detaching the branch, he found that it was\r\nperforated, and that the insect was in the very act of excavating a\r\nnidus for her eggs. He forthwith gathered a bundle of branches, both\r\nof the bramble and the wild-rose, similarly perforated, and took them\r\nhome to examine them at leisure. Upon inspection, he found that the\r\nnests were furnished like those of the same tribe, with balls of pollen\r\nkneaded with honey, as a provision for the grubs.\r\n\r\nThe female ceratina selects a branch of the bramble or wild-rose which\r\nhas been accidentally broken, and digs into the pith only, leaving the\r\nwood and bark untouched. Her mandibles, indeed, are not adapted for\r\ngnawing wood; and, accordingly, he found instances in which she could\r\nnot finish her nest in branches of the wild-rose, where the pith was\r\nnot of sufficient diameter.\r\n\r\nThe insect usually makes her perforation a foot in depth, and divides\r\nthis into eight, nine, or even twelve cells, each about five lines\r\nlong, and separated by partitions formed by the gnawings of the pith,\r\ncemented by honey, or some similar glutinous fluid, much in the same\r\nmanner with the _Xylocopa violacea_, which we have already described.\r\n\r\n[This species is probably _Ceratina cærulea_, as the second species,\r\n_C. albilabris_, seems to have little claim to be considered as a\r\nBritish insect. It is plentiful in spots where it resides, but is very\r\nlocal. It can best be found by collecting all the specimens of bramble\r\nbranches that have holes bored into the pith.\r\n\r\nMr. F. Smith says of this tiny bee, \"Some years ago I observed a small\r\nbee most industriously employed in excavating a dead bramble stick. My\r\nattention was directed to the circumstance from observing some of the\r\nfallen pieces of pith on the ground immediately beneath. Occasionally\r\nfresh quantities of dust were pushed out. At length, the little\r\ncreature came out of the stick as if to rest, and after sunning itself\r\nfor a few minutes, it re-entered, and again commenced its labours.\r\nLater in the day, after stopping up the entrance, I cut off the branch\r\nand found in it a male and female ceratina.\"\r\n\r\nThe ceratina is only the sixth of an inch in length, and is deep\r\nshining blue in colour.\r\n\r\nThere are many other species of British bees which frequent the stems\r\nof bramble and other trees. One of them is known as _Prosopis signata_.\r\nThe cells made by the bees of this genus are lined with a membrane, and\r\nare stocked with liquid honey. Some species will not take the trouble\r\nof boring a tunnel for themselves, but will make use of hollow stones,\r\nor similar localities, and place in them the silk-covered cocoons.\r\n\r\nThere are species of that versatile genus _Osmia_ (_O. leucomelana_),\r\nin the habit of burrowing into dead bramble branches. The mother\r\ninsect bores a hole some six inches in length, throwing the pieces of\r\npith away, and then, depositing at the bottom an egg and a supply of\r\nfood, she forms a cell by fixing across the burrow a stopper made of\r\nmasticated leaves.\r\n\r\nThe stopper retains its place firmly, because the bee does not eat\r\naway the whole of the pith, but alternately widens and contracts the\r\ndiameter of the burrow, each contracted portion being the termination\r\nof a cell. The perfect insect appears in the early summer of the\r\nfollowing year.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCarpenter-Wasps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A, B, represent sections of old wooden posts, with\r\nthe cells of the Carpenter-Wasp. In fig. A the young grubs are shown\r\nfeeding on the insects placed there for their support by the parent\r\nwasp. The cells in fig. B contain cocoons. C, Carpenter-Wasp, natural\r\nsize. D, cocoon of a Carpenter-Wasp, composed of sawdust and wings of\r\ninsects.]\r\n\r\nAs there are mason-wasps similar in economy to mason-bees, so are there\r\nsolitary carpenter-wasps which dig galleries in timber, and partition\r\nthem out into several cells by means of the gnawings of the wood which\r\nthey have detached. This sort of wasp is of the genus _Eumenes_. The\r\nwood selected is generally such as is soft, or in a state of decay; and\r\nthe hole which is dug in it is much less neat and regular than that of\r\nthe carpenter-bees, while the division of the chambers is nothing more\r\nthan the rubbish produced during the excavation.\r\n\r\nThe provision which is made for the grub consists of flies or gnats\r\npiled into the chamber, but without the nice order remarkable in\r\nthe spiral columns of green caterpillars provided by the mason-wasp\r\n(_Odynerus murarius_). The most remarkable circumstance is, that in\r\nsome of the species, when the grub is about to go into the pupa state,\r\nit spins a case (a cocoon), into which it interweaves the wings of the\r\nflies whose bodies it has previously devoured. In other species, the\r\ngnawings of the wood are employed in a similar manner.\r\n\r\n[Some of the solitary wasps are also carpenters, and the genus _Crabro_\r\nhas several species which are classed under this head. There is, for\r\nexample, _Crabro clavipes_, a little black insect with red and black\r\nabdomen, that burrows into dead bramble sticks, boring out the pith,\r\nand forming a series of cells in the narrow tube thus made. Sometimes\r\nthis insect bores into decaying wood, but its general home is the\r\nbramble-stick. The same habits are common to several other British\r\nspecies of this genus, and the reader will find that old, decaying\r\nwillow trees are chiefly visited by these pretty little insects. Their\r\nstore of food, which they lay up for their young, mostly consists of\r\ndipterous insects, and various species of gnats are used for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nAnother of the carpenter-wasps (_Pemphredon lugubris_) is really a\r\nuseful insect. It makes its burrows in posts, rails, and similar\r\nlocalities, and provides its future young with a large stock of\r\naphides. It has been seen to settle on a rose-bush, scrape off the\r\nbranches a number of aphides, form them into a ball, and carry them off\r\nbetween its head and front legs.\r\n\r\nThe colour of this insect is dull black, from which circumstance it\r\nderives its name of _lugubris._ The head is large, and squared, and the\r\nabdomen is attached to the thorax by a large footstalk. Its length is\r\nabout half an inch. It is a very common insect, and is believed to be\r\nthe only British representation of its genus.\r\n\r\nSeveral species do not take the trouble to form a burrow for\r\nthemselves, but content themselves with building in holes ready made\r\nfor them. Straws are favourite resorts of such insects, and in thatched\r\nbuildings the straws of the roof are often filled with their cells.\r\n\r\nOne of these insects is a very little species, barely a quarter of an\r\ninch in length. Its colour is black, with some silver white hair on\r\nthe face, and the legs are paler than the body. The abdomen has a long\r\nfootstalk. Its scientific name is _Psen pallipes_. Like the insect\r\nwhich has just been described, it provisions its young with aphides.]\r\n\r\n\r\nUpholsterer-Bees.\r\n\r\nIn another part of this volume we shall see how certain caterpillars\r\nconstruct abodes for themselves, by cutting off portions of the\r\nleaves or bark of plants, and uniting them by means of silk into a\r\nuniform and compact texture; but this scarcely appears so wonderful\r\nas the prospective labours of some species of bees for the lodgment\r\nof their progeny. We allude to the solitary bees, known by the name\r\nof the leaf-cutting bees, but which may be denominated more generally\r\n_upholsterer-bees_, as there are some of them which use other materials\r\nbeside leaves.\r\n\r\nOne species of our little upholsterers has been called the poppy-bee\r\n(_Osmia papaveris_, Latr.), from its selecting the scarlet petals of\r\nthe poppy as tapestry for its cells. Kirby and Spence express their\r\ndoubts whether it is indigenous to this country: we are almost certain\r\nthat we have seen the nests in Scotland. (J. R.) At Largs, in Ayrshire,\r\na beautiful sea-bathing village on the Firth of Clyde, in July, 1814,\r\nwe found in a footpath a great number of the cylindrical perforations\r\nof the poppy-bee. [In his catalogue of British Hymenoptera, Mr. F.\r\nSmith makes the following remarks with regard to this insect. \"The\r\npoppy-bee, _Anthocopa papaveris_, is closely allied to this genus\r\n(_Osmia_), and may indeed be placed before it as a connecting link\r\nwith the _Osmia_. This interesting insect (_l'abeille Tapissiere_),\r\nof Réaumur, has been supposed to inhabit this country, specimens\r\nhaving been placed in the collection at the British Museum. But it was\r\nwith much regret that I discovered, when engaged upon the catalogue\r\nof British bees for the Museum, and had occasion to examine each\r\nindividual specimen with care, that in the first place there was no\r\nsatisfactory evidence of the locality, and that in the next place, all\r\nthe males associated with the series were those of _Osmia adunca_, of\r\nPanzear.\" For these reasons, this species has been excluded from the\r\nlist of British bees.] Réaumur remarked that the cells of this bee\r\nwhich he found at Bercy, were situated in a northern exposure, contrary\r\nto what he had remarked in the mason-bee, which prefers the south. The\r\ncells at Largs, however, were on an elevated bank, facing the south,\r\nnear Sir Thomas Brisbane's observatory. With respect to exposure,\r\nindeed, no certain rule seems applicable; for the nests of mason-bees\r\nwhich we found on the wall of Greenwich Park faced the north-east, and\r\nwe have often found carpenter-bees make choice of a similar situation.\r\nIn one instance, we found carpenter-bees working indifferently on the\r\nnorth-east and south-west side of the same post.\r\n\r\nAs we did not perceive any heaps of earth near the holes at Largs,\r\nwe concluded that it must either have been carried off piecemeal\r\nwhen they were dug, or that they were old holes re-occupied (a\r\ncircumstance common with bees), and that the rubbish had been trodden\r\ndown by passengers. Réaumur, who so minutely describes the subsequent\r\noperations of the bee, says nothing respecting its excavations. One\r\nof these holes is about three inches deep, gradually widening as it\r\ndescends, till it assumes the form of a small Florence flask. The\r\ninterior of this is rendered smooth, uniform, and polished, in order\r\nto adapt it to the tapestry with which it is intended to be hung, and\r\nwhich is the next step in the process.\r\n\r\nThe material used for tapestry by the insect upholsterer is supplied\r\nby the flower-leaves of the scarlet field-poppy, from which she\r\nsuccessively cuts off small pieces of an oval shape, seizes them\r\nbetween her legs, and conveys them to the nest. She begins her work at\r\nthe bottom, which she overlays with three or four leaves in thickness,\r\nand the sides have never less than two. When she finds that the piece\r\nshe has brought is too large to fit the place intended, she cuts off\r\nwhat is superfluous, and carries away the shreds. By cutting the\r\nfresh petal of a poppy with a pair of scissors, we may perceive the\r\ndifficulty of keeping the piece free from wrinkles and shrivelling;\r\nbut the bee knows how to spread the pieces which she uses as smooth as\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nWhen she has in this manner hung the little chamber all around with\r\nthis splendid scarlet tapestry, of which she is not sparing, but\r\nextends it even beyond the entrance, she then fills it with the pollen\r\nof flowers mixed with honey, to the height of about half an inch. In\r\nthis magazine of provisions for her future progeny she lays an egg, and\r\nover it folds down the tapestry of poppy-petals from above. The upper\r\npart is then filled in with earth; but Latreille says he has observed\r\nmore than one cell constructed in a single excavation. This may account\r\nfor Réaumur's describing them as sometimes seven inches deep; a\r\ncircumstance which Latreille, however, thinks very surprising.\r\n\r\nIt will, perhaps, be impossible ever to ascertain, beyond a doubt,\r\nwhether the tapestry-bee is led to select the brilliant petals of the\r\npoppy from their colour, or from any other quality they may possess, of\r\nsoftness or of warmth, for instance. Réaumur thinks that the largeness,\r\nunited with the flexibility of the poppy-leaves, determines her\r\nchoice. Yet it is not improbable that her eye may be gratified by the\r\nappearance of her nest; that she may possess a feeling of the beautiful\r\nin colour, and may look with complacency upon the delicate hangings\r\nof the apartment which she destines for her offspring. Why should not\r\nan insect be supposed to have a glimmering of the value of ornament?\r\nHow can we pronounce, from our limited notion of the mode in which the\r\ninferior animals think and act, that their gratifications are wholly\r\nbounded by the positive utility of the objects which surround them? Why\r\ndoes a dog howl at the sound of a bugle, but because it offends his\r\norgan of hearing?--and why, therefore, may not a bee feel gladness in\r\nthe brilliant hues of her scarlet drapery, because they are grateful to\r\nher organs of sight? All these little creatures work, probably, with\r\nmore neatness and finish than is absolutely essential for comfort; and\r\nthis circumstance alone would imply that they have something of taste\r\nto exhibit, which produces to them a pleasurable emotion.\r\n\r\nThe tapestry-bee is, however, content with ornamenting the interior\r\nonly of the nest which she forms for her progeny. She does not\r\nmisplace her embellishments with the error of some human artists. She\r\ndesires security as well as elegance; and, therefore, she leaves no\r\nexternal traces of her operations. Hers is not a mansion rich with\r\ncolumns and friezes without, but cold and unfurnished within, like the\r\ndesolate palaces of Venice. She covers her tapestry quite round with\r\nthe common earth; and leaves her eggs enclosed in their poppy-case\r\nwith a certainty that the outward show of her labours will attract no\r\nplunderer.\r\n\r\nThe poppy-bee may be known by its being rather more than a third of\r\nan inch long, of a black colour, studded on the head and back with\r\nreddish-grey hairs; the belly being grey and silky, and the rings\r\nmargined with grey above, the second and third having an impressed\r\ntransversal line.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA species of solitary bee (_Anthidium manicatum_, Fabricius), by no\r\nmeans uncommon with us, forms a nest of a peculiarly interesting\r\nstructure. Kirby and Spence say, that it does not excavate holes, but\r\nmakes choice of the cavities of old trees, key-holes, and similar\r\nlocalities; yet it is highly probable, we think, that it may sometimes\r\nscoop out a suitable cavity when it cannot find one; for its mandibles\r\nseem equally capable of this, with those of any of the carpenter or\r\nmason-bees.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, the bee in question having selected a place suitably\r\nsheltered from the weather, and from the intrusion of depredators,\r\nproceeds to form her nest, the exterior walls of which she forms of the\r\nwool of pubescent plants, such as rose-campion (_Lychnis coronaria_),\r\nthe quince (_Pyrus cydonia_), cats-ears (_Stachys lunata_), &c. \"It\r\nis very pleasant,\" says Mr. White, of Selborne, \"to see with what\r\naddress this insect strips off the down, running from the top to the\r\nbottom of the branch, and shaving it bare with all the dexterity of\r\na hoop-shaver. When it has got a vast bundle, almost as large as\r\nitself, it flies away, holding it secure between its chin and its\r\nfore-legs.\"[Q] The material is rolled up like a ribbon; and we possess\r\na specimen in which one of these rolls still adheres to a rose-campion\r\nstem, the bee having been scared away before obtaining her load.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the cells of the nest are made seems not to be\r\nvery clearly understood. M. Latreille says, that, after constructing\r\nher nest of the down of quince-leaves, she deposits her eggs, together\r\nwith a store of paste, formed of the pollen of flowers, for nourishing\r\nthe grubs. Kirby and Spence, on the other hand, tell us, that \"the\r\nparent bee, _after_ having constructed her cells, laid an egg in each,\r\nand filled them with a store of suitable food, plasters them with a\r\ncovering of vermiform masses, apparently composed of honey and pollen;\r\nand having done this, aware, long before Count Rumford's experiments,\r\nwhat materials conduct heat most slowly,\" she collects the down from\r\nwoolly plants, and \"sticks it upon the plaster that covers her cells,\r\nand thus closely envelops them with a warm coating of down, impervious\r\nto every change of temperature.\" \"From later observations,\" however,\r\nthey are \"inclined to think that these cells may possibly, as in the\r\ncase of the humble-bee, be in fact formed by the larva previously to\r\nbecoming a pupa, after having eaten the provision of pollen and honey\r\nwith which the parent bee had surrounded it. The vermicular shape,\r\nhowever, of the masses with which the cases are surrounded, does not\r\nseem easily reconcilable with this supposition, unless they are\r\nconsidered as the excrement of the larva.\"[R]\r\n\r\nWhether or not this second explanation is the true one, we have not\r\nthe means of ascertaining; but we are almost certain the first is\r\nincorrect, as it is contrary to the regular procedure of insects to\r\nbegin with the interior part of any structure, and work outwards. We\r\nshould imagine, then, that the down is first spread out into the form\r\nrequired, and afterwards plastered on the inside to keep it in form,\r\nwhen probably the grub spins the vermicular cells previous to its\r\nmetamorphosis.\r\n\r\nIt might prove interesting to investigate this more minutely; and as\r\nthe bee is by no means scarce in the neighbourhood of London, it might\r\nnot be difficult for a careful observer to witness all the details\r\nof this singular architecture. Yet we have repeatedly endeavoured,\r\nbut without success, to watch the bees, when loaded with down, to\r\ntheir nests. The bee may be readily known from its congeners, by its\r\nbeing about the size of the hive-bee, but more broad and flattened,\r\nblackish-brown above, with a row of six yellow or white spots along\r\neach side of the rings, very like the rose-leaf cutter, and having the\r\nbelly covered with yellowish-brown hair, and the legs fringed with long\r\nhairs of a rather lighter colour.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[This bee does not bore a tunnel for herself, but occupies that of some\r\nother insect. The nests of this insect are generally to be obtained\r\nfrom old willows, because these trees are so largely bored by the\r\ngoat-moth caterpillar, and afford ample space for the larva. The woolly\r\nsubstance obtained from the plant is pressed against the sides of the\r\nburrow, so as to form a lining. She then makes a series of cells of a\r\nsimilar material, and the young larva, when it is about to change into\r\nthe pupa state, envelops itself in a silken covering of a brown colour.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact, that the male of this insect is considerably\r\nlarger than the female, thus reversing the usual order of things among\r\ninsects. Only one species of this bee is known in England.]\r\n\r\nA common bee belonging to the family of upholsterers is called the\r\nrose-leaf cutter (_Megachile centuncularis_, Latr.). The singularly\r\ningenious habits of this bee have long attracted the attention of\r\nnaturalists; but the most interesting description is given by Réaumur.\r\nSo extraordinary does the construction of their nests appear, that a\r\nFrench gardener having dug up some, and believing them to be the work\r\nof a magician, who had placed them in his garden with evil intent,\r\nsent them to Paris to his master, for advice as to what should be done\r\nby way of exorcism. On applying to the Abbé Nollet, the owner of the\r\ngarden was soon persuaded that the nests in question were the work of\r\ninsects; and M. Réaumur, to whom they were subsequently sent, found\r\nthem to be the nests of one of the upholsterer-bees, and probably of\r\nthe rose-leaf cutter, though the nests in question were made of the\r\nleaves of the mountain ash (_Pyrus aucuparia_).\r\n\r\nThe rose-leaf cutter makes a cylindrical hole in a beaten pathway,\r\nfor the sake of more consolidated earth (or in the cavities of walls\r\nor decayed wood), from six to ten inches deep, and does not throw\r\nthe earth dug out from it into a heap, like the Andrenæ.[S] In this\r\nshe constructs several cells about an inch in length, shaped like a\r\nthimble, and made of cuttings of leaves (not petals), neatly folded\r\ntogether, the bottom of one thimble-shaped cell being inserted into the\r\nmouth of the one below it, and so on in succession.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rose-leaf cutter Bees, and Nest lined with rose-leaves.]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe the manner in which this bee procures\r\nthe materials for forming the tapestry of her cells. The leaf of the\r\nrose-tree seems to be that which she prefers, though she sometimes\r\ntakes other sorts of leaves, particularly those with serrated margins,\r\nsuch as the birch, the perennial mercury (_Mercurialis perennis_),\r\nmountain-ash, &c. She places herself upon the outer edge of the\r\nleaf which she has selected, so that its margin may pass between her\r\nlegs. Turning her head towards the point, she commences near the\r\nfootstalk, and with her mandibles cuts out a circular piece with as\r\nmuch expedition as we could do with a pair of scissors, and with more\r\naccuracy and neatness than could easily be done by us. As she proceeds,\r\nshe keeps the cut portion between her legs, so as not to impede her\r\nprogress; and using her body for a _trammel_, as a carpenter would\r\nsay, she cuts in a regular curved line. As she supports herself during\r\nthe operation upon the portion of the leaf which she is detaching,\r\nit must be obvious, when it is nearly cut off, that the weight of\r\nher body might tear it away, so as to injure the accuracy of its\r\ncurvilineal shape. To prevent any accident of this kind, as soon as\r\nshe suspects that her weight might tear it, she poises herself on\r\nher wings, till she has completed the incision. It has been said, by\r\nnaturalists, that this manoeuvre of poising herself on the wing, is to\r\nprevent her falling to the ground, when the piece gives way; but as no\r\nwinged insect requires to take any such precaution, our explanation is\r\nprobably the true one.\r\n\r\nWith the piece which she has thus cut out, held in a bent position\r\nperpendicularly to her body, she flies off to her nest, and fits it\r\ninto the interior with the utmost neatness and ingenuity; and, without\r\nemploying any paste or glue, she trusts, as Réaumur ascertained, to\r\nthe spring the leaf takes in drying, to retain it in its position. It\r\nrequires from nine to ten pieces of leaf to form one cell, as they\r\nare not always of precisely the same thickness. The interior surface\r\nof each cell consists of three pieces of leaf, of equal size, narrow\r\nat one end, but gradually widening at the other, where the width\r\nequals half the length. One side of each of the pieces is the serrated\r\nmargin of the leaf from which it was cut, and this margin is always\r\nplaced outermost, and the cut margin innermost. Like most insects, she\r\nbegins with the exterior, commencing with a layer of tapestry, which\r\nis composed of three or four oval pieces, larger in dimensions than\r\nthe rest, adding a second and a third layer proportionately smaller.\r\nIn forming these, she is careful not to place a joining opposite to a\r\njoining, but with all the skill of a consummate artificer, lays the\r\nmiddle of each piece of leaf over the margins of the others, so as by\r\nthis means both to cover and strengthen the junctions. By repeating\r\nthis process, she sometimes forms a fourth or a fifth layer of leaves,\r\ntaking care to bend the leaves at the narrow extremity or closed end of\r\nthe cell, so as to bring them into a convex shape.\r\n\r\nWhen she has in this manner completed a cell, her next business is to\r\nreplenish it with a store of honey and pollen, which, being chiefly\r\ncollected from thistles, forms a beautiful rose-coloured conserve. In\r\nthis she deposits a single egg, and then covers in the opening with\r\nthree pieces of leaf, so exactly circular, that a pair of compasses\r\ncould not define their margin with more accuracy. In this manner the\r\nindustrious and ingenious upholsterer proceeds till the whole gallery\r\nis filled, the convex extremity of the one fitting into the open end of\r\nthe next, and serving both as a basis and as the means of strengthening\r\nit. If, by any accident, the labour of these insects is interrupted or\r\nthe edifice deranged, they exhibit astonishing perseverance in setting\r\nit again to rights. Insects, indeed, are not easily forced to abandon\r\nany work which they may have begun.\r\n\r\nThe monkish legends tell us that St. Francis Xavier, walking one day\r\nin a garden, and seeing an insect, of the _Mantis_ genus, moving along\r\nin its solemn way, holding up its two fore legs, as in the act of\r\ndevotion, desired it to sing the praises of God. The legend adds that\r\nthe saint immediately heard the insect carol a fine canticle with a\r\nloud emphasis. We want no miraculous voice to record the wonders of the\r\nAlmighty hand, when we regard the insect world. The little rose-leaf\r\ncutter, pursuing her work with the nicest mathematical art--using no\r\nartificial instruments to form her ovals and her circles--knowing\r\nthat the elastic property of the leaves will retain them in their\r\nposition--making her nest of equal strength throughout, by the most\r\nrational adjustment of each distinct part--demands from us something\r\nmore than mere wonder; for such an exercise of instinctive ingenuity\r\nat once directs our admiration to the great Contriver, who has so\r\nadmirably proportioned her knowledge to her necessities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER IV._\r\n\r\nCARDER-BEES; HUMBLE-BEES; SOCIAL-WASPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bees and wasps, whose ingenious architecture we have already\r\nexamined, are solitary in their labours. Those we are about to describe\r\nlive in society. The perfection of the social state among this class of\r\ninsects is certainly that of the hive-bees. They are the inhabitants of\r\na large city, where the arts are carried to a higher excellence than\r\nin small districts enjoying little communication of intelligence. But\r\nthe bees of the villages, if we may follow up the parallel, are not\r\nwithout their interest. Such are those which are called carder-bees and\r\nhumble-bees.\r\n\r\n\r\nCarder-Bees.\r\n\r\nThe nests of the bees which Réaumur denominates carders (_Bombus\r\nmuscorum_, Latr.) are by no means uncommon, and are well worth the\r\nstudy of the naturalist. During the hay harvest, they are frequently\r\nmet with by mowers in the open fields and meadows; but they may\r\nsometimes be discovered in hedge-banks, the borders of copses, or among\r\nmoss-grown stones. The description of the mode of building adopted\r\nby this bee has been copied by most of our writers on insects from\r\nRéaumur; though he is not a little severe on those who write without\r\nhaving ever had a single nest in their possession. We have been able to\r\navoid such a reproach; for we have now before us a very complete nest\r\nof carder-bees, which differs from those described by Réaumur, in being\r\nmade not of moss, but withered grass. With this exception, we find that\r\nhis account agrees accurately with our own observations. (J. R.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. A represents two Carder-Bees heckling moss for\r\ntheir Nests; B, exterior view of the Nest of the Carder-Bee.]\r\n\r\nThe carder-bees select for their nest a shallow excavation about\r\nhalf a foot in diameter; but when they cannot find one to suit their\r\npurpose, they undertake the Herculean task of digging one themselves.\r\nThey cover this hollow with a dome of moss--sometimes, as we have\r\nascertained, of withered grass. They make use, indeed, of whatever\r\nmaterials may be within their reach; for they do not attempt to bring\r\nanything from a distance, not even when they are deprived of the\r\ngreater portion by an experimental naturalist. Their only method of\r\ntransporting materials to the building is by pushing them along the\r\nground--the bee, for that purpose, working backwards, with its head\r\nturned from the nest. If there is only one bee engaged in this labour,\r\nas usually happens in the early spring, when a nest is founded by a\r\nsolitary female who has outlived the winter, she transports her little\r\nbundles of moss or grass by successive backward pushes, till she gets\r\nthem home.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the season, when the hive is populous and can\r\nafford more hands, there is an ingenious division of this labour. A\r\nfile of bees, to the number sometimes of half a dozen, is established,\r\nfrom the nest to the moss or grass which they intend to use, the heads\r\nof all the file of bees being turned from the nest and towards the\r\nmaterial. The last bee of the file lays hold of some of the moss with\r\nher mandibles, disentangles it from the rest, and having _carded_ it\r\nwith her fore legs into a sort of felt or small bundle, she pushes it\r\nunder her body to the next bee, who passes it in the same manner to the\r\nnext, and so on till it is brought to the border of the nest,--in the\r\nsame way as we sometimes see sugar-loaves conveyed from a cart to a\r\nwarehouse, by a file of porters throwing them from one to another.\r\n\r\nThe elevation of the dome, which is all built from the interior, is\r\nfrom four to six inches above the level of the field. Beside the moss\r\nor grass, they frequently employ coarse wax to form the ceiling of the\r\nvault, for the purpose of keeping out rain, and preventing high winds\r\nfrom destroying it. Before this finishing is given to the nest, we have\r\nremarked, that on a fine sunshiny day the upper portion of the dome was\r\nopened to the extent of more than an inch, in order, we suppose, to\r\nforward the hatching of the eggs in the interior; but on the approach\r\nof night this was carefully covered in again. It was remarkable that\r\nthe opening which we have just mentioned was never used by the bees for\r\neither their entrance or their exit from the nest, though they were all\r\nat work there, and, of course, would have found it the readiest and\r\neasiest passage; but they invariably made their exit and their entrance\r\nthrough the covert-way or gallery which opens at the bottom of the\r\nnest, and, in some nests, is about a foot long and half an inch wide.\r\nThis is, no doubt, intended for concealment from field-mice, polecats,\r\nwasps, and other depredators.\r\n\r\nOn removing a portion of the dome and bringing the interior of the\r\nstructure into view, we find little of the architectural regularity\r\nso conspicuous in the combs of a common bee-hive: instead of this\r\nsymmetry, there are only a few egg-shaped, dark-coloured cells, placed\r\nsomewhat irregularly, but approaching more to the horizontal than to\r\nthe vertical position, and connected together with small amorphous[T]\r\ncolumns of brown wax. Sometimes there are two or three of these oval\r\ncells placed one above another, without anything to unite them.\r\n\r\nThese cells are not, however, the workmanship of the old bees, but of\r\ntheir young grubs, who spin them when they are about to change into\r\nnymphs. But, from these cases, when they are spun, the enclosed insects\r\nhave no means of escaping, and they depend for their liberation on the\r\nold bees gnawing off the covering, as is done also by ants in the same\r\ncircumstances. The instinct with which they know the precise time when\r\nit is proper to do this is truly wonderful. It is no less so, that\r\nthese cocoons are by no means useless when thus untenanted, for they\r\nsubsequently serve for honey-pots, and are indeed the only store-cells\r\nin the nest. For this purpose the edge of the cell is repaired and\r\nstrengthened with a ring of wax.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Breeding-Cells.]\r\n\r\nThe true breeding-cells are contained in several amorphous masses of\r\nbrown-coloured wax, varying in dimensions, but of a somewhat flat and\r\nglobular shape. On opening any of these, a number of eggs or grubs are\r\nfound, on whose account the mother bee has collected the masses of\r\nwax, which also contain a supply of pollen moistened with honey, for\r\ntheir subsistence.\r\n\r\nThe number of eggs or grubs found in one spheroid of wax varies from\r\nthree to thirty, and the bees in a whole nest seldom exceed sixty.\r\nThere are three sizes of bees, of which the females are the largest;\r\nbut neither these nor the males are, as in the case of the hive-bee,\r\nexempt from labour, the females, indeed, always found the nests, since\r\nthey alone survive the winter, all the rest perishing with cold. In\r\neach nest, also, are several females, that live in harmony together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Interior views of Carder-Bee's Nest.]\r\n\r\nThe carder-bees may be easily distinguished from their congeners (of\r\nthe same genus), by being not unlike the colour of the withered moss\r\nwith which they build their nests, having the fore part of their\r\nback a dull orange, and hinder part ringed with different shades of\r\ngreyish yellow. They are not so large as the common humble-bee (_Bombus\r\nterrestris_, Latr.), but rather shorter and thicker in the body than\r\nthe common hive-bee (_Apis mellifica_).\r\n\r\n\r\nLapidary-Bees.\r\n\r\nA bee still more common, perhaps, than the carder is the orange-tailed\r\nbee, or lapidary (_Bombus lapidaria_), readily known by its general\r\nblack colour and reddish orange tail. It builds its nest sometimes\r\nin stony ground, but prefers a heap of stones such as are gathered\r\noff grass fields or are piled up near quarries. Unlike the carder,\r\nthe lapidary carries to its nest bits of moss, which are very neatly\r\narranged into a regular oval. These insects associate in their labours;\r\nand they make honey with great industry. The individuals of a nest\r\nare more numerous than the carders, and likewise more pertinaciously\r\nvindictive. About two years ago we discovered a nest of these bees at\r\nCompton-Bassett, in Wiltshire, in the centre of a heap of limestone\r\nrubbish; but owing to the brisk defensive warfare of their legionaries,\r\nwe could not obtain a view of the interior. It was not even safe to\r\napproach within many yards of the place; and we do not exaggerate when\r\nwe say that several of them pursued us most pertinaciously about a\r\nquarter of a mile. (J. R.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHumble-Bees.\r\n\r\nThe common humble-bee (_Bombus terrestris_) is precisely similar in\r\nits economy to the two preceding species, with this difference, that\r\nit forms its nest underground like the common wasp, in an excavated\r\nchamber, to which a winding passage leads, of from one to two feet, and\r\nof a diameter sufficient to allow of two bees passing. The cells have\r\nno covering beside the vault of the excavation and patches of coarse\r\nwax similar to that of the carder-bee.\r\n\r\n[The accompanying illustration represents a group of cells made by this\r\nspecies. As may be seen by reference to the engraving, they are not\r\nplaced with any regularity, but seem to be tossed about at random.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSome of the cells contain larvæ, in others, those closely sealed, lie\r\nthe pupæ in different stages of development, and some of the cells\r\nare filled with a very fragrant and sweet honey, which, however, is\r\ninjurious to many persons, giving them severe and persistent headaches,\r\neven though taken in small quantities.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSocial-Wasps.\r\n\r\nThe nest of the common wasp (_Vespa vulgaris_) attracts more or less\r\nthe attention of everybody; but its interior architecture is not so\r\nwell known as it deserves to be, for its singular ingenuity, in which\r\nit rivals even that of the hive-bee (_Apis mellifica_). In their\r\ngeneral economy the social or republican wasps closely resemble the\r\nhumble-bee (_Bombus_), every colony being founded by a single female\r\nwho has survived the winter, to the rigours of which all her summer\r\nassociates of males and working wasps uniformly fall victims. Nay, out\r\nof three hundred females which may be found in one vespiary, or wasp's\r\nnest, towards the close of autumn, scarcely ten or a dozen survive till\r\nthe ensuing spring, at which season they awake from their hibernal\r\nlethargy, and begin with ardour the labours of colonization.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to follow one of these mother wasps through her\r\nseveral operations, in which she merits more the praise of industry\r\nthan the queen of a bee-hive, who does nothing, and never moves without\r\na numerous train of obedient retainers, always ready to execute her\r\ncommands and to do her homage. The mother wasp, on the contrary, is\r\nat first alone, and is obliged to perform every species of drudgery\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nHer first care, after being roused to activity by the returning warmth\r\nof the season, is to discover a place suitable for her intended colony;\r\nand, accordingly, in the spring, wasps may be seen prying into every\r\nhole of a hedge-bank, particularly where field-mice have burrowed.\r\nSome authors report that she is partial to the forsaken galleries of\r\nthe mole; but this does not accord with our observations, as we have\r\nnever met with a single vespiary in any situation likely to have been\r\nfrequented by moles. But though we cannot assert the fact, we think it\r\nhighly probable that the deserted nest of the field-mouse, which is\r\nnot uncommon in hedge-banks, may be sometimes appropriated by a mother\r\nwasp as an excavation convenient for her purpose. Yet, if she does make\r\nchoice of the burrow of a field-mouse, it requires to be afterwards\r\nconsiderably enlarged in the interior chamber, and the entrance gallery\r\nvery much narrowed.\r\n\r\nThe desire of the wasp to save herself the labour of excavation, by\r\nforming her nest where other animals have burrowed, is not without\r\na parallel in the actions of quadrupeds, and even of birds. In the\r\nsplendid continuation of Wilson's American Ornithology, by Charles L.\r\nBonaparte (whose scientific pursuits have thrown around that name\r\na beneficent lustre, pleasingly contrasted with his uncle's glory),\r\nthere is an interesting example of this instinctive adoption of the\r\nlabours of others. \"In the trans-Mississippian territories of the\r\nUnited States, the burrowing-owl resides exclusively in the villages\r\nof the marmot, or prairie-dog, whose excavations are so commodious as\r\nto render it unnecessary that the owl should dig for himself, as he is\r\nsaid to do where no burrowing animals exist.[U] The villages of the\r\nprairie-dog are very numerous and variable in their extent,--sometimes\r\ncovering only a few acres, and at others spreading over the surface of\r\nthe country for miles together. They are composed of slightly-elevated\r\nmounds, having the form of a truncated cone, about two feet in width\r\nat the base, and seldom rising as high as eighteen inches from the\r\nsurface of the soil. The entrance is placed either at the top or on\r\nthe side, and the whole mound is beaten down externally, especially\r\nat the summit, resembling a much-used footpath. From the entrance,\r\nthe passage into the mound descends vertically for one or two feet,\r\nand is thence continued obliquely downwards until it terminates in an\r\napartment, within which the industrious prairie-dog constructs, on the\r\napproach of cold weather, a comfortable cell for his winter's sleep.\r\nThe cell, which is composed of fine dry grass, is globular in form,\r\nwith an opening at top, capable of admitting the finger; and the whole\r\nis so firmly compacted, that it might without injury be rolled over the\r\nfloor.\"[V]\r\n\r\nIn case of need the wasp is abundantly furnished by nature with\r\ninstruments for excavating a burrow out of the solid ground, as she no\r\ndoubt most commonly does--digging the earth with her strong mandibles,\r\nand carrying it off or pushing it out as she proceeds. The entrance\r\ngallery is about an inch or less in diameter, and usually runs in a\r\nwinding or zig-zag direction, from one to two feet in depth. In the\r\nchamber to which this gallery leads, and which, when completed, is from\r\none to two feet in diameter, the mother wasp lays the foundations of\r\nher city, beginning with the walls.\r\n\r\nThe building materials employed by wasps were long a matter of\r\nconjecture to scientific inquirers; for the bluish-grey papery\r\nsubstance of the whole structure has no resemblance to any sort of wax\r\nemployed by bees for a similar purpose. Now that the discovery has\r\nbeen made, we can with difficulty bring ourselves to believe that a\r\nnaturalist so acute and indefatigable as M. Réaumur, should have, for\r\ntwenty years, as he tells us, endeavoured, without success, to find\r\nout the secret. At length, however, his perseverance was rewarded. He\r\nremarked a female wasp alight on the sash of his window, and begin to\r\ngnaw the wood with her mandibles; and it struck him at once that she\r\nwas procuring materials for building. He saw her detach from the wood a\r\nbundle of fibres about a tenth of an inch in length, and finer than a\r\nhair; and as she did not swallow these, but gathered them into a mass\r\nwith her feet, he could not doubt that his first idea was correct. In\r\na short time she shifted to another part of the window-frame, carrying\r\nwith her the fibres she had collected, and to which she continued to\r\nadd, when he caught her, in order to examine the nature of her bundle;\r\nand he found that it was not yet moistened nor rolled into a ball, as\r\nis always done before employing it in building. In every other respect\r\nit had precisely the same colour and fibrous texture as the walls of a\r\nvespiary. It struck him as remarkable that it bore no resemblance to\r\nwood gnawed by other insects, such as the goat-moth caterpillar, which\r\nis granular like sawdust. This would not have suited the design of the\r\nwasp, who was well aware that fibres of some length form a stronger\r\ntexture. He even discovered, that before detaching the fibres, she\r\nbruised them (_les charpissoit_) into a sort of lint (_charpie_) with\r\nher mandibles. All this the careful naturalist imitated by bruising\r\nand paring the same wood of the window-sash with his penknife, till\r\nhe succeeded in making a little bundle of fibres scarcely to be\r\ndistinguished from that collected by the wasp.\r\n\r\nWe have ourselves frequently seen wasps employed in procuring their\r\nmaterials in this manner, and have always observed that they shift\r\nfrom one part to another more than once in preparing a single load--a\r\ncircumstance which we ascribe entirely to the restless temper peculiar\r\nto the whole order of hymenopterous insects. Réaumur found that\r\nthe wood which they preferred was such as had been long exposed to\r\nthe weather, and is old and dry. White of Selborne, and Kirby and\r\nSpence, on the contrary, maintain that wasps obtain their paper from\r\nsound timber, hornets only from that which is decayed.[W] Our own\r\nobservations, however, confirm the statement of Réaumur with respect\r\nto wasps, as, in every instance which has fallen under our notice, the\r\nwood selected was very much weathered; and in one case, an old oak post\r\nin a garden at Lee, in Kent, half destroyed by dry-rot, was seemingly\r\nthe resort of all the wasps in the vicinity. In another case, the deal\r\nbond in a brick wall, which had been built thirty years, is at this\r\nmoment (June, 1829) literally striped with the gnawings of wasps, which\r\nwe have watched at the work for hours together. (J. R.)\r\n\r\n[Different species of wasps use different materials for their nest.\r\n_Vespa vulgaris_ always uses decayed wood, while _V. germanica_ and\r\nother species use sound wood. Owing to the colour, the distinction\r\nbetween the nests of these insects is evident at a glance.\r\n\r\nThe bundles of ligneous fibres thus detached are moistened before being\r\nused, with a glutinous liquid, which causes them to adhere together,\r\nand are then kneaded into a sort of paste, or _papier maché_.\r\n\r\nThe method employed by the wasp in making its nest has been so\r\nadmirably described by Mr. S. Stone, that we cannot do better than copy\r\nhis description, which appeared in \"Beeton's Annual\" of 1865.\r\n\r\n\"Having found a place suitable--the deserted burrows of the field-mice\r\nbeing perhaps more generally selected than any other by the underground\r\nspecies, the chamber formed by that animal for its nest being exactly\r\nthe kind of place required by the insect--it proceeds to attach its web\r\nto the centre of the roof of the chamber. This consists, in the first\r\ninstance, of a pedicle, or footstalk, about half an inch in length,\r\nat the extremity of which a single cell is formed, which is presently\r\nsurrounded by others.\r\n\r\n\"Simultaneously with the formation of these cells, an umbrella-shaped\r\ncovering is prepared above them. More cells are added, an egg being\r\ndeposited in each of them as soon as formed, while constant additions\r\nare made to the covering until it has assumed a globular form, with\r\nonly an aperture sufficiently large for the insect to pass in and out.\r\nBefore the completion of the first covering, a second, just large\r\nenough to enclose it, is begun, and while this is in progress a third\r\nis commenced, and then a fourth, and so on. When young wasps have\r\nbeen produced in sufficient numbers to carry on the work without the\r\nassistance of the parent, an event which usually takes place in about\r\nsix weeks from the commencement of the nest, she does not again leave\r\nhome, but occupies herself solely in the task of depositing eggs as\r\nfast as cells can be formed by the workers for their reception.\r\n\r\n\"There are two methods by which the nests are enlarged by the workers\r\nafter the queen has given up the task of building; some species\r\nchoosing one, some adopting the other. One consists in forming a series\r\nof regular sheets or layers, which are made to overlap each other like\r\nthe slates or tiles on the roof of a building, in the same way as is\r\npursued by the queen of every species so long as she continues to be\r\nthe architect. When a few of these sheets have been completed, that\r\nis, when they have been made to assume a spherical form, with only a\r\nsmall aperture for ingress and egress, each internal sheet is cut away,\r\nnearly but not quite, as fast as additional ones are formed externally,\r\nthe shell or covering therefore slightly increasing in thickness as\r\nthe nest increases in size. Thus architects among the human race are\r\ncareful to proportion the thickness, and consequently the strength of\r\nthe walls to the magnitude of the building designed to be erected.\r\n\r\n\"The other method consists in forming hollow pieces, or raising, as it\r\nwere, blisters all over the plain surface which the queen has left;\r\nand upon these other blisters, and so on continually; cutting away,\r\nas in the former case, the under skin on the formation of the outer\r\none. The latter method is adopted by the workers of _V. crabro_, _V.\r\nvulgaris_, and _V. germanica_; the former by _V. Norvegica_, _V.\r\nsylvestris_, _V. rufa_, and probably by _V. arborea_. Cutting away the\r\ninner portions of the coverings is a necessary process in order to make\r\nroom for the increased size of the comb or combs. The material cut away\r\nis not thrown by as useless, but is worked up afresh; indeed this is\r\neffected in, and by, the very act of removing it; it is then either\r\nused in enlarging the combs or it is brought out and employed in making\r\nadditions to the outside.\r\n\r\n\"As the nest increases in size, it is obvious that the cavity in which\r\nit is placed must be proportionably enlarged; accordingly, each wasp,\r\nas it emerges from the aperture, may be observed to bring out with\r\nit a small lump of earth which it has scraped from the walls of the\r\nchamber, care being taken to keep a clear space of about a quarter of\r\nan inch between the covering of the nest, and the walls of the chamber.\r\nAbout the same space also occurs between the combs, which are placed\r\nhorizontally, with the mouth of the cells downwards; supporting columns\r\nor pillars being constructed at regular intervals so as to keep them at\r\na proper distance apart, thus allowing the insects room to pass between\r\nthem for the purpose of feeding the grubs. Supporting columns or\r\npillars are also placed between the roof of the chamber and the crown\r\nof the nest, connecting the one with the other; and these supports are\r\nconstantly strengthened as the increasing weight of the nest renders\r\nsuch a precaution necessary.\r\n\r\n\"The material of which the wasps' nests are composed is a sort of\r\npaper manufactured chiefly from wood by the insects themselves; one\r\nspecies using sound wood for the purpose, another that which has become\r\ndecayed. This they scrape by means of their jaws from posts, rails,\r\ngates, hurdles, &c., in which act it becomes mixed with some peculiar\r\nfluid with which they are provided; it then possesses nearly the same\r\nproperties as the pulp from which paper is made, but is of firmer\r\nconsistence. This is gathered in a small lump under the chest, to which\r\nit adheres, and in that way is carried to the nest.\r\n\r\n\"The operators having, after the exhibition of a considerable amount of\r\nfickleness in the choice, fixed upon a suitable place for commencing,\r\nor recommencing operations--for these remarks have reference to a nest\r\nalready somewhat advanced in the building--place themselves along the\r\nedge of a yet unfinished piece, then walking slowly backward, spread\r\nthe material as they go, along this edge, where it forms a thick\r\nstreak; they then go forward to the point at which they began to spread\r\nthe composition, again marching slowly backward, press this streak\r\nbetween their jaws, which acts as a pair of pincers, thus thinning it\r\nout throughout its whole length. They then go forward a second time,\r\npressing it still thinner, and then a third, and so on, until they\r\nhave rendered it sufficiently thin. Before this is accomplished, the\r\noperators have generally to go five or six times over their work. They\r\ndo not return to the same spot with their next burden, but seek a fresh\r\none, and thus allow the work they recently executed to become dry and\r\nfirm, previous to making further additions to it. Possibly the material\r\nfirst 'used up' was from wood of a dark colour; the next may be from\r\nlight-coloured wood, and the next from that of an intermediate colour;\r\nand this it is which gives so much beauty to the coverings of the nests\r\nof these insects.\r\n\r\n\"_Vespa crabro_ and _V. vulgaris_ are the only species which use\r\ndecayed wood or touchwood in the fabrication of their nests; the other\r\nspecies employ sound wood, varied occasionally by sound vegetable fibre\r\nobtained from plants of different kinds.\r\n\r\n\"From the upper combs in a nest, workers are produced; from the lower\r\nones, queens or females; and from the intermediate ones, males. Workers\r\nbecome developed early in the season, males not till an advanced\r\nperiod; and young females or queens not until towards the close of the\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n\"The nests of _V. crabro_, _V. vulgaris_, and _V. germanica_, when\r\nof full size, measure not unfrequently twelve inches in diameter,\r\nthe communities working on, in a favourable season, until the month\r\nof November; while the labours of the other species close, and the\r\ncommunities break up towards the end of August; their nests scarcely\r\nattaining to half the size of those above mentioned.\"\r\n\r\nThe accompanying illustration exhibits the nest of the common wasp in\r\nan early stage. The first cover has been completed, and a second is in\r\ncourse of progress. We have now before us a beautiful series of wasps'\r\nnests, in their various stages, prepared by Mr. Stone, in order to show\r\nthe progressive enlargement of the edifice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nest of Wasp in an early stage.]\r\n\r\nFirst, there is the single cell attached to a small part that had\r\npenetrated the roof of the burrow. Next comes a more advanced stage, in\r\nwhich three cells are made, and the roof is just begun, being not quite\r\nhalf an inch in diameter. Then come five cells, and a tolerably large\r\nroof; and then twelve cells, with a complete roof.\r\n\r\nThe next stage is that which is represented in the illustration, where\r\nthe group of cells is seen suspended from its slender footstalk, and\r\na second covering is in progress. By degrees the nest enlarges until\r\nthe second layer or tier of cells is begun, while the first tier is\r\noccupied in the centre by the pupæ, sheltered by their little silk\r\ndoors, and on the circumference by the larvæ, whose cells are still\r\nopen in order to allow themselves to be fed by the nurse-wasps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section of the same Nest, showing the first tier of\r\nCells.]\r\n\r\nIn these nests, the difference between the homes of _Vespa vulgaris_\r\nand those of _V. germanica_ is very strongly marked, the former being\r\nyellowish brown, and the latter grey. One nest of _V. germanica_, is\r\nremarkable for being thickly studded with the long, white eggs of some\r\ninsect, probably a parasite, which has gained admittance to the burrow,\r\nin spite of the care of its guardians. It may be here mentioned, that\r\n_V. germanica_ is by far the most common species of wasp in England.\r\n\r\nThe illustration at p. 90 represents a completed nest of _V.\r\ngermanica_. The rough, thick covering is seen outside, and within\r\nare the tiers of cells, each layer being supported by pillars from\r\nthe layer immediately above. These pillars are always formed at the\r\nangle where these cells touch each other, so as to obtain as strong a\r\nfoundation as possible. Only a very small space is left between the\r\ncombs, just enough room, in fact, for the nurse-wasps to pass as they\r\nfeed the young. The reader will remember that the young wasps all hang\r\nwith their heads downwards, being held in their places by a sort of\r\nclasper at the end of the tail.]\r\n\r\nWhen the foundress-wasp has completed a certain number of cells, and\r\ndeposited eggs in them, she soon intermits her building operations,\r\nin order to procure food for the young grubs, which now require all\r\nher care. In a few weeks these become perfect wasps, and lend their\r\nassistance in the extension of the edifice; enlarging the original\r\ncoping of the foundress by side walls, and forming another platform of\r\ncells, suspended to the first by columns, as that had been suspended to\r\nthe ceiling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section of the Social-Wasp's Nest.\r\n\r\n_a a_, the external wall; _b_, _c c_, five small terraces of cells for\r\nthe neuter wasps, _d d_, _e e_, three rows of larger cells for the\r\nmales and females.]\r\n\r\nIn this manner several platforms of combs are constructed, the outer\r\nwalls being extended at the same time; and, by the end of the summer,\r\nthere is generally from twelve to fifteen platforms of cells. Each\r\ncontains about 1060 cells--forty-nine being contained in an inch and a\r\nhalf square, and, of course, making the enormous number of about 16,000\r\ncells in one colony. Réaumur, upon these data, calculates that one\r\nvespiary may produce every year more than 30,000 wasps, reckoning only\r\n10,000 cells, and each serving successively for the cradle of three\r\ngenerations. But, although the whole structure is built at the expense\r\nof so much labour and ingenuity, it has scarcely been finished before\r\nthe winter sets in, when it becomes nearly useless, and serves only for\r\nthe abode of a few benumbed females, who abandon it on the approach of\r\nspring, and never return; for wasps do not, like mason-bees, ever make\r\nuse of the same nest for more than one season.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A, represents one of the rods from which the terraces\r\nare suspended. B, a portion of the external crust.]\r\n\r\nBoth Réaumur and the younger Huber studied the proceedings of the\r\ncommon wasp in the manner which has been so successful in observing\r\nbees--by means of glazed hives, and other contrivances. In this, these\r\nnaturalists were greatly aided by the extreme affection of wasps for\r\ntheir young; for though their nest is carried off, or even cut in\r\nvarious directions, and exposed to the light, they never desert it, nor\r\nrelax their attention to their progeny. When a wasp's nest is removed\r\nfrom its natural situation, and covered with a glass hive, the first\r\noperation of the inhabitants is to repair the injuries it has suffered.\r\nThey carry off with surprising activity all the earth or other matters\r\nwhich have fallen by accident into the nest; and when they have got it\r\nthoroughly cleared of everything extraneous, they begin to secure it\r\nfrom further derangement, by fixing it to the glass with papyraceous\r\ncolumns, similar to those which we have already described. The\r\nbreaches which the nest may have suffered are then repaired, and the\r\nthickness of the walls is augmented, with the design, perhaps, of more\r\neffectually excluding the light.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe nest of the hornet is nearly the same in structure with that of\r\nthe wasp; but the materials are considerably coarser, and the columns\r\nto which the platforms of cells are suspended are larger and stronger,\r\nthe middle one being twice as thick as any of the others. The hornet,\r\nalso, does not build underground, but in the cavities of trees, or in\r\nthe thatch or under the eaves of barns. Réaumur once found upon a wall\r\na hornet's nest which had not been long begun, and had it transferred\r\nto the outside of his study-window; but in consequence, as he imagined,\r\nof the absence of the foundress-hornet at the time it was removed, he\r\ncould not get the other five hornets, of which the colony consisted,\r\neither to add to the building or repair the damages which it had\r\nsustained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hornet's Nest in its first stage.]\r\n\r\nM. Réaumur differs from our English naturalists, White, and Kirby\r\nand Spence, with respect to the materials employed by the hornet for\r\nbuilding. The latter say that it employs decayed wood; the former, that\r\nit uses the bark of the ash-tree, but takes less pains to split it\r\ninto fine fibres than wasps do; not, however, because it is destitute\r\nof skill; for in constructing the suspensory columns of the platforms,\r\na paste is prepared little inferior to that made by wasps. We cannot,\r\nfrom our own observations, decide which of the above statements is\r\ncorrect, as we have only once seen a hornet procuring materials, at\r\nCompton-Bassett, in Wiltshire; and in that case it gnawed the inner\r\nbark of an elm which had been felled for several months, and was,\r\nconsequently, dry and tough. Such materials as this would account for\r\nthe common yellowish-brown colour of a hornet's nest. (J. R.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[The accompanying figure represents a completed hornet's nest as it\r\nappears when suspended from a beam. Hornets often choose for their\r\nhome the space between the roof and the ceiling of summer-houses,\r\nand the nests that are made in such localities are mostly large and\r\nhandsome. The reader should notice the blisters by means of which the\r\ninsect enlarges its habitation.]\r\n\r\nWhen hornets make choice of a tree for their domicile, they select one\r\nwhich is in a state of decay, and already partly hollowed; but they\r\npossess the means, in their sharp and strong mandibles, of extending\r\nthe excavation to suit their purposes; and Réaumur frequently witnessed\r\ntheir operations in mining into a decayed tree, and carrying off what\r\nthey had gnawed. He observed, also, that in such cases they did not\r\nmake use of the large hole of the tree for an entrance, but went to\r\nthe trouble of digging a gallery, sufficient for the passage of the\r\nlargest hornet in the nest, through the living and undecayed portion of\r\nthe tree. As this is perforated in a winding direction, it is no doubt\r\nintended for the purpose of protecting the nest from the intrusion of\r\ndepredators, who could more easily effect an entrance if there were not\r\nsuch a tortuous way to pass through.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hornet's Nest in a hollow tree.]\r\n\r\n[Here is an illustration of a hornet's nest as it appears in the hollow\r\nof a tree. Industrious as is this insect, it never takes needless\r\ntrouble, and alters its nest according to circumstances. As has already\r\nbeen seen, the combs are defended by a complete cover when the nest is\r\nplaced in an open situation. But when it is built in the hollow of a\r\ntree there is no cover at all, the insect evidently knowing that the\r\nwooden wall with which the cells are surrounded, affords a sufficient\r\nprotection. In cases where a cover is made, the hornets do not form\r\nonly a single entrance, as is the case with the wasp, but have a large\r\nnumber of small entrances in different parts of the wall. Some of these\r\nentrances can be seen in the illustration on page 93.\r\n\r\nHornets are in one sense more industrious than wasps. When night falls,\r\nthe wasps betake themselves to their home, and sleep throughout the\r\nnight. But, if the moon be up, the hornet is sure to work throughout\r\nthe entire night, and will often do so, even when no moon is visible.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable of our native social wasps is the tree-wasp\r\n(_Vespa Britannica_), which is not uncommon in the northern, but is\r\nseldom to be met with in the southern parts of the island. Instead of\r\nburrowing in the ground like the common wasp (_Vespa vulgaris_), or\r\nin the hollows of trees like the hornet (_Vespa crabro_), it boldly\r\nswings its nest from the extremity of a branch, where it exhibits\r\nsome resemblance, in size and colour, to a Welsh wig hung out to\r\ndry. We have seen more than one of these nests on the same tree, at\r\nCatrine, in Ayrshire, and at Wemyss Bay, in Renfrewshire. The tree\r\nwhich the Britannic wasp prefers is the silver fir, whose broad flat\r\nbranch serves as a protection to the suspended nest both from the\r\nsun and the rain. We have also known a wasp's nest of this kind in a\r\ngooseberry-bush, at Red-house Castle, East Lothian. The materials and\r\nstructure are nearly the same as those employed by the common wasp, and\r\nwhich we have already described. (J. R.)\r\n\r\n[We have before us a beautiful example of a nest made by this species\r\nof wasp. There are no less than three consecutive coverings quite\r\nentire, while another is about three-fourths completed, and a fifth is\r\njust begun. The illustration exhibits a very perfect specimen.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA singular nest of a species of wasp is figured by Réaumur, but is\r\napparently rare in this country, as Kirby and Spence mention only a\r\nsingle nest of similar construction, found in a garden at East-Dale.\r\nThis nest is of a flattened globular figure, and composed of a great\r\nnumber of envelopes, so as to assume a considerable resemblance to a\r\nhalf-expanded Provence rose. The British specimen mentioned by Kirby\r\nand Spence had only one platform of cells; Réaumur had two; but there\r\nwas a large vacant space, which would probably have been filled with\r\ncells, had the nest not been taken away as a specimen. The whole nest\r\nwas not much larger than a rose, and was composed of paper exactly\r\nsimilar to that employed by the common ground-wasp.[X]\r\n\r\n[This is probably the nest of _V. rufa_. We possess several specimens\r\nof the nest, one of which corresponds tolerably closely with the\r\nedifice described in the work.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wasp's Nest.]\r\n\r\nThere is another species of social-wasp (_Epipone nidulans_, Latr.)\r\nmeriting attention from the singular construction of its nest. It forms\r\none or more terraces of cells, similar to those of the common wasp,\r\nbut without the protection of an outer wall, and quite exposed to the\r\nweather. Swammerdam found a nest of this description attached to the\r\nstem of a nettle. Réaumur says that they are sometimes attached to the\r\nbranch of a thorn or other shrub, or to stalks of grass;--peculiarities\r\nwhich prove that there are several species of these wasps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wasps' Cells attached to a Branch.]\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable circumstance in the architecture of this species\r\nof vespiary is, that it is not horizontal, like those formerly\r\ndescribed, but nearly vertical. The reason appears to be, that if it\r\nhad been horizontal, the cells must have been frequently filled with\r\nrain; whereas, in the position in which it is placed, the rain runs\r\noff without lodging. It is, besides, invariably placed so as to face\r\nthe north or the east, and consequently is less exposed to rains,\r\nwhich most frequently come with southerly or westerly winds. It is\r\nanother remarkable peculiarity, that, unlike the nests of other wasps,\r\nit is covered with a shining coat of varnish, to prevent moisture\r\nfrom soaking into the texture of the wasp's paper. The laying on\r\nthis varnish, indeed, forms a considerable portion of the labour of\r\nthe colony, and individuals may be seen employed for hours together\r\nspreading it on with their tongues.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Comb of Polistes.]\r\n\r\n[There is a genus of foreign hymenoptera, called _Polistes_, which\r\nis remarkable for the building powers possessed by its members. The\r\naccompanying illustration is taken from a nest in the British Museum,\r\nand is given of the natural size. The cells are not hexagonal, like\r\nthose of the _Epipone_, but are roundish in form. Those in the centre\r\nassume a roughly hexagonal form by pressure, but those which form the\r\ncircumference of the cell-group are nearly round, especially on their\r\nouter sides. The cells are not of uniform width, but are narrower at\r\nthe base than at the mouth, thus causing the group to assume the form\r\nwhich is seen in the illustration. This curious group of cells was\r\nbrought from Bareilly, in the East Indies, and in the same collection\r\nthere are several other specimens, varying considerably both in shape\r\nand size.]\r\n\r\nFew circumstances are more striking, with regard to insects, as Kirby\r\nand Spence justly remark, than the great and incessant labour which\r\nmaternal affection for their progeny leads them to undergo. Some of\r\nthese exertions are so disproportionate to the size of the insect,\r\nthat nothing short of ocular conviction could attribute them to such\r\nan agent. A wild bee, or a wasp, for instance, as we have seen, will\r\ndig a hole in a hard bank of earth some inches deep, and five or six\r\ntimes its own size, labouring unremittingly at this arduous task for\r\nseveral days in succession, and scarcely allowing itself a moment for\r\neating or repose. It will then occupy as much time in searching for a\r\nstore of food; and no sooner is this finished, than it will set about\r\nrepeating the process, and, before it dies, will have completed five or\r\nsix similar cells, or even more.\r\n\r\nWe shall have occasion more particularly to dwell upon the geometrical\r\narrangement of the cells, both of the wasp and of the social-bee,\r\nin our description of those interesting operations, which have long\r\nattracted the notice, and commanded the admiration of mathematicians\r\nand naturalists. A few observations may here be properly bestowed upon\r\nthe _material_ with which the wasp-family construct the interior of\r\ntheir nests.\r\n\r\nThe wasp is a paper-maker, and a most perfect and intelligent one.\r\nWhile mankind were arriving, by slow degrees, at the art of fabricating\r\nthis valuable substance, the wasp was making it before their eyes, by\r\nvery much the same process as that by which human hands now manufacture\r\nit with the best aid of chemistry and machinery. While some nations\r\ncarved their records on wood, and stone, and brass, and leaden\r\ntablets,--others, more advanced, wrote with a style on wax,--others\r\nemployed the inner bark of trees, and others the skins of animals\r\nrudely prepared,--the wasp was manufacturing a firm and durable paper.\r\nEven when the papyrus was rendered more fit, by a process of art, for\r\nthe transmission of ideas in writing, the wasp was a better artisan\r\nthan the Egyptians; for the early attempts at paper-making were so\r\nrude, that the substance produced was almost useless, from being\r\nextremely friable. The paper of the papyrus was formed of the leaves\r\nof the plant, dried, pressed, and polished; the wasp alone knew how\r\nto reduce vegetable fibres to a pulp, and then unite them by a size\r\nor glue, spreading the substance out into a smooth and delicate leaf.\r\nThis is exactly the process of paper-making. It would seem that the\r\nwasp knows, as the modern paper-makers now know, that the fibres of\r\nrags, whether linen or cotton, are not the only materials that can be\r\nused in the formation of paper; she employs other vegetable matters,\r\nconverting them into a proper consistency by her assiduous exertions.\r\nIn some respects she is more skilful even than our paper-makers, for\r\nshe takes care to retain her fibres of sufficient length, by which she\r\nrenders her paper as strong as she requires. Many manufacturers of\r\nthe present day cut their material into small bits, and thus produce\r\na rotten article. One great distinction between good and bad paper is\r\nits toughness; and this difference is invariably produced by the fibre\r\nof which it is composed being long, and therefore tough; or short, and\r\ntherefore friable.\r\n\r\nThe wasp has been labouring at her manufacture of paper from her first\r\ncreation, with precisely the same instruments and the same materials;\r\nand her success has been unvarying. Her machinery is very simple,\r\nand therefore it is never out of order. She learns nothing, and she\r\nforgets nothing. Men, from time to time, lose their excellence in\r\nparticular arts, and they are slow in finding out real improvements.\r\nSuch improvements are often the effect of accident. Paper is now\r\nmanufactured very extensively by machinery in all its stages; and\r\nthus, instead of a single sheet being made by hand, a stream of\r\npaper is poured out, which would form a roll large enough to extend\r\nround the globe, if such a length were desirable. The inventors of\r\nthis machinery, Messrs. Fourdrinier, it is said, spent the enormous\r\nsum of 40,000_l._. in vain attempts to render the machine capable\r\nof determining with precision the width of the roll; and, at last,\r\naccomplished their object, at the suggestion of a bystander, by\r\na strap revolving upon an axis, at a cost of three shillings and\r\nsixpence. Such is the difference between the workings of human\r\nknowledge and experience, and those of animal instinct. We proceed\r\nslowly and in the dark, but our course is not bounded by a narrow\r\nline, for it seems difficult to say what is the perfection of any art;\r\nanimals go clearly to a given point--but they can go no further. We\r\nmay, however, learn something from their perfect knowledge of what is\r\nwithin their range. It is not improbable that if man had attended in an\r\nearlier state of society to the labours of wasps, he would have sooner\r\nknown how to make paper. We are still behind in our arts and sciences,\r\nbecause we have not always been observers. If we had watched the\r\noperations of insects, and the structure of insects in general, with\r\nmore care, we might have been far advanced in the knowledge of many\r\narts which are yet in their infancy, for nature has given us abundance\r\nof patterns. We have learnt to perfect some instruments of sound by\r\nexamining the structure of the human ear; and the mechanism of an eye\r\nhas suggested some valuable improvements in achromatic glasses.\r\n\r\nRéaumur has given a very interesting account of the wasps of Cayenne\r\n(_Chartergus nidulans_), which hang their nests in trees.[Y] Like\r\nthe bird of Africa called the social grosbeak (_Loxia socia_), they\r\nfabricate a perfect house, capable of containing many hundreds of\r\ntheir community, and suspend it on high out of the reach of attack.\r\nBut the Cayenne wasp is a more expert artist than the bird. He is\r\na pasteboard-maker;--and the card with which he forms the exterior\r\ncovering of his abode is so smooth, so strong, so uniform in its\r\ntexture, and so white, that the most skilful manufacturer of this\r\nsubstance might be proud of the work. It takes ink admirably.\r\n\r\nThe nest of the pasteboard-making wasp is impervious to water. It hangs\r\nupon the branch of a tree, as represented in the engraving; and those\r\nrain-drops which penetrate through the leaves never rest upon its hard\r\nand polished surface. A small opening for the entrance of the insects\r\nterminates its funnel-shaped bottom. It is impossible to unite more\r\nperfectly the qualities of lightness and strength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nest of the Pasteboard-maker Wasp, with part removed to\r\nshow the arrangement of the Cells.]\r\n\r\nIn the specimen from which we take our description, the length of\r\nwhich is nine inches, six stout circular platforms stretch internally\r\nacross, like so many floors, and fixed all round to the walls of the\r\nnest. They are smooth above, with hexagonal cells on the under surface.\r\nThese platforms are not quite flat, but rather concave above, like a\r\nwatch-glass reversed; the centre of each platform is perforated for\r\nthe admission of the wasps, at the extremity of a short funnel-like\r\nprojection, and through this access is gained from story to story. On\r\neach platform, therefore, can the wasps walk leisurely about attending\r\nto the pupæ secured in the cells, which, with the mouths downward,\r\ncover the ceiling above their heads--the height of the latter being\r\njust convenient for their work.\r\n\r\n[Unlike the habitations made by the British wasps, and which are\r\nvacated annually, this nest is permanent, and serves for several\r\nsuccessive seasons. Of course, it must be enlarged continually, so\r\nas to accommodate an ever-increasing number of inhabitants. The mode\r\nof enlarging is sufficiently curious. The British wasps enlarge\r\ntheir nests either by making a larger covering and then removing the\r\nsmaller, or by raising blisters on the outside, and eating away beneath\r\nthem. But the pendulous wasp of Brazil proceeds on just the opposite\r\nprinciple, making new cells first, and covering them afterwards. The\r\nnew tier of cells is set on the bottom of the nest, which thus becomes\r\nthe floor of that tier, and a new bottom is then made beneath these new\r\ncells.]\r\n\r\nPendent wasps' nests of enormous size are found in Ceylon, suspended\r\noften in the talipot-tree at the height of seventy feet. The appearance\r\nof these nests thus elevated, with the larger leaves of the tree,\r\nused by the natives as umbrellas and tents, waving over them, is very\r\nsingular. Though no species of European wasp is a storer of honey,\r\nyet this rule does not apply to certain species of South America. In\r\nthe 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History' for June, 1841, will be\r\nfound a detailed account, with a figure, of the pendent nest of a\r\nspecies termed by Mr. A. White _Myrapetra scutellaris_. The external\r\ncase consists of stout cardboard covered with conical knobs of various\r\nsizes. The entrances are artfully protected by pent-roofs from the\r\nweather and heavy rains; and are tortuous, so as to render the ingress\r\nof a moth or other large insect difficult. Internally are fourteen\r\ncombs, exclusive of a globular mass, the nucleus of several circular\r\ncombs, which are succeeded by others of an arched form--that is,\r\nconstituting segments of circles. Many of the uppermost combs were\r\nfound to have the cells filled with honey of a brownish-red colour, but\r\nwhich had lost its flavour. After entering into some minute details,\r\nMr. A. White makes the following interesting observations:--\"Azara,\r\nin the account of his residence in various parts of South America,\r\nmentions the fact of _several wasps_ of these countries collecting\r\nhoney. The Baron Walchenaer, who edited the French translation of\r\nthis work, published in 1809, thought that the Spanish traveller, who\r\nwas unskilled in entomology, had made some mistake with regard to\r\nthe insects, and regarded the so-called _wasps_ as belonging to some\r\n_bee_ of the genus of which _Apis amalthea_ is the type (_Melipona_).\r\nLatreille (who afterwards corrected his mistake) also believed that\r\nthey must be referred to the genera _Melipona_ or _Trigona_--insects\r\nwhich in South America take the place of our honey-bee. These authors\r\nwere afterwards clearly convinced of the correctness of Azara's\r\nobservations, by the circumstance of M. Auguste de St. Hilaire finding\r\nnear the river Uruguay an oval grey-coloured nest of a papery\r\nconsistence, like that of the European wasps, suspended from the\r\nbranches of a small shrub about a foot from the ground: he and two\r\nother attendants partook of some honey (contained in its cells) and\r\nfound it of an agreeable sweetness, free from the pharmaceutic taste\r\nwhich so frequently accompanies European honey. He gives a detailed\r\naccount of its poisonous effects on himself and his two men. Afterwards\r\nhe procured specimens of the wasp, which was described by Latreille\r\nunder the name of _Polistes Lecheguana_.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nest of Myrapetra.]\r\n\r\n[The accompanying illustration shows this remarkable nest, both as it\r\nappears externally, and when divided vertically.\r\n\r\nThe material is probably the dung of the Capincha, an animal allied\r\nto the guinea-pig and the agouti. The natives, at all events, state\r\nthat such is the case, and the aspect of the nest as seen through a\r\nmagnifying glass carries out this assertion. The nest is hung to a\r\nbranch, and is seldom more than four feet from the ground. The insect\r\nis a very little one in comparison with the size of the nest, which is\r\nsixteen inches in length, and twelve in width. The largest specimens of\r\nthis insect are only one third of an inch long, while the generality\r\nscarcely exceed a quarter of an inch. Its colour is brown.\r\n\r\nIn the section is shown the very peculiar shape of the combs. At the\r\nupper part is seen the globular centre, surrounded with a comb that\r\ncompletely encircles it. Other combs follow in order, but are less\r\ncurved as they approach the bottom of the nest. The insects obtain\r\nadmission to the several tiers by means of apertures which are left\r\nbetween the extremities of the comb and the wall of the nest. The combs\r\nare made of the same material as the outer wall, but are very thin and\r\npaper-like. This nest may be seen in the British Museum.]\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the nest described by Mr. White agrees with that\r\nof a wasp termed _Chiguana_ by Azara (or _Lecheguana_), and is very\r\ndifferent to the slight papery nest of the _Polistes Lecheguana_ of\r\nLatreille. We may add that M. Auguste de St. Hilaire speaks of two\r\nspecies of wasps remarkable for storing honey in South America; the\r\nhoney of one is white, of the other reddish. That the habits of these\r\nhoney-wasps must differ considerably from those of any of our European\r\nspecies we may at once admit; perhaps in some points of their economy\r\nthese insects may approach the bee.\r\n\r\n[In the same country as is inhabited by the _Myrapetra_, and in\r\nmuch the same localities, is sometimes found the nest of another\r\nhoney-making wasp, called _Nectarinia analis_, a small and plainly-clad\r\ninsect. It is hung to the branches of low trees and underwood, and\r\noften includes both twigs and leaves in its structure. The combs of\r\nthis insect are greatly curved, in order to suit the shape of the\r\ngeneral covering, but are not arranged with that beautiful regularity\r\nwhich distinguishes those of the _Myrapetra_. A specimen of this nest\r\nmay be seen in the British Museum, and as the outer covering has been\r\npartially taken away, the observer will be enabled to note the general\r\nform of the combs and the structure of the cells.\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying illustration are shown the habitations of two\r\nremarkable insects, both belonging to the _Hymenoptera_. Indeed, the\r\ngreater number of pensile nests made by insects are formed by members\r\nof this important order; and, if we were to exclude all the wasps,\r\nbees, and ants, we should find that we had excluded about ninety per\r\ncent. of the pensile architects.\r\n\r\nThe left-hand figure represents a nest made by a species of _Polybia_,\r\ninhabiting Brazil. It is made of a papery kind of substance, of rather\r\nslight texture, and is fixed to the stalk of a reed. The outside of the\r\nnest is seen to be marked with a series of horizontal ribs. These show\r\nthe progressive stages of the nest, each rib marking a layer of paper\r\nas it was spread by the insect builder. The combs extend throughout the\r\nentire nest, the largest occupying the centre, and the smallest the\r\nends. Each comb is firmly supported by a footstalk, which is fixed, not\r\nto the upper tier of cells, as is the case with the British wasps, but\r\nto the reed on which the nest is built.\r\n\r\nOther species of _Polybia_ build nests different in shape and\r\narrangement, though still of the pensile character. One species builds\r\na nearly globular nest, made in a rather curious manner. Carrying out\r\nstill farther the principle on which the cardboard wasp enlarges its\r\nnest, the _Polybia_ entirely covers the outer wall with cells, and\r\nthen makes a new wall over them. When a nest has reached a tolerable\r\nsize, it is composed of a whole series of concentric combs, the roof of\r\neach having been originally the outer wall of the nest. There are in\r\nthe British Museum some admirable specimens of these nests, in some of\r\nwhich the process of enlargement can be very clearly traced. Patches of\r\nnew cells are seen upon the external covering, while a few breaches in\r\nthe structure show the concentric combs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nests of Polybia.]\r\n\r\nOne very curious point about these cells is, that they are not uniform\r\nin their direction, as is generally the case with those of social\r\nhymenoptera. The greater part, such as the various wasps, hornets, and\r\ntheir kin, have the mouths of the cells downwards, while the cells of\r\nthe hive-bee are nearly horizontal. But the cells of this insect are\r\narranged without the least regard to their position, all the bases\r\npointing towards the centre of the nest, and all the mouths radiating\r\noutwards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nests of Synæca and Polybia.]\r\n\r\nThere seems to be scarcely any bound to the variety which exists in the\r\nnests of the social hymenoptera. The insect which makes the nest which\r\nis represented in the illustration is a native of Brazil, and is known\r\nto entomologists as _Synæca cyanea_. The first of these names is given\r\nto it on account of its social habits, and the second, in reference to\r\nthe bluish colour of its body. It is rather larger than the preceding\r\ninsects, being about three quarters of an inch in length. Its wings are\r\nbrown.\r\n\r\nThe shape and size of the nest are exceedingly variable, but it is\r\nalmost invariably longer than wide, and is fixed to a branch or some\r\nsimilar object. Sometimes it attains considerable dimensions, and has\r\nbeen known to measure a full yard in length. Yet, however large it may\r\nbe, there is only a single comb, which is set upon the side of the nest\r\nnext the branch, and, in consequence, has almost all its cells placed\r\nin a horizontal direction. In the illustration, the right-hand figure\r\nrepresents the external appearance of the nest, and the central figure\r\nshows the manner in which the single comb is set upon the branch. The\r\nnest which occupies the left hand of the illustration is made by a\r\nspecies of _Polybia_, and is here given in order to show a remarkable\r\nexample of similarity in the mode of building adopted by two different\r\ninsects. In the one case, however, the cells are all fastened by their\r\nbases to the branch, but in the other the cells are attached to one\r\ncommon base which is prolonged into a footstalk.\r\n\r\nThere have been lately discovered some very remarkable social nests.\r\nSpecimens of both these nests may be seen in the entomological\r\ndepartment of the museum at Oxford.\r\n\r\nThe first is formed very much like a rather flattened Florence flask,\r\nand is hung by the neck from the branch of a tree. It is made of a\r\nstrong, parchment-like substance, formed by innumerable silken threads\r\nwoven and matted together into a kind of felt. When it was cut open a\r\nmost singular sight was exhibited. Nearly the whole of the interior\r\nwas covered with the pupæ of some butterfly, all hanging by their\r\ntails, and many of them suspended to a twig which projected downwards\r\ninto the nest. Although the nest is barely eight inches in length, a\r\ngreat proportion of which is taken up by the neck, about one hundred\r\npupæ were found in it. At the bottom of the nest is a small and nearly\r\ncircular aperture, through which the insects could make their way as\r\nsoon as they escaped from the pupal envelope, and before their wings\r\nbecame extended and hardened.\r\n\r\nThe butterfly which makes this singular nest is a native of Mexico, and\r\nis named _Eucheira socialis_. The colour of its wings is dark brown,\r\nwith an ill-defined white band across them.\r\n\r\nThe second nest was brought from tropical Africa, and is remarkable\r\nfor another peculiarity. It is shaped much like a cushion, and its\r\nmeasurements are, eight inches in length, five and a half in breadth,\r\nand three in depth. Instead of having only one place of exit for the\r\ninmates, it has thirteen or fourteen, all formed in the same manner. A\r\nnumber of short, stiff, and almost bristly threads are set round the\r\napertures, their ends all projecting outwards, and converging to a\r\npoint, where they all meet and even slightly cross each other. Owing to\r\nthis structure, it is easy enough for any of the insects to pass out,\r\nas the converging hairs yield to the pressure, whereas they form an\r\neffectual barrier against any insect that wishes to creep into the nest.\r\n\r\nThe material of the nest is very strong and hard, and is formed of two\r\nlayers, the inner being made of smooth brown silk, and the outer of\r\nharsher and stronger orange silk threads.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER V._\r\n\r\nARCHITECTURE OF THE HIVE-BEE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Part of a Honeycomb, and Bees at work.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the hive-bee (_Apis mellifica_) has engaged the attention\r\nof the curious from the earliest ages, recent discoveries prove that\r\nwe are yet only beginning to arrive at a correct knowledge of its\r\nwonderful proceedings. Pliny informs us that Astromachus, of Soles, in\r\nCilicia, devoted fifty-eight years to the study; and that Philiscus the\r\nThracian spent his whole life in forests for the purpose of observing\r\nthem. But in consequence (as we may naturally infer) of the imperfect\r\nmethods of research, assuming that what they did discover was known to\r\nAristotle, Columella, and Pliny, we are justified in pronouncing the\r\nstatements of these philosophers, as well as the embellished poetical\r\npictures of Virgil, to be nothing more than conjecture, almost in every\r\nparticular erroneous. It was not indeed till 1711, when glass hives\r\nwere invented by Maraldi, a mathematician of Nico, that what we may\r\ncall the in-door proceedings of bees could be observed. This important\r\ninvention was soon afterwards taken advantage of by M. Réaumur, who\r\nlaid the foundation of the more recent discoveries of John Hunter,\r\nSchirach, and the Hubers. The admirable architecture which bees\r\nexhibit in their miniature cities has, by these and other naturalists,\r\nbeen investigated with great care and accuracy. We shall endeavour\r\nto give as full an account of the wonderful structures as our limits\r\nwill allow. In this we shall chiefly follow M. Huber the elder, whose\r\nresearches appear almost miraculous when we consider that he was blind.\r\n\r\nAt the early age of seventeen this remarkable man lost his sight by\r\n_gutta serena_, the \"drop serene\" of our own Milton. But though cut off\r\nfrom the sight of Nature's works, he dedicated himself to their study.\r\nHe saw them through the eyes of the admirable woman whom he married;\r\nhis philosophical reasonings pointed out to her all that he wanted to\r\nascertain; and as she reported to him from time to time the results\r\nof his ingenious experiments, he was enabled to complete, by diligent\r\ninvestigation, one of the most accurate and satisfactory accounts of\r\nthe habits of bees which had ever been produced.\r\n\r\nIt had long been known that the bees of a hive consist of three sorts,\r\nwhich was ascertained by M. Réaumur to be distinguished as workers or\r\nneuters, constituting the bulk of the population; drones or males, the\r\nleast numerous class; and a single female, the queen and mother of\r\nthe colony. Schirach subsequently discovered the very extraordinary\r\nfact, which Huber and others have proved beyond doubt, that when a\r\nhive is accidentally deprived of a queen, the grub of a worker can be\r\nand is fed in a particular manner so as to become a queen and supply\r\nthe loss.[Z] But another discovery of M. Huber is of more importance\r\nto the subject of architecture now before us. By minute research he\r\nascertained that the workers which had been considered by former\r\nnaturalists to be all alike, are divided into two important classes,\r\nnurse-bees and wax-makers.\r\n\r\nThe _nurse-bees_ are rather smaller than the wax-workers, and even\r\nwhen gorged with honey their belly does not, as in the others, appear\r\ndistended. Their business is to collect honey, and impart it to their\r\ncompanions; to feed and take care of the young grubs, and to complete\r\nthe combs and cells which have been founded by the others; but they are\r\nnot charged with provisioning the hive.\r\n\r\nThe _wax-workers_, on the other hand, are not only a little larger,\r\nbut their stomach, when gorged with honey, is capable of considerable\r\ndistension, as M. Huber proved by repeated experiments. He also\r\nascertained that neither of the varieties can alone fulfil all the\r\nfunctions shared among the workers of a hive. He painted those of each\r\nclass with different colours, in order to study their proceedings,\r\nand their labours were not interchanged. In another experiment, after\r\nsupplying a hive deprived of a queen with brood and pollen, he saw the\r\nnurse-bees quickly occupied in the nutrition of the grubs, while those\r\nof the wax-working class neglected them. When hives are full of combs,\r\nthe wax-workers disgorge their honey into the ordinary magazines,\r\nmaking no wax; but if they want a reservoir for its reception, and if\r\ntheir queen does not find cells ready made wherein to lay her eggs,\r\nthey retain the honey in the stomach, and in twenty-four hours they\r\nproduce wax. Then the labour of constructing combs begins.\r\n\r\nIt might perhaps be supposed that, when the country does not afford\r\nhoney, the wax-workers consume the provision stored up in the hive. But\r\nthey are not permitted to touch it. A portion of honey is carefully\r\npreserved, and the cells containing it are protected by a waxen\r\ncovering, which is never removed except in case of extreme necessity,\r\nand when honey is not to be otherwise procured. The cells are at\r\nno time opened during summer; other reservoirs, always exposed,\r\ncontribute to the daily use of the community; each bee, however,\r\nsupplying itself from them with nothing but what is required for\r\npresent wants. Wax-workers appear with large bellies at the entrance of\r\ntheir hive only when the country affords a copious collection of honey.\r\nFrom this it may be concluded that the production of the waxy matter\r\ndepends on a concurrence of circumstances not invariably subsisting.\r\nNurse-bees also produce wax, but in a very inferior quantity to what\r\nis elaborated by the real wax-workers. Another characteristic whereby\r\nan attentive observer can determine the moment of bees collecting\r\nsufficient honey to produce wax, is the strong odour of both these\r\nsubstances from the hive, which is not equally intense at any other\r\ntime. From such data, it was easy for M. Huber to discover whether\r\nthe bees worked in wax in his own hives, and in those of the other\r\ncultivators of the district.\r\n\r\nThere is still another sort of bee, first observed by Huber in 1809,\r\nwhich appear to be only casual inmates of the hive, and which are\r\ndriven forth to starve, or are killed in conflict. They closely\r\nresemble the ordinary workers, but are less hairy, and of a much darker\r\ncolour. These have been called _black bees_, and are supposed by Huber\r\nto be defective bees;[AA] but Kirby and Spence conjecture that they are\r\ntoil-worn superannuated workers, of no further use, and are therefore\r\nsacrificed, because burdensome to a community which tolerates no\r\nunnecessary inmates.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreparation of Wax.\r\n\r\nIn order to build the beautiful combs, which every one must\r\nhave repeatedly seen and admired, it is indispensable that the\r\narchitect-bees should be provided with the materials--with the wax,\r\nin short, of which they are principally formed. Before we follow\r\nthem, therefore, to the operation of building, it may be necessary\r\nto inquire how the wax itself is procured. Here the discoveries of\r\nrecent inquirers have been little less singular and unexpected than\r\nin other departments of the history of these extraordinary insects.\r\nNow that it has been proved that wax is secreted by bees, it is not a\r\nlittle amusing to read the accounts given by our elder naturalists, of\r\nits being collected from flowers. Our countryman, Thorley,[AB] appears\r\nto have been the first who suspected the true origin of wax, and\r\nWildman (1769) seems also to have been aware of it; but Réaumur, and\r\nparticularly Bonnet, though both of them in general shrewd and accurate\r\nobservers, were partially deceived by appearances.\r\n\r\nThe bees, we are erroneously told, search for wax \"upon all sorts of\r\ntrees and plants, but especially the rocket, the simple poppy, and\r\nin general all kinds of flowers. They amass it with their hair, with\r\nwhich their whole body is invested. It is something pleasant to see\r\nthem roll in the yellow dust which falls from the chives to the bottom\r\nof the flowers, and then return covered with the same grains; but\r\ntheir best method of gathering the wax, especially when it is not very\r\nplentiful, is to carry away all the little particles of it with their\r\njaws and fore feet, to press the wax upon them into little pellets,\r\nand slide them one at a time, with their middle feet, into a socket or\r\ncavity, that opens at their hinder feet, and serves to keep the burthen\r\nfixed and steady till they return home. They are sometimes exposed to\r\ninconveniences in this work by the motion of the air, and the delicate\r\ntexture of the flowers, which bend under their feet and hinder them\r\nfrom packing up their booty, on which occasions they fix themselves in\r\nsome steady place, where they press the wax into a mass, and wind it\r\nround their legs, making frequent returns to the flowers; and when they\r\nhave stocked themselves with a sufficient quantity, they immediately\r\nrepair to their habitation. Two men, in the compass of a whole day,\r\ncould not amass so much as two little balls of wax; and yet they are no\r\nmore than the common burthen of a single bee, and the produce of one\r\njourney. Those who are employed in collecting the wax from flowers\r\nare assisted by their companions, who attend them at the door of the\r\nhive, ease them of their load at their arrival, brush their feet, and\r\nshake out the two balls of wax; upon which the others return to the\r\nfields to gather new treasure, while those who disburthened them convey\r\ntheir charge to the magazine. But some bees, again, when they have\r\nbrought their load home, carry it themselves to the lodge, and there\r\ndeliver it, laying hold of one end by their hinder feet, and with their\r\nmiddle feet sliding it out of the cavity that contained it; but this\r\nis evidently a work of supererogation which they are not obliged to\r\nperform. The packets of wax continue a few moments in the lodge, till\r\na set of officers come, who are charged with a third commission, which\r\nis to knead this wax with their feet, and spread it out into different\r\nsheets, laid one above another. This is the unwrought wax, which is\r\neasily distinguished to be the produce of different flowers, by the\r\nvariety of colours that appear on each sheet. When they afterwards\r\ncome to work, they knead it over again; they purify and whiten, and\r\nthen reduce it to a uniform colour. They use this wax with a wonderful\r\nfrugality; for it is easy to observe that the whole family is conducted\r\nby prudence, and all their actions regulated by good government.\r\nEverything is granted to necessity, but nothing to superfluity; not\r\nthe least grain of wax is neglected, and if they waste it, they are\r\nfrequently obliged to provide more; at those very times when they want\r\nto get their provision of honey, they take off the wax that closed the\r\ncells, and carry it to the magazine.\"[AC]\r\n\r\nRéaumur hesitated in believing that this was a correct view of the\r\nsubject, from observing the great difference between wax and pollen;\r\nbut he was inclined to think the pollen might be swallowed, partially\r\ndigested, and disgorged in the form of a kind of paste. Schirach also\r\nmentions, that it was remarked by a certain Lusatian, that wax comes\r\nfrom the rings of the body, because, on withdrawing a bee while it is\r\nat work, and extending its body, the wax may be seen there in the form\r\nof scales.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated John Hunter shrewdly remarked that the pellets of pollen\r\nseen on the thighs of bees are of different colours on different bees,\r\nwhile the shade of the new-made comb is always uniform; and therefore\r\nhe concluded that pollen was not the origin of wax. Pollen also, he\r\nobserved, is collected with greater avidity for old hives, where the\r\ncomb is complete, than for those where it is only begun, which would\r\nhardly be the case were it the material of wax. He found that when the\r\nweather was cold and wet in June, so that a young swarm was prevented\r\nfrom going abroad, as much comb was constructed as had been made in an\r\nequal time when the weather was favourable and fine.\r\n\r\nThe pellets of pollen on the thighs being thence proved not to be\r\nwax, he came to the conclusion that it was an external secretion,\r\noriginating between the plates of the belly. When he first observed\r\nthis, he felt not a little embarrassed to explain the phenomenon, and\r\ndoubted whether new plates were forming, or whether bees cast their old\r\nones as lobsters do their shell. By melting the scales, he ascertained\r\nat least that they were wax; and his opinion was confirmed by the fact,\r\nthat the scales are only to be found during the season when the combs\r\nare constructed. But he did not succeed in completing the discovery by\r\nobserving the bees actually detach the scales, though he conjectured\r\nthey might be taken up by others, if they were once shaken out from\r\nbetween the rings.[AD]\r\n\r\nWe need not be so much surprised at mistakes committed upon this\r\nsubject, when we recollect that honey itself was believed by the\r\nancients to be an emanation of the air--a dew that descended upon\r\nflowers, as if it had a limited commission to fall only on them. The\r\nexposure and correction of error is one of the first steps to genuine\r\nknowledge; and when we are aware of the stumbling-blocks which have\r\ninterrupted the progress of others, we can always travel more securely\r\nin the way of truth.\r\n\r\nThat wax is secreted is proved both by the wax-pouches within the\r\nrings of the abdomen, and by actual experiment. Huber and others fed\r\nbees entirely upon honey or sugar, and, notwithstanding, wax was\r\nproduced and combs formed as if they had been at liberty to select\r\ntheir food. \"When bees were confined,\" says M. Huber, \"for the purpose\r\nof discovering whether honey was sufficient for the production of\r\nwax, they supported their captivity patiently, and showed uncommon\r\nperseverance in rebuilding their combs as we removed them. Our\r\nexperiments required the presence of grubs; honey and water had to be\r\nprovided; the bees were to be supplied with combs containing brood, and\r\nat the same time it was necessary to confine them, that they might not\r\nseek pollen abroad. Having a swarm by chance, which had become useless\r\nfrom sterility of the queen, we devoted it for our investigation in one\r\nof my leaf-hives, which was glazed on both sides. We removed the queen,\r\nand substituted combs containing eggs and young grubs, but no cell with\r\nfarina; even the smallest particle of the substance which John Hunter\r\nconjectured to be the basis of the nutriment of the young was taken\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing remarkable occurred during the first and second day: the bees\r\nbrooded over the young, and seemed to take an interest in them; but at\r\nsunset on the third a loud noise was heard in the hive. Impatient to\r\ndiscover the reason, we opened a shutter, and saw all in confusion;\r\nthe brood was abandoned, the workers ran in disorder over the combs,\r\nthousands rushed towards the lower part of the hive, and those about\r\nthe entrance gnawed at its grating. Their design was not equivocal;\r\nthey wished to quit their prison. Some imperious necessity evidently\r\nobliged them to seek elsewhere what they could not find in the hive;\r\nand apprehensive that they might perish if I restrained them longer\r\nfrom yielding to their instinct, I set them at liberty. The whole\r\nswarm escaped, but the hour being unfavourable for their collections,\r\nthey flew around the hive, and did not depart far from it. Increasing\r\ndarkness and the coolness of the air compelled them very soon to\r\nreturn. Probably these circumstances calmed their agitation; for\r\nwe observed them peaceably remounting their combs; order seemed\r\nre-established, and we took advantage of this moment to close the hive.\r\n\r\n\"Next day, the 19th of July, we saw the rudiments of two royal cells,\r\nwhich the bees had formed on one of the brood-combs. This evening, at\r\nthe same hour as on the preceding, we again heard a loud buzzing in\r\nthe closed hive; agitation and disorder rose to the highest degree,\r\nand we were again obliged to let the swarm escape. The bees did not\r\nremain long absent from their habitation; they quieted and returned\r\nas before. We remarked on the 20th that the royal cells had not been\r\ncontinued, as would have been the case in the ordinary state of\r\nthings. A great tumult took place in the evening; the bees appeared to\r\nbe in a delirium; we set them at liberty, and order was restored on\r\ntheir return. Their captivity having endured five days, we thought it\r\nneedless to protract it farther; besides, we were desirous of knowing\r\nwhether the brood was in a suitable condition, and if it had made the\r\nusual progress; and we wished also to try to discover what might be\r\nthe cause of the periodical agitation of the bees. M. Burnens (the\r\nassistant of Huber), having exposed the two brood-combs, the royal\r\ncells were immediately recognised; but it was obvious that they had\r\nnot been enlarged. Why should they? Neither eggs, grubs, nor that kind\r\nof paste peculiar to the individuals of their species were there! The\r\nother cells were vacant likewise; no brood, not an atom of paste, was\r\nin them. Thus, the worms had died of hunger. Had we precluded the bees\r\nfrom all means of sustenance by removing the farina? To decide this\r\npoint, it was necessary to confide other brood to the care of the\r\nsame insects, now giving them abundance of pollen. They had not been\r\nenabled to make any collections while we examined their combs. On this\r\noccasion they escaped in an apartment where the windows were shut; and\r\nafter substituting young worms for those they had allowed to perish,\r\nwe returned them to their prison. Next day we remarked that they had\r\nresumed courage; they had consolidated the combs, and remained on the\r\nbrood. They were then provided with fragments of combs, where other\r\nworkers had stored up farina; and to be able to observe what they did\r\nwith it, we took this substance from some of their cells, and spread\r\nit on the board of the hive. The bees soon discovered both the farina\r\nin the combs and what we had exposed to them. They crowded to the\r\ncells, and also descending to the bottom of the hives, took the pollen\r\ngrain by grain in their teeth, and conveyed it to their mouths. Those\r\nthat had eaten it most greedily mounted the combs before the rest,\r\nand stopping on the cells of the young worms, inserted their heads,\r\nand remained there for a certain time. M. Burnens opened one of the\r\ndivisions of the hive gently, and powdered the workers, for the purpose\r\nof recognising them when they should ascend the combs. He observed them\r\nduring several hours, and by this means ascertained that they took\r\nso great a quantity of pollen only to impart it to their young. Then\r\nwithdrawing the portions of comb which had been placed by us on the\r\nboard of the hive, we saw that the pollen had been sensibly diminished\r\nin quantity. They were returned to the bees, to augment their provision\r\nstill further, for the purpose of extending the experiment. The royal,\r\nas well as several common, cells were soon closed; and, on opening the\r\nhive, all the worms were found to have prospered. Some still had their\r\nfood before them; the cells of others that had spun were shut with a\r\nwaxen covering.\r\n\r\n\"We witnessed these facts repeatedly, and always with equal interest.\r\nThey so decisively prove the regard of the bees towards the grubs which\r\nthey are intrusted with rearing, that we shall not seek for any other\r\nexplanation of their conduct. Another fact, no less extraordinary,\r\nand much more difficult to be accounted for, was exhibited by bees\r\nconstrained to work in wax, several times successively, from the syrup\r\nof sugar. Towards the close of the experiment they ceased to feed the\r\nyoung, though in the beginning these had received the usual attention.\r\nThey even frequently dragged them from their cells, and carried them\r\nout of the hive.\"[AE]\r\n\r\nMr. Wiston, of Germantown, in the United States, mentions a fact\r\nconclusive on this subject. \"I had,\" says he, \"a late swarm last\r\nsummer, which, in consequence of the drought, filled only one box with\r\nhoney. As it was late in the season, and the food collected would not\r\nenable the bees to subsist for the winter, I shut up the hive, and gave\r\nthem half-a-pint of honey every day. They immediately set to work,\r\nfilled the empty cells, and then constructed new cells enough to fill\r\nanother box, in which they deposited the remainder of the honey.\"\r\n\r\nA more interesting proof is thus related by the same gentleman: \"In the\r\nsummer of 1824, I traced some wild bees, which had been feeding on the\r\nflowers in my meadow, to their home in the woods, and which I found in\r\nthe body of an oak-tree, exactly fifty feet above the ground. Having\r\ncaused the entrance to the hive to be closed by an expert climber,\r\nthe limbs were separated in detail, until the trunk alone was left\r\nstanding. To the upper extremity of this, a tackle-fall was attached so\r\nas to connect it with an adjacent tree, and, a saw being applied below,\r\nthe naked trunk was cut through. When the immense weight was lowered\r\nnearly to the earth, the ropes broke, and the mass fell with a violent\r\ncrash. The part of the tree which contained the hive, separated by the\r\nsaw, was conveyed to my garden, and placed in a vertical position. On\r\nbeing released, the bees issued out by thousands, and though alarmed,\r\nsoon became reconciled to the change of situation. By removing a part\r\nof the top of the block the interior of the hive was exposed to view,\r\nand the comb itself, nearly six feet in height, was observed to have\r\nfallen down two feet below the roof of the cavity. To repair the\r\ndamage was the first object of the labourers: in doing which, a large\r\npart of their store of honey was expended, because it was at too late\r\na season to obtain materials from abroad. In the following February\r\nthese industrious but unfortunate insects issuing in a confused manner\r\nfrom the hive, fell dead in thousands around its entrance, the victims\r\nof a poverty created by their efforts to repair the ruins of their\r\nhabitation.\"[AF]\r\n\r\nIn another experiment, M. Huber confined a swarm so that they had\r\naccess to nothing beside honey, and five times successively removed the\r\ncombs with the precaution of preventing the escape of the bees from\r\nthe apartment. On each occasion they produced new combs, which puts it\r\nbeyond dispute that honey is sufficient to effect the secretion of wax\r\nwithout the aid of pollen. Instead of supplying the bees with honey,\r\nthey were subsequently fed, exclusively, on pollen and fruit; but\r\nthough they were kept in captivity for eight days under a bell-glass,\r\nwith a comb containing nothing but farina, they neither made wax nor\r\nwas any secreted under the rings. In another series of experiments, in\r\nwhich bees were fed with different sorts of sugar, it was found that\r\nnearly one-sixth of the sugar was converted into wax, dark-coloured\r\nsugar yielding more than double the quantity of refined sugar.\r\n\r\nIt may not be out of place to subjoin the few anatomical and\r\nphysiological facts which have been ascertained by Huber, Maddle,\r\nJurine, and Latreille.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Worker-bee, magnified--showing the position of the\r\nscales of Wax.]\r\n\r\nThe first stomach of the worker-bee, according to Latreille,[AG] is\r\nappropriated to the reception of honey, but this is never found in the\r\nsecond stomach, which is surrounded with muscular rings, and from one\r\nend to the other very much resembles a cask covered with hoops. It is\r\nwithin these rings that the wax is produced; but the secreting vessels\r\nfor this purpose have hitherto escaped the researches of the acutest\r\nnaturalists. Huber, however, plausibly enough conjectures that they are\r\ncontained in the internal lining of the wax-pockets, which consists\r\nof a cellular substance reticulated with hexagons. The wax-pockets\r\nthemselves, which are concealed by the overlapping of the rings, may\r\nbe seen by pressing the abdomen of a worker-bee so as to lengthen it,\r\nand separate the rings further from each other. When this has been\r\ndone, there may be seen on each of the four intermediate hoops of\r\nthe belly, and separated by what may be called the keel (_carina_),\r\ntwo whitish-coloured pouches, of a soft texture, and in the form of\r\na trapezium. Within, the little plates or scales of wax are produced\r\nfrom time to time, and are removed and employed as we shall presently\r\nsee. We may remark, that it is chiefly the wax-workers which produce\r\nthe wax; for though the nurse-bees are furnished with wax-pockets, they\r\nsecrete it only in very small quantities; while in the queen-bee, and\r\nthe males or drones, no pockets are discoverable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen of Wax-worker Bee.]\r\n\r\n\"All the scales,\" says Huber, \"are not alike in every bee, for a\r\ndifference is perceptible in consistence, shape, and thickness; some\r\nare so thin and transparent as to require a magnifier to be recognised,\r\nor we have been able to discover nothing but spiculæ similar to those\r\nof water freezing. Neither the spiculæ nor the scales rest immediately\r\non the membrane of the pocket, a slight liquid medium is interposed,\r\nserving to lubricate the joinings of the rings, or to render the\r\nextraction of the scales easier, as otherwise they might adhere too\r\nfirmly to the sides of the pockets.\" M. Huber has seen the scales so\r\nlarge as to project beyond the rings, being visible without stretching\r\nthe segments, and of a whitish yellow, from greater thickness lessening\r\ntheir transparency. These shades of difference in the scales of various\r\nbees, their enlarged dimensions, the fluid interposed beneath them, the\r\ncorrespondence between the scale and the size and form of the pockets,\r\nseem to infer the oozing of this substance through the membranes\r\nwhereon it is moulded. He was confirmed in this opinion by the escape\r\nof a transparent fluid on piercing the membrane, whose internal surface\r\nseemed to be applied to the soft parts of the belly. This he found\r\ncoagulated in cooling, when it resembled wax, and again liquefied on\r\nexposure to heat. The scales themselves, also, melted and coagulated\r\nlike wax.[AH]\r\n\r\nBy chemical analysis, however, it appears that the wax of the rings\r\nis a more simple substance than that which composes the cells; for\r\nthe latter is soluble in ether, and in spirit of turpentine, while\r\nthe former is insoluble in ether, and but partially soluble in spirit\r\nof turpentine. It should seem to follow, that if the substance found\r\nlying under the rings be really the elements of wax, it undergoes\r\nsome subsequent preparation after it is detached; and that the bees,\r\nin short, are capable of impregnating it with matter, imparting to it\r\nwhiteness and ductility, whereas in its unprepared state it is only\r\nfusible.\r\n\r\n\r\nPropolis.\r\n\r\nWax is not the only material employed by bees in their architecture.\r\nBeside this, they make use of a brown, odoriferous, resinous substance,\r\ncalled _propolis_,[AI] more tenacious and extensible than wax, and\r\nwell adapted for cementing and varnishing. It was strongly suspected\r\nby Réaumur that the bees collected the propolis from those trees which\r\nare known to produce a similar gummy resin, such as the poplar, the\r\nbirch, and the willow; but he was thrown into doubt by not being able\r\nto detect the bees in the act of procuring it, and by observing them\r\nto collect it where none of those trees, nor any other of the same\r\ndescription, grew. His bees also refused to make use of bitumen, and\r\nother resinous substances, with which he supplied them, though Mr.\r\nKnight, as we shall afterwards see, was more successful.[AJ]\r\n\r\nLong before the time of Réaumur, however, Mouffet, in his _Insectarum\r\nTheatrum_, quotes Cordus for the opinion that propolis is collected\r\nfrom the buds of trees, such as the poplar and birch; and Reim says\r\nit is collected from the pine and fir.[AK] Huber at length set\r\nthe question at rest; and his experiments and observations are so\r\ninteresting, that we shall give them in his own words:--\r\n\r\n\"For many years,\" says he, \"I had fruitlessly endeavoured to find them\r\non trees producing an analogous substance, though multitudes had been\r\nseen returning laden with it.\r\n\r\n\"In July, some branches of the wild poplar, which had been cut since\r\nspring, with very large buds, full of a reddish, viscous, odoriferous\r\nmatter, were brought to me, and I planted them in vessels before hives,\r\nin the way of the bees going out to forage, so that they could not be\r\ninsensible of their presence. Within a quarter of an hour, they were\r\nvisited by a bee, which separating the sheath of a bud with its teeth,\r\ndrew out threads of the viscous substance, and lodged a pellet of it\r\nin one of the baskets of its limbs; from another bud it collected\r\nanother pellet for the opposite limb, and departed to the hive. A\r\nsecond bee took the place of the former in a few minutes, following\r\nthe same procedure. Young shoots of poplar, recently cut, did not seem\r\nto attract these insects, as their viscous matter had less consistence\r\nthan the former.[AL]\r\n\r\n\"Different experiments proved the identity of this substance with the\r\npropolis; and now, having only to discover how the bees applied it to\r\nuse, we peopled a hive, so prepared as to fulfil our views. The bees,\r\nbuilding upwards, soon reached the glass above; but, unable to quit\r\ntheir habitation, on account of rain, they were three weeks without\r\nbringing home propolis. Their combs remained perfectly white until\r\nthe beginning of July, when the state of the atmosphere became more\r\nfavourable for our observations. Serene, warm weather engaged them to\r\nforage, and they returned from the fields laden with a resinous gum,\r\nresembling a transparent jelly, and having the colour and lustre of\r\nthe garnet. It was easily distinguished from the farinaceous pellets\r\nthen collected by other bees. The workers bearing the propolis ran over\r\nthe clusters, suspended from the roof of the hive, and rested on the\r\nrods supporting the combs, or sometimes stopped on the sides of their\r\ndwelling, in expectation of their companions coming to disencumber them\r\nof their burthen. We actually saw two or three arrive, and carry the\r\npropolis from off the limbs of each with their teeth. The upper part\r\nof the hive exhibited the most animated spectacle; thither a multitude\r\nof bees resorted from all quarters, to engage in the predominant\r\noccupation of the collection, distribution, and application of the\r\npropolis. Some conveyed that of which they had unloaded the purveyors\r\nin their teeth, and deposited it in heaps; others hastened, before its\r\nhardening, to spread it out like a varnish, or formed it into strings,\r\nproportioned to the interstices of the sides of the hives to be filled\r\nup. Nothing could be more diversified than the operations carried on.\r\n\r\n\"The bees, apparently charged with applying the propolis within the\r\ncells, were easily distinguished from the multitude of workers, by the\r\ndirection of their heads towards the horizontal pane forming the roof\r\nof the hive, and on reaching it, they deposited their burthen nearly\r\nin the middle of intervals separating the combs: then they conveyed\r\nthe propolis to the real place of its destination. They suspended\r\nthemselves by the claws of the hind legs to points of support, afforded\r\nby the viscosity of the propolis on the glass; and, as it were,\r\nswinging themselves backwards and forwards, brought the heap of this\r\nsubstance nearer to the cells at each impulse. Here the bees employed\r\ntheir fore feet, which remained free, to sweep what the teeth had\r\ndetached, and to unite the fragments scattered over the glass, which\r\nrecovered all its transparency when the whole propolis was brought to\r\nthe vicinity of the cells.\r\n\r\n\"After some of the bees had smoothed down and cleaned out the glazed\r\ncells, feeling the way with their antennæ, one desisted, and having\r\napproached a heap of propolis, drew out a thread with its teeth. This\r\nbeing broken off, it was taken in the claws of the fore feet, and the\r\nbee, re-entering the cell, immediately placed it in the angle of two\r\nportions that had been smoothed, in which operation the fore feet and\r\nteeth were used alternately; but probably proving too clumsy, the\r\nthread was reduced and polished; and we admired the accuracy with which\r\nit was adjusted when the work was completed. The insect did not stop\r\nhere: returning to the cell, it prepared other parts of it to receive\r\na second thread, for which we did not doubt that the heap would be\r\nresorted to. Contrary to our expectation, however, it availed itself\r\nof the portion of the thread cut off on the former occasion, arranged\r\nit in the appointed place, and gave it all the solidity and finish\r\nof which it was susceptible. Other bees completed the work which the\r\nfirst had begun: and the sides of the cells were speedily secured with\r\nthreads of propolis, while some were also put on the orifices; but we\r\ncould not seize the moment when they were varnished, though it may be\r\neasily conceived how it is done.\"[AM]\r\n\r\nThis is not the only use to which bees apply the propolis. They are\r\nextremely solicitous to remove such insects or foreign bodies as happen\r\nto get admission into the hive. When so light as not to exceed their\r\npowers, they first kill the insect with their stings, and then drag it\r\nout with their teeth. But it sometimes happens, as was first observed\r\nby Maraldi, and since by Réaumur and others, that an ill-fated slug\r\ncreeps into the hive: this is no sooner perceived than it is attacked\r\non all sides, and stung to death. But how are the bees to carry out\r\nso heavy a burthen? Such a labour would be in vain. To prevent the\r\nnoxious smell which would arise from its putrefaction, they immediately\r\nembalm it, by covering every part of its body with propolis, through\r\nwhich no effluvia can escape. When a snail with a shell gets entrance,\r\nto dispose of it gives much less trouble and expense to the bees. As\r\nsoon as it receives the first wound from a sting, it naturally retires\r\nwithin its shell. In this case, the bees, instead of pasting it all\r\nover with propolis, content themselves with gluing all round the\r\nmargin of the shell, which is sufficient to render the animal for ever\r\nimmovably fixed.\r\n\r\nMr. Knight, the learned and ingenious President of the Horticultural\r\nSociety, discovered by accident an artificial substance, more\r\nattractive than any of the resins experimentally tried by Réaumur.\r\nHaving caused the decorticated part of a tree to be covered with a\r\ncement composed of bees'-wax and turpentine, he observed that this was\r\nfrequented by hive-bees, who, finding it to be a very good propolis\r\nready made, detached it from the tree with their mandibles, and then,\r\nas usual, passed it from the first leg to the second, and so on. When\r\none bee had thus collected its load, another often came behind and\r\ndespoiled it of all it had collected; a second and a third load were\r\nfrequently lost in the same manner; and yet the patient insect pursued\r\nits operations without manifesting any signs of anger.[AN] Probably\r\nthe latter circumstance, at which Mr. Knight seems to have been\r\nsurprised, was nothing more than an instance of the division of labour\r\nso strikingly exemplified in every part of the economy of bees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Structure of the legs of the Bee, for carrying propolis\r\nand pollen, magnified.]\r\n\r\nIt may not be out of place here to describe the apparatus with which\r\nthe worker-bees are provided for the purpose of carrying the propolis\r\nas well as the pollen of flowers to the hive, and which has just been\r\nalluded to in the observations of Mr. Knight. The shin or middle\r\nportion of the hind pair of legs is actually formed into a triangular\r\nbasket, admirably adapted to this design. The bottom of this basket is\r\ncomposed of a smooth, shining, horn-like substance, hollowed out in\r\nthe substance of the limb, and surrounded with a margin of strong and\r\nthickly-set bristles. Whatever materials, therefore, may be placed by\r\nthe bee in the interior of this basket, are secured from falling out by\r\nthe bristles around it, whose elasticity will even allow the load to be\r\nheaped beyond their points without letting it fall.\r\n\r\nIn the case of propolis, when the bee is loading her singular basket,\r\nshe first kneads the piece she has detached with her mandibles, till it\r\nbecomes somewhat dry and less adhesive, as otherwise it would stick to\r\nher limbs. This preliminary process sometimes occupies nearly half an\r\nhour. She then passes it backwards by means of her feet to the cavity\r\nof her basket, giving it two or three pats to make it adhere; and when\r\nshe adds a second portion to the first, she often finds it necessary to\r\npat it still harder. When she has procured as much as the basket will\r\nconveniently hold, she flies off with it to the hive.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Building of the Cells.\r\n\r\nThe notion commonly entertained respecting glass hives is altogether\r\nerroneous. Those who are unacquainted with bees, imagine that, by\r\nmeans of a glass hive, all their proceedings may be easily watched and\r\nrecorded; but it is to be remembered that bees are exceedingly averse\r\nto the intrusion of light, and their first operation in such cases\r\nis to close up every chink by which light can enter to disturb them,\r\neither by clustering together, or by a plaster composed of propolis.\r\nIt consequently requires considerable management and ingenuity, even\r\nwith the aid of a glass hive, to see them actually at work. M. Huber\r\nemployed a hive with leaves, which opened in the manner of a book; and\r\nfor some purposes he used a glass box, inserted in the body of the\r\nhive, but easily brought into view by means of screws.\r\n\r\nBut no invention hitherto contrived is sufficient to obviate every\r\ndifficulty. The bees are so eager to afford mutual assistance, and\r\nfor this purpose so many of them crowd together in rapid succession,\r\nthat the operations of individuals can seldom be traced. Though this\r\ncrowding, however, appears to an observer to be not a little confused,\r\nit is all regulated with admirable order, as has been ascertained by\r\nRéaumur and other distinguished naturalists.\r\n\r\nWhen bees begin to build the hive, they divide themselves into bands,\r\none of which produces materials for the structure; another works\r\nupon these, and forms them into a rough sketch of the dimensions and\r\npartitions of the cells. All this is completed by the second band, who\r\nexamine and adjust the angles, remove the superfluous wax, and give\r\nthe work its necessary perfection; and a third band brings provisions\r\nto the labourers, who cannot leave their work. But no distribution of\r\nfood is made to those whose charge, in collecting propolis and pollen,\r\ncalls them to the field, because it is supposed they will hardly forget\r\nthemselves; neither is any allowance made to those who begin the\r\narchitecture of the cells. Their province is very troublesome, because\r\nthey are obliged to level and extend, as well as cut and adjust the\r\nwax to the dimensions required; but then they soon obtain a dismission\r\nfrom this labour, and retire to the fields to regale themselves with\r\nfood, and wear off their fatigue with a more agreeable employment.\r\nThose who succeed them, draw their mouth, their feet, and the extremity\r\nof their body, several times over all the work, and never desist till\r\nthe whole is polished and completed; and as they frequently need\r\nrefreshments, and yet are not permitted to retire, there are waiters\r\nalways attending, who serve them with provisions when they require\r\nthem. The labourer who has an appetite, bends down his trunk before the\r\ncaterer to intimate that he has an inclination to eat, upon which the\r\nother opens his bag of honey, and pours out a few drops: these may be\r\ndistinctly seen rolling through the hole of his trunk, which insensibly\r\nswells in every part the liquor flows through. When this little repast\r\nis over, the labourer returns to his work, and his body and feet repeat\r\nthe same motions as before.[AO]\r\n\r\nBefore they can commence building, however, when a colony or swarm\r\nmigrates from the original hive to a new situation, it is necessary\r\nfirst to collect propolis, with which every chink and cranny in the\r\nplace where they mean to build may be carefully stopped up; and\r\nsecondly, that a quantity of wax be secreted by the wax-workers to\r\nform the requisite cells. The secretion of wax, it would appear, goes\r\non best when the bees are in a state of repose; and the wax-workers,\r\naccordingly, suspend themselves in the interior in an extended cluster,\r\nlike the curtain which is composed of a series of intertwined festoons\r\nor garlands, crossing each other in all directions--the uppermost bee\r\nmaintaining its position by laying hold of the roof with its fore legs,\r\nand the succeeding one by laying hold of the hind legs of the first.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Curtain of Wax-workers secreting wax.]\r\n\r\n\"A person,\" says Réaumur, \"must have been born devoid of curiosity not\r\nto take interest in the investigation of such wonderful proceedings.\"\r\nYet Réaumur himself seems not to have understood that the bees\r\nsuspended themselves in this manner to secrete wax, but merely, as he\r\nimagined, to recruit themselves by rest for renewing their labours.\r\nThe bees composing the festooned curtain are individually motionless;\r\nbut this curtain is, notwithstanding, kept moving by the proceedings\r\nin the interior; for the nurse-bees never form any portion of it,\r\nand continue their activity--a distinction with which Réaumur was\r\nunacquainted.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are many thousand labourers in a hive, they do not\r\ncommence foundations for combs in several places at once, but wait\r\ntill an individual bee has selected a site, and laid the foundation of\r\na comb, which serves as a directing mark for all that are to follow.\r\nWere we not expressly told by so accurate an observer as Huber, we\r\nmight hesitate to believe that bees, though united in what appears\r\nto be an harmonious monarchy, are strangers to subordination, and\r\nsubject to no discipline. Hence it is, that though many bees work on\r\nthe same comb, they do not appear to be guided by any simultaneous\r\nimpulse. The stimulus which moves them is successive. An individual\r\nbee commences each operation, and several others successively apply\r\nthemselves to accomplish the same purpose. Each bee appears, therefore,\r\nto act individually, either as directed by the bees preceding it,\r\nor by the state of advancement in which it finds the work it has to\r\nproceed with. If there be anything like unanimous consent, it is the\r\ninaction of several thousand workers while a single individual proceeds\r\nto determine and lay down the foundation of the first comb. Réaumur\r\nregrets that, though he could by snatches detect a bee at work in\r\nfounding cells or perfecting their structure, his observations were\r\ngenerally interrupted by the crowding of other bees between him and\r\nthe little builder. He was therefore compelled rather to infer the\r\ndifferent steps of their procedure from an examination of the cells\r\nwhen completed, than from actual observation. The ingenuity of Huber,\r\neven under all the disadvantages of blindness, succeeded in tracing the\r\nminutest operations of the workers from the first waxen plate of the\r\nfoundation. We think the narrative of the discoverer's experiments,\r\nas given by himself, will be more interesting than any abstract of it\r\nwhich we could furnish:--\r\n\r\n\"Having taken a large bell-shaped glass receiver, we glued thin wooden\r\nslips to the arch at certain intervals, because the glass itself was\r\ntoo smooth to admit of the bees supporting themselves on it. A swarm,\r\nconsisting of some thousand workers, several hundred males, and a\r\nfertile queen, was introduced, and they soon ascended to the top.\r\nThose first gaining the slips fixed themselves there by the fore-feet;\r\nothers, scrambling up the sides, joined them, by holding their legs\r\nwith their own, and they thus formed a kind of chain, fastened by the\r\ntwo ends to the upper parts of the receiver, and served as ladders or a\r\nbridge to the workers enlarging their number. The latter were united in\r\na cluster, hanging like an inverted pyramid from the top to the bottom\r\nof the hive.\r\n\r\n\"The country then affording little honey, we provided the bees with\r\nsyrup of sugar, in order to hasten their labour. They crowded to the\r\nedge of a vessel containing it; and, having satisfied themselves,\r\nreturned to the group. We were now struck with the absolute repose of\r\nthis hive, contrasted with the usual agitation of bees. Meanwhile,\r\nthe nurse-bees alone went to forage in the country; they returned\r\nwith pollen, kept guard at the entrance of the hive, cleansed it, and\r\nstopped up its edges with propolis. The wax-workers remained motionless\r\nabout fifteen hours: the curtain of bees, consisting always of the same\r\nindividuals, assured us that none replaced them. Some hours later, we\r\nremarked that almost all these individuals had wax scales under the\r\nrings; and next day this phenomenon was still more general. The bees\r\nforming the external layer of the cluster, having now somewhat altered\r\ntheir position, enabled us to see their bellies distinctly. By the\r\nprojection of the wax scales, the rings seemed edged with white. The\r\ncurtain of bees became rent in several places, and some commotion began\r\nto be observed in the hive.\r\n\r\n\"Convinced that the combs would originate in the centre of the swarm,\r\nour whole attention was then directed towards the roof of the glass. A\r\nworker at this time detached itself from one of the central festoons\r\nof the cluster, separated itself from the crowd, and, with its head,\r\ndrove away the bees at the beginning of the row in the middle of the\r\narch, turning round to form a space an inch or more in diameter, in\r\nwhich it might move freely. It then fixed itself in the centre of the\r\nspace thus cleared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wax-worker laying the foundation of the first Cell.]\r\n\r\n\"The worker now employing the pincers at the joint of one of the third\r\npair of its limbs, seized a scale of wax projecting from a ring, and\r\nbrought it forward to its mouth with the claws of its fore-legs, where\r\nit appeared in a vertical position. We remarked that, with its claws,\r\nit turned the wax in every necessary direction; that the edge of the\r\nscale was immediately broken down, and the fragments having been\r\naccumulated in the hollow of the mandibles, issued forth like a very\r\nnarrow ribbon, impregnated with a frothy liquid by the tongue. The\r\ntongue itself assumed the most varied shapes, and executed the most\r\ncomplicated operations,--being sometimes flattened like a trowel, and\r\nat other times pointed like a pencil; and, after imbuing the whole\r\nsubstance of the ribbon, pushed it forward again into the mandibles,\r\nwhence it was drawn out a second time, but in an opposite direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Curtain of Wax-workers (see p. 132).]\r\n\r\n\"At length the bee applied these particles of wax to the vault of the\r\nhive, where the saliva impregnating them promoted their adhesion, and\r\nalso communicated a whiteness and opacity which were wanting when the\r\nscales were detached from the rings. Doubtless this process was to give\r\nthe wax that ductility and tenacity belonging to its perfect state.\r\nThe bee then separated those portions not yet applied to use with\r\nits mandibles, and with the same organs afterwards arranged them at\r\npleasure. The founder bee, a name appropriated to this worker, repeated\r\nthe same operation, until all the fragments, worked up and impregnated\r\nwith the fluid, were attached to the vault, when it repeated the\r\npreceding operations on the part of the scale yet kept apart, and\r\nagain united to the rest what was obtained from it. A second and third\r\nscale were similarly treated by the same bee; yet the work was only\r\nsketched; for the worker did nothing but accumulate the particles of\r\nwax together. Meanwhile the founder, quitting its position, disappeared\r\namidst its companions. Another, with wax under the rings, succeeded\r\nit, which suspending itself to the same spot, withdrew a scale by\r\nthe pincers of the hind legs, and passing it through its mandibles,\r\nprosecuted the work; and taking care to make its deposit in a line with\r\nthe former, it united their extremities. A third worker, detaching\r\nitself from the interior of the cluster, now came and reduced some of\r\nthe scales to paste, and put them near the materials accumulated by\r\nits companions, but not in a straight line. Another bee, apparently\r\nsensible of the defect, removed the misplaced wax before our eyes, and\r\ncarrying it to the former heap, deposited it there, exactly in the\r\norder and direction pointed out.\r\n\r\n\"From all these operations was produced a block of a rugged surface,\r\nhanging down from the arch, without any perceptible angle, or any\r\ntraces of cells. It was a simple wall, or ridge, running in a straight\r\nline, and without the least inflection, two-thirds of an inch in\r\nlength, above two-thirds of a cell, or two lines, high, and declining\r\ntowards the extremities. We have seen other foundation walls from an\r\ninch to an inch and a half long, the form being always the same; but\r\nnone ever of greater height.\r\n\r\n\"The vacuity in the centre of the cluster had permitted us to discover\r\nthe first manoeuvres of the bees, and the art with which they laid the\r\nfoundations of their edifices. However, it was filled up too soon for\r\nour satisfaction; for workers collecting on both faces of the wall\r\nobstructed our view of their further operations.\"[AP]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER VI._\r\n\r\nARCHITECTURE OF THE HIVE-BEE CONTINUED--FORM OF THE CELLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe obstruction of which M. Huber complains only operated as a\r\nstimulus to his ingenuity in contriving how he might continue his\r\ninteresting observations. From the time of Pappus to the present\r\nday, mathematicians have applied the principles of geometry to\r\nexplain the construction of the cells of a bee-hive; but though their\r\nextraordinary regularity, and wonderfully-selected form, had so often\r\nbeen investigated by men of the greatest talent, and skilled in all\r\nthe refinements of science, the process by which they are constructed,\r\ninvolving also the causes of their regularity of form, had not been\r\ntraced till M. Huber devoted himself to the inquiry.\r\n\r\nAs the wax-workers secrete only a limited quantity of wax, it is\r\nindispensably requisite that as little as possible of it should be\r\nconsumed, and that none of it should be wasted. Bees, therefore, as\r\nM. Réaumur well remarks,[AQ] have to solve this difficult geometrical\r\nproblem:--a quantity of wax being given, to form of it similar and\r\nequal cells of a determinate capacity, but of the largest size in\r\nproportion to the quantity of matter employed, and disposed in such\r\na manner as to occupy the least possible space in the hive. This\r\nproblem is solved by bees in all its conditions. The cylindrical form\r\nwould seem to be best adapted to the shape of the insect; but had\r\nthe cells been cylindrical, they could not have been applied to each\r\nother without leaving a vacant and superfluous space between every\r\nthree contiguous cells. Had the cells, on the other hand, been square\r\nor triangular, they might have been constructed without unnecessary\r\nvacancies; but these forms would have both required more material, and\r\nhave been very unsuitable to the shape of a bee's body. The six-sided\r\nform of the cells obviates every objection; and while it fulfils the\r\nconditions of the problem, it is equally adapted with a cylinder to the\r\nshape of the bee.\r\n\r\nM. Réaumur further remarks, that the base of each cell, instead of\r\nforming a plane, is usually composed of three pieces in the shape of\r\nthe diamonds on playing cards, and placed in such a manner as to form a\r\nhollow pyramid. This structure, it may be observed, imparts a greater\r\ndegree of strength, and, still keeping the solution of the problem\r\nin view, gives a great capacity with the smallest expenditure of\r\nmaterial. This has actually, indeed, been ascertained by mathematical\r\nmeasurement and calculation. Maraldi, the inventor of glass hives,\r\ndetermined, by minutely measuring these angles, that the greater were\r\n109° 28', and the smaller 70° 32'; and M. Réaumur, being desirous to\r\nknow why these particular angles are selected, requested M. Koenig, a\r\nskilful mathematician (without informing him of his design, or telling\r\nhim of Maraldi's researches), to determine by calculation what ought\r\nto be the angle of a six-sided cell, with a concave pyramidal base,\r\nformed of three similar and equal rhomboid plates, so that the least\r\npossible matter should enter into its construction. By employing what\r\ngeometricians denominate the _infinitesimal calculus_, M. Koenig found\r\nthat the angles should be 109° 26' for the greater, and 70° 34' for\r\nthe smaller, or about two-sixtieths of a degree, more or less, than\r\nthe actual angles made choice of by bees. The equality of inclination\r\nin the angles has also been said to facilitate the construction of the\r\ncells.\r\n\r\nM. Huber adds to these remarks, that the cells of the first row, by\r\nwhich the whole comb is attached to the roof of a hive, are not like\r\nthe rest; for, instead of six sides, they have only five, of which\r\nthe roof forms one. The base, also, is in these different, consisting\r\nof three pieces on the face of the comb, and on the other side of\r\ntwo: one of these only is diamond-shaped, while the other two are of\r\nan irregular four-sided figure. This arrangement, by bringing the\r\ngreatest number of points in contact with the interior surface, insures\r\nthe stability of the comb.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arrangement of Cells.]\r\n\r\nIt may, however, be said not to be quite certain, that Réaumur and\r\nothers have not ascribed to bees the merit of ingenious mathematical\r\ncontrivance and selection, when the construction of the cells may\r\nmore probably originate in the form of their mandibles and the other\r\ninstruments employed in their operations. In the case of other insects,\r\nwe have, both in the preceding and subsequent pages of this volume,\r\nrepeatedly noticed, that they use their bodies, or parts thereof, as\r\nthe standards of measurement and modelling; and it is not impossible\r\nthat bees may proceed on a similar principle. M. Huber replies to this\r\nobjection, that bees are not provided with instruments corresponding\r\nto the angles of their cells; for there is no more resemblance between\r\nthese and the form of their mandibles, than between the chisel of the\r\nsculptor and the work which he produces. The head, he thinks, does not\r\nfurnish any better explanation. He admits that the antennæ are very\r\nflexible, so as to enable the insects to follow the outline of every\r\nobject; but concludes that neither their structure, nor that of the\r\nlimbs and mandibles, are adequate to explain the form of the cells,\r\nthough all these are employed in the operations of building,--the\r\neffect, according to him, depending entirely on the object which the\r\ninsect proposes.\r\n\r\nWe shall now follow M. Huber in the experiments which he contrived, in\r\norder to observe the operations of the bees subsequent to their laying\r\na foundation for the first cell; and we shall again quote from his own\r\nnarrative:--\r\n\r\n\"It appeared to me,\" he says, \"that the only method of isolating\r\nthe architects, and bringing them individually into view, would be\r\nto induce them to change the direction of their operations and work\r\nupwards.\r\n\r\n\"I had a box made twelve inches square and nine deep, with a moveable\r\nglass lid. Combs, full of brood, honey, and pollen, were next selected\r\nfrom one of my leaf-hives, as containing what might interest the bees,\r\nand being cut into pieces a foot long, and four inches deep, they were\r\narranged vertically at the bottom of the box, at the same intervals\r\nas the insects themselves usually leave between them. A small slip\r\nof wooden lath covered the upper edge of each. It was not probable\r\nthat the bees would attempt to found new combs on the glass roof of\r\nthe box, because its smoothness precluded the swarm from adhering\r\nto it; therefore, if disposed to build, they could do so over the\r\nslips resting on the combs, which left a vacuity five inches high\r\nabove them. As we had foreseen, the swarm with which this box was\r\npeopled established itself among the combs below. We then observed the\r\nnurse-bees displaying their natural activity. They dispersed themselves\r\nthroughout the hive, to feed the young grubs, to clear out their\r\nlodgment, and adapt it for their convenience. Certainly, the combs,\r\nwhich were roughly cut to fit the bottom of the box, and in some parts\r\ndamaged, appeared to them shapeless and misplaced; for they speedily\r\ncommenced their reparation. They beat down the old wax, kneaded it\r\nbetween their teeth, and thus formed binding materials to consolidate\r\nthem. We were astonished beyond expression by such a multitude of\r\nworkers employed at once in labours to which it did not appear they\r\nshould have been called, at their coincidence, their zeal, and their\r\nprudence.\r\n\r\n\"But it was still more wonderful, that about half the numerous\r\npopulation took no part in the proceedings, remaining motionless, while\r\nthe others fulfilled the functions required. The wax-workers, in a\r\nstate of absolute repose, recalled our former observations. Gorged\r\nwith the honey we had put within their reach, and continuing in this\r\ncondition during twenty-four hours, wax was formed under their rings,\r\nand was now ready to be put in operation. To our great satisfaction,\r\nwe soon saw a little foundation-wall rising on one of the slips that\r\nwe had prepared to receive the superstructure. No obstacle was offered\r\nto the progress of our observations; and for the second time we beheld\r\nboth the undertaking of the founder-bee, and the successive labours\r\nof several wax-workers, in forming the foundation-wall. Would that my\r\nreaders could share the interest which the view of these architects\r\ninspired!\r\n\r\n\"This foundation, originally very small, was enlarged as the work\r\nrequired; while they excavated on one side a hollow, of about the width\r\nof a common cell, and on the opposite surface two others somewhat\r\nmore elongated. The middle of the single cell corresponded exactly to\r\nthe partition separating the latter: the arches of these excavations,\r\nprojecting by the accumulation of wax, were converted into ridges in a\r\nstraight line; whence the cells of the first row were composed of five\r\nsides, considering the slip as one side, and those of the second row,\r\nof six sides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Foundation-wall enlarged, and the Cells commenced.]\r\n\r\n\"The interior conformation of the cavities, apparently, was derived\r\nfrom the position of their respective outlines. It seemed that the\r\nbees, endowed with an admirable delicacy of feeling, directed their\r\nteeth principally to the place where the wax was thickest; that is, the\r\nparts where other workers on the opposite side had accumulated it; and\r\nthis explains why the bottom of the cell is excavated in an angular\r\ndirection behind the projection on the sides of which the sides of the\r\ncorresponding cells are to rise. The largest of the excavations, which\r\nwas opposite to three others, was divided into three parts, while the\r\nexcavations of the first row on the other face, applied against this\r\none, were composed of only two.\r\n\r\n\"In consequence of the manner in which the excavations were opposed\r\nto each other, those of the second row, and all subsequent, partially\r\napplied to three cavities, were composed of three equal diamond-shaped\r\nlozenges. I may here remark, that each part of the labour of bees\r\nappears the natural result of what has preceded it: therefore, chance\r\nhas no share in these admirable combinations.\r\n\r\n\"A foundation-wall rose above the slip like a minute vertical\r\npartition, five or six lines long, two lines high, but only half a\r\nline in thickness; the edge circular, and the surface rough. Quitting\r\nthe cluster among the combs, a nurse-bee mounted the slip, turned\r\naround the block, and visiting both sides, began to work actively\r\nin the middle. It removed as much wax with its teeth as might equal\r\nthe diameter of a common cell; and after kneading and moistening the\r\nparticles, deposited them on the edge of the excavation. This insect\r\nhaving laboured some seconds, retired, and was soon replaced by\r\nanother; a third continued the work, raising the margin of the edges,\r\nnow projecting from the cavity, and with assistance of its teeth and\r\nfeet fixing the particles, so as to give these edges a straighter form.\r\nMore than twenty bees successively participated in the same work; and\r\nwhen the cavity was little above a line and a half in height, though\r\nequalling a cell in width, a bee left the swarm, and after encircling\r\nthe block, commenced its operations on the opposite face, where\r\nyet untouched. But its teeth acting only on one half of this side,\r\nthe hollow which it formed was opposite to only one of the slight\r\nprominences bordering the first cavity. Nearly at the same time another\r\nworker began on the right of the face that had been untouched, wherein\r\nboth were occupied in forming cavities which may be designed the second\r\nand third; and they also were replaced by substitutes. These two latter\r\ncavities were separated only by the common margin, framed of particles\r\nof wax withdrawn from them; which margin corresponded with the centre\r\nof the cavity on the opposite surface. The foundation-wall itself was\r\nstill of insufficient dimensions to admit the full diameter of a cell:\r\nbut while the excavations were deepened, wax-workers, extracting their\r\nscales of wax, applied them in enlarging its circumference; so that it\r\nrose nearly two lines further around the circular arch. The nurse-bees,\r\nwhich appeared more especially charged with sculpturing the cells,\r\nbeing then enabled to continue their outlines, prolonged the cavities,\r\nand heightened their margins on the new addition of wax.\r\n\r\n\"The arch, formed by the edge of each of these cavities, was next\r\ndivided as by two equal chords, in the line of which the bees formed\r\nstages or projecting borders, or margins meeting at an obtuse angle:\r\nthe cavities now had four margins, two lateral and perpendicular to the\r\nsupporting slip, and two oblique, which were shorter.\r\n\r\n\"Meantime, it became more difficult to follow the operations of the\r\nbees, from their frequently interposing their heads between the eye of\r\nthe observer and the bottom of the cell; but the partition, whereon\r\ntheir teeth laboured, had become so transparent as to expose what\r\npassed on the other side.\r\n\r\n\"The cavities of which we speak formed the bottom of the first three\r\ncells; and while the bees engaged were advancing them to perfection,\r\nother workers commenced sketching a second row of cells above the\r\nfirst, and partly behind those in front--for, in general, their labour\r\nproceeds by combination. We cannot say, 'When bees have finished\r\nthis cell, they will begin new ones;' but, 'while particular workers\r\nadvance a certain portion, we are certain that others will carry on\r\nthe adjacent cells.' Further, the work begun on one face of the comb\r\nis already the commencement of that which is to follow on the reverse.\r\nAll this depends on a reciprocal relation, or a mutual connexion of the\r\nparts, rendering the whole subservient to each other. It is undoubted,\r\ntherefore, that slight irregularities on the front will affect the form\r\nof the cells on the back of the comb.\"[AR]\r\n\r\nWhen they have in this manner worked the bottoms of the first row of\r\ncells into the required forms, some of the nurse-bees finish them\r\nby imparting a sort of polish, while others proceed to cut out the\r\nrudiments of a second row from a fresh wall of wax which has been built\r\nin the meanwhile by the wax-workers, and also on the opposite side of\r\nthis wall; for a comb of cells is always double, being arranged in two\r\nlayers, placed end to end. The cells of this second row are engrafted\r\non the borders of cavities hollowed out in the wall, being founded\r\nby the nurse-bees, bringing the contour of all the bottoms, which is\r\nat first unequal, to the same level; and this level is kept uniform\r\nin the margins of the cells till they are completed. At first sight\r\nnothing appears more simple than adding wax to the margins; but from\r\nthe inequalities occasioned by the shape of the bottom, the bees must\r\naccumulate wax on the depressions, in order to bring them to a level.\r\nIt follows accordingly that the surface of a new comb is not quite\r\nflat, there being a progressive slope produced as the work proceeds,\r\nand the comb being therefore in the form of a lens, the thickness\r\ndecreasing towards the edge, and the last-formed cells being shallower\r\nor shorter than those preceding them. So long as there is room for the\r\nenlargement of the comb, this thinning of its edge may be remarked;\r\nbut as soon as the space within the hive prevents its enlargement, the\r\ncells are made equal, and two flat and level surfaces are produced.\r\n\r\nM. Huber observed, that while sketching the bottom of a cell, before\r\nthere was any upright margin on the reverse, their pressure on the\r\nstill soft and flexible wax gave rise to a projection, which sometimes\r\ncaused a breach of the partition. This, however, was soon repaired,\r\nbut a slight prominence always remained on the opposite surface, to\r\nthe right and left of which they placed themselves to begin a new\r\nexcavation; and they heaped up part of the materials between the two\r\nflutings formed by their labour. The ridge thus formed becomes a guide\r\nto the direction which the bees are to follow for their vertical furrow\r\nof the front cell.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that the first cell determines the place of all\r\nthat succeed it, and two of these are never, in ordinary circumstances,\r\nbegun in different parts of the hive at the same time, as is alleged\r\nby some early writers. When some rows of cells, however, have been\r\ncompleted in the first comb, two other foundation-walls are begun, one\r\non each side of it, at the exact distance of one-third of an inch,\r\nwhich is sufficient to allow two bees employed on the opposite cells to\r\npass each other without jostling. These new walls are also parallel to\r\nthe former; and two more are afterwards begun exterior to the second,\r\nand at the same parallel distance. The combs are uniformly enlarged,\r\nand lengthened in a progression proportioned to the priority of their\r\norigin; the middle comb being always advanced beyond the two adjoining\r\nones by several rows of cells, and these again beyond the ones exterior\r\nto them. Did the bees lay the foundations of all their combs at the\r\nsame time, they would not find it easy to preserve parallelism and an\r\nequality in their distances. It may be remarked further, that beside\r\nthe vacancies of half an inch between the cells, which form what we\r\ncall the highways of the community, the combs are pierced in several\r\nplaces with holes which serve as postern-gates for easy communication\r\nfrom one to another, to prevent loss of time in going round. The equal\r\ndistance between the combs is of more importance to the welfare of the\r\nhive than might at first appear; for were they too distant, the bees\r\nwould be so scattered and dispersed, that they could not reciprocally\r\ncommunicate the heat indispensable for hatching the eggs and rearing\r\nthe young. If the combs, on the other hand, were closer, the bees could\r\nnot traverse the intervals with the freedom necessary to facilitate the\r\nwork of the hive. On the approach of winter, they sometimes elongate\r\nthe cells which contain honey, and thus contract the intervals between\r\nthe combs. But this expedient is in preparation for a season when it\r\nis important to have copious magazines, and when, their activity being\r\nrelaxed, it is unnecessary for their communications to be so spacious\r\nand free. On the return of spring, the bees hasten to contract the\r\nelongated cells, that they may become fit for receiving the eggs which\r\nthe queen is about to deposit, and in this manner they re-establish the\r\nregular distance.[AS]\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to the late Dr. Barclay of Edinburgh, well known as an\r\nexcellent anatomist, for the discovery that each cell in a honeycomb is\r\nnot simply composed of one wall, but consists of two. We shall give the\r\naccount of his discovery in his own words:--\r\n\r\n\"Having inquired of several naturalists whether or not they knew any\r\nauthor who had mentioned that the partitions between the cells of the\r\nhoneycomb were double, and whether or not they had ever remarked such\r\na structure themselves, and they having answered in the negative, I\r\nnow take the liberty of presenting to the Society pieces of honeycomb,\r\nin which the young bees had been reared, upon breaking which, it will\r\nbe clearly seen that the partitions between different cells, at the\r\nsides and the base, are all _double_; or, in other words, that each\r\ncell is a distinct, separate, and in some measure an independent\r\nstructure, agglutinated only to the neighbouring cells; and that when\r\nthe agglutinating substance is destroyed, each cell may be entirely\r\nseparated from the rest.\r\n\r\n\"I have also some specimens of the cells formed by wasps, which\r\nshow that the partitions between them are also double, and that the\r\nagglutinating substance between them is more easily destroyed than that\r\nbetween the cells of the bee.\"[AT]\r\n\r\n\r\nIrregularities in their Workmanship.\r\n\r\nThough bees, however, work with great uniformity when circumstances\r\nfavour their operations, they may be compelled to vary their\r\nproceedings. M. Huber made several ingenious experiments of this kind.\r\nThe following, mentioned by Dr. Bevan, was accidental, and occurred to\r\nhis friend Mr. Walond. \"Inspecting his bee-boxes at the end of October,\r\n1817, he perceived that a centre comb, burthened with honey, had\r\nseparated from its attachments, and was leaning against another comb\r\nso as to prevent the passage of the bees between them. This accident\r\nexcited great activity in the colony; but its nature could not be\r\nascertained at the time. At the end of a week, the weather being cold,\r\nand the bees clustered together Mr. Walond observed, through the window\r\nof the box, that they had constructed two horizontal pillars betwixt\r\nthe combs alluded to, and had removed so much of the honey and wax from\r\nthe top of each as to allow the passage of a bee: in about ten days\r\nmore there was an uninterrupted thoroughfare; the detached comb at its\r\nupper part had been secured by a strong barrier, and fastened to the\r\nwindow with the spare wax. This being accomplished, the bees removed\r\nthe horizontal pillars first constructed, as being of no further\r\nuse.\"[AU]\r\n\r\nA similar anecdote is told by M. Huber. \"During the winter,\" says he,\r\n\"a comb in one of my bell-glass hives, having been originally insecure,\r\nfell down, but preserved its position parallel to the rest. The bees\r\nwere unable to fill up the vacuity left above it, because they do\r\nnot build combs of old wax, and none new could be then obtained. At\r\na more favourable season they would have engrafted a new comb on the\r\nold one; but now their provision of honey could not be spared for\r\nthe elaboration of this substance, which induced them to insure the\r\nstability of the comb by another process.\r\n\r\n\"Crowds of bees taking wax from the lower part of other combs, and even\r\ngnawing it from the surface of the orifices of the deepest cells, they\r\nconstructed so many irregular pillars, joists, or buttresses, between\r\nthe sides of the fallen comb, and others on the glass of the hive. All\r\nthese were artificially adapted to localities. Neither did they confine\r\nthemselves to repairing the accidents which their works had sustained.\r\nThey seemed to profit by the warning to guard against a similar\r\ncasualty.\r\n\r\n\"The remaining combs were not displaced; therefore, while solidly\r\nadhering by the base, we were greatly surprised to see the bees\r\nstrengthen their principal fixtures with old wax. They rendered them\r\nmuch thicker than before, and fabricated a number of new connections,\r\nto unite them more firmly to each other and to the sides of their\r\ndwelling. All this passed in the middle of January, a time that these\r\ninsects commonly keep in the upper part of their hive, and when work is\r\nno longer seasonable.\"[AV]\r\n\r\nM. Huber the younger shrewdly remarks, that the tendency to symmetry\r\nobservable in the architecture of bees does not hold so much in small\r\ndetails as in the whole work, because they are sometimes obliged to\r\nadapt themselves to particular localities. One irregularity leads on\r\nto another, and it commonly arises from mere accident, or from design\r\non the part of the proprietor of the bees. By allowing, for instance,\r\ntoo little interval between the spars for receiving the foundation of\r\nthe combs, the structure has been continued in a particular direction.\r\nThe bees did not at first appear to be sensible of the defect, though\r\nthey afterwards began to suspect their error, and were then observed to\r\nchange their line of work till they gained the customary distance. The\r\ncells having been by this change of direction in some degree curved,\r\nthe new ones which were commenced on each side of it, by being built\r\neverywhere parallel to it, partook of the same curvature. But the bees\r\ndid not relish such approaches to the \"line of beauty,\" and exerted\r\nthemselves to bring their buildings again into the regular form.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of several irregularities which they wished to correct,\r\nthe younger Huber has seen bees depart from their usual practice, and\r\nat once lay on a spar two foundation-walls not in the same line. They\r\ncould consequently neither be enlarged without obstructing both, nor\r\nfrom their position could the edges unite, had they been prolonged.\r\nThe little architects, however, had recourse to a very ingenious\r\ncontrivance: they curved the edges of the two combs, and brought them\r\nto unite so neatly that they could be both prolonged in the same line\r\nwith ease; and when carried to some little distance, their surface\r\nbecame quite uniform and level.\r\n\r\n\"Having seen bees,\" says the elder Huber, \"work both up and down, I\r\nwished to try to investigate whether we could compel them to construct\r\ntheir combs in any other direction. We endeavoured to puzzle them with\r\na hive glazed above and below, so that they had no place of support\r\nbut the upright sides of their dwelling; but, betaking themselves\r\nto the upper angle, they built combs perpendicular to one of these\r\nsides, and as regularly as those which they usually build under a\r\nhorizontal surface. The foundations were laid on a place which does\r\nnot serve naturally for the base, yet, except in the difference\r\nof direction, the first row of cells resembled those in ordinary\r\nhives, the others being distributed on both faces, while the bottoms\r\nalternately corresponded with the same symmetry. I put the bees to a\r\nstill greater trial. As they now testified their inclination to carry\r\ntheir combs, by the shortest way, to the opposite side of the hive (for\r\nthey prefer uniting them to wood, or a surface rougher than glass), I\r\ncovered it with a pane. Whenever this smooth and slippery substance was\r\ninterposed between them and the wood, they departed from the straight\r\nline hitherto followed, and bent the structure of their comb at a\r\nright angle to what was already made, so that the prolongation of the\r\nextremity might reach another side of the hive, which had been left\r\nfree.\r\n\r\n\"Varying this experiment in several ways, I saw the bees constantly\r\nchange the direction of their combs, when I presented to them a surface\r\ntoo smooth to admit of their clustering on it. They always sought the\r\nwooden sides. I thus compelled them to curve the combs in the strangest\r\nshapes, by placing a pane at a certain distance from their edges. These\r\nresults indicate a degree of instinct truly wonderful. They denote even\r\nmore than instinct: for glass is not a substance against which bees can\r\nbe warned by nature. In trees, their natural abode, there is nothing\r\nthat resembles it, or with the same polish. The most singular part of\r\ntheir proceeding is changing the direction of the work before arriving\r\nat the surface of the glass, and while yet at a distance suitable for\r\ndoing so. Do they anticipate the inconvenience which would attend any\r\nother mode of building? No less curious is the plan adopted by the\r\nbee for producing an angle in the combs: the wonted fashion of their\r\nwork, and the dimensions of the cells, must be altered. Therefore, the\r\ncells on the upper or convex side of the combs are enlarged; they are\r\nconstructed of three or four times the width of those on the opposite\r\nsurface. How can so many insects, occupied at once on the edges of the\r\ncombs, concur in giving them a common curvature from one extremity to\r\nthe other? How do they resolve on establishing cells so small on one\r\nside, while dimensions so enlarged are bestowed on those of the other?\r\nAnd is it not still more singular, that they have the art of making a\r\ncorrespondence between cells of such reciprocal discrepance? The bottom\r\nbeing common to both, the tubes alone assume a taper form. Perhaps no\r\nother insect has afforded a more decisive proof of the resources of\r\ninstinct, when compelled to deviate from the ordinary course.\r\n\r\n\"But let us study them in their natural state, and there we shall find\r\nthat the diameter of their cells must be adapted to the individuals\r\nwhich shall be bred in them. The cells of males have the same figure,\r\nthe same number of lozenges and sides, as those of workers, and angles\r\nof the same size. Their diameter is 3-1/3 lines, while those of workers\r\nare only 2-2/5.\r\n\r\n\"It is rarely that the cells of males occupy the higher part of the\r\ncombs. They are generally in the middle or on the sides, where they\r\nare not isolated. The manner in which they are surrounded by other\r\ncells alone can explain how the transition in size is effected. When\r\nthe cells of males are to be fabricated under those of workers, the\r\nbees make several rows of intermediate cells, whose diameter augments\r\nprogressively, until gaining that proportion proper to the cells\r\nrequired; and in returning to those of workers, a lowering is observed\r\nin a manner corresponding.\r\n\r\n\"Bees, in preparing the cells of males, previously establish a block or\r\nlump of wax on the edge of their comb, thicker than is usually employed\r\nfor those of workers. It is also made higher, otherwise the same order\r\nand symmetry could not be preserved on a larger scale.\r\n\r\n\"Several naturalists notice the irregularities in the cells of bees\r\nas so many defects. What would have been their astonishment had\r\nthey observed that part of them are the result of calculation? Had\r\nthey followed the imperfection of their organs, some other means\r\nof compensating them would have been granted to the insects. It is\r\nmuch more surprising that they know how to quit the ordinary route,\r\nwhen circumstances demand the construction of enlarged cells; and,\r\nafter building thirty or forty rows of them, to return to the proper\r\nproportions from which they have departed by successive reductions.\r\nBees also augment the dimensions of their cells when there is an\r\nopportunity for a great collection of honey. Not only are they then\r\nconstructed of a diameter much exceeding that of the common cells, but\r\nthey are elongated throughout the whole space admitting it. A great\r\nportion of irregular comb contains cells an inch, or even an inch and a\r\nhalf, in depth.\r\n\r\n\"Bees, on the contrary, sometimes are induced to shorten their cells.\r\nWhen wishing to prolong an old comb, whose cells have received their\r\nfull dimensions, they gradually reduce the thickness of its edges,\r\nby gnawing down the sides of the cells, until they restore it to its\r\noriginal lenticular form. They add a waxen block around the whole\r\ncircumference, and on the edge of the comb construct pyramidal bottoms,\r\nsuch as those fabricated on ordinary occasions. It is a certain fact,\r\nthat a comb never is extended in any direction unless the bees have\r\nthinned the edges, which are diminished throughout a sufficient space\r\nto remove any angular projection.\r\n\r\n\"The law which obliges these insects partly to demolish the cells on\r\nthe edges of the comb before enlarging it, unquestionably demands more\r\nprofound investigation. How can we account for instinct leading them to\r\nundo what they have executed with the utmost care? The wonted regular\r\ngradation which may be necessary for new cells, subsists among those\r\nadjoining the edges of a comb recently constructed. But afterwards,\r\nwhen those on the edge are deepened like the cells of the rest of the\r\nsurface, the bees no longer preserve the decreasing gradation which is\r\nseen in the new combs.\"[AW]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Finishing of the Cells.\r\n\r\nWhile the cells are building they appear to be of a dull white colour,\r\nsoft, even, though not smooth, and translucent; but in a few days they\r\nbecome tinged with yellow, particularly on the interior surface; and\r\ntheir edges, from being thin, uniform, and yielding, become thicker,\r\nless regular, more heavy, and so firm that they will bend rather\r\nthan break. New combs break on the slightest touch. There is also a\r\nglutinous substance observable around the orifices of the yellow cells,\r\nof reddish colour, unctuous, and odoriferous. Threads of the same\r\nsubstance are applied all around the interior of the cells, and at the\r\nsummit of their angles, as if it were for the purpose of binding and\r\nstrengthening the walls. These yellow cells also require a much higher\r\ntemperature of water to melt them than the white ones.\r\n\r\nIt appeared evident, therefore, that another substance, different from\r\nwax, had been employed in varnishing the orifices, and strengthening\r\nthe interior of the cells. M. Huber, by numerous experiments,\r\nascertained the resinous threads lining the cells, as well as the\r\nresinous substance around their orifice, to be propolis; for he traced\r\nthem, as we mentioned in our account of propolis, from the poplar\r\nbuds where they collected it, and saw them apply it to the cells; but\r\nthe yellow colour is not imparted by propolis, to which it bears no\r\nanalogy. We are, indeed, by no means certain what it is, though it\r\nwas proved by experiment not to arise from the heat of the hives, nor\r\nfrom emanations of honey, nor from particles of pollen. Perhaps it may\r\nbe ascribed to the bees rubbing their teeth, feet, and other parts of\r\ntheir body, on the surfaces where they seem to rest; or to their tongue\r\n(haustellum) sweeping from right to left like a fine pliant pencil,\r\nwhen it appears to leave some sprinkling of a transparent liquid.\r\n\r\nBesides painting and varnishing their cells in this manner, they take\r\ncare to strengthen the weaker part of their edifice by means of a\r\nmortar composed of propolis and wax, and named _pissoceros_[AX] by the\r\nancients who first observed it, though Réaumur was somewhat doubtful\r\nrespecting the existence of such a composition. We are indebted to the\r\nshrewd observations of Huber for a reconcilement of the Roman and the\r\nFrench naturalists. The details which he has given of his discovery are\r\nperhaps the most interesting in his delightful book.\r\n\r\n\"Soon,\" he says, \"after some new combs had been finished in a hive,\r\nmanifest disorder and agitation prevailed among the bees. They seemed\r\nto attack their own works. The primitive cells, whose structure we\r\nhad admired, were scarcely recognizable. Thick and massive walls,\r\nheavy, shapeless pillars, were substituted for the slight partitions\r\npreviously built with such regularity. The substance had changed along\r\nwith the form, being composed apparently of wax and propolis. From\r\nthe perseverance of the workers in their devastation, we suspected\r\nthat they proposed some useful alteration of their edifices; and our\r\nattention was directed to the cells least injured. Several were yet\r\nuntouched; but the bees soon rushed precipitately on them, destroyed\r\nthe tubes, broke down the wax, and threw all the fragments about.\r\nBut we remarked that the bottom of the cells of the first row were\r\nspared; neither were the corresponding parts on both faces of the comb\r\ndemolished at the same time. The bees laboured at them alternately,\r\nleaving some of the natural supports, otherwise the comb would have\r\nfallen down, which was not their object: they wished, on the contrary,\r\nto provide it a more solid base, and to secure its union to the vault\r\nof the hive, with a substance whose adhesive properties infinitely\r\nsurpassed those of wax. The propolis employed on this occasion had\r\nbeen deposited in a mass over a cleft of the hive, and had hardened\r\nin drying, which probably rendered it more suitable for the purpose.\r\nBut the bees experienced some difficulty in making any impression on\r\nit; and we thought, as also had appeared to M. de Réaumur, that they\r\nsoftened it with the same frothy matter from the tongue which they use\r\nto render wax more ductile.\r\n\r\n\"We very distinctly observed the bees mixing fragments of old wax with\r\nthe propolis, kneading the two substances together to incorporate\r\nthem; and the compound was employed in rebuilding the cells that had\r\nbeen destroyed. But they did not now follow their ordinary rules of\r\narchitecture, for they were occupied by the solidity of their edifices\r\nalone. Night intervening, suspended our observations, but next morning\r\nconfirmed what we had seen.\r\n\r\n\"We find, therefore, that there is an epoch in the labour of bees,\r\nwhen the upper foundation of their combs is constructed simply of wax,\r\nas Réaumur believed; and that, after all the requisite conditions\r\nhave been attained, it is converted to a mixture of wax and propolis,\r\nas remarked by Pliny so many ages before us. Thus is the apparent\r\ncontradiction between these two great naturalists explained. But this\r\nis not the utmost extent of the foresight of these insects. When they\r\nhave plenty of wax, they make their combs the full breadth of the hive,\r\nand solder them to the glass or wooden sides, by structures more or\r\nless approaching the form of cells, as circumstances admit. But should\r\nthe supply of wax fail before they have been able to give sufficient\r\ndiameter to the combs whose edges are rounded, large intervals remain\r\nbetween them and the upright sides of the hive, and they are fixed\r\nonly at the top. Therefore, did not the bees provide against it, by\r\nconstructing great pieces of wax mixed with propolis, in the intervals,\r\nthey might be borne down by the weight of the honey. These pieces are\r\nof irregular shape, strangely hollowed out, and their cavities void of\r\nsymmetry.\"[AY]\r\n\r\nIt is remarked by the lively Abbé la Pluche, that the foundations of\r\nour houses sink with the earth on which they are built, the walls\r\nbegin to stoop by degrees, they nod with age, and bend from their\r\nperpendicular;--lodgers damage everything, and time is continually\r\nintroducing some new decay. The mansions of the bees, on the contrary,\r\ngrow stronger the oftener they change inhabitants. Every bee-grub,\r\nbefore its metamorphosis into a nymph, fastens its skin to the\r\npartitions of its cell, but in such a manner as to make it correspond\r\nwith the lines of the angle, and without in the least disturbing the\r\nregularity of the figure. During summer, accordingly, the same lodging\r\nmay serve for three or four grubs in succession; and in the ensuing\r\nseason it may accommodate an equal number. Each grub never fails to\r\nfortify the panels of its chamber by arraying them with its spoils,\r\nand the contiguous cells receive a similar augmentation from its\r\nbrethren.[AZ] Réaumur found as many as seven or eight of these skins\r\nspread over one another: so that all the cells being incrusted with six\r\nor seven coverings, well dried and cemented with propolis, the whole\r\nfabric daily acquires a new degree of solidity.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, however, that by a repetition of this process the cell\r\nmight be rendered too contracted; but in such a case the bees know well\r\nhow to proceed, by turning the cells to other uses, such as magazines\r\nfor bee-bread and honey. It has been remarked, however, that in the\r\nhive of a new swarm, during the months of July and August, there are\r\nfewer small bees or nurse-bees than in one that has been tenanted four\r\nor five years. The workers, indeed, clean out the cell the moment that\r\na young bee leaves its cocoon, but they never detach the silky film\r\nwhich it has previously spun on the walls of its cell. But though honey\r\nis deposited after the young leave the cells, the reverse also happens;\r\nand accordingly, when bees are bred in contracted cells, they are by\r\nnecessity smaller, and constitute, in fact, the important class of\r\nnurse-bees.\r\n\r\nWe are not disposed, however, to go quite so far as an American\r\nperiodical writer, who says, \"Thus we see that the contraction of\r\nthe cell may diminish the size of a bee, _even to the extinction of\r\nlife_, just as the contraction of a Chinese shoe reduces the foot even\r\nto uselessness.\"[BA] We know, on the contrary, that the queen-bee\r\nwill not deposit eggs in a cell either too small or too large for the\r\nproper rearing of the young. In the case of large cells, M. Huber took\r\nadvantage of a queen that was busy depositing the eggs of workers to\r\nremove all the common cells adapted for their reception, and left only\r\nthe larger cells appropriated for males. As this was done in June, when\r\nbees are most active, he expected that they would have immediately\r\nrepaired the breaches he had made; but to his great surprise they did\r\nnot make the slightest movement for that purpose. In the meanwhile the\r\nqueen, being oppressed by her eggs, was obliged to drop them about at\r\nrandom, preferring this to depositing them in the male cells, which she\r\nknew to be too large. At length she did deposit six eggs in the large\r\ncells, which were hatched as usual three days after. The nurse-bees,\r\nhowever, seemed to be aware that they could not be reared there, and\r\nthough they supplied them with food, did not attend to them regularly.\r\nM. Huber found that they had been all removed from the cells during the\r\nnight, and the business both of laying and nursing was at a complete\r\nstand for twelve days, when he supplied them again with a comb of small\r\ncells, which the queen almost immediately filled with eggs, and in some\r\ncells she laid five or six.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[The accompanying illustration exhibits these three kinds of bees,\r\nnamely, the Queen, the Drone, and the Worker, together with the cells\r\nwhich they respectively inhabit. Fig. 1 shows the queen-bee as she\r\nappears when in command of a hive. When she first issues from the\r\nroyal cell, she is much smaller in the body, and an inexperienced\r\nobserver might have some difficulty in distinguishing her from an\r\nordinary worker. But any one who has been accustomed to bees can pick\r\nher out as soon as his eyes rest upon her. Her body is rather larger\r\nand narrower than those of the workers, and the wings are shorter in\r\nproportion, slightly crossing at the tips when she is at rest. Fig. 2\r\nrepresents the common worker-bee, which, as has already been mentioned,\r\nis simply an undeveloped female. Fig. 3 is the male or drone-bee, which\r\nis easily distinguishable, even by a novice. He is larger, stouter,\r\nand heavier built than the female; his eyes are so enormous that they\r\nseem to occupy nearly the entire head, and he has some well-defined\r\ntufts of hair on the end of the abdomen. He can even be detected by\r\nthe ear, as he flies, the deep droning hum being quite unlike the\r\nfussy, business-like sound produced by the worker. Fig. 4 represents\r\none of the royal cells, a little reduced in size. In making this cell,\r\nthe bees lose sight of their habitual economy of wax, and use enough\r\nmaterial for fifty ordinary cells. It is probable that the great size\r\nof the cell enables the inclosed insect to expand, and so to be capable\r\nof becoming the mother as well as the ruler of her subjects. The royal\r\ncell is always placed at the edge of a comb, so as not to interfere\r\nwith the other cells, which contain honey, bee-bread, and grubs; and\r\nin each hive there are generally several of these cells in different\r\nstages of structure. Figs. 5 and 6 represent the proportionate sizes of\r\nthe cells which contain the drone and worker bees.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe architecture of the hive, which we have thus detailed, is that of\r\nbees receiving the aid of human care, and having external coverings of\r\na convenient form, prepared for their reception. In this country bees\r\nare not found in a wild state; though it is not uncommon for swarms\r\nto stray from their proprietors. But these stray swarms do not spread\r\ncolonies through our woods, as they are said to do in America. In the\r\nremoter parts of that continent there are no wild bees. They precede\r\ncivilization; and thus when the Indians observe a swarm they say, \"The\r\nwhite man is coming.\" There is evidence of bees having abounded in\r\nthese islands, in the earlier periods of our history; and Ireland is\r\nparticularly mentioned by the Venerable Bede as being \"rich in milk and\r\nhoney.\"[BB] The hive-bee has formed an object of economical culture in\r\nEurope at least for two thousand years; and Varro describes the sort of\r\nhives used in his time, 1870 years ago. We are not aware, however, that\r\nit is now to be found wild in the milder clime of Southern Europe, any\r\nmore than it is in our own island.\r\n\r\nThe wild bees of Palestine principally hived in rocks. \"He made him,\"\r\nsays Moses, \"to suck honey out of the rock.\"[BC] \"With honey out of\r\nthe rock,\" says the Psalmist, \"should I have satisfied thee.\"[BD] In\r\nthe caves of Salsette and Elephanta, at the present day, they hive in\r\nthe clefts of the rocks, and the recesses among the fissures, in such\r\nnumbers as to become very troublesome to visitors. Their nests hang in\r\ninnumerable clusters.[BE]\r\n\r\nWe are told of a little black stingless bee found in the island of\r\nGuadaloupe, which hives in hollow trees or in the cavities of rocks by\r\nthe sea-side, and lays \"up honey in cells about the size and shape\r\nof pigeons' eggs. These cells are of a black or deep-violet colour,\r\nand so joined together as to leave no space between them. They hang\r\nin clusters almost like a bunch of grapes.\"[BF] The following are\r\nmentioned by Lindley as indigenous to Brazil. \"On an excursion towards\r\nUpper Tapagippe,\" says he, \"and skirting the dreary woods which extend\r\nto the interior, I observed the trees more loaded with bees' nests than\r\neven in the neighbourhood of Porto Seguro. They consist of a ponderous\r\nshell of clay, cemented similarly to martins' nests, swelling from\r\nhigh trees about a foot thick, and forming an oval mass full two feet\r\nin diameter. When broken, the wax is arranged as in our hives, and the\r\nhoney abundant.\"[BG]\r\n\r\nCaptain Basil Hall found in South America the hive of a honey-bee very\r\ndifferent from the Brazilian, but nearly allied to, if not the same as,\r\nthat of Guadaloupe. \"The hive we saw opened,\" he says, \"was only partly\r\nfilled, which enabled us to see the economy of the interior to more\r\nadvantage. The honey is not contained in the elegant hexagonal cells of\r\nour hives, but in wax bags, not quite so large as an egg. These bags or\r\nbladders are hung round the sides of the hive, and appear about half\r\nfull; the quantity being probably just as great as the strength of the\r\nwax will bear without tearing. Those near the bottom, being better\r\nsupported, are more filled than the upper ones. In the centre of the\r\nlower part of the hive we observed an irregularly-shaped mass of comb,\r\nfurnished with cells like those of our bees, all containing young ones\r\nin such an advanced state, that, when we broke the comb, and let them\r\nout, they flew merrily away.\"\r\n\r\nClavigero, in his 'History of Mexico,' evidently describing the same\r\nspecies of bee, says it abounds in Yucatan, and makes the honey of\r\nEstabentum, the finest in the world, and which is taken every two\r\nmonths. He mentioned another species of bee, smaller in size, and also\r\nwithout a sting, which forms its nest of the shape of a sugar-loaf, and\r\nas large or larger. These are suspended from trees, particularly from\r\nthe oak, and are much more populous than our common hives.\r\n\r\nWild honey-bees of some species appear also to abound in Africa. Mr.\r\nPark, in his second volume of travels, tells us that some of his\r\nassociates imprudently attempted to rob a numerous hive of its honey,\r\nwhen the exasperated bees, rushing out to defend their property,\r\nattacked their assailants with great fury, and quickly compelled the\r\nwhole company to fly.\r\n\r\nAt the Cape of Good Hope the bees themselves must be less formidable,\r\nor more easily managed, as their hives are sought for with avidity.\r\nNature has there provided man with a singular and very efficient\r\nassistant in a bird, most appropriately named the honey-guide\r\n(_Indicator major_, Veillot; _Cuculus indicator_, Latham). The\r\nhoney-guide, it is said, so far from being alarmed at the presence of\r\nman, appears anxious to court his acquaintance, and flits from tree\r\nto tree with an expressive note of invitation, the meaning of which\r\nis both well known to the colonists and the Hottentots. A person thus\r\ninvited by the honey-guide seldom refuses to follow it onward till\r\nit stops, as it is certain to do, at some hollow tree containing a\r\nbee-hive, usually well stored with honey and wax. It may be that\r\nthe bird finds itself inadequate to the attack of a legion of bees,\r\nor to penetrate into the interior of the hive, and is thence led to\r\ninvite an agent more powerful than itself. The person invited, indeed,\r\nalways leaves the bird a share of the spoil, as it would be considered\r\nsacrilege to rob it of its due, or in any way to injure so sacred a\r\nbird.\r\n\r\nUseful, however, as is the honey-guide, it must always be carefully\r\nwatched, and the traveller must not follow it without keeping his eyes\r\nwell open. For although, as a general fact, the bird will lead its\r\nfollowers to honey, it has a strange habit of leading them to the spot\r\nwhere lies hidden some dangerous animal. Sometimes it brings them to\r\na rhinoceros, wallowing in a mud pool. Sometimes it directs them to\r\na solitary buffalo, one of the most dangerous animals that Southern\r\nAfrica produces, and one which the natives fear but little less than\r\nthe lion itself. And more than once the too-confiding traveller has\r\nfollowed the honey-guide, and been led to a spot where was lying one of\r\nthe venomous serpents.\r\n\r\nThe Americans, who have not the African honey-guide, employ several\r\nwell-known methods to track bees to their hives. One of the most\r\ncommon though ingenious modes is to place a piece of bee-bread on a\r\nflat surface, a tile for instance, surrounding it with a circle of wet\r\nwhite paint. The bee, whose habit it is always to alight on the edge\r\nof any plane, has to travel through the paint to reach the bee-bread.\r\nWhen, therefore, she flies off, the observer can track her by the\r\nwhite on her body. The same operation is repeated at another place,\r\nat some distance from the first, and at right angles to the bee-line\r\njust ascertained. The position of the hive is easily determined, for it\r\nlies in the angle made by the intersection of the bee-lines. Another\r\nmethod is described in the 'Philosophical Transactions for 1721.' The\r\nbee-hunter decoys, by a bait of honey, some of the bees into his trap,\r\nand when he has secured as many as he judges will suit his purpose,\r\nhe encloses one in a tube, and, letting it fly, marks its course by\r\na pocket-compass. Departing to some distance, he liberates another,\r\nobserves its course, and in this manner determines the position of the\r\nhive, upon the principle already detailed. These methods of bee-hunting\r\ndepend upon the insect's habit of always flying in a right line to its\r\nhome. Those who have read Cooper's tale of the 'Prairie' must well\r\nremember the character of the bee-hunter, and the expression of \"lining\r\na bee to its hive.\"\r\n\r\nIn reading these and similar accounts of the bees of distant parts of\r\nthe world, we must not conclude that the descriptions refer to the\r\nsame species as the common honey-bee. There are numerous species of\r\nsocial bees, which, while they differ in many circumstances, agree in\r\nthe practice of storing up honey, in the same way as we have numerous\r\nspecies of the mason-bee and of the humble-bee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER VII._\r\n\r\nCARPENTRY OF TREE-HOPPERS AND SAW-FLIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe operations of an insect in boring into a leaf or a bud to form\r\na lodgment for its eggs appear very simple. The tools, however, by\r\nwhich these effects are performed are very complicated and curious.\r\nIn the case of gall-flies (_Cynips_), the operation itself is not so\r\nremarkable as its subsequent chemical effects. These effects are so\r\ndifferent from any others that may be classed under the head of Insect\r\nArchitecture, that we shall reserve them for the latter part of this\r\nvolume, although, with reference to the use of galls, the protection\r\nof eggs and larvæ, they ought to find a place here. We shall, however,\r\nat present confine ourselves to those which simply excavate a nest,\r\nwithout producing a tumour.\r\n\r\nThe first of these insects which we shall mention is celebrated for\r\nits song, by the ancient Greek poets, under the name of _Tettix_.\r\nThe Romans called it _Cicada_, which we sometimes, but erroneously,\r\ntranslate \"grasshopper;\" for the grasshoppers belong to an entirely\r\ndifferent order of insects. We shall, therefore, take the liberty of\r\ncalling the Cicadæ _Tree-hoppers_, to which the cuckoo-spit insect\r\n(_Tettigonia spumaria_, Oliv.) is allied; but there is only one of the\r\ntrue Cicadæ hitherto ascertained to be British, namely, the _Cicada\r\nhæmatodes_ (Linn.), which was discovered in the New Forest, Hampshire,\r\nby Mr. Daniel Bydder.\r\n\r\nM. Réaumur was exceedingly anxious to study the economy of these\r\ninsects; but they not being indigenous in the neighbourhood of Paris,\r\nhe commissioned his friends to send him some from more southern\r\nlatitudes, and he procured in this way specimens not only from the\r\nSouth of France and from Italy, but also from Egypt. From these\r\nspecimens he has given the best account of them yet published; for\r\nthough, as he tells us, he had never had the pleasure of seeing one\r\nof them alive, the most interesting parts of their structure can be\r\nstudied as well in dead as in living specimens. We ourselves possess\r\nseveral specimens from New Holland, upon which we have verified some of\r\nthe more interesting observations of Réaumur.\r\n\r\nVirgil tells us that in his time \"the cicadæ burst the very shrubs\r\nwith their querulous music;\"[BH] but we may well suppose that he was\r\naltogether unacquainted with the singular instrument by means of which\r\nthey can, not poetically, but actually, cut grooves in the branches\r\nthey select for depositing their eggs. It is the male, as in the case\r\nof birds, which fills the woods with his song; while the female, though\r\nmute, is no less interesting to the naturalist on account of her\r\ncurious ovipositor. This instrument, like all those with which insects\r\nare furnished by nature for cutting, notching, or piercing, is composed\r\nof a horny substance, and is also considerably larger than the size of\r\nthe tree-hopper would proportionally indicate. It can on this account\r\nbe partially examined without a microscope, being, in some of the\r\nlarger species, no less than five lines[BI] in length.\r\n\r\nThe ovipositor, or auger (_tarière_), as Réaumur calls it, is lodged in\r\na sheath which lies in a groove of the terminating ring of the belly.\r\nIt requires only a very slight pressure to cause the instrument to\r\nprotrude from its sheath, when it appears to the naked eye to be of\r\nequal thickness throughout, except at the point, where it is somewhat\r\nenlarged and angular, and on both sides finely indented with teeth. A\r\nmore minute examination of the sheath demonstrates that it is composed\r\nof two horny pieces slightly curved, and ending in the form of an\r\nelongated spoon, the concave part of which is adapted to receive the\r\nconvex end of the ovipositor.\r\n\r\nWhen the protruded instrument is further examined with a microscope,\r\nthe denticulations, nine in number on each side, appear strong, and\r\narranged with great symmetry, increasing in fineness towards the point,\r\nwhere there are three or four very small ones, beside the nine that\r\nare more obvious. The magnifier also shows that the instrument itself,\r\nwhich appeared simple to the naked eye, is, in fact, composed of three\r\ndifferent pieces; two exterior armed with the teeth before mentioned,\r\ndenominated by Réaumur files (_limes_), and another pointed like a\r\nlancet, and not denticulated. The denticulated pieces, moreover, are\r\ncapable of being moved forwards and backwards, while the centre one\r\nremains stationary; and as this motion is effected by pressing a pin\r\nor the blade of a knife over the muscles on either side at the origin\r\nof the ovipositor, it may be presumed that those muscles are destined\r\nfor producing similar movements when the insect requires them. By means\r\nof a finely-pointed pin carefully introduced between the pieces, and\r\npushed very gently downwards, they may be, with no great difficulty,\r\nseparated in their whole extent.\r\n\r\nThe contrivance by which those three pieces are held united, while at\r\nthe same time the two files can be easily put in motion, is similar\r\nto those of our own mechanical inventions, with this difference, that\r\nno human workman could construct an instrument of this description\r\nso small, fine, exquisitely polished, and fitting so exactly. We\r\nshould have been apt to form the grooves in the central piece, whereas\r\nthey are scooped out in the handles of the files, and play upon two\r\nprojecting ridges in the central piece, by which means this is rendered\r\nstronger. M. Réaumur discovered that the best manner of showing the\r\nplay of this extraordinary instrument is to cut it off with a pair of\r\nscissors near its origin, and then, taking it between the thumb and\r\nthe finger at the point of section, work it gently to put the files in\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nBeside the muscles necessary for the movement of the files, the handle\r\nof each is terminated by a curve of the same hard horny substance as\r\nitself, which not only furnishes the muscles with a sort of lever, but\r\nserves to press, as with a spring, the two files close to the central\r\npiece, as is shown in the lower figure.\r\n\r\nM. Pontedera, who studied the economy of the tree-hoppers with some\r\ncare, was anxious to see the insect itself make use of the ovipositor\r\nin forming grooves in wood, but found that it was so shy and easily\r\nalarmed, that it took to flight whenever he approached; a circumstance\r\nof which Réaumur takes advantage, to soothe his regret that the insects\r\nwere not indigenous in his neighbourhood. But of their workmanship,\r\nwhen completed, he had several specimens sent to him from Provence and\r\nLanguedoc by the Marquis de Caumont.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ovipositors, with files, of Tree-hopper, magnified.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Excavations for eggs of Tree-hopper, with the chip-lids\r\nraised.]\r\n\r\nThe gall-flies, when about to deposit their eggs, select growing plants\r\nand trees; but the tree-hoppers, on the contrary, make choice of dead,\r\ndried branches, for the mother seems to be aware that moisture would\r\ninjure her progeny. The branch, commonly a small one, in which eggs\r\nhave been deposited, may be recognised by being covered with little\r\noblong elevations caused by small splinters of the wood, detached at\r\none end, but left fixed at the other, by the insect. These elevations\r\nare for the most part in a line, rarely in a double line, nearly at\r\nequal distances from each other, and form a lid to a cavity in the wood\r\nabout four lines in length, containing from four to ten eggs. It is to\r\nbe remarked that the insect always selects a branch of such dimensions\r\nthat it can get at the pith, not because the pith is more easily\r\nbored, for it does not penetrate into it all, but to form a warm and\r\nsafe bed for the eggs. M. Pontedera says, that when the eggs have been\r\ndeposited, the insect closes the mouth of the hole with a gum capable\r\nof protecting them from the weather; but M. Réaumur thinks this only a\r\nfancy, as, out of a great number which he examined, he could discover\r\nnothing of the kind. Neither is such a protection wanted; for the woody\r\nsplinters above mentioned furnish a very good covering.\r\n\r\nThe grubs hatch from these eggs (of which, M. Pontedera says, one\r\nfemale will deposit from five to seven hundred), issue from the\r\nsame holes through which the eggs have been introduced, and betake\r\nthemselves to the ground to feed on the roots of plants. They are not\r\ntransformed into chrysalides, but into active nymphs, remarkable for\r\ntheir fore limbs, which are thick, strong, and furnished with prongs\r\nfor digging; and when we are told, by Dr. Le Ferve, that they make\r\ntheir way easily into hard stiff clay, to the depth of two or three\r\nfeet, we perceive how necessary to them such a conformation must be.\r\n\r\n\r\nSaw-flies.\r\n\r\nAn instrument for cutting grooves in wood, still more ingeniously\r\ncontrived than that of the tree-hopper, was first observed by\r\nVallisnieri, an eminent Italian naturalist, in a four-winged fly, most\r\nappropriately denominated by M. Réaumur the _saw-fly_ (_Tenthredo_) of\r\nwhich many sorts are indigenous to Great Britain. The grubs from which\r\nthese flies originate are indeed but too well known, as they frequently\r\nstrip our rose, gooseberry, raspberry, and red currant trees of their\r\nleaves, and are no less destructive to birch, alder, and willows;\r\nwhile turnips and wheat suffer still more seriously by their ravages.\r\nThese grubs may readily be distinguished from the caterpillars of\r\nmoths and butterflies by having from sixteen to twenty-eight feet, by\r\nwhich they usually hang to the leaf they feed on, while they coil up\r\nthe hinder part of their body in a spiral ring. The perfect flies are\r\ndistinguished by four transparent wings; and some of the most common\r\nhave a flat body of a yellow or orange colour, while the head and\r\nshoulders are black.\r\n\r\nIn order to see the ovipositor, to which we shall for the present turn\r\nour chief attention, a female saw-fly must be taken, and her belly\r\ngently pressed, when a narrow slit will be observed to open at some\r\ndistance from the apex, and a short, pointed, and somewhat curved body,\r\nof a brown colour and horny substance, will be protruded. The curved\r\nplates which form the sides of the slit are the termination of the\r\nsheath, in which the instrument lies concealed till it is wanted by the\r\ninsect. The appearance of this instrument, however, and its singular\r\nstructure, cannot be well understood without the aid of a microscope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _a_, Ovipositor of Saw-fly, protruded from its sheath,\r\nmagnified.]\r\n\r\nThe instrument thus brought into view is a very finely-contrived\r\nsaw, made of a horny substance, and adapted for penetrating branches\r\nand other parts of plants where the eggs are to be deposited. The\r\novipositor-saw of the insect is much more complicated than any of those\r\nemployed by our carpenters. The teeth of our saws are formed in a line,\r\nbut in such a manner as to cut in two lines parallel to, and at a\r\nsmall distance from, each other. This is effected by slightly bending\r\nthe points of the alternate teeth right and left, so that one-half\r\nof the whole teeth stand a little to the right, and the other half a\r\nlittle to the left. The distance of the two parallel lines thus formed\r\nis called the _course_ of the saw, and it is only the portion of wood\r\nwhich lies in the course that is cut into sawdust by the action of the\r\ninstrument. It will follow that in proportion to the thinness of a saw\r\nthere will be the less destruction of wood which may be sawed. When\r\ncabinet-makers have to divide valuable wood into very thin leaves, they\r\naccordingly employ saws with a narrow course, while sawyers who cut\r\nplanks use one with a broad course. The ovipositor-saw being extremely\r\nfine, does not require the teeth to diverge much; but from the manner\r\nin which they operate, it is requisite that they should not stand,\r\nlike those of our saws, in a straight line. The greater portion of the\r\nedge of the instrument, on the contrary, is towards the point somewhat\r\nconcave, similar to a scythe, while towards the base it becomes a\r\nlittle convex, the whole edge being nearly the shape of an Italic _f_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ovipositor-saw of Saw-fly, with rasps shown in the cross\r\nlines.]\r\n\r\nThe ovipositor-saw of the fly is put in motion in the same way as a\r\ncarpenter's hand-saw, supposing the tendons attached to its base to\r\nform the handle, and the muscles which put it in motion to be the\r\nhand of the carpenter. But the carpenter can only work one saw at a\r\ntime, whereas each of these flies is furnished with two, equal and\r\nsimilar, which it works at the same time--one being advanced and the\r\nother retracted alternately. The secret, indeed, of working more saws\r\nthan one at once is not unknown to our mechanics; for two or three are\r\nsometimes fixed in the same frame. These, however, not only all move\r\nupwards and downwards simultaneously, but cut the wood in different\r\nplaces; while the two saws of the ovipositor work in the same cut,\r\nand consequently, though the teeth are extremely fine, the effect is\r\nsimilar to a saw with a wide set.\r\n\r\nIt is important, seeing that the ovipositor-saws are so fine, that they\r\nbe not bent or separated while in operation--and this, also, nature has\r\nprovided for, by lodging the backs of the saws in a groove, formed by\r\ntwo membranous plates, similar to the structure of a clasp-knife. These\r\nplates are thickest at the base, becoming gradually thinner as they\r\napproach the point, which the form of the saws requires. According to\r\nVallisnieri, it is not the only use of this apparatus to form a back\r\nfor the saws, he having discovered, between the component membranes,\r\ntwo canals, which he supposes are employed to conduct the eggs of the\r\ninsect into the grooves which it has hollowed out for them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Portion of a Saw-Fly's comb-toothed rasp, and saw.]\r\n\r\nThe teeth of a carpenter's saw, it may be remarked, are simple, whereas\r\nthe teeth of the ovipositor-saw are themselves denticulated with fine\r\nteeth. The latter, also, combines at the same time the properties of a\r\nsaw and of a rasp or file. So far as we are aware, these two properties\r\nhave, never been combined in any of the tools of our carpenters. The\r\nrasping part of the ovipositor, however, is not constructed like our\r\nrasps, with short teeth thickly studded together, but has teeth almost\r\nas long as those of the saw, and placed contiguous to them, on the back\r\nof the instrument, resembling in their form and setting the teeth of a\r\ncomb, as may be seen in the figure. Of course, such observations are\r\nconducted with the aid of a microscope.\r\n\r\nWhen a female saw-fly has selected the branch of a rose-tree, or any\r\nother, in which to deposit her eggs, she may be seen bending the end\r\nof her belly inwards, in form of a crescent, and protruding her saw,\r\nat the same time, to penetrate the bark or wood. She maintains this\r\nrecurved position so long as she works in deepening the groove; but\r\nwhen she has attained the depth required, she unbends her body into a\r\nstraight line, and in this position works upon the place lengthways, by\r\napplying the saw more horizontally. When she has rendered the groove\r\nas large as she wishes, the motion of the tendons ceases, and an egg\r\nis placed in the cavity. The saw is then withdrawn into the sheath\r\nfor about two-thirds of its length, and at the same moment a sort of\r\nfrothy liquid, similar to a lather made with soap, is dropped over the\r\negg, either for the purpose of gluing it in its place or sheathing it\r\nfrom the action of the juices of the tree. She proceeds in the same\r\nmanner in sawing out a second groove, and so on in succession, till she\r\nhas deposited all her eggs, sometimes to the number of twenty-four.\r\nThe grooves are usually placed in a line, at a small distance from\r\none another, on the same branch; but sometimes the mother-fly shifts\r\nto another, or to a different part of the branch, when she is either\r\nscared or finds it unsuitable. She commonly, also, takes more than one\r\nday to the work, notwithstanding the superiority of her tools. Réaumur\r\nhas seen a saw-fly make six grooves in succession, which occupied her\r\nabout ten hours and a half.\r\n\r\nThe grooves, when finished, have externally little elevation above the\r\nlevel of the bark, appearing like the puncture of a lancet in the human\r\nskin; but in the course of a day or two the part becomes first brown\r\nand then black, while it also becomes more and more elevated. This\r\nincreased elevation is not owing to the growth of the bark, the fibres\r\nof which, indeed, have been destroyed by the ovipositor-saw, but to the\r\nactual growth of the egg; for when a new-laid egg of the saw-fly is\r\ncompared with one which has been several days enclosed in the groove,\r\nthe latter will be found to be very considerably the larger. This\r\ngrowth of the egg is contrary to the analogy observable in the eggs\r\nof birds, and even of most other insects; but it has its advantages.\r\nAs it continues to increase, it raises the bark more and more, and\r\nconsequently widens, at the same time, the slit at the entrance; so\r\nthat, when the grub is hatched, it finds a passage ready for its exit.\r\nThe mother-fly seems to be aware of this growth of her eggs, for she\r\ntakes care to deposit them at such distances as may prevent their\r\ndisturbing one another by their development.\r\n\r\nAnother species of saw-fly, with a yellow body and deep violet-coloured\r\nwings, which also selects the rose-tree, deposits her eggs in a\r\ndifferent manner. Instead of making a groove for each egg, like the\r\npreceding, she forms a large single groove, sufficient for about two\r\ndozen eggs. These eggs are all arranged in pairs, forming two straight\r\nlines parallel to the sides of the branch. The eggs, however, though\r\nthus deposited in a common groove, are carefully kept each in its\r\nplace; for a ridge of the wood is left to prevent those on the right\r\nfrom touching those on the left--and not only so, but between each egg\r\nof a row a thin partition of wood is left, forming a shallow cell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nest of eggs of Saw-fly, in rose-tree.]\r\n\r\nThe edges of this groove, it will be obvious, must be farther apart\r\nthan those which only contain a single egg, and, in fact, the whole is\r\nopen to inspection; but the eggs are kept from falling out, both by the\r\nfrothy glue before mentioned, and by the walls of the cells containing\r\nthem. They were observed also, by Vallisnieri, to increase in size like\r\nthe preceding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _a a a_, Saw-fly of the gooseberry (_Nematus Ribesii_,\r\nStephens). _b_, its eggs on the nervures of a leaf. _d d_, the\r\ncaterpillars eating. _c_, one rolled up. _f_, one extended.]\r\n\r\n[In the middle of summer, plenty of these grooves may be seen, by\r\nlooking at the under lid of leaf-stalks or delicate young twigs. Row\r\nupon row of the grooves are sometimes found, so the all-destructive\r\npower of the insects must indeed be great. The larvæ, when full fed,\r\ndispose of themselves in various ways. Those of the gooseberry-fly, for\r\nexample (_Nematus Ribesii_), after they have stripped the bush of its\r\nleaves, either seek the ground or remain on the branches, and spin a\r\nseries of cocoons, attaching them to each branch by their ends. Those,\r\ntherefore, who wish to destroy these little pests, must know both\r\nlocalities of the cocoons, or they will allow one half to escape while\r\ndestroying the other.]\r\n\r\nThis insect has a flat yellow body and four pellucid wings, the two\r\nouter ones marked with brown on the edge. In April it issues from the\r\npupa, which has lain under ground from the preceding September. The\r\nfemale of the gooseberry saw-fly does not, like some of the family,\r\ncut a groove in the branch to deposit her eggs;--\"of what use, then,\"\r\nasks Réaumur, \"is her ovipositor-saw?\" In order to satisfy himself on\r\nthis point, he introduced a pair of the flies under a bell-glass along\r\nwith a branch bent from a red-currant bush, that he might watch the\r\nprocess. The female immediately perambulated the leaves in search of\r\na place suited to her purpose, and passing under a leaf began to lay,\r\ndepositing six eggs within a quarter of an hour. Each time she placed\r\nherself as if she wished to cut into the leaf with her saw; but, upon\r\ntaking out the leaf, the eggs appeared rather projecting than lodged\r\nin its substance. The caterpillars are hatched in two or three weeks;\r\nand they feed in company till after midsummer, frequently stripping\r\nboth the leaves and fruit of an extensive plantation. The caterpillar\r\nhas six legs and sixteen pro-legs, and is of a green colour mixed with\r\nyellow, and covered with minute black dots raised like shagreen. In\r\nits last skin it loses the black dots and becomes smooth and yellowish\r\nwhite. The Caledonian Horticultural Society have published a number of\r\nplans for destroying these caterpillars.\r\n\r\n[Another remarkable mode of disposing of the pupa is shown in the\r\naccompanying illustration; it represents the nest of an exotic saw-fly,\r\nnamed _Deilocenes Ellisii_. In this instance, the numerous larvæ unite\r\nin spinning for themselves a common envelope of considerable strength;\r\nit is seen as it appears when attached to the branch of a tree. The\r\nmaterial of which it is composed is the tough silken fibre spun by\r\nthe larvæ of so many insects, which may be seen in perfection in the\r\ncocoons of the Microgaster. Two species of this curious group will be\r\ndescribed in a future page.\r\n\r\nBy the side of the branch is seen a diagram of the same nest, as it\r\nwould appear in section. The irregularly angular cells are seen in the\r\ncentre, and around them is the common envelope composed of fibres.\r\nAs may be seen from the upper figure, as soon as the insects have\r\nattained their perfect form, they gnaw their way out of the cell and\r\nthe covering also. The insect is shown as it appears when flying.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe will conclude this chapter by a few remarks upon some exotic\r\ninsects, whose nests are not only remarkable in their form, but are\r\nvaluable to the entomologist in affording grounds for the reception\r\nor rejection of certain familiar theories upon the subject of\r\nthis volume--Insect Architecture. Several of these nests are of\r\ncomparatively late discovery, and are therefore found in this work.\r\n\r\nThe curious series of cells shown in the left-hand figure is made by a\r\nhymenopterous insect belonging to the genus Icaria, and the specimens\r\nfrom which the drawing was taken may be seen in the British Museum.\r\nThey are made of a paper-like substance, much resembling in look the\r\nmaterial of which the common wasp builds its cells, but as they are\r\nexposed to the air, they are necessarily tougher and stronger than\r\nordinary wasp cells, which are shielded from the elements. The insects\r\nbelonging to this genus make nests of very diverse forms, some of which\r\nare stuck on leaves in a most curious manner, reminding the observer\r\nof the parasitic mollercoids that cover the stems and fronds of large\r\nseaweeds. Others, however, are not dependent upon leaves for their\r\nsupport, but stand out boldly from the branches to which they are\r\nfixed, supported entirely by a footstalk composed of the same material\r\nas the cells, though necessarily of a harder and more compact substance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs many of these nests have been found in India, it is easy to trace\r\nthe manner in which they were made. The mother insect began by kneading\r\nwoody fibre into a paste, and making the footstalk of the future\r\nnest. One end of this footstalk is attached very strongly to the\r\nbranch, and to the other end is fastened the first cell. As soon as the\r\nIcaria has made the first beginning of the cell, and raised--or rather\r\nlowered--the walls to a fourth or so of their complete dimensions, she\r\ninserts an egg into the yet imperfect cell, and adds to the walls while\r\nthe egg is being hatched. Her next duty is, to add a second cell, and\r\nthis is quickly followed by a third, all these cells being fastened to\r\neach other on three or four of their sides, leaving the others free and\r\nunattached. It is evident that by this mode of construction the cells\r\nnearest the branch must be the longest, because they are begun the\r\nsoonest, and this will always be found to be the case.\r\n\r\nNow, there is a point respecting which the attention of the reader must\r\nbe specially solicited. On looking at the cells, he will see that they\r\nare partly cylindrical and partly angular, and may perhaps think that\r\nthis fact goes towards proving that the hexagonal shape of bee cells is\r\nowing to mutual pressure, the outer sides of the cells being rounded,\r\nwhile the inner are angular. But, there are other cells in existence,\r\nbuilt by allied insects, and formed in an analogous manner, and which\r\nare either angular or cylindrical, exactly according to the instinctive\r\npowers of the insect which built them.\r\n\r\nOn the right hand of the Icarian nest may be seen a singular-looking\r\nstructure pendent at the end of a long footstalk. This is the nest of\r\nan insect called _Mischocyttarus labiatus_, one of the Polistidæ. In\r\nthis case, the cells are built so as to be defended from the rain by a\r\nsort of penthouse, over which all the rain-drops would run, and so fall\r\nharmless to the ground. The cells of this insect are soft in texture,\r\nand are more cylindrical than angular, the angles being but very\r\nslightly marked.\r\n\r\nHere, however, is the nest of an insect called _Raphigaster\r\nGuiniensis_, which is built in a manner similar to that of the Icaria,\r\nthe cells being closely in contact with each other. The material of\r\nwhich they are made is peculiarly soft. something like very thin and\r\nflimsy grey paper. Consequently, they must press strongly upon each\r\nother, and we might reasonably expect to find that their angles are\r\nwell and boldly developed. But, instead of that, we find that they have\r\nno angles at all, but remain smooth and rounded throughout their length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most powerful argument against the equal pressure theory is\r\nto be found in the nest of a species of Icaria, which is shown in the\r\naccompanying illustration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs may be seen by reference to the illustration, the material of which\r\nthey are made is so soft, that they bend over by their own weight, and\r\ntherefore we might expect to find that they would follow the shape of\r\nthe Raphigaster and the Mischocyttarus. But, we find that all the\r\ncells are boldly angular, and that the angles are just as sharp on the\r\nexterior of each cell as on the sides which cement the cells together.\r\nIt is clear that the bold lines and decided angles of these cells\r\ncannot have been produced mechanically, and that they must have been\r\nintentionally formed by the insect architect.\r\n\r\nOne single cell, such as is here shown, is sufficient to overthrow\r\nthe theory of \"equal pressure,\" by which insects were deprived of\r\nall mechanical skill, and supposed to labour like so many animated\r\nmachines, without caring or knowing anything about the work on which\r\nthey were engaged. According to the equal pressure theory, each of\r\nthese cells would have required six similar cells around it before it\r\ncould have assumed the hexagonal form, and yet we find that a cell\r\nwhich is only connected with its neighbour by one side, has its other\r\nfive sides angular, and with the angles boldly defined.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER VIII._\r\n\r\nLEAF-ROLLING CATERPILLARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe labours of those insect-architects, which we have endeavoured to\r\ndescribe in the preceding pages, have been chiefly those of mothers to\r\nform a secure nest for their eggs, and the young hatched from them,\r\nduring the first stage of their existence. But a much more numerous\r\nand not less ingenious class of architects may be found among the\r\nnewly-hatched insects themselves, who, untaught by experience, and\r\naltogether unassisted by previous example, manifest the most marvellous\r\nskill in the construction of tents, houses, galleries, covert-ways,\r\nfortifications, and even cities, not to speak of subterranean caverns\r\nand subaqueous apartments, which no human art could rival.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars, which are familiarly termed leaf-rollers, are perfect\r\nhermits. Each lives in a cell, which it begins to construct almost\r\nimmediately after it is hatched; and the little structure is at once\r\na house which protects the caterpillar from its enemies, and a store\r\nof food for its subsistence, while it remains shut up in its prison.\r\nBut the insect only devours the inner folds. The art which these\r\ncaterpillars exercise, although called into action but once, perhaps,\r\nin their lives, is perfect. They accomplish their purpose with a\r\nmechanical skill, which is remarkable for its simplicity and unerring\r\nsuccess. The art of rolling leaves into a secure and immovable cell\r\nmay not appear very difficult: nor would it be so if the caterpillars\r\nhad fingers, or any parts which were equivalent to those delicate and\r\nadmirable natural instruments with which man accomplishes his most\r\nelaborate works. And yet the human fingers could not roll a rocket-case\r\nof paper more regularly than the caterpillar rolls his house of leaves.\r\nA leaf is not a very easy substance to roll. In some trees it is very\r\nbrittle. It has also a natural elasticity,--a disposition to spring\r\nback if it be bent,--which is caused by the continuity of its threads,\r\nor nervures. This elasticity is speedily overcome by the ingenuity\r\nwith which the caterpillar works; and the leaf is thus retained in its\r\nartificial position for many weeks, under every variety of temperature.\r\nWe will examine, in detail, how these little leaf-rollers accomplish\r\ntheir task.\r\n\r\nOne of the most common as well as the most simple fabrics constructed\r\nby caterpillars, may be discovered during summer on almost every kind\r\nof bush and tree. We shall take as examples those which are found on\r\nthe lilac and on the oak.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lilac-tree Moth. (_Lozotænia riteana_, Stephens?)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nest of a Lilac-leaf Roller.]\r\n\r\nA small but very pretty chocolate-coloured moth, abundant in every\r\ngarden, but not readily seen, from its frequently alighting on the\r\nground, which is so nearly of its own colour, deposits its eggs\r\non the leaves of the currant, the lilac, and of some other trees,\r\nappropriating a leaf to each egg. As soon as the caterpillar is\r\nhatched, it begins to secure itself from birds and predatory insects\r\nby rolling up the lilac leaf into the form of a gallery, where it may\r\nfeed in safety. We have repeatedly seen one of them when just escaped\r\nfrom the egg, and only a few lines long, fix several silk threads from\r\none edge of a leaf to the other, or from the edge to the mid-rib; then\r\ngoing to the middle of the space, he shortened the threads by bending\r\nthem with his feet, and consequently pulled the edges of the leaves\r\ninto a circular form; and he retained them in that position by gluing\r\ndown each thread as he shortened it. In their younger state, those\r\ncaterpillars seldom roll more than a small portion of the leaf; but,\r\nwhen farther advanced, they unite the two edges together in their whole\r\nextent, with the exception of a small opening at one end, by which an\r\nexit may be made in case of need.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Another nest of Lilac-leaf Roller.]\r\n\r\nAnother species of caterpillar, closely allied to this, rolls up the\r\nlilac leaves in a different form, beginning at the end of a leaf, and\r\nfixing and pulling its threads till it gets it nearly into the shape of\r\na scroll of parchment. To retain this form more securely, it is not\r\ncontented, like the former insect, with threads fixed on the inside of\r\nthe leaf; but has also recourse to a few cables which it weaves on the\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Small green Oak-moth. (_Tortrix viridana._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nests of Oak-leaf-rolling Caterpillars.]\r\n\r\nAnother species of moth, allied to the two preceding, is of a\r\npretty green colour, and lays its eggs upon the leaves of the oak.\r\nThis caterpillar folds them up in a similar manner, but with this\r\ndifference, that it works on the under surface of the leaf, pulling\r\nthe edge downwards and backwards, instead of forwards and upwards.\r\nThis species is very abundant, and may readily be found as soon as\r\nthe leaves expand. In June, when the perfect insect has appeared, by\r\nbeating a branch of an oak, a whole shower of these pretty green moths\r\nmay be shook into the air.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the leaf-rolling caterpillars, there is a small dark-brown\r\none, with a black head and six feet, very common in gardens, on the\r\ncurrant-bush, or the leaves of the rose-tree (_Lozotænia rosana_,\r\nStephens). It is exceedingly destructive to the flower-buds. The eggs\r\nare deposited in the summer, and probably also in the autumn or in\r\nspring, in little oval or circular patches of a green colour. The grub\r\nmakes its appearance with the first opening of the leaves, of whose\r\nstructure in the half-expanded state it takes advantage to construct\r\nits summer tent. It is not, like some of the other leaf-rollers,\r\ncontented with a single leaf, but weaves together as many as there\r\nare in the bud where it may chance to have been hatched, binding\r\ntheir discs so firmly with silk, that all the force of the ascending\r\nsap, and the increasing growth of the leaves, cannot break through;\r\na farther expansion is of course prevented. The little inhabitant in\r\nthe meanwhile banquets securely on the partitions of its tent, eating\r\ndoor-ways from one apartment into another, through which it can escape\r\nin case of danger or disturbance.\r\n\r\nThe leaflets of the rose, it may be remarked, expand in nearly the same\r\nmanner as a fan, and the operations of this ingenious little insect\r\nretain them in the form of a fan nearly shut. Sometimes, however, it is\r\nnot contented with one bundle of leaflets, but by means of its silken\r\ncords unites all which spring from the same bud into a rain-proof\r\ncanopy, under the protection of which it can feast on the flower-bud,\r\nand prevent it from ever blowing.\r\n\r\nIn the instance of the currant-leaves, the proceedings of the grub\r\nare the same; but it cannot unite the plaits so smoothly as in the\r\ncase of the rose leaflets, and it requires more labour, also, as the\r\nnervures, being stiff, demand a greater effort to bend them. When all\r\nthe exertions of the insect prove unavailing in its endeavours to\r\ndraw the edges of a leaf together, it bends them inwards as far as\r\nit can, and weaves a close web of silk over the open space between.\r\nThis is well exemplified in one of the commonest of our leaf-rolling\r\ncaterpillars, which may be found as early as February on the leaves of\r\nthe nettle and the white archangel (_Lamium album_). It is of a light\r\ndirty-green colour, spotted with black, and covered with a few hairs.\r\nIn its young state it confines itself to the bosom of a small leaf,\r\nnear the insertion of the leaf-stalk, partly bending the edges inwards,\r\nand covering in the interval with a silken curtain. As this sort of\r\ncovering is not sufficient for concealment when the animal advances\r\nin growth, it abandons the base of the leaf for the middle, where it\r\ndoubles up one side in a very secure and ingenious manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nest of the Nettle-leaf-rolling Caterpillar.]\r\n\r\nWe have watched this little architect begin and finish his tent upon\r\na nettle in our study, the whole operation taking more than half an\r\nhour. (J. R.) He began by walking over the plant in all directions,\r\nexamining the leaves severally, as if to ascertain which was best\r\nfitted for his purpose by being pliable, and bending with the weight\r\nof his body. Having found one to his mind, he placed himself along\r\nthe mid-rib, to the edge of which he secured himself firmly with the\r\npro-legs of his tail; then stretching his head to the edge of the\r\nleaf, he fixed a series of parallel cables between it and the mid-rib,\r\nwith another series crossing these at an acute angle. The position in\r\nwhich he worked was most remarkable, for he did not, as might have\r\nbeen supposed, spin his cables with his face to the leaf, but throwing\r\nhimself on his back, which was turned towards the leaf, he hung with\r\nhis whole weight by his first-made cables. This, by drawing them into\r\nthe form of a curve, shortened them, and consequently pulled the edge\r\nof the leaf down towards the mid-rib. The weight of his body was not,\r\nhowever, the only power which he employed; for, using the terminal\r\npro-legs as a point of support, he exerted the whole muscles of his\r\nbody to shorten his threads, and pull down the edge of the leaf. When\r\nhe had drawn the threads as tight as he could, he held them till he\r\nspun fresh ones of sufficient strength to retain the leaf in the bent\r\nposition into which he had pulled it. He then left the first series\r\nto hang loose while he shortened the fresh-spun ones as before. This\r\nprocess was continued till he had worked down about an inch and a half\r\nof the leaf, as much as he deemed sufficient for his habitation. This\r\nwas the first part of the architecture.\r\n\r\nBy the time he had worked to the end of the fold, he had brought the\r\nedge of the leaf to touch the mid-rib; but it was only held in this\r\nposition by a few of the last-spun threads, for all the first-spun\r\nones hung loose within. Apparently aware of this, the insect protruded\r\nmore than half of its body through the small aperture left at the end,\r\nand spun several bundles of threads on the outside precisely similar\r\nto those ropes of a tent which extend beyond the canvas, and are\r\npegged into the ground. Unwilling to trust the exposure of his whole\r\nbody on the outside, lest he should be seized by the first sand-wasp\r\n(_odynerus_) or sparrow which might descry him, he now withdrew to\r\ncomplete the internal portion of his dwelling, where the threads were\r\nhanging loose and disorderly. For this purpose he turned his head\r\nabout, and proceeded precisely as he had done at the beginning of his\r\ntask, but taking care to spin his new threads so as to leave the loose\r\nones on the outside, and make his apartment smooth and neat. When he\r\nagain reached the opposite end, he constructed there also a similar\r\nseries of cables on the outside, and then withdrew to give some final\r\ntouches to the interior.\r\n\r\nIt is said by Kirby and Spence,[BJ] that when these leaf-rolling insects\r\nfind that the larger nervures of the leaves are so strong as to prevent\r\nthem from bending, they \"weaken it by gnawing it here and there half\r\nthrough.\" We have never observed the circumstance, though we have\r\nwitnessed the process in some hundreds of instances; and we doubt\r\nthe statement, from the careful survey which the insect makes of the\r\ncapabilities of the leaf before the operation is begun. If she found\r\nupon examination that a leaf would not bend, she would reject it, as we\r\nhave often seen happen, and pass to another. (J. R.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA species of leaf-roller, of the most diminutive size, merits\r\nparticular mention, although it is not remarkable in colour or figure.\r\nIt is without hair, of a greenish-white, and has all the vivacity of\r\nthe other leaf-rollers. Sorrel is the plant on which it feeds; and the\r\nmanner in which it rolls a portion of the leaf is very ingenious.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Leaf-rolling Caterpillars of the Sorrel.]\r\n\r\nThe structure which it contrives is a sort of conical pyramid, composed\r\nof five or six folds lapped round each other. From the position of this\r\nlittle cone the caterpillar has other labours to perform, beside that\r\nof rolling the leaf. It first cuts across the leaf, its teeth acting\r\nas a pair of scissors; but it does not entirely detach this segment.\r\nIt rolls it up very gradually, by attaching threads of silk to the\r\nplane surface of the leaf, as we have before seen; and then, having\r\ncut in a different direction, sets the cone upright, by weaving other\r\nthreads, attached to the centre of the roll and the plane of the leaf,\r\nupon which it throws the weight of its body. This, it will be readily\r\nseen, is a somewhat complicated effort of mechanical skill. It has been\r\nminutely described by M. Réaumur; but the preceding representation will\r\nperhaps make the process clearer than a more detailed account.\r\n\r\nThis caterpillar, like those of which we have already spoken, devours\r\nall the interior of the roll. It weaves, also, in the interior, a small\r\nand thin cocoon of white silk, the tissue of which is made compact and\r\nclose. It is then transformed into a chrysalis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nests of the Hesperia malvæ, with Caterpillar,\r\nChrysalis, and Butterflies.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars of two of our largest and handsomest butterflies,\r\nthe painted lady (_Cynthia cardui_, Stephens), and the admiral, or\r\n_Alderman_ of the London fly-fanciers (_Vanessa atalanta_), are also\r\nleaf-rollers. The first selects the leaves of the great spear-thistle,\r\nand sometimes those of the stemless or star-thistle, which might be\r\nsupposed rather difficult to bend; but the caterpillar is four times\r\nas large and strong as those which we have been hitherto describing. In\r\nsome seasons it is plentiful; in others it is rarely to be met with:\r\nbut the admiral is seldom scarce in any part of the country; and by\r\nexamining the leaves of nettles which appear folded edge to edge, in\r\nJuly and August, the caterpillar may be readily found.\r\n\r\nAnother butterfly (_Hesperia malvæ_) is met with on dry banks where\r\nmallows grow, in May, or even earlier, and also in August, but is not\r\nindigenous. The caterpillar, which is grey, with a black head, and\r\nfour sulphur-coloured spots on the neck, folds around it the leaves of\r\nthe mallow, upon which it feeds. There is nothing, however, peculiarly\r\ndifferent in its proceedings from those above described; but the care\r\nwith which it selects and rolls up one of the smaller leaves, when it\r\nis about to be transformed into a chrysalis, is worthy of remark; it\r\njoins it, indeed, so completely round and round, that it has somewhat\r\nthe resemblance of an egg. Within this green cell it lies secure, till\r\nthe time arrives when it is ready to burst its cerements, and trust to\r\nthe quickness of its wings for protection against its enemies.\r\n\r\nAmong the nests of caterpillars which roll up parcels of leaves, we\r\nknow none so well contrived as those which are found upon willows and\r\na species of osier. The long and narrow leaves of these plants are\r\nnaturally adapted to be adjusted parallel to each other; for this is\r\nthe direction which they have at the end of each stalk, when they are\r\nnot entirely developed. One kind of small smooth caterpillar (_Tortrix\r\nchlorana_), with sixteen feet, the under part of which is brown, and\r\nstreaked with white, fastens these leaves together, and makes them up\r\ninto parcels. There is nothing particularly striking in the mechanical\r\nmanner in which it constructs them. It does precisely what we should do\r\nin a similar case: it winds a thread round those leaves which must be\r\nkept together, from a little above their termination to a very short\r\ndistance from their extreme point; and as it finds the leaves almost\r\nconstantly lying near each other, it has little difficulty in bringing\r\nthem together, as is shown in the following cut, _a_.\r\n\r\nThe prettiest of these parcels are those which are made upon a kind\r\nof osier, the borders of whose leaves sometimes form columnar bundles\r\nbefore they become developed. A section of these leaves has the\r\nappearance of filigree-work (see _b_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nest of Willow-leaf Roller.]\r\n\r\nA caterpillar which feeds upon the willow, and whose singular attitudes\r\nhave obtained for it the trivial name of _Ziczac_, also constructs\r\nfor itself an arbour of the leaves, by drawing them together in an\r\ningenious manner. M. Roesel[BK] has given a tolerable representation of\r\nthis nest, and of the caterpillar. The caterpillar is found in June;\r\nand the moth (_Notodonta ziczac_) from May to July in the following\r\nyear (see cut, p. 151).\r\n\r\nBeside those caterpillars which live solitary in the folds of a leaf,\r\nthere are others which associate, employing their united powers to\r\ndraw the leaves of the plants they feed upon into a covering for\r\ntheir common protection. Among these we may mention the caterpillar\r\nof a small butterfly, the plantain or Glanville fritillary (_Melitea\r\ncinxia_), which is very scarce in this country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ziczac Caterpillar and Nest.]\r\n\r\nAlthough a colony of these caterpillars is not numerous, seldom\r\namounting to a hundred individuals, the place which they have selected\r\nis not hard to discover. Their abode may be seen in the meadow\r\nin form of a tuft of herbage covered with a white web, which may\r\nreadily be mistaken, at first view, for that of a spider, but closer\r\ninspection soon corrects this notion. It is, in fact, a sort of common\r\ntent, in which the whole brood lives, eats, and undergoes the usual\r\ntransformations. The shape of this tent, for the most part, approaches\r\nthe pyramidal, though that depends much upon the natural growth of the\r\nherbage which composes it. The interior is divided into compartments\r\nformed by the union of several small tents, as it were, to which others\r\nhave been from time to time added according to the necessities of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nWhen they have devoured all the leaves, or at least those which are\r\nmost tender and succulent, they abandon their first camp, and construct\r\nanother contiguous to it under a tuft of fresh leaves. Several of these\r\nencampments may sometimes be seen within the distance of a foot or\r\ntwo, when they can find plantain (_Plantago lanceolata_) fit for their\r\npurpose; but though they prefer this plant, they content themselves\r\nwith grass if it is not to be procured.\r\n\r\nWhen they are about to cast their skins, but particularly when they\r\nperceive the approach of winter, they construct a more durable\r\napartment in the interior of their principal tent. The ordinary web is\r\nthin and semi-transparent, permitting the leaves to be seen through it;\r\nbut their winter canvas, if we may call it so, is thick, strong, and\r\nquite opaque, forming a sort of circular hall without any partition,\r\nwhere the whole community lie coiled up and huddled together.\r\n\r\nEarly in spring they issue forth in search of fresh food, and again\r\nconstruct tents to protect them from cold and rain, and from the\r\nmid-day sun.\r\n\r\nM. Réaumur found upon trial, that it was not only the caterpillars\r\nhatched from the eggs of the same mother which would unite in\r\nconstructing the common tent; for different broods, when put together,\r\nworked in the same social and harmonious manner. We ourselves\r\nascertained, during the present summer (1829), that this principle\r\nof sociality is not confined to the same species, nor even to the\r\nsame genus. The experiment which we tried was to confine two broods\r\nof different species to the same branch, by placing it in a glass of\r\nwater to prevent their escape. The caterpillars which we experimented\r\non were several broods of the brown-tail moth (_Porthesia auriflua_)\r\nand the lackey (_Clisiocampa neustria_). These we found to work with\r\nas much industry and harmony in constructing the common tent as if\r\nthey had been at liberty on their native trees; and when the lackeys\r\nencountered the brown-tails they manifested no alarm nor uneasiness,\r\nbut passed over the backs of one another, as if they had made only a\r\nportion of the branch. In none of their operations did they seem to\r\nbe subject to any discipline, each individual appearing to work, in\r\nperfecting the structure, from individual instinct, in the same manner\r\nas was remarked by M. Huber in the case of the hive-bees. In making\r\nsuch experiments, it is obvious that the species of caterpillars\r\nexperimented with must feed upon the same sort of plant.[BL] (J. R.)\r\n\r\nThe design of the caterpillars in rolling up the leaves is not only\r\nto conceal themselves from birds and predatory insects, but also to\r\nprotect themselves from the cuckoo-flies, which lie in wait in every\r\nquarter to deposit their eggs in their bodies, that their progeny may\r\ndevour them. Their mode of concealment, however, though it appear to be\r\ncunningly contrived and skilfully executed, is not always successful,\r\ntheir enemies often discovering their hiding-place. We happened to see\r\na remarkable instance of this last summer (1828), in the case of one of\r\nthe lilac caterpillars which had changed into a chrysalis within the\r\nclosely-folded leaf. A small ichneumon, aware it should seem of the\r\nvery spot where the chrysalis lay within this leaf, was seen boring\r\nthrough it with her ovipositor, and introducing her eggs through the\r\npunctures thus made into the body of the dormant insect. We allowed\r\nher to lay all her eggs, about six in number, and then put the leaf\r\nunder an inverted glass. In a few days the eggs of the cuckoo-fly were\r\nhatched, the grubs devoured the lilac chrysalis, and finally changed\r\ninto pupæ in a case of yellow silk, and into perfect insects like their\r\nparents. (J. R.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER IX._\r\n\r\nINSECTS FORMING HABITATIONS OF DETACHED LEAVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe habitations of the insects which we have just described consist\r\nof growing leaves, bent, rolled, or pressed together, and fixed in\r\ntheir positions by silken threads. But there are other habitations of\r\na similar kind, which are constructed by cutting out and detaching\r\na whole leaf, or a portion of a leaf. We have already seen how\r\ndexterously the upholsterer-bees cut out small parts of leaves and\r\npetals with their mandibles, and fit them into their cells. Some of\r\nthe caterpillars do not exhibit quite so much neatness and elegance as\r\nthe leaf-cutting bees, though their structures answer all the purposes\r\nintended; but there are others, as we shall presently see, that far\r\nexcel the bees, at least in the delicate minutiæ of their workmanship.\r\nWe shall first advert to those structures which are the most simple.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNot far from Longchamps, in a road through the Bois de Boulogne,\r\nis a large marsh, which M. Réaumur never observed to be in a dry\r\nstate even during summer. This marsh is surrounded with very lofty\r\noaks, and abounds with pondweed, the water-plant named by botanists\r\n_potamogeton_. The shining leaves of this plant, which are as large as\r\nthose of the laurel or orange-tree, but thicker and more fleshy, are\r\nspread upon the surface of the water. Having pulled up several of these\r\nabout the middle of June, M. Réaumur observed, beneath one of the first\r\nwhich he examined, an elevation of an oval shape, which was formed out\r\nof a leaf of the same plant. He carefully examined it, and discovered\r\nthat threads of silk were attached to this elevation. Breaking the\r\nthreads, he raised up one of the ends, and saw a cavity, in which a\r\ncaterpillar (_Hydrocampa potamogeta_) was lodged. An indefatigable\r\nobserver, such as M. Réaumur, would naturally follow up this discovery;\r\nand he has accordingly given us a memoir of the pondweed tent-maker,\r\ndistinguished by his usual minute accuracy.\r\n\r\nIn order to make a new habitation, the caterpillar fastens itself on\r\nthe under side of a leaf of the _Potamogeton_. With its mandibles it\r\npierces some part of this leaf, and afterwards gradually gnaws a curved\r\nline, marking the form of the piece which it wishes to detach. When the\r\ncaterpillar has cut off, as from a piece of cloth, a patch of leaf of\r\nthe size and shape suited to its purpose, it is provided with half of\r\nthe materials requisite for making a tent. It takes hold of this piece\r\nby its mandibles, and conveys it to the situation on the under side of\r\nits own or another leaf, whichever is found most appropriate. It is\r\nthere disposed in such a manner that the under part of the patch--the\r\nside which was the under part of the entire leaf--is turned towards the\r\nunder part of the new leaf, so that the inner walls of the cell or tent\r\nare always made by the under part of two portions of leaf. The leaves\r\nof the potamogeton are a little concave on the under side; and thus the\r\ncaterpillar produces a hollow cell, though the rims are united.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar secures the leaf in its position by threads of white\r\nsilk. It then weaves in the cavity a cocoon, which is somewhat thin,\r\nbut of very close tissue. There it shuts itself up, to appear again\r\nonly in the form of the perfect insect, and is soon transformed into a\r\nchrysalis. In this cocoon of silk no point touches the water; whilst\r\nthe tent of leaves, lined with silk, has been constructed underneath\r\nthe water. This fact proves that the caterpillar has a particular art\r\nby which it repels the water from between the leaves.\r\n\r\nWhen the caterpillar, which has thus conveyed and disposed a patch\r\nof leaf against another leaf, is not ready to be transformed into a\r\nchrysalis, it applies itself to make a tent or habitation which it\r\nmay carry everywhere about with it. It begins by slightly fixing the\r\npiece against the perfect leaf, leaving intervals all round, between\r\nthe piece and leaf, at which it may project its head. The piece which\r\nit has fixed serves as a model for cutting out a similar piece in the\r\nother leaf. The caterpillar puts them accurately together, except at\r\none end of the oval, where an opening is left for the insect to project\r\nits head through. When the caterpillar is inclined to change its\r\nsituation, it draws itself forward by means of its scaly limbs, riveted\r\nupon the leaf. The membraneous limbs, which are riveted against the\r\ninner sides of the tents, oblige it to follow the anterior part of the\r\nbody, as it advances. The caterpillar, also, puts its head out of the\r\ntent every time it desires to eat.\r\n\r\nThere is found on the common chickweed (_Stellaria media_), towards\r\nthe end of July, a middle-sized smooth green caterpillar, having three\r\nbrown spots bordered with white on the back, and six legs and ten\r\npro-legs, whose architecture is worthy of observation. When it is about\r\nto go into chrysalis, towards the beginning of August, it gnaws off,\r\none by one, a number of the leaves and smaller twigs of the chickweed,\r\nand adjusts them into an oval cocoon, somewhat rough and unfinished\r\nexternally, but smooth, uniform, and finely tapestried with white silk\r\nwithin. Here it undergoes its transformation securely, and, when the\r\nperiod of its pupa trance has expired in the following July, it makes\r\nits exit in the form of a yellowish moth, with several brown spots\r\nabove, and a brown band on each of its four wings below. It is also\r\nfurnished with a sort of tail.\r\n\r\nOn the cypress-spurge (_Euphorbia cyparissias_), a native woodland\r\nplant, but not of very common occurrence, may be found, towards the\r\nend of October, a caterpillar of a middle size, sparely tufted with\r\nhair, and striped with black, white, red, and brown. The leaves of the\r\nplant, which are in the form of short narrow blades of grass, are made\r\nchoice of by the caterpillar to construct its cocoon, which it does\r\nwith great neatness and regularity, the end of each leaf, after it has\r\nbeen detached from the plant, being fixed to the stem, and the other\r\nleaves placed parallel, as they are successively added. The other ends\r\nof all these are bent inwards, so as to form a uniformly rounded oblong\r\nfigure, somewhat larger at one end than at the other.\r\n\r\nA caterpillar which builds a very similar cocoon to the last-mentioned\r\nmay be found upon a more common plant--the yellow snap-dragon or\r\ntoad-flax (_Antirrhinum linaria_)--which is to be seen in almost every\r\nhedge. It is somewhat shaped like a leech, is of a middle size, and the\r\nprevailing colour pearl-grey, but striped with yellow and black. It\r\nspins up about the beginning of September, forming the outer coating of\r\npieces of detached leaves of the plant, and sometimes of whole leaves\r\nplaced longitudinally, the whole disposed with great symmetry and\r\nneatness. The moth appears in the following June.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cypress-Spurge Caterpillar--(_Acronycta\r\nEuphrasiæ_)--with a Cocoon, on a branch.]\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, as one of the most striking instances of\r\ninstinctive foresight, that the caterpillars which build structures of\r\nthis substantial description are destined to lie much longer in their\r\nchrysalis trance than those which spin merely a flimsy web of silk. For\r\nthe most part, indeed, the latter undergo their final transformation\r\nin a few weeks; while the former continue entranced the larger portion\r\nof a year, appearing in the perfect state the summer after their\r\narchitectural labours have been completed. (J. R.) This is a remarkable\r\nexample of the instinct which leads these little creatures to act as\r\nif under the dictates of prudence, and with a perfect knowledge of the\r\ntime, be it long or short, which will elapse before the last change of\r\nthe pupa takes place. That the caterpillar, while weaving its cocoon\r\nand preparing to assume the pupa state, exercises any reflective\r\nfaculties, or is aware of what is about to occur relative to its own\r\nself, we cannot admit. It enters upon a work of which it has had no\r\nprevious experience, and which is performed, as far as contingencies\r\nallow, in the same manner by every caterpillar of the same species.\r\nIts labours, its mode of carrying them on, and the very time in which\r\nthey are to be commenced, are all pre-appointed; and an instinctive\r\nimpulse urges and guides; and with this instinct its organic endowments\r\nare in precise harmony; nor does instinct ever impel to labours for\r\nwhich an animal is not provided. \"The same wisdom,\" says Bonnet, \"which\r\nhas constructed and arranged with so much art the various organs of\r\nanimals, and has made them concur towards one determined end, has also\r\nprovided that the different operations which are the natural results\r\nof the economy of the animal should concur towards the same end. The\r\ncreature is directed towards his object by an invisible hand; he\r\nexecutes with precision, and by one effort, those works which we so\r\nmuch admire; he appears to act as if he reasoned, to return to his\r\nlabour at the proper time, to change his scheme in case of need. But in\r\nall this he only obeys the secret influence which drives him on. He is\r\nbut an instrument which cannot judge of each action, but is wound up\r\nby that adorable Intelligence, which has traced out for every insect\r\nits proper labours, as he has traced the orbit of each planet. When,\r\ntherefore, I see an insect working at the construction of a nest, or a\r\ncocoon, I am impressed with respect, because it seems to me that I am\r\nat a spectacle where the Supreme Artist is hid behind the curtain.\"[BM]\r\n\r\nThere is a small sort of caterpillar which may be found on old walls,\r\nfeeding upon minute mosses and lichens, the proceedings of which are\r\nwell worthy of attention. They are similar, in appearance and size, to\r\nthe caterpillar of the small cabbage-butterfly (_Pontia rapæ_), and\r\nare smooth and bluish. The material which they use in building their\r\ncocoons is composed of the leaves and branchlets of green moss, which\r\nthey cut into suitable pieces, detaching at the same time along with\r\nthem a portion of the earth in which they grow. They arrange these upon\r\nthe walls of their building, with the moss on the outside, and the\r\nearth on the inside, making a sort of vault of the tiny bits of green\r\nmoss turf, dug from the surface of the wall. So neatly, also, are the\r\nseveral pieces joined, that the whole might well be supposed to be a\r\npatch of moss which had grown in form of an oval tuft, a little more\r\nelevated than the rest growing on the wall. When these caterpillars are\r\nshut up in a box with some moss, without earth, they construct with it\r\ncells in form of a hollow ball, very prettily plaited and interwoven.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Moss-Cell of small Caterpillar (_Bryophila perla?_)]\r\n\r\nIn May last (1829), we found on the walls of Greenwich Park a great\r\nnumber of caterpillars, whose manners bore some resemblance to those\r\nof the grub described by M. Réaumur. (J. R.) They were of middle size,\r\nwith a dull-orange stripe along the back; the head and sides of the\r\nbody black, and the belly greenish. Their abodes were constructed with\r\ningenuity and care. A caterpillar of this sort appears to choose either\r\na part where the mortar contains a cavity, or it digs one suited to\r\nits design. Over the opening of the hollow in the mortar it builds\r\nan arched wall, so as to form a chamber considerably larger than is\r\nusual with other architect caterpillars. It selects grains of mortar,\r\nbrick, or lichen, fixing them, by means of silk, firmly into the\r\nstructure. As some of these vaulted walls were from an inch to an inch\r\nand a half long, and about a third of an inch wide and deep, it may\r\nbe well imagined that it would require no little industry and labour\r\nto complete the work; yet it does not demand more than a few hours\r\nfor the insect to raise it from the foundation. Like all other insect\r\narchitects, this caterpillar uses its own body for a measuring-rule,\r\nand partly for a mould, or rather a block or centre to shape the walls\r\nby, curving itself round and round concentrically with the arch which\r\nit is building.\r\n\r\nWe afterwards found one of these caterpillars, which had dug a cell in\r\none of the softest of the bricks, covering itself on the outside with\r\nan arched wall of brick-dust, cemented with silk. As this brick was of\r\na bright-red colour, we were thereby able to ascertain that there was\r\nnot a particle of lichen employed in the structure.\r\n\r\nThe neatness mentioned by Réaumur, as remarkable in his moss-building\r\ncaterpillars, is equally observable in that which we have just\r\ndescribed; for, on looking at the surface of the wall, it would be\r\nimpossible for a person unacquainted with those structures to detect\r\nwhere they were placed, as they are usually, on the outside, level with\r\nthe adjoining brick-work; and it is only when they are opened by the\r\nentomologist, that the little architect is perceived lying snug in his\r\nchamber. If a portion of the wall be thus broken down, the caterpillar\r\nimmediately commences repairing the breach, by piecing in bits of\r\nmortar and fragments of lichen, till we can scarcely distinguish the\r\nnew portion from the old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER X._\r\n\r\nCADDIS-WORMS AND CARPENTER-CATERPILLARS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Leaf Nest of Caddis-Worm.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Reed Nest of Caddis-Worm.]\r\n\r\nThere is a very interesting class of grubs which live under water,\r\nwhere they construct for themselves moveable tents of various materials\r\nas their habits direct them, or as the substances they require can\r\nbe conveniently procured. Among the materials used by these singular\r\ngrubs, well-known to fishermen by the name of _caddis-worms_, and\r\nto naturalists as the _larvæ_ of the four-winged flies in the order\r\n_Trichoptera_ of Kirby and Spence, we may mention sand, stones,\r\nshells, wood, and leaves, which are skilfully joined and strongly\r\ncemented. One of these grubs forms a pretty case of leaves glued\r\ntogether longitudinally, but leaving an aperture sufficiently large\r\nfor the inhabitant to put out its head and shoulders when it wishes\r\nto look about for food. Another employs pieces of reed cut into\r\nconvenient lengths, or of grass, straw, wood, &c., carefully joining\r\nand cementing each piece to its fellow as the work proceeds; and he\r\nfrequently finishes the whole by adding a broad piece longer than the\r\nrest to shade his door-way overhead, so that he may not be seen from\r\nabove. A more laborious structure is reared by the grub of a beautiful\r\ncaddis-fly (_Phryganea_), which weaves together a group of the leaves\r\nof aquatic plants into a roundish ball, and in the interior of this\r\nforms a cell for its abode. The fallowing figure from Roesel will give\r\na more precise notion of this structure than a lengthened description.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAnother of these aquatic architects makes choice of the tiny shells of\r\nyoung fresh-water mussels and snails (_Planorbis_), to form a moveable\r\ngrotto; and as these little shells are for the most part inhabited, he\r\nkeeps the poor animals close prisoners, and drags them without mercy\r\nalong with him. These grotto-building grubs are by no means uncommon in\r\nponds; and in chalk districts, such as the country about Woolwich and\r\nGravesend, they are very abundant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shell Nests of Caddis-Worms.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most surprising instances of their skill occurs in the\r\nstructures of which small stones are the principal material. The\r\nproblem is to make a tube about the width of the hollow of a\r\nwheat-straw or a crow-quill, and equally smooth and uniform. Now the\r\nmaterials being small stones full of angles and irregularities, the\r\ndifficulty of performing this problem will appear to be considerable,\r\nif not insurmountable: yet the little architects, by patiently\r\nexamining their stones and turning them round on every side, never fail\r\nto accomplish their plans. This, however, is only part of the problem,\r\nwhich is complicated with another condition, and which we have not\r\nfound recorded by former observers, namely, that the under-surface\r\nshall be flat and smooth, without any projecting angles which might\r\nimpede its progress when dragged along the bottom of the rivulet where\r\nit resides. The selection of the stones, indeed, may be accounted for,\r\nfrom this species living in streams where, but for the weight of its\r\nhouse, it would to a certainty be swept away. For this purpose, it is\r\nprobable that the grub makes choice of larger stones than it might\r\notherwise want; and therefore also it is that we frequently find a case\r\ncomposed of very small stones and sand, to which, when nearly finished,\r\na large stone is added by way of ballast. In other instances, when the\r\nmaterials are found to possess too great specific gravity, a bit of\r\nlight wood, or a hollow straw, is added to buoy up the case.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stone Nest of Caddis-Worm.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sand Nest balanced with a Stone.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nest of Caddis-Worm balanced with Straws.]\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, that the cement, used in all these cases,\r\nis superior to pozzolana[BN] in standing water, in which it is\r\nindissoluble. The grubs themselves are also admirably adapted for their\r\nmode of life, the portion of their bodies which is always enclosed in\r\nthe case being soft like a meal-worm, or garden-caterpillar, while\r\nthe head and shoulders, which are for the most part projected beyond\r\nthe door-way in search of food, are firm, hard, and consequently less\r\nliable to injury than the protected portion, should it chance to be\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\nWe have repeatedly tried experiments with the inhabitants of those\r\naquatic tents, to ascertain their mode of building. We have deprived\r\nthem of their little houses, and furnished them with materials for\r\nconstructing new ones, watching their proceedings from their laying the\r\nfirst stone or shell of the structure. They work at the commencement\r\nin a very clumsy manner, attaching a great number of chips to whatever\r\nmaterials may be within their reach with loose threads of silk, and\r\nmany of these they never use at all in their perfect building. They\r\nact, indeed, much like an unskilful workman trying his hand before\r\ncommitting himself upon an intended work of difficult execution. Their\r\nmain intention is, however, to have abundance of materials within\r\nreach: for after their dwelling is fairly begun, they shut themselves\r\nup in it, and do not again protrude more than half of their body to\r\nprocure materials; and even when they have dragged a stone, a shell, or\r\na chip of reed within building reach, they have often to reject it as\r\nunfit. (J. R.)\r\n\r\n[We have here some examples of the latter kind of nest, _i. e._, those\r\nhabitations which are made of stones and shells. Beginning at the upper\r\nleft-hand figure, we find one that is made of moderately-sized stones\r\ncemented together in a way that reminds the observer of the manner\r\nin which a builder forms irregular stones into a wall. Next to it is\r\nanother, in which the stones are larger and narrower, and are arranged\r\nmuch as some of the caddis-worms arrange pieces of stick and straw.\r\n\r\nIn the second, and on the left-hand side, is a very long and simple\r\ntube, made of a grass stem, and balanced by three little sticks\r\nattached to its centre. The next figure represents a number of\r\nsand-tubes attached to each other. These are built up laboriously\r\nof single particles of sand, and are remarkable for their peculiar\r\nhorn-like shape, the tube having the same regular curve as the horn of\r\nan ox or antelope, and tapering gradually from the base to the top. A\r\nsomewhat similar tube, but of larger size, is shown in the right-hand\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAny one who wishes to see one of these creatures rebuild its house can\r\ndo so by carefully removing it from its tube, and supplying it with\r\nfresh material. Very great care must be taken in the removal, as the\r\ngrub is easily damaged, and it holds so tightly to the tube with a pair\r\nof pincers at the end of its body, that it must rather be coaxed than\r\ndriven out.\r\n\r\nIf desirable, they can be made to build their new houses of most\r\nsingular materials. A lady, Miss Smee, was very successful in a series\r\nof experiments which she made with these insects, forcing them to\r\nmake tubes of different colours and patterns, by supplying them with\r\ncoloured sand, pieces of stained glass of various hues, gold dust, and\r\nsimilar materials. Although there was scarcely any material which they\r\nwould not use, they seemed to consider a certain amount of angularity\r\nas essential, and rejected any object, such as a bead, of which the\r\nsurface was perfectly rounded, while they would accept the same, if it\r\nwere broken or indented.\r\n\r\nWhen the caddis-grub has ceased from feeding, and is about to pass into\r\nthe perfect stage, it spins over the mouth of the tube a strong silken\r\nweb. This web is made in quite a pretty pattern, and being woven with\r\nrather wide meshes, it allows the water to flow through the tube while\r\nit prevents any aquatic foes from penetrating and destroying the pupa.\r\n\r\nThe remaining figures of the illustration represent tubes, around which\r\nare built a quantity of small shells. Generally, stones are mixed\r\nwith the shells; but in some cases, shells seem to be almost the only\r\nmaterial.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCarpenter-Caterpillars.\r\n\r\nInsects, though sometimes actuated by an instinct apparently blind,\r\nunintelligent, or unknown to themselves, manifest in other instances\r\na remarkable adaptation of means to ends. We have it in our power\r\nto exemplify this in a striking manner by the proceedings of the\r\ncaterpillar of a goat-moth (_Cossus ligniperda_) which we kept till it\r\nunderwent its final change.\r\n\r\nThis caterpillar, which abounds in Kent and many other parts of the\r\nisland, feeds on the wood of willows, oaks, poplars, and other trees,\r\nin which it eats extensive galleries; but it is not contented with the\r\nprotection afforded by these galleries during the colder months of\r\nwinter, before the arrival of which it scoops out a hollow in the tree,\r\nif it does not find one ready prepared, sufficiently large to contain\r\nits body in a bent or somewhat coiled-up position. On sawing off a\r\nportion of an old poplar in the winter of 1827, we found such a cell\r\nwith a caterpillar coiled up in it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Caterpillar of Goat-Moth in a Willow Tree.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Winter Nest of the Goat-Caterpillar.]\r\n\r\nIt had not, however, been contented with the bare walls of the retreat\r\nwhich it had hewn out of the tree, for it had lined it with a fabric\r\nas thick as coarse broadcloth, and equally warm, composed of the\r\nraspings of the wood scooped out of the cell, united with the strong\r\nsilk which every species of caterpillar can spin. In this snug retreat\r\nour caterpillar, if it had not been disturbed, would have spent the\r\nwinter without eating; but upon being removed into a warm room and\r\nplaced under a glass along with some pieces of wood, which it might eat\r\nif so inclined, it was roused for a time from its dormant state, and\r\nbegan to move about. It was not long, however, in constructing a new\r\ncell for itself, no less ingenious than the former. It either could not\r\ngnaw into the fir plank, where it was now placed with a glass above it,\r\nor it did not choose to do so; for it left it untouched, and made it\r\nthe basis of the edifice it began to construct. It formed, in fact, a\r\ncovering for itself precisely like the one from which we had dislodged\r\nit,--composed of raspings of wood detached for the purpose from what\r\nhad been given it as food, the largest piece of which was employed as\r\na substantial covering and protection for the whole. It remained in\r\nthis retreat, motionless, and without food, till revived by the warmth\r\nof the ensuing spring, when it gnawed its way out, and began to eat\r\nvoraciously, to make up for its long fast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nest of Goat-Moth.--Figured from specimen, and raised to\r\nshow the Pupa.]\r\n\r\nThese caterpillars are three years in arriving at their final change\r\ninto the winged state; but as the one just mentioned was nearly full\r\ngrown, it began, in the month of May, to prepare a cell, in which it\r\nmight undergo its metamorphosis. Whether it had actually improved its\r\nskill in architecture by its previous experience we will not undertake\r\nto say, but its second cell was greatly superior to the first. In the\r\nfirst there was only one large piece of wood employed; in the second,\r\ntwo pieces were placed in such a manner as to support each other, and\r\nbeneath the angle thus formed an oblong structure was made, composed,\r\nas before, of wood-raspings and silk, but much stronger in texture than\r\nthe winter cell. In a few weeks (four, if we recollect aright) the moth\r\ncame forth. (J. R.)\r\n\r\n[I have now before me a series of three cocoons, made by one\r\ncaterpillar of the goat-moth, showing its increase in size during the\r\nthree years that it remained in the larval state. They were found in\r\nan old willow tree, and occupied different parts of the same burrow.\r\nThe ravages which a goat-moth caterpillar can make in a tree are almost\r\nincredible to those who have not seen the long and tortuous burrows\r\nwhich the insect will construct, burrows which at first are small and\r\ninsignificant, but which afterwards become large enough to admit a\r\nman's finger.\r\n\r\nSometimes the tunnel runs just under the bark, and sometimes it goes\r\nstraight towards the centre of the tree; and no small labour is\r\nrequired before it can be fully traced. Still, the result is worth\r\nthe labour, for it is most interesting to trace the creature through\r\nits whole existence, from the tiny hole which it made soon after its\r\nexit from the egg, to the large aperture through which it emerged as a\r\nmoth. The whole of the tunnel is strongly imbued with the peculiar and\r\nunpleasant odour which has given to the goat-moth its popular name; and\r\nthe scent is so persistent, that it adheres to the fingers which have\r\ntouched the sides of the tunnel, and can scarcely be removed even by\r\nrepeated washings.\r\n\r\nThe moth itself is a well-known insect, though rarely seen except by\r\nnight. It is large, brown, round bodied; the wings are covered with a\r\nsoft and downy clothing, which strongly reminds the observer of the\r\nplumage of an owl.]\r\n\r\nA wood-boring caterpillar, of a species of moth much rarer than the\r\npreceding (_Ægeria asiliformis_, Stephens), exhibits great ingenuity in\r\nconstructing a cell for its metamorphosis. We observed above a dozen\r\nof them during this summer (1829) in the trunk of a poplar, one side\r\nof which had been stripped of its bark. It was this portion of the\r\ntrunk which all the caterpillars selected for their final retreat,\r\nnot one having been observed where the tree was covered with bark. The\r\ningenuity of the little architect consisted in scooping its cell almost\r\nto the very surface of the wood, leaving only an exterior covering of\r\nunbroken wood, as thin as writing-paper. Previous, therefore, to the\r\nchrysalis making its way through this feeble barrier, it could not\r\nhave been suspected that an insect was lodged under the smooth wood.\r\nWe observed more than one of these in the act of breaking through this\r\ncovering, within which there is, besides, a round moveable lid of a\r\nsort of brown wax. (J. R.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Larva of Ægeria.]\r\n\r\nAnother architect caterpillar, frequently to be met with in July on\r\nthe leaves of the willow and the poplar, is, in the fly-state, called\r\nthe puss-moth (_Cerura vinula_). The caterpillar is produced from\r\nbrown-coloured shining eggs, about the size of a pin's head, which\r\nare deposited--one, two, or more together--on the upper surface of a\r\nleaf. In the course of six or eight weeks (during which time it casts\r\nits skin thrice) it arrives at its full growth, when it is about as\r\nthick, and nearly as long, as a man's thumb, and begins to prepare a\r\nstructure in which the pupa may sleep securely during the winter. As we\r\nhave, oftener than once, seen this little architect at work, from the\r\nfoundation till the completion of its edifice, we are thereby enabled\r\nto give the details of the process.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Eggs of the Puss-Moth.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rudiments of the Cell of the Puss-Moth.]\r\n\r\nThe puss, it may be remarked, does not depend for protection on the\r\nhole of a tree, or the shelter of an overhanging branch, but upon\r\nthe solidity and strength of the fabric which it rears. The material\r\nit commonly uses is the bark of the tree upon which the cell is\r\nconstructed; but when this cannot be procured, it is contented to\r\nemploy whatever analogous materials may be within reach. One which we\r\nhad shut up in a box substituted the marble paper it was lined with for\r\nbark, which it could not procure.[BO] With silk it first wove a thin\r\nweb round the edges of the place which it marked out for its edifice,\r\nthen it ran several threads in a spare manner from side to side, and\r\nfrom end to end, but very irregularly in point of arrangement; these\r\nwere intended for the skeleton or framework of the building. When this\r\noutline was finished, the next step was to strengthen each thread of\r\nsilk by adding several (sometimes six or eight) parallel ones, all of\r\nwhich were then glued together into a single thread, by the insect\r\nrunning its mandibles, charged with gluten, along the line. The meshes,\r\nor spaces, which were thus widened by the compression of the parallel\r\nthreads, were immediately filled up with fresh threads, till at length\r\nonly very small spaces were left. It was in this stage of the operation\r\nthat the paper came into requisition, small portions of it being gnawed\r\noff the box and glued into the meshes. It was not, however, into the\r\nmeshes only that the bits of paper were inserted; for the whole fabric\r\nwas in the end thickly studded over with them. In about half a day\r\nfrom the first thread of the framework being spun the building was\r\ncompleted. It was at first, however, rather soft, and yielded to slight\r\npressure with the finger; but as soon as it became thoroughly dry, it\r\nwas so hard that it could with difficulty be penetrated with the point\r\nof a penknife. (J. R.)\r\n\r\n[One puss-moth larva, which I reared, made its nest in a rather curious\r\nmanner. After it had ceased feeding it had been placed on a marble\r\nmantelpiece under a glass tumbler, as a temporary residence until a\r\nmore appropriate dwelling could be found for it. But its instincts\r\nurged it to make its nest without delay, and it accordingly set to\r\nwork, and spun itself up in a cocoon composed entirely of its own silk,\r\nneither the glass tumbler or the mantelpiece affording it any material\r\nwith which to harden the walls of its dwelling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cell built by the Larva of the Puss-Moth.]\r\n\r\nConsequently, the texture of the cocoon was of a rather singular\r\nnature. The silken threads had been fused together so as to form a\r\ntranslucent cocoon, looking as if it had been made of gelatine, and\r\nbeing nearly equally transparent, the chrysalis being plainly visible\r\nthrough its walls. The cocoon was thin and elastic, as if it had been\r\nmade of very thin horn; and it was so tightly fixed to the mantelpiece\r\nas well as to the tumbler, that it could not be removed without damage.\r\nThe moth suffered no injury from the privation which the larva had to\r\nundergo.\r\n\r\nThe cocoons of the puss-moth are to be found upon the trunks of trees,\r\nbut they are so rough, and so greatly resembling the bark, with which,\r\nindeed, their walls are strengthened, that an inexperienced eye would\r\nfail to detect them. Even when they have been pointed out to a novice\r\nin practical entomology, he has failed to find them again whenever his\r\neye has been taken off their rugged outlines.]\r\n\r\nA question will here suggest itself to the curious inquirer, how the\r\nmoth, which is not, like the caterpillar, furnished with mandibles\r\nfor gnawing, can find its way through so hard a wall. To resolve\r\nthis question, it is asserted by recent naturalists (see Kirby and\r\nSpence, vol. iii. p. 15) that the moth is furnished with a peculiar\r\nacid for dissolving itself a passage. We have a specimen of the case\r\nof a puss-moth, in which, notwithstanding its strength, one of the\r\nichneumons had contrived to deposit its eggs. In the beginning of\r\nsummer, when we expected the moth to appear, and felt anxious to\r\nobserve the recorded effects of the acid, we were astonished to find a\r\nlarge orange cuckoo-fly make its escape; while another, which attempted\r\nto follow, stuck by the way and died. On detaching the cell from the\r\nbox, we found several others, which had not been able to get out, and\r\nhad died in their cocoons. (J. R.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ichneumon (_Cphion luteum_), figured from the one\r\nmentioned.]\r\n\r\nAmong the carpenter-grubs may be mentioned that of the purple\r\ncapricorn-beetle (_Callidium violaceum_), of which the Rev. Mr. Kirby\r\nhas given an interesting account in the fifth volume of the 'Linnæan\r\nTransactions.' This insect feeds principally on fir timber which has\r\nbeen felled some time without having had the bark stripped off; but\r\nit is often found on other wood. Though occasionally taken in this\r\nkingdom, it is supposed not to have been originally a native. The\r\ncircumstance of this destructive little animal attacking only such\r\ntimber as had not been stripped of its bark ought to be attended to\r\nby all persons who have any concern in this article; for the bark is\r\na temptation not only to this, but to various other insects; and much\r\nof the injury done in timber might be prevented, if the trees were all\r\nbarked as soon as they were felled. The female is furnished, at the\r\nposterior extremity of her body, with a flat retractile tube, which\r\nshe inserts between the bark and the wood, to the depth of about a\r\nquarter of an inch, and there deposits a single egg. By stripping off\r\nthe bark, it is easy to trace the whole progress of the grub, from\r\nthe spot where it is hatched, to that where it attains its full size.\r\nIt first proceeds in a serpentine direction, filling the space which\r\nit leaves with its excrement, resembling sawdust, and so stopping all\r\ningress to enemies from without. When it has arrived at its utmost\r\ndimensions, it does not confine itself to one direction, but works in\r\na kind of labyrinth, eating backwards and forwards, which gives the\r\nwood under the bark a very irregular surface: by this means its paths\r\nare rendered of considerable width. The bed of its paths exhibits,\r\nwhen closely examined, a curious appearance, occasioned by the\r\ngnawings of its jaws, which excavate an infinity of little ramified\r\ncanals. When the insect is about to assume its chrysalis state, it\r\nbores down obliquely into the solid wood, to the depth sometimes of\r\nthree inches, and seldom if ever less than two, forming holes nearly\r\nsemi-cylindrical, and of exactly the form of the grub which inhabits\r\nthem. At first sight one would wonder how so small and seemingly so\r\nweak an animal could have strength to excavate so deep a mine; but when\r\nwe examine its jaws, our wonder ceases. These are large, thick, and\r\nsolid sections of a cone divided longitudinally, which, in the act of\r\nchewing, apply to each other the whole of their interior plane surface,\r\nso that they grind the insect's food like a pair of millstones. Some\r\nof the grubs are hatched in October; and it is supposed that about the\r\nbeginning of March they assume their chrysalis state. At the place\r\nin the bark opposite to the hole from whence they descended into the\r\nwood, the perfect insects gnaw their way out, which generally takes\r\nplace betwixt the middle of May and the middle of June. These insects\r\nare supposed only to fly in the night, but during the day they may\r\ngenerally be found resting on the wood from which they were disclosed.\r\nThe grubs are destitute of feet, pale, folded, somewhat hairy, convex\r\nabove, and divided into thirteen segments. Their head is large and\r\nconvex.[BP]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Magnified Cells of Pyralis strigulalis?\r\n\r\n_a._ The walls before they are joined. _b._ Walls joined, but not\r\nclosed at top. _c._ Side view of structure complete.]\r\n\r\nIt would not be easy to find a more striking example of ingenuity\r\nthan occurs in a small caterpillar which may be found in May, on the\r\noak, and is supposed by Kirby and Spence to be that of the _Pyralis\r\nstrigulalis_. It is of a whitish-yellow colour, tinged with a shade of\r\ncarnation, and studded with tufts of red hairs on each segment, and\r\ntwo brown spots behind the head. It has fourteen feet, and the upper\r\npart of its body is much flatter than is common in caterpillars. When\r\nthis ingenious little insect begins to form its cell, it selects a\r\nsmooth young branch of the oak, near an offgoing of the branchlets\r\nwhose angle may afford it some protection. It then measures out, with\r\nits body for a rule, the space destined for its structure, the basement\r\nof which is of a triangular form, with the apex at the lower end. The\r\nbuilding itself is composed of small, rectangular, strap-shaped pieces\r\nof the outer bark of the branch cut out from the immediate vicinity;\r\nthe insect indeed never travels further for materials than the length\r\nof its own body. Upon the two longest sides of the triangular base it\r\nbuilds uniform walls, also of a triangular shape, and both gradually\r\ndiverging from each other as they increase in height. These are formed\r\nwith so much mathematical precision, that they fit exactly when they\r\nare afterwards brought into contact. As soon as the little architect\r\nhas completed these walls, which resemble very much the feathers of\r\nan arrow, it proceeds to draw them together in a manner similar to\r\nthat which the leaf-rolling caterpillars employ in constructing their\r\nabodes, by pulling them with silken cords till they bend and converge.\r\nEven when the two longest sides are thus joined, there is an opening\r\nleft at the upper end, which is united in a similar manner. When the\r\nwhole is finished, it requires close inspection to distinguish it from\r\nthe branch, being formed of the same materials, and having consequently\r\nthe same colour and gloss. Concealment, indeed, may be supposed,\r\nwith some justice, to be the final object of the insect in producing\r\nthis appearance, the same principle being extensively exemplified in\r\nnumerous other instances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XI._\r\n\r\nEARTH-MASON CATERPILLARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany species of caterpillars are not only skilful in concealing\r\nthemselves in their cocoons, but also in the concealment of the cocoon\r\nitself; so that even when that is large, as in the instance of the\r\ndeath's-head hawk-moth (_Acherontia atropos_), it is almost impossible\r\nto find it. We allude to the numerous class of caterpillars which,\r\nprevious to their changing into the pupa state, bury themselves in the\r\nearth. This circumstance would not be surprising, were it confined\r\nto those which are but too well known in gardens, from their feeding\r\nupon and destroying the roots of lettuce, chicory, and other plants,\r\nas they pass a considerable portion of their lives under ground; nor\r\nis it surprising that those which retire under ground during the\r\nday, and come abroad to feed in the night, should form their cocoons\r\nwhere they have been in the habit of concealing themselves. But it is\r\nvery singular and unexpected, that caterpillars which pass the whole\r\nof their life on plants and even on trees, should afterwards bury\r\nthemselves in the earth. Yet, the fact is, that perhaps a greater\r\nnumber make their cocoons under than above ground, particularly those\r\nwhich are not clothed with hair.\r\n\r\nSome of those caterpillars which go into the ground previous to their\r\nchange make no cocoon at all, but are contented with a rude masonry of\r\nearth as a nest for their pupæ: into the details of their operations\r\nit will not be so necessary for us to go, as into those which exhibit\r\nmore ingenuity and care. When one of the latter is dug up it has the\r\nappearance of nothing more than a small clod of earth, of a roundish\r\nor oblong shape, but, generally, by no means uniform. The interior,\r\nhowever, when it is laid open, always exhibits a cavity, smooth,\r\npolished, and regular, in which the cocoon or the chrysalis lies secure\r\n(Fig. B, p. 221). The polish of the interior is precisely such as might\r\nbe given to soft earth by moistening and kneading it with great care.\r\nBut beside this, it is usually lined with a tapestry of silk, more or\r\nless thick, though this cannot always be discovered without the aid of\r\na magnifying glass. This species of caterpillars, as soon as they have\r\ncompleted their growth, go into the earth, scoop out, as the cossus\r\ndoes in wood, a hollow cell of an oblong form, and line it with pellets\r\nof earth, from the size of a grain of sand to that of a pea--united, by\r\nsilk or gluten, into a fabric more or less compact, according to the\r\nspecies, but all of them fitted for protecting the inhabitant, during\r\nits winter sleep, against cold and moisture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Outside view of Nests of Earth-mason Caterpillars.]\r\n\r\nOne of the examples of this occurs in the ghost-moth (_Hepialus\r\nhumuli_), which, before it retires into the earth, feeds upon the\r\nroots of the hop or the burdock. Like other insects which construct\r\ncells under ground, it lines the cemented earthen walls of its cell\r\nwith a smooth tapestry of silk, as closely woven as the web of the\r\nhouse-spider.\r\n\r\nInaccurate observers have inferred that these earthen structures were\r\nformed by a very rude and unskilful process--the caterpillar, according\r\nto them, doing nothing more than roll itself round, while the mould\r\nadhered to the gluey perspiration with which they describe its body\r\nto be covered. This is a process as far from the truth as Aristotle's\r\naccount of the spider spinning its web from wool taken from its body.\r\nDid the caterpillar do nothing more than roll itself in the earth, the\r\ncavity would be a long tube fitted exactly to its body (Fig. c): it is\r\nessentially different.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nests, &c., of an Earth-mason Caterpillar.]\r\n\r\nIt does not indeed require very minute observation to perceive that\r\nevery grain of earth in the structure is united to the contiguous\r\ngrains by threads of silk; and that consequently, instead of the whole\r\nhaving been done at once, it must have required very considerable time\r\nand labour. This construction is rendered more obvious by throwing one\r\nof these earthen cases into water, which dissolves the earth, but does\r\nnot act on the silk which binds it together. To understand how this is\r\nperformed, it may not be uninteresting to follow the little mason from\r\nthe beginning of his task.\r\n\r\nWhen one of those burrowing caterpillars has done feeding, it enters\r\nthe earth to the depth of several inches, till it finds mould fit\r\nfor its purpose. Having nowhere to throw the earth which it may dig\r\nout, the only means in its power of forming a cavity is to press it\r\nwith its body; and, by turning round and round for this purpose, an\r\noblong hollow is soon made. But were it left in this state, as Réaumur\r\nwell remarks, though the vault might endure the requisite time by the\r\nviscosity of the earth alone, were no change to take place in its\r\nhumidity, yet, as a great number are wanted to hold out for six, eight,\r\nand ten months, they require to be substantially built; a mere lining\r\nof silk, therefore, would not be sufficient, and it becomes necessary\r\nto have the walls bound with silk to some thickness.\r\n\r\nWhen a caterpillar cannot find earth sufficiently moist to bear\r\nkneading into the requisite consistence, it has the means of moistening\r\nit with a fluid which it ejects for the purpose; and as soon as it has\r\nthus prepared a small pellet of earth, it fits it into the wall of the\r\nvault, and secures it with silk. As the little mason, however, always\r\nworks on the _inside_ of the building, it does not, at first view,\r\nappear in what manner it can procure materials for making one or two\r\nadditional walls on the inside of the one first built. As the process\r\ntakes place under ground, it is not easy to discover the particulars,\r\nfor the caterpillars will not work in glazed boxes. The difficulty was\r\ncompletely overcome by M. Réaumur, in the instance of the caterpillar\r\nof the water-betony moth (_Cucullia scrophulariæ_, Schrank), which he\r\npermitted to construct the greater part of its underground building,\r\nand then dug it up and broke a portion off from the end, leaving about\r\na third part of the whole to be rebuilt. Those who are unacquainted\r\nwith the instinct of insects might have supposed that, being disturbed\r\nby the demolition of its walls, it would have left off work; but\r\nthe stimulus of providing for the great change is so powerful, that\r\nscarcely any disturbance will interrupt a caterpillar in this species\r\nof labour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Earth-mason Caterpillars' Nests, with the perfect Moth,\r\n&c.]\r\n\r\nThe little builder accordingly was not long in recommencing its task\r\nfor the purpose of repairing the disorder, which it accomplished in\r\nabout four hours. At first it protruded its body almost entirely\r\nbeyond the breach which had been made, to reconnoitre the exterior for\r\nbuilding materials. Earth was put within its reach, of the same kind\r\nas it had previously used, and it was not long in selecting a grain\r\nadapted to its purpose, which it fitted into the wall and secured with\r\nsilk. It first enlarged the outside of the wall by the larger and\r\ncoarser grains, and then selected finer for the interior. But before it\r\nclosed the aperture, it collected a quantity of earth on the inside,\r\nwove a pretty thick net-work tapestry of silk over the part which\r\nremained open, and into the meshes of this, by pushing and pressing,\r\nit thrust grains of earth, securing them with silk till the whole\r\nwas rendered opaque; and the further operations of the insect could\r\nno longer be watched, except that it was observed to keep in motion,\r\nfinishing, no doubt, the silken tapestry of the interior of its little\r\nchamber. When it was completed, M. Réaumur ascertained that the portion\r\nof the structure which had been built under his eye was equally thick\r\nand compact with the other, which had been done under ground.\r\n\r\nThe grubs of several of the numerous species of may-fly (_Ephemera_)\r\nexcavate burrows for themselves in soft earth, on the banks of rivers\r\nand canals, under the level of the water, an operation well described\r\nby Scopoli, Swammerdam, and Réaumur. The excavations are always\r\nproportioned to the size of the inhabitant; and consequently, when it\r\nis young and small, the hole is proportionally small, though, with\r\nrespect to extent, it is always at least double the length of its body.\r\nThe hole, being under the level of the river, is always filled with\r\nwater, so that the grub swims in its native element, and while it is\r\nsecure from being preyed upon by fishes, it has its own food within\r\neasy reach. It feeds, in fact, if we may judge from its _egesta_, upon\r\nthe slime or moistened clay with which its hole is lined.\r\n\r\nIn the bank of the stream at Lee, in Kent, we had occasion to take\r\nup an old willow stump, which, previous to its being driven into the\r\nbank, had been perforated in numerous places by the caterpillar of the\r\ngoat-moth (_Cossus ligniperda_). From having been driven amongst the\r\nmoist clay, these perforations became filled with it, and the grubs of\r\nthe ephemeræ found them very suitable for their habitation: for the\r\nwood supplied a more secure protection than if their galleries had been\r\nexcavated in the clay. In these holes of the wood we found several\r\nempty, and some in which were full-grown grubs. (J. R.)\r\n\r\nThe architecture of the grub of a pretty genus of beetles, known to\r\nentomologists by the name of _Cincindela_, is peculiarly interesting.\r\nIt was first made known by the eminent French naturalists, Geoffroy,\r\nDesmarest, and Latreille. This grub, which may be met with during\r\nspring, and also in summer and autumn, in sandy places, is long,\r\ncylindric, soft whitish, and furnished with six scaly brown feet.\r\nThe head is of a square form, with six or eight eyes, and very large\r\nin proportion to the body. They have strong jaws, and on the eighth\r\njoint of the body there are two fleshy tubercles, thickly clothed with\r\nreddish hairs, and armed with a recurved horny spine, the whole giving\r\nto the grub the form of the letter Z.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nest of the Grubs of Ephemeræ.\r\n\r\nA, The Grub. B, Perforations in a river bank. C, One laid open to show\r\nthe parallel structure.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nests of Ephemeræ in holes of Cossus.]\r\n\r\nWith their jaws and feet they dig into the earth to the depth of\r\neighteen inches, forming a cylindrical cavity of greater diameter\r\nthan their body, and furnished with a perpendicular entrance. In\r\nconstructing this, the grub first clears away the particles of earth\r\nand sand by placing them on its broad trapezoidal head, and carrying\r\nthe load in this manner beyond the area of the excavation. When it gets\r\ndeeper down, it climbs gradually up to the surface with similar loads\r\nby means of the tubercles on its back, above described. This process\r\nis a work of considerable time and difficulty, and in carrying its\r\nloads the insect has often to rest by the way to recover strength for\r\na renewed exertion. Not unfrequently, it finds the soil so ill adapted\r\nto its operations, that it abandons the task altogether, and begins\r\nanew in another situation. When it has succeeded in forming a complete\r\nden, it fixes itself at the entrance by the hooks of its tubercles,\r\nwhich are admirably adapted for the purpose, forming a fulcrum or\r\nsupport, while the broad plate on the top of the head exactly fits the\r\naperture of the excavation, and is on a level with the soil. In this\r\nposition the grub remains immovable, with jaws expanded, and ready\r\nto seize and devour every insect which may wander within its reach,\r\nparticularly the smaller beetles; and its voracity is so great, that\r\nit does not spare even its own species. It precipitates its prey into\r\nthe excavation, and in case of danger it retires to the bottom of its\r\nden, a circumstance which renders it not a little difficult to discover\r\nthe grub. The method adopted by the French naturalists was to introduce\r\na straw or pliant twig into the hole, while they dug away, by degrees\r\nand with great care, the earth around it, and usually found the grub at\r\nthe bottom of the cell, resting in a zig-zag position like one of the\r\ncaterpillars of the geometric moths.\r\n\r\nWhen it is about to undergo its transformation into a pupa, it\r\ncarefully closes the mouth of the den, and retires to the bottom in\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that the grub of the genus _Cincindela_ uses the\r\nexcavation just described for the purpose of a trap or pitfall, any\r\nfurther than that it can more effectually secure its prey by tumbling\r\nthem down into it; but there are other species of grubs which\r\nconstruct pitfalls for the express purpose of traps. Among these is\r\nthe larva of a fly (_Rhagio vermileo_), not unlike the common flesh\r\nmaggot. The den which it constructs is in the form of a funnel, the\r\nsides of which are composed of sand or loose earth. It forms this\r\npitfall of considerable depth, by throwing out the earth obliquely on\r\nall sides; and when its trap is finished, it stretches itself along the\r\nbottom, remaining stiff and motionless, like a piece of wood. The last\r\nsegment of the body is bent at an angle with the rest, so as to form a\r\nstrong point of support in the struggles which it must often have to\r\nencounter with vigorous prey. The instant that an insect tumbles into\r\nthe pitfall, the grub pounces upon it, writhes itself round it like a\r\nserpent, transfixes it with its jaws, and sucks its juices at its ease.\r\nShould the prey by any chance escape, the grub hurls up jets of sand\r\nand earth, with astonishing rapidity and force, and not unfrequently\r\nsucceeds in again precipitating it to the bottom of its trap.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ant-Lion.\r\n\r\nThe observations of the continental naturalists have made known to us a\r\npitfall constructed by an insect, the details of whose operations are\r\nexceedingly curious; we refer to the grub of the ant-lion (_Myrmeleon\r\nformicarius_), which, though marked by Dr. Turton and Mr. Stewart as\r\nBritish, has not (at least of late years) been found in this country.\r\nAs it is not, however, uncommon in France and Switzerland, it is\r\nprobable it may yet be discovered in some spot hitherto unexplored, and\r\nif so, it will well reward the search of the curious.\r\n\r\nThe ant-lion grub being of a grey colour, and having its body composed\r\nof rings, is not unlike a wood-louse (_Oniscus_), though it is larger,\r\nmore triangular, has only six legs, and most formidable jaws, in\r\nform of a reaping-hook, or a pair of calliper compasses. These jaws,\r\nhowever, are not for masticating, but are perforated and tubular,\r\nfor the purpose of sucking the juices of ants, upon which it feeds.\r\nVallisnieri was therefore mistaken, as Réaumur well remarks, when he\r\nsupposed that he had discovered its mouth. Its habits require that\r\nit should walk backwards, and this is the only species of locomotion\r\nwhich it can perform. Even this sort of motion it executes very slowly;\r\nand were it not for the ingenuity of its stratagems, it would fare\r\nbut sparingly, since its chief food consists of ants, whose activity\r\nand swiftness of foot would otherwise render it impossible for it to\r\nmake a single capture. Nature, however, in this, as in nearly every\r\nother case, has given a compensating power to the individual animal,\r\nto balance its privations. The ant-lion is slow, but it is extremely\r\nsagacious; it cannot follow its prey, but it can entrap it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Grub of the Ant-Lion, magnified, with one perfect Trap,\r\nand another begun.]\r\n\r\nThe snare which the grub of the ant-lion employs consists of a\r\nfunnel-shaped excavation formed in loose sand, at the bottom of which\r\nit lies in wait for the ants that chance to stumble over the margin,\r\nand cannot, from the looseness of the walls, gain a sufficient footing\r\nto effect their escape.\r\n\r\nBy shutting up one of these grubs in a box with loose sand, it has been\r\nrepeatedly observed constructing its trap of various dimensions, from\r\none to nearly three inches in diameter, according to circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn the 'Magazine of Natural History,' 1838, p. 601, Mr. Westwood gives\r\na very interesting account of the mode in which the ant-lion proceeds\r\nin the excavation of its pitfall, as witnessed by himself in specimens\r\nprocured in the Parc de Belle Vue, near Paris, where, at the foot of a\r\nvery high sand-bank, these pits were numerous, and of various sizes,\r\nbut none exceeded an inch and a half or two inches in diameter, and\r\ntwo-thirds of an inch deep. \"The ant-lions were of various sizes,\r\ncorresponding to the size of their retreats. I brought many of them\r\nto Paris, placing several together in a box filled with sand. They,\r\nhowever, destroyed one another whilst shut up in these boxes; and I\r\nonly succeeded in bringing three of them alive to England, one of\r\nwhich almost immediately afterwards (on the 23rd of July) enclosed\r\nitself in a globular cocoon of fine sand. The other two afforded me\r\nmany opportunities of observing their proceedings. They were unable to\r\nwalk forwards,--an anomalous circumstance, and not often met with in\r\nanimals furnished with well-developed legs. It is generally backwards,\r\nworking in a spiral direction, that the creature moves, pushing itself\r\nbackwards and downwards at the same time, the head being carried\r\nhorizontally, and the back much arched, so that the extremity of the\r\nbody is forced into the sand. In this manner it proceeds backwards (to\r\nuse an Hibernianism), forming little mole-hills in the sand. But it\r\ndoes not appear to me that this retrograde motion has anything to do\r\nwith the actual formation of the cell, since, as soon as it has fixed\r\nupon a spot for its retreat, it commences throwing up the sand with the\r\nback of its head, jerking the sand either behind its back or on one or\r\nthe other side. It shuts its long jaws, forming them into a kind of\r\nshovel, the sharp edges of which it thrusts laterally into the sand\r\non each side of its head, and thereby contrives to lodge a quantity\r\nof the sand upon the head as well as the jaws. The motion is in fact\r\nsomething like that of the head of a goat, especially when butting\r\nsideways in play. In this manner it contrives to throw away the sand,\r\nand by degrees to make a hole entirely with its head, the fore legs\r\nnot affording the slightest assistance in the operation. During this\r\nperformance the head only is exposed, the insect having previously\r\npushed itself beneath the surface of the sand; but when it has made the\r\nhole sufficiently deep, it withdraws the head also, leaving only the\r\njaws exposed, which are spread open in a line, and laid on the sand so\r\nas to be scarcely visible. If alarmed, the insect immediately takes a\r\nstep backwards, withdrawing the jaws; but when an insect falls into\r\nthe hole, the jaws are instinctively and instantaneously closed, and\r\nthe insect seized by the leg, wing, or body, just as it may chance to\r\nfall within the reach of the ant-lion's jaws. If, however, the insect\r\nbe not seized, but attempts to escape, no matter in what direction, the\r\nant-lion immediately begins twisting its head about, and shovelling up\r\nthe sand with the greatest agility, jerking it about on each side and\r\nbackwards, but never forwards, as misrepresented in some figures, until\r\nthe hole is made so much deeper, and such a disturbance caused in the\r\nsides of the hole, that the insect is almost sure to be brought down\r\nto the bottom, when it is seized by the ant-lion, which immediately\r\nendeavours to draw it beneath the sand; and if it be very boisterous,\r\nthe ant-lion beats it about, holding it firmly by the jaws until it is\r\ntoo weak for further resistance. Hence, as the head of the ant-lion is\r\nimmersed in the sand, it is evident that the accounts given in popular\r\nworks of the instinct by which it throws the sand in the direction of\r\nthe escaping prey are not quite correct. The act of throwing up the\r\nsand, when an insect has fallen into the pit and attempts to escape,\r\nhas evidently for its chief object that of making the pit deeper and\r\nmore conical, and therefore more difficult of ascent.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ant-Lion's Pitfalls, in an experimenting-box.]\r\n\r\nIt is by the action of the hinder pair of its legs that the ant-lion\r\ndrags itself backwards, the other four pair being extended trailing\r\nafter it, and leaving an impression on the surface of the fine sand\r\nover which it has passed; and when burrowing its way beneath the\r\nsurface of the sand, it proceeds by short steps backwards. A portion\r\nof sand at each step is thrown on the head, owing to the hump-like\r\nform of the back: this is immediately jerked away, the body at the\r\nsame time advancing another step in its backward and spiral motion.\r\nWhere it rests, a little hillock of sand is raised by the body of the\r\nant-lion underneath; while its jaws emerge and spread flat on the\r\nsurface. It now probably commences its pitfall, the mode of excavating\r\nwhich we have given in detail. From the spiral course described by the\r\nant-lion in its backward progress appears to have arisen the idea of\r\nits tracing out a circle as the outline of its pitfall--as would an\r\narchitect or engineer; but whence sprang the often-repeated statement,\r\nthat the ant-lion loads its head with sand by means of one of its legs,\r\nthat nearest the centre of the circle, we cannot conjecture. Nor do we\r\nknow how, as it works entirely buried with the exception of the head,\r\nthe ant-lion can act when it meets with a stone or other obstacle, as\r\nM. Bonnet states he has repeatedly witnessed. He observes that if the\r\nstone be small, it can manage to jerk it out in the same manner as the\r\nsand; but when it is two or three times larger and heavier than its\r\nown body, it must have recourse to other means of removal. The larger\r\nstones it usually leaves till the last; and when it has removed all\r\nthe sand which it intends, it then proceeds to try what it can do with\r\nthe less manageable obstacles. For this purpose it crawls backwards\r\nto the place where a stone may be, and thrusting its tail under it,\r\nis at great pains to get it properly balanced on its back, by an\r\nalternate motion of the rings composing its body. When it has succeeded\r\nin adjusting the stone, it crawls up the side of the pit with great\r\ncare, and deposits its burthen on the outside of the circle. Should\r\nthe stone happen to be round, the balance can be kept only with the\r\ngreatest difficulty, as it has to travel with its load upon a slope\r\nof loose sand, which is ready to give way at every step; and often\r\nwhen the insect has carried it to the very brink, it rolls off its\r\nback and tumbles down to the bottom of the pit. This accident, so far\r\nfrom discouraging the ant-lion, only stimulates it to more persevering\r\nefforts. Bonnet observed it renew these attempts to dislodge a stone\r\nfive or six times. It is only when it finds it utterly impossible to\r\nsucceed, that it abandons the design and commences another pit in\r\na fresh situation. When it succeeds in getting a stone beyond the\r\nline of its circle, it is not contented with letting it rest there;\r\nbut, to prevent it from again rolling in, it goes on to push it to a\r\nconsiderable distance. We maybe pardoned for pausing before we give\r\nfull credence to these details.\r\n\r\nThe ant-lion feeds only on the blood or juice of insects; and as soon\r\nas it has extracted these, it tosses the dry carcase out of its den.\r\n\r\nWhen it is about to change into a pupa, it proceeds in nearly the\r\nsame manner as the caterpillar of the water-betony moth (_Cucullia\r\nscrophulariæ_). It first builds a case of sand, the particles of which\r\nare secured by threads of silk, and then tapestries the whole with a\r\nsilken web. Within this it undergoes its transformation into a pupa,\r\nand in due time it emerges in form of a four-winged fly, closely\r\nresembling the dragon-flies (_Libellulæ_), vulgarly and erroneously\r\ncalled _horse-stingers_.\r\n\r\nThe instance of the ant-lion naturally leads us to consider the design\r\nof the Author of Nature in so nicely adjusting, in all animals, the\r\nmeans of destruction and of escape. As the larger quadrupeds of prey\r\nare provided with a most ingenious machinery for preying on the weaker,\r\nso are those furnished with the most admirable powers of evading their\r\ndestroyers.\r\n\r\nIn the economy of insects, we constantly observe that the means of\r\ndefence, not only of the individual creatures, but of their larvæ\r\nand pupæ, against the attacks of other insects, and of birds, is\r\nproportioned, in the ingenuity of their arrangements, to the weakness\r\nof the insect employing them. Those species which multiply the quickest\r\nhave the greatest number of enemies. Bradley, an English naturalist,\r\nhas calculated that two sparrows carry, in the course of a week, above\r\nthree thousand caterpillars to the young in their nests. But though\r\nthis is, probably, much beyond the truth, it is certain that there is\r\na great and constant destruction of individuals going forward; and yet\r\nthe species is never destroyed. In this way a balance is kept up, by\r\nwhich one portion of animated nature cannot usurp the means of life and\r\nenjoyment which the world offers to another portion. In all matters\r\nrelating to reproduction, Nature is prodigal in her arrangements.\r\nInsects have more stages to pass through before they attain their\r\nperfect growth than other creatures. The continuation of the species\r\nis, therefore, in many cases, provided for by a much larger number\r\nof eggs being deposited than ever become fertile. How many larvæ are\r\nproduced, in comparison with the number which pass into the pupa\r\nstate; and how many pupæ perish before they become perfect insects!\r\nEvery garden is covered with caterpillars; and yet how few moths and\r\nbutterflies, comparatively, are seen, even in the most sunny season?\r\nInsects which lay few eggs are, commonly, most remarkable in their\r\ncontrivances for their preservation. The dangers to which insect life\r\nis exposed are manifold; and therefore are the contrivances for its\r\npreservation of the most perfect kind, and invariably adapted to the\r\npeculiar habits of each tribe. The same wisdom determines the food of\r\nevery species of insect; and thus some are found to delight in the\r\nrose-tree, and some in the oak. Had it been otherwise, the balance of\r\nvegetable life would not have been preserved. It is for this reason\r\nthat the contrivances which an insect employs for obtaining its\r\nfood are curious, in proportion to the natural difficulties of its\r\nstructure. The ant-lion is carnivorous, but he has not the quickness\r\nof the spider, nor can he spread a net over a large surface, and\r\nissue from his citadel to seize a victim which he has caught in his\r\nout-works. He is therefore taught to dig a trap, where he sits like\r\nthe unwieldy giants of fable, waiting for some feeble one to cross\r\nhis path. How laborious and patient are his operations--how uncertain\r\nthe chances of success! Yet he never shrinks from them, because his\r\ninstinct tells him that by these contrivances alone can he preserve his\r\nown existence, and continue that of his species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XII._\r\n\r\nCLOTHES-MOTH AND OTHER TENT-MAKING CATERPILLARS.--LEAF AND BARK MINERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are at least five different species of moths similar in manners\r\nand economy, the caterpillars of which feed upon animal substances,\r\nsuch as furs, woollen cloths, silk, leather, and, what to the\r\nnaturalist is no less vexing, upon the specimens of insects and other\r\nanimals preserved in his cabinet. The moths in question are of the\r\nfamily named _Tinea_ by entomologists, such as the tapestry-moth\r\n(_Tinea tapetzella_), the fur-moth (_Tinea pellionella_), the wool-moth\r\n(_Tinea vestianella_), the cabinet-moth (_Tinea destructor_, Stephens),\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nThe moths themselves are, in the winged state, small and well fitted\r\nfor making their way through the most minute hole or chink, so that it\r\nis scarcely possible to exclude them by the closeness of a wardrobe or\r\na cabinet.[BQ] If they cannot effect an entrance when a drawer is out,\r\nor a door open, they will contrive to glide through the key-hole; and\r\nif they once get in, it is no easy matter to dislodge or destroy them,\r\nfor they are exceedingly agile, and escape out of sight in a moment.\r\nMoufet is of opinion that the ancients possessed an effectual method of\r\npreserving stuffs from the moth, because the robes of Servius Tullius\r\nwere preserved up to the death of Sejanus, a period of more than five\r\nhundred years. On turning to Pliny to learn this secret, we find him\r\nrelating that stuff laid upon a coffin will be ever after safe from\r\nmoths; in the same way as a person once stung by a scorpion will never\r\nafterwards be stung by a bee, or a wasp, or a hornet! Rhasis, again,\r\nsays that cantharides suspended in a house drive away moths; and he\r\nadds that they will not touch anything wrapped in a lion's skin!--the\r\npoor little insects, says Réaumur, sarcastically, being probably in\r\nbodily fear of so terrible an animal.[BR] Such are the stories which\r\nfill the imagination even of philosophers, till real science entirely\r\nexpels them.\r\n\r\nThe effluvium of camphor or turpentine, or fumigation by sulphur or\r\nchlorine, may sometimes kill them, when in the winged state, but this\r\nwill have no effect upon their eggs, and seldom upon the caterpillars;\r\nfor they wrap themselves up too closely to be easily reached by any\r\nagent except heat. This, when it can be conveniently applied, will\r\nbe certain either to dislodge or to kill them. When the effluvium of\r\nturpentine, however, reaches the caterpillar, Bonnet says it falls into\r\nconvulsions, becomes covered with livid blotches, and dies.[BS]\r\n\r\nThe mother insect takes care to deposit her eggs on or near such\r\nsubstances as she instinctively foreknows will be best adapted for the\r\nfood of the young, taking care to distribute them so that there may\r\nbe a plentiful supply and enough of room for each. We have found, for\r\nexample, some of those caterpillars feeding upon the shreds of cloth\r\nused in training wall-fruit trees; but we never saw more than two\r\ncaterpillars on one shred. This scattering of the eggs in many places\r\nrenders the effects of the caterpillars more injurious, from their\r\nattacking many parts of a garment or a piece of stuff at the same time.\r\n(J. R.)\r\n\r\nWhen one of the caterpillars of this family issues from the egg, its\r\nfirst care is to provide itself with a domicile, which indeed seems no\r\nless indispensable to it than food; for, like all caterpillars that\r\nfeed under cover, it will not eat while it remains unprotected. Its\r\nmode of building is very similar to that which is employed by other\r\ncaterpillars that make use of extraneous materials. The foundation\r\nor framework is made of silk secreted by itself, and into this it\r\ninterweaves portions of the material upon which it feeds. It is said by\r\nBingley, that \"after having spun a fine coating of silk _immediately\r\naround its body_, it cuts the filaments of the wool or fur close by\r\nthe thread of the cloth, or by the skin, with its teeth, which act\r\nin the manner of scissors, into convenient lengths, and applies the\r\nbits, one by one, with great dexterity, to the _outside_ of its silken\r\ncase.\"[BT] This statement, however, is erroneous, and inconsistent with\r\nthe proceedings not only of the clothes-moth, but of every caterpillar\r\nthat constructs a covering. None of these build from within outwards,\r\nbut uniformly commence with the exterior wall, and finish by lining the\r\ninterior with the finest materials. Réaumur, however, found that the\r\nnewly-hatched caterpillars lived at first in a case of silk.\r\n\r\nWe have repeatedly witnessed the proceedings of these insects from the\r\nvery foundation of their structures; and, at the moment of writing\r\nthis, we turned out one from the carcase of an \"old lady moth\" (_Mormo\r\nmaura_, Ochsenheim) in our cabinet, and placed it on a desk covered\r\nwith green cloth, where it might find materials for constructing\r\nanother dwelling. It wandered about for half a day before it began its\r\noperations; but it did not, as is asserted by Bonnet, and Kirby and\r\nSpence, \"in moving from place to place, seem to be as much incommoded\r\nby the long hairs which surround it, as we are by walking amongst high\r\ngrass,\" nor, \"accordingly, marching scythe in hand,\" did it, \"with its\r\nteeth, cut out a smooth road.\"[BU] On contrary, it did not cut a single\r\nhair till it selected one for the foundation of its intended structure.\r\nThis it cut very near the cloth, in order, we suppose, to have it\r\nas long as possible; and placed it on a line with its body. It then\r\nimmediately cut another, and placing it parallel to the first, bound\r\nboth together with a few threads of its own silk. The same process\r\nwas repeated with other hairs, till the little creature had made a\r\nfabric of some thickness, and this it went on to extend till it was\r\nlarge enough to cover its body; which (as is usual with caterpillars)\r\nit employed as a model and measure for regulating its operations. We\r\nremarked that it made choice of longer hairs for the outside than for\r\nthe parts of the interior, which it thought necessary to strengthen by\r\nfresh additions; but the chamber was ultimately finished by a fine and\r\nclosely-woven tapestry of silk. We could see the progress of its work\r\nby looking into the opening at either of the ends; for at this stage\r\nof the structure the walls are quite opaque, and the insect concealed.\r\nIt may be thus observed to turn round, by doubling itself and bringing\r\nits head where the tail had just been; of course, the interior is left\r\nwide enough for this purpose, and the centre, indeed, where it turns,\r\nis always wider than the extremities. (J. R.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cases, &c., of the Clothes-Moth (_Tinea\r\npellionella_).--_a_. Caterpillar feeding in a case, which has been\r\nlengthened by ovals of different colours; _b_. Case cut at the ends for\r\nexperiment; _c_. Case cut open by the insect for enlarging it; _d_,\r\n_e_. The clothes-moths in their perfect state, when, as they cease to\r\neat, they do no further injury.]\r\n\r\nWhen the caterpillar increases in length, it takes care to add to\r\nthe length of its house, by working in fresh hairs at either end;\r\nand if it be shifted to stuffs of different colours, it may be made\r\nto construct a party-coloured tissue, like a Scotch plaid. Réaumur\r\ncut off with scissors a portion at each end, to compel the insect to\r\nmake up the deficiency. But the caterpillar increases in thickness\r\nas well as in length, so that, its first house becoming too narrow,\r\nit must either enlarge it, or build a new one. It prefers the former\r\nas less troublesome, and accomplishes its purpose \"as dexterously,\"\r\nsays Bonnet, \"as any tailor, and sets to work precisely as we should\r\ndo, slitting the case on the two opposite sides, and then adroitly\r\ninserting between them two pieces of the requisite size. It does not,\r\nhowever, cut open the case from one end to the other at once; the\r\nsides would separate too far asunder, and the insect be left naked. It\r\ntherefore first cuts each side about half-way down, beginning sometimes\r\nat the centre and sometimes at the end (Fig. _c_), and then, after\r\nhaving filled up the fissure, proceeds to cut the remaining half; so\r\nthat, in fact, four enlargements are made, and four separate pieces\r\ninserted. The colour of the case is always the same as that of the\r\nstuff from which it is taken. Thus, if its original colour be blue,\r\nand the insect, previously to enlarging it, be put upon red cloth,\r\nthe circles at the end, and two stripes down the middle, will be\r\nred.\"[BV] Réaumur found that they cut these enlargements in no precise\r\norder, but sometimes continuously, and sometimes opposite each other,\r\nindifferently.\r\n\r\nThe same naturalist says he never knew one leave its old dwelling\r\nin order to build a new; though, when once ejected by force from\r\nits house, it would never enter it again, as some other species of\r\ncaterpillars will do, but always preferred building another. We, on\r\nthe contrary, have more than once seen them leave an old habitation.\r\nThe very caterpillar, indeed, whose history we have above given, first\r\ntook up its abode in a specimen of the ghost-moth (_Hepialus humuli_),\r\nwhere, finding few suitable materials for building, it had recourse to\r\nthe cork of the drawer, with the chips of which it made a structure\r\nalmost as warm as it would have done from wool. Whether it took offence\r\nat our disturbing it one day, or whether it did not find sufficient\r\nfood in the body of the ghost-moth, we know not; but it left its cork\r\nhouse, and travelled about eighteen inches, selected \"the old lady,\"\r\none of the largest insects in the drawer, and built a new apartment,\r\ncomposed partly of cork as before, and partly of bits clipt out of the\r\nmoth's wings. (J. R.)\r\n\r\nWe have seen these caterpillars form their habitations of every sort\r\nof insect, from a butterfly to a beetle; and the soft, feathery wings\r\nof moths answer their purpose very well: but when they fall in with\r\nsuch hard materials as the musk beetle (_Cerambyx moschatus_), or the\r\nlarge scolopendra of the West Indies, they find some difficulty in the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Transformations of the honeycomb-moths. _a_ _a_ _a_,\r\nGalleries of the cell-boring caterpillar; _b_, the female; _c_, the\r\nmale moth (_Galleria alvearia_); _d_ _d_ _d_ _d_, galleries of the\r\nwax-eating caterpillar, _e_, seen at the entrance; _f_, the same\r\nexposed; _g_, its cocoon; _h_, the moth (_Galleria cereana_).]\r\n\r\nWhen the structure is finished, the insect deems itself secure to feed\r\non the materials of the cloth or other animal matter within its reach,\r\nprovided it is dry and free from fat or grease, which Réaumur found it\r\nwould not touch. This may probably be the origin of the practice of\r\nputting a bit of candle with furs, &c., to preserve them from the moth.\r\nFor building, it always selects the straightest and loosest pieces of\r\nwool, but for food it prefers the shortest and most compact; and to\r\nprocure these it eats into the body of the stuff, rejecting the pile\r\nor nap, which it necessarily cuts across at the origin, and permits\r\nto fall, leaving it threadbare, as if it had been much worn. It must\r\nhave been this circumstance which induced Bonnet to fancy (as we have\r\nalready mentioned) that it cuts the hairs to make itself a smooth,\r\ncomfortable path to walk upon. It would be equally correct to say that\r\nan ox or a sheep dislikes walking amongst long grass, and therefore\r\neats it down in order to clear the way.\r\n\r\n[There is a little insect closely allied to these moths, which does a\r\nvast amount of harm to the bee-combs. This is the honeycomb-moth, of\r\nwhich there are in England two species, both belonging to the genus\r\nGalleria. This little creature is continually trying to make its\r\nway into the hives, and is as continually opposed by the bees, who\r\ninstinctively know their enemy. If it once slips past the guards, the\r\nunfortunate bees are doomed to lose a considerable amount of their\r\nstored treasures, and have sometimes been so worried that they have\r\nbeen obliged to leave the hive altogether.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it can hide itself in an empty cell--an easy matter enough\r\nfor so tiny a moth, which harmonizes exactly in colour with the\r\nbee-combs--it proceeds to lay its eggs, and, having discharged its\r\noffice, dies. The eggs soon hatch into little grubs and caterpillars\r\nwith very hard horny heads and soft bodies. As soon as they come into\r\nthe dark world of the hive, they begin to eat their way through the\r\ncombs, spinning the while a tunnel of silk, which entirely protects\r\nthem from the stings of the bees. They can traverse these tunnels with\r\ntolerable speed, so that the bees do not know where to find their\r\nenemies; and if perchance they should discover one of them at the mouth\r\nof its burrow, the hard, horny head is all that is visible, and against\r\nits polished surface the sting of the bee is useless. The rapidity\r\nwith which they drive the silken tubes through the comb is really\r\nmarvellous; and even if they get among a collection of empty bee-combs,\r\nthey make as much havoc as if they were bred in the hive from which the\r\ncombs were taken.\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying illustration are seen figures of the two species\r\nof honey-moths, together with their tunnels. The species may be easily\r\ndistinguished by the shape of the wings, _Galleria alvearia_ having, as\r\nseen at Figs. _b_, _c_, the ends of its wings rounded, and _Galleria\r\ncereana_ having them squared.\r\n\r\nSome moths, also belonging to the vast Family Tineidæ, do much damage\r\nto grain, and have also the habit of spinning silken tissues as they\r\neat their way through the grain. One of them is more plentiful on the\r\nContinent than in England, but is known in this country by the name of\r\nthe mottled woollen moth (_Tinea granella_)].\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar, which is smooth and white, ties together with silk\r\nseveral grains of wheat, barley, rye, or oats, weaving a gallery\r\nbetween them, from which it projects its head while feeding; the\r\ngrains, as Réaumur remarks, being prevented from rolling or slipping\r\nby the silk which unites them. He justly ridicules the absurd notion\r\nof its filing off the outer skin of the wheat by rubbing upon it with\r\nits body, the latter being the softer of the two, and he disproved, by\r\nexperiment, Leeuwenhoeck's assertion that it will also feed on woollen\r\ncloth. It is from the end of May till the beginning of July that the\r\nmoths, which are of a silvery grey, spotted with brown, appear and lay\r\ntheir eggs in granaries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Transformations of the Grain-moths. _a_, Grain of\r\nbarley, including a caterpillar; _b_, _c_, the grain cut across,\r\nseen to be hollowed out, and divided by a partition of silk; _d_,\r\nthe moth (_Tinea Hordei_); _e_, grains of wheat tied together by\r\nthe caterpillar; _f_, _g_, the caterpillar and moth (_Euplocamus\r\ngranella_).]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar of another still more singular grain-moth (_Tinea\r\nHordei_, Kirby and Spence) proves sometimes very destructive of\r\ngranaries. The mother-moth, in May or June, lays about twenty or\r\nmore eggs on a grain of barley or wheat; and when the caterpillars\r\nare hatched they disperse, each selecting a single grain. M. Réaumur\r\nimagines that sanguinary wars must sometimes arise, in cases of\r\npreoccupancy, a single grain of barley being a rich heritage for one\r\nof these tiny insects; but he confesses he never saw such contests.\r\nWhen the caterpillar has eaten its way into the interior of the grain,\r\nit feeds on the farina, taking care not to gnaw the skin nor even to\r\nthrow out its excrements, so that except the little hole, scarcely\r\ndiscernible, the grain appears quite sound. When it has eaten all the\r\nfarina, it spins itself a case of silk within the now hollow grain, and\r\nchanges to a pupa in November.\r\n\r\n\r\nTent-making Caterpillars.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars of a family of small moths (_Tineidæ_), which feed on\r\nthe leaves of various trees, such as the hawthorn, the elm, the oak,\r\nand most fruit-trees, particularly the pear, form habitations which are\r\nexceedingly ingenious and elegant. They are so very minute that they\r\nrequire close inspection to discover them; and to the cursory observer,\r\nunacquainted with their habits, they will appear more like the withered\r\nleaf-scales of the tree, thrown off when the buds expand, than\r\nartificial structures made by insects. It is only, indeed, by seeing\r\nthem move about upon the leaves, that we discover they are inhabited by\r\na living tenant, who carries them as the snail does its shell.\r\n\r\nThese tents are from a quarter of an inch to an inch in length, and\r\nusually about the breadth of an oat-straw. That they are of the colour\r\nof a withered leaf is not surprising; for they are actually composed of\r\na piece of leaf; not, however, cut out from the whole thickness, but\r\nartfully separated from the upper layer, as a person might separate one\r\nof the leaves of paper from a sheet of pasteboard.\r\n\r\nThe tents of this class of caterpillars, which are found on the\r\nelm, the alder, and other trees with serrated leaves, are much in\r\nthe shape of a minute goldfish. They are convex on the back, where\r\nthe indentations of the leaf out of which they have been cut add to\r\nthe resemblance, by appearing like the dorsal fins of the fish. By\r\ndepriving one of those caterpillars common on the hawthorn of its\r\ntents, for the sake of experiment, we put it under the necessity of\r\nmaking another; for, as Pliny remarks of the clothes-moth, they will\r\nrather die of hunger than feed unprotected. When we placed it on a\r\nfresh hawthorn leaf, it repeatedly examined every part of it, as if\r\nseeking for its lost tent, though, when this was put in its way, it\r\nwould not again enter it; but, after some delay, commenced a new one.\r\n(J. R.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Caterpillar's tent upon a leaf of the elm.--_a_, _a_,\r\nThe part of the leaf from which the tent has been cut out; _b_, the\r\ntent itself.]\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, it began to eat through one of the two outer\r\nmembranes which compose the leaf and enclose the pulp (_parenchyma_),\r\nsome of which, also, it devoured, and then thrust the hinder part\r\nof its body into the perforation. The cavity, however, which it had\r\nformed, being yet too small for its reception, it immediately resumed\r\nthe task of making it larger. By continuing to gnaw into the pulp\r\n_between_ the membranes of the leaf (for it took the greatest care not\r\nto puncture or injure the membranes themselves), it soon succeeded in\r\nmining out a gallery rather larger than was sufficient to contain its\r\nbody. We perceived that it did not throw out as rubbish the pulp it dug\r\ninto, but devoured it as food--a circumstance not the least remarkable\r\nin its proceedings.\r\n\r\nAs the two membranes of leaf thus deprived of the enclosed pulp\r\nappeared white and transparent, every movement of the insect within\r\ncould be distinctly seen; and it was not a little interesting to\r\nwatch its ingenious operations while it was making its tent from the\r\nmembranes prepared as we have just described. These, as Réaumur has\r\nremarked, are in fact to the insect like a piece of cloth in the hands\r\nof a tailor; and no tailor could cut out a shape with more neatness\r\nand dexterity than this little workman does. As the caterpillar is\r\nfurnished in its mandibles with an excellent pair of scissors, this\r\nmay not appear to be a difficult task; yet, when we examine the matter\r\nmore minutely, we find that the peculiar shape of the two extremities\r\nrequires different curvatures, and this, of course, renders the\r\noperation no less complex, as Réaumur subjoins, than the shaping of\r\nthe pieces of cloth for a coat.[BW] The insect, in fact, shapes the\r\nmembranes slightly convex on one side and concave on the other, and at\r\none end twice as large as the other. In the instance which we observed,\r\nbeginning at the larger end, it bent them gently on each side by\r\npressing them with its body thrown into a curve. We have not said it\r\n_cuts_, but _shapes_ its materials; for it must be obvious that if the\r\ninsect had cut both the membranes at this stage of its operations, the\r\npieces would have fallen and carried it along with them.\r\n\r\nTo obviate such an accident it proceeded to join the two edges, and\r\nsecure them firmly with silk, before it made a single incision to\r\ndetach them. When it had in this manner joined the two edges along one\r\nof the sides, it inserted its head on the outside of the joining, first\r\nat one end and then at the other, gnawing the fibres till that whole\r\nside was separated. It proceeded in the same manner with the other\r\nside, joining the edges before it cut them: and when it arrived at the\r\nlast fibre, the only remaining support of its now finished tent, it\r\ntook the precaution, before snipping it, to moor the whole to the uncut\r\npart of the leaf by a cable of its own silk. Consequently, when it does\r\ncut the last nervure, it is secure from falling, and can then travel\r\nalong the leaf, carrying its tent on its back, as a snail does its\r\nshell. (J. R.)\r\n\r\nWe have just discovered (Nov. 4th, 1829) upon the nettle a tent of a\r\nvery singular appearance, in consequence of the materials of which it\r\nis made. The caterpillar seems, indeed, to have proceeded exactly in\r\nthe same manner as those which we have described, mining first between\r\nthe two membranes of the leaf, and then uniting these and cutting\r\nout his tent. But the tent itself looks singular from being all over\r\nstudded with the stinging bristles of the nettle, and forming a no less\r\nformidable coat of mail to the little inhabitant than the spiny hide\r\nof the hedgehog. In feeding it does not seem to have mined into the\r\nleaf, but to have eaten the whole of the lower membrane, along with the\r\nentire pulp, leaving nothing but the upper membrane untouched. (J. R.)\r\nDuring the summer of 1830 we discovered a very large tent which had\r\nbeen formed out of a blade of grass; and another stuck all over with\r\nchips of leaves upon the common maple.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _a_, The Caterpillar occupying the space it has eaten\r\nbetween the cuticles of the leaf; _b_, a portion of the upper cuticle,\r\ncut out for the formation of the tent; _c_, the tent nearly completed;\r\n_d_, the perfect tent, with the caterpillar protruding its head.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTents of Stone-Mason Caterpillars.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar of a small moth (_Tinea_) which feeds upon the lichens\r\ngrowing on walls, builds for itself a moveable tent of a very singular\r\nkind. M. de la Voye was the first who described these insects; but\r\nthough they are frequently overlooked, from being very small, they are\r\nby no means uncommon on old walls. Réaumur observed them regularly\r\nfor twenty years together on the terrace-wall of the Tuileries at\r\nParis; and they may be found in abundance in similar situations in this\r\ncountry. This accurate observer refuted by experiment the notion of M.\r\nde la Voye that the caterpillars fed upon the stones of the wall; but\r\nhe satisfied himself that they detached particles of the stone for the\r\npurpose of building their tents or sheaths (_fourreaux_), as he calls\r\ntheir dwellings. In order to watch their mode of building, Réaumur\r\ngently ejected half-a-dozen of them from their homes, and observed\r\nthem detach grain after grain from a piece of stone, binding each\r\ninto the wall of their building with silk till the cell acquired the\r\nrequisite magnitude, the whole operation taking about twenty-four hours\r\nof continued labour. M. de la Voye mentions small granular bodies of a\r\ngreenish colour, placed irregularly on the exterior of the structure,\r\nwhich he calls eggs; but we agree with Réaumur in thinking it more\r\nprobable that they are small fragments of moss or lichen intermixed\r\nwith the stone: in fact, we have ascertained that they are so. (J. R.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lichen-Tents and Caterpillars, both of their natural\r\nsize and magnified.]\r\n\r\nWhen these little architects prepare for their change into chrysalides\r\nbefore becoming moths, they attach their tents securely to the stone\r\nover which they have hitherto rambled, by spinning a strong mooring\r\nof silk, so as not only to fill up every interstice between the main\r\nentrance of the tent and the stone, but also weaving a close, thick\r\ncurtain of the same material, to shut up the entire aperture.\r\n\r\nIt is usual for insects which form similar structures to issue, when\r\nthey assume the winged state, from the broader end of their habitation;\r\nbut our little stone-mason proceeds in a different manner. It leaves\r\nopen the apex of the cone from the first, for the purpose of ejecting\r\nits excrements, and latterly it enlarges this opening a little, to\r\nallow of a free exit when it acquires wings; taking care, however, to\r\nspin over it a canopy of silk, as a temporary protection, which it can\r\nafterwards burst through without difficulty. The moth itself is very\r\nmuch like the common clothes-moth in form, but is of a gilded-bronze\r\ncolour, and considerably smaller.\r\n\r\nIn the same locality, M. de Maupertuis found a numerous brood of small\r\ncaterpillars, which employed grains of stone, not, like the preceding,\r\nfor building feeding-tents, but for their cocoons. This caterpillar\r\nwas of a brownish-grey colour, with a white line along the back, on\r\neach side of which were tufts of hair. The cocoons which it built were\r\noval, and less in size than a hazel-nut, the grains of the stone being\r\nskilfully woven into irregular meshes of silk.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1829, we found a numerous encampment of the tent-building\r\ncaterpillars described by MM. de la Voye and Réaumur, on the brick\r\nwall of a garden at Blackheath, Kent. (J. R.) They were so very\r\nsmall, however, and so like the lichen on the wall, that had not our\r\nattention been previously directed to their habits, we should have\r\nconsidered them as portions of the wall; for not one of them was in\r\nmotion, and it was only by the neat, turbinated, conical form in which\r\nthey had constructed their habitations that we detected them. We tried\r\nthe experiment above mentioned, of ejecting one of the caterpillars\r\nfrom its tent, in order to watch its proceedings when constructing\r\nanother; but probably its haste to procure shelter, or the artificial\r\ncircumstances into which it was thrown, influenced its operations, for\r\nit did not form so good a tent as the first, the texture of the walls\r\nbeing much slighter, while it was more rounded at the apex, and of\r\ncourse not so elegant. Réaumur found, in all his similar experiments,\r\nthat the new structure equalled the old; but most of the trials of this\r\nkind which we have made correspond with the inferiority which we have\r\nhere recorded. The process indeed is the same, but it seems to be done\r\nwith more hurry and less care. It may be, indeed, in some cases, that\r\nthe supply of silk necessary to unite the bits of stone, earth, or\r\nlichen employed, is too scanty for perfecting a second structure.\r\n\r\nWe remarked a very singular circumstance in the operations of our\r\nlittle architect, which seems to have escaped the minute and accurate\r\nattention of Réaumur. When it commenced its structure, it was\r\nindispensable to lay a foundation for the walls about to be reared;\r\nbut as the tent was to be moveable like the shell of a snail, and not\r\nstationary, it would not have answered its end to cement the foundation\r\nto the wall. We had foreseen this difficulty, and felt not a little\r\ninterested in discovering how it would be got over. Accordingly, upon\r\nwatching its movements with some attention, we were soon gratified\r\nto perceive that it used its own body as the primary support of the\r\nbuilding. It fixed a thread of silk upon one of its right feet, warped\r\nit over to the corresponding left foot, and upon the thread thus\r\nstretched between the two feet it glued grains of stone and chips of\r\nlichen, till the wall was of the required thickness. Upon this, as a\r\nfoundation, it continued to work till it had formed a small portion in\r\nform of a parallelogram; and proceeding in a similar way, it was not\r\nlong in making a ring a very little wider than sufficient to admit its\r\nbody. It extended this ring in breadth, by working on the inside only,\r\nnarrowing the diameter by degrees, till it began to take the form of a\r\ncone. The apex of this cone was not closed up, but left as an aperture\r\nthrough which to eject its excrements.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, that one of the caterpillars which we deprived\r\nof its tent attempted to save itself the trouble of building a new\r\none, by endeavouring to unhouse one of its neighbours. For this\r\npurpose, it got upon the outside of the inhabited tent, and, sliding\r\nits head down to the entrance, tried to make its way into the interior.\r\nBut the rightful owner did not choose to give up his premises so\r\neasily, and fixed his tent down so firmly upon the table where we had\r\nplaced it, that the intruder was forced to abandon his attempt. The\r\ninstant, however, that the other unmoored his tent and began to move\r\nabout, the invader renewed his efforts to eject him, persevering in\r\nthe struggle for several hours, but without a chance of success. At\r\none time we imagined that he would have accomplished his felonious\r\nintentions; for he bound down the apex of the tent to the table with\r\ncables of silk. But he attempted his entrance at the wrong end. He\r\nought to have tried the aperture in the apex, by enlarging which a\r\nlittle he would undoubtedly have made good his entrance; and as the\r\ninhabitant could not have turned upon him for want of room, the castle\r\nmust have been surrendered. This experiment, however, was not tried,\r\nand there was no hope for him at the main entrance.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuff-shaped Tents.\r\n\r\nThe ingenuity of man has pressed into his service not only the wool,\r\nthe hair, and even the skins of animals, but has most extensively\r\nsearched the vegetable kingdom for the materials of his clothing.\r\nIn all this, however, he is rivalled by the tiny inhabitants of the\r\ninsect world, as we have already seen; and we are about now to give\r\nan additional instance of the art of a species of caterpillars which\r\nselect a warmer material for their tents than even the caterpillar\r\nof the clothes-moth. It may have been remarked by many who are not\r\nbotanists, that the seed-catkins of the willow become, as they ripen,\r\ncovered with a species of down or cotton, which, however, is too short\r\nin the fibre to be advantageously employed in our manufactures. But the\r\ncaterpillars, to which we have alluded, find it well adapted for their\r\nhabitations.\r\n\r\nThe muff-looking tent in which we find these insects does not require\r\nmuch trouble to construct; for the caterpillar does not, like the\r\nclothes-moth caterpillar, join the willow-cotton together, fibre by\r\nfibre--it is contented with the state in which it finds it on the seed.\r\nInto this it burrows, lines the interior with a tapestry of silk, and\r\nthen detaches the whole from the branch where it was growing, and\r\ncarries it about with it as a protection while it is feeding.[BX]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _a_, Branch of the Willow, with seed-spikes covered with\r\ncotton; _b_, Muff-tents, made of this cotton by _c_, the Caterpillar.]\r\n\r\nAn inquiring friend of Réaumur having found one of these insects\r\nfloating about in its muff-tent upon water, concluded that they feed\r\nupon aquatic plants; but he was soon convinced that it had only been\r\nblown down by an accident, which must frequently happen, as willows so\r\noften hang over water. May it not be, that the buoyant materials of the\r\ntent were intended to furnish the little inhabitant with a life-boat,\r\nin which, when it chanced to be blown into the water, it might sail\r\nsafely ashore and regain its native tree?\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaf-mining Caterpillars.\r\n\r\nThe process of mining between the two membranes of a leaf is carried on\r\nto a farther extent by minute caterpillars allied to the tent-makers\r\nabove described. The tent-maker never deserts his house, except when\r\ncompelled, and therefore can only mine to about half the length of his\r\nown body; but the miners now to be considered make the mine itself\r\ntheir dwelling-place, and as they eat their way, they lengthen and\r\nenlarge their galleries. A few of these mining caterpillars are the\r\nprogeny of small weevils (_Curculionidæ_), some of two-winged flies\r\n(_Diptera_), but the greater number are produced from a genus of minute\r\nmoth (_Oecophora_, Latr.), which, when magnified, appear to be amongst\r\nthe most splendid and brilliant of Nature's productions, vying even\r\nwith the humming-birds and diamond-beetles of the tropics in the rich\r\nmetallic colours which bespangle their wings. Well may Bonnet call them\r\n\"tiny miracles of Nature,\" and regret that they are not _en grand_.[BY]\r\n\r\nThere are few plants or trees whose leaves may not, at some season of\r\nthe year, be found mined by these caterpillars, the track of whose\r\nprogress appears on the upper surface in winding lines. Let us take one\r\nof the most common of these for an example,--that of the rose-leaf,\r\nproduced by the caterpillar of Ray's golden-silver spot (_Argyromiges\r\nRayella_? Curtis), of which we have just gathered above a dozen\r\nspecimens from one rose-tree. (J. R.)\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked that the winding line is black, closely resembling\r\nthe tortuous course of a river on a map,--beginning like a small brook,\r\nand gradually increasing in breadth as it proceeds. This representation\r\nof a river exhibits, besides, a narrow white valley on each side of\r\nit, increasing as it goes, till it terminates in a broad delta. The\r\nvalley is the portion of the inner leaf from which the caterpillar has\r\neaten the pulp (_parenchyma_), while the river itself has been formed\r\nby the liquid _ejectamenta_ of the insect, the watery part becoming\r\nevaporated. In other species of miners, however, the dung is hard and\r\ndry, and consequently these only exhibit the valley without the river\r\n(see p. 255).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Leaf of the Monthly Rose (_Rose Indica_), mined by\r\nCaterpillars of Argyromiges?]\r\n\r\nOn looking at the back of the leaf, where the winding line begins,\r\nwe uniformly find the shell of the very minute egg from which the\r\ncaterpillar has been hatched, and hence perceive that it digs into\r\nthe leaf the moment it escapes from the egg, without wandering a\r\nhair's-breadth from the spot; as if afraid lest the air should visit it\r\ntoo roughly. The egg is, for the most part, placed upon the mid-rib of\r\nthe rose-leaf, but sometimes on one of the larger nervures. When once\r\nit has got within the leaf, it seems to pursue no certain direction,\r\nsometimes working to the centre, sometimes to the circumference,\r\nsometimes to the point, and sometimes to the base, and even,\r\noccasionally, crossing or keeping parallel to its own previous track.\r\n\r\nThe most marvellous circumstance, however, is the minuteness of its\r\nworkmanship; for though a rose-leaf is thinner than this paper, the\r\ninsect finds room to mine a tunnel to live in, and plenty of food,\r\nwithout touching the two external membranes. Let any one try with\r\nthe nicest dissecting instruments to separate the two plates of a\r\nrose-leaf, and he will find it impossible to proceed far without\r\ntearing one or other. The caterpillar goes still further in minute\r\nnicety; for it may be remarked, that its track can only be seen on the\r\nupper, and not on the under surface of the leaf, proving that it eats\r\nas it proceeds only half the thickness of the pulp, or that portion of\r\nit which belongs to the upper membrane of the leaf.\r\n\r\nWe have found this little miner on almost every sort of rose-tree, both\r\nwild and cultivated, including the sweet-briar, in which, the leaf\r\nbeing very small, it requires nearly the whole parenchyma to feed one\r\ncaterpillar. They seem, however, to prefer the foreign monthly rose to\r\nany of our native species, and there are few trees of this where they\r\nmay not be discovered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Leaf of the Dew-berry Bramble (_Rubus cæsius_), mined by\r\nCaterpillars.]\r\n\r\nTunnels very analogous to the preceding may be found upon the common\r\nbramble (_Rubus fruticosus_); and on the holly, early in spring, one\r\nwhich is in form of an irregular whitish blotch. But in the former\r\ncase, the little miner seems to proceed more regularly, always, when\r\nnewly hatched, making directly for the circumference, upon or near\r\nwhich also the mother-moth deposits her egg, and winding along for half\r\nthe extent of the leaf close upon the edge, following, in some cases,\r\nthe very indentations formed by the terminating nervures.\r\n\r\nThe bramble-leaf miner seems also to differ from that of the rose-leaf,\r\nby eating the pulp both from the upper and under surface, at least the\r\ntrack is equally distinct above and below; yet this may arise from the\r\ndifferent consistence of the leaf pulp, that in the rose being firm,\r\nwhile that of the bramble is soft and puffy.\r\n\r\nOn the leaves of the common primrose (_Primula veris_), as well as\r\non the garden variety of it, the polyanthus, one of those mining\r\ncaterpillars may very frequently be found. It is, however, considerably\r\ndifferent from the preceding, for there is no black trace--no river to\r\nthe valley which it excavates: its ejectamenta, being small and solid,\r\nare seen, when the leaf is dried, in little black points like grains\r\nof sand. This miner also seems more partial than the preceding to the\r\nmid-rib and its vicinity, in consequence of which its path is seldom\r\nso tortuous, and often appears at its extremity to terminate in an\r\narea comparatively extensive, arising from its recrossing its previous\r\ntracks. (J. R.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Leaf of the Primrose (_Primula veris_), mined by a\r\nCaterpillar.]\r\n\r\nSwammerdam describes a mining caterpillar which he found on the leaves\r\nof the alder, though it did not, like those we have just described,\r\nexcavate a winding gallery; it kept upon the same spot, and formed\r\nonly an irregular area. A moth was produced from this, whose upper\r\nwings, he says, \"shone and glittered most gloriously with crescents\r\nof gold, silver, and brown, surrounded by borders of delicate black.\"\r\nAnother area miner which he found on the leaves of willows, as many as\r\nseventeen on one leaf, producing what appeared to be rusty spots, was\r\nmetamorphosed into a very minute weevil (_Curculio Rhionoc._). He says\r\nhe has been informed that, in warm climates, worms an inch long are\r\nfound in leaves, and adds, with great simplicity, \"on these many fine\r\nexperiments might have been made, if the inhabitants had not laboured\r\nunder the cursed thirst of gold.\"[BZ]\r\n\r\nThe vine-leaf miner, when about to construct its cocoon, cuts, from\r\nthe termination of its gallery, two pieces of the membrane of the\r\nleaf, deprived of their pulp, in a similar manner to the tent-makers\r\ndescribed above, uniting them and lining them with silk. This she\r\ncarries to some distance before she lays herself up to undergo her\r\nchange. Her mode of walking under her burthen is peculiar, for,\r\nnot contented with the security of a single thread of silk, she\r\nforms, as Bonnet says, \"little mountains (_monticules_) of silk,\r\nfrom distance to distance, and seizing one of these with her teeth,\r\ndrags herself forward, and makes it a scaffolding from which she\r\ncan build another.\"[CA] Some of the miners, however, do not leave\r\ntheir galleries, but undergo their transformations there, taking the\r\nprecaution to mine a cell, not in the upper, but in the under surface;\r\nothers only shift to another portion of the leaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSocial Leaf-Miners.\r\n\r\nThe preceding descriptions apply to caterpillars who construct their\r\nmines in solitude, there being seldom more than one on a leaf or\r\nleaflet, unless when two mother-flies happen to lay their eggs on the\r\nsame leaf; but there are others, such as the miners of the leaves of\r\nthe henbane (_Hyoscyamus niger_), which excavate a common area in\r\nconcert--from four to eight forming a colony. These are very like\r\nflesh-maggots, being larger than the common miners; the leaves of this\r\nplant, from being thick and juicy, giving them space to work and plenty\r\nto eat.\r\n\r\nMost of the solitary leaf-miners either cannot or will not construct\r\na new mine, if ejected by an experimenter from the old, as we have\r\nfrequently proved; but this is not the case with the social miners of\r\nthe henbane-leaf. Bonnet ejected one of these, and watched it with his\r\nglass till it commenced a new tunnel, which it also enlarged with great\r\nexpedition; and in order to verify the assertion of Réaumur, that they\r\nneither endeavour nor fear to meet one another, he introduced a second.\r\nNeither of them manifested any knowledge of the other's contiguity,\r\nbut both worked hard at the gallery, as did a third and a fourth which\r\nhe afterwards introduced; for though they seemed uneasy, they never\r\nattacked one another, as the solitary ones often do when they meet.[CB]\r\n\r\n\r\nBark-mining Caterpillars.\r\n\r\nA very different order of mining caterpillars are the progeny of\r\nvarious beetles, which excavate their galleries in the soft inner bark\r\nof trees, or between it and the young wood (_alburnum_). Some of these,\r\nthough small, commit extensive ravages, as may readily be conceived\r\nwhen we are told that as many as eighty thousand are occasionally found\r\non one tree. In 1783 the trees thus destroyed by the printer-beetle\r\n(_Tomicus typographus_, Latr.), so called from its tracks resembling\r\nletters, amounted to above a million and a half in the Hartz forest. It\r\nappears there periodically, and confines its ravages to the fir. This\r\ninsect is said to have been found in the neighbourhood of London.\r\n\r\nOn taking off the bark of decaying poplars and willows, we have\r\nfrequently met with the tracks of a miner of this order, extending\r\nin tortuous pathways, about a quarter of an inch broad, for several\r\nfeet and even yards in length. The excavation is not circular, but a\r\ncompressed oval, and crammed throughout with a dark-coloured substance\r\nlike sawdust--the excrement no doubt of the little miner, who is\r\nthereby protected from the attacks of _Staphylinidæ_, and other\r\npredaceous insects from behind. But though we have found a great\r\nnumber of these subcortical tracks, we have never discovered one of\r\nthe miners, though they are very probably the grubs of the pretty\r\nmusk-beetle (_Cerambyx moschatus_), which are so abundant in the\r\nneighbourhood of the trees in question, that the very air in summer is\r\nperfumed with their odour. (J. R.)\r\n\r\n[Mr. Rennie is undoubtedly right in his suggestion. I have found\r\nsimilar holes in old willow trees, and have traced them throughout\r\ntheir varied ramifications. They contain the larvæ and pupæ of the\r\nmusk-beetle, some of which may be seen in the Museum at Oxford. On\r\nthese trees, which mostly grow along the banks of the Cherwell, the\r\nperfect beetle was so abundant that it might be taken in any number,\r\nand, as described by Mr. Rennie, the air was perfumed with its powerful\r\nand agreeable odour. So strong is the scent of this beetle, that I have\r\nknown it adhere to gloves after the lapse of many weeks, and I have\r\noften caught the scent when passing along the road, and merely by the\r\naid of the nostrils discovered the insect.\r\n\r\nOn account of the vast number of carpenter-beetles, it is impossible to\r\nnotice more than a few of them, and we will therefore select some of\r\nthe most conspicuous. One of them, belonging to the genus _Ptilinus_,\r\nis very familiar to us as boring into wooden furniture, and producing\r\nthe effect which is popularly called \"worm-eaten.\" Fortunately, the\r\nlittle creatures can be easily ejected, and the wood rendered free of\r\nthem ever afterwards. All that is needed is to take a syringe with a\r\nvery fine aperture--an injecting syringe is the best--and by its aid\r\nto force into the holes a solution of corrosive sublimate in spirits\r\nof wine--say a large teaspoonful of the powdered salt to a pint of\r\nspirits. The rapidity with which the poisoned spirit permeates the wood\r\nis wonderful, and in a short time it may be seen oozing out of twenty\r\nor thirty holes at once. This solution is peculiarly effective, as it\r\nkills all the insects, destroys every egg that it touches, and renders\r\nthe wood poisonous to the grubs that happen to escape. I used to be\r\ngreatly plagued with the Ptilinus among my ethnological collection,\r\nuntil I tried the corrosive sublimate, and ever since my spears, bows\r\nand arrows, and clubs have remained intact.\r\n\r\nAnother troublesome insect is the _Scolytus destructor_, which makes\r\nits radiating tunnels between the bark and the tree. Whole forests have\r\nbeen destroyed by this voracious little beetle, the bark having been\r\ncompletely detached, and the tree necessarily killed. The habits of\r\nthis beetle are well described in the following passage.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bark mined in rays by beetle-grubs.]\r\n\r\nWe have frequently observed a very remarkable instinct in the grubs\r\nof a species of beetle (_Scolytus destructor_, Geoffroy), which lives\r\nunder the dead bark of trees. The mother insect, as is usual with\r\nbeetles, deposits her eggs in a patch or cluster in a chink or hole in\r\nthe bark; and when the brood is hatched, they begin feeding on the bark\r\nwhich had formed their cradle. There is, of course, nothing wonderful\r\nin their eating the food selected by their mother; but it appears that,\r\nlike the caterpillars of the clothes-moth, and the tent insects, they\r\ncannot feed except under cover. They dig, therefore, long tubular\r\ngalleries between the bark and the wood; and, in order not to interfere\r\nwith the _runs_ of their brethren, they branch off from the place of\r\nhatching like rays from the centre of a circle: though these are not\r\nalways in a right line, yet, however near they may approach to the\r\ncontiguous ones, none of them ever break into each other's premises.\r\nWe cannot but admire the remarkable instinct implanted in these grubs\r\nby their Creator; which guides them thus in lines diverging farther\r\nand farther as they increase in size, so that they are prevented from\r\ninterfering with the comforts of one another.\r\n\r\n[We now come to one or two of the beetles which bore deeply into the\r\nvery wood of the trees. As a rule, the musk-beetle keeps rather towards\r\nthe exterior of the tree, but there are many that are not so cautious,\r\nand which besides damage the tree additionally by nibbling a quantity\r\nof chips, wherewith they strengthen their cocoons. We will first take\r\nthe two insects which are shown in the accompanying illustration.\r\nThat on the right hand is a species of weevil, or Curculio, and is\r\nan undescribed species belonging to the genus Rhyncophorus. It is a\r\nnative of Australia. The insect and its cocoon are drawn one third less\r\nthan their real size. The colour of the beetle is warm chestnut brown,\r\nand the bold marks on the thorax are jet black. In its larval state\r\nit burrows into the palm-trees, and when about to assume the pupal\r\ncondition it makes the remarkable cocoon which is figured. Generally,\r\nthese wooden cocoons are made of little chips which are bitten from the\r\nwood, and woven together with silk. This cocoon, however, is made of\r\nlong fibres, which are torn rather than bitten, and are so long that\r\none of them will sometimes encircle the cell three times, making an\r\naverage length of nine inches. It is tolerably compact in structure,\r\nand the colour is pale brown.\r\n\r\nOn the left hand is an opened cocoon of an English beetle belonging to\r\nthe genus Rhagium. Like the last-mentioned insect, the Rhagium prefers\r\nlong fibres to short chips, though it does not use them of such a\r\nlength as the Rhyncophorus. The cocoon is generally made between the\r\nbark and the wood, from the latter of which the fibres are torn. In\r\nconsequence of the mode of structure, the cocoon is pale straw colour,\r\nwhile the hollow in which it rests is quite dark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cocoon of Rhagium.\r\n\r\nRhyncophorus and cocoon.]\r\n\r\nAll entomologists are familiar with the pretty little wasp-beetle\r\n(_Clytus arietis_), which derives its popular name from the\r\nwasp-like colours of its body. In the larval state it is one of the\r\ncarpenter-grubs, and may be found in posts, fir-trees, and similar\r\nlocalities. In this country, although plentiful, it is not numerous\r\nenough to do much harm; but in Ceylon, a closely-allied species is\r\none of the pests of the island. It is popularly known by the title\r\nof coffee-borer, from its habit of boring into the stems of the\r\ncoffee-plant. The landowner looks with absolute horror on this pretty\r\nbut destructive insect, and would pay a heavy sum annually to any one\r\nwho would undertake to extirpate the tiny foe. Whole plantations have\r\nbeen swept off by it, and up to the present time no remedy has had\r\nmore than a temporary and partial success.]\r\n\r\nAnother capricorn beetle of this family is no less destructive to bark\r\nin its perfect state than the above are when grubs, as from its habit\r\nof eating round a tree, it cuts the course of the returning sap, and\r\ndestroys it.\r\n\r\n[The late Mr. Waterton once showed me a stout branch which had fallen\r\non his head while he was standing under a tree, the branch having been\r\ncut completely through by the jaws of some large longicorn beetle. The\r\nmode in which the insect had severed the branch was exactly like that\r\nwhich is practised by the beaver when it cuts down a tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Capricorn Beetle (_Cerambyx Lamia amputator_) rounding\r\noff the bark of a tree.]\r\n\r\nThe burrows and cocoons of two other species of Cerambyx are shown\r\nin the accompanying illustration, and in both cases may be seen the\r\nprovision which is made for the exit of the beetle after it has\r\nattained the perfect condition. The double burrow of the left is that\r\nof _Cerambyx carcharias_, and those on the right-hand figure are the\r\nhabitations of _Cerambyx populneus_. The reader will see how these\r\ninsects cut up the wood of the branch, and can well understand the\r\ninfinite mischief which can be done to a coffee plantation by the\r\nClytus.\r\n\r\nThe last wood-boring beetle which will be mentioned is the stag-beetle\r\nof our own country. In the larval state this insect resides in tree\r\ntrunks, mostly towards the roots, and therefore escapes observation\r\nmore successfully than would be the case if it inhabited a higher\r\nportion of the tree. When full-grown, the larva is of enormous\r\nsize, and the hole which it bores is necessarily of corresponding\r\ndimensions. In some parts of England, the larvæ are popularly called\r\n\"Joe Bassetts,\" and are said to turn into \"Pincher Bobs.\" The latter\r\ntitle is a very appropriate one, as any one can testify who has allowed\r\na fine male stag-beetle to grip his finger between its jaws. As to the\r\nJoe Bassett, it is simply a local name.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cerambyx carcharias._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cerambyx populneus._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XIII._\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURES OF GRASSHOPPERS, CRICKETS, AND BEETLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrasshoppers, locusts, crickets, and beetles are, in many respects, no\r\nless interesting than the insects whose architectural proceedings we\r\nhave already detailed. They do not, indeed, build any edifice for the\r\naccommodation of themselves or their progeny; but most, if not all of\r\nthem, excavate retreats in walls or in the ground.\r\n\r\nThe house-cricket (_Acheta domestica_) is well known for its habit\r\nof picking out the mortar of ovens and kitchen fire-places, where\r\nit not only enjoys warmth, but can procure abundance of food. It is\r\nusually supposed that it feeds on bread. M. Latreille says it only\r\neats insects, and it certainly thrives well in houses infested by\r\nthe cockroach; but we have also known it eat and destroy lamb's-wool\r\nstockings, and other woolen stuffs, hung near a fire to dry. It is\r\nevidently not fond of hard labour, but prefers those places where\r\nthe mortar is already loosened, or at least is new, soft, and easily\r\nscooped out; and in this way it will dig covert ways from room to\r\nroom. In summer, crickets often make excursions from the house to the\r\nneighbouring fields, and dwell in the crevices of rubbish, or the\r\ncracks made in the ground by dry weather, where they chirp as merrily\r\nas in the snuggest chimney-corner. Whether they ever dig retreats in\r\nsuch circumstances we have not ascertained: though it is not improbable\r\nthey may do so for the purpose of making nests. M. Bory St. Vincent\r\ntells us that the Spaniards are so fond of crickets that they keep them\r\nin cages like singing birds.[CC]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mole-Cricket.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Mole-Cricket, with a separate outline of one of its\r\nhands.]\r\n\r\nThe insect, called, from its similarity of habits to the mole, the\r\nmole-cricket (_Gryllotalpa vulgaris_, Latr.), is but too well known\r\nin gardens, corn-fields, and the moist banks of rivers and ponds, in\r\nsome parts of England, such as Wiltshire and Hampshire, though it is\r\ncomparatively rare or unknown in others. It burrows in the ground,\r\nand forms extensive galleries similar to those of the mole, though\r\nsmaller; and these may always be recognized by a slightly elevated\r\nridge of mould: for the insect does not throw up the earth in hillocks\r\nlike the mole, but gradually, as it digs along, in the manner of the\r\nfield-mouse. In this way it commits great ravages, in hotbeds and in\r\ngardens, upon peas, young cabbages, and other vegetables, the roots\r\nof which it is said to devour. It is not improbable, we think, that,\r\nlike its congener, the house-cricket, it may also prey upon underground\r\ninsects, and undermine the plants to get at them, as the mole has been\r\nproved to do. Mr Gould, indeed, fed a mole-cricket for several months\r\nupon ants.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the mole-cricket's arms and hands (if we may call\r\nthem so) is admirably adapted for these operations, being both very\r\nstrong, and moved by a peculiar apparatus of muscles. The breast is\r\nformed of a thick, hard, horny substance, which is further strengthened\r\nwithin by a double framework of strong gristle, in front of the\r\nextremities of which the shoulder-blades of the arms are firmly\r\njointed: a structure evidently intended to prevent the breast from\r\nbeing injured by the powerful action of the muscles of the arms in\r\ndigging. The arms themselves are strong and broad, and the hand is\r\nfurnished with four large sharp claws, pointed somewhat obliquely\r\noutwards, this being the direction in which it digs, throwing the earth\r\non each side of its course. So strongly indeed does it throw out its\r\narms, that we find it can thus easily support its own weight when held\r\nbetween the finger and thumb, as we have tried upon half-a-dozen of the\r\nliving insects now in our possession.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nest of the Mole-Cricket.]\r\n\r\nThe nest which the female constructs for her eggs, in the beginning\r\nof May, is well worthy of attention. The Rev. Mr. White, of Selborne,\r\ntells us that a gardener, at a house where he was on a visit, while\r\nmowing grass by the side of a canal, chanced to strike his scythe too\r\ndeep, and pared off a large piece of turf, laying open to view an\r\ninteresting scene of domestic economy. There was a pretty chamber dug\r\nin the clay, of the form and about the dimensions it would have had if\r\nmoulded by an egg, the walls being neatly smoothed and polished. In\r\nthis little cell were deposited about a hundred eggs, of the size and\r\nform of caraway comfits, and of a dull tarnished white colour. The eggs\r\nwere not very deep, but just under a little heap of fresh mould, and\r\nwithin the influence of the sun's heat.[CD] The dull tarnished white\r\ncolour, however, scarcely agrees with a parcel of these eggs now before\r\nus, which are translucent, gelatinous, and greenish.\r\n\r\nLike the eggs and young of other insects, however, those of the\r\nmole-cricket are exposed to depredation, and particularly to the\r\nravages of a black beetle which burrows in similar localities. The\r\nmother insect, accordingly, does not think her nest secure till she has\r\ndefended it, like a fortified town, with labyrinths, intrenchments,\r\nramparts, and covert ways. In some part of these out-works she stations\r\nherself as an advanced guard, and when the beetle ventures within her\r\ncircumvallations, she pounces upon him and kills him.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Field-Cricket.\r\n\r\nAnother insect of this family, the field-cricket (_Acheta campestris_),\r\nalso forms burrows in the ground, in which it lodges all day, and comes\r\nout chiefly about sunset to pipe its evening song. It is so very shy\r\nand cautious, however, that it is by no means easy to discover either\r\nthe insect or its burrow. \"The children in France amuse themselves with\r\nhunting after the field-cricket; they put into its hole an ant fastened\r\nby a long hair, and as they draw it out the cricket does not fail to\r\npursue it, and issue from its retreat. Pliny informs us it might be\r\ncaptured in a much more expeditious and easy manner. If, for instance,\r\na small and slender piece of stick were to be thrust into the burrow,\r\nthe insect, he says, would immediately get upon it for the purpose of\r\ndemanding the occasion of the intrusion: whence arose the proverb,\r\n_stultior grillo_ (more foolish than a cricket), applied to one who,\r\nupon light grounds, provokes his enemy, and falls into the snares which\r\nmight have been laid to entrap him.\"[CE]\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. White, who attentively studied their habits and manners,\r\nat first made an attempt to dig them out with a spade, but without any\r\ngreat success; for either the bottom of the hole was inaccessible, from\r\nits terminating under a large stone, or else in breaking up the ground\r\nthe poor creature was inadvertently squeezed to death. Out of one thus\r\nbruised a great number of eggs were taken, which were long and narrow,\r\nof a yellow colour, and covered with a very tough skin. More gentle\r\nmeans were then used, and these proved successful. A pliant stalk of\r\ngrass, gently insinuated into the caverns, will probe their windings to\r\nthe bottom, and bring out the inhabitant; and thus the humane inquirer\r\nmay gratify his curiosity without injuring the object of it.\r\n\r\nWhen the males meet, they sometimes fight very fiercely, as Mr. White\r\nfound by some that he put into the crevices of a dry stone wall, where\r\nhe wished to have them settle. For though they seemed distressed by\r\nbeing taken out of their knowledge, yet the first that got possession\r\nof the chinks seized on all the others that were obtruded upon him with\r\nhis large row of serrated fangs. With their strong jaws, toothed like\r\nthe shears of a lobster's claws, they perforate and round their curious\r\nregular cells, having no fore-claws to dig with, like the mole-cricket.\r\nWhen taken into the hand, they never attempt to defend themselves,\r\nthough armed with such formidable weapons. Of such herbs as grow about\r\nthe mouths of their burrows they eat indiscriminately, and never in the\r\nday-time seem to stir more than two or three inches from home. Sitting\r\nin the entrance of their caverns, they chirp all night as well as day,\r\nfrom the middle of the month of May to the middle of July. In hot\r\nweather, when they are most vigorous, they make the hills echo; and, in\r\nthe more still hours of darkness, may be heard to a very considerable\r\ndistance. \"Not many summers ago,\" says Mr. White, \"I endeavoured to\r\ntransplant a colony of these insects to the terrace in my garden, by\r\nboring deep holes in the sloping turf. The new inhabitants stayed some\r\ntime, and fed and sang; but they wandered away by degrees, and were\r\nheard at a greater distance every morning; so it appears that on this\r\nemergency they made use of their wings in attempting to return to the\r\nspot from which they were taken.\"[CF] The manner in which these insects\r\nlay their eggs is represented in the following figure, which is that of\r\nan insect nearly allied to the crickets, though of a different genus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Acrida verrucivora_ depositing her eggs.\r\n\r\nThe usual position of the ovipositor is represented by dots.]\r\n\r\nA more laborious task is performed by an insect by no means uncommon\r\nin Britain, the burying beetle (_Necrophorus vespillo_), which may be\r\neasily recognized by its longish body, of a black colour, with two\r\nbroad and irregularly indented bands of yellowish brown. A foreign\r\nnaturalist, M. Gleditsch, gives a very interesting account of its\r\nindustry. He had \"often remarked that dead moles, when laid upon the\r\nground, especially if upon loose earth, were almost sure to disappear\r\nin the course of two or three days, often of twelve hours. To ascertain\r\nthe cause, he placed a mole upon one of the beds in his garden. It\r\nhad vanished by the third morning; and on digging where it had been\r\nlaid, he found it buried to the depth of three inches, and under it\r\nfour beetles, which seemed to have been the agents in this singular\r\ninhumation. Not perceiving anything particular in the mole, he buried\r\nit again; and on examining it at the end of six days, he found it\r\nswarming with maggots, apparently the issue of the beetles, which M.\r\nGleditsch now naturally concluded had buried the carcase for the food\r\nof their future young. To determine these points more clearly, he put\r\nfour of these insects into a glass vessel, half filled with earth and\r\nproperly secured, and upon the surface of the earth two frogs. In less\r\nthan twelve hours one of the frogs was interred by two of the beetles;\r\nthe other two ran about the whole day, as if busied in measuring the\r\ndimensions of the remaining corpse, which on the third day was also\r\nfound buried. He then introduced a dead linnet. A pair of the beetles\r\nwere soon engaged upon the bird. They began their operations by pushing\r\nout the earth from under the body, so as to form a cavity for its\r\nreception; and it was curious to see the efforts which the beetles\r\nmade, by dragging at the feathers of the bird from below, to pull it\r\ninto its grave. The male, having driven the female away, continued the\r\nwork alone for five hours. He lifted up the bird, changed its place,\r\nturned it, and arranged it in the grave, and from time to time came\r\nout of the hole, mounted upon it, and trod it under foot, and then\r\nretired below, and pulled it down. At length, apparently wearied with\r\nthis uninterrupted labour, it came forth, and leaned its head upon\r\nthe earth beside the bird, without the smallest motion, as if to rest\r\nitself, for a full hour, when it again crept under the earth. The next\r\nday, in the morning, the bird was an inch and a half under ground, and\r\nthe trench remained open the whole day, the corpse seeming as if laid\r\nout upon a bier, surrounded with a rampart of mould. In the evening it\r\nhad sunk half an inch lower, and in another day the work was completed,\r\nand the bird covered. M. Gleditsch continued to add other small dead\r\nanimals, which were all sooner or later buried; and the result of his\r\nexperiment was, that in fifty days four beetles had interred, in the\r\nvery small space of earth allotted to them, twelve carcases, viz., four\r\nfrogs, three small birds, two fishes, one mole, and two grasshoppers,\r\nbesides the entrails of a fish, and two morsels of the lungs of an ox.\r\nIn another experiment, a single beetle buried a mole, forty times its\r\nown bulk and weight, in two days.\"[CG]\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1826, we found on Putney Heath, in Surrey, four of\r\nthese beetles, hard at work in burying a dead crow, precisely in the\r\nmanner described by M. Gleditsch. (J. R.)\r\n\r\n\r\nDung-Beetle.\r\n\r\nA still more common British insect, the dorr, clock, or dung-beetle\r\n(_Geotrupes stercorarius_), uses different materials for burying along\r\nwith its eggs. \"It digs,\" to use the words of Kirby and Spence, \"a\r\ndeep cylindrical hole, and carrying down a mass of the dung to the\r\nbottom, in it deposits its eggs. And many of the species of the genus\r\n_Ateuchus_ roll together wet dung into round pellets, deposit an egg\r\nin the midst of each, and when dry push them backwards, by their hind\r\nfeet, to holes of the surprising depth of three feet, which they have\r\npreviously dug for their reception, and which are often several yards\r\ndistant. The attention of these insects to their eggs is so remarkable,\r\nthat it was observed in the earliest ages, and is mentioned by ancient\r\nwriters, but with the addition of many fables; as that they were all of\r\nthe male sex; that they became young again every year; and that they\r\nrolled the pellets containing their eggs from sunrise to sunset every\r\nday, for twenty-eight days, without intermission.\"[CH]\r\n\r\n\"We frequently notice in our evening walks,\" says Mr. Knapp, \"the\r\nmurmuring passage, and are often stricken by the heedless flight of the\r\ngreat dorr-beetle (_Geotrupes stercorarius_), clocks, as the boys call\r\nthem. But this evening my attention was called to them in particular,\r\nby the constant passing of such a number as to constitute something\r\nlike a little stream; and I was led to search into the object of their\r\ndirect flight, as in general it is irregular and seemingly inquisitive.\r\nI soon found that they dropped on some recent nuisance: but what powers\r\nof perception must these creatures possess, drawn from all distances\r\nand directions by the very little fetor which, in such a calm evening,\r\ncould be diffused around, and by what inconceivable means could odours\r\nreach, this beetle in such a manner as to rouse so inert an insect\r\ninto action! But it is appointed one of the great scavengers of the\r\nearth, and marvellously endowed with powers of sensation, and means of\r\neffecting this purpose of its being. Exquisitely fabricated as it is\r\nto receive impressions, yet probably it is not more highly gifted than\r\nany of the other innumerable creatures that wing their way around us,\r\nor creep about our paths, though by this one perceptible faculty, thus\r\n'dimly seen,' it excites our wonder and surprise. How wondrous then the\r\nwhole!\r\n\r\n\"The perfect cleanliness of these creatures is a very notable\r\ncircumstance, when we consider that nearly their whole lives are\r\npassed in burrowing in the earth, and removing nuisances; yet such is\r\nthe admirable polish of their coating and limbs, that we very seldom\r\nfind any soil adhering to them. The meloe, and some of the scarabæi,\r\nupon first emerging from their winter's retreat, are commonly found\r\nwith earth clinging to them; but the removal of this is one of the\r\nfirst operations of the creature; and all the beetle race, the chief\r\noccupation of which is crawling about the soil, and such dirty employs,\r\nare, notwithstanding, remarkable for the glossiness of their covering,\r\nand freedom from defilements of any kind. But purity of vesture\r\nseems to be a principal precept of Nature, and observable throughout\r\ncreation. Fishes, from the nature of the element in which they reside,\r\ncan contract but little impurity. Birds are unceasingly attentive to\r\nneatness and lustration of their plumage. All the slug race, though\r\ncovered with slimy matter calculated to collect extraneous things, and\r\nreptiles, are perfectly free from soil. The fur and hair of beasts, in\r\na state of liberty and health, is never filthy or sullied with dirt.\r\nSome birds roll themselves in dust, and, occasionally, particular\r\nbeasts cover themselves with mire; but this is not from any liking or\r\ninclination for such things, but to free themselves from annoyances, or\r\nto prevent the bites of insects. Whether birds in preening, and beasts\r\nin dressing themselves, be directed by any instinctive faculty, we know\r\nnot; but they evidently derive pleasure from the operation, and thus\r\nthis feeling of enjoyment, even if the sole motive, becomes to them an\r\nessential source of comfort and of health.\"[CI]\r\n\r\nThe rose or green chafer (_Cetonia aurata_), which is one of our\r\nprettiest native insects, is one of the burrowers, and, for the purpose\r\nof depositing her eggs, digs, about the middle of June, into soft light\r\nground. When she is seen at this operation, with her broad and delicate\r\nwings folded up in their shining green cases, speckled with white, it\r\ncould hardly be imagined that she had but just descended from the air,\r\nor dropped down from some neighbouring rose.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the Tumble-Dung Beetle of America (_Scarabæus\r\npilularius_, Linn.) are described in a very interesting manner by\r\nCatesby, in his 'Carolina.' \"I have,\" says he, \"attentively admired\r\ntheir industry, and mutual assisting of each other in rolling their\r\nglobular balls from the place where they made them to that of their\r\ninterment, which is usually the distance of some yards, more or less.\r\nThis they perform breech foremost, by raising their hind parts, and\r\nforcing along the ball with their hind feet. Two or three of them are\r\nsometimes engaged in trundling one ball, which, from meeting with\r\nimpediments on account of the unevenness of the ground, is sometimes\r\ndeserted by them. It is, however, attempted by others with success,\r\nunless it happens to roll into some deep hollow or chink, where they\r\nare constrained to leave it; but they continue their work by rolling\r\noff the next ball that comes in their way. None of them seem to know\r\ntheir own balls, but an equal care for the whole appears to affect all\r\nthe community. They form these pellets while the dung remains moist,\r\nand leave them to harden in the sun before they attempt to roll them.\r\nIn their moving of them from place to place, both they and the balls\r\nmay frequently be seen tumbling about the little eminences that are in\r\ntheir way. They are not, however, easily discouraged; and, by repeating\r\ntheir attempts, usually surmount the difficulties.\"\r\n\r\nHe further informs us that they \"find out their subsistence by the\r\nexcellency of their noses, which direct them in their flight to\r\nnewly-fallen dung, on which they immediately go to work, tempering it\r\nwith a proper mixture of earth. So intent are they always upon their\r\nemployment, that, though handled or otherwise interrupted, they are not\r\nto be deterred, but immediately, on being freed, persist in their work\r\nwithout any apprehension of danger. They are said to be so exceedingly\r\nstrong and active as to move about, with the greatest ease, things that\r\nare many times their own weight. Dr. Brichell was supping one evening\r\nin a planter's house of North Carolina, when two of them were conveyed,\r\nwithout his knowledge, under the candlesticks. A few blows were struck\r\non the table, and, to his great surprise, the candlesticks began to\r\nmove about, apparently without any agency; and his surprise was not\r\nmuch lessened when, on taking one of them up, he discovered that it was\r\nonly a chafer that moved it.\"\r\n\r\nWe have often found the necklace-beetle (_Carabus monilis_) inhabiting\r\na chamber dug out in the earth of a garden, just sufficient to contain\r\nits body, and carefully smoothed and polished. From the form of this\r\nlittle nest, it would seem as if it were constructed, not by digging\r\nout the earth and removing it, but chiefly by the insect pushing its\r\nbody forcibly against the walls. The beetles which we have found\r\nnestling in this manner have been all males; and therefore it cannot be\r\nintended for a breeding-cell; for male insects are never, we believe,\r\nsufficiently generous to their mates to assist them in such labours.\r\nThe beetle in question appears to be partial to celery trenches (J.\r\nR.); probably from the loose earth of which they are composed yielding,\r\nwithout much difficulty, to the pressure of its body.\r\n\r\n[Many of the subterranean larvæ which are turned up by the spade or the\r\nplough are the imperfect conditions of earth-burrowing beetles, and\r\nmany of them are among the most insidious pests of the farmer, their\r\nravages being all the more dangerous because they are unseen.]\r\n\r\nThe most destructive, perhaps, of the creatures usually called grubs\r\nare the larvæ of the may-bug or cockchafer (_Melolontha vulgaris_), but\r\ntoo well known, particularly in the southern and midland districts of\r\nEngland, as well as in Ireland, where the grub is called the Connaught\r\nworm;[CJ] but fortunately not abundant in the north. We only once met\r\nwith the cockchafer in Scotland, at Sorn, in Ayrshire. (J. R.) Even\r\nin the perfect state, this insect is not a little destructive to the\r\nleaves of both forest and fruit trees. In 1823, we remember to have\r\nobserved almost all the trees about Dulwich and Camberwell defoliated\r\nby them; and Salisbury says, the leaves of the oaks in Richmond Park\r\nwere so eaten by them, that scarcely an entire leaf was left. But it\r\nis in their previous larva state that they are most destructive, as we\r\nshall see by tracing their history.\r\n\r\nThe mother cockchafer, when about to lay her eggs, digs into the\r\nearth of a meadow or corn-field to the depth of a span, and deposits\r\nthem in a cluster at the bottom of the excavation. Rösel, in order to\r\nwatch the proceedings, put some females into glasses half-filled with\r\nearth, covered with a tuft of grass and a piece of thin muslin. In a\r\nfortnight, he found some hundreds of eggs deposited, of an oval shape\r\nand a pale-yellow colour. Placing the glass in a cellar, the eggs were\r\nhatched towards autumn, and the grubs increased remarkably in size. In\r\nthe following May they fed so voraciously that they required a fresh\r\nturf every second day; and even this proving too scanty provender, he\r\nsowed in several garden pots a crop of peas, lentils, and salad, and\r\nwhen the plants came up he put a pair of grubs in each pot; and in\r\nthis manner he fed them through the second and third years. During\r\nthis period, they cast their skins three or four times, going for this\r\npurpose deeper into the earth, and burrowing out a hole where they\r\nmight effect their change undisturbed; and they do the same in winter,\r\nduring which they become torpid and do not eat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Transformations of the Cockchafer (_Melolontha\r\nvulgaris_). _a_, Newly-hatched larvæ. _b_, larva, one year old. _c_,\r\nthe same larva at the second year of its growth. _d_, the same three\r\nyears old. _e_, section of a bank of earth, containing the chrysalis of\r\nthe fourth year. _f_, the chafer first emerging from the earth. _g_,\r\nthe perfect chafer in a sitting posture. _h_, the same flying]\r\n\r\nWhen the grub changes into a pupa, in the third autumn after it is\r\nhatched, it digs a similar burrow about a yard deep; and when kept in\r\na pot, and prevented from going deep enough, it shows great uneasiness\r\nand often dies. The perfect beetle comes forth from the pupa in January\r\nor February; but it is then as soft as it was whilst still a grub, and\r\ndoes not acquire its hardness and colour for ten or twelve days, nor\r\ndoes it venture above ground before May, in the fourth year from the\r\ntime of its hatching. At this time, the beetles may be observed issuing\r\nfrom their holes in the evening, and dashing themselves about in the\r\nair as if blind.\r\n\r\nDuring the three summers then of their existence in the grub state,\r\nthese insects do immense injury, burrowing between the turf and the\r\nsoil, and devouring the roots of grass and other plants; so that the\r\nturf may easily be rolled off, as if cut by a turfing spade, while the\r\nsoil underneath for an inch or more is turned into soft mould like the\r\nbed of a garden. Mr. Anderson, of Norwich, mentions having seen a whole\r\nfield of fine flourishing grass so undermined by these grubs, that in a\r\nfew weeks it became as dry, brittle, and withered as hay.[CK] Bingley\r\nalso tells us that \"about sixty years ago, a farm near Norwich was so\r\ninfested with cockchafers, that the farmer and his servants affirmed\r\nthey gathered eighty bushels of them; and the grubs had done so much\r\ninjury, that the court of the city, in compassion to the poor fellow's\r\nmisfortune, allowed him twenty-five pounds.\"[CL] In the year 1785, a\r\nfarmer, near Blois, in France, employed a number of children and poor\r\npersons to destroy the cockchafers at the rate of two liards a hundred,\r\nand in a few days they collected fourteen thousand.[CM]\r\n\r\n\"I remember,\" says Salisbury, \"seeing in a nursery near Bagshot,\r\nseveral acres of young forest trees, particularly larch, the roots of\r\nwhich were completely destroyed by it, so much so that not a single\r\ntree was left alive.\"[CN] We are doubtful, however, whether this was\r\nthe grub of the cockchafer, and think it more likely to have been that\r\nof the green rose-beetle (_Cetonia aurata_), which feeds on the roots\r\nof trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XIV._\r\n\r\nARCHITECTURE OF ANTS.--MASON-ANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the species of ants are social. There are none solitary, as is\r\nthe case with bees and wasps. They are all more or less skilful in\r\narchitecture, some employing masonry, and others being carpenters,\r\nwood-carvers, and miners. They consequently afford much that is\r\ninteresting to naturalists who observe their operations. The genuine\r\nhistory of ants has only been recently investigated, first by Gould\r\nin 1747, and subsequently by Linnæus, De Geer, Huber, and Latreille.\r\nPrevious to that time their real industry and their imagined\r\nforesight were held up as moral lessons, without any great accuracy\r\nof observation; and it is probable that, even now, the mixture of\r\ntruth and error in Addison's delightful papers in the Guardian (Nos.\r\n156, 157) may be more generally attractive than the minute relation\r\nof careful naturalists. Gould disproved, most satisfactorily, the\r\nancient fable of ants storing up corn for winter provision, no species\r\nof ants ever eating grain, or feeding in the winter upon anything. It\r\nis to Huber the younger, however, that we are chiefly indebted for\r\nour knowledge of the habits and economy of ants; and to Latreille for\r\na closer distinction of the species. Some of the more interesting\r\nspecies, whose singular economy is described by the younger Huber, have\r\nnot been hitherto found in this country. We shall, however, discover\r\nmatter of very considerable interest in those which are indigenous;\r\nand as our principal object is to excite inquiry and observation with\r\nregard to those insects which may be easily watched in our own gardens\r\nand fields, we shall chiefly confine ourselves to the ants of these\r\nislands. We shall begin with the labours of those native ants which may\r\nbe called earth-masons, from their digging in the ground, and forming\r\nstructures with pellets of moistened loam, clay, or sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nMason-Ants.\r\n\r\nWe have used in the preceding pages the terms _mason-bees_ and\r\n_mason-wasps_, for insects which build their nests of earthy materials.\r\nOn the same principle, we have followed the ingenious M. Huber the\r\nyounger, in employing the term mason-ants for those whose nests on the\r\nexterior appear to be hillocks of earth, without the admixture of other\r\nmaterials, whilst in the interior they present a series of labyrinths,\r\nlodges, vaults, and galleries constructed with considerable skill. Of\r\nthese mason-ants, as of the mason-wasps and bees already described,\r\nthere are several species, differing from one another in their skill in\r\nthe art of architecture.\r\n\r\nOne of the most common of the ant-masons is the turf-ant (_Formica\r\ncæspitum_, Latr.), which is very small and of a blackish-brown colour.\r\nIts architecture is not upon quite so extensive a scale as some of the\r\nothers; but, though slight, it is very ingenious. Sometimes they make\r\nchoice of the shelter of a flat stone or other covering, beneath which\r\nthey hollow out chambers and communicating galleries; at other times\r\nthey are contented with the open ground; but most commonly they select\r\na tuft of grass or other herbage, the stems of which serve for columns\r\nto their earthen walls.\r\n\r\nWe had a small colony of these ants accidentally established in\r\na flower-pot, in which we were rearing some young plants of the\r\ntiger-lily (_Lilium tigrinum_), the stems of which being stronger than\r\nthe grass where they usually build, enabled them to rear their edifice\r\nhigher, and also to make it more secure, than they otherwise might.\r\nIt was wholly formed of small grains of moist earth, piled up between\r\nthe stems of the lily without any apparent cement; indeed it has been\r\nascertained by Huber, as we shall afterwards see, that they use no\r\ncement beside water. This is not always to be procured, as they depend\r\naltogether on rains and dew; but they possess the art of joining grains\r\nof dry sand so as to support one another, on some similar principle, no\r\ndoubt, to that of the arch.\r\n\r\nThe nest which our turf-ants constructed in the flower-pot was\r\nexternally of an imperfect square form, in consequence of its\r\nsituation; for they usually prefer a circular plan. The principal\r\nchambers were placed under the arches, and, when inspected, contained\r\na pile of cocoons, and pupæ. Beneath those upper chambers there were\r\nothers dug out deeper down, in which were also a numerous collection of\r\neggs and cocoons in various stages of advancement. (J. R.)\r\n\r\nMr. Knapp describes a still more curious structure of another species\r\nof ant common in this country:--\"One year,\" says he, \"on the third of\r\nMarch, my labourer being employed in cutting up ant-hills, or tumps\r\nas we call them, exposed to view multitudes of the yellow species\r\n(_Formica flava_) in their winter's retirement. They were collected in\r\nnumbers in little cells and compartments, communicating with others by\r\nmeans of narrow passages. In many of the cells they had deposited their\r\nlarvæ, which they were surrounding and attending, but not brooding over\r\nor covering. Being disturbed by our rude operations, they removed them\r\nfrom our sight to more hidden compartments. The larvæ were small. Some\r\nof these ant-hills contained multitudes of the young of the wood-louse\r\n(_Oniscus armadillo_), inhabiting with perfect familiarity the same\r\ncompartments as the ants, crawling about with great activity with them,\r\nand perfectly domesticated with each other. They were small and white;\r\nbut the constant vibration of their antennæ, and the alacrity of their\r\nmotions, manifested a healthy vigour. The ants were in a torpid state;\r\nbut on being removed into a temperate room, they assumed much of their\r\nsummer's animation. How these creatures are supported during the winter\r\nseason it is difficult to comprehend; as in no one instance could we\r\nperceive any store or provision made for the supply of their wants.\r\nThe minute size of the larvæ manifested that they had been recently\r\ndeposited; and consequently that their parents had not remained during\r\nwinter in a dormant state, and thus free from the calls of hunger. The\r\npreceding month of February, and part of January, had been remarkably\r\nsevere; the frost had penetrated deep into the earth, and long held it\r\nfrozen; the ants were in many cases not more than four inches beneath\r\nthe surface, and must have been enclosed in a mass of frozen soil for\r\na long period; yet they, their young, and the onisci, were perfectly\r\nuninjured by it: affording another proof of the fallacy of the commonly\r\nreceived opinion, that cold is _universally_ destructive to insect\r\nlife.\"[CO]\r\n\r\nThe earth employed by mason-ants is usually moist clay, either dug from\r\nthe interior parts of their city or moistened by rain. The mining-ants\r\nand the ash-coloured (_Formica fusca_) employ earth which is probably\r\nnot selected with so much care, for it forms a much coarser mortar than\r\nwhat we see used in the structure of the yellow ants (_F. flava_) and\r\nthe brown ants (_F. brunnea_). We have never observed them bringing\r\ntheir building materials of this kind from a distance, like the\r\nmason-bees and like the wood or hill ant (_F. rufa_); but they take\r\ncare, before they fix upon a locality, that it shall produce them all\r\nthat they require. We are indebted to Huber the younger for the most\r\ncomplete account which has hitherto been given of these operations, of\r\nwhich details we shall make free use.\r\n\r\n\"To form,\" says this shrewd observer, \"a correct judgment of the\r\ninterior arrangement or distribution of an ant-hill, it is necessary to\r\nselect such as have not been accidentally spoiled, or whose form has\r\nnot been too much altered by local circumstances; a slight attention\r\nwill then suffice to show that the habitations of the different species\r\nare not all constructed after the same system. Thus, the hillock raised\r\nby the ash-coloured ants will always present thick walls, fabricated\r\nwith coarse earth, well-marked stories, and large chambers, with\r\nvaulted ceilings, resting upon a solid base. We never observe roads, or\r\ngalleries, properly so called, but large passages, of an oval form, and\r\nall around considerable cavities and extensive embankments of earth. We\r\nfurther notice, that the little architects observe a certain proportion\r\nbetween the large arched ceilings and the pillars that are to support\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"The brown ant (_Formica brunnea_), one of the smallest of the ants, is\r\nparticularly remarkable for the extreme finish of its work. Its body is\r\nof a reddish shining brown, its head a little deeper, and the antennæ\r\nand feet a little lighter in colour. The abdomen is of an obscure\r\nbrown, the scale narrow, of a square form, and slightly scolloped. The\r\nbody is one line and two-fifths in length.[CP]\r\n\r\n\"This ant, one of the most industrious of its tribe, forms its nest\r\nof stories four or five lines in height. The partitions are not more\r\nthan half a line in thickness; and the substance of which they are\r\ncomposed is so finely grained, that the inner walls present one smooth\r\nunbroken surface. These stories are not horizontal; they follow the\r\nslope of the ant-hill, and lie one upon another to the ground-floor,\r\nwhich communicates with the subterranean lodges. They are not always,\r\nhowever, arranged with the same regularity, for these ants do not\r\nfollow an invariable plan; it appears, on the contrary, that nature\r\nhas allowed them a certain latitude in this respect, and that they\r\ncan, according to circumstances, modify them to their wish; but\r\nhowever fantastical their habitations may appear, we always observe\r\nthey have been formed by concentrical stories. On examining each\r\nstory separately, we observe a number of cavities or halls, lodges\r\nof narrower dimensions, and long galleries, which serve for general\r\ncommunication. The arched ceilings covering the most spacious places\r\nare supported either by little columns, slender walls, or by regular\r\nbuttresses. We also notice chambers, that have but one entrance,\r\ncommunicating with the lower story, and large open spaces, serving as a\r\nkind of cross-road (_carrefour_), in which all the streets terminate.\r\n\r\n\"Such is the manner in which the habitations of these ants are\r\nconstructed. Upon opening them, we commonly find the apartments, as\r\nwell as the large open spaces, filled with adult ants; and always\r\nobserved their pupæ collected in the apartments more or less near the\r\nsurface. This, however, seems regulated by the hour of the day, and\r\nthe temperature: for in this respect these ants are endowed with\r\ngreat sensibility, and know the degree of heat best adapted for their\r\nyoung. The ant-hill contains, sometimes, more than twenty stories\r\nin its upper portion, and at least as many under the surface of the\r\nground. By this arrangement the ants are enabled, with the greatest\r\nfacility, to regulate the heat. When a too-burning sun overheats their\r\nupper apartments, they withdraw their little ones to the bottom of\r\nthe ant-hill. The ground-floor becoming, in its turn, uninhabitable\r\nduring the rainy season, the ants of this species transport what most\r\ninterests them to the higher stories; and it is there we find them more\r\nusually assembled, with their eggs and pupæ, when the subterranean\r\napartments are submerged.\"[CQ]\r\n\r\nAnts have a great dislike to water, when it exceeds that of a light\r\nshower to moisten their building materials. One species, mentioned\r\nby Azara as indigenous to South America, instinctively builds a nest\r\nfrom three to six feet high,[CR] to provide against the inundations\r\nduring the rainy season. Even this, however, does not always save them\r\nfrom submersion; and, when that occurs, they are compelled, in order\r\nto prevent themselves from being swept away, to form a group somewhat\r\nsimilar to the curtain of the wax-workers of hive-bees (see p. 133).\r\nThe ants constituting the basis of this group lay hold of some shrub\r\nfor security, while their companions hold on by them; and thus the\r\nwhole colony, forming an animated raft, floats on the surface of the\r\nwater till the inundation (which seldom continues longer than a day\r\nor two) subsides. We confess, however, that we are somewhat sceptical\r\nrespecting this story, notwithstanding the very high character of the\r\nSpanish naturalist.\r\n\r\nIt is usual with architectural insects to employ some animal secretion,\r\nby way of mortar or size, to temper the materials with which they\r\nwork; but the whole economy of ants is so different, that it would be\r\nwrong to infer from analogy a similarity in this respect, though the\r\nexquisite polish and extreme delicacy of finish in their structures\r\nlead, naturally, to such a conclusion. M. P. Huber, in order to resolve\r\nthis question, at first thought of subjecting the materials of the\r\nwalls to chemical analysis, but wisely (as we think) abandoned it for\r\nthe surer method of observation. The details which he has given, as the\r\nresult of his researches, are exceedingly curious and instructive. He\r\nbegan by observing an ant-hill till he could perceive some change in\r\nits form.\r\n\r\n\"The inhabitants,\" says he, \"of that which I selected, kept within\r\nduring the day, or only went out by subterranean galleries which opened\r\nat some feet distance in the meadow. There were, however, two or three\r\nsmall openings on the surface of the nest; but I saw none of the\r\nlabourers pass out this way, on account of their being too much exposed\r\nto the sun, which these insects greatly dread. This ant-hill, which\r\nhad a round form, rose in the grass, at the border of a path, and had\r\nsustained no injury. I soon perceived that the freshness of the air and\r\nthe dew invited the ants to walk over the surface of their nest; they\r\nbegan making new apertures; several ants might be seen arriving at the\r\nsame time, thrusting their heads from the entrances, moving about their\r\nantennæ, and at length adventuring forth to visit the environs.\r\n\r\n\"This brought to my recollection a singular opinion of the ancients.\r\nThey believed that ants were occupied in their architectural labours\r\nduring the night, when the moon was at its full.\"[CS]\r\n\r\nM. Latreille discovered a species of ants which were, so far as he\r\ncould ascertain, completely blind,[CT] and of course it would be\r\nimmaterial to them whether they worked by night or during the day.\r\nAll observers indeed agree that ants labour in the night, and a\r\nFrench naturalist is therefore of opinion that they never sleep--a\r\ncircumstance which is well ascertained with respect to other animals,\r\nsuch as the shark, which will track a ship in full sail for weeks\r\ntogether.[CU] The ingenious historian of English ants, Gould, says\r\nthey never intermit their labours by night or by day, except when\r\ncompelled by excessive rains. It is probable the ancients were mistaken\r\nin asserting that they only work when the moon shines;[CV] for, like\r\nbees, they seem to find no difficulty in building in the dark, their\r\nsubterranean apartments being as well finished as the upper stories of\r\ntheir buildings. But to proceed with the narrative of M. P. Huber.\r\n\r\n\"Having thus noticed the movements of these insects during the night,\r\nI found they were almost always abroad and engaged about the dome of\r\ntheir habitation after sunset. This was directly the reverse of what I\r\nhad observed in the conduct of the wood-ants (_F. rufa_), who only go\r\nout during the day, and close their doors in the evening. The contrast\r\nwas still more remarkable than I had previously supposed; for, upon\r\nvisiting the brown ants some days after, during a gentle rain, I saw\r\nall their architectural talents in full play.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the rain commenced, they left in great numbers their\r\nsubterranean residence, re-entered it almost immediately, and then\r\nreturned, bearing between their teeth pellets of earth, which they\r\ndeposited on the roof of their nest. I could not at first conceive what\r\nthis was meant for, but at length I saw little walls start up on all\r\nsides with spaces left between them. In several places, columns, ranged\r\nat regular distances, announced halls, lodges, and passages which the\r\nants proposed establishing; in a word, it was the rough beginning of a\r\nnew story.\r\n\r\n\"I watched with a considerable degree of interest the most trifling\r\nmovements of my masons, and found they did not work after the manner\r\nof wasps and humble-bees, when occupied in constructing a covering\r\nto their nest. The latter sit, as it were, astride on the border or\r\nmargin of the covering, and take it between their teeth to model and\r\nattenuate it according to their wish. The wax of which it is composed,\r\nand the paper which the wasp employs, moistened by some kind of glue,\r\nare admirably adapted for this purpose, but the earth of which the ants\r\nmake use, from its often possessing little tenacity, must be worked up\r\nafter some other manner.\r\n\r\n\"Each ant, then, carried between its teeth the pellet of earth it had\r\nformed by scraping with the end of its mandibles the bottom of its\r\nabode, a circumstance which I have frequently witnessed in open day.\r\nThis little mass of earth, being composed of particles but just united,\r\ncould be readily kneaded and moulded as the ants wished; thus when\r\nthey had applied it to the spot where they had to rest, they divided\r\nand pressed against it with their teeth, so as to fill up the little\r\ninequalities of their wall. The antennæ followed all their movements,\r\npassing over each particle of earth as soon as it was placed in its\r\nproper position. The whole was then rendered more compact by pressing\r\nit lightly with the fore-feet. This work went on remarkably fast.\r\nAfter having traced out the plan of their masonry, in laying here and\r\nthere foundations for the pillars and partitions they were about to\r\nerect, they raised them gradually higher, by adding fresh materials.\r\nIt often happened that two little walls, which were to form a gallery,\r\nwere raised opposite, and at a slight distance from each other. When\r\nthey had attained the height of four or five lines, the ants busied\r\nthemselves in covering in the space left between them by a vaulted\r\nceiling.\r\n\r\n\"As if they judged all their partitions of sufficient elevation, they\r\nthen quitted their labours in the upper part of the building; they\r\naffixed to the interior and upper part of each wall fragments of\r\nmoistened earth, in an almost horizontal direction, and in such a way\r\nas to form a ledge, which, by extension, would be made to join that\r\ncoming from the opposite wall. These ledges were about half a line in\r\nthickness; and the breadth of the galleries was, for the most part,\r\nabout a quarter of an inch. On one side several vertical partitions\r\nwere seen to form the scaffolding of a lodge, which communicated with\r\nseveral corridors by apertures formed in the masonry; on another, a\r\nregularly-formed hall was constructed, the vaulted ceiling of which\r\nwas sustained by numerous pillars; further off, again, might be\r\nrecognised the rudiments of one of those cross roads of which I have\r\nbefore spoken, and in which several avenues terminate. These parts of\r\nthe ant-hill were the most spacious; the ants, however, did not appear\r\nembarrassed in constructing the ceiling to cover them in, although they\r\nwere often more than two inches in breadth.\r\n\r\n\"In the upper part of the angles formed by the different walls, they\r\nlaid the first foundations of this ceiling, and from the top of each\r\npillar, as from so many centres, a layer of earth, horizontal and\r\nslightly convex, was carried forward to meet the several portions\r\ncoming from different points of the large public thoroughfare.\r\n\r\n\"I sometimes, however, laboured under an apprehension that the building\r\ncould not possibly resist its own weight, and that such extensive\r\nceilings, sustained only by a few pillars, would fall into ruin from\r\nthe rain which continually dropped upon them; but I was quickly\r\nconvinced of their stability, from observing that the earth brought by\r\nthese insects adhered at all points, on the slightest contact; and that\r\nthe rain, so far from lessening the cohesion of its particles, appeared\r\neven to increase it. Thus, instead of injuring the building, it even\r\ncontributed to render it still more secure.\r\n\r\n\"These particles of moistened earth, which are only held together by\r\njuxtaposition, require a fall of rain to cement them more closely,\r\nand thus varnish over, as it were, those places where the walls and\r\ngalleries remain uncovered. All inequalities in the masonry then\r\ndisappear. The upper part of these stories, formed of several pieces\r\nbrought together, presents but one single layer of compact earth. They\r\nrequire for their complete consolidation nothing but the heat of the\r\nsun. It sometimes, however, happens that a violent rain will destroy\r\nthe apartments, especially should they be but slightly arched; but\r\nunder these circumstances the ants reconstruct them with wonderful\r\npatience.\r\n\r\n\"These different labours were carried on at the same time, and were\r\nso closely followed up in the different quarters, that the ant-hill\r\nreceived an additional story in the course of seven or eight hours. All\r\nthe vaulted ceilings being formed upon a regular plan, and at equal\r\ndistances from one wall to the other, constituted, when finished, but\r\none single roof. Scarcely had the ants finished one story than they\r\nbegan to construct another; but they had not time to finish it--the\r\nrain ceasing before the ceiling was fully completed. They still,\r\nhowever, continued their work for a few hours, taking advantage of\r\nthe humidity of the earth; but a keen north wind soon sprung up, and\r\nhastily dried the collected fragments, which, no longer possessing\r\nthe same adherence, readily fell into powder. The ants, finding their\r\nefforts ineffectual, were at length discouraged, and abandoned their\r\nemployment; but what was my astonishment when I saw them destroy all\r\nthe apartments that were yet uncovered, scattering here and there over\r\nthe last story the materials of which they had been composed! These\r\nfacts incontestably prove that they employ neither gum, nor any kind of\r\ncement, to bind together the several substances of their nest; but in\r\nplace of this avail themselves of the rain, to work or knead the earth,\r\nleaving the sun and wind to dry and consolidate it.\"[CW]\r\n\r\nDr. Johnson of Bristol observed very similar proceedings in the case\r\nof a colony of red ants (_Myrmica rubra?_), the roof of whose nest was\r\nformed by a flat stone. During dry weather, a portion of the side walls\r\nfell in; but the rubbish was quickly removed, though no repairs were\r\nattempted till a shower of rain enabled them to work. As soon as this\r\noccurred, they worked with extraordinary rapidity, and in a short time\r\nthe whole of the fallen parts were rebuilt, and rendered as smooth as\r\nif polished with a trowel.\r\n\r\nWhen a gardener wishes to water a plot of ground where he has sown\r\nseeds that require nice management, he dips a strong brush into\r\nwater, and passes his hand backwards and forwards over the hairs for\r\nthe purpose of producing a fine artificial shower. Huber successfully\r\nadopted the same method to excite his ants to recommence their labours,\r\nwhich had been interrupted for want of moisture. But sometimes, when\r\nthey deem it unadvisable to wait for rain, they dig down (as we\r\nremarked to be the practice of the mason-bees) till they arrive at\r\nearth sufficiently moist for their purpose. They do not, however, like\r\nthese bees, merely dig for materials; for they use the excavations for\r\napartments, as well as what they construct with the materials thence\r\nderived. They appear, in short, to be no less skilful in mining than in\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nSuch is the general outline of the operations of this singular species;\r\nbut we are still more interested with the history which M. P. Huber\r\nhas given of the labours of an individual ant. \"One rainy day,\" he\r\nsays, \"I observed a labourer of the dark ash-coloured species (_Formica\r\nfusca_) digging the ground near the aperture which gave entrance to\r\nthe ant-hill. It placed in a heap the several fragments it had scraped\r\nup, and formed them into small pellets, which it deposited here and\r\nthere upon the nest. It returned constantly to the same place, and\r\nappeared to have a particular design, for it laboured with ardour and\r\nperseverance. I remarked a slight furrow, excavated in the ground in a\r\nstraight line, representing the plan of a path or gallery. The labourer\r\n(the whole of whose movements fell under my immediate observation) gave\r\nit greater depth and breadth, and cleared out its borders; and I saw,\r\nat length--in which I could not be deceived--that it had the intention\r\nof establishing an avenue which was to lead from one of the stories\r\nto the underground chambers. This path, which was about two or three\r\ninches in length, and formed by a single ant, was opened above, and\r\nbordered on each side by a buttress of earth. Its concavity, in the\r\nform of a pipe (_gouttière_), was of the most perfect regularity: for\r\nthe architect had not left an atom too much. The work of this ant was\r\nso well followed and understood, that I could almost to a certainty\r\nguess its next proceeding, and the very fragment it was about to\r\nremove. At the side of the opening where this path terminated was a\r\nsecond opening, to which it was necessary to arrive by some road. The\r\nsame ant began and finished this undertaking without assistance. It\r\nfurrowed out and opened another path, parallel to the first, leaving\r\nbetween each a little wall of three or four lines in height.\"\r\n\r\nLike the hive-bees, ants do not seem to work in concert, but each\r\nindividual separately. There is, consequently, an occasional want of\r\ncoincidence in the walls and arches; but this does not much embarrass\r\nthem, for a worker, on discovering an error of this kind, seems to know\r\nhow to rectify it, as appears from the following observations:--\r\n\r\n\"A wall,\" says M. Huber, \"had been erected, with the view of sustaining\r\na vaulted ceiling, still incomplete, that had been projected towards\r\nthe wall of the opposite chamber. The workman who began constructing\r\nit had given it too little elevation to meet the opposite partition,\r\nupon which it was to rest. Had it been continued on the original plan,\r\nit must infallibly have met the wall at about one-half of its height;\r\nand this it was necessary to avoid. This state of things very forcibly\r\nclaimed my attention; when one of the ants arriving at the place, and\r\nvisiting the works, appeared to be struck by the difficulty which\r\npresented itself; but this it as soon obviated, by taking down the\r\nceiling, and raising the wall upon which it reposed. It then, in my\r\npresence, constructed a new ceiling with the fragments of the former\r\none.\r\n\r\n\"When the ants commence any undertaking, one would suppose that they\r\nworked after some preconceived idea, which, indeed, would seem verified\r\nby the execution. Thus, should any ant discover upon the nest two\r\nstalks of plants which lie crossways, a disposition favourable to\r\nthe construction of a lodge, or some little beams that may be useful\r\nin forming its angles and sides, it examines the several parts with\r\nattention; then distributes, with much sagacity and address, parcels\r\nof earth in the spaces, and along the stems, taking from every quarter\r\nmaterials adapted to its object, sometimes not caring to destroy the\r\nwork that others had commenced; so much are its motions regulated\r\nby the idea it has conceived, and upon which it acts, with little\r\nattention to all else around it. It goes and returns, until the plan is\r\nsufficiently understood by its companions.\r\n\r\n\"In another part of the same ant-hill,\" continues M. Huber, \"several\r\nfragments of straw seemed expressly placed to form the roof of a large\r\nhouse: a workman took advantage of this disposition. These fragments\r\nlying horizontally, at half-an-inch distance from the ground, formed,\r\nin crossing each other, an oblong parallelogram. The industrious insect\r\ncommenced by placing earth in the several angles of this framework,\r\nand all along the little beams of which it was composed. The same\r\nworkman afterwards placed several rows of the same materials against\r\neach other, when the roof became very distinct. On perceiving the\r\npossibility of profiting by another plant to support a vertical wall,\r\nit began laying the foundations of it; other ants having by this time\r\narrived, finished in common what this had commenced.\"[CX]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nM. Huber made most of his observations upon the processes followed by\r\nants in glazed artificial hives or formicaries. The preceding figure\r\nrepresents a view of one of his formicaries of mason-ants.\r\n\r\nWe have ourselves followed up his observations, both on natural\r\nant-hills and in artificial formicaries. On digging cautiously into a\r\nnatural ant-hill, established upon the edge of a garden-walk, we were\r\nenabled to obtain a pretty complete view of the interior structure.\r\nThere were two stories, composed of large chambers, irregularly oval,\r\ncommunicating with each other by arched galleries, the walls of all\r\nwhich were as smooth and well-polished as if they had been passed over\r\nby a plasterer's trowel. The floors of the chambers, we remarked, were\r\nby no means either horizontal or level, but all more or less sloped,\r\nand exhibiting in each chamber at least two slight depressions of an\r\nirregular shape. We left the under story of this nest untouched, with\r\nthe notion that the ants might repair the upper galleries, of which\r\nwe had made a vertical section; but instead of doing so they migrated\r\nduring the day to a large crack formed by the dryness of the weather,\r\nabout a yard from their old nest. (J. R.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe put a number of yellow ants (_Formica flava_), with their eggs\r\nand cocoons, into a small glass frame, more than half full of moist\r\nsand taken from their native hill, and placed in a sloping position,\r\nin order to see whether they would bring the nearly vertical, and\r\ntherefore insecure, portion to a level by masonry. We were delighted to\r\nperceive that they immediately resolved upon performing the task which\r\nhad been assigned them, though they did not proceed very methodically\r\nin their manner of building; for instead of beginning at the bottom\r\nand building upwards, many of them went on to add to the top of the\r\nouter surface, which increased rather than diminished the insecurity\r\nof the whole. Withal, however, they seemed to know how far to go, for\r\nno portion of the newly-built wall fell; and in two days they had not\r\nonly reared a pyramidal mound to prop the rest, but had constructed\r\nseveral galleries and chambers for lodging the cocoons, which we had\r\nscattered at random amongst the sand. The new portion of this building\r\nis represented in the figure as supporting the upper and insecure parts\r\nof the nest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe are sorry to record that our ingenious little masons were found\r\nupon the third day strewed about the outside of the building dead or\r\ndying, either from over-fatigue or perhaps from surfeit, as we had\r\nsupplied them with as much honey as they could devour. A small colony\r\nof turf-ants have at this moment (July 28th, 1829) taken possession of\r\nthe premises of their own accord. (J. R.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XV._\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURES OF THE WOOD-ANT OR PISMIRE, AND OF CARPENTER-ANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe largest of our British ants is that called the Hill-ant by Gould,\r\nthe Fallow-ant by the English translator of Huber, and popularly\r\nthe Pismire; but which we think may be more appropriately named the\r\nWood-ant (_Formica rufa_, Latr.), from its invariable habit of living\r\nin or near woods and forests. This insect may be readily distinguished\r\nfrom other ants by the dusky black colour of its head and hinder\r\nparts, and the rusty brown of its middle. The structures reared by\r\nthis species are often of considerable magnitude, and bear no small\r\nresemblance to a rook's nest thrown upon the ground bottom upwards.\r\nThey occur in abundance in the woods near London, and in many other\r\nparts of the country: in Oak of Honour Wood alone, we are acquainted\r\nwith the localities of at least two dozen,--some in the interior, and\r\nothers on the hedge-banks on the outskirts of the wood. (J. R.)\r\n\r\nThe exterior of the nest is composed of almost every transportable\r\nmaterial which the colonists can find in their vicinity; but the\r\ngreater portion consists of the stems of withered grass and short\r\ntwigs of trees, piled up in apparent confusion, but with sufficient\r\nregularity to render the whole smooth, conical, and sloping towards\r\nthe base, for the purpose, we may infer, of carrying off rain-water.\r\nWhen within reach of a corn-field, they often also pick up grains\r\nof wheat, barley, or oats, and carry them to the nest as building\r\nmaterials, and not for food, as was believed by the ancients. There\r\nare wonders enough observable in the economy of ants, without having\r\nrecourse to fancy--wonders which made Aristotle extol the sagacity of\r\nbloodless animals, and Cicero ascribe to them not only sensation, but\r\nmind, reason, and memory.[CY] Ælian, however, describes, as if he had\r\nactually witnessed it, the ants ascending a stalk of growing corn, and\r\nthrowing down \"the ears which they bit off to their companions below.\"\r\nAldrovand assures us that he had seen their granaries; and others\r\npretend that they shrewdly bite off the ends of the grain to prevent it\r\nfrom germinating.[CZ] These are fables which accurate observation has\r\nsatisfactorily contradicted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nest of Wood-Ant.]\r\n\r\nBut these errors, as it frequently happens, have contributed to a\r\nmore perfect knowledge of the insects than we might otherwise have\r\nobtained; for it was the wish to prove or disprove the circumstance of\r\ntheir storing up and feeding upon grain which led Gould to make his\r\nobservations on English ants; as the notion of insects being produced\r\n_from_ putrid carcases had before led Redi to his ingenious experiments\r\non their generation. Yet, although it is more than eighty years since\r\nGould's book was published, we find the error still repeated in very\r\nrespectable publications.[DA]\r\n\r\nThe coping which we above described as forming the exterior of the\r\nwood-ant's nest, is only a small portion of the structure, which\r\nconsists of a great number of interior chambers and galleries, with\r\nfunnel-shaped avenues leading to them. The coping, indeed, is one of\r\nthe most essential parts, and we cannot follow a more delightful guide\r\nthan the younger Huber in detailing its formation.\r\n\r\n\"The labourers,\" he says, \"of which the colony is composed, not only\r\nwork continually on the outside of their nest, but, differing very\r\nessentially from other species, who willingly remain in the interior,\r\nsheltered from the sun, they prefer living in the open air, and do not\r\nhesitate to carry on, even in our presence, the greater part of their\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n\"To have an idea how the straw or stubble-roof is formed, let us take\r\na view of the ant-hill at its origin, when it is simply a cavity in\r\nthe earth. Some of its future inhabitants are seen wandering about\r\nin search of materials fit for the exterior work, with which, though\r\nrather irregularly, they cover up the entrance; whilst others are\r\nemployed in mixing the earth, thrown up in hollowing the interior,\r\nwith fragments of wood and leaves, which are every moment brought in\r\nby their fellow-assistants; and this gives a certain consistence to\r\nthe edifice, which increases in size daily. Our little architects\r\nleave here and there cavities, where they intend constructing the\r\ngalleries which are to lead to the exterior, and as they remove in\r\nthe morning the barriers placed at the entrance of their nest the\r\npreceding evening, the passages are kept open during the whole time\r\nof its construction. We soon observed the roof to become convex; but\r\nwe should be greatly deceived did we consider it solid. This roof is\r\ndestined to include many apartments or stories. Having observed the\r\nmotions of these little builders through a pane of glass, adjusted\r\nagainst one of their habitations, I am thence enabled to speak with\r\nsome degree of certainty upon the manner in which they are constructed.\r\nI ascertained that it is by excavating or mining the under portion of\r\ntheir edifice that they form their spacious halls--low, indeed, and of\r\nheavy construction, yet sufficiently convenient for the use to which\r\nthey are appropriated, that of receiving, at certain hours of the day,\r\nthe larvæ and pupæ.\r\n\r\n\"These halls have a free communication by galleries, made in the same\r\nmanner. If the materials of which the ant-hill is composed were only\r\ninterlaced, they would fall into a confused heap every time the ants\r\nattempted to bring them into regular order. This, however, is obviated\r\nby their tempering the earth with rain-water, which, afterwards\r\nhardened in the sun, so completely and effectually binds together the\r\nseveral substances, as to permit the removal of certain fragments\r\nfrom the ant-hill without any injury to the rest; it, moreover,\r\nstrongly opposes the introduction of the rain. I never found, even\r\nafter long and violent rains, the interior of the nest wetted to more\r\nthan a quarter of an inch from the surface, provided it had not been\r\npreviously out of repair, or deserted by its inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\"The ants are extremely well sheltered in their chambers, the largest\r\nof which is placed nearly in the centre of the building; it is much\r\nloftier than the rest, and traversed only by the beams that support the\r\nceiling; it is in this spot that all the galleries terminate, and this\r\nforms, for the most part, their usual residence.\r\n\r\n\"As to the underground portion, it can only be seen when the ant-hill\r\nis placed against a declivity; all the interior may be then readily\r\nbrought in view, by simply raising up the straw roof. The subterranean\r\nresidence consists of a range of apartments, excavated in the earth,\r\ntaking an horizontal direction.\"[DB]\r\n\r\n[It seems rather surprising that the wood-ants should be able, with\r\nsuch materials as they employ, to make a dome-shaped structure, which\r\nshall be furnished with cells and galleries, and yet shall endure rain\r\nand wind, without being penetrated by the one or blown away by the\r\nother. If the hill be closely examined, the little sticks of which it\r\nis composed will be seen to have a definite, though not very regular\r\narrangement; and it is a noteworthy circumstance that the longest\r\nare preserved for the galleries, being laid across each other in a\r\nvery ingenious manner, so as to prevent the material from falling and\r\nfilling up the galleries. This structure was shown very clearly in a\r\nhuge ant-hill in Bagshot Park. We introduced a sheet of plate glass\r\ninto the nest, so as to divide it perpendicularly into two halves, and\r\nhaving given the insects six weeks to repair damages, we removed one\r\nhalf of the hill, so that the whole interior of the other half could\r\nbe seen through the glass. The whole economy of the nest was thus made\r\nclear, and the artificial arrangement of the materials showed itself\r\nvery plainly on the roofs of the cells and galleries.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nM. P. Huber, in order to observe the operations of the wood-ant\r\nwith more attention, transferred colonies of them to his artificial\r\nformicaries, plunging the feet of the stand into water to prevent their\r\nescape till they were reconciled to their abode, and had made some\r\nprogress in repairing it.\r\n\r\n[Under the glass shade on the top of the formicary may be seen the\r\nmound which the wood-ants have raised, according to their custom, and\r\nbelow, through the glass front, the reader may see the various passages\r\nand cells which communicate with the hill above. As the ants require\r\nthat the lower part of their dwelling should be in darkness, a stout\r\nwooden door can be shut over the glass to exclude the light.]\r\n\r\nThere is this remarkable difference in the nest of the wood-ants, that\r\nthey do not construct a long covert way as if for concealment, as\r\nthe yellow and the brown ants do. The wood-ants are not, like them,\r\nafraid of being surprised by enemies, at least during the day, when\r\nthe whole colony is either foraging in the vicinity or employed on the\r\nexterior. But the proceedings of the wood-ants at night are well worthy\r\nof notice; and when M. Huber began to study their economy, he directed\r\nhis entire attention to their night proceedings. \"I remarked,\" says\r\nhe, \"that their habitations changed in appearance hourly, and that the\r\ndiameter of those spacious avenues, where so many ants could freely\r\npass each other during the day, was, as night approached, gradually\r\nlessened. The aperture, at length, totally disappeared, the dome was\r\nclosed on all sides, and the ants retired to the bottom of their nest.\r\n\r\n\"In further noticing the apertures of these ant-hills, I fully\r\nascertained the nature of the labour of its inhabitants, of which I\r\ncould not before even guess the purport; for the surface of the nest\r\npresented such a constant scene of agitation, and so many insects were\r\noccupied in carrying materials in every direction, that the movement\r\noffered no other image than that of confusion.\r\n\r\n\"I saw then clearly that they were engaged in stopping up passages; and\r\nfor this purpose they at first brought forward little pieces of wood,\r\nwhich they deposited near the entrance of those avenues they wished to\r\nclose; they placed them in the stubble; they then went to seek other\r\ntwigs and fragments of wood, which they disposed above the first, but\r\nin a different direction, and appeared to choose pieces of less size in\r\nproportion as the work advanced. They, at length, brought in a number\r\nof dried leaves, and other materials of an enlarged form, with which\r\nthey covered the roof: an exact miniature of the art of our builders,\r\nwhen they form the covering of any building. Nature, indeed, seems\r\neverywhere to have anticipated the inventions of which we boast, and\r\nthis is doubtless one of the most simple.\r\n\r\n\"Our little insects, now in safety in their nest, retire gradually\r\nto the interior before the last passages are closed; one or two only\r\nremain without, or concealed behind the doors on guard, while the\r\nrest either take their repose, or engage in different occupations in\r\nthe most perfect security. I was impatient to know what took place in\r\nthe morning upon these ant-hills, and therefore visited them at an\r\nearly hour. I found them in the same state in which I had left them\r\nthe preceding evening. A few ants were wandering about on the surface\r\nof the nest, some others issued from time to time from under the\r\nmargin of their little roofs formed at the entrance of the galleries;\r\nothers afterwards came forth, who began removing the wooden bars that\r\nblockaded the entrance, in which they readily succeeded. This labour\r\noccupied them several hours. The passages were at length free, and the\r\nmaterials with which they had been closed scattered here and there over\r\nthe ant-hill. Every day, morning and evening, during the fine weather,\r\nI was a witness to similar proceedings. On days of rain the doors of\r\nall the ant-hills remained closed. When the sky was cloudy in the\r\nmorning, or rain was indicated, the ants, who seemed to be aware of it,\r\nopened but in part their several avenues, and immediately closed them\r\nwhen the rain commenced.\"[DC]\r\n\r\nThe galleries and chambers which are roofed in as thus described are\r\nvery similar to those of the mason-ants, being partly excavated in the\r\nearth, and partly built with the clay thence procured. It is in these\r\nthey pass the night, and also the colder months of the winter, when\r\nthey become torpid, or nearly so, and of course require not the winter\r\ngranaries of corn with which the ancients fabulously furnished them.\r\n\r\n\r\nCarpenter-Ants.\r\n\r\nThe ants that work in wood perform much more extensive operations\r\nthan any of the other carpenter insects which we have mentioned.\r\nTheir only tools, like those of bees and wasps, are their jaws or\r\nmandibles; but though these may not appear so curiously constructed as\r\nthe ovipositor file of the tree-hopper (_Cicada_), or the rasp and saw\r\nof the saw-flies (_Tenthredinidæ_), they are no less efficient in the\r\nperformance of what is required. Among the carpenter-ants, the emmet or\r\njet-ant (_F. fuliginosa_) holds the first rank, and is easily known by\r\nbeing rather less in size than the wood-ant, and by its fine shining\r\nblack colour. It is less common in Britain than some of the preceding,\r\nthough its colonies may occasionally be met with in the trunks of\r\ndecaying oak or willow trees in hedges.\r\n\r\n\"The labourers,\" says Huber, \"of this species work always in the\r\ninterior of trees, and are desirous of being screened from observation:\r\nthus every hope on our part is precluded of following them in their\r\nseveral occupations. I tried every expedient I could devise to surmount\r\nthis difficulty; I endeavoured to accustom these ants to live and work\r\nunder my inspection, but all my efforts were unsuccessful; they even\r\nabandoned the most considerable portion of their nest to seek some\r\nnew asylum, and spurned the honey and sugar which I offered them for\r\nnourishment. I was now, by necessity, limited to the inspection only of\r\ntheir edifices: but, by decomposing some of the fragments with care, I\r\nhoped to acquire some knowledge of their organization.\r\n\r\n\"On one side I found horizontal galleries, hidden in great part by\r\ntheir walls, which follow the circular direction of the layers of the\r\nwood; and on another, parallel galleries, separated by extremely thin\r\npartitions, having no communication except by a few oval apertures.\r\nSuch is the nature of these works, remarkable for their delicacy and\r\nlightness.\r\n\r\n\"In other fragments I found avenues which opened laterally, including\r\nportions of walls and transverse partitions, erected here and there\r\nwithin the galleries, so as to form separate chambers. When the work\r\nis further advanced, round holes are always observed, encased, as\r\nit were, between two pillars cut out in the same wall. These holes\r\nin course of time become square, and the pillars, originally arched\r\nat both ends, are worked into regular columns by the chisel of our\r\nsculptors. This, then, is the second specimen of their art. This\r\nportion of the edifice will probably remain in this state.\r\n\r\n\"But in another quarter are fragments differently wrought, in which\r\nthese same partitions, pierced now in every part, and hewn skilfully,\r\nare transformed into colonnades, which sustain the upper stories, and\r\nleave a free communication throughout the whole extent. It can readily\r\nbe perceived how parallel galleries, hollowed out upon the same plan,\r\nand the sides taken down, leaving only from space to space what is\r\nnecessary to sustain their ceilings, may form an entire story; but as\r\neach has been pierced separately, the flooring cannot be very level:\r\nthis, however, the ants turn to their advantage, since these furrows\r\nare better adapted to retain the larvæ that may be placed there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Portion of a Tree, with Chambers and Galleries chiseled\r\nout by Jet-Ants.]\r\n\r\n\"The stories constructed in the great roots offer greater irregularity\r\nthan those in the very body of the tree, arising either from the\r\nhardness and interlacing of the fibres, which renders the labour more\r\ndifficult, and obliges the labourers to depart from their accustomed\r\nmanner, or from their not observing in the extremities of their edifice\r\nthe same arrangement as in the centre: whatever it be, horizontal\r\nstories and numerous partitions are still found. If the work be less\r\nregular, it becomes more delicate; for the ants, profiting by the\r\nhardness and solidity of the materials, give to their building an\r\nextreme degree of lightness. I have seen fragments of from eight to\r\nten inches in length, and of equal height, formed of wood as thin\r\nas paper, containing a number of apartments, and presenting a most\r\nsingular appearance. At the entrance of these apartments, worked out\r\nwith so much care, are very considerable openings; but in place of\r\nchambers and extensive galleries, the layers of the wood are hewn in\r\narcades, allowing the ants a free passage in every direction. These\r\nmay be regarded as the gates or vestibules conducting to the several\r\nlodges.\"[DD]\r\n\r\nIt is a singular circumstance in the structures of these ants, that all\r\nthe wood which they carve is tinged of a black colour, as if it were\r\nsmoked; and M. Huber was not a little solicitous to discover whence\r\nthis arose. It certainly does not add to the beauty of their streets,\r\nwhich look as sombre as the most smoke-dyed walls in the older lanes\r\nof the metropolis. M. Huber could not satisfy himself whether it was\r\ncaused by the exposure of the wood to the atmosphere, by some emanation\r\nfrom the ants, or by the thin layers of wood being acted upon or\r\ndecomposed by the formic acid.[DE] But if any or all of these causes\r\noperated in blackening the wood, we should be ready to anticipate a\r\nsimilar effect in the case of other species of ants which inhabit\r\ntrees; yet the black tint is only found in the excavations of the\r\njet-ant.\r\n\r\nWe are acquainted with several colonies of the jet-ants (_Formica\r\nfuliginosa_)--one of which, in the roots and trunk of an oak on the\r\nroad from Lewisham to Sydenham, near Brockley, in Kent, is so extremely\r\npopulous, that the numbers of its inhabitants appeared to us beyond any\r\nreasonable estimate. None of the other colonies of this species which\r\nwe have seen appear to contain many hundreds. On cutting into the root\r\nof the before-mentioned tree, we found the vertical excavations of much\r\nlarger dimensions, both in width and depth, than those represented by\r\nHuber in the preceding cut (page 302). What surprised us the most was\r\nto see the tree growing vigorously and fresh, though its roots were\r\nchiseled in all directions by legions of workers, while every leaf, and\r\nevery inch of the bark, was also crowded by parties of foragers. On\r\none of the low branches we found a deserted nest of the white-throat\r\n(_Sylvia cinerea_, Temminck), in the cavity of which they were piled\r\nupon one another as close as the unhappy negroes in the hold of a\r\nslave-ship; but we could not discover what had attracted them hither.\r\nAnother dense group, collected on one of the branches, led us to the\r\ndiscovery of a very singular oak gall, formed on the bark in the shape\r\nof a pointed cone, and crowded together. It is probable that the juice\r\nwhich they extracted from these galls was much to their taste. (J. R.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: F. fuliginosa.]\r\n\r\nBeside the jet-ant, several other species exercise the art of\r\ncarpentry,--nay, what is more wonderful still, they have the ingenuity\r\nto knead up, with spider's-web for a cement, the chips which they\r\nchisel out into a material with which they construct entire chambers.\r\nThe species which exercise this singular art are the Ethiopian\r\n(_Formica nigra_) and the yellow ant (_F. flava_).[DF]\r\n\r\nWe once observed the dusky ants (_F. fusca_) at Blackheath, in Kent,\r\nbusily employed in carrying out chips from the interior of a decaying\r\nblack poplar, at the root of which a colony was established; but,\r\nthough it thence appears that this species can chisel wood if they\r\nchoose, yet they usually burrow in the earth, and by preference, as we\r\nhave remarked, at the root of a tree, the leaves of which supply them\r\nwith food.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the foreign ants we may mention a small yellow ant of South\r\nAmerica, described by Dampier, which seems, from his account, to\r\nconstruct a nest of green leaves. \"Their sting,\" he says, \"is like\r\na spark of fire; and they are so thick among the boughs in some\r\nplaces, that one shall be covered with them before he is aware. These\r\ncreatures have nests on great trees, placed on the body between the\r\nlimbs: some of their nests are as big as a hogshead. This is their\r\nwinter habitation; for in the wet season they all repair to these their\r\ncities, where they preserve their eggs. In the dry season, when they\r\nleave their nests, they swarm all over the woodlands, for they never\r\ntrouble the savannahs. Great paths, three or four inches broad, made by\r\nthem, may be seen in the woods. They go out light, but bring home heavy\r\nloads on their backs, all of the same substance, and equal in size. I\r\nnever observed anything besides pieces of green leaves, so big that I\r\ncould scarcely see the insect for his burthen; yet they would march\r\nstoutly, and so many were pressing forward that it was a very pretty\r\nsight, for the path looked perfectly green with them.\"\r\n\r\nAnts observed in New South Wales, by the gentlemen in the expedition\r\nunder Captain Cook, are still more interesting. \"Some,\" we are told,\r\n\"are as green as a leaf, and live upon trees, where they build their\r\nnests of various sizes, between that of a man's head and his fist.\r\nThese nests are of a very curious structure: they are formed by bending\r\ndown several of the leaves, each of which is as broad as a man's hand,\r\nand gluing the points of them together, so as to form a purse. The\r\nviscous matter used for this purpose is an animal juice which nature\r\nhas enabled them to elaborate. Their method of first bending down the\r\nleaves we had no opportunity to observe; but we saw thousands uniting\r\nall their strength to hold them in this position, while other busy\r\nmultitudes were employed within in applying this gluten that was to\r\nprevent their returning back. To satisfy ourselves that the leaves\r\nwere bent and held down by the efforts of these diminutive artificers,\r\nwe disturbed them in their work; and as soon as they were driven from\r\ntheir stations, the leaves on which they were employed sprang up with\r\na force much greater than we could have thought them able to conquer\r\nby any combination of their strength. But, though we gratified our\r\ncuriosity at their expense, the injury did not go unrevenged; for\r\nthousands immediately threw themselves upon us, and gave us intolerable\r\npain with their stings, especially those which took possession of our\r\nnecks and hair, from whence they were not easily driven. Their sting\r\nwas scarcely less painful than that of a bee; but, except it was\r\nrepeated, the pain did not last more than a minute.\r\n\r\n\"Another sort are quite black, and their operation and manner of life\r\nare not less extraordinary. Their habitations are the inside of the\r\nbranches of a tree, which they contrive to excavate by working out\r\nthe pith almost to the extremity of the slenderest twig, the tree at\r\nthe same time flourishing as if it had no such inmate. When we first\r\nfound the tree we gathered some of the branches, and were scarcely\r\nless astonished than we should have been to find that we had profaned\r\na consecrated grove, where every tree, upon being wounded, gave signs\r\nof life; for we were instantly covered with legions of these animals,\r\nswarming from every broken bough, and inflicting their stings with\r\nincessant violence.\r\n\r\n\"A third kind we found nested in the root of a plant, which grows\r\non the bark of trees in the manner of mistletoe, and which they\r\nhad perforated for that use. This root is commonly as big as a\r\nlarge turnip, and sometimes much bigger. When we cut it we found it\r\nintersected by innumerable winding passages, all filled with these\r\nanimals, by which, however, the vegetation of the plant did not appear\r\nto have suffered any injury. We never cut one of these roots that\r\nwas not inhabited, though some were not bigger than a hazel-nut. The\r\nanimals themselves are very small, not more than half as big as the\r\ncommon red ant in England. They had stings, but scarcely force enough\r\nto make them felt: they had, however, a power of tormenting us in an\r\nequal, if not in a greater degree; for the moment we handled the root,\r\nthey swarmed from innumerable holes, and running about those parts of\r\nthe body that were uncovered, produced a titillation more intolerable\r\nthan pain, except it is increased to great violence.\"[DG]\r\n\r\nThe species called sugar-ants in the West Indies are particularly\r\ndestructive to the sugar-cane, as well as to lime, lemon, and\r\norange-trees, by excavating their nests at the roots, and so loosening\r\nthe earth that they are frequently uprooted and blown down by the\r\nwinds. If this does not happen, the roots are deprived of due\r\nnourishment, and the plants become sickly and die.[DH]\r\n\r\n[One or two examples of foreign ants are well worthy of notice. The\r\nfirst of them is an insect whose habits bear strongly upon the familiar\r\npassage in Proverbs, ch. vi. v. 6:--\r\n\r\n    \"Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:\r\n    Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,\r\n    Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.\"\r\n\r\nThis passage is one that has been often mentioned as a proof that the\r\nBible is not to be implicitly trusted. Judging from all the species of\r\nants known to entomologists, some writers argue that the author of the\r\nproverb in question was ignorant of the real history of the ant, and\r\nwas taking up a popular fallacy.\r\n\r\n[Still, although the ants of the old world are chiefly carnivorous, or\r\nfeed on soft substances, and in consequence have not the least idea\r\nof hoarding food for the winter, there is one species of Brazilian\r\nant which absolutely builds houses, prepares ground, sows seed, reaps\r\nthe grain, and stores it away for future consumption. It is the\r\nAgricultural Ant, _Atta malefaciens_, first described by Dr. Lincecum,\r\nwho watched the insect for twelve years before publishing an account\r\nthat he knew would at first be received with incredulity. The following\r\nabstract of his paper appeared in the Journal of the Linnæan Society.\r\n\r\n\"The species which I have named 'Agricultural' is a large brownish\r\nant. It dwells in what may be termed paved cities, and like a thrifty,\r\ndiligent, provident farmer, makes suitable and timely arrangements for\r\nthe changing seasons. It is, in short, endowed with skill, ingenuity,\r\nand untiring patience, sufficient to enable it successfully to contend\r\nwith the varying exigencies which it may have to encounter in the life\r\nconflict.\r\n\r\n\"When it has selected a situation for its habitation, if on ordinary\r\ndry ground, it bores a hole, around which it raises the surface three\r\nand sometimes six inches, forming a low circular mound, having a very\r\ngentle inclination from the centre to the outer border, which on an\r\naverage is three or four feet from the entrance. But if the location is\r\nchosen on low, flat, wet land, liable to inundation, though the ground\r\nmay be perfectly dry at the time the ant sets to work, it nevertheless\r\nelevates the mound, in the form of a pretty sharp cone, to the height\r\nof fifteen or twenty inches or more, and makes the entrance near the\r\nsummit. Around the mound, in either case, the ant clears the ground\r\nof all obstructions, and levels and marks the surface to the distance\r\nof three or four feet from the gate of the city, giving the space the\r\nappearance of a handsome pavement, as it really is.\r\n\r\n\"Within this paved area not a blade of any green thing is allowed to\r\ngrow, except a single species of grain-bearing grass. Having planted\r\nthis crop in a circle around, and two or three feet from the centre\r\nof the mound, the insect tends and cultivates it with constant care,\r\ncutting away all other grasses and weeds that may spring up amongst it,\r\nand all around outside the farm circle to the extent of one or two feet\r\nmore. The cultivated grass grows luxuriantly, and produces a heavy crop\r\nof small, white, flinty seeds, which under the microscope very closely\r\nresemble ordinary rice. When ripe, it is carefully harvested and\r\ncarried by the workers, chaff and all, into the granary cells, where it\r\nis divested of the chaff and packed away. The chaff is taken out and\r\nthrown beyond the limits of the paved area.\r\n\r\n\"During protracted wet weather it sometimes happens that the\r\nprovision-stores become damp, and are liable to sprout and spoil. In\r\nthis case, on the first fine day, the ants bring out the damp and\r\ndamaged grain, and expose it to the sun till it is dry, when they carry\r\nit back and pack away all the sound seeds, leaving those that had\r\nsprouted to waste.\r\n\r\n\"In a peach orchard not far from my house is a considerable elevation,\r\non which is an extensive bed of rock. In the sand-beds overlying\r\nportions of this rock are five cities of the agricultural ants,\r\nevidently very ancient. My observations on their manners and customs\r\nhave been limited to the last twelve years, during which time the\r\ninclosure surrounding the orchard has prevented the approach of cattle\r\nto the ant-farms. The cities which are outside the inclosure, as well\r\nas those protected in it, are at the proper season invariably planted\r\nwith the ant-rice. The crop may accordingly always be seen springing up\r\nwithin the circle about the 1st of November every year. Of late years,\r\nhowever, since the number of farms and cattle has greatly increased,\r\nand the latter are eating off the grass much closer than formerly, thus\r\npreventing the ripening of the seeds, I notice that the agricultural\r\nant is placing its cities along the turn-rows in the fields, walks in\r\ngardens, inside about the gates, &c., where they can cultivate their\r\nfarms without molestation from the cattle.\r\n\r\n\"There can be no doubt that the particular species of grain-bearing\r\ngrass mentioned above is intentionally planted. In farmer-like manner\r\nthe ground upon which it stands is carefully divested of all other\r\ngrasses and weeds during the time it is growing. When it is ripe, the\r\ngrain is taken care of, the dry stubble cut away and carried off, the\r\npaved area being left unencumbered until the ensuing autumn, when the\r\nsame ant-rice reappears within the same circle, and receives the same\r\nagricultural attention as was bestowed upon the previous crop--and so\r\non, year after year, as I _know_ to be the case, in all situations\r\nwhere the ants' settlements are protected from granivorous animals.\"\r\n\r\nThis interesting account is simply the result of twelve years' patient\r\ninvestigation on the part of Dr. Lincecum, who took special care not to\r\ninvent a theory and to twist facts in accordance with it, but watched\r\nthe entire proceedings of the insects for a series of years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Crematogaster.]\r\n\r\nThe preceding illustration represents the rather remarkable nest of\r\nan Australian ant, belonging to the genus Crematogaster. This word\r\nsignifies \"hanging-belly,\" and the name has been applied to the ant in\r\nconsequence of the manner in which its abdomen is held up in the air,\r\nso that it overhangs the back.\r\n\r\nAs may be seen, the nest is of considerable size, and might from its\r\nexternal appearance be mistaken for that of a wasp. The interior of it,\r\nhowever, is even more elaborate, being full of little covered passages\r\ninterlacing with each other in a most intricate manner, but all leading\r\nto the internal galleries.\r\n\r\nThe two nests which are shown in the next illustration are, if\r\npossible, still more remarkable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe upper one is found in Cayenne, and is made by an insect called the\r\nfungus ant (_Polyrachis bispinosa_), because the nest looks as if it\r\nwere made of fungus. It is not, however, composed of that material,\r\nbut of the fibre of the cotton-tree (_Bombax ceiba_).\r\n\r\nThe fibre is in itself very short, barely exceeding an inch in length,\r\nbut it is cut very much shorter by the ant, who contrives to felt it\r\ntogether in a most curious manner, so that it is hardly possible to\r\ntrace the course of any one fibre. The size of the nest is, on an\r\naverage, about eight or nine inches in diameter. The insect itself is\r\ngiven in the preceding illustration, but very much enlarged. If the\r\nreader will look at the centre of the body, he will see the projections\r\nwhich have given it the name of _bispinosa_, or two-spined.\r\n\r\nThe lower figure represents the nest of another species of ant\r\nbelonging to the same genus, and called scientifically, _Polyrachis\r\ntextor_. The nest is most ingeniously made of little pieces of wood and\r\ntendrils, put together so as to form a kind of open net-work, through\r\nwhich the interior of the nest is plainly visible. This insect inhabits\r\nMalacca.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XVI_.\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURES OF WHITE ANTS, OR TERMITES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we look back upon the details which we have given of the industry\r\nand ingenuity of numerous tribes of insects, both solitary and social,\r\nwe are induced to think it almost impossible that they could be\r\nsurpassed. The structures of wasps and bees, and still more those of\r\nthe wood-ant (_Formica rufa_), when placed in comparison with the size\r\nof the insects, equal our largest cities compared with the stature\r\nof man. But when we look at the buildings erected by the white ants\r\nof tropical climates, all that we have been surveying dwindles into\r\ninsignificance. Their industry appears greatly to surpass that of our\r\nants and bees, and they are certainly more skilful in architectural\r\ncontrivances. The elevation, also, of their edifices is more than\r\nfive hundred times the height of the builders. Were our houses built\r\naccording to the same proportions, they would be twelve or fifteen\r\ntimes higher than the London Monument, and four or five times higher\r\nthan the pyramids of Egypt, with corresponding dimensions in the\r\nbasements of the edifices. These statements are, perhaps, necessary to\r\nimpress the extraordinary labours of ants upon the mind; for we are\r\nall more or less sensible to the force of comparisons. The analogies\r\nbetween the works of insects and of men are not perfect; for insects\r\nare all provided with instruments peculiarly adapted to the end which\r\nthey instinctively seek, while man has to form a plan by progressive\r\nthought, and upon the experience of others, and to complete it with\r\ntools which he also invents.\r\n\r\nThe termites do not stand above a quarter of an inch high, while their\r\nnests are frequently twelve feet, and Jobson mentions some which he had\r\nseen as high as twenty feet; \"of compass,\" he adds, \"to contain a dozen\r\nmen, with the heat of the sun baked into that hardness, that we used\r\nto hide ourselves in the ragged tops of them when we took up stands to\r\nshoot at deer or wild beasts.\"[DI] Bishop Heber saw a number of these\r\nhigh ant-hills in India, near the principal entrance of the Sooty or\r\nMoorshedabad river. \"Many of them,\" he says, \"were five or six feet\r\nhigh, and probably seven or eight feet in circumference at the base,\r\npartially overgrown with grass and ivy, and looking at a distance like\r\nthe stumps of decayed trees. I think it is Ctesias, among the Greek\r\nwriters, who gives an account alluded to by Lucian in his 'Cock,' of\r\nmonstrous ants in India, as large as foxes. The falsehood probably\r\noriginated in the stupendous fabrics which they rear here, and which\r\ncertainly might be supposed to be the work of a much larger animal\r\nthan their real architect.\"[DJ] Herodotus has a similar fable of the\r\nenormous size and brilliant appearance of the ants of India.\r\n\r\nNor is it only in constructing dwellings for themselves that the\r\ntermites of Africa and of other hot climates employ their masonic\r\nskill. Though, like our ants and wasps, they are almost omnivorous, yet\r\nwood, particularly when felled and dry, seems their favourite article\r\nof food; but they have an utter aversion to feeding in the light, and\r\nalways eat their way with all expedition to the interior. It thence\r\nwould seem necessary for them either to leave the bark of a tree, or\r\nthe outer portion of the beam or door of a house, undevoured, or to eat\r\nin open day. They do neither; but are at the trouble of constructing\r\ngalleries of clay, in which they can conceal themselves, and feed in\r\nsecurity. In all their foraging excursions, indeed, they build covert\r\nways, by which they can go out and return to their encampment.[DK]\r\n\r\nOthers of the species (for there are several), instead of building\r\ngalleries, exercise the art of miners, and make their approaches under\r\nground, penetrating beneath the foundation of houses or areas, and\r\nrising again either through the floors, or by entering the bottom of\r\nthe posts that support the building, when they follow the course of\r\nthe fibres, and make their way to the top, boring holes and cavities\r\nin different places as they proceed. Multitudes enter the roof, and\r\nintersect it with pipes or galleries, formed of wet clay, which serve\r\nfor passages in all directions, and enable them more readily to fix\r\ntheir habitations in it. They prefer the softer woods, such as pine\r\nand fir, which they hollow out with such nicety, that they leave the\r\nsurface whole, after having eaten away the inside. A shelf or plank\r\nattacked in this manner looks solid to the eye, when, if weighed, it\r\nwill not out-balance two sheets of pasteboard of the same dimensions.\r\nIt sometimes happens that they carry this operation so far on stakes\r\nin the open air, as to render the bark too flexible for their purpose;\r\nwhen they remedy the defect by plastering the whole stick with a sort\r\nof mortar which they make with clay, so that, on being struck, the form\r\nvanishes, and the artificial covering falls in fragments on the ground.\r\nIn the woods, when a large tree falls from age or accident, they enter\r\nit on the side next the ground, and devour it at leisure, till little\r\nmore than the bark is left. But in this case they take no precaution of\r\nstrengthening the outward defence, but leave it in such a state as to\r\ndeceive an eye unaccustomed to see trees thus gutted of their insides:\r\nand \"you may as well,\" says Mr. Smeathman, \"step upon a cloud.\" It is\r\nan extraordinary fact, that when these creatures have formed pipes in\r\nthe roof of a house, instinct directs them to prevent its fall, which\r\nwould ensue from their having sapped the posts on which it rests; but\r\nas they gnaw away the wood, they fill up the interstices with clay,\r\ntempered to a surprising degree of hardness, so that, when the house\r\nis pulled down, these posts are transformed from wood to stone. They\r\nmake the walls of their galleries of the same composition as their\r\nnests, varying the materials according to their kind; one species using\r\nthe red clay, another black clay, and the third a woody substance,\r\ncemented with gums, as a security from the attacks of their enemies,\r\nparticularly the common ant, which, being defended by a strong, horny\r\nshell, is more than a match for them, and when it can get at them,\r\nrapaciously seizes them, and drags them to its nest for food for its\r\nyoung brood. If any accident breaks down part of their walls, they\r\nrepair the breach with all speed. Instinct guides them to perform their\r\noffice in the creation, by mostly confining their attacks to trees that\r\nare beginning to decay, or such timber as has been severed from its\r\nroots for use, and would decay in time. Vigorous, healthy trees do not\r\nrequire to be destroyed, and accordingly, these consumers have no taste\r\nfor them.[DL]\r\n\r\nM. Adanson describes the termites of Senegal as constructing covert\r\nways along the surface of wood which they intend to attack; but though\r\nwe have no reason to distrust so excellent a naturalist, in describing\r\nwhat he saw, it is certain that they more commonly eat their way into\r\nthe interior of the wood, and afterwards form the galleries, when they\r\nfind that they have destroyed the wood till it will no longer afford\r\nthem protection.\r\n\r\nBut it is time that we should come to their principal building, which\r\nmay, with some propriety, be called a city; and, according to the\r\nmethod we have followed in other instances, we shall trace their\r\nlabours from the commencement. We shall begin with the operations of\r\nthe species which may be appropriately termed the Warrior (_Termes\r\nfatalis_, Linn.; _T. bellicosus_, Smeath.).\r\n\r\nWe must premise, that though they have been termed white _ants_, they\r\ndo not belong to the same order of insects with our ants; yet they\r\nhave a slight resemblance to ants in their form, but more in their\r\neconomy. Smeathman, to whom we owe our chief knowledge of the genus,\r\ndescribes them as consisting of kings, queens, soldiers, and workers,\r\nand is of opinion that the workers are larvæ, the soldiers nymphæ, and\r\nthe kings and queens the perfect insects. In this opinion he coincides\r\nwith Sparrmann[DM] and others; but Latreille is inclined to think,\r\nfrom what he observed in a European species (_Termes lucifugus_) found\r\nnear Bordeaux, that the soldiers form a distinct race, like the neuter\r\nworkers among bees and ants, while the working termites are larvæ,[DN]\r\nwhich are furnished with strong mandibles for gnawing; when they become\r\nnymphs, the rudiments of four wings appear, which are fully developed\r\nin the perfect insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Termes bellicosus in the winged state.]\r\n\r\n[It is now known that the differences of form among the termites are\r\naccounted for as follows. The winged specimens are the fully developed\r\nmales and females, popularly called kings and queens. These crawl to\r\nthe aperture of their house and take flight, retiring to earth after\r\na short time. When a male and female meet each other, they cast off\r\ntheir wings exactly as do the ants of our own country, and become the\r\nfounders of a new colony. Their soldiers are undeveloped males, and the\r\nworkers are undeveloped females.]\r\n\r\nIn the winged state, they migrate to form new colonies, but the greater\r\nnumber of them perish in a few hours, or become the prey of birds, and\r\neven of the natives, who fry them as delicacies. \"I have discoursed\r\nwith several gentlemen,\" says Smeathman, \"upon the taste of the white\r\nants, and on comparing notes, we have always agreed that they are most\r\ndelicious and delicate eating. One gentleman compared them to sugared\r\nmarrow, another to sugared cream and a paste of sweet almonds.\"[DO]\r\n\r\nMr. Smeathman's very interesting paper affords us the most authentic\r\nmaterials for the further description of these wonderful insects; and\r\nwe therefore continue partly to extract from, and partly to abridge,\r\nhis account.\r\n\r\nThe few pairs that are so fortunate as to survive the various\r\ncasualties that assail them, are usually found by workers (larvæ),\r\nwhich, at this season, are running continually on the surface of the\r\nground, on the watch for them. As soon as they discover the objects\r\nof their search, they begin to protect them from their surrounding\r\nenemies, by inclosing them in a small chamber of clay, where they\r\nbecome the parents of a new community, and are distinguished from the\r\nother inhabitants of the nest by the title of king and queen. Instinct\r\ndirects the attention of these labouring insects to the preservation\r\nof their race, in the protection of this pair and their offspring.\r\nThe chamber that forms the rudiment of a new nest is contrived for\r\ntheir safety, but the entrances to it are too small to admit of their\r\never leaving it; consequently, the charge of the eggs devolves upon\r\nthe labourers, who construct nurseries for their reception. These are\r\nsmall, irregularly-shaped chambers, placed at first round the apartment\r\nof the king and queen, and not exceeding the size of a hazel-nut; but\r\nin nests of long standing they are of great comparative magnitude, and\r\ndistributed at a greater distance. The receptacles for hatching the\r\nyoung are all composed of wooden materials, apparently joined together\r\nwith gum, and, by way of defence, cased with clay. The chamber that\r\ncontains the king and queen is nearly on a level with the surface of\r\nthe ground; and as the other apartments are formed about it, it is\r\ngenerally situated at an equal distance from the sides of the nest,\r\nand directly beneath its conical point. Those apartments which consist\r\nof nurseries and magazines of provisions, form an intricate labyrinth,\r\nbeing separated by small, empty chambers and galleries, which surround\r\nthem, or afford a communication from one to another. This labyrinth\r\nextends on all sides to the outward shells, and reaches up within it\r\nto two-thirds or more of its height, leaving an open area above, in\r\nthe middle, under the dome, which reminds the spectator of the nave of\r\nan old cathedral. Around this are raised three or four large arches,\r\nwhich are sometimes two or three feet high, next the front of the area,\r\nbut diminish as they recede further back, and are lost amidst the\r\ninnumerable chambers and nurseries behind them.\r\n\r\nEvery one of these buildings consists of two distinct parts, the\r\nexterior and the interior. The exterior is one large shell, in the\r\nmanner of a dome, large and strong enough to inclose and shelter the\r\ninterior from the vicissitudes of the weather, and the inhabitants from\r\nthe attacks of natural or accidental enemies. It is always, therefore,\r\nmuch stronger than the interior building, which is the habitable part,\r\ndivided, with a wonderful kind of regularity and contrivance, into an\r\namazing number of apartments for the residence of the king and queen,\r\nand the nursing of the numerous progeny; or for magazines, which are\r\nalways found well filled with stores and provisions. The hills make\r\ntheir first appearance above ground by a little turret or two, in the\r\nshape of sugar-loaves, which are run a foot high or more. Soon after,\r\nat some little distance, while the former are increasing in height and\r\nsize, they raise others, and so go on increasing their number, and\r\nwidening them at the base, till their works below are covered with\r\nthese turrets, of which they always raise the highest and largest\r\nin the middle, and by filling up the intervals between each turret,\r\ncollect them into one dome. They are not very curious or exact in the\r\nworkmanship, except in making them very solid and strong; and when,\r\nby their joining them, the dome is completed, for which purpose the\r\nturrets answer as scaffolds, they take away the middle ones entirely,\r\nexcept the tops, which, joined together, make the crown of the cupola,\r\nand apply the clay to the building of the works within, or to erecting\r\nfresh turrets for the purpose of raising the hillock still higher; so\r\nthat some part of the clay is probably used several times, like the\r\nboards and posts of a mason's scaffold.\r\n\r\nWhen these hills are little more than half their height, it is a common\r\npractice of the wild bulls to stand as sentinels on them, while the\r\nrest of the herd are ruminating below. They are sufficiently strong\r\nfor that purpose, and at their full height answer excellently well as\r\nplaces of look-out; and Mr. Smeathman has been, with four more, on\r\nthe top of one of these hillocks, to watch for a vessel in sight. The\r\noutward shell, or dome, is not only of use to protect and support the\r\ninterior buildings from external violence and the heavy rains, but\r\nto collect and preserve a regular degree of the warmth and moisture\r\nnecessary for hatching the eggs and cherishing the young. The royal\r\nchamber occupied by the king and queen appears to be, in the opinion\r\nof this little people, of the most consequence, being always situated\r\nas near the centre of the interior building as possible. It is always\r\nnearly in the shape of half an egg, or an obtuse oval, within, and may\r\nbe supposed to represent a long oven. In the infant state of the colony\r\nit is but about an inch in length; but in time will be increased to\r\nsix or eight inches, or more, in the clear, being always in proportion\r\nto the size of the queen, who, increasing in bulk as in age, at length\r\nrequires a chamber of such dimensions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Queen distended with Eggs.]\r\n\r\nIts floor is perfectly horizontal, and in large hillocks, sometimes\r\nmore than an inch thick of solid clay. The roof, also, which is one\r\nsolid and well-turned oval arch, is generally of about the same\r\nsolidity; but in some places it is not a quarter of an inch thick on\r\nthe sides where it joins the floor, and where the doors or entrances\r\nare made level with it, at nearly equal distances from each other.\r\nThese entrances will not admit any animal larger than the soldiers or\r\nlabourers; so that the king and the queen (who is, at full size, a\r\nthousand times the weight of a king) can never possibly go out, but\r\nremain close prisoners.\r\n\r\n[There is a good series of the queen cells of the Termite in the\r\nBritish Museum, and the reader is strongly recommended to go and\r\nexamine them. Some of them are as large as cocoa-nuts. Around the\r\ncell are a number of small holes, looking as if they had been bored\r\nwith a bradawl. Now, if the cell be carefully opened, a most curious\r\narrangement will be seen. Each of the little holes serves as an opening\r\ninto a passage which communicates with the interior of the cell. The\r\napartment, if we may so call it, which contains the queen, is only\r\njust large enough to hold her, and there is no door or opening for her\r\negress. This, however, is not required, as her enormous size prevents\r\nher from moving. Through these passages runs incessantly a stream of\r\nworker termites, some of them carrying eggs which the queen has just\r\nlaid, and others returning to the royal chamber for a fresh supply.]\r\n\r\nThe royal chamber, if in a large hillock, is surrounded by a countless\r\nnumber of others, of different sizes, shapes, and dimensions; but all\r\nof them arched in one way or another--sometimes elliptical or oval.\r\nThese either open into each other, or communicate by passages as wide\r\nas, and are evidently made for, the soldiers and attendants, of whom\r\ngreat numbers are necessary, and always in waiting. These apartments\r\nare joined by the magazines and nurseries. The former are chambers of\r\nclay, and are always well filled with provisions, which, to the naked\r\neye, seem to consist of the raspings of wood, and plants which the\r\ntermites destroy, but are found by the microscope to be principally\r\nthe gums or inspissated juices of plants. These are thrown together in\r\nlittle masses, some of which are finer than others, and resemble the\r\nsugar about preserved fruits; others are like tears of gum, one quite\r\ntransparent, another like amber, a third brown, and a fourth quite\r\nopaque, as we see often in parcels of ordinary gums. These magazines\r\nare intermixed with the nurseries, which are buildings totally\r\ndifferent from the rest of the apartments; for these are composed\r\nentirely of wooden materials, seemingly joined together with gums. Mr.\r\nSmeathman calls them the nurseries because they are invariably occupied\r\nby the eggs and young ones, which appear at first in the shape of\r\nlabourers, but white as snow. These buildings are exceedingly compact,\r\nand divided into many very small irregular-shaped chambers, not one\r\nof which is to be found of half an inch in width. They are placed all\r\nround, and as near as possible to the royal apartments.\r\n\r\nWhen the nest is in the infant state, the nurseries are close to the\r\nroyal chambers; but as, in process of time, the queen enlarges, it is\r\nnecessary to enlarge the chamber for her accommodation; and as she\r\nthen lays a greater number of eggs, and requires a greater number of\r\nattendants, so it is necessary to enlarge and increase the number of\r\nthe adjacent apartments; for which purpose the small nurseries which\r\nare first built are taken to pieces, rebuilt a little further of a size\r\nlarger, and the number of them increased at the same time. Thus they\r\ncontinually enlarge their apartments, pull down, repair, or rebuild,\r\naccording to their wants, with a degree of sagacity, regularity, and\r\nforesight, not even imitated by any other kind of animals or insects.\r\n\r\nAll these chambers, and the passages leading to and from them, being\r\narched, they help to support each other; and while the interior large\r\narches prevent them from falling into the centre, and keep the area\r\nopen, the exterior building supports them on the outside. There are,\r\ncomparatively speaking, few openings into the great area, and they,\r\nfor the most part, seem intended only to admit into the nurseries\r\nthat genial warmth which the dome collects. The interior building, or\r\nassemblage of nurseries, chambers, &c., has a flattish top or roof,\r\nwithout any perforation, which would keep the apartments below dry, in\r\ncase through accident the dome should receive any injury, and let in\r\nwater; and it is never exactly flat and uniform, because the insects\r\nare always adding to it by building more chambers and nurseries; so\r\nthat the division or columns between the future arched apartment\r\nresemble the pinnacles on the fronts of some old buildings, and demand\r\nparticular notice, as affording one proof that for the most part the\r\ninsects project their arches, and do not make them by excavation. The\r\narea has also a flattish floor, which lies over the royal chamber,\r\nbut sometimes a good height above it, having nurseries and magazines\r\nbetween. It is likewise waterproof, and contrived to let the water\r\noff if it should get in, and run over by some short way into the\r\nsubterraneous passages, which run under the lowest apartments in the\r\nhill in various directions, and are of an astonishing size, being\r\nwider than the bore of a great cannon. One that Mr. Smeathman measured\r\nwas perfectly cylindrical, and thirteen inches in diameter. These\r\nsubterraneous passages, or galleries, are lined very thick with the\r\nsame kind of clay of which the hill is composed, and ascend the inside\r\nof the outward shell in a spiral manner; and winding round the whole\r\nbuilding up to the top, intersect each other at different heights,\r\nopening either immediately in the dome in various places, and into the\r\ninterior building, the new turrets, &c., or communicating with them by\r\nother galleries of different diameters, either circular or oval.\r\n\r\nFrom every part of these large galleries are various small covert\r\nways, or galleries leading to different parts of the building. Under\r\nground there are a great many that lead downward by sloping descents,\r\nthree and four feet perpendicular among the gravel, whence the workers\r\ncull the finer parts, which, being kneaded up in their mouths to the\r\nconsistence of mortar, become that solid clay or stone of which their\r\nhills and all their buildings, except their nurseries, are composed.\r\nOther galleries again ascend, and lead out horizontally on every side,\r\nand are carried under ground near to the surface a vast distance: for\r\nif all the nests are destroyed within a hundred yards of a house, the\r\ninhabitants of those which are left unmolested farther off will still\r\ncarry on their subterraneous galleries, and, invading it by sap and\r\nmine, do great mischief to the goods and merchandise contained in it.\r\n\r\nIt seems there is a degree of necessity for the galleries under the\r\nhills being thus large, since they are the great thoroughfares for\r\nall the labourers and soldiers going forth or returning, whether\r\nfetching clay, wood, water, or provisions; and they are certainly well\r\ncalculated for the purposes to which they are applied by the spiral\r\nslope which is given them; for if they were perpendicular the labourers\r\nwould not be able to carry on their building with so much facility, as\r\nthey ascend a perpendicular with great difficulty, and the soldiers can\r\nscarcely do it at all. It is on this account that sometimes a road like\r\na ledge is made on the perpendicular side of any part of the building\r\nwithin their hill, which is flat on the upper surface and half an inch\r\nwide, and ascends gradually like a staircase, or like those winding\r\nroads which are cut on the sides of hills and mountains, that would\r\notherwise be inaccessible; by which and similar contrivances they\r\ntravel with great facility to every interior part.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _a_, A covered way and nest, on the branch of a tree, of\r\nthe _Termites arborum_. _b_, Section of the Hill-nest of the _Termites\r\nbellicosi_, to show the interior. _c_, Hill-nest of the _Termites\r\nbellicosi_, entire.]\r\n\r\nThis, too, is probably the cause of their building a kind of bridge\r\nof one great arch, which answers the purpose of a flight of stairs\r\nfrom the floor of the area to some opening on the side of one of the\r\ncolumns that support the great arches. This contrivance must shorten\r\nthe distance exceedingly to those labourers who have the eggs to carry\r\nfrom the royal chamber to some of the upper nurseries, which in some\r\nhills would be four or five feet in the straightest line, and much more\r\nif carried through all the winding passages leading through the inner\r\nchambers and apartments. Mr. Smeathman found one of these bridges, half\r\nan inch broad, a quarter of an inch thick, and ten inches long, making\r\nthe side of an elliptic arch of proportionable size; so that it is\r\nwonderful it did not fall over or break by its own weight before they\r\ngot it joined to the side of the column above.\r\n\r\nIt was strengthened by a small arch at the bottom, and had a hollow or\r\ngroove all the length of the upper surface, either made purposely for\r\nthe inhabitants to travel over with more safety, or else, which is not\r\nimprobable, worn by frequent treading.\r\n\r\n\r\nTurret-building White Ants.\r\n\r\nApparently more than one species smaller than the preceding, such\r\nas the _Termes mordax_ and _T. atrox_ of Smeathman, construct nests\r\nof a very different form, the figures of which resemble a pillar,\r\nwith a large mushroom for a capital. These turrets are composed of\r\nwell-tempered black earth, and stand nearly three feet high. The\r\nconical mushroom-shaped roof is composed of the same material, and\r\nthe brims hang over the column, being three or four inches wider than\r\nits perpendicular sides. Most of them, says Smeathman, resemble in\r\nshape the body of a round windmill, but some of the roofs have little\r\nelevation in the middle. When one of these turrets is completed, the\r\ninsects do not afterwards enlarge or alter it; but if it be found too\r\nsmall for them, they lay the foundation of another at a few inches'\r\ndistance. They sometimes, but not often, begin the second before the\r\nfirst is finished, and a third before they have completed the second.\r\nFive or six of these singular turrets in a group may be seen in the\r\nthick woods at the foot of a tree. They are so very strongly built,\r\nthat in case of violence, they will sooner tear up the gravel and\r\nsolid heart of their foundation than break in the middle. When any of\r\nthem happen to be thus thrown down, the insects do not abandon them;\r\nbut, using their overturned column as a basis, they run up another\r\nperpendicularly from it to the usual height, fastening the under part\r\nat the same time to the ground, to render it the more secure.\r\n\r\nThe interior of a turret is pretty equally divided into innumerable\r\ncells, irregular in shape, but usually more or less angular, generally\r\nquadrangular or pentagonal, though the angles are not well defined.\r\nEach shell has at least two entrances; but there are no galleries,\r\narches, nor wooden nurseries, as in the nests of the warrior (_T.\r\nbellicosus_). The two species which build turret nests are very\r\ndifferent in size, and the dimensions of the nests differ in proportion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Turret Nests of White Ants. One nest is represented cut\r\nthrough, with the upper part lying on the ground.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe White Ants of Trees.\r\n\r\nLatreille's species of white ant (_Termes lucifugus_, Rossi), formerly\r\nmentioned as found in the south of Europe, appear to have more the\r\nhabits of the jet-ant, described page 301, than their congeners of the\r\ntropics. They live in the interior of the trunks of trees, the wood\r\nof which they eat, and form their habitations of the galleries which\r\nthey thus excavate. M. Latreille says they appear to be furnished with\r\nan acid for the purpose of softening the wood, the odour of which\r\nis exceedingly pungent. They prefer the part of the wood nearest to\r\nthe bark, which they are careful not to injure, as it affords them\r\nprotection. All the walls of their galleries are moistened with small\r\nglobules of a gelatinous substance, similar to gum Arabic. They are\r\nchiefly to be found in the trunks of oak and pine trees, and are very\r\nnumerous.[DP]\r\n\r\nAnother of the species (_Termes arborum_), described by Smeathman,\r\nbuilds a nest on the exterior of trees, altogether different from any\r\nof the preceding. These are of a spherical or oval shape, occupying\r\nthe arm or branch of a tree sometimes from seventy to eighty feet\r\nfrom the ground, and as large, in a few instances, as a sugar-cask.\r\nThe composition used for a building material is apparently similar\r\nto that used by the warriors for constructing their nurseries, being\r\nthe gnawings of wood in very small particles, kneaded into a paste\r\nwith some species of cement or glue, procured, as Smeathman supposes,\r\npartly from gummiferous trees, and partly from themselves; but it is\r\nmore probable, we think, that it is wholly secreted, like the wax of\r\nbees, by the insects themselves. With this cement, whatever may be its\r\ncomposition, they construct their cells, in which there is nothing\r\nvery wonderful except their great numbers. They are very firmly built,\r\nand so strongly attached to the trees, that they will resist the most\r\nviolent tornado. It is impossible, indeed, to detach them, except by\r\ncutting them in pieces, or sawing off the branch, which is frequently\r\ndone to procure the insects for young turkeys. (See engraving, p. 324,\r\nfor a figure of this nest.)\r\n\r\nThis species very often, instead of selecting the bough of a tree,\r\nbuilds in the roof or wall of a house, and unless observed in time,\r\nand expelled, occasions considerable damage. It is easier, in fact,\r\nto shut one's door against a fox or a thief, than to exclude such\r\ninsidious enemies, whose aversion to light renders it difficult to\r\ntrace them even when they are numerous.\r\n\r\n[There are also termites in Europe, and the city of La Rochelle has\r\nsuffered terribly from them. They eat the trees in the gardens, and\r\nnot a stake can be driven into the ground, or even a plank left for\r\ntwenty-four hours, without being attacked. They also enter the houses\r\nand utterly ruin them by eating every bit of timber that is used in\r\nthem. In one instance, where a room had been repaired, the stalactitic\r\ngalleries of the termites showed themselves the very day after the\r\nworkmen had left the room.\r\n\r\nThey invaded the prefecture, and did exceeding damage, one of their\r\nfeats of voracity being so extraordinary as to deserve mention. The\r\narchives of the department were left in boxes, and privately inspected.\r\nOne day, when a paper was needed, the whole of the documents fell to\r\npieces, and were metamorphosed as if by magic into a heap of clay. The\r\ntermites had got into the boxes by boring through the wainscot of the\r\nroom, and had then penetrated among the papers. They consumed every\r\nparticle of them except the uppermost sheet and the edges, supplying\r\ntheir place with clay. The consequence was, that although the heap of\r\ndocuments seemed to be correct, there was nothing but a mass of clay\r\ngalleries and a single sheet of paper at the top.\r\n\r\nSo voracious are they, that even a piece of paper wrapped round a\r\nbottle was eaten, the termites building a gallery of clay in order to\r\nreach it under cover.]\r\n\r\nIf we reflect on the prodigious numbers of those insects, and their\r\npower and rapidity of destroying, we cannot but admire the wisdom\r\nof Providence in creating so indefatigable and useful an agent\r\nin countries where the decay of vegetable substances is rapid in\r\nproportion to the heat of the climate. We have already remarked that\r\nthey always prefer decaying or dead timber; and it is indeed a very\r\ngeneral law among insects which feed on wood to prefer what is\r\nunsound; the same principle holds with respect to fungi, lichens, and\r\nother parasitical plants.\r\n\r\nAll the species of Termites are not social; but the solitary ones do\r\nnot, like their congeners, distinguish themselves in architecture. In\r\nother respects, their habits are more similar; for they destroy almost\r\nevery substance, animal and vegetable. The most common of the solitary\r\nspecies must be familiar to all our readers by the name of wood-louse\r\n(_Termes pulsatorium_, Linn.; _Atropos lignarius_, Leach)--one of\r\nthe insects which produces the ticking superstitiously termed the\r\n_death-watch_. It is not so large as the common wood-louse, but whiter\r\nand more slender, having a red mouth and yellow eyes. It lives in old\r\nbooks, the paper on walls, collections of insects and dried plants,\r\nand is extremely agile in its movements, darting, by jerks, into\r\ndark corners for the purpose of concealment. It does not like to run\r\nstraight forward without resting every half-second, as if to listen\r\nor look about for its pursuer, and at such resting times it is easily\r\ntaken. The ticking noise is made by the insect beating against the\r\nwood with its head, and it is supposed by some to be peculiar to the\r\nfemale, and to be connected with the laying of her eggs. M. Latreille,\r\nhowever, thinks that the wood-louse is only the grub of the _Psocus\r\nabdominalis_, in which case it could not lay eggs; but this opinion is\r\nsomewhat questionable. Another death-watch is a small beetle (_Anobium\r\ntesselatum_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XVII._\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURES OF SILK SPUN BY CATERPILLARS, INCLUDING THE SILK-WORM.\r\n\r\n        \"Millions of spinning-worms,\r\n    That in their green shops weave the smooth-hair'd silk.\"\r\n\r\n    Milton's _Comus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the caterpillars of butterflies, moths, and, in general, of insects\r\nwith four wings, are capable of spinning silk; of various degrees of\r\nfineness and strength, and differing in colour, but usually white,\r\nyellow, brown, black, or grey. This is not only of advantage in\r\nconstructing nests for themselves, and particularly for their pupæ,\r\nas we have so frequently exemplified in the preceding pages, but it\r\nenables them, the instant they are excluded from the egg, to protect\r\nthemselves from innumerable accidents, as well as from enemies. If a\r\ncaterpillar, for instance, be exposed to a gust of wind, and blown off\r\nfrom its native tree, it lets itself gently down, and breaks its fall,\r\nby immediately spinning a cable of silk, along which, also, it can\r\nreascend to its former station when the danger is over. In the same way\r\nit frequently disappoints a bird that has marked it out for prey, by\r\ndropping hurriedly down from a branch, suspended to its never-failing\r\ndelicate cord. The leaf-rollers, formerly described, have the advantage\r\nof other caterpillars in such cases, by being able to move as quickly\r\nbackwards as forwards; so that when a bird puts in its bill at one\r\nend of the roll, the insect makes a ready exit at the other, and\r\ndrops along its thread as low as it judges convenient. We have seen\r\ncaterpillars drop in this way from one to six feet or more; and by\r\nmeans of their cable, which they are careful not to break, they climb\r\nback with great expedition to their former place.\r\n\r\nThe structure of their legs is well adapted for climbing up their\r\nsingular rope--the six fore-legs being furnished with a curved claw;\r\nwhile the pro-legs (as they have been termed) are no less fitted for\r\nholding them firm to the branch when they have regained it, being\r\nconstructed on the principle of forming a vacuum, like the leather\r\nsucker with which boys lift and drag stones. The foot of the common\r\nfly has a similar sucker, by which it is enabled to walk on glass, and\r\notherwise support itself against gravity. The different forms of the\r\nleg and pro-leg of a spinning caterpillar are represented in the figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Leg and Pro-leg of a Caterpillar, greatly magnified.]\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the nature of the apparatus by which a\r\ncaterpillar spins its silk, it is to be recollected that its whole\r\ninterior structure differs from that of warm-blooded animals. It has,\r\nproperly speaking, no heart, though a long tubular _dorsal vessel_,\r\nwhich runs along the back, and pulsates from twenty to one hundred\r\ntimes per minute, has been called so by Malpighi and others, but\r\nneither Lyonnet nor Cuvier could detect any vessel issuing from it, and\r\nconsequently the fluid which is analogous to blood has no circulation.\r\nIt differs also from the higher orders of animals in having no brain,\r\nthe nerves running along the body being only united by little knobs,\r\ncalled ganglions. Another circumstance is, that it has no lungs,\r\nand does not breathe by the mouth, but by air-holes, or spiracles,\r\neighteen in number, situated along the sides, in the middle of the\r\nrings, as may be seen in the following figure from Lyonnet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Caterpillar of the Goat Moth (_Cossus ligniperda_).]\r\n\r\nThese spiracles communicate on each side with tubes, that have been\r\ncalled the wind-pipes (_tracheæ_). The spinning apparatus is placed\r\nnear the mouth, and is connected with the silk-bags, which are long,\r\nslender, floating vessels, containing a liquid gum. The bags are closed\r\nat their lower extremity, become wider towards the middle, and more\r\nslender towards the head, where they unite to form the spinning-tube,\r\nor spinneret. The bags being in most cases longer than the body of the\r\ncaterpillar, necessarily lie in a convoluted state, like the intestines\r\nof quadrupeds. The capacity, or rather the length, of the silk-bags\r\nis in proportion to the quantity of silk required for spinning; the\r\n_Cossus ligniperda_, for example, from living in the wood of trees\r\nspins little, having a bag only one-fourth the length of that of the\r\nsilk-worm, though the caterpillar is at least twice the dimensions of\r\nthe latter. The following figure, taken from the admirable treatise\r\nof Lyonnet on the anatomy of the _Cossus_, will render these several\r\norgans more easily understood than any description.\r\n\r\nThe spinneret itself was supposed by Réaumur to have two outlets for\r\nthe silk; but Lyonnet, upon minute dissection, found that the two tubes\r\nunited into one before their termination; and he also assured himself\r\nthat it was composed of alternate slips of horny and membranaceous\r\nsubstance,--the one for pressing the thread into a small diameter,\r\nand the other for enlarging it at the insect's pleasure. It is cut at\r\nthe end somewhat like a writing-pen, though with less of a slope, and\r\nis admirably fitted for being applied to objects to which it may be\r\nrequired to attach silk. The following are magnified figures of the\r\nspinneret of the _Cossus_, from Lyonnet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Interior Structure of the Cossus.--A, silk bags; B, silk\r\ntube, through which the viscid matter, of which the silk threads are\r\nformed, is forced by a peristaltic motion; C, stomach; D D, intestines,\r\nwith the coil of bile vessels.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Side-view of the Silk-tube.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section of the Silk-tube, magnified 22,000 times.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Labium, or lower lip of Cossus.--_a_, Silk-tube.]\r\n\r\n\"You may sometimes have seen,\" says the Abbé de la Pluche, \"in the\r\nwork-rooms of goldsmiths or gold wire-drawers, certain iron plates,\r\npierced with holes of different calibres, through which they draw gold\r\nand silver wire, in order to render it finer. The silk-worm has under\r\nher mouth such a kind of instrument, perforated with a pair of holes\r\n[united into one on the outside[DQ],] through which she draws two drops\r\nof the gum that fills her two bags. These instruments are like a pair\r\nof distaffs for spinning the gum into a silken thread. She fixes the\r\nfirst drop of gum that issues where she pleases, and then draws back\r\nher head, or lets herself fall, while the gum, continuing to flow, is\r\ndrawn out and lengthened into a double stream. Upon being exposed to\r\nthe air, it immediately loses its fluidity, becomes dry, and acquires\r\nconsistence and strength. She is never deceived in adjusting the\r\ndimensions of the [united] apertures, or in calculating the proper\r\nthickness of the thread, but invariably makes the strength of it\r\nproportionable to the weight of her body.\r\n\r\n\"It would be a very curious thing to know how the gum which composes\r\nthe silk is separated and drawn off from the other juices that nourish\r\nthe animal. It must be accomplished like the secretions formed by\r\nglands in the human body. I am therefore persuaded that the gum-bags of\r\nthe silk-worm are furnished with a set of minute glands, which being\r\nimpregnated with gum, afford a free passage to all the juices of the\r\nmulberry-leaf corresponding with this glutinous matter, while they\r\nexclude every fluid of a different quality.\"[DR] When confined in an\r\nopen glass vessel, the goat-moth caterpillar will effect its escape by\r\nconstructing a curious silken ladder, as represented by Roesel.\r\n\r\nCaterpillars, as they increase in size, cast their skins as lobsters\r\ndo their shells, and emerge into renewed activity under an enlarged\r\ncovering. Previous to this change, when the skin begins to gird and\r\npinch them, they may be observed to become languid, and indifferent to\r\ntheir food, and at length they cease to eat, and await the sloughing of\r\ntheir skin. It is now that the faculty of spinning silk seems to be of\r\ngreat advantage to them; for, being rendered inactive and helpless by\r\nthe tightening of the old skin around their expanding body, they might\r\nbe swept away by the first puff of wind, and made prey of by ground\r\nbeetles or other carnivorous prowlers. To guard against such accidents,\r\nas soon as they feel that they can swallow no more food, from being\r\nhalf choked by the old skin, they take care to secure themselves from\r\ndanger by moorings of silk spun upon the leaf or the branch where they\r\nmay be reposing. The caterpillar of the white satin-moth (_Leucoma\r\nsalicis_, Stephens) in this way draws together with silk one or two\r\nleaves, similar to the leaf-rollers (_Tortricidæ_), though it always\r\nfeeds openly without any covering. The caterpillar of the puss-moth\r\nagain, which, in its third skin, is large and heavy, spins a thick web\r\non the upper surface of a leaf, to which it adheres till the change is\r\neffected.\r\n\r\nThe most important operation, however, of silk-spinning is performed\r\nbefore the caterpillar is transformed into a chrysalis, and is\r\nmost remarkable in the caterpillars of moths and other four-winged\r\nflies, with the exception of those of butterflies; for though these\r\nexhibit, perhaps, greater ingenuity, they seldom spin more than a\r\nfew threads to secure the chrysalis from falling, whereas the others\r\nspin for it a complete envelope or shroud. We have already seen, in\r\nthe preceding pages, several striking instances of this operation,\r\nwhen, probably for the purpose of husbanding a scanty supply of silk,\r\nextraneous substances are worked into the texture. In the case of other\r\ncaterpillars, silk is the only material employed.\r\n\r\nOf this the cocoon of the silk-worm is the most prominent example, in\r\nconsequence of its importance in our manufactures and commerce, and on\r\nthat account will demand from us somewhat minute details, though it\r\nwould require volumes to incorporate all the information which has been\r\npublished on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nSilk-Worm.\r\n\r\nThe silk-worm, like most other caterpillars, changes its skin four\r\ntimes during its growth. The intervals at which the four moultings\r\nfollow each other depend much on climate or temperature, as well as\r\non the quality and quantity of food. It is thence found, that if they\r\nare exposed to a high temperature, say from 81° to 100° Fahrenheit,\r\nthe moultings will be hastened; and only five days will be consumed in\r\nmoulting the third or fourth time, whilst those worms that have not\r\nbeen hastened take seven or eight days.[DS]\r\n\r\nThe period of the moultings is also influenced by the temperature in\r\nwhich the eggs have been kept during the winter. When the heat of the\r\napartment has been regulated, the first moulting takes place on the\r\nfourth or fifth day after hatching, the second begins on the eighth\r\nday, the third takes up the thirteenth and fourteenth days, and the\r\nlast occurs on the twenty-second and twenty-third days. The fifth age,\r\nin such cases, lasts ten days, at the end of which, or thirty-two days\r\nafter hatching, the caterpillars attain their full growth, and ought to\r\nbe three inches in length; but if they have not been properly fed, they\r\nwill not be so long.\r\n\r\nWith the age of the caterpillar, its appetite increases, and is at its\r\nmaximum after the fourth moulting, when it also attains its greatest\r\nsize. The silk gum is then elaborated in the reservoirs, while the\r\ncaterpillar ceases to eat, and soon diminishes again in size and\r\nweight. This usually requires a period of nine or ten days, commencing\r\nfrom the fourth moulting, after which it begins to spin its shroud of\r\nsilk. In this operation it proceeds with the greatest caution, looking\r\ncarefully for a spot in which it may be most secure from interruption.\r\n\r\n\"We usually,\" says the Abbé de la Pluche, \"give it some little stalks\r\nof broom, heath, or a piece of paper rolled up, into which it retires,\r\nand begins to move its head to different places, in order to fasten its\r\nthread on every side. All this work, though it looks to a bystander\r\nlike confusion, is not without design. The caterpillar neither arranges\r\nits threads nor disposes one over another, but contents itself with\r\ndistending a sort of cotton or floss to keep off the rain; for Nature\r\nhaving ordained silk-worms to work under trees, they never change their\r\nmethod even when they are reared in our houses.\r\n\r\n\"When my curiosity led me to know how they spun and placed their\r\nbeautiful silk, I took one of them, and frequently removed the floss\r\nwith which it first attempted to make itself a covering; and as by\r\nthis means I weakened it exceedingly, when it at last became tired\r\nof beginning anew, it fastened its threads on the first thing it\r\nencountered, and began to spin very regularly in my presence, bending\r\nits head up and down, and crossing to every side. It soon confined\r\nits movements to a very contracted space, and, by degrees, entirely\r\nsurrounded itself with silk; and the remainder of its operations became\r\ninvisible, though these may be understood from examining the work\r\nafter it is finished. In order to complete the structure, it must draw\r\nout of the gum-bag a more delicate silk, and then with a stronger gum\r\nbind all the inner threads over one another.\r\n\r\n\"Here, then, are three coverings entirely different, which afford a\r\nsuccession of shelter. The outer loose silk, or floss, is for keeping\r\noff the rain; the fine silk in the middle prevents the wind from\r\ncausing injury; and the glued silk, which composes the tapestry of\r\nthe chamber where the insect lodges, repels both air and water, and\r\nprevents the intrusion of cold.\r\n\r\n\"After building her cocoon, she divests herself of her fourth skin, and\r\nis transformed into a chrysalis, and subsequently into a moth (_Bombyx\r\nmori_), when, without saw or centre-bit, she makes her way through the\r\nshell, the silk, and the floss; for the Being who teaches her how to\r\nbuild herself a place of rest, where the delicate limbs of the moth may\r\nbe formed without interruption, instructs her likewise how to open a\r\npassage for escape.\r\n\r\n\"The cocoon is like a pigeon's egg, and more pointed at one end\r\nthan the other; and it is remarkable that the caterpillar does not\r\ninterweave its silk towards the pointed end, nor apply its glue there\r\nas it does in every other part,[DT] by bending itself all around with\r\ngreat pliantness and agility: what is more, she never fails, when her\r\nlabour is finished, to fix her head opposite to the pointed extremity.\r\nThe reason of her taking this position is, that she has purposely\r\nleft this part less strongly cemented, and less exactly closed. She\r\nis instinctively conscious that this is to be the passage for the\r\nperfect insect which she carries in her bowels, and has therefore the\r\nadditional precaution never to place this pointed extremity against any\r\nsubstance that might obstruct the moth at the period of its egress.\r\n\r\n\"When the caterpillar has exhausted herself to furnish the labour and\r\nmaterials of the three coverings, she loses the form of a worm; her\r\nspoils drop all around the chrysalis; first throwing off the skin,\r\nwith the head and jaws attached to it, and the new skin hardening\r\ninto a sort of leathery consistence. Its nourishment is already in its\r\nstomach, and consists of a yellowish mucus, but gradually the rudiments\r\nof the moth unfold themselves,--the wings, the antennæ, and the legs\r\nbecoming solid. In about a fortnight or three weeks, a slight swelling\r\nin the chrysalis may be remarked, which at length produces a rupture in\r\nthe membrane that covers it, and by repeated efforts the moth bursts\r\nthrough the leathery envelope into the chamber of the cocoon.\r\n\r\n\"The moth then extends her antennæ, together with her head and feet,\r\ntowards the point of the cone, which not being thickly closed up in\r\nthat part gradually yields to her efforts; she enlarges the opening,\r\nand at last comes forth, leaving at the bottom of the cone the ruins of\r\nits former state--namely, the head and entire skin of the caterpillar,\r\nwhich bear some resemblance to a heap of foul linen.\"[DU]\r\n\r\nRéaumur was of opinion that the moth makes use of its eyes as a file,\r\nin order to effect its passage through the silk; while Malpighi, Peck,\r\nand others, believe that it is assisted by an acid which it discharges\r\nin order to dissolve the gum that holds the fibres of the silk together\r\n(see p. 338). Mr. Swayne denies that the threads are broken at all,\r\neither by filing or solution; for he succeeded in unwinding a whole\r\ncocoon from which the moth had escaped. The soiling of the cocoon by a\r\nfluid, however, we may remark, is no proof of the acid; for all moths\r\nand butterflies discharge a fluid when they assume wings, whether they\r\nbe inclosed in a cocoon or not; but it gives no little plausibility to\r\nthe opinion, that \"the end of the cocoon is observed to be wetted for\r\nan hour, and sometimes several hours, before the moth makes its way\r\nout.\"[DV] Other insects employ different contrivances for escape, as we\r\nhave already seen, and shall still further exemplify.\r\n\r\nIt is the middle portion of the cocoon, after removing the floss or\r\nloose silk on the exterior, which is used in our manufactures; and the\r\nfirst preparation is to throw the cocoons into warm water, and to stir\r\nthem about with twigs, to dissolve any slight gummy adhesions which may\r\nhave occurred when the caterpillar was spinning. The threads of several\r\ncones, according to the strength of the silk wanted, are then taken and\r\nwound off upon a reel. The refuse, consisting of what we may call the\r\ntops and bottoms of the cones, are not wound, but carded, like wool or\r\ncotton, in order to form coarser fabrics. We learn from the fact of the\r\ncocoons being generally unwound without breaking the thread, that the\r\ninsect spins the whole without interruption. It is popularly supposed,\r\nhowever, that if it be disturbed during the operation by any sort of\r\nnoise, it will take alarm, and break its thread; but Latreille says\r\nthis is a vulgar error.[DW]\r\n\r\nThe length of the unbroken thread in a cocoon varies from six hundred\r\nto a thousand feet; and as it is all spun double by the insect, it\r\nwill amount to nearly two thousand feet of silk, the whole of which\r\ndoes not weigh above three grains and a half; five pounds of silk from\r\nten thousand cocoons is considerably above the usual average. When\r\nwe consider, therefore, the enormous quantity of silk which is used\r\nat present, the number of worms employed in producing it will almost\r\nexceed our comprehension. The manufacture of the silk, indeed, gives\r\nemployment, and furnishes subsistence, to several millions of human\r\nbeings; and we may venture to say, that there is scarcely an individual\r\nin the civilized world who has not some article made of silk in his\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times, the manufacture of silk was confined to the East\r\nIndies and China, where the insects that produce it are indigenous. It\r\nwas thence brought to Europe in small quantities, and in early times\r\nsold at so extravagant a price, that it was deemed too expensive even\r\nfor royalty. The Emperor Aurelian assigned the expense as a reason for\r\nrefusing his empress a robe of silk; and our own James I., before his\r\naccession to the crown of England, had to borrow of the Earl of Mar a\r\npair of silk stockings to appear in before the English ambassador,\r\na circumstance which probably led him to promote the cultivation of\r\nsilk in England.[DX] The Roman authors were altogether ignorant of\r\nits origin,--some supposing it to be grown on trees as hair grows\r\non animals,--others that it was produced by a shell-fish similar to\r\nthe mussel, which is known to throw out threads for the purpose of\r\nattaching itself to rocks,--others that it was the entrails of a sort\r\nof spider, which was fed for four years with paste, and then with the\r\nleaves of the green willow, till it burst with fat,--and others that it\r\nwas the produce of a worm which built nests of clay and collected wax.\r\nThe insect was at length spread into Persia; and eggs were afterwards,\r\nat the instance of the Emperor Justinian, concealed in hollow canes by\r\ntwo monks, and conveyed to the Isle of Cos. This emperor, in the sixth\r\ncentury, caused them to be introduced into Constantinople, and made an\r\nobject of public utility. They were thence successively cultivated in\r\nGreece, in Arabia, in Spain, in Italy, in France, and in all places\r\nwhere any hope could be indulged of their succeeding. In America the\r\nculture of the silk-worm was introduced into Virginia in the time of\r\nJames I., who himself composed a book of instructions on the subject,\r\nand caused mulberry-trees and silk-worms' eggs to be sent to the\r\ncolony. In Georgia, also, lands were granted on condition of planting\r\none hundred white mulberry-trees on every ten acres of cleared land.[DY]\r\n\r\nThe growth of the silk-worm has also been tried, but with no great\r\nsuccess, in this country. Evelyn computed that one mulberry-tree would\r\nfeed as many silk-worms annually as would produce seven pounds of\r\nsilk. \"According to that estimate,\" says Barham,[DZ] \"the two thousand\r\ntrees already planted in Chelsea Park (which take up one-third of\r\nit) will make 14,000 lbs. weight of silk; to be commonly worth but\r\ntwenty shillings a pound, those trees must make 14,000_l._ per annum.\"\r\nDuring the last century, some French refugees in the south of Ireland\r\nmade considerable plantations of the mulberry, and had begun the\r\ncultivation of silk with every appearance of success; but since their\r\nremoval the trees have been cut down.[EA] In the vicinity of London,\r\nalso, a considerable plantation of mulberry-trees was purchased by the\r\nBritish, Irish, and Colonial Silk Company in 1825; but we have not\r\nlearned whether this Company have any active measures now in operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of silk was introduced into this country in 1718,\r\nat Derby, by Mr. John Lombe, who travelled into Italy to obtain the\r\nrequisite information; but so jealous were the Italians of this, that\r\naccording to some statements which have obtained belief, he fell a\r\nvictim to their revenge, having been poisoned at the early age of\r\ntwenty-nine.[EB]\r\n\r\nThere are not only several varieties of the common silk-worm (_Bombyx\r\nmori_), but other species of caterpillars, which spin silk capable of\r\nbeing manufactured, though not of so good qualities as the common silk.\r\nNone of our European insects, however, seem to be well fitted for the\r\npurpose, though it has been proposed by Fabricius and others to try\r\nthe crimson under-wing (_Catocala sponsa_, Schrank), &c. M. Latreille\r\nquotes from the 'Recreations of Natural History,' by Wilhelm, the\r\nstatement that the cocoons of the emperor-moth (_Saturnia pavonia_)\r\nhad been successfully tried in Germany, by M. Wentzel Hegeer de\r\nBerchtoldsdorf, under an imperial patent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cocoons of the Emperor-moth, cut open to show their\r\nstructure.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEmperor-Moth.\r\n\r\nThe emperor-moth, indeed, is no less worthy of our attention with\r\nrespect to the ingenuity of its architecture than the beauty of\r\nits colours, and has consequently attracted the attention of every\r\nEntomologist. The caterpillar feeds on fruit-trees and on the willow,\r\nand spins a cocoon, in the form of a Florence flask, of strong silk,\r\nso thickly woven that it appears almost like damask or leather. It\r\ndiffers from most other cocoons in not being closed at the upper or\r\nsmaller end, which terminates in a narrow circular aperture, formed\r\nby the convergence of little bundles of silk, gummed together, and\r\nalmost as elastic as whalebone. In consequence of all these terminating\r\nin needle-shaped points, the entrance of depredators is guarded\r\nagainst, upon the principle which prevents the escape of a mouse from\r\na wire trap. The insect, however, not contented with this protection,\r\nconstructs another in form of a canopy or dome, within the external\r\naperture, so as effectually to shield the chrysalis from danger.\r\nWe have formerly remarked (page 210) that the caterpillar of the\r\n_Ægeria asiliformis_ of Stephens in a similar way did not appear to be\r\ncontented with a covering of thin wood, without an additional bonnet of\r\nbrown wax. The cocoon of the emperor-moth, though thus in some measure\r\nimpenetrable from without, is readily opened from within; and when the\r\nmoth issues from its pupa case, it easily makes its way out without\r\neither the acid or eye-files ascribed to the silk-worm. The elastic\r\nsilk gives way upon being pushed from within, and when the insect is\r\nfairly out, it shuts again of its own accord, like a door with spring\r\nhinges,--a circumstance which at first puzzled Roesel not a little when\r\nhe saw a fine large moth in his box, and the cocoon apparently in the\r\nsame state as when he had put it there. Another naturalist conjectures\r\nthat the converging threads are intended to compress the body of the\r\nmoth as it emerges, in order to force the fluids into the nervures\r\nof the wings; for when he took the chrysalis previously out of the\r\ncocoon, the wings of the moth never expanded properly.[EC] Had he been\r\nmuch conversant with breeding insects, he would rather, we think,\r\nhave imputed this to some injury which the chrysalis had received.\r\nWe have witnessed the shrivelling of the wings which he alludes to,\r\nin many instances, and not unfrequently in butterflies which spin no\r\ncocoon. The shrivelling, indeed, frequently arises from the want of\r\na sufficient supply of food to the caterpillar in its last stage,\r\noccasioning a deficiency in the fluids.\r\n\r\nThe elasticity of the cocoon is not peculiar to the emperor-moth. A\r\nmuch smaller insect, the green cream-border-moth (_Tortrix chlorana_)\r\nbefore mentioned (page 190), for its ingenuity in bundling up the\r\nexpanding leaves of the willow, also spins an elastic shroud for its\r\nchrysalis, of the singular shape of a boat with the keel uppermost.\r\nLike the caterpillar of _Pyralis strigulalis_ (page 217), whose\r\nbuilding, though of different materials, is exactly of the same form,\r\nits first spins two approximating walls of whitish silk, of the form\r\nrequired, and when these are completed, it draws them forcibly together\r\nwith elastic threads, so placed as to retain them closely shut. The\r\npassage of the moth out of this cocoon might have struck Roesel as\r\nstill more marvellous than that of his emperor, in which there was at\r\nleast a small opening; while in the boat cocoon there is none. We have\r\nnow before us two of these, which we watched the caterpillars through\r\nthe process of building, in the summer of 1828, and from one only a\r\nmoth issued--the other, as often happens, having died in the chrysalis.\r\nBut what is most remarkable, it is impossible by the naked eye to tell\r\nwhich of these two has been opened by the moth, so neatly has the\r\njoining been finished. (J. R.)\r\n\r\nSome species of moths spin a very slight silken tissue for their\r\ncocoons, being apparently intended more to retain them from falling\r\nthan to afford protection from other accidents. The gipsy-moth\r\n(_Hypogymna dispar_), rare in most parts of Britain, is one of these.\r\nIt selects for its retreat a crack in the bark of the tree upon which\r\nit feeds, and over this spins only a few straggling threads. We found\r\nlast summer (1829), in the hole of an elm-tree in the Park at Brussels,\r\na group of half a dozen of these, that did not seem to have spun any\r\ncovering at all, but trusted to a curtain of moss (_Hypna_) which\r\nmargined the entrance. (J. R.) In a species nearly allied to this,\r\nthe yellow-tussock (_Dasychira pudibunda_, Stephens), the cocoon, one\r\nof which we have now before us, is of a pretty close texture, and\r\ninterwoven with the long hairs of the caterpillar itself (see figure\r\n_b_, page 17), which it plucks out piecemeal during the process of\r\nbuilding,--as is also done by the vapourer (_Orgyia antiqua_, Hubner),\r\nand many others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cocoon of Arctia villica.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Net-work cocoon.]\r\n\r\nThese are additional instances of the remarks we formerly made, that\r\ncaterpillars which spin a slight web are transformed into perfect\r\ninsects in a much shorter period than those which spin more substantial\r\nones. Thus the cream-spot tiger (_Arctia villica_, Stephens) lies in\r\nchrysalis only three weeks, and therefore does not require a strong\r\nweb. It is figured above, along with another, which is still slighter,\r\nthough more ingeniously woven, being regularly meshed like net-work.\r\n\r\nA very prettily-netted cocoon is constructed by the grub of a very\r\nsmall grey weevil (_Hypera rumicis_), which is not uncommon in July,\r\non the seed spikes of docks (_Rumices_). This cocoon is globular, and\r\nnot larger than a garden pea, though it appears to be very large in\r\nproportion to the pupa of the insect, reminding us not a little of the\r\ncarved ivory balls from China. The meshes of the net-work are also\r\nlarge, but the materials are strong and of a waxy consistence. Upon\r\nremarking that no netting was ever spun over the part of the plant\r\nto which the cocoon was attached, we endeavoured to make them spin\r\ncocoons perfectly globular by detaching them when nearly finished; but\r\nthough we tried four or five in this way, we could not make them add a\r\nsingle mesh after removal, all of them making their escape through the\r\nopening, and refusing to re-enter in order to complete their structure.\r\n(J. R.)\r\n\r\nThe silk, if it may be so termed, spun by many species of larvæ is\r\nof a still stronger texture than the waxy silk of the little weevil\r\njust mentioned. We recently met with a remarkable instance of this at\r\nLee, in the cocoons of one of the larger ichneumons (_Ophion Vinulæ_?\r\nStephens), inclosed in that of a puss-moth (_Cerura Vinula_)--itself\r\nremarkable for being composed of sand as well as wood, the fibres of\r\nwhich had been scooped out of the underground cross-bar of an old\r\npaling, to which it was attached. But the most singular portion of\r\nthis was the junction of the outer wall with the edges of the hollow\r\nthus scooped out, which was formed of fibres of wood placed across\r\nthe fibres of the bar nearly at right angles, and strongly cemented\r\ntogether, as if to form a secure foundation for the building.\r\n\r\nIn this nest were formed, surreptitiously introduced into the original\r\nbuilding, five empty cells of a black colour, about an inch long, and a\r\nsixth of an inch in diameter; nearly cylindrical in form, but somewhat\r\nflattened; vertical and parallel to one another, though slightly curved\r\non the inner side. The cells are composed of strong and somewhat\r\ncoarse fibres, more like the carbonized rootlets of a tree than silk,\r\nand resembling in texture a piece of coarse milled cloth or felt, such\r\nas is used for the bases of plated hats. It is worthy of remark, that\r\nall these cells opened towards one end, as if the caterpillars which\r\nconstructed them had been aware that the wall of the puss-moth, in\r\nwhich the flies would have to make a breach, was very hard, and would\r\nrequire their united efforts to effect an escape. The importance of\r\nsuch a precaution will appear more strikingly, when we compare it with\r\nthe instance formerly mentioned (page 215), in which only one ichneumon\r\nhad been able to force its way out. (J. R.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nest of Puss-moth, inclosing five cocoons of an\r\nIchneumon. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nIt appears indispensable to some grubs to be confined within a certain\r\nspace in order to construct their cocoons. We saw this well exemplified\r\nin the instance of a grub of one of the mason-bees (_Osmia bicornis_),\r\nwhich we took from its nest, and put into a box with the pollen paste\r\nwhich the mother bee had provided for its subsistence. (See pages 45,\r\n46.) When it had completed its growth, it began to spin, but in a\r\nvery awkward manner-attaching threads, as if at random, to the bits\r\nof pollen which remained undevoured, and afterwards tumbling about to\r\nanother part of the box, as if dissatisfied with what it had done. It\r\nsometimes persevered to spin in one place till it had formed a little\r\nvaulted wall; but it abandoned at the least three or four of these in\r\norder to begin others, till at length, as if compelled by the extreme\r\nurgency of the stimulus of its approaching change, it completed a\r\nshell of shining brown silk, woven into a close texture. Had the grub\r\nremained within the narrow clay cell built for it by the mother bee,\r\nit would, in all probability, not have thus exhausted itself in vain\r\nefforts at building, which were likely to prevent it from ever arriving\r\nat the perfect state--a circumstance which often happens in the\r\nartificial breeding of insects. This bee, however, made its appearance\r\nthe following spring. (J. R.)\r\n\r\nBesides silk, the cocoons of many insects are composed of other animal\r\nsecretions, intended to strengthen or otherwise perfect their texture.\r\nWe have already seen that some caterpillars pluck off their own hair\r\nto interweave amongst their silk; there are others which produce\r\na peculiar substance for the same purpose. The lackey caterpillar\r\n(_Clisiocampa neustria_, Curtis) in this manner lines its cocoon with\r\npellets of a downy substance, resembling little tufts of the flowers\r\nof sulphur. The small egger, again (_Eriogaster lanestris_, Germar),\r\ncan scarcely be said to employ silk at all,--the cocoon being of a\r\nuniform texture, looking, at first sight, like dingy Paris plaster, or\r\nthe shell of a pheasant's egg; but upon being broken, and inspected\r\nnarrowly, a few threads of silk may be seen interspersed through the\r\nwhole. In size it is not larger than the egg of the gold-crested\r\nwren. It has been considered by Brahm a puzzling circumstance, that\r\nthis cocoon is usually perforated with one or two little holes, as if\r\nmade by a pin from without; and Kirby and Spence tell us that their\r\nuse has not been ascertained.[ED] May they not be left as air-holes\r\nfor the included chrysalis, as the close texture of the cocoon might,\r\nwithout this provision, prove fatal to the animal? Yet, on comparing\r\none of these with a similar cocoon of the large egger-moth (_Lasiocampa\r\nquercus_), we find no air-holes in the latter, as we might have been\r\nled to expect from the closeness of its texture. We found a cocoon of\r\na saw-fly (_Trichiosoma_), about the same size as that of the egger,\r\nattached to a hawthorn-twig, in a hedge at New Cross, Deptford, but of\r\na leathery texture, and, externally, exactly the colour of the bark of\r\nthe tree. During the summer of 1830 we found a considerable number of\r\nthe same cocoons. These were all without air-holes. The egger, we may\r\nremark, unlike the dock-weevil or the bee-grub just mentioned, can work\r\nher cocoon without any point of attachment. We had a colony of these\r\ncaterpillars in the summer of 1825, brought from Epping Forest, and saw\r\nseveral of them work their cocoons, and we could not but admire the\r\ndexterity with which they avoided filling up the little pin-holes. The\r\nsupply of their building material was evidently measured out to them\r\nin the exact quantity required; for when we broke down a portion of\r\ntheir wall, by way of experiment, they did not make it above half the\r\nthickness of the previous portion, though they plainly preferred having\r\na thin wall to leaving the breach unclosed. (J. R.)\r\n\r\nSeveral species of caterpillars, that spin only silk, are social, like\r\nsome of those we formerly mentioned, which unite to form a common\r\ntent of leaves (see pages 351, 352, &c.). The most common instance\r\nof this is in the caterpillars which feed on the nettle--the small\r\ntortoise-shell (_Vanessa urticæ_), and the peacock's eye (_V. I._).\r\nColonies of these may be seen, after midsummer, on almost every clump\r\nof nettles, inhabiting a thin web of an irregular oval shape, from\r\nwhich they issue out to feed on the leaves, always returning when\r\ntheir appetite is satisfied, to assist their companions in extending\r\ntheir premises. Other examples, still more conspicuous from being seen\r\non fruit-trees and in hedges, occur in the caterpillars of the small\r\nermine-moth (_Yponomeuta padella_), and of the lackey (_Clisiocampa\r\nneustria_), which in some years are but too abundant, though in others\r\nthey are seldom met with. In the summer of 1826, every hedge and\r\nfruit-tree around London swarmed with colonies of the ermine, though\r\nit has not since been plentiful; and in the same way, during the\r\nsummer of 1829, the lackeys were to be seen everywhere. We mention\r\nthis irregularity of appearance that our readers may not disappoint\r\nthemselves by looking for what is not always to be found. It is\r\nprobable that in 1830 the lackeys will be few, for, notwithstanding the\r\nmyriads of caterpillars last summer, we saw only a single moth of this\r\nspecies, and out of a number of chrysalides which a young friend had in\r\nhis nurse-boxes, not one moth was bred.\r\n\r\nThe small ermine does not, besides, feed so indiscriminately as many\r\nothers, but when the bird-cherry (_Prunus padus_), its peculiar\r\nfood, is not to be had, it will put up with blackthorn, plum-tree,\r\nhawthorn, and almost any sort of orchard fruit-tree. With respect to\r\nsuch caterpillars as feed on different plants, Réaumur and De Geer\r\nmake the singular remark, that in most cases they would only eat the\r\nsort of plant upon which they were originally hatched.[EE] We verified\r\nthis, in the case of the caterpillar in question, upon two different\r\nnests which we took, in 1806, from the bird-cherry at Crawfordland,\r\nin Ayrshire. Upon bringing these to Kilmarnock, we could not readily\r\nsupply them with the leaves of this tree; and having then only a slight\r\nacquaintance with the habits of insects, and imagining they would eat\r\nany sort of leaf, we tried them with almost everything green in the\r\nvicinity of the town; but they refused to touch any which we offered\r\nthem. After they had fasted several days, we at length procured some\r\nfresh branches of the bird-cherry, with which they gorged themselves so\r\nthat most of them died. Last summer (1829) we again tried a colony of\r\nthese caterpillars, found on a seedling plum-tree at Lee, in Kent, with\r\nblackthorn, hawthorn, and many other leaves, and even with those of the\r\nbird-cherry; but they would touch nothing except the seedling plum,\r\nrefusing the grafted varieties. (J. R.)\r\n\r\nA circumstance not a little remarkable in so very nice a feeder is,\r\nthat in some cases the mother moth will deposit her eggs upon trees\r\nnot of indigenous growth, and not even of the same genus with her\r\nusual favourites. Thus, in 1825, the cherry-apple, or Siberian crab\r\n(_Pyrus prunifolia_, Willdenow), so commonly grown in the suburbs of\r\nLondon, swarmed with them. On a single tree at Islington we counted\r\nabove twenty nests, each of which would contain from fifty to a hundred\r\ncaterpillars; and though these do not grow thicker than a crow-quill,\r\nso many of them scarcely left a leaf undevoured, and, of course, the\r\nfruit, which showed abundantly in spring, never came to maturity. The\r\nsummer following they were still more abundant on the hawthorn hedges,\r\nparticularly near the Thames, by Battersea and Richmond. Since then we\r\nhave only seen them sparingly; and last summer we could only find the\r\nsingle nest upon which we tried the preceding experiment. (J. R.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Encampment of the caterpillar of the small ermine\r\n(_Yponomeuta padella_) on the Siberian crab.]\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars of other moths, which are in some years very\r\ncommon--such as the brown-tail (_Porthesia auriflua_), and the\r\ngolden-tail (_P. chrysorrhoea_), are also social; and, as the eggs\r\nare hatched late in the summer, the brood passes the winter in a\r\nvery closely-woven nest of warm silk. This is usually represented as\r\ncomposed of leaves which have had their pulpy parts eaten as food by\r\nthe colonists; but from minute observation of at least twenty of these\r\nnests in the winter of 1828-9, we are quite satisfied that leaves\r\nare only an accidental, and not a necessary, part of the structure.\r\nWhen a leaf happens to be in the line of the walls of the nest, it\r\nis included; but there is no apparent design in pressing it into the\r\nservice, nor is a branch selected because it is leafy. On the contrary,\r\nby far the greater number of these nests do not contain a single\r\nleaf, but are composed entirely of grey silk. In external form, no\r\ntwo of these nests are alike; as it depends entirely upon the form of\r\nthe branch. When, therefore, there is only one twig, it is somewhat\r\negg-shaped; but when there are several twigs, it commonly joins each,\r\nassuming an angular shape, as may be seen in the left-hand figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Winter nests of _Porthesia chrysorrhoea_, one being\r\ncut open to show the chambers. The dots represent the egesta of the\r\ncaterpillars.]\r\n\r\nThis irregularity arises from the circumstance of each individual\r\nacting on its own account, without the direction or superintendence of\r\nthe others. The interior of the structure is, for the same reason, more\r\nregular, being divided into compartments, each of which forms a chamber\r\nfor one or more individuals. Previous to the cold weather, these\r\nchambers have but slight partitions; but before the frosts set in the\r\nwhole is made thick and warm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Winter nest of the Social Caterpillars of the Brown-tail\r\nMoth (_Porthesia auriflua_), figured from specimen.]\r\n\r\nNone of the preceding details, however, appear so striking as what\r\nis recorded of the brown-tail moth (_Porthesia auriflua_) by Mr. W.\r\nCurtis,[EF] whose multitudinous colonies spread great alarm over the\r\ncountry in the summer of 1782. This alarm was much increased by the\r\nexaggeration and ignorant details which found their way into the\r\nnewspapers. The actual numbers of these caterpillars must have been\r\nimmense, since Curtis says, \"in many of the parishes near London\r\nsubscriptions have been opened, and the poor people employed to cut off\r\nthe webs at one shilling per bushel, which have been burnt under the\r\ninspection of the church-wardens, overseers, or beadle of the parish:\r\nat the first onset of this business fourscore bushels, as I was most\r\ncredibly informed, were collected in one day in the parish of Clapham.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not, therefore, very much to be wondered at, that the ignorant,\r\nwho are so prone to become the victims of groundless fears, should have\r\ntaken serious alarm on having so unusual a phenomenon forced upon their\r\nattention. Some alarmists accordingly asserted that the caterpillars\r\n\"were the usual presage of the plague;\" and others that they not only\r\npresaged it, but would actually cause it, for \"their numbers were great\r\nenough to render the air pestilential;\" while, to add to the mischief,\r\n\"they would destroy every kind of vegetation, and starve the cattle\r\nin the fields.\" \"Almost every one,\" adds Curtis, \"ignorant of their\r\nhistory, was under the greatest apprehensions concerning them; so that\r\neven prayers were offered up in some churches to deliver the country\r\nfrom the apprehended approaching calamity.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been either the same caterpillar, or one very\r\nnearly allied to it, probably that of the golden-tail (_Porthesia\r\nchrysorrhoea_), which in 1731-2 produced a similar alarm in France.\r\nRéaumur, on going from Paris to Tours, in September, 1730, found every\r\noak, great and small, literally swarming with them, and their leaves\r\nparched and brown as if some burning wind had passed over them; for\r\nwhen newly hatched, like the young buff-tips, they only eat one of the\r\nmembranes of the leaf, and of course the other withers away. These\r\ninfant legions, under the shelter of their warm nests, survived the\r\nwinter in such numbers, that they threatened the destruction not only\r\nof the fruit-trees, but of the forests,--every tree, as Réaumur says,\r\nbeing overrun with them. The Parliament of Paris thought that ravages\r\nso widely extended loudly called for their interference, and they\r\naccordingly issued an edict, to compel the people to uncaterpillar\r\n(_décheniller_) the trees; which Réaumur ridiculed as impracticable, at\r\nleast in the forests. About the middle of May, however, a succession\r\nof cold rains produced so much mortality among the caterpillars, that\r\nthe people were happily released from the edict; for it soon became\r\ndifficult to find a single individual of the species.[EG] In the same\r\nway the cold rains, during the summer of 1829, seem to have nearly\r\nannihilated the lackeys, which in the early part of the summer swarmed\r\non every hedge around London. The ignorance displayed in France, at the\r\ntime in question, was not inferior to that recorded by Curtis; for the\r\nFrench journalists gravely asserted that part of the caterpillars were\r\nproduced by spiders; and that these spiders, and not the caterpillars,\r\nconstructed the webs of the slime of snails, which they were said to\r\nhave been seen collecting for the purpose! \"Verily,\" exclaims Réaumur,\r\n\"there is more ignorance in our age than one might believe.\"\r\n\r\nIt is justly remarked by Curtis, that the caterpillar of the brown-tail\r\nmoth is not so limited a feeder as some, nor so indiscriminate as\r\nothers; but that it always confines itself to trees or shrubs, and is\r\nnever found on herbaceous plants, whose low growth would seldom supply\r\na suitable foundation for its web. Hence the absurdity of supposing\r\nit would attack the herbage of the field, and produce a famine among\r\ncattle. Curtis says, it is found on the \"hawthorn most plentifully, oak\r\nthe same, elm very plentifully, most fruit-trees the same, blackthorn\r\nplentifully, rose-trees the same, bramble the same, on the willow and\r\npoplar scarce. None have been noticed on the elder, walnut, ash, fir,\r\nor herbaceous plants. With respect to fruit-trees the injuries they\r\nsustain are most serious, as, in destroying the blossoms as yet in the\r\nbud, they also destroy the fruit in embryo; the owners of orchards,\r\ntherefore, have great reason to be alarmed.\"\r\n\r\nThe sudden appearance of great numbers of these caterpillars in\r\nparticular years, and their scarcity in others, is in some degree\r\nexplained by a fact stated by Mr. Salisbury. \"A gentleman of Chelsea,\"\r\nhe says, \"has informed me that he once took a nest of moths and bred\r\nthem; that some of the eggs came the first year, some the second, and\r\nothers of the same nest did not hatch till the third season.\"[EH] We\r\nreared, during 1829, several nests both of the brown-tails and of\r\nthe golden-tails, and a number of the females deposited their eggs\r\nin our nurse-cages; but, contrary to the experiment just quoted, all\r\nof these were hatched during the same autumn. (J. R.) The difference\r\nof temperature and moisture in particular seasons may produce this\r\ndiversity.\r\n\r\nA no less remarkable winter nest, of a small species of social\r\ncaterpillar, is described by M. Bonnet, which we omitted to introduce\r\nwhen treating of the Glanville fritillary. The nest in question is\r\nliterally pendulous, being hung from the branch of a fruit tree by\r\na strong silken thread. It consists of one or two leaves neatly\r\nfolded, and held together with silk, in which the caterpillars live\r\nharmoniously together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pendulous leaf-nests, from Bonnet.]\r\n\r\nIn a recently-published volume of 'Travels in Mexico,' we find a very\r\nremarkable account of some pendulous nests of caterpillars, which\r\nappear to be almost as curious as the nests of the pasteboard-making\r\nwasps, described at p. 177. The author of these Travels does not\r\ndefine the species of caterpillar whose constructions attracted his\r\nobservation. He says, \"After having ascended for about an hour, we came\r\nto the region of oaks and other majestically tall trees, the names of\r\nwhich I could not learn. Suspended from their stately branches were\r\ninnumerable nests, enclosed, apparently, in white paper bags, in the\r\nmanner of bunches of grapes in England, to preserve them from birds and\r\nflies. I had the curiosity to examine one of them, which I found to\r\ncontain numberless caterpillars. The texture is so strong that it is\r\nnot easily torn; and the interior contained a quantity of green leaves,\r\nto support the numerous progeny within.\"[EI]\r\n\r\n[We will now give a brief account of several foreign insects that are\r\nremarkable for the pendulous nests which they make.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is built by a hymenopterous insect belonging to the\r\ngenus Larrada. It is fastened to the under side of a leaf, and is made\r\nof vegetable fibres, cut up very short, and masticated by the insect,\r\nmuch like the materials used by the Fungus Ant, described on page 311.\r\nThe insect which forms this nest is black in colour and has very thick\r\nlegs. The wings are clouded. It is but a small insect, being only\r\nthree-eighths of an inch in length. Both nest and insect are in the\r\ncollection of Mr. F. Smith, of the British Museum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nest of Larrada.]\r\n\r\nIn the next illustration are seen two nests built by hymenopterous\r\ninsects belonging to the hymenopterous genus Polybia. The left-hand\r\nfigure represents a nest made by Polybia sedula, a Brazilian insect. It\r\nis fixed to a large leaf, and, as may be seen, has the entrance at the\r\nend of a long neck. The exterior of the nest is a very thin sheet of\r\npale-brown substance, almost identical with the paper with which our\r\nBritish wasps make their nests. It is, however, very much stronger and\r\nvery much thinner, and is very close in texture, so that it effectually\r\nexcludes rain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nests of Polybia.]\r\n\r\nThe right-hand figure shows a nest also brought from Brazil. It has\r\nno neck, the opening being a mere hole beneath. The name Polybia\r\nis derived from two Greek words signifying that many insects live\r\ntogether, and has been given to the genus on account of the social\r\nhabits of its members.\r\n\r\nOur next illustration contains some very remarkable nests.\r\n\r\nThe large central nest is the cocoon of a moth belonging to the genus\r\nOiketicus, or Housebuilder. There are many species of Housebuilder\r\nmoths, and all are remarkable for the fact that the larva never\r\nexhibits itself, but builds a dwelling in which it conceals itself,\r\njust as does the well-known caddis-worm. Indeed the nests of several\r\nOiketici look exactly as if the dwelling of a caddis-worm had been\r\ngreatly enlarged and hung up in a tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nests of Oiketicus, &c.]\r\n\r\nThe nest of this species, however, differs from that of the common\r\nOiketicus by being covered with a coating of greyish silk. If we cut\r\nopen the silk, we find a great number of little sticks and leaf-stems\r\ncrossed on each other, and showing their ends through the silken cover.\r\nWithin these defences there is a layer of leaves cut into small pieces,\r\nand lastly comes the cell inhabited by the caterpillar. It is lined\r\nwith a silken web similar in character to that on the outside, but\r\nfiner, stronger, and whiter The caterpillar is therefore defended by\r\nfour distinct barriers. First comes the strong silken web which lines\r\nthe cell, and next is the layer of leaf fragments. Outside them comes\r\nthe _chevaux de frise_ of crossed sticks, and lastly we have the grey\r\nsilken web. This outer wrapper has no connection with the interior of\r\nthe cell, and is only lightly attached to the ends of the cross sticks.\r\n\r\nWithin this curious dwelling the caterpillar conceals the whole of\r\nits body, clinging to the branch or leaf by its feet, and if alarmed\r\ndrawing itself up so that the mouth of the cocoon is pressed tightly\r\nagainst the branch, and effectually conceals even the feet which hold\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe other figure on the right hand represents the dwelling of another\r\nHousebuilder caterpillar. It looks very much as if it were made of\r\ndrab cloth. The most remarkable point about it is the lower end. When\r\nthe insect is within the dwelling the extremity has a spiral twist,\r\nbut when the moth has escaped the spiral form is destroyed, and it\r\nappears as represented in the illustration. The female Oiketicus never\r\nattains the winged state nor leaves her house, but lives and dies in\r\nit, almost unchanged in shape. In fact, the adult female is even more\r\nundeveloped in appearance than the caterpillar, and looks like a large,\r\nfat, unwieldy grub, covered with down. The male, on the contrary, is\r\na tolerably active moth, with sharply-pointed wings and beautiful\r\nfeathered antennæ.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of Housebuilder's residence is shown in the lower\r\nleft-hand figure, enveloped and almost concealed by leaves.\r\n\r\nThe remaining figures represent the dwellings of two unknown insects,\r\nboth from Australia. The upper left-hand nest is made wonderfully like\r\nthat of the weaver-bird, being composed of fibres like cow-hairs woven\r\nloosely together. It is brown outside and white in the interior.\r\n\r\nThe last nest is made of some substance which is smooth, and hard as\r\nhorn, brown within, and dark grey on the outside. The circular lid by\r\nwhich the enclosed insect escapes is shown open.\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying illustration, we have five remarkable pensile nests\r\nof insects, some British, and others exotic.\r\n\r\nFig. 1 represents the nest of a Pelopæus from Natal. It is made of\r\ndried cow-dung, and is fixed to straws. The length is from three to\r\nfive inches, and there are sometimes found three or more in a row upon\r\na single straw. The insect is about an inch in length, black-blue in\r\ncolour, and with clouded wings. The abdomen is small, sharply pointed,\r\nand placed on a long footstalk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nests of Pelopæus (1, 2); Anthidium (3); Trypoxylon (4);\r\nand Eumenes (5).]\r\n\r\nAt Fig. 2 is seen the nest of _Pelopæus Flavipes_, a North American\r\ninsect, which is also fixed along its whole length to the supporting\r\nobject, which is sometimes a wall, and sometimes, as in the\r\nillustration, a branch. It is made of mud, and the insects seem to have\r\na sort of gregarious instinct, loving to fix their nests in rows, one\r\nabove the other. There is only one larva in each cell. The Pelopæi are,\r\nby the way, allied to the English genus _Ammophila_.\r\n\r\nFig. 3 shows the nest of _Anthidium cordatum_, one of the solitary bees\r\nof Natal. It is made of vegetable fibres. The insect as well as the\r\nnest is represented of the natural size. It is black and shining, with\r\nthe under part and sides and legs yellowish.\r\n\r\nAt Fig. 4 are seen three of the nests of _Trypoxylon aurifrons_, a\r\nBrazilian insect. They are built of mud, and are remarkable for their\r\nelegant shape, which looks as if it had been formed by the hand of the\r\npotter, and for the manner in which the mouth is turned over so as to\r\nform a distinct neck. The larvæ is fed with a store of spiders. The\r\ninsect is represented of the natural size; its colour is black, and the\r\nface is covered with short golden hairs, a fact which has gained for it\r\nthe name of aurifrons, or golden-fronted.\r\n\r\nOur last example, Fig. 5, is the nest of an English insect, _Eumenes\r\ncoarctata_. The insect is represented of its natural size. It is very\r\npretty in colour as well as elegant in shape, being black, diversified\r\nwith yellow bands and spots. The nest is made of clay, and is found\r\nupon the heath twigs. The larvæ of the Eumenes are fed with those of\r\na species of _Crambus_. The insect is tolerably common in Surrey and\r\nHampshire, and appears in July and August.\r\n\r\nThe three figures in the next illustration represent the cocoons of\r\nthree species of the Bombycidæ, and are given in order to show the\r\ndifferent modes by which they are fastened. The upper nest is hung by a\r\nslight cord, which spreads into a broad silken band wrapped round the\r\nbranch for some distance. The right-hand figure shows a very remarkable\r\ncocoon suspended by a long footstalk affixed to a ring. The remarkable\r\npoint in the construction of this ring is that it is very hard and\r\nhorny, and is not fastened to the branch, but passes loosely round it,\r\nso that the cocoon swings backwards and forwards in the breeze. The\r\ncocoon is about two inches in length, and is covered with thick black\r\nveinings. The lowermost cocoon is most curiously fixed to the branch by\r\nbending the leaves round the exterior of the dwelling, and fixing them\r\nto it with silk. All these specimens were brought from Northern India.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bombycidæ.]\r\n\r\nIn all the nests of social caterpillars, care is taken to leave\r\napertures for passing out and in. It is remarkable, also, that however\r\nfar they may ramble from their nest, they never fail to find their way\r\nback when a shower of rain or nightfall renders shelter necessary. It\r\nrequires no great shrewdness to discover how they effect this: for by\r\nlooking closely at their track it will be found that it is carpeted\r\nwith silk--no individual moving an inch without constructing such a\r\npathway, both for the use of his companions and to facilitate his own\r\nreturn. All these social caterpillars, therefore, move more or less\r\nin processional order, each following the road which the first chance\r\ntraveller has marked out with his strip of silk carpeting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nest and order of marching of the Processionary\r\nCaterpillars of the oak (_Cnethocampa processionea_).]\r\n\r\nThere are some species, however, which are more remarkable than others\r\nin the regularity of their processional marchings, particularly two\r\nwhich are found in the south of Europe, but are not indigenous in\r\nBritain. The one named by Réaumur the Processionary (_Cnethocampa\r\nprocessionea_, Stephens) feeds upon the oak; a brood dividing, when\r\nnewly hatched, into one or more parties of several hundred individuals,\r\nwhich afterwards unite in constructing a common nest nearly two feet\r\nlong, and from four to six inches in diameter. As it is not divided\r\nlike that of the brown-tails into chambers, but consists of one large\r\nhall, it is not necessary that there should be more openings than one;\r\nand accordingly, when an individual goes out and carpets a path, the\r\nwhole colony instinctively follow in the same track, though from the\r\nimmense population they are often compelled to march in parallel files\r\nfrom two to six deep. The procession is always headed by a single\r\ncaterpillar; sometimes the leader is immediately followed by one or\r\ntwo in single file, and sometimes by two abreast, as represented\r\nin the cut. A similar procedure is followed by a species of social\r\ncaterpillars which feed on the pine in Savoy and Languedoc; and though\r\ntheir nests are not half the size of the preceding, they are more\r\nworthy of notice, from the strong and excellent quality of their silk,\r\nwhich Réaumur was of opinion might be advantageously manufactured.\r\nTheir nest consists of more chambers than one, but is furnished with\r\na main entrance, through which the colonists conduct their foraging\r\nprocessions.\r\n\r\n[In the accompanying illustration is shown a nest of the Processionary\r\ncaterpillar, part of which has been torn away to show the interior.\r\nInside may be seen the larva of a certain beetle (_Calosoma\r\nsycophanta_), which feeds on these caterpillars, and one of the beetles\r\nis seen below in the act of ascending the tree. This beetle, although\r\nexceedingly scarce in England, is very common on the Continent, and\r\ntrees have been cleared of Processionary caterpillars by the simple\r\nprocess of putting a few female beetles upon the branches.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nest of Processionary Caterpillars (_Cnethocampa_ and\r\n_Calosoma_).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XVIII._\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURES OF SPIDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nModern naturalists do not rank spiders among insects, because they have\r\nno antennæ, and no division between the head and the shoulders. They\r\nbreathe by leaf-shaped gills, situated under the belly, instead of\r\nspiracles in the sides; have a heart connected with these; have eight\r\nlegs instead of six; and eight fixed eyes. But as spiders are popularly\r\nconsidered insects, it will sufficiently suit our purpose to introduce\r\nthem here as such.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus by which spiders construct their ingenious fabrics is\r\nmuch more complicated than that which we have described as common\r\nto the various species of caterpillars. Caterpillars have only two\r\nreservoirs for the materials of their silk; but spiders, according to\r\nthe dissections of M. Treviranus, have four principal vessels, two\r\nlarger and two smaller, with a number of minute ones at their base.\r\nSeveral small tubes branch towards the reservoirs, for carrying to\r\nthem, no doubt, a supply of the secreted material. Swammerdam describes\r\nthem as twisted into many coils of an agate colour.[EJ] We do not find\r\nthem coiled, but nearly straight, and of a deep-yellow colour. From\r\nthese, when broken, threads can be drawn out like those spun by the\r\nspider, though we cannot draw them so fine by many degrees.\r\n\r\nFrom these little flasks or bags of gum, situated near the apex of the\r\nabdomen, and not at the mouth, as in caterpillars, a tube originates,\r\nand terminates in the external spinnerets, which may be seen by the\r\nnaked eye in the larger spiders, in the form of five little teats\r\nsurrounded by a circle, as represented in the following figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Garden Spider (_Epeira diadema_), suspended by a thread\r\nproceeding from its spinneret.]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the silken thread of a caterpillar is composed\r\nof two united within the tube of the spinneret, but the spider's\r\nthread would appear, from the first view of its five spinnerets, to\r\nbe quintuple, and in some species which have six teats, so many times\r\nmore. It is not safe, however, in our interpretations of nature to\r\nproceed upon conjecture, however plausible, nor to take anything for\r\ngranted which we have not actually seen; since our inferences in such\r\ncases are almost certain to be erroneous. If Aristotle, for example,\r\nhad ever looked narrowly at a spider when spinning, he could not have\r\nfancied, as he does, that the materials which it uses are nothing but\r\nwool stripped from its body. On looking, then, with a strong magnifying\r\nglass, at the teat-shaped spinnerets of a spider, we perceive them\r\nstudded with regular rows of minute bristle-like points, about a\r\nthousand to each teat, making in all from five to six thousand. These\r\nare minute tubes which we may appropriately term _spinnerules_, as\r\neach is connected with the internal reservoirs, and emits a thread\r\nof inconceivable fineness. In the following figure, this wonderful\r\napparatus is represented as it appears in the microscope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spinnerets of a Spider magnified to show the\r\n_Spinnerules_.]\r\n\r\nWe do not recollect that naturalists have ventured to assign any cause\r\nfor this very remarkable multiplicity of the spinnerules of spiders, so\r\ndifferent from the simple spinneret of caterpillars. To us it appears\r\nto be an admirable provision for their mode of life. Caterpillars\r\nneither require such strong materials, nor that their thread should\r\ndry as quickly. It is well known in our manufactures, particularly\r\nin rope-spinning, that in cords of equal thickness, those which are\r\ncomposed of many smaller ones united are greatly stronger than those\r\nwhich are spun at once. In the instance of the spider's thread, this\r\nprinciple must hold still more strikingly, inasmuch as it is composed\r\nof fluid materials that require to be dried rapidly, and this drying\r\nmust be greatly facilitated by exposing so many to the air separately\r\nbefore their union, which is effected at the distance of about a tenth\r\nof an inch from the spinnerets. In the following figure each of the\r\nthreads represented is reckoned to contain one hundred minute threads,\r\nthe whole forming only one of the spider's common threads.\r\n\r\nLeeuwenhoeck, in one of his extraordinary microscopical observations on\r\na young spider not bigger than a grain of sand, upon enumerating the\r\nthreadlets in one of its threads, calculated that it would require\r\nfour millions of them to be as thick as a hair of his beard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A single thread of a Spider, greatly magnified, so that,\r\nfor the small space represented, the lines are shown as parallel.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Attached end of a Spider's thread magnified.]\r\n\r\nAnother important advantage derived by the spider from the multiplicity\r\nof its threadlets is, that the thread affords a much more secure\r\nattachment to a wall, a branch of a tree, or any other object, than if\r\nit were simple; for, upon pressing the spinneret against the object, as\r\nspiders always do when they fix a thread, the spinnerules are extended\r\nover an area of some diameter, from every hair's-breadth of which a\r\n_strand_, as rope-makers term it, is extended to compound the main\r\ncord. The preceding figure exhibits this ingenious contrivance.\r\n\r\nThose who may be curious to examine this contrivance will see it best\r\nwhen the line is attached to any black object, for the threads, being\r\nwhitish, are, in other cases, not so easily perceived.\r\n\r\n\r\nShooting of the Lines.\r\n\r\nIt has long been considered a curious though a difficult investigation,\r\nto determine in what manner spiders, seeing that they are destitute\r\nof wings, transport themselves from tree to tree, across brooks, and\r\nfrequently through the air itself, without any apparent starting point.\r\nOn looking into the authors who have treated upon this subject, it is\r\nsurprising how little there is to be met with that is new, even in the\r\nmost recent. Their conclusions, or rather their conjectural opinions,\r\nare, however, worthy of notice; for by unlearning error, we the more\r\nfirmly establish truth.\r\n\r\n1. One of the earliest notions upon this subject is that of Blancanus,\r\nthe commentator on Aristotle, which is partly adopted by Redi, by\r\nHenricus Regius of Utrecht, by Swammerdam,[EK] by Lehmann, and by Kirby\r\nand Spence.[EL] \"The spider's thread,\" says Swammerdam, \"is generally\r\nmade up of two or more parts, and after descending by such a thread,\r\nit ascends by one only, and is thus enabled to waft itself from one\r\nheight or tree to another, even across running waters; the thread it\r\nleaves loose behind it being driven about by the wind, and so fixed\r\nto some other body.\" \"I placed,\" says Kirby, \"the large garden spider\r\n(_Epeira diadema_) upon a stick about a foot long, set upright in a\r\nvessel containing water.... It let itself drop, not by a single thread,\r\nbut by _two_, each distant from the other about the twelfth of an\r\ninch, guided, as usual, by one of its hind feet, and one apparently\r\nsmaller than the other. When it had suffered itself to descend nearly\r\nto the surface of the water, it stopped short, and by some means, which\r\nI could not distinctly see, broke off, close to the spinners, the\r\nsmallest thread, which still adhering by the other end to the top of\r\nthe stick, floated in the air, and was so light as to be carried about\r\nby the slightest breath. On approaching a pencil to the loose end of\r\nthis line, it did not adhere from mere contact. I therefore twisted it\r\nonce or twice round the pencil, and then drew it tight. The spider,\r\nwhich had previously climbed to the top of the stick, immediately\r\npulled at it with one of its feet, and finding it sufficiently tense,\r\ncrept along it, strengthening it as it proceeded by another thread, and\r\nthus reached the pencil.\"\r\n\r\nWe have repeatedly witnessed this occurrence, both in the fields and\r\nwhen spiders were placed for experiment, as Kirby has described;\r\nbut we very much doubt that the thread broken is ever intended as a\r\nbridge cable, or that it would have been so used in that instance, had\r\nit not been artificially fixed and accidentally found again by the\r\nspider. According to our observations, a spider never abandons, for an\r\ninstant, the thread which she despatches in quest of an attachment,\r\nbut uniformly keeps trying it with her feet, in order to ascertain its\r\nsuccess. We are, therefore, persuaded that when a thread is broken in\r\nthe manner above described, it is because it has been spun too weak;\r\nand spiders may often be seen breaking such threads in the process of\r\nnetting their webs. (J. R.)\r\n\r\nThe plan, besides, as explained by these distinguished writers, would\r\nmore frequently prove abortive than successful, from the cut thread\r\nnot being sufficiently long. They admit, indeed, that spiders' lines\r\nare often found \"a yard or two long, fastened to twigs of grass not a\r\nfoot in height.... Here, therefore, some other process must have been\r\nused.\"[EM]\r\n\r\n2. Our celebrated English naturalist, Dr. Lister, whose treatise upon\r\nour native spiders has been the basis of every subsequent work on the\r\nsubject, maintains that \"some spiders shoot out their threads in the\r\nsame manner that porcupines do their quills;[EN] that whereas the\r\nquills of the latter are entirely separated from their bodies, when\r\nthus shot out, the threads of the former remain fixed to their anus,\r\nas the sun's rays to its body.\"[EO] A French periodical writer goes a\r\nlittle farther, and says, that spiders have the power of shooting out\r\nthreads, and directing them at pleasure towards a determined point,\r\njudging of the distance and position of the object by some sense of\r\nwhich we are ignorant.[EP] Kirby also says, that he once observed a\r\nsmall garden spider (_Aranea reticulata_) \"standing midway on a long\r\nperpendicular fixed thread, and an appearance caught\" his \"eye, of\r\nwhat seemed to be the emission of threads.\" \"I, therefore,\" he adds,\r\n\"moved my arm in the direction in which they apparently proceeded,\r\nand, as I had suspected, a floating thread attached itself to my coat,\r\nalong which the spider crept. As this was connected with the spinners\r\nof the spider, it could not have been formed\" by breaking a \"secondary\r\nthread.\"[EQ] Again, in speaking of the gossamer-spider, he says, \"it\r\nfirst extends its thigh, shank, and foot, into a right line, and then,\r\nelevating its abdomen till it becomes vertical, _shoots its thread_\r\ninto the air, and flies off from its station.\"[ER]\r\n\r\nAnother distinguished naturalist, Mr. White of Selborne, in speaking\r\nof the gossamer-spider, says, \"Every day in fine weather in autumn do\r\nI see these spiders shooting out their webs, and mounting aloft: they\r\nwill go off from the finger, if you will take them into your hand.\r\nLast summer, one alighted on my book as I was reading in the parlour;\r\nand running to the top of the page, and _shooting out a web_, took its\r\ndeparture from thence. But what I most wondered at was, that it went\r\noff with considerable velocity in a place where no air was stirring;\r\nand I am sure I did not assist it with my breath.\"[ES]\r\n\r\nHaving so often witnessed the thread set afloat in the air by\r\nspiders, we can readily conceive the way in which those eminent\r\nnaturalists were led to suppose it to be ejected by some animal\r\nforce acting like a syringe; but as the statement can be completely\r\ndisproved by experiment, we shall only at present ask, in the words of\r\nSwammerdam--\"how can it be possible that a thread so fine and slender\r\nshould be shot out with force enough to divide and pass through the\r\nair?--is it not rather probable that the air would stop its progress,\r\nand so entangle it and fit it to perplex the spider's operations?\"[ET]\r\nThe opinion, indeed, is equally improbable with another, suggested by\r\nDr. Lister, that the spider can retract her thread within the abdomen,\r\nafter it has been emitted.[EU] De Geer[EV] very justly joins Swammerdam\r\nin rejecting both of these fancies, which, in our own earlier\r\nobservations upon spiders, certainly struck us as plausible and true.\r\nThere can be no doubt, indeed, that the animal has a voluntary power of\r\npermitting the material to escape, or stopping it at pleasure, but this\r\npower is not projectile.\r\n\r\n3. \"There are many people,\" says the Abbé de la Pluche, \"who believe\r\nthat the spider flies when they see her pass from branch to branch,\r\nand even from one high tree to another; but she transports herself\r\nin this manner: she places herself upon the end of a branch, or some\r\nprojecting body, and there fastens her thread; after which, with her\r\ntwo hind feet, she squeezes her dugs (_spinnerets_), and presses out\r\none or more threads of two or three ells in length, which she leaves\r\nto float in the air till it be fixed to some particular place.\"[EW]\r\nWithout pretending to have observed this, Swammerdam says, \"I can\r\neasily comprehend how spiders, without giving themselves any motion,\r\nmay, by only compressing their spinnerets, force out a thread, which\r\nbeing driven by the wind, may serve to waft them from one place to\r\nanother.\"[EX] Others, proceeding upon a similar notion, give a rather\r\ndifferent account of the matter. \"The spider,\" says Bingley, \"fixes one\r\nend of a thread to the place where she stands, and then with her hind\r\npaws draws out several other threads from the nipples, which, being\r\nlengthened out and driven by the wind to some neighbouring tree or\r\nother object, are by their natural clamminess fixed to it.\"[EY]\r\n\r\nObservation gives some plausibility to the latter opinion, as the\r\nspider always actively uses her legs, though not to draw out the\r\nthread, but to ascertain whether it has caught upon any object. The\r\nnotion of her pressing the spinneret with her feet must be a mere\r\nfancy; at least it is not countenanced by anything which we have\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n4. An opinion much more recondite is mentioned, if it was not started,\r\nby M. D'Isjonval, that the floating of the spider's thread is\r\nelectrical. \"Frogs, cats, and other animals,\" he says, \"are affected\r\nby natural electricity, and feel the change of weather; but no other\r\nanimal more than myself and my spiders.\" During wet and windy weather\r\nhe accordingly found that they spun very short lines, \"but when a\r\nspider spins a long thread, there is a certainty of fine weather for\r\nat least ten or twelve days afterwards.\"[EZ] A periodical writer, who\r\nsigns himself Carolan,[FA] fancies that in darting out her thread the\r\nspider emits a stream of air, or some subtle electric fluid, by which\r\nshe guides it as if by magic.\r\n\r\nA living writer (Mr. John Murray), whose learning and skill in\r\nconducting experiments give no little weight to his opinions, has\r\ncarried these views considerably farther. \"The aëronautic spider,\" he\r\nsays, \"can propel its thread both horizontally and vertically, and at\r\nall relative angles, in motionless air, and in an atmosphere agitated\r\nby winds; nay more, the aërial traveller can even dart its thread, to\r\nuse a nautical phrase, in the 'wind's eye.' My opinion and observations\r\nare based on many hundred experiments.... The entire phenomena are\r\nelectrical. When a thread is propelled in a vertical plane, it remains\r\nperpendicular to the horizontal plane, always upright, and when others\r\nare projected at angles more or less inclined, their direction is\r\ninvariably preserved; the threads never intermingle, and when a pencil\r\nof threads is propelled, it ever presents the appearance of a divergent\r\nbrush. These are electrical phenomena, and cannot be explained but on\r\nelectrical principles.\"\r\n\r\n\"In clear, fine weather, the air is invariably positive; and it is\r\nprecisely in such weather that the aëronautic spider makes its ascent\r\nmost easily and rapidly, whether it be in summer or in winter.\" \"When\r\nthe air is weakly positive, the ascent of the spider will be difficult,\r\nand its altitude extremely limited, and the threads propelled will\r\nbe but little elevated above the horizontal plane. When negative\r\nelectricity prevails, as in cloudy weather, or on the approach of rain,\r\nand the index of De Saussure's hygrometer rapidly advancing towards\r\nhumidity, the spider is unable to ascend.\"[FB]\r\n\r\nMr. Murray had previously told us, that \"when a stick of excited\r\nsealing-wax is brought near the thread of suspension, it is evidently\r\nrepelled; consequently, the electricity of the thread is of a negative\r\ncharacter,\" while \"an excited glass tube brought near, seemed to\r\nattract the thread, and with it the aëronautic spider.\"[FC] His friend,\r\nMr. Bowman, further describes the aërial spider as \"shooting out four\r\nor five, often six or eight, extremely fine webs several yards long,\r\nwhich waved in the breeze, diverging from each other like a pencil of\r\nrays.\" One of them \"had two distinct and widely-diverging fasciculi of\r\nwebs,\" and \"a line uniting them would have been at right angles to the\r\ndirection of the breeze.\"[FD]\r\n\r\nSuch is the chief evidence in support of the electrical theory; but\r\nthough we have tried these experiments, we have not succeeded in\r\nverifying any one of them. The following statements of Mr. Blackwall\r\ncome nearer our own observations.\r\n\r\n5. \"Having procured a small branched twig,\" says Mr. Blackwall, \"I\r\nfixed it upright in an earthen vessel containing water, its base being\r\nimmersed in the liquid, and upon it I placed several of the spiders\r\nwhich produce gossamer. Whenever the insects thus circumstanced were\r\nexposed to a current of air, either naturally or artificially produced,\r\nthey directly turned the thorax towards the quarter whence it came,\r\neven when it was so slight as scarcely to be perceptible, and elevating\r\nthe abdomen, they emitted from their spinners a small portion of\r\nglutinous matter, which was instantly carried out in a line, consisting\r\nof four finer ones, with a velocity equal, or nearly so, to that with\r\nwhich the air moved, as was apparent from observations made on the\r\nmotion of detached lines similarly exposed. The spiders, in the next\r\nplace, carefully ascertained whether their lines had become firmly\r\nattached to any object or not, by pulling at them with the first pair\r\nof legs; and if the result was satisfactory, after tightening them\r\nsufficiently, they made them pass to the twig; then discharging from\r\ntheir spinners, which they applied to the spot where they stood, a\r\nlittle more of their liquid gum, and committing themselves to these\r\nbridges of their own constructing, they passed over them in safety,\r\ndrawing a second line after them, as a security in case the first gave\r\nway, and so effected their escape.\r\n\r\n\"Such was invariably the result when spiders were placed where the air\r\nwas liable to be sensibly agitated: I resolved, therefore, to put a\r\nbell-glass over them; and in this situation they remained seventeen\r\ndays, evidently unable to produce a single line by which they could\r\nquit the branch they occupied, without encountering the water at its\r\nbase; though, on the removal of the glass, they regained their liberty\r\nwith as much celerity as in the instances already recorded.\r\n\r\n\"This experiment, which, from want of due precaution, has misled so\r\nmany distinguished naturalists, I have tried with several geometric\r\nspiders, and always with the same success.\"[FE]\r\n\r\nMr. Blackwall, from subsequent experiments, says he is \"confident\r\nin affirming, that in motionless air spiders have not the power of\r\ndarting their threads even through the space of half an inch.\"[FF]\r\nThe following details are given in confirmation of this opinion. Mr.\r\nBlackwall observed, the 1st Oct., 1826, a little before noon, with the\r\nsun shining brightly, no wind stirring, and the thermometer in the\r\nshade ranging from 55°·5 to 64°, a profusion of shining lines crossing\r\neach other at every angle, forming a confused net-work, covering\r\nthe fields and hedges, and thickly coating his feet and ankles, as\r\nhe walked across a pasture. He was more struck with the phenomenon,\r\nbecause on the previous day a strong gale of wind had blown from the\r\nsouth, and as gossamer is only seen in calm weather, it must have been\r\nall produced within a very short time.\r\n\r\n\"What more particularly arrested my attention,\" says Mr. Blackwall,\r\n\"was the ascent of an amazing quantity of webs, of an irregular,\r\ncomplicated structure, resembling ravelled silk of the finest quality\r\nand clearest white; they were of various shapes and dimensions, some of\r\nthe largest measuring upwards of a yard in length, and several inches\r\nin breadth in the widest part; while others were almost as broad as\r\nlong, presenting an area of a few square inches only.\r\n\r\n\"These webs, it was quickly perceived, were not formed in the air, as\r\nis generally believed, but at the earth's surface. The lines of which\r\nthey were composed, being brought into contact by the mechanical action\r\nof gentle airs, adhered together, till, by continual additions, they\r\nwere accumulated into flakes or masses of considerable magnitude, on\r\nwhich the ascending current, occasioned by the rarefaction of the\r\nair contiguous to the heated ground, acted with so much force as to\r\nseparate them from the objects to which they were attached, raising\r\nthem in the atmosphere to a perpendicular height of at least several\r\nhundred feet. I collected a number of these webs about mid-day, as they\r\nrose; and again in the afternoon, when the upward current had ceased,\r\nand they were falling; but scarcely one in twenty contained a spider:\r\nthough, on minute inspection, I found small winged insects, chiefly\r\naphides, entangled in most of them.\r\n\r\n\"From contemplating this unusual display of gossamer, my thoughts were\r\nnaturally directed to the animals which produced it, and the countless\r\nmyriads in which they swarmed almost created as much surprise as the\r\nsingular occupation that engrossed them. Apparently actuated by the\r\nsame impulse, all were intent upon traversing the regions of air:\r\naccordingly, after gaining the summits of various objects, as blades of\r\ngrass, stubble, rails, gates, &c., by the slow and laborious process\r\nof climbing, they raised themselves still higher by straightening\r\ntheir limbs; and elevating the abdomen, by bringing it from the usual\r\nhorizontal position into one almost perpendicular, they emitted from\r\ntheir spinning apparatus a small quantity of the glutinous secretion\r\nwith which they construct their webs. This viscous substance being\r\ndrawn out by the ascending current of rarefied air into fine lines\r\nseveral feet in length, was carried upward, until the spiders, feeling\r\nthemselves acted upon with sufficient force in that direction, quitted\r\ntheir hold of the objects on which they stood, and commenced their\r\njourney by mounting aloft.\r\n\r\n\"Whenever the lines became inadequate to the purpose for which they\r\nwere intended, by adhering to any fixed body, they were immediately\r\ndetached from the spinners, and so converted into terrestrial gossamer,\r\nby means of the last pair of legs, and the proceedings just described\r\nwere repeated; which plainly proves that these operations result from\r\na strong desire felt by the insects to effect an ascent.\"[FG] Mr.\r\nBlackwall has recently read a paper (still unpublished) in the Linnean\r\nSociety, confirmatory of his opinions.\r\n\r\n6. Without going into the particulars of what agrees or disagrees\r\nin the above experiments with our own observations, we shall give a\r\nbrief account of what we have actually seen in our researches. (J.\r\nR.) So far as we have determined, then, all the various species of\r\nspiders, how different soever the form of their webs may be, proceed\r\nin the circumstance of shooting their lines precisely alike; but\r\nthose which we have found the most manageable in experimenting, are\r\nthe small gossamer spider (_Aranea obtextrix_, Bechstein), known by\r\nits shining blackish-brown body and reddish-brown semi-transparent\r\nlegs; but particularly the long-bodied spider (_Tetragnatha extensa_,\r\nLatr.), which varies in colour from green to brownish or grey--but has\r\nalways a black line along the belly, with a silvery white or yellowish\r\none on each side. The latter is chiefly recommended by being a very\r\nindustrious and persevering spinner, while its movements are easily\r\nseen, from the long cylindrical form of its body and the length of its\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\nWe placed the above two species with five or six others, including\r\nthe garden, the domestic and the labyrinthic spiders, in empty\r\nwine-glasses, set in tea-saucers filled with water to prevent their\r\nescape. When they discovered, by repeated descents from the brims of\r\nthe glasses, that they were thus surrounded by a wet ditch, they all\r\nset themselves to the task of throwing their silken bridges across. For\r\nthis purpose they first endeavoured to ascertain in what direction the\r\nwind blew, or rather (as the experiment was made in our study) which\r\nway any current of air set,--by elevating their arms as we have seen\r\nsailors do in a dead calm. But, as it may prove more interesting to\r\nkeep to one individual, we shall first watch the proceedings of the\r\ngossamer spider.\r\n\r\nFinding no current of air on any quarter of the brim of the glass, it\r\nseemed to give up all hopes of constructing its bridge of escape, and\r\nplaced itself in the attitude of repose; but no sooner did we produce\r\na stream of air, by blowing gently towards its position, than, fixing\r\na thread to the glass, and laying hold of it with one of its feet, by\r\nway of security, it placed its body in a vertical position, with its\r\nspinnerets extended outwards; and immediately we had the pleasure of\r\nseeing a thread streaming out from them several feet in length, on\r\nwhich the little aëronaut sprung up into the air. We were convinced,\r\nfrom what we thus observed, that it was the double or bend of the\r\nthread which was blown into the air; and we assigned as a reason for\r\nher previously attaching and drawing out a thread from the glass, the\r\nwish to give the wind a _point d'appui_--something upon which it might\r\nhave a _purchase_, as a mechanic would say of a lever. The bend of the\r\nthread, then, on this view of the matter, would be carried out by the\r\nwind,--would form the point of impulsion,--and, of course, the escape\r\nbridge would be an ordinary line doubled.\r\n\r\nSuch was our conclusion, which was strongly corroborated by what we\r\nsubsequently found said by M. Latreille--than whom no higher authority\r\ncould be given. \"When the animal,\" says he, \"desires to cross a brook,\r\nshe fixes to a tree or some other object one of the ends of her first\r\nthreads, in order that the wind or a current of air may carry the other\r\nend beyond the obstacle;\"[FH] and as one end is always attached to the\r\nspinnerets, he must mean that the double of the thread flies off. In\r\nhis previous publications, however, Latreille had contented himself\r\nwith copying the statement of Dr. Lister.\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain the fact, and put an end to all doubts, we\r\nwatched, with great care and minuteness, the proceedings of the\r\nlong-bodied spider above mentioned, by producing a stream of air\r\nin the same manner, as it perambulated the brim of the glass. It\r\nimmediately, as the other had done, attached a thread, and raised\r\nits body perpendicularly, like a tumbler, standing on his hands with\r\nhis head downwards; but we looked in vain for this thread bending,\r\nas we had at first supposed, and going off double. Instead of this\r\nit remained tight, while another thread, or what appeared to be so,\r\nstreamed off from the spinners, similar to smoke issuing through a\r\npin-hole, sometimes in a line, and sometimes at a considerable angle,\r\nwith the first, according to the current of the air,--the first thread,\r\nextended from the glass to the spinnerets, remaining all the while\r\ntight drawn in a right line. It further appeared to us, that the\r\nfirst thread proceeded from the pair of spinnerets nearest the head,\r\nwhile the floating thread came from the outer pair,--though it is\r\npossible in such minute objects we may have been deceived. That the\r\nfirst was continuous with the second, without any perceptible joining,\r\nwe ascertained in numerous instances, by catching the floating line\r\nand pulling it tight, in which case the spider glides along without\r\nattaching another line to the glass; but if she has to coil up the\r\nfloating line to tighten it, as usually happens, she gathers it into\r\na packet and glues the two ends tight together. Her body, while\r\nthe floating line streamed out, remained quite motionless, but we\r\ndistinctly saw the spinnerets not only projected, as is always done\r\nwhen a spider spins, but moved in the same way as an infant moves its\r\nlips when sucking. We cannot doubt, therefore, that this motion is\r\nintended to emit (if _eject_ or _project_ be deemed too strong words)\r\nthe liquid material of the thread; at the same time, we are quite\r\ncertain that it cannot throw out a single inch of thread without the\r\naid of a current of air. A long-bodied spider will thus throw out in\r\nsuccession as many threads as we please, by simply blowing towards it;\r\nbut not one where there is no current, as under a bell-glass, where it\r\nmay be kept till it die, without being able to construct a bridge over\r\nwater of an inch long. We never observed more than one floating thread\r\nproduced at the same time; though other observers mention several.\r\n\r\nThe probable commencement, we think, of the floating line, is by the\r\nemission of little globules of the glutinous material to the points of\r\nthe spinnerules--perhaps it may be dropped from them, if not ejected,\r\nand the globules being carried off by the current of air, drawn out\r\ninto a thread. But we give this as only a conjecture, for we could not\r\nbring a glass of sufficient power to bear upon the spinnerules at the\r\ncommencement of the floating line.\r\n\r\nIn subsequent experiments we found that it was not indispensable for\r\nthe spider to rest upon a solid body when producing a line, as she can\r\ndo so while she is suspended in the air by another line. When the\r\ncurrent of air also is strong, she will sometimes commit herself to it\r\nby swinging from the end of the line. We have even remarked this when\r\nthere was scarcely a breath of air.\r\n\r\nWe tried another experiment. We pressed pretty firmly upon the base of\r\nthe spinnerets, so as not to injure the spider, blowing obliquely over\r\nthem; but no floating line appeared. We then touched them with a pencil\r\nand drew out several lines an inch or two in length, upon which we blew\r\nin order to extend them; but in this also we were unsuccessful, as they\r\ndid not lengthen more than a quarter of an inch. We next traced out\r\nthe reservoirs of a garden-spider (_Epeira diadema_), and immediately\r\ntaking a drop of the matter from one of them on the point of a fine\r\nneedle, we directed upon it a strong current of air, and succeeded in\r\nblowing out a thick yellow line, as we might have done with gum-water,\r\nof about an inch and a half long.\r\n\r\nWhen we observed our long-bodied spider eager to throw a line by\r\nraising up its body, we brought within three inches of its spinnerets\r\nan excited stick of sealing-wax, of which it took no notice, nor did\r\nany thread extend to it, not even when brought almost to touch the\r\nspinnerets. We had the same want of success with an excited glass rod;\r\nand indeed we had not anticipated any other result, as we have never\r\nobserved that these either attract or repel the floating threads,\r\nas Mr. Murray has seen them do; nor have we ever seen the end of a\r\nfloating thread separated into its component threadlets and diverging\r\nlike a brush, as he and Mr. Bowman describe. It may be proper to\r\nmention that Mr. Murray, in conformity with his theory, explains the\r\nshooting of lines in a current of air by the electric state produced by\r\nmotion in consequence of the mutual friction of the gaseous particles.\r\nBut this view of the matter does not seem to affect our statements.\r\n\r\n\r\nNests, Webs, and Nets of Spiders.\r\n\r\nThe neatest, though the smallest spider's nest which we have seen, was\r\nconstructed in the chink of a garden post, which we had cut out in\r\nthe previous summer in getting at the cells of a carpenter-bee. The\r\narchitect was one of the large hunting-spiders, erroneously said by\r\nsome naturalists to be incapable of spinning. The nest in question was\r\nabout two inches high, composed of a very close satin-like texture.\r\nThere were two parallel chambers placed perpendicularly, in which\r\nposition also the inhabitant reposed there during the day, going, as we\r\npresume, only abroad to prey during the night. But the most remarkable\r\ncircumstance was, that the openings (two above and two below) were so\r\nelastic, that they shut almost as closely as the boat cocoon of the\r\n_Tortrix Chlorana_. We observed this spider for several months, but at\r\nlast it disappeared, and we took the nest out, under the notion that\r\nit might contain eggs; but we found none, and therefore conclude that\r\nit was only used as a day retreat. (J. R.) The account which Evelyn\r\nhas given of these hunting-spiders is so interesting, that we must\r\ntranscribe it.\r\n\r\n\"Of all sorts of insects,\" says he, \"there is none has afforded me\r\nmore divertisement than the _venatores_ (hunters), which are a sort of\r\n_lupi_ (wolves) that have their dens in rugged walls and crevices of\r\nour houses; a small brown and delicately-spotted kind of spiders, whose\r\nhinder legs are longer than the rest. Such I did frequently observe\r\nat Rome, which, espying a fly at three or four yards' distance, upon\r\nthe balcony where I stood, would not make directly to her, but crawl\r\nunder the rail till, being arrived at the antipodes, it would steal\r\nup, seldom missing its aim; but if it chanced to want anything of\r\nbeing perfectly opposite, would, at first peep, immediately slide down\r\nagain,--till, taking better notice, it would come the next time exactly\r\nupon the fly's back: but if this happened not to be within a competent\r\nleap, then would this insect move so softly, as the very shadow of the\r\ngnomon seemed not to be more imperceptible, unless the fly moved; and\r\nthen would the spider move also in the same proportion, keeping that\r\njust time with her motion, as if the same soul had animated both these\r\nlittle bodies; and whether it were forwards, backwards, or to either\r\nside, without at all turning her body like a well-managed horse: but\r\nif the capricious fly took wing and pitched upon another place behind\r\nour huntress, then would the spider whirl its body so nimbly about, as\r\nnothing could be imagined more swift: by which means she always kept\r\nthe head towards her prey, though, to appearance, as immovable as if\r\nit had been a nail driven into the wood, till by that indiscernible\r\nprogress (being arrived within the sphere of her reach) she made a\r\nfatal leap, swift as lightning, upon the fly, catching him in the pole,\r\nwhere she never quitted hold till her belly was full, and then carried\r\nthe remainder home.\"\r\n\r\nOne feels a little sceptical, however, when he adds, \"I have beheld\r\nthem instructing their young ones how to hunt, which they would\r\nsometimes discipline for not well observing; but when any of the old\r\nones did (as sometimes) miss a leap, they would run out of the field\r\nand hide themselves in their crannies, as ashamed, and haply not\r\nto be seen abroad for four or five hours after; for so long have I\r\nwatched the nature of this strange insect, the contemplation of whose\r\nso wonderful sagacity and address has amazed me; nor do I find in any\r\nchase whatsoever more cunning and stratagem observed. I have found some\r\nof these spiders in my garden, when the weather, towards spring, is\r\nvery hot, but they are nothing so eager in hunting as in Italy.\"[FI]\r\n\r\nWe have only to add to this lively narrative, that the hunting-spider,\r\nwhen he leaps, takes good care to provide against accidental falls by\r\nalways swinging himself from a good strong cable of silk, as Swammerdam\r\ncorrectly states,[FJ] and which anybody may verify, as one of the\r\nsmall hunters (_Salticus scenicus_), known by having its back striped\r\nwith black and white like a zebra, is very common in Britain.\r\n\r\nMr. Weston, the editor of 'Bloomfield's Remains,' falls into a\r\nvery singular mistake about hunting-spiders, imagining them to be\r\nweb-weaving ones which have exhausted their materials, and which are\r\ntherefore compelled to hunt. In proof of this he gives an instance\r\nwhich fell under his own observation![FK]\r\n\r\nAs a contrast to the little elastic satin nest of the hunter, we\r\nmay mention the largest with which we are acquainted,--that of the\r\nlabyrinthic spider (_Agelena labyrinthica_, Walchenaer). Our readers\r\nmust often have seen this nest spread out like a broad sheet in hedges,\r\nfurze, and other low bushes, and sometimes on the ground. The middle\r\nof this sheet, which is of a close texture, is swung like a sailor's\r\nhammock, by silken ropes extended all around to the higher branches;\r\nbut the whole curves upwards and backwards, sloping down to a long\r\nfunnel-shaped gallery which is nearly horizontal at the entrance, but\r\nsoon winds obliquely till it becomes quite perpendicular. This curved\r\ngallery is about a quarter of an inch in diameter, is much more closely\r\nwoven than the sheet part of the web, and sometimes descends into a\r\nhole in the ground, though oftener into a group of crowded twigs, or a\r\ntuft of grass. Here the spider dwells secure, frequently resting with\r\nher legs extended from the entrance of the gallery, ready to spring out\r\nupon whatever insect may fall into her sheet net. She herself can only\r\nbe caught by getting behind her and forcing her out into the web; but\r\nthough we have often endeavoured to make her construct a nest under our\r\neye, we have been as unsuccessful as in similar experiments with the\r\ncommon house spider (_Aranea domestica_). (J. R.)\r\n\r\nThe house spider's proceedings were long ago described by Homberg,\r\nand the account has been copied, as usual, by almost every subsequent\r\nwriter. Goldsmith has, indeed, given some strange misstatements from\r\nhis own observations, and Bingley has added the original remark, that,\r\nafter fixing its first thread, creeping along the wall, and joining\r\nit as it proceeds, it \"_darts itself to the opposite side_, where\r\nthe other end is to be fastened!\"[FL] Homberg's spider took the more\r\ncircuitous route of travelling to the opposite wall, carrying in one\r\nof the claws the end of the thread previously fixed, lest it should\r\nstick in the wrong place. This we believe to be the correct statement,\r\nfor as the web is always horizontal, it would seldom answer to commit\r\na floating thread to the wind, as is done by other species. Homberg's\r\nspider, after stretching as many lines by way of _warp_ as it deemed\r\nsufficient between the two walls of the corner which it had chosen,\r\nproceeded to cross this in the way our weavers do in adding the _woof_,\r\nwith this difference, that the spider's threads were only laid on, and\r\nnot interlaced.[FM] The domestic spiders, however, in these modern\r\ndays, must have forgot this mode of weaving, for none of their webs\r\nwill be found to be thus regularly constructed!\r\n\r\nThe geometric, or net-working spiders (_Tendeuses_, Latr.), are as well\r\nknown in most districts as any of the preceding; almost every bush and\r\ntree in the gardens and hedge-rows having one or more of their nets\r\nstretched out in a vertical position between adjacent branches. The\r\ncommon garden spider (_Epeira diadema_), and the long-bodied spider\r\n(_Tetragnatha extensa_), are the best known of this order.\r\n\r\nThe chief care of a spider of this sort is, to form a cable of\r\nsufficient strength to bear the net she means to hang upon it; and,\r\nafter throwing out a floating line as above described, when it catches\r\nproperly she doubles and redoubles it with additional threads. On\r\ntrying its strength she is not contented with the test of pulling it\r\nwith her legs, but drops herself down several feet from various points\r\nof it, as we have often seen, swinging and bobbing with the whole\r\nweight of her body. She proceeds in a similar manner with the rest of\r\nthe framework of her wheel-shaped net; and it may be remarked that some\r\nof the ends of these lines are not simple, but in form of a Y, giving\r\nher the additional security of two attachments instead of one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Geometric Net of _Epeira diadema_.]\r\n\r\nIn constructing the body of the net, the most remarkable circumstance\r\nis her using her limbs as a measure, to regulate the distances of her\r\n_radii_ or wheel-spokes, and the circular meshes interweaved into them.\r\nThese are consequently always proportional to the size of the spider.\r\nShe often takes up her station in the centre, but not always, though\r\nit is so said by inaccurate writers; for she as frequently lurks in a\r\nlittle chamber constructed under a leaf or other shelter at the corner\r\nof her web, ready to dart down upon whatever prey may be entangled in\r\nher net. The centre of the net is said also to be composed of more\r\nviscid materials than its suspensory lines,--a circumstance alleged to\r\nbe proved by the former appearing under the microscope studded with\r\nglobules of gum.[FN] We have not been able to verify this distinction,\r\nhaving seen the suspensory lines as often studded in this manner as\r\nthose in the centre. (J. R.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMason-Spiders.\r\n\r\nA no less wonderful structure is composed by a sort of spiders,\r\nnatives of the tropics and the south of Europe, which have been justly\r\ncalled mason-spiders by M. Latreille. One of these (_Mygale nidulans_,\r\nWalckn.), found in the West Indies, \"digs a hole in the earth obliquely\r\ndownwards about three inches in length, and one in diameter. This\r\ncavity she lines with a tough thick web, which, when taken out,\r\nresembles a leathern purse; but, what is most curious, this house has\r\na door with hinges, like the operculum of some sea-shells, and herself\r\nand family, who tenant this nest, open and shut the door whenever they\r\npass and repass. This history was told me,\" says Darwin, \"and the nest,\r\nwith its door, shown me by the late Dr. Butt, of Bath, who was some\r\nyears physician in Jamaica.\"[FO]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nest of the Mason-Spider.\r\n\r\nA. The nest shut. B. The nest open. C. The spider, _Mygale cæmentaria_.\r\nD. The eyes magnified. E, F. Parts of the foot and claw magnified.]\r\n\r\nThe nest of a mason-spider, similar to this, has been obligingly put\r\ninto our hands by Mr. Riddle, of Blackheath. It came from the West\r\nIndies, and is probably that of Latreille's clay-kneader (_Mygale\r\ncratiens_), and one of the smallest of the genus. We have since\r\nseen a pair of these spiders in possession of Mr. William Mello, of\r\nBlackheath. The nest is composed of very hard argillaceous clay, deeply\r\ntinged with brown oxide of iron. It is in form of a tube, about one\r\ninch in diameter, between six and seven inches long, and slightly bent\r\ntowards the lower extremity--appearing to have been mined into the clay\r\nrather than built. The interior of the tube is lined with a uniform\r\ntapestry of silken web, of an orange-white colour, with a texture\r\nintermediate between India paper and very fine glove leather. But the\r\nmost wonderful part of this nest is its entrance, which we look upon\r\nas the perfection of insect architecture. A circular door, about the\r\nsize of a crown piece, slightly concave on the outside and convex\r\nwithin, is formed of more than a dozen layers of the same web which\r\nlines the interior, closely laid upon one another, and shaped so that\r\nthe inner layers are the broadest, the outer being gradually less in\r\ndiameter, except towards the hinge, which is about an inch long; and in\r\nconsequence of all the layers being united there, and prolonged into\r\nthe tube, it becomes the thickest and strongest part of the structure.\r\nThe elasticity of the materials, also, gives to this hinge the\r\nremarkable peculiarity of acting like a spring, and shutting the door\r\nof the nest spontaneously. It is, besides, made to fit so accurately to\r\nthe aperture, which is composed of similar concentric layers of web,\r\nthat it is almost impossible to distinguish the joining by the most\r\ncareful inspection. To gratify curiosity, the door has been opened and\r\nshut hundreds of times, without in the least destroying the power of\r\nthe spring. When the door is shut, it resembles some of the lichens\r\n(_Lecidea_), or the leathery fungi, such as _Polyporus versicolor_\r\n(Micheli), or, nearer still, the upper valve of a young oyster shell.\r\nThe door of the nest, the only part seen above ground, being of a\r\nblackish-brown colour, it must be very difficult to discover. (J. R.)\r\n\r\nAnother mason-spider (_Mygale cæmentaria_, Latr.), found in the south\r\nof France, usually selects for her nest a place bare of grass, sloping\r\nin such a manner as to carry off the water, and of a firm soil, without\r\nrocks or small stones. She digs a gallery a foot or two in depth, and\r\nof a diameter (equal throughout) sufficient to admit of her easily\r\npassing. She lines this with a tapestry of silk glued to the walls.\r\nThe door, which is circular, is constructed of many layers of earth\r\nkneaded, and bound together with silk. Externally, it is flat and\r\nrough, corresponding to the earth around the entrance, for the purpose,\r\nno doubt, of concealment: on the inside it is convex, and tapestried\r\nthickly with a web of fine silk. The threads of this door-tapestry are\r\nprolonged, and strongly attached to the upper side of the entrance,\r\nforming an excellent hinge, which, when pushed open by the spider,\r\nshuts again by its own weight, without the aid of spring hinges. When\r\nthe spider is at home, and her door forcibly opened by an intruder, she\r\npulls it strongly inwards, and even when half-opened often snatches it\r\nout of the hand; but when she is foiled in this, she retreats to the\r\nbottom of her den, as her last resource.[FP]\r\n\r\nRossi ascertained that the female of an allied species (_Mygale\r\nsauvagesii_, Latr.), found in Corsica, lived in one of these nests,\r\nwith a numerous posterity. He destroyed one of these doors to observe\r\nwhether a new one would be made, which it was; but it was fixed\r\nimmovably, without a hinge; the spider, no doubt, fortifying herself in\r\nthis manner till she thought she might reopen it without danger.[FQ]\r\n\r\n[The accompanying illustration shows one of these nests, which is\r\nin my own collection. It was brought from Jamaica, together with the\r\nspider that made it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe nest is nearly six inches in length, and is made of a double layer\r\nof silken web. The inner layer is yellowish, with a tinge of red,\r\nand although fine, very tough and strong. The outer layer is thick,\r\ncoarse, dark brown, and rather flaky, the dark colour being probably\r\ncaused by the earth which is mixed with it. The lid is made of eight\r\nor ten layers of coarse web, overlapping each other like the tiles of\r\na house-roof, and the entrance of the nest is formed after the same\r\nfashion. If the lid be opened, the inside of the nest is seen to be\r\nof a different make from the exterior, being greyish-white, smooth,\r\nclose-textured, and looking much like the finest kid leather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe smaller illustration shows the spider in the act of emerging from\r\nits home.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"The Rev. Revett Shepherd has often noticed, in the fen ditches of\r\nNorfolk, a very large spider (the species not yet determined) which\r\nactually forms a _raft_ for the purpose of obtaining its prey with\r\nmore facility. Keeping its station upon a ball of weeds about three\r\ninches in diameter, probably held together by slight silken cords, it\r\nis wafted along the surface of the water upon this floating island,\r\nwhich it quits the moment it sees a drowning insect. The booty thus\r\nseized it devours at leisure upon its raft, under which it retires when\r\nalarmed by any danger.\"[FR] In the spring of 1830, we found a spider on\r\nsome reeds in the Croydon Canal, which agreed in appearance with Mr.\r\nShepherd's.\r\n\r\nAmong our native spiders there are several besides this one, which, not\r\ncontented with a web like the rest of their congeners, take advantage\r\nof other materials to construct cells where, \"hushed in grim repose,\"\r\nthey \"expect their insect prey.\" The most simple of those spider-cells\r\nis constructed by a longish-bodied spider (_Aranea holosericea_,\r\nLinn.), which is a little larger than the common hunting-spider. It\r\nrolls up a leaf of the lilac or poplar, precisely in the same manner as\r\nis done by the leaf-rolling caterpillars, upon whose cells it sometimes\r\nseizes to save itself trouble, having first expelled, or perhaps\r\ndevoured, the rightful owner. The spider, however, is not satisfied\r\nwith the tapestry of the caterpillar, but always weaves a fresh set of\r\nher own, much more close and substantial.\r\n\r\nAnother spider, common in woods and copses (_Epeira quadrata?_), weaves\r\ntogether a great number of leaves to form a dwelling for herself, and\r\nin front of it she spreads her toils for entrapping the unwary insects\r\nwhich stray thither. These, as soon as caught, are dragged into her\r\nden, and stored up for a time of scarcity. Here also her eggs are\r\ndeposited and hatched in safety. When the cold weather approaches, and\r\nthe leaves of her edifice wither, she abandons it for the more secure\r\nshelter of a hollow tree, where she soon dies; but the continuation of\r\nthe species depends upon eggs, deposited in the nest before winter, and\r\nremaining to be hatched with the warmth of the ensuing summer.\r\n\r\nThe spider's den of united leaves, however, which has just been\r\ndescribed, is not always useless when withered and deserted, for the\r\ndormouse usually selects it as a ready-made roof for its nest of dried\r\ngrass. That those old spiders' dens are not accidentally chosen by the\r\nmouse, appears from the fact, that out of about a dozen mouse-nests of\r\nthis sort found during winter in a copse between Lewisham and Bromley,\r\nKent, every second or third one was furnished with such a roof. (J. R.)\r\n\r\n\r\nDiving Water-Spider.\r\n\r\nThough spiders require atmospheric air for respiration, yet one species\r\nwell known to naturalists is aquatic in its habits, and lives not\r\nonly upon the surface but below the surface of the water, contriving\r\nto carry down with it a sufficiency of air for the support of life\r\nduring a considerable period of time. Its subaqueous nest is in fact\r\na sort of diving-bell, and constitutes a secure and most ingenious\r\nhabitation. This spider does not like stagnant water, but prefers low\r\nrunning streams, canals, and ditches, where she may often be seen in\r\nthe vicinity of London and elsewhere, living in her diving-bell, which\r\nshines through the water like a little globe of silver: her singular\r\neconomy was first, we believe, described by Clerck,[FS] L. M. de\r\nLignac,[FT] and De Geer.\r\n\r\n\"The shining appearance,\" says Clerck, \"proceeds either from an\r\ninflated globule surrounding the abdomen, or from the space between\r\nthe body and the water. The spider, when wishing to inhale the air,\r\nrises to the surface, with its body still submersed, and only the part\r\ncontaining the spinneret rising just to the surface, when it briskly\r\nopens and moves its four teats. A thick coat of hair keeps the water\r\nfrom approaching or wetting the abdomen. It comes up for air about four\r\ntimes an hour or oftener, though I have good reason to suppose it can\r\ncontinue without it for several days together.\r\n\r\n\"I found in the middle of May one male and ten females, which I put\r\ninto a glass filled with water, where they lived together very quietly\r\nfor eight days. I put some duckweed (_Lemna_) into the glass to afford\r\nthem shelter, and the females began to stretch diagonal threads in\r\na confused manner from it to the sides of the glass about half-way\r\ndown. Each of the females afterwards fixed a close bag to the edge\r\nof the glass, from which the water was expelled by the air from the\r\nspinneret, and thus a cell was formed capable of containing the whole\r\nanimal. Here they remained quietly, with their abdomens in their cells,\r\nand their bodies still plunged in the water; and in a short time\r\nbrimstone-coloured bags of eggs appeared in each cell, filling it about\r\na fourth part. On the 7th of July several young ones swam out from one\r\nof the bags. All this time the old ones had nothing to eat, and yet\r\nthey never attacked one another as other spiders would have been apt to\r\ndo.\"[FU]\r\n\r\n\"These spiders,\" says De Geer, \"spin in the water a cell of strong,\r\nclosely-woven white silk, in the form of half the shell of a pigeon's\r\negg, or like a diving-bell. This is sometimes left partly above water,\r\nbut at others is entirely submersed, and is always attached to the\r\nobjects near it by a great number of irregular threads. It is closed\r\nall round, but has a large opening below, which, however, I found\r\nclosed on the 15th of December, and the spider living quietly within,\r\nwith her head downwards. I made a rent in this cell, and expelled the\r\nair, upon which the spider came out; yet, though she appeared to have\r\nbeen laid up for three months in her winter quarters, she greedily\r\nseized upon an insect and sucked it. I also found that the male as well\r\nas the female constructs a similar subaqueous cell, and during summer\r\nno less than in winter.\"[FV] We have recently kept one of these spiders\r\nfor several months in a glass of water, where it built a cell half\r\nunder water, in which it laid its eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\nCleanliness of Spiders.\r\n\r\nWhen we look at the viscid material with which spiders construct\r\ntheir lines and webs, and at the rough, hairy covering (with a few\r\nexceptions) of their bodies, we might conclude that they would be\r\nalways stuck over with fragments of the minute fibres which they\r\nproduce. This, indeed, must often happen, did they not take careful\r\nprecautions to avoid it; for we have observed that they seldom, if\r\never, leave a thread to float at random, except when they wish to form\r\na bridge. When a spider drops along a line, for instance, in order to\r\nascertain the strength of her web, or the nature of the place below\r\nher, she invariably, when she reascends, coils it up into a little\r\nball, and throws it away. Her claws are admirably adapted for this\r\npurpose, as well as for walking along the lines, as may be readily seen\r\nby a magnifying glass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Triple-clawed foot of a Spider, magnified.]\r\n\r\nThere are three claws, one of which acts as a thumb, the others being\r\ntoothed like a comb, for gliding along the lines. This structure,\r\nhowever, unfits it to walk, as flies can do, upon any upright polished\r\nsurface like glass; although the contrary[FW] is erroneously asserted\r\nby the Abbé de la Pluche. Before she can do so, she is obliged to\r\nconstruct a ladder of ropes, as Mr. Blackwell remarks,[FX] by elevating\r\nher spinneret as high as she can, and laying down a step upon which she\r\nstands to form a second, and so on; as any one may try by placing a\r\nspider at the bottom of a very clean wine-glass.\r\n\r\nThe hairs of the legs, however, are always catching bits of web and\r\nparticles of dust; but these are not suffered to remain long. Most\r\npeople may have remarked that the house-fly is ever and anon brushing\r\nits feet upon one another to rub off the dust, though we have not seen\r\nit remarked in authors that spiders are equally assiduous in keeping\r\nthemselves clean. They have, besides, a very efficient instrument in\r\ntheir mandibles or jaws, which, like their claws, are furnished with\r\nteeth; and a spider which appears to a careless observer as resting\r\nidly, in nine cases out of ten will be found slowly combing her legs\r\nwith her mandibles, beginning as high as possible on the thigh, and\r\npassing down to the claws. The flue which she thus combs off is\r\nregularly tossed away.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the house-spider (_A. domestica_), we are told in\r\nbooks, that \"she from time to time clears away the dust from her\r\nweb, and sweeps the whole by giving it a shake with her paw, so\r\nnicely proportioning the force of her blow, that she never breaks\r\nanything.\"[FY] That spiders may be seen shaking their webs in this\r\nmanner, we readily admit; though it is not, we imagine, to clear them\r\nof dust, but to ascertain whether they are sufficiently sound and\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\nWe recently witnessed a more laborious process of cleaning a web\r\nthan merely shaking it. On coming down the Maine by the steamboat\r\nfrom Frankfort, in August, 1829, we observed the geometric-net of\r\na conic-spider (_Epeira conica_, Walck.) on the framework of the\r\ndeck, and as it was covered with flakes of soot from the smoke of\r\nthe engine, we were surprised to see a spider at work on it; for, in\r\norder to be useful, this sort of net must be clean. Upon observing it\r\na little closely, however, we perceived that she was not constructing\r\na net, but dressing up an old one; though not, we must think, to save\r\ntrouble, so much as an expenditure of material. Some of the lines she\r\ndexterously stripped of the flakes of soot adhering to them; but in\r\nthe greater number, finding that she could not get them sufficiently\r\nclean, she broke them quite off, bundled them up, and tossed them over.\r\nWe counted five of these packets of rubbish which she thus threw away,\r\nthough there must have been many more, as it was some time before we\r\ndiscovered the manoeuvre, the packets being so small as not to be\r\nreadily perceived, except when placed between the eye and the light.\r\nWhen she had cleared off all the sooty lines, she began to replace them\r\nin the usual way; but the arrival of the boat at Mentz put an end to\r\nour observations. (J. R.) Bloomfield, the poet, having observed the\r\ndisappearance of these bits of ravelled web, imagined that the spider\r\nswallowed them; and even says that he observed a garden spider moisten\r\nthe pellets before swallowing them![FZ] Dr. Lister, as we have already\r\nseen, thought the spider retracted the threads within the abdomen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XIX._\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURES OF GALL-FLIES AND APHIDES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the processes which we have detailed bear some resemblance to\r\nour own operations of building with materials cemented together; but\r\nwe shall now turn our attention to a class of insect-architects, who\r\ncannot, so far as we know, be matched in prospective skill by any of\r\nthe higher orders of animals. We refer to the numerous family which\r\nhave received the name of gall-flies,--a family which, as yet, is\r\nvery imperfectly understood, their economy being no less difficult to\r\ntrace than their species is to arrange in the established systems of\r\nclassification; though the latter has been recently much improved by\r\nMr. Westwood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Small berry-shaped galls of the oak leaf, produced by\r\n_Cynips quercus folii_?]\r\n\r\nOne of the most simple and very common instances of the nests\r\nconstructed by gall-insects, may be found in abundance during the\r\nsummer, on the leaves of the rose-tree, the oak, the poplar, the willow\r\n(_Salix viminalis_), and many other trees, in the globular form of\r\na berry, about the size of a currant, and usually of a green colour,\r\ntinged with red, like a ripe Alban or Baltimore apple.\r\n\r\nWhen this psuedo-apple in miniature is cut into, it is found to be\r\nfresh, firm, juicy, and hollow in the centre, where there is either\r\nan egg or a grub safely lodged, and protected from all ordinary\r\naccidents. Within this hollow ball the egg is hatched, and the grub\r\nfeeds securely on its substance, till it prepares for its winter sleep,\r\nbefore changing into a gall-fly (_Cynips_) in the ensuing summer. There\r\nis a mystery as to the manner in which this gall-fly contrives to\r\nproduce the hollow miniature apples, each enclosing one of her eggs;\r\nand the doubts attendant upon the subject cannot, so far as our present\r\nknowledge extends, be solved, except by plausible conjecture. Our\r\nearlier naturalists were of opinion that it was the grub which produced\r\nthe galls, by eating, when newly hatched, through the cuticle of the\r\nleaf, and remaining till the juices flowing from the wound enveloped\r\nit, and acquired consistence by exposure to the air. This opinion,\r\nhowever, plausible as it appeared to be, was at once disproved by\r\nfinding unhatched eggs on opening the galls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ovipositor of Gall-fly, greatly magnified.]\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt, indeed, that the mother gall-fly makes a hole\r\nin the plant for the purpose of depositing her eggs. She is furnished\r\nwith an admirable ovipositor for that express purpose, and Swammerdam\r\nactually saw a gall-fly thus depositing her eggs, and we have recently\r\nwitnessed the same in several instances. In some of these insects\r\nthe ovipositor is conspicuously long, even when the insect is at\r\nrest; but in others, not above a line or two of it is visible, till\r\nthe belly of the insect be gently pressed. When this is done to the\r\nfly that produces the currant-gall of the oak, the ovipositor may be\r\nseen issuing from a sheath in form of a small curved needle, of a\r\nchestnut-brown colour, and of a horny substance, and three times as\r\nlong as it at first appeared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gall-fly, and mechanism of ovipositor, greatly\r\nmagnified.]\r\n\r\nWhat is most remarkable in this ovipositor is, that it is much longer\r\nthan the whole body of the insect, in whose belly it is lodged in a\r\nsheath, and, from its horny nature, it cannot be either shortened or\r\nlengthened. It is on this account that it is bent into the same curve\r\nas the body of the insect. The mechanism by which this is effected is\r\nsimilar to that of the tongue of the woodpeckers (_Picidæ_), which,\r\nthough rather short, can be darted out far beyond the beak, by means of\r\na forked bone at the root of the tongue, which is thin and rolled up\r\nlike the spring of a watch. The base of the ovipositor of the gall-fly\r\nis, in a similar way, placed near the anus, runs along the curvature of\r\nthe back, makes a turn at the breast, and then, following the curve of\r\nthe belly, appears again near where it originates. We copy from Réaumur\r\nhis accurate sketch of this remarkable structure.\r\n\r\nWith this instrument the mother gall-fly pierces the part of a plant\r\nwhich she selects, and, according to our older naturalists, \"ejects\r\ninto the cavity a drop of her corroding liquor, and immediately\r\nlays an egg or more there; the circulation of the sap being thus\r\ninterrupted, and thrown, by the poison, into a fermentation that burns\r\nthe contiguous parts and changes the natural colour. The sap, turned\r\nfrom its proper channel, extravasates and flows round the eggs, while\r\nits surface is dried by the external air, and hardens into a vaulted\r\nform.\"[GA] Kirby and Spence tell us, that the parent fly introduces\r\nher egg \"into a puncture made by her curious spiral sting, and in a\r\nfew hours it becomes surrounded with a fleshy chamber.\"[GB] M. Virey\r\nsays, the gall tubercle is produced by irritation, in the same way as\r\nan inflamed tumor in an animal body, by the swelling of the cellular\r\ntissue and the flow of liquid matter, which changes the organization,\r\nand alters the natural external form.[GC] This seems to be the received\r\ndoctrine at present in France.[GD]\r\n\r\nSprengel, speaking of the rose-willow, says, the insect in spring\r\ndeposits its eggs in the leaf buds. \"The new stimulus attracts the\r\nsap,--the type of the part becomes changed, and from the prevailing\r\nacidity of the animal juice, it happens, that in the rose and\r\nstock-shaped leaves which are pushed out, a red instead of a green\r\ncolour is evolved.\"[GE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bedeguar Gall of the Rose, produced by _Cynips rosæ_.]\r\n\r\nWithout pretending positively to state facts which are, perhaps, beyond\r\nhuman penetration, we may view the process in a rather different\r\nlight. (J. R.) Following the analogy of what is _known_ to occur in\r\nthe case of the saw-flies, after the gall-fly has made a puncture\r\nand pushed her egg into the hole, we may suppose that she covers it\r\nover with some adhesive gluten or gum, or the egg itself, as is usual\r\namong moths, &c., may be coated over with such a gluten. In either of\r\nthese two cases, the gluten will prevent the sap that flows through\r\nthe puncture from being scattered over the leaf and wasted; and the\r\nsap, being thus confined to the space occupied by the eggs, will\r\nexpand and force outwards the pellicle of gluten that confines it,\r\ntill becoming thickened by evaporation and exposure to the air, it at\r\nlength shuts up the puncture, stops the further escape of the sap, and\r\nthe process is completed. This explanation will completely account for\r\nthe globular form of the galls alluded to; that is, supposing the egg\r\nof the gall-fly to be globular, and covered or coated with a pellicle\r\nof gluten of uniform thickness, and consequently opposing uniform\r\nresistance, or rather uniform expansibility, to the sap pressing from\r\nwithin. It will also account for the remarkable uniformity in the size\r\nof the gall apples; for the punctures and the eggs being uniform in\r\nsize, and the gluten, by supposition, uniform in quantity, no more than\r\nthe same quantity of sap can escape in such circumstances.\r\n\r\nBut though this explanation appears to be plausible, it is confessedly\r\nconjectural; for though Swammerdam detected a gall-fly in the act of\r\ndepositing her eggs, he did not attend to this circumstance; and in\r\nthe instances which we have observed, some unlucky accident always\r\nprevented us from following up our observations. The indefatigable\r\nRéaumur, on one occasion, thought he would make sure of tracing the\r\nsteps of the process in the case of the gall-fly which produces the\r\nsubstance called _bedeguar_ on the wild rose-tree, and to which we\r\nshall presently advert. His plan was to enclose in a box, in which a\r\nbrood of flies had just been produced from a bedeguar, a living branch\r\nfrom a wild rose-tree; but, to his great disappointment, no eggs were\r\nlaid, and no bedeguar formed. Upon further investigation, he discovered\r\nthat the brood of flies produced from the bedeguar were not the genuine\r\nbedeguar insects at all, but one of the parasite ichneumons (_Callimone\r\nbedeguaris_, Stephens), which had surreptitiously deposited their eggs\r\nthere, in order to supply their young with the bedeguar grubs, all of\r\nwhich they appeared to have devoured. It may prove interesting to look\r\ninto the remarkable structure of the bedeguar itself, which is very\r\ndifferent from the globular galls above described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: One of the bristles of the Bedeguar of the Rose\r\nmagnified.]\r\n\r\nThe gall-fly of the willow (_Cynips viminalis_) deposits, as we have\r\njust seen, only a single egg on one spot; but the bedeguar insect lays\r\na large cluster of eggs on the extremity of a growing branch of the\r\nwild rose-tree, making, probably, a proportionate number of punctures\r\nto procure materials for the future habitation of her young progeny.\r\nAs in the former case, also, each of these eggs becomes (as we may\r\nsuppose) surrounded with the sap of the rose, enclosed in a pellicle of\r\ngluten. The gluten, however, of the bedeguar insect is not, it would\r\nappear, sufficiently tenacious to confine the flowing sap within the\r\ndimensions of any of the little clustered globes containing the eggs,\r\nfor it oozes out from numerous cracks or pores in the pellicle; which\r\ncracks or pores, however, are not large enough to admit a human hair.\r\nBut this, so far from being a defect in the glutinous pellicle of the\r\nbedeguar fly, is, as we shall presently see, of great utility. The sap\r\nwhich issues from each of these pores, instead of being evaporated and\r\nlost, shoots out into a reddish-coloured, fibrous bristle.\r\n\r\nIt is about half an inch long, and, from the natural tendency of the\r\nsap of the rose-tree to form prickles, these are all over studded with\r\nweak pricklets. The bedeguar, accordingly, when fully formed, has some\r\nresemblance, at a little distance, to a tuft of reddish-brown hair\r\nor moss stuck upon the branch. Sometimes this tuft is as large as a\r\nsmall apple, and of a rounded but irregular shape; at other times it\r\nis smaller, and in one instance mentioned by Réaumur, only a single\r\negg had been laid on a rose-leaf, and, consequently, only one tuft was\r\nproduced. Each member of the congeries is furnished with its own tuft\r\nof bristles, arising from the little hollow globe in which the egg or\r\nthe grub is lodged.\r\n\r\nThe prospective wisdom of this curious structure is admirable. The\r\nbedeguar grubs live in their cells through the winter, and as their\r\ndomicile is usually on one of the highest branches, it must be exposed\r\nto every severity of the weather. But the close, non-conducting, warm,\r\nmossy collection of bristles, with which it is surrounded, forms for\r\nthe soft, tender grubs a snug protection against the winter's cold,\r\ntill, through the influence of the warmth of the succeeding summer,\r\nthey undergo their final change into the winged state; preparatory\r\nto which they eat their way with their sharp mandibles through the\r\nwalls of their little cells, which are now so hard as to be cut with\r\ndifficulty by a knife. (J. R.)\r\n\r\nAnother structure, similar in principle, though different in\r\nappearance, is very common upon oak-trees, the termination of a branch\r\nbeing selected as best suited for the purpose. This structure is rather\r\nlarger than a filbert, and is composed of concentric leaves diverging\r\nfrom the base, and expanding upwards, somewhat like an artichoke.\r\nWhether this leafy structure is caused by a superinduced disease,\r\nas the French think, or by the form of the pores in the pellicle of\r\ngluten surrounding the eggs, or rather by the tendency of the exuding\r\nsap of the oak to form leaves, has not been ascertained; but that it\r\nis intended, as in the case of the bedeguar, to afford an efficient\r\nprotection against the weather to the included eggs or grubs, there can\r\nbe no doubt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Artichoke Gall of the Oak-bud, with Gall-fly (_Cynips\r\nquercus gemmæ_), natural size, and its ovipositor (_a_) magnified.]\r\n\r\nFrom the very nature of the process of forming willow-galls, bedeguar,\r\nand the artichoke of the oak, whatever theory be adopted, it will\r\nbe obvious that their growth must be rapid; for the thickening of\r\nthe exuded sap, which is quickly effected by evaporation, will soon\r\nobstruct and finally close the orifice of the puncture made by the\r\nparent insect. It is accordingly asserted by Réaumur and other\r\nobservers, that all the species of galls soon reach their full growth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Leafy Gall of Dyer's Broom, produced by _Cynips\r\ngenistæ_? A, gall, natural size; B, a leaflet magnified.]\r\n\r\nA very minute reddish-coloured grub feeds upon dyer's broom\r\n(_Genista_), producing a sort of gall, frequently globular, but always\r\nstudded with bristles, arising from the amorphous leaves. The stem of\r\nthe shrub passes through this ball, which is composed of a great number\r\nof leaves, shorter and broader than natural, and each rolled into the\r\nform of a horn, the point of which ends in a bristle. In the interior\r\nwe find a thick fleshy substance, serving to sustain the leaves, and\r\nalso for the nourishment of the grubs, some of which are within and\r\nsome between the leaves. They are in prodigious numbers,--hundreds\r\nbeing assembled in the small gall, and so minute as scarcely to be\r\nperceived without the aid of a magnifying glass. The bud of the plant\r\nattacked by those grubs, instead of forming a shoot, pushes out\r\nnothing but leaves, and these are all rolled, and turned round the\r\nstem. Some shrubs have several of these galls, which are of various\r\nsizes, from that of a filbert to that of a walnut.\r\n\r\nA similar but still more beautiful production is found upon one of the\r\ncommonest of our indigenous willows (_Salix purpurea_), which takes\r\nthe name of _rose-willow_, more probably from this circumstance than\r\nfrom the red colour of its twigs. The older botanists, not being aware\r\nof the cause of such excrescences, considered the plants so affected\r\nas distinct species; and old Gerard accordingly figures and describes\r\nthe rose-willow as \"not only making a gallant show, but also yielding\r\na most cooling air in the heat of summer, being set up in houses for\r\ndecking the same.\" The production in question, however, is nothing more\r\nthan the effect produced by a species of gall-fly (_Cynips salicis_)\r\ndepositing its eggs in the terminal shoot of a twig, and, like the\r\nbedeguar and the oak artichoke, causing leaves to spring out, of a\r\nshape totally different from the other leaves of the tree, and arranged\r\nvery much like the petals of a rose. Decandolle says it is found\r\nchiefly on the _Salix helix_, _S. alba_, and _S. riparia_.[GF]\r\n\r\nA production very like that of the rose-willow may be commonly met with\r\non the young shoots of the hawthorn, the growth of the shoot affected\r\nbeing stopped, and a crowded bunch of leaves formed at the termination.\r\nThese leaves, besides being smaller than natural, are studded with\r\nshort bristly prickles, from the sap (we may suppose) of the hawthorn\r\nbeing prevented from rising into a fresh shoot, and thrown out of\r\nits usual course in the formation of the arms. These bristles appear\r\nindiscriminately on both sides of the leaves, some of which are bent\r\ninwards, while others diverge in their natural manner.\r\n\r\nThis is not caused by the egg or grub of a true gall-fly, but by the\r\nsmall white tapering grub of some dipterous insect, of which we have\r\nnot ascertained the species, but which is, probably, a _cecidomyia_.\r\nEach terminal shoot is inhabited by a number of these--not lodged in\r\ncells, however, but burrowing indiscriminately among the half-withered\r\nbrown leaves which occupy the centre of the production. (J. R.)\r\n\r\nA more remarkable species of gall than any of the above we discovered,\r\nin June, 1829, on the twig of an oak in the grounds of Mr. Perkins,\r\nat Lee, in Kent. When we first saw it, we imagined that the twig was\r\nbeset with some species of the lanigerous aphides, similar to what is\r\nvulgarly called the American or white blight (_Aphis lanata_); but\r\non closer examination we discarded this notion. The twig was indeed\r\nthickly beset with a white downy, or rather woolly, substance around\r\nthe stem at the origin of the leaves, which did not appear to be\r\naffected in their growth, being well formed, healthy, and luxuriant. We\r\ncould not doubt that the woolly substance was caused by some insect;\r\nbut though we cut out a portion of it, we could not detect any egg\r\nor grub, and we therefore threw the branch into a drawer, intending\r\nto keep it as a specimen, whose history we might complete at some\r\nsubsequent period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Semi-Gall of the Hawthorn, produced by _Cecidomyia_?\r\ndrawn from a specimen.]\r\n\r\nA few weeks afterwards, on opening this drawer, we were surprised to\r\nsee a brood of several dozens of a species of gall-fly (_Cynips_),\r\nsimilar in form and size to that whose eggs cause the bedeguar of the\r\nrose, and differing only in being of a lighter colour, tending to\r\na yellowish brown. We have since met with a figure and description\r\nof this gall in Swammerdam. We may remark that the above is not the\r\nfirst instance which has occurred in our researches, of gall insects\r\noutliving the withering of the branch or leaf from which they obtain\r\ntheir nourishment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Woolly Gall of the Oak, less than the natural size,\r\ncaused by a _Cynips_, and drawn from a specimen.]\r\n\r\nThe woolly substance on the branch of the oak which we have described\r\nwas similarly constituted with the bedeguar of the rose, with this\r\ndifference, that instead of the individual cells being diffused\r\nirregularly through the mass, they were all arranged at the off-goings\r\nof the leaf-stalks, each cell being surrounded with a covering of the\r\nvegetable wool, which the stimulus of the parent egg, or its gluten,\r\nhad caused to grow, and from each cell a perfect fly had issued. We\r\nalso remarked that there were several small groups of individual cells,\r\neach of which groups was contained in a species of calyx or cup of\r\nleaf-scales, as occurs also in the well-known gall called the oak-apple.\r\n\r\nWe were anxious to watch the proceedings of these flies in the\r\ndeposition of their eggs, and the subsequent developments of the\r\ngall-growths; and endeavoured for that purpose to procure a small oak\r\nplant in a garden-pot; but we did not succeed in this: and though they\r\nalighted on rose and sweet-briar trees, which we placed in their way,\r\nwe never observed that they deposited any eggs upon them. In a week or\r\ntwo the whole brood died, or disappeared. (J. R.)\r\n\r\nThere are some galls, formed on low-growing plants, which are covered\r\nwith down, hair, or wool, though by no means so copiously as the one\r\nwhich we have just described. Among the plants so affected are the\r\ngermander speedwell, wild thyme, ground-ivy, and others to which we\r\nshall afterwards advert.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Oak-apple Galls, one being cut open to show the vessels\r\nrunning to granules.]\r\n\r\nThe well-known oak-apple is a very pretty example of the galls formed\r\nby insects; and this, when compared with other galls which form on the\r\noak, shows the remarkable difference produced on the same plant by the\r\npunctures of insects of different species. The oak-apple is commonly\r\nas large as a walnut or small apple, rounded, but not quite spherical,\r\nthe surface being irregularly depressed in various places. The skin is\r\nsmooth, and tinged with red and yellow, like a ripe apple; and at the\r\nbase there is, in the earlier part of the summer, a calyx or cup of\r\nfive or six small brown scaly leaves; but these fall off as the season\r\nadvances. If an oak-apple be cut transversely, there is brought into\r\nview a number of oval granules, each containing a grub, and embedded\r\nin a fruit-looking fleshy substance, having fibres running through\r\nit. As these fibres, however, run in the direction of the stem, they\r\nare best exhibited by a vertical section of the gall; and this also\r\nshows the remarkable peculiarity of each fibre terminating in one of\r\nthe granules, like a footstalk, or rather like a vessel for carrying\r\nnourishment. Réaumur, indeed, is of opinion that these fibres are the\r\ndiverted nervures of the leaves, which would have sprung from the bud\r\nin which the gall-fly had inserted her eggs, and actually do carry\r\nsap-vessels throughout the substance of the gall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Root Galls of the Oak, produced by _Cynips quercus\r\ninferus_? drawn from a specimen.]\r\n\r\nRéaumur says the perfect insects (_Cynips quercus_) issued from his\r\ngalls in June and the beginning of July, and were of a reddish-amber\r\ncolour. We have procured insects, agreeing with Réaumur's description,\r\nfrom galls formed on the bark or wood of the oak, at the line of\r\njunction between the root and the stem. These galls are precisely\r\nsimilar in structure to the oak-apple, and are probably formed at a\r\nseason when the fly perceives, instinctively, that the buds of the\r\nyoung branches are unfit for the purpose of nidification.\r\n\r\nThere is another oak-gall, differing little in size and appearance from\r\nthe oak-apple, but which is very different in structure, as, instead\r\nof giving protection and nourishment to a number of grubs, it is only\r\ninhabited by one. This sort of gall, besides, is hard and woody on the\r\noutside, resembling a little wooden ball of a yellowish colour, but\r\ninternally of a soft, spongy texture. The latter substance, however,\r\nencloses a small hard gall, which is the immediate residence of the\r\nincluded insect. Galls of this description are often found in clusters\r\nof from two to seven, near the extremity of a branch, not incorporated,\r\nhowever, but distinctly separate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Woody Gall on a Willow branch, drawn from a specimen.]\r\n\r\nWe have obtained a fly very similar to this from a very common gall,\r\nwhich is formed on the branches of the willow. Like the one-celled\r\ngalls just described, this is of a hard, ligneous structure, and forms\r\nan irregular protuberance, sometimes at the extremity, and sometimes\r\non the body, of a branch. But instead of one, this has a considerable\r\nnumber of cells, irregularly distributed through its substance. The\r\nstructure is somewhat spongy, but fibrous; and externally the bark is\r\nsmoother than that of the branch upon which it grows. (J. R.)\r\n\r\nThe currant-galls (as the French call them) of the oak are exactly\r\nsimilar, when formed on the leaves, to those which we have first\r\ndescribed as produced on the leaves of the willow and other trees. But\r\nthe name of currant-gall seems still more appropriate to an excrescence\r\nwhich grows on the catkins of the oak, giving them very much the\r\nappearance of a straggling branch of currants or bird-cherries. The\r\ngalls resemble currants which have fallen from the tree before being\r\nripe. These galls do not seem to differ from those formed on the\r\nleaves of the oak; and are probably the production of the same insect,\r\nwhich selects the catkin in preference, by the same instinct that the\r\noak-apple gall-fly, as we have seen, sometimes deposits its eggs in the\r\nbark of the oak near the root.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Currant Gall of the catkins of the Oak, produced by\r\n_Cynips quercus pedunculi_?]\r\n\r\nThe gall of the oak, which forms an important dye-stuff, and is used\r\nin making writing-ink, is also produced by a _Cynips_, and has been\r\ndescribed in the 'Library of Entertaining Knowledge' (Vegetable\r\nSubstances, p. 16). The employment of the _Cynips psenes_ for ripening\r\nfigs is described in the same volume, p. 244.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gall of the Hawthorn Weevil, drawn from specimen. _a_,\r\nOpened to show the grub.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGall of a Hawthorn Weevil.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1829, we found on a hawthorn at Lee, in Kent, the leaves at\r\nthe extremity of a branch neatly folded up in a bundle, but not quite\r\nso closely as is usual in the case of leaf-rolling caterpillars. On\r\nopening them, there was no caterpillar to be seen, the centre being\r\noccupied with a roundish, brown-coloured, woody substance, similar to\r\nsome excrescences made by gall-insects (_Cynips_). Had we been aware\r\nof its real nature, we should have put it immediately under a glass or\r\nin a box, till the contained insect had developed itself; but instead\r\nof this, we opened the ball, where we found a small yellowish grub\r\ncoiled up, and feeding on the exuding juices of the tree. As we could\r\nnot replace the grub in its cell, part of the walls of which we had\r\nunfortunately broken, we put it in a small pasteboard box with a fresh\r\nshoot of hawthorn, expecting that it might construct a fresh cell.\r\nThis, however, it was probably incompetent to perform: it did not at\r\nleast make the attempt, and neither did it seem to feed on the fresh\r\nbranch, keeping in preference to the ruins of its former cell. To our\r\ngreat surprise, although it was thus exposed to the air, and deprived\r\nof a considerable portion of its nourishment, both from the part of\r\nthe cell having been broken off, and from the juices of the branch\r\nhaving been dried up, the insect went through its regular changes, and\r\nappeared in the form of a small greyish-brown beetle of the weevil\r\nfamily. The most remarkable circumstance in the case in question, was\r\nthe apparent inability of the grub to construct a fresh cell after\r\nthe first was injured,--proving, we think, beyond a doubt, that it is\r\nthe puncture made by the parent insect when the egg is deposited that\r\ncauses the exudation and subsequent concretion of the juices forming\r\nthe gall. These galls were very abundant during the summer of 1830. (J.\r\nR.)\r\n\r\nA few other instances of beetles producing galls are recorded by\r\nnaturalists. Kirby and Spence have ascertained, for example, that the\r\nbumps formed on the roots of kedlock or charlock (_Sinapis arvensis_)\r\nare inhabited by the larvæ of a weevil (_Curculio contractus_, Marsham;\r\nand _Rhynchoenus assimilis_, Fabr.); and it may be reasonably supposed\r\nthat either the same or similar insects cause the clubbing of the\r\nroots of cabbages, and the knob-like galls on turnips, called in some\r\nplaces the _anbury_. We have found them also infesting the roots of\r\nthe hollyhock (_Alcea rosea_). They are evidently beetles of an allied\r\ngenus which form the woody galls sometimes met with on the leaves of\r\nthe guelder-rose (_Viburnum_), the lime-tree (_Tilia Europæa_), and the\r\nbeech (_Fagus sylvatica_).\r\n\r\nThere are also some two-winged flies which produce woody galls on\r\nvarious plants, such as the thistle-fly (_Tephritis cardui_, Latr.).\r\nThe grubs of this pretty fly produce on the leaf-stalks of thistles\r\nan oblong woody knob. On the common white briony (_Bryonia dioica_)\r\nof our hedges may be found a very pretty fly of this genus, of a\r\nyellowish-brown colour, with pellucid wings, waved much like those of\r\nthe thistle-fly with yellowish brown. This fly lays its eggs near a\r\njoint of the stem, and the grubs live upon its substance. The joint\r\nswells out into an oval form, furrowed in several places, and the\r\nfly is subsequently disclosed. In its perfect state, it feeds on\r\nthe blossom of the briony. (J. R.) Flies of another minute family,\r\nthe gall-gnats (_Cecidomyiæ_, Latr.), pass the first stage of their\r\nexistence in the small globular cottony galls which abound on germander\r\nspeedwell (_Veronica chamædrys_), wild thyme (_Thymus serpyllum_), and\r\nground-ivy (_Glechoma hederacea_). The latter is by no means uncommon,\r\nand may be readily recognised.\r\n\r\nCertain species of plant-lice (_Aphides_), whose complete history would\r\nrequire a volume, produce excrescences upon plants which may with some\r\npropriety be termed galls, or semi-galls. Some of these are without\r\nany aperture, whilst others are in form of an inflated vesicle, with\r\na narrow opening on the under side of a leaf, and expanding (for the\r\nmost part irregularly) into a rounded knob on its upper surface. The\r\nmountain-ash (_Pyrus aucuparia_) has its leaves and young shoots\r\nfrequently affected in this way, and sometimes exhibits galls larger\r\nthan a walnut or even than a man's fist; at other times they do not\r\ngrow larger than a filbert. Upon opening one of these, they are found\r\nto be filled with the _aphides sorbi_. If taken at an early stage of\r\ntheir growth, they are found open on the under side of the leaf, and\r\ninhabited only by a single female aphis, pregnant with a numerous\r\nfamily of young. In a short time the aperture becomes closed, in\r\nconsequence of the insect making repeated punctures round its edge,\r\nfrom which sap is exuded and forms an additional portion of the walls\r\nof the cell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Plant-Louse (_Aphis_), magnified.]\r\n\r\nIn this early stage of its growth, however, the gall does not, like\r\nthe galls of the cynips, increase very much in dimensions. It is after\r\nthe increase of the inhabitants by the young brood that it grows with\r\nconsiderable rapidity; for each additional insect, in order to procure\r\nfood, has to puncture the wall of the chamber and suck the juices, and\r\nfrom the punctures thus made the sap exudes, and enlarges the walls.\r\nAs those galls are closed all round in the more advanced state, it\r\ndoes not appear how the insects can ever effect an exit from their\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Galls produced on the leaves and leaf-stalks of the\r\nPoplar by _Eriosoma populi_, with the various forms of the insects,\r\nwinged, not winged, and covered with wool, both of the natural size and\r\nmagnified.]\r\n\r\nA much more common production, allied to the one just described, may\r\nbe found on the poplar in June and July. Most of our readers may have\r\nobserved, about midsummer, a small snow-white tuft of downy-looking\r\nsubstance floating about on the wind, as if animated. Those tufts\r\nof snow-white down are never seen in numbers at the same time, but\r\ngenerally single, though some dozens of them may be observed in the\r\ncourse of one day. This singular object is a four-winged fly (_Eriosoma\r\npopuli_, Leach), whose body is thickly covered with long down--a\r\ncovering which seems to impede its flight, and make it appear more\r\nlike an inanimate substance floating about on the wind, than impelled\r\nby the volition of a living animal. This pretty fly feeds upon the\r\nfresh juices of the black poplar, preferring that of the leaves and\r\nleaf-stalks, which it punctures for this purpose with its beak. It\r\nfixes itself with this design to a suitable place upon the principal\r\nnervure of the leaf, or upon the leaf-stalk, and remains in the same\r\nspot till the sap, exuding through the punctures, and thickening by\r\ncontact with the air, surrounds it with a thick fleshy wall of living\r\nvegetable substance, intermediate in texture between the wood and the\r\nleaf, being softer than the former and harder than the latter. In this\r\nsnug little chamber, secure from the intrusion of lady-birds and the\r\ngrubs of aphidivorous flies (_Syrphi_), she brings forth her numerous\r\nbrood of young ones, who immediately assist in enlarging the extent\r\nof their dwelling, by puncturing the walls. In one respect, however,\r\nthe galls thus formed differ from those of the mountain-ash just\r\ndescribed,--those of the poplar having always an opening left into some\r\npart of the cell, and usually in that portion of it which is elongated\r\ninto an obtuse beak. From this opening the young, when arrived at\r\nthe winged state, make their exit, to form new colonies; and, during\r\ntheir migrations, attract the attention of the most incurious by the\r\nsingularity of their appearance. (J. R.)\r\n\r\nOn the black poplar there may be found, later in the season than the\r\npreceding, a gall of a very different form, though, like the other, it\r\nis for the most part on the leaf-stalk. The latter sort of galls are\r\nof a spiral form; and though they are closed, they open upon slight\r\npressure, and appear to be formed of two laminæ, twisted so as to\r\nunite. It is at this opening that an aperture is formed spontaneously\r\nfor the exit of the insects, when arrived at a perfect state. In galls\r\nof this kind we find aphides, but of a different species from the\r\nlanigerous ones, which form the horn-shaped galls above described.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaf-Rolling Aphides.\r\n\r\nIt may not be improper to introduce here a brief sketch of some other\r\neffects, of a somewhat similar kind, produced on leaves by other\r\nspecies of the same family (_Aphidæ_). In all the instances of this\r\nkind which we have examined, the form which the leaf takes serves as a\r\nprotection to the insects, both from the weather and from depredators.\r\nThat there is design in it appears from the circumstance of the aphides\r\ncrowding into the embowering vault which they have formed; and we are\r\nnot quite certain whether they do not puncture certain parts of the\r\nleaf for the very purpose of making it arch over them; at least, in\r\nmany cases, such as that of the hop-fly (_Aphis humuli_), though the\r\ninsects are in countless numbers, no arching of the leaves follows.\r\nThe rose-plant louse, again (_Aphis rosæ_), sometimes arches the\r\nleaves, but more frequently gets under the protecting folds of the\r\nhalf-expanded leaf-buds. (J. R.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Leaf of the Currant-bush, bulged out by the _Aphis\r\nribis_.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most common instances of what we mean occurs on the leaves\r\nof the currant-bush, which may often be observed raised up into\r\nirregular bulgings, of a reddish-brown colour. On examining the under\r\nside of such a leaf there will be seen a crowd of small insects, some\r\nwith and some without wings, which are the _Aphides ribis_ in their\r\ndifferent stages, feeding securely and socially on the juices of the\r\nleaf.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable instance of this, however, which we have seen,\r\noccurs on the leaves of the elm, and is caused by the _Aphis ulmi_.\r\nThe edge of an elm-leaf inhabited by those aphides is rolled up in an\r\nelegant convoluted form, very much like a spiral shell; and in the\r\nembowered chamber thus formed the insects are secure from rain, wind,\r\nand partially from the depredations of carnivorous insects. One of\r\ntheir greatest enemies, the lady-bird (_Coccinella_), seldom ventures,\r\nas we have remarked, into concealed corners except in cold weather,\r\nand contrives to find food enough among the aphides which feed openly\r\nand unprotected, such as the zebra aphides of the alder (_Aphides\r\nsambuci_). The grubs, however, of the lady-bird, and also those of the\r\naphidivorous flies (_Syrphi_), may be found prying into the most secret\r\nrecesses of a leaf to prey upon the inhabitants, whose slow movements\r\ndisqualify them from effecting an escape. (J. R.)\r\n\r\nThe effect of the puncture of aphides on growing plants is strikingly\r\nillustrated in the shoots of the lime-tree and several other plants,\r\nwhich become bent and contorted on the side attacked by the insects, in\r\nthe same way that a shoot might warp by the loss of its juices on the\r\nside exposed to a brisk fire. The curvings thus effected become very\r\nadvantageous to the insects, for the leaves sprouting from the twig,\r\nwhich naturally grow at a distance from each other, are brought close\r\ntogether in a bunch, forming a kind of nosegay, that conceals all the\r\ncolour of the sprig, as well as the insects which are embowered under\r\nit, protecting them against the rain and the sun, and at the same time\r\nhiding them from observation. It is only requisite, however, where\r\nthey have formed bowers of this description, to raise the leaves, in\r\norder to see the little colony of the aphides,--or the remains of those\r\nhabitations which they have abandoned. We have sometimes observed\r\nsprigs of the lime-tree, of a thumb's thickness, portions of which\r\nresembled spiral screws; but we could not certainly have assigned the\r\ntrue cause for this twisting, had we not been acquainted with the\r\nmanner in which aphides contort the young shoots of this tree.[GG] The\r\nshoots of the gooseberry and the willow are sometimes contorted in the\r\nsame way, but not so strikingly as the shoots of the lime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shoot of the Lime-tree contorted by the punctures of the\r\n_Aphis tiliæ_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPseudo-Galls.\r\n\r\nIt may not be out of place to mention here certain anomalous\r\nexcrescences upon trees and other plants, which, though they much\r\nresemble galls, are not so distinctly traceable to the operations of\r\nany insect. In our researches after galls, we have not unfrequently\r\nmet with excrescences which so very much resemble them, that before\r\ndissection we should not hesitate to consider them as such, and\r\npredict that they formed the nidus of some species of insects. In more\r\ninstances than one we have felt so strongly assured of this, that we\r\nhave kept several specimens for some months, in nurse-boxes, expecting\r\nthat in due time the perfect insect would be disclosed.\r\n\r\nOne of these pseudo-galls occurs on the common bramble (_Rubus\r\nfruticosus_), and bears some resemblance to the bedeguar of the rose\r\nwhen old and changed by weather. It clusters round the branches in the\r\nform of irregular granules, about the size of a pea, very much crowded,\r\nthe whole excrescence being rather larger than a walnut. We expected\r\nto find this excrescence full of grubs, and were much surprised to\r\ndiscover, upon dissection, that it was only a diseased growth of the\r\nplant, caused (it might be) by the puncture of an insect, but not for\r\nthe purpose of a nidus or habitation. (J. R.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pseudo-gall of the Bramble, drawn from a specimen.]\r\n\r\nAnother sort of excrescence is not uncommon on the terminal shoots\r\nof the hawthorn. This is in general irregularly oblong, and the bark\r\nwhich covers it is of an iron colour, similar to the scoriæ of a\r\nblacksmith's forge. When dissected, we find no traces of insects, but\r\na hard, ligneous, and rather porous texture. It is not improbable that\r\nthis excrescence may originate in the natural growth of a shoot being\r\nchecked by the punctures of aphides, or of those grubs which we have\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nMany of these excrescences, however, are probably altogether\r\nunconnected with insects, and are simply hypertrophic diseases,\r\nproduced by too much nourishment, like the wens produced on animals.\r\nInstances of this may be seen at the roots of the hollyhock (_Althea\r\nrosea_) of three or four years' standing; on the stems of the elm and\r\nother trees, immediately above the root; and on the upper branches of\r\nthe birch, where a crowded cluster of twigs sometimes grows, bearing\r\nno distant resemblance to a rook's nest in miniature, and provincially\r\ncalled witch-knots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pseudo-galls of the Hawthorn, drawn from specimens.]\r\n\r\nOne of the prettiest of these pseudo-galls with which we are\r\nacquainted, is produced on the Scotch fir (_Pinus sylvestris_),\r\nby the _Aphis pini_, which is one of the largest species of our\r\nindigenous aphides. The production we allude to may be found, during\r\nthe summer months, on the terminal shoots of this tree, in the form\r\nof a small cone, much like the fruit of the tree in miniature, but\r\nwith this difference, that the fruit terminates in a point, whereas\r\nthe pseudo-gall is nearly globular. Its colour also, instead of being\r\ngreen, is reddish; but it exhibits the tiled scales of the fruit cone.\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned this the more willingly that it seems to confirm the\r\ntheory which we have hazarded respecting the formation of the bedeguar\r\nof the rose and other true galls--by which we ascribed to the sap,\r\ndiverted from its natural course by insects, a tendency to form leaves,\r\n&c., like those of the plant from which it is made to exude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pseudo-gall produced by _Aphis_ _pini_ on the Scotch\r\nfir, drawn from a specimen.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XX._\r\n\r\nANIMAL GALLS,[GH] PRODUCED BY BREEZE-FLIES AND SNAIL-BEETLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe structures which we have hitherto noticed have all been formed of\r\ninanimate materials, or at the most of growing vegetables; but those\r\nto which we shall now advert are actually composed of the flesh of\r\nliving animals, and seem to be somewhat akin to the galls already\r\ndescribed as formed upon the shoots and leaves of plants. These were\r\nfirst investigated by the accurate Vallisnieri, and subsequently by\r\nRéaumur, De Geer, and Linnæus; but the best account which has hitherto\r\nbeen given of them is by our countryman Mr. Bracey Clark, who differs\r\nessentially from his predecessors as to the mode in which the eggs are\r\ndeposited. As, in consequence of the extreme difficulty, if not the\r\nimpossibility, of personal observation, it is no easy matter to decide\r\nbetween the conflicting opinions, we shall give such of the statements\r\nas appear most plausible.\r\n\r\nThe mother breeze-fly (_Oestrus bovis_, Clark;--_Hypoderma bovis_,\r\nLatr.), which produces the tumours in cattle called _wurbles_ or\r\n_wormuls_ (_quasi_, _worm-holes_), is a two-winged insect, smaller,\r\nbut similar in appearance and colour to the carder-bee (p. 75), with\r\ntwo black bands, one crossing the shoulders and the other the abdomen,\r\nthe rest being covered with yellow hair. This fly appears to have\r\nbeen first discovered by Vallisnieri, who has given a curious and\r\ninteresting history of his observations upon its economy. \"After having\r\nread this account,\" says Réaumur, \"with sincere pleasure, I became\r\nexceedingly desirous of seeing with my own eyes what the Italian\r\nnaturalist had reported in so erudite and pleasing a manner. I did\r\nnot then imagine that it would ever be my lot to speak upon a subject\r\nwhich had been treated with so much care and elegance; but since I have\r\nenjoyed more favourable opportunities than M. Vallisnieri, it was not\r\ndifficult for me to investigate some of the circumstances better, and\r\nto consider them under a different point of view. It is not, indeed,\r\nvery wonderful to discover something new in an object, though it has\r\nbeen already carefully inspected with very good eyes, when we sit\r\ndown to examine it more narrowly, and in a more favourable position;\r\nwhile it sometimes happens, also, that most indifferent observers\r\nhave detected what had been previously unnoticed by the most skilful\r\ninterpreters of nature.\"[GI]\r\n\r\nFrom the observations made by Réaumur, he concluded that the\r\nmother-fly, above described, deposits her eggs in the flesh of the\r\nlarger animals, for which purpose she is furnished with an ovipositor\r\nof singular mechanism. We have seen that the ovipositors in the\r\ngall-flies (_Cynips_) are rolled up within the body of the insect\r\nsomewhat like the spring of a watch, so that they can be thrust out to\r\nmore than double their apparent length. To effect the same purpose,\r\nthe ovipositor of the ox-fly lengthens, by a series of sliding tubes,\r\nprecisely like an opera-glass. There are four of these tubes, as may be\r\nseen by pressing the belly of the fly till they come into view. Like\r\nother ovipositors of this sort, they are composed of a horny substance;\r\nbut the terminal piece is very different indeed from the same part in\r\nthe gall-flies, the tree-hoppers (_Cicadæ_), and the ichneumons, being\r\ncomposed of five points, three of which are longer than the other\r\ntwo, and at first sight not unlike a _fleur-de-lis_, though, upon\r\nnarrower inspection, they may be discovered to terminate in curved\r\npoints, somewhat like the claw of a cat. The two shorter pieces are\r\nalso pointed, but not curved; and by the union of the five, a tube is\r\ncomposed for the passage of the eggs.\r\n\r\nIt would be necessary, Réaumur confesses, to see the fly employ this\r\ninstrument to understand in what manner it acts, though he is disposed\r\nto consider it fit for boring through the hides of cattle. \"Whenever I\r\nhave succeeded,\" he adds, \"in seeing these insects at work, they have\r\nusually shown that they proceeded quite differently from what I had\r\nimagined; but unfortunately I have never been able to see one of them\r\npierce the hide of a cow under my eyes.\"[GJ]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ovipositor of the Breeze-fly, greatly magnified, with a\r\nclaw and part of the tube, distinct.]\r\n\r\nMr. Bracey Clark, taking another view of the matter, is decidedly\r\nof opinion that the fly does not pierce the skin of cattle with its\r\novipositor at all, but merely glues its eggs to the hairs, while the\r\ngrubs, when hatched, eat their way under the skin. If this be the\r\nfact, as is not improbable, the three curved pieces of the ovipositor,\r\ninstead of acting, as Réaumur imagined, like a centre-bit, will only\r\nserve to prevent the eggs from falling till they are firmly glued to\r\nthe hair, the opening formed by the two shorter points permitting\r\nthis to be effected. This account of the matter is rendered more\r\nplausible, from Réaumur's statement that the deposition of the egg\r\nis not attended by much pain, unless, as he adds, some very sensible\r\nnervous fibres have been wounded. According to this view, we must not\r\nestimate the pain produced by the thickness of the instrument; for the\r\nsting of a wasp, or a bee, although very considerably smaller than the\r\novipositor of the ox-fly, causes a very pungent pain. It is, in the\r\nlatter case, the poison infused by the sting, rather than the wound,\r\nwhich occasions the pain; and Vallisnieri is of opinion that the ox-fly\r\nemits some acrid matter along with her eggs, but there is no proof of\r\nthis beyond conjecture.\r\n\r\nIt ought to be remarked, however, that cattle have very thick hides,\r\nwhich are so far from being acutely sensitive of pain, that in\r\ncountries where they are put to draw ploughs and waggons, they find\r\na whip ineffectual to drive them, and have to use a goad, in form of\r\nan iron needle, at the end of a stick. Were the pain inflicted by the\r\nfly very acute, it would find it next to impossible to lay thirty or\r\nforty eggs without being killed by the strokes of the ox's tail; for\r\nthough Vallisnieri supposes that the fly is shrewd enough to choose\r\nsuch places as the tail cannot reach, Réaumur saw a cow repeatedly flap\r\nits tail upon a part full of the gall-bumps; and in another instance he\r\nsaw a heifer beat away a party of common flies from a part where there\r\nwere seven or eight gall-bumps. He concludes, therefore, with much\r\nplausibility, that these two beasts would have treated the ox-flies in\r\nthe same way, if they had given them pain when depositing their eggs.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary effects produced upon cattle, on the appearance of\r\none of these flies, would certainly lead us to conclude that the pain\r\ninflicted is excruciating. Most of our readers may recollect to have\r\nseen, in the summer months, a whole herd of cattle start off across\r\na field in full gallop, as if they were racing,--their movements\r\nindescribably awkward--their tails being poked out behind them as\r\nstraight and stiff as a post, and their necks stretched to their utmost\r\nlength. All this consternation has been known, from the earliest times,\r\nto be produced by the fly we are describing. Virgil gives a correct\r\nand lively picture of it in his Georgies,[GK] of which the following is\r\na translation, a little varied from Trapp:\r\n\r\n    Round Mount Alburnus, green with shady oaks,\r\n    And in the groves of Silarus, there flies\r\n    An insect pest (named _Oestrus_ by the Greeks,\r\n    By us _Asilus_): fierce with jarring hum\r\n    It drives, pursuing, the affrighted herd\r\n    From glade to glade; the air, the woods, the banks\r\n    Of the dried river echo their loud bellowing.\r\n\r\nHad we not other instances to adduce, of similar terror caused among\r\nsheep, deer, and horses, by insects of the same genus, which are\r\nascertained not to penetrate the skin, we should not have hesitated to\r\nconclude that Vallisnieri and Réaumur are right, and Mr. Bracey Clark\r\nwrong. In the strictly similar instance of Reindeer-fly (_Oestrus\r\ntarandi_, Linn.), we have the high authority of Linnæus for the fact,\r\nthat it lays its eggs _upon_ the skin.\r\n\r\n\"I remarked,\" he says, \"with astonishment how greatly the reindeer\r\nare incommoded in hot weather, insomuch that they cannot stand still\r\na minute, no not a moment, without changing their posture, starting,\r\npuffing and blowing continually, and all on account of a little fly.\r\nEven though amongst a herd of perhaps five hundred reindeer, there were\r\nnot above ten of those flies, every one of the herd trembled and kept\r\npushing its neighbour about. The fly, meanwhile, was trying every means\r\nto get at them; but it no sooner touched any part of their bodies, than\r\nthey made an immediate effort to shake it off. I caught one of these\r\ninsects as it was flying along with its tail protruded, which had at\r\nits extremity a small linear orifice perfectly white. The tail itself\r\nconsisted of four or five tubular joints, slipping into each other\r\nlike a pocket spying-glass, which this fly, like others, has a power of\r\ncontracting at pleasure.\"[GL]\r\n\r\nIn another work he is still more explicit. \"This well-known fly,\" he\r\nsays, \"hovers the whole day over the back of the reindeer, with its\r\ntail protruded and a little bent, upon the point of which it holds a\r\nsmall white egg, scarcely so large as a mustard-seed, and when it has\r\nplaced itself in a perpendicular position, it drops its egg, which\r\nrolls down amongst the hair to the skin, where it is hatched by the\r\nnatural heat and perspiration of the reindeer, and the grub eats its\r\nway slowly under the skin, causing a bump as large as an acorn.\"[GM]\r\nThe male and female of the reindeer breeze-fly are figured in the\r\n'Library of Entertaining Knowledge, Menageries,' vol. i. p. 405.\r\n\r\nThere is one circumstance which, though it appears to us to be of\r\nsome importance in the question, has been either overlooked or\r\nmisrepresented in books. \"While the female fly,\" say Kirby and Spence,\r\n\"is performing the operation of oviposition, the animal attempts to\r\nlash her off as it does other flies, with its tail;\"[GN] though this\r\nis not only at variance with their own words in the page but one\r\npreceding, where they most accurately describe \"the herd with their\r\ntails in the air, or turned upon their backs, or stiffly stretched out\r\nin the direction of the spine,\"[GO] but with the two facts mentioned\r\nabove from Réaumur, as well as with common observation. If the ox\r\nthen do not attempt to lash off the breeze-fly, but runs with its\r\ntail stiffly extended, it affords a strong presumption that the fly\r\nterrifies him by her buzzing (_asper_, _acerba sonans_), rather than\r\npains him by piercing his hide: her buzz, like the rattle of the\r\nrattlesnake, being instinctively understood, and intended, it may be,\r\nto prevent an over-population, by rendering it difficult to deposit the\r\neggs.\r\n\r\nThe horse breeze-fly (_Gasterophilus equi_, Leach), which produces the\r\nmaggots well known by the name of _botts_ in horses, is ascertained\r\nbeyond a doubt to deposit her eggs upon the hair; and as insects of the\r\nsame genus almost invariably proceed upon similar principles, however\r\nmuch they may vary in minute particulars, it may be inferred with\r\njustice, that the breeze-flies which produce galls do the same. The\r\ndescription given by Mr. Bracey Clark, of the proceedings of the horse\r\nbreeze-fly, is exceedingly interesting.\r\n\r\n\"When the female has been impregnated, and her eggs sufficiently\r\nmatured, she seeks among the horses a subject for her purpose, and\r\napproaching him on the wing, she carries her body nearly upright in the\r\nair, and her tail, which is _lengthened for the purpose_,[GP] curved\r\ninwards and upwards; in this way she approaches the part where she\r\ndesigns to deposit the egg; and suspending herself for a few seconds\r\nbefore it, suddenly darts upon it and leaves the egg adhering to the\r\nhair; she hardly appears to settle, but merely touches the hair with\r\nthe egg _held out on the projected point of the abdomen_.[GP] The egg\r\nis made to adhere by means of a glutinous liquor secreted with it. She\r\nthen leaves the horse at a small distance, and prepares a second egg,\r\nand poising herself before the part, deposits it in the same way. The\r\nliquor dries, and the egg becomes firmly glued to the hair: this is\r\nrepeated by these flies till four or five hundred eggs are sometimes\r\nplaced on one horse.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clark farther tells us, that the fly is careful to select a part\r\nof the skin which the horse can easily reach with his tongue, such as\r\nthe inside of the knee, or the side and back part of the shoulder.\r\nIt was at first conjectured, that the horse licks off the eggs thus\r\ndeposited, and that they are by this means conveyed into its stomach;\r\nbut Mr. Clark says, \"I do not find this to be the case, or at least\r\nonly by accident; for when they have remained on the hair four or five\r\ndays, they become ripe, after which time the slightest application of\r\nwarmth and moisture is sufficient to bring forth, in an instant, the\r\nlatent larva. At this time, if the tongue of the horse touches the egg,\r\nits operculum is thrown open, and a small, active worm is produced,\r\nwhich readily adheres to the moist surface of the tongue, and is thence\r\nconveyed with the food to the stomach.\" He adds, that \"a horse which\r\nhas no ova deposited on him may yet have botts, by performing the\r\nfriendly office of licking another horse that has.\"[GQ] The irritations\r\nproduced by common flies (_Anthomyiæ meteoricæ_, Meigen) are alleged as\r\nthe incitement to licking.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance, however, of most importance to our purpose, is the\r\nagitation and terror produced both by this fly and by another horse\r\nbreeze-fly (_Gasterophilus hæmorrhoidalis_, Leach), which deposits\r\nits eggs upon the lips of the horse as the sheep breeze-fly (_Oestrus\r\novis_) does on that of the sheep. The first of these is described\r\nby Mr. Clark as \"very distressing to the animal, from the excessive\r\ntitillation it occasions; for he immediately after rubs his mouth\r\nagainst the ground, his fore-feet, or sometimes against a tree, with\r\ngreat emotion; till, finding this mode of defence insufficient, he\r\nquits the spot in a rage, and endeavours to avoid it by galloping\r\naway to a distant part of the field, and if the fly still continues\r\nto follow and teaze him, his last resource is in the water, where the\r\ninsect is never observed to pursue him. These flies appear sometimes\r\nto hide themselves in the grass, and as the horse stoops to graze\r\nthey dart upon the mouth or lips, and are always observed to poise\r\nthemselves during a few seconds in the air, while the egg is prepared\r\n_on the extended point of the abdomen_.\"[GR]\r\n\r\nThe moment the second fly just mentioned touches the nose of a sheep,\r\nthe animal shakes its head and strikes the ground violently with its\r\nfore-feet, and at the same time holding its nose to the earth, it runs\r\naway, looking about on every side to see if the flies pursue. A sheep\r\nwill also smell the grass as it goes, lest a fly should be lying in\r\nwait, and if one be detected, it runs off in terror. As it will not,\r\nlike a horse or an ox, take refuge in the water, it has recourse to\r\na rut or dry dusty road, holding its nose close to the ground, thus\r\nrendering it difficult for the fly to get at the nostril.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _a_, The belly of the grub. _b_, Its back. _c_, The tail\r\nof the grub, greatly magnified. _d_, The bump, or gall, having its\r\nexternal aperture filled with the tail of the grub.]\r\n\r\nWhen the egg of the ox breeze-fly (_Hypoderma bovis_, Latr.) is\r\nhatched, it immediately (if Mr. Bracey Clark be correct) burrows into\r\nthe skin; while, according to Réaumur, it is hatched there. At all\r\nevents, the grub is found in a bump on the animal's back, resembling\r\na gall on a tree,--\"a place,\" says Réaumur, \"where food is found in\r\nabundance, where it is protected from the weather, where it enjoys\r\nat all times an equal degree of warmth, and where it finally attains\r\nmaturity.\"[GS] When in an advanced stage, the bumps appear much like\r\nthe swellings produced upon the forehead by a smart blow. These, with\r\nthe grubs, are represented in the foregoing figure, and also at page\r\n434.\r\n\r\nEvery bump, according to Réaumur, has in its inside a cavity, which is\r\na lodging proportionate to the size of the insect. The bump and cavity\r\nalso increase in proportion to the growth of the grub. It is not until\r\nabout the middle of May that these bumps can be seen full grown. Owing\r\nto particular circumstances, they do not all attain an equal size. The\r\nlargest of them are sixteen or seventeen lines in diameter at their\r\nbase, and about an inch high; but they are scarcely perceptible before\r\nthe beginning or during the course of the winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fly, maggot, and grub of the Ox breeze-fly, with a\r\nmicroscopic view of the maggot.]\r\n\r\nIt is commonly upon young cattle, such, namely, as are two or three\r\nyears old, that the greatest number of bumps is found; it being rare\r\nto observe them upon very old animals. The fly seems to be well aware\r\nthat such skins will not oppose too much resistance, and seems to\r\nknow, also, that tender flesh is the most proper for supplying good\r\nnourishment to its progeny. \"And why,\" asks Réaumur, \"should not the\r\ninstinct which conducts it to confide its eggs to the flesh of certain\r\nspecies only, lead it to prefer the flesh of animals of the same\r\nspecies which is most preferable?\" The number of bumps which are found\r\nupon a beast is equal to the number of eggs which have been deposited\r\nin its flesh; or, to speak more correctly, to the number of eggs which\r\nhave succeeded, for apparently all are not fertile; but this number\r\nis very different upon different cattle. Upon one cow only three or\r\nfour bumps may be observed, while upon another there will appear from\r\nthirty to forty. They are not always placed on the same parts, nor\r\narranged in the same manner: commonly, they are near the spine, but\r\nsometimes upon or near the thighs and shoulders. Sometimes they are at\r\nremote distances from each other; at other times they are so near that\r\ntheir circumferences meet. In certain places, three or four tumors may\r\nbe seen touching each other; and more than a dozen sometimes occur\r\narranged as closely together as possible.\r\n\r\nIt is very essential to the grub that the hole of the tumor should\r\nremain constantly open; for by this aperture a communication with\r\nthe air necessary for respiration is preserved; and the grub is\r\nthence placed in the most favourable position for receiving air. Its\r\nspiracles for respiration, like those of many other grubs, are situated\r\nimmediately upon the posterior extremity of the body. Now, being almost\r\nalways placed in such a situation as to have this part above, or upon a\r\nlevel with the external aperture, it is enabled to respire freely.[GT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bumps or wurbles produced on cattle by the Ox\r\nbreeze-fly.]\r\n\r\nWe have not so many examples of galls of this kind as we have of\r\nvegetable galls; and when we described the surprising varieties of\r\nthe latter, we did not perceive that it was essential to the insects\r\ninhabiting them to preserve a communication with the external air:\r\nin the galls of trees, openings expressly designed or kept free for\r\nthe admission of air are never observed. Must the grub, then, which\r\ninhabits the latter have less need of respiring air than the grub\r\nof the breeze-flies in a flesh-gall? Without doubt, not; but the\r\napertures by which the air is admitted to the inhabitants of the\r\nwoody gall, although they may escape our notice, in consequence of\r\ntheir minuteness, are not, in fact, less real. We know that, however\r\ncareful we may be in inserting a cork into a glass, the mercury with\r\nwhich it is filled is not sheltered from the action of the air, which\r\nweighs upon the cork; we know that the air passes through, and acts\r\nupon the mercury in the tube. The air can also, in the same way,\r\npenetrate through the obstruction of a gall of wood, though it have no\r\nperceptible opening or crack; but the air cannot pass in this manner so\r\nreadily through the skins and membranes of animals.\r\n\r\nIn order to see the interior of the cavity of an animal gall,\r\nRéaumur opened several, either with a razor or a pair of scissors;\r\nthe operation, however, cannot fail to be painful to the cow, and\r\nconsequently renders it impatient under the process. The grub being\r\nconfined in a tolerably large fistulous ulcer, a part of the cavity\r\nmust necessarily be filled with pus or matter. The bump is a sort of\r\ncautery, which has been opened by the insect, as issues are made by\r\ncaustic: the grub occupies this issue, and prevents it from closing.\r\nIf the pus or matter which is in the cavity, and that which is daily\r\nadded to it, had no means of escaping, each tumor would become a\r\nconsiderable abscess, in which the grub would perish; but the hole of\r\nthe bump, which admits the entrance of the air, permits the pus or\r\nmatter to escape; that pus frequently mats the hairs together which\r\nare above the small holes, and this drying around the holes acquires a\r\nconsistency, and forms in the interior of the opening a kind of ring.\r\nThis matter appears to be the only aliment allowed for the grub, for\r\nthere is no appearance that it lives, like the grubs of flesh-flies,\r\nupon putrescent meat. Mandibles, indeed, similar to those with which\r\nother grubs break their food, are altogether wanting. A beast which\r\nhas thirty, forty, or more of these bumps upon its back, would be in a\r\ncondition of great pain and suffering, terrible indeed in the extreme,\r\nif its flesh were torn and devoured by as many large grubs; but there\r\nis every appearance that they do not at all afflict, or only afflict it\r\nwith little pain. For this reason cattle most covered with bumps are\r\nnot considered by the farmer as injured by the presence of the fly,\r\nwhich generally selects those in the best condition.\r\n\r\nA fly, evidently of the same family with the preceding, is described\r\nin Bruce's 'Travels,' under the name of zimb, as burrowing during its\r\ngrub state in the hides of the elephant, the rhinoceros, the camel, and\r\ncattle. \"It resembles,\" he says, \"the gad-fly in England, its motion\r\nbeing more sudden and rapid than that of a bee. There is something\r\npeculiar in the sound or buzzing of this insect; it is a jarring noise\r\ntogether with a humming, which as soon as it is heard all the cattle\r\nforsake their food and run wildly about the plain till they die, worn\r\nout with fatigue, fright, and hunger. I have found,\" he adds, \"some of\r\nthese tubercles upon almost every elephant and rhinoceros that I have\r\nseen, and attribute them to this cause. When the camel is attacked\r\nby this fly, his body, head, and legs break out into large bosses,\r\nwhich swell, break, and putrefy, to the certain destruction of the\r\ncreature.\"[GU] That camels die under such symptoms, we do not doubt;\r\nbut we should not, without more minutely-accurate observation, trace\r\nall this to the breeze-fly.\r\n\r\nMM. Humboldt and Bonpland discovered, in South America, a species,\r\nprobably of the same genus, which attacks man himself. The perfect\r\ninsect is about the size of our common house-fly (_Musca domestica_),\r\nand the bump formed by the grub, which is usually on the belly, is\r\nsimilar to that caused by the ox breeze-fly. It requires six months to\r\ncome to maturity; and if it is irritated it eats deeper into the flesh,\r\nsometimes causing fatal inflammations.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrub Parasite in the Snail.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1829, we discovered in the hole of a garden-post,\r\nat Blackheath, one of the larger grey snail shells (_Helix aspersa_,\r\nMuller), with three white soft-bodied grubs burrowing in the body of\r\nthe snail. They evidently, from their appearance, belonged to some\r\nspecies of beetle, and we carefully preserved them in order to watch\r\ntheir economy. It appeared to us that they had attacked the snail\r\nin its stronghold while it was laid up torpid for the winter; for\r\nmore than half of the body was already devoured. They constructed\r\nfor themselves little cells attached to the inside of the shell, and\r\ncomposed of a sort of fibrous matter, having no distant resemblance\r\nto shag tobacco, both in form and smell, and which could be nothing\r\nelse than the remains of the snail's body. Soon after we took them,\r\nappearing to have devoured all that remained of the poor snail, we\r\nfurnished them with another, which they devoured in the same manner.\r\nThey formed a cocoon of the same fibrous materials during the autumn,\r\nand in the end of October appeared in their perfect form, turning out\r\nto be _Drilus flavescens_, the grub of which was first discovered in\r\nFrance in 1824. The time of their appearance, it may be remarked,\r\ncoincides with the period when snails become torpid. (J. R.)\r\n\r\nIn the following autumn, we found a shell of the same species with a\r\nsmall pupa-shaped egg deposited on the lid. From this a caterpillar was\r\nhatched, which subsequently devoured the snail, spun a cocoon within\r\nthe shell, and was transformed into a small moth (of which we have not\r\nascertained the species) in the spring of 1830.\r\n\r\n[Before concluding the account of the parasite insects, it will be\r\nnecessary to mention two of our British Ichneumonidæ, which not\r\nonly deposit their eggs in the larvæ of other insects, but make for\r\nthemselves cells of very beautiful structure. In the accompanying\r\nillustration are shown the cells of one of our commonest and most\r\nuseful ichneumonidæ (_Microgaster glomeratus_), together with the\r\ninsect itself. At Fig. 1_a_ (p. 438) is shown the little insect of the\r\nnatural size, and the same is given at 1 much magnified.\r\n\r\nThis creature lays its eggs in the body of the cabbage caterpillar,\r\nforty or fifty eggs being deposited in the same larva. They soon hatch\r\ninto little transparent grubs, which lie under the skin, and live on\r\nthe fatty parts of the caterpillar, which continues to grow, and seems\r\nto thrive, whereas its bulk is largely made up of the ichneumon larvæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Microgaster glomeratus.]\r\n\r\nAfter the caterpillar ceases from feeding, it crawls aside for the\r\npurpose of assuming the pupal state. But, before it can do so, the\r\nichneumon larvæ, which have also ceased from feeding, burst their way\r\nthrough the sides of the caterpillar, and immediately begin to spin\r\ntheir cocoon. These are oval, very small, and covered with yellow silk.\r\nA group of these cocoons is shown at Fig. 3. The innumerable fibres\r\nof these cocoons hamper the caterpillars so much that, in most cases,\r\nit seldom is able to stir from the spot, but dies in the midst of its\r\nenemies. Groups of these yellow cocoons can be found in every wall\r\nor paling near cabbage gardens. In a few days, the larvæ have passed\r\nthrough their pupal stage, assuming the winged state, and emerge from\r\nthe cocoons through little circular doors, as seen in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\nOur second illustration represents another species, _Microgaster\r\nalveolarius_, together with its cocoons. As before, the insect is shown\r\nof its natural size at la, and magnified at 1. The preliminary life of\r\nthis insect is exactly the same as that of the preceding; but, instead\r\nof making a number of independent and separate cocoons, the insects\r\nspin so closely together that they form an edifice very much resembling\r\na bee-comb. Fig. 5 represents one of these cell-groups of the natural\r\nsize, and the edge of another group is shown at Fig. 4. A longitudinal\r\nsection, slightly enlarged, is given at 3, in order to show the\r\nhexagonal shape assumed by the aggregated cells; and Fig. 2 shows the\r\nlittle lids which open to give egress to the insect. All these figures\r\nare drawn from specimens in my collection.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Microgaster alveolarius.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LONDON: PRINTED BY W.

Hist. 1839, p. 458, Mr. Shuckard gives\r\nan account of the nest of a wasp, which he regards as _Vespa\r\nBritannica_,--remarkable for the material of which it was constructed,\r\nand for the locality in which it was found. This nest, which was\r\nexhibited at a meeting of the Entomological Society, was found near\r\nCroydon, built in a sparrow's nest, and attached to the lining\r\nfeathers. \"The smallness of the nest,\" says Mr. Shuckard, \"and also\r\nof the tier of cells, as well as the peculiar material of which it\r\nappeared composed, led to a discussion, the tendency of which seemed to\r\nsupport the opinion that it was most probably the nest of a _Polistes_,\r\na social-wasp not yet found in this country, but if not of _Polistes_,\r\ncertainly not yet determined or known.\" The nest was ovate, about an\r\ninch and a half long, with a tier of cells internally, originating from\r\na common pedicle. It appeared to be constructed \"of the agglutinated\r\nparticles of a soft white wood, probably willow, very imperfectly\r\ntriturated;\" whence it had externally a rough granulated appearance. It\r\nwas sprinkled with black specks, arising perhaps from the intermixture\r\nof more decayed portions of the wood; and was of a very fragile\r\ntexture. \"The nature of the material, and its unfinished execution, as\r\nwell as the situation in which it was found, appear to me to be its own\r\npeculiarities, and I must necessarily consider it merely an accidental\r\nvariation in material and locality from the usual nests of the _Vespa\r\nBritannica_ of Leach.\"\r\n\r\n[Y] Mémoires sur les Insectes, tom. vi., mem. vii.

In order to see their operations, they must\r\nbe kept in confinement, particularly in boxes with glazed doors,\r\nwhere they may be always under the eye of the naturalist. In such\r\ncircumstances, however, we may be ignorant what building materials we\r\nought to provide them with for their structures. A red caterpillar,\r\nwith a few tufts of hair, which Réaumur found in July feeding upon\r\nthe flower bunches of the nettle, and refusing to touch the leaves,\r\nbegan in a few days to prepare its cocoon, by gnawing the paper lid\r\nof the box in which it was placed. This, of course, was a material\r\nwhich it could not have procured in the fields, but it was the nearest\r\nin properties that it could procure; for, though it had the leaves\r\nand stems of nettles, it never used a single fragment of either. When\r\nRéaumur found that it was likely to gnaw through the paper lid of the\r\nbox, and might effect its escape, he furnished it with bits of rumpled\r\npaper, fixed to the lid by means of a pin; and these it chopped down\r\ninto such pieces as it judged convenient for its structure, which\r\nit took a day to complete. The moth appeared four weeks after, of a\r\nbrownish-black colour, mottled with white, or rather grey, in the\r\nmanner of lace.\r\n\r\nBonnet also mentions more than one instance in which he observed\r\ncaterpillars making use of paper, when they could not procure other\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\n[BP] Kirby, in 'Linn.
