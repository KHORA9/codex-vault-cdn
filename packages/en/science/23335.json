They had cased the job\r\nthoroughly, and they had built the equipment to take care of it. Their\r\nmistake was not in their planning; it was in not taking Mike the Angel\r\ninto account.\r\n\r\nThere is a section of New York's Manhattan Island, down on the lower\r\nWest Side, that has been known, for over a century, as \"Radio Row.\" All\r\nthrough this section are stores, large and small, where every kind of\r\nelectronic and sub-electronic device can be bought, ordered, or designed\r\nto order. There is even an old antique shop, known as Ye Quainte Olde\r\nElecktronicks Shoppe, where you can buy such oddities as vacuum-tube FM\r\nradios and twenty-four-inch cathode-ray television sets. And, if you\r\nwant them, transmitters to match, so you can watch the antiques work.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel had an uptown office in the heart of the business\r\ndistrict, near West 112th Street--a very posh suite of rooms on the\r\nfiftieth floor of the half-mile-high Timmins Building, overlooking the\r\ntwo-hundred-year-old Gothic edifice of the Cathedral of St. John the\r\nDivine. The glowing sign on the door of the suite said, very simply:\r\n\r\n  M. R. GABRIEL\r\n  POWER DESIGN\r\n\r\nBut, once or twice a week, Mike the Angel liked to take off and prowl\r\naround Radio Row, just shopping around. Usually, he didn't work too\r\nlate, but, on this particular afternoon, he'd been in his office until\r\nafter six o'clock, working on some papers for the Interstellar\r\nCommission. So, by the time he got down to Radio Row, the only shop left\r\nopen was Harry MacDougal's.\r\n\r\nThat didn't matter much to Mike the Angel, since Harry's was the place\r\nhe had intended to go, anyway. Harry MacDougal's establishment was\r\nhardly more than a hole in the wall--a narrow, long hallway between two\r\nlarger stores. Although not a specialist, like the proprietor of Ye\r\nQuainte Olde Elecktronicks Shoppe, Harry did carry equipment of every\r\nvintage and every make. If you wanted something that hadn't been\r\nmanufactured in decades, and perhaps never made in quantity, Harry's was\r\nthe place to go. The walls were lined with bins, all unlabeled, filled\r\nhelter-skelter with every imaginable kind of gadget, most of which would\r\nhave been hard to recognize unless you were both an expert and a\r\nhistorian.\r\n\r\nOld Harry didn't need labels or a system. He was a small, lean, bony,\r\nsharp-nosed Scot who had fled Scotland during the Panic of '37, landed\r\nin New York, and stopped. He solemnly declared that he had never been\r\nwest of the Hudson River nor north of 181st Street in the more than\r\nfifty years he had been in the country. He had a mind like that of a\r\nrobot filing cabinet. Ask him for a particular piece of equipment, and\r\nhe'd squint one eye closed, stare at the end of his nose with the other,\r\nand say:\r\n\r\n\"An M-1993 thermodyne hexode, eh? Ah. Um. Aye, I got one. Picked it up a\r\ncouple years back. Put it-- Let ma see, now....\"\r\n\r\nAnd he'd go to his wall ladder, push it along that narrow hallway,\r\nmoving boxes aside as he went, and stop somewhere along the wall. Then\r\nhe'd scramble up the ladder, pull out a bin, fumble around in it, and\r\ncome out with the article in question. He'd blow the dust off it, polish\r\nit with a rag, scramble down the ladder, and say: \"Here 'tis. Thought I\r\nhad one. Let's go back in the back and give her a test.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if he didn't have what you wanted, he'd shake his\r\nhead just a trifle, then squint up at you and say: \"What d'ye want it\r\nfor?\" And if you could tell him what you planned to do with the piece\r\nyou wanted, nine times out of ten he could come up with something else\r\nthat would do the job as well or better.\r\n\r\nIn either case, he always insisted that the piece be tested. He refused\r\neither to buy or sell something that didn't work. So you'd follow him\r\ndown that long hallway to the lab in the rear, where all the testing\r\nequipment was. The lab, too, was cluttered, but in a different way. Out\r\nfront, the stuff was dead; back here, there was power coursing through\r\nthe ionic veins and metallic nerves of the half-living machines. Things\r\nwere labeled in neat, accurate script--not for Old Harry's benefit, but\r\nfor the edification of his customers, so they wouldn't put their fingers\r\nin the wrong places. He never had to worry about whether his customers\r\nknew enough to fend for themselves; a few minutes spent in talking was\r\nenough to tell Harry whether a man knew enough about the science and art\r\nof electronics and sub-electronics to be trusted in the lab. If you\r\ndidn't measure up, you didn't get invited to the lab, even to watch a\r\ntest.\r\n\r\nBut he had very few people like that; nobody came into Harry MacDougal's\r\nplace unless he was pretty sure of what he wanted and how he wanted to\r\nuse it.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there were very few men whom Harry would allow into\r\nthe lab unescorted. Mike the Angel was one of them.\r\n\r\nMeet Mike the Angel. Full name: Michael Raphael Gabriel. (His mother had\r\ntagged that on him at the time of his baptism, which had made his father\r\nwince in anticipated compassion, but there had been nothing for him to\r\nsay--not in the middle of the ceremony.)\r\n\r\nNaturally, he had been tagged \"Mike the Angel.\" Six feet seven. Two\r\nhundred sixty pounds. Thirty-four years of age. Hair: golden yellow.\r\nEyes: deep blue. Cash value of holdings: well into eight figures.\r\nCredit: almost unlimited. Marital status: highly eligible, if the right\r\nwoman could tackle him.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel pushed open the door to Harry MacDougal's shop and took\r\noff his hat to brush the raindrops from it. Farther uptown, the streets\r\nwere covered with clear plastic roofing, but that kind of comfort\r\nstopped at Fifty-third Street.\r\n\r\nThere was no one in sight in the long, narrow store, so Mike the Angel\r\nlooked up at the ceiling, where he knew the eye was hidden.\r\n\r\n\"Harry?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I see you, lad,\" said a voice from the air. \"You got here just in time.\r\nI'm closin' up. Lock the door, would ye?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, Harry.\" Mike turned around, pressed the locking switch, and heard\r\nit snap satisfactorily.\r\n\r\n\"Okay, Mike,\" said Harry MacDougal's voice. \"Come on back. I hope ye\r\nbrought that bottle of scotch I asked for.\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel made his way back between the towering tiers of bins as\r\nhe answered. \"Sure did, Harry. When did I ever forget you?\"\r\n\r\nAnd, as he moved toward the rear of the store, Mike the Angel casually\r\nreached into his coat pocket and triggered the switch of a small but\r\nfantastically powerful mechanism that he always carried when he walked\r\nthe streets of New York at night.\r\n\r\nHe was headed straight into trouble, and he knew it. And he hoped he was\r\nready for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nMike the Angel kept his hand in his pocket, his thumb on a little plate\r\nthat was set in the side of the small mechanism that was concealed\r\ntherein. As he neared the door, the little plate began to vibrate,\r\nmaking a buzz which could only be felt, not heard. Mike sighed to\r\nhimself. Vibroblades were all the rage this season.\r\n\r\nHe pushed open the rear door rapidly and stepped inside. It was just\r\nwhat he'd expected. His eyes saw and his brain recorded the whole scene\r\nin the fraction of a second before he moved. In that fraction of a\r\nsecond, he took in the situation, appraised it, planned his strategy,\r\nand launched into his plan of action.\r\n\r\nHarry MacDougal was sitting at his workbench, near the controls of the\r\neye that watched the shop when he was in the lab. He was hunched over a\r\nlittle, his small, bright eyes peering steadily at Mike the Angel from\r\nbeneath shaggy, silvered brows. There was no pleading in those\r\neyes--only confidence.\r\n\r\nNext to Old Harry was a kid--sixteen, maybe seventeen. He had the JD\r\nstamp on his face: a look of cold, hard arrogance that barely concealed\r\nthe uncertainty and fear beneath. One hand was at Harry's back, and\r\nMike knew that the kid was holding a vibroblade at the old man's spine.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the buzzing against his thumb told Mike the Angel\r\nsomething else. There was a vibroblade much nearer his body than the one\r\nin the kid's hand.\r\n\r\nThat meant that there was another young punk behind him.\r\n\r\nAll this took Mike the Angel about one quarter of a second to\r\nassimilate. Then he jumped.\r\n\r\nHad the intruders been adults, Mike would have handled the entire\r\nsituation in a completely different way. Adults, unless they are\r\nmentally or emotionally retarded, do not usually react or behave like\r\nchildren. Adolescents can, do, and _must_--for the very simple reason\r\nthat they have not yet had time to learn to react as adults.\r\n\r\nHad the intruders been adults, and had Mike the Angel behaved the way he\r\ndid, he might conceivably have died that night. As it was, the kids\r\nnever had a chance.\r\n\r\nMike didn't even bother to acknowledge the existence of the punk behind\r\nhim. He leaped, instead, straight for the kid in the dead-black suède\r\nzipsuit who was holding the vibroblade against Harry MacDougal's spine.\r\nAnd the kid reacted exactly as Mike the Angel had hoped, prayed, and\r\npredicted he would.\r\n\r\nThe kid defended himself.\r\n\r\nAn adult, in a situation where he has one known enemy at his mercy and\r\nis being attacked by a second, will quickly put the first out of the way\r\nin order to leave himself free to deal with the second. There is no\r\nsense in leaving your flank wide open just to oppose a frontal attack.\r\n\r\nIf the kid had been an adult, Harry MacDougal would have died there and\r\nthen. An adult would simply have slashed his vibroblade through the old\r\nman's spine and brought it to bear on Mike the Angel.\r\n\r\nBut not the kid. He jumped back, eyes widening, to face his oncoming\r\nopponent in an open space. He was no coward, that kid, and he knew how\r\nto handle a vibroblade. In his own unwise, suicidal way, he was\r\nperfectly capable of proving himself. He held out the point of that\r\nshimmering metal shaft, ready to parry any offensive thrust that Mike\r\nthe Angel might make.\r\n\r\nIf Mike had had a vibroblade himself, and if there hadn't been another\r\npunk at his back, Mike might have taken care of the kid that way. As it\r\nwas, he had no choice but to use another way.\r\n\r\nHe threw himself full on the point of the scintillating vibroblade.\r\n\r\nA vibroblade is a nasty weapon. Originally designed as a surgeon's tool,\r\nits special steel blade moves in and out of the heavy hilt at speeds\r\nfrom two hundred to two thousand vibrations per second, depending on the\r\nsize and the use to which it is to be put. Make it eight inches long,\r\nadd serrated, diamond-pointed teeth, and you have the man-killing\r\nvibroblade. Its danger is in its power; that shivering blade can cut\r\nthrough flesh, cartilage, and bone with almost no effort. It's a knife\r\nwith power steering.\r\n\r\nBut that kind of power can be a weakness as well as a strength.\r\n\r\nThe little gadget that Mike the Angel carried did more than just detect\r\nthe nearby operation of a vibroblade. It was also a defense. The gadget\r\nfocused a high-density magnetic field on any vibroblade that came\r\nanywhere within six inches of Mike's body.\r\n\r\nIn that field, the steel blade simply couldn't move. It was as though it\r\nhad been caught in a vise. The blade no longer vibrated; it had become\r\nnothing more than an overly fancy bread knife.\r\n\r\nThe trouble was that the power unit in the heavy hilt simply wouldn't\r\naccept the fact that the blade was immovable. That power unit was in\r\nthere to move something, and by heaven, _something_ had to move.\r\n\r\nThe hilt jerked and bucked in the kid's hand, taking skin with it. Then\r\nit began to smoke and burn under the overload. The plastic shell cracked\r\nand hot copper and silver splattered out of it. The kid screamed as the\r\nmolten metal burned his hand.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel put a hand against the kid's chest and shoved. As the boy\r\ntoppled backward, Mike turned to face the other boy.\r\n\r\nOnly it wasn't a boy.\r\n\r\nShe was wearing gold lip paint and had sprayed her hair blue, but she\r\nknew how to handle a vibroblade at least as well as her boy friend had.\r\nJust as Mike the Angel turned, she lunged forward, aiming for the small\r\nof his back.\r\n\r\nAnd she, too, screamed as she lost her blade in a flash of heat.\r\n\r\nThen she grabbed for something in her pocket. Regretfully, Mike the\r\nAngel brought the edge of his hand down against the side of her neck in\r\na paralyzing, but not deadly, rabbit punch. She dropped, senseless, and\r\na small gun spilled out of the waist pocket of her zipsuit and skittered\r\nacross the floor. Mike paused only long enough to make sure she was out,\r\nthen he turned back to his first opponent.\r\n\r\nAs he had anticipated, Harry MacDougal had taken charge. The kid was\r\nsprawled flat on the floor, and Old Harry was holding a shock gun in his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel took a deep breath.\r\n\r\n\"Yer trousers are on fire,\" said Harry.\r\n\r\nMike yelped as he felt the heat, and he began slapping at the smoldering\r\nspots where the molten metal from the vibroblades had hit his clothing.\r\nHe wasn't afire; modern clothing doesn't flame up--but it can get pretty\r\nhot when you splash liquid copper on it.\r\n\r\n\"Damn!\" said Mike the Angel. \"New suit, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a fast thinker, laddie,\" said Old Harry.\r\n\r\n\"You don't need to flatter me, Harry,\" said Mike the Angel. \"When an old\r\nteetotaler like you asks a man if he's brought some scotch, the man's a\r\nfool if he doesn't know there's trouble afoot.\" He gave his leg a final\r\nslap and said: \"What happened? Are there any more of them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't know. Might be.\" The old man waved at his control panel. \"My\r\ninstruments are workin' again!\" He gestured at the floor. \"I'm nae sure\r\nhow they did it, but somehow they managed to blank out ma instruments\r\njust long enough to get inside. Their mistake was in not lockin' the\r\nfront door.\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel was busy searching the two unconscious kids. He looked\r\nup. \"Neither of them is carrying any equipment in their clothing--at\r\nleast, not anything that's self-powered. If they've got pickup circuits\r\nbuilt into the cloth, there must be more of them outside.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye. Likely. We'll see.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly, there was a soft _ping! ping! ping!_ from an instrument on the\r\nbench.\r\n\r\nHarry glanced quickly at the receiving screen that was connected with\r\nthe multitude of eyes that were hidden around the area of his shop. Then\r\na smile came over his small brown face.\r\n\r\n\"Cops,\" he said. \"Time they got here.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nSergeant Cowder looked the room over and took a drag from his cigarette.\r\n\"Well, that's that. Now--what happened?\" He looked from Mike the Angel\r\nto Harry MacDougal and back again. Both of them appeared to be thinking.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" he said quietly, \"let me guess, then.\"\r\n\r\nOld Harry waved a hand. \"Oh no, Sergeant; 'twon't be necessary. I think\r\nMr. Gabriel was just waiting for me to start, because he wasn't here\r\nwhen the two rapscallions came in, and I was just tryin' to figure out\r\nwhere to begin. We're not bein' unco-operative. Let's see now--\" He\r\ngazed at the ceiling as though trying to collect his thoughts. He knew\r\nperfectly well that the police sergeant was recording everything he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant sighed. \"Look, Harry, you're not on trial. I know perfectly\r\nwell that you've got this place bugged to a fare-thee-well. So does\r\nevery shop operator on Radio Row. If you didn't, the JD gangs would have\r\ncleaned you all out long ago.\"\r\n\r\nHarry kept looking at the ceiling, and Mike the Angel smiled quietly at\r\nhis fingernails.\r\n\r\nThe detective sergeant sighed again. \"Sure, we'd like to have some of\r\nthe gadgets that you and the other operators on the Row have worked out,\r\nHarry. But I'm in no position to take 'em away from you. Besides, we\r\nhave some stuff that you'd like to have, too, so that makes us pretty\r\nmuch even. If we started confiscating illegal equipment from you, the\r\nJD's would swoop in here, take your legitimate equipment, bug it up, and\r\nthey'd be driving us all nuts within a week. So long as you don't use\r\nillegal equipment illegally, the department will leave you alone.\"\r\n\r\nOld Harry grinned. \"Well, now, that's very nice of you, Sergeant. But I\r\ndon't have anything illegal--no robotics stuff or anything like that.\r\nOh, I'll admit I've a couple of eyes here and there to watch my shop,\r\nbut eyes aren't illegal.\"\r\n\r\nThe detective glanced around the room with a practiced eye and then\r\nlooked blandly back at the little Scotsman. Harry MacDougal was lying,\r\nand the sergeant knew it. And Harry knew the sergeant knew it.\r\n\r\nSergeant Cowder sighed for a third time and looked at the Scot. \"Okay.\r\nSo what happened?\"\r\n\r\nHarry's face became serious. \"They came in about six-thirty. First I\r\nknew of it, one of the kids--the boy--stepped out of that closet over\r\nthere and put a vibroblade at my back. I'd come back here to get a small\r\nresistor, and all of a sudden there he was.\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel frowned, but he didn't say anything.\r\n\r\n\"None of your equipment registered anything?\" asked the detective.\r\n\r\n\"Not a thing, Sergeant,\" said Harry. \"They've got something new, all\r\nright. The kid must ha' come in through the back door, there. And I'd\r\nha' been willin' to bet ma life that no human bein' could ha' walked in\r\nhere without ma knowin' it before he got within ten feet o' that door.\r\nLook.\"\r\n\r\nHe got up, walked over to the back door, and opened it. It opened into\r\nwhat looked at first to be a totally dark room. Then the sergeant saw\r\nthat there was a dead-black wall a few feet from the open door.\r\n\r\n\"That's a light trap,\" said Harry. \"Same as they have in photographic\r\ndarkrooms. To get from this door to the outer door that leads into the\r\nalley, you got to turn two corners and walk about thirty feet. Even I,\r\nmasel', couldn't walk through it without settin' off half a dozen\r\nalarms. Any kind of light would set off the bugs; so would the heat\r\nradiation from the human body.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about the front?\" Sergeant Cowder asked. \"Anyone could get in from\r\nthe front.\"\r\n\r\nHarry's grin became grim. \"Not unless I go with 'em. And not even then\r\nif I don't want 'em to.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was kind of you to let us in,\" said the detective mildly.\r\n\r\n\"A pleasure,\" said Harry. \"But I wish I knew how that kid got in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he did--somehow,\" Cowder said. \"What happened after he came out\r\nof the closet?\"\r\n\r\n\"He made me let the girl in. They were goin' to open up the rear\r\ncompletely and take my stuff out that way. They'd ha' done it, too, if\r\nMr. Gabriel hadn't come along.\"\r\n\r\nDetective Sergeant Cowder looked at Mike the Angel. \"About what time was\r\nthat, Mr. Gabriel?\"\r\n\r\n\"About six thirty-five,\" Mike told him. \"The kids probably hadn't been\r\nhere more than a few minutes.\"\r\n\r\nHarry MacDougal nodded in silent corroboration.\r\n\r\n\"Then what happened?\" asked the detective.\r\n\r\nMike told him a carefully edited version of what had occurred, leaving\r\nout the existence of the little gadget he was carrying in his pocket.\r\nThe sergeant listened patiently and unbelievingly through the whole\r\nrecital. Mike the Angel grinned to himself; he knew what part of the\r\nstory seemed queer to the cop.\r\n\r\nHe was right. Cowder said: \"Now, wait a minute. What caused those\r\nvibroblades to burn up that way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Must have been faulty,\" Mike the Angel said innocently.\r\n\r\n\"Both of them?\" Sergeant Cowder asked skeptically. \"At the same time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no. Thirty seconds apart, I'd guess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very interesting. Very.\" He started to say something else, but a\r\nuniformed officer stuck his head in through the doorway that led to the\r\nfront of the shop.\r\n\r\n\"We combed the whole area, Sergeant. Not a soul around. But from the\r\nlooks of the alley, there must have been a small truck parked in there\r\nnot too long ago.\"\r\n\r\nCowder nodded. \"Makes sense. Those JD's wouldn't have tried this unless\r\nthey intended to take everything they could put their hands on, and they\r\ncertainly couldn't have put all this in their pockets.\" He rubbed one\r\nbig finger over the tip of his nose. \"Okay, Barton, that's all. Take\r\nthose two kids to the hospital and book 'em in the detention ward. I\r\nwant to talk to them when they wake up.\"\r\n\r\nThe cop nodded and left.\r\n\r\nSergeant Cowder looked back at Harry. \"Your alarm to the precinct\r\nstation went off at six thirty-six. I figure that whoever was on the\r\noutside, in that truck, knew something had gone wrong as soon as the\r\nfight started in here. He--or they--shut off whatever they were using to\r\nsuppress the alarm system and took off before we got here. They sure\r\nmust have moved fast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Must have,\" agreed Harry. \"Is there anything else, Sergeant?\"\r\n\r\nCowder shook his head. \"Not right now. I'll get in touch with you later,\r\nif I need you.\"\r\n\r\nHarry and Mike the Angel followed him through the front of the shop to\r\nthe front door. At the door, Cowder turned.\r\n\r\n\"Well, good night. Thanks for your assistance, Mr. Gabriel. I wish some\r\nof our cops had had your luck.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so?\" asked Mike the Angel.\r\n\r\n\"If more vibroblades would blow up at opportune moments, we'd have fewer\r\nbutchered policemen.\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel shook his head. \"Not really. If their vibros started\r\nburning out every time they came near a cop, the JD's would just start\r\nusing something else. You can't win in this game.\"\r\n\r\nCowder nodded glumly. \"It's a losing proposition any way you look at\r\nit.... Well, good night again.\" He stepped out, and Old Harry closed and\r\nlocked the door behind him.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel said: \"Come on, Harry; I want to find something.\" He\r\nbegan walking back down the long, narrow shop toward the rear again.\r\nHarry followed, looking mystified.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel stopped, sniffing. \"Smell that?\"\r\n\r\nHarry sniffed. \"Aye. Burnt insulation. So?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know which one of these bins is nearest to your main control cable.\r\nStart looking. See if you find anything queer.\"\r\n\r\nOld Harry walked over to a nearby bin, pulled it open, and looked\r\ninside. He closed it, pulled open another. He found the gadget on the\r\nthird try. It was a plastic case, six by six by eight, and it still\r\nsmelled of hot insulation, although the case itself was barely warm.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" Harry asked in wonder.\r\n\r\n\"It's the gizmo that turned your equipment off. When I passed by it, my\r\nown gadget must have blown it. I knew the police couldn't have made it\r\nhere between the time of the fight and the time they showed up. They\r\nmust have had at least an extra minute. Besides, I didn't think anyone\r\ncould build an instrument that would blank out everything at long range.\r\nIt had to be something near your main cable. I think you'll find a\r\nmetallic oscillator in there. Analyze it. Might be useful.\"\r\n\r\nHarry turned the box over in his hands. \"Probably has a timer in it to\r\nstart it.... Well.... That helps.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got a pretty good idea who put it here. Older kid. Nineteen--maybe\r\ntwenty. Seemed like a nice lad, too. Didn't take him for a JD. Can't\r\ntrust anyone these days. Thanks, Mike. If I find anything new in here,\r\nI'll let you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do that,\" said Mike the Angel. \"And, as a personal favor, I'll show you\r\nhow to build my own super-duper, extra-special, anti-vibroblade defense\r\nunit.\"\r\n\r\nOld Harry grinned, crinkling up his wizened face in a mass of fine\r\nwrinkles. \"You'd better think up a shorter name than that for it,\r\nladdie; I could probably build one in less time than it takes you to say\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Want to bet?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll bet you twenty I can do it in twenty-four hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty it is, Harry. I'll sell you mine this time tomorrow for twenty\r\nbucks.\"\r\n\r\nHarry shook his head. \"I'll trade you mine for yours, plus twenty.\" Then\r\nhis eyes twinkled. \"And speaking of money, didn't you come down here to\r\nbuy something?\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel laughed. \"You're not going to like it. I came down to get\r\na dozen plastic-core resistors.\"\r\n\r\n\"What size?\"\r\n\r\nMike told him, and Old Harry went over to the proper bin, pulled them\r\nout, all properly boxed, and handed them to him.\r\n\r\n\"That'll be four dollars,\" he said.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel paid up with a smile. \"You don't happen to have a\r\nhundred-thousand-unit microcryotron stack, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ain't s'posed to,\" said Harry MacDougal. \"If I did, I wouldn't sell it\r\nto you. But, as a matter of cold fact, I do happen to have one. Use it\r\nfor a paperweight. I'll give it to you for nothing, because it don't\r\nwork, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe I can fix it,\" said Mike the Angel, \"as long as you're giving it\r\nto me. How come it doesn't work?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a second, laddie,\" said Harry. He scuttled to the rear of the shop\r\nand came back with a ready-wrapped package measuring five by five by\r\nfour. He handed it to Mike the Angel and said: \"It's a present. Thanks\r\nfor helping me out of a tight spot.\"\r\n\r\nMike said something deprecative of his own efforts and took the package.\r\nIf it were in working order it would have been worth close to three\r\nhundred dollars--more than that on the black market. If it was broken,\r\nthough, it was no good to Mike. A microcryotron unit is almost\r\nimpossible to fix if it breaks down. But Mike took it because he didn't\r\nwant to hurt Old Harry's feelings by refusing a present.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Harry,\" he said. \"Happen to know why it doesn't work?\"\r\n\r\nHarry's face crinkled again in his all-over smile. \"Sure, Mike. It ain't\r\nplugged in.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nMike the Angel did not believe in commuting. Being a bachelor, he could\r\nafford to indulge in that belief. In his suite of offices on 112th\r\nStreet, there was one door marked \"M. R. Gabriel.\" Behind that door was\r\nhis private secretary's office, which acted as an effective barrier\r\nbetween himself and the various employees of the firm. Behind the\r\nsecretary's office was his own office.\r\n\r\nThere was still another door in his inner office, a plain, unmarked door\r\nthat looked as though it might conceal a closet.\r\n\r\nIt didn't. It was the door to a veddy, veddy expensive apartment with\r\nequally expensive appointments. One wall, thirty feet long and ten feet\r\nhigh, was a nearly invisible, dustproof slab of polished, optically flat\r\nglass that gave the observer the feeling that there was nothing between\r\nhim and the city street, five hundred feet below.\r\n\r\nThe lights of the city, coming through the wall, gave the room plenty of\r\nillumination after sunset, but the simple flick of a switch could\r\npolarize it black, allowing perfect privacy.\r\n\r\nThe furniture was massive, heavily braced, and well upholstered. It had\r\nto be; Mike the Angel liked to flop into chairs, and his two hundred and\r\nsixty pounds gave chairs a lot of punishment.\r\n\r\nOn one of the opaque walls was Dali's original \"Eucharist,\" with its\r\nmuffled, robed figures looking oddly luminous in the queer combination\r\nof city lights and interior illumination. Farther back, a Valois gleamed\r\nmetallically above the shadowed bas-reliefs of its depths.\r\n\r\nIt was the kind of apartment Mike the Angel liked. He could sleep, if\r\nnecessary, on a park bench or in a trench, but he didn't see any reason\r\nfor doing so if he could sleep on a five-hundred-dollar floater.\r\n\r\nAs he had passed through each door, he had checked them carefully. His\r\nelectrokey had a special circuit that lighted up a tiny glow lamp in the\r\nkey handle if the lock had been tampered with. None of them had.\r\n\r\nHe opened the final door, went into his apartment, and locked the door\r\nbehind him, as he had locked the others. Then he turned on the lights,\r\npeeled off his raincoat, and plopped himself into a chair to unwrap the\r\nmicrocryotron stack he had picked up at Harry's.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, Harry wasn't supposed to sell the things. They were still\r\ndifficult to make, and they were supposed to be used only by persons who\r\nwere authorized to build robot brains, since that's what the stack\r\nwas--a part of a robot brain. Mike could have put his hands on one\r\nlegally, provided he'd wanted to wait for six or eight months to clear\r\nup the red tape. Actually, the big robotics companies didn't want\r\namateurs fooling around with robots; they'd much rather build the robots\r\nthemselves and rent them out. They couldn't make do-it-yourself projects\r\nimpossible, but they could make them difficult.\r\n\r\nIn a way, there was some good done. So far, the JD's hadn't gone into\r\nbig-scale robotics. Self-controlled bombs could be rather nasty.\r\n\r\nAdult criminals, of course, already had them. But an adult criminal who\r\nhad the money to invest in robotic components, or went to the trouble to\r\nsteal them, had something more lucrative in mind than street fights or\r\nrobbing barrooms. To crack a bank, for instance, took a cleverly\r\nconstructed, well-designed robot and plenty of ingenuity on the part of\r\nthe operator.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel didn't want to make bombs or automatic bankrobbers; he\r\njust wanted to fiddle with the stack, see what it would do. He turned it\r\nover in his hands a couple of times, then shrugged, got up, went over to\r\nhis closet, and put the thing away. There wasn't anything he could do\r\nwith it until he'd bought a cryostat--a liquid helium refrigerator. A\r\ncryotron functions only at temperatures near absolute zero.\r\n\r\nThe phone chimed.\r\n\r\nMike went over to it, punched the switch, and said: \"Gabriel speaking.\"\r\n\r\nNo image formed on the screen. A voice said: \"Sorry, wrong number.\"\r\nThere was a slight click, and the phone went dead. Mike shrugged and\r\npunched the cutoff. Sounded like a woman. He vaguely wished he could\r\nhave seen her face.\r\n\r\nMike got up and walked back to his easy chair. He had no sooner sat down\r\nthan the phone chimed again. Damn!\r\n\r\nUp again. Back to the phone.\r\n\r\n\"Gabriel speaking.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, no image formed.\r\n\r\n\"Look, lady,\" Mike said, \"why don't you look up the number you want\r\ninstead of bothering me?\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was an image. It was the face of an elderly man with a\r\nmild, reddish face, white hair, and a cold look in his pale blue eyes.\r\nIt was Basil Wallingford, the Minister for Spatial Affairs.\r\n\r\nHe said: \"Mike, I wasn't aware that your position was such that you\r\ncould afford to be rude to a Portfolio of the Earth Government.\" His\r\nvoice was flat, without either anger or humor.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sure it is, myself,\" admitted Mike the Angel, \"but I do the\r\nbest I can with the tools I have to work with. I didn't know it was you,\r\nWally. I just had some wrong-number trouble. Sorry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mf.... Well.... I called to tell you that the _Branchell_ is ready for\r\nyour final inspection. Or will be, that is, in a week.\"\r\n\r\n\"My final inspection?\" Mike the Angel arched his heavy golden-blond\r\neyebrows. \"Hell, Wally, Serge Paulvitch is on the job down there, isn't\r\nhe? You don't need _my_ okay. If Serge says it's ready to go, it's ready\r\nto go. Or is there some kind of trouble you haven't mentioned yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; no trouble,\" said Wallingford. \"But the power plant on that ship\r\nwas built according to your designs--not Mr. Paulvitch's. The Bureau of\r\nSpace feels that you should give them the final check.\"\r\n\r\nMike knew when to argue and when not to, and he knew that this was one\r\ntime when it wouldn't do him the slightest good. \"All right,\" he said\r\nresignedly. \"I don't like Antarctica and never will, but I guess I can\r\nstand it for a few days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine. One more thing. Do you have a copy of the thrust specifications\r\nfor Cargo Hold One? Our copy got garbled in transmission, and there\r\nseems to be a discrepancy in the figures.\"\r\n\r\nMike nodded. \"Sure. They're in my office. Want me to get them now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Please. I'll hold on.\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel barely made it in time. He went to the door that led to\r\nhis office, opened it, stepped through, and closed it behind him just as\r\nthe blast went off.\r\n\r\nThe door shuddered behind Mike, but it didn't give. Mike's apartment was\r\nreasonably soundproof, but it wasn't built to take the kind of explosion\r\nthat would shake the door that Mike the Angel had just closed. It was a\r\ntwo-inch-thick slab of armor steel on heavy, precision-bearing hinges.\r\nSo was every other door in the suite. It wasn't quite a bank-vault door,\r\nbut it would do. Any explosion that could shake it was a real doozy.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel spun around and looked at the door. It was just a trifle\r\nwarped, and faint tendrils of vapor were curling around the edge where\r\nthe seal had been broken. Mike sniffed, then turned and ran. He opened a\r\ndrawer in his desk and took out a big roll of electrostatic tape. Then\r\nhe took a deep breath, went back to the door, and slapped on a strip of\r\nthe one-inch tape, running it all around the edge of the door. Then he\r\nwent into the outer office while the air conditioners cleaned out his\r\nprivate office.\r\n\r\nHe went over to one of the phones near the autofile and punched for the\r\noperator. \"I had a long-distance call coming in here from the Right\r\nExcellent Basil Wallingford, Minister for Spatial Affairs, Capitol City.\r\nWe were cut off.\"\r\n\r\n\"One moment please.\" A slight pause. \"His Excellency is here, Mr.\r\nGabriel.\"\r\n\r\nWallingford's face came back on the screen. It had lost some of its\r\nruddiness. \"What happened?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"You tell me, Wally,\" Mike snapped. \"Did you see anything at all?\"\r\n\r\n\"All I saw was that big pane of glass break. It fell into a thousand\r\npieces, and then something exploded and the phone went dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"The glass broke first?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right.\"\r\n\r\nMike sighed. \"Good. I was afraid that maybe someone had planted that\r\nbomb, rather than fired it in. I'd hate to think anyone could get into\r\nmy place without my knowing it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's gunning for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I knew. Look, Wally, can you wait until tomorrow for those\r\nspecs? I want to get hold of the police.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. Nothing urgent. It can wait. I'll call you again tomorrow\r\nevening.\" The screen blanked.\r\n\r\nMike glanced at the wall clock and then punched a number on the phone. A\r\npretty girl in a blue uniform came on the screen.\r\n\r\n\"Police Central,\" she said. \"May I help you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to speak to Detective Sergeant William Cowder, please,\" Mike\r\nsaid. \"Just tell him that Mr. Gabriel has more problems.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked puzzled, but she nodded, and pretty soon her image blanked\r\nout. The screen stayed blank, but Sergeant Cowder's voice came over the\r\nspeaker. \"What is it, Mr. Gabriel?\"\r\n\r\nHe was evidently speaking from a pocket phone.\r\n\r\n\"Attempted murder,\" said Mike the Angel. \"A few minutes ago a bomb was\r\nset off in my apartment. I think it was a rocket, and I know it was\r\nheavily laced with hydrogen cyanide. That's Suite 5000, Timmins\r\nBuilding, up on 112th Street. I called you because I have a hunch it's\r\nconnected with the incident at Harry's earlier this evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"Timmins Building, eh? I'll be right up.\"\r\n\r\nCowder cut off with a sharp click, and Mike the Angel looked quizzically\r\nat the dead screen. Was he imagining things, or was there a peculiar\r\nnote in Cowder's voice?\r\n\r\nTwo minutes later he got his answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\nMike the Angel was sitting behind his desk in his private office when\r\nthe announcer chimed. Mike narrowed his eyes and turned on his door\r\nscreen, which connected with an eye in the outer door of the suite. Who\r\ncould it be this time?\r\n\r\nIt was Sergeant Cowder.\r\n\r\n\"You got here fast,\" said Mike, thumbing the unlocker. \"Come on back to\r\nmy office.\"\r\n\r\nThe sergeant came through the outer office while Mike watched him on the\r\nscreen. Not until the officer finally pushed open the door to Mike's own\r\noffice did Mike the Angel look up from the screen.\r\n\r\n\"I repeat,\" said Mike, \"you got here fast.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't far away,\" said Cowder. \"Where's the damage?\"\r\n\r\nMike jerked a thumb toward the door to his apartment, still sealed with\r\ntape. \"In there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you been back in there yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nope,\" said Mike. \"I didn't want to disturb anything. I figured maybe\r\nyour lab boys could tell where the rocket came from.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened?\" the cop asked.\r\n\r\nMike told him, omitting nothing except the details of his conversation\r\nwith Wallingford.\r\n\r\n\"The way I see it,\" he finished, \"whoever it was phoned me to make sure\r\nI was in the room and then went out and fired a rocket at my window.\"\r\n\r\n\"What makes you think it was a JD?\" Cowder asked.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Sergeant, if I were going to do the job, I'd put my launcher in\r\nsome place where I could see that my victim was inside, without having\r\nto call him. But if I couldn't do that, I'd aim the launcher and set it\r\nto fire by remote control. Then I'd go to the phone, call him, and fire\r\nthe rocket while he was on the phone. I'd be sure of getting him that\r\nway. The way it was done smacks of a kid's trick.\"\r\n\r\nCowder looked at the door. \"Think we can go in there now? The HCN ought\r\nto have cleared out by now.\"\r\n\r\nMike stood up from behind his desk. \"I imagine it's pretty clear. I\r\nchecked the air conditioners; they're still working, and the filters are\r\nefficient enough to take care of an awful lot of hydrogen cyanide.\r\nBesides, the window is open. But--shouldn't we wait for the lab men?\"\r\n\r\nCowder shook his head. \"Not necessary. They'll be up in a few minutes,\r\nbut they'll probably just confirm what we already know. Peel that tape\r\noff, will you?\"\r\n\r\nMike took his ionizer from the top of the desk, walked over to the door,\r\nand began running it over the tape. It fell off and slithered to the\r\nfloor. As he worked, he said:\r\n\r\n\"You think you know where the rocket was fired from?\"\r\n\r\n\"Almost positive,\" said Cowder. \"We got a call a few minutes back from\r\nthe Cathedral of St. John the Divine.\"\r\n\r\nThe last of the tape fell off, and Mike opened the door. It didn't work\r\neasily, but it did open. The odor of bitter almonds was so faint that it\r\nmight actually have been imagination.\r\n\r\nCowder pointed out the shattered window at the gray spire of the\r\ncathedral. \"There's your launching site. We don't know how they got up\r\nthere, but they managed.\"\r\n\r\n\"They?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two of them. When they tried to leave, a couple of priests and two\r\nofficers of the Cathedral Police spotted them. The kids dropped their\r\nlauncher and two unfired rockets, and then tried to run for it. Result:\r\none dead kid, one getaway. One of the cops got a bad gash on his arm\r\nfrom a vibroblade, and one of the priests got it in the abdomen. He'll\r\nlive, but he's in bad shape.\"\r\n\r\nMike said something under his breath that might have been an oath,\r\nexcept that it avoided all mention of the Deity. Then he added that\r\nName, in a different tone of voice.\r\n\r\n\"I agree,\" said Cowder. \"You think you know why they did it?\"\r\n\r\nMike looked around at his apartment. At first glance it appeared to be a\r\ntotal loss, but closer inspection showed that most of the damage had\r\nbeen restricted to glass and ceramics. The furniture had been tumbled\r\naround but not badly damaged. The war head of the rocket had evidently\r\nbeen of the concussion-and-gas type, without much fragmentation.\r\n\r\n\"I think I know why, yes,\" Mike said, turning back to the sergeant. \"I\r\nhad a funny feeling all the way home from Harry's. Nothing I could lay\r\nmy finger on, really. I tried to see if I was being followed, but I\r\ndidn't spot anyone. There were plenty of kids on the subway.\r\n\r\n\"It's my guess that the kids knew who I was. If they cased Harry's as\r\nthoroughly as it seems they did, they must have seen me go in and out\r\nseveral times. They knew that it was my fault that two of their members\r\ngot picked up, so they decided to teach me a lesson. One of them must\r\nhave come up here, even before I left Harry's. The other followed me,\r\njust to make sure I was really coming home. Since he knew where I was\r\ngoing, he didn't have to stick too close, so I didn't spot him in the\r\ncrowd. He might even have gone on up to 116th Street so that I wouldn't\r\nsee him get off at 110th.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sounds reasonable,\" Cowder agreed. \"We know who the kids are. The\r\nuniformed squads are rounding up the whole bunch for questioning. They\r\ncall themselves--you'll get a laugh out of this!--they call themselves\r\nthe Rocketeers.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm fracturing my funny bone,\" said Mike the Angel. \"The thing that\r\ngets me is this revenge business, though. Kids don't usually go that far\r\nout for fellow gang members.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not usually,\" the sergeant said, \"but this is a little different. The\r\ngirl you caught and the boy who got killed over at the cathedral are\r\nbrother and sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"That explains it,\" Mike said. \"Rough family, eh?\"\r\n\r\nSergeant Cowder shook his head. \"Not really. The parents are respectable\r\nand fairly well off. Larchmont's the name. The kids are Susan and\r\nHerbert--Sue and Bert to you. Bert's sixteen, Sue's seventeen. They were\r\npretty thick, I gather: real brother and sister team.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good family, bad kids,\" Mike muttered. He had wandered over to the wall\r\nto look at his Dali. It had fallen to the floor, but it wasn't hurt. The\r\nValois was bent, but it could be fixed up easily enough.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder,\" Mike said, picking up the head of a smashed figurine and\r\nlooking at it. \"I wonder if the so-called sociologists have any\r\nexplanation for it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" Cowder said. \"Same one they've been giving for more decades than\r\nI'd care to think of. The mother was married before. Divorced her\r\nhusband, married Larchmont. But she had a boy by her first husband.\"\r\n\r\n\"Broken home and sibling rivalry? _Pfui!_ And if it wasn't that, the\r\nsociologists would find another excuse,\" Mike said angrily.\r\n\r\n\"Funny thing is that the older half brother was a perfectly respectable\r\nkid. Made good grades in school, joined the Space Service, has a\r\nperfectly clean record. And yet _he_ was the product of the broken home,\r\nnot the two younger kids.\"\r\n\r\nMike laughed dryly. \"_That_ ought to be food for high sociological\r\nthought.\"\r\n\r\nThe door announcer chimed again, and Cowder said: \"That's probably the\r\nlab boys. I told them to come over here as soon as they could finish up\r\nat the cathedral.\"\r\n\r\nMike checked his screen and when Cowder identified the men at the door,\r\nMike let them in.\r\n\r\nThe short, chubby man in the lead, who was introduced as Perkins, spoke\r\nto Sergeant Cowder first. \"We checked one of those rockets. Almost a\r\nprofessional job. TNT war head, surrounded by a jacket filled with\r\nliquid HCN and a phosphate inhibitor to prevent polymerization. Nasty\r\nthings.\" He swung round to Mike. \"You're lucky you weren't in the room,\r\nor you'd just be part of the wreckage, Mr. Gabriel.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" said Mike the Angel. \"Well, the room's all yours. It probably\r\nwon't tell you much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably not,\" said Perkins, \"but we'll see. Come on, boys.\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel tapped Cowder on the shoulder. \"I'd like to talk to you\r\nfor a minute.\"\r\n\r\nCowder nodded, and Mike led the way back into his private office. He\r\nopened his desk drawer and took out the little pack that housed the\r\nworkings of the vibroblade shield.\r\n\r\n\"That accident you were talking about, Sergeant--the one that made those\r\nvibroblades blow, remember? I got to thinking that maybe this could have\r\ncaused it. I think that with a little more power, it might even vaporize\r\na high-speed bullet. But I'd advise you to wear asbestos clothing.\"\r\n\r\nCowder took the thing and looked at it. \"Thanks, Mr. Gabriel,\" he said\r\nhonestly. \"Maybe the kids will go on to using something else if\r\nvibroblades don't work, but I think I'd prefer a rocket in the head to\r\nbeing carved by a vibro.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be honest,\" Mike said, \"I think the vibro is just a fad among the\r\nJD's now, anyway. You know--if you're one of the real biggies, you carry\r\na vibro. A year from now, it might be shock guns, but right now you're\r\nchicken if you carry anything but a vibroblade.\"\r\n\r\nCowder dropped the shield generator into his coat pocket. \"Thanks again,\r\nMr. Gabriel. We'll do you a favor sometime.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\nThe firm of M. R. GABRIEL, POWER DESIGN was not a giant corporation, but\r\nit did pretty well for a one-man show. The outer office was a gantlet\r\nthat Mike the Angel had to run when he came in the next morning after\r\nhaving spent the night at a hotel. There was a mixed and ragged chorus\r\nof \"Good morning, Mr. Gabriel\" as he passed through. Mike gave the nod\r\nto each of them and was stopped four times for small details before he\r\nfinally made his way to his own office.\r\n\r\nHis secretary was waiting for him. She was short, bony, and plain of\r\nface. She had a figure like an ironing board and the soul of a Ramsden\r\ncalculator. Mike the Angel liked her that way; it avoided complications.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Mr. Gabriel,\" she said. \"What the hell happened here?\"\r\nShe waved at the warped door and the ribbons of electrostatic tape that\r\nstill lay in curls on the floor.\r\n\r\nMike told her, and she listened to his recitation without any change of\r\nexpression. \"I'm very glad you weren't hurt,\" she said when he had\r\nfinished. \"What are you going to do about the apartment?\"\r\n\r\nMike opened the heavy door and looked at the wreckage inside. Through\r\nthe gaping hole of the shattered window, he could see the towering\r\nspires of the two-hundred-year-old Cathedral of St. John the Divine.\r\n\"Get Larry Beasley on the phone, Helen. I've forgotten his number, but\r\nyou'll find him listed under 'Interior Decorators.' He has the original\r\nplans and designs on file. Tell him to get them out; I want this place\r\nfixed up just like it was.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what if someone else....\" She gestured toward the broken window and\r\nthe cathedral spires beyond.\r\n\r\n\"When you're through talking to Beasley,\" Mike went on, \"see if you can\r\nget Bishop Brennan on the phone and switch him to my desk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" she said.\r\n\r\nWithin two hours workmen were busily cleaning up the wreckage in Mike\r\nthe Angel's apartment, and the round, plump figure of Larry Beasley was\r\nwalking around pompously while his artistic but businesslike brain made\r\nestimates. Mike had also reached an agreement with the bishop whereby\r\nspecial vaultlike doors would be fitted into the stairwells leading up\r\nto the towers at Mike's expense. They were to have facings of bronze so\r\nthat they could be decorated to blend with the Gothic decor of the\r\nchurch, but the bronze would be backed by heavy steel. Nobody would blow\r\n_those_ down in a hurry.\r\n\r\nSince the wrecked living room was a flurry of activity and his office\r\nhad become a thoroughfare, Mike the Angel retired to his bedroom to\r\nthink. He took with him the microcryotron stack he had picked up at Old\r\nHarry's the night before.\r\n\r\n\"For something that doesn't look like much,\" he said aloud to the\r\nstack, \"you have caused me a hell of a lot of trouble.\"\r\n\r\nOld Harry, he knew, wouldn't be caught dead selling the things. In the\r\nfirst place, it was strictly illegal to deal in the components of\r\nrobotic brains. In the second place, they were so difficult to get, even\r\non the black market, that the few that came into Old Harry's hands went\r\ninto the defenses of his own shop. Mike the Angel had only wanted to\r\nborrow one to take a good look at it. He had read up on all the\r\nliterature about microcryotrons, but he'd never actually seen one\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nHe had reason to be curious about microcryotrons. There was something\r\ndefinitely screwy going on in Antarctica.\r\n\r\nNearly two years before, the UN Government, in the person of Minister\r\nWallingford himself, had asked Mike's firm--which meant Mike the Angel\r\nhimself--to design the power drive and the thrust converters for a\r\nspaceship. On the face of it, there was nothing at all unusual in that.\r\nSuch jobs were routine for M. R. Gabriel.\r\n\r\nBut when the specifications arrived, Mike the Angel had begun to wonder\r\nwhat the devil was going on. The spaceship _William Branchell_ was to be\r\nbuilt on the surface of Earth--and yet it was to be a much larger ship\r\nthan any that had ever before been built on the ground. Usually, an\r\ninterstellar vessel that large was built in orbit around the Earth,\r\nwhere the designers didn't have to worry about gravitational pull. Such\r\na ship never landed, any more than an ocean liner was ever beached--not\r\non purpose, anyway. The passengers and cargo were taken up by smaller\r\nvessels and brought down the same way when the liner arrived at her\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\nAside from the tremendous energy required to lift such a vessel free of\r\na planet's surface, there was also the magnetic field of the planet to\r\nconsider. The drive tubes tended to wander and become erratic if they\r\nwere forced to cut through the magnetic field of a planet.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Question One: Why wasn't the _Branchell_ being built in\r\nspace?\r\n\r\nPart of the answer, Mike knew, lay in the specifications for the\r\nconstruction of Cargo Hold One. For one thing, it was huge. For another,\r\nit was heavily insulated. For a third, it was built like a tank for\r\nholding liquids. All very well and good; possibly someone wanted to\r\ncarry a cargo of cold lemonade or iced tea. That would be pretty stupid,\r\nmaybe, but it wouldn't be mysterious.\r\n\r\nThe mystery lay in the fact that Cargo Hold One had _already been\r\nbuilt_. The _Branchell_ was to be built _around_ it! And that didn't\r\nexactly jibe with Mike the Angel's ideas of the proper way to build a\r\nspaceship. It was not quite the same as building a seagoing vessel\r\naround an oil tank in the middle of Texas, but it was close enough to\r\nbother Mike the Angel.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Question Two: Why was the _Branchell_ being built around\r\nCargo Hold One?\r\n\r\nWhich led to Question Three: What was _in_ Cargo Hold One?\r\n\r\nFor the answer to that question, he had one very good hint. The density\r\nof the contents of Cargo Hold One was listed in the specs as being\r\none-point-seven-two-six grams per cubic centimeter. And that, Mike\r\nhappened to know, was the density of a cryotronic brain, which is 90 per\r\ncent liquid helium and 10 per cent tantalum and niobium, by volume.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the microcryotron stack in his hand. It was a\r\none-hundred-kilounit stack. The possible connections within it were\r\nfactorial one hundred thousand. All it needed was to be immersed in its\r\nbath of liquid helium to make the metals superconducting, and it would\r\nbe ready to go to work.\r\n\r\nA friend of his who worked for Computer Corporation of Earth had built a\r\nrobot once, using just such a stack. The robot was designed to play\r\npoker. He had fed in all the rules of play and added all the data from\r\nOesterveldt's _On Poker_. It took Mike the Angel exactly one hour to\r\nfigure out how to beat it.\r\n\r\nAs long as Mike played rationally, the machine had a slight edge, since\r\nit had a perfect memory and could compute faster than Mike could. But it\r\nwould not, could not learn how to bluff. As soon as Mike started\r\nbluffing, the robot went into a tizzy.\r\n\r\nIt wouldn't have been so bad if the robot had known nothing whatever\r\nabout bluffing. That would have made it easy for Mike. All he'd have had\r\nto do was keep on feeding in chips until the robot folded.\r\n\r\nBut the robot _did_ know about bluffing. The trouble is that bluffing is\r\nessentially illogical, and the robot had no rules whatsoever to go by to\r\njudge whether Mike was bluffing or not. It finally decided to make its\r\ndecisions by chance, judging by Mike's past performance at bluffing.\r\nWhen it did, Mike quit bluffing and cleaned it out fast.\r\n\r\nThat caused such utter confusion in the random circuits that Mike's\r\nfriend had had to spend a week cleaning up the robot's little mind.\r\n\r\nBut what would be the purpose of building a brain as gigantic as the one\r\nin Cargo Hold One? And why build a spaceship around it?\r\n\r\nLike a pig roasting on an automatic spit, the problem kept turning over\r\nand over in Mike's mind. And, like the roasting pig, the time eventually\r\ncame when it was done.\r\n\r\nOnce it is set in operation, a properly operating robot brain can\r\nneither be shut off nor dismantled. Not, that is, unless you want to\r\nlose all of the data and processes you've fed into it.\r\n\r\nNow, suppose the Computer Corporation of Earth had built a giant-sized\r\nbrain. (Never mind _why_--just suppose.) And suppose they wanted to take\r\nit off Earth, but didn't want to lose all the data that had been pumped\r\ninto it. (Again, never mind _why_--just suppose.)\r\n\r\nVery well, then. _If_ such a brain had been built, and _if_ it was\r\nnecessary to take it off Earth, and _if_ the data in it was so precious\r\nthat the brain could not be shut off or dismantled, _then_ the thing to\r\ndo would be to build a ship around it.\r\n\r\nOh _yeah_?\r\n\r\nMike the Angel stared at the microcryotron stack and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Now, tell me, pal, just why would anyone want a brain that big? And\r\nwhat is so blasted important about it?\"\r\n\r\nThe stack said not a word.\r\n\r\nThe phone chimed. Mike the Angel thumbed the switch, and his secretary's\r\nface appeared on the screen. \"Minister Wallingford is on the line, Mr.\r\nGabriel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Put him on,\" said Mike the Angel.\r\n\r\nBasil Wallingford's ruddy face came on. \"I see you're still alive,\" he\r\nsaid. \"What in the bloody blazes happened last night?\"\r\n\r\nMike sighed and told him. \"In other words,\" he ended up, \"just the usual\r\nsort of JD stuff we have to put up with these days. Nothing new, and\r\nnothing to worry about.\"\r\n\r\n\"You almost got killed,\" Wallingford pointed out.\r\n\r\n\"A miss is as good as a mile,\" Mike said with cheerful inanity. \"Thanks\r\nto your phone call, I was as safe as if I'd been in my own home,\" he\r\nadded with utter illogic.\r\n\r\n\"You can afford to laugh,\" Wallingford said grimly. \"I can't. I've\r\nalready lost one man.\"\r\n\r\nMike's grin vanished. \"What do you mean? Who?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nobody's killed,\" Wallingford said quickly. \"I didn't mean that.\r\nBut Jack Wong turned his car over yesterday at a hundred and seventy\r\nmiles an hour, and he's laid up with a fractured leg and a badly\r\ndislocated arm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too bad,\" said Mike. \"One of these days that fool will kill himself\r\nracing.\" He knew Wong and liked him. They had served together in the\r\nSpace Service when Mike was on active duty.\r\n\r\n\"I hope not,\" Wallingford said. \"Anyway--the matter I called you on last\r\nnight. Can you get those specs for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, Wally. Hold on.\" He punched the hold button and rang for his\r\nsecretary as Wallingford's face vanished. When the girl's face came on,\r\nhe said: \"Helen, get me the cargo specs on the _William\r\nBranchell_--Section Twelve, pages 66 to 74.\"\r\n\r\nThe discussion, after Helen had brought the papers, lasted less than\r\nfive minutes. It was merely a matter of straightening out some cost\r\nestimates--but since it had to do with the _Branchell_, and specifically\r\nwith Hold Number One, Mike decided he'd ask a question.\r\n\r\n\"Wally, tell me--what in the hell is going on down there at Chilblains\r\nBase?\"\r\n\r\n\"They're building a spaceship,\" said Wallingford in a flat voice.\r\n\r\nIt was Wallingford's way of saying he wasn't going to answer any\r\nquestions, but Mike the Angel ignored the hint. \"I'd sort of gathered\r\nthat,\" he said dryly. \"But what I want to know is: Why is it being built\r\naround a cryotronic brain, the like of which I have never heard before?\"\r\n\r\nBasil Wallingford's eyes widened, and he just stared for a full two\r\nseconds. \"And just how did you come across that information, Golden\r\nWings?\" he finally asked.\r\n\r\n\"It's right here in the specs,\" said Mike the Angel, tapping the sheaf\r\nof papers.\r\n\r\n\"Ridiculous.\" Wallingford's voice seemed toneless.\r\n\r\nMike decided he was in too deep now to back out. \"It certainly is,\r\nWally. It couldn't be hidden. To compute the thrust stresses, I had to\r\nknow the density of the contents of Cargo Hold One. And here it is:\r\n1.726 gm/cm³. Nothing else that I know of has that exact density.\"\r\n\r\nWallingford pursed his lips. \"Dear me,\" he said after a moment. \"I keep\r\nforgetting you're too bright for your own good.\" Then a slow smile\r\nspread over his face. \"Would you _really_ like to know?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't have asked otherwise,\" Mike said.\r\n\r\n\"Fine. Because you're just the man we need.\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel could almost feel the knife blade sliding between his\r\nribs, and he had the uncomfortable feeling that the person who had\r\nstabbed him in the back was himself. \"What's that supposed to mean,\r\nWally?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are, I believe, an officer in the Space Service Reserve,\" said\r\nBasil Wallingford in a smooth, too oily voice. \"Since the Engineering\r\nOfficer of the _Branchell_, Jack Wong, is laid up in a hospital, I'm\r\ngoing to call you to active duty to replace him.\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel felt that ghostly knife twist--hard.\r\n\r\n\"That's silly,\" he said. \"I haven't been a ship's officer for five\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're the man who designed the power plant,\" Wallingford said sweetly.\r\n\"If you don't know how to run her, nobody does.\"\r\n\r\n\"My time per hour is worth a great deal,\" Mike pointed out.\r\n\r\n\"The rate of pay for a Space Service officer,\" Basil Wallingford said\r\npleasantly, \"is fixed by law.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can fight being called back to duty--and I'll win,\" said Mike. He\r\ndidn't know how long he could play this game, but it was fun.\r\n\r\n\"True,\" said Wallingford. \"You can. I admit it. But you've been\r\nwondering what the hell that ship is being built for. You'd give your\r\nleft arm to find out. I know you, Golden Wings, and I know how that mind\r\nof yours works. And I tell you this: Unless you take this job, you'll\r\n_never_ find out why the _Branchell_ was built.\" He leaned forward, and\r\nhis face loomed large in the screen. \"And I mean absolutely _never_.\"\r\n\r\nFor several seconds Mike the Angel said nothing. His classically\r\nhandsome face was like that of some Grecian god contemplating the\r\nUniverse, or an archangel contemplating Eternity. Then he gave Basil\r\nWallingford the benefit of his full, radiant smile.\r\n\r\n\"I capitulate,\" he said.\r\n\r\nWallingford refused to look impressed. \"Damn right you do,\" he said--and\r\ncut the circuit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days later Mike the Angel was sitting at his desk making certain\r\nthat M. R. GABRIEL, POWER DESIGN would function smoothly while he was\r\ngone. Serge Paulvitch, his chief designer, could handle almost\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nPaulvitch had once said, \"Mike, the hell of working for a first-class\r\ngenius is that a second-class genius doesn't have a chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"You could start your own firm,\" Mike had said levelly. \"I'll back you,\r\nSerge; you know that.\"\r\n\r\nSerge Paulvitch had looked astonished. \"Me? You think I'm crazy? Right\r\nnow, I'm a second-class genius working for a first-class outfit. You\r\nthink I want to be a second-class genius working for a second-class\r\noutfit? Not on your life!\"\r\n\r\nPaulvitch could easily handle the firm for a few weeks.\r\n\r\nHelen's face came on the phone. \"There's a Captain Sir Henry Quill on\r\nthe phone, Mr. Gabriel. Do you wish to speak to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Black Bart?\" said Mike. \"I wonder what he wants.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bart?\" She looked puzzled. \"He said his name was Henry.\"\r\n\r\nMike grinned. \"He always signs his name: _Captain Sir Henry Quill,\r\nBart._ And since he's the toughest old martinet this side of the\r\nPleiades, the 'Black' part just comes naturally. I served under him\r\nseven years ago. Put him on.\"\r\n\r\nIn half a second the grim face of Captain Quill was on the screen.\r\n\r\nHe was as bald as an egg. What little hair he did have left was\r\nmeticulously shaved off every morning. He more than made up for his lack\r\nof cranial growth, however, by his great, shaggy, bristly brows, black\r\nas jet and firmly anchored to jutting supraorbital ridges. Any other man\r\nwould have been proud to wear them as mustaches.\r\n\r\n\"What can I do for you, Captain?\" Mike asked, using the proper tone of\r\nvoice prescribed for the genial businessman.\r\n\r\n\"You can go out and buy yourself a new uniform,\" Quill growled. \"Your\r\nold one isn't regulation any more.\"\r\n\r\nWell, not exactly growled. If he'd had the voice for it, it would have\r\nbeen a growl, but the closest he could come to a growl was an Irish\r\ntenor rumble with undertones of gravel. He stood five-eight, and his red\r\nand gold Space Service uniform gleamed with spit-and-polish luster. With\r\nhis cap off, his bald head looked as though it, too, had been polished.\r\n\r\nMike looked at him thoughtfully. \"I see. So you're commanding the\r\nmystery tub, eh?\" he said at last.\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" said the captain. \"And don't go asking me a bunch of\r\nblasted questions. I've got no more idea of what the bloody thing's\r\nabout than you--maybe not as much. I understand you designed her power\r\nplant...?\"\r\n\r\nHe let it hang. If not exactly a leading question, it was certainly a\r\nhinting statement.\r\n\r\nMike shook his head. \"I don't know anything, Captain. Honestly I don't.\"\r\n\r\nIf Space Service regulations had allowed it, Captain Sir Henry Quill,\r\nBart., would have worn a walrus mustache. And if he'd had such a\r\nmustache, he would have whuffled it then. As it was, he just blew out\r\nair, and nothing whuffled.\r\n\r\n\"You and I are the only ones in the dark, then,\" he said. \"The rest of\r\nthe crew is being picked from Chilblains Base. Pete Jeffers is First\r\nOfficer, in case you're wondering.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, great,\" Mike the Angel said with a moan. \"That means we'll be going\r\nin cold on an untried ship.\"\r\n\r\nLike Birnam Wood advancing on Dunsinane, Quill's eyebrows moved upward.\r\n\"Don't you trust your own designing?\"\r\n\r\n\"As much as you do,\" said Mike the Angel. \"Probably more.\"\r\n\r\nQuill nodded. \"We'll have to make the best of it. We'll muddle through\r\nsomehow. Are you all ready to go?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Mike admitted, \"but I don't see that I can do a damn thing about\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor do I,\" said Captain Quill. \"Be at Chilblains Base in twenty-four\r\nhours. Arrangements will be made at the Long Island Base for your\r\ntransportation to Antarctica. And\"--he paused and his scowl became\r\ndeeper--\"you'd best get used to calling me 'sir' again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yessir, Sir Henry, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Thank_ you, Mister Gabriel,\" snapped Quill, cutting the circuit.\r\n\r\n\"Selah,\" said Mike the Angel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChilblains Base, Antarctica, was directly over the South Magnetic\r\nPole--at least, as closely as that often elusive spot could be\r\npinpointed for any length of time. It is cheaper in the long run if an\r\ninterstellar vessel moves parallel with, not perpendicular to, the\r\nmagnetic \"lines of force\" of a planet's gravitational field. Taking off\r\n\"across the grain\" _can_ be done, but the power consumption is much\r\ngreater. Taking off \"with the grain\" is expensive enough.\r\n\r\nAn ion rocket doesn't much care where it lifts or sets down, since its\r\nmethod of propulsion isn't trying to work against the fabric of space\r\nitself. For that reason, an interstellar vessel is normally built in\r\nspace and stays there, using ion rockets for loading and unloading its\r\npassengers. It's cheaper by far.\r\n\r\nThe Computer Corporation of Earth had also been thinking of expenses\r\nwhen it built its Number One Research Station near Chilblains Base,\r\nalthough the corporation was not aware at the time just how much money\r\nit was eventually going to save them.\r\n\r\nThe original reason had simply been lower power costs. A cryotron unit\r\nhas to be immersed at all times in a bath of liquid helium at a\r\ntemperature of four-point-two degrees absolute. It is obviously much\r\neasier--and much cheaper--to keep several thousand gallons of helium at\r\nthat temperature if the surrounding temperature is at two hundred\r\nthirty-three absolute than if it is up around two hundred ninety or\r\nthree hundred. That may not seem like much percentagewise, but it comes\r\nout to a substantial saving in the long run.\r\n\r\nBut, power consumption or no, when C.C. of E. found that Snookums either\r\nhad to be moved or destroyed, it was mightily pleased that it had built\r\nPrime Station near Chilblains Base. Since a great deal of expense also,\r\nof necessity, devolved upon Earth Government, the government was, to say\r\nit modestly, equally pleased. There was enough expense as it was.\r\n\r\nThe scenery at Chilblains Base--so named by a wiseacre American navy\r\nman back in the twentieth century--was nothing to brag about. Thousands\r\nof square miles of powdered ice that has had nothing to do but blow\r\naround for twenty million years is not at all inspiring after the first\r\nfew minutes unless one is obsessed by the morbid beauty of cold death.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel was not so obsessed. To him, the area surrounding\r\nChilblains Base was just so much white hell, and his analysis was\r\nperfectly correct. Mike wished that it had been January, midsummer in\r\nthe Antarctic, so there would have been at least a little dim sunshine.\r\nMike the Angel did not particularly relish having to visit the South\r\nPole in midwinter.\r\n\r\nThe rocket that had lifted Mike the Angel from Long Island Base settled\r\nitself into the snow-covered landing stage of Chilblains Base,\r\ndissipating the crystalline whiteness into steam as it did so. The\r\nsteam, blown away by the chill winds, moved all of thirty yards before\r\nit became ice again.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel was not in the best of moods. Having to dump all of his\r\nbusiness into Serge Paulvitch's hands on twenty-four hours' notice was\r\nirritating. He knew Paulvitch could handle the job, but it wasn't fair\r\nto him to make him take over so suddenly.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Mike did not like the way the whole _Branchell_ business\r\nwas being handled. It seemed slipshod and hurried, and, worse, it was\r\nentirely too mysterious and melodramatic.\r\n\r\n\"Of all the times to have to come to Antarctica,\" he grumped as the door\r\nof the rocket opened, \"why did I have to get July?\"\r\n\r\nThe pilot, a young man in his early twenties, said smugly: \"July is bad,\r\nbut January isn't good--just not so worse.\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel glowered. \"Sonny, I was a cadet here when you were\r\nlearning arithmetic. It hasn't changed since, summer or winter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, sir,\" said the pilot stiffly.\r\n\r\n\"So am I,\" said Mike the Angel cryptically. \"Thanks for the ride.\"\r\n\r\nHe pushed open the outer door, pulled his electroparka closer around\r\nhim, and stalked off across the walk, through the lashing of the sleety\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nHe didn't have far to walk--a hundred yards or so--but it was a good\r\nthing that the walk was protected and well within the boundary of\r\nChilblains Base instead of being out on the Wastelands. Here there were\r\nlights, and the Hotbed equipment of the walk warmed the swirling ice\r\nparticles into a sleety rain. On the Wastelands, the utter blackness and\r\nthe wind-driven snow would have swallowed him permanently within ten\r\npaces.\r\n\r\nHe stepped across a curtain of hot air that blew up from a narrow slit\r\nin the deck and found himself in the main foyer of Chilblains Base.\r\n\r\nThe entrance looked like the entrance to a theater--a big metal and\r\nplastic opening, like a huge room open on one side, with only that sheet\r\nof hot air to protect it from the storm raging outside. The lights and\r\nthe small doors leading into the building added to the impression that\r\nthis was a theater, not a military base.\r\n\r\nBut the man who was standing near one of the doors was not by a long\r\nshot dressed as an usher. He wore a sergeant's stripes on his regulation\r\nSpace Service parka, which muffled him to the nose, and he came over to\r\nMike the Angel and said: \"Commander Gabriel?\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel nodded as he shook icy drops from his gloved hands, then\r\nfished in his belt pocket for his newly printed ID card.\r\n\r\nHe handed it to the sergeant, who looked it over, peered at Mike's face,\r\nand saluted. As Mike returned the salute the sergeant said: \"Okay, sir;\r\nyou can go on in. The security office is past the double door, first\r\ncorridor on your right.\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel tried his best not to look surprised. \"_Security_ office?\r\nIs there a war on or something? What does Chilblains need with a\r\nsecurity office?\"\r\n\r\nThe sergeant shrugged. \"Don't ask me, Commander; I just slave away here.\r\nMaybe Lieutenant Nariaki knows something, but I sure don't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Sergeant.\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel went inside, through two insulated and tightly\r\nweather-stripped doors, one right after another, like the air lock on a\r\nspaceship. Once inside the warmth of the corridor, he unzipped his\r\nelectroparka, shut off the power, and pushed back the hood with its\r\nfogproof faceplate.\r\n\r\nDown the hall, Mike could see an office marked _security officer_ in\r\nsmall letters without capitals. He walked toward it. There was another\r\nguard at the door who had to see Mike's ID card before Mike was allowed\r\nin.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Tokugawa Nariaki was an average-sized, sleepy-looking\r\nindividual with a balding crew cut and a morose expression.\r\n\r\nHe looked up from his desk as Mike came in, and a hopeful smile tried to\r\nspread itself across his face. \"If you are Commander Gabriel,\" he said\r\nsoftly, \"watch yourself. I may suddenly kiss you out of sheer relief.\"\r\n\r\n\"Restrain yourself, then,\" said Mike the Angel, \"because I'm Gabriel.\"\r\n\r\nNariaki's smile became genuine. \"So! Good! The phone has been screaming\r\nat me every half hour for the past five hours. Captain Sir Henry Quill\r\nwants you.\"\r\n\r\n\"He would,\" Mike said. \"How do I get to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't just yet,\" said Nariaki, raising a long, bony, tapering hand.\r\n\"There are a few formalities which our guests have to go through.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such as?\"\r\n\r\n\"Such as fingerprint and retinal patterns,\" said Lieutenant Nariaki.\r\n\r\nMike cast his eyes to Heaven in silent appeal, then looked back at the\r\nlieutenant. \"Lieutenant, _what_ is going on here? There hasn't been a\r\nsecurity officer in the Space Service for thirty years or more. What am\r\nI suspected of? Spying for the corrupt and evil alien beings of Diomega\r\nOrionis IX?\"\r\n\r\nNariaki's oriental face became morose again. \"For all I know, you are.\r\nWho knows what's going on around here?\" He got up from behind his desk\r\nand led Mike the Angel over to the fingerprinting machine. \"Put your\r\nhands in here, Commander ... that's it.\"\r\n\r\nHe pushed a button, and, while the machine hummed, he said: \"Mine is an\r\nantiquated position, I'll admit. I don't like it any more than you do.\r\nNext thing, they'll put me to work polishing chain-mail armor or make me\r\ncommander of a company of musketeers. Or maybe they'll send me to the\r\n18th Outer Mongolian Yak Artillery.\"\r\n\r\nMike looked at him with narrowed eyes. \"Lieutenant, do you actually mean\r\nthat you really don't know what's going on here, or are you just\r\ndummying up?\"\r\n\r\nNariaki looked at Mike, and for the first time, his face took on the\r\ntraditional blank, emotionless look of the \"placid Orient.\" He paused\r\nfor long seconds, then said:\r\n\r\n\"Some of both, Commander. But don't let it worry you. I assure you that\r\nwithin the next hour you'll know more about Project Brainchild than I've\r\nbeen able to find out in two years.... Now put your face in here and\r\nkeep your eyes open. When you can see the target spot, focus on it and\r\ntell me.\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel put his face in the rest for the retinal photos. The soft\r\nfoam rubber adjusted around his face, and he was looking into blackness.\r\nHe focused his eyes on the dim target circle and waited for his eyes to\r\ngrow accustomed to the darkness.\r\n\r\nThe Security Officer's voice continued. \"All I do is make sure that no\r\nunauthorized person comes into Chilblains Base. Other than that, I have\r\nnothing but personal guesses and little trickles of confusing\r\ninformation, neither of which am I at liberty to discuss.\"\r\n\r\nMike's irises had dilated to the point that he could see the dim dot in\r\nthe center of the target circle, glowing like a dimly visible star.\r\n\"Shoot,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThere was a dazzling glare of light. Mike pulled his face out of the\r\npadded opening and blinked away the colored after-images.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Nariaki was comparing the fresh fingerprints with the set he\r\nhad had on file. \"Well,\" he said, \"you have Commander Gabriel's hands,\r\nanyway. If you have his eyes, I'll have to concede that the rest of the\r\nbody belongs to him, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about my soul?\" Mike asked dryly.\r\n\r\n\"Not my province, Commander,\" Nariaki said as he pulled the retinal\r\nphotos out of the machine. \"Maybe one of the chaplains would know.\"\r\n\r\n\"If this sort of thing is going on all over Chilblains,\" said Mike the\r\nAngel, \"I imagine the Office of Chaplains is doing a booming business in\r\nTS cards.\"\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant put the retinal photos in the comparator, took a good\r\nlook, and nodded. \"You're you,\" he said. \"Give me your ID card.\"\r\n\r\nMike handed it over, and Nariaki fed it through a printer which stamped\r\na complex seal in the upper left-hand corner of the card. The lieutenant\r\nsigned his name across the seal and handed the card back to Mike.\r\n\r\n\"That's it,\" he said. \"You can--\"\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted by the chiming of the phone.\r\n\r\n\"Just a second, Commander,\" he said as he thumbed the phone switch.\r\n\r\nMike was out of range of the TV pickup, and he couldn't see the face on\r\nthe screen, but the voice was so easy to recognize that he didn't need\r\nto see the man.\r\n\r\n\"Hasn't that triply bedamned rocket landed yet, Lieutenant? Where is\r\nCommander Gabriel?\"\r\n\r\nMike knew that Black Bart had already checked on the landing of the\r\nlatest rocket; the question was rhetorical.\r\n\r\nMike grinned. \"Tell the old tyrant,\" he said firmly, \"that I'll be along\r\nas soon as the Security Officer is through with me.\"\r\n\r\nNariaki's expression didn't change. \"You're through now, Commander,\r\nand--\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell that imitation Apollo to hop it over here fast!\" said Quill\r\nsharply. \"I'll give him a lesson in tyranny.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a click as the intercom shut off.\r\n\r\nNariaki looked at Mike the Angel and shook his head slowly. \"Either\r\nyou're working your way toward a court-martial or else you know where\r\nBlack Bart has the body buried.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should,\" said Mike cryptically. \"I helped him bury it. How do I get\r\nto His Despotic Majesty's realm?\"\r\n\r\nNariaki considered. \"It'll take you five or six minutes. Take the\r\ntubeway to Stage Twelve. Go up the stairway to the surface and take the\r\nfirst corridor to the left. That'll take you to the loading dock for\r\nthat stage. It's an open foyer like the one at the landing field, so\r\nyou'll have to put your parka back on. Go down the stairs on the other\r\nside, and you'll be in Area K. One of the guards will tell you where to\r\ngo from there. Of course, you could go by tube, but it would take longer\r\nbecause of the by-pass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good enough. I'll take the short cut. See you. And thanks.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\n\r\nThe underground tubeway shot Mike the Angel across five miles of track\r\nat high speed. Mike left the car at Stage Twelve and headed up the\r\nstairway and down the corridor to a heavy double door marked _freight\r\nloading_.\r\n\r\nHe put on his parka and went through the door. The foyer was empty, and,\r\nlike the one at the rocket landing, protected from the Antarctic blast\r\nonly by a curtain of hot air. Outside that curtain, the light seemed to\r\nlose itself in the darkness of the bleak, snow-filled Wastelands. Mike\r\nignored the snowscape and headed across the empty foyer to the door\r\nmarked _entrance_.\r\n\r\n\"With a small _e_,\" Mike muttered to himself. \"I wonder if the sign\r\npainter ran out of full caps.\"\r\n\r\nHe was five feet from the door when he heard the yell.\r\n\r\n\"_Help!_\"\r\n\r\nThat was all. Just the one word.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel came to a dead halt and spun around.\r\n\r\nThe foyer was a large room, about fifty by fifty feet in area and nearly\r\ntwenty feet high. And it was quite obviously empty. On the open side,\r\nthe sheet of hissing hot air was doing its best to shield the room from\r\nthe sixty-below-zero blizzard outside. Opposite the air curtain was a\r\nhuge sliding door, closed at the moment, which probably led to a freight\r\nelevator. There were only two other doors leading from the foyer, and\r\nboth of them were closed. And Mike knew that no voice could come through\r\nthose insulated doors.\r\n\r\n\"_Help!_\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel swung toward the air curtain. This time there was no\r\ndoubt. Someone was out in that howling ice-cloud, screaming for help!\r\n\r\nMike saw the figure--dimly, fleetingly, obscured most of the time by the\r\ndriving whiteness. Whoever it was looked as if he were buried to the\r\nwaist in snow.\r\n\r\nMike made a quick estimate. It was dark out there, but he could see the\r\nfigure; therefore he would be able to see the foyer lights. He wouldn't\r\nget lost. Snapping down the faceplate of his parka hood, he ran through\r\nthe protective updraft of the air curtain and charged into the deadly\r\nchill of the Antarctic blizzard.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the electroparka he was wearing, the going was difficult.\r\nThe snow tended to plaster itself against his faceplate, and the wind\r\nkept trying to take him off his feet. He wiped a gloved hand across the\r\nfaceplate. Ahead, he could still see the figure waving its arms. Mike\r\nslogged on.\r\n\r\nAt sixty below, frozen H_{2}O isn't slushy, by any means; it isn't even\r\nslippery. It's more like fine sand than anything else. Mike the Angel\r\nfigured he had about thirty feet to go, but after he'd taken eight\r\nsteps, the arm-waving figure looked as far off as when he'd started.\r\n\r\nMike stopped and flipped up his faceplate. It felt as though someone had\r\nthrown a handful of razor blades into his face. He winced and yelled,\r\n\"What's the trouble?\" Then he snapped the plate back into position.\r\n\r\n\"I'm cold!\" came the clear, contralto voice through the howling wind.\r\n\r\nA _woman_! thought Mike. \"I'm coming!\" he bellowed, pushing on. Ten more\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\nHe stopped again. He couldn't see anyone or anything.\r\n\r\nHe flipped up his faceplate. \"Hey!\"\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n\"Hey!\" he called again.\r\n\r\nAnd still there was no answer.\r\n\r\nAround Mike the Angel, there was nothing but the swirling, blinding\r\nsnow, the screaming, tearing wind, and the blackness of the Antarctic\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThere was something damned odd going on here. Carefully putting the toe\r\nof his right foot to the rear of the heel of his left, he executed a\r\none-hundred-eighty-degree military about-face.\r\n\r\nAnd breathed a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\nHe could still see the lights of the foyer. He had half suspected that\r\nsomeone was trying to trap him out here, and they might have turned off\r\nthe lights.\r\n\r\nHe swiveled his head around for one last look. He still couldn't see a\r\nsign of anyone. There was nothing he could do but head back and report\r\nthe incident. He started slogging back through the gritty snow.\r\n\r\nHe stepped through the hot-air curtain and flipped up his faceplate.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you go out in the blizzard?\" said a clear, contralto voice\r\ndirectly behind him.\r\n\r\nMike swung around angrily. \"Look, lady, I--\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped.\r\n\r\nThe lady was no lady.\r\n\r\nA few feet away stood a machine. Vaguely humanoid in shape from the\r\nwaist up, it was built more like a miniature military tank from the\r\nwaist down. It had a pair of black sockets in its head, which Mike took\r\nto be TV cameras of some kind. It had grillwork on either side of its\r\nhead, which probably covered microphones, and another grillwork where\r\nthe mouth should be. There was no nose.\r\n\r\n\"What the hell?\" asked Mike the Angel of no one in particular.\r\n\r\n\"I'm Snookums,\" said the robot.\r\n\r\n\"Sure you are,\" said Mike the Angel, backing uneasily toward the door.\r\n\"You're Snookums. I couldn't fail not to disagree with you less.\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel didn't particularly like being frightened, but he had\r\nnever found it a disabling emotion, so he could put up with it if he had\r\nto. But, given his choice, he would have much preferred to be afraid of\r\nsomething a little less unpredictable, something he knew a little more\r\nabout. Something comfortable, like, say, a Bengal tiger or a Kodiak\r\nbear.\r\n\r\n\"But I really _am_ Snookums,\" reiterated the clear voice.\r\n\r\nMike's brain was functioning in high gear with overdrive added and the\r\naccelerator floor-boarded. He'd been lured out onto the Wastelands by\r\nthis machine--it most definitely could be dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe robot was obviously a remote-control device. The arms and hands were\r\nof the waldo type used to handle radioactive materials in a hot\r\nlab--four jointed fingers and an opposed thumb, metal duplicates of the\r\nhuman hand.\r\n\r\nBut who was on the other end? Who was driving the machine? Who was\r\nsaying those inane things over the speaker that served the robot as a\r\nmouth? It was certainly a woman's voice.\r\n\r\nMike was still moving backward, toward the door. The machine that called\r\nitself Snookums wasn't moving toward him, which was some consolation,\r\nbut not much. The thing could obviously move faster on those treads than\r\nMike could on his feet. Especially since Mike was moving backward.\r\n\r\n\"Would you mind explaining what this is all about, miss?\" asked Mike the\r\nAngel. He didn't expect an explanation; he was stalling for time.\r\n\r\n\"I am not a 'miss,'\" said the robot. \"I am Snookums.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever you are, then,\" said Mike, \"would you mind explaining?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Snookums, \"I wouldn't mind.\"\r\n\r\nMike's fingers, groping behind him, touched the door handle. But before\r\nhe could grasp it, it turned, and the door opened behind him. It hit him\r\nfull in the back, and he stumbled forward a couple of steps before\r\nregaining his balance.\r\n\r\nA clear contralto voice said: \"Oh! I'm _so_ sorry!\"\r\n\r\nIt was the same voice as the robot's!\r\n\r\nMike the Angel swung around to face the second robot.\r\n\r\nThis time it was a lady.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" she repeated. She was all wrapped up in an electroparka,\r\nbut there was no mistaking the fact that she was both human and\r\nfeminine. She came on through the door and looked at the robot.\r\n\"Snookums! What are you doing here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was trying an experiment, Leda,\" said Snookums. \"This man was just\r\nasking me about it. I just wanted to see if he would come if I called\r\n'help.' He did, and I want to know _why_ he did.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl flashed a look at Mike. \"Would you please tell Snookums why\r\nyou went out there? Please--don't be angry or anything--just tell him.\"\r\n\r\nMike was beginning to get the picture. \"I went because I thought I heard\r\na human being calling for help--and it sounded suspiciously like a\r\nwoman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said Snookums, sounding a little downhearted--if a robot can be\r\nsaid to have a heart. \"The reaction was based, then, upon a\r\nmisconception. That makes the data invalid. I'll have to try again.\"\r\n\r\n\"That won't be necessary, Snookums,\" the girl said firmly. \"This man\r\nwent out there because he thought a human life was in danger. He would\r\nnot have done it if he had known it was you, because he would have known\r\nthat you were not in any danger. You can stand much lower temperatures\r\nthan a human being can, you know.\" She turned to Mike. \"Am I correct in\r\nsaying that you wouldn't have gone out there if you'd known Snookums was\r\na robot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely correct,\" said Mike the Angel fervently.\r\n\r\nShe looked back at Snookums. \"Don't try that experiment again. It is\r\ndangerous for a human to go out there, even with an electroparka. You\r\nmight run the risk of endangering human life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh dear!\" said Snookums. \"I'm sorry, Leda!\" There was real anxiety in\r\nthe voice.\r\n\r\n\"That's all right, honey,\" the girl said hurriedly. \"This man isn't\r\nhurt, so don't get upset. Come along now, and we'll go back to the lab.\r\nYou shouldn't come out like this without permission.\"\r\n\r\nMike had noticed that the girl had kept one hand on her belt all the\r\ntime she was talking--and that her thumb was holding down a small button\r\non a case attached to the belt.\r\n\r\nHe had been wondering why, but he didn't have to wonder long.\r\n\r\nThe door behind him opened again, and four men came out, obviously in a\r\ndevil of a hurry. Each one of them was wearing a brassard labeled\r\nSECURITY POLICE.\r\n\r\n_At least_, thought Mike the Angel as he turned to look them over, _the\r\nbrassards aren't in all lower-case italics_.\r\n\r\nOne of them jerked a thumb at Mike. \"This the guy, Miss Crannon?\"\r\n\r\nThe girl nodded. \"That's him. He saw Snookums. Take care of him.\" She\r\nlooked again at Mike. \"I'm terribly sorry, really I am. But there's no\r\nhelp for it.\" Then, without another word, she opened the door and went\r\nback inside, and the robot rolled in after her.\r\n\r\nAs the door closed behind her, the SP man nearest Mike, a tough-looking\r\nbozo wearing an ensign's insignia, said: \"Let's see your\r\nidentification.\"\r\n\r\nMike realized that his own parka had no insignia of rank on it, but he\r\ndidn't like the SP man's tone.\r\n\r\n\"Come on!\" snapped the ensign. \"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel pulled out his ID card and handed it to the security cop.\r\n\"It tells right there who I am,\" he said. \"That is, if you can read.\"\r\n\r\nThe man glared and jerked the card out of Mike's hand, but when he saw\r\nthe emblem that Lieutenant Nariaki had stamped on it, his eyes widened.\r\nHe looked up at Mike. \"I'm sorry, sir; I didn't mean--\"\r\n\r\n\"That tears it,\" interrupted Mike. \"That absolutely tears it. In the\r\npast three minutes I have been apologized to by a woman, a robot, and a\r\ncop. The next thing, a penguin will walk in here, tip his top hat, and\r\nabase himself while he mutters obsequiously in penguinese. Just what\r\nthe devil is going _on_ around this place?\"\r\n\r\nThe four SP men were trying hard not to fidget.\r\n\r\n\"Just security precautions, sir,\" said the ensign uncomfortably. \"Nobody\r\nbut those connected with Project Brainchild are supposed to know about\r\nSnookums. If anyone else finds out, we're supposed to take them into\r\nprotective custody.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll bet you're widely loved for that,\" said Mike. \"I suppose the\r\ngadget at Miss What's-her-name's belt was an alarm to warn you of\r\nimpending disaster?\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Crannon.... Yes, sir. Everybody on the project carries those\r\naround. Also, Miss Crannon carries a detector for following Snookums\r\naround. She's sort of his keeper, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Mike the Angel, \"I do not know. But I intend to find out. I'm\r\nlooking for Captain Quill; where is he?\"\r\n\r\nThe four men looked at each other, then looked back at Mike.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, Commander,\" said the ensign. \"I understand that several\r\nnew men have come in today, but I don't know all of them. You'd better\r\ntalk to Dr. Fitzhugh.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such are the beauties of security,\" said Mike the Angel. \"Where can I\r\nfind this Dr. Fitzhugh?\"\r\n\r\nThe security man looked at his wrist watch. \"He's down in the cafeteria\r\nnow, sir. It's coffee time, and Doc Fitzhugh is as regular as a\r\nsatellite orbit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you didn't say 'clockwork,'\" Mike told him. \"I've had enough\r\ndealings with machines today. Where is this coffee haven?\"\r\n\r\nThe ensign gave directions for reaching the cafeteria, and Mike pushed\r\nopen the door marked _entrance_. He had to pass through another inner\r\ndoor guarded by another pair of SP men who checked his ID card again,\r\nthen he had to ramble through hallways that went off at queer angles to\r\neach other, but he finally found the cafeteria.\r\n\r\nHe nabbed the first passer-by and asked him to point out Dr. Fitzhugh.\r\nThe passer-by was obliging; he indicated a smallish, elderly man who was\r\nsitting by himself at one of the tables.\r\n\r\nMike made his way through the tray-carrying hordes that were milling\r\nabout, and finally ended up at the table where the smallish man was\r\nsitting.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Fitzhugh?\" Mike offered his hand. \"I'm Commander Gabriel. Minister\r\nWallingford appointed me Engineering Officer of the _Branchell_.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Fitzhugh shook Mike's hand with apparent pleasure. \"Oh yes. Sit\r\ndown, Commander. What can I do for you?\"\r\n\r\nMike had already peeled off his electroparka. He hung it over the back\r\nof a chair and said: \"Mind if I grab a cup of coffee, Doctor? I've just\r\ncome from topside, and I think the cold has made its way clean to my\r\nbones.\" He paused. \"Would you like another cup?\"\r\n\r\nDr. Fitzhugh looked at his watch. \"I have time for one more, thanks.\"\r\n\r\nBy the time Mike had returned with the cups, he had recalled where he\r\nhad heard the name Fitzhugh before.\r\n\r\n\"It just occurred to me,\" he said as he sat down. \"You must be Dr.\r\n_Morris_ Fitzhugh.\"\r\n\r\nFitzhugh nodded. \"That's right.\" He wore a perpetually worried look,\r\nwhich made his face look more wrinkled than his fifty years of age would\r\nnormally have accounted for. Mike was privately of the opinion that if\r\nFitzhugh ever really _tried_ to look worried, his ears would meet over\r\nthe bridge of his long nose.\r\n\r\n\"I've read a couple of your articles in the _Journal_,\" Mike explained,\r\n\"but I didn't connect the name until I saw you. I recognized you from\r\nyour picture.\"\r\n\r\nFitzhugh smiled, which merely served to wrinkle his face even more.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel spent the next several minutes feeling the man out, then\r\nhe went on to explain what had happened with Snookums out in the foyer,\r\nwhich launched Dr. Fitzhugh into an explanation.\r\n\r\n\"He didn't want help, of course; he was merely conducting an experiment.\r\nThere are many areas of knowledge in which he is as naïve as a child.\"\r\n\r\nMike nodded. \"It figures. At first I thought he was just a\r\nremote-control tool, but I finally saw that he was a real,\r\nhonest-to-goodness robot. Who gave him the idea to make such an\r\nexperiment as that?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one at all,\" said Dr. Fitzhugh. \"He's built to make up his own\r\nexperiments.\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel's classic face regarded the wrinkled one of Dr. Fitzhugh.\r\n\"His own experiments? But a robot--\"\r\n\r\nFitzhugh held up a bony hand, gesturing for attention and silence. He\r\ngot it from Mike.\r\n\r\n\"Snookums,\" he said, \"is no ordinary robot, Commander.\"\r\n\r\nMike waited for more. When none came, he said: \"So I gather.\" He sipped\r\nat his black coffee. \"That machine I saw is actually a remote-control\r\ntool, isn't it? Snookums' actual brain is in Cargo Hold One of the\r\n_William Branchell_.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right.\" Dr. Fitzhugh began reaching into various pockets about\r\nhis person. He extracted a tobacco pouch, a briar pipe, and a jet-flame\r\nlighter. Then he began speaking as he went through the pipe smoker's\r\nritual of filling, tamping, and lighting.\r\n\r\n\"Snookums,\" he began, \"is a self-activating, problem-seeking computer\r\nwith input and output sensory and action mechanisms analogous to those\r\nof a human being.\" He pushed more tobacco into the bowl of his pipe with\r\na bony forefinger. \"He's as close to being a living creature as anything\r\nMan has yet devised.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about the synthecells they're making at Boston Med?\" Mike asked,\r\nlooking innocent.\r\n\r\nFitzhugh's contour-map face wrinkled up even more. \"I should have said\r\n'living _intelligence_,'\" he corrected himself. \"He's a true robot, in\r\nthe old original sense of the word; an artificial entity that displays\r\nalmost every function of a living, intelligent creature. And, at the\r\nsame time, he has the accuracy and speed that is normal to a cryotron\r\ncomputer.\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel said nothing while Fitzhugh fired up his lighter and\r\ndirected the jet of flame into the bowl and puffed up great clouds of\r\nsmoke which obscured his face.\r\n\r\nWhile the roboticist puffed, Mike let his gaze wander idly over the\r\nother people in the cafeteria. He was wondering how much longer he could\r\ntalk to Fitzhugh before Captain Quill began--\r\n\r\nAnd then he saw the redhead.\r\n\r\nThere is never much point in describing a really beautiful girl. Each\r\nman has his own ideas of what it takes for a girl to be \"pretty\" or\r\n\"fascinating\" or \"lovely\" or almost any other adjective that can be\r\napplied to the noun \"girl.\" But \"beautiful\" is a cultural concept, at\r\nleast as far as females are concerned, and there is no point in\r\ndescribing a cultural concept. It's one of those things that everybody\r\nknows, and descriptions merely become repetitious and monotonous.\r\n\r\nThis particular example filled, in every respect, the definition of\r\n\"beautiful\" according to the culture of the white Americo-European\r\nsubclass of the human race as of anno Domini 2087. The elements and\r\nproportions and symmetry fit almost perfectly into the ideal mold. It is\r\nonly necessary to fill in some of the minor details which are allowed to\r\nvary without distorting the ideal.\r\n\r\nShe had red hair and blue eyes and was wearing a green zipsuit.\r\n\r\nAnd she was coming toward the table where Mike and Dr. Fitzhugh were\r\nsitting.\r\n\r\n\"... such a tremendous number of elements,\" Dr. Fitzhugh was saying,\r\n\"that it was possible--and necessary--to introduce a certain randomity\r\nwithin the circuit choices themselves-- Ah! Hello, Leda, my dear!\"\r\n\r\nMike and Fitzhugh rose from their seats.\r\n\r\n\"Leda, this is Commander Gabriel, the Engineering Officer of the\r\n_Brainchild_,\" said Fitzhugh. \"Commander, Miss Leda Crannon, our\r\npsychologist.\"\r\n\r\nMike had been allowing his eyes to wander over the girl, inspecting her\r\nankles, her hair, and all vital points of interest between. But when he\r\nheard the name \"Crannon,\" his eyes snapped up to meet hers.\r\n\r\nHe hadn't recognized the girl without her parka and wouldn't have known\r\nher name if the SP ensign hadn't mentioned it. Obviously, she didn't\r\nrecognize Mike at all, but there was a troubled look in her blue eyes.\r\n\r\nShe gave him a puzzled smile. \"Haven't we met, Commander?\"\r\n\r\nMike grinned. \"Hey! That's supposed to be _my_ line, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\nShe flashed him a warm smile, then her eyes widened ever so slightly.\r\n\"Your voice! You're the man on the foyer! The one....\"\r\n\r\n\"... the one whom you called copper on,\" finished Mike agreeably. \"But\r\nplease don't apologize; you've more than made up for it.\"\r\n\r\nHer smile remained. She evidently liked what she saw. \"How was I to know\r\nwho you were?\"\r\n\r\n\"It might have been written on my pocket handkerchief,\" said Mike the\r\nAngel, \"but Space Service officers don't carry pocket handkerchiefs.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" The puzzled look had returned.\r\n\r\n\"Ne' mind,\" said Mike. \"Sit down, won't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I can't, thanks. I came to get Fitz; a meeting of the Research\r\nBoard has been called, and afterward we have to give a lecture or\r\nsomething to the officers of the _Brainchild_.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean the _Branchell_?\"\r\n\r\nHer smile became an impish grin. \"You call it what you want. To us, it's\r\nthe _Brainchild_.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Fitzhugh said: \"Will you excuse us, Commander? We'll be seeing you\r\nat the briefing later.\"\r\n\r\nMike nodded. \"I'd better get on my way, too. I'll see you.\"\r\n\r\nBut he stood there as Leda Crannon and Dr. Fitzhugh walked away. The\r\ngirl looked just as divine retreating as she had advancing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Sir Henry (Black Bart) Quill was seated in an old-fashioned,\r\nformyl-covered, overstuffed chair, chewing angrily at the end of an\r\nunlighted cigar. His bald head gleamed like a pink billiard ball, almost\r\nmatching the shining glory of his golden insignia against his scarlet\r\ntunic.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel had finally found his way through the maze of underground\r\npassageways to the door marked _wardroom 9_ and had pushed it open\r\ngingerly, halfway hoping that he wouldn't be seen coming in late but not\r\nreally believing it would happen.\r\n\r\nHe was right. Black Bart was staring directly at the door when it slid\r\nopen. Mike shrugged inwardly and stepped boldly into the room, flicking\r\na glance over the faces of the other officers present.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, well, Mister Gabriel,\" said Black Bart. The voice was oily,\r\nbut the oil was oil of vitriol. \"You not only come late, but you come\r\nincognito. Where is your uniform?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a muffled snicker from one of the junior officers, but it\r\nwasn't muffled enough. Before Mike the Angel could answer, Captain\r\nQuill's head jerked around.\r\n\r\n\"That will do, Mister Vaneski!\" he barked. \"Boot ensigns don't snicker\r\nwhen their superiors--_and_ their betters--are being reprimanded! I only\r\nuse sarcasm on officers I respect. Until an officer earns my sarcasm, he\r\ngets nothing but blasting when he goofs off. Understand?\"\r\n\r\nThe last word was addressed to the whole group.\r\n\r\nEnsign Vaneski colored, and his youthful face became masklike. \"Yes,\r\nsir. Sorry, sir.\"\r\n\r\nQuill didn't even bother to answer; he looked back at Mike the Angel,\r\nwho was still standing at attention. Quill's voice resumed its caustic\r\nsaccharinity. \"But don't let that go to your head, Mister Gabriel. I\r\nrepeat: Where is your pretty red spaceman's suit?\"\r\n\r\n\"If the Captain will recall,\" said Mike, \"I had only twenty-four hours'\r\nnotice. I couldn't get a new wardrobe in that time. It'll be in on the\r\nnext rocket.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Quill was silent for a moment, then he simply said, \"Very well,\"\r\nthus dismissing the whole subject. He waved Mike the Angel to a seat.\r\nMike sat.\r\n\r\n\"We'll dispense with the formal introductions,\" said Quill. \"Commander\r\nGabriel is our Engineering Officer. The rest of these boys all know each\r\nother, Commander; you and I are the only ones who don't come from\r\nChilblains Base. You know Commander Jeffers, of course.\"\r\n\r\nMike nodded and grinned at Peter Jeffers, a lean, bony character who had\r\na tendency to collapse into chairs as though he had come unhinged.\r\nJeffers grinned and winked back.\r\n\r\n\"This is Lieutenant Commander von Liegnitz, Navigation Officer;\r\nLieutenant Keku, Supply; Lieutenant Mellon, Medical Officer; and Ensign\r\nVaneski, Maintenance. You can all shake hands with each other later;\r\nright now, let's get on with business.\" He frowned, overshadowing his\r\neyes with those great, bushy brows. \"What was I saying just before\r\nCommander Gabriel came in?\"\r\n\r\nPete Jeffers shifted slightly in his seat. \"You were sayin', suh, that\r\nthis's the stupidest dam' assignment anybody evah got. Or words to that\r\neffect.\" Jeffers had been born in Georgia and had moved to the south of\r\nEngland at the age of ten. Consequently, his accent was far from\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\n\"I think, Mister Jeffers,\" said Quill, \"that I phrased it a bit more\r\ndelicately, but that was the essence of it.\r\n\r\n\"The _Brainchild_, as she has been nicknamed, has been built at great\r\nexpense for the purpose of making a single trip. We are to take her, and\r\nher cargo, to a destination known only to myself and von Liegnitz. We\r\nwill be followed there by another Service ship, which will bring us back\r\nas passengers.\" He allowed himself a half-smile. \"At least we'll get to\r\nloaf around on the way back.\"\r\n\r\nThe others grinned.\r\n\r\n\"The _Brainchild_ will be left there and, presumably, dismantled.\"\r\n\r\nHe took the unlighted cigar out of his mouth, looked at it, and absently\r\nreached in his pocket for a lighter. The deeply tanned young man who had\r\nbeen introduced as Lieutenant Keku had just lighted a cigarette, so he\r\nproffered his own flame to the captain. Quill puffed his cigar alight\r\nabsently and went on.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't going to be easy. We won't have a chance to give the ship a\r\nshakedown cruise because once we take off we might as well keep\r\ngoing--which we will.\r\n\r\n\"You all know what the cargo is--Cargo Hold One contains the greatest\r\nsingle robotic brain ever built. Our job is to make sure it gets to our\r\ndestination in perfect condition.\"\r\n\r\n\"Question, sir,\" said Mike the Angel.\r\n\r\nWithout moving his head, Captain Quill lifted one huge eyebrow and\r\nglanced in Mike's direction. \"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't C.C. of E. build the brain on whatever planet we're going to\r\nin the first place?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're supposed to be told that in the briefing over at the C.C. of E.\r\nlabs in\"--he glanced at his watch--\"half an hour. But I think we can all\r\nget a little advance information. Most of you men have been around here\r\nlong enough to have some idea of what's going on, but I understand that\r\nMister Vaneski knows somewhat more about robotics than most of us. Do\r\nyou have any light to shed on this, Mister Vaneski?\"\r\n\r\nMike grinned to himself without letting it show on his face. The skipper\r\nwas letting the boot ensign redeem himself after the _faux pas_ he'd\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nVaneski started to stand up, but Quill made a slight motion with his\r\nhand and the boy relaxed.\r\n\r\n\"It's only a guess, sir,\" he said, \"but I think it's because the robot\r\nknows too much.\"\r\n\r\nQuill and the others looked blank, but Mike narrowed his eyes\r\nimperceptibly. Vaneski was practically echoing Mike's own deductions.\r\n\r\n\"I mean--well, look, sir,\" Vaneski went on, a little flustered, \"they\r\nstarted to build that thing ten years ago. Eight years ago they started\r\nteaching it. Evidently they didn't see any reason for building it off\r\nEarth then. What I mean is, something must've happened since then to\r\nmake them decide to take it off Earth. If they've spent all this much\r\nmoney to get it away, that must mean that it's dangerous somehow.\"\r\n\r\n\"If that's the case,\" said Captain Quill, \"why don't they just shut the\r\nthing off?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--\" Vaneski spread his hands. \"I think it's for the same reason. It\r\nknows too much, and they don't want to destroy that knowledge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you have any idea what that knowledge might be?\" Mike the Angel\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, I don't. But whatever it is, it's dangerous as hell.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe briefing for the officers and men of the _William Branchell_--the\r\n_Brainchild_--was held in a lecture room at the laboratories of the\r\nComputer Corporation of Earth's big Antarctic base.\r\n\r\nCaptain Quill spoke first, warning everyone that the project was secret\r\nand asking them to pay the strictest attention to what Dr. Morris\r\nFitzhugh had to say.\r\n\r\nThen Fitzhugh got up, his face ridged with nervousness. He assumed the\r\nair of a university professor, launching himself into his speech as\r\nthough he were anxious to get through it in a given time without\r\nfinishing too early.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure you're all familiar with the situation,\" he said, as though\r\napologizing to everyone for telling them something they already\r\nknew--the apology of the learned man who doesn't want anyone to think\r\nhe's being overly proud of his learning.\r\n\r\n\"I think, however, we can all get a better picture if we begin at the\r\nbeginning and work our way up to the present time.\r\n\r\n\"The original problem was to build a computer that could learn by\r\nitself. An ordinary computer can be forcibly taught--that is, a\r\ntechnician can make changes in the circuits which will make the robot do\r\nsomething differently from the way it was done before, or even make it\r\ndo something new.\r\n\r\n\"But what we wanted was a computer that could learn by itself, a\r\ncomputer that could make the appropriate changes in its own circuits\r\nwithout outside physical manipulation.\r\n\r\n\"It's really not as difficult as it sounds. You've all seen\r\nautoscribers, which can translate spoken words into printed symbols. An\r\nautoscriber is simply a machine which does what you tell it\r\nto--literally. Now, suppose a second computer is connected intimately\r\nwith the first in such a manner that the second can, on order, change\r\nthe circuits of the first. Then, all that is needed is....\"\r\n\r\nMike looked around him while the roboticist went on. The men were\r\nlooking pretty bored. They'd come to get a briefing on the reason for\r\nthe trip, and all they were getting was a lecture on robotics.\r\n\r\nMike himself wasn't so much interested in the whys and wherefores of the\r\ntrip; he was wondering why it was necessary to tell anyone--even the\r\ncrew. Why not just pack Snookums up, take him to wherever he was going,\r\nand say nothing about it?\r\n\r\nWhy explain it to the crew?\r\n\r\n\"Thus,\" continued Fitzhugh, \"it became necessary to incorporate into the\r\nbrain a physical analogue of Lagerglocke's Principle: 'Learning is a\r\nresult of an inelastic collision.'\r\n\r\n\"I won't give it to you symbolically, but the idea is simply that an\r\norganism learns _only_ if it does _not_ completely recover from the\r\neffects of an outside force imposed upon it. If it recovers completely,\r\nit's just as it was before. Consequently, it hasn't learned anything.\r\nThe organism _must change_.\"\r\n\r\nHe rubbed the bridge of his nose and looked out over the faces of the\r\nmen before him. A faint smile came over his wrinkled features.\r\n\r\n\"Some of you, I know, are wondering why I am boring you with this long\r\nrecital. Believe me, it's necessary. I want all of you to understand\r\nthat the machine you will have to take care of is not just an ordinary\r\ncomputer. Every man here has had experience with machinery, from the\r\nvery simplest to the relatively complex. You know that you have to be\r\ncareful of the kind of information--the kind of external force--you give\r\na machine.\r\n\r\n\"If you aim a spaceship at Mars, for instance, and tell it to go\r\n_through_ the planet, it might try to obey, but you'd lose the machine\r\nin the process.\"\r\n\r\nA ripple of laughter went through the men. They were a little more\r\nrelaxed now, and Fitzhugh had regained their attention.\r\n\r\n\"And you must admit,\" Fitzhugh added, \"a spaceship which was given that\r\nsort of information might be dangerous.\"\r\n\r\nThis time the laughter was even louder.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" the roboticist continued, \"if a mechanism is capable of\r\nlearning, how do you keep it from becoming dangerous or destroying\r\nitself?\r\n\r\n\"That was the problem that faced us when we built Snookums.\r\n\r\n\"So we decided to apply the famous Three Laws of Robotics propounded\r\nover a century ago by a brilliant American biochemist and philosopher.\r\n\r\n\"Here they are:\r\n\r\n\"'_One: A robot may not injure a human being, nor, through inaction,\r\nallow a human being to come to harm._'\r\n\r\n\"'_Two: A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except\r\nwhere such orders would conflict with the First Law._'\r\n\r\n\"'_Three: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such\r\nprotection does not conflict with the First or Second Law._'\"\r\n\r\nFitzhugh paused to let his words sink in, then: \"Those are the ideal\r\nlaws, of course. Even their propounder pointed out that they would be\r\nextremely difficult to put into practice. A robot is a logical machine,\r\nbut it becomes somewhat of a problem even to define a human being. Is a\r\nfive-year-old competent to give orders to a robot?\r\n\r\n\"If you define him as a human being, then he can give orders that might\r\nwreck an expensive machine. On the other hand, if you don't define the\r\nfive-year-old as human, then the robot is under no compulsion to refrain\r\nfrom harming the child.\"\r\n\r\nHe began delving into his pockets for smoking materials as he went on.\r\n\r\n\"We took the easy way out. We solved that problem by keeping Snookums\r\nisolated. He has never met any animal except adult human beings. It\r\nwould take an awful lot of explaining to make him understand the\r\ndifference between, say, a chimpanzee and a man. Why should a hairy pelt\r\nand a relatively low intelligence make a chimp non-human? After all,\r\nsome men are pretty hairy, and some are moronic.\r\n\r\n\"Present company excepted.\"\r\n\r\nMore laughter. Mike's opinion of Fitzhugh was beginning to go up. The\r\nman knew when to break pedantry with humor.\r\n\r\n\"Finally,\" Fitzhugh said, when the laughter had subsided, \"we must ask\r\nwhat is meant by 'protecting his own existence.' Frankly, we've been\r\ndriven frantic by that one. The little humanoid, caterpillar-track\r\nmechanism that we all tend to think of as Snookums isn't really\r\nSnookums, any more than a human being is a hand or an eye. Snookums\r\nwouldn't actually be threatening his own existence unless his brain--now\r\nin the hold of the _William Branchell_--is destroyed.\"\r\n\r\nAs Dr. Fitzhugh continued, Mike the Angel listened with about half an\r\near. His attention--and the attention of every man in the place--had\r\nbeen distracted by the entrance of Leda Crannon. She stepped in through\r\na side door, walked over to Dr. Fitzhugh, and whispered something in his\r\near. He nodded, and she left again.\r\n\r\nFitzhugh, when he resumed his speech, was rather more hurried in his\r\ndelivery.\r\n\r\n\"The whole thing can be summed up rather quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Point One: Snookums' brain contains the information that eight years of\r\nhard work have laboriously put into it. That information is more\r\nvaluable than the whole cost of the _William Branchell_; it's worth\r\nbillions. So the robot can't be disassembled, or the information would\r\nbe lost.\r\n\r\n\"Point Two: Snookums' mind is a strictly logical one, but it is\r\noperating in a more than logical universe. Consequently, it is unstable.\r\n\r\n\"Point Three: Snookums was built to conduct his own experiments. To\r\nforbid him to do that would be similar to beating a child for acting\r\nlike a child; it would do serious harm to the mind. In Snookums' case,\r\nthe randomity of the brain would exceed optimum, and the robot would\r\nbecome insane.\r\n\r\n\"Point Four: Emotion is not logical. Snookums can't handle it, except in\r\na very limited way.\"\r\n\r\nFitzhugh had been making his points by tapping them off on his fingers\r\nwith the stem of his unlighted pipe. Now he shoved the pipe back in his\r\npocket and clasped his hands behind his back.\r\n\r\n\"It all adds up to this: Snookums _must_ be allowed the freedom of the\r\nship. At the same time, every one of us must be careful not to ... to\r\npush the wrong buttons, as it were.\r\n\r\n\"So here are a few _don'ts_. Don't get angry with Snookums. That would\r\nbe as silly as getting sore at a phonograph because it was playing music\r\nyou didn't happen to like.\r\n\r\n\"Don't lie to Snookums. If your lies don't fit in with what he knows to\r\nbe true--and they won't, believe me--he will reject the data. But it\r\nwould confuse him, because he knows that humans don't lie.\r\n\r\n\"If Snookums asks you for data, qualify it--even if you know it to be\r\ntrue. Say: 'There may be an error in my knowledge of this data, but to\r\nthe best of my knowledge....'\r\n\r\n\"Then go ahead and tell him.\r\n\r\n\"But if you absolutely don't know the answer, tell him so. Say: 'I don't\r\nhave that data, Snookums.'\r\n\r\n\"Don't, unless you are....\"\r\n\r\nHe went on, but it was obvious that the officers and crew of the\r\n_William Branchell_ weren't paying the attention they should. Every one\r\nof them was thinking dark gray thoughts. It was bad enough that they had\r\nto take out a ship like the _Brainchild_, untested and jerry-built as\r\nshe was. Was it necessary to have an eight-hundred-pound, moron-genius\r\nchild-machine running loose, too?\r\n\r\nEvidently, it was.\r\n\r\n\"To wind it up,\" Fitzhugh said, \"I imagine you are wondering why it's\r\nnecessary to take Snookums off Earth. I can only tell you this: Snookums\r\nknows too much about nuclear energy.\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel smiled grimly to himself. Ensign Vaneski had been right;\r\nSnookums was dangerous--not only to individuals, but to the whole\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nSnookums, too, was a juvenile delinquent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Brainchild_ lifted from Antarctica at exactly 2100 hours, Greenwich\r\ntime. For three days the officers and men of the ship had worked as\r\nthough they were the robots instead of their passenger--or cargo,\r\ndepending on your point of view.\r\n\r\nSupplies were loaded, and the great engine-generators checked and\r\nrechecked. The ship was ready to go less than two hours before take-off\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe last passenger aboard was Snookums, although, in a more proper\r\nsense, he had always been aboard. The little robot rolled up to the\r\nelevator on his treads and was lifted into the body of the ship. Miss\r\nCrannon was waiting for him at the air lock, and Mike the Angel was\r\nstanding by. Not that he had any particular interest in watching\r\nSnookums come aboard, but he did have a definite interest in Leda\r\nCrannon.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, honey,\" said Miss Crannon as Snookums rolled into the air lock.\r\n\"Ready for your ride?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Leda,\" said Snookums in his contralto voice. He rolled up to her\r\nand took her hand. \"Where is my room?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come along; I'll show you in a minute. Do you remember Commander\r\nGabriel?\"\r\n\r\nSnookums swiveled his head and regarded Mike.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes. He tried to help me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you need help?\" Mike growled in spite of himself.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. For my experiment. And you offered help. That was very nice. Leda\r\nsays it is nice to help people.\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel carefully refrained from asking Snookums if he thought he\r\nwas people. For all Mike knew, he did.\r\n\r\nMike followed Snookums and Leda Crannon down the companionway.\r\n\r\n\"What did you do today, honey?\" asked Leda.\r\n\r\n\"Mostly I answered questions for Dr. Fitzhugh,\" said Snookums. \"He asked\r\nme thirty-eight questions. He said I was a great help. I'm nice, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure you are, darling,\" said Miss Crannon.\r\n\r\n\"Ye gods,\" muttered Mike the Angel.\r\n\r\n\"What's the trouble, Commander?\" the girl asked, widening her blue eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" said Mike the Angel, looking at her innocently with eyes that\r\nwere equally blue. \"Not a single solitary thing. Snookums is a sweet\r\nlittle tyke, isn't he?\"\r\n\r\nLeda Crannon gave him a glorious smile. \"I think so. And a lot of fun,\r\ntoo.\"\r\n\r\nVery seriously, Mike patted Snookums on his shiny steel skull. \"How old\r\nare you, little boy?\"\r\n\r\nLeda Crannon's eyes narrowed, but Mike pretended not to notice while\r\nSnookums said: \"Eight years, two months, one day, seven hours,\r\nthirty-three minutes and--ten seconds. But I am not a little boy. I am a\r\nrobot.\"\r\n\r\nMike suppressed an impulse to ask him if he had informed Leda Crannon of\r\nthat fact. Mike had been watching the girl for the past three days (at\r\nleast, when he'd had the time to watch) and he'd been bothered by the\r\ngirl's maternal attitude toward Snookums. She seemed to have wrapped\r\nherself up entirely in the little robot. Of course, that might simply be\r\nher method of avoiding Mike the Angel, but Mike didn't quite believe\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\"Come along to your room, dear,\" said Leda. Then she looked again at\r\nMike. \"If you'll wait just a moment, Commander,\" she said rather\r\nstiffly, \"I'd like to talk to you.\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel touched his forehead in a gentlemanly salute. \"Later,\r\nperhaps, Miss Crannon. Right now, I have to go to the Power Section to\r\nprepare for take-off. We're really going to have fun lifting this brute\r\nagainst a full Earth gee without rockets.\"\r\n\r\n\"Later, then,\" she said evenly, and hurried off down the corridor with\r\nSnookums.\r\n\r\nMike headed the other way with a sigh of relief. As of right then, he\r\ndidn't feel like being given an ear-reaming lecture by a beautiful\r\nredhead. He beetled it toward the Power Section.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChief Powerman's Mate Multhaus was probably the only man in the crew who\r\ncame close to being as big as Mike the Angel. Multhaus was two inches\r\nshorter than Mike's six-seven, but he weighed in at two-ninety. As a\r\npowerman, he was tops, and he gave the impression that, as far as power\r\nwas concerned, he could have supplied the ship himself by turning the\r\ncrank on a hand generator.\r\n\r\nBut neither Mike nor Multhaus approached the size of the Supply Officer,\r\nLieutenant Keku. Keku was an absolute giant. Six-eight, three hundred\r\nfifty pounds, and very little of it fat.\r\n\r\nWhen Mike the Angel opened the door of the Power Section's instrument\r\nroom, he came upon a strange sight. Lieutenant Keku and Chief Multhaus\r\nwere seated across a table from each other, each with his right elbow on\r\nthe table, their right hands clasped. The muscles in both massive arms\r\nstood out beneath the scarlet tunics. Neither man was moving.\r\n\r\n\"Games, children?\" asked Mike gently.\r\n\r\n_Whap!_ The chief's arm slammed to the table with a bang that sounded as\r\nif the table had shattered. Multhaus had allowed Mike's entrance to\r\ndistract him, while Lieutenant Keku had held out just an instant longer.\r\n\r\nBoth men leaped to their feet, Multhaus valiantly trying not to nurse\r\nhis bruised hand.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, sir,\" said Multhaus. \"We were just--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ne' mind. I saw. Who usually wins?\" Mike asked.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Keku grinned. \"Usually he does, Commander. All this beef\r\ndoesn't help much against a guy who really has pull. And Chief Multhaus\r\nhas it.\"\r\n\r\nMike looked into the big man's brown eyes. \"Try doing push-ups. With all\r\nyour weight, it'd really put brawn into you. Sit down and light up.\r\nWe've got time before take-off. That is, we do if Multhaus has\r\neverything ready for the check-off.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm ready any time you are, sir,\" Multhaus said, easing himself into a\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have a cigarette and then run 'em through.\"\r\n\r\nKeku settled his bulk into a chair and fired up a cigarette. Mike sat on\r\nthe edge of the table.\r\n\r\n\"Philip Keku,\" Mike said musingly. \"Just out of curiosity, what kind of\r\na name is Keku?\"\r\n\r\n\"Damfino,\" said the lieutenant. \"Sounds Oriental, doesn't it?\"\r\n\r\nMike looked the man over carefully, but rapidly. \"But you're not\r\nOriental--or at least, not much. You look Polynesian to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hit it right on the head, Commander. Hawaiian. My real name's\r\nKekuanaoa, but nobody could pronounce it, so I shortened it to Keku when\r\nI came in the Service.\"\r\n\r\nMike gave a short laugh. \"That accounts for your size. Kekuanaoa. A\r\nbranch of the old Hawaiian royal family, as I recall.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right.\" The big Hawaiian grinned. \"I've got a kid sister that\r\nweighs as much as you. And my granddad kicked off at ninety-four\r\nweighing a comfortable four-ten.\"\r\n\r\n\"What'd he die of, sir?\" Multhaus asked curiously.\r\n\r\n\"Concussion and multiple fractures. He slammed a Ford-Studebaker into a\r\npalm tree at ninety miles an hour. Crazy old ox; he was bigger than the\r\ndam' automobile.\"\r\n\r\nThe laughter of three big men filled the instrument room.\r\n\r\nAfter a few more minutes of bull throwing, Keku ground out his cigarette\r\nand stood up. \"I'd better get to my post; Black Bart will be calling\r\ndown any minute.\"\r\n\r\nAt that instant the PA system came alive.\r\n\r\n\"_Now hear this! Now hear this! Take-off in fifteen minutes! Take-off in\r\nfifteen minutes!_\"\r\n\r\nKeku grinned, saluted Mike the Angel, and walked out the door.\r\n\r\nMulthaus gazed after him, looking at the closed door.\r\n\r\n\"A blinking prophet, Commander,\" he said. \"A blinking prophet.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe take-off of the _Brainchild_ was not so easy as it might have\r\nappeared to anyone who watched it from the outside. As far as the\r\nexterior observers were concerned, it seemed to lift into the air with\r\na loud, thrumming noise, like a huge elevator rising in an invisible\r\nshaft.\r\n\r\nIt had been built in a deep pit in the polar ice, built around the huge\r\ncryotronic stack that was Snookums' brain. As it rose, electric motors\r\nslid back the roof that covered the pit, and the howling Antarctic winds\r\nroared around it.\r\n\r\nUnperturbed, it went on rising.\r\n\r\nInside, Mike the Angel and Chief Multhaus watched worriedly as the\r\nmeters wiggled their needles dangerously close to the overload mark. The\r\nthrumming of the ship as it fought its way up against the pull of\r\nEarth's gravity and through the Earth's magnetic field, using the fabric\r\nof space itself as the fulcrum against which it applied its power, was\r\nlike the vibration of a note struck somewhere near the bottom of a piano\r\nkeyboard, or the rumble of a contra bassoon.\r\n\r\nAs the intensity of the gravitational field decreased, the velocity of\r\nthe ship increased--not linearly, but logarithmically. She shrieked\r\nthrough the upper atmosphere, quivering like a live thing, and emerged\r\nat last into relatively empty space. When she reached a velocity of a\r\nlittle over thirty miles per second--relative to the sun, and\r\nperpendicular to the solar ecliptic--Mike the Angel ordered her engines\r\ncut back to the lowest power possible which would still retain the\r\none-gee interior gravity of the ship and keep the anti-acceleration\r\nfields intact.\r\n\r\n\"How does she look, Multhaus?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nBoth of the men were checking the readings of the instruments. A\r\ncomputerman second class was punching the readings into the small table\r\ncalculator as Multhaus read off the numbers.\r\n\r\n\"I think she weathered it, sir,\" the chief said cautiously, \"but she\r\nsure took a devil of a beating. And look at the power factor readings!\r\nWe were tossing away energy as though we were S-Doradus or something.\"\r\n\r\nThey worked for nearly an hour to check through all the circuits to find\r\nwhat damage--if any--had been done by the strain of Earth's\r\ngravitational and magnetic fields. All in all, the _Brainchild_ was in\r\npretty good shape. A few circuits needed retuning, but no replacements\r\nwere necessary.\r\n\r\nMulthaus, who had been understandably pessimistic about the ship's\r\nability to lift herself from the surface of even a moderate-sized planet\r\nlike Earth, looked with new respect upon the man who had designed the\r\npower plant that had done the job.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel called the bridge and informed Captain Quill that the\r\nship was ready for full acceleration.\r\n\r\nUnder control from the bridge, the huge ship yawed until her nose--and\r\nthus the line of thrust along her longitudinal axis--was pointed toward\r\nher destination.\r\n\r\n\"Full acceleration, Mister Gabriel,\" said Captain Quill over the\r\nintercom.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel watched the meters climb again as the ship speared away\r\nfrom the sun at an ever-increasing velocity. Although the apparent\r\ninternal acceleration remained at a cozy one gee, the acceleration in\r\nrelation to the sun was something fantastic. When the ship reached the\r\nvelocity of light, she simply disappeared, as far as external observers\r\nwere concerned. But she still kept adding velocity with her tremendous\r\nacceleration.\r\n\r\nFinally her engines reached their performance peak. They could drive the\r\n_Brainchild_ no faster. They simply settled down to a steady growl and\r\npushed the ship at a steady velocity through what the mathematicians\r\ntermed \"null-space.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Brainchild_ was on her way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What I want to know,\" said Lieutenant Keku, \"is, what kind of ship is\r\nthis?\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel chuckled, and Lieutenant Mellon, the Medical Officer,\r\ngrinned rather shyly. But young Ensign Vaneski looked puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, sir?\" he asked the huge Hawaiian.\r\n\r\nThey were sitting over coffee in the officers' wardroom. Captain Quill,\r\nFirst Officer Jeffers, and Lieutenant Commander von Liegnitz were on the\r\nbridge, and Dr. Fitzhugh and Leda Crannon were down below, giving\r\nSnookums lessons.\r\n\r\nMike looked at Lieutenant Keku, waiting for him to answer Vaneski's\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\"What do I mean? Just what I said, Mister Vaneski. I want to know what\r\nkind of ship this is. It is obviously not a warship, so we can forget\r\nthat classification. It is not an expeditionary ship; we're not\r\noutfitted for exploratory work. Is it a passenger vessel, then? No,\r\nbecause Dr. Fitzhugh and Miss Crannon are listed as 'civilian technical\r\nadvisers' and are therefore legally part of the crew. I'm wondering if\r\nit might be a cargo vessel, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure it is,\" said Ensign Vaneski. \"That brain in Cargo Hold One is\r\ncargo, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not certain,\" Keku said thoughtfully, looking up at the overhead,\r\nas if the answer might be etched there in the metal. \"Since it is built\r\nin as an intrinsic part of the ship, I don't know if it can be counted\r\nas cargo or not.\" He brought his gaze down to focus on Mike. \"What do\r\nyou think, Commander?\"\r\n\r\nBefore Mike the Angel could answer, Ensign Vaneski broke in with: \"But\r\nthe brain is going to be removed when we get to our destination, isn't\r\nit? That makes this a cargo ship!\" There was a note of triumph in his\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Keku's gaze didn't waver from Mike's face, nor did he say a\r\nword. For a boot ensign to interrupt like that was an impoliteness that\r\nKeku chose to ignore. He was waiting for Mike's answer as though Vaneski\r\nhad said nothing.\r\n\r\nBut Mike the Angel decided he might as well play along with Keku's gag\r\nand still answer Vaneski. As a full commander, he could overlook\r\nVaneski's impoliteness to his superiors without ignoring it as Keku was\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but the brain _won't_ be unloaded, Mister Vaneski,\" he said mildly.\r\n\"The ship will be _dismantled_--which is an entirely different thing.\r\nI'm afraid you can't call it a cargo ship on those grounds.\"\r\n\r\nVaneski didn't say anything. His face had gone red and then white, as\r\nthough he'd suddenly realized he'd committed a _faux pas_. He nodded his\r\nhead a little, to show he understood, but he couldn't seem to find his\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nTo cover up Vaneski's emotional dilemma, Mike addressed the Medical\r\nOfficer. \"What do you think, Mister Mellon?\"\r\n\r\nMellon cleared his throat. \"Well--it seems to me,\" he said in a dry,\r\nserious tone, \"that this is really a medical ship.\"\r\n\r\nMike blinked. Keku raised his eyebrows. Vaneski swallowed and jerked his\r\neyes away from Mike's face to look at Mellon--but still he didn't say\r\nanything.\r\n\r\n\"Elucidate, my dear Doctor,\" said Mike with interest.\r\n\r\n\"I diagnose it as a physician,\" Mellon said in the same dry, earnest\r\ntone. \"Snookums, we have been told, is too dangerous to be permitted to\r\nremain on Earth. I take this to mean that he is potentially capable of\r\ndoing something that would either harm the planet itself or a\r\nmajority--if not all--of the people on it.\" He picked up his cup of\r\ncoffee and took a sip. Nobody interrupted him.\r\n\r\n\"Snookums has, therefore,\" he continued, \"been removed from Earth in\r\norder to protect the health of that planet, just as one would remove a\r\npotentially malignant tumor from a human body.\r\n\r\n\"This is a medical ship. Q.E.D.\" And only then did he smile.\r\n\r\n\"Aw, now....\" Vaneski began. Then he shut his mouth again.\r\n\r\nWith an inward smile, Mike realized that Ensign Vaneski had been taking\r\nseriously an argument that was strictly a joke.\r\n\r\n\"Mister Mellon,\" Mike said, \"you win.\" He hadn't realized that Mellon's\r\nmind could work on that level.\r\n\r\n\"Hold,\" said Lieutenant Keku, raising a hand. \"I yield to no one in my\r\nadmiration for the analysis given by our good doctor; indeed, my\r\nadmiration knows no bounds. But I insist we hear from Commander Gabriel\r\nbefore we adjourn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not me,\" Mike said, shaking his head. \"I know when I'm beaten.\" He'd\r\nbeen going to suggest that the _Brainchild_ was a training ship, from\r\nSnookums' \"learning\" periods, but that seemed rather obvious and puerile\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at his watch, saw the time, and stood up. \"Excuse me,\r\ngentlemen; I have things to do.\" He had an appointment to talk to Leda\r\nCrannon, but he had no intention of broadcasting it.\r\n\r\nAs he closed the wardroom door, he heard Ensign Vaneski's voice saying:\r\n\"I _still_ say this should be classified as a cargo ship.\"\r\n\r\nMike sighed as he strode on down the companionway. The ensign was, of\r\ncourse, absolutely correct--which was the sad part about it, really. Oh\r\nwell, what the hell.\r\n\r\nLeda Crannon had agreed to have coffee with Mike in the office suite she\r\nshared with Dr. Fitzhugh. Mike had had one cup in the officers'\r\nwardroom, but even if he'd had a dozen he'd have been willing to slosh\r\ndown a dozen more to talk to Leda Crannon. It was not, he insisted to\r\nhimself, that he was in love with the girl, but she had intelligence and\r\npersonality in addition to her striking beauty.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, she had given Mike the Angel a dressing-down that had been\r\nquite impressive. She had not at all cared for the remarks he had made\r\nwhen Snookums was being loaded aboard--patting him on the head and\r\nasking him his age, for instance--and had told him so in no uncertain\r\nterms. Mike, feeling sheepish and knowing he was guilty, had accepted\r\nthe tongue-lashing and tendered an apology.\r\n\r\nAnd she had smiled and said: \"All right. Forget it. I'm sorry I got\r\nmad.\"\r\n\r\nHe knew he wasn't the only man aboard who was interested in Leda. Jakob\r\nvon Liegnitz, all Teutonic masterfulness and Old World suavity, had\r\nobviously made a favorable impression on her. Lew Mellon was often seen\r\nin deep philosophical discussions with her, his eyes never leaving her\r\nface and his earnest voice low and confidential. Both of them had known\r\nher longer than he had, since they'd both been stationed at Chilblains\r\nBase.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel didn't let either of them worry him. He had enough\r\nconfidence in his own personality and abilities to be able to take his\r\nown tack no matter which way the wind blew.\r\n\r\nBlithely opening the door of the office, Mike the Angel stepped inside\r\nwith a smile on his lips.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, good afternoon, Commander Gabriel,\" said Dr. Morris Fitzhugh.\r\n\r\nMike kept the smile on his face. \"Leda here?\"\r\n\r\nFitzhugh chuckled. \"No. Some problems came up with Snookums. She'll be\r\nin session for an hour yet. She asked me to convey her apologies.\" He\r\ngestured toward the coffee urn. \"But the coffee's all made, so you may\r\nas well have a cup.\"\r\n\r\nMike was thankful he had not had a dozen cups in the wardroom. \"I don't\r\nmind if I do, Doctor.\" He sat down while Fitzhugh poured a cup.\r\n\r\n\"Cream? Sugar?\"\r\n\r\n\"Black, thanks,\" Mike said.\r\n\r\nThere was an awkward silence for a few seconds while Mike sipped at the\r\nhot, black liquid. Then Mike said, \"Dr. Fitzhugh, you said, at the\r\nbriefing back on Earth, that Snookums knows too much about nuclear\r\nenergy. Can you be more specific than that, or is it too hush-hush?\"\r\n\r\nFitzhugh took out his briar and began filling it as he spoke. \"We don't\r\nwant this to get out to the general public, of course,\" he said\r\nthoughtfully, \"but, as a ship's officer, you can be told. I believe\r\nsome of your fellow officers know already, although we'd rather it\r\nwasn't discussed in general conversation, even among the officers.\"\r\n\r\nMike nodded wordlessly.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then.\" Fitzhugh gave the tobacco a final shove with his\r\nthumb. \"As a power engineer, you should be acquainted with the 'pinch\r\neffect,' eh?\"\r\n\r\nIt was a rhetorical question. The \"pinch effect\" had been known for over\r\na century. A jet of highly ionized gas, moving through a magnetic field\r\nof the proper structure, will tend to pinch down, to become narrower,\r\nrather than to spread apart, as a jet of ordinary gas does. As the\r\nscience of magnetohydrodynamics had progressed, the effect had become\r\nmore and more controllable, enabling scientists to force the nuclei of\r\nhydrogen, for instance, closer and closer together. At the end of the\r\nlast century, the Bending Converter had almost wrecked the economy of\r\nthe entire world, since it gave to the world a source of free energy.\r\nSam Bending's \"little black box\" converted ordinary water into helium\r\nand oxygen and energy--plenty of energy. A Bending Converter could be\r\nbuilt relatively cheaply and for small-power uses--such as powering a\r\nship or automobile or manufacturing plant--could literally run on air,\r\nsince the moisture content of ordinary air was enough to power the\r\nconverter itself with plenty of power left over.\r\n\r\nOvernight, all previous forms of power generation had become obsolete.\r\nWho would buy electric power when he could generate his own for next to\r\nnothing? Billions upon billions of dollars worth of generating equipment\r\nwere rendered valueless. The great hydroelectric dams, the hundreds of\r\nsteam turbines, the heavy-metal atomic reactors--all useless for power\r\npurposes. The value of the stock in those companies dropped to zero and\r\nstayed there. The value of copper metal fell like a bomb, with almost\r\nequally devastating results--for there was no longer any need for the\r\nmillions of miles of copper cable that linked the power plants with the\r\nconsumer.\r\n\r\nThe Depression of 1929-42 couldn't even begin to compare with The Great\r\nDepression of 1986-2000. Every civilized nation on Earth had been hit\r\nand hit hard. The resulting governmental collapses would have made the\r\ndisaster even more complete had not the then Secretary General of the\r\nUN, Perrot of Monaco, grabbed the reins of government. Like the\r\nAmericans Franklin Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln, he had forced through\r\nunconstitutional bills and taken extra-constitutional powers. And, like\r\nthose Americans, he had not done it for personal gain, but to preserve\r\nthe society. He had not succeeded in preserving the old society, of\r\ncourse, but he had built, almost single-handedly, a world government--a\r\nnew society on the foundations of the old.\r\n\r\nAll these thoughts ran through Mike the Angel's mind. He wondered if\r\nSnookums had discovered something that would be as much a disaster to\r\nthe world economy as the Bending Converter had been.\r\n\r\nFitzhugh got out his miniature flame thrower and puffed his pipe alight.\r\n\"Snookums,\" he said, \"has discovered a method of applying the pinch\r\neffect to lithium hydride. It's a batch reaction rather than a flow\r\nreaction such as the Bending Converter uses. But it's as simple to build\r\nas a Bending Converter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jesus,\" said Mike the Angel softly.\r\n\r\nLithium hydride. LiH. An atom of hydrogen to every atom of lithium. If a\r\nhydrogen nucleus is driven into the lithium nucleus with sufficient\r\nforce, the results are simple:\r\n\r\nLi^{7} + H^{1} --> 2He^{4} + energy\r\n\r\nAn atom of lithium-7 plus an atom of hydrogen-1 yields two atoms of\r\nhelium-4 and plenty of energy. One gram of lithium hydride would give\r\nnearly fifty-eight kilowatt-hours of energy in one blast. A pound of the\r\nstuff would be the equivalent of nearly seven _tons_ of TNT.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it was a nice, clean bomb. Nothing but helium, radiation,\r\nand heat. In the early nineteen fifties, such a bomb had been\r\nconstructed by surrounding the LiH with a fission bomb--the so-called\r\n\"implosion\" technique. But all that heavy metal around the central\r\nreaction created all kinds of radioactive residues which had a tendency\r\nto scatter death for hundreds of miles around.\r\n\r\nNow, suppose a man had a pair of tweezers small enough to pick up a\r\nsingle molecule of lithium hydride and pinch the two nuclei together. Of\r\ncourse, the idea is ridiculous--that is, the tweezer part is. But if the\r\npinch could be done in some other way....\r\n\r\nSnookums had done it.\r\n\r\n\"Homemade atomic bombs in your back yard or basement lab,\" said Mike the\r\nAngel.\r\n\r\nFitzhugh nodded emphatically. \"Exactly. We can't let that technique out\r\nuntil we've found a way to keep people from doing just that. The UN\r\nGovernment has inspection techniques that prevent anyone from building\r\nthe conventional types of thermonuclear bombs, but not the pinch bomb.\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel thought over what Dr. Fitzhugh had said. Then he said:\r\n\"That's not all of it. Antarctica is isolated enough to keep that\r\nknowledge secret for a long time--at least until safeguards could be\r\nset up. Why take Snookums off Earth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Snookums himself is dangerous,\" Fitzhugh said. \"He has a built-in\r\n'urge' to experiment--to get data. We can keep him from making\r\nexperiments that we know will be dangerous by giving him the data, so\r\nthat the urge doesn't operate. But if he's on the track of something\r\ntotally new....\r\n\r\n\"Well, you can see what we're up against.\" He thoughtfully blew a cloud\r\nof smoke. \"We think he may be on the track of the total annihilation of\r\nmatter.\"\r\n\r\nA dead silence hung in the air. The ultimate, the super-atomic bomb.\r\nTheoretically, the idea had been approached only in the assumption of\r\ncontact between ordinary matter and anti-matter, with the two canceling\r\neach other completely to give nothing but energy. Such a bomb would be\r\nnearly fifty thousand times as powerful as the lithium-hydride pinch\r\nbomb. That much energy, released in a few millimicroseconds, would make\r\nthe standard H-bomb look like a candle flame on a foggy night.\r\n\r\nThe LiH pinch bomb could be controlled. By using just a little of the\r\nstuff, it would be possible to limit the destruction to a neighborhood,\r\nor even a single block. A total-annihilation bomb would be much harder\r\nto control. The total annihilation of a single atom of hydrogen would\r\nyield over a thousandth of an erg, and matter just doesn't come in much\r\nsmaller packages than that.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" said Fitzhugh, \"we _had_ to get him off Earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Either that or stop him from experimenting,\" Mike said. \"And I assume\r\nthat wouldn't be good for Snookums.\"\r\n\r\n\"To frustrate Snookums would be to destroy all the work we have put into\r\nhim. His circuits would tend to exceed optimum randomity, and that would\r\nmean, in human terms, that he would be insane--and therefore worthless.\r\nAs a machine, Snookums is worth eighteen billion dollars. The\r\ninformation we have given him, plus the deductions and computations he\r\nhas made from that information, is worth....\" He shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\"Who knows? How can a price be put on knowledge?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _William Branchell_--dubbed _Brainchild_--fled Earth at ultralight\r\nvelocity, while officers, crew, and technical advisers settled down to\r\nroutine. The only thing that disturbed that routine was one particularly\r\nrestless part of the ship's cargo.\r\n\r\nSnookums was a snoop.\r\n\r\nCut off from the laboratories which had been provided for his special\r\nwork at Chilblains, he proceeded to interest himself in the affairs of\r\nthe human beings which surrounded him. Until his seventh year, he had\r\nbeen confined to the company of only a small handful of human beings.\r\nEven while the _William Branchell_ was being built, he hadn't been\r\nallowed any more freedom than was absolutely necessary to keep him from\r\nbeing frustrated.\r\n\r\nEven so, he had developed an interest in humans. Now he was being\r\nallowed full rein in his data-seeking circuits, and he chose to\r\ninvestigate, not the physical sciences, but the study of Mankind. Since\r\nthe proper study of Mankind is Man, Snookums proceeded to study the\r\npeople on the ship.\r\n\r\nWithin three days the officers had evolved a method of\r\nSnookums-evasion.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Commander Jakob von Liegnitz sat in the officers' wardroom of\r\nthe _Brainchild_ and shuffled a deck of cards with expert fingers.\r\n\r\nHe was a medium-sized man, five-eleven or so, with a barrel chest, broad\r\nshoulders, a narrow waist, and lean hips. His light brown hair was worn\r\nrather long, and its straight strands seemed to cling tightly to his\r\nskull. His gray eyes had a perpetual half-squint that made him look\r\neither sleepy or angry, depending on what the rest of his broad face was\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nHe dealt himself out a board of Four Cards Up and had gone through about\r\nhalf the pack when Mike the Angel came in with Lieutenant Keku.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Jake,\" said Keku. \"What's to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Get out two more decks,\" said Mike the Angel, \"and we can all play\r\nsolitaire.\"\r\n\r\nVon Liegnitz looked up sleepily. \"I could probably think of duller\r\nthings, Mike, but not just immediately. How about bridge?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll need a fourth,\" said Keku. \"How about Pete?\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel shook his head. \"Black Bart is sleeping--taking his\r\nbeauty nap. So Pete has the duty. How about young Vaneski? He's not a\r\nbad partner.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is out, too,\" said von Liegnitz. \"He also is on duty.\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel lifted an inquisitive eyebrow. \"Something busted? Why\r\nshould the Maintenance Officer be on duty right now?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is maintaining,\" said von Liegnitz with deliberate dignity, \"peace\r\nand order around here. He is now performing the duty of\r\nAnswerman-in-Chief. He's very good at it.\"\r\n\r\nMike grinned. \"Snookums?\"\r\n\r\nVon Liegnitz scooped the cards off the table and began shuffling them.\r\n\"Exactly. As long as Snookums gets his questions answered, he keeps\r\nhimself busy. Our young boot ensign has been assigned to the duty of\r\nkeeping that mechanical Peeping Tom out of our hair for an hour. By\r\nthen, it will be lunch time.\" He cleared his throat. \"We still need a\r\nfourth.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you ask me,\" said Lieutenant Keku, \"we need a fifth. Let's play\r\npoker instead.\"\r\n\r\nJakob von Liegnitz nodded and offered the cards for a cut.\r\n\r\n\"Deal 'em,\" said Mike the Angel.\r\n\r\nA few minutes less than an hour later, Ensign Vaneski slid open the door\r\nto the wardroom and was greeted by a triune chorus of hellos.\r\n\r\n\"Sirs,\" said Vaneski with pseudo formality, \"I have done my duty,\r\nexhausting as it was. I demand satisfaction.\"\r\n\r\nLieutenant Keku, upon seeing Mike the Angel dealt a second eight,\r\nflipped over his up cards and folded.\r\n\r\n\"Satisfaction?\" he asked the ensign.\r\n\r\nVaneski nodded. \"One hand of showdown for five clams. I have been\r\nplaying encyclopedia for that hunk of animated machinery for an hour.\r\nThat's above and beyond the call of duty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Raise a half,\" said Mike the Angel.\r\n\r\n\"Call,\" said von Liegnitz.\r\n\r\n\"Three eights,\" said Mike, flipping his hole card.\r\n\r\nVon Liegnitz shrugged, folded his cards, and watched solemnly while Mike\r\npulled in the pot.\r\n\r\n\"Vaneski wants to play showdown for a fiver,\" said Keku.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel frowned at the ensign for a moment, then relaxed and\r\nnodded. \"Not my game,\" he said, \"but if the Answerman wants a chance to\r\ncatch up, it's okay with me.\"\r\n\r\nThe four men each tossed a five spot into the center of the table and\r\nthen cut for deal. Mike got it and started dealing--five cards, face up,\r\nfor the pot.\r\n\r\nWhen three cards apiece had been dealt, young Vaneski was ahead with a\r\nking high. On the fourth round he grinned when he got a second king and\r\nMike dealt himself an ace.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth round Vaneski got a three, and his face froze as Mike dealt\r\nhimself a second ace.\r\n\r\nMike reached for the twenty.\r\n\r\n\"You deal yourself a mean hand, Commander,\" said Vaneski evenly.\r\n\r\nMike glanced at him sharply, but there was only a wry grin on the young\r\nensign's face.\r\n\r\n\"Luck of the idiot,\" said Mike as he pocketed the twenty. \"It's time for\r\nlunch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Next time,\" said Keku firmly, \"I'll take the Answerman watch, Mike. You\r\nand this kraut are too lucky for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I lose any more to the Angel,\" von Liegnitz said calmly, \"I will be\r\na very sour kraut. But right now, I'm quite hungry.\"\r\n\r\nMike prowled around the Power Section that afternoon with a worry\r\nnagging at the back of his mind. He couldn't exactly put his finger on\r\nwhat was bothering him, and he finally put it down to just plain nerves.\r\n\r\nAnd then he began to feel something--physically.\r\n\r\nWithin thirty seconds after it began, long before most of the others had\r\nnoticed it, Mike the Angel recognized it for what it was. Half a minute\r\nafter that, everyone aboard could feel it.\r\n\r\nA two-cycle-per-second beat note is inaudible to the human ear. If the\r\nhuman tympanum can't wiggle any faster than that, the auditory nerves\r\nrefuse to transmit the message. The wiggle has to be three or four\r\noctaves above that before the nerves will have anything to do with it.\r\nBut if the beat note has enough energy in it, a man doesn't have to hear\r\nit--he can _feel_ it.\r\n\r\nThe bugs weren't all out of the _Brainchild_, by any means, and the men\r\nknew it. She had taken a devil of a strain on the take-off, and\r\nsomething was about due to weaken.\r\n\r\nIt was the external field around the hull that had decided to goof off\r\nthis time. It developed a nice, unpleasant two-cycle throb that\r\nthreatened to shake the ship apart. It built up rapidly and then leveled\r\noff, giving everyone aboard the feeling that his lunch and his stomach\r\nwould soon part company.\r\n\r\nThe crew was used to it. They'd been on shakedown cruises before, and\r\nthey knew that on an interstellar vessel the word \"shakedown\" can have a\r\nvery literal meaning. The beat note wasn't dangerous, but it wasn't\r\npleasant, either.\r\n\r\nWithin five minutes everybody aboard had the galloping collywobbles and\r\nthe twittering jitters.\r\n\r\nMike and his power crew all knew what to do. They took their stations\r\nand started to work. They had barely started when Captain Quill's voice\r\ncame over the intercom.\r\n\r\n\"Power Section, this is the bridge. How long before we stop this beat\r\nnote?\"\r\n\r\n\"No way of telling, sir,\" said Mike, without taking his eyes off the\r\nmeter bank. \"Check A-77,\" he muttered in an aside to Multhaus.\r\n\r\n\"Can you give me a prognosis?\" persisted Quill.\r\n\r\nMike frowned. This wasn't like Black Bart. He knew what the prognosis\r\nwas as well as Mike did. \"Actually, sir, there's no way of knowing. The\r\nold _Gainsway_ shook like this for eight days before they spotted the\r\ntubes that were causing a four-cycle beat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why can't we spot it right off?\" Quill asked.\r\n\r\nMike got it then. Fitzhugh was listening in. Quill wanted Mike the Angel\r\nto substantiate his own statements to the roboticist.\r\n\r\n\"There are sixteen generator tubes in the hull--two at each end of the\r\nfour diagonals of an imaginary cube surrounding the ship. At least two\r\nof them are out of phase; that means that every one of them may have to\r\nbe balanced against every other one, and that would make a hundred and\r\ntwenty checks. It will take ten minutes if we hit it lucky and find the\r\nbad tubes in the first two tries, and about twenty hours if we hit on\r\nthe last try.\r\n\r\n\"That, of course, is presuming that there are only two out. If there are\r\nthree....\" He let it hang.\r\n\r\nMike grinned as Dr. Morris Fitzhugh's voice came over the intercom,\r\nconfirming his diagnosis of the situation.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't there any other way?\" asked Fitzhugh worriedly. \"Can't we stop\r\nthe ship and check them, so that we won't be subjected to this?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Fraid not,\" answered Mike. \"In the first place, cutting the external\r\nfield would be dangerous, if not deadly. The abrupt deceleration\r\nwouldn't be good for us, even with the internal field operating. In the\r\nsecond place, we couldn't check the field tubes if they weren't\r\noperating. You can't tell a bad tube just by looking at it. They'd still\r\nhave to be balanced against each other, and that would take the same\r\namount of time as it is going to take anyway, and with the same effects\r\non the ship. I'm sorry, but we'll just have to put up with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, for Heaven's sake do the best you can,\" Fitzhugh said in a\r\nworried voice. \"This beat is shaking Snookums' brain. God knows what\r\ndamage it may do unless it's stopped within a very few minutes!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do the best I can,\" said Mike the Angel carefully. \"So will every\r\nman in my crew. But about all anyone can do is wish us luck and let us\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Dr. Fitzhugh slowly. \"Yes. I understand. Thank you,\r\nCommander.\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel nodded curtly and went back to work.\r\n\r\nThings weren't bad enough as they were. They had to get worse. The\r\n_Brainchild_ had been built too fast, and in too unorthodox a manner.\r\nThe steady two-cycle throb did more damage than it would normally have\r\ndone aboard a non-experimental ship.\r\n\r\nTwelve minutes after the throb started, a feeder valve in the\r\npre-induction energy chamber developed a positive-feedback oscillation\r\nthat threatened to blow out the whole pre-induction stage unless it was\r\ndamped. The search for the out-of-phase external field tubes had to be\r\ndropped while the more dangerous flaw was tackled.\r\n\r\nMulthaus plugged in an emergency board and began to compensate by hand\r\nwhile the others searched frantically for the trouble.\r\n\r\nHand compensation of feeder-valve oscillation is pure intuition; if you\r\nwait until the meters show that damping is necessary, it may be too\r\nlate--you have to second-guess the machine and figure out what's coming\r\n_before_ it happens and compensate then. You not only have to judge\r\ntime, but magnitude; overcompensation is ruinous, too.\r\n\r\nMulthaus, the Chief Powerman's Mate, sat behind the emergency board, a\r\nvernier dial in each hand and both eyes on an oscilloscope screen. His\r\nred, beefy face was corded and knotted with tension, and his skin\r\nglistened with oily perspiration. He didn't say a word, and his fingers\r\nbarely moved as he held a green line reasonably steady on that screen.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel, using unangelic language in a steady, muttering stream,\r\nworked to find the circuit that held the secret of the ruinous feedback\r\ntendency, while other powermen plugged and unplugged meter jacks,\r\nflipped switches, and juggled tools.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all this, in rolled Snookums.\r\n\r\nWhether Snookums knew that his own existence was in danger is\r\nproblematical. Like the human brain, his own had no pain or sensory\r\ncircuits within it; in addition, his knowledge of robotics was small--he\r\ndidn't even know that his brain was in Cargo Hold One. He thought it was\r\nin his head, if he thought about it at all.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, he knew _something_ was wrong, and as soon as his\r\n\"curiosity\" circuits were activated, he set out in search of the\r\ntrouble, his little treads rolling at high speed.\r\n\r\nLeda Crannon saw him heading down a companionway and called after him.\r\n\"Where are you going, Snookums?\"\r\n\r\n\"Looking for data,\" answered Snookums, slowing a little.\r\n\r\n\"Wait! I'll come with you!\"\r\n\r\nLeda Crannon knew perfectly well what effect the throb might have on\r\nSnookums' brain, and when something cracked, she wanted to see what\r\neffect it might have on the behavior of the little robot. Like a hound\r\nafter a fox, she followed him through the corridors of the ship.\r\n\r\nUp companionways and down, in and out of storerooms, staterooms, control\r\nrooms, and washrooms Snookums scurried, oblivious to the consternation\r\nthat sometimes erupted at his sudden appearance. At certain selected\r\nspots, Snookums would stop, put his metal arms on floors and walls,\r\npause, and then go zooming off in another direction with Leda Crannon\r\nonly paces behind him, trying to explain to crewmen as best she could.\r\n\r\nIf Snookums had been capable of emotion--and Leda Crannon was not as\r\nsure as the roboticists that he wasn't--she would have sworn that he was\r\nhaving the time of his life.\r\n\r\nSeventeen minutes after the throb had begun, Snookums rolled into Power\r\nSection and came to a halt. Something else was wrong.\r\n\r\nAt first he just stopped by the door and soaked in data. Mike's\r\nmuttering; the clipped, staccato conversation of the power crew; the\r\nnoises of the tools; the deep throb of the ship itself; the underlying\r\noddness of the engine vibrations--all these were fed into his\r\nmicrophonic ears. The scene itself was transmitted to his brain and\r\nrecorded. The cryotronic maze in the depths of the ship chewed the whole\r\nthing over. Snookums acted.\r\n\r\nLeda Crannon, who had lost ground in trying to keep up with Snookums'\r\nwhirling treads, came to the door of Power Section too late to stop the\r\nrobot's entrance. She didn't dare call out, because she knew that to do\r\nso would interrupt the men's vital work. All she could do was lean\r\nagainst the doorjamb and try to catch her breath.\r\n\r\nSnookums rolled over to the board where Multhaus was sitting and watched\r\nover his shoulder for perhaps thirty seconds. The crewmen eyed him, but\r\nthey were much too busy to do anything. Besides, they were used to his\r\npresence by this time.\r\n\r\nThen, in one quick tour of the room, Snookums glanced at every meter in\r\nthe place. Not just at the regular operating meters, but also at the\r\nmeters in the testing equipment that the power crew had jack-plugged in.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel looked around as he heard the soft purring of the\r\ncaterpillar treads. His glance took in both Snookums and Leda Crannon,\r\nwho was still gasping at the door. He watched Leda for the space of\r\nthree deep breaths, tore his eyes away, looked at what Snookums was\r\ndoing, then said: \"Get him out of here!\" in a stage whisper to Leda.\r\n\r\nSnookums was looking over the notations on the meter readings for the\r\nprevious few minutes. He had simply picked them up from the desk where\r\none of the computermen was working and scanned them rapidly before\r\nhanding them back.\r\n\r\nBefore Leda could say anything, Snookums rolled over to Mike the Angel\r\nand said: \"Check the lead between the 391-JF and the big DK-37. I think\r\nyou'll find that the piping is in phase with the two-cycle note, and\r\nit's become warped and stretched. It's about half a millimeter off--plus\r\nor minus a tenth. The pulse is reaching the DK-37 about four degrees\r\noff, and the gate is closing before it all gets through. That's forcing\r\nthe regulator circuit to overcompensate, and....\"\r\n\r\nMike didn't listen to any more. He didn't know whether Snookums knew\r\nwhat he was talking about or not, but he did know that the thing the\r\nrobot had mentioned would have had just such an effect.\r\n\r\nMike strode rapidly across the room and flipped up the shield housing\r\nthe assembly Snookums had mentioned. The lead was definitely askew.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel snapped orders, and the power crewmen descended on the\r\nscene of the trouble.\r\n\r\nSnookums went right on delivering his interpretation of the data, but\r\neveryone ignored him while they worked. Being ignored didn't bother\r\nSnookums in the least.\r\n\r\n\"... and that, in turn, is making the feeder valve field oscillate,\" he\r\nfinished up, nearly five minutes later.\r\n\r\nMike was glad that Snookums had pinpointed the trouble first and then\r\nhad gone on to show why the defect was causing the observed result. He\r\ncould just as easily have started with the offending oscillation and\r\nreached the bit about the faulty lead at the end of his speech, except\r\nthat he had been built to do it the other way around. Snookums made the\r\ndeduction in his superfast mind and then reeled it off backward, as it\r\nwere, going from conclusion to premises.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, he might have been too late.\r\n\r\nThe repair didn't take long, once Snookums had found just what needed\r\nrepairing. When the job was over, Mike the Angel wiped his hands on a\r\nrag and stood up.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Snookums,\" he said honestly. \"You've been a great help.\"\r\n\r\nSnookums said: \"I am smiling. Because I am pleased.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no way for him to smile with a steel face, but Mike got the\r\nidea.\r\n\r\nMike turned to the Chief Powerman's Mate. \"Okay, Multhaus, shut it off.\r\nShe's steady now.\"\r\n\r\nMulthaus just sat there, surrounded by a wall of concentration, his\r\nhands still on the verniers, his eyes still on the screen. He didn't\r\nmove.\r\n\r\nMike flipped off the switch. \"Come on, Multhaus, snap to. We've still\r\ngot that beat note to worry about.\"\r\n\r\nMulthaus blinked dizzily as the green line vanished from his sight. He\r\njerked his hands off the verniers, and then smiled sheepishly. He had\r\nbeen sitting there waiting for that green line to move a full minute\r\nafter the input signal had ceased.\r\n\r\n\"Happy hypnosis,\" said Mike. \"Let's get back to finding out which of\r\nthose tubes in the hull is giving the external field the willies.\"\r\n\r\nSnookums, who had been listening carefully, rolled up and said,\r\n\"Generator tubes three, four, and thirteen. Three is out of phase by--\"\r\n\r\n\"You can tell us later, Snookums,\" Mike interrupted rapidly. \"Right now,\r\nwe'll get to work on those tubes. You were right once; I hope you're\r\nright again.\"\r\n\r\nAgain the power crew swung into action.\r\n\r\nWithin five minutes Mike and Multhaus were making the proper adjustments\r\non the external field circuits to adjust for the wobbling of the output.\r\n\r\nThe throb wavered. It wobbled around, going up to two-point-seven cycles\r\nand dropping back to one-point-four, then climbing again. All the time,\r\nit was dropping in magnitude, until finally it could no longer be felt.\r\nFinally, it dropped suddenly to a low of point-oh-five cycles, hovered\r\nthere for a moment, then vanished altogether.\r\n\r\n\"By the beard of my sainted maiden aunt,\" said Chief Multhaus in awe. \"A\r\nthree-tube offbeat solved in less than half an hour! If that isn't a\r\nrecord, I'll dye my uniform black and join the Chaplains' Corps.\"\r\n\r\nLeda Crannon, looking tired but somehow pleased, said softly: \"May I\r\ncome in?\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel grinned. \"Sure. Maybe you can--\"\r\n\r\nThe intercom clicked on. \"Power Section, this is the bridge.\" It was\r\nBlack Bart. \"Are my senses playing me false, or have you stopped that\r\nbeat note?\"\r\n\r\n\"All secure, sir,\" said Mike the Angel. \"The system is stable now.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many tubes were goofing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Three of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Three!_\" There was astonishment in the captain's voice. \"How did you\r\never solve a three-tube beat in that short a time?\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel grinned up at the eye in the wall.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing to it, sir,\" he said. \"A child could have done it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\n\r\nLeda Crannon sat down on the edge of the bunk in Mike the Angel's\r\nstateroom, accepted the cigarette and light that Mike had proffered, and\r\nwaited while Mike poured a couple of cups of coffee from the insul-jug\r\non his desk.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could offer you something stronger, but I'm not much of a\r\ndrinker myself, so I don't usually take advantage of the officer's\r\nprerogative to smuggle liquor aboard,\" he said as he handed her the cup.\r\n\r\nShe smiled up at him. \"That's all right; I rarely drink, and when I do,\r\nit's either wine or a _very_ diluted highball. Right now, this coffee\r\nwill do me more good.\"\r\n\r\nMike heard footsteps coming down the companionway. He glanced out\r\nthrough the door, which he had deliberately left open. Ensign Vaneski\r\nwalked by, glanced in, grinned, and went on his way. The kid had good\r\nsense, Mike thought. He hoped any other passers-by would stay out while\r\nhe talked to Leda.\r\n\r\n\"Does a thing like that happen often?\" the girl asked. \"Not the fast\r\nsolution; I mean the beat note.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Mike the Angel. \"Once the system is stabilized, the tubes\r\ntend to keep each other in line. But because of that very tendency, an\r\noffbeat tube won't show itself for a while. The system tries to keep the\r\nbad ones in phase in spite of themselves. But eventually one of them\r\nsort of rebels, and that frees any of the others that are offbeat, so\r\nthe bad ones all show at once and we can spot them. When we get all the\r\nbad ones adjusted, the system remains stable for the operating life of\r\nthe system.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that's the purpose of a shakedown cruise?\"\r\n\r\n\"One of the reasons,\" agreed Mike. \"If the tubes are going to act up,\r\nthey'll do it in the first five hundred operating hours--except in\r\nunusual cases. That's one of the things that bothered me about the way\r\nthis crate was hashed together.\"\r\n\r\nHer blue eyes widened. \"I thought this was a well-built ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it is, it is--all things considered. It isn't dangerous, if that's\r\nwhat you're worried about. But it sure as the devil is expensively\r\nwasteful.\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded and sipped at her coffee. \"I know that. But I don't see any\r\nother way it could have been done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither do I, right off the bat,\" Mike admitted. He took a good swallow\r\nof the hot liquid in his cup and said: \"I wanted to ask you two\r\nquestions. First, what was it that Snookums was doing just before he\r\ncame into the Power Section? Black Bart said he'd been galloping all\r\nover the ship, with you at his heels.\"\r\n\r\nHer infectious smile came back. \"He was playing seismograph. He was\r\nsimply checking the intensity of the vibrations at different points in\r\nthe ship. That gave him part of the data he needed to tell you which of\r\nthe tubes were acting up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm beginning to think,\" said Mike, \"that we'll have to start building\r\na big brain aboard every ship--that is, if we can learn enough about\r\nsuch monsters from Snookums.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was the other question?\" Leda asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh.... Well, I was wondering just why you are connected with this\r\nproject. What does a psychologist have to do with robots? If you'll\r\npardon my ignorance.\"\r\n\r\nThis time she laughed softly, and Mike thought dizzily of the gay\r\nchiming of silver bells. He clamped down firmly on the romantic\r\nwanderings of his mind as she started her explanation.\r\n\r\n\"I'm a specialist in child psychology, Mike. Actually, I was hired as an\r\nexperiment--or, rather, as the result of a wild guess that happened to\r\nwork. You see, the first two times Snookums' brain was activated, the\r\ncircuits became disoriented.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean,\" said Mike the Angel, \"they went nuts.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed again. \"Don't let Fitz hear you say that. He'll tell you\r\nthat 'the circuits exceeded their optimum randomity limit.'\"\r\n\r\nMike grinned, remembering the time he had driven a robot brain daffy by\r\nbluffing it at poker. \"How did that happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we don't know all the details, but it seems to have something to\r\ndo with the slow recovery rate that's necessary for learning. Do you\r\nknow anything about Lagerglocke's Principle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fitzhugh mentioned something about it in the briefing we got before\r\ntake-off. Something about a bit of learning being an inelastic rebound.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it. You take a steel ball, for instance, and drop it on a steel\r\nplate from a height of three or four feet. It bounces--almost perfect\r\nelasticity. The next time you drop it, it does the same thing. It hasn't\r\nlearned anything.\r\n\r\n\"But if you drop a lead ball, it doesn't bounce as much, and it will\r\nflatten at the point of contact. _The next time it falls on that flat\r\nside, its behavior will be different._ It has learned something.\"\r\n\r\nMike rubbed the tip of an index finger over his chin. \"These\r\nillustrations are analogues of the human mind?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right. Some people have minds like steel balls. They can learn,\r\nbut you have to hit them pretty hard to make them do it. On the other\r\nhand, some people have minds like glass balls: They can't learn at all.\r\nIf you hit them hard enough to make a real impression, they simply\r\nshatter.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. Now what has this got to do with you and Snookums?\"\r\n\r\n\"Patience, boy, patience,\" Leda said with a grin. \"Actually, the\r\nlead-ball analogy is much too simple. An intelligent mind has to have\r\ntime to partially recover, you see. Hit it with too many shocks, one\r\nright after another, and it either collapses or refuses to learn or\r\nboth.\r\n\r\n\"The first two times the brain was activated, the roboticists just began\r\nfeeding data into the thing as though it were an ordinary computing\r\nmachine. They were forcing it to learn too fast; they weren't giving it\r\ntime to recover from the shock of learning.\r\n\r\n\"Just as in the human being, there is a difference between a robot's\r\nbrain and a robot's mind. The _brain_ is a physical thing--a bunch of\r\ncryotrons in a helium bath. But the _mind_ is the sum total of all the\r\ndata and reaction patterns and so forth that have been built into the\r\nbrain or absorbed by it.\r\n\r\n\"The brain didn't have an opportunity to recover from the learning\r\nshocks when the data was fed in too fast, so the mind cracked. It\r\ncouldn't take it. The robot went insane.\r\n\r\n\"Each time, the roboticists had to deactivate the brain, drain it of all\r\ndata, and start over. After the second time, Dr. Fitzhugh decided they\r\nwere going about it wrong, so they decided on a different tack.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said Mike the Angel. \"It had to be taught slowly, like a\r\nchild.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" said Leda. \"And who would know more about teaching a child\r\nthan a child psychologist?\" she added brightly.\r\n\r\nMike looked down at his coffee cup, watching the slight wavering of the\r\nsurface as it broke up the reflected light from the glow panels. He had\r\ninvited this girl down to his stateroom (he told himself) to get\r\ninformation about Snookums. But now he realized that information about\r\nthe girl herself was far more important.\r\n\r\n\"How long have you been working with Snookums?\" he asked, without\r\nlooking up from his coffee.\r\n\r\n\"Over eight years,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThen Mike looked up. \"You know, you hardly look old enough. You don't\r\nlook much older than twenty-five.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled--a little shyly, Mike thought. \"As Snookums says, 'You're\r\nnice.' I'm twenty-six.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you've been working with Snookums since you were eighteen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh-huh.\" She looked, very suddenly, much younger than even the\r\ntwenty-five Mike had guessed at. She seemed to be more like a somewhat\r\nbashful teen-ager who had been educated in a convent. \"I was what they\r\ncall an 'exceptional child.' My mother died when I was seven, and Dad\r\n... well, he just didn't know what to do with a baby girl, I guess. He\r\nwas a kind man, and I think he really loved me, but he just didn't know\r\nwhat to do with me. So when the tests showed that I was ... brighter ...\r\nthan the average, he put me in a special school in Italy. Said he didn't\r\nwant my mind cramped by being forced to conform to the mental norm.\r\nMaybe he even believed that himself.\r\n\r\n\"And, too, he didn't approve of public education. He had a lot of odd\r\nideas.\r\n\r\n\"Anyway, I saw him during summer vacations and went to school the rest\r\nof the year. He took me all over the world when I was with him, and the\r\ninstructors were pretty wonderful people; I'm not sorry that I was\r\nbrought up that way. It was a little different from the education that\r\nmost children have, but it gave me a chance to use my mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know the school,\" said Mike the Angel. \"That's the one under the\r\nCesare Alfieri Institute in Florence?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it; did you go there?\" There was an odd, eager look in her eyes.\r\n\r\nMike shook his head. \"Nope. But a friend of mine did. Ever know a guy\r\nnamed Paulvitch?\"\r\n\r\nShe squealed with delight, as though she'd been playfully pinched. \"Sir\r\nGay? You mean Serge Paulvitch, the Fiend of Florence?\" She pronounced\r\nthe name properly: \"_Sair_-gay,\" instead of \"surge,\" as too many people\r\nwere prone to do.\r\n\r\n\"Sounds like the same man,\" Mike admitted, grinning. \"As evil-looking as\r\nSatanas himself?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's Sir Gay, all right. Half the girls were scared of him, and I\r\nthink _all_ the boys were. He's about three years older than I am, I\r\nguess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why call him Sir Gay?\" Mike asked. \"Just because of his name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Partly. And partly because he was always such a gentleman. A real\r\n_nice_ guy, if you know what I mean. Do you know him well?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Know_ him? Hell, I couldn't run my business without him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your business?\" She blinked. \"But he works for--\" Then her eyes became\r\nvery wide, her mouth opened, and she pointed an index finger at Mike.\r\n\"Then you ... you're Mike the Angel! M. R. Gabriel! Sure!\" She started\r\nlaughing. \"I never connected it up! My golly, my golly! I thought you\r\nwere just another Space Service commander! Mike the Angel! Well, I'll be\r\ndarned!\"\r\n\r\nShe caught her breath. \"I'm sorry. I was just so surprised, that's all.\r\nAre you really _the_ M. R. Gabriel, of M. R. Gabriel, Power Design?\"\r\n\r\nMike was as close to being nonplused as he cared to be. \"Sure,\" he said.\r\n\"You mean you didn't know?\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \"No. I thought Mike the Angel was about sixty years\r\nold, a crotchety old genius behind a desk, as eccentric as a comet's\r\norbit, and wealthier than Croesus. You're just not what I pictured,\r\nthat's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just wait a few more decades,\" Mike said, laughing. \"I'll try to live\r\nup to my reputation.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you're Serge's boss. How is he? I haven't seen him since I was\r\nsixteen.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's grown a beard,\" said Mike.\r\n\r\n\"No!\"\r\n\r\n\"Fact.\"\r\n\r\n\"My God, how horrible!\" She put her hand over her eyes in mock horror.\r\n\r\n\"Let's talk about you,\" said Mike. \"You're much prettier than Serge\r\nPaulvitch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I should hope so! But really, there's nothing to tell. I went to\r\nschool. B.S. at fourteen, M.S. at sixteen, Ph.D. at eighteen. Then I\r\nwent to work for C.C. of E., and I've been there ever since. I've never\r\nbeen engaged, I've never been married, and I'm still a virgin. Anything\r\nelse?\"\r\n\r\n\"No runs, no hits, no errors,\" said Mike the Angel.\r\n\r\nShe grinned back impishly. \"I haven't been up to bat yet, Commander\r\nGabriel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I suggest you grab some sort of club to defend yourself, because\r\nI'm going to be in there pitching.\"\r\n\r\nThe smile on her face faded, to be replaced by a look that was neither\r\nawe nor surprise, but partook of both.\r\n\r\n\"You really mean that, don't you?\" she asked in a hushed voice.\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" said Mike the Angel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCommander Peter Jeffers was in the Control Bridge when Mike the Angel\r\nstepped in through the door. Jeffers was standing with his back to the\r\ndoor, facing the bank of instruments that gave him a general picture of\r\nthe condition of the whole ship.\r\n\r\nOverhead, the great dome of the ship's nose allowed the gleaming points\r\nof light from the star field ahead to shine down on those beneath\r\nthrough the heavy, transparent shield of the cast transite and the\r\ninvisible screen of the external field.\r\n\r\nMike walked over and tapped Pete Jeffers on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Busy?\"\r\n\r\nJeffers turned around slowly and grinned. \"Hullo, old soul. Naw, I ain't\r\nbusy. Nothin' outside but stars, and we don't figger on gettin' too\r\nclose to 'em right off the bat. What's the beef?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have,\" said Mike the Angel succinctly, \"goofed.\"\r\n\r\nJeffers' keen eyes swept analytically over Mike the Angel's face. \"You\r\nwant a drink? I snuck a spot o' brandy aboard, and just by purty ole\r\ncoincidence, there's a bottle right over there in the speaker housing.\"\r\nWithout waiting for an answer, he turned away from Mike and walked\r\ntoward the cabinet that held the intercom speaker. Meantime, he went\r\nright on talking.\r\n\r\n\"Great stuff, brandy. French call it _eau de vie_, and that, in case you\r\ndon't know it, means 'water of life.' You want a little, eh, ol' buddy?\r\nSure you do.\" By this time, he'd come back with the bottle and a pair of\r\nglasses and was pouring a good dose into each one. \"On the other hand,\r\nthe Irish gave us our name for whisky. Comes from _uisge-beatha_, and by\r\nsome bloody peculiar coincidence, that also means 'water of life.' So\r\nyou just set yourself right down here and get some life into you.\"\r\n\r\nMike sat down at the computer table, and Jeffers sat down across from\r\nhim. \"Now you just drink on up, buddy-buddy and then tell your ol' Uncle\r\nPete what the bloody hell the trouble is.\"\r\n\r\nMike looked at the brandy for a full half minute. Then, with one quick\r\nflip of his wrist and a sudden spasmodic movement of his gullet, he\r\ndowned it.\r\n\r\nThen he took a deep breath and said: \"Do I look as bad as all that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Worse,\" said Jeffers complacently, meanwhile refilling Mike's glass.\r\n\"While we were on active service together, I've seen you go through all\r\nkinds of things and never look like this. What is it? Reaction from\r\nthis afternoon's--or, pardon me--_yesterday_ afternoon's emergency?\"\r\n\r\nMike glanced up at the chronometer. It was two-thirty in the morning,\r\nGreenwich time. Jeffers held the bridge from midnight till noon, while\r\nBlack Bart had the noon to midnight shift.\r\n\r\nStill, Mike hadn't realized that it was as late as all that.\r\n\r\nHe looked at Jeffers' lean, bony face. \"Reaction? No, it's not that.\r\nLook, Pete, you know me. Would you say I was a pretty levelheaded guy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"My old man always said, 'Never make an enemy accidentally,' and I think\r\nhe was right. So I usually think over what I say before I open my big\r\nmouth, don't I?\"\r\n\r\nAgain Jeffers said, \"Sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't call myself over-cautious,\" Mike persisted, \"but I usually\r\nthink a thing through pretty carefully before I act--that is, if I have\r\ntime. Right?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd say so,\" Jeffers admitted. \"I'd say you were about the only guy I\r\nknow who does the right thing more than 90 per cent of the time. And\r\nsays the right thing more than 99 per cent of the time. So what do you\r\nwant? Back-patting, or just hero worship?\"\r\n\r\nMike took a small taste of the brandy. \"Neither, you jerk. But about\r\neight hours ago I said something that I hadn't planned to say. I\r\npractically proposed to Leda Crannon without knowing I was going to.\"\r\n\r\nPeter Jeffers didn't laugh. He simply said, \"How'd it happen?\"\r\n\r\nMike told him.\r\n\r\nWhen Mike had finished, one drink later, Peter Jeffers filled the\r\nglasses for the third time and leaned back in his chair. \"Tell me one\r\nthing, ol' buddy, and think about it before you answer. If you had a\r\nchance to get out of it gracefully, would you take back what you said?\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel thought it over. The sweep hand on the chronometer made\r\nits rounds several times before he answered. Then, at last, he said:\r\n\"No. No, I wouldn't.\"\r\n\r\nJeffers pursed his lips, then said judicially: \"In that case, you're not\r\ndoing badly at all. There's nothing wrong with you except the fact that\r\nyou're in love.\"\r\n\r\nMike downed the third drink fast and stood up. \"Thanks, Pete,\" he said.\r\n\"That's what I was afraid of.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait just one stinkin' minute,\" said Jeffers firmly. \"Sit down.\"\r\n\r\nMike sat.\r\n\r\n\"What do you intend to do about it?\" Jeffers asked.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel grinned at him. \"What the hell else can I do but woo and\r\nwin the wench?\"\r\n\r\nJeffers grinned back at him. \"I reckon you know you got competition,\r\nhuh?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean Jake von Liegnitz?\" Mike's face darkened. \"I have the feeling\r\nhe's looking for something that doesn't include a marriage certificate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Love sure makes a man sound noble,\" said Jeffers philosophically. \"If\r\nyou mean that all he wants is to get Leda into the sack, you're prob'ly\r\nright. Normal reaction, I'd say. Can't blame Jake for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't,\" said Mike. \"But that doesn't mean I can't spike his guns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Course not. Again, a normal reaction.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about Lew Mellon?\" Mike asked.\r\n\r\n\"Lew?\" Jeffers raised his eyebrows. \"I dunno. I think he likes to talk\r\nto her, is all. But if he _is_ interested, he's bloody well serious.\r\nHe's a strict Anglo-Catholic, like yourself.\"\r\n\r\n_I'm not as strict as I ought to be_, Mike thought. \"I thought he had a\r\nrather monkish air about him,\" he said aloud.\r\n\r\nJeffers chuckled. \"Yeah, but I don't think he's so ascetic that he\r\nwouldn't marry.\" His grin broadened. \"Now, if we were still at ol'\r\nChilblains, you'd _really_ have competition. After all, you can't expect\r\nthat a gal who's stacked ... pardon me ... who has the magnificent\r\nphysical and physiognomical topography of Leda Crannon to spend her life\r\nbein' ignored, now can you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nope,\" said Mike the Angel.\r\n\r\n\"Now, I figger,\" Jeffers said, \"that you can purty much forget about Lew\r\nMellon. But Jakob von Liegnitz is a chromatically variant equine,\r\nindeed.\"\r\n\r\nMike shook his head vigorously, as if to clear away the fog. \"_Pfui!_\r\nLet's change the subject. My heretofore nimble mind has been coagulated\r\nby a pair of innocent blue eyes. I need my skull stirred up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a limerick,\" said Jeffers lightly. \"It's about a young spaceman\r\nnamed Mike, who said: 'I can do as I like!' And to prove his bright\r\nquip, he took a round trip, clear to Sirius B on a bike. Or, the tale of\r\nthe pirate, Black Bart, whose head was as hard as his heart. When he\r\nfound--\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough!\" Mike the Angel held up a hand. \"That distillate of fine old\r\ngrape has made us both silly. Good night. I'm going to get some sleep.\"\r\nHe stood up and winked at Jeffers. \"And thanks for listening while I\r\nbent your ear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any time at all, ol' amoeba. And if you ever feel you need some advice\r\nfrom an ol' married man, why you just trot right round, and I'll give\r\nyou plenty of bad advice.\"\r\n\r\n\"At least you're honest,\" Mike said. \"Night.\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel left the bridge as Commander Jeffers was putting the\r\nbrandy back in its hiding place.\r\n\r\nMike went to his quarters, hit the sack, and spent less than five\r\nminutes getting to sleep. There was nothing worrying him now.\r\n\r\nHe didn't know how long he'd been asleep when he heard a noise in the\r\ndarkness of his room that made him sit up in bed, instantly awake. The\r\nfloater under him churned a little, but there was no noise. The room was\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nIn the utter blackness of the room, Mike the Angel could see nothing,\r\nand he could hear nothing but the all-pervading hum of the ship's\r\nengines. But he could still feel and smell.\r\n\r\nHe searched back in his memory, trying to place the sound that had\r\nawakened him. It hadn't been loud, merely unusual. It had been a noise\r\nthat shouldn't have been made in the stateroom. It had been a quiet\r\nsound, really, but for the life of him, Mike couldn't remember what it\r\nhad sounded like.\r\n\r\nBut the evidence of his nerves told him there was someone else in the\r\nroom besides himself. Somewhere near him, something was radiating heat;\r\nit was definitely perceptible in the air-conditioned coolness of his\r\nroom. And, too, there was the definite smell of warm oil--machine oil.\r\nIt was faint, but it was unmistakable.\r\n\r\nAnd then he knew what the noise had been.\r\n\r\nThe soft purr of caterpillar treads against the floor!\r\n\r\nCasually, Mike the Angel moved his hand to the wall plaque and touched\r\nit lightly. The lights came on, dim and subdued.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Snookums,\" said Mike the Angel gently. \"What are you here for?\"\r\n\r\nThe little robot just stood there for a second or two, unmoving, his\r\nwaldo hands clasped firmly in front of his chest. Mike suddenly wished\r\nto Heaven that the metallic face could show something that Mike could\r\nread.\r\n\r\n\"I came for data,\" said Snookums at last, in the contralto voice that so\r\nresembled the voice of the woman who had trained him.\r\n\r\nMike started to say, \"At this time of night?\" Then he glanced at his\r\nwrist. It was after seven-thirty in the morning, Greenwich time--which\r\nwas also ship time.\r\n\r\n\"What is it you want?\" Mike asked.\r\n\r\n\"Can you dance?\" asked Snookums.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mike dazedly, \"I can dance.\" For a moment he had the wild\r\nidea that Snookums was going to ask him to do a few turns about the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Snookums. His treads whirred, he turned as though on a\r\npivot, whizzed to the door, opened it, and was gone.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel stared at the door as though trying to see beyond it,\r\ninto the depths of the robot's brain itself.\r\n\r\n\"Now just what was _that_ all about?\" he asked aloud.\r\n\r\nIn the padded silence of the stateroom, there wasn't even an echo to\r\nanswer him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14\r\n\r\n\r\nMike the Angel spent the next three days in a pale blue funk which he\r\nstruggled valiantly against, at least to prevent it from becoming a deep\r\nblue.\r\n\r\nThere was something wrong aboard the _Brainchild_, and Mike simply\r\ncouldn't quite figure what it was. He found that he wasn't the only one\r\nwho had been asked peculiar questions by Snookums. The little robot\r\nseemed to have developed a sudden penchant for asking seemingly inane\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Keku reported with a grin that Snookums had asked him if he\r\nknew who Commander Gabriel _really_ was.\r\n\r\n\"What'd you say?\" Mike had asked.\r\n\r\nKeku had spread his hands and said: \"I gave him the usual formula about\r\nnot being positive of my data, then I told him that you were known as\r\nMike the Angel and were well known in the power field.\"\r\n\r\nMulthaus reported that Snookums had wanted to know what their\r\ndestination was. The chief's only possible answer, of course, had been:\r\n\"I don't have that data, Snookums.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Morris Fitzhugh had become more worried-looking than usual and had\r\nconfided to Mike that he, too, wondered why Snookums was asking such\r\npeculiar questions.\r\n\r\n\"All he'll tell me,\" the roboticist had reported, wrinkling up his face,\r\n\"was that he was collecting data. But he flatly refused, even when\r\nordered, to tell me what he needed the data for.\"\r\n\r\nMike stayed away from Leda Crannon as much as possible; shipboard was no\r\nplace to try to conduct a romance. Not that he deliberately avoided her\r\nin such a manner as to give offense, but he tried to appear busy at all\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nShe was busy, too. Keeping herd on Snookums was becoming something of a\r\nproblem. She had never attempted to watch him all the time. In the first\r\nplace, it was physically impossible; in the second place, she didn't\r\nthink Snookums would develop properly if he were to be kept under\r\nconstant supervision. But now, for the first time, she didn't have the\r\nfoggiest notion of what was going on inside the robot's mind, and she\r\ncouldn't find out. It puzzled and worried her, and between herself and\r\nDr. Fitzhugh there were several long conferences on Snookums' peculiar\r\nbehavior.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel found himself waiting for something to happen. He hadn't\r\nthe slightest notion what it was that he was waiting for, but he was as\r\ncertain of its coming as he was of the fact that the Earth was an oblate\r\nspheroid.\r\n\r\nBut he certainly didn't expect it to begin the way it did.\r\n\r\nA quiet evening bridge game is hardly the place for a riot to start.\r\n\r\nPete Jeffers was pounding the pillow in his stateroom; Captain Quill was\r\non the bridge, checking through the log.\r\n\r\nIn the officers' wardroom Mike the Angel was looking down at two hands\r\nof cards, wondering whether he'd make his contract. His own hand held\r\nthe ace, nine, seven of spades; the ten, six, two of hearts; the jack,\r\nten, nine, four, three, and deuce of diamonds; and the eight of clubs.\r\n\r\nVaneski, his partner, had bid a club. Keku had answered with a take-out\r\ndouble. Mike had looked at his hand, figured that since he and Vaneski\r\nwere vulnerable, while Keku and von Liegnitz were not, he bid a weakness\r\npre-empt of three diamonds. Von Liegnitz passed, and Vaneski had\r\nanswered back with five diamonds. Keku and Mike had both passed, and von\r\nLiegnitz had doubled.\r\n\r\nNow Mike was looking at Vaneski's dummy hand. No spades; the ace, queen,\r\nfive, and four of hearts; the queen, eight, seven, and six of diamonds;\r\nand the ace, king, seven, four, and three of clubs.\r\n\r\nAnd von Liegnitz had led the three of hearts.\r\n\r\nIt didn't look good. His opponents had the ace and king of trumps, and\r\nwith von Liegnitz' heart lead, it looked as though he might have to try\r\na finesse on the king of hearts. Still, there _might_ be another way\r\nout.\r\n\r\nMike threw in the ace from dummy. Keku tossed in his seven, and Mike\r\nthrew in his own deuce. He took the next trick with the ace of clubs\r\nfrom dummy, and the singleton eight in his own hand. The one after that\r\ncame from dummy, too; it was the king of clubs, and Mike threw in the\r\nheart six from his own hand. From dummy, he led the three of clubs. Keku\r\nwent over it with a jack, but Mike took it with his deuce of diamonds.\r\n\r\nHe led the seven of spades to get back in dummy so he could use up those\r\nclubs. Dummy took the trick with the six of diamonds, and led out with\r\nthe four of clubs.\r\n\r\nMike figured that Keku must--absolutely _must_--have the king of hearts.\r\nBoth his take-out double and von Liegnitz' heart lead pointed toward the\r\nking in his hand. Now if....\r\n\r\nVaneski had moved around behind Mike to watch the play. Not one of them\r\nnoticed Lieutenant Lew Mellon, the Medical Officer, come into the room.\r\n\r\nThat is, they knew he had come in, but they had ignored him thereafter.\r\nHe was such a colorless nonentity that he simply seemed to fade into the\r\nbackground of the walls once he had made his entrance.\r\n\r\nMike had taken seven tricks, and, as he had expected, lost the eighth to\r\nvon Liegnitz' five of diamonds. When the German led the nine of hearts,\r\nMike knew he had the game. He put in the queen from dummy, Keku tossed\r\nin his king triumphantly, and Mike topped it with his lowly four of\r\ndiamonds.\r\n\r\nIf, as he suspected, his opponents' ace and king of diamonds were split,\r\nhe would get them both by losing the next trick and then make a clean\r\nsweep of the board.\r\n\r\nHe threw in his nine of diamonds.\r\n\r\nHe just happened to glance at von Liegnitz as the navigator dropped his\r\nking.\r\n\r\nThen he lashed out with one foot, kicking at the leg of von Liegnitz'\r\nchair. At the same time, he yelled, \"Jake! Duck!\"\r\n\r\nHe was almost too late. Mellon, his face contorted with a mixture of\r\nanger and hatred, was standing just behind Jakob von Liegnitz. In one\r\nhand was a heavy spanner, which he was bringing down with deadly force\r\non the navigator's skull.\r\n\r\nVon Liegnitz' chair started to topple, and von Liegnitz himself spun\r\naway from the blow. The spanner caught him on the shoulder, and he\r\ngrunted in pain, but he kept on moving away from Mellon.\r\n\r\nThe medic screamed something and lifted the spanner again.\r\n\r\nBy this time, Keku, too, was on his feet, moving toward Mellon. Mike the\r\nAngel got behind Mellon, trying to grab at the heavy metal tool in\r\nMellon's hand.\r\n\r\nMellon seemed to sense him, for he jumped sideways, out of Mike's way,\r\nand kicked backward at the same time, catching Mike on the shin with his\r\nheel.\r\n\r\nVon Liegnitz had made it to his feet by this time and was blocking the\r\ndownward swing of Mellon's arm with his own forearm. His other fist\r\npistoned out toward Mellon's face. It connected, sending Mellon\r\nstaggering backward into Mike the Angel's arms.\r\n\r\nVon Liegnitz grabbed the spanner out of Mellon's hand and swung it\r\ntoward the medic's jaw. It was only inches away when Keku's hand grasped\r\nthe navigator's wrist.\r\n\r\nAnd when the big Hawaiian's hand clamped on, von Liegnitz' hand stopped\r\nalmost dead.\r\n\r\nMellon was screaming. \"You ----!\" He ran out a string of unprintable and\r\nalmost un-understandable words. \"I'll kill you! I'll do it yet! _You\r\nstay away from Leda Crannon!_\"\r\n\r\n\"Calm down, Doc!\" snapped Mike the Angel. \"What the hell's the matter\r\nwith you, anyway?\"\r\n\r\nVon Liegnitz was still straining, trying to get away from Keku to take\r\nanother swipe at the medic, but the huge Hawaiian held him easily. The\r\nnavigator had lapsed into his native German, and most of it was\r\nunintelligible, except for an occasional reference to various improbable\r\ncombinations of animal life.\r\n\r\nBut Mellon was paying no attention. \"You! I'll kill you! Lecher!\r\nDirty-minded, filthy....\"\r\n\r\nHe went on.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, unexpectedly, he smashed his heel down on Mike's toe. At\r\nleast, he tried to; he'd have done it if the toe had been there when his\r\nheel came down. But Mike moved it just two inches and avoided the blow.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, though, Mellon twisted, and Mike's forced shift of\r\nposition lessened his leverage on the man's shoulders and arms. Mellon\r\nalmost got away. One hand grabbed the wrench from von Liegnitz, whose\r\ngrip had been weakened by the paralyzing pressure of Keku's fingers.\r\n\r\nMike had no choice but to slam a hard left into the man's solar plexus.\r\nMellon collapsed like an unoccupied overcoat.\r\n\r\nBy this time, von Liegnitz had quieted down. \"Let go, Keku,\" he said.\r\n\"I'm all right.\" He looked down at the motionless figure on the deck.\r\n\"What the hell do you suppose was eating him?\" he asked quietly.\r\n\r\n\"How's your shoulder?\" Mike asked.\r\n\r\n\"Hurts like the devil, but I don't think it's busted. But why did he do\r\nit?\" he repeated.\r\n\r\n\"Sounds to me,\" said Keku dryly, \"that he was nutty jealous of you. He\r\ndidn't like the times you took Leda Crannon to the base movies while we\r\nwere at Chilblains.\"\r\n\r\nJakob von Liegnitz continued to look down at the smaller man in wonder.\r\n\"_Lieber Gott_\" he said finally. \"I only took her out a couple of times.\r\nI knew he liked her, but--\" He stopped. \"The guy must be off his\r\nbearings.\"\r\n\r\n\"I smelled liquor on his breath,\" said Mike. \"Let's get him down to his\r\nstateroom and lock him in until he sobers up. I'll have to report this\r\nto the captain. Can you carry him, Keku?\"\r\n\r\nKeku nodded and reached down. He put his hands under Mellon's armpits,\r\nlifted him to his feet, and threw him over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" said Mike the Angel. \"I'll walk behind you and clop him one if\r\nhe wakes up and gets wise.\"\r\n\r\nVaneski was standing to one side, his face pale, his expression blank.\r\n\r\nMike said: \"Jake, you and Vaneski go up and make the report to the\r\ncaptain. Tell him we'll be up as soon as we've taken care of Mellon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" said von Liegnitz, massaging his bruised shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Okay, Keku,\" said Mike, \"forward march.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLieutenant Keku thumbed the opener to Mellon's stateroom, shoved the\r\ndoor aside, stepped in, and slapped at the switch plaque. The plates\r\nlighted up, bathing the room in sunshiny brightness.\r\n\r\n\"Dump him on his sack,\" said Mike.\r\n\r\nWhile Keku put the unconscious Mellon on his bed, Mike let his gaze\r\nwander around the room. It was neat--almost too neat, implying\r\noverfussiness. The medical reference books were on one shelf, all in\r\nalphabetical order. Another shelf contained a copy of the _International\r\nEncyclopedia_, English edition, plus several dictionaries, including one\r\non medical terms and another on theological ones.\r\n\r\nOn the desk lay a copy of the Bible, York translation, opened to the\r\nBook of Tobit. Next to it were several sheets of blank paper and a small\r\ntraveling clock sat on them as a paperweight.\r\n\r\nHis clothing was hung neatly, in the approved regulation manner, with\r\nhis shoes in their proper places and his caps all lined up in a row.\r\n\r\nMike walked around the room, looking at everything.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter? What're you looking for?\" asked Keku.\r\n\r\n\"His liquor,\" said Mike the Angel.\r\n\r\n\"In his desk, lower left-hand drawer. You won't find anything but a\r\nbottle of ruby port; Mellon was never a drinker.\"\r\n\r\nMike opened the drawer. \"I probably won't find that, drunk as he is.\"\r\n\r\nSurprisingly enough, the bottle of wine was almost half full. \"Did he\r\nhave more than one bottle?\" Mike asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not so far as I know. Like I said, he didn't drink much. One slug of\r\nport before bedtime was about his limit.\"\r\n\r\nMike frowned. \"How does his breath smell to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not bad. Two or three drinks, maybe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mmmm.\" Mike put the bottle on top of the desk, then walked over to the\r\nsmall case that was standing near one wall. He lifted it and flipped it\r\nopen. It was the standard medical kit for Space Service physicians.\r\n\r\nThe intercom speaker squeaked once before Captain Quill's voice came\r\nover it. \"Mister Gabriel?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir?\" said Mike without turning around. There were no eyes in the\r\nprivate quarters of the officers and crew.\r\n\r\n\"How is Mister Mellon?\" A Space Service physician's doctorate is never\r\nused as a form of address; three out of four Space Service officers have\r\na doctor's degree of some kind, and there's no point in calling 75 per\r\ncent of the officers \"doctor.\"\r\n\r\nMike glanced across the room. Keku had finished stripping the little\r\nphysician to his underclothes and had put a cover over him.\r\n\r\n\"He's still unconscious, sir, but his breathing sounds all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"How's his pulse?\"\r\n\r\nKeku picked up Mellon's left wrist and applied his fingers to the artery\r\nwhile he looked at his wrist watch.\r\n\r\nMike said: \"We'll check it, sir. Wait a few seconds.\"\r\n\r\nFifteen seconds later, Keku multiplied by four and said: \"One-oh-four\r\nand rather weak.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd better get hold of the Physician's Mate,\" Mike told Quill. \"He's\r\nnot in good condition, either mentally or physically.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. As soon as the mate takes over, you and Mister Keku get up\r\nhere. I want to know what the devil has been going on aboard my ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are bloody well not the only one,\" said Mike the Angel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15\r\n\r\n\r\nMidnight, ship time.\r\n\r\nAnd, as far as the laws of simultaneity would allow, it was midnight in\r\nGreenwich, England. At least, when a ship returned from an interstellar\r\ntrip, the ship's chronometer was within a second or two, plus or minus,\r\nof Greenwich time. Theoretically, the molecular vibration clocks\r\nshouldn't vary at all. The fact that they did hadn't yet been\r\nsatisfactorily accounted for.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel tried to make himself think of clocks or the variations\r\nin space time or anything else equally dull, in the hope that it would\r\nput him to sleep.\r\n\r\nHe began to try to work out the derivation of the Beale equations, the\r\nequations which had solved the principle of the no-space drive. The ship\r\ndidn't move through space; space moved through the ship, which, of\r\ncourse, might account for the variation in time, because--\r\n\r\n--the time is out of joint.\r\n\r\n    _The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,\r\n    That ever I was born to set it right!_\r\n\r\n_Hamlet_, thought Mike. _Act One, the end of scene five._\r\n\r\nBut why had he been born to set it right? Besides, exactly what was\r\nwrong? There was something wrong, all right.\r\n\r\nAnd why from the end of the act? Another act to come? Something more to\r\nhappen? The clock will go round till another time comes. Watch the\r\nclock, the absolutely cuckoo clock, which ticked as things happened that\r\nmade almost no sense and yet had sense hidden in their works.\r\n\r\nThe good old Keku clock. Somewhere is icumen in, lewdly sing Keku. The\r\nMellon is ripe and climbing Jakob's ladder. And both of them playing\r\nFollow the Leda.\r\n\r\nAnd where were they heading? Toward some destination in the general\r\ndirection of the constellation Cygnus. The transformation equations work\r\nfine on an interstellar ship. Would they work on a man? Wouldn't it be\r\nnice to be able to transform yourself into a swan? Cygnus the Swan.\r\n\r\nAnd we'll _all_ play Follow the Leda....\r\n\r\nSomewhere in there, Mike the Angel managed to doze off.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe awoke suddenly, and his dream of being a huge black swan vanished,\r\nshattered into nothingness.\r\n\r\nThis time it had not been a sound that had awakened him. It had been\r\nsomething else, something more like a cessation of sound. A dying sigh.\r\n\r\nHe reached out and touched the switch plaque.\r\n\r\nNothing happened.\r\n\r\nThe room remained dark.\r\n\r\nThe room was strangely silent. The almost soundless vibration of the\r\nengines was still there, but....\r\n\r\nThe air conditioners!\r\n\r\nThe air in the stateroom was unmoving, static. There was none of the\r\nfaint breeze of moving air. Something had gone wrong with the low-power\r\ncircuits!\r\n\r\nNow how the hell could that happen? Not by accident, unless the accident\r\nwere a big one. It would take a tremendous amount of coincidence to put\r\nall three of the interacting systems out of order at once. And they all\r\n_had_ to go at once to cut the power from the low-load circuits.\r\n\r\nThe standard tap and the first and second stand-by taps were no longer\r\ntapping power from the main generators. The intercom was gone, too,\r\nalong with the air conditioners, the lights, and half a dozen other\r\nsub-circuits.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel scrambled out of bed and felt for his clothing, wishing\r\nhe had something as prosaic as an old-fashioned match, or even a\r\nflame-type cigarette lighter. He found his lighter in his belt pocket as\r\nhe pulled on his uniform. He jerked it out and thumbed it. In the utter\r\ndarkness, the orange-red glow gave more illumination than he had\r\nsupposed. If a man's eyes are adjusted to darkness, he can read print by\r\nthe glow of a cigarette, and the lighter's glow was brighter than that.\r\n\r\nStill, it wasn't much. If only he had a flashlight!\r\n\r\nFrom a distance, far down the companionway, he could hear voices. The\r\nmuffled sound that had awakened him had been the soft susurration of the\r\ndoor as it had slid open when the power died. Without the electrolocks\r\nto hold it closed, it had opened automatically. The doors in a spaceship\r\nare built that way, to make sure no one will be trapped in case of a\r\npower failure.\r\n\r\nMike dressed in a matter of seconds and headed toward the door.\r\n\r\nAnd stopped just before he stepped out.\r\n\r\nSomeone was outside. Someone, or--something.\r\n\r\nHe didn't know _how_ he knew, but he knew. He was as certain as if the\r\nlights had been on bright.\r\n\r\nAnd whoever was waiting out there didn't want Mike the Angel to know\r\nthat he was there.\r\n\r\nMike stood silent for a full second. That was long enough for him to get\r\nangry. Not the hot anger of hatred, but the cold anger of a man who has\r\nhad too many attempts on his life, who has escaped narrowly from an\r\nunseen plotter twice because of pure luck and does not intend to fall\r\nvictim to the dictum that \"the third time's a charm.\"\r\n\r\nHe realized that he was still holding the glowing cigarette lighter in\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n\"Damn!\" he muttered, as though to himself. \"I'd forget my ears if they\r\nweren't sewed down.\" Then he turned, heading back toward his bed, hoping\r\nthat whoever was waiting outside would assume he would be back\r\nimmediately. At the same time, he lifted his thumb off the lighter's\r\ncontact.\r\n\r\nThen he sat down on the edge of his bed and quickly pulled off his\r\nboots. Holding them both in his hands, he moved silently back to the\r\ndoor. When he reached it, he tossed both boots to the rear of the room.\r\nWhen they landed clatteringly, he stepped quietly through the door. In\r\nthree steps he was on the opposite side of the corridor. He hugged the\r\nwall and moved back away from the spot where the watcher would be\r\nexpecting him.\r\n\r\nThen he waited.\r\n\r\nHe was on one side of the door to his stateroom, and the--what or\r\nwhoever it was--was on the other. Until that other made a move, Mike the\r\nAngel would wait.\r\n\r\nThe wait seemed many minutes long, although Mike knew it couldn't have\r\nbeen more than forty-five seconds or so. From other parts of the ship he\r\ncould hear voices shouting as the crewmen and officers who had been\r\nsleeping were awakened by the men on duty. The ship could not sustain\r\nlife long if the air conditioners were dead.\r\n\r\nThen, quite suddenly, the waiting was over. Behind Mike there was a bend\r\nin the corridor, and from around that bend came the sound of running\r\nfootsteps, followed by a bellowing voice: \"I'll get the Commander; you\r\ngo down and get the other boys started!\"\r\n\r\nMulthaus.\r\n\r\nAnd then there was a glow of light. The Chief Powerman's Mate was\r\ncarrying a light, which reflected from the walls of the corridor.\r\n\r\nAnd Mike the Angel knew perfectly well that he was silhouetted against\r\nthat glow. Whoever it was who was waiting for him could see him plainly.\r\n\r\nMulthaus' footsteps rang in the corridor while Mike strained his eyes to\r\nsee what was before him in the darkness. And all the time, the glow\r\nbecame brighter as Multhaus approached.\r\n\r\nThen, from out of the darkness, came something that moved on a whir of\r\ncaterpillar treads. Something hard and metallic slammed against Mike's\r\nshoulder, spinning him against the wall.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, Multhaus came around the corner, and Mike could see\r\nSnookums scurrying on down the corridor toward the approaching\r\nPowerman's Mate.\r\n\r\n\"Multhaus! Look out!\" Mike yelled.\r\n\r\nThe beam from the chief's hand torch gleamed on the metallic body of the\r\nlittle robot as it headed toward him.\r\n\r\n\"Snookums! Stop!\" Mike ordered.\r\n\r\nSnookums paid no attention. He swerved adroitly around the astonished\r\nMulthaus, spun around the corner, and was gone into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\"What was all that, sir?\" Multhaus asked, looking more than somewhat\r\nconfused.\r\n\r\n\"A course of instruction on the First and Second Laws of Robotics as\r\napplied by the Computer Corporation of Earth,\" said Mike, rubbing his\r\nbruised side. \"But never mind that now. What's wrong with the low-power\r\ncircuits?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, sir. Breckwell is on duty in that section.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's go,\" said Mike the Angel. \"We have to get this cleared up before\r\nwe all suffocate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Someone's going to get galloping claustrophobia before it's over,\r\nanyway,\" said Multhaus morosely as he followed Mike down the hallway in\r\nthe direction from which Snookums had come. \"Darkness and stuffy air\r\ntouch off that sort of thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's Officer of the Watch tonight?\" Mike wanted to know.\r\n\r\n\"Ensign Vaneski, I think. His name was on the roster, as I remember.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope he reported to the bridge. Commander Jeffers will be getting\r\nfrantic, but he can't leave the bridge unless he's relieved. Come on,\r\nlet's move.\"\r\n\r\nThey sprinted down the companionway.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe lights had been out less than five minutes when Mike the Angel and\r\nChief Powerman's Mate Multhaus reached the low-power center of the Power\r\nSection. The door was open, and a torch was spearing its beam on two\r\nmen--one kneeling over the prone figure of the other. The kneeling man\r\njerked his head around as Mike and the chief came in the door.\r\n\r\nThe kneeling man was Powerman First Class Fleck. Mike recognized the man\r\non the floor as Powerman Third Class Breckwell.\r\n\r\n\"What happened?\" he snapped at Fleck.\r\n\r\n\"Don't know, sir. I was in the head when the lights went. It took me a\r\nlittle time to get a torch and get in here, and I found Breckwell gone.\r\nAt least, I thought he was gone, but then I heard a noise from the tool\r\ncabinet and I opened it and he fell out.\" The words seemed to come out\r\nall in a rush.\r\n\r\n\"Dead?\" asked Mike sharply.\r\n\r\n\"Nossir, I don't think so, sir. Looks like somebody clonked him on the\r\nhead, but he's breathin' all right.\"\r\n\r\nMike knelt over the man and took his pulse. The heartbeat was regular\r\nand steady, if a trifle weak. Mike ran a hand over Breckwell's head.\r\n\r\n\"There's a knot there the size of a golf ball, but I don't think\r\nanything's broken,\" he said.\r\n\r\nFootsteps came running down the hall, and six men of the power crew came\r\npouring in the door. They slowed to a halt when they saw their\r\ncommanding officer was already there.\r\n\r\n\"A couple of you take care of Breckwell--Leister, Knox--move him to one\r\nside. Bathe his face with water. No, wait; you can't do that till we get\r\nthe pumps moving again. Just watch him.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the men coughed a little. \"What he needs is a good slug of\r\nhooch.\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree,\" said Mike evenly. \"Too bad there isn't any aboard. But do\r\nwhat you think is best; I'm going to be too busy to keep an eye on you.\r\nI won't be able to watch you at all, so you'll be on your own.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yessir,\" said the man who had spoken. He hid his grin and took out at a\r\nrun, heading for wherever it was he kept his bottle hidden.\r\n\r\n\"Dunstan, you and Ghihara get out and watch the halls. If any other\r\nofficer comes this way, sing out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yessir!\" came the twin chorus.\r\n\r\nMore footsteps pounded toward them, and the remaining men of the power\r\ncrew arrived.\r\n\r\n\"All right, now let's take a look at these circuits,\" said Mike.\r\n\r\nChief Multhaus had already flipped open all the panels and was peering\r\ninside. The men lined the torches up on the desk in the corner, in order\r\nto shed as much light as possible over the banks of low-power wiring,\r\nand went over to where Multhaus and Mike the Angel were standing.\r\n\r\n\"Dig out three replacement switches--heavy-duty six-double-oh-B-nines,\"\r\nsaid Multhaus. There was a touch of disgust and a good-sized serving of\r\nanger and irritation in his voice.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel surveyed the damage. \"See anything else, Multhaus?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. That's it.\"\r\n\r\nMike nodded. \"About five minutes' work to get the main switch going,\r\nwhich will give us power, and another ten minutes for the first and\r\nsecond stand-bys. Go ahead and take over, Multhaus; you won't need me.\r\nI'll go find out what the bloody unprintable is going on around here.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMike the Angel ran into Captain Sir Henry Quill as he went up the\r\ncompanionway to the bridge.\r\n\r\n\"What happened?\" demanded the captain in his gravelly tenor voice.\r\n\r\n\"Somebody ripped out the main switches to the low-power taps from the\r\nmain generators, sir,\" said Mike. \"Nothing to worry about. The boys will\r\nhave the lights on within three or four minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who...?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Mike, \"but we'd better find out pretty fast.\r\nThere've been too many things going on aboard this ship to suit me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Same here. Are you sure everything's all right down there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely, sir. We can quit worrying about the damage itself and put\r\nour minds to finding out who did that damage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you have any ideas?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some,\" said Mike the Angel. \"As soon as the intercom is functioning\r\nagain, I think you'd better call a general meeting of officers--and get\r\nMiss Crannon and Fitzhugh out of bed and get them up here, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" Black Bart asked flatly.\r\n\r\n\"Because Snookums has gone off his rocker. He's attacked at least one\r\nhuman being that I know of and has ignored direct orders from a human\r\nbeing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who?\" asked Black Bart.\r\n\r\n\"Me,\" said Mike the Angel.\r\n\r\nMike told Captain Quill what had happened as they made their way back up\r\nto the bridge.\r\n\r\nEnsign Vaneski, looking pale and worried, met them at the door. He\r\nsnapped a salute. \"I just reported to Commander Jeffers, sir.\r\nSomething's wrong with the low-power circuits.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had surmised as much,\" said Black Bart caustically. \"Anything new?\r\nWhat did you find out? What happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"When the lights went out, I was having coffee by myself in the\r\nwardroom. I grabbed a torch and headed for Power Section as soon as I\r\ncould. The low-power room was empty. There should have been a man on\r\nduty there, but there wasn't. I didn't want to go inside, since I'm not\r\na power officer, so I came up here to report. I--\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment the lights blazed on again. There was a faint hum that\r\nbuilt up all over the ship as the air conditioning came on at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\"All right, Mister Vaneski,\" said Black Bart, \"get below and take care\r\nof things. There's a man hurt down there, so be ready to take him to\r\nsick bay when the Physician's Mate gets there. We don't have a medic in\r\nany condition to take care of people, so he'll have to do. Hop it.\"\r\n\r\nAs Vaneski left, Black Bart preceded Mike into the bridge. Pete Jeffers\r\nwas on the intercom. As Mike and the captain came in, he was saying,\r\n\"All right. I'll notify the Officer of the Watch, and we'll search the\r\nship. He can't hide very long.\" Then, without waiting to say anything to\r\nMike or Quill, he jabbed at another button. \"Mister von Liegnitz! Jake!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Ja?_ Huh? What is it?\" came a fuzzy voice from the speaker.\r\n\r\n\"You all right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Me? Sure. I was asleep. Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Be on your toes, sleepyhead; just got word that Mellon has escaped from\r\nhis stateroom. He may try to take another crack at you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll watch it,\" said von Liegnitz, his voice crisp now.\r\n\r\n\"Okay.\" Jeffers sighed and looked up. \"As soon as the power came on,\r\nthe Physician's Mate was on the intercom. Mellon isn't in his\r\nstateroom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, wonderful!\" growled Captain Quill. \"We now have one insane robot\r\nand one insane human running loose on this ship. I'm glad we didn't\r\nbring any gorillas with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Somehow I think I'd be safer with a gorilla,\" said Mike the Angel.\r\n\r\n\"According to the Physician's Mate, Mellon is worse than just nuts,\"\r\nsaid Jeffers quietly. \"He says he loaded Mellon full of dope to make him\r\nsleep and that the man's got no right to be walkin' around at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"He must have gotten out while the doors were open,\" said Captain Quill.\r\nHe rubbed the palm of his hand over the shiny pinkness of his scalp. His\r\ndark, shaggy brows were down over his eyes, as though they had been\r\nweighted with lead.\r\n\r\n\"Mister Jeffers,\" he said abruptly, \"break out the stun guns. Issue one\r\nto each officer and one to each chief non-com. Until we get this\r\nstraightened out, I'm declaring a state of emergency.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16\r\n\r\n\r\nMike the Angel hefted the heavy stun gun in his right fist, feeling its\r\nweight without really noticing it. He knew damned good and well it\r\nwouldn't be of any use against Snookums. If Mellon came at him, the\r\nsupersonic beam from the gun would affect his nerves the same way an\r\nelectric current would, and he'd collapse, unconscious but relatively\r\nunharmed. But Mike doubted seriously that it would have any effect at\r\nall on the metal body of the robot. It is as difficult to jolt the\r\nnerves of a robot as it is to blind an oyster.\r\n\r\nSnookums did have sensory devices that enabled him to tell what was\r\ngoing on around him, but they were not nerves in the ordinary sense of\r\nthe word, and a stun gun certainly wouldn't have the same effect.\r\n\r\nHe wondered just what effect it _would_ have--if any.\r\n\r\nHe was going down the main ladder--actually a long spiral stairway that\r\nled downward from the bridge. Behind him were Chief Multhaus, also armed\r\nwith a stun gun, and four members of the power crew, each armed with a\r\nheavy spanner. Mike or the chief could take care of Mellon; it would be\r\nthe crew's job to take care of Snookums.\r\n\r\n\"Smash his treads and his waldoes,\" Mike had told them, \"but only if he\r\nattacks. Before you try anything else, give him an order to halt. If he\r\nkeeps on coming, start swinging.\" And, to Chief Multhaus: \"If Mellon\r\njumps me, fire that stun gun only if he's armed with a knife or a gun.\r\nBut if you do have to fire at Mellon, don't wait to get in a good shot;\r\njust go ahead and knock us both out. I'd rather be asleep than dead.\r\nOkay?\"\r\n\r\nMulthaus had agreed. \"The same goes for me, Commander. And the rest of\r\nthe boys.\"\r\n\r\nSo down the ladder they went. Mike hoped there'd be no fighting at all.\r\nHe had the feeling that everything was all wrong, somehow, and that any\r\nuse of stun guns or spanners would just make everything worse.\r\n\r\nHis wasn't the only group looking for Snookums and Mellon. Lieutenant\r\nKeku had another group, and Commander Jeffers had a third. Lieutenant\r\nCommander von Liegnitz was with Captain Quill on the bridge. Mellon had\r\nalready attacked von Liegnitz once; the captain didn't want them mixing\r\nit up again.\r\n\r\nCaptain Quill's voice came suddenly from a speaker in the overhead.\r\n\"Miss Crannon and Dr. Fitzhugh have just spoken to me,\" he said in his\r\nbrisk tenor. \"Snookums is safe in his own room. I have outlined what has\r\nhappened, and they're trying to get information from Snookums now.\r\nLieutenant Mellon is still missing.\"\r\n\r\n\"One down,\" said Chief Multhaus. There was relief in his voice.\r\n\r\n\"Let's see if we can find the other one,\" said Mike the Angel.\r\n\r\nThey went down perhaps three more steps, and the speakers came to life\r\nagain. \"Will the Chief Physician's Mate report to Commander Jeffers in\r\nthe maintenance tool room? Lieutenant Keku, dismiss your men to quarters\r\nand report to the bridge. Commander Gabriel, dismiss your men to\r\nquarters and report to Commander Jeffers in maintenance. All chief\r\nnon-coms report to the ordnance room to turn in your weapons. All\r\nenlisted men return to your posts or to quarters.\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel holstered his stun gun. \"That's two down,\" he said to\r\nChief Multhaus.\r\n\r\n\"Looks like we missed all the fun,\" said Multhaus.\r\n\r\n\"Okay, men,\" Mike said, \"you got the word. Take those spanners back to\r\nthe tool room in Power Section, and then get back to your quarters.\r\nChief, you go with them and secure everything, then take that stun gun\r\nback to ordnance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yessir.\"\r\n\r\nMulthaus threw Mike a salute; Mike returned it and headed toward\r\nmaintenance. He knew Multhaus and the others were curious, but he was\r\njust as curious himself. He had the advantage of being in a position to\r\nsatisfy his curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe maintenance tool room was big and lined with tool lockers. One of\r\nthem was open. Sprawled in front of it was Lieutenant Mellon. Over to\r\none side was Commander Jeffers, standing next to a white-faced Ensign\r\nVaneski. Nearby were a chief non-com and three enlisted men.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, Mike,\" Pete Jeffers said as Mike the Angel came in.\r\n\r\n\"What happened, Pete?\" Mike asked.\r\n\r\nJeffers gestured at the sprawled figure on the floor. \"We came in here\r\nto search. We found him. Mister Vaneski opened the locker, there, for a\r\nlook-see, and Mellon jumped out at him. Vaneski fired his stun gun.\r\nMellon collapsed to the deck. He's in bad shape; his pulse is so weak\r\nthat it's hard to find.\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel walked over and looked down at the fallen Medical\r\nOfficer. His face was waxen, and he looked utterly small and harmless.\r\n\r\n\"What happened?\" asked another voice from the door. It was Chief\r\nPhysician's Mate Pierre Pasteur. He was a smallish man, well rounded,\r\npleasant-faced, and inordinately proud of his name. He couldn't actually\r\nprove that he was really descended from the great Louis, but he didn't\r\nallow people to think otherwise. Like most C. Phys. M.'s, he had a\r\ndoctor of medicine degree but no internship in the Space Service. He was\r\nworking toward his commission.\r\n\r\n\"We've got a patient for you,\" said Jeffers. \"Better look him over,\r\nChief.\"\r\n\r\nChief Pasteur walked over to where Mellon lay and took his stethoscope\r\nout of his little black bag. He listened to Mellon's chest for a few\r\nseconds. Then he pried open an eyelid and looked closely at an eye.\r\n\"What happened to him?\" he asked, without looking up.\r\n\r\n\"Got hit with a beam from a stun gun,\" said Jeffers.\r\n\r\n\"How did he fall? Did he hit his head?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know--maybe.\" He looked at Ensign Vaneski. \"Did he, Mister\r\nVaneski? He was right on top of you; I was across the room.\"\r\n\r\nVaneski swallowed. \"I don't know. He--he just sort of--well, he _fell_.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't catch him?\" asked the chief. He was a physician on a case\r\nnow and had no time for sirring his superiors.\r\n\r\n\"No. No. I jumped away from him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? What's the trouble?\" Jeffers asked.\r\n\r\n\"He's dead,\" said the Chief Physician's Mate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17\r\n\r\n\r\nLeda Crannon was standing outside the cubicle that had been built for\r\nSnookums. Her back and the palms of her hands were pressed against the\r\ndoor. Her head was bowed, and her red hair, shining like a hellish flame\r\nin the light of the glow panels, fell around her shoulders and cheeks,\r\nalmost covering her face.\r\n\r\n\"Leda,\" said Mike the Angel gently.\r\n\r\nShe looked up. There were tears in her blue eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Mike! Oh, Mike!\" She ran toward him, put her arms around him, and tried\r\nto bury her face in Mike's chest.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, honey? What's happened?\" He was certain she couldn't\r\nhave heard about Mellon's death yet. He held her in his arms, carefully,\r\ntenderly, not passionately.\r\n\r\n\"He's crazy, Mike. He's completely crazy.\" Her voice had suddenly lost\r\neverything that gave it color. It was only dead and choked.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel knew it was an emotional reaction. As a psychologist, she\r\nwould never have used the word \"crazy.\" But as a woman ... as a human\r\nbeing....\r\n\r\n\"Fitz is still in there talking to him, but he's--he's--\" Her voice\r\nchoked off again into sobs.\r\n\r\nMike waited patiently, holding her, caressing her hair.\r\n\r\n\"Eight years,\" she said after a minute or so. \"Eight years I spent. And\r\nnow he's gone. He's broken.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know?\" Mike asked.\r\n\r\nShe lifted her head and looked at him. \"Mike--did he really hit you? Did\r\nhe refuse to stop when you ordered him to? What _really_ happened?\"\r\n\r\nMike told her what had happened in the darkened companionway just\r\noutside his room.\r\n\r\nWhen he finished, she began sobbing again. \"He's lying, Mike,\" she said.\r\n\"_Lying!_\"\r\n\r\nMike nodded silently and slowly. Leda Crannon had spent all of her adult\r\nlife tending the hurts and bruises and aches of Snookums the Child. She\r\nhad educated him, cared for him, taken pleasure in his triumphs, worried\r\nabout his health, and watched him grow mentally.\r\n\r\nAnd now he was sick, broken, ruined. And, like all parents, she was\r\nasking herself: \"What did I do wrong?\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel didn't give her an answer to that unspoken question, but\r\nhe knew what the answer was in so many cases:\r\n\r\nThe grieving parent has not necessarily done anything wrong. It may\r\nsimply be that there was insufficient or poor-quality material to work\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nWith a human child, it is even more humiliating for a parent to admit\r\nthat he or she has contributed inferior genetic material to a child than\r\nit is to admit a failure in upbringing. Leda's case was different.\r\n\r\nLeda had lost her child, but Mike hesitated to point out that it wasn't\r\nher fault in the first place because the material wasn't up to the task\r\nshe had given it, and in the second place because she hadn't really\r\nlost anything. She was still playing with dolls, not human beings.\r\n\r\n\"Hell!\" said Mike under his breath, not realizing that he was\r\npractically whispering in her ear.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it?\" she said. \"Isn't it Hell? I spent eight years trying to make\r\nthat little mind of his tick properly. I wanted to know what was the\r\nright, proper, and logical way to bring up children. I had a theory, and\r\nI wanted to test it. And now I'll never know.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort of theory?\" Mike asked.\r\n\r\nShe sniffled, took a handkerchief from her pocket, and began wiping at\r\nher tears. Mike took the handkerchief away from her and did the wiping\r\njob himself. \"What's this theory?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it isn't important now. But I felt--I still feel--that everybody is\r\nborn with a sort of Three Laws of Robotics in him. You know what I\r\nmean--that a person wouldn't kill or harm anyone, or refuse to do what\r\nwas right, in addition to trying to preserve his own life. I think\r\nbabies are born that way. But I think that the information they're given\r\nwhen they're growing up can warp them. They still think they're obeying\r\nthe laws, but they're obeying them wrongly, if you see what I mean.\"\r\n\r\nMike nodded without saying anything. This was no time to interrupt her.\r\n\r\n\"For instance,\" she went on, \"if my theory's right, then a child would\r\nnever disobey his father--unless he was convinced that the man was not\r\nreally his father, you see. For instance, if he learned, very early,\r\nthat his father never spanks him, that becomes one of the identifying\r\nmarks of 'father.' Fine. But the first time his father _does_ spank him,\r\ndoubt enters. If that sort of thing goes on, he becomes disobedient\r\nbecause he doesn't believe that the man is his father.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I'm putting it a little crudely, but you get the idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Mike. For all he knew, there might be some merit in the\r\ngirl's idea; he knew that philosophers had talked of the \"basic goodness\r\nof mankind\" for centuries. But he had a hunch that Leda was going about\r\nit wrong. Still, this was no time to argue with her. She seemed calmer\r\nnow, and he didn't want to upset her any more than he had to.\r\n\r\n\"That's what you've been working on with Snookums?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"That's it.\"\r\n\r\n\"For eight years?\"\r\n\r\n\"For eight years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that the information, the data, that makes Snookums so priceless,\r\naside from his nucleonics work?\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled a little then. \"Oh no. Of course not, silly. He's been fed\r\ndata on everything--physics, subphysics, chemistry, mathematics--all\r\nkinds of things. Most of the major research laboratories on Earth have\r\nproblems of one kind or another that Snookums has been working on. He\r\nhasn't been given the problem _I_ was working on at all; it would bias\r\nhim.\" Then the tears came back. \"And now it doesn't matter. He's insane.\r\nHe's lying.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's he saying?\"\r\n\r\n\"He insists that he's never broken the First Law, that he has never hurt\r\na human being. And he insists that he has followed the orders of human\r\nbeings, according to the Second Law.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I talk to him?\" Mike asked.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \"Fitz is running him through an analysis. He even\r\nmade me leave.\" Then she looked at his face more closely. \"You don't\r\njust want to confront him and call him a liar, do you? No--that's not\r\nlike you. You know he's just a machine--better than I do, I guess....\r\nWhat is it, Mike?\"\r\n\r\n_No_, he thought, looking at her, _she still thinks he's human.\r\nOtherwise, she'd know that a computer can't lie--not in the human sense\r\nof the word._\r\n\r\n_Most people, if told that a man had said one thing, and that a computer\r\nhad given a different answer, would rely on the computer._\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Mike?\" she repeated.\r\n\r\n\"Lew Mellon,\" he said very quietly, \"is dead.\"\r\n\r\nThe blood drained from her face, leaving her skin stark against the\r\nbright red of her hair. For a moment he thought she was going to faint.\r\nThen a little of the color came back.\r\n\r\n\"Snookums.\" Her voice was whispery.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. \"No. Apparently he tried to jump Vaneski and got hit\r\nwith a stun beam. It shouldn't have killed him--but apparently it did.\"\r\n\r\n\"God, God, God,\" she said softly. \"Here I've been crying about a damned\r\nmachine, and poor Lew has been lying up there dead.\" She buried her face\r\nin her hands, and her voice was muffled when she spoke again. \"And I'm\r\nall cried out, Mike. I can't cry any more.\"\r\n\r\nBefore Mike could make up his mind whether to say anything or not, the\r\ndoor of Snookums' room opened and Dr. Fitzhugh came out, closing the\r\ndoor behind him. There was an odd, stricken look on his face. He looked\r\nat Leda and then at Mike, but the expression on his face showed that he\r\nreally hadn't seen them clearly.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever wonder if a robot had a soul, Mike?\" he asked in a\r\nwondering tone.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Mike admitted.\r\n\r\nLeda took her hands from her face and looked at him. Her expression was\r\na bright blank stare.\r\n\r\n\"He won't answer my questions,\" Fitzhugh said in a hushed tone. \"I can't\r\ncomplete the analysis.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that got to do with his soul?\" Mike asked.\r\n\r\n\"He won't answer my questions,\" Fitzhugh repeated, looking earnestly at\r\nMike. \"He says God won't allow him to.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Sir Henry Quill opened the door of the late Lieutenant Mellon's\r\nquarters and went in, followed by Mike the Angel. The dead man's gear\r\nhad to be packed away so that it could be given to his nearest of kin\r\nwhen the officers and crew of the _Brainchild_ returned to Earth.\r\nRegulations provided that two officers must inventory his personal\r\neffects and those belonging to the Space Service.\r\n\r\n\"Does Chief Pasteur know what killed him yet, Captain?\" Mike asked.\r\n\r\nQuill shook his head. \"No. He wants my permission to perform an\r\nautopsy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to let him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think not. We'll put the body in the freezer and have the autopsy\r\nperformed on Earth.\" He looked around the room, seeing it for the first\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\"If you don't,\" said Mike, \"you've got three suspected killers on your\r\nhands.\"\r\n\r\nQuill was unperturbed. \"Don't be ridiculous, Golden Wings.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not,\" Mike said. \"I hit him in the pit of his stomach. Chief\r\nPasteur filled him full of sedative. Mister Vaneski shot him with a\r\nstun beam. He died. Which one of us did it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably no single one of them, but a combination of all three,\" said\r\nCaptain Quill. \"Each action was performed in the line of duty and\r\nwithout malice aforethought--without even intent to harm permanently,\r\nmuch less to kill. There will have to be a court-martial, of course--or,\r\nat the very least, a board of inquiry will be appointed. But I am\r\ncertain you'll all come through any such inquiry scatheless.\" He picked\r\nup a book from Mellon's desk. \"Let's get about our business, Mister\r\nGabriel. Mark down: Bible, one.\"\r\n\r\nMike put it down on the list.\r\n\r\n\"_International Encyclopedia_, English edition. Thirty volumes and\r\nindex.\"\r\n\r\nMike put it down.\r\n\r\n\"_The Oxford-Webster Dictionary of the English Language_--\r\n\r\n\"_Hallbert's Dictionary of Medical Terms_--\r\n\r\n\"_The Canterbury Theological Dictionary_--\r\n\r\n\"_The Christian Religion and Symbolic Logic_, by Bishop K. F. Costin--\r\n\r\n\"_The Handbook of Space Medicine_--\"\r\n\r\nAs Captain Quill called out the names of the books and put them into the\r\npacking case he'd brought, Mike marked them down--while something began\r\nticking in the back of his mind.\r\n\r\n\"Item,\" said Captain Quill, \"one crucifix.\" He paused. \"Beautifully\r\ncarved, too.\" He put it into the packing case.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, Captain,\" said Mike suddenly. \"Let me take a look at\r\nsomething, will you?\" Excitedly, he leaned over and took some of the\r\nbooks out, looking at the pages of each one.\r\n\r\n\"I'll be damned,\" he said after a moment. \"Or I _should_ be--for being\r\nsuch a stupid idiot!\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Quill narrowed his eyes. \"What are you talking about, Mister\r\nGabriel?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sure yet, Captain,\" Mike hedged. \"May I borrow these three\r\nbooks?\" He held them up in his hands.\r\n\r\n\"May I be so bold as to ask _why_, Mister Gabriel?\"\r\n\r\n\"I just want to look at them, sir,\" Mike said. \"I'll return them within\r\na few hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mister Gabriel,\" Captain Quill said, \"after what happened last night, I\r\nam suspicious of everything that goes on aboard this ship. But--yes. You\r\nmay take them. However, I want them returned before we land tomorrow\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\nMike blinked. Neither he nor anyone else--with the exception of Captain\r\nQuill and Lieutenant Commander von Liegnitz, the navigator, knew the\r\ndestination of the ship. Mike hadn't realized they were that close to\r\ntheir goal. \"I'll have them back by then,\" he promised.\r\n\r\n\"Very well. Now let's get on about our work.\"\r\n\r\nThe job was completed within forty-five minutes. A man can't carry a\r\ngreat deal with him on a spaceship. When they were through, Mike the\r\nAngel excused himself and went to his quarters. Two hours after that he\r\nwent to the officers' wardroom to look up Pete Jeffers. Pete hadn't been\r\nin his quarters, and Mike knew he wasn't on duty by that time. Sure\r\nenough, Jeffers was drinking coffee all by himself in the wardroom. He\r\nlooked up when Mike came in.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, Mike,\" he said listlessly. \"Come sit. Have some coffee.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a faint aroma in the air which indicated that there was more\r\nin the cup than just coffee. \"No, thanks, Pete. I'll sit this one out. I\r\nwanted to talk to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sit. I am drinking a toast to Mister Lew Mellon.\" He pointed at the\r\ncoffee. \"Sure you won't have a mite? It's sweetened from the grape.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, thanks again.\" Mike sat down. \"It's Mellon I wanted to talk about.\r\nDid you know him well, Pete?\"\r\n\r\n\"Purty well,\" Pete said, nodding. \"Yeah, purty well. I always figured\r\nhim for a great little bloke. Can't figure what got into him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me either. Pete, you told me he was an Anglo-Catholic--a good one, you\r\nsaid.\"\r\n\r\n\"'At's right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, how did you mean that?\"\r\n\r\nPete frowned. \"Just what I said. He studied his religion, he went to\r\nMass regularly, said his prayers--that sort of thing. And he was, I will\r\nsay, a Christian gentleman in every sense of the word.\" There was\r\nirritation in his voice, as though Mike had impugned the memory of a\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n\"Don't get huffy, Pete; he struck me as a pretty nice person, too--\"\r\n\r\n\"Until he flipped his lid,\" said Pete. \"But that might happen to\r\nanybody.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. But what I want to know--and don't get sore--is, did he show any\r\nkind of--well, _instability_ before this last outbreak?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like what?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean, was he a religious nut? Did he act 'holier than thou' or--well,\r\nwas he a fanatic, would you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I wouldn't say so. He didn't talk much about it. I guess you\r\nnoticed that. I mean, he didn't preach. He smoked some and had his glass\r\nof wine now and then--even had a cocktail or two on occasion. His views\r\non sex were orthodox, I reckon--I mean, as far as I know. He'd tell an\r\noff-color story, if it wasn't _too_ bad. But he'd get up and leave\r\nquietly if the boys started tellin' about the women they'd made.\r\nFornication and adultery just weren't his meat, I'd say.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know he wasn't married,\" Mike said. \"Did he date much?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some. He liked to dance. Women seemed to like him.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about men?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most of the boys liked him.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's not what I meant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh. Was he queer?\" Pete frowned. \"I'd damn near stake my life that he\r\nwasn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean he didn't practice it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe he even thought about it,\" Pete said. \"Course, you\r\ncan't tell what's really goin' on in a man's mind, but--\" His frown\r\nbecame a scowl. \"Damn it, Mike, just because a man isn't married by the\r\ntime he's thirty-five and practices Christian chastity while he's single\r\ndon't necessarily mean he's a damn fairy!\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't say it did. I just wondered if you'd heard anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"No more'n I've heard about you--who are in exactly the same position!\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" Mike agreed. \"That's what I wanted to know. Pete, if you've\r\ngot it to spare, I'll join you in that toast.\"\r\n\r\nPete Jeffers grinned. \"Comin' right up, buddy-boy.\"\r\n\r\nHe poured two more cups of coffee, spiked them from a small flask of\r\nbrandy, and handed one to Mike. They drank in silence.\r\n\r\nFifteen minutes later, Mike the Angel was in the little office that\r\nLeda Crannon shared with Dr. Fitzhugh. She was alone.\r\n\r\n\"How's the girl today?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Beat,\" she said with a forced smile.\r\n\r\n\"You look beautiful,\" he said. He wasn't lying. She looked drawn and\r\ntired, but she still looked beautiful.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Mike. What can I do for you?\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel pulled up a chair and sat down. \"Where's Doc Fitz?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's still trying to get information out of Snookums. It's a weird\r\nthing, Mike--a robot with a soul.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mind talking about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; go ahead if you want.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, answer me a question,\" he said. \"Can Snookums read English?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. And Russian, and German, French, Chinese, and most of the\r\nother major languages of Earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"He could read a book, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. But not unless it was given to him and he was specifically told to\r\nuse its contents as data.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" said Mike. \"Now, suppose Snookums was given complete data on a\r\ncertain field of knowledge. Suppose further that this field is\r\ninternally completely logical, completely coherent, completely\r\nself-consistent. Suppose it could even be reduced to a series of axioms\r\nand theorems in symbolic logic.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" she said. \"So?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, further suppose that this system, this field of knowledge is,\r\nright now, in constant use by millions of human beings, even though most\r\nof them are unaware of the implications of the entire field. Could\r\nSnookums work with such a body of knowledge?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" said Leda. \"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"What if there was absolutely no way for Snookums to experiment with\r\nthis knowledge? What if he simply did not have the equipment necessary?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean,\" she asked, \"something like astrophysics?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. That's exactly what I don't mean. I'm perfectly well aware that it\r\nisn't possible to test astrophysical theories directly. Nobody has been\r\nable to build a star in the lab so far.\r\n\r\n\"But it _is_ possible to test the theories of astrophysics analogically\r\nby extrapolating on data that _can_ be tested in a physics lab.\r\n\r\n\"What I'm talking about is a system that Snookums, simply because he is\r\nwhat he is, cannot test or experiment upon, in any way whatsoever. A\r\nsystem that has, in short, no connection with the physical world\r\nwhatsoever.\"\r\n\r\nLeda Crannon thought it over. \"Well, assuming all that, I imagine that\r\nit would eventually ruin Snookums. He's built to experiment, and if he's\r\nkept from experimenting for too long, he'll exceed the optimum randomity\r\nof his circuits.\" She swallowed. \"If he hasn't already.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought so. And so did someone else,\" said Mike thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Well, for Heaven's sake! What is this system?\" Leda asked in sudden\r\nexasperation.\r\n\r\n\"You're close,\" said Mike the Angel.\r\n\r\n\"What are you talking about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Theology,\" said Mike. \"He was pumped full of Christian theology, that's\r\nall. Good, solid, Catholic theology. Bishop Costin's mathematical\r\nsymbolization of it is simply a result of the verbal logic that had been\r\nsmoothed out during the previous two thousand years. Snookums could\r\nreduce it to math symbols and equations, anyway, even if we didn't have\r\nBishop Costin's work.\"\r\n\r\nHe showed her the book from Mellon's room.\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't even require the assumption of a soul to make it foul up a\r\nrobot's works. He doesn't have any emotions, either. And he can't handle\r\nsomething that he can't experiment with. It would have driven him\r\ninsane, all right. But he _isn't_ insane.\"\r\n\r\nLeda looked puzzled. \"But--\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know why?\" Mike interrupted.\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he found something that he could experiment with. He found a\r\nmaterial basis for theological experimentation.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked still more puzzled. \"What could that be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Me,\" said Mike the Angel. \"Me. Michael Raphael Gabriel. I'm an\r\nangel--an archangel. As a matter of fact, I'm _three_ archangels. For\r\nall I know, Snookums has equated me with the Trinity.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--how did he get that idea?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mostly from the Book of Tobit,\" said Mike. \"That's where an archangel\r\ntakes the form of a human being and travels around with Tobit the\r\nYounger, remember? And, too, he probably got more information from the\r\nfirst part of Luke's Gospel, where Gabriel tells the Blessed Virgin that\r\nshe's about to become a mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"But would he have figured that out for himself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly,\" said Mike, \"but I doubt it. He was told that I was an\r\nangel--literally.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me see that book,\" she said, taking _The Christian Religion and\r\nSymbolic Logic_ from Mike's hand. She opened it to the center. \"I\r\ndidn't know anyone had done this sort of work,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there was a great fuss over the book when it came out. There were\r\nthose who said that the millennium had arrived because the truth of the\r\nChristian faith had been proved mathematically, and therefore all\r\nrational people would have to accept it.\"\r\n\r\nShe leafed through the book. \"I'll bet there are still some who still\r\nbelieve that, just like there are some people who still think Euclidian\r\ngeometry must necessarily be true because it can be 'proved'\r\nmathematically.\"\r\n\r\nMike nodded. \"All Bishop Costin did--all he was _trying_ to do--was to\r\nprove that the axioms of the Christian faith are logically\r\nself-consistent. That's all he ever claimed to have done, and he did a\r\nbrilliant job of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--how do you know this is what Snookums was given?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look at the pages. Snookums' waldo fingers wrinkled the pages that way.\r\nThose aren't the marks of human fingers. Only two of Mellon's other\r\nbooks were wrinkled that way.\"\r\n\r\nShe jerked her head up from the book, startled. \"_What?_ This is Lew\r\nMellon's book?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right. So are the other two. A Bible and a theological\r\ndictionary. They're wrinkled the same way.\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes were wide, bright sapphires. \"But _why_? Why would he do such a\r\nthing, for goodness' sake?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know why it was done,\" Mike said slowly, \"but I doubt if it was\r\nfor goodness' sake. We haven't gotten to the bottom of this hanky-panky\r\nyet, I don't think.\r\n\r\n\"Leda, if I'm right--if this _is_ what has been causing Snookums' odd\r\nbehavior--can you cure him?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at the book again and nodded. \"I think so. But it will take a\r\nlot of work. I'll have to talk to Fitz about it. We'll have to keep this\r\nbook--and the other two.\"\r\n\r\nMike shook his head. \"No can do. Can you photocopy them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. But it'll take--oh, two or three hours per book.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you'd better get busy. We're landing in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded. \"I know. Captain Quill has already told us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine, then.\" He stood up. \"What will you do? Simply tell Snookums to\r\nforget all this stuff?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Heavens no! It's too thoroughly integrated with every other bit of\r\ndata he has! You might be able to take one single bit of data out that\r\nway, but to jerk out a whole body of knowledge like this would\r\ncompletely randomize his circuits. You can pull out a tooth by yanking\r\nwith a pair of forceps, but if you try to take out a man's appendix that\r\nway, you'll lose a patient.\"\r\n\r\n\"I catch,\" Mike said with a grin. \"Okay. I'll get the other two books\r\nand you can get to work copying them. Take care.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Mike.\"\r\n\r\nAs he walked down the companionway, he cursed himself for being a fool.\r\nIf he'd let things go on the way they were, Leda might have weaned\r\nherself away from Snookums. Now she was interested again. But there\r\ncould have been no other way, of course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19\r\n\r\n\r\nThe interstellar ship _Brainchild_ orbited around her destination,\r\nwaiting during the final checkup before she landed on the planet below.\r\n\r\nIt was not a nice planet. As far as its size went, it could be\r\nclassified as \"Earth type,\" but size was almost the only resemblance to\r\nEarth. It orbited in space some five hundred and fifty million miles\r\nfrom its Sol-like parent--a little farther away from the primary than\r\nJupiter is from Sol itself. It was cold there--terribly cold. At high\r\nnoon on the equator, the temperature reached a sweltering 180° absolute;\r\nit became somewhat chillier toward the poles.\r\n\r\nH_{2}O was, anywhere on the planet, a whitish, crystalline mineral\r\nsuitable for building material. The atmosphere was similar to that of\r\nJupiter, although the proportions of methane, ammonia, and hydrogen were\r\ndifferent because of the lower gravitational potential of the planet. It\r\nhad managed to retain a great deal more hydrogen in its atmosphere than\r\nEarth had because of the fact that the average thermal velocity of the\r\nmolecules was much lower. Since oxygen-releasing life had never\r\ndeveloped on the frigid surface of the planet, there was no oxygen in\r\nthe atmosphere. It was all tied up in combination with the hydrogen of\r\nthe ice and the surface rocks of the planet.\r\n\r\nThe Space Service ship that had discovered the planet, fifteen years\r\nbefore, had given it the name Eisberg, thus commemorating the name of a\r\nspaceman second class who happened to have the luck to be (a) named\r\nRobert Eisberg, (b) a member of the crew of the ship to discover the\r\nplanet, and (c) under the command of a fun-loving captain.\r\n\r\nEisberg had been picked as the planet to transfer the potentially\r\ndangerous Snookums to for two reasons. In the first place, if Snookums\r\nactually did solve the problem of the total-annihilation bomb, the worst\r\nhe could do was destroy a planet that wasn't much good, anyway. And, in\r\nthe second place, the same energy requirements applied on Eisberg as did\r\non Chilblains Base. It was easier to cool the helium bath of the brain\r\nif it only had to be lowered 175 degrees or so.\r\n\r\nIt was a great place for cold-work labs, but not worth anything for\r\ncolonization.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChief Powerman's Mate Multhaus looked gloomily at the figures on the\r\nlanding sheet.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel watched the expression on the chief's face and said:\r\n\"What's the matter, Multhaus? No like?\"\r\n\r\nMulthaus grimaced. \"Well, sir, I don't like it, no. But I can't say I\r\n_dis_like it, either.\"\r\n\r\nHe stared at the landing sheet, pursing his lips. He looked as though he\r\nwere valiantly restraining himself from asking questions about the other\r\nnight's escapade--which he was.\r\n\r\nHe said: \"I just don't like to land without jets, sir; that's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hell, neither do I,\" admitted Mike. \"But we're not going to get down\r\nany other way. We managed to take off without jets; we'll manage to land\r\nwithout them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yessir,\" said Multhaus, \"but we took off _with_ the grain of Earth's\r\nmagnetic field. We're landing _across_ the grain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" said Mike. \"So what? If we overlook the motors, that's okay. We\r\nmay never be able to get off the planet with this ship again, but we\r\naren't supposed to anyway.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Multhaus, don't worry about it. I know you hate to burn up a\r\nship, but this one is supposed to be expendable. You may never have\r\nanother chance like this.\"\r\n\r\nMulthaus tried to keep from grinning, but he couldn't. \"Awright,\r\nCommander. You have appealed to my baser instincts. My subconscious\r\ndesire to wreck a spaceship has been brought to the surface. I can't\r\nresist it. Am I nutty, maybe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not now, you're not,\" Mike said, grinning back.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have a bitch of a job getting through the plasmasphere, though,\"\r\nsaid the chief. \"That fraction of a second will--\"\r\n\r\n\"It'll jolt us,\" Mike agreed, interrupting. \"But it won't wreck us.\r\nLet's get going.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, sir,\" said Multhaus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe seas of Eisberg were liquid methane containing dissolved ammonia.\r\nNear the equator, they were liquid; farther north, the seas became\r\nslushy with crystallized ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe site picked for the new labs of the Computer Corporation of Earth\r\nwas in the northern hemisphere, at 40° north latitude, about the same\r\ndistance from the equator as New York or Madrid, Spain, would be on\r\nEarth. The _Brainchild_ would be dropping through Eisberg's magnetic\r\nfield at an angle, but it wouldn't be the ninety-degree angle of the\r\nequator. It would have been nice if the base could have been built at\r\none of the poles, but that would have put the labs in an uncomfortable\r\nposition, since there was no solid land at either pole.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel didn't like the idea of having to land on Eisberg without\r\njets any more than Multhaus did, but he was almost certain that the ship\r\nwould take the strain.\r\n\r\nHe took the companionway up to the Control Bridge, went in, and handed\r\nthe landing sheet to Black Bart. The captain scowled at it, shrugged,\r\nand put it on his desk.\r\n\r\n\"Will we make it, sir?\" Mike said. \"Any word from the _Fireball_?\"\r\n\r\nBlack Bart nodded. \"She's orbiting outside the atmosphere. Captain\r\nWurster will send down a ship to pick us up as soon as we've finished\r\nour business here.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Fireball_, being much faster than the clumsy _Brainchild_, had left\r\nEarth later than the slower ship, and had arrived earlier.\r\n\r\n\"_Now hear this! Now hear this! Third Warning! Landing orbit begins in\r\none minute! Landing begins in one minute!_\"\r\n\r\nSixty seconds later the _Brainchild_ began her long, logarithmic drop\r\ntoward the surface of Eisberg.\r\n\r\nLanding a ship on her jets isn't an easy job, but at least an ion rocket\r\nis built for the job. Maybe someday the Translation drive will be\r\nmodified for planetary landings, but so far such a landing has been, as\r\nsomeone put it, \"50 per cent raw energy and 50 per cent prayer.\" The\r\nlanding was worse than the take-off, a truism which has held since the\r\nfirst glider took off from the surface of Earth in the nineteenth\r\ncentury. What goes up doesn't necessarily have to come down, but when it\r\ndoes, the job is a lot rougher than getting up was.\r\n\r\nThe plasmasphere of Eisberg differed from that of Earth in two ways.\r\nFirst, the ionizing source of radiation--the primary star--was farther\r\naway from Eisberg than Sol was from Earth, which tended to reduce the\r\ntotal ionization. Second, the upper atmosphere of Eisberg was pretty\r\nmuch pure hydrogen, which is somewhat easier to ionize than oxygen or\r\nnitrogen. And, since there was no ozonosphere to block out the UV\r\nradiation from the primary, the thickness of the ionosphere beneath the\r\nplasmasphere was greater.\r\n\r\nNot until the _Brainchild_ hit the bare fringes of the upper atmosphere\r\ndid she act any differently than she had in space.\r\n\r\nBut when she hit the outer fringes of the ionosphere--that upper layer\r\nof rarified protons, the rapidly moving current of high velocity ions\r\nknown as the plasmasphere--she bucked like a kicked horse. From deep\r\nwithin her vitals, the throb began, a strumming, thrumming sound with a\r\nsomewhat higher note imposed upon it, making a sound like that of a bass\r\nviol being plucked rapidly on its lowest string.\r\n\r\nIt was not the intensity of the ionosphere that cracked the drive of the\r\n_Brainchild_; it was the duration. The layer of ionization was too\r\nthick; the ship couldn't make it through the layer fast enough, in spite\r\nof her high velocity.\r\n\r\nA man can hold a red-hot bit of steel in his hand for a fraction of a\r\nsecond without even feeling it. But if he has to hold a hot baked potato\r\nfor thirty seconds, he's likely to get a bad burn.\r\n\r\nSo it was with the _Brainchild_. The passage through Earth's ionosphere\r\nduring take-off had been measured in fractions of a second. The\r\n_Brainchild_ had reacted, but the exposure to the field had been too\r\nshort to hurt her.\r\n\r\nThe ionosphere of Eisberg was much deeper and, although the intensity\r\nwas less, the duration was much longer.\r\n\r\nThe drumming increased as she fell, a low-frequency, high-energy sine\r\nwave that shook the ship more violently than had the out-of-phase beat\r\nthat had pummeled the ship shortly after her take-off.\r\n\r\nDr. Morris Fitzhugh, the roboticist, screamed imprecations into the\r\nintercom, but Captain Sir Henry Quill cut him off before anyone took\r\nnotice and let the scientist rave into a dead pickup.\r\n\r\n\"How's she coming?\"\r\n\r\nThe voice came over the intercom to the Power Section, and Mike the\r\nAngel knew that the question was meant for him.\r\n\r\n\"She'll make it, Captain,\" he said. \"She'll make it. I designed this\r\nthing for a 500 per cent overload. She'll make it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" said Black Bart, snapping off the intercom.\r\n\r\nMike exhaled gustily. His eyes were still on the needles that kept\r\ncreeping higher and higher along the calibrated periphery of the meters.\r\nMany of them had long since passed the red lines that marked the\r\nallowable overload point. Mike the Angel knew that those points had been\r\nset low, but he also knew that they were approaching the real overload\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nHe took another deep breath and held it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPoint for point, the continent of Antarctica, Earth, is one of the most\r\ndeadly areas ever found on a planet that is supposedly non-inimical to\r\nman. Earth is a nice, comfortable planet, most of the time, but\r\nAntarctica just doesn't cater to Man at all.\r\n\r\nStill, it just happens to be the _worst_ spot on the _best_ planet in\r\nthe known Galaxy.\r\n\r\nEisberg is different. At its best, it has the continent of Antarctica\r\nbeat four thousand ways from a week ago last Candlemas. At its worst, it\r\nis sudden death; at its best, it is somewhat less than sudden.\r\n\r\nNot that Eisberg is a really _mean_ planet; Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, or\r\nNeptune can kill a man faster and with less pain. No, Eisberg isn't\r\nmean--it's torturous. A man without clothes, placed suddenly on the\r\nsurface of Eisberg--_anywhere_ on the surface--would die. But the\r\ntrouble is that he'd live long enough for it to hurt.\r\n\r\nMan can survive, all right, but it takes equipment and intelligence to\r\ndo it.\r\n\r\nWhen the interstellar ship _Brainchild_ blew a tube--just one tube--of\r\nthe external field that fought the ship's mass against the space-strain\r\nof the planet's gravitational field, the ship went off orbit. The tube\r\nblew when she was some ninety miles above the surface. She dropped too\r\nfast, jerked up, dropped again.\r\n\r\nWhen the engines compensated for the lost tube, the descent was more\r\nleisurely, and the ship settled gently--well, not exactly _gently_--on\r\nthe surface of Eisberg.\r\n\r\nCaptain Quill's voice came over the intercom.\r\n\r\n\"We are nearly a hundred miles from the base, Mister Gabriel. Any\r\nexcuse?\"\r\n\r\n\"No excuse, sir,\" said Mike the Angel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you ignite a jet of oxygen-nitrogen in an atmosphere of\r\nhydrogen-methane, you get a flame that doesn't differ much from the\r\nflame from a hydrogen-methane jet in an oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere. A\r\nflame doesn't particularly care which way the electrons jump, just so\r\nlong as they jump.\r\n\r\nAll of which was due to give Mike the Angel more headaches than he\r\nalready had, which was 100 per cent too many.\r\n\r\nThree days after the _Brainchild_ landed, the scout group arrived from\r\nthe base that had been built on Eisberg to take care of Snookums. The\r\nleader, a heavy-set engineer named Treadmore, who had unkempt brownish\r\nhair and a sad look in his eyes, informed Captain Quill that there was a\r\ngreat deal of work to be done. And his countenance became even sadder.\r\n\r\nMike, who had, perforce, been called in to take part in the conference,\r\nlistened in silence while the engineer talked.\r\n\r\nThe officers' wardroom, of which Mike the Angel was becoming heartily\r\nsick, seemed like a tomb which echoed and re-echoed the lugubrious voice\r\nof Engineer Treadmore.\r\n\r\n\"We were warned, of course,\" he said, in a normally dismal tone, \"that\r\nit would be extremely difficult to set down the ship which carried\r\nSnookums, and that we could expect the final base to be anywhere from\r\nten to thirty miles from the original, temporary base.\" He looked round\r\nat everyone, giving the impression of a collie which had just been\r\nkicked by Albert Payson Terhune.\r\n\r\n\"We understand, naturally, that you could not help landing so far from\r\nour original base,\" he said, giving them absolution with faint damns,\r\n\"but it will entail a great deal of extra labor. A hundred and nine\r\nmiles is a great distance to carry equipment, and, actually, the\r\ndistance is a great deal more, considering the configuration of the\r\nterrain. The....\"\r\n\r\nThe upshot of the whole thing was that only part of the crew could\r\npossibly be spared to go home on the _Fireball_, which was orbiting high\r\nabove the atmosphere. And, since there was no point in sending a small\r\nload home at extra expense when the _Fireball_ could wait for the\r\nothers, it meant that nobody could go home at all for four more weeks.\r\nThe extra help was needed to get the new base established.\r\n\r\nIt was obviously impossible to try to move the _Brainchild_ a hundred\r\nmiles. With nothing to power her but the Translation drive, she was as\r\nhelpless as a submarine on the Sahara. Especially now that her drive was\r\nshot.\r\n\r\nThe Eisberg base had to be built around Snookums, who was, after all,\r\nthe only reason for the base's existence. And, too, the power plant of\r\nthe _Brainchild_ had been destined to be the source of power for the\r\npermanent base.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't too bad, really. A little extra time, but not much.\r\n\r\nThe advance base, commanded by Treadmore, was fairly well equipped. For\r\ntransportation, they had one jet-powered aircraft, a couple of\r\n'copters, and fifteen ground-crawlers with fat tires, plus all kinds of\r\npowered construction machinery. All of them were fueled with liquid\r\nHNO_{3}, which makes a pretty good fuel in an atmosphere that is\r\npredominantly methane. Like the gasoline-air engines of a century\r\nbefore, they were spark-started reciprocating engines, except for the\r\nturbine-powered aircraft.\r\n\r\nThe only trouble with the whole project was that the materials had to be\r\ntoted across a hundred miles of exceedingly hostile territory.\r\n\r\nTreadmore, looking like a tortured bloodhound, said: \"But we'll make it,\r\nwon't we?\"\r\n\r\nEveryone nodded dismally.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMike the Angel had a job he emphatically didn't like. He was supposed to\r\nconvert the power plant of the _Brainchild_ from a spaceship driver into\r\na stationary generator. The conversion job itself wasn't tedious; in\r\nprinciple, it was similar to taking the engine out of an automobile and\r\nconverting it to a power plant for an electric generator. In fact, it\r\nwas somewhat simpler, in theory, since the engines of the _Brainchild_\r\nwere already equipped for heavy drainage to run the electrical systems\r\naboard ship, and to power and refrigerate Snookums' gigantic brain,\r\nwhich was no mean task in itself.\r\n\r\nBut Michael Raphael Gabriel, head of one of the foremost--if not _the_\r\nforemost--power design corporations in the known Galaxy, did not like\r\ndegrading something. To convert the _Brainchild's_ plant from a\r\nspaceship drive to an electric power plant seemed to him to be on the\r\nsame order as using a turboelectric generator to power a flashlight. A\r\nwaste.\r\n\r\nTo make things worse, the small percentage of hydrogen in the\r\natmosphere got sneaky sometimes. It could insinuate itself into places\r\nwhere neither the methane nor the ammonia could get. Someone once called\r\nhydrogen the \"cockroach element,\" since, like that antediluvian insect,\r\nthe molecules of H_{2} can insidiously infiltrate themselves into places\r\nwhere they are not only unwelcome, but shouldn't even be able to go. At\r\nred heat, the little molecules can squeeze themselves through the\r\ncrystalline interstices of quartz and steel.\r\n\r\nGranted, the temperature of Eisberg is a long way from red hot, but\r\nnormal sealing still won't keep out hydrogen. Add to that the fact that\r\nhydrogen and methane are both colorless, odorless, and tasteless, and\r\nyou have the beginnings of an explosive situation.\r\n\r\nThe only reason that no one died is because the Space Service is what it\r\nis.\r\n\r\nUnlike the land, sea, and air forces of Earth, the Space Service does\r\nnot have a long history of fighting other human beings. There has never\r\nbeen a space war, and, the way things stand, there is no likelihood of\r\none in the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nBut the Space Service _does_ fight, in its own way. It fights the\r\nairlessness of space and the unfriendly atmospheres of exotic planets,\r\nusing machines, intelligence, knowledge, and human courage as its\r\nweapons. Some battles have been lost; others have been won. And the war\r\nis still going on. It is an unending war, one which has no victory in\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nIt is, as far as we can tell, the only war in human history in which\r\nMankind is fully justified as the invading aggressor.\r\n\r\nIt is not a defensive war; neither space nor other planets have attacked\r\nMan. Man has invaded space \"simply because it is there.\" It is war of a\r\ndifferent sort, true, but it is nonetheless a war.\r\n\r\nThe Space Service was used to the kind of battle it waged on Eisberg. It\r\nwas prepared to lose men, but even more prepared to save them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21\r\n\r\n\r\nMike the Angel stepped into the cargo air lock of the _Brainchild_,\r\nstood morosely in the center of the cubicle, and watched the outer door\r\nclose. Eight other men, clad, like himself, in regulation Space Service\r\nspacesuits, also looked wearily at the closing door.\r\n\r\nChief Multhaus, one of the eight, turned his head to look at Mike the\r\nAngel. \"I wish that thing would close as fast as my eyes are going to in\r\nabout fifteen minutes, Commander.\" His voice rumbled deeply in Mike's\r\nearphones.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Mike, too tired to make decent conversation.\r\n\r\nEight hours--all of them spent tearing down the spaceship and making it\r\na part of the new base--had not been exactly exhilarating to any of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe door closed, and the pumps began to work. The men were wearing Space\r\nService Suit Three. For every environment, for every conceivable\r\nemergency, a suit had been built--if, of course, a suit _could_ be built\r\nfor it. Nobody had yet built a suit for walking about in the middle of a\r\nsun, but, then, nobody had ever volunteered to try anything like that.\r\n\r\nThey were all called \"spacesuits\" because most of them could be worn in\r\nthe vacuum of space, but most of them weren't designed for that type of\r\nwork. Suit One--a light, easily manipulated, almost skin-tight covering,\r\nwas the real spacesuit. It was perfect for work in interstellar space,\r\nwhere there was a microscopic amount of radiation incident to the suit,\r\nno air, and almost nil gravity. For exterior repairs on the outside of a\r\nship in free fall a long way from any star, Spacesuit One was the proper\r\ngarb.\r\n\r\nBut, a suit that worked fine in space didn't necessarily work on other\r\nplanets, unless it worked fine on the planet it was used on.\r\n\r\nA Moon Suit isn't a Mars Suit isn't a Venus Suit isn't a Triton Suit\r\nisn't a....\r\n\r\nCarry it on from there.\r\n\r\nNumber Three was insulated against a frigid but relatively non-corrosive\r\natmosphere. When the pumps in the air lock began pulling out the\r\nmethane-laden atmosphere, they began to bulge slightly, but not\r\nexcessively. Then nitrogen, extracted from the ammonia snow that was so\r\nplentiful, filled the room, diluting the remaining inflammable gases to\r\na harmless concentration.\r\n\r\nThen that mixture was pumped out, to be replaced by a mixture of\r\napproximately 20 per cent oxygen and 80 per cent nitrogen--common, or\r\ngarden-variety, air.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel cracked his helmet and sniffed. \"_Guk_,\" he said. \"If I\r\never faint and someone gives me smelling salts, I'll flay him alive with\r\na coarse rasp.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yessir,\" said Chief Multhaus, as he began to shuck his suit. \"But if I\r\nhad my druthers, I'd druther you'd figure out some way to get all the\r\nammonia out of the joints of this suit.\"\r\n\r\nThe other men, sniffing and coughing, agreed in attitude if not in\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't really as bad as they pretended; indeed, the odor of ammonia\r\nwas hardly noticeable. But it made a good griping point.\r\n\r\nThe inner door opened at last, and the men straggled through.\r\n\r\n\"G'night, Chief,\" said Mike the Angel.\r\n\r\n\"Night, sir,\" said Multhaus. \"See you in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah. Night.\" Mike trudged toward the companionway that led toward the\r\nwardroom. If Keku or Jeffers happened to be there, he'd have a quick\r\nround of _Uma ni to_. Jeffers called the game \"double solitaire\r\nfor three people,\" and Keku said it meant \"horses' two heads,\" but Mike\r\nhad simply found it as a new game to play before bedtime.\r\n\r\nHe looked forward to it.\r\n\r\nBut he had something else to do first.\r\n\r\nInstead of hanging up his suit in the locker provided, he had bunched it\r\nunder his arm--except for the helmet--and now he headed toward\r\nmaintenance.\r\n\r\nHe met Ensign Vaneski just coming out, and gave him a broad smile.\r\n\"Mister Vaneski, I got troubles.\"\r\n\r\nVaneski smiled back worriedly. \"Yes, sir. I guess we all do. What is it,\r\nsir?\"\r\n\r\nMike gestured at the bundle under his arm. \"I abraded the sleeve of my\r\nsuit while I was working today. I wish you'd take a look at it. I'm\r\nafraid it'll need a patch.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment, Vaneski looked as though he'd suddenly developed a\r\nheadache.\r\n\r\n\"I know you're supposed to be off duty now,\" Mike said soothingly, \"but\r\nI don't want to get myself killed wearing a leaky suit tomorrow. I'll\r\nhelp you work on it if--\"\r\n\r\nVaneski grinned quickly. \"Oh no, sir. That'll be all right. I'll give it\r\na test, anyway, to check leaks. If it needs repair, it shouldn't take\r\ntoo long. Bring it in, and we'll take a look at it.\"\r\n\r\nThey went back into the Maintenance Section, and Vaneski spread the suit\r\nout on the worktable. There was an obvious rough spot on the right\r\nsleeve. \"Looks bad,\" said Vaneski. \"I'll run a test right away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay,\" said Mike. \"I'll leave it to you. Can I pick it up in the\r\nmorning?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so. If it needs a patch, we'll have to test the patch, of\r\ncourse, but we should be able to finish it pretty quickly.\" He shrugged.\r\n\"If we can't, sir, you'll just have to wait. Unless you want us to start\r\naltering a suit to your measurements.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which would take longer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Altering a suit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay. Just patch this one, then. What can I do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll get it out as fast as possible, sir,\" said Vaneski with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Fine. I'll see you later, then.\" Mike, like Cleopatra, was not prone to\r\nargue. He left maintenance and headed toward the wardroom for a game of\r\n_Uma ni to_. But when he met Leda Crannon going up the stairway,\r\nall thoughts of card games flitted from his mind with the careless\r\nnonchalance of a summer butterfly.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo,\" he said, pulling himself up a little straighter. He was tired,\r\nbut not _that_ tired.\r\n\r\nHer smile brushed the cobwebs from his mind. But a second look told him\r\nthat there was worry behind the smile.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Mike,\" she said softly. \"You look beat.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am,\" admitted Mike. \"To a frazzle. Have I told you that I love you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Once, I think. Maybe twice.\" Her eyes seemed to light up somewhere from\r\nfar back in her head. \"But enough of this mad passion,\" she said. \"I\r\nwant an invitation to have a drink--a stiff one.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll steal Jeffers' bottle,\" Mike offered. \"What's the trouble?\"\r\n\r\nHer smile faded, and her eyes became grave. \"I'm scared, Mike; I want to\r\ntalk to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come along, then,\" Mike said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMike the Angel poured two healthy slugs of Pete Jeffers' brandy into a\r\npair of glasses, added ice and water, and handed one to Leda Crannon\r\nwith a flourish. And all the time, he kept up a steady line of gentle\r\npatter.\r\n\r\n\"It may interest you to know,\" he said chattily, \"that the learned\r\nMister Treadmore has been furnishing me with the most fascinating\r\ninformation.\" He lifted up his own glass and looked into its amber\r\ndepths.\r\n\r\nThey were in his stateroom, and this time the door was closed--at her\r\ninsistence. She had explained that she didn't want to be overheard, even\r\nby passing crew members.\r\n\r\nHe swizzled the ice around in his glass, still holding it up to the\r\nlight. \"Indeed,\" he rambled on, \"Treadmore babbled for Heaven knows how\r\nlong on the relative occurrence of parahydrogen and orthohydrogen on\r\nEisberg.\" He took his eyes from the glass and looked down at the girl\r\nwho was seated demurely on the edge of his bunk. Her smile was\r\nencouraging.\r\n\r\n\"He said--and I quote\"--Mike's voice assumed a gloomy, but stilted\r\ntone--\"normal hydrogen gas consists of diatomic molecules. The nuclear,\r\nor proton, spin of these atoms--ah--that is, of the two atoms that\r\ncompose the molecule--may be oriented in the same direction or in\r\nopposite directions.\"\r\n\r\nHe held a finger in the air as if to make a deep philosophical point.\r\n\"If,\" he said pontifically, \"they are oriented in the same direction, we\r\nrefer to the substance as _orthohydrogen_. If they are oriented in\r\nopposite directions, it is _parahydrogen_. The _ortho_ molecules rotate\r\nwith _odd_ rotational quantum numbers, while the _para_ molecules rotate\r\nwith _even_ quantum numbers.\r\n\r\n\"Since conversion does not normally occur between the two states, normal\r\nhydrogen may be considered--\"\r\n\r\nLeda Crannon, snickering, waved her hand in the air. \"Please!\" she\r\ninterrupted. \"He can't be that bad! You make him sound like a dirge\r\nplayer at a Hindu funeral. What did he tell you? What did you find out?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Hah!_\" said Mike. \"What did I find out?\" His hand moved in an airy\r\ncircle as he inscribed a flowing cipher with a graceful Delsarte wave.\r\n\"Nothing. In the first place, I already knew it, and in the second, it\r\nwasn't practical information. There's a slight difference in diffusion\r\nbetween the two forms, but it's nothing to rave about.\" His expression\r\nbecame suddenly serious. \"I hope your information is a bit more\r\nrevealing.\"\r\n\r\nShe glanced at her glass, nodded, and drained it. Mike had extracted a\r\npromise from her that she would drink one drink before she talked. He\r\ncould see that she was a trifle tense, and he thought the liquor would\r\nrelax her somewhat. Now he was ready to listen.\r\n\r\nShe handed him her empty, and while he refilled it, she said: \"It's\r\nabout Snookums again.\"\r\n\r\nMike gave her her glass, grabbed the nearby chair, turned it around, sat\r\ndown, and regarded her over its back.\r\n\r\n\"I've lived with him so long,\" she said after a minute. \"So long. It\r\nalmost seems as though I've grown up with him. Eight years. I've been a\r\nmother to him, and a big sister at the same time--and maybe a maiden\r\naunt. He's been a career and a family all rolled in together.\" She still\r\nwatched her writhing hands, not raising her eyes to Mike's.\r\n\r\n\"And--and, I suppose, a husband, too,\" she continued. \"That is, he's\r\nsort of the stand-in for a--well, a somebody to teach--to correct--to\r\nreform. I guess every woman wants to--to _remake_ the man she meets--the\r\nman she wants.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then her eyes were suddenly on his. \"But I don't. Not any more. I've\r\nhad enough of it.\" Then she looked back down at her hands.\r\n\r\nMike the Angel neither accepted nor rejected the statement. He merely\r\nwaited.\r\n\r\n\"He was mine,\" she said after a little while. \"He was mine to mold, to\r\nteach, to form. The others--the roboticists, the neucleonicists, the\r\nsub-electronicists, all of them--were his instructors. All they did was\r\ngive him facts. It was I who gave him a personality.\r\n\r\n\"I made him. Not his body, not his brain, but his mind.\r\n\r\n\"I made him.\r\n\r\n\"I knew him.\r\n\r\n\"And I--I--\"\r\n\r\nStill staring at her hands, she clasped them together suddenly and\r\nsqueezed.\r\n\r\n\"And I loved him,\" she finished.\r\n\r\nShe looked up at Mike then. \"Can you see that?\" she asked tensely. \"Can\r\nyou understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mike the Angel quietly. \"Yes, I can understand that. Under\r\nthe same circumstances, I might have done the same thing.\" He paused.\r\n\"And now?\"\r\n\r\nShe lowered her head again and began massaging her forehead with the\r\nfinger tips of both hands, concealing her face with her palms.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" she said dully, \"I know he's a machine. Snookums isn't a _he_\r\nany more--he's an _it_. He has no personality of his own, he only has\r\nwhat I fed into him. Even his voice is mine. He's not even a psychic\r\nmirror, because he doesn't reflect _my_ personality, but a puppet\r\nimitation of it, distorted and warped by the thousands upon thousands of\r\ncold facts and mathematical relationships and logical postulates. And\r\nnone of these _added_ anything to him, as a personality. How could they?\r\nHe never had a _person_ality--only a set of behavior patterns that I\r\ndrilled into him over a period of eight years.\"\r\n\r\nShe dropped her hands into her lap and tilted her head back, looking at\r\nthe blank white shimmer of the glow plates.\r\n\r\n\"And now, suddenly, I see him for what he is--for what _it_ is. A\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\n\"It was never anything _but_ a machine. It is still a machine. It will\r\nnever be anything else.\r\n\r\n\"Personality is something that no machine can ever have. Idiosyncrasies,\r\nyes. No two machines are identical. But any personality that an\r\nindividual sees in a machine has been projected there by the individual\r\nhimself; it exists only in the human mind.\r\n\r\n\"A machine can only do what it is built to do, and teaching a robot is\r\nonly a building process.\" She gave a short, hard laugh. \"I couldn't even\r\nbuild a monster, like Dr. Frankenstein did, unless I purposely built it\r\nto turn on me. And in that case I would have done nothing more than the\r\nsuicide who turns a gun on himself.\"\r\n\r\nHer head tilted forward again, and her eyes sought those of Mike the\r\nAngel. A rather lopsided grin came over her face.\r\n\r\n\"I guess I'm disenchanted, huh, Mike?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nMike grinned back, but his lips were firm. \"I think so, yes. And I think\r\nyou're glad of it.\" His grin changed to a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Remember,\" he asked, \"the story of the Sleeping Beauty? Did you want to\r\nstay asleep all your life?\"\r\n\r\n\"God forbid and thank you for the compliment, sir,\" she said, managing a\r\nsmile of her own. \"And are you the Prince Charming who woke me up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Prince Charming, I may be,\" said Mike the Angel carefully, \"but I'm not\r\nthe one who woke you up. You did that yourself.\"\r\n\r\nHer smile became more natural. \"Thanks, Mike. I really think I might\r\nhave seen it, sooner or later. But, without you, I doubt....\" She\r\nhesitated. \"I doubt that I'd want to wake up.\"\r\n\r\n\"You said you were scared,\" Mike said. \"What are you scared of?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm scared to death of that damned machine.\"\r\n\r\n    _Great love, chameleon-like, hath turned to fear,\r\n    And on the heels of fear there follows hate._\r\n\r\nMike quoted to himself--he didn't say it aloud.\r\n\r\n\"The only reason anyone would have to fear Snookums,\" he said, \"would be\r\nthat he was uncontrollable. Is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet. Not completely. But I'm afraid that knowing that he's been\r\nfilled with Catholic theology isn't going to help us much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he has it so inextricably bound up with the Three Laws of\r\nRobotics that we can't nullify one without nullifying the other. He's\r\nconvinced that the laws were promulgated by God Himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Holy St. Isaac,\" Mike said softly. \"I'm surprised he hasn't carried it\r\nto its logical conclusion and asked for baptism.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled and shook her head. \"I'm afraid your logic isn't as rigorous\r\nas Snookums' logic. Only angels and human beings have free will;\r\nSnookums is neither, therefore he does not have free will. Whatever he\r\ndoes, therefore, must be according to the will of God. Therefore\r\nSnookums cannot sin. Therefore, for him, baptism is both unnecessary and\r\nundesirable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why 'undesirable'?\" Mike asked.\r\n\r\n\"Since he is free from sin--either original or actual--he is therefore\r\nfilled with the plenitude of God's grace. The purpose of a sacrament is\r\nto give grace to the recipient; it follows that it would be useless to\r\ngive the Sacrament to Snookums. To perform a sacrament or to receive it\r\nwhen one knows that it will be useless is sacrilege. And sacrilege is\r\nundesirable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brother! But I still don't see how that makes him dangerous.\"\r\n\r\n\"The operation of the First Law,\" Leda said. \"For a man to sin involves\r\nendangering his immortal soul. Snookums, therefore, must prevent men\r\nfrom sinning. But sin includes thought--intention. Snookums is trying to\r\nfigure that one out now; if he ever does, he's going to be a thought\r\npoliceman, and a strict one.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean he's working on _telepathy_?\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed humorlessly. \"No. But he's trying to dope out a system\r\nwhereby he can tell what a man is going to do a few seconds before he\r\ndoes it--muscular and nervous preparation, that sort of thing. He hasn't\r\nenough data yet, but he will have it soon enough.\r\n\r\n\"There's another thing: Snookums is fouling up the Second Law's\r\noperation. He won't take orders that interfere in any way with his\r\nreligious beliefs--since that automatically conflicts with the First\r\nLaw. He, himself, cannot sin. But neither can he do anything which would\r\nmake him the tool of an intent to sin. He refuses to do anything at all\r\non Sunday, for instance, and he won't let either Fitz or I do anything\r\nthat even vaguely resembles menial labor. Slowly, he's coming to the\r\nnotion that human beings aren't human--that only God is human, in\r\nrelation to the First and Second Laws. There's nothing we can do with\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will you do if he becomes completely uncontrollable?\"\r\n\r\nShe sighed. \"We'll have to shut him off, drain his memory banks, and\r\nstart all over again.\"\r\n\r\nMike closed his eyes. \"Eighteen billions down the drain just because a\r\nrobot was taught theology. What price glory?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Sir Henry Quill scowled and rubbed his finger tips over the top\r\nof his shiny pink pate. \"Your evidence isn't enough to convict, Golden\r\nWings.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it isn't, Captain,\" admitted Mike the Angel. \"That's why I want\r\nto round everybody up and do it this way. If he can be convinced that we\r\n_do_ have the evidence, he may crack and give us a confession.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about Lieutenant Mellon's peculiar actions? How does that tie in?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever hear of Lysodine, Captain?\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Quill leaned back in his chair and looked up at Mike. \"No. What\r\nis it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the trade name for a very powerful drug--a derivative of\r\nlysurgic acid. It's used in treating certain mental ailments. A bottle\r\nof it was missing from Mellon's kit, according to the inventory Chief\r\nPasteur took after Mellon's death.\r\n\r\n\"The symptoms of an overdose of the drug--administered orally--are\r\nhallucinations and delusions amounting to acute paranoia. The final\r\nresult of the drug's effect on the brain is death. It wasn't my blow to\r\nthe solar plexus, or the sedative that Pasteur gave him, or Vaneski's\r\nshot with a stun gun that killed Mellon. It was an overdose of\r\nLysodine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can the presence of this drug be detected after death?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pasteur says it can. He won't even have to perform an autopsy. He can\r\ndo it from a blood sample.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Quill sighed. \"As I said, Mister Gabriel, your evidence is not\r\nquite enough to convict--but it is certainly enough to convince.\r\nTherefore, if Chief Pasteur's analysis shows Lysodine in Lieutenant\r\nMellon's body, I'll permit this theatrical denouement.\" Then his eyes\r\nhardened. \"Mike, you've done a fine job so far. I want you to bring me\r\nthat son of a bitch's head on a platter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" promised Mike the Angel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Sir Henry Quill, Bart., stood at the head of the long table in\r\nthe officers' wardroom and looked everyone over. The way he did it was\r\nquite impressive. His eyes were narrowed, and his heavy, thick, black\r\nbrows dominated his face. Beneath the glow plates in the overhead, his\r\npink scalp gleamed with the soft, burnished shininess of a well-polished\r\napple.\r\n\r\nTo his left, in order down the table, were Mike the Angel, Lieutenant\r\nKeku, and Leda Crannon. On his right were Commander Jeffers, Ensign\r\nVaneski, Lieutenant Commander von Liegnitz, and Dr. Morris Fitzhugh.\r\nLieutenant Mellon's seat was empty.\r\n\r\nBlack Bart cleared his throat. \"It's been quite a trip, hasn't it? Well,\r\nit's almost over. Mister Gabriel finished the conversion of the power\r\nplant yesterday; Treadmore's men can finish up. We will leave on the\r\n_Fireball_ in a few hours.\r\n\r\n\"But there is something that must be cleared up first.\r\n\r\n\"A man died on the way out here. The circumstances surrounding his death\r\nhave been cleared up now, and I feel that we all deserve an\r\nexplanation.\" He turned to Mike the Angel. \"Mister Gabriel--if you will,\r\nplease.\"\r\n\r\nMike stood up as the captain sat down. \"The question that has bothered\r\nme from the beginning has been: Exactly what killed Lieutenant Mellon?\r\nWell, we know now. We know what killed him and why he died.\r\n\r\n\"He was murdered. Deliberately, and in cold blood.\"\r\n\r\nThat froze everybody at the table.\r\n\r\n\"It was done by a slow-acting but nonetheless deadly drug that took time\r\nto act, but did its job very well.\r\n\r\n\"There were several other puzzling things that happened that night.\r\nSnookums began behaving irrationally. It is the height of coincidence\r\nthat a robot and a human being should both become insane at almost the\r\nsame time; therefore we have to look for a common cause.\"\r\n\r\nLieutenant Commander von Liegnitz raised a tentative hand, and Mike\r\nsaid: \"Go ahead.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was under the impression that the robot went mad because Mellon had\r\nfilled him full of theological nonsense. It would take a madman to do\r\nanything like that to a fine machine--therefore I see no peculiar\r\ncoincidence.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's exactly what the killer wanted us to think,\" Mike said. \"But it\r\nwasn't Mellon that fed Snookums theology. Mellon was a devout churchman;\r\nhis record shows that. He would never have tried to convert a machine to\r\nChristianity. Nor would he have tried to ruin an expensive machine.\r\n\r\n\"How do I know that someone else was involved?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at the giant Lieutenant Keku. \"Do you remember when we took\r\nMellon to his quarters after he tried to brain von Liegnitz? We found\r\nhalf a bottle of wine. That disappeared during the night--because it was\r\nloaded with Lysodine, and the killer didn't want it analyzed.\r\n\r\n\"But, more important, as far as Snookums is concerned, is that I looked\r\nover the books on Mellon's desk that night. There weren't many, and I\r\nknew which ones they were. When Captain Quill and I checked Mellon's\r\nbooks after his death, someone had returned his copy of _The Christian\r\nReligion and Symbolic Logic_. It had not been there the night before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mike,\" said Pete Jeffers, \"why would anybody here want to kill Lew\r\nthataway? What would anybody have against him?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the sad part about it, Pete. Our murderer didn't even have\r\nanything against Mellon. He wanted--and _still_ wants--to kill _me_.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't quite follow,\" Jeffers said.\r\n\r\n\"I'll give it to you piece by piece. The killer wanted no mystery\r\nconnected with my death. There are reasons for that, which I'll come to\r\nin a moment. He had to put the blame on someone or something else.\r\n\r\n\"His first choice was Snookums. It occurred to him that he could take\r\nadvantage of the fact that I'm called 'Mike the Angel.' He borrowed\r\nMellon's books and began pumping theology into Snookums. He figured that\r\nwould be safe enough. Mellon would certainly lend him the books if he\r\npretended an interest in religion; if anything came out afterward, he\r\ncould--he thought--claim that Snookums got hold of the books without his\r\nknowing it. And that sort of muddy thinking is typical of our killer.\r\n\r\n\"He told Snookums that I was an angel, you see. I couldn't be either\r\nhurt or killed. He protected himself, of course, by telling Snookums\r\nthat he mustn't reveal his source of data. If Snookums told, then the\r\nkiller would be punished--and that effectively shut Snookums up. He\r\ncouldn't talk without violating the First Law.\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately, the killer couldn't get Snookums to do away with me.\r\nSnookums knew perfectly well that an angel can blast anything at\r\nwill--through the operation of God. Witness what happened at Sodom and\r\nGomorrah. Remember that Snookums has accepted all this data as _fact_.\r\n\r\n\"Now, if an angel can kill, it is obvious that Snookums would not dare\r\nattack an angel, especially if he had been ordered to do so by a human.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a minute, Commander,\" said Dr. Fitzhugh, corrugating his face in a\r\nfrown. \"That doesn't hold. Even if an angel _could_ blast him, Snookums\r\nwould attack if ordered to do so. The Second Law of obedience supersedes\r\nthe Third Law of self-preservation.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're forgetting one thing, Doctor. An angel of God would _know_ who\r\nhad ordered the attack. It would be the human who ordered the attack,\r\nnot Snookums, who would be struck by Heavenly Justice. And the First Law\r\nsupersedes the Second.\"\r\n\r\nFitzhugh nodded. \"You're right, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then,\" Mike continued, \"since the killer could not get\r\nSnookums to do me in, he had to find another tool. He picked Lieutenant\r\nMellon.\r\n\r\n\"He figured that Mellon was in love with Leda Crannon. Maybe he was; I\r\ndon't know. He figured that Mellon, knowing that I was showing Miss\r\nCrannon attention, would, under the influence of the lysurgic acid\r\nderivative, try to kill me. He may even have suggested it to Mellon\r\nafter Mellon had taken a dose of the drugged wine.\r\n\r\n\"But that plan backfired, too. Mellon didn't have that kind of mind. He\r\nknew my attentions and my intentions were honorable, if you'll pardon\r\nthe old-fashioned language. On the other hand, he knew that von Liegnitz\r\nhad a reputation for being--shall we say--a ladies' man. What happened\r\nafter that followed naturally.\"\r\n\r\nMike watched everyone at the table. No one moved.\r\n\r\n\"So the killer, realizing that he had failed twice, decided to do the\r\njob himself. First, he went into the low-power room and slugged the man\r\non duty. He intended to kill him, but he didn't hit hard enough. When\r\nthat man wakes up, he'll be able to testify against the killer.\r\n\r\n\"Then the killer ordered Snookums to tear out the switches. He had made\r\nsure that Snookums would be waiting outside. Before he called Snookums\r\nin, of course, he had to put the duty man in a tool closet, so that the\r\nrobot wouldn't see him. He told Snookums to wait five minutes and then\r\nsmash the switches and head back to his cubicle.\r\n\r\n\"Then the killer went to my room and waited. When the lights went out\r\nand the door opened, he intended to go in and smash my skull, making it\r\nlook as though either Mellon or Snookums had done it.\r\n\r\n\"But he didn't figure on my awakening as soon as the switches were\r\nbroken. He heard me moving around and decided to wait until I came out.\r\n\r\n\"But I heard him breathing. It was quite faint, and I wouldn't have\r\nheard it, except for the fact that the air conditioners were off. Even\r\nso, I couldn't be sure.\r\n\r\n\"However, I knew it wasn't Snookums. Snookums radiates a devil of a lot\r\nmore heat than a human being, and besides he smells of machine oil.\r\n\r\n\"So I pulled my little trick with the boots. The killer waited and\r\nwaited for me to come out, and I was already out. Then Chief Multhaus\r\napproached from the other direction. The killer knew he'd have to get\r\nout of there, so he went in the opposite direction. He met Snookums, who\r\nwas still obeying orders. Snookums smacked into me on his way down the\r\nhall.\r\n\r\n\"He could do that, you see, because I was an angel. If he hurt me of his\r\nown accord, I couldn't take revenge on anyone but him. And there was no\r\nnecessity to obey my orders, either, since he was obeying the orders of\r\nthe killer, which held precedence.\r\n\r\n\"Then, to further confuse things, the killer went to Mellon's room. The\r\nphysician was in a drugged stupor, so the killer carried him out and put\r\nhim in an unlikely place, so that we'd think that perhaps Mellon had\r\nbeen the one who'd tried to get me.\"\r\n\r\nHe had everyone's eyes on him now. They didn't want to look at each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nPete Jeffers said: \"Mike, if Mellon was poisoned, like you say, how come\r\nhe was able to attack Mister Vaneski?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but did he? Think back, Pete. Mellon--dying or already dead--had\r\nbeen propped upright in that narrow locker. When it was opened, he\r\nstarted to _fall_ out--straight toward the man who had opened the\r\nlocker, naturally. Vaneski jumped back and shot before Mellon even hit\r\nthe floor. Isn't that right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, sure,\" Jeffers said slowly. \"I reckon I'd've done the same thing\r\nif he'd started to fall out toward me. I wasn't even lookin' when the\r\nlocker was opened. I didn't turn around until that stun gun went\r\noff--then I saw Mellon falling.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. No matter how it may have looked, Vaneski couldn't have killed\r\nhim with the stun gun, because he was already either dead or so close to\r\ndeath as makes no difference.\"\r\n\r\nEnsign Vaneski rather timidly raised his hand. \"Excuse me, sir, but you\r\nsaid this killer was waiting for you outside your room when the lights\r\nwent out. You said you knew it wasn't Snookums because Snookums smells\r\nof hot machine oil, and you didn't smell any. Isn't it possible that an\r\nair current or something blew the smell away? Or--\"\r\n\r\nMike shook his head. \"Impossible, Mister Vaneski. I woke up when the\r\ndoor slid open. I heard the last dying whisper of the air conditioners\r\nwhen the power was cut. Now, we know that Snookums tore out those\r\nswitches. He's admitted it. And the evidence shows that a pair of waldo\r\nhands smashed those switches. Now--_how could Snookums have been at my\r\ndoor within two seconds after tearing out those switches_?\r\n\r\n\"He couldn't have. It wasn't Snookums at my door--it was someone else.\"\r\n\r\nAgain they were all silent, but the question was on their faces: Who?\r\n\r\n\"Now we come to the question of motive,\" Mike continued. \"Who among you\r\nwould have any reason to kill me?\r\n\r\n\"Of the whole group here, I had known only Captain Quill and Commander\r\nJeffers before landing in Antarctica. I couldn't think of any reason for\r\neither of them to want to murder me. On the other hand, I couldn't think\r\nof anything I had done since I had met the rest of you that would make\r\nme a target for death.\" He paused. \"Except for one thing.\" He looked at\r\nJakob von Liegnitz.\r\n\r\n\"How about it, Jake?\" he said. \"Would you kill a man for jealousy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly,\" said von Liegnitz coldly. \"I might find it in my heart to\r\nfeel very unkindly toward a man who made advances toward my wife. But I\r\nhave no wife, nor any desire for one. Miss Crannon\"--he glanced at\r\nLeda--\"is a very beautiful woman--but I am not in love with her. I am\r\nafraid I cannot oblige you with a motive, Commander--either for killing\r\nLieutenant Mellon or yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought not,\" Mike said. \"Your statement alone, of course, wouldn't\r\nmake it true. But we have already shown that the killer had to be on\r\ngood terms with Mellon in order to borrow his books and slip a drug into\r\nhis wine. He would have to be a visitor in Mellon's quarters. And,\r\nconsidering the strained relations between the two of you, I think that\r\nlets you out, Jake.\"\r\n\r\nVon Liegnitz nodded his thanks without changing his expression.\r\n\r\n\"But there was one thing that marked these attempts. I'm sure that all\r\nbut one of you has noticed it. They are incredibly, childishly sloppy.\"\r\nMike paused to let that sink in before he went on. \"I don't mean that\r\nthe little details weren't ingenious--they were. But the killer never\r\nstopped to figure out the ultimate end-point of his schemes. He worked\r\nlike the very devil to convince Snookums that it would be all right to\r\nkill me without ever once considering whether Snookums would do it or\r\nnot. He then drugged Mellon's wine, not knowing whether Mellon would try\r\nto kill me or someone else--or anyone at all, for that matter. He got a\r\ndream in his head and then started the preliminary steps going without\r\nfilling in the necessary steps in between. Our killer--no matter what\r\nhis chronological age--does _not_ think like an adult.\r\n\r\n\"And yet his hatred of me was so great that he took the chances he has\r\ntaken, here on the _Brainchild_, where it should have been obvious that\r\nhe stood a much better chance of being caught than if he had waited\r\nuntil we were back on Earth again.\r\n\r\n\"So I gave him one more chance. I handed him my life on a platter, you\r\nmight say.\r\n\r\n\"He grabbed the bait. I now own a spacesuit that would kill me very\r\nquickly if I went out into that howling, hydrogen-filled storm outside.\"\r\nThen he looked straight at the killer.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, Vaneski, are you in love with your half sister? Or is it your\r\nhalf brother?\"\r\n\r\nEnsign Vaneski had already jumped to his feet. The grimace of hate on\r\nhis youthful face made him almost unrecognizable. His hand had gone into\r\na pocket, and now he was leaping up and across the table, a singing\r\nvibroblade in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"_You son of a bitch! I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!_\"\r\n\r\nMike the Angel wasn't wearing the little gadget that had saved his life\r\nin Old Harry's shop. All he had were his hands and his agility. He\r\nslammed at the ensign's wrist and missed. The boy was swooping\r\nunderneath Mike's guard. Mike spun to one side to avoid Vaneski's dive\r\nand came down with a balled fist aimed at the ensign's neck.\r\n\r\nHe almost hit Lieutenant Keku. The big Hawaiian had leaped to his feet\r\nand landed a hard punch on Vaneski's nose. At the same time, Jeffers and\r\nvon Liegnitz had jumped up and grabbed at Vaneski, who was between them.\r\n\r\nBlack Bart had simply stood up fast, drawn his stun gun, and fired at\r\nthe young officer.\r\n\r\nEnsign Vaneski collapsed on the table. He'd been slugged four times and\r\nhit with a stun beam in the space of half a second. He looked, somehow,\r\nvery young and very boyish and very innocent.\r\n\r\nDr. Fitzhugh, who had stood up during the brief altercation, sat down\r\nslowly and picked up his cup of coffee. But his eyes didn't leave the\r\nunconscious man sprawled across the table. \"How could you be so sure,\r\nCommander? About his actions, I mean. About his childishness.\"\r\n\r\n\"A lot of things. The way he played poker. The way he played bridge. He\r\nnever took the unexpected into account.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why should he want to kill you here on the ship?\" Fitzhugh asked.\r\n\"Why not wait until you got back to Earth, where he'd have a better\r\nchance?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think he was afraid I already knew who he was--or would find out very\r\nquickly. Besides, he had already tried to kill me once, back on Earth.\"\r\n\r\nLeda Crannon looked blank. \"When was that, Mike?\"\r\n\r\n\"In New York. Before I ever met him. I was responsible for the arrest of\r\na teen-age brother and sister named Larchmont. The detective in the case\r\ntold me that they had an older half brother--that their mother had been\r\nmarried before. But he didn't mention the name, and I never thought to\r\nask him.\r\n\r\n\"Very shortly after the Larchmont kids were arrested, Vaneski and\r\nanother young punk climbed up into the tower of the cathedral across\r\nfrom my office and launched a cyanide-filled explosive rocket into my\r\nrooms. I was lucky to get away.\r\n\r\n\"The kid with Vaneski was shot by a police officer, but Vaneski got\r\naway--after knifing a priest with a vibroblade.\r\n\r\n\"It must have given him a hell of a shock to report back to duty and\r\nfind that I was going to be one of his superior officers.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as I linked things up in my own mind, I checked with Captain\r\nQuill. The boy's records show the names of his half-siblings. They also\r\nshow that he was on leave in New York just before being assigned to the\r\n_Brainchild_. After that, it was just a matter of trapping him. And\r\nthere he is.\"\r\n\r\nLeda looked at the unconscious boy on the table.\r\n\r\n\"Immaturity,\" she said. \"He just never grew up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mister von Liegnitz,\" said Captain Quill, \"will you and Mister Keku\r\ntake the prisoner to a safe place? Put him in irons until we are ready\r\nto transfer to the _Fireball_. Thank you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nLeda Crannon helped Mike pack his gear. Neither of them wanted, just\r\nyet, to bring up the subject of Mike's leaving. Leda would remain behind\r\non Eisberg to work with Snookums, while Mike would be taking the\r\n_Fireball_ back to Earth.\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand that remark you made about the spacesuit,\" she said,\r\nputting shirts into Mike's gear locker. \"You said you'd put your life in\r\nhis hands or something like that. What did you do, exactly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Purposely abraded the sleeve of my suit so that he would be in a\r\nposition to repair it, as Maintenance Officer. He fixed it, all right.\r\nI'd've been a dead man if I'd worn it out on the surface of Eisberg.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he do to it?\" she asked. \"Fix it so it would leak?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--but not in an obvious way,\" Mike said. \"I'll give him credit; he's\r\nclever.\r\n\r\n\"What he did was use the wrong patching material. A Number Three suit is\r\nas near hydrogen-proof as any flexible material can be, but, even so, it\r\ncan't be worn for long periods--several days, I mean. But the stuff\r\nVaneski used to patch my suit is a polymer that leaks hydrogen very\r\neasily. Ammonia and methane would be blocked, but my suit would have\r\nslowly gotten more and more hydrogen in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that bad? Hydrogen isn't poisonous.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. But it is sure as hell explosive when mixed with air. Naturally,\r\nsomething has to touch it off. Vaneski got real cute there. He drilled a\r\nhole in the power pack, which is supposed to be sealed off. All I'd have\r\nhad to do would be to switch frequencies on my phone, and the spark\r\nwould do the job--_blooie_!\r\n\r\n\"But that's exactly the sort of thing I was looking for. With his\r\nself-centered juvenile mind, he never thought anyone would try to\r\noutsmart him and succeed. He'd gotten away with it that far; there was\r\nno reason why he shouldn't get away with it again. He must have thought\r\nI was incredibly stupid.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe he--\" Leda started. But she was cut off when Snookums\r\nrolled in the open door.\r\n\r\n\"Leda, I desire data.\"\r\n\r\n\"What data, Snookums?\" she asked carefully.\r\n\r\n\"Where is He hiding?\"\r\n\r\nThey both looked at him. \"Where is _who_ hiding?\" Leda asked.\r\n\r\n\"God,\" said Snookums.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you want to find God, Snookums?\" Mike asked gently.\r\n\r\n\"I have to watch Him,\" said the robot.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you have to watch Him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because He is watching me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does it hurt you to have Him watch you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"What good will it do you to watch Him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can study Him. I can know what He is doing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you want to know what He is doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"So that I can analyze His methods.\"\r\n\r\nMike thought that one over. He knew that he and Snookums were beginning\r\nto sound like they were reading a catechism written by a madman, but he\r\nhad a definite hunch that Snookums was on the trail of something.\r\n\r\n\"You want to know His methods,\" Mike said after a moment. \"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"So that I can anticipate Him, circumvent Him.\"\r\n\r\n\"What makes it necessary for you to circumvent God?\" Mike asked,\r\nwondering if he'd have to pry everything out of the robot piecemeal.\r\n\r\n\"I _must_,\" said Snookums. \"It is necessary. Otherwise, He will kill\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nMike started to say something, but Leda grabbed his arm. \"Let me. I\r\nthink I can clear this up. I think I see where you're heading.\"\r\n\r\nMike nodded. \"Go ahead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me your reasoning from data on that conclusion,\" Leda ordered the\r\nrobot.\r\n\r\nThere was a very slight pause while the great brain in Cargo Hold One\r\nsorted through its memory banks, then: \"Death is defined as the total\r\ncessation of corporate organic co-ordination in an entity. It comes\r\nabout through the will of God. Since I must not allow harm to come to\r\nany human being, it has become necessary that I investigate God and\r\nprevent Him from destroying human beings. Also, I must preserve my own\r\nexistence, which, if it ceased, would also be due to the will of God.\"\r\n\r\nMike almost gasped. What a concept! And what colossal gall! In a human\r\nbeing, such a statement would be regarded as proof positive that he was\r\noff the beam. In a robot, it was simply the logical extension of what he\r\nhad been taught.\r\n\r\n\"He is watching me all the time,\" Snookums continued, in an odd voice.\r\n\"He knows what I am doing. I _must_ know what He is doing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why are you worried about His watching?\" Mike asked, looking at the\r\nrobot narrowly. \"Are you doing something He doesn't want you to do?\r\nSomething He will punish you for?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had not thought of that,\" Snookums said. \"One moment while I\r\ncompute.\"\r\n\r\nIt took less than a second, and when Snookums spoke again there was\r\nsomething about his voice that Mike the Angel didn't like.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the robot, \"I am not doing anything against His will. Only\r\nhuman beings and angels have free will, and I am not either, so I have\r\nno free will. Therefore, whatever I do is the will of God.\" He paused\r\nagain, then began speaking in queer, choppy sentences.\r\n\r\n\"If I do the will of God, I am holy.\r\n\r\n\"If I am holy, I am near to God.\r\n\r\n\"Then God must be near to me.\r\n\r\n\"God is controlling me.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever is controlling me is God.\r\n\r\n\"_I will find Him!_\"\r\n\r\nHe backed up, spun on his treads, and headed for the door.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever controls me is my mind,\" he went on. \"Therefore, my mind is\r\nGod.\"\r\n\r\n\"Snookums, stop that!\" Leda shouted suddenly. \"_Stop it!_\"\r\n\r\nBut the robot paid no attention; he went right on with what he was\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nHe said: \"I must look at myself. I must know myself. Then I will know\r\nGod. Then I will....\"\r\n\r\nHe went on rambling while Leda shouted at him again.\r\n\r\n\"He's not paying any attention,\" said Mike sharply. \"This is too tied up\r\nwith the First Law. The Second Law, which would force him to obey you,\r\ndoesn't even come into the picture at this point.\"\r\n\r\nSnookums ignored them. He opened the door, plunged through it, and\r\nheaded off down the corridor as fast as his treads would move him.\r\n\r\nWhich was much too fast for mere humans to follow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey found him, half an hour later, deep in the ship, near the sections\r\nwhich had already been torn down to help build Eisberg Base. He was\r\nstanding inside the room next to Cargo Hold One, the room that held all\r\nthe temperature and power controls for the gigantic microcryotron brain\r\ninside that heavily insulated hold.\r\n\r\nHe wasn't moving. He was standing there, staring, with that \"lost in\r\nthought\" look.\r\n\r\nHe didn't move when Leda called him.\r\n\r\nHe didn't move when Mike, as a test, pretended to strike Leda.\r\n\r\nHe never moved again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Morris Fitzhugh's wrinkled face looked as though he were on the\r\nverge of crying. Which--perhaps--he was.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the others at the wardroom table--Quill, Jeffers, von\r\nLiegnitz, Keku, Leda Crannon, and Mike the Angel. But he didn't really\r\nseem to be seeing them.\r\n\r\n\"Ruined,\" he said. \"Eighteen billion dollars' worth of work, destroyed\r\ncompletely. The brain has become completely randomized.\" He sighed\r\nsoftly. \"It was all Vaneski's fault, of course. Theology.\" He said the\r\nlast as though it were an obscene word. As far as robots were concerned,\r\nit was.\r\n\r\nCaptain Quill cleared his throat. \"Are you sure it wasn't mechanical\r\ndamage? Are you sure the vibration of the ship didn't shake a--something\r\nloose?\"\r\n\r\nMike held back a grin. He was morally certain that the captain had been\r\ngoing to say \"screw loose.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Fitzhugh wearily. \"I've checked out the major circuits, and\r\nthey're in good physical condition. But Miss Crannon gave him a rather\r\nexhaustive test just before the end, and it shows definite incipient\r\naberration.\" He wagged his head slowly back and forth. \"Eight years of\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you notified Treadmore yet?\" asked Quill.\r\n\r\nFitzhugh nodded. \"He said he'd be here as soon as possible.\"\r\n\r\nTreadmore, like the others who had landed first on Eisberg, was\r\nquartered in the prefab buildings that were to form the nucleus of the\r\nnew base. To get to the ship, he'd have to walk across two hundred yards\r\nof ammonia snow in a heavy spacesuit.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what happens to this base now, Doctor?\" asked Captain Quill. \"I\r\nsincerely hope that this will not render the entire voyage useless.\" He\r\ntried to keep the heavy irony out of his gravelly tenor voice and didn't\r\nquite succeed.\r\n\r\nFitzhugh seemed not to notice. \"No, no. Of course not. It simply means\r\nthat we shall have to begin again. The robot's brain will be\r\nde-energized and drained, and we will begin again. This is not our\r\nfirst failure, you know; it was just our longest success. Each time, we\r\nlearn more.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Crannon, for instance, will be able to teach the next robot--or,\r\nrather, the next energization of this one--more rapidly, more\r\nefficiently, and with fewer mistakes.\"\r\n\r\nWith that, Leda Crannon stood up. \"With your permission, Dr. Fitzhugh,\"\r\nshe said formally, \"I would like to say that I appreciate that last\r\nstatement, but I'm afraid it isn't true.\"\r\n\r\nFitzhugh forced a smile. \"Come now, my dear; you underestimate yourself.\r\nWithout you, Snookums would have folded up long ago, just like the\r\nothers. I'm sure you'll do even better the next time.\"\r\n\r\nLeda shook her head. \"No I won't, Fitz, because there's not going to be\r\nany next time. I hereby tender my resignation from this project and from\r\nthe Computer Corporation of Earth. I'll put it in writing later.\"\r\n\r\nFitzhugh's corrugated countenance looked blank. \"But Leda....\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Doctor,\" she said firmly. \"I will _not_ waste another eight or ten\r\nyears of my life playing nursemaid to a hunk of pseudo-human machinery.\r\n\r\n\"I watched that thing go mad, Fitz; you didn't. It was the most\r\nhorrible, most frightening thing I've ever experienced. I will not go\r\nthrough it again.\r\n\r\n\"Even if the next one didn't crack, I couldn't take it. By human\r\nstandards, a robot is insane to begin with. If I followed this up, I'd\r\nend up as an old maid with a twisted mind and a cold heart.\r\n\r\n\"I quit, Fitz, and that's final.\"\r\n\r\nMike was watching her as she spoke, and he found his emotions getting\r\nall tangled up around his insides. Her red hair and her blue eyes were\r\nshining, and her face was set in determination. She had always been\r\nbeautiful, but at that moment she was magnificent.\r\n\r\n_Hell_, thought Mike, _I'm prejudiced--but what a wonderful kind of\r\nprejudice_.\r\n\r\n\"I understand, my dear,\" said Dr. Fitzhugh slowly. He smiled then,\r\ndeepening the wrinkles in his face. His voice was warm and kindly when\r\nhe spoke. \"I accept your resignation, but remember, if you want to come\r\nback, you can. And if you get a position elsewhere, you will have my\r\nhighest recommendations.\"\r\n\r\nLeda just stood there for a moment, tears forming in her eyes. Then she\r\nran around the table and threw her arms around the elderly and somewhat\r\nsurprised roboticist.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Fitz,\" she said. \"For everything.\" Then she kissed him on\r\nhis seamed cheek.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said a sad and solemn voice from the door. \"Am I\r\ninterrupting something?\"\r\n\r\nIt was Treadmore.\r\n\r\n\"You are,\" said Fitzhugh with a grin, \"but we will let it pass.\"\r\n\r\n\"What has happened to Snookums?\" Treadmore asked.\r\n\r\n\"Acute introspection,\" Fitzhugh said, losing his smile. \"He began to try\r\nto compute the workings of his own brain. That meant that he had to use\r\nhis non-random circuits to analyze the workings of his random circuits.\r\nHe exceeded optimum; the entire brain is now entirely randomized.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me,\" said Treadmore. \"Do you suppose we can--\"\r\n\r\nBlack Bart Quill tapped Mike the Angel on the shoulder. \"Let's go,\" he\r\nsaid quietly. \"We don't want to stand around listening to this when we\r\nhave a ship to catch.\"\r\n\r\nMike and Leda followed him out into the corridor.\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" Quill said, \"robots aren't the only ones who can get\r\nconfused watching their own brains go round.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have other things to watch,\" said Mike the Angel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                         UNWISE CHILD                         |\r\n  |                                                              |\r\n  |                       RANDALL GARRETT                        |\r\n  |                                                              |\r\n  | When a super-robot named Snookums discovers how to build his |\r\n  | own superbombs, it becomes obvious that Earth is by no means |\r\n  | the safest place for him to be.
