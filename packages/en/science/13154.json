They have reached their first resting-place, and pardonably\r\nenjoy the opportunity of looking back at the road they have traversed.\r\nThey pause to contemplate its gloomy beginning, the perilous\r\nprecipices along which it wound, and the sudden quagmires that often\r\ninterrupted it, all now softened by distance and by the consciousness\r\nof success. Opening with a forest-path, it has broadened and\r\nbrightened into a highway of nations.\r\n\r\nSo numerous and various were the influences, formative and impellent,\r\nwhich combined to bring the colonies up to the precise ripening-point\r\nof their independence, as to make it difficult to assign each its\r\nproper force. In the concentric mass, however, they stand out sharp\r\nand clear, and the conjoint effect seems preordained. That the event\r\nshould have come when it did, and not before or after, is as obvious\r\nas any of history's predictions after the fact. Looking through the\r\nglasses of to-day, we find it hard to realize that the Continental\r\nCongress renewed its expressions of loyalty to the king three weeks\r\nafter the battle of Bunker Hill, so distinct before us rises the\r\ncompleted and symmetrical edifice of separation ready for its\r\ncapstone, from its foundations growing steadily through the past.\r\n\r\nThirteen years--one for each State--were occupied in the topping-off.\r\nThe Seven Years' War, that created the new central power of modern\r\nEurope, had a great deal to do with creating the new American power.\r\nIt taught the colonies their strength, gave them several thousand\r\nnative soldiers, and sent them from over the water the material,\r\nsome of it completely wrought, for more in the German immigration\r\nconsequent upon it. Out of it grew the obnoxious enactments that\r\nbrought on the end. So closely simultaneous were these with the king's\r\nproclamation of October 7, 1763, prohibiting all his subjects \"from\r\nmaking any purchases or settlements whatever, or taking possession of\r\nany of the lands, beyond the sources of any of the rivers which fall\r\ninto the Atlantic Ocean from the west or north-west,\" as to support\r\nthe suspicion that the British ministry had a premonitory sense of the\r\ncoming struggle, and meant to prepare for it by checking the expansion\r\nof the colonies. The pressure applied to front and rear was part of\r\none and the same movement; and is incompatible with the accepted\r\nview that neither cabinet nor Parliament anticipated, in the first\r\ninstance, any American opposition to the Stamp Act and the system of\r\nlegislation to which it was the opening wedge. The England of that day\r\nproposed to rule America after much the same fashion with Ireland,\r\nthe Alleghanies presenting themselves very conveniently for an\r\nIndian Pale. This line of policy was in harmony with the ideas then\r\npredominant in England, and was fully understood by the colonists.\r\nThey could not possibly have been blind to it, in view of the\r\ncontinuous and repeated claims of absolute legislative supremacy\r\nformally put forth, from the bill to that effect passed coincidently\r\nwith the repeal of the Stamp Act down to the alterations made in the\r\nMassachusetts charter in 1774; the latter proceeding being in close\r\nharmony, both in time and motive, with the extension of the province\r\nof Quebec to the Ohio--one of the very rare evidences of sagacity and\r\nforesight discernible in the course of the ministry; for, while it did\r\nnot avail to dam the westward flood, it certainly contributed, with\r\nother concessions made at the same time to the Canadians, to save the\r\nSt. Lawrence to the Crown.\r\n\r\nAs apropos to this point, we transcribe from the original\r\nmanuscript, written in the round, clear, unhesitating but steady hand\r\ncharacteristic of all Washington's letters, the following to James\r\nWood of Winchester, afterward governor of Virginia, but then little\r\nmore than a stripling:\r\n\r\n    \"MOUNT VERNON, Feb'y 20th, 1774.\r\n\r\n    \"DEAR SIR: I have to thank you, for your obliging acc't of\r\n    your trip down the Mississippi, contained in a Letter of the\r\n    18th of Octob'r from Winchester--the other Letter, therein\r\n    refer'd to, I have never yet receiv'd, nor did this come\r\n    to hand till some time in November, as I was returning from\r\n    Williamsburg.\r\n\r\n    \"The contradictory acc'ts given of the Lands upon the\r\n    Mississippi are really astonishing--some speak of the Country\r\n    as a terrestrial Paradise, whilst others represent it as\r\n    scarce fit for anything but Slaves and Brutes. I am well\r\n    satisfied, however, from your description of it, that I have\r\n    no cause to regret my disappointment:--The acc't of Lord\r\n    Hillsborough's sentiments of the Proclamation of 1763, I can\r\n    view in no other light than as one, among many other proofs,\r\n    of his Lordship's malignant disposition towards us poor\r\n    Americans, formed equally in malice, absurdity, and error; as\r\n    it would have puzzled this noble Peer, I am persuaded, to have\r\n    assigned any plausible reason in support of this opinion.\r\n\r\n    \"As I do not know but I may shortly see you in Frederick, and\r\n    assuredly shall before the Assembly, I shall add no more than\r\n    that, it will always give me pleasure to see you at this place\r\n    whenever it is convenient to you, and that with compliments\r\n    to your good Mother I remain, D'r Sir, Y'r most Obed't H'ble\r\n    Serv't,\r\n\r\n    \"G'o WASHINGTON.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CAPITOL AT WASHINGTON AND CARPENTERS' HALL, WHERE\r\nTHE FIRST COLONIAL CONGRESS MET.]\r\n\r\nThis private note, discussing casually and curtly the great river\r\nof the West, and the minister who endeavored to make it a _flumen\r\nclausum_ to the colonists, nearly equidistant in date between the\r\nBoston Tea-party and the meeting of the Assembly which called the\r\nfirst Continental Congress, has some public interest. The West\r\nalways possessed a peculiar attraction for Washington. He explored\r\nit personally and through others, and lost no occasion of procuring\r\ndetailed information in regard to its capabilities. He acquired large\r\nbodies of land along the Ohio at different points, from its affluents\r\nat the foot of the Alleghany to the Great Kanawha and below. Now we\r\nsee him gazing farther, over the yet unreddened battle-grounds of\r\nBoone and Lewis, to the magnificent province France and Spain were\r\ncarefully holding in joint trusteeship for the infant state he was to\r\nnurse. The representative in the provincial legislature of a frontier\r\ncounty stretching from the Potomac to the Ohio, we may fancy him\r\ninspired, as he looked around from his post on the vertebral range of\r\nthe continent, with \"something of prophetic strain.\" If so, he was\r\nnot long to have leisure for indulging it. Within eighteen months his\r\nlife's work was to summon him eastward to the sea-shore. The Dark and\r\nBloody Ground must wait. For its tillage other guess implements than\r\nthe plough were preparing--the same that beckoned him to Cambridge and\r\nthe new century.\r\n\r\nThe slender driblet of population which at this juncture flowed\r\ntoward the Lower Mississippi was due to the anxiety of Spain to get a\r\nhome-supply of wheat, hemp and such-like indispensables of temperate\r\nextraction for her broad tropical empire. A newspaper of August 20,\r\n1773 gives news from New York of the arrival at that port of \"the\r\nsloop Mississippi, Capt. Goodrich, with the Connecticut Military\r\nAdventurers from the Mississippi, but last from Pensacola, the 16th\r\ninst.\" They had \"laid out twenty-three townships at the Natchez,\"\r\nwhere lands were in process of rapid occupation, the arrivals\r\nnumbering \"above four hundred families within six weeks, down the Ohio\r\nfrom Virginia and the Carolinas.\" The Connecticut men doubtless came\r\nback prepared, a little later, to vindicate their martial cognomen;\r\nand to aid them in that they were met by Transatlantic recruits in\r\nunusual force. The same journal mentions the arrival at Philadelphia\r\nof 1050 passengers in two ships from Londonderry; this valuable\r\ninfusion of Scotch-Irish brawn, moral, mental and muscular, being\r\nfarther supplemented by three hundred passengers and servants in the\r\nship Walworth from the same port for South Carolina. The cash value to\r\nthe country of immigrants was ascertainable by a much less circuitous\r\ncomputation then than now; many of them being indentured for a term\r\nof years at an annual rate that left a very fair sum for interest and\r\nsinking fund on the one thousand dollars it is the practice of our\r\npolitical economist of to-day to clap on each head that files\r\ninto Castle Garden. The German came with the Celt in almost equal\r\nforce--enough to more than balance their countrymen under Donop,\r\nRiedesel and Knyphausen. The attention drawn to the colonies by the\r\nministerial aggressions thus contributed to strengthen them for the\r\ncontest.\r\n\r\nBut with all these accessions in the nick of time, two millions and\r\na quarter of whites was a meagre outfit for stocking a virgin farm of\r\nfifteen hundred miles square, to say nothing of its future police and\r\nexternal defence against the wolves of the deep. It barely equaled the\r\noriginal population, between the two oceans, of nomadic Indians, who\r\nwere, by general consent, too few to be counted or treated as owners\r\nof the land. It fell far short of the numbers that had constituted,\r\ntwo centuries earlier, the European republic from which our federation\r\nborrowed its name. The task, too, of the occidental United States\r\nwas double. Instead of being condensed into a small, wealthy and\r\ndefensible territory, they had at once to win their independence\r\nfrom a maritime power stronger than Spain, and to redeem from utter\r\ncrudeness and turn into food, clothing and the then recognized\r\nappliances of civilized life the wilderness thus secured. The result\r\ncould not vary nor be doubted; but that the struggle, in war and in\r\npeace, must be slow and wearing, was quite as certain. It is dreary to\r\nlook back upon its commencement now, and upon the earlier decades\r\nof its progress; and we cannot wonder that those who had it to look\r\nforward to half shrank from it. Among them there may have been a\r\nhandful who could scan the unshaped wilderness as the sculptor does\r\nhis block, and body forth in imagination the glory hidden within. That\r\nwhich these may have faintly imagined stands before us palpable if not\r\nyet perfected, the amorphous veil of the shapely figure hewn away,\r\nand the long toil of drill and chisel only in too much danger of being\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nPopulation, the most convenient gauge of national strength and\r\nprogress, is far from being a universally reliable one. We shall find\r\nsometimes as wide a difference between two given millions as between\r\ntwo given individuals. Either may grow without doing much else. They\r\nmay direct their energies to different fields. Compared with the\r\nUnited States, France and Germany, for example, have advanced but\r\nlittle in population. They have, however, done wonders for themselves\r\nand the world by activities which we have, in comparison, neglected.\r\nThe old city of London gains in wealth as it loses in inhabitants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOE'S NEW PERFECTING PRINTING-PRESS, PRINTING 12,000\r\nDOUBLE IMPRESSIONS PER HOUR, AND THE OLD EPHRATA PRESS.]\r\n\r\nYet success in the multiplication of souls within their own\r\nborders--depopulate as they may elsewhere--is eagerly coveted and\r\nregularly measured by all the nations. Since 1790, when we set them\r\nthe example, they have one by one adopted the rule of numbering heads\r\nevery five, six or ten years, recognizing latterly as well, more and\r\nmore, the importance of numbering other things, until men, women and\r\nchildren have come to be embedded in a medley of steam-engines,\r\npigs, newspapers, schools, churches and bolts of calico. For twenty\r\ncenturies this taking of stock by governments had been an obsolete\r\npractice, until revived by the framers of the American Constitution\r\nand made a vital part of that instrument. The right of the most--and\r\nnot of the richest, the best, the bravest, the cleverest, or the\r\noldest in blood--to rule being formally recognized and set down on\r\npaper, it became necessary to ascertain at stated intervals who were\r\nthe most. The lords of the soil, instead of being inducted into power\r\non the death of their parents with great pother of ointment, Te Deum,\r\nheraldry, drum and trumpet, were chosen every ten years by a corps of\r\nhumble knights of the pencil and schedule.\r\n\r\nTo these disposers of empire, the enhancement and complication of\r\nwhose toil has been a labor of love with each decennial Congress, we\r\nowe the knowledge that eighty years, out of the hundred, brought the\r\npeople of the Union up from a tally of 3,929,214 in 1790 to 38,558,371\r\nin 1870, and that down to the beginning of the last decade the rate of\r\nincrement adhered closely to 35 per cent. On that basis of growth the\r\nlatest return falls nearly four millions short. One of the causes of\r\nthis is \"too obvious\" (and too disagreeable) \"to mention;\" but it\r\nis inadequate. The sharp demarcation of the western frontier by the\r\ngrasshopper and the hygrometer is another, which will continue to\r\noperate until, by irrigation, tree-planting or some other device, a\r\nnew climate can be manufactured for the Plains. The teeming West, that\r\nof old needed only to be tickled with a hoe to laugh with a harvest,\r\nhas disappeared. At least what is left of it has lost the power of\r\nsuction that was wont to reach across the ocean, pull Ballys and Dorfs\r\nup by the roots and transplant them bodily to the Muskingum and\r\nthe Des Moines. A third cause, operating more especially within\r\nthe current decade, is attributable to another mode in which that\r\nattractive power has been exerted--the absorption from the European\r\npurse for the construction of railways of seven or eight times as much\r\nas the thirty-five millions in specie it took to fight through the\r\nRevolutionary war. For a while, Hans came with his thalers, but they\r\noutfooted him--\"fast and faster\" behind came \"unmerciful disaster,\"\r\nand he was fain to turn his back on the land of promise and promises.\r\nSimilar set-backs, however, are interspersed through our previous\r\nhistory, and the influence of the last one may be over-rated.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the Old World's fund of humanity is not sufficiently ample\r\nto keep up the pace; and the rate of natural increase is no longer\r\nwhat it was when the country was all new, and cornfield and nursery\r\nvied in fecundity. That the former source of augmentation is gaining\r\nin proportion upon the latter is apparent from the last three returns.\r\nThe ratio of foreign-born inhabitants to the aggregate in 1850 was\r\n9.68 per cent. in 1860, 13.16, and in 1870, 14.44. In the last-named\r\nyear, moreover, 10,892,015, or 28 per cent. of the entire population,\r\nwhite and black, are credited with foreign parentage on one or both\r\nsides. Excluding the colored element, ranked as all native, this\r\nproportion rises to 32 per cent.\r\n\r\nJudged by the test of language, three-fifths of those who are of\r\nforeign birth disappear from the roll of foreigners, 3,119,705 out\r\nof 5,567,229 having come from the British Isles and British America.\r\nGermany, including Bohemia, Holland and Switzerland, sums up\r\n1,883,285; Scandinavia, 241,685; and France and Belgium, 128,955. The\r\nCeltic influx from Ireland, and the Teutonic and Norse together, form\r\ntwo currents of almost identical volume. Compared with either,\r\nthe contribution of the Latin or the Romance races sinks into\r\ninsignificance--an insignificance, however, that shows itself chiefly\r\nin numbers, the traces of their character and influence being,\r\nrelatively to their numerical strength, marked. The immigrants from\r\nNorthern and Southern Europe have a disposition, in choosing their\r\nnew homes, to follow latitude, or rather the isotherms; the North-men\r\nskirting the Canadian frontier and grouping themselves on the coldest\r\nside of Lake Michigan, while the Italians, Spaniards and French drift\r\ntoward the Gulf States. The Irish and Germans are more cosmopolitan,\r\neach in a like degree. They disperse with less regard to climate or\r\nsurroundings, and are more rapidly and imperceptibly absorbed and\r\nblended, thus promoting rather than marring the homogeneity of the\r\nAmerican people. The Germans are, however, more prone to colonizing\r\nthan the Irish--a circumstance due in great measure to their differing\r\nin language from the mass of their new neighbors. This cause of\r\nisolation is gradually losing its weight, the recognition of the\r\nGerman tongue by State legislatures, municipalities, etc. being less\r\ncommon than formerly, notwithstanding the immense immigratior so\r\ncalculated to extend it.\r\n\r\nWhile assimilation has been growing more complete, and a fixed\r\nresultant becoming more discernible, the ingredients of this ethnic\r\nmedley do not seem to have materially varied in their proportions\r\nsince the beginning of the century. They present a tolerably close\r\nparallel to the like process in Northern France, where Celt and Teuton\r\ncombined in nearly equal numbers, with, as in our case, a limited\r\nlocal infusion of the Norse. The result cannot, however, be identical,\r\nthe French lacking our Anglo-Saxon substratum, with its valuable\r\ntraditions and habitudes of political thought. The balance between\r\nimpulse and conservatism has never been, in this country, long or\r\nseriously disturbed, and is probably as sound now as a hundred\r\nyears ago. In the discussions of the twenty years which embrace our\r\nRevolutionary period we find abundance of theory, but they were never\r\ncarried by abstractions out of sight of the practical. Our publicists\r\nwere not misled by convictions of the \"infinite perfectibility of\r\nthe human mind,\" the motive proclaimed by Condorcet, writing in sweet\r\nobliviousness of the guillotine, as explaining \"how much more pure,\r\naccurate and profound are the principles upon which the constitution\r\nand laws of France have been formed than those which directed the\r\nAmericans.\" The lack of this equilibrium among the pure, and, as we\r\nmay venture to term them, the untrained races, we have occasional\r\nopportunities of noting on our own soil when for a passing cause they\r\nresort to isolated action.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CITY OF TOKYO, THE LARGEST STEAMSHIP BUILT IN\r\nAMERICA, AND FITCH'S STEAMBOAT, THE FIRST CONSTRUCTED.]\r\n\r\nA race-question of a character that cannot be supplied by\r\ndifferentiation within Caucasian limits haunts us as it has done from\r\nthe very birth of the colonies. Like the Wild Huntsman, we have had\r\nthe sable spectre close beside us through the whole run. But, more\r\nfortunate than he, we see it begin to fade. At least its outlines are\r\ncontracting. The ratio of colored inhabitants to the aggregate,\r\nin 1790 19.26 per cent., or one-fifth, fell in 1860 to 14.12, or\r\none-seventh, and in 1870 to 12.65, or an eighth. The next census will\r\nbeyond doubt point more strongly in the same direction. If, whilst\r\ndwindling in magnitude, the dusky shape perplex us by assuming\r\nsuddenly a novel form, we may yet be assured that it is the same in\r\nsubstance and in manageability. Its hue is whitening with the fleece\r\nof five millions of cotton bales. The cloud has a silver lining--a\r\ngolden one in fact--for ours is pecuniarily a serviceable phantom to\r\nthe extent of adding to our annual income a sum equal to eight or ten\r\ntimes the entire yearly export of the colonies. Should he lead us,\r\nlike the Land--und--Wild--Graf, into the pit of ruin, he will have\r\nfirst bottomed it with an ample and soft cushion of lint whereon to\r\nfall.\r\n\r\nExtremes meet, and modern culture, like ancient anarchy, drives its\r\npeople into cities. Such is the tendency on both sides of the ocean.\r\nImprovement must result from associated effort, and of that cities are\r\nthe last expression. All the European towns are outgrowing the rural\r\ndistricts. With us the change states itself in an advance, since 1790,\r\nof the city population from 3.4 to 20.9 per cent. of the aggregate.\r\nBroadcloth has gained on homespun in the proportion of six to one,\r\nGiles having thus six mouths to fill where he formerly had but one.\r\nWe shall show farther on how gallantly he meets this draft. New York,\r\nwith its suburbs, contains more Germans than any German city save\r\nVienna and Berlin, more Irish than Dublin, and more English-speaking\r\ninhabitants than Liverpool, Birmingham, Manchester, Bristol and\r\nLeeds together. All the colonial towns in a lump would scarce add a\r\ntwentieth to her numbers, and her militia embraces nearly twice as\r\nmany men as served, first and last, in the Continental army.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COTTON GIN.]\r\n\r\nBut the column that sums the souls does not state the complete life of\r\nthe cities. Man has in our day a host of allies that work with him and\r\nat his command--slaves of iron, steel and brass wholly unknown to our\r\ngreat--grand-fathers--fed also by the farmer, through the miner as an\r\nintermediate. Steam-engines, to the number of 40,191, and of 1,215,711\r\nhorse-power--all of the stationary variety, and exclusive of nearly\r\nhalf as many that traverse the country and may be classed among the\r\nrural population--have succeeded the websters and spinners who were\r\nwont to clothe all the world and his wife, and who survive only in\r\nthe surnames of some of our statesmen and financiers. Not that they\r\nconfine their labors to textile fabrics. Their iron fingers are in\r\nevery pie, including that of the printer, who is answered, when he\r\ncalls the roll of his serfs of steam, by 691 whistles. And he is\r\none of the smallest of the slaveholders--a mere ten-bale man.\r\nIndia-rubber, a product known a century ago only by some little black\r\nlumps used by draughtsmen to erase pencil-marks, owns enough of them\r\nto equal 4412 horses or 22,000 No. 1 field hands. Boots and shoes not\r\nof the India-rubber variety employ 3212 horse-power or 15,000 steam\r\nCrispins, over and above their Christian fellows who stick solitary\r\nto the last, and who, it must be owned, produce an article more of the\r\nRevolutionary type and more solid and durable. As a cord-wainer Steam\r\nis a failure; but he works cheaply, and will continue to hammer on,\r\nand disseminate his commodity of brown paper throughout the temperate\r\nzone. Three-fourths of the population of the globe still runs unshod,\r\nhowever, and it is obvious that this crying want cannot be met by\r\nthe old system. Steam will perforce keep pegging away till Cathay,\r\nXipangu, India and all the isles awaken to the absurdity of walking on\r\ncotton or undressed human skin. Could one of our 299 fire-fed cobblers\r\nhave been set to work at Valley Forge, backed by one of the 1057\r\nmakers of woolen that are similarly nourished!\r\n\r\nBut we do Mr. Watt's lusty bantling injustice in assigning him\r\nexclusively the tastes of a cit. He is not insensible to pastoral\r\ncharms, and often selects a home among the hemlocks and under the\r\nbroad-armed oaks, by bosky glen or open mead, wherever the brooklet\r\nbrawls or dreams, for he sticks to the waterside like a beaver. Here\r\nhe sits down, like an artist as he is, until he has got all the choice\r\nbits of the grove. The large and bustling family of the sawyers, both\r\ntop and bottom, he has utterly banished from their ancient haunts.\r\n'There would be needed a million and a half of them to take the places\r\nof 11,199 steam-engines, of 314,774 horse-power, that are devastating\r\nour forests. An equal number is replaced by the 16,559 water-wheels,\r\nof 326,728 horse-power, engaged in the same field of havoc. Armed\r\nwith the handsaw, all the Revolutionary patriots and Tories together,\r\nwithdrawing their attention entirely from military affairs, as well as\r\nfrom all other mundane concerns, would not have turned out one-sixth\r\nof the quantity of lumber demanded by their descendants of a period\r\nthat boasts itself the age of iron, and has as little as possible\r\nto do with wood. And if we place in the hands of the patriarchs the\r\nancestral axes, and tell them to get out charcoal for three millions\r\nof tons of iron, to be hauled an average of a hundred miles to\r\nmarket by oxen over roads whose highest type was the corduroy, the\r\nimagination reels at the helplessness of the heroes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAIN ELEVATOR.]\r\n\r\nThe paternal thoughtfulness of the home government employed itself in\r\nrelieving the colonist from such exhausting drafts upon his energies.\r\nIt sedulously prohibited his throwing himself away on the manufacture\r\nof iron or anything else. In 1750 it placed him under a penalty of\r\n£200 for erecting a rolling-mill, tilt-hammer or steel-furnace. Lest\r\nthe governor of the colony should fail to enforce this statute\r\nand protect the pioneer from such a waste of time, it held that\r\nfunctionary to a personal forfeit of £500 for failing, within thirty\r\ndays after presentment by two witnesses on oath, to abate as a\r\nnuisance every such mill, engine, etc. As this mulct would have made a\r\nserious inroad on the emoluments of the royal governors, even with the\r\naddition of the inaugural douceur customarily given by the provincial\r\nassemblies to each new incumbent--in Virginia regularly £500, doubled\r\nin the instance of Fauquier in 1758, when it was desired to drive\r\nthe entering wedge of disestablishment and razee the parsons--we are\r\nprepared to believe that the iron business was not flourishing. Under\r\na despotism tempered so very moderately by bribes, a similar blight\r\nfell upon all other branches of manufacture. Among these, wool, flax,\r\npaper, hats and leather are specified in a Parliamentary report as\r\ninterfering with \"the trade, navigation and manufactures\" of\r\nthe mother-country. An act of Parliament accordingly forbade the\r\nexportation of hats to foreign countries, and even from one colony to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThat, after such a course of repression, the country found itself\r\nwholly unprepared on the attainment of independence to make any\r\nheadway in this field, is no matter of surprise. Thirty years elapsed\r\nbefore the manufacturing statistics of the Union became presentable.\r\nIn 1810 they were reckoned at $198,613,471. This embraces every fruit\r\nof handicraft, from a barrel of flour and a bushel of lime to a silk\r\ndress. We had 122,647 spindles and 325,392 looms, made 53,908 tons of\r\npig iron, and refined about one pound of sugar for each head of the\r\npopulation. In 1870, after sixty years of tossing between the\r\nScylla and Charybdis of tariffs, \"black\" and white, the yield of our\r\nfactories had mounted to the respectable sum of $4,232,325,442. They\r\nemployed 2,053,996 operatives. Of these, the average wages were $377,\r\nagainst $289 in 1860 and $247 in 1850, yearly. The advance in the\r\nproduct of refined sugar may be cited as illustrative of the progress\r\nof the people in comfort and luxury. It reached a value of one hundred\r\nand nine millions, representing nearly ten times as many pounds, or\r\ntwenty-eight pounds a head. This exemplification is but one in an\r\nendless list.\r\n\r\nManufactures have come to figure respectably in our exports. They\r\nexceed in that list, by three or four to one, the entire exports of\r\nall kinds in 1790; and they equal the average aggregate of the years\r\nfrom 1815 to 1824. But the multiplication of the wants of a people\r\nrapidly growing in numbers and refinement will, with the comparatively\r\nhigh price of labor, scarcity of capital and distance of most of our\r\nports from the markets supplied by European manufactures, for a long\r\ntime to come make the home-supply the chief care of our artisans. They\r\nhave, for such and other reasons, in some points lost ground of\r\nlate. The revolution in the propulsion and construction of ships, for\r\ninstance, has not found them prepared to take the advantage they have\r\nusually done of improvements. Not only do the British screw-steamers\r\ntake undisputed possession of our trade with their own country, but\r\nthey expel our once unrivaled craft from the harbors of other quarters\r\nof the globe, and threaten to monopolize the most profitable part\r\nof our carrying-trade with all countries. This result is more easily\r\nexplained than the inroads made on our more ordinary foreign traffic,\r\nin sailing vessels, by the mercantile marine of second- and third-rate\r\npowers. This is eloquently told by the annual government returns and\r\nthe daily shipping-list. While our coastwise tonnage increases, that\r\nemployed in foreign trade remains stationary or declines. The bearing\r\nof this upon our naval future becomes an imperative question for\r\nour merchants and legislators. The United States is benevolently and\r\ngratuitously building up a marine for each of half a dozen European\r\nstates which possess little or no commerce of their own, and\r\nmultiplying the ships and sailors of our chief maritime rival. We have\r\nlong since ceased to import locomotives, and have, within the past two\r\nyears, almost ceased to import railroad iron. Our iron-workers obtain\r\ncoal at nearly or quite as low prices as do those of Birkenhead or the\r\nClyde. They have recently sent to sea some large screw-steamers that\r\nperform well. No insurmountable difficulty appears to prevent the\r\nlaunching of more until we have enough to serve at least our direct\r\ntrade with Europe and China. That determined, it may be possible\r\nto ascertain whether we cannot assist Norway, Belgium and Sicily in\r\ncarrying our cotton, wheat and tobacco to the purchasers of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF A POSTAL CAR.]\r\n\r\nThis decline in American tonnage is, it must be added, only relative,\r\nwhether the comparison be made with other countries or with our own\r\npast. The returns show a carrying capacity in our ships more than\r\ntwentyfold that of 1789, and three times that of 1807; when, on the\r\nother hand, it exceeded in the ratio of fourteen to twelve that of\r\n1829, twenty-two years later. This interest is peculiarly subject to\r\nfluctuations; some of which in the past have been less explicable than\r\nthe one it is now undergoing. Another decade may turn the tables, and\r\nrestore the flag of the old Liverpool liners to their fleeter but less\r\nshapely supplanters. The steamer and the clipper are both American\r\ninventions. Why not their combination ours as well? The centenary of\r\nRumsey's boat, not due till December 11, 1887, should not find its\r\ndescendants lording the ocean under another flag.\r\n\r\nThe monthly Falmouth packet of a century ago, sufficient till within\r\nthe past two generations for the mail communication of the two\r\ncontinents, has grown into six or eight steamships weekly, each\r\ncapable of carrying a pair of the old sloops in her hold, and making\r\nthe passage westwardly in a fifth and eastwardly in a third of the\r\ntime. Can it be but ninety years ago that the latest dates at New\r\nYork (February 14, 1786) from London (December 7, 1785) brought as a\r\nleading item from Paris (November 20) the news that Philippe Égalité\r\nhad by his father's death just come into four millions of livres a\r\nyear, that six hundred thousand livres paid by the Crown to his father\r\nthereupon devolved to Monsieur (afterward Louis XVIII.), and that the\r\nlatter had kept up the game of shuttlecock with the treasure of the\r\nFrench by \"a donation of all his estates to the duke of Normandy, the\r\nyounger son of their Majesties, preserving for himself the use and\r\nprofits thereof during his life\"? That was a short winter-passage,\r\ntoo--more speedy than the land-trip of a letter in the same journal\r\n\"from a gentleman in the Western country to his friend in Connecticut,\r\ndated River Muskingum, November 5, 1785,\" describing a voyage down the\r\nOhio from Fort Pitt and the wonders of the country much as Livingstone\r\nand Du Chaillu do those of Africa. The time is less now to Japan, and\r\nabout the same to New South Wales, with both which countries we have\r\npostal conventions-i.e., a practically consolidated service--far\r\ncheaper and more convenient than that maintained on the adoption of\r\nthe present Constitution between our own cities. Our foreign service\r\nwith leading countries is combined, moreover, with an institution\r\nundreamed of in that day--the money-order system. Under this admirable\r\ncontrivance the post-offices of the world will ere long be so many\r\nbanks of deposit and exchange for the benefit of the masses, effecting\r\ntransfers mutually with much greater facility, rapidity and security\r\nthan the regular banks formerly attained.\r\n\r\nStill in its infancy, the international money-order system has already\r\nreached importance in the magnitude of its operations. The sums sent\r\nby means of it were, in 1874, $1,499,320 to Great Britain, $701,634 to\r\nGermany, and to the little inland republic of Switzerland $72.287.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions to which this new method of financial intercourse\r\nbetween the different peoples of the globe is destined to reach may be\r\ninferred from the growth of the domestic money--order service. In 1874\r\nthe number of orders issued was 4,620,633, representing $74,424,854.\r\nThe erroneous payments having been but one in 59,677, it is plain that\r\nthis mode of remittance must make further inroads on the old routine\r\nof cheque and draft, and become, among its other advantages, a\r\ncurrency regulator of no trifling value.\r\n\r\nOur post-office may almost be said to head the development of the\r\ncentury. The other lines of progress in some sense converge to it. The\r\nadvance of intelligence, of settlement, of transit by land and water\r\nand of mechanical and philosophical discovery have all fostered\r\nthe post, while its return to them has been liberal. Thus aided\r\nand spurred, its extension has approached the rate of geometrical\r\nprogression. Its development resembles that from the Annelids to the\r\nVertebrata, the simple canal which constitutes the internal anatomy of\r\nthe simplest animal forms finding a counterpart in the line of mails\r\nvouchsafed by the British postmaster-general to the colonies in 1775\r\nfrom Falmouth to Savannah, \"with as many cross-posts as he shall\r\nsee fit.\" Fifteen years of independence had caused the accretion\r\nof wonderfully few ganglia on this primeval structure. In 1790 four\r\nmillions of inhabitants possessed but seventy-five post-offices\r\nand 1875 miles of post-roads. The revenue of the department was\r\n$37,935--little over a thousandth of what it is at present under rates\r\nof postage but a fraction of the old. New York and Boston heard\r\nfrom each other three times a week in summer and twice in winter.\r\nPhiladelphia and New York were more social and luxurious, and insisted\r\non a mail every week-day but one, hurrying it through in two days each\r\nway, or a twentieth of the present speed. On the interior routes chaos\r\nruled supreme. Newspapers and business-men combined to employ riders\r\nwho meandered along the mud roads as it pleased Heaven.\r\n\r\nWhen the new government machine had smoothed down its bearings matters\r\nrapidly improved. In 1800 we had 903 post-offices and 20,817 miles of\r\nroad. In 1820 these figures changed to 4500 and 92,492, and in 1870\r\nto 28,492 offices and 231,232 miles. Five years later 70,083 miles of\r\nrailway, 15,788 by steamboat and 192,002 of other routes represented\r\nthe web woven since the Falmouth and Savannah shuttle commenced its\r\nweary way. Of course, neither the number of offices nor extent of\r\nroutes fully measures the change from past to present; mails having\r\nbecome more frequent over the same route, and a new style of office,\r\nthe locomotive variety, having been added to the old. This innovation,\r\nof mounting postmaster and post-office with the mailbags on wheels,\r\nand hurling the whole through space at thirty or forty miles an hour,\r\nalready furnishes us with gigantic statistics. In 1875 there were\r\nsixty-two lines of railway postal-cars covering 16,932 miles with\r\n40,109 miles of daily service and 901 peripatetic clerks. These\r\ngentlemen, under the demands of the fast mail-trains, will ere long\r\nswell from a regiment into a brigade, and so into a division, till\r\npoets and painters be called on to drop the theme of \"waiting for the\r\nmail.\"\r\n\r\nThe greater portion of the fifty-odd thousand employés of the\r\ndepartment do not give it their whole time, many of the country\r\npostmasters being engaged in other business. But the undivided efforts\r\nof them all, with an auxiliary corps, would be demanded for the\r\nhandling of eight hundred and fifty millions of letters and cards,\r\nand a greater bulk of other mail-matter, under the old plan of\r\nrates varying according to distance and number of sheets, and not\r\nweight--stamps unknown. The introduction of stamps, with coincident\r\nreduction and unification of rates, has been the chief factor in the\r\nextraordinary increase of correspondence within the past thirty years;\r\nthe number of letters passing through the mails having within that\r\nperiod multiplied twenty-fold. The number transmitted in the British\r\nIslands, then three times greater than in the United States, is\r\nnow but little in excess, having been in 1874 nine hundred and\r\nsixty--seven millions. The immense difference between the two\r\ncountries in extent, and consequently in the average distance of\r\ntransportation, is enough to account for the contrast between the two\r\nbalance-sheets, our department showing a heavy annual deficit, while\r\nin Great Britain this is replaced by a profit. As regards post-office\r\nprogress in the United States, the question is rather an abstract one;\r\nfor there is not the least probability of an advance in rates. The\r\ndiscrepancy between receipts and expenses will be attacked rather\r\nby seeking to reduce the latter at the same time that the former\r\nare enhanced by natural growth and by improvement in the details of\r\nservice and administration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROF. S.F.B. MORSE, THE INVENTOR OF THE\r\nELECTRO-MAGNETIC TELEGRAPH.]\r\n\r\nDifficult as it is adequately to state or to measure the extension of\r\nthe mails within the century, it is far from telling the whole\r\nstory of the amplitude and celerity with which the people of our day\r\ninterchange intelligence.\r\n\r\nOnly to the last third of the period under review has the electric\r\ntelegraph been known. It is now a necessity of the public and private\r\nlife of every civilized spot upon the globe. It traverses all lands\r\nand all seas. The forty miles of wire with which it started from\r\nWashington City have become many millions. Its length of line in the\r\nUnited States is about the same with that of the mail-routes, and a\r\nsimilar equality probably obtains in other parts of the world. We have\r\nnearly as much line as all Europe together, though the extent of wire\r\nmay not be so great. It is little to say that this continent, so\r\ndim to the founders of the Union, has been by the invention of Morse\r\ncompressed within whispering distance, the same advantage having been\r\nconferred on other countries. It is the property of mankind, and\r\nthe comparison must be between present and past, not between any two\r\ncountries of the present. Strictly, a comparison is not possible,\r\nnothing like magnetic communication having been known forty years\r\nago, unless to the half imagination, half realization of one or two\r\nscientific experimenters. Steam and stamps wrought a difference in\r\ndegree--the telegraph one of kind. Against eighteen hundred miles of\r\nwagon-road we set seventy-three thousand of railway; but two hundred\r\nthousand miles of telegraph are opposed by nothing, unless by\r\nFranklin's kite-string. Looked at along the perspective of poles, the\r\nold days disappear entirely--the patriots become pre-historic. Yet\r\nmodern self-conceit is somewhat checked by the reflection that the\r\ncareer of these two great agents of intercommunication has but just\r\nopened; that their management even yet remains a puzzle to us; and\r\nthat the next generation may wonder how we happened to get hold of\r\nimplements whose use and capabilities we so poorly comprehended.\r\nSo far as prediction can now be ventured, a force and pathway more\r\neconomical than coal and the rail will not soon be forthcoming; nor\r\nis Canton apt to \"interview\" New York at the rate of more words in a\r\nminute over a single wire than she can now. Some day dynamite may be\r\nharnessed to the balloon, which stands, or drifts, where it did with\r\nMontgolfier, and we may all become long-range projectiles; but even\r\nthis age of hurry will contentedly wait a little for that.\r\n\r\nPossibly the Post-office Department would be less of a valetudinarian,\r\nfinancially, had it confined itself to its legitimate occupation, the\r\nspeeding of intercourse and wafting of sighs, and not yielded to the\r\nheavy temptation of disseminating shoes, pistols and *garden-seeds\r\nover three millions of square miles. Newspapers are enough to test its\r\npowers as a freight-agent. Where these and their literary kindred\r\nof books, magazines, etc. used to be estimated by the dozen and the\r\nounce, the ton is becoming too small a unit.\r\n\r\nWest of the Blue Ridge, or the front line of the Alleghany, so called\r\nin most of its length, there was not a newspaper published in\r\n1776. Ten years later, scarcely more than one--the _Pittsburg\r\nGazette_--existed west of the mountains. The few in the seaboard\r\ntowns kept alive the name, and little more. In 1850, '60 and '70 the\r\nperiodicals of the Union numbered, respectively, 2526, 4051 and 5871,\r\nwith an average circulation, at the three periods, of twenty-one\r\nhundred, thirty-four hundred and thirty-six hundred copies each. The\r\ncirculation thus outgrew the numbers in the proportion of nearly\r\ntwo to one. And both are largely in excess of the increase of the\r\npopulation, that being in the twenty years but 65 percent. The number\r\nof daily papers (254 in 1850 and 574 in 1870) must now be equal to the\r\nentire number of periodicals in France outside of Paris (796 in 1875),\r\nwith an average issue less than half that of ours. The proportion of\r\nreaders to the population, certainly in this class of literature, thus\r\nappears to be rapidly growing: and the change is most striking if we\r\ntake, for example, that group of periodicals which are most purely\r\nliterary and most remote from the mere chronicle. The returns for\r\nthe three periods place the monthlies at, respectively, 100, 280 and\r\n622--an advance of sixfold.\r\n\r\nThe magazine leads us to the door of the library; and here the exhibit\r\nis still more marked, significant and gratifying. The census figures\r\nare, for many reasons, extremely confused, but in the general result\r\nthey cannot be outrageously wrong, and they can mislead us only in\r\ndegree as to the immense multiplication of books in both public and\r\nprivate libraries. The returns are manifestly far below the truth.\r\nTo give them here without the explanations accompanying them in\r\nthe census volumes would mislead; and those explanations, or a fair\r\nsynopsis of them, would occupy too much space, and would, after all,\r\nleave the problem unsolved. That the supply of books has fully\r\nkept pace with every other means of culture is patent enough. The\r\nCongressional Library has risen in half the century from the shelves\r\nof a closet to nearly four hundred thousand volumes--an accumulation\r\nnot surpassed in '76 by more than two libraries in Europe. It now\r\ndemands a separate edifice of its own, fit to stand by the side of\r\nthe fine structures which have within a generation recreated the\r\narchitectural aspect of the Federal metropolis with the most stately\r\ngovernment-offices in the world. Other public libraries, belonging to\r\ncolleges, schools, societies and independent endowments, show similar\r\nprogress. While none of them are equal, for reference, to some of the\r\ngreat European establishments, they are generally better adapted to\r\nthe purposes of popular instruction. Their literary wealth is fresh\r\nand available, little encumbered by lumber kept merely because old or\r\ncurious. Thus adjuncts, in some sort, of the newspaper and the common\r\nschool, their catalogues prove, as do the bookcases of private houses,\r\nthat the newest and deepest results of European thought and inquiry\r\nare eagerly sought and used by our people.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SCHOOL-HOUSE OF THE PAST AND THE PRESENT.]\r\n\r\nOur system of public schools, long classed among the \"peculiar\r\ninstitutions\" of the country, is notably gaining in scope and\r\nefficiency, be the English and Prussians right or not in their claim\r\nof greater thoroughness and a higher curriculum. The different States\r\nhave engaged in a series of competitive experiments for the common\r\ngood, and cities and counties, in their sphere, labor to the same end.\r\nSchools of higher grade are being multiplied, and the examination of\r\nteachers, still lax enough, becomes more exact and faithful, as befits\r\nthe drill of an army of two hundred and forty thousand charged with\r\nthe intellectual police of eight millions of children--the number said\r\nby the new \"National Bureau of Education\" to have been enrolled in\r\n1875, against 7,209,938, 5,477,037 and 3,642,694 by the censuses of\r\n1870, '60 and '50. Little more than half this number is estimated by\r\nthe Bureau to represent the average daily attendance, which is\r\nquite compatible with the attendance, for the greater part of the\r\nschool-year, of nine-tenths of the whole number on the lists. A\r\ncomparison of the number enrolled and the entire supposed number\r\nof children between six and sixteen leaves an excess of nearly two\r\nmillions and a half outside the public schools. Of these private\r\nschools will account, and account well, for a large proportion.\r\nThese are fulfilling indispensable offices, one being that of normal\r\nschools--a want likely to be inadequately satisfied for a long time to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nIn one respect our public schools are beyond, though not above,\r\ncomparison with those of the most advanced European states. An annual\r\noutlay of a trifle less than seventy-five millions of dollars, with\r\nan investment in buildings, ground, etc. of a hundred and sixty-six\r\nmillions, implies a determination that should be rewarded with the\r\nmost unexceptionable results. It reaches eighteen dollars yearly,\r\nleaving out the interest on the fixed stock, for each child in\r\ndaily attendance. Such an expenditure, trebling, we believe, that\r\nof Prussia, ought to secure better teachers and a higher range\r\nof instruction. It must be said, however, that the duties of the\r\nschool-boards are as honestly and economically discharged as those of\r\nany other public bodies; that the cost for each pupil is highest\r\nwhere common schools have been longest established and most thoroughly\r\nstudied; and that the statistics certainly show a steady advance in\r\ntheir efficiency. That is the truest test. Any pecuniary means are\r\njustifiable by the end. If common schools, themselves a means to a\r\nhigher education, mental and moral, than they can directly afford,\r\ntake some part of the wealth we accumulate to prevent our men's\r\ndecaying, it is well used. It helps to purchase for us progress\r\nmore genuine than that whereof railways and cotton-factories are the\r\nexponents.\r\n\r\nIt is thus a guarantee of a brighter century even than the one just\r\nclosed that, in the wildest quarter of the still unkempt continent,\r\nthe school actually precedes the pioneer. Choose his homestead where\r\nhe may, the sixteenth section is staked out before it. From it the\r\nrills of knowledge soon trickle along the first furrows, as strange\r\nto the soil as its new products. It provides the modern settler\r\nin advance with an equipment, mental and material, if not moral,\r\naltogether superior to that of his colonial prototype, that enables\r\nhim in a shorter time to impart a higher stamp to his surroundings. He\r\nattacks the prairie with a plough unimagined by his predecessor;\r\ncuts his wheat with a cradle--or, given a neighbor or two, a\r\nreaper--instead of a sickle; sends into the boundless pasture the\r\nnucleus of a merino flock, and returns at evening to a home rugged\r\nenough, in unison with its surroundings, but brightened by traits of\r\nculture and intelligence which must adhere to any ménage of to-day\r\nand were out of reach of any of the olden time. The civilization that\r\ntravels West now is a different thing from that which went West a\r\nhundred years ago.\r\n\r\nScience has done much for the farmer, though not as much as he has\r\ndone for it and its hotbeds, the towns. In one point his shortcomings\r\nare notable. He has not learned how to eat his cake and have it. He\r\nworks the virgin soil as the miner does the coal-seam. What Nature has\r\nplaced in it he takes out, and, until forced by the pressure of\r\nhis friends and enemies, the cities, returns no nest-egg of future\r\nfertility. So it is that many portions of the rural East have to\r\nbe resettled and started afresh in the process of agricultural\r\nredemption. A hundred years ago England grew fifteen bushels of wheat\r\nto the acre. Her standard is now thirty-two. Within three-quarters of\r\nthe century New York has fallen from twenty-five to twelve; and\r\nhalf that period, again, has brought Ohio and Indiana from thirty to\r\nfifteen. But this process is a natural part of the sum of American\r\nprogress. Land was the only property of the country originally, and\r\nsubsequently of different parts of it in succession. It was used like\r\nany other commodity, and worn out like leather or cloth. The original\r\ncuticle of the continent has disappeared for ever. The task, now is\r\nto induce the granulation of a new one. The restorative process may\r\nbe complete by the time we have four hundred souls to the square\r\nmile, like England and Flanders. Meanwhile, the exporting of Iowa and\r\nCalifornia in the shape of wheat is going on at what must be esteemed\r\na profitable rate; for our farmers, as a class, do not seem to be\r\nlosing ground. Their glebes have risen in value from thirty-two\r\nhundred millions in 1850 to sixty-six hundred ten years later,\r\nand ninety-three hundred in 1870. This has been accompanied by a\r\ndiminution of their average extent, the farm of 1870 covering a\r\nhundred and fifty-three acres. This is small enough, considering\r\nthe capital necessary for stock in these days of improved and costly\r\nimplements, when a farmer can no longer pack his entire kit in a cart.\r\nIt matches closely the size of English holdings, where agricultural\r\nscience is at its height. The French peasant-farmers, with their plats\r\nof three and four acres, are chained to the spade and hoe, and their\r\nsteading becomes a poultry-yard--a consummation we are not yet in\r\nsight of, as is proved by the legions of pigs and beeves, barreled\r\nor bellowing, that roll in from the ancient realms of Pontiac and\r\nthe Prophet with a smoothness and velocity unattained by the most\r\nluxurious coach that carried a First Congressman.\r\n\r\nEverything that makes a nation, we are told, and the nation itself,\r\nis the product of the soil. But the less immediate, finer and\r\nmost delicate fruits cannot usually be garnered until the soil is\r\nthoroughly subdued. The mass of matter keeps the intellectual in\r\nabeyance. Were Europe enlarged one-half, and her population reduced\r\nto one-eighth what it actually is, the spectacle of culture she now\r\npresents would be an impossibility. It is our merit that, thus brought\r\nto American conditions, she would in no way compare with American\r\nachievement. An offset wherewith we must at the same time be debited\r\nis the aid we have, in so many forms, derived from her. Making every\r\nallowance for this, it is a clear credit in our favor that one-tenth\r\nof Christendom should have done so much more than a tenth of its\r\neffective thinking simultaneously with taming the most savage half\r\nof its domain. We have more than our share of laborers in the mental\r\nvineyard, though fewer of them are master-workmen. We utilize for\r\nEurope herself, and send back to her in its first available shape,\r\nmuch of what her students produce. As between thought and substance,\r\nthe two continents interchange offices. We import the crude material\r\nher philosophers harvest or mine, work it up and return it, just as\r\nshe takes the yield of our non-metaphorical fields and strata and\r\nrestores it manufactured. Much of the social, political and industrial\r\nadvancement of Europe within the century she may be said to owe to\r\nthe United States. Her governmental reforms certainly and confessedly\r\nfound here their germ. These gave birth to others of a social\r\ncharacter. In this manner, as well as more directly by our commerce,\r\ninventions and example, we have stimulated her industry. We have\r\nspread before her the two oceans, and taught her to traverse them with\r\na firm and masterful mien, no longer\r\n\r\n  As one who in a lonely road doth walk in fear and dread.\r\n\r\nWe have created cities upon her havens, Parliaments in her capitals,\r\nand stronger hearts and quicker hands in her villages. No community on\r\nher varied surface but is the better for America. That our people and\r\ntheir labors have done it all it would be absurd to say; but the Old\r\nWorld's progress in the period under review can be but very partially\r\naccounted for by any internal force of its own. None of its rulers or\r\npeoples adventure a reform of any kind without a preliminary, if often\r\nonly a half-conscious, glance of inquiry westward. Collectively as\r\nmembers of a European republic of nations, and internally each\r\nwithin itself, they have in this way learned, after many recalcitrant\r\nstruggles, to recognize and respect local independence. Municipal law\r\nhas gained new life. The commune has become an entity everywhere, and\r\nthe nations which it informs have established the right to readjust or\r\nrecast their constitutions without being hounded down as disturbers\r\nof the peace. The contribution of the American Union to such results\r\nwould earn it honor at the hands of history were it to sink into\r\nnothing to-morrow. Had no such tangible fruits hitherto ripened, some\r\nportion of such honor would still accrue to it for having shown that a\r\npeople may grow from a handful to an empire without hereditary rulers,\r\nwithout a privileged class, without a state Church, without a standing\r\narmy, without tumult in the largest cities and without stagnant\r\nsavagery in the remotest wilds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUP THE THAMES.\r\n\r\nCONCLUDING PAPER.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WINDSOR CASTLE, FROM ETON.]\r\n\r\nLet our demonstration to-day be on the monarchical citadel of England,\r\nthe core and nucleus of her kingly associations, her architectural\r\n_eikon basiliké_, Windsor. To reach the famous castle it will not do\r\nto lounge along the river. We must cut loose from the suburbs of the\r\nsuburbs, and launch into a more extended flight. Our destination\r\nis nearly an hour distant by rail; and though it does not take us\r\naltogether out of sight of the city, it leads us among real farms and\r\ngenuine villages, tilled and inhabited as they have been since the\r\nPlantagenets, instead of market-gardens and villas.\r\n\r\nWe go to Paddington and try the Great Western, the parent of the broad\r\ngauges with no very numerous family, Erie being one of its unfortunate\r\nchildren. That six-foot infant is not up to the horizontal stature of\r\nits seven-foot progenitor, but has still sixteen inches too many\r\nto fare well in the contest with its little, active, and above all\r\nnumerous, foes of the four-feet-eight-and-a-half-inch \"persuasion.\"\r\nThe English and the American giants can sympathize with each other.\r\nBoth have drained the bitter cup that is tendered by a strong majority\r\nto a weak minority. Neither the American nor the British constitution,\r\nwith their whole admirable array of checks and balances, has shielded\r\nthem from this evil. In the battle of the gauges both have gone to\r\nthe wall, and will stay there until they can muster strength enough to\r\nreel over into the ranks of their enemies.\r\n\r\nThis relative debility is, at the same time, more apparent to the\r\nstockholders than to their customers. The superstructure and \"plant\"\r\nof the Erie has lately stood interested inspection from abroad with\r\ngreat credit, and that of the Great Western is unexceptionable. The\r\nvote of travelers may be safely allotted to the broad gauge. They\r\nhave more elbow room. The carriages attain the requisite width without\r\nunpleasantly, not to say dangerously, overhanging the centre of\r\ngravity; and, other things equal, the movement is steadier. Nor is the\r\nfinancial aspect of the question apt to impress gloomily the tourist\r\nas he enters the Paddington station and looks around at its blaze of\r\npolychrome and richness of decoration generally. As the coach doors\r\nare slammed upon you, the guard steps into his \"van,\" the vast\r\ndrivers, taller than your head plus the regulation stove-pipe, slowly\r\nbegin their whirl, and you roll majestically forth through a long\r\nfile of liveried servants of the company, drawn up or in action on the\r\nplatform, the sensation of patronizing a poverty-stricken corporation\r\nis by no means likely to harass you. You cease to realize that the\r\nNapoleon of engineers, Monsieur Brunel, made a disastrous mistake in\r\nthe design of this splendid highway, and that, as some will have it,\r\nit was his Moscow. His error, if one there was, existed only in the\r\nselection of the width of track. Whatever the demerits of the design\r\nin that one particular, the execution is in all above praise. The road\r\nwas his pet. Once finished, it was his delight, as with the breeder of\r\na fine horse, to mount it and try its mettle. Over and again would\r\nhe occupy the footboard between London and Bristol, and rejoice as a\r\nstrong man in running his race at close to seventy miles an hour. He\r\nand Stephenson were capital types of the Gaul and Briton, striving\r\nside by side on the same field, as it will be good for the world that\r\nthey should ever do.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MORTON CHURCH.]\r\n\r\nCombats of another character--in fact, of two other characters--recur\r\nto our reflections as we find that we have shuffled off the coil\r\nof bricks and mortar and are rattling across Wormwood Scrubs. More\r\nfortunate than some who have been there before us, we have no call to\r\nalight. Calls to this ancient field of glory, whether symbolized by\r\nthe gentlemanly pistol or the plebeian fist, have ceased to be in\r\nvogue. Dueling and boxing are both frowned down effectually, one by\r\npublic opinion and the other by the police. It is only of late years\r\nthat they finally succumbed to those twin discouragers; but it seems\r\naltogether improbable that the ordeal by combat in either shape\r\nwill again come to the surface in a land where tilting-spear and\r\nquarter-staff were of old so rife. In France chivalry still asserts,\r\nin a feeble way, the privilege of winking and holding out its iron,\r\nand refuses to be comforted with a suit for damages.\r\n\r\nSouthall, a station or two beyond, suggests sport of a less lethal\r\ncharacter, being an ancient meeting-place for the queen's stag-hounds.\r\nJohn Leach may have collected here some of his studies of Cockney\r\nequestrianism. The sportsmen so dear to his pencil furnished him\r\nwealth of opportunities on their annual concourse at the cart's tail.\r\nThe unloading of the animal, his gathering himself up for a leisurely\r\ncanter across country, the various styles and degrees of horsemanship\r\namong his lumbering followers, and the business-like replacing of\r\nthe quarry in his vehicle, to be hauled away for another day's sport,\r\nserved as the most complete travesty imaginable of the chase. It has\r\nthe compensation of placing a number of worthy men in the saddle at\r\nleast once in the year and compelling them to do some rough riding.\r\nThe English have always made it their boast that they are more at home\r\non horseback than any other European nation, and they claim to have\r\nderived much military advantage from it. Lever's novels would lose\r\nmany of their best situations but for this national accomplishment and\r\nthe astounding development it reaches in his hands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MILTON'S PEAR TREE.]\r\n\r\nTo the left lies the fine park of Osterley, once the seat of the\r\ngreatest of London's merchant princes, Sir Thomas Gresham. An\r\nimprovement proposed by Queen Bess, on a visit to Gresham in 1578,\r\ndoes not speak highly for her taste in design. She remarked that in\r\nher opinion the court in front of the house would look better split up\r\nby a wall. Her host dutifully acceded to the idea, and surprised Her\r\nMajesty next morning by pointing out the wall which he had erected\r\nduring the night, sending to London for masons and material for the\r\npurpose. The conceit was a more ponderous one than that of Raleigh's\r\ncloak--bricks and mortar _versus_ velvet.\r\n\r\nA greater than Gresham succeeded, after the death of his widow, to the\r\noccupancy of Osterley--Chief-justice Coke. His compliment to Elizabeth\r\non the occasion of a similar visit to the same house took the more\r\navailable and acceptable shape of ten or twelve hundred pounds\r\nsterling in jewelry. She had more than a woman's weakness for finery,\r\nand Coke operated upon it very successfully. His gems outlasted\r\nGresham's wall, which has long since disappeared with the court it\r\ndisfigured. In place of both stands a goodly Ionic portico, through\r\nwhich one may pass to a staircase that bears a representation by\r\nRubens of the apotheosis of Mr. Motley's hero, William the Silent. The\r\ngallery offers a collection of other old pictures. Should we, however,\r\ntake time for even a short stop in this vicinity, it would probably be\r\nfor the credit of saying that we walked over Hounslow Heath intact in\r\npurse and person. The gentlemen of the road live only in the classic\r\npages of Ainsworth, Reynolds and, if we may include Sam Weller in such\r\nworshipful company, that bard of \"the bold Tur_pin_.\" Another class\r\nof highwaymen had long before them been also attracted by the fine\r\nmanoeuvring facilities of the heath, beginning with the army of the\r\nCæsars and ending with that of James II. Jonathan Wild and his merry\r\nmen were saints to Kirke and his lambs.\r\n\r\nHurrying on, we skirt one of Pope's outlying manors, in his time the\r\nseat of his friend Bathurst and the haunt of Addison, Prior, Congreve\r\nand Gay, and leave southward, toward the Thames, Horton, the cradle of\r\nMilton. A marble in its ivy-grown church is inscribed to the memory\r\nof his mother, _ob_. 1637. At Horton were composed, or inspired,\r\n_Lycidas, L'Allegro, Il Penseroso, Comus_ and others of his nominally\r\nminor but really sweetest and most enjoyable poems. In this retirement\r\nthe Muse paid him her earliest visits, before he had thrown himself\r\naway on politics or Canaanitish mythology. Peeping in upon his\r\nhandsome young face in its golden setting of blonde curls,\r\n\r\n  Through the sweetbrier or the vine,\r\n  Or the twisted eglantine,\r\n\r\nshe wooed him to better work than reporting the debates of the\r\narchangels or calling the roll of Tophet. Had he confined himself to\r\nthis tenderer field, the world would have been the gainer. He might\r\nnot have \"made the word Miltonic mean sublime,\" but we can spare a\r\nlittle of the sublime to get some more of the beautiful.\r\n\r\nTo reach Milton, however, we have run off of the track badly. His Eden\r\nis no station on the Great Western. We shall balance this southward\r\ndivergence with a corresponding one to the north from Slough, the last\r\nstation ere reaching Windsor. We may give a go-by for the moment to\r\nthe halls of kings, do homage to him who treated them similarly, and\r\npoint, in preference, to where,\r\n\r\n         in many a mouldering heap,\r\n  The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep.\r\n\r\nThey show Gray's tomb in Stoke Pogis church, and his house, West End\r\nCottage, half a mile distant. The ingredients of his _Elegy_--actually\r\nthe greatest, but in his judgment among the least, of his few\r\nworks--exist all around. \"The rugged elm,\" \"the ivy-mantled tower,\"\r\nand \"the yew tree's shade,\" the most specific among the simple\r\n\"properties\" of his little spectacle, are common to so many places\r\nthat there are several competitors for the honor of having furnished\r\nthem. The cocks, ploughmen, herds and owls cannot, of course, at this\r\nlate day be identified. Gray could not have done it himself. He\r\ndrew from general memory, in his closet, and not bit by bit on\r\nhis thumb-nail from chance-met objects as he went along. Had\r\nhis conception and rendering of the theme been due to the direct\r\nimpression upon his mind of its several aspects and constituents,\r\nhe would have more thoroughly appreciated his work. He could not\r\nunderstand its popularity, any more than Campbell could that of _Ye\r\nMariners of England_, which he pronounced \"d----d drum-and-trumpet\r\nverses.\" Gray used to say, \"with a good deal of acrimony,\" that the\r\n_Elegy_ \"owed its popularity entirely to the subject, and the public\r\nwould have received it as well had it been written entirely in prose.\"\r\nHad it been written in prose or in the inventory style of poetry, it\r\nwould have been forgotten long ago, like so much else of that kind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAY.]\r\n\r\nNot far hence is Beaconsfield, which gave a home to Burke and a title\r\nto the wife of Disraeli, the nearest approach to a peerage that the\r\nhaughty Israelite, soured by a life of struggle against peers and\r\ntheir prejudices, would deign to accept. We know it will be objected\r\nto this remark that Disraeli is, and has been for most of his career,\r\nassociated with Toryism. But that was part of his game. A man of\r\nculture, thought and fastidious taste, he would, had he been of the\r\n_sangre azul_, have been the steadiest and sincerest of Conservatives.\r\nPrivilege would have been his gospel. As it is, it has only been his\r\nweapon, to use in fighting for himself. \"The time will come when you\r\nshall listen to me,\" were his words when he was first coughed down.\r\nThe time has come. The most cynical of premiers, he governs England,\r\nand he scorns to take a place among those who ruled her before him.\r\n\r\nExtending our divergence farther west toward \"Cliefden's proud alcove,\r\nthe bower of wanton Shrewsbury and love,\" we find ourselves in a\r\nluxuriant rolling country, rural and slumberous. Cookham parish,\r\nwhich we should traverse, claims quite loudly American kinship on\r\nthe strength of its including an estate once the property of Henry\r\nWashington, who is alleged, without sufficient ground, to have been\r\na relative of the general. But we are within the purlieus of Windsor.\r\nThe round tower has been looking down upon us these many miles, and we\r\ncannot but yield to its magnetism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEACONSFIELD CHURCH.]\r\n\r\nEton, on the north bank, opposite Windsor, and really a continuous\r\ntown with that which nestles close to the castle walls, is on our way\r\nfrom Slough. The red-brick buildings of the school, forming a fine\r\nfoil to the lighter-colored and more elegantly designed chapel, are on\r\nour left, the principal front looking over a garden toward the river\r\nand Windsor Home Park beyond. We become aware of a populace of boys,\r\nthe file-closers of England's nineteenth century worthies, and her\r\ncoming veterans of the twentieth. We may contemplatively view them in\r\nthat light, but it has little place in their reflections. Their ruddy\r\nfaces and somewhat cumbrous forms belong to the animal period of life\r\nthat links together boyhood, colthood and calfhood. Education of the\r\nphysique, consisting chiefly in the indulgence and employment of it in\r\nthe mere demonstration of its superabundant vitality, is a large\r\npart of the curriculum at English schools. The playground and the\r\nstudy-room form no unequal alliance. Rigid as, in some respects, the\r\ndiscipline proper of the school may be, it does not compare with the\r\nseverity of that maintained by the older boys over the younger ones.\r\nThe code of the lesser, and almost independent, republic of the\r\ndormitory and the green is as clear in its terms as that of the\r\nunlimited monarchy of the school-room, and more potent in shaping the\r\ncharacter. The lads train themselves for the battle of the world,\r\nwith some help from the masters. It is a sound system on the whole, if\r\nbased, to appearance, rather too much on the principle of the weaker\r\nto the wall. The tendency of the weaker inevitably is to the wall, and\r\nif he is to contend against it effectively, it will be by finding\r\nout his weakness and being made to feel it at the earliest possible\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOMB OF BURKE.]\r\n\r\nNot on land only, but on the river, whereinto it so gradually blends,\r\ndoes lush young England dissipate. Cricket and football order into\r\nviolent action both pairs of extremities, while the upper pair and the\r\norgans of the thorax labor profitably at the oar. The Thames, in its\r\nthree bends from Senly Hall, the Benny Havens of Eton, down to Datchet\r\nMead, where Falstaff overflowed the buck-basket, belongs to the boys.\r\nIn this space it is split into an archipelago of aits. In and out of\r\nthe gleaming paths and avenues of silvery water that wind between them\r\nglide the little boats. The young Britons take to the element like\r\nyoung ducks. Many a \"tall admiral\" has commenced his \"march over the\r\nmountain wave\" among these water-lilies and hedges of osier.\r\n\r\nShall we leave the boys at play, and, renewing our youth, go\r\nourselves to school? Entering the great gate of the western of the two\r\nquadrangles, we are welcomed by a bronze statue of the founder of the\r\ninstitution, Henry VI. He endowed it in 1440. The first organization\r\ncomprised \"a provost, four clerks, ten priests, six choristers,\r\ntwenty-five poor grammar-scholars, and twenty-five poor infirm men to\r\npray for the king.\" The prayers of these invalids were sorely needed\r\nby the unhappy scion of Lancaster, but did him little good in a\r\ntemporal sense. The provost is always rector of the parish. Laymen are\r\nnon-eligible. Thus it happens that the list does not include two\r\nnames which would have illuminated it more than those of any of the\r\nincumbents--Boyle the philosopher, \"father of chemistry and brother\r\nof the earl of Cork,\" and Waller the poet. The modern establishment\r\nconsists of a provost, vice-provost, six fellows, a master,\r\nunder-master, assistants, seventy foundation scholars, seven lay\r\nclerks and ten choristers, with a cortege of \"inferior officers and\r\nservants\"--a tolerably full staff. The pay-students, as they would be\r\ntermed in this country, numbering usually five to six hundred, do not\r\nlive in the college precincts, but at boarding-houses in the town,\r\nwhence their designation of oppidans, the seventy gowns-men only\r\nhaving dormitories in the college. The roll of the alumni contains\r\nsuch names as the first earl of Chatham, Harley, earl of Oxford,\r\nBolingbroke, Fox, Gray, Canning, Wellington and Hallam. That is enough\r\nto say for Eton. The beauties of the chapel, the treasures of the\r\nlibrary and the other shows of the place become trivial by the side of\r\nthe record.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEDSOR AND COOKHAM CHURCHES.]\r\n\r\nOver the \"fifteen-arch\" bridge, which has but three or four arches, we\r\npass to the town of Windsor, which crouches, on the river-side, close\r\nup to the embattled walls of the castle--so closely that the very\r\nirregular pile of buildings included in the latter cannot at first\r\nglance be well distinguished from the town. High over all swells the\r\nround tower to a height above the water of two hundred and twenty\r\nfeet--no excessive altitude, if we deduct the eminence on which it\r\nstands, yet enough, in this level country, to give it a prospect of\r\na score or two of miles in all directions. The Conqueror fell in love\r\nwith the situation at first sight, and gave a stolen monastery in\r\nexchange for it. The home so won has provided a shelter--at times very\r\nimperfect, indeed--to British sovereigns for eight centuries. From\r\nthe modest erection of William it has been steadily growing--with the\r\ngrowth of the empire, we were near saying, but its chief enlargements\r\noccurred before the empire entered upon the expansion of the past\r\nthree centuries. It is more closely associated with Edward III. than\r\nwith any other of the ancient line. He was born at Windsor, and\r\nalmost entirely rebuilt it, William of Wykeham being superintending\r\narchitect, with \"a fee of one shilling a day whilst at Windsor, and\r\ntwo shillings when he went elsewhere on the duties of his office,\"\r\nthree shillings a week being the pay of his clerk. It becomes at once\r\nobvious that the margin for \"rings\" was but slender in those days.\r\nThe labor question gave not the least trouble. The law of supply\r\nand demand was not consulted. \"Three hundred and sixty workmen were\r\nimpressed, to be employed on the building at the king's wages; some\r\nof whom having clandestinely left Windsor and engaged in other\r\nemployments to greater advantage, writs were issued prohibiting all\r\npersons from employing them on pain of forfeiting all their goods and\r\nchattels.\" In presence of so simple and effective a definition of the\r\nrights of the workingman, strikes sink into nothingness. And Magna\r\nCharta had been signed a hundred and fifty years before! That\r\ndocument, however, in honor of which the free and enlightened Briton\r\nof to-day is wont to elevate his hat and his voice, was only in the\r\nname and on behalf of the barons. The English people derived under it\r\nneither name, place nor right. English liberty is only incidental, a\r\nfoundling of untraced parentage, a _filius nullius_. True, its\r\ngrowth was indirectly fostered by aught that checked the power of the\r\nmonarch, and the nobles builded more wisely than they knew or intended\r\nwhen they brought Lackland to book, or to parchment, at Runnymede,\r\nnot far down the river and close to the edge of the royal park. The\r\nmemorable plain is still a meadow, kept ever green and inviolate of\r\nthe plough. A pleasant row it is for the Eton youngsters to this spot.\r\nOn Magna Charta island, opposite, they may take their rest and their\r\nlunch, and refresh their minds as well with the memories of the place.\r\nThe task of reform is by no means complete. There is room and call\r\nfor further concessions in favor of the masses. These embryo statesmen\r\nhave work blocked out for them in the future, and this is a good place\r\nfor them to adjust to it the focus of their bright young optics.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ETON COLLEGE AND CHAPEL.]\r\n\r\nThe monarchical idea is certainly predominant in our present\r\nsurroundings. The Thames flows from the castle and the school under\r\ntwo handsome erections named the Victoria and Albert bridges; and\r\nwhen, turning our back upon Staines, just below Runnymede, with its\r\nboundary-stone marking the limit of the jurisdiction of plebeian\r\nLondon's fierce democracy, and inscribed \"God preserve the City of\r\nLondon, 1280,\" we strike west into the Great Park, we soon come plump\r\non George III, a great deal larger than life. The \"best farmer that\r\never brushed dew from lawn\" is clad in antique costume with toga and\r\nbuskins. Bestriding a stout horse, without stirrups and with no bridle\r\nto speak of, the old gentleman looks calmly into the distance while\r\nhis steed is in the act of stepping over a perpendicular precipice.\r\nThis preposterous effort of the glyptic art has the one merit of\r\nserving as a finger-board. The old king points us to his palace, three\r\nmiles off, at the end of the famous Long Walk. He did not himself care\r\nto live at the castle, but liked to make his home at an obscure lodge\r\nin the park, the same from which, on his first attack of insanity, he\r\nset out in charge of two of his household on that melancholy ride\r\nto the retreat of Kew, more convenient in those days for medical\r\nattendance from London, and to which he returned a few months later\r\nrestored for the time. Shortly after his recovery he undertook to\r\nthrow up one of the windows of the lodge, but found it nailed down. He\r\nasked the cause, and was told, with inconsiderate bluntness, that\r\nit had been done during his illness to prevent his doing himself an\r\ninjury. The perfect calmness and silence with which he received this\r\nexplanation was a sufficient evidence of his recovery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ETON COLLEGE, FROM NORTH TERRACE, WINDSOR.]\r\n\r\nBidding the old man a final farewell, we accept the direction of\r\nhis brazen hand and take up the line of march, wherein all traveling\r\nAmerica has preceded us, to the point wherefrom we glanced off so\r\nsuddenly in obedience to the summons of Magna Charta. On either\r\nhand, as we thread the Long Walk, open glades that serve as so many\r\nemerald-paved courts to the monarchs of the grove, some of them older\r\nthan the whole Norman dynasty, with Saxon summers recorded in their\r\nhearts. One of them, thirty-eight feet round, is called after the\r\nConqueror. Among these we shall not find the most noted of Windsor\r\ntrees. It was in the Home Park, on the farther or northern side of the\r\ncastle, that the fairies were used to perform their\r\n\r\n    --dance of custom round about the oak\r\n  Of Herne the hunter.\r\n\r\nWhether the genuine oak was cut down at the close of the last century,\r\nor was preserved, carefully fenced in and labeled, in an utterly\r\nleafless and shattered state, to our generation, is a moot point.\r\nCertain it is that the most ardent Shakespearean must abandon the hope\r\nof securing for a bookmark to his _Merry Wives of Windsor_ one of the\r\nleaves that rustled, while \"Windsor bell struck twelve,\" over the head\r\nof fat Jack. He has the satisfaction, however, of looking up at the\r\nidentical bell-tower of the sixteenth century, and may make tryst with\r\nhis imagination to await its midnight chime. Then he may cross the\r\ngraceful iron bridge--modern enough, unhappily--to Datchet, and\r\nascertain by actual experiment whether the temperature of the Thames\r\nhas changed since the dumping into it of Falstaff, \"hissing hot.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STAINES CHURCH.]\r\n\r\nBack at the castle, we must \"do\" it, after the set fashion. Reminders\r\nmeet us at the threshold that it is in form a real place of defence,\r\ncontemplative of wars and rumors of wars, and not a mere dwelling by\r\nany means in original design. A roadway, crooked and raked by frowning\r\nembrasures, leads up from the peaceful town to the particularly\r\ninhospitable-looking twin towers of Henry VIII.'s gateway, in their\r\nturn commanded by the round tower on the right, in full panoply of\r\nartificial scarp and ditch. Sentinels in the scarlet livery that\r\nhas flamed on so many battlefields of all the islands and continents\r\nassist in proving that things did not always go so easy with majesty\r\nas they do now. But two centuries and more have elapsed since\r\nthere happened any justification for this frown of stone, steel and\r\nfeathers; Rupert's futile demonstration on it in 1642 having been\r\nWindsor's last taste of war, its sternest office after that having\r\nbeen the safe-keeping of Charles I., who here spent his \"sorrowful and\r\nlast Christmas.\" Once inside the gate, visions of peace recur. The eye\r\nfirst falls on the most beautiful of all the assembled structures,\r\nSt. George's Chapel. It, with the royal tomb house, the deanery and\r\nWinchester tower, occupies the left or north side of the lower or\r\nwestern ward. In the rear of the chapel of St. George are quartered in\r\ncozy cloisters the canons of the college of that ilk--not great guns\r\nin any sense, but old ecclesiastical artillery spiked after a more or\r\nless noisy youth and laid up in varnished black for the rest of their\r\ndays. Watch and ward over these modern equipments is kept by Julius\r\nCæsar's tower, as one of the most ancient erections is of course\r\ncalled. Still farther to our left as we enter are the quarters of\r\nsundry other antiquated warriors, the Military Knights of Windsor.\r\nThese are a few favored veterans, mostly decayed officers of the army\r\nand navy, who owe this shelter to royal favor and an endowment. The\r\nIvy tower, west of the entrance, is followed in eastward succession by\r\nthose of the gateway, Salisbury, Garter and Bell towers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORMAN GATE AND ROUND TOWER, WINDSOR.]\r\n\r\nThe fine exterior of St. George's is more than matched by the carving\r\nand blazonry of the interior. The groined roof bears the devices of\r\nhalf a dozen early kings, beginning with Edward the Confessor. Along\r\nthe choir stretch the stalls of the sovereign and knights-companions\r\nof the order of the Garter, each hung with banner, mantle, sword and\r\nhelmet. Better than these is the hammered steel tomb of Edward IV., by\r\nQuentin Matsys, the Flemish blacksmith. In the vaults beneath rest the\r\nvictim of Edward, Henry VI., Henry VIII., Jane Seymour and Charles I.\r\nThe account of the appearance of Charles' remains when his tomb was\r\nexamined in 1813 by Sir Henry Halford, accompanied by several of the\r\nroyal family, is worth quoting. \"The complexion of the face was dark\r\nand discolored. The forehead and temples had lost little or nothing of\r\ntheir muscular substance. The cartilage of the nose was gone; but the\r\nleft eye, in the moment of first exposure, was open and full,\r\nthough it vanished almost immediately, and the pointed beard so\r\ncharacteristic of the reign of King Charles was perfect. The shape\r\nof the face was a long oval; many of the teeth remained; and the\r\nleft ear, in consequence of the interposition of some unctuous matter\r\nbetween it and the cere-cloth, was found entire. The hair was thick at\r\nthe back part of the head, and in appearance nearly black. A portion\r\nof it, which has since been cleaned and dried, is of a beautiful\r\ndark-brown color. That of the beard was a reddish-brown. On the back\r\npart of the head it was not more than an inch in length, and had\r\nprobably been cut so short for the convenience of the executioner,\r\nor perhaps by the piety of friends after death in order to furnish\r\nmemorials of the unhappy king. On holding up the head to determine\r\nthe place of separation from the body, the muscles of the neck had\r\nevidently contracted themselves considerably, and the fourth cervical\r\nvertebra was found to be cut through its substance transversely,\r\nleaving the face of the divided portions perfectly smooth and even--an\r\nappearance which could have been produced only by a heavy blow\r\ninflicted with a very sharp instrument, and which furnished the last\r\nproof wanting to identify Charles I.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HERNE'S OAK.]\r\n\r\nA highly-edifying spectacle this must have been to the prince regent\r\nand his brother Cumberland. The certainties of the past and the\r\npossibilities of the future were calculated to be highly suggestive.\r\nA French sovereign had but a few years before shared the fate of\r\nCharles, and a cloud of other kings were drifting about Europe with\r\nno very flattering prospect of coming soon to anchor. Napoleon was\r\nshowing his banded foes a good double front in Germany and Spain.\r\nHis dethronement and the restoration of the Bourbons were not as yet\r\ncontemplated. The Spanish succession was whittled down to a girl--that\r\nis, by Salic law, to nothing at all. The Hanoverian was in a similar\r\ncondition, or worse, none of the old sons of the crazy old king\r\nhaving any legitimate children. The prince regent himself was highly\r\nunpopular with the mass of his people; and the classes that formed\r\nhis principal support were more so, by reason of the arrogance and\r\nexactions of the landed interest, the high price of grain and\r\nother heavy financial burdens consequent on the war, the arbitrary\r\nprosecutions and imprisonment of leaders of the people, and the\r\nirregularities of his private life.\r\n\r\nBut these sinister omens proved illusory. Leigh Hunt, Wraxall and the\r\nrest made but ineffectual martyrs; the Bourbons straggled back into\r\nFrance and Spain, with such results as we see; George IV. weathered,\r\nby no merit of his own, a fresh series of storms at home; the clouds\r\nthat lowered upon his house were made glorious summer by the advent of\r\na fat little lady in 1819--the fat old lady of 1875; and we step from\r\nthe tomb of Charles in St. George's Chapel to that where George and\r\nWilliam slumber undisturbed in the tomb-house, elaborately decorated\r\nby Wolsey. Wolsey's fixtures were sold by the thrifty patriots of\r\nCromwell's Parliament, and bought in by the republican governor of the\r\ncastle as \"old brass.\" George was able, too, to add another story to\r\nthe stature of the round tower or keep that marks the middle ward\r\nof the castle and looks down, on the rare occasion of a sufficiently\r\nclear atmosphere, on prosperous and no longer disloyal London. This\r\nsame keep has quite a list of royal prisoners; John of France and\r\nDavid II. and James I. of Scotland enjoyed a prolonged view of its\r\ninterior; so did the young earl of Surrey, a brother-poet, a century\r\nremoved, of James.\r\n\r\nLeaving behind us the atmosphere of shackles and dungeons, we emerge,\r\nthrough the upper ward and the additions of Queen Bess, upon the ample\r\nterrace, where nothing bounds us but the horizon. Together, the north,\r\neast and south terraces measure some two thousand feet. The first\r\nlooks upon Eton, the lesser park of some five hundred acres which\r\nfills a bend of the Thames and the country beyond for many miles. The\r\neastern platform, lying between the queen's private apartments and an\r\nexquisite private garden, is not always free to visitors. The south\r\nterrace presents to the eye the Great Park of thirty-eight hundred\r\nacres, extending six miles, with a width of from half a mile to\r\ntwo miles. The equestrian statue at the end of the Long Walk is a\r\nconspicuous object. The prevailing mass of rolling woods is broken by\r\nscattered buildings, glades and avenues, which take from it monotony\r\nand give it life. Near the south end is an artificial pond called\r\nVirginia Water, edged with causeless arches and ruins that never were\r\nanything but ruins, Chinese temples and idle toys of various other\r\nkinds, terrestrial and aquatic. The ancient trees, beeches and elms,\r\nof enormous size, and often projected individually, are worth studying\r\nnear or from a distance. The elevation is not so great as to bring\r\nout low-lying objects much removed. We see the summits of hills, each\r\nhaving its name, as St. Leonard's, Cooper's, Highstanding, etc., and\r\nglimpses of the river and of some country-seats. St. Anne's Hill was\r\nthe home of Fox; at St. Leonard's dwelt the father of his rival and\r\nrival of his father, and at Binfield, Pope, of whom it is so hard\r\nto conceive as having ever been young, \"lisped in numbers, for the\r\nnumbers came,\" natural descriptions, ethical reflections, _vers de\r\nsocieté_ and all, for around him here there was food for them all. To\r\ndescend from Pope in point of both time and romance, the view\r\nincludes the scenes of Prince Albert's agricultural experiments. Quite\r\nsuccessful many of them were. He was a thoroughly practical man--a\r\ncircumstance which carried him by several routes across ploughed\r\nfields and through well-built streets, straight to the hearts of the\r\nEnglish people. His memory is more warmly cherished, and impressed\r\nupon the stranger by more monuments, than that of any other of the\r\nGerman strain. It might have been less so had he succeeded in the\r\nefforts he is now known to have made soon after his marriage to attain\r\na higher nominal rank. He possessed, through the alliance of Leopold\r\nand Stockmar and the devotion of Victoria, kingly power without the\r\nname and the responsibility, and with that he became content. He used\r\nit cautiously and well when he employed it at all. His position was a\r\ntrying one, but he steered well through its difficulties, and died\r\nas generally trusted as he was at first universally watched. The\r\nlove-match of 1840 was every way a success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EAST FRONT, WINDSOR CASTLE.]\r\n\r\nAnother figure, more rugged and less majestic, but not less\r\nrespectable, will be associated with Victoria in the memories, if not\r\nthe history proper, of her reign. This is John Brown, the canny and\r\nimpassive Scot, content, like the Rohans, to be neither prince nor\r\nking, and, prouder than they, satisfied honestly to discharge the\r\noffice of a flunkey without the very smallest trace of the flunkey\r\nspirit. He too has lived down envy and all uncharitableness.\r\nContemptuous and serene amid the hootings of the mob and the squibs\r\nof the newspapers, he carries, as he has done for years, Her Majesty's\r\nshawl and capacious India-rubbers, attends her tramps through the\r\nHighlands and the Home Park, engineers her special trains and looks\r\nafter her personal comfort even to the extent of ordering her to\r\nwear \"mair claes\" in a Scotch mist. The queen has embalmed him in\r\nher books, and he will rank among the heroes of royal authors as his\r\nnamesake and countryman the Cameronian, by favor of very similar moral\r\nqualities, does with those of more democratic proclivities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUEEN ELIZABETH'S BUILDING, WINDSOR.]\r\n\r\nWe cannot apply literally to the view from Windsor Thackeray's lines\r\non \"the castle towers of Bareacres:\"\r\n\r\n  I stood upon the donjon keep and viewed the country o'er;\r\n  I saw the lands of Bareacres for fifty miles or more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARL OF SURREY.]\r\n\r\nWe scan what was once embraced in Windsor Forest, where the Norman\r\nlaid his broad palm on a space a hundred and twenty miles round, and,\r\nlike the lion in the fable of the hunting-party, informed his subjects\r\nthat that was his share. The domain dwindled, as did other royal\r\nappurtenances. Yet in 1807 the circuit was as much as seventy-seven\r\nmiles. In 1789 it embraced sixty thousand acres. The process of\r\ncontraction has since been accelerated, and but little remains outside\r\nof the Great and Little Parks. Several villages of little note stand\r\nupon it. Of these Wokingham has the distinction of an ancient hostelry\r\nyclept the Rose; and the celebrity of the Rose is a beautiful daughter\r\nof the landlord of a century and a half ago. This lady missed her\r\nproper fame by the blunder of a merry party of poets who one evening\r\nencircled the mahogany of her papa. It was as \"fast\" a festivity as\r\nsuch names as Gay and Swift could make it. Their combined efforts\r\nresulted in the burlesque of _Molly Mog_. These two and some others\r\ncontributed each a verse in honor of the fair waiter. But they mistook\r\nher name, and the crown fell upon the less charming brow of her\r\nsister, whose cognomen was depraved from Mary into Molly. Wiclif's Oak\r\nis pointed out as a corner of the old forest, a long way east of the\r\npark. Under its still spreading branches that forerunner of Luther\r\nis said to have preached. Messrs. Moody and Sankey should have sought\r\ninspiration under its shade.\r\n\r\nIn the vast assemblage of the arboreal commonwealth that carpets the\r\nlandscape the centuries are represented one with another. It is a\r\nleafy parliament that has never been dissolved or prorogued. One hoary\r\nmember is coeval with the Confessor. Another sheltered William Rufus,\r\ntired from the chase. Under another gathered recruits bound with\r\nCoeur de Lion for the Holy Land. Against the bole of this was set up\r\na practicing butt for the clothyard shafts that won Agincourt, and\r\nbeneath that bivouacked the pickets of Cromwell. As we look down upon\r\ntheir topmost leaves there floats, high above our own level, \"darkly\r\npainted on the crimson sky,\" a member, not so old, of another\r\ncommonwealth quite as ancient that has flourished among their branches\r\nfrom time immemorial. There flaps the solitary heron to the evening\r\ntryst of his tribe. Where is the hawk? Will he not rise from some fair\r\nwrist among the gay troop we see cantering across yonder glade? Only\r\nthe addition of that little gray speck circling into the blue is\r\nneeded to round off our illusion. But it comes not. In place of it\r\ncomes a spirt of steam from the railway viaduct, and the whistle of\r\nan engine. Froissart is five hundred years dead again, and we turn to\r\nBradshaw.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WINDSOR CASTLE, FROM BISHOPSGATE.]\r\n\r\nYet we have a \"view of an interior\" to contemplate before facing the\r\nlower Thames. And first, as the day is fading, we seek the dimmest\r\npart. We dive into the crypt of the bell-tower, or the curfew-tower,\r\nthat used to send far and wide to many a Saxon cottage the hateful\r\nwarning that told of servitude. How old the base of this tower is\r\nnobody seems to know, nor how far back it has served as a prison.\r\nThe oldest initials of state prisoners inscribed on its cells date\r\nto 1600. The walls are twelve feet thick, and must have begotten a\r\npleasant feeling of perfect security in the breasts of the involuntary\r\ninhabitants. They did not know of a device contrived for the security\r\nof their jailers, which has but recently been discovered. This is a\r\nsubterranean and subaqueous passage, alleged to lead under the river\r\nto Burnham Abbey, three miles off. The visitor will not be disposed to\r\nverify this statement or to stay long in the comparatively airy crypt.\r\nDamp as the British climate may be above ground, it is more so below.\r\nWe emerge to the fine range of state apartments above, and submit to\r\nthe rule of guide and guide-book.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOCK AT WINDSOR.]\r\n\r\nSt. George's Hall, the Waterloo gallery, the council-chamber and the\r\nVandyck room are the most attractive, all of them for the historical\r\nportraits they contain, and the first, besides, for its merit as an\r\nexample of a Gothic interior and its associations with the order of\r\nthe Garter, the knights of which society are installed in it. The\r\nspecialty of the Waterloo room is the series of portraits of the\r\nleaders, civil and military, English and continental, of the last and\r\nsuccessful league against Napoleon. They are nearly all by Lawrence,\r\nand of course admirable in their delineation of character. In that\r\nessential of a good portrait none of the English school have excelled\r\nLawrence. We may rely upon the truth to Nature of each of the heads\r\nbefore us; for air and expression accord with what history tells us\r\nof the individuals, its verdict eked out and assisted by instructive\r\nminutiæ of lineament and meaning detected, in the \"off-guard\" of\r\nprivate intercourse, by the eye of a great painter and a lifelong\r\nstudent of physiognomy. We glance from the rugged Blucher to the\r\nwily Metternich, and from the philosophic Humboldt to the semi-savage\r\nPlatoff. The dandies George IV. and Alexander are here, but Brummel\r\nis left out. The gem of the collection is Pius VII., Lawrence's\r\nmasterpiece, widely familiar by engravings. Raphael's Julius II. seems\r\nto have been in the artist's mind, but that work is not improved on,\r\nunless in so far as the critical eye of our day may delight in the\r\nmore intricate tricks of chiaroscuro and effect to which Lawrence has\r\nrecourse. \"Brunswick's fated chieftain\" will interest the votaries of\r\nChilde Harold. Could he have looked forward to 1870, he would perhaps\r\nhave chosen a different side at Waterloo, as his father might at Jena,\r\nand elected to figure in oils at Versailles rather than at Windsor.\r\nIncomparably more destructive to the small German princes have been\r\nthe Hohenzollerns than the Bonapartes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE THAMES EMBANKMENT.]\r\n\r\nWe forget these nineteenth-century people in the council-chamber,\r\nwherein reign Guido, Rembrandt, Claude, and even Da Vinci. If\r\nLeonardo really executed all the canvases ascribed to him in English\r\ncollections, the common impressions of his habits of painting but\r\nlittle, and not often finishing that, do him great injustice. Martin\r\nLuther is here, by Holbein, and the countess of Desmond, the merry old\r\nlady\r\n\r\n  Who lived to the age of twice threescore and ten,\r\n  And died of a fall from a cherry tree then,\r\n\r\nis embalmed in the bloom of one hundred and twenty and the gloom of\r\nRembrandt. The two dozen pictures in this room form nearly as odd an\r\nassociation as any like number of portraits could do. Guercino's Sibyl\r\nfigures with a cottage interior by Teniers, and Lely's Prince Rupert\r\nlooks down with lordly scorn on Jonah pitched into the sea by the\r\ncombined efforts of the two Poussins. The link between Berghem's cows\r\nand Del Sarto's Holy Family was doubtless supplied to the minds of\r\nthe hanging committee by recollections of the manger. Our thrifty\r\nPennsylvanian, West, is assigned the vestibule. Five of his \"ten-acre\"\r\npictures illustrate the wars of Edward III. and the Black Prince.\r\nThe king's closet and the queen's closet are filled mostly by the\r\nFlemings. Vandyck's room finally finishes the list. It has, besides\r\na portrait of himself and several more of the first Charles and his\r\nfamily in every pose, some such queer, or worse than queer, commoners\r\nas Tom Killigrew and Sir Kenelm Digby and Venetia his hopeful spouse,\r\nso dear to novelists of a certain school.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELMS NEAR THE HERONRY.]\r\n\r\nVast sums have been expended on the renovation and improvement of the\r\ncastle during the past half century. With Victoria it has been more\r\npopular as a residence than with any of her predecessors since\r\nthe fourteenth century. What, however, with its greater practical\r\nproximity to London, due to railways, and what with the queen's liking\r\nfor solitude since the death of her consort, the more secluded\r\nhomes of Osborne and Balmoral have measurably superseded it in her\r\naffections. Five hundred miles of distance to the Dee preclude the\r\npossibility of the dumping on her, by means of excursion trains, of\r\nloyal cockneydom. She is as thoroughly protected from that inundation\r\nin the Isle of Wight, the average Londoner having a fixed horror of\r\nsea-sickness. The running down, by her private steamer, of a few more\r\ninquisitive yachts in the Solent would be a hazardous experiment, if\r\ntemporarily effective in keeping home invaders at bay. Holding as her\r\nright and left bowers those two sanctuaries at the opposite ends of\r\nher island realm, she can play a strong hand in the way of personal\r\nindependence, and cease to feel that hers is a monarchy limited by the\r\nrights of the masses. It is well for the country that she should be\r\nleft as far as possible to consult her own comfort, ease and health\r\nat least as freely as the humblest of her subjects. The continuance\r\nof her life is certainly a political desideratum. It largely aids in\r\nmaintaining a wholesome balance between conservatism and reform. So\r\nlong as she lives there will be no masculine will to exaggerate the\r\nformer or obstruct the latter, as notably happened under George\r\nIII. and William IV. Her personal bearing is also in her favor. Her\r\npopularity, temporarily obscured a few years ago, is becoming as great\r\nas ever. It has never been weakened by any misstep in politics, and so\r\nlong as that can be said will be exposed to no serious danger.\r\n\r\nWe are far from being at the end of the upper Thames. Oxford, were\r\nthere no other namable place, is beyond us. But we have explored\r\nthe denser portion--the nucleus of the nebula of historic stars that\r\nstretches into the western sky as seen from the metropolis. We lay\r\naside our little lorgnette. It has shown us as much as we can map in\r\nthese pages, and that we have endeavored to do with at least the merit\r\nof accuracy.\r\n\r\nEDWARD C. BRUCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POET'S PEN.\r\n\r\n      I am an idle reed;\r\n  I rustle in the whispering air;\r\n      I bear my stalk and seed\r\n  Through spring-time's glow and summer's glare.\r\n\r\n      And in the fiercer strife\r\n  Which winter brings to me amain,\r\n      Sapless, I waste my life,\r\n  And, murmuring at my fate, complain.\r\n\r\n      I am a worthless reed;\r\n  No golden top have I for crown,\r\n      No flower for beauty's meed,\r\n  No wreath for poet's high renown.\r\n\r\n      Hollow and gaunt, my wand\r\n  Shrill whistles, bending in the gale;\r\n      Leafless and sad I stand,\r\n  And, still neglected, still bewail.\r\n\r\n      O foolish reed! to wail!\r\n  A poet came, with downcast eyes,\r\n      And, wandering through the dale,\r\n  Saw thee and claimed thee for his prize.\r\n\r\n      He plucked thee from the mire;\r\n  He pruned and made of thee a pen,\r\n      And wrote in words of fire\r\n  His flaming song to listening men;\r\n\r\n      Till thou, so lowly bred,\r\n  Now wedded to a nobler state,\r\n      Utt'rest such pæans overhead\r\n  That angels listen at their gate.\r\n\r\n  F.A. HILLARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSKETCHES OF INDIA.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had now learned to place myself unreservedly in the hands of Bhima\r\nGandharva. When, therefore, on regaining the station at Khandallah, he\r\nsaid, \"The route by which I intend to show you India will immediately\r\ntake us quite away from this part of it; first, however, let us go and\r\nsee Poona, the old Mahratta capital, which lies but a little more than\r\nthirty miles farther to the south-eastward by rail,\"--I accepted the\r\nproposition as a matter of course, and we were soon steaming down the\r\neastern declivity of the Gháts. As we moved smoothly down into the\r\ntreeless plains which surround Poona I could not resist a certain\r\nfeeling of depression.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Bhima Gandharva when I mentioned it to him, \"I understand\r\nexactly what you mean. On reaching an unbroken expanse of level\r\ncountry, after leaving the tops of mountains, I always feel as if my\r\nsoul had come bump against a solid wall of rock in the dark. I seem\r\nto hear a dull _thud_ of discouragement somewhere back in my soul, as\r\nwhen a man's body falls dead on the earth. Nothing, indeed, could\r\nmore heighten such a sensation than the contrast between this and\r\nthe Bombay side of the Gháts. There we had the undulating waters,\r\nthe lovely harbor with its wooded and hilly islands, the ascending\r\nterraces of the Gháts: everything was energetic, the whole invitation\r\nof Nature was toward air, light, freedom, heaven. But here one spot\r\nis like another spot; this level ground is just the same level ground\r\nthere was a mile back; this corn stands like that corn; there is an\r\noppressive sense of bread-and-butter about; one somehow finds one's\r\nself thinking of ventilation and economics. It is the sausage-grinding\r\nschool of poetry--of which modern art, by the way, presents several\r\nexamples--as compared with that general school represented by the\r\ngeniuses who arise and fly their own flight and sing at a great\r\ndistance above the heads of men and of wheat.\"\r\n\r\nHaving arrived and refreshed ourselves at our hotel, whose proprietor\r\nwas, as usual, a Parsee, we sallied forth for a stroll about Poona. On\r\none side of us lay the English quarter, consisting of the houses and\r\ngardens of the officers and government employés, and of the two or\r\nthree hundred other Englishmen residing here. On the other was the\r\ntown, extending itself along the banks of the little river Moota.\r\nWe dreamed ourselves along in the lovely weather through such of\r\nthe seven quarters of the town as happened to strike the fancy of my\r\ncompanion. Occasionally we were compelled to turn out of our way\r\nfor the sacred cattle, which, in the enjoyment of their divine\r\nprerogatives, would remain serenely lying across our path; but\r\nwe respected the antiquity, if not the reasonableness, of their\r\nprivileges, and murmured not.\r\n\r\nEach of the seven quarters of Poona is named after a day of the week.\r\nAs we strolled from Monday to Tuesday, or passed with bold anachronism\r\nfrom Saturday back to Wednesday, I could not help observing how\r\nthese interweavings and reversals of time appeared to take an actual\r\nembodiment in the scenes through which we slowly moved, particularly\r\nin respect of the houses and the costumes which went to make up\r\nour general view. From the modern-built European houses to the\r\nmediæval-looking buildings of the Bhoodwar quarter, with their massive\r\nwalls and loop-holes and crenellations, was a matter of four or five\r\ncenturies back in a mere turn of the eye; and from these latter to\r\nthe Hindu temples here and there, which, whether or not of actual age,\r\nalways carry one straight into antiquity, was a further retrogression\r\nto the obscure depths of time. So, too, one's glance would often sweep\r\nin a twinkling from a European clothed in garments of the latest mode\r\nto a Hindu whose sole covering was his _dhotee_, or clout about the\r\nloins, taking in between these two extremes a number of distinct\r\nstages in the process of evolution through which our clothes have\r\ngone. In the evening we visited the _Sangam_, where the small streams\r\nof the Moola and the Moota come together. It is filled with cenotaphs,\r\nbut, so far from being a place of weeping, the pleasant air was full\r\nof laughter and of gay conversation from the Hindus, who delight to\r\nrepair here for the purpose of enjoying the cool breath of the evening\r\nas well as the pleasures of social intercourse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HINDU TEMPLES NEAR POONA.]\r\n\r\nBut I did not care to linger in Poona. The atmosphere always had to me\r\na certain tang of the assassinations, the intrigues, the treacheries\r\nwhich marked the reign of that singular line of usurping ministers\r\nwhose capital was here. In the days when the Peishwas were in the\r\nheight of their glory Poona was a city of a hundred and fifty thousand\r\ninhabitants, and great traffic was here carried on in jewelry and\r\nsuch luxuries among the Mahratta nobles. The Mahrattas once, indeed,\r\npossessed the whole of India practically; and their name is composed\r\nof _Mahu_, a word meaning \"great,\" and often to be met with in the\r\ndesignations of this land, where so many things really _are_ great,\r\nand _Rachtra_, \"kingdom,\" the propriety of the appellation seeming to\r\nbe justified by the bravery and military character of the people. They\r\nhave been called the Cossacks of India from these qualities combined\r\nwith their horsemanship. But the dynasty of the usurping ministers had\r\nits origin in iniquity; and the corruption of its birth quickly broke\r\nout again under the stimulus of excess and luxury, until it culminated\r\nin the destruction of the Mahratta empire in 1818. So, when we had\r\nseen the palace of the Peishwa, from one of whose balconies the young\r\nPeishwa Mahadeo committed suicide by leaping to the earth in the\r\nyear 1797 through shame at having been reproved by his minister\r\nNana Farnavese in presence of his court, and when we had visited the\r\nHira-Bâgh, or Garden of Diamonds, the summer retreat of the Peishwas,\r\nwith its elegant pavilion, its balconies jutting into the masses of\r\nfoliage, its cool tank of water, reposing under the protection of the\r\ntemple-studded Hill of Pararati, we took train again for Bombay.\r\n\r\nThe Great Indian Peninsula Railway's main line leads out of Bombay\r\nover the Gháts to Jabalpúr, six hundred miles; thence a railway of\r\nsome two hundred and twenty miles runs to Allahabad, connecting them\r\nwith the great line, known as the East Indian Railway, which extends\r\nfor more than a thousand miles north-westward from Calcutta _viâ_\r\nPatna, Benares, Allahabad, Cawnpore, Lucknow, Agra and Delhi. Our\r\njourney, as marked out by Bhima Gandharva, was to be from Bombay\r\nto Jabalpúr by rail; thence by some slow and easy conveyance across\r\ncountry to Bhopal, and from Bhopal northward through Jhansi to Delhi\r\nand the northern country, thence returning by rail to Calcutta.\r\n\r\nAs one ascends the Western Gháts shortly after leaving Bombay one has\r\ncontinual occasion to remark the extraordinary resources of modern\r\nrailway engineering. Perhaps the mechanical skill of our time has not\r\nachieved any more brilliant illustrations of itself than here occur.\r\nFor many miles one is literally going up a flight of steps by rail.\r\nThe word Ghát indeed means the steps leading up from pools or rivers,\r\nwhose frequent occurrence in India attests the need of easy access\r\nto water, arising from the important part which it plays both in the\r\ncivil and religious economies of the Hindu. The Gháts are so called\r\nfrom their terraced ledges, rising one above another from the shores\r\nof the ocean like the stairs leading up from a pool. In achieving the\r\nascent of these gigantic stairs all the expedients of road-makers have\r\nbeen resorted to: the zigzag, the trestle, the tunnel, the curve, have\r\nbeen pushed to their utmost applications; for five continuous miles\r\non the Thull Ghát Incline there is a grade of one in thirty-seven,\r\ninvolving many trying curves, and on nineteen miles of the Bhore Ghát\r\nIncline there are thirty tunnels.\r\n\r\nThat which gives tone and character to a general view of the interior\r\nof a railway-car in traveling is, from the nature of things, the\r\nhead-covering of the occupants, for it is this which mostly meets the\r\neye; and no one who has traveled in the United States, for example,\r\ncan have failed to observe the striking difference between the aspect\r\nof a car in the South, where the felt slouch prevails, and of one\r\nin the North, where the silk hat is more affected. But cars full\r\nof turbans! There were turbans of silk, of muslin, of woolen; white\r\nturbans, red, green and yellow turbans; turbans with knots, turbans\r\nwith ends hanging; neat turbans, baggy turbans, preternatural turbans,\r\nand that curious spotted silk inexpressible mitre which the Parsee\r\nwears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GÓNDS.]\r\n\r\nBhima Gandharva was good enough to explain to me the turban; and\r\nreally, when within bounds, it is not so nonsensical a headdress as\r\none is apt at first to imagine. It is a strip of cloth from nine to\r\ntwelve inches wide, and from fifteen to twenty-five yards long. They\r\nare known, however, of larger dimensions, reaching to a yard in width\r\nand sixty yards in length. The most common color is white; next,\r\nperhaps, red, and next yellow; though green, blue, purple and black\r\nare worn, as are also buff, shot colors and gray, these latter being\r\nusually of silk; but this does not exhaust the varieties, for there\r\nare many turbans made of cotton cloth printed in various devices to\r\nsuit the fancies of the wearers.\r\n\r\n\"The _puttee-dar_ (_pugri_, or turban),\" continued my companion, \"is\r\na neat compact turban, in general use by Hindus and Mohammedans; the\r\n_joore-dar_ is like the _puttee-dar_, except that it has the addition\r\nof a knot on the crown; the _khirkee-dar_ is the full-dress turban of\r\ngentlemen attached to native courts; the _nustalik_ is a small turban\r\nwhich fits closely to the head, and is worn for full dress at the\r\nMohammedan _durbars_ or royal receptions; the _mundeel_ is the\r\nmilitary turban, with stripes of gold and ends; the _séthi_ is\r\nlike the _nustalik_, and is worn by bankers; the _shumla_ is\r\na shawl-turban; and I fear you do not care to know the other\r\nvarieties--the _morassa_, the _umamu_, the _dustar_, the--\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" I said: \"life is short, my dear Bhima, and I shall know\r\nnothing but turbans if this goes on, which will be inconvenient,\r\nparticularly when I return to my home and my neighbor Smith asks me\r\nthat ghastly question, 'What do I think of India?'\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a more 'ghastly' question as to India than as to any other\r\ncountry in the world,\" said the Hindu. \"Some years ago, when Mr.\r\nDilke was traveling in this country, a witty officer of one of the\r\nhill-stations remarked to him that _all general observations about\r\nIndia were absurd_. This is quite true. How could it be otherwise?\r\nOnly consider, for example, the languages of India--the Assamese, with\r\nits two branches of the Deccan-göl and the Uttar-göl; the Bengalee;\r\nthe Maithilee, Tirhutiya or Tirabhucti, spoken between the Coosy and\r\nthe Gunduck; the Orissan, of the regions around Cuttack; the Nepalese;\r\nthe Kosalese, about Almora; the Dogusee, between Almora and Cashmere;\r\nthe Cashmiran; the Panjabee; the Mooltanee, or Vuchee, on the middle\r\nIndus; the two dialects of Sindhí, or Tatto, on the lower Indus; the\r\nCutché, on the west coast of the peninsula; the Guseraté, spoken\r\non the islands of Salsette and Bombay and the opposite coast of the\r\nCoucan, as well as by the Parsees in the cities, where it is corrupted\r\nwith many words of other languages through the influence of commercial\r\nrelations; the Coucané, from Bombay to Goa and along the parallel\r\nGháts where it is called Ballagate; the Bikaneeré, the Marvaré, the\r\nJeyporé, the Udayaporé, of Rajpootana; the Vraja-bhasha (the cow-pen\r\nlanguage) of the Doab, between the Ganges and the Jumna, which is\r\nprobably the parent of Hindi (or Oordú); the Malooé, of the tableland\r\nof Malwa; the Bundelakhandé, of the Bundelkhand; the Mogadhé, of\r\nBehar; the Maharachtré, of the country south of the Vindhyas; the--\"\r\n\r\n\"It gives me pain to interrupt you, Bhima Gandharva,\" I said\r\n(fervently hoping that this portion of my remark might escape the\r\nattention of the recording angel); \"but I think we are at Jabalpúr.\"\r\n\r\n_Apropos_ of Jubbulpoor, it is well enough to remark that by the rules\r\nof Indian orthography which are now to be considered authentic, the\r\nletter \"a\" without an accent has a sound equivalent to short \"u,\" and\r\na vowel with an acute accent has what is usually called its long\r\nsound in English. Accordingly, the word written \"Jabalpúr\" should\r\nbe pronounced as if retaining the \"u\" and the \"oo\" with which it was\r\nformerly written, \"Jubbulpoor\". The termination _púr_, so common in\r\nthe designation of Indian places, is equivalent to that of _ville_\r\nin English, and means the same. The other common termination, _abad_,\r\nmeans \"dwelling\" or \"residence\": e.g., Ahmedabad, the residence of\r\nAhmed. Jabalpúr is but about a mile from the right bank of the Nerbadá\r\n(_Nerbudda_) River; and as I wished to see the famous Marble Rocks\r\nof that stream, which are found a short distance from Jabalpúr, my\r\ncompanion and I here left the railway, intending to see a little of\r\nthe valley of the Nerbadá, and then to strike across the Vindhyas,\r\nalong the valley of the Tonsa, to Bhopal, making our journey by such\r\nslow, irregular and easy stages as should be compatible with that\r\nserene and philosophic disposition into which the Hindu's beautiful\r\ngravity had by this time quite converted my American tendencies toward\r\nrushing through life at the killing pace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CENOTAPHS IN THE VALLEY OF THE TONSA.]\r\n\r\nIt was a little past midday when we made our first journey along the\r\nriver between the Marble Rocks. Although the weather was as nearly\r\nperfect as weather could be, the mornings being deliciously cool and\r\nbracing and the nights cold enough to produce often a thin layer of\r\nice over a pan of water left exposed till daybreak, yet the midday sun\r\nwas warm enough, especially after a walk, to make one long for leaves\r\nand shade and the like. It would be difficult, therefore, to convey\r\nthe sensations with which we reclined at our ease in a flat-bottomed\r\npunt while an attendant poled us up toward the \"Fall of Smoke,\" where\r\nthe Nerbadá leaps out eagerly toward the low lands he is to fertilize,\r\nlike a young poet anxious to begin his work of grace in the world. On\r\neach side of us rose walls of marble a hundred feet in height, whose\r\npure white was here and there striped with dark green or black: all\r\nthe colors which met the eye--the marmoreal whites, the bluish grays\r\nof the recesses among the ledges, the green and black seams, the\r\nlimpid blue of the stream--were grateful, calm-toned, refreshing; we\r\ninhaled the coolness as if it had been a mild aroma out of a distant\r\nflower. This pleasant fragrance, which seemed to come up out of\r\nall things, was presently intensified by a sort of spiritual\r\ncounterpart--a gentle breath that blew upon us from the mysterious\r\nregions of death; for on a _ghát_ we saw a small company of Hindus\r\njust launching the body of a pious relative into the waters of\r\nMother Nerbadá in all that freedom from grief, and even pleasant\r\ncontemplation, with which this singular people regard the transition\r\nfrom present to future existence. These corpses, however, which are\r\nthus committed to the wave, do not always chime so happily in with the\r\nreveries of boating-parties on the Nerbadá. The Marble Rocks are often\r\nresorted to by pic-nic parties in the moonlit evenings; and one can\r\neasily fancy that to have a dusky dead body float against one's boat\r\nand sway slowly round alongside in the midst of a gay jest or of a\r\nlight song of serenade, as is said to have happened not unfrequently\r\nhere, is not an occurrence likely to heighten the spirits of revelers.\r\nOccasionally, also, the black, ugly double snout of the _magar_ (or\r\nNerbadá crocodile) may pop up from the surface, which may here serve\r\nas a warning to the young lady who trails her hand in the water--and\r\nI have yet to be in a boating-party where the young lady did not trail\r\nher hand in the water--that on the Nerbadá it is perhaps as well to\r\nresign an absent-minded hand to the young officer who sits by her in\r\nthe boat lest Magar should snap it off.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Nerbadá we now struck off northward toward the Tonsa,\r\nintending to pass round by way of Dumoh, Sangor, Bhilsa and Sanchi\r\nto Bhopal. We might have pursued a route somewhat more direct by\r\nfollowing directly down the valley of the Nerbadá to Hoshangabad,\r\nand thence straight across to Bhopal, but my companion preferred\r\nthe circuitous route indicated, as embracing a greater variety of\r\ninteresting objects. He had procured for our conveyance a vehicle\r\nwhich was in all respects suitable to the placidity of his temper; and\r\nI make bold to confess that, American as I am--born on the railroad,\r\nso to speak--I have never enjoyed traveling as I did in this novel\r\ncarriage. It was what is called a _chapaya_. It consisted of a body\r\nnearly ten feet in length by more than five in breadth, and was\r\ncanopied by a top supported upon sculptured pillars of wood.\r\nThe wheels were massive and low. There were no springs; but this\r\ndeficiency was atoned for by the thick cushionment of the rear portion\r\nof the vehicle, which allowed us to lie at full length in luxurious\r\nease as we rolled along. Four white bullocks, with humps and horns\r\nrunning nearly straight back on the prolongation of the forehead line,\r\ndrew us along in a very stately manner at the rate of something like a\r\nmile and a half an hour.\r\n\r\nWe were now in the Góndwana, in some particulars one of the most\r\ninteresting portions of the country. Here are the Highlands of Central\r\nIndia; here rise the Nerbadá and the Tapti--which flow to the westward\r\nin a generally parallel direction, and empty into the Gulf of Cambaye,\r\nthe one at Broode and the other at Surat--as well as the Sôn, the\r\nKeyn (or Cane) and the Tonsa, which flow northward into the Jumna. The\r\nvalley of the Keyn and that of the Tonsa here run across the Vindhyas,\r\nwhich are known to the eastward of this as the Kyrmores, and afford\r\ncommunication between Northern and Southern India. It is along the\r\ndepression of the latter stream that the railway has been built from\r\nJabalpúr to Allahabad.\r\n\r\nThe eight hundred thousand Gónds of the Góndwana are supposed to be\r\nmembers of the great autochthonal family of ancient India. These hills\r\nof the Góndwana country appear to have been considered by the incoming\r\nAryans for a long time as a sort of uncanny land, whose savage\r\nrecesses were filled with demons and snakes: indeed, in the epics of\r\nthe Máhábháráta and Rámáyana this evil character is attributed to that\r\nportion of India lying south of the Vindhyas. The forest of Spenser's\r\nFairy Queen, in which wandering knights meet with manifold beasts and\r\nmaleficent giants, and do valorous battles against them in the rescue\r\nof damsels and the like--such seem to have been the Góndwana woods to\r\nthe ancient Hindu imagination. It was not distressed damsels,\r\nhowever, whom they figured as being assisted by the arms of the errant\r\nprotectors, but religious devotees, who dwelt in the seclusion of the\r\nforest, and who were protected from the pranks and machinations of the\r\nsavage denizens by opportune heroes of the northern race. It appears,\r\nhowever, that the native demons of the Góndwana had fascinating\r\ndaughters; for presently we find the rajahs from the north coming\r\ndown and marrying them; and finally, in the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies, the keen urgency of the conquering Mohammedans sends great\r\nnumbers of Rajpúts down into the Góndwana, and a considerable mixture\r\nof the two bloods takes place. With this incursion of Hindu peoples\r\ncome also the Hindu gods and tenets; and Mahadeo, the \"great god,\"\r\nwhose home had been the Kailas of the Himalayas, now finds himself\r\ndomesticated in the mountains of Central India. In the Mahadeo\r\nmountain is still a shrine of Siva, which is much visited by pilgrims\r\nand worshipers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GAUR, OR INDIAN BISON.]\r\n\r\nThe Gónd--he who lives back in the hills, far off from the\r\nneighborhood of the extensive planting districts, which have attracted\r\nmany of those living near them to become at least half-civilized\r\nlaborers in harvest-time--is a primitive being enough.\r\n\r\n\"Only look,\" said Bhima Gandharva, \"at that hut if you desire to see\r\nwhat is perhaps one of the most primitive houses since ever the banyan\r\ntree gave to man (as is fabled) the idea of sheltering himself from\r\nthe elements artificially.\" It was simply made of stakes driven into\r\nthe ground, between which were wattled branches. This structure was\r\nthatched with grass, and plastered with mud.\r\n\r\nThe Gónd, like the American Indian, has his little patch of grain,\r\nwhich he cultivates, however, in a fashion wholly his own. His sole\r\ninstrument of agriculture seems to be the axe. Selecting a piece of\r\nground which presents a growth of small and easily-cut saplings--and\r\nperhaps, by the way, thus destroying in a few hours a whole cargo\r\nof teak trees worth more than all the crops of his agricultural\r\nlifetime--he hews down the growth, and in the dry season sets fire to\r\nthe fallen timber. The result is a bed of ashes over a space of two or\r\nthree acres. His soil is now ready. If the patch thus prepared happens\r\nto be level, he simply flings out a few handfuls of grain, coarse\r\nrice, kútki (ponicum) or kódon (paspalum), and the thing is done. The\r\nrest is in the hands of the god who sends the rains. If the patch be\r\non a declivity, he places the grain at the upper part, where it will\r\nbe washed down by the rains over the balance of the field. Next year\r\nhe will burn some more wood--the first burning will have left many\r\ncharred stumps and trunks, which he supplements with a little wood\r\ndragged from other parts of the forest--on the same spot, and so\r\nthe next year, by which time it will become necessary to begin a new\r\nclearing, or _dhya_. The _dhya_ thus abandoned does not renew the\r\noriginal growth which clothed it, like the pinelands of the Southern\r\nUnited States, which, if allowed to run waste after having been\r\ncleared and cultivated, clothe themselves either with oaks or with a\r\nwholly different species of pine from the original growth. The waste\r\n_dhya_, which may have perhaps nourished a splendid growth of teak,\r\nbecomes now only a dense jungle.\r\n\r\nThe Gónd also raises pumpkins and beans; and this vegetable diet\r\nhe supplements with game ensnared in the _dhyas_, to which peafowl,\r\npartridges, hares and the like resort. Many of the villages, however,\r\nhave a professional huntsman, who will display the most incredible\r\npatience in waiting with his matchlock for the game to appear.\r\n\r\nBesides these articles of diet, the aborigines of the Góndwana have\r\ntheir mhowa tree, which stands them in much the same multifarious\r\nstead as the palm does to its beneficiaries. The flowers of the mhowa\r\nfall and are eaten, or are dried and pressed, being much like raisins:\r\nthey also produce a wine by fermentation and the strong liquor of the\r\nhill-people by distillation. Of the seed cakes are made, and an oil is\r\nexpressed from them which is an article of commerce.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the poor Gónd appears to have a periodical godsend\r\nresulting from a singular habit of one of the great Indian plants.\r\nThe bamboo is said to undergo a general seeding every thirty years: at\r\nthis period, although, in the mean time, many individual bamboos may\r\nhave passed through the process of reproduction, it is said that the\r\nwhole bamboo growth of a section will simultaneously drop its leaves\r\nand put forth large panicles of flowers, after which come great\r\nquantities of seeds much like rice. These are gathered for food by\r\nthe inhabitants with all the greater diligence in consequence of a\r\ntradition--which, however, does not seem to be at all supported by\r\nfacts--that the general seeding of the bamboo portends a failure of\r\nthe regular crops. The liberal forests of the Góndwana furnish still\r\nother edibles to their denizens. The ebony plums, the wild mango,\r\nthe seeds of the sál tree, the beans of the giant banhinia creeper, a\r\nspecies of arrowroot, and a wild yam, are here found and eaten.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BANJARIS.]\r\n\r\nIt is not long since the Gónds had arrived at a melancholy condition\r\nunder the baleful influences of the kulars, or liquor-dealers, who\r\nresided among them and created an extraordinary demand for their\r\nintoxicating wares by paying for service and for produce in liquor.\r\nThe kulars have, however, been thrown into the background by wise\r\nefforts toward their suppression, and matters have improved for the\r\npoor autoch-thones.\r\n\r\nWe spent our first night in our chapaya, my companion having so\r\narranged matters that we were quite independent of the bungaloos which\r\nthe Englishmen have erected at suitable distances along the great\r\nroads for the convenience of travelers. The night was clear; betwixt\r\nthe corner pillars which upheld our canopy a thousand friendly\r\nsalutations from the stars streamed in upon us; the tranquil\r\ncountenance of my friend seemed, as he lay beside me, like the face of\r\nthe Past purified of old errors and calm with great wisdom got through\r\ngreat tribulation, insomuch that betwixt the Hindu and the stars I\r\nfelt myself to be at once in communication with antiquity and with\r\neternity.\r\n\r\nThus we pursued our ambulatory meditations through the Góndwana. If\r\nwe had been sportsmen, we should have found full as varied a field for\r\nthe bagging of game as for that more spiritual hunt after new ideas\r\nand sensations in which we were engaged. Gray quail, gray partridges,\r\npainted partridges (_Francolinus pictus_), snipe and many varieties\r\nof water-fowl, the sambor, the black antelope, the Indian gazelle or\r\nravine deer, the gaur or Indian bison, chewing the cud in the midday\r\nshade or drinking from a clear stream, troops of _nilgaé_ springing\r\nout from the long grass and dwarf growth of polás and jujube trees\r\nwhich covered the sites of abandoned villages and fields,--all\r\nthese revealed themselves to us in the most tempting situations. But\r\nalthough I had been an ardent devotee of the double-barrel, the large\r\nand manly tenderness which Bhima Gandharva invariably displayed toward\r\nall animals, whether wild or tame, had wrought marvels upon me, and\r\nI had grown fairly ashamed--nay, horrified--at the idea that anything\r\nwhich a generous and brave man could call _sport_ should consist\r\nwholly in the most keen and savage cruelties inflicted upon creatures\r\nwhom we fight at the most unknightly odds, we armed, they unarmed.\r\nWhile I knew that our pleasures are by the divine order mostly\r\ndistillations from pain, I could not now help recognizing at the same\r\ntime that this circumstance was part of an enormous plan which the\r\nslaughter of innocent creatures in the way of \"sport\" did in nowise\r\nhelp to carry out.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, although I had been for some days wavering upon the\r\nbrink of these conclusions in a quiet way, I found the old keen ardor\r\nof the sportsman still burning too strongly, and I had started out\r\nwith a breech-loader, intent upon doing much of the Góndwana route gun\r\nin hand. It was not long before a thoughtless shot operated to\r\nbring my growing convictions sharply face to face with my decreasing\r\npractice, and thus to quite frown the latter out of existence. It\r\nhappened in this wise: One day, not far from sunset, I was walking\r\nidly along behind the chapaya, in which Bhima Gandharva was dreamily\r\nreclining, when suddenly a pair of great _sáras_ cranes rose from the\r\nlow banks of a small stream and sailed directly across the road. Quick\r\nas thought--indeed, quicker than thought; for if I _had_ thought, I\r\nwould not have done it--I fired, and brought down one of the monstrous\r\nbirds. As I started to approach it, Bhima Gandharva said, in a tone\r\njust a trifle graver than usual, \"Stop! wait a moment,\" and at the\r\nsame time halted the chapaya. The mate of the bird I had shot, seeing\r\nhim fall, alighted on the same spot, then flew up, then returned,\r\nflew up again, returned again, with an exhibition of sad and lingering\r\naffection of which I had not dreamed, and which penetrated me beyond\r\nexpression; so I stood half stolid outwardly and wholly ashamed\r\nand grieved inwardly. \"The sáras,\" said my friend, \"is the type of\r\nconjugal affection among the Hindus. The birds nearly always go\r\nin pairs; and when one is killed, the other invariably makes those\r\ndemonstrations of tenderness which you have just seen.\"\r\n\r\nAs we journeyed along in the dusk came notes from another pair of\r\nfeathered lovers, \"chukwa, chukwi,\" \"chukwa, chukwi,\" in a sort of\r\nmournful alternation. They were the branning ducks, he on one side,\r\nshe on the other side of the stream, as is their habit, whence they\r\nare fabled to be a pair of lovers who must yearn unavailingly through\r\nthe long nights from opposite banks of the river.\r\n\r\nThat night, when Bhima Gandharva was asleep, I gently arose, took my\r\ndouble-barrel--thou dear Manton! how often has not Jonesville admired\r\nthee returning from the field at late evening slanting at a jaunty\r\nangle high above my bagful of snipe or of quail as the case might\r\nbe!--yes, I took this love of a gun, together with the cartridges,\r\naccoutrements and all other rights, members and appurtenances\r\nthereunto belonging or in any wise appertaining, and slid the whole\r\nlot softly into a deep green pool of the very stream from which had\r\nflown my sáras.\r\n\r\nThe taste of gypsy life which I was now enjoying contributed to add\r\na sort of personal element to that general interest which hangs about\r\nthe curious Banjaris, whom we met constantly, with their families\r\nand their bullocks, along our road. _Banjara_ is literally\r\n\"forest-wanderer.\" The women were especially notable for their tall\r\nstature, shapely figures and erect carriage; which circumstances are\r\nall the more wonderful from the life of hardship which they lead,\r\nattending as they do at once to the foraging of the cattle, the\r\nculinary preparations for the men and the cares of the children. From\r\nthe profusion of ornaments which they wore, one may imagine, however,\r\nthat they were well cared for by their lords in return for their\r\naffectionate labors; and the general bearing of the tall Banjara who\r\nbore a long two-handed sword gave evidence of a certain inward sense\r\nof protection over his belongings which probably found vent in many an\r\naffectionate gift of rings and bracelets to his graceful partner. It\r\nmust be confessed that the gypsying of these Eastern Bohemians is not\r\nso free a life as is popularly supposed. The _naik_ or sovereign of\r\neach _tanda_, or camp, seems to be possessed of absolute power, and in\r\nthis connection the long two-handed sword suggested much less gentle\r\nreflections. The Banjara, however, though a nomad, is a serviceable\r\none, for he is engaged in trade. With his bullocks he is the carrier\r\nof Central India, and is to be met with all over that section,\r\nbringing salt and other commodities and returning with interior\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRA ALOYSIUS\r\n\r\n  Fra Aloysius, vexed with skeptic fears,\r\n    Nigh crazed with thought to all the saints did pray\r\n    For faith in those mysterious words that say,\r\n  \"One day is with the Lord a thousand years,\r\n    A thousand years with Him are as a day.\"\r\n\r\n  An erudite and holy monk was he,\r\n    And yet his brethren trembled lest his brain\r\n    Should lose its poise, so long he dwelt in vain\r\n  On that perplexing verse to find its key,\r\n    And strove to make its hidden meaning plain.\r\n\r\n  Racked by a sleepless night, one fresh spring morn\r\n    Forth from the cloister Aloysius strolled.\r\n    The wood was dewy-bright, clear beams of gold\r\n  Illumined it, and to his heart was borne\r\n    A sense of freedom, peace and joy untold.\r\n\r\n  Beside a laughing brook he sat to rest,\r\n    Above whose wave did long-haired willows weep;\r\n    Midmost the dense green forest, still and deep,\r\n  Lulled by the trickling waters and possessed\r\n    By tranquil thoughts, the friar fell asleep.\r\n\r\n  And, overworn, he slept the livelong day,\r\n    Nor waked until the twilight shadows fell,\r\n    That flung a brown night o'er that leafy dell.\r\n  Then up he rose refreshed and went his way,\r\n    And, half ashamed, he heard the vesper-bell.\r\n\r\n  Back to the convent fared he; at the gate\r\n    A stranger gave him entrance, but he passed\r\n    Into the chapel with meek eyes downcast,\r\n  In truant guise returning home thus late,\r\n    And toward his wonted seat made seemly haste.\r\n\r\n  Too late! a stranger filled it. Looking round,\r\n    Amazed, he could discern no face he knew.\r\n    The abbot's self had changed; his wonder grew,\r\n  When, after the familiar chant, he found\r\n    These crazy monks held him for crazy too.\r\n\r\n  They gathered round with curious, eager eyes.\r\n   \"What cloister's this?\" he asked. They named its name:\r\n    The one he left that morning was the same.\r\n  His name he gave; with many a wild surmise\r\n    They guessed who he might be and whence he came.\r\n\r\n  He asked them where the abbot was at last,\r\n    From whom he parted but the night before.\r\n   \"He hath been dead three hundred years and more!\"\r\n  They answered with a single voice, aghast.\r\n    Then spake a friar versed in monkish lore:\r\n\r\n  \"Brethren, a miracle! This man I know:\r\n   'Tis Aloysius, who, as I have read,\r\n    Beset with doubts, forth from this convent fled,\r\n  And vanished, some three hundred years ago,\r\n    And all the world hath counted him as dead.\"\r\n\r\n  Then Aloysius felt the blessed tears\r\n    Fulfill his eyes, whence dropped the scales away.\r\n    Kneeling, he cried, \"Oh, brethren, let us pray.\r\n  One day is with the Lord a thousand years,\r\n    A thousand years with Him are as a day.\"\r\n\r\nEMMA LAZARUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FEW HOURS IN BOHEMIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beauty of this country is that no turbulent sea confines its\r\nborders, nor are martello-towers needed to guard its coast: no jealous\r\nneighbor threatens its frontier, no army oppresses its citizens, and\r\nno king can usurp its throne. Its locality is hard to define: like the\r\nFata Morgana, it is here to-day and gone to-morrow, for its territory\r\nis the mind of men, and in extent it is as boundless as thought.\r\nNatives of every clime are enrolled among its freemen, and all lands\r\ncontain its representatives, but it is in the picturesque streets of\r\nthe older continental cities of Europe, where rambling lodgings and\r\ncheap apartments are many, that the invisible mother-country founds\r\nher colonies. I will tell you how I went and what I saw there.\r\n\r\nAfra was a cosmopolite, and consequently knew Bohemia, its byways and\r\nthoroughfares. If any one could fill the office of guide thereto,\r\nAfra could, and when one evening she rushed into my room saying, \"Come\r\nalong if you want to go to Bohemia,\" I did not hesitate a moment, but\r\nmade ready for the journey, with the simple precaution of putting on\r\nmy bonnet and shawl.\r\n\r\n\"A cab?\" I asked as we moved from the door.\r\n\r\n\"Who ever heard of entering Bohemia in a cab?\" laughed Afra dryly.\r\n\"People have been known to drive _out_ in their own carriages, but\r\nthey always make their first appearance there on foot, or at best in\r\nan omnibus.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you please,\" I replied, trying to keep pace with her rapid step,\r\nwhich showed constant practice.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder you did not propose a balloon,\" she continued pettishly.\r\n\"The gods don't give everything to one person: now, they give us\r\nbrains, and they give other people--money.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you would understand, I--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you wouldn't. I sha'n't ride in cabs until I can pay for them\r\nmyself; meanwhile, I have gros sous enough in my pocket for an omnibus\r\nfare, and if you have the same we will stop here.\" At this she entered\r\na bureau, and as I followed I saw her get some tickets from a man who\r\nsat behind a small counter, and then composedly sit down on a bench\r\nwhile she said, \"We shall have some time to wait for our luxury:\" then\r\nshowing me the tickets, \"Twelve and thirteen: it is a full night, and\r\nall these people ahead of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it a lottery?\" I asked ignorantly.\r\n\r\n\"Very much of a lottery,\" Afra replied grimly--\"like all the ways of\r\nBohemia, remarkably uncertain. You get a ticket for something in the\r\ngiving of the Muses, and you wait until your number is called. The\r\nworst of it is, the most unlikely people are called before you, and\r\nsome get disgusted and leave: there goes one out at the door at this\r\nmoment. Well, he may be better or he may be worse off than those who\r\nfinally win: who knows if any race is worth the running? Still, if you\r\nhave courage to hold on, I believe there is no doubt that every one\r\nultimately gets something.\" Seeing my perplexity, she twisted the\r\nround tickets between her fingers and added, \"Do not be alarmed: these\r\nare only good for a seat in the first empty 'bus that comes up. The\r\nconductor will call out the numbers in rotation, and if ours is among\r\nthem we shall go. It is frightful that you have never ridden in a 'bus\r\nbefore. I wonder where we should get ideas if we shut ourselves up in\r\ncabs and never walked or were hungry or tired, and thought only of our\r\nown comfort from morning till night? You don't know what you miss, you\r\npoor deluded, unfortunate rich people. I will tell you of something\r\nI saw the other evening; and, as it is worthy of a name, it shall be\r\ncalled 'The Romance of an Omnibus.' Listen! isn't that our numbers I\r\nheard? Yes: come quick or we shall lose our chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said I when we had successfully threaded the crowd and were\r\nseated--\"the romance.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have no idea of the fitness of things. My story is pathetic: it\r\nwill look badly to see you drowned in tears--people will stare.\"\r\n\r\n\"I promise not to cry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if you are one of those stolid, unemotional beings who are never\r\nmoved, I sha'n't waste my tale upon you. Wait until to-morrow: we\r\nwill get Monsieur C---- to recount, and you shall hear something worth\r\nlistening to. He is a regular troubadour--has the same artless vanity\r\nthey were known to possess, their charming simplicity, their\r\ngestures, and their power of investing everything with romance. One is\r\ntransported to the Middle Ages while he speaks: no book written on the\r\nsubject could so fully give you the flavor of the times. He recalls\r\nFroissart. If you are not affected by C----'s stories, you had better\r\npretend to be. But that, I am sure, will not be necessary: a great\r\ntragedian was lost when he became a great painter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Might I ask how and when and where I am to meet this wonderful man?\"\r\n\r\n\"At the garden-party.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what way am I to get there?\"\r\n\r\n\"By strategy. There is a little reunion to-night of what may be called\r\nfemale Bohemians. They are going to settle the preliminaries of this\r\nparty, and if you happen to be present they will invite you; not that\r\nthey particularly care for your company, but because, as I said, you\r\nhappen to be there. Only don't get yourself into a mess by tramping on\r\nany one's toes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have they corns?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, on every inch of surface: they are dreadfully thin-skinned. But\r\nthey hate sham even more than a hard knock, and are quicker than\r\na police-officer in detecting it; so be careful not to talk about\r\nanything you are ignorant of.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me a few rules, and I promise to conduct myself properly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't be snobbish and patronize them, and don't look shocked\r\nat any strange opinions you hear, nor act as if you were at an animal\r\nshow and were wondering what would happen next. Be sure not to assent\r\nwhen you see they wish to argue, and don't argue when they expect\r\nacquiescence. If any of them speak in broken English, and you can't\r\nfor the life of you understand, don't ask them to repeat, but answer\r\nimmediately, for you can imagine when one has taken pains to learn a\r\nforeign language one likes it to be appreciated, and don't--But here\r\nwe are. In short, make yourself at home, as if you had been there all\r\nyour life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Afra,\" I said, laying my hand on her arm as she took to her swift\r\npace again, \"perhaps I had better go home: I am afraid I can't--I\r\nthink--that is--\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! as if you could not get on after all those hints! Anyway,\r\nyou cannot return alone, and I am unable to go with you. Make up your\r\nmind to blunder, and do it. There was an amateur visited the studio\r\nabout three months ago: her absurdities have lasted us for laughing\r\nmaterial ever since. As she is getting rather stale, you can take her\r\nplace. This is the house: come in.\"\r\n\r\nWith this doubtful prospect in view I followed my peremptory guide\r\nfrom the narrow street into what appeared to be a spacious court, but\r\nas the only light it received was from a blinking candle in the window\r\nof the conciergerie, I could not determine. After exchanging some\r\ncabalistic sentences with a toothless old woman, the proprietor of the\r\ncandle, Afra turned to the right, and walking a few steps came to a\r\ndoor opening on a stairway, which we mounted. I can think of nothing\r\nblack enough for comparison with the darkness surrounding us. At last\r\na faint glimmer showed an old lamp standing in a corner of a hall bare\r\nand carpetless. A series of doors flanked the place, looking to my\r\nunaccustomed eyes all alike, but Afra without a moment's hesitation\r\nwent to one of them and knocked. It was opened by a lady, who smiled\r\nand said, \"Enter. You are just in time: school is over and the model\r\nabout going.\"\r\n\r\nI found myself in a high-ceiled room, at one end of which was\r\nsuspended a row of perhaps a dozen lamps. Here, at least, there was-no\r\nlack of light: it required some moments to accustom our eyes to the\r\nsudden contrast. The yellow blaze was directed by reflectors into the\r\nspace immediately beneath the lamps, which left the rest of the room\r\npleasantly tempered. Some easels, a few chairs and screens, plaster\r\ncasts on shelves, sketches in all stages of progress on the wall,\r\na tea-kettle singing over a bright fire in a stove, and a curtain\r\nenclosing a corner used as a bedroom, completed the list of furniture.\r\nIt was a night-school for lady artists. The class had finished for the\r\nevening, and a number of the students were moving about or seated near\r\nthe fire, talking in an unlimited number of languages.\r\n\r\nI was given several random introductions, and did my best to follow\r\nAfra's directions; but there was an indescribable quaintness about the\r\nappearance and manners of my new acquaintance that made it difficult\r\nnot to stare. I found, however, that little notice was taken of me,\r\nas a lively discussion was being carried on over a study of an arm and\r\nhand which one of them was holding up for inspection.\r\n\r\n\"It is a style I should call the lantern,\" said she. \"The redness of\r\nthe flesh can only be accounted for on the supposition that a light is\r\nshining through it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should call it raw beef,\" remarked another.\r\n\r\n\"It is a shame, mademoiselle!\" began the model in an injured tone.\r\nShe had been tying on her bonnet before a bit of looking-glass she\r\nhad taken from her pocket. \"Does my arm look like that?\" Here she\r\nindignantly drew up her sleeve and held out that dimpled member,\r\nmeanwhile gazing wrathfully at the sketch. \"It ought not to be\r\nallowed. The silver tones of my flesh are entirely lost; and see how\r\nyou have caricatured the elegance of my beautiful hand. Will not some\r\none help mademoiselle to put it right before my reputation is ruined?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jeanne, a model is not a critic,\" said the author of the drawing,\r\ncoming forward and grasping the canvas with no gentle hand.--\"Ladies,\r\nif you wish to find fault, turn to your own studies. That proportion\r\nis frightful\"--she pointed to different sketches as she spoke--\"that\r\near is too large; and, madame, if you take a crust of paint like yours\r\nfor freedom of touch, I pity you.\"\r\n\r\nThis dispute was by no means the last during the evening. Opinions\r\nseemed to be plentiful in Bohemia, each individual being furnished\r\nwith a set of her own on every subject broached; and as no diffidence\r\nwas shown in putting them forth, the company quarreled with great\r\ngood-nature and evident enjoyment. A pot of tea was then brewed by the\r\nowner of the studio, who had been English before she became Bohemian,\r\nand the beverage was handed round in tea-cups which, like the opinions\r\nof the guests, differed widely from each other. In the silence that\r\nattended this diversion Afra took the floor and said, \"How about the\r\ngarden-party to the country? Who is going?\"\r\n\r\nSeveral spoke, and one asked, \"Shall we take lunch with us?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, something will be provided for us there.\"\r\n\r\n\"So much the better. When are we to meet, and where?\"\r\n\r\n\"Twelve o'clock, midday, at ----.\"\r\n\r\n\"What messieurs are going?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite a number--a tenor from the Grand Opera, and the leader of the\r\norchestra, who is a magnificent violinist; that new Spanish painter\r\nwho plays the guitar divinely; a poet--that is, he has written some\r\npretty songs--besides plenty more.\"\r\n\r\n\"That promises well.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will bring your friend?\" and the speaker nodded her head toward\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"I shall be delighted: I am so curious to see those eccentric--\" Here\r\na warning glance from Afra stopped me.\r\n\r\nBut the lady only laughed and said, \"You will see eccentricity enough\r\nto-morrow, if that is what you want. People who devote their minds to\r\ngreat objects have no time to think of little things. You had better\r\nsee that Afra has on her bonnet or she will go without one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" replied Afra.--\"Miss,\" this to the owner of the studio,\r\nwho was so called in honor of her English birth, \"are you ever\r\ntroubled by the ghost of that young painter who hung himself up\r\nthere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Those who have occasion to commit suicide are not likely to come\r\nback: they have had enough of this world,\" said the Englishwoman.\r\n\r\n\"Did some one really die here?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, really;\" and Afra mimicked my tone of horror. \"You know, a\r\nBohemian is at home anywhere, so a change of country don't affect him\r\nmuch. If we find a place disagreeable, we travel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was he insane?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not more than the rest of us, but _you_ can't understand the feeling\r\nthat would induce a man to do such a thing. This young fellow painted\r\na picture: he put his mind, his soul, himself, into it, and sent it to\r\nthe Exhibition. It was rejected--that is, he was rejected--and he came\r\nhere and died. They found him suspended from that beam where the lamps\r\nhang now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought your Bohemia was so gay?\"\r\n\r\n\"So it is, but the brightest light makes the deepest shadows.\"\r\n\r\nThe conversation went on. These ladies discussed politics, literature,\r\nart and society with absolute confidence. One of the topics was Alfred\r\nde Musset. The Englishwoman was praising the English Alfred, when\r\na pale-faced girl, who up to this moment had been intently reading,\r\noblivious of all about her, closed her book with a snap (it was a\r\nmuch-worn edition of one of the classics, bought for a few sous on the\r\nquay) and broke out with--\"Your Tennyson is childish. His King Arthur\r\nputs me in mind of our Louis Philippe and his umbrella. Did you know\r\nLouis carried an umbrella with him when he was obliged to fly from\r\nParis? One would have looked well held over Arthur's dragon helmet\r\nthat disagreeable night he left the queen to go and fight his nephew.\r\nBut perhaps Guinevere had lent it to Launcelot, and even the best\r\nfriends, alas! do not return umbrellas. Your poet writes in white\r\nkid gloves, and thinks in them too. Imagine the magnificent rush and\r\nstruggle of those ancient days, the ecstasy of battle, the intensity\r\nof life, and then read your Tennyson's milk-and-water tales, with\r\ntheir modern English-ménage feelings. Arthur would have been much more\r\nlikely to give his wife a beating, as did the hero of the _Nibelungen\r\nLied_, than that high-flown lecture; and it would have done the\r\nGuinevere of that time more good.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is your Alfred, Anita?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is divine.\"\r\n\r\n\"After the heathen pattern. He dipped his pen in mire.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is mire?--water and earth. What are we?--water and earth. Mire\r\nis humanity, and holds in itself not only the roots of the tree,\r\nbut the germ of the flower. A poet who is too delicate to plant\r\nhis thought in earth must be content to give it but the life of a\r\nparasite: it can have no separate existence of its own.\"\r\n\r\n\"But one need not be bad to be great.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor need one be good to be great,\" returned Anita sarcastically.\r\n\"Alfred de Musset was a peculiar type of a peculiar time. He did not\r\nimagine: he felt, he lived, he was himself, and was original, like a\r\nnew variety of flower or a new species of insect. Tennyson has gleaned\r\nfrom everybody's fields: our Alfred gathered only from his own. The\r\none is made, the other is born.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come away,\" said Afra impatiently: \"no one can speak while Anita\r\nis on her hobby. Besides, I must get home early to trim a bonnet for\r\nto-morrow;\" and without more leavetaking than a \"Good-evening,\" which\r\nincluded every one, we found ourselves in the street.\r\n\r\n\"Who is Anita?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"She is nobody just now: what she will be remains to be seen. Her\r\nfamily wish her to be an artist: she wishes to adopt the stage as a\r\nprofession, and is studying for it _sub rosa_. Did you ever see a more\r\ntragic face?\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor thing!\" I involuntarily exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Don't pity her,\" said Afra, more seriously than she had yet spoken.\r\n\"The best gift that can be bestowed upon a mortal is a strong natural\r\ninclination for any particular life and the opportunity of following\r\nit. The man or woman who has that can use the wheel of Fate for a\r\nspinning-wheel.\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning at the appointed time I met Afra at the station.\r\n\"How do I look?\" she asked, standing up for my inspection as soon as I\r\nappeared in sight, at the same time regarding as much of her dress as\r\nit was possible for her to see. But before I could reply the satisfied\r\nexpression of her face changed: an unpleasant discovery had been\r\nmade. \"I have shoes on that are not mates,\" she exclaimed--\"cloth and\r\nleather: that looks rather queer, doesn't it? Do you think it will be\r\nnoticed? I could not decide which pair to wear, and put on one of each\r\nto see the effect: afterward I forgot them. Now, I suppose that would\r\nbe thought eccentric, though any one might make the same mistake. It\r\nshows I have two pairs of shoes,\" she added more cheerfully, \"and they\r\nare both black. How is my bonnet?\"\r\n\r\nThe bonnet was black velvet, and we were in midsummer. The material,\r\nhowever, was skillfully draped with a veil, and a profusion of pink\r\nflowers gave it a seasonable air. A crimson bow was also tied at\r\nher neck; she complacently remarked that \"pink and crimson harmonize\r\nbeautifully;\" and others of the party arriving at that moment, I was\r\nsaved the trouble of making a polite answer.\r\n\r\nThe ride through ripening grain-fields and moss-thatched hamlets\r\nneed not be described; suffice it to say, it was France and June. An\r\nomnibus was waiting at the station where we dismounted: it carried us\r\nnear, but not to, our destination. After leaving it we walked through\r\nthe streets of a low-roofed village, then followed a path bordered\r\nwith wild mignonette and apple trees that wound up the side of a hill\r\ncovered with vineyards. A couple of chattering magpies ran before\r\nus, an invisible cuckoo was heard between snatches of Italian melody\r\nwarbled by the tenor _sotto voce_ and the little company overflowed\r\nwith gayety.\r\n\r\nThe house we arrived at looked as if it might be a castle in the air\r\nmaterialized--pointed windows hidden in ivy, through which you saw\r\nthe chintz-covered walls of the interior; turrets on the roof and\r\na stair-tower; odd nooks for pigeons and cattle; the color a\r\nweather-toned red, met by gray roofs, green trees and blue sky. We\r\npassed through it to the quaint garden: rows of dwarf pears bordered\r\nits paths, and trellises and walls supported nectarines and vines,\r\nwith sunshine and shadow caressing the half-ripe fruit.\r\n\r\nThe shady spaces were occupied by guests who had arrived before us,\r\nand we saw with pleasure that ceremony had not been invited to attend.\r\nThe host's kindly manner was sufficient to put the company at once\r\nat ease. We wandered at will from group to group, listening or\r\nconversing: introductions were sometimes given, but more often not.\r\n\r\nAt one table some ladies and gentlemen were playing the artistic game\r\nof \"five points.\" A more difficult pastime was never invented. The\r\nmaterials necessary are simply a piece of paper and a pencil: it is\r\ntheir use that is extraordinary. A person puts five dots on the paper\r\nin whatever position fancy may dictate: on this slight foundation\r\nanother is expected to design a figure, the puzzle being to include\r\nall the marks given. One that I saw had four of the dots placed\r\nunusually close together, and the fifth in a distant corner:\r\nthis latter, in the opinion of the lookers-on, would surely prove\r\nrefractory. After some moments of consideration, with pencil suspended\r\nand eye attentive, the artist commenced drawing. In ten minutes the\r\nsketch was finished. It was an angel: her upturned head took in the\r\nhighest of the group of dots; one hand hanging by her side the next;\r\na knee the third; and the flowing hem of her robe the fourth; but the\r\nfifth in the corner--what could reach it? With a touch of the pencil\r\nthe angel's other hand appeared flinging up a censer attached to\r\na long chain, which struck the solitary dot like a shot amid\r\nacclamations. To show that he did not consider the feat a _tour de\r\nforce_, the artist turned the paper, and taking the same marks drew\r\na devil in an entirely different attitude, the difficult point being\r\nreached by his pitchfork. This gave rise to a learned discussion as\r\nto whether the devil's emblematic pitchfork was not a descendant of\r\nNeptune's trident, which I did not stay to hear, as Afra whispered she\r\nwanted to present me to Monsieur C----, and I was taken to a gentleman\r\nof no great height, but of such wondrous width that Nature must have\r\nformed him in a most generous mood.\r\n\r\n\"You are American?\" said this wide man to me as I was introduced, and\r\nwithout waiting for a reply went on: \"I like your country-people:\r\nthey admire frankly. Show them a picture, they exclaim, 'Beautiful!\r\nmagnificent! lovely! exquisite! name your price;' and they buy it.\r\nHere the public look and look. 'Not bad,' they say, 'but the color is\r\nfrom Veronese, and that attitude is surely Raphael's. What a mine that\r\nman's genius has been to ambitious but less gifted artists!' and so\r\nthey go on. I wish they would let the dead rest in peace. Are you\r\nacquainted with Mr. B---- of New York?\"\r\n\r\nI was obliged to say \"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish to send a message to him,\" he continued grandly: \"tell him\r\nthat I paint now for him alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are court-painter to Mr. B----,\" I remarked laughingly.\r\n\r\n\"Don't speak of courts,\" he exclaimed pettishly. \"I was to have\r\npainted the baptism of the prince imperial for the state: it gave me\r\nno end of annoyance, and in the end was never finished.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understood that you insisted on painting the little prince nude,\r\nafter the Rubens manner, and that was one ground of objection to the\r\ndesign,\" said Afra.\r\n\r\n\"The baby would have had on plenty of clothes: one of his dresses was\r\nsent from the Tuileries for Monsieur C---- to paint, and I sewed a\r\nrosette on it myself.\" This from the painter's wife.\r\n\r\n\"A countryman of yours sat for the head of a young priest at the\r\nceremony. He had a fine countenance: he was studying art with me\r\nat the time, and has since been professor of drawing at your Naval\r\nAcademy. Teaching is a sad trade--Pegasus dragging the plough.\"\r\n\r\n\"At least, your other great picture brought you nothing but praise.\"\r\n\r\n\"The public have since repented of being so good to me. Then, they\r\ncould not say enough in my favor: now, if a person asks what I am\r\ndoing, every one repeats like a parrot, 'C---- doesn't paint, C----\r\ndoesn't paint.' I have heard it so often that I begin to believe\r\nit myself, and when I am asked join the general cry, 'C---- doesn't\r\npaint.'\"\r\n\r\nI laughed, thinking this a joke, but I soon found that though\r\nC---- might be cynical, sarcastic or bitter, though he might excite\r\nunintentional laughter by his remarks, he was too sensitive a man to\r\ntake any but a serious view of life. The imperfections of the world\r\nexcited his disgust, his anger, never his mirth.\r\n\r\n\"Ah but, monsieur,\" said Afra, \"you should be satisfied, and leave\r\nsome little honor for the rest of us to gather. The stories one hears\r\nof your youth are like fairy-tales.\"\r\n\r\n\"And they are true,\" replied the artist with evident enjoyment. \"In\r\nthose days I was pointed out to people when I walked the street;\r\nwhich, by the way, gave rise to an odd incident. A gentleman thought\r\nhe had seen me in a crowd, but he had taken an older and taller man\r\nfor the great painter. He believed big pictures were painted by big\r\nmen, and I had not then my present circumference. This gentleman sent\r\nme an invitation to dine with him. On the day appointed I arrived at\r\nthe house, and was met at the door by my host, a look of surprise and\r\nannoyance on his face which he tried to conceal by a low bow, at the\r\nsame time asking politely, 'How is your father?'--'Very well, thank\r\nyou,' I returned, although I could not understand why my father's\r\nhealth should be a matter of interest to him.--'You have come to\r\ntell me of some catastrophe which prevents his attendance here\r\nto-day?'--'Not at all: I have come to dine with you, according to this\r\ninvitation.' Here I pulled out the card, which I happened to have in\r\nmy pocket.--'Are you the person here addressed?' he said, staring at\r\nme.--'I am'.--'I beg your pardon, there is a mistake: I meant it for\r\nyour father, the painter of the \"Décadence des Romains.\"'--'I am the\r\npainter of the \"Décadence,\" but I am not my father.'--'You ought to\r\nbe an older man.'--'I should have been, monsieur, had I been born\r\nsooner.'--At that moment a friend, overhearing the conversation and\r\ndivining the cause, came and explained to my wonder-struck host that I\r\nwas really the artist in question. With many apologies I was led into\r\na hall adorned with floral arches in my honor, next to a beautiful\r\nsalon, likewise decorated, and finally we reached the dining-room,\r\nwhich was arranged to represent my picture. Columns wreathed with\r\nflowers supported the roof; flowers festooned the white table-linen\r\nand adorned the antique vessels that covered it; couches of different\r\ncolored silk were laid after the Roman fashion for the guests to\r\nrecline upon; and lovely women dressed in costly Roman costumes, their\r\nheads crowned with flowers, were placed in the attitudes that you\r\nwill see on my celebrated canvas. Was it not a graceful tribute to my\r\ngenius?\"\r\n\r\n\"If a Frenchman wants to pay a compliment, he never uses one that has\r\ndone duty before, but invents something new,\" said Afra emphatically.\r\n\r\n\"What are you painting now, monsieur?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"A series of pictures called 'Pierrot the Clown.' He succeeds in\r\ntricking the world in every station of life. I am just finishing his\r\ndeathbed. All his friends are weeping about him: the doctor feels\r\nhis pulse and gives some learned name to the disease--doctors know so\r\nmuch--while hidden everywhere around the room are empty bottles. The\r\ndrunken clown plays with even death for a mask.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought he painted such romantic pictures,\" said I to Afra as we\r\nturned from the master.\r\n\r\n\"So he does: there is one in his studio now. A girl clad in gray and\r\nshadow--open-air shade which in his hands is so clear and luminous.\r\nShe walks along a garden-path, her head bent down, dreaming as she\r\ngoes, and unconsciously nearing a half-open gateway, through which the\r\nsunshine is streaming. Above the rustic gate two doves are billing and\r\ncooing. You feel sure the girl is about to pass through this typical,\r\nsunshiny, invitingly half-open door; and--what is beyond?\"\r\n\r\nJust then we were called to lunch, a plentiful but not luxurious\r\nrepast. There was no lack of lively repartees and anecdotes, and\r\nwe had speeches and songs afterward. I wonder if I ever heard \"'Tis\r\nbetter to laugh than be sighing\" given with more zest than on that\r\nday? One could easily imagine that it was such an occasion as this\r\nthat had inspired it.\r\n\r\nLunch being over, Monsieur C---- was asked to relate one of his own\r\nstories. I cannot give it entire, but the plot was this: A pilgrim,\r\nwhom he called poor Jacques, hearing much of heaven, set out to find\r\nhis way to the blessed abode, with only a little dog to accompany him\r\non the journey. As he went he met many of his contemporaries, who\r\nhad made what a walker would style but poor time. The allusions to\r\nwell-known peculiarities in the various people and their occupation in\r\nthe other life caused much amusement. For instance, Ingres the painter\r\nwas seated by the roadside playing Rossini's music on the violin, on\r\nwhich instrument he was a great proficient. But he was known to detest\r\nthe Italian's music before he started heavenward: his taste must then\r\nhave grown _en route_. (Critics might object to this supposition.)\r\nHowever, Jacques was anxious to push on, and spent little time\r\nlistening. But he was a good-hearted man, and, though he would\r\nnot delay for his own amusement, he could not refuse to stop when\r\nfellow-pilgrims asked him for assistance. Little children were\r\ncontinually straying from the path, and without Jacques and his little\r\ndog would inevitably have been lost. Feeble old people were standing\r\nlooking with despair at some obstacle that without Jacques's friendly\r\narm they would have found it impossible to pass. Young men who never\r\nlooked where they were walking were continually calling on him for a\r\nhand to help them out of the ditch where they had fallen; and young\r\ngirls--well, one would have supposed they had never been given feet\r\nof their own to walk with, from the trouble they were to poor Jacques.\r\nThe worst of it was, that when all these good people were well over\r\ntheir troubles they called Jacques a simpleton for his pains, and\r\nrefused to have any intercourse with him, giving him the worst side of\r\nthe road and laughing at his old-fashioned staff and scrip, and even\r\nat his little dog, to which they gave many a sly kick. Nor was it\r\nany wonder, for there were many in the company robed in silk, wearing\r\nprecious stones and with well-filled wallets by their sides. Jacques\r\nwas but human, and often he wished he had never set out for heaven at\r\nall in such company; but even in their bitterest moods neither\r\nJacques nor the little dog could ever hear a cry of distress without\r\nforgetting all unkindness and rushing at once to the rescue.\r\n\r\nThese labors exhausted Jacques's strength: the little dog, too, was\r\nworn to a shadow, and so timid from ill-treatment that it was only\r\nwhen some great occasion called out his mettle that you saw what a\r\nnoble little dog-heart he had. He did his best to comfort his master,\r\nbut when Jacques's sandals were worn out and his cloak in rags, and\r\nwhen he looked forward and saw nothing yet of the holy city in view,\r\nthough he still tried to go forward, Nature gave way: he sank to the\r\nground, and the little dog licked his hands in vain to awaken him.\r\n\r\nThere is a band of angels who each night descend the holy mount\r\nwhereon is built the city, in search of such pilgrims as have failed\r\nthrough fatigue to reach the gate. They are clothed in robes woven of\r\ngood deeds, which never lose their lustre, for they are renewed every\r\nday. It was this company which found Jacques in his swoon by the\r\nroadside. One gently touched his tired body, and more than the vigor\r\nof youth leapt through his veins. Another whispered \"Come,\" and he\r\nrose and walked with them. As he moved on with eyes abashed, thinking\r\nof the rents in his garments and regretting their poverty, he noticed\r\nthat they too were changed, and were as bright as those of his\r\ncompanions. \"Who has done this?\" he said, venturing to address the\r\none that walked at his right hand. \"You wore them always,\" he answered\r\nwith an angelic smile, \"but it is this light which shows their\r\nbeauty;\" and he pointed to that which streamed from the celestial\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nThere was much applause. I saw Afra wipe a tear from her eye; only, a\r\nthin-faced individual who sat near me whispered that it was too long.\r\nThe delicacy and pathos of expression and language it is impossible\r\nto give, and, though old in form, the story was skillfully new in\r\nincident; nor must I forget that the little dog slipped through the\r\neternal gate with his master. Some one asked the troubadour why he\r\ndid not write it out. He shook his head and threw up his hands as\r\nhe replied, \"I wrote one book and gave it to a literary man for\r\ncorrection. You should have seen the manuscript when he sent it home:\r\nnot a page but was scarred and cut. He called that 'style.' Now, what\r\ndid I want with style? I wanted to write as I talked.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said one. \"What did you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I quickly put Monsieur le Rédacteur's style out of my book; then\r\nI published it. George Sand promised to write the preface, but some\r\nbusybody told her that I was attacking the whole world, so she would\r\nhave nothing to do with it. She was misled: I blamed nothing in my\r\nbook but what deserved censure.\"\r\n\r\nHaving heard this excellent representation of the ancient minstrel,\r\nwe were shortly given a touch of the modern usurper of the name. A\r\ngentleman was present who in the many turns of Fortune's wheel had\r\nonce found himself a follower of the burnt-cork persuasion. He gave us\r\na negro melody with a lively accompaniment on the guitar. A melancholy\r\nSpanish song followed. The company again dispersed into congenial\r\ngroups, and in the long twilight you heard the murmur of voices broken\r\nby occasional snatches of melody or the nightingale's song.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"And what do you think of Bohemia?\" asked Afra as we returned that\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\"It is different from what I expected. They are refined, and, though\r\nfrank, never rude. I think--\"\r\n\r\nAfra laughed: \"You had unconsciously thought them a set of sharpers;\r\nbut there is a great difference between living by your brains and\r\nliving by your wits. My dear, you have broken bread with giants\r\nto-day: such men live in another world that they may rule this one.\"\r\n\r\nITA ANIOL PROKOP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR AND TEACHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two words that recur most frequently perhaps in the discussion of\r\nmatters of education are \"teacher\" and \"professor;\" yet there are\r\nno two that are used so carelessly and loosely. It seems as if the\r\nthought that they may not be synonymous seldom, if ever, occurs to\r\nthose using them. If one of our writers or speakers upon education\r\nwere suddenly called upon to state exactly what he meant by a\r\n\"professor\" in distinction from a \"teacher,\" he would be at a loss for\r\nan answer. He might reply, after some hesitation, \"Why, a teacher is\r\na man who teaches at a school or an academy, and a professor is a man\r\nwho teaches at a college.\" If he were pressed still more closely, and\r\nasked to give the precise difference between a \"school or an academy\"\r\nand a \"college,\" it is safe to assume that he would find himself\r\nnonplussed. There are colleges in the country, some large and others\r\nsmall, some old and others young, some good and others poor; but aside\r\nfrom the fact that they provide a curriculum of four years and teach\r\na certain amount of Latin, Greek and mathematics, they do not possess\r\nfeatures enough in common to enable us to define with exactness \"a\r\ncollege.\" It is not in the power of language to devise a formula so\r\nelastic as to embrace Harvard, Brown, Princeton, Trinity, Cornell\r\nand Michigan University, without at the same time ignoring the\r\ncharacteristic features of one or the other. Even if we admit that\r\nthere is a vague ideal unity underlying the so-called college system,\r\nby virtue of which it is a system and not a mere aggregate, we shall\r\nnot make much progress in our search after the proper definition\r\nof the term \"professor.\" The utmost that can be said of our college\r\nsystem, as a system, is that it stands on a somewhat higher plane than\r\nthe schools, that it is supposed to finish a young man's education,\r\nand consequently that the men whom it employs for such a purpose--its\r\nprofessors--are, or at least ought to be, abler men than the teachers\r\nproper. The difference, then, between professor and teacher is one of\r\ndegree, and not of kind. Both teach, and both teach in great part the\r\nsame subjects and in substantially the same way; that is, by means\r\nof textbook and recitation. Herein lies the explanation of the\r\ndisposition evinced by some of our best schools to call their teachers\r\n\"professors.\" An institution like Phillips Exeter or Andover can\r\nscarcely be said to assume more than it is entitled to in putting\r\nitself on an equality with Hobart College or Racine.\r\n\r\nOn turning to Germany, we observe no such laxity in the use of the\r\nterm \"professor.\" He, and he only, is professor who \"professes\" to\r\nhave made himself eminent in his special branch, and whose claims have\r\nbeen allowed officially by a university or by the government. He is\r\nnot even a teacher in the English or American sense. He is a scholar\r\nand investigator who has produced results worthy of distinction, and\r\nit is upon the strength of those results, and not because of his real\r\nor supposed ability to impart knowledge and stimulate industry among\r\nstudents, that he receives his call to a university chair.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The circumstance that some of the gymnasium-teachers in\r\nGermany have the title of \"professor\" does not affect the above view.\r\nThe title has been expressly conferred upon them by the government as\r\na mark of special distinction, either for long services or for unusual\r\nscholarship--in most cases for the latter. Where schools of the\r\nhighest order are so numerous as they are in Germany, it is not\r\nsurprising that they should count among their teachers men of profound\r\nscholarship. The official recognition paid to such men is only an\r\nadditional proof of the care with which the title is used. It is given\r\nto the teacher, not so much because he is a good teacher, as because\r\nhe has done something over and above school-room work.]\r\n\r\nThe words of one who is himself a leading professor in one of the\r\nmost renowned universities are so explicit upon this point that they\r\ndeserve to be translated and carefully studied. Heinrich von Sybel, in\r\nhis academic address delivered at Bonn in 1868, says: \"The excellence\r\nof our universities is to be found in the fact that they are not\r\nmere institutions where instruction is given, but are workshops\r\nof science[2]--that their vital principle is unceasing scientific\r\nproductivity. Hence it is that the state assembles the best men of\r\nall Germany as professors at its universities, so that the phenomenon,\r\ncommon enough in England and France, of a distinguished savant without\r\na university chair is with us a very unusual exception. Hence it is\r\nthat in appointing to such a chair the first and last demand is for\r\npublished evidences of such activity. As for the so-called ability to\r\nteach _(Lehrtalent im formellen Sinne),_ we are satisfied if it is not\r\nutterly and notoriously wanting. The question upon which everything\r\nturns is, Has the candidate given evidence of his capacity for\r\noriginal investigation and production? Whoever has this capacity\r\nis sufficiently qualified, according to our German notions, for\r\nfulfilling the essential function of university instruction.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Science_ is used here in the broad German sense to\r\ndenote any study, whether in the direction of natural phenomena,\r\nhistory or philosophy, which is pursued systematically and with a view\r\nto eliciting truth.]\r\n\r\nIn other words, a German professor is a man who has devoted himself\r\nto special and original research--to \"science\" as Von Sybel uses the\r\nterm--and whose discoveries and works give strength and increase of\r\ndignity to the university with which he is connected. He is\r\nappointed upon his merits as a discoverer or an author. The further\r\nconsideration--namely, whether he is what we Americans style a \"good\r\nteacher\"--was not so much as an afterthought in the minds of those who\r\ngave him his call. The explanation of this disregard of the personal\r\nelement in the professorial character is obvious. The professor is not\r\ncalled upon to teach. It does not constitute any part of his vocation\r\nto spur up the sluggish, to keep the idle busy, to give each student\r\nenough to do, and make first principles perfectly clear to all. So far\r\nfrom coming down to the level of the students, the professor expects\r\nthat the students will make every possible exertion to rise to his\r\nlevel, while he himself can scarcely be said to lend a helping hand.\r\nTo the sentimentalist, then, he might appear a very selfish mortal.\r\nBut by going beneath the surface of the relation between professor and\r\nstudent, and examining into its essence, we shall find that it is an\r\neminently healthful relation, because it is based upon the recognition\r\nof mutual rights and duties. The professor, as a man of science, has a\r\nright to the free direction of his talents. The student has the right\r\nto develop what there is in him without supervision or interference.\r\nHe is to make a man of himself by seeking diligently after the truth\r\nin a manly, independent spirit. All that the professor can do for him\r\nis to point out the road to the truth.\r\n\r\nThis view of the functions of a professor may appear obscure and\r\nexaggerated to one who has not studied at a German university. But it\r\ngives the clew to the entire German system of university education,\r\nand accounts in great part for the high standard of scholarship. Only\r\nin part, for the innate proneness of the German mind to research must\r\nbe credited with some share in the result. It is safe to say that\r\nGermany, under any system, would be a land of erudition.\r\n\r\nHowever pleasant it might be to go into the details of the\r\nprofessional position and character in Germany, it will be more\r\nprofitable, and certainly more practical, to compare this fundamental\r\nGerman idea, as already given, with the salient features of\r\nprofessional life in America. The American professor, then, is a\r\nteacher. Unless he is the fortunate occupant of an exceptionally\r\nfavored chair, his chief, and even his sole, function in the college\r\nbody is to teach, in the strictest sense of the term. He has to\r\nprescribe textbooks, assign and hear lessons, grade recitations, mark\r\nexamination-papers, submit carefully prepared term and annual reports\r\nto the faculty. When the question of conditioning or dismissing a\r\nstudent on the ground of defective scholarship comes up for decision,\r\nhis opinion must be given and weighed in connection with that of\r\nothers, in order that the faculty may strike a fair general average.\r\nThe number of hours that he is compelled, by the college curriculum,\r\nto pass per week in the recitation-room is seldom less than fifteen,\r\nand may be as high as twenty. The classes themselves are ill-sorted\r\nand often troublesome, and are usually unwieldy by reason of their\r\nsize. The professor's mind must be continually on the watch to prevent\r\ndisorder and enforce attention. Besides, as every one knows full well\r\nwho has tried it, there is nothing so exhausting as to supply \"brains\"\r\nto those who either have not received their portion from Nature or\r\nelse have squandered it for a mess of pottage. Every professor-teacher\r\ncan bear witness to the truism that one hour in the recitation-room\r\nis fully equal, in its drain upon the vital energy, to two passed in\r\nprivate study or authorship. The sense of responsibility, we might\r\nsay, is omnipresent. It does not cease with the recitation: it follows\r\nhim to his study, and haunts him with the recollection of absurd\r\nblunders made by young men who should have done better--the\r\ndispiriting reflection that despite his best efforts the stupid and\r\nindifferent will not learn. If to this normal wear and tear and these\r\nevery-day annoyances we add the participation in what is\r\npleasingly styled enforcement of discipline--that is, protracted\r\nfaculty-meetings, interviews with anxious or irate parents,\r\nexhortations to the vicious to mend their ways--we shall probably come\r\nto the conclusion that the professor's burden is anything but light.\r\nWe all have heavy burdens. But while admitting the universality of the\r\nadage, we are nevertheless at liberty to ascertain if we cannot make\r\nthe burden of a particular man or class easier to bear by fitting it\r\nto the back.\r\n\r\nEditors, essayists, college presidents and reformers assure us that\r\nwe are on the verge of a change, and perhaps a great change, in our\r\nsystem of higher education. They dilate upon the indisputable fact\r\nthat most of our older colleges have made rapid strides within\r\nthe past ten years, augmenting their endowments, erecting handsome\r\nbuildings, establishing new departments of study and increasing the\r\nnumber of students. Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth, Amherst, Princeton,\r\nColumbia, the University of Pennsylvania, were never so well off, in\r\npoint of money and men, as they are at this day. The inference is, of\r\ncourse, if so much has been done in ten years, what may we not expect\r\nby the end of the century? The University of Virginia holds its own,\r\nnotwithstanding the desolation wrought by the late civil war, and Ann\r\nArbor and Cornell have shot up with extraordinary vigor. There can be\r\nno doubt that our institutions of learning are full of robust life.\r\nAnd it is no less certain that this growth of resources is due to\r\nprivate enterprise. Our colleges have grown because graduates, and\r\neven non-graduates, have taken an interest in them, and endowed them\r\nwith a munificence which seems incredible to a Frenchman or a German.\r\nBut in studying the aspect of higher education it behooves us not to\r\nlose sight of the fundamental principle that education is something\r\nspiritual in its nature, and that it cannot be gauged by buildings,\r\nby endowments, by the trappings of wealth--in short, by anything\r\nmaterial. Endowments and buildings are only the means; unless the\r\nend to which these means are subservient be clearly perceived and\r\npersistently followed, the means themselves may prove a hindrance\r\nrather than a help. Of this Oxford is a notable proof.\r\n\r\nHave, then, the end and aim, the method and agencies, of college\r\ninstruction changed essentially within the past fifteen years, or are\r\nthey likely to change essentially within the coming twenty-five? In\r\nthe year 1770 the greatest genius of Germany entered the walls of the\r\nold university-town of Strasburg, there to complete his education. He\r\nhas bequeathed to us a faithful record of his studies, his amusements,\r\nhis daily life. Connecting this Strasburg experience with the previous\r\nexperience at Leipsic, we know what it meant in the eighteenth century\r\nto be a German student. We know that the professors in those days were\r\npedagogues in the Anglo-American sense, and that university-life stood\r\nlittle if at all higher than our own present college-life. But when\r\nGoethe died, in 1832, the universities of Germany had reached their\r\nprime. Since then they have made no gain. It may be doubted if the\r\nprofessors, on the whole, rank quite so high to-day for originality\r\nand vigor of research as did their predecessors forty years ago.\r\nWherein lies the secret, then, of this wonderful change wrought in\r\nthe brief span of two generations, between 1770 and 1830, and amid\r\nthe dire confusion of the great Revolution and the Napoleonic era? The\r\nchange was twofold. It consisted, first, in allowing to the professor\r\nthe free play of his individuality; second, in providing him with a\r\nproperly trained body of students. From the practical recognition\r\nof these two principles, which have nothing to do with wealth and\r\nbuildings, proceed the power and glory of the German universities.\r\nViewed from the English, or even the American point, some of these\r\nuniversities might be pronounced poor, not to say starvelings. The\r\nbuildings are old and out of repair, the professors are scantily paid,\r\nthe students are needy, there is a general atmosphere of want and\r\ndiscomfort. But the work they do is noble, and its nobility consists\r\nin its freedom, its heartiness, its strict devotion to truth.\r\n\r\nWe are not concerned in this place with the study of the growth of the\r\nGerman school system that prepares the German student. We have to do\r\nwith the professor. Although the gymnasium and the university are\r\nnot to be dissevered in actual practice, the one being the necessary\r\nprelude to the other, still we can discuss either one of them\r\nseparately with a view to ascertaining its salient features.\r\n\r\nThe German university allows to the professor the free play of his\r\nindividuality. By this is meant that each professor has his specialty,\r\nwhich he teaches as a specialty and after his own fashion. He has been\r\nappointed because of his specialty, and to the end that he may teach\r\nit. His salary is paid to him, not so much for what he does as for\r\nwhat he is. It is in a measure the reward for having made for himself\r\na name. His standing in the university is based, not so much upon the\r\nnumber of students that he may attract to his lectures as upon the\r\nquality of scholarship that he exhibits and his general repute in\r\nthe world of letters. He has the satisfaction of feeling that his\r\nresearches, even the most abstruse, can be brought to bear directly\r\nupon his official intercourse with his students. A discovery that he\r\nmakes is usually communicated to them in the first instance, before it\r\nfinds its way into print. The neglect to take account of this element\r\nof originality in the lectures of a German professor has led to an\r\nunfair estimate of the lecture-system. Americans and English are apt\r\nto regard it as merely the oral inculcation of established truths.\r\nWere that the case, we might be right in questioning its superiority\r\nover our method of teaching by textbook. But it is not the case.\r\nThe lecture is the vehicle for conveying the latest discoveries made\r\neither by the professor himself or gleaned by him from the labors of\r\nhis colleagues. So far from merely repeating established truths,\r\nit rather promulgates truths in process of establishment. German\r\nuniversity lectures, taken all in all, represent the most advanced\r\nstage of thought. The instances are not infrequent where a professor\r\nrefrains from publishing his lectures, lest he should lose his\r\nhearers, who are attracted to him by reports of his originality and\r\nthoroughness.\r\n\r\nThe evident tendency of such a system is to encourage productivity\r\nand the highest degree of accuracy. A man who has to teach only one\r\nsubject, and teach it to such students only as are ready and anxious\r\nto receive it, can afford to take the time for being thorough. The\r\ntendency of the American system, on the other hand, is to beget a\r\nspirit of routine and to check productivity. The professor falls\r\ninto a way of contenting himself with meeting the requirements of the\r\ncollege curriculum. The effects of this curriculum upon the professors\r\nare deeper and farther-reaching than is usually perceived. It is\r\nin accordance with facts to call American professors, as a class,\r\nunproductive. But it would be unjust and inconsiderate to ascribe this\r\nwant of productivity to the disposition called laziness. Laziness is\r\nnot a national fault of Americans. On the contrary, we are pushing,\r\nactive, restless: we yearn, Alexander-like, for something new to\r\novercome. Our professors are of the same stock as our business-men,\r\nour lawyers, our doctors, our politicians. But the spirit of progress,\r\nif we choose to call it by that name, has been repressed in them. The\r\nspirit of emulation, of aggressive competition, which marks our trade,\r\nour banking, our manufacturing interests, our railroads, and even our\r\nprofessions, stops at the threshold of our colleges. There is rivalry,\r\ntrue, between Harvard and Yale, for instance. If the former erects a\r\nhandsome dormitory, the latter must have one larger and finer. If the\r\nformer establishes a new professorship, the latter must do likewise.\r\nThe colleges compete among themselves. But we see no signs of\r\ncompetition among the professors of a college, or between the\r\nprofessors of different colleges--competition, be it observed, in the\r\nsense that the individual professor regards his attainments and views\r\nas a proper subject for comparison with the attainments and views of\r\nanother professor in the same branch. Once established in his chair,\r\nhis individuality is merged in the general character of the college.\r\nHis time, his knowledge and his energy are subordinated to the\r\ncurriculum. He can teach only so much as may be fitted into his share\r\nof the time and may be suited to the capacities of a mixed audience.\r\nIt matters little whether the curriculum be good or bad, whether it\r\ntake in a wide or a narrow range of subjects, whether it be behind\r\nor up to the times: so long as it is a real curriculum it tends to\r\nprevent the full assertion of his individual excellence. He may study\r\nfor himself, but he cannot teach more than the regulations permit.\r\nHowever advanced he may be in his specialty, however sincere and\r\nearnest his wish to impart the choicest fruits of his research, he\r\nmust admit to himself that there is a point beyond which he is unable\r\nto carry his students. They are borne off to something else; they have\r\nno more time for him; they slip from his hold, perhaps at the very\r\nmoment when he flatters himself that he has acquired some formative\r\ninfluence over them.\r\n\r\nIf this view of the necessary effect of a curriculum is correct,\r\nit will enable us to set a more accurate value upon the so-called\r\nimprovements that have been introduced of late years in our colleges.\r\nThese improvements, stripped of the éclat with which they are\r\ninvested, will be found to amount to little more than expansions\r\nand slight modifications of a system which remains unaltered in\r\nits fundamental features. New studies have been introduced, such as\r\nphysics, chemistry, geology, the share of attention assigned to\r\nmodern languages has been increased, a higher standard of admission is\r\nenforced, and the salaries of professors have been raised. But in\r\nall this there is no radical change of the method of instruction. The\r\nestablishment of a chair of physics, for instance, can scarcely be\r\nsaid to enable the professor of Greek to exhibit his attainments\r\nmore fully. The professor of Latin does not perceive that his pupils,\r\nbecause they are now instructed in physical geography, can be carried\r\nby him to a more advanced stage of Latin scholarship. In fact, so far\r\nas the older studies are concerned, those which made up the curriculum\r\nthirty years ago, they seem to be slightly the worse for the recent\r\nimprovements. The college course of 1840 or 1850 was a comparatively\r\nsimple thing. It covered only a few studies, and those of a\r\ngeneral nature; it taught more thoroughly and with less pretence to\r\nuniversality; in short, it did its work more after the fashion of a\r\ngood school. At the present day the curriculum embraces a much wider\r\nrange of subjects--we need only recall to our minds the introduction\r\nof general history, chemistry, physiology and the modern\r\nlanguages--but the time has not been lengthened by a single year. The\r\nstudent's time is more broken up than before: the direct influence\r\nexerted by the professor is less. Our recognition of these and kindred\r\nfacts, however, should be something more than a vain regret for the\r\ngood old past. All these changes are concessions made to the spirit\r\nof the age. Our generation demands--and very rightfully, too--that the\r\nsphere of knowledge be enlarged, that the sciences of Nature receive\r\nsufficient attention. To attempt to undo what has been done, to\r\nrestore the curriculum to the antiquated cadre of Latin and Greek,\r\ntrigonometry, mental science and rhetoric, would be a reaction as\r\nsenseless as hopeless.\r\n\r\nLet us be just to ourselves and just to our colleges. We, the public,\r\nclamored for new studies, and the colleges had to meet the demand,\r\nbecause, by force of circumstances, they were the only places where\r\nthe changes could be effected. But in our praisworthy desire for\r\nprogress we have not considered sufficiently whether the colleges were\r\nin truth the proper places for innovation; whether we were bringing\r\nin our innovations in the right way and at the right time; whether\r\nwe were in a fair way of making our colleges what we seek to make\r\nthem--namely, centres of learning. To discuss all these points would\r\nbe equivalent to discussing the question of education in all its\r\nphases, from the primary school to the university. For the present\r\nwe must limit ourselves to understanding and appreciating fairly the\r\nposition of our professors.\r\n\r\nThat position is not only a trying, but a discouraging one. The\r\ngreater part of the professor's time is spent--from the point of\r\nview of pure science we might almost say wasted--in teaching the same\r\nthings over and over again. After a few years' practice his round of\r\nhours becomes mechanical. Familiarity with the textbooks and with the\r\nuniformly-recurring blunders of each successive class begets a feeling\r\nof weariness that is not remote from aversion and contempt. So far\r\nas his prescribed official duties are concerned, he feels that he has\r\nnothing more to learn. There being, then, no stimulus from without, he\r\nis open to one of two temptations--either to rest on his past labors,\r\nor, which is far more likely, to keep on studying for himself, but\r\nto keep the results to himself. It is not only more soothing to our\r\npride, it is juster to our professors, to regard them thus as men who\r\nhave hid their lights under a bushel, and also to confess that we, our\r\ninstitutions and ways of thinking, have made the bushel for them\r\nand held it down over their heads. It is not every man who has the\r\npersistency and stamina of Professor Whitney, for instance, who can\r\ntoil for years with beginning classes in French and German, never\r\nlosing sight of his real aim, never neglecting an opportunity of\r\nbringing it forward, until at last he achieves the success he has\r\nespecially desired, and is acknowledged to be one of the foremost\r\ncomparative philologists and Sanskrit scholars in the world. Where a\r\nProfessor Whitney may succeed in spite of untoward circumstances, a\r\ndozen will probably fail because of circumstances. We naturally look\r\nto our colleges for the evidences of learning, of enlightenment and\r\nculture. We think of the capital invested in them, of the part they\r\nplay in moulding the character of our young men, and we deem it a\r\nmatter of course that they should be continually producing something\r\noriginal and independent. But when we compare them with the German\r\nuniversities--and the comparison is forced upon us whenever one of our\r\ngraduates goes abroad to complete his studies or whenever we look into\r\na recent German publication--we are forced to exclaim, \"What are our\r\ncolleges about? Are they incompetent, or asleep?\" Neither one nor\r\nthe other. Most of our professors do the best they can. But they are\r\nfettered by routine: they are not stimulated and sustained by\r\nthe consciousness that their private studies may be made directly\r\navailable in the classroom. They lead two lives, as it were--one\r\nas professor, the other as thinker and reader--and there is not the\r\nproper action and reaction between the two.\r\n\r\nThe remedy is as easy to propose as it would be difficult to apply.\r\nWe have only to convert our colleges into universities, our college\r\ninstructors into professors after the German model. Let us relegate\r\nall teaching, so called, to the schools, and let us give our\r\nprofessors permission to expand into veritable scholars discoursing to\r\nyoung men of kindred spirit. Any one can see at a glance that from\r\nthe wish to the accomplishment is a long way. Upon some of us the\r\nconsciousness is beginning to dawn that perhaps we have not even taken\r\nthe first decisive step. The best that can be said of our colleges is\r\nthat they are in a state of transition. We have increased the number\r\nof studies, as well as the number of colleges; we have established\r\nschools of law and schools of science, sometimes independent of,\r\nsometimes co-ordinate with or subordinate to, the college. We have\r\nalso established post-graduate courses, in the hope of inducing our\r\nyoung men to complete their studies at home. Yet every year we see a\r\nlarger number going abroad. In those days of golden memory, both for\r\nGermany and for America, when Longfellow was gliding down the\r\nRhine with Freiligrath, and Bancroft and Bismarck were comrades at\r\nGöttingen, an American in Germany was something of a rarity. In most\r\ninstances he was a man of wealth and high social standing, who\r\nlooked upon his semester or two as a romantic episode. But now every\r\noutward-bound steamer carries with it one or more who, emerging from\r\nobscurity and poverty, have saved up a few hundred dollars and are\r\nbent upon plain, hard, practical business. \"We go,\" they can be\r\nimagined as saying, \"because we can get in Germany what we cannot get\r\nat home. Your schools of science and your post-graduate courses may be\r\nwell enough in their way, but they do not give us what we are after,\r\nand we cannot afford to wait until they may be able to give it. Some\r\nof the professors are first-rate men--perhaps just as good as any\r\nwe may meet in Germany--but what does their learning, their science,\r\navail us, so long as they are obliged to withhold from us the best\r\nthat they know? They trained themselves in Germany, and if we are ever\r\nto rival them we must do the same.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not pleasant to listen to such reasonings, much less to see them\r\ncarried into effect. But the defect which they bring to light will not\r\nbe cured by closing our eyes to it and trusting to time, the sovereign\r\nhealer. Time is a negative factor: it only enables the forces of\r\nNature to do their positive work. But schools and colleges are not the\r\nproduct of the elemental forces of Nature: they are distinctively\r\nthe work of man as a free agent. If we are free to shape any of our\r\ninstitutions to suit our needs, we are certainly free to shape our\r\neducational institutions. By having a definite result in view, and\r\nwilling its attainment, we may succeed; but if we fail either in\r\nclearness of vision or persistency of will, we cannot expect the\r\nresult to come of itself. The present university system of Germany,\r\nwhich might seem to a careless observer the natural outgrowth\r\nof German life, is the result of hard thinking and strenuous,\r\nwell-directed effort. We should not commit much of an exaggeration\r\nwere we to call it the deliberate creation of Frederick the Great, Von\r\nZedlitz and Wolf, who dragged with them Prussia, and the other\r\nGerman states in her wake. They and their associates and followers,\r\nSchleiermacher and William von Humboldt, clear-headed, iron-willed\r\nmen, perceived what was needed, and bent all their energies to the\r\ntask. They emancipated the schools from the control of the clergy,\r\nand established the principle that teaching is a distinct vocation,\r\nrequiring special training, over which the state has supervision;\r\nfurthermore, that the state should pronounce who is fit and who is\r\nnot fit for university education, thereby abolishing\r\nentrance-examinations, and putting an end to the ignoble practice on\r\nthe part of the universities of lowering the standard for the purpose\r\nof increasing the number of students. They abolished the last vestiges\r\nof the scholastic system by raising the faculty of philosophy from its\r\nposition as a quasi-preparatory course to the others, and placing it\r\non a footing of perfect equality with law, theology and medicine.[3]\r\nThey removed all restrictions from the _Lehrfreiheit_, or professional\r\nfreedom of instruction, while at the same time they preserved the\r\nright of the state to control indirectly the quality of university\r\ninstruction by means of state-examinations for pastors, teachers,\r\nlawyers, physicians and officeholders. Ever since then the university\r\nsystem of Germany has rested upon a secure and lasting basis.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The subordination of the philosophical faculty as a sort\r\nof preparatory course to the others remained in force in Austria until\r\n1850. It is not surprising, then, that Austria should have compared\r\nso unfavorably with Germany in philology, history, philosophy and\r\nliterary criticism until within our own times.]\r\n\r\nIs the course pursued by Prussia to be regarded as a mere incident in\r\nhistory, or may it serve as an example and model for us? Prussia is a\r\nmonarchy, clothed with some constitutional forms but at bottom a\r\nstate where the personal will of the sovereign has always made,\r\nand continues to make, itself felt in the final instance. We are\r\na republic, or rather a cluster of republics under an imperfectly\r\ncentralized national government. It is evident that the agencies and\r\nmode of reform with us must differ from those that have been employed\r\nin Prussia and in the rest of Germany. But it does not follow that\r\nthe reform itself is impossible. What has elsewhere sprung from the\r\nautocratic will of a single man and his cabinet may be effected here\r\nthrough that other force, equally great and perhaps more pervasive,\r\nto which we give the vague name of \"popular opinion.\" We know that\r\npopular opinion in our country is irresistible. It makes everything\r\nbend to it. It broke up the Tweed Ring, seemingly impregnable, in a\r\nsingle campaign. But this popular opinion is not a natural product: it\r\nis the work of a few men who devote themselves to awakening the sense\r\nof right and wrong and guiding the understanding of their fellows.\r\nBut for popular leaders like Mr. O'Conor and Governor Tilden, the\r\nlate Tweed Ring might be in power at this day. Education is not\r\nso different from politics but that we can regard it as subject to\r\nsimilar laws of cause and effect. Our present common-school system is\r\nan off-spring of popular opinion, as that opinion was created and led\r\nto action by a few men. And whether our common schools are to stand\r\nor fall is again becoming a question of the day, and will be decided\r\naccording as popular opinion may be swayed by a few zealous friends or\r\nenemies. Our colleges, it may be said, do not occupy the same\r\nrelation to the state that our schools do. They are nearly all private\r\ncorporations, enjoying vested rights which the state is powerless to\r\ntouch. Undoubtedly true, but it is no less true that what cannot be\r\ndone directly may be done indirectly. The state need not make so much\r\nas the attempt to lay hands upon college property or to interfere with\r\ncollege studies. It has only to say, \"I, the state, exact such and\r\nsuch qualifications of all who seek to practice law or medicine within\r\nmy limits or to become my officeholders. I establish my own free\r\ncolleges and schools of law and medicine, and I proceed to tax\r\nall others at their full valuation.\" There is not a college in the\r\ncountry, not even Harvard, that could compete upon such terms. The\r\nstate need not even express its sovereign will so precisely. It\r\ncan content itself with establishing a university of its own, and\r\nfacilitating the direct influence of this university over the public\r\nand private schools. We see the operations of such a system very\r\nplainly in Michigan. Not only does the university at Ann Arbor\r\novershadow completely the private colleges, but the \"union schools,\"\r\nadministered under its auspices, are--to borrow the expression of one\r\nof its graduates--\"killing\" the private schools. We may rest assured\r\nthat whatever the people of a State or of the United States is\r\nearnestly bent upon having, will come.\r\n\r\nWhether all our States are to act as Michigan has done--whether we are\r\nindeed ripe for thorough change--whether a change is to be effected\r\nby direct State action or indirectly by the mere pressure of public\r\nsentiment--whether we have real need of a body of professors and a set\r\nof universities such as Germany possesses--whether we are to make\r\nour higher as well as our primary education non-sectarian,--are all\r\nquestions which may rest in abeyance for a long time to come. It is\r\nalso possible that one or the other of them may, in legal phraseology,\r\nbe sprung upon us at any time. Not to be taken unawares, we have\r\nto bear steadily in mind several fixed principles and to disabuse\r\nourselves of one misconception.\r\n\r\nThe misconception is this: that what Germany accomplished in the\r\neighteenth century we cannot accomplish in the nineteenth, because\r\ncircumstances are so very different, chiefly because Germany is an old\r\ncountry and we are a young country. The circumstances are not so very\r\ndifferent, and the difference, however great it may be estimated, is\r\nin our favor. We are a union of thirty or forty States: in the Germany\r\nof the eighteenth century there were three hundred. Ever since the\r\nadoption of our Federal Constitution we have enjoyed common rights of\r\ncitizenship, common laws of commerce, common legal protection. Will\r\nit be necessary to remind the student of history that the Germans have\r\nacquired these blessings only within our own day? We are a nation of\r\nforty millions, rich and prosperous, free to develop our resources.\r\nThe Germany of 1775 could count barely twenty millions, its soil was\r\npoorly tilled, its mineral wealth undeveloped, manufactures in an\r\nembryonic state, trade fettered in a thousand ways, the peasantry\r\nbrutally ignorant and servile, the national character--to all\r\nappearance--ruined by cruel religious wars, the sense of national\r\nunity blunted by the recollections of a hundred petty feuds reaching\r\nback to the gloom of the Middle Ages, the national taste dominated by\r\npoor French models to an extent that now seems incredible, learning\r\neither dry pedantry or shallow cox-combry. We are indeed a young\r\ncountry, but we are young in hope; Germany was old, but it was old in\r\nweakness, in poverty, in despondency. Whoever doubts our ability to do\r\nas much as Germany did one hundred years ago, fails to profit by the\r\nteachings of history--overlooks the fact that Germany in 1840 was\r\nonly where she had been in 1618. That we should take Germany for our\r\nstandard of comparison, rather than England or France, is a postulate\r\nwhich has one circumstance unmistakably in its favor. Although we are\r\nconnected with England by common descent, institutions and language,\r\nalthough the politics and philosophy of France have exerted\r\nconsiderable influence over our own, we do not observe our young\r\nmen going in numbers to England and France to receive their final\r\ntraining. Their instinct leads them to Germany. For one American\r\ngraduate of Oxford or Cambridge or of the French _écoles_, it would\r\nbe easy to count ten doctors of Göttingen or Heidelberg. Our young\r\nmen are not attracted to the German universities by such factitious\r\nconsiderations as cheapness of living or the acquisition of the\r\nlanguage, but by sympathy with German methods and academic liberty.\r\n\r\nSome of the most important fixed principles have been already touched\r\nupon, but only one can be developed in this place. It is, that if\r\nwe are to establish a system of higher education, we must begin by\r\nrecognizing freely and fully the distinction between teacher and\r\nprofessor. We must perceive the importance of having two sets of\r\nmen--the one to teach, the other to investigate; the one engaged in\r\ntraining boys to learn, the other in showing young men how to think.\r\nWhen and how this distinction is to be established, in what special\r\nform it is to be embodied, is a secondary matter. The chief thing is\r\nto admit that it is essential and feasible. The young man who returns\r\nafter a three years' absence in Germany, exhibiting with dignified\r\npride his well-earned doctor's diploma, looks of course upon the\r\ninstitution that conferred it as the _ne plus ultra_. But riper\r\nexperience, contact with the sharp corners of American prejudices\r\nand peculiarities, renewed familiarity with our social, political,\r\ncommercial and literary life, will gradually convince him that a\r\nGerman university is not a thing to be plucked up by the roots and\r\ntransplanted bodily to American soil. We have rather to take our\r\nnative stock as we find it, and engraft upon it a slip from the\r\nGerman. One trial may fail, another may succeed. Our first efforts\r\nwill be like those of a man groping about in the dark. More than\r\none department in a German university will be of little avail in an\r\nAmerican, and conversely we shall have to create some that do not\r\nexist elsewhere. For instance, in view of the great power exerted by\r\nthe newspaper press, it might be desirable to have a course of study\r\nfor those who think of taking up journalism as a profession. In such\r\na course, political economy, constitutional and international law,\r\nEnglish and American history, and the modern languages and literatures\r\nshould constitute a full and serious discipline. It is not probable\r\nthat the study of philology will ever attract the same attention here\r\nthat it does abroad. Our needs lie in the direction of the natural\r\nsciences rather than in the direction of history and linguistics. But\r\nwe should be derelict to our duty were we to sacrifice these sciences\r\nof the spirit, as the Germans call them, to the sciences of Nature.\r\nA culture without them would be the bleakest and most repulsive\r\nmaterialism.\r\n\r\nThe practical recognition of the difference between teacher and\r\nprofessor would be a decided step. By the side of it those which\r\nwe have already taken would appear insignificant. The addition of\r\nchemistry, geology, or physiology to the previous curriculum does\r\nnot change its character, so long as the professors of those branches\r\ninstruct after the fashion of the professors of Latin and Greek. The\r\nadvantage that the men of natural science have over their colleagues\r\nis one which the nature of the subject brings with it. In order to\r\nteach at all, they must come in close personal contact with their\r\npupils, and to escape falling behind in their department, where\r\nnew theories succeed one another with such rapid bounds, they must\r\ncontinue a certain amount at least of original research. Supplementing\r\nthe present curriculum by post-graduate courses will hardly suffice.\r\nSuch courses are open to serious objections. If conducted by the\r\nregular professors, they impose additional burdens upon men who have\r\nalready more than enough. If conducted by special professors, they\r\nwill tend to raise those professors at the expense of the regular\r\nfaculty. A lecturer to graduates must necessarily appear, in the eyes\r\nof the undergraduate, superior to the man who hears recitations and\r\nprepares term-reports. Besides, young men who have passed four years\r\nat one college need \"a change of air:\" they will develop more rapidly\r\nif brought into contact with new ideas and new instructors. Every\r\ninstitution has an atmosphere of its own, which ceases after a time to\r\nact upon the student as a stimulant.\r\n\r\nThere is one additional point that should not be overlooked. A careful\r\ndiscrimination between the functions of the professor and those of the\r\nteacher would benefit both classes of men. Such has been the effect in\r\nGermany. The gymnasium-teacher has a high sense of the dignity of\r\nhis vocation and a keen sense of its responsibilities, because he\r\nperceives that he must bring his labors to a well-rounded conclusion.\r\nHe knows that the university does not supplement the gymnasium--that\r\nthe university professors do not undertake to make good his\r\nshortcomings. The gymnasial course is a completed phase of training.\r\nIt aims at giving the pupil all the general knowledge that he requires\r\nprevious to his professional studies. What is lost or overlooked in\r\nthe gymnasium cannot be acquired at the university. Hence the peculiar\r\nconscientiousness of the German teacher, his almost painful anxiety to\r\nmake sure that his pupils master every subject, his unwillingness to\r\nlet them go before they are \"ripe.\" With us the change from school\r\nto college is not an abrupt transition, like that from gymnasium to\r\nuniversity. The college course, certainly during the two lower years\r\nat least, is a continuation of the school course: the same or\r\nsimilar subjects are taught, and taught in the same way. Hence the\r\nschool-teacher is tempted to regulate his efforts according to the\r\ncollege standard of admission. If he can only \"get his men into\r\ncollege,\" as the saying is, he thinks that he is doing enough. To say\r\nthis of all schools and all teachers would be flagrant injustice.\r\nNot a few of our older schools compare favorably with the best German\r\ngymnasiums, and in the large cities we find schools of even recent\r\norigin that endeavor faithfully to give a well-rounded discipline. But\r\nit remains nevertheless true that our schools, taken as a whole, give\r\nno more than the colleges require, and that only too many of them\r\ngive less, trusting to the colleges to be lenient and eke out the\r\ndeficiency. Moreover, when we read in the daily papers advertisements\r\nlike the following, \"Mr. Smith, a graduate of Harvard (or Yale or some\r\nother college, as the case may be), prepares young men for college,\"\r\nwhat inference are we to draw? Simply, that Mr. Smith, having gone\r\nthrough Harvard or Yale, knows exactly what is required there, and\r\nwill undertake to \"coach\" any young man for admission in two or three\r\nyears. Such coaching, if the young man is dull or backward, will\r\nconsist in cramming him with required studies, to the neglect of\r\neverything not required. Teaching is not easy work. In many respects\r\nit is more difficult to be a good teacher than to be an original\r\ninvestigator. Whatever operates to strengthen and elevate the\r\nteacher's position, therefore, must be a gain. The highest\r\nincentive would be the consciousness that his school is not a mere\r\nstepping-stone to another school of larger growth, but the place where\r\nhe must in truth prepare the youthful mind for independent study.\r\n\r\nJAMES MORGAN HART.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTRASTED MOODS.\r\n\r\n            WANT.\r\n\r\n  Where is the power I fancied mine?\r\n    Can I have emptied my soul of thought?\r\n  In yesterday's fullness lay no sign\r\n    That to-day would be a time of drought.\r\n  What if thought fail me for evermore?\r\n    The world that awaits a well-filled plan\r\n  Must, railing, cry at my long-closed door,\r\n    \"He cannot finish what he began.\"\r\n\r\n            PLENTY.\r\n\r\n  Thought dashes on thought within my soul:\r\n    Time will not serve for the bounding-line.\r\n  I think it would fail to mete the whole\r\n    If old Methuselah's years were mine.\r\n  Like the famous spring that is sometimes dry,\r\n    Then flows with a river's whelming might,\r\n  The current of thought now runs so high\r\n    It covers the earthy bed from sight.\r\n\r\nCHARLOTTE F. BATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ATONEMENT OF LEAM DUNDAS.\r\n\r\nBY MRS. E. LYNN LINTON, AUTHOR OF \"PATRICIA KEMBALL.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nCHANGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFour years had come and gone since Mr. Dundas had laid his second\r\nwife in the grave beside his first, and the county had discussed\r\nthe immorality of taking cherry-water as a calmant. For it was to\r\nan overdose of this that the verdict at the coroner's inquest had\r\nassigned the cause of poor madame's awful and sudden death; though why\r\nthe medicine should have been found so loaded with prussic acid as\r\nto have caused instant death on this special night, when it had been\r\ntaken so often before with impunity, was a mystery to which there was\r\nno solution. Not a trace of poison was to be found anywhere in the\r\nhouse, and no evidence was forthcoming to show how it might have been\r\nbought or where procured. Alick Corfield, who understood it all,\r\nwas not called as a witness, and he told no one what he knew. On the\r\ncontrary, he burdened his soul with the, to him, unpardonable crime\r\nof falsehood that he might shield Leam from detection; for when his\r\nfather, missing the sixty-minim bottle of hydrocyanic acid, asked him\r\nwhat had become of it, Alick answered, with that wonderful coolness\r\nof virtue descending to sin for the protection of the beloved which is\r\nsometimes seen in the ingenuous, \"I broke it by accident, father, and\r\nforgot to tell you.\"\r\n\r\nAs the boy had never been known to tell a falsehood in his life, he\r\nreaped the reward of good repute, and his father, saying quietly,\r\n\"That was a bad job, my boy,\" laid the matter aside as a _caput\r\nmortuum_ of no value.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, he thought more than once that it was an odd coincidence,\r\nbut he could see no connection between the two circumstances\r\nof madame's sudden death and Alick's fracture of that bottle of\r\nhydrocyanic acid; and even if there should be any, he preferred not\r\nto trace it. So the inquest was a mere show so far as getting at the\r\ntruth was concerned, and madame died and was buried in the mystery in\r\nwhich she had lived.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Leam had been sent to school, whence she was expected\r\nto return a little more like other English girls than she had been\r\nhitherto, and Mr. Dundas shut up Ford House--he went back to the\r\noriginal name after madame's death--and left England to shake off in\r\ntravel the deadly despair that had fallen like a sickness on him and\r\ntaken all the flavor out of his life. He had never cared to search out\r\nthe real history of that fair beloved woman. Enough had come to his\r\nknowledge, in the bills which had poured in from several Sherrington\r\ntradesmen on the announcement of her marriage and then of her death,\r\nto convince him that he had been duped in facts if not in feeling. For\r\namong these bills was one from the local geologist for \"a beginner's\r\ncabinet of specimens,\" delivered just about the time when he,\r\nSebastian, had spent so many pleasant hours in arranging the fragments\r\nwhich madame said represented both her knowledge and her lost\r\nhappiness; also one from the fancy repository, which sold everything,\r\nfor sundry water-color drawings and illuminated texts, a Table of\r\nthe Ten Commandments illustrated, and the like, which sufficiently\r\nexplained all on this side, and settled for ever the dead woman's\r\nclaims to the artistic and scientific merit with which Mr. Dundas and\r\nthe rector had credited her.\r\n\r\nAlso, certain ugly letters from a person of the name of Lowes, in\r\nLondon, put him on the track, had he cared to follow it up, of a\r\ndeception even worse than that of pretended art or mock science. These\r\nletters, written in the same handwriting as that wherein Julius de\r\nMontfort, her brother-in-law, the present marquis, had told her of\r\nthe defalcations of the family solicitor and trustee, called Virginie,\r\nMadame la Marquise de Montfort, plain Susan bluntly, and reminded her\r\nof the screw that would be turned if the writer was not satisfied;\r\nand were letters that demanded money, always money, as the price of\r\ncontinued silence.\r\n\r\nBut Sebastian had loved his second wife too well to seek to know the\r\ntruth, if that truth would be to her discredit. He preferred to\r\nbe deceived; and he had what he preferred. He stifled all doubts,\r\ndarkened all chinks by which the obtrusive light might penetrate, kept\r\nhis love if not his faith unshaken, caring only to remember her as\r\nbeautiful, seductive, soothing, and mourning her as deeply, doubtful\r\nas she had proved herself to be, as he had loved her fondly when he\r\nbelieved her honest. It was a curious mental condition for a man to\r\ncherish, but it satisfied him, and his regret was not robbed of its\r\npathos by knowledge.\r\n\r\nNow that the four years were completed, the widower had to return to\r\nhis desolate home and make the best he could of the fragments of peace\r\nand happiness left to him. Leam was nineteen: it was time for her to\r\nbe taken from school and given the protection of her father's house.\r\nIt went against the man's heart to have her, but he was compelled, if\r\nhe wished to stand well with his friends, and he hoped that the girl\r\nwould be found improved from these years of discipline and training,\r\nand be rational and like other people. Wherefore he came home one\r\ndry dull day in October, and the neighborhood welcomed him, if not as\r\ntheir prodigal returned, yet as their lunatic restored to his right\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nDuring these four years a few changes had taken place at North Aston.\r\nCarry Fairbairn had married--not Frank Harrowby: he had found a rich\r\nwife, not in the least to his personal taste, but greatly to his\r\nprofit; and Carry, after having cried a good deal for a month, had\r\nconsoled herself with a young clergyman from the North, whom she loved\r\nquite as much as if she had never fancied Frank at all, and spoilt in\r\nthe first months by such submission as caused her to repent for all\r\nthe years of her life after.\r\n\r\nThe things of the rectory were much in their old state. Little Fina,\r\nmadame's child, was there under Mrs. Birkett's motherly care; but\r\nas the child was nearly six years old now, the good creature's\r\ninstinctive love for infants was wearing out, and she was often heard\r\nto say how much she wished she could have kept Fina always a baby,\r\nand, sighing, how difficult she was to manage! She was an exceedingly\r\npretty little girl, with fair skin, fair hair and dark eyes--willful\r\nof course, and spoilt of course; the only one in the house who took\r\nher in hand to correct being Adelaide. And as she took her in hand too\r\nsmartly, Mrs. Birkett generally interfered, and the servants combined\r\nto screen her; the result being that the little one was mistress of\r\nthe situation, after the manner of willful children, and made every\r\none more or less anxious and uncomfortable as her return for their\r\ncare.\r\n\r\nAlick Corfield was the rector's curate. On the whole, this was the\r\nmost important of all the North Aston events which had taken place\r\nduring the last four years. Soon after madame's death and Leam's\r\ntransfer from home to school Alick had a strange and sudden illness.\r\nNo one knew what to make of it, nor how it came, nor what it was, but\r\nthe doctor called it cerebral fever, and when the families got hold\r\nof the word they were content. Cerebral fever does as well as anything\r\nelse for an illness of which no one knows and no one seeks to know the\r\ncause, and to the origin of which the patient himself gives no clew.\r\nIt was a peg, and a peg was all that was wanted.\r\n\r\nOn his recovery he announced his intention of going to Oxford to read\r\nfor holy orders. His mother was piteously distressed, as might be\r\nexpected. She feared all sorts of evil for her boy, from damp sheets\r\nand unmended linen to over-study, wine-parties and bold-faced minxes\r\nweaving subtle webs of fascination. But for the first time in his life\r\nAlick stood out against her insistance, and his will conquered hers.\r\nThe sequel of the struggle was, that he went to Oxford, took his\r\ndegree, read for orders, passed, and that Mr. Birkett gave him his\r\ntitle as his curate.\r\n\r\nIt could hardly be said that the relations were entirely harmonious\r\nbetween the military-minded rector, who held to the righteousness of\r\nhelotry and the value of ignorance in the class beneath him, and the\r\nyoung curate burning with zeal and oppressed with the desire to put\r\nall the crooked things of life straight. The one pooh-poohed the\r\nenthusiasm of the other, derided his belief in humanity and assured\r\nhim of failure: the other felt as if he had been taken behind the\r\nscenes and shown the blue fire of which the awful lightning of his\r\nyouth was made. Mr. Birkett could not quite forbid the greater\r\nfaith, the more loving endeavor which the young man threw into his\r\nministrations, but he was the Sadducee who scoffed and made the\r\nwork heavy and uphill throughout. He gave a grudging assent to the\r\nBible-classes, the Wednesday evening services at the Sunday-school,\r\nthe lectures on great men on the first Monday in the month, which\r\nAlick proposed and established. He thought it all weariness to the\r\nflesh and a waste of time and energy; but the traditions of his order\r\nwere strong, if he himself did not share them, and he had to give way\r\nin the end. He consoled himself with the reflection that the boy would\r\nfind out his mistake before long, and that then he would know who had\r\nbeen right throughout.\r\n\r\nBut even zeal and hope and diligence in his work could not lighten the\r\npersistent sadness which was Alick's chief characteristic now. Gaunt\r\nand silent, with the eyes of a man whose inner self is absent and\r\nwhose thoughts are not with his company, he looked as if he had passed\r\nthrough the fire, and had not passed through unscathed. No one knew\r\nwhat had happened to him, and, though many made conjectures, none came\r\nnear the truth. Meanwhile, he seemed as if he lived only to work, and,\r\nthe clearer-sighted might have added, to wait.\r\n\r\nFor a further local change, Lionnet was tenanted again by a strange\r\nand solitary man, who never went to church and did not visit in\r\nthe neighborhood. He was in consequence believed to be a forger, an\r\nescaped convict in hiding, or, by the more charitable, a maniac as yet\r\nnot dangerous. North Aston held him in deeper horror than it had held\r\neven Pepita, and his true personality exercised its wits more keenly\r\nthan had even the true personality of madame. In point of fact, he was\r\na quiet, inoffensive, amiable man, who gave his mind to Sanskrit for\r\nwork and to entomology for play, and did not trouble himself about his\r\nown portrait as drawn in the local vernacular. Nevertheless, for all\r\nhis reserved habits and quiet ways, he had learnt the whole history of\r\nthe place and people before he had been at Lionnet a month.\r\n\r\nAt the Hill things remained unchanged for the ladies, save for the\r\nadditional burden of years and the pleasant news that Edgar was\r\nexpected home daily. Adelaide, now twenty-four, took the news as a\r\npersonal grace, and blossomed into smiles and glad humor of which only\r\nJosephine understood the source. But Josephine held her tongue, and\r\nreceived the confidence of her young friend with discretion. As she\r\nhad never dispossessed her own old idol, she could feel for Adelaide,\r\nand she was not disposed to look on her patient determination with\r\ndispleasure. The constancy of the two, however, was very different in\r\nessential meaning. With Josephine it was the constancy that is born of\r\nan affectionate disposition and the absence of rival Lotharios: with\r\nAdelaide it was the result of calculation and decision. The one would\r\nhave worshiped Sebastian as she worshiped him now had he been ruined,\r\na cripple, a criminal even: the other would have shut out Edgar\r\ninexorably from her very dreams had not his personality included\r\nthe Hill. With the one it was self-abasement--with the other\r\nself-consideration; but it came to the same thing in the end, and the\r\nmen profited equally.\r\n\r\nAll these changes Sebastian Dundas found to have taken place when he\r\nreturned to North Aston with gray hair instead of brown, his smooth,\r\nfair skin tanned and roughened, and his weak, finely-cut, effeminate\r\nmouth hidden by a moustache of a reddish tint, mingled with white.\r\nStill, he was Sebastian; and after the first shock of his altered\r\nappearance had been got over, Josephine carried her incense in the old\r\nway, and found her worship as dear and as tantalizing as ever.\r\n\r\nLastly, as the crowning change of all, Leam came home from school;\r\nno longer the arrogant, embittered child, looking at life through the\r\nfalse medium of pride and ignorance, saying rude things and doing odd\r\nones with the most perfect unconsciousness; but well-bred, graceful,\r\nsufficiently instructed not to make patent mistakes, and more\r\nbeautiful by far than she had even promised to be. Her very eyes were\r\nlovelier, lovely as they had always been: they had more variety of\r\nexpression, were more dewy and tender, and, if less tragic, were more\r\nspiritual. That hard, dry, burning passion which had devoured her of\r\nold time seemed to have gone, as also her savage Spanish pride. She\r\nhad rounded and softened in body too, as in mind. Her skin was fairer;\r\nher lips were not so firmly closed, so rigid in line, so constricted\r\nin motion; her brows were more flexible and not so often knit\r\ntogether; and her slight, lithe figure was perfect in line and\r\nmovement. Still, she had enough of her former manner of being for\r\nidentity. Grave, quiet, laconic, direct, she was but a modification\r\nof the former Leam as they had known her--Leam, Pepita's daughter,\r\nand with blood in her veins that was not the ordinary blood of the\r\nordinary British miss.\r\n\r\nHer father's artistic perceptions were gratified as he met her at the\r\nstation and Leam turned her cheek to him voluntarily with tears in her\r\neyes. Turning her cheek was apparently her idea of kissing; but if not\r\ntoo intense an expression of affection, it was at least an improvement\r\non the old hard repulsion, and Sebastian accepted it as the concession\r\nit was meant to be. Indeed, they met somewhat as foes reconciled, or\r\nrather seeking to be reconciled, and Mr. Dundas did not wish to keep\r\nopen old sores. Her cheek, turned to him somewhere about the ear,\r\nrepresented to his mind a peace-offering: her eyes full of tears were\r\nas a confession of past sins and a promise of amendment. Not that he\r\nunderstood why she was so much more effusive than of old, but if it\r\naugured a happier life together, he was glad.\r\n\r\nAs they drove up to the door of the old home, crowded with memories\r\nand associations, a shudder passed over the girl: she grasped her\r\nfather's hand in her own almost convulsively, and he heard her say\r\nbelow her breath, \"Poor papa!\"\r\n\r\nHe wondered why she pitied him. The place must surely be full of\r\nmemories of her mother for her: why did she say \"Poor papa!\" to him?\r\nHe did not see what she saw--that peaceful September evening, and the\r\nbottle of cherry-water on the table, with the little phial of thirty\r\ndeaths in her hand; and now the contents emptied into the harmless\r\ndraught; and now madame pale and dead. The whole scene transacted\r\nitself vividly before her, and she shuddered at her memories and her\r\npast self, as always with a kind of vague wonder how she could have\r\nbeen so wicked, and where did she get the force, the courage, for such\r\na cruel crime?\r\n\r\nFor all these four years at school the shadow of that dreadful deed\r\nhad been ever in the background of her life; and as time went on, and\r\nshe came to a better understanding of morality, it grew clear to her\r\nas a crime. Its consciousness of guilt had broken down her pride, and\r\nthus had made her more malleable, more humble. She could no longer\r\nharden herself in her belief that she was superior to every one else.\r\nThose girls, her companions--they had not had an Andalusian mother,\r\ntruly; they did not pray to the saints, and the Holy Virgin took no\r\ncare of them; they were Protestants and English, frogs and pigs; but\r\nthey had not committed murder. If she should stand up in the middle\r\nof the room and tell them what she had done, which of them would touch\r\nher hand again? which of them speak to her? English and Protestants as\r\nthey were, how far superior in their innocence to her, an Andalusian\r\nCatholic, in her guilt! But no one lives with remorse. It comes and\r\ngoes gustily, fitfully; but the things of the present are stronger\r\nthan the things of the past, else the man with a shameful secret in\r\nhis life would go mad.\r\n\r\nOne of these gusty storms broke over Leam as she passed through the\r\ngates of the old home, and for the moment she felt as if she must\r\nconfess the truth to her father and tell him what evil thing she had\r\ndone. Yet it passed, as other such storms had passed: the things of\r\nthe present took their natural place of prominence, and those of the\r\npast sank again into the background, shadows that never faded quite\r\naway, but that were not actualities pressing against her.\r\n\r\nThe news of Leam's home-coming created quite a pleasurable excitement\r\nin the neighborhood, and the families flocked to Ford House to\r\nwelcome her among them as one of themselves, all anxious to see if\r\nthe Ethiopian of North Aston had shed her skin, if the leopardess had\r\nchanged her spots. They were divided among themselves as to whether\r\nshe had or had not. Some said she was charming, and like any one else,\r\nbut others shook their heads, and, like experts in brain disease,\r\nprofessed to see traces of the old lunacy, and to be doubtful as to\r\nher cure. At the worst, however, here she was--one of themselves whom\r\nthey must receive; and common sense dictated that they should make the\r\nbest of her, and hope all things till they proved some.\r\n\r\nThere was one among them whom Leam longed yet dreaded to meet. This\r\nwas Alick Corfield. She wondered what he knew, or rather what he\r\nsuspected, and she was anxious to have her ordeal over. But,\r\nthough Mrs. Corfield came, and was just the same as ever, bustling,\r\ninquisitive, dogmatic, before ten minutes were over having put the\r\ngirl through her scholastic facings and got from her the whole of her\r\ncurriculum, yet Alick did not appear. He waited until after Sunday,\r\nwhen he should see her first in church, and so nerve himself as it\r\nwere behind the barrier of his sacred office; but after Sunday had\r\npassed and he had seen her in her old place, he called, and found her\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nWhen they met, and she looked into his face and laid her hand in his,\r\nshe knew all. He shared her secret, and knew what she had done. It was\r\nnot that he was either distant or familiar, cold or disrespectful,\r\nor anything but glad and reverent; nevertheless, he knew. He was no\r\nlonger the boy adorer, her slave, her dog: he was her friend, and\r\nhe wished to make her feel that she was safe with him--known, in his\r\npower, but safe.\r\n\r\n\"You are changed,\" he said awkwardly.\r\n\r\nHe thought of her as Leam, heard her always called Leam, but he dared\r\nnot use the familiar name, and yet she was not \"Miss Dundas\" to him.\r\n\r\n\"It is four years since you saw me,\" she said with a grave smile. \"It\r\nwas time to change.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you are your old self too,\" he returned eagerly. He would have\r\nno disloyalty done to the queen of his boyish dreams: what worm soever\r\nwas at its root, his royal pomegranate flower should be always set\r\nfair in the sun where he might be.\r\n\r\n\"You seem much changed too,\" she said after a short pause--\"graver and\r\nolder. Is that because you are a clergyman?\"\r\n\r\nAlick turned his eyes away from the girl's face, and looked mournfully\r\nout onto the autumn woods. \"Partly,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"And the other part?\" asked Leam, pressing to know the worst.\r\n\r\n\"And the other part?\" He looked at her, and his wan face grew paler.\r\n\"Well, never mind the other part. There are things which sometimes\r\ncome into a man's life and wither it for ever, as a fire passing over\r\na green tree, but we do not speak of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"To no one?\"\r\n\r\n\"To no one.\"\r\n\r\nLeam sighed. No proclamation could have made the thing clearer between\r\nthem. Henceforth she was in Alick's power: let him be faithful,\r\nchivalrous, loyal, devoted, what you will, she was no longer her own\r\nunshared property. He knew what she was, and in so far was her master.\r\n\r\nPoor Alick! This was not the light in which he held his fatal secret.\r\nTrue, he knew what she had done, and that his young queen, his ideal,\r\nwas a murderess, who, if the truth were made public, would be degraded\r\nbelow the level of the poorest wretch that had kept an honest name;\r\nbut he felt himself more accursed than she, in that he had been the\r\nmeans whereby she had gotten both her knowledge and the power to use\r\nit. He was the doomed if innocent, as of old tragic times--the sinless\r\nCain guilty of murder, but guiltless in intent. It was for this, as\r\nmuch as for the love and poetry of the boyish days, that he felt he\r\nowed himself to Leam--that his life was hers, and all his energies\r\nwere to be devoted for her good. It was for this that he had prayed\r\nwith such intensity of earnestness it seemed to him sometimes as if\r\nhis soul had left his body, and had gone up to the Most High to pluck\r\nby force of passionate entreaty the pardon he besought: \"Pardon her, O\r\nLord! Turn her heart, enlighten her understanding, convince her of her\r\nsin; but pardon her, pardon her, dear Lord! And with her, pardon me.\"\r\n\r\nThe man's whole life was spent in this one wild, fervid prayer. All\r\nthat he did was tinged with the sentiment of winning grace for her and\r\npardon for both. In his own mind they stood hand in hand together;\r\nand if he was the intercessor, they were both to benefit, and neither\r\nwould be saved without the other. And he believed in the value of his\r\nprayers and in the objective reality of their influence.\r\n\r\nFor the final changes in the ordering of home and society at North\r\nAston, the week after Leam returned Edgar Harrowby came from India,\r\nand took up his position as the owner of the Hill estate; and the\r\nchild Fina was brought to Ford House, and formally invested with\r\nher new name and condition as Miss Fina Dundas, Sebastian's younger\r\ndaughter. Mindful of the past, Mr. Dundas expected to have a stormy\r\nscene with Leam when he told her his intentions respecting poor\r\nmadame's child; but Leam answered quietly, \"Very well, papa,\" and\r\ngreeted Fina when she arrived benevolently, if not effusively. She was\r\nnot one of those born mothers who love babies from their early nursery\r\ndays, but she was kind to the child in her grave way, and seemed\r\nanxious to do well by her.\r\n\r\nThe ladies all bestowed on her their nursery recipes and systems\r\nin rich abundance--especially Mrs. Birkett, who, though glad to be\r\nrelieved from the hourly task of watching and contending, was still\r\nimmensely interested in the little creature, and gave daily counsel\r\nand superintendence. So that on the whole Leam was not left unaided\r\nwith her charge. On the contrary, she ran great risk of being\r\nbewildered by her multiplicity of counselors, and of entering in\r\nconsequence on that zigzag course which covers much ground and makes\r\nbut little progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nEDGAR HARROWBY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThirty-two years of age; tall, handsome, well set-up, and every inch\r\na soldier; manly in bearing, but also with that grace of gesture and\r\nsoftness of speech which goes by the name of polished manner; a\r\nbold sportsman, ignorant of physical fear, to whom England was the\r\nculmination of the universe, and such men as he--gentlemen, officers,\r\nsquires--the culmination of humanity; a man who loved women as\r\ncreatures, but despised them as intelligences; who respected socially\r\nthe ladies of his own class, and demanded that they should be without\r\nstain, as befits the wives and mothers and sisters of gentlemen, but\r\nwho thought women of a meaner grade fair game for the roving fowler; a\r\nconservative, holding to elemental differences whence arise the value\r\nof races, the dignity of family and the righteousness of caste; an\r\nhereditary landowner, regarding landed property as a sacred possession\r\nmeant only for the few and not to be suffered to lapse into low-born\r\nhands; a gentleman, incapable of falsehood, treachery, meanness,\r\nsocial dishonor, but not incapable of injustice, tyranny, selfishness,\r\neven cruelty, if such came in his way as the privilege of his\r\nrank,--this was Edgar Harrowby as the world saw and his friends knew\r\nhim, and as North Aston had henceforth to know him.\r\n\r\nHis return caused immense local excitement and great rejoicing. It\r\nseemed to set the social barometer at \"fair,\" and to promise a spell\r\nof animation such as North Aston had been long wanting. And indeed\r\npersonally for himself it was time that Major Harrowby was at home and\r\nat the head of his own affairs. Matters had been going rather badly on\r\nthe estate without him, and the need of a strong hand to keep agents\r\nstraight and tenants up to the mark had been making itself somewhat\r\ndisastrously felt during the last three or four years. Wherefore\r\nhe had sold out, broken all his ties in India handsomely, as he had\r\nbroken them in London handsomely once before, when, mad with jealousy,\r\nhe had fled like a thief in the night, burned his boats behind him,\r\nand, as he thought, obliterated every trace by which that loved and\r\ngraceless woman could discover his real name or family holding; and\r\nnow had come home prepared to do his duty to society and himself. That\r\nis, prepared to marry a nice girl of his own kind, keep the estate\r\nwell in hand, and set an example of respectability and orthodoxy,\r\nfamily prayers and bold riding, according to the ideal of the English\r\ncountry gentleman.\r\n\r\nBut, above all, he must marry. And the wife provided for him by the\r\neternal fitness of things was Adelaide Birkett. Who else could be\r\nfound to suit the part so perfectly? She was well-born, well-mannered;\r\nthough not coarsely robust, yet healthy in the sense of purity\r\nof blood; and she was decidedly pretty. So far to the good of the\r\nHarrowby stock in the future. Neither was she too young, though by\r\nreason of her quiet country life her twenty-four years did not count\r\nmore to her in wear and tear of feeling and the doubtful moulding of\r\nexperience than if she had lived through one London season. She was a\r\ngirl of acknowledged good sense, calm, equable, holding herself in the\r\nstrictest leash of ladylike reserve, and governing all her emotions\r\nwithout trouble, patent or unconfessed. Hers was a character which\r\nwould never floreate into irregular beauties to give her friends\r\nanxiety and crowd her life with embarrassing consequences. She\r\ndespised sentiment and ridiculed enthusiasm, thought skepticism both\r\nwicked and disreputable, but at the same time fanaticism was silly,\r\nand not nearly so respectable as that quiet, easy-going religion which\r\ndoes nothing of which society would disapprove, but does not break its\r\nheart in trying to found the kingdom of God on earth.\r\n\r\nAll her relations with life and society would be blameless, orthodox,\r\nladylike and thoroughly English. As a wife she would preach submission\r\nin public and practice domination and the moral repression belonging\r\nto the superior being in private. As a mother she would take care\r\nto have experienced nurses and well-bred governesses, who would look\r\nafter the children properly, when she would wash her hands of further\r\ntrouble and responsibility, save to teach them good manners at\r\nluncheon and self-control in their evening visit to the drawing-room\r\nfor the \"children's half hour\" before dinner. As the mistress of an\r\nestablishment she would be strict, demanding perfect purity in the\r\nmorals of her servants, not suffering waste, nor followers, nor\r\nkitchen amusements that she knew of, nor kitchen individuality anyhow.\r\nHer servants would be her serfs, and she would assume to have bought\r\nthem by food and wages in soul as well as body, in mind as well as\r\nmuscle. She would give broken meat in moderation to the deserving\r\npoor, but she would let those who are not deserving do the best they\r\ncould with want at home and inclemency abroad; and she would have\r\ncalled it fostering vice had she fed the husbandless mother when\r\nhungry or clothed the drunkard's children when naked. She would never\r\nbe talked about for extremes or eccentricities of any kind; and the\r\nworld would be forced to mention her with respect when it mentioned\r\nher at all, having indeed no desire to do otherwise. For she was of\r\nthe kind dear to the heart of England--one of those who are called the\r\nsalt of the earth, and who are assumed to keep society safe and\r\npure. She was incredulous of science, contemptuous of superstition,\r\nimpatient of new ideas--appreciating art, but holding artists as\r\ninferior creatures, like actors, acrobats and newspaper writers. She\r\nwas loyal to the queen and royal family, the nobility and Established\r\nChurch, bracketing republicans with atheists, and both with unpunished\r\nfelons; as also classing immorality, the facts of physiology and the\r\ndetails of disease in a group together, as things horrible and not to\r\nbe spoken of before ladies. She was not slow to believe evil of her\r\nneighbors, maintaining, indeed, that to be spoken of at all was proof\r\nsufficient of undesirable conduct; but she would never investigate a\r\ncharge, preferring rather to accept it in its vile integrity than to\r\nsoil her hands by attempting to unweave its dirty threads; hence she\r\nwould be pitiless, repellent, but she would never make herself the\r\nfocus of gossip. She was a human being if you will, a Christian in\r\ncreed and name assuredly; but beyond and above all things she was\r\na well-mannered, well-conducted English lady, a person of spotless\r\nmorals and exquisite propriety, in the presence of whom humanity must\r\nnot be human, truth truthful, nor Nature natural.\r\n\r\nThis was the wife for Edgar Harrowby as a country gentleman--the\r\nwoman whom Mrs. Harrowby would have chosen out of thousands to be her\r\ndaughter-in-law, whom his sisters would like, who would do credit to\r\nhis name and position; and whom he himself would find as good for his\r\npurpose as any within the four seas.\r\n\r\nFor when Edgar married he would marry on social and rational grounds:\r\nhe would not commit the mistake of fancying that he need love the\r\nwoman as he had loved some others. He would marry her, whoever\r\nshe might be, because she would be of a good family and reasonable\r\ncharacter, fairly handsome, unexceptionable in conduct, not tainted\r\nwith hereditary disease nor disgraced by ragged relatives, having\r\nnothing to do with vice or poverty in the remotest link of her\r\nconnections--a woman fit to be the keeper of his house, the bearer\r\nof his name, the mother of his children. But for love, passion,\r\nenthusiasm, sentiment--Edgar thought all such emotional impedimenta\r\nas these not only superfluous, but oftentimes disastrous in the grave\r\ncampaign of matrimony.\r\n\r\nIt was for this marriage that Adelaide had saved herself. She believed\r\nthat any woman can marry any man if she only wills to do so; and from\r\nthe day when she was seventeen, and they had had a picnic at Dunaston,\r\nshe had made up her mind to marry Edgar Harrowby. When he came home\r\nfor good, unmarried and unengaged, she knew that she should succeed;\r\nand Edgar knew it too. He knew it so well after he had been at home\r\nabout a week that if anything could have turned him against the wife\r\ncarved out for him by circumstance and fitness, it would have been the\r\nalmost fatal character of that fitness, as if Fortune had not left him\r\na choice in the matter.\r\n\r\n\"And what do you think of Adelaide?\" asked Mrs. Harrowby one day when\r\nher son said that he had been to the rectory. \"You have seen her twice\r\nnow: what is your impression of her?'\"\r\n\r\n\"She is prettier than ever--improved, I should say, all through,\" was\r\nhis answer.\r\n\r\nMrs. Harrowby smiled. \"She is a girl I like,\" she said. \"She is so\r\nsensible and has such nice feeling about things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Edgar, \"she is thoroughly well-bred.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have seen a great deal of her of late years,\" Mrs. Harrowby\r\ncontinued, angling dexterously. \"She and the girls are fast friends,\r\nespecially she and Josephine, though there is certainly some slight\r\ndifference of age between them. But Adelaide prefers their society\r\nto that of any one about the neighborhood. And I think that of itself\r\nshows such good taste and nice feeling.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it does,\" said Edgar with dutiful assent, not exactly seeing for\r\nhimself what constituted Adelaide's good taste and nice feeling in\r\nthis preference for his dull and doleful sisters over the brighter\r\ncompanionship of the Fairbairns, say, or any other of the local\r\nnymphs. To him those elderly maiden sisters of his were rather bores\r\nthan otherwise, but he was not displeased that Adelaide Birkett\r\nthought differently. If it \"ever came to anything,\" it would be better\r\nthat they satisfied her than that she should find them uncongenial.\r\n\r\n\"She is coming up to dinner this evening,\" Mrs. Harrowby went on to\r\nsay; and Edgar smiled, pulled his moustaches and looked half puzzled\r\nif wholly pleased.\r\n\r\n\"She is a pretty girl,\" he said with the imbecility of a man who ought\r\nto speak and who has nothing to say, also who has something that he\r\ndoes not wish to say.\r\n\r\n\"She is better than pretty--she is good,\" returned Mrs. Harrowby;\r\nand Edgar, not caring to discuss Adelaide on closer ground with his\r\nmother, strolled away into his private room, where he sat before the\r\nfire smoking, meditating on his life in the past and his prospects\r\nin the future, and wondering how he would like it when he had finally\r\nabjured the freedom of bachelorhood and had taken up with matrimony\r\nand squiredom for the remainder of his natural life.\r\n\r\nPunctually at seven Adelaide Birkett appeared. This, too, was one\r\nof her minor virtues: she was exact. Mind, person, habits, all were\r\nregulated with the nicest method, and she knew as little of hurry as\r\nof delay, and as little of both as of passion.\r\n\r\n\"You are such a dear, good punctual girl!\" said Josephine\r\naffectionately--Josephine, whose virtues had a few more, loose ends\r\nand knots untied than had her friend's.\r\n\r\n\"It is so vulgar to be unpunctual,\" said Adelaide with her calm\r\ngood-breeding. \"It seems to me only another form of uncleanliness and\r\ndisorder.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Edgar is so punctual too!\" cried Josephine by way of commentary.\r\n\r\nAdelaide smiled, not broadly, not hilariously, only to the exact shade\r\ndemanded by conversational sympathy. \"Then we shall agree in this,\"\r\nshe said quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh I am sure you will agree, and in more than this,\" Josephine\r\nreturned, almost with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nHad she not been the willing nurse of this affair from the\r\nbeginning?--if not the open confidante, yet secretly holding the key\r\nto her younger friend's mind and actions? and was she not, like all\r\nthe kindly disappointed, intensely sympathetic with love-matters,\r\nwhether wise or foolish, hopeful or hopeless?\r\n\r\n\"Who is it that you are sure will agree with Miss Adelaide, if any one\r\nindeed could be found to disagree with her?\" asked Edgar, standing in\r\nthe doorway.\r\n\r\nJosephine laughed with the silliness of a weak woman \"caught.\" She\r\nlooked at Adelaide slyly. Adelaide turned her quiet face, unflushed,\r\nunruffled, and neither laughed sillily nor looked slyly.\r\n\r\n\"She was praising me for punctuality; and then she said that you were\r\npunctual too,\" she explained cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\"We learn that in the army,\" said Edgar.\r\n\r\n\"But I have had to learn it without the army,\" she answered.\r\n\r\n\"Which shows that you have by the grace of nature what I have attained\r\nonly by discipline and art,\" said Edgar gallantly.\r\n\r\nAdelaide smiled. She did not disdain the compliment. On the contrary,\r\nshe wished to impress it on Edgar that she accepted his praises\r\nbecause they were her due. She knew that the world takes us if not\r\nquite at our own valuation, yet as being the character we assume to\r\nbe. It all depends on our choice of a mask and to what ideal self we\r\ndress. If we are clever and dress in keeping, without showing chinks\r\nor discrepancies, no one will find out that it is only a mask; and\r\nthose of us are most successful in gaining the good-will of our\r\nfellows who understand this principle the most clearly and act on it\r\nthe most consistently.\r\n\r\nThe evening was a pleasant one for Adelaide, being an earnest of the\r\nfuture for which, if she had not worked hard, she had controlled much.\r\nEdgar sang solos to her accompaniment, and put in his rich baritone to\r\nher pure if feeble soprano; he played chess with her for an hour, and\r\npraised her play, as it deserved: naturally, not thinking it necessary\r\nto make love to his sisters, he paid her almost exclusive attention,\r\nand looked the admiration he felt. She really was a very pretty young\r\nwoman, and she had unexceptionable manners; and having cut himself\r\nadrift from his ties and handsomely released himself from his\r\nobligations, he was not disposed to take much trouble in looking far\r\nafield for a wife when here was one ready-made to his hand. Still,\r\nhe was not so rash as to commit himself too soon. Fine play is never\r\nprecipitate; and even the most lordly lover, if an English gentleman,\r\nthinks it seemly to pretend to woo the woman whom he means to take,\r\nand who he knows will yield.\r\n\r\nAnd on her side Adelaide was too well-bred for the one part, and too\r\nwise for the other, to clutch prematurely at the prize she had willed\r\nshould be hers. Her actions must be like her gestures, graceful,\r\nrhythmic, rather slow than hurried, and bearing the stamp of purpose\r\nand deliberation. When Edgar should make his offer, as she knew he\r\nwould, she would ask for time to reflect and make up her mind. This\r\nwould be doing the thing properly and with due regard to her own\r\ndignity; for no husband of hers should ever have cause to think that\r\nshe held her marriage with him as a thing so undeniably advantageous\r\nthere was no doubt of her acceptance from the first. Every woman must\r\nmake herself difficult, thought Adelaide, if she wishes to be prized,\r\neven the woman who for seven years has fixed her eyes steadily on one\r\npoint, and has determined that she will finally capture a certain man\r\nand land him as her lifelong possession.\r\n\r\nThus the evening passed, with a subtle undercurrent of concealed\r\nresolves flowing beneath its surface admiration that gave it a\r\npeculiar charm to the two people principally concerned--the one\r\nfeeling that she had advanced her game by an important move; the\r\nother, that the eternal fitness of things 'was making itself more\r\nand-more evident, and that it was manifest to all his senses\r\nwhom Providence had destined for his wife, and for what ultimate\r\nmatrimonial end he had been shaped and spared.\r\n\r\nA book of photographs was on the table.\r\n\r\n\"Are you here?\" asked Edgar, lowering his bright blue eyes on\r\nAdelaide as she sat on a small chair at Mrs. Harrowby's feet, carrying\r\ndaughterly incense to that withered shrine.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think so,\" she answered.\r\n\r\nHe turned the pages carefully--passing over his sisters in wide\r\ncrinolines and spoon bonnets; his mother, photographed from an old\r\npicture, in a low dress and long dropping bands of hair, like a\r\nmouflon's ears, about her face; Fred and himself, both as boys in\r\nScotch suits, set stiffly against the table like dolls--with gradual\r\nimprovement in art and style, till he came to a page where Adelaide's\r\nfair vignetted head of large size was placed side by side with\r\nanother, also vignetted and also large.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! there you are; and what a capital likeness!\" cried Edgar, with\r\nthe joyous look and accent of one meeting an old friend, giving that\r\ngauge of interest which we all unconsciously give when we first see\r\nthe photograph of a well-known face. He looked at the portrait long\r\nand critically. \"Only not so pretty,\" he added gallantly. \"Those\r\nfellows cannot catch the spirit: they give only the outside forms, and\r\nnot always these correctly. Here is a striking face,\" he continued,\r\npointing to Adelaide's companion-picture--a girl with masses of dark\r\nhair, dark eyes, large, mournful, heavily fringed with long lashes,\r\nand a grave, sad face, that seemed listening rather than looking. \"Who\r\nis she? She looks foreign.\"\r\n\r\nAdelaide glanced at the page, as if she did not know it by heart.\r\n\"That? Oh! that is only Leam Dundas,\" she said with the faintest,\r\nfinest flavor of scorn in her voice.\r\n\r\n\"Leam Dundas?\" repeated Edgar--\"the daughter of that awful woman?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and nearly as odd as the mother,\" answered Adelaide, still in\r\nthe same cold manner and with the same accent of superior scorn.\r\n\r\n\"At least she used to be, you mean, dear, but she is more like other\r\npeople now,\" said kindly Josephine, more just than politic.\r\n\r\nAdelaide looked at her calmly, indifferently. \"Yes, I suppose she is\r\nrather less savage than of old,\" was her reply, \"but I do not see much\r\nof her,\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not remember to have ever seen her: she must have been a mere\r\nchild when I was here last,\" said Edgar.\r\n\r\n\"She is nineteen now, I think,\" said Mrs. Harrowby.\r\n\r\n\"Not more?\" repeated Adelaide. \"I imagined she was one-and-twenty at\r\nthe least. She looks so very much older than even this--five or six\r\nand twenty, full; dark people age so quickly.\"\r\n\r\n\"She seems to be superbly handsome,\" Edgar said, still looking at the\r\nportrait.\r\n\r\n\"For those who like that swarthy kind of beauty. For myself, I do not:\r\nit always reminds me of negroes and Lascars.\"\r\n\r\nAdelaide leaned forward, and made pretence to examine Leam's portrait\r\nwith critical independence of judgment. She spoke as if this was the\r\nfirst time she had seen it, and her words the thought of the moment\r\nresulting.\r\n\r\n\"There is no negroid taint here,\" Edgar answered gravely. \"It is the\r\nface of a sibyl, of a tragedian.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think so? It is fine in outline certainly, but too monotonous\r\nto please me, and too lugubrious; and the funny part of it is,\r\nthere is nothing in her. She looks like a sibyl, but she is the most\r\nprofoundly stupid person you can imagine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not now, Addy: she has wakened up a good deal,\" again interposed\r\nJosephine with her love of justice and want of tact.\r\n\r\n\"But do you not see the mother in her, Josephine? I do, painfully; and\r\nthe mother was such a horror! Leam is just like her. She will grow her\r\nexact counterpart\"\r\n\r\n\"A bad model enough,\" said Edgar; \"but this face is not bad. It has\r\nmore in it than poor old Pepita's. How fat she was!\"\r\n\r\n\"So will Leam be when she is as old,\" said Adelaide quietly. \"And do\r\nyou think these dark people ever look clean? I don't,\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a drawback certainly,\" laughed Edgar, running through the\r\nremainder of the book.\r\n\r\nBut he turned back again to the page which held Leam and Adelaide side\r\nby side, and he spoke of the latter while he looked at the former. The\r\nface of Leam Dundas, mournful, passionate, concentrated as it was,\r\nhad struck his imagination--struck it as none other had done since the\r\ntime when he had met that grand and graceful woman wandering, lost in\r\na fog, in St. James's Park, and had protected from possible annoyance\r\ntill he had landed her in St. John's Wood. He was glad that Leam\r\nDundas lived in North Aston, and that he should see her without\r\ntrouble or overt action; and as he handed Adelaide into her carriage\r\nhe noticed for the first time that her blue eyes were not quite even,\r\nthat her flaxen hair had not quite enough color, and that her face, if\r\npure and fair, was slightly insipid.\r\n\r\n\"Poor, dear Adelaide!\" he said when he returned to the drawing-room,\r\n\"how nice she is! but how tart she was about this Leam Dundas of\r\nyours! Looks like jealousy; and very likely is. All you women are so\r\nhorribly jealous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not all of us,\" said Maria hastily.\r\n\r\n\"And I do not think that Adelaide is,\" said Josephine. \"She has no\r\ncause; for though Leam is certainly very lovely, and seems to have\r\nimproved immensely for being at school, still she and Addy do not come\r\ninto collision any way, and I do not see why she should be jealous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps Edgar admired her photograph too much,\" said Fanny, who\r\nwas the stupid one of the three, but on occasions made the shrewdest\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\nEdgar laughed, not displeasedly. \"That would be paying me too high a\r\ncompliment,\" he said.\r\n\r\nWhereat his three sisters echoed \"Compliment!\" in various tones of\r\ndeprecation, and Josephine added a meaning little laugh for her own\r\nshare, for which Edgar gave her a kiss, and said in a bantering kind\r\nof voice, \"Now, Joseph! mind what you are about!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nON THE MOOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a gray and gusty day in November, with heavy masses of\r\nlow-lying clouds rolling tumultuously overhead, and a general look\r\nof damp and decay about the fields and banks--one of those melancholy\r\ndays of the late autumn which make one long for the more varied\r\ncircumstances of confessed winter, when the deep blue shadows in the\r\ncrisp snow suggest the glory of southern skies, and the sparkle of the\r\nsun on the delicate tracery of the frosted branches has a mimicry of\r\nlife, such as we imagine strange elves and fairies might create.\r\n\r\nThere was no point of color in the landscape save the brown foliage of\r\nthe shivering beech trees, a few coarse splashes of yellow weeds, and\r\nhere and there a trail of dying crimson leaves threading the barren\r\nhedgerows. Everything was \"sombre, lifeless, mournful\", and even Edgar\r\nHarrowby, though by no means sentimentally impressionable to outward\r\nconditions, felt, as he rode through the deserted lanes and looked\r\nabroad over the stagnant country, that life on the off-hunt days was\r\nbut a slow-kind of thing at North Aston, and that any incident which\r\nshould break the dead monotony of the scene would be welcome.\r\n\r\nHe had been thinking a great deal of Adelaide for the last four or\r\nfive days, since she had dined at the Hill, and making up his mind to\r\ntake the final plunge before long. He was not in love with her, but\r\nshe suited, as has been said; and that was as good as love to\r\nEdgar, who had now to take up his squiredom and country gentleman's\r\nrespectability, after having had his share of a young man's \"fling\" in\r\nrather larger proportion than falls to the lot of most. All the same,\r\nhe wished that her face had more expression and that her eyes were\r\nperfectly straight; and he wanted to see Leam Dundas.\r\n\r\nHe had made a long round to-day, and was turning now homeward, when,\r\nas he had almost crossed the moor, athwart which his road led, he saw\r\nstanding on a little hillock, away from the main track, the slight\r\nfigure of a woman sharply defined against the sky. She was alone,\r\ndoing nothing, not seeming to be looking at anything--just standing\r\nthere on the hillock, facing the north-west, as if for pleasure in the\r\nrough freshness of the breeze.\r\n\r\nThe wind blew back her dress, and showed her girlish form, supple,\r\nflexible, graceful, fashioned like some nymph of olden time. From her\r\nsmall feet, arched and narrow, gripping the ground like feet of steel,\r\nto the slender throat on which her head was set with so much grace\r\nof line, yet with no sense of over-weighting in its tender curves, an\r\nexpression of nervous energy underlying her fragile litheness of form,\r\na look of strength--not muscular nor the strength of bulk or weight,\r\nbut the strength of fibre, will, tenacity--seemed to mark her out as\r\nsomething different from the herd.\r\n\r\nEdgar scarcely gave this vague impression words in his own mind, but\r\nhe was conscious of a new revelation of womanhood, and he scented an\r\nadventure in this solitary figure facing the north-west wind on the\r\nlonely moor.\r\n\r\nHer very dress, too, had a character of its own in harmony with the\r\nrest--black all through, save for the scarlet feather in her hat,\r\nwhich burnt like a flame against the gray background of the sky;\r\nand her whole attitude had something of defiance in its profound\r\nstillness, while standing so boldly against the strong blasts that\r\nswept across the heights, which caught his imagination, at that\r\nmoment ready to be inflamed. All things depend on times and moods, and\r\nEdgar's mood at this moment of first seeing Leam Dundas was favorable\r\nfor the reception of new impressions.\r\n\r\nFor, of course, it was Leam--Leam, who, since her return from school,\r\nalone and without companionship, was feverish often, and often\r\nimpelled to escape into the open country from something that oppressed\r\nher down in the valley too painfully to be borne. She had never been\r\na confidential nor an expansive schoolfellow; not even an affectionate\r\none as girls count affection, seeing that she neither kissed nor\r\ncried, nor quarreled nor made up--neither stood as a model of\r\nfidelity nor changed her girl-lovers in anticipation of future\r\ninconstancies--writing a love-letter to Ada to-day and a copy of\r\nverses to Ethel to-morrow--but had kept with all the same quiet\r\ngravity and gentle reticence which seemed to watch rather than share,\r\nand to be more careful not to offend than solicitous to win.\r\n\r\nAll the same, she missed her former comrades now that she had lost\r\nthem; but most of all she missed the wholesome occupation and mental\r\nemployment of her studies. Left as she was to herself, thoughts and\r\nmemories were gathering up from the background where they had lain\r\ndormant if extant all these years, and through her solitude were\r\ngetting a vitality which made her stand still in a kind of breathless\r\nagony, wondering where they would lead her and in what they would end.\r\nAt times such a burning sense of sin would flash over her that she\r\nfelt as if she must confess that hideous fact of her girlish past. It\r\nseemed so shameful that she should be living there among the rest, a\r\ncriminal with the innocent, and not tell them what she was. Then the\r\ninstinct of self-preservation would carry it over her conscience, and\r\nshe would press back her thoughts and go out, as to-day, to cool her\r\nfeverish blood, and grow calm to bear and strong to hold the heavy\r\nburden which she had fashioned by her own mad deed and laid for life\r\non her own hands.\r\n\r\nIf only the ladies had not insisted so strongly on mamma's personality\r\nin heaven! if only they had not lighted up her imagination, her\r\nloyalty, by this tremendous torch of faith and love! How bitterly she\r\nregretted the childish fanaticism which had made her imagine herself\r\nthe providence of that beloved memory, the avenger of those shadowy\r\nwrongs! Oh, if she could undo the past and call madame back to life!\r\nShe would kiss her now, and even call her mamma if it would please her\r\nand papa. So she stood on the hillock facing the north-west, thinking\r\nthese things and regretting in vain.\r\n\r\nAs Edgar came riding by his large black hound dashed off to Leam and\r\nbarked furiously, all four paws planted on the ground as if preparing\r\nfor a spring. The beast had probably no malice, and might have meant\r\nit merely as his method of saying, \"Who are you?\" but he looked\r\nformidable, and Leam started back and cried, \"Down, dog! go away!\" in\r\na voice half angry and half afraid.\r\n\r\nThen Edgar saw the face, and knew who she was. He rode across the\r\nturf, calling off his dog, and came up to her. It was an opportunity,\r\nand Edgar Harrowby was a man who knew how to take advantage of\r\nopportunities. It was in his creed to thank Providence for favorable\r\nchances by making the most of them, and this was a chance of which it\r\nwould be manifestly ungrateful not to make the most. It was far more\r\npicturesque to meet her for the first time, as now, on the wild moor\r\non a gusty gray November day, than in the gloomy old drawing-room at\r\nthe Hill. It gave a flavor of romance and the forbidden which was not\r\nwithout its value in the beginning of an acquaintance with such a face\r\nas Leam's. Nevertheless, in spite of the romance that hung about the\r\ncircumstance, his first words were common-place enough. \"I hope my dog\r\nhas not alarmed you?\" he said, lifting his hat.\r\n\r\nLeam looked at him with those wonderful eyes of hers, that seemed\r\nsomehow to look through him. She, standing on her hillock, was\r\nslightly higher than Edgar sitting on his horse; and her head was bent\r\nas she looked down on him, giving her attitude and gesture something\r\nof a dignified assumption of superiority, more like the Leam of the\r\npast than of the present. \"No, I was not alarmed,\" she said. \"But I\r\ndo not like to be barked at,\" she added, an echo of the old childish\r\nsense of injury from circumstance that was so quaint and pretty in her\r\nhalf-complaining voice.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose not: how should you?\" answered Edgar with sympathetic\r\nenergy. \"Rover is a good-old fellow, but he has the troublesome trick\r\nof giving tongue unnecessarily. He would not have hurt you, but I\r\nshould be very sorry to think he had frightened you. To heel, sir!\"\r\nangrily.\r\n\r\n\"No, he did not frighten me.\" repeated Leam.\r\n\r\nNever loquacious, there was something about this man's face and\r\nmanner, his masterful spirit underneath his courteous bearing, his\r\nlook of masculine power and domination, his admiring eyes that fixed\r\nthemselves on her so unflinchingly--not with insolence, but as if he\r\nhad the prescriptive right of manhood to look at her, only a woman, as\r\nhe chose, he commanding and she obeying--that quelled and silenced\r\nher even beyond her wont. He was the first gentleman of noteworthy\r\nappearance who had ever spoken to her--not counting Alick, nor\r\nthe masters who had taught her at school, nor Mr. Birkett, nor Mr.\r\nFairbairn, as gentlemen of noteworthy appearance--and the first of all\r\nthings has a special influence over young minds.\r\n\r\n\"You are brave to walk so far alone: you ought to have a dog like\r\nRover to protect you,\" Edgar said, still looking at her with those\r\nunflinching eyes, which oppressed her even when she did not see them.\r\n\r\n\"I am not brave, and I do not care for dogs. Besides, I do not often\r\nwalk so far as this; but I felt the valley stifling to-day,\" answered\r\nLeam, in her matter-of-fact, categorical way.\r\n\r\n\"All the same, you ought to have protection,\" Edgar said\r\nauthoritatively, and Leam did not reply.\r\n\r\nShe only looked at him earnestly, wondering against what she should\r\nbe protected, having abandoned by this time her belief in banditti and\r\nwild beasts.\r\n\r\nIf his eyes oppressed her, hers half embarrassed him. There was such\r\na strange mixture of intensity and innocence in them, he scarcely knew\r\nhow to meet them.\r\n\r\n\"It is absurd to pretend that we do not know each other,\" then said\r\nEdgar after a short pause, smiling; and his smile was very sweet and\r\npleasant. \"You are Miss Dundas--I am Edgar Harrowby.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know,\" Leam answered.\r\n\r\n\"How is that?\" he asked, \"_I_ knew _you_ from your photograph--once\r\nseen not to be forgotten again,\" gallantly--\"but how should you know\r\nme?\"\r\n\r\nLeam raised her eyes from the ground where she had cast them. Those\r\nslow full looks, intense, tragic, fixed, had a startling effect of\r\nwhich she was wholly unconscious. Edgar felt his own grow dark and\r\ntender as he met hers. If the soul and mind within only answered to\r\nthe mask without, what queen or goddess could surpass this half-breed\r\nSpanish girl, this country-born, unnoted, but glorious Leam Dundas? he\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\"And I knew you from yours,\" she answered.\r\n\r\n\"An honor beyond my deserts,\" said Edgar.\r\n\r\nNot that he thought the notice of a girl, even with such a face\r\nas this, beyond his deserts. Indeed, if a queen or a goddess had\r\ncondescended to him, it would not have been a grace beyond his merits;\r\nbut it sounded pretty to say so, and served to make talk as well as\r\nanything else. And to make talk was the main business on hand at this\r\npresent moment.\r\n\r\n\"Why an honor?\" asked Leam, ignorant of the elements of flirting.\r\n\r\nEdgar smiled again, and this time his smile without words troubled\r\nher. It seemed the assertion of superior intelligence, contemptuous,\r\nif half pitiful of her ignorance. Once so serenely convinced of her\r\nsuperiority, Leam was now as suspicious of her shortcomings, and was\r\nsoon abashed.\r\n\r\nEdgar did not see that he had troubled her. Masterful and masculine\r\nto an eminent degree, the timid doubts and fears of a young girl were\r\nthings he could not recognize. He had no point in his own nature with\r\nwhich they came in contact, so that he should sympathize with them.\r\nHe knew the whole fence and foil of coquetry, the signs of silent\r\nflattery, the sweet language of womanly self-conscious love, whether\r\nwooing or being won; but the fluttering misgivings of youth and\r\nabsolute inexperience were dark to him. All of which he felt conscious\r\nwas that here was something deliciously fresh and original, and that\r\nLeam was more beautiful to look at than Adelaide, and a great deal\r\nmore interesting to talk to.\r\n\r\n\"If you will allow me, now that I have had the pleasure of meeting\r\nyou, I will see you safe for at least part of your way home,\" he said,\r\npassing by her naïve query \"Why an honor?\" as a thing to be answered\r\nonly by that smile of superior wisdom.\r\n\r\nFlinging himself from his horse, he took the bridle in his hand and\r\nturned toward home, looking to the girl to accompany him. Leam felt\r\nthat she could not refuse his escort offered as so much a matter of\r\ncourse. Why should she? It was very pleasant to have some one to walk\r\nwith--some one not her father, with whom she still felt shy, if not\r\nnow absolutely estranged; nor yet Alick, in whose pale face she was\r\nalways reading the past, and who, though he was so good and kind\r\nand tender, was her master and held her in his hand. This handsome,\r\ncourteous gentleman was different from either, and she liked his\r\nsociety and superior ways. And as he began now to talk to her of\r\nthings not trenching on nor admitting of flirtation--chiefly of the\r\nplaces he had visited, India, Egypt, Italy, Spain--she was not so much\r\nabashed by his unflinching looks and masterful manner.\r\n\r\nWhen he entered on Spain and his recollections of what he had seen\r\nthere, the girl's heart throbbed, and her pale face grew whiter still\r\nwith the passionate thrill that stirred her. The old blood was in her\r\nveins yet, and, though modified, and in some sense transformed, she\r\nwas still Pepita's daughter and the child of Andalusia. And here was\r\ntruth; not like that poor wretched madame's talk, which even she had\r\nfound out to be false and only making believe to know what she did not\r\nknow. Spain was the name of power with Learn, as it had been with her\r\nmother, and she lifted her face, white with its passionate desires,\r\nlistening as if entranced to all that Edgar said.\r\n\r\nIt was a good opening, and the handsome soldier-squire congratulated\r\nhimself on his lucky hit and serviceable memory. Presently he touched\r\non Andalusia, and Leam, who hitherto had been listening without\r\ncomment, now broke in eagerly. \"That is my own country!\" she cried.\r\n\"Mamma came from Andalusia, beautiful Andalusia! Ah! how I should like\r\nto go there!\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you will some day,\" Edgar answered a little significantly.\r\n\r\nHad she been more instructed in the kind of thing he meant, she would\r\nhave seen that he wished to convey the idea of a love-journey made\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head and her eyes grew moist and dewy. \"Not now,\" she\r\nsaid mournfully. \"Poor mamma has gone, and there is no one now to take\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will make up a party some day, and you shall be one of us,\" said\r\nEdgar.\r\n\r\nShe brightened all over. \"Ah! that would be delightful!\" she cried,\r\ntaking him seriously. \"When do you think we shall go?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will talk about it,\" Edgar answered, though smiling again--Leam\r\nwished he would not smile so often--a little aghast at her\r\nliteralness, and saying to himself in warning that he must be careful\r\nof what he said to Leam Dundas. It was evident that she did not\r\nunderstand either badinage or a joke. But her very earnestness pleased\r\nhim for all its oddity. It was so unlike the superficiality and\r\nlevity of the modern girl--that hateful Girl of the Period, in whose\r\nexistence he believed, and of whose influence he stood in almost\r\nsuperstitious awe. He liked that grave, intense way of hers, which was\r\nneither puritanical nor stolid, but, on the contrary, full of unspoken\r\npassion, rich in latent concentrated power.\r\n\r\n\"They are very beautiful, are they not?\" Leam asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"What? who?\" was Edgar's answer.\r\n\r\n\"The Andalusian women, and the men,\" returned Leam.\r\n\r\n\"The men are fine-looking fellows enough,\" answered Edgar\r\ncarelessly--\"a little too brutal for my taste, but well-grown men for\r\nall that. But I have seen prettier women out of Spain than in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mamma used to say they were so beautiful--the most beautiful of\r\nall the women in the world; and the best.\" Leam said this with a\r\ndisappointed air and her old injured accent.\r\n\r\nEdgar laughed softly. \"The prettiest Andalusian woman I have ever\r\nseen has an English father,\" he answered, with a sudden flush on his\r\nhandsome face as he bent it a little nearer to hers.\r\n\r\n\"How odd!\" said Leam. \"An English father? That is like me.\"\r\n\r\nEdgar looked at her, to read how much of this was real ingenuousness,\r\nhow much affected simplicity. He saw only a candid inquiring face with\r\na faint shade of surprise in its quiet earnestness, unquestionably not\r\naffected.\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" he answered. \"Exactly like you.\"\r\n\r\nHis voice and manner made Leam blush uncomfortably. She was conscious\r\nof something disturbing, without knowing what it was. She first looked\r\nup into his face with the same expression of inquiry as before, then\r\ndown to the earth perplexedly, when suddenly the truth came upon her;\r\nhe meant herself--she was the prettiest Andalusian he had ever seen.\r\n\r\nShe was intensely humiliated at her discovery. Not one of those girls\r\nwho study every feature, every gesture, every point, till there is\r\nnot a square inch of their personality of which they are not painfully\r\nconscious, Leam had never taken herself into artistic consideration\r\nat all. She had been proud of her Spanish blood, of her mantilla, her\r\nhigh comb and her fan; but of herself as a woman among women she knew\r\nnothing, nor whether she was plain or pretty. Indeed, had she had to\r\nsay offhand which, she would have answered plain. The revelation which\r\ncomes sooner or later to all women of the charms they possess had not\r\nyet come to her; and Edgar's words, making the first puncture in\r\nher ignorance, pained her more by the shock which they gave her\r\nself-consciousness than they pleased her by their flattery.\r\n\r\nShe said no more, but walked by his side with her head held very high\r\nand slightly turned away. She was sorry that he had offended her. They\r\nhad been getting on together so well until he had said this foolish\r\nthing, and now they were like friends who had quarreled. She was quite\r\nsorry that he had been so foolish as to offend her, but she must not\r\nforgive him--at least not just yet. It was very wrong of him to tell\r\nher that she was prettier than the true children of the soil; and she\r\nresented the slight to Spain and to her mother, as well as the wrong\r\ndone to herself, by his saying that which was not true. So she walked\r\nwith her little head held high, and Edgar could get nothing more out\r\nof her. When Leam was offended coaxings to make her forget were of no\r\navail. She had to wear through an impression by herself, and it was\r\nuseless to try for a premature pardon.\r\n\r\nEdgar saw that he had overshot the mark, and that his best policy now\r\nwas absence; wherefore, after a few moments' silence, he remounted his\r\nhorse, looking penitent, handsome, full of admiration and downcast.\r\n\r\n\"I hope we shall soon see you at the Hill, Miss Dundas,\" he said,\r\nholding her hand in his for his farewell a little longer than was\r\nquite necessary for good breeding or even cordiality.\r\n\r\n\"I very seldom go to the Hill,\" answered Leam, looking past his head.\r\n\r\n\"But you will come, and soon?\" fervently.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps: I do not know,\" answered Leam, still looking past his head,\r\nand embarrassed to a most uncomfortable extent.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" he said, as if he had been thanking her for the grace of\r\nhis life; and with a long look, lifting his hat again, he rode off,\r\njust escaping by a few hundred yards the danger of being met walking\r\nwith Leam by his sisters and Adelaide Birkett. They were all driving\r\ntogether in the phaeton, and the sisters were making much of their\r\nyoung friend.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Edgar preferred to be met alone and not walking with\r\nLeam. He did not stop the carriage--simply nodded to them all with\r\nfamiliar kindness, as a group of relatives not demanding extra\r\ncourtesy, flinging a few words behind him as he rode on smiling. Nor\r\ndid the ladies in their turn stop for Leam, whom they met soon after\r\nwalking slowly along the road; but Josephine said, as they passed, how\r\npretty Learn looked to-day, and how much softer her face was than it\r\nused to be; and Maria, even Maria, agreed with kindly Joseph, and\r\nwas quite eulogistic on the object of her old disdain. Adelaide sat\r\nsilent, and did not join in their encomiums.\r\n\r\nIt would have been a nice point to ascertain if the Misses Harrowby\r\nwould have praised the girl's beauty as they did had they known\r\nthat she had grown soft and dewy-eyed by talking of Spain with their\r\nbrother Edgar, though she had hardened a little afterward when he told\r\nher that she was the prettiest Andalusian he had ever seen.\r\n\r\nDuring the dinner at the Hill, where Adelaide was one of the family\r\nparty, Edgar mentioned casually how that he had met Miss Dundas on the\r\nmoor, and had had to speak to her because of Rover's misbehavior.\r\n\r\n\"Yes? and what do you think of her?\" asked Mrs. Harrowby with a sharp\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n\"I scarcely know: I have hardly seen her as yet,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Did she say or do anything very extraordinary to-day?\" asked\r\nAdelaide with such an air of contemptuous curiosity as seemed to him\r\ninsufferably insolent.\r\n\r\n\"No, nothing. Is she in the habit of saying or doing extraordinary\r\nthings?\" he answered back, arching his eyebrows and speaking in a\r\nwell-affected tone of sincere inquiry.\r\n\r\n\"At times she is more like a maniac than a sane person,\" said\r\nAdelaide, breaking her bread with deliberation. \"What can you expect\r\nfrom such a parentage and education as hers?\"\r\n\r\nEdgar looked down and smiled satirically. \"Poor Pepita's sins lie\r\nheavy on your mind,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I believe in race,\" was her reply.\r\n\r\n\"Mother,\" then said Edgar after a short silence, \"why do you not have\r\nMiss Dundas to dine here with Adelaide? It would be more amusing\r\nto her, for it must be dull\"--turning to their guest and speaking\r\namiably, considerately--\"I am afraid very dull--to be so often quite\r\nalone with us.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not add what he thought, that it was almost indelicate in her\r\nto be here so often. He was out of humor with her to-day.\r\n\r\n\"She is such an uncertain girl we never know how she may be. I had her\r\nto stay here once, and I do not want to repeat the experiment,\" was\r\nMrs. Harrowby's answer.\r\n\r\n\"But, mamma, that was before she went to school, when she was quite a\r\nchild. She is so much improved now,\" pleaded Josephine.\r\n\r\n\"Good little soul!\" said Edgar under his breath.--\"Wine, Joseph?\"\r\naloud, as his recognition of her good offices.\r\n\r\n\"And I like coming alone best, thanks,\" said Adelaide with unruffled\r\ncalmness. \"Leam has never been my friend; indeed, I do not like her,\r\nand you all,\" to the sisters, with a gracious smile and prettily,\r\n\"have always been my favorite companions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still, she is very lonely, and it would be kind. Besides, she is good\r\nto look at,\" said Edgar.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think so?\" said Mrs. Harrowby with crisp lips and\r\nill-concealed displeasure.\r\n\r\n\"Do I think so, mother? I should have no eyes else. She is superb. I\r\nhave never seen such a face. She is the most beautiful creature I have\r\never known of any nation.\"\r\n\r\nAdelaide's delicate pink cheeks turned pale, and then they flushed a\r\nbrilliant rose as she laid down her spoon and left her jelly untasted.\r\n\r\nThere were no trials of skill at chess, no duets, no solos, this\r\nevening. After dinner Edgar went to his own room and sat there\r\nsmoking. He felt revolted at the idea of spending two or three hours\r\nwith what he irreverently called \"a lot of dull women,\" and preferred\r\nhis own thoughts to their talk. He sauntered into the drawing-room\r\nabout ten minutes before Adelaide had to leave, apologizing for his\r\nabsence on the man's easy plea of \"business,\" saying he was sorry to\r\nhave missed her charming society, and he hoped they should see her\r\nthere soon again, and so on--all in the proper voice and manner,\r\nbut with a certain ring of insincerity in the tones which Adelaide\r\ndetected, if the others did not. But she accepted his excuses with the\r\nmost admirable tact, smiling to the sisters as she said, \"Oh, we\r\nhave been very happy, Josephine, have we not? though,\" with a nice\r\nadmission of Edgar's claims, not too broadly stated nor too warmly\r\nallowed, \"of course it would have been very pleasant if you could have\r\ncome in too.\"\r\n\r\n\"It has been my loss,\" said Edgar.\r\n\r\nShe smiled \"Yes\" by eyes, lips and turn of her graceful head. In\r\nspeech she answered, \"Of that, of course, you are the best judge for\r\nyourself; but none of us here feel as some girls do, lost without\r\ngentlemen to amuse them. We can get on very well by ourselves. Cannot\r\nwe, Joseph?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Josephine said gallantly, \"Yes,\" but her heart was more rueful\r\nthan her voice, and she thought that some gentlemen were very\r\nnice, and that Sebastian Dundas especially made the dull time pass\r\npleasantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE CHILD FINA.\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing surprised the North Astonians more than what it was the\r\nfashion to call \"the admirable manner in which Leam behaved to\r\nthe child Fina.\" If the world which praised her had known all the\r\ncompelling circumstances, would it have called her admirable then? Yet\r\nbeyond those natural promptings of remorse which forced her to do\r\nthe best she could for the child whom her fatal crime had rendered\r\nmotherless, Leam did honestly behave well, if this means doing irksome\r\nthings without complaint and sacrificing self to a sense of right. And\r\nthis was all the more praiseworthy in that sympathy of nature between\r\nthese two young creatures there was none, and the girl's maternal\r\ninstinct was not of that universal kind which makes all children\r\npleasant, whatever they may be. Hence, she did nobly when she did her\r\nduty with the uncompromising exactness characteristic of her; but then\r\nit was only duty, it was not love.\r\n\r\nHow should it be love? Her tenacity and reserve were ill matched with\r\nFina's native inconstancy of purpose and childish incontinence of\r\nspeech; her pride of race resented her father's adoption of a stranger\r\ninto the penetralia of the family; and to share the name she had\r\ninherited from her mother with the daughter of that mother's rival\r\nseemed to her a wrong done to both the living and the dead. Naturally\r\ntaciturn, unjoyful, and ever oppressed by that brooding consciousness\r\nof guilt hanging like a cloud over her memory, formless, vague, but\r\nnever lifting, Fina's changeful temper and tumultuous vivacity were\r\nintensely wearisome to her. Nevertheless, she was forbearing if not\r\nloving, and the people said rightly when they said she was admirable.\r\n\r\nHer grave patience with the little one did more to open her father's\r\nheart to her than did even her own wonderful beauty, which gratified\r\nhis paternal pride of authorship, or than her efforts after docility\r\nto himself--efforts that would have been creditable to any one, and\r\nthat with her were heroic. For Mr. Dundas, being of those clinging,\r\nclasping natures which must love some one, had taken poor madame's\r\nchild into his affections in the wholesale manner so emphatically his\r\nown, now in these first days of his new paternity seeming to live only\r\nfor the little Fina, and never happy but when he had her with him. It\r\nwas the first time that he felt he had had a child of his own; and he\r\ngave her the love which would have been Leam's had Pepita been less\r\nof a savage than she was, and more discreet in the matter of\r\ndoll-dressing.\r\n\r\nThe little round, fair-haired creature, with her picturesque\r\nGainsborough head and rose-red lips, pretty, pleasant, facile, easily\r\namused if easily made cross, divertible from her purpose if she was\r\nbut coaxed and caressed, and if the substitute offered was to her\r\nliking--without tenacity, fluid, floating on the surface of things and\r\nborn of their froth; loving only those who ministered to her pleasure\r\nand were in sight; forgetting yesterday's joys as though they had\r\nnever been, and her dearest the moment they were absent--a child\r\ndeliciously caressing because sensual by temperament and instinctively\r\ndiplomatic, with no latent greatness to be developed as time went on\r\nand the flower set into the fruit. Epitomizing the characteristics of\r\nthe class of which her mother had been a typical example, she was the\r\npleasantest thing of his life to a man who cared mainly to be amused,\r\nand who liked with a woman's liking to be loved.\r\n\r\nThe strong love of children inherent in him, which had never been\r\nsatisfied till now, seemed now to have gathered tenfold strength, and\r\nthe love of the man, who had never cared for his own, for this his\r\nlittle daughter by adoption was almost a passion. If Leam could have\r\nbeen jealous where she did not love, she would have been jealous of\r\nher father and Fina. But she was not. On the contrary, it seemed to\r\nsoften some of the bitterness of her self-reproach, and she was glad\r\nthat madame's motherless child was not deserted, but had found a\r\nsubstitute for the protection which she had taken from her; for Leam,\r\ncriminal, was not ignoble.\r\n\r\nA few days after the meeting on the moor between Learn and Edgar, Mr.\r\nDundas drove to the Hill, carrying Fina with him. Leam had a fit of\r\nshyness and refused to go: thus Sebastian had the child to himself,\r\nand was not sorry to be without his elder and less congenial daughter.\r\nHe owned to himself that she was good, very good indeed, and a great\r\ndeal better than he ever expected she would be; yet for all that, with\r\nher more than Oriental gravity and reserve, and that look of tragedy\r\nhaunting her face, she was not an amusing companion, and the little\r\none was.\r\n\r\nMr. Dundas had begun to take up his old habits again with the\r\nHarrowbys. He found the patient constancy of his friend Josephine not\r\na disagreeable salve for a wounded heart and broken life; albeit poor\r\ndear Joseph was getting stout and matronly, and took off the keen edge\r\nof courtship by a willingness too manifest for wisdom. Sebastian liked\r\nto be loved, but he did not like to be bored by being made overmuch\r\nlove to. The things are different, and most men resent the latter, how\r\nmuch soever they desire the former.\r\n\r\nEdgar was in the drawing-room when Mr. Dundas was announced. He was\r\nbooted and spurred, waiting his horse to be brought round. \"What a\r\npretty little girl!\" he said after a time. True to his type, he was\r\nfond of children and animals, and children and animals liked him.\r\n\"Come and speak to me,\" he continued, holding out his hand to\r\nFina.--\"Whose child is she?\" vaguely to the company in general.\r\n\r\n\"Mine,\" said Mr. Dundas emphatically--\"my youngest daughter, Fina\r\nDundas.\"\r\n\r\nEdgar knew what he meant. He had often heard the story from his\r\nsisters, and since his return home he had had Adelaide Birkett's\r\ncomments thereon. He looked then with even more interest on the\r\npretty little creature in dark-blue velvet and swansdown, careless,\r\nunconscious, happy, as the child of a mystery and a tragedy in one.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" he said sympathetically. \"Come to me, little one,\" again,\r\ncoaxingly.\r\n\r\nFina, with her finger in her mouth, went up to him half shyly, half\r\nboldly, and wholly prettily. She let him take her on his knee and kiss\r\nher without remonstrance. She was of the kind to like being taken on\r\nknees and kissed--especially by gentlemen who were strong and matronly\r\nwomen who were soft--and she soon made friends. Not many minutes\r\nelapsed before, kneeling upon his knees, she was stroking his tawny\r\nbeard and plaiting it in threes, pulling his long moustache, playing\r\nwith his watch-guard, and laughing in his face with the pretty\r\naudacity of six.\r\n\r\n\"What a dear little puss!\" cried Edgar, caressing her. \"Very like\r\nyou, Joseph, I should think, when you were her age, judging by your\r\npicture. Is she not, mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"They say so, but I do not see it,\" answered Mrs. Harrowby primly.\r\n\r\nShe did not like to hear about this resemblance. There was something\r\nin it that annoyed her intensely, she scarcely knew why, and the more\r\nso because it was true.\r\n\r\n\"Poor madame used to say so: she saw it from the first, when Fina was\r\nquite a little baby,\" said Josephine in a low voice.\r\n\r\nShe was kneeling by her brother's side caressing Fina. She always made\r\nlove to the little girl: it was one of her methods of making love to\r\nthe father.\r\n\r\n\"Is she like her mother?\" asked Edgar in the same low tones, looking\r\nat the child critically.\r\n\r\n\"A little,\" answered Josephine--\"not much. It is odd, is it not, that\r\nshe should be more like me?\"\r\n\r\nJust then Fina laid her fresh sweet lips against Edgar's, and he\r\nkissed her with a strange thrill of tenderness.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Edgar, I never saw you take so to a child before,\" cried Mrs.\r\nHarrowby, not quite pleasantly; and on Sebastian adding with his\r\nnervous little laugh, which meant the thing it assumed only to play\r\nat, \"I declare I shall be quite jealous, Edgar, if you make love to\r\nmy little girl like this.\" Edgar, who had the Englishman's dislike\r\nto observation, save when he offered himself for personal admiration,\r\nlaughed too and put Fina away.\r\n\r\nBut the child had taken a fancy to him, and could scarcely be induced\r\nto leave him. She clung to his hand still, and went reluctantly when\r\nher stepfather called her. It was a very little matter, but men being\r\nweak in certain directions, it delighted Edgar and annoyed Sebastian\r\nbeyond measure.\r\n\r\n\"I hope your elder daughter is well,\" then said Edgar, emphasizing the\r\nadjective, the vision of Leam as he first saw her, breasting the wind,\r\nfilling his eyes with a strange light.\r\n\r\n\"Leam? Quite well, thanks. But how do you know anything about her?\"\r\nwas Sebastian's reply.\r\n\r\n\"I met her yesterday on the moor, and Rover introduced us,\" answered\r\nEdgar laughing.\r\n\r\n\"How close she is!\" said her father fretfully. \"She never told me a\r\nword about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps she thought the incident too trifling,\" suggested Edgar, a\r\nlittle chagrined.\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, not at all! In a place like North Aston the least thing counts\r\nas an adventure; and meeting for the first time one of the neighbors\r\nis not an incident to be forgotten as if it were of no more value than\r\nmeeting a flock of sheep.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dundas spoke peevishly. To a man who liked to be amused and who\r\nlived on crumbs this reserved companionship was disappointing and\r\ntiresome.\r\n\r\n\"Leam is at home making music,\" said Fina disdainfully. She had caught\r\nthe displeased accent of her adopted father, and echoed it.\r\n\r\n\"Does she make much music?\" asked Edgar with his hand under her chin,\r\nturning up her face.\r\n\r\nThe child shrugged her little shoulders. \"She makes a noise,\" she\r\nsaid; and those who heard her laughed.\r\n\r\n\"That is not a very polite way of putting it,\" said Edgar a little\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Josephine.\r\n\r\n\"You should speak nicely of your sister, my little one,\" put in\r\nSebastian.\r\n\r\nFina looked up into his face reproachfully. \"You called it a noise\r\nyourself, papa,\" she said, pouting. \"You made her leave off yesterday\r\nas soon as you came in, because you said she made your head ache with\r\nher noise, and set your teeth--something, I don't know what.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did I, dear?\" he repeated carelessly. \"Well, we need not discuss the\r\nsubject. I dare say it amuses her to make music, as you call it, and\r\nso we need say no more about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you did say it was a noise,\" persisted Fina, climbing on to his\r\nknees and putting her arms round his neck. \"And I think it a noise\r\ntoo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor Leam's music cannot be very first-rate,\" remarked Maria, who\r\nwas a proficient and played almost as well as a \"professional.\" \"Four\r\nyears ago she did not know her notes, and four years' practice cannot\r\nbe expected to make a perfect pianiste.\"\r\n\r\n\"But a person may play very sweetly and yet not be what you call\r\nperfect,\" said Edgar.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think so?\" Maria answered with a frosty smile. \"I do not.\" Of\r\nwhat use to have toiled for thirty years early and late at scales\r\nand thorough-bass if a stupid girl like Leam could be allowed to play\r\nsweetly after four years' desultory practice? \"Adelaide Birkett, if\r\nyou will, plays well,\" she added; \"but Leam, poor child! how should\r\nshe?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope I shall have an opportunity of judging for myself,\" said\r\nEdgar with his company manner.--\"When will you come and dine here,\r\nDundas?--to-morrow? You and your elder daughter: we shall be very glad\r\nto see you.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked to his mother. Mrs. Harrowby had drawn her lips tight, and\r\nwore an injured air doing its best to be resigned. This was\r\nEdgar's first essay in domestic mastership, and it pained her, not\r\nunnaturally.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Sebastian. \"Willingly, if--\" looking to Mrs. Harrowby.\r\n\r\n\"I have no engagement, and Edgar is master now,\" said that lady.\r\n\r\n\"And mind that Leam comes too,\" said Josephine, sharing her favorite\r\nbrother's action by design.\r\n\r\n\"And me,\" cried Fina.\r\n\r\nWhereat they all laughed, which made Fina cry, to be consoled only by\r\nsome sweetmeats which Josephine found in her work-basket.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed, then, that the next day Leam and her father should dine\r\nat the Hill.\r\n\r\n\"Only ourselves,\" Edgar said, wanting the excuse of her \"being the\r\nonly lady\" to devote himself to Leam. It was strange that he should\r\nbe so anxious to see her nearer, and in company with his sisters and\r\nmother; for after all, why should he? What was she to him, either near\r\nor afar off, alone or in the inner circle of his family?\r\n\r\nBut when the next day came Mr. Dundas appeared alone. Leam had been\r\ntaken with a fit of shyness, pride--who shall say?--and refused to\r\naccept her share of the invitation. Her father made the stereotyped\r\nexcuse of \"headache;\" but headaches occur too opportunely to be\r\nalways real, and Leam's to-night was set down to the fancy side of\r\nthe account, and not believed in by the hearers any more than by the\r\nbearer.\r\n\r\nEdgar raged against her in his heart, and decided that she was not\r\nworth a second thought, while the ladies said in an undertone from\r\neach to each, \"How rude!\" Maria adding, \"How like Leam!\" the chain\r\nof condemnation receiving no break till it came to Josephine, whose\r\npatient soul refrained from wrath, and gave as her link, \"Poor Leam!\r\nperhaps she is shy or has really a headache.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of his decision that she was not worth a second thought,\r\nthe impression which Leam had made on Edgar deepened with his\r\ndisappointment, and he became restless and unpleasant in his temper,\r\ncasting about for means whereby he might see her again. He cast\r\nabout in vain. This fit of shyness, pride, reluctance--who knows\r\nwhat?--continued with Leam for many days after this. If she went out\r\nat all, she went where she knew she should not be met; and if Edgar\r\ncalled at Ford House, she was not to be found. She mainly devoted\r\nherself to Fina and some books lent her by Alick, and kept the house\r\nwith strange persistency. Perhaps this was because the weather was\r\nbad, for Leam, who could bear wind and frost and noonday sun, could\r\nnot bear wet. When it rained she shut herself up in her own room, and\r\npitied herself for the ungenial skies as she had pitied herself for\r\nsome other things before now.\r\n\r\nSitting thus reading one miserably dark, cold, misty day, the child\r\nFina came in to her with her lessons, which she repeated well. They\r\nwere very small and insignificant little lessons, for Leam had a\r\nfellow-feeling for the troubles of ignorance, and laid but a light\r\nhand on the frothy mind inside that curly head. When they were\r\nfinished the little one said coaxingly, \"Now play with me, Leam! You\r\nnever play with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can I do, Fina?\" poor Leam replied.\r\n\r\nShe had never learnt to play when she was a child: she had never built\r\ntowers and towns, made railway trains and coaches with the sofa and\r\nchairs, played at giants through the dark passages and screamed when\r\nshe was caught. She had only sat still when mamma was asleep, or when\r\nshe was awake played on the zambomba, or listened to her when she told\r\nher of the things of Spain, and made up stories with her dolls that\r\nwere less edifying than those of Mother Bunch. She could scarcely,\r\nhowever, unpack that old box full of waxen puppets, with the one\r\ndressed in scarlet and black, with fishbone horns and a worsted tail,\r\nand a queer clumped kind of foot made of folds of leather, cleft in\r\nthe middle, that used to go by the name of \"El señor papa.\" What could\r\nshe do?\r\n\r\n\"Shall I tell you a story?\" she then said in a mild fit of\r\ndesperation, for story-telling was as little in her way as anything\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, tell me a story!\" Fina clapped her chubby hands together\r\nand climbed up into Leam's lap.\r\n\r\n\"What shall it be about--bears or tigers, or what?\" asked Leam\r\ndutifully.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me about mamma, my own mamma, not Aunty Birkett,\" said Fina.\r\n\r\nLeam shuddered from head to foot. This was the first time the little\r\ngirl had mentioned her mother's name to her. Indeed, she did not know\r\nthat she had ever heard of her at all--ever known that she had had\r\na mother; but the servants had talked, and the child's curiosity was\r\naroused. The dead mother is as much a matter of wondering inquiry\r\nas the angels and the stars; and Fina's imagination was beginning to\r\nbestir itself on the mysteries of childish life.\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing to tell you about her,\" said Leam, controlling\r\nherself, though she still shivered.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you have--everything,\" insisted Fina. \"Was mamma pretty?\"\r\nplaying with a corner of her sister's ribbon.\r\n\r\n\"People said so,\" answered Leam.\r\n\r\n\"As pretty as Cousin Addy?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"About,\" said Leam, who thought neither supreme.\r\n\r\n\"Prettier than you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know: how can I tell?\" she answered a little impatiently.\r\n\r\nThe mother's blood that ran in her, the mother's mould in which she\r\nhad been formed, forbade her to put herself below madame in anything;\r\nbut, as she was neither vain nor conscious, she found Fina's question\r\ndifficult to answer.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" cried Fina, in a tone of disappointment, \"then she could not\r\nhave been very pretty.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say she was, but I do not know,\" returned Leam.\r\n\r\n\"And she died?\" continued Fina, yawning in a childishly indifferent\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, she died.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? Who killed her? Did papa?\" asked Fina.\r\n\r\nLeam's face was very white: \"No, not papa.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did God?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell you, Fina,\" said Leam, to whom falsehoods were\r\nabhorrent and the truth impossible.\r\n\r\n\"Did you?\" persisted Fina with childish obstinacy.\r\n\r\n\"Now go,\" said Leam, putting her off her lap and rising from her chair\r\nin strange disorder. \"You are troublesome and ask too many questions.\"\r\n\r\nFina began to cry loudly, and Mr. Dundas, from his library below,\r\nheard her. He came up stairs with his fussy, restless kindness, and\r\nopened the door of the room where his two daughters, of nature and by\r\nadoption, were.\r\n\r\n\"Heyday! what's all this about?\" he cried. \"What's the matter, my\r\nlittle Fina? what are you crying for? Tut, tut! you should not cry\r\nlike this, darling; and, Leam,\" severely, \"you should really keep the\r\nchild better amused and happy. She is as good as gold with me: with\r\nyou there is always something wrong.\"\r\n\r\nFina ran into his arms sobbing. \"Leam is cross,\" she said. \"She will\r\nnot tell me who killed mamma.\"\r\n\r\nThe man's ruddy face, reddened and roughened with travel, grew white\r\nand pitiful. \"God took her away, my darling,\" he said with a sob.\r\n\"She was too good for me, and He took her to live with the angels in\r\nheaven,\"\r\n\r\n\"And Leam's mamma? Is she in heaven too with the angels?\" asked Fina,\r\nopening her eyes wide through their tears,\r\n\r\n\"I hope so,\" Sebastian answered in an altered voice.\r\n\r\nLeam covered her face in her hands; then lifting it up, she said\r\nimploringly, \"Papa, do not talk to her of mamma. It is sacrilege.\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree with you, Leam,\" said Mr, Dundas in a steady voice. \"We meet\r\nat the same point, but perhaps by different methods.\"\r\n\r\n[TO BE CONTINUED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTERS FROM SOUTH AFRICA\r\n\r\nBY LADY BARKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CAPE TOWN, October 16, 1875.\r\n\r\n    Safe, safe at last, after twenty-four days of nothing but sea\r\n    and sky, of white-crested waves--which made no secret of their\r\n    intention of coming on board whenever they could or of tossing\r\n    the good ship Edinburgh Castle hither and thither like a\r\n    child's plaything--and of more deceitful sluggish rolling\r\n    billows, looking tolerably calm to the unseafaring eye, but\r\n    containing a vast amount of heaving power beneath their slow,\r\n    undulating water-hills and valleys. Sometimes sky and sea\r\n    have been steeped in dazzling haze of golden glare, sometimes\r\n    brightened to blue of a sapphire depth. Again, a sudden change\r\n    of wind has driven up serried clouds from the south and east,\r\n    and all has been gray and cold and restful to eyes wearied\r\n    with radiance and glitter of sun and sparkling water.\r\n\r\n    Never has there been such exceptional weather, although the\r\n    weather of my acquaintance invariably _is_ exceptional. No\r\n    sooner had the outlines of Madeira melted and blended into\r\n    the soft darkness of a summer night than we appeared to sail\r\n    straight into tropic heat and a sluggish vapor, brooding on\r\n    the water like steam from a giant geyser. This simmering,\r\n    oily, exhausting temperature carried us close to the line.\r\n    \"What is before us,\" we asked each other languidly, \"if it be\r\n    hotter than this? How can mortal man, woman, still less child,\r\n    endure existence?\" Vain alarms! Yet another shift of the\r\n    light wind, another degree passed, and we are all shivering in\r\n    winter wraps. The line was crossed in greatcoats and shawls,\r\n    and the only people whose complexion did not resemble a\r\n    purple plum were those lucky ones who had strength of mind\r\n    and steadiness of body to lurch up and down the deck all\r\n    day enjoying a strange method of movement which they called\r\n    walking.\r\n\r\n    The exceptional weather pursued us right into the very\r\n    dock. Table Mountain ought to be seen--and very often is\r\n    seen--seventy miles away. I am told it looks a fine bold bluff\r\n    at that distance, Yesterday we had blown off our last pound of\r\n    steam and were safe under its lee before we could tell\r\n    there was a mountain there at all, still less an almost\r\n    perpendicular cliff more than three thousand feet high. Robben\r\n    Island looked like a dun-colored hillock as we shot past it\r\n    within a short distance, and a more forlorn and discouraging\r\n    islet I don't think I have ever beheld. When I expressed\r\n    something of this impression to a cheery fellow-voyager, he\r\n    could only urge in its defence that there were a great many\r\n    rabbits on it. If he had thrown the lighthouse into the\r\n    bargain, I think he would have summed up all its attractive\r\n    features. Unless Langalibalele is of a singularly\r\n    unimpressionable nature, he must have found his sojourn on\r\n    it somewhat monotonous, but he always says he was very\r\n    comfortable there.\r\n\r\n    And now for the land. We are close alongside of a wharf,\r\n    and still a capital and faithful copy of a Scotch mist wraps\r\n    houses, trees and sloping uplands in a fibry fantastic veil,\r\n    and the cold drizzle seems to curdle the spirits and energies\r\n    of the few listless Malays and half-caste boys and men who are\r\n    lounging about. Here come hansom cabs rattling up one after\r\n    the other, all with black drivers in gay and fantastic head\r\n    and shoulder gear; but their hearts seem precisely as\r\n    the hearts of their London brethren, and they single out\r\n    new-comers at a glance, and shout offers to drive them a\r\n    hundred yards or so for exorbitant sums, or yell laudatory\r\n    recommendations of sundry hotels. You must bear in mind that\r\n    in a colony every pot-house is a hotel, and generally rejoices\r\n    in a name much too imposing to fit across its frontage. These\r\n    hansoms are all painted white with the name of some ship in\r\n    bright letters on the side, and are a great deal cleaner,\r\n    roomier and more comfortable than their London \"forbears.\" The\r\n    horses are small and shabby, but rattle along at a good pace;\r\n    and soon each cab has its load of happy home-comers and swings\r\n    rapidly away to make room for fresh arrivals hurrying up for\r\n    fares. Hospitable suggestions come pouring in, and it is as\r\n    though it were altogether a new experience when one steps\r\n    cautiously on the land, half expecting it to dip away\r\n    playfully from under one's feet. A little boy puts my thoughts\r\n    into words when he exclaims, \"How steady the ground is!\"\r\n    and becomes a still more faithful interpreter of a wave-worn\r\n    voyager's sensations when, a couple of hours later, he demands\r\n    permission to get _out_ of his delicious little white bed\r\n    that he may have the pleasure of getting _into_ it again. The\r\n    evening is cold and raw and the new picture is all blurred and\r\n    soft and indistinct, and nothing seems plain except the\r\n    kindly grace of our welcome and the\r\n    never-before-sufficiently-appreciated delights of space and\r\n    silence.\r\n\r\n    OCTOBER 17.\r\n\r\n    How pleasant is the process familiarly known as \"looking\r\n    about one,\" particularly when performed under exceptionally\r\n    favorable circumstances! A long and happy day commenced with a\r\n    stroll through the botanic gardens, parallel with which runs,\r\n    on one side, a splendid oak avenue just now in all the\r\n    vivid freshness of its young spring leaves. The gardens are\r\n    beautifully kept, and are valuable as affording a sort of\r\n    experimental nursery in which new plants and trees can be\r\n    brought up on trial and their adaptability to the soil and\r\n    climate ascertained. For instance, the first thing that caught\r\n    my eye was the gigantic trunk of an Australian blue-gum tree,\r\n    which had attained to a girth and height not often seen in its\r\n    own land. The flora of the Cape Colony is exceptionally varied\r\n    and beautiful, but one peculiarity incidentally alluded to by\r\n    my charming guide struck me as very noticeable. It is that\r\n    in this dry climate and porous soil all the efforts of\r\n    uncultivated nature are devoted to the _stems_ of the\r\n    vegetation: on their sap-retaining power depends the life of\r\n    the plant, so blossom and leaf, though exquisitely indicated,\r\n    are fragile and incomplete compared to the solidity and\r\n    bulbous appearance of the stalk. Everything is sacrificed to\r\n    the practical principle of keeping life together, and it is\r\n    not until these stout-stemmed plants are cultivated and\r\n    duly sheltered and watered, and can grow, as it were, with\r\n    confidence, that they are able to do justice to the inherent\r\n    beauty of penciled petal and veined leaf. Then the stem\r\n    contracts to ordinary dimensions, and leaf and blossom expand\r\n    into things which may well be a joy to the botanist's eye.\r\n    A thousand times during that shady saunter did I envy my\r\n    companions their scientific acquaintance with the beautiful\r\n    green things of earth, and that intimate knowledge of a\r\n    subject which enhances one's appreciation of its charms as\r\n    much as bringing a lamp into a darkened picture-gallery. There\r\n    are the treasures of form and color, but from ignorant eyes\r\n    more than half their charms and wonders are held back.\r\n\r\n    A few steps beyond the garden stand the library and natural\r\n    history museum. The former is truly a credit to the Colony.\r\n    Spacious, handsome, rich in literary treasures, It would\r\n    bear comparison with similar institutions in far older and\r\n    wealthier places. But I have often noticed in colonies how\r\n    much importance is attached to the possession of a good public\r\n    library, and how fond, as a rule, colonists are of books. In\r\n    a new settlement other shops may be ill supplied, but there\r\n    is always a good bookseller's, and all books are to be bought\r\n    there at pretty nearly the same prices as in England. Here\r\n    each volume costs precisely the same as it would in London,\r\n    and it would puzzle ever so greedy a reader to name a book\r\n    which would not be instantly handed to him.\r\n\r\n    The museum is well worth a visit of many more hours than we\r\n    could afford minutes, and, as might be expected, contains\r\n    numerous specimens of the _Bok_ family, whose tapering horns\r\n    and slender legs are to be seen at every turn of one's head.\r\n    Models are there also of the largest diamonds, and especially\r\n    well copied is the famous \"Star of South Africa,\" a\r\n    magnificent brilliant of purest water, sold here originally\r\n    for something like twelve thousand pounds, and resold for\r\n    double that sum three or four years back. In these few hours I\r\n    perceive, or think I perceive, a certain soreness, if one\r\n    may use the word, on the part of the Cape Colonists about the\r\n    unappreciativeness of the English public toward their produce\r\n    and possessions. For Instance, an enormous quantity of wine is\r\n    annually exported, which reaches London by a devious route and\r\n    fetches a high price, as it is fairly entitled to do from its\r\n    excellence. If that same wine were sent direct to a London\r\n    merchant and boldly sold as Cape wine, it is said that the\r\n    profit on it would be a very different affair. The same\r\n    prejudice exists against Cape diamonds. Of course, as in other\r\n    things, a large proportion of inferior stones are forced into\r\n    the market and serve to give the diamonds that bad name which\r\n    we all know is so fatal to a dog. But it is only necessary to\r\n    pretend that a really fine Cape diamond has come from Brazil\r\n    to ensure its fetching a handsome price, and in that way even\r\n    jewelers themselves have been known to buy and give a good\r\n    round sum, too, for stones they would otherwise have looked\r\n    upon with suspicion. Already I have seen a straw-colored\r\n    diamond from \"Du Zoit's pan\" in the diamond-fields cut in\r\n    Amsterdam and set in London, which could hold its own for\r\n    purity, radiance and color against any other stone of the same\r\n    rare tint, without fear or favor; but of course such gems are\r\n    not common, and fairly good diamonds cost as much here as in\r\n    any other part of the world.\r\n\r\n    The light morning mists from that dampness of yesterday have\r\n    rolled gradually away as the beautiful sunshine dried the\r\n    atmosphere, and by midday the table-cloth, as the colonists\r\n    affectionately call the white, fleece-like vapor which so\r\n    often rests on their pet mountain, has been folded up and laid\r\n    aside in Cloudland for future use. I don't know what picture\r\n    other people may have made to their own minds of the shape and\r\n    size of Table Mountain, but it was quite a surprise and the\r\n    least little bit in the world of a disappointment to me to\r\n    find that it cuts the sky (and what a beautiful sky it is!)\r\n    with a perfectly straight and level line. A gentle, undulating\r\n    foreground broken into ravines, where patches of green _velts_\r\n    or fields, clumps of trees and early settlers' houses nestle\r\n    cosily down, guides the eye half-way up the mountain. There\r\n    the rounder forms abruptly cease, and great granite cliffs\r\n    rise, bare and straight, up to the level line stretching ever\r\n    so far along. \"It is so characteristic,\" and \"You grow to be\r\n    so fond of that mountain,\" are observations I have heard made\r\n    in reply to the carping criticisms of travelers, and already\r\n    I begin to understand the meaning of the phrases. But you\r\n    need to see the mountain from various points of view and under\r\n    different influences of sun and cloud before you can take in\r\n    its striking and peculiar charms.\r\n\r\n    On each side of the straight line which is emphatically Table\r\n    Mountain, but actually forming part of it, is a bold headland\r\n    of the shape one is usually accustomed to in mountains. The\r\n    \"Devil's Peak\" is uncompromising enough for any one's taste,\r\n    whilst the \"Lion's Head\" charms the eye by its bluff form\r\n    and deep purple fissures. These grand promontories are not,\r\n    however, half so beloved by Cape Colonists as their own Table\r\n    Mountain, and it is curious and amusing to notice how the\r\n    influence of this odd straight ridge, ever before their eyes,\r\n    has unconsciously guided and influenced their architectural\r\n    tastes. All the roofs of the houses are straight--straight\r\n    as the mountain; a gable is almost unknown, and even the few\r\n    steeples are dwarfed to an imperceptible departure from the\r\n    prevailing straight line. The very trees which shade the\r\n    Parade-ground and border the road in places have their tops\r\n    blown absolutely straight and flat, as though giant shears\r\n    had trimmed them; but I must confess, in spite of a\r\n    natural anxiety to carry out my theory, that the violent\r\n    \"sou'-easters\" are the \"straighteners\" in their case.\r\n\r\n    Cape Town is so straggling that it is difficult to form any\r\n    idea of its real size, but the low houses are neat and the\r\n    streets are well kept and look quaint and lively enough to my\r\n    new eyes this morning. There are plenty of people moving about\r\n    with a sociable, business-like air; lots of different shades\r\n    of black and brown Malays, with pointed hats on the men's\r\n    heads: the women encircle their dusky, smiling faces with a\r\n    gay cotton handkerchief and throw another of a still brighter\r\n    hue over their shoulders. When you add to this that they\r\n    wear a full, flowing, stiffly-starched cotton gown of a third\r\n    bright color, you can perhaps form some idea of how they\r\n    enliven the streets. Swarms of children everywhere, romping\r\n    and laughing and showing their white teeth in broadest\r\n    of grins. The white children strike me at once as looking\r\n    marvelously well--such chubby cheeks, such sturdy fat\r\n    legs--and all, black or white, with that amazing air of\r\n    independence peculiar to baby-colonists. Nobody seems to mind\r\n    them and nothing seems to harm them. Here are half a dozen\r\n    tiny boys shouting and laughing at one side of the road, and\r\n    half a dozen baby-girls at the other (they all seem to play\r\n    separately): they are all driving each other, for \"horses\" is\r\n    the one game here. By the side of a pond sit two toddles of\r\n    about three years old, in one garment apiece and pointed hats:\r\n    they are very busy with string and a pin; but who is taking\r\n    care of them and why don't they tumble in? They are as fat as\r\n    ortolans and grin at us in the most friendly fashion.\r\n\r\n    We must remember that this chances to be the very best moment\r\n    of the whole year in which to see the Cape and the dwellers\r\n    thereat. The cold weather has left its bright roses on the\r\n    children's cheeks, and the winter rains exceptionally having\r\n    this year made every blade of grass and leaf of tree to laugh\r\n    and sing in freshest green. After the dry, windy summer I am\r\n    assured there is hardly a leaf and never a blade of grass to\r\n    be seen in Cape Town, and only a little straggling verdure\r\n    under the shelter of the mountain. The great want of this\r\n    place is water. No river, scarcely a brook, refreshes one's\r\n    eye for many and many a league inward. The necessary water for\r\n    the use of the town is brought down by pipes from the numerous\r\n    springs which trickle out of the granite cliffs of Table\r\n    Mountain, but there is never a sufficiency to spare for\r\n    watering roads or grassplots. This scarcity is a double loss\r\n    to residents and visitors, for one misses it both for use and\r\n    beauty.\r\n\r\n    Everybody who comes here rides or drives round the \"Kloof.\"\r\n    That may be; but what I maintain is that very few do it so\r\n    delightfully as I did this sunny afternoon with a companion\r\n    who knew and loved every turn of the romantic road, who could\r\n    tell me the name of every bush or flower, of every distant\r\n    stretch of hills, and helped me to make a map in my head of\r\n    the stretching landscape and curving bay. Ah! how delicious it\r\n    was, the winding, climbing road, at whose every angle a fresh\r\n    fair landscape fell away from beneath our feet or a shining\r\n    stretch of sea, whose transparent green and purple shadows\r\n    broke in a fringe of feathery spray at the foot of bold, rocky\r\n    cliffs, or crept up to a smooth expanse of silver sand in a\r\n    soft curling line of foam! \"Kloof\" means simply cleft, and is\r\n    the pass between the Table Mountain and the Lion's Head, The\r\n    road first rises, rises, rises, until one seems half-way up\r\n    the great mountain, and the little straight--roofed white\r\n    houses, the green velts or fields and the parallel lines of\r\n    the vineyards have sunk below one's feet far, far away. The\r\n    mountain gains in grandeur as one approaches it, for the\r\n    undulating spurs which run from it down to the sea-shore take\r\n    away from the height looking upward. But when these are left\r\n    beneath, the perpendicular Walls of granite, rising sheer\r\n    and straight up to the bold sky-line, and the rugged, massive\r\n    strength of the buttress-like cliffs, begin to gain something\r\n    of their true value to the stranger's eye. The most beautiful\r\n    part of the road, however, to my taste, is the descent, when\r\n    the shining expanse of Camp's Bay lies shimmering in the warm\r\n    afternoon haze with a thousand lights and shadows from cloud\r\n    and cliff touching and passing over the crisp water-surface.\r\n    By many a steep zigzag we round the Lion's Head, and drop once\r\n    more on a level road running parallel to the sea-shore, and so\r\n    home in the balmy and yet bracing twilight. The midday sun is\r\n    hot and scorching even at this time of year, but it is always\r\n    cool in the shade, and no sooner do the afternoon shadows grow\r\n    to any length than the air freshens into sharpness, and by\r\n    sundown one is glad of a good warm shawl.\r\n\r\n\r\n    OCTOBER 18.\r\n\r\n    Another bright, ideal day, and the morning passed in a\r\n    delicious flower-filled room looking over old books and\r\n    records and listening to odd, quaint little scraps from the\r\n    old Dutch records. But directly after luncheon (and how hungry\r\n    we all are, and how delicious everything tastes on shore!) the\r\n    open break with four capital horses comes to the door, and we\r\n    start for a long, lovely drive. Half a mile or so takes us\r\n    out on a flat red road with Table Mountain rising straight up\r\n    before it, but on the left stretches away a most enchanting\r\n    panorama. It is all so soft in coloring and tone, distinct and\r\n    yet not hard, and exquisitely beautiful!\r\n\r\n    The Blue-Berg range of mountains stretch beyond the great bay,\r\n    which, unless a \"sou'-easter\" is tearing over it, lies glowing\r\n    in tranquil richness. This afternoon it is colored like an\r\n    Italian lake. Here are lines of chrysoprase, green-fringed,\r\n    white with little waves, and beyond lie dark, translucent,\r\n    purple depths, which change with every passing cloud. Beyond\r\n    these amethystic shoals again stretches the deep blue water,\r\n    and again beyond, and bluer still, rise the five ranges\r\n    of \"Hottentots' Holland,\" which encircle and complete the\r\n    landscape, bringing the eye round again to the nearer cliffs\r\n    of the Devil's Peak. When the Dutch came here some two hundred\r\n    years ago, they seized upon this part of the coast and called\r\n    it Holland, driving the Hottentots beyond the neighboring\r\n    range and telling them that was to be their Holland--a name it\r\n    keeps to this day. Their consciences must have troubled them\r\n    after this arbitrary division of the soil, for up the highest\r\n    accessible spurs of their own mountain they took the\r\n    trouble to build several queer little square houses called\r\n    \"block-houses,\" from which they could keep a sharp look-out\r\n    for foes coming over the hills from Hottentots' Holland.\r\n    The foes never came, however, and the roofs and walls of\r\n    the block-houses have gradually tumbled in, and the\r\n    gun-carriages--for they managed to drag heavy ordnance up the\r\n    steep hill-side--have rotted away, whilst the old-fashioned\r\n    cannon lie, grim and rusty, amid a tangled profusion of wild\r\n    geranium, heath and lilies, I scrambled up to one of the\r\n    nearest block-houses, and found the date on the dismounted gun\r\n    to be more than a hundred years old. The view was beautiful\r\n    and the air fresh and fragrant with scent of flowers.\r\n\r\n    But to return to our drive. I could gaze and gaze for ever at\r\n    this lovely panorama, but am told this is the ugliest part of\r\n    the road. The road itself is certainly not pretty just here,\r\n    and is cloudy with a fine red dust, but this view of sea and\r\n    distant hills is enchanting. Soon we get under the lee of\r\n    the great mountain, and then its sheltering arms show their\r\n    protective power; for splendid oak avenues begin to border the\r\n    road all the way, and miniature forests of straight-stemmed\r\n    pines and shimmering belts of the ghostly silver tree run up\r\n    all the mountain-clefts. Stem and leaf of the silver tree are\r\n    all of purest white; and when one gets a gleam of sunlight\r\n    on a distant patch of these trees, the effect is quite\r\n    indescribable, contrasting, as they do, with green of field\r\n    and vineyard. The vines all about here and towards Constantia,\r\n    thirteen miles off, are dwarf-plants, and only grow to the\r\n    height of gooseberry-bushes. It is a particular species, which\r\n    is found to answer best as requiring less labor to train and\r\n    cultivate, and is less likely to be blown out of the ground\r\n    by the violent \"sou'-easters\" which come sweeping over the\r\n    mountain. These gales are evidently the greatest annoyance\r\n    which Cape Colonists have to endure; and although everybody\r\n    kindly suggests that I _ought_ to see one, just to understand\r\n    what it is like, I am profoundly thankful that I only know it\r\n    from their description and my own distinct recollection of the\r\n    New Zealand \"nor'-westers.\" Those were hot winds, scorching\r\n    and curling up everything, whereas this is rather a cold\r\n    breeze, although it blows chiefly in summer. It whirls along\r\n    clouds of dust from the red clay roads and fields which\r\n    penetrates and clings to everything in the most extraordinary\r\n    manner. All along the road the stems and lower branches of the\r\n    trees are dyed a deep brick-dust color, and I hear moving and\r\n    pathetic stories of how it ruins clothes, not only utterly\r\n    spoiling black silk dresses, but staining white petticoats and\r\n    children's frocks and pinafores with a border of color exactly\r\n    like the ruddle with which sheep are branded. Especially is\r\n    it the terror of sailors, rendering the navigation along the\r\n    coast dangerous and difficult; for it blends land and water\r\n    into one indistinct whirl of vaporous cloud, confusing and\r\n    blurring everything until one cannot distinguish shore from\r\n    sea.\r\n\r\n    The vineyards of Constantia originally took their pretty name\r\n    from the fair daughter of one of the early Dutch governors,\r\n    but now it has grown into a generic word, and you see\r\n    \"Cloete's Constantia,\" \"Von Reybeck Constantia,\" written upon\r\n    great stone gateways leading by long avenues into the various\r\n    vine-growing plantations. It was to the former of these\r\n    constantias, which was also the farthest off, that we were\r\n    bound that pleasant summer afternoon, and from the time we got\r\n    out of the carriage until the moment we re-entered it--all\r\n    too soon, but it is a long drive back in the short cold\r\n    twilight--I felt as though I had stepped through a magic\r\n    portal into the scene of one of Washington Irving's\r\n    stories. It was all so simple and homely, so quaint and so\r\n    inexpressibly picturesque. The house had stood there for a\r\n    couple of hundred years, and looks as though it might last for\r\n    ever, with its air of cool, leisurely repose and comfort and\r\n    strength.\r\n\r\n    In the flagged hall stands a huge stalactite some ten feet\r\n    high, brought a hundred years ago from caves far away in the\r\n    distant ranges. It is shaped something like a Malay's hat,\r\n    only the peak tapers to a point about eight feet high. The\r\n    drawing-room--though it seems a profanation to call that\r\n    venerable stately room by so flippant and modern a name--is\r\n    large, ceiled with great beams of cedar, and lighted by lofty\r\n    windows, which must contain many scores of small panes of\r\n    glass. There were treasures of rarest old china and delfware,\r\n    and curious old carved stands for fragile dishes. A wealth of\r\n    swinging-baskets of flowers and ferns and bright girl-faces\r\n    lighted up the solemn, shady old room, in which we must not\r\n    linger, for there is much to see outside. First to the cellar,\r\n    as it is called, though it is far from being under ground,\r\n    and is, in fact, a spacious stone building with an\r\n    elaborately-carved pediment. Here are rows and rows of giant\r\n    casks, stretching on either hand into avenues in the black\r\n    distance, but these are mere children in the nursery, compared\r\n    to those we are going to see. First we must pause in a middle\r\n    room full of quaintest odds and ends--crossbows, long whips of\r\n    hippopotamus hide, strange rusty old swords and firearms--to\r\n    look at a map of South Africa drawn somewhere about 1640. It\r\n    hangs on the wall and is hardly to be touched, for the paint\r\n    and varnish crack and peel off at a breath. It is a marvel of\r\n    accurate geographical knowledge, and is far better filled\r\n    in than the maps of yesterday. All poor Livingstone's great\r\n    geographical discoveries are marked on it as being--perhaps\r\n    only from description--known or guessed at all that long time\r\n    ago. It was found impossible to photograph it on account of\r\n    the dark shade which age has laid over the original yellow\r\n    varnish, but a careful tracing has been made and, I believe,\r\n    sent home to the Geographical Society. It is in the long\r\n    corridor beyond this that the \"stuck-vats\" live--puncheons\r\n    which hold easily some thousand gallons or so, and are of a\r\n    solemn rotundity calculated to strike awe into the beholder's\r\n    heart. Here is white constantia, red constantia, young\r\n    constantia, middle-aged constantia, and constantia so old as\r\n    to be a liqueur almost beyond price. When it has been kept\r\n    all these years, the sweetness by which it is distinguished\r\n    becomes so absorbed and blended as to be hardly perceptible.\r\n\r\n    Presently one of the party throws a door suddenly open, and,\r\n    behold, we are standing right over a wild wooded glen with a\r\n    streamlet running through it, and black washerwomen beating\r\n    heaps of white clothes on the strips of shingle. Turtle-doves\r\n    are cooing, and one might almost fancy one was back again on\r\n    the wild Scotch west coast, until some one else says calmly,\r\n    \"Look at the ostriches!\" Here they come, with a sort of\r\n    dancing step, twisting their long necks and snake-like heads\r\n    from side to side in search of a tempting pebble or trifle of\r\n    hardware. Their wings are slightly raised, and the long fringe\r\n    of white feathers rustles softly as they trot easily and\r\n    gracefully past us. They are young male birds, and in a few\r\n    months more their plumage, which now resembles that of a\r\n    turkey-cock, will be jet black, except the wing-feathers. A\r\n    few drops of rain are falling, so we hurry back to where the\r\n    carriage is standing under some splendid oak trees, swallow a\r\n    sort of stirrup-cup of delicious hot tea, and so home again as\r\n    fast as we can go.\r\n\r\n\r\n    OCTOBER 19.\r\n\r\n    It is decided that I must take a drive in a Cape cart; so\r\n    directly after breakfast a smart workman-like-looking vehicle,\r\n    drawn by a pair of well-bred iron-gray cobs, dashes up under\r\n    the portico. There are capital horses here, but they fetch\r\n    a good price, and such a pair as these would easily find\r\n    purchasers at one hundred and fifty pounds. The cart itself\r\n    is very trim and smart, with a framework sort of head, which\r\n    falls back at pleasure, and it holds four people easily. It\r\n    is a capital vehicle, light and strong and uncommonly\r\n    comfortable, but I am warned not to imagine that all Cape\r\n    carts are as easy as this one. Away we go at a fine pace\r\n    through the delicious sparkling morning sunshine and crisp\r\n    air, soon turning off the red high-road into a sandy, marshy\r\n    flat with a sort of brackish back-water standing in pools here\r\n    and there. We are going to call on Langalibalele, and his\r\n    son, Malambuli, who are located at Uitvlugt on the Cape\r\n    downs, about four miles from the town. It is a sort of\r\n    farm-residence; and considering that the chief has hitherto\r\n    lived in a reed hut, he is not badly off, for he has plenty\r\n    of room out of doors as well as a good house over his head. We\r\n    bump over some strange and rough bits of sandy road and climb\r\n    up and down steep banks in a manner seldom done on wheels.\r\n    There is a wealth of lovely flowers blooming around, but I\r\n    can't help fixing my eyes on the pole of the cart, which is\r\n    sometimes sticking straight up in the air, its silver hook\r\n    shining merrily in the sun, or else it has disappeared\r\n    altogether, and I can only see the horses' haunches. That\r\n    is when we are going _down_ hill, and I think it is a more\r\n    terrible sensation than when we are playfully scrambling up\r\n    some sandy hillock as a cat might.\r\n\r\n    Here is the location at last, thank Heaven! and there is\r\n    Langalibalele sitting in the verandah stoep (pronounced\r\n    \"stoup\") on his haunches on a brick. He looks as comfortable\r\n    as if he were in an arm-chair, but it must be a difficult\r\n    thing to do if you think seriously of it. The etiquette seems\r\n    to be to take no notice of him as we pass into the parlor,\r\n    where we present our pass and the people in authority satisfy\r\n    themselves that we are quite in rule. Then the old chief walks\r\n    quietly in, takes off his soft felt hat and sits himself\r\n    down in a Windsor arm-chair with grave deliberation. He is\r\n    uncommonly ugly; but when one remembers that he is nearly\r\n    seventy years of age, it is astonishing to see how young\r\n    he looks. Langalibalele is not a true Kafir at all: he is a\r\n    Fingor, a half-caste tribe contemptuously christened by the\r\n    Kafirs \"dogs.\" His wool grows in distinct and separate clumps\r\n    like hassocks of grass all over his head. He is a large and\r\n    powerful man and looks the picture of sleek contentment, as\r\n    well he may. Only one of his sons, a good-natured, fine\r\n    young man, black as ebony, is with him, and the chief's one\r\n    expressed grievance is that none of his wives will come to\r\n    him. In vain he sends commands and entreaties to these dusky\r\n    ladies to come and share his solitude. They return for answer\r\n    that \"they are working for somebody else;\" for, alas! the only\r\n    reason their presence is desired is that they may cultivate\r\n    some of the large extent of ground placed at the old chief's\r\n    disposal. Neither he nor his stalwart son would dream for\r\n    a moment of touching spade or hoe; but if the ladies of the\r\n    family could only be made to see their duty, an honest penny\r\n    might easily be turned by oats or rye. I gave him a large\r\n    packet of sugar-plums, which he seized with childish delight\r\n    and hid away exactly like the big monkeys at the Zoo.\r\n\r\n    By way of a joke, Malambuli pretended to want to take them\r\n    away, and the chattering and laughing which followed was\r\n    almost deafening. But by and by a gentleman of the party\r\n    presented a big parcel of the best tobacco, and the chuckling\r\n    old chief made over at once all my sweetmeats \"jintly\" to\r\n    his son, and proceeded to hide away his new treasure. He\r\n    was dressed exactly like a dissenting minister, and declared\r\n    through the interpreter he was perfectly comfortable. The\r\n    impression here seems to be that he is a restless, intriguing\r\n    and mischief-making old man, who may consider himself as\r\n    having come out of the hornets' nest he tried to stir up\r\n    uncommonly well.\r\n\r\n    We don't want to bump up and down the sandy plain again, so\r\n    a lively conversation goes on in Dutch about the road between\r\n    one of my gentlemen and somebody who looks like a \"stuck-vat\"\r\n    upon short legs. The dialogue is fluent and lively, beginning\r\n    with \"Ja, ja!\" and ending with \"All right!\" but it leads to\r\n    our hitting off the right track exactly, and coming out at a\r\n    lovely little cottage-villa under the mountain, where we rest\r\n    and lunch and then stroll about up the hill spurs, through\r\n    myrtle hedges and shady oak avenues. Then, before the\r\n    afternoon shadows grow too long, we drive off to \"Groote\r\n    Schuur,\" the ancient granary of the first settlers, which is\r\n    now turned into a roomy, comfortable country-house, perfect\r\n    as a summer residence, and securely sheltered from the\r\n    \"sou'-easters.\" We approach it through a double avenue of tall\r\n    Italian pines, and after a little while go out once more for\r\n    a ramble up some quaint old brick steps, and so through a\r\n    beautiful glen all fringed and feathered with fresh young\r\n    fronds of maiden-hair ferns, and masses of hydrangea bushes,\r\n    which must be beautiful as a poet's dream when they are\r\n    covered with their great bunches of pale blue blossom. That\r\n    will not be until Christmas-tide, and, alas! I shall not be\r\n    here to see, for already my three halcyon days of grace are\r\n    ended and over, and this very evening we must steam away\r\n    from a great deal yet unvisited of what is interesting\r\n    and picturesque, and from friends who three days ago were\r\n    strangers, but who have made every moment since we landed\r\n    stand out as a bright and pleasant landmark on life's highway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON SANKOTA HEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yay, Jim, there ain't no doubt but Sairy Macy's a mighty nice gal,\r\nbut, thee sees, what I'm a-contendin' fur is that she's tew nice fur\r\nthee--that is, not tew nice egzackly, but a leetle tew fine-feathered.\r\nNo, not that egzackly, nuther; but she's a leetle tew fine in the\r\nfeelin's, an' I don't b'lieve that in the long run thee an' she'll\r\nsort well tugether. Shell git eout o' conceit with thy ways--thee\r\n_ain't_ the pootiest-mannered feller a gal ever see--an' thee'll git\r\neout o' conceit with hern. Thee'll think she's a-gittin' stuck up, an'\r\nshe'll think thee's a-gittin'low-minded. Neow, Jim, my 'dvice is\r\ngood; an' ef thee'll take it, an' not go on with this thing no furder,\r\nthee'll both be glad on it arterwa'ds. 'Spesh'ly 's she ain't very\r\nrugged, an' sickly gals had oughter hev rich husbands.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, father, Sairy an' me loves o' 'nother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, wal, then it's tew late ter say nothin',\" said the old man with\r\na mingled sigh and smile as, raising his basket of quahaugs to his\r\nshoulder, he walked off, pressing his bare feet into the yielding sand\r\nwith the firm but clumsy tread of vigorous old age. The rough hat\r\nof plaited straw was pushed back from a brow that with a cultivated\r\nnature would have been considered as evidence of considerable\r\nintellectual power, but, as it was, only showed the probable truth\r\nof the opinion of his neighbors, that \"Stephen Starbuck was a shrewd,\r\ncommon-sense ole feller.\"\r\n\r\nJim was of a little finer grade than his father, having inherited some\r\nof the traits of his gentle mother, but the young Hercules could by no\r\nmeans have been mistaken for an Apollo; neither did his somewhat heavy\r\nfeatures bear the expression of unselfish loyalty which would have\r\ngiven better promise than any mere refinement of features or manner\r\nfor the future happiness of Sarah Macy. But she found nothing wanting\r\nin her lover as she stood on the cliff-head gazing down upon him.\r\nSarah knew that the man she loved was not considered her equal, but\r\nbecause she loved him she believed him capable of becoming all that\r\nshe or others could desire. There is in the world no faith so absolute\r\nas that of a woman in the possibilities of the man she loves. Had\r\nSarah read of Sir Galahad--but this was in 1779, and the fame of the\r\nsearch for the Holy Grail had not reached the popular ear--she would\r\nhave said to herself, \"My Jim is just so pure and holy.\" Had \"her Jim\"\r\nbeen a Royalist during the English Revolution, Prince Rupert's laurels\r\nwould not have been unshared. Had Jim been a Puritan--though the\r\nlittle Quaker maiden did not love Puritans over well, and did not\r\nfancy her Jim as fighting on that side--England's Protector would\r\nnot have borne the name of Cromwell. Or if Jim were not one of the\r\npeace-loving Friends, and would enlist in the present struggle for\r\nliberty, the fame of Commodore James Starbuck should soon eclipse that\r\nof Paul Jones.\r\n\r\nNot for the world would Sarah have given voice to the heretical\r\ndesire, but in her inmost heart was even now a wish that her dear Jim\r\nheld religious opinions that would not interfere with his showing\r\nto the country how talented, noble and valiant he was; while the\r\nfair-haired, sunburnt, indolent young Hercules idly gazing out to sea\r\nwas fired with no higher ambition for himself than to be able soon\r\nto erect on the Head another small house like that of his father, to\r\nwhich he might bring \"the sweet little girl who loved him, so much.\"\r\nFor Sarah had committed the common mistake of loving women, and had\r\nlet Jim see how dear he was to her. So now, instead of dwelling on his\r\nlove for her and scheming how he might be worthy of her heart, he was\r\nfully satisfied with himself, and inclined to grumble at Fortune for\r\nnot at once bestowing the trifle he asked at her hands.\r\n\r\n\"Jim, how long's thee goin' ter stan' there? If the water _is_ pretty,\r\nthee can see it any day, so 't ain't worth while to look at it all day\r\nter a time.\"\r\n\r\nAs, the sweet tones floated down the cliff Jim turned lazily to smile\r\nup at the speaker, and, raising his heavy basket of quahaugs, came\r\nleisurely up the steep sand-path, which seemed to shrink from his\r\nweight at every step: \"Wal', Sairy, I wa'n't a-thinkin' much o' the\r\nwater: I was a-thinkin' o' thee, an' o' what fayther said a little\r\nspell ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was that, Jim?\" Sarah's tone was a little anxious, for she knew\r\nthat there was a jealousy among some of the islanders of the facts\r\nthat her father had brought with him a few heavy articles of \"real\r\nmahogany furnitur,\" and that her stepmother had always been able to\r\nhire others to do her spinning and weaving, and even to \"help her at\r\nodd spells with the heft o' the housework.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nothin',\" replied Jim, passing his free arm carelessly round the\r\ngirl's waist--\"othin', undly th' old story 'beout heow we'd best not\r\nmerry, 'cause by'm-by thee'll git ter feelin' better nor me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But thee don't believe him, Jim? Thee knows better. Thee knows,\"\r\nadding this with the sweet and sincere but often sadly mistaken\r\nhumility of love--\"thee knows thou art better than me. Thou art so\r\ngrand and so noble! If folks only knew thee better they would wonder\r\nat thee fur puttin' up wi' me. I wish I could make thee a better wife.\r\nBut, Jim, if I ain't very strong, I'm pretty good at contrivin', an'\r\nI don't believe but what I can manage so's to git along a'most as well\r\nas them that's tougher.\"\r\n\r\n\"Git along? O' course thee'll git along,\" answered Jim patronizingly.\r\n\"I telled mother th'other day that I didn't cafe ef thee wa'n't 's\r\nstrong as Mary Allen: thee was a good deal smarter, an' I'd be willin'\r\ntu resk but what I'd hev as little waitin' on ter dew fur thee 's fur\r\nher. Besides\"--and here a gleam of real if shallow affection sprang\r\nfrom Jim's eyes as he looked down at the loving creature by his\r\nside--\"besides, I'd _like_ to take care o' thee, Sairy--I would\r\nindeed.\"\r\n\r\nIt is said that the sky has no color of its own--that the deep blue\r\nwe think so beautiful is only owing to the atmosphere through which we\r\nview it. To Sarah this very slight expression of her lover's care\r\nfor her bore more weight than the most passionate protestations of\r\naffection could have done to a colder nature, for it was colored by\r\nthe glowing tints of her own warm love; and when the two parted that\r\nday she carried with her a sweet, satisfying sense of being beloved by\r\nthe \"best man on the earth\" even as she loved him; while he whistled\r\ncheerily over his net-mending, thinking \"what a sweet little thing it\r\nwas!\" \"how pretty its eyes were!\" and \"how kitten-like its ways!\" and\r\nonly checked his whistling once in a while to wonder whether the day\r\nwould ever really come when \"Sairy would feel herself better than\r\nhim,\" and to think it also a little hard that old Thomas Macy was \"so\r\nsot agin' the match\" that he would give his daughter no portion but an\r\noutfit of clothes and household linen. \"He might jest's well's not,\"\r\nreasoned Jim to himself, \"give us a little lift: I guess he would if\r\nSairy's own mother was alive; but them step-mothers never wants to\r\ngive nothin' ter the fust wives' childern.\" In which opinion Jim did\r\nthe second Mrs. Macy much injustice, for it was owing solely to her\r\ninfluence that Sarah's father had consented to provide his daughter\r\nwith even a new dress in which to be married to \"that big, lazy boy\r\no'old Steve Starbuck's.\"\r\n\r\nMeantime, sad, gentle old Mrs. Starbuck had been turning over\r\nmany things in her mind. She felt her son's defects; she knew that\r\nwarm-hearted, imaginative Sarah Macy would be doing a foolish thing to\r\nmarry Jim--as foolish a thing as in her inmost heart she felt, rather\r\nthan acknowledged, that she herself had done when she married Jim's\r\nfather. But the mother-heart longed that her son should grow to be\r\nwhat she desired (and what poor Sarah thought he already was), and she\r\nhoped much from the elevating influence of so good a wife.\r\n\r\nSo, as she sat knitting, while Jim and his father sat, hats on heads\r\nand pipes in mouths, mending their nets, old Mrs. Starbuck had \"made a\r\nplan.\" \"Father,\" said, she at last, \"I've be'n thinkin'--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yay,\" replied the old man gruffly but not unkindly--\"yay, I 'spect\r\nso. Thee's pooty nigh allus a-thinkin' o' suthin. What is it neow?\r\nEout with it!\"\r\n\r\n\"I've be'n thinkin' that Jim's all the child we've got--\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, yay. Hain't had no other--not's I knows on. What o' that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I was a-thinkin' that, that bein' so, an' Jim an' Sairy\r\nthinkin' so much o' 'nother, it wa'n't o' no use fur them ter keep\r\nwaitin' along year eout an' year in fur a chance tu keep house by\r\n'emselves. They'd best git married right off an' come an' live along\r\no' us.\"\r\n\r\n\"W'y, ole woman!\"\r\n\r\n\"W'y, mother!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yay; I hear both on ye,\" said the gentle old mother with a half\r\nsmile. \"I s'posed likely ye'd think strange on't at fust; but ye\r\nh'ain't no need ter, fur it's a sens'ble thing ter dew, an' yell see't\r\nso when ye've thought on't a spell: see if ye don't.\"\r\n\r\nSo well was the proposal liked that very soon the simple ceremony of\r\nthe Friends made James and Sarah husband and wife; and for a while all\r\nseemed happiness in the humble cottage on the cliff--cottage so humble\r\nthat it scarcely deserved even that lowly name.\r\n\r\nSarah Macy's father owned one of the largest dwellings on Nantucket--a\r\ntwo-story \"double house\" with two rooms on each side of a broad hall\r\nrunning through the house from front to rear. On one side of this hall\r\nwas the \"best bedroom,\" ghostly with tightly-closed white shutters\r\nand long white dimity curtains to the \"four-poster\" and shining white\r\nsanded floor, and the \"best-room,\" terrible in its grandeur of cold\r\nwhite walls, straight hard sofa, \"spider-legged\" table, grenadier-like\r\nchairs and striped woolen carpet underlaid with straw. In the rear, on\r\nthe other side of the hall, was the kitchen with its big brick oven,\r\nits yawning fireplace overhung with corpulent iron pots or shining\r\ncopper kettles depending from numerous gallows-like cranes; with its\r\nglittering copper, brass and pewter utensils arrayed on snowy-shelves;\r\nwith its spotless tables, Its freshly-sanded floor and its\r\nheavily-beamed, whitewashed ceiling, from which hung many a bunch of\r\nsavory herbs or string of red pepper-pods or bunch of seed-corn, or\r\nperhaps even a round-backed ham, to get a little browner in the smoke\r\nthat would sometimes pour out from the half-ignited mass of peat. In\r\nfront of the kitchen was the \"living-room,\" in one corner of which\r\nstood a carved high-post bedstead--glory of the Macys and envy of\r\ntheir neighbors--with its curtains of big figured chintz, brown\r\nsunflowers sprawling over a white ground, drawn aside in the daytime\r\nto display the marvelous patchwork of the quilt beneath. Fuel was\r\nscarce even then on the sandy isle; and economy compelled Mr. and\r\nMrs. Macy to make use of this living-room as a bedchamber also, since\r\nThomas Macy confessed to \"bein rather tender,\" and to liking a warm\r\nroom to sleep In, though his neighbors often insinuated that he was\r\nkilling himself by the Indulgence. And indeed the heat must have been\r\nstifling when we consider the size of the fireplace, nine feet wide by\r\nfour deep, with a yawning throat, through which the rain poured freely\r\ndown on stormy nights, putting out the best arranged mass of coals,\r\nashes and peat, and, in spite of the little gutter purposely made\r\nround the broad brick hearth, sometimes overflowing and drenching\r\na portion of the neat rag carpet, in which, with true Quaker\r\nconsistency, no gay-colored fragment had been allowed a place.\r\n\r\nIn striking contrast to all this magnificence was the lowly home to\r\nwhich James Starbuck brought his happy bride. This little house was\r\n\"double\" also--that Is, it was entered in the centre by a small square\r\npassage just big enough for the outer door to swing in. On one side\r\nof this entry was a tiny parlor, as dismal as rag carpet, fireless\r\nhearth, dingy paper and dark-green paper shades to the small windows\r\ncould make it. On the other side of the entry was the tiny and cold\r\nbedroom of the senior Starbucks. In the centre of the house rose a\r\nmassive chimney, big enough to retain all the heat from a dozen fires.\r\nAcross the rear of parlor, chimney and bedroom ran the long, low\r\nsunshiny kitchen. At one end of this certain ladder-like stairs\r\nconducted to the loft, which had served Jim for a \"roosting-place\"\r\never since he had grown big enough to be trusted o' nights so far\r\naway from his mother. On Sarah's advent into the family the\r\ndismal \"best-room\" was made habitable by the addition of a\r\n\"four-poster\"--which Mrs. Starbuck senior regretted was only of\r\ncherry-wood and not carved--and by sundry little feminine contrivances\r\nof Sarah's own.\r\n\r\nI said that for a time all seemed to go on happily in this humble\r\nhome. And the seeming would have been reality had Jim possessed the\r\nfaith in his wife which she had in him. True, he loved and believed in\r\nher after his fashion, and his mother was a strong ally on his wife's\r\nside; but Jim had one fatal weakness of character. He resented the\r\nslightest look that was anything but simple admiration on the part of\r\nhis wife. A strong nature is not afraid of censure, but a weak one,\r\npleading sensitiveness, is easily roused to small retaliations,\r\nrepaying what is good in intention with what is evil. Jim, as his\r\nfather had truly told him, was \"not the pootiest-mannered feller a gal\r\never see,\" and in the daily home-life this became apparent to Sarah\r\nas it had never been in all the years they had been near neighbors.\r\nNaturally, she wished her husband to be pleasing to her father, and at\r\nlast ventured to hint, as delicately as she could, at various little\r\npoints in which improvements might be made. At first Jim did not seem\r\nvery restless under such reproofs, given, as they were, with many\r\na loving kiss and winsome look; but as months went on his wife's\r\ncaresses were more carelessly received, and her hinted corrections\r\nwith more of resentment. One evening stately old Thomas Macy had\r\n\"happened in,\" and Jim had greatly grieved his wife by his curt,\r\nuncivil manner to her father. After he had gone Sarah spoke in a low\r\ntone and kindly as always, but with more spirit than she had ever\r\nbefore manifested or felt, of her husband's disrespectful ways to the\r\naged.\r\n\r\nFor a moment after his wife had ceased, Jim sat with his hat\r\npulled closely over his eyes, fiercely biting into the apple he was\r\neating--biting and throwing the bits into the glowing mass of peat on\r\nthe hearth. Then he sprang to his feet, exclaiming, \"I see! It's all\r\ncome true, what ev'rybody said. Thee thinks thee an' thy folks is\r\nbetter'n me an' my folks, an' keeps all the time a-naggin' on me. I\r\nwish I'd merried Mary Allen! I won't stan' no more o' this talk. If I\r\nain't to be maaster o' my own house I won't stay in't.\" (The house was\r\nhis father's, but angry men never think of such trifles.) And waxing\r\npitiful of himself, he continued in a broken and injured tone, \"The\r\nbed o' the sea's the bes' place fur a man whose own wife's got tew big\r\nfeelin' ter put up wi' his ways.\"\r\n\r\nWith this dignified burst of eloquence the angry fellow flung himself\r\nout of the house, letting in at the door as he went a dash of cold,\r\nsleety rain and a gust of wind that put out the flickering tallow dip\r\nthat was enabling Sarah to take the last stitches in the tiny\r\nwhite slip that now fell from her fingers. Too sorely wounded for\r\nresentment, too fond of her husband to wish even his parents to see\r\nhim in the light in which he was now revealed to her, Sarah silently\r\nstooped to recover her work, and as she did so her hand was met under\r\nthe table by a sympathizing pressure from that of her mother-in-law.\r\nThis was too much, and, laying her head in the elder woman's lap,\r\npoor Sarah wept without restraint; while the mother sorrowfully and\r\ntenderly stroked her soft brown tresses. The father, quietly puffing\r\nat his pipe, seemed to take no notice, only now and then glancing with\r\nkindly eye covertly from under his hat-brim at the two grieving women.\r\n\r\nSilently, but for the roaring of the wind and surf and fitful dashing\r\nof the rain, the hours passed on till the high clock in the kitchen\r\ncorner sharply struck eleven. This was a late hour for those times,\r\nand a faint fear began to come upon them all. Could it be that Jim had\r\nreally meant what he said? \"Had he--\" And the two women looked blankly\r\nat each other. Not a word had been uttered, but each felt the other's\r\ndread.\r\n\r\nThe father rose and said with a well-affected yawn, \"Guess likely\r\nJim's went deown ter Uncle Will'amses, an' they thought as 't's so\r\nstormy he'd bes' not come back. So guess I'll jest go eout ter the\r\nshed and git some more peat, fur ter keep the fire.\"\r\n\r\nThus leaving the mother and wife partially reassured, the old\r\nfather slipped out and down the track, cut deeply in the sand by the\r\none-horse carts, to \"Uncle Will'amses,\" as fast as the storm would\r\npermit. But no Jim had been seen there; and still more anxiously the\r\nstout old man fought his way back against winds that seemed strong\"\r\nenough to blow him like a feather over the cliff's edge, and against\r\nthe spray which shot up from the beach below, smitten by the sounding\r\nsurf, clear over the high top of Sankota Head.\r\n\r\nReaching his door during a brief lull in the wind, he heard faintly\r\nbut distinctly the booming of guns fired by a ship in distress. \"It\r\nmus' be some vessil on the shoals, an' mos' likely Jim's heard her an'\r\ngot some o' th' other boys, an' 's went off in 's boat ter help her.\r\nPoor soul!\" With this comforting reflection the father cheered the\r\nwatchers inside, who had grown fearfully anxious, as the clock had\r\nlong ago struck for midnight.\r\n\r\n\"We mus' build a fire on the Head ter light 'em,\" said the old man.\r\n\"There hed oughter be a light'us here, but 's there ain't none, we\r\nmus' dew the bes' we kin,\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he harnessed the horse--almost as old as himself--and with\r\nthe aid of the two women loaded the sled with dry wood and started\r\nwith it to the cliff, while the mother and daughter followed behind as\r\nbest they might, struggling to keep alive without being set on fire\r\nby the coals in the iron pot which they carried between them. It was\r\na weary half mile, wind, spray and rain all contending against the\r\nfeeble folk who had come out to help back to land and home the brave\r\nfellows who had gone to succor the distressed. They made all the more\r\nsure that this was the case, because Jim's new boat, the pride and joy\r\nof his life, was not to be found at the spot where he had only that\r\nday drawn, it high above the reach of even such a storm as this, ready\r\nfor building over it on the morrow its winter house of pine-boughs and\r\nturf.\r\n\r\nAt last a fire was kindled; and leaving the women to watch it, old\r\nStephen took several weary trips back to the cottage after fuel,\r\nmaking serious inroads upon a stock at the best not too large to meet\r\nthe demands of the coming winter. The flame, fanned by the blast even\r\nmore than dashed by the spray and rain, sprang upward, casting its\r\nruddy lances of light backward over the sandy downs, destitute even\r\nthen of tree or shrub to break the force of the gale, and forward over\r\nthe frothing white tops and deep, black troughs of waves that seemed\r\nto the excited eyes of the watching women like so many separate fiends\r\nleaping upward and stretching out white hands to clutch helpless\r\nvictims and hurry them to the hell beneath. And all the while the\r\nsurf thundered at the foot of the trembling cliff. No form could be\r\ndiscovered through the darkness beyond the near neighborhood of the\r\nshore; and but for the flash of the gun, which was seen continually,\r\nthough its sound was but seldom heard above the surf and the wind, the\r\nwatchers would have thought there was no ship near.\r\n\r\nBy and by the rain ceased, but there was no moon, and impenetrable\r\nwind-clouds still hid the stars. Out through the blackness of the\r\nnight the flame-light quivered in long, bright streams over the\r\nendless lines of ever-advancing waves, but revealed to the watchers\r\nno ship, no boat, no tokens even of wreck, only the ceaseless reaching\r\nupward of the beckoning white hands; and the wind bore no sound, save\r\nat intervals the dull distant boom of the cannon. But ever the solemn\r\nsurf thundered on the beach below, and the sand-cliff trembled and\r\ncrumbled beneath its resounding blows.\r\n\r\nThe old man, who, with a seaman's owl-like eyesight, kneeled intently\r\ngazing out through the darkness in the direction of the flash,\r\nsuddenly exclaimed, \"I don't un'erstan' it! That air ship hadn't\r\noughter be in 'stress off where she is. She ain't on no shoal, nor\r\nnothin'. She's jest a-lyin' tew. An' I don't see no signs o' no boats\r\nnuther; an's fur's I kin see, them folks is a firin' off that air gun\r\njest fur the musicalness on't. Blast 'em! Come, gals: we mought as\r\nwell be walkin' along hum as ter stop a-yawpin' here in the wind an'\r\nspray, a-burnin' up the winter's kindlin' fur folks 'at's a-foolin' on\r\nus. 'Spesh'ly as I think she's a Britisher. Blast her!\"\r\n\r\nThe old Quaker was not accustomed to use strong language of any sort,\r\nbut evidently the human nature in him was so powerful in this instance\r\nthat he could not help indulging in the most emphatic admissible\r\ninvective.\r\n\r\nBut the mother and wife were not so easily satisfied. In their eyes\r\nthe strange ship and all on board her were not of as much consequence\r\nas the unworthy missing Jim, whose fate they associated with it.\r\nJim's boat, they said, was gone. No one could have taken her but Jim\r\nhimself. He would never have put out on such a night as this save to\r\ngo to the help of the distressed ship; and if he was on the water, the\r\nlight burning on Sankota Head would guide him safely back. So, in the\r\nmidst of spray and wind, the three kneeled on the cliff and kept the\r\nblaze alight till the rising dawn made it useless, when, to the dismay\r\nof the watchers, the ship hoisted sail and bore away. She showed no\r\ncolors, but the old islander, once a whaler, declared that she was a\r\nBritish man-o'-war.\r\n\r\nBut where was Jim? The unanswering surf still boomed at the foot of\r\nthe cliff, though the height of the waves was rapidly diminishing, and\r\nthe water was gradually assuming the peculiarly bland expression that\r\noften comes after a storm, reminding one of the cat that has \"eaten\r\nthe canary,\" but there was no sign of incoming boat or men.\r\n\r\nChilled to the bone with the wind and cold sea-spray of the November\r\nnight, and to the heart with sorrow and disappointment, the three\r\nreturned to the lonely house. Running to meet them came Mary Allen,\r\nbreathlessly crying, \"Where's Eben and Jim?\"\r\n\r\nPoor Sarah could not answer, but the brave old mother, a veteran in\r\nsorrows, replied with trembling lips, \"We don't know anythin' o' thy\r\nbrother, Mary; an' Jim hain't b'en hum sence las' night. His boat's\r\ngone, an' we thought he might ha' went out to help the ship that was\r\na-firin' all night. But she's sailed off this mornin' all right; an'\r\nfather, he says she was a Britisher an' undly a-firin' ter fool us\r\nfolks. So I don't know nothin' about it,\" uttering the last words in a\r\ndrearily hopeless tone that gave them exceeding pathos.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Mary stood in dismay; then she cried wildly, \"Oh, they're\r\ndrowned, they're drowned! Jim come deown ter eour heouse las' night\r\na-sayin' he'd heard the firin' o' a ship in 'stress, an' askin' Eb\r\nter go with him an' help him git his boat eout, an' telled me ter run\r\nalong deown to Zack Tumnaydoo's An' ax Zack an' Ellery ter go with\r\n'em. An' I did, an' that's the las' anybody's seen o' any one on 'em.\r\nOh dear! oh dear!\" And wringing her hands, the sobbing girl ran back\r\nas quickly as she had come to impart to her mother and sisters the\r\nfull extent of her evil tidings.\r\n\r\nThe cold, sad, desolate weeks and months that now rolled slowly on\r\nare to this day remembered on Nantucket as those of the \"hard winter.\"\r\nProvisions were scarce, fuel was difficult to obtain, the harbor\r\nwas frozen over, so that few fish could be taken there, and all\r\ncommunication with \"the main\" was cut off by British cruisers. In\r\nJanuary the cherished old horse was killed because there was no longer\r\nhay to feed him, and even oats were \"too precious to be fed to dumb\r\nbeasts.\" In February the stalwart old Stephen lay grimly down to die,\r\nsaying pityingly, \"It's time, gals: I can't dew ye no more good by\r\nstayin'; an' I'm so tired.\"\r\n\r\nThe day succeeding the silent funeral, where two women had dropped the\r\nfew tears that were left them to shed, good old Thomas Macy came and\r\ntook his daughter and her mother to his own home. And in windy, still\r\nfrozen March the wail of a tiny baby was heard in the house.\r\n\r\nUnder all the trouble the two brave women made no moan. Silently\r\nclinging together, never losing sight of each other for more than a\r\nfew moments at a time, they yet said nothing of their greatest grief,\r\nthat Jim should have disappeared with such unworthy words on his lips\r\nand thoughts in his heart, until, a few days after the baby's birth,\r\nSarah said to her mother, \"I know he's not dead. If he'd ha' died,\r\nhe'd ha' come back and told me he was sorry. Fur I dew think he'd be\r\nsorry. Don't thee, mother?\" And the mother nodded assent and smiled\r\nthrough her tears.\r\n\r\nBut, in truth, they had a more substantial reason than poor Sarah's\r\nwistful fancy for thinking that Jim was living. When the ice broke up,\r\nhis boat was found in a little cove, where it had floated right-side\r\nup, without any serious injury except the carrying away of the sails.\r\nOf course this discovery roused new hopes in the homes of the missing\r\nmen. It did not \"stand to reason\" that four big strong, temperate\r\nyoung fellows, brought up to the hardy, amphibious island-life, had\r\nall fallen overboard, any more than it \"stood to sense\" that the boat\r\nhad upset and then righted of itself. Besides, \"none of the boy's\r\ncorpuses had ever floated up.\" So the Tucketers took courage and\r\nfelt sure that, whatever had become of the missing men, they were not\r\ndrowned.\r\n\r\nBut still the slow months came and went, till the summer and autumn\r\nand another winter had passed by; and patient old Rachel Starbuck grew\r\ndaily a little quieter and a little grayer; and the brave young wife\r\ngrew a little stronger to bear, but not a whit less loving or prone to\r\nsuffer, and stately old Thomas Macy grew daily more gentle and pitying\r\nin his ways as he looked long at the winsome face of the happy, wee\r\ngrandchild, that throve and crowed and tried to utter sweet little\r\nhesitating words as gayly as if the world had never a sin, a sorrow or\r\na weakness in it.\r\n\r\nOne day Sarah and her mother had carried the baby down to the small\r\ncottage at the back of the cliff, whither they went to attend to\r\nsome little household matter; for, although they did not mention the\r\nsubject, even to themselves, they still kept all there in readiness\r\nagainst Jim's coming home. Here, in the soft May sunshine, the\r\nred-frocked baby was sitting on the green turf step, playing with\r\nsome \"daffies,\" first of the season, which Sarah had plucked from the\r\nlittle garden in the rear. The mother and daughter were in the house,\r\nwhen both were alarmed by a scream from the usually merry child. A man\r\nhad it closely clasped in his arms, kissing it and calling it between\r\nhalf-choked sobs his \"own pretty, pretty baby.\" The man was thin,\r\npock-marked, bald, and clad in a ragged uniform of a British sailor,\r\nbut to the faithful, longing eyes of mother and wife there was no\r\nmistaking their Jim.\r\n\r\nIt was long ere the story could be told, but at last they learned that\r\non that sad November night Jim and his companions had gone out to the\r\nrelief of the signaling ship. She was, as old Stephen had conjectured,\r\na British man-o'-war. Being short of hands, and having on board as\r\npilot a renegade native of the island, who knew where a ship could\r\n\"lay-to\" in safety, she had taken advantage of the storm to attract\r\nstrong men within the range of her guns, then to command them to\r\nsurrender, and thus to impress them into \"His Majesty's service\" as\r\n\"able seamen.\"\r\n\r\nFor a long time Jim had managed to keep alive his resentful feelings\r\ntoward his wife, accusing of being the source of all his misfortunes\r\nthe poor little woman who was loving and longing so sincerely for him.\r\nBut when illness came he could hold out no longer. \"I made up my mind\r\nthen,\" said he, \"that if ever I got hum agin, I'd go deown on my knees\r\nan' ax pardin' o' my Sairy.\"\r\n\r\nBut she had never been angry, and was now only too thankful that Jim\r\nand his friends had escaped safely.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Jim in telling his adventures, \"we hed a clus run on 't,\r\nSairy, but thee'd better believe that air British navy's a fust-rate\r\nplace fur larnin' a feller ter know when he's well off. An' Sairy,\r\nwhen I longed so fur thee an' mother, an' thought o' what a wretch I\r\nwas to speak so ter the dearest little woman in the world, I c'u'd see\r\nthat I hadn't knowed when I was well off.\"\r\n\r\nJim's was not an unselfish kind of repentance, but it was the best it\r\nwas in his nature to offer, and Sarah had long ago learned that her\r\nJim was not the saint and hero she had once dreamed, but only a weak\r\nand common-place man; and she asked for nothing higher from him. To\r\nhis best she had a right, and with that she was content, smiling on\r\nher husband with eyes full of a love as tender and true as when in the\r\nold days she had gazed down upon her lover from the cliff-head, while\r\nthe mother laid her hand softly on his scanty hair, and said solemnly,\r\n\"May God keep thee thus, my son!\" adding, after a moment's pause,\r\n\"But I wish thy fayther was here to see.\" And a tender silence for\r\nthe memory of the rough but kindly-natured old man fell over them all;\r\nwhile the baby, reconciled to the stranger, poked her little fingers\r\nin the marks on his face, and cried because she could not get them\r\noff.\r\n\r\nETHEL C. GALE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE OLD PLANTATION.\r\n\r\nTWO PAPERS.--II.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eastern sky is just beginning to assume that strange neutral tint\r\nwhich tells of the approaching dawn when we open the heavy hall door\r\nand step out into the crisp, frosty air. No moonlight hunting for me,\r\nwith the cold, deceitful light making phantom pools of every white\r\nsand-patch in the road, and ghostly logs and boulders of every\r\nwavering shadow. You are always gathering up your reins for leaps\r\nover imaginary fence-panels, which your horse goes through like a\r\nnightmare, and always unprepared for the real ones, which he clears\r\nwhen you are least expecting it. If the cry bears down on you, and you\r\nrein up for a view, the fox is sure to dodge by invisibly under cover\r\nof some dark little bay, and you get home too late for a morning nap\r\nand too early for the breakfast, which you have been longing after for\r\nthe last two hours. Then, too, your horse has lost his night's rest,\r\nand will be jaded for two days in consequence. No: the time to throw\r\nthe dogs off for a fox-hunt is that weird hour which the negroes\r\nsignificantly call \"gray-day:\" it is the surest time to strike a\r\ntrail, and by the time Reynard begins to dodge and double there will\r\nbe plenty of light to ride by and to get a good view. If the fox gets\r\naway or the cover is drawn without a find, you are always sure of\r\nhaving your spirits raised by the cheerful sunrise: by the time you\r\nget home, tired and spattered, the ladies are down stairs ready to\r\nmake pretty exclamations over the brush or to chaff you pleasantly\r\nfor your want of success; and then there is just time to get your hair\r\nbrushed and your clothes changed before the mingled aromas of fried\r\nsausage and old Java put the keen edge on your already whetted\r\nappetite.\r\n\r\nA ride across country after a rattling pack of English hounds on\r\na thoroughbred hunter with a field of red-coated squires is an\r\nexperience which few hunters on this side of the water have ever\r\nenjoyed, but with the incidents of which every reader of English\r\nnovels is familiar. The chase of the red fox in Maryland or Virginia\r\nhas some features in common with the British national sport, but that\r\nof the gray fox in the more southern States differs materially from\r\nboth. The latter animal is smaller and possessed of less speed and\r\nendurance than his more northern brother, but he is far more common\r\nand quite as cunning. He makes shorter runs, but over very different\r\nground, always keeping in the woods and dodging about like a rabbit,\r\nso that a different style of horse and a different method of riding\r\nare required for his capture. There is no risk of breaking your neck\r\nover a five-barred gate or a stone wall, but you may be hung in a\r\ngrapevine, or knocked out of the saddle by a low limb, or have your\r\nknee scraped against a tree-trunk. It is true you may catch your fox\r\nin twenty minutes, and three hours is an extraordinary run, but then\r\nyou may catch four or five between daylight and ten o'clock of an\r\nautumn morning.\r\n\r\nThe horses stretch their necks toward the stables and whinny as they\r\nthink of the bundles of untasted fodder: the dogs require no notes\r\nof the horn to rouse them, for they know the signs and are already\r\ncapering about in eager merriment, throwing their heads into the air\r\noccasionally to utter a long and musical bay. This wakes up the\r\ncurs about the negro-yard, and their barking stirs up the geese, the\r\ncombined chorus rousing all the cocks in the various poultry-houses,\r\nso that we ride off amid a hub-bub of howling, cackling, neighing and\r\ncrowing which would awaken the Seven Sleepers. We are first at the\r\nmeet, and the old woods ring with the mellow, winding notes of\r\nour horns--no twanging brass reeds in the mouth-pieces, but honest\r\ncow-horn bugles, which none but a true hunter can blow. The hounds\r\ngrow wild at the cheering sound, and howl through every note of the\r\ncanine gamut; the echoes catch the strain and fling it from brake to\r\nbay; the dying cadence strengthens into an answering blast, and the\r\nparty is soon increased to half a dozen bold riders and twenty eager\r\ndogs. Venus, the beautiful \"flag-star of heaven,\" is just toning her\r\nbrilliancy into harmony with the pale light which creeps slowly up\r\nfrom the eastern horizon, and some wakeful crow in the pine-thicket\r\ngives an answering caw to the goblin laugh of the barred owl in the\r\ncypress, as we leap our horses into a field of sedge and cheer on the\r\ndogs to their work. For half an hour we ride in silence save the\r\nwords of encouragement to the hounds, which are snuffing about\r\nunsuccessfully and whipping the hoar-frost with their tails from the\r\ndry yellow stems of the grass. Now and then some eager young dog opens\r\non the trail of a rabbit which has started from its form, but the\r\ncrack of a whip restrains him, and the other hounds pay no attention\r\nto him. Suddenly a sharp, quick yelp comes from the farthest corner of\r\nthe field, and the older dogs stop instantly and raise their heads\r\nto listen. Hark to old Blucher! There he is again, and the whole pack\r\ngive tongue and dash off to the call which never deceives them. We\r\ncatch a glimpse of the old fellow's white throat as he trots about in\r\na zigzag course, poking his tan muzzle into every clump of tall grass\r\nand giving tongue occasionally as he sniffs the cold trail. Presently\r\na long, quavering cry comes from old Firefly; again and again Blucher\r\nopens more and more eagerly; another and another dog takes it up, and\r\nthe trot quickens into a lope. The trail grows warmer as they follow\r\nthe line of fence, and just as we settle ourselves in the saddle for\r\na run it all stops and the dogs are at fault. But Blucher is hard to\r\npuzzle and knows every trick of his cunning game. Running a few panels\r\ndown the fence, he rears up on it and snuffs the top rail, and then,\r\nwith a yell of triumph, dashes over it into the woods, with the whole\r\npack in full cry at his heels. A ringing cheer announces that the\r\nfox has \"jumped,\" and the field scatters in pursuit. Two only, the\r\nsubscriber being one, follow the dogs with a flying leap. Some dash\r\noff in search of a low panel, others to head off the cry through the\r\ndistant gate, while others stop to pull the rails and make a gap.\r\nFor ten minutes we keep well behind the hounds, with a tight rein and\r\nheads bent to avoid the hanging oak limbs. But the fox has turned and\r\nplunged into a brake which no horse can go through, and we draw up\r\nand listen to decide where we can head him off with the greatest\r\ncertainty; then turn in different directions and spur through the\r\nyoung black-jacks. Ah! there he goes, with dragging brush and open\r\nmouth, and the pack, running close enough together to be covered by\r\na table-cloth, not sixty yards behind him. I am in at the death this\r\ntime, for he cannot run a hundred yards farther, and the brush is\r\nmine, for there's no one else in sight. With a savage burst the dogs\r\ndash after him into the thicket and then--dead silence, not a yelp,\r\nas they scatter and run backward and forward, nosing under every dead\r\nleaf and up the trunk of every tree. The fault is complete, and the\r\nyoung dogs give it up and lie down panting, while the older hounds try\r\nevery expedient to puzzle out the trail and take up the scent again.\r\nHe certainly has not treed, there is neither earth nor hollow to hide\r\nhim, and yet the scent has gone! And it never came back. If any reader\r\ncan tell what became of that fox, he is a wiser man than I. Certain\r\nit is that we never heard of him again; and for aught I know to the\r\ncontrary, he may have been that identical Japanese animal which turns\r\ninto tea-kettles and vanishes in puffs of smoke. It does not take\r\nlong, however, to make another find, and we go home after a three\r\nhours' chase with two fine brushes and appetites which would ruin any\r\nhotel-keeper in a week.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast a walk to the cotton-houses would be in order, for the\r\nsuccessful planter is he who trusts nothing to the overseer which can\r\nhave his personal supervision, and he must excuse himself to such of\r\nhis guests as prefer a cigar by the library fire to an hour spent in\r\nobserving the details of plantation work. In the days of which I write\r\nhorse-power was preferred to steam, and negro-power to both; and few\r\nplanters of the fine black-seed cotton could be convinced that any\r\n\"power-gin\" could be invented which would not injure the long, silky\r\n\"staple\" or fibre of the lint. The old-time \"foot-gins\" were used\r\nexclusively, and the gin-house was a place of curious interest to all\r\nvisitors. In one end of the long room was the huge pile of seed-cotton\r\nwhich was to pass through the rollers as the first step toward\r\nits preparation for the market. How simply does a sudden stroke of\r\ninventive genius solve a problem which wise men have regarded as\r\ninsoluble! Not much more than a century ago a commission of practical\r\nEnglish _savans_ discouraged the cultivation of a textile fabric\r\nwhich \"might be useful but for the impossibility of clearing it of the\r\nseeds!\" But the foot-gin appeared on the scene, and indigo went down\r\nbefore cotton. Ranged along the walls of the room are some twenty\r\nrough wooden frames, looking like a compromise between a straw-cutter\r\nand a sewing-machine, each furnished with two strong rollers operated\r\nby a treadle and acting precisely like those of a clothes-wringer.\r\nBehind each of these machines stands a man or woman with one\r\never-moving foot upon the treadle-board, feeding the seed-cotton from\r\na large bag to the greedy rollers, which seize it and pass the lint\r\nin fleecy rolls into another bag prepared for it, while the seed, like\r\nshirt-buttons touched by the afore-mentioned wringer, rolls off from\r\nthe hither side to form a pile upon the floor. Thence it will be\r\ncarted to the seed-house to be rotted into manure for the next crop,\r\nthere being no better fertilizer for cotton than a compost of which\r\nit forms the base. A portion of it, however, will be reserved to\r\nbe boiled with cow-peas and fed to the milch-cattle, no food being\r\nsuperior to its rich, oily kernel in milk-producing qualities. The\r\nnegro mothers use it largely in decoction as a substitute for cocoa,\r\nand the white mothers under similar circumstances having it parched\r\nand ground like coffee, when it makes an exceedingly palatable and\r\nnutritious beverage. The \"green-seed\" or short-staple variety is far\r\ninferior to the black for this purpose, and produces white, sticky,\r\ncottony-looking butter; indeed, most dairywomen insist that \"you\r\ncan pick the lint out of it.\" The ginned cotton is carried to the\r\nplatforms, where it is \"specked\" by the women--leaves, dirt and other\r\nimpurities being picked out by hand--and spread out to dry and bleach\r\nin the sun; thence we follow it to the \"moting-room,\" where it is\r\nthoroughly and finally overhauled, every minute particle of dirt or\r\nother foreign matter and every flock of stained and discolored cotton\r\nbeing picked out. This room is always in the second story, and at one\r\nend of it a circular hole is cut in the floor; through this hole hangs\r\nthe bag of strong, close gunny-cloth, very different from the coarse\r\ncovering which suffices for the lower grades of \"short-staple,\"\r\nsupported by a stout iron hoop larger by some inches than the hole\r\nin the floor, and to which the end of the bag is securely sewed. The\r\ncotton is thrown into this bag and packed with an iron rammer by a man\r\nwho stands in it, his weight assisting in the packing, each bag being\r\nmade to contain upward of four hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nEverything seeming to go on as it ought and all the necessary orders\r\nand directions being given, we walk out to take a look at the poultry.\r\nThere are fowls in abundance and superabundance, but our kind host\r\nis most proud of his flock of three hundred white turkeys; and a\r\nbeautiful sight they are, scattered over the grassy lawn. Ranging, as\r\nthese fine birds will, over a mile or two of woods abounding in their\r\nwild brethren, convenient mistakes were often made by the pineland\r\ngunners, whose rifles were always ready to pick off a stray gobbler\r\nwithout waiting to know whether he was wild or tame, and so the old\r\ngentleman introduced the white stock to prevent the possibility of\r\nsuch errors. For a similar reason no ducks were raised except those\r\nwhich wear top-knots. It is no unusual thing for wild gobblers and\r\nmallards to come up with the tame stock to the poultry-yard, and\r\nthe bronze feathers and shy habits of many of the young turkeys show\r\nevidence of their free parentage.\r\n\r\nIt is just impossible for a city man to remain indoors in the country\r\nwith the broad fields, the shady woods, the bright blue sky and\r\nthe merry pipe of birds calling him out to active exercise and\r\nunaccustomed sport. He is sure to think himself a sportsman, even if\r\nuncertain whether the shot or powder should first enter the gun;\r\nand if an old hand at the trigger, his uneasiness while in the house\r\nbecomes almost painful. Every article of hunting-gear is\r\noverhauled again and again; boots are greased, shot-pouches filled,\r\npowder-charges remeasured, guns cleaned and ramrods oiled; and I\r\nonce had a fine Manton--as sweet a piece as ever came to the\r\nshoulder--almost ruined by an eager friend, who, after going through\r\nall this during a stormy morning, insisted on taking off the locks\r\nand triggers, just to while away the time. The introduction of the\r\nbreech-loader most happily obviates all this, since such lagging hours\r\nmay now be occupied in charging and crimping cartridges. But there is\r\nnothing to detain us longer to-day: the \"Bob Whites\" are waiting for\r\nus among the pea-vines, and the snipe among the tussocky grass of the\r\nold rice-field. Di and Sancho have caught sight of the guns, and are\r\ncapering about in the wildest excitement, for it is a long time since\r\nthey have seen anything more \"gamey\" than a city pigeon. Birding over\r\ngood dogs is the very poetry of field-sports. The silken-haired setter\r\nand the lithe pointer are as far the superiors of the half-savage\r\nhound as the Coldstream Guards are of the Comanches. The hound has no\r\naffection and but little intelligence, and the qualities which make\r\nhim valuable are purely those of instinct. The long, hungry cry with\r\nwhich he follows the deer and the sharp, angry yelp which he utters\r\nwhen chasing the fox tell plainly that the motives which prompt him\r\nthus to use his delicate nose and unwearying powers of endurance are\r\nprecisely those which carry the Indian to the hunt or on the war-path.\r\nHe hunts for any master who will cheer him on, has no tactics but to\r\nstick to the trail and give tongue as long as the scent will lie, and\r\nmust be whipped off the game when caught to prevent his devouring\r\nit on the spot. The setter, on the other hand, is intelligent,\r\naffectionate and faithful. If properly trained and reared, he loves\r\nhis master and will hunt for no one else, learns to understand human\r\nlanguage to an astonishing degree and exhibits reasoning powers of no\r\nmean order. He hunts purely for sport, understands the habits of his\r\ngame, and regulates his tactics accordingly, and delivers the birds\r\nuninjured to his master, sometimes controlling his appetite and\r\ncarrying the game long distances for this purpose. I have frequently\r\ndiscovered that my dogs, brought up in the house, understood words\r\nwhich had never been taught them. My old favorite Di always answers\r\nthe dinner-bell and stands near my chair for odd scraps. Being\r\nsomewhat annoyed one day by her eagerness, I said playfully, \"Go to\r\nthe kitchen and tell Annie to feed you.\" She at once rushed off and\r\nscratched the kitchen door until the girl opened it, and then stood by\r\nthe tray of scraps looking at her and wagging her tail. Wanting one of\r\nmy little sons one evening, I said, \"Di, go find the boys!\" She rushed\r\noff, looking and smelling about their usual haunts, but returned\r\nunsuccessful. I scolded and sent her a second and third time, with the\r\nsame result: a few minutes after she came quietly behind me with the\r\n_hat_ of my youngest boy in her mouth: she had taken it from a table\r\nin the passage, and her wagging tail said plainly, \"Will this answer?\r\nIt's the best I can do.\" The same dog will creep carefully upon\r\npartridges, and stand as if cut in marble lest they should fly, but\r\nwill chase turkeys at full speed, giving tongue like a hound, and then\r\nlie still for hours while they are called up and shot, nor will she\r\never confound the different habits of the two birds or the different\r\nmethods of hunting them.\r\n\r\nSuch are the highly-bred and intelligent animals which are eagerly\r\nwaiting for us to-day--Di, with her white coat, soft as wavy silk, her\r\nchestnut ears and one spot on the back alone marring its snowy purity;\r\nSancho, jet black, with \"featherings\" like a King Charles spaniel.\r\nThey are over the fence already, and tearing about the field so\r\nrecklessly in the exuberance of their joy that they must certainly\r\nstartle any game which may be there. The timid little field-buntings\r\nglide away on silent wing through the grass; the meadow-larks rise\r\nwith gentle flappings and sail off with that easy flight so tempting\r\nto very young wing-shots; now and then a flock of doves whistle off\r\ntoo far for a certain shot, and clouds of crow-blackbirds rise with\r\nhoarse chirps and seek less public feeding-grounds; a rabbit dashes\r\noff from a brier-patch and both dogs rush pell-mell at his heels, but\r\na single note from the whistle brings them to a sudden halt and makes\r\nthem look thoroughly ashamed of themselves. Off they go again, as\r\nwild as deer; but suddenly Di's whole action changes: crouching to the\r\nground and beating her sides rapidly with her tail, she runs hither\r\nand thither, snuffing eagerly in the grass. Now Sancho comes up and\r\ncatches the cold trail, for a covey has certainly been in that place\r\nto-day. Most probably they rose from the spot, frightened by the swoop\r\nof a hawk, and made for the nearest cover, for the dogs can do nothing\r\nwith the scent. But that little whiff of the exciting effluvia has\r\nbrought them down to their work, and a beautiful sight it is as they\r\nquarter the ground with quickly-beating tails and noses high in the\r\nair, crossing and recrossing the wind in zigzag lines and concentric\r\ncircles, hunting the ground so closely that no trail, however cold,\r\ncan escape their keen sense of smell. A wave of the hand to Sancho,\r\nand the sagacious fellow is off toward the far corner of the field,\r\nwhen suddenly Di stops in mid-career with a jerk that must try every\r\nsinew in her frame. The birds are right under her nose, and she dares\r\nnot move a muscle, but stands as if changed into stone, her eyes\r\nstarting with excitement, her nostrils expanded, her feathery stern\r\nquivering stiffly out behind and every line of her figure standing out\r\nlike whipcord. \"Toho!\" The black dog catches the sound and turns his\r\nhead: he sees her rigid form, and backs her where he stands as firmly\r\nas if he too had the scent. There is no hurry, for the dogs are true\r\nas steel and will stand there as long as the frightened birds lie,\r\nwhile the latter, obedient to the instinct of sudden terror, will\r\ncower where they are for an hour, with their heads drawn back, their\r\nmottled breasts pressed to the earth and their legs gathered under\r\nthem, ready to spring into the air. We cock our guns, agree to shoot\r\nrespectively at the birds which go right or left or straight before\r\nus, and then advance to flush the covey ourselves. The staunch dog\r\nnever winces as we pass her: two paces, three, a sudden rush and whirr\r\nas of many wings, five sharp reports in quick succession and four\r\nbirds down! Another, wild with fright, rises straight up for twenty\r\nfeet and darts off behind us, but his beautiful head droops as the\r\ncrack of my last barrel resounds on the air and a cloud of feathers\r\nfloats downward. The shot has struck him in the line of flight, and he\r\ngoes to the ground with a bounce, some thirty yards away, as if hurled\r\nthere by a vigorous arm. The well-trained dogs come to the \"Down!\r\ncharge!\" while we reload our guns, and then seek the dead birds and\r\nbring them carefully in to us.\r\n\r\nLeaving the broken covey to be worked up on our return, we push on to\r\nanother part of the large pea-field, where, perched upon the topmost\r\nlimb of a tall dead pine, we see a red-tailed hawk engaged in quiet\r\nobservation. There is no surer sign of birds, but it takes close\r\nhunting to find them, for they dare not move about while their savage\r\nenemy is on the watch. As we approach the hawk stretches out his neck,\r\njerks his wings two or three times and oscillates his ungainly body,\r\nand then, with a loud scream of angry disappointment, he is off. The\r\ntree stands in a little piece of sedge, not far from a dense growth of\r\npine-saplings, and we know that the moment the hawk left his perch the\r\nbirds started for the cover, and our only chance for shooting is to\r\nhead them off and turn them. The dogs have struck the running trail,\r\nand their action is totally different from what it was with the first\r\ncovey. Crouching flat to the ground, they glide after the startled\r\nbirds with a snake-like movement, now stopping, now running swiftly\r\nin. Suddenly Di leaves the trail and dashes off at full speed to the\r\nright. Making a wide circuit, she skirts the pines, and, turning short\r\nround, comes to a firm stand in the very face of the retreating covey,\r\nwhile Sancho lies prone with his nose between his paws. It is an\r\nold trick of hers thus to \"huddle\" running birds, and we follow her\r\nexample, come up behind her, and get six with four barrels as the\r\nbirds rise in a bunch.\r\n\r\nBut if the reader follows us too closely, he will have all the fatigue\r\nof a long tramp without the compensation of healthful excitement\r\nand full game-pockets. Thirty-five fine birds in a pile on the\r\npantry-table offer a capital _raison d'être_ for weary feet and soiled\r\nfingers when we reach home just in time for the supper-bell. There\r\nhave been some arrivals while we were gone, for Christmas is near at\r\nhand, and the old house is filling up with guests. To-morrow the \"St.\r\nJohn's Hunting-Club\" has its monthly deer-hunt and dinner at Black\r\nOak, and we need a good night's rest to prepare us for an experience\r\nthe omission of which would render imperfect any truthful reminiscence\r\nof life at the old plantation.\r\n\r\nDuring the months spent at the plantation there is little social\r\nvisiting among the gentlemen, and, except on Sundays and occasions\r\nof public meetings, the various local clubs offer their only\r\nopportunities for seeing each other, Another object--at least, under\r\nthe old _régime_--was to bring together those who occupied somewhat\r\ndifferent social positions. Formerly the clubs were strictly\r\nexclusive, and, indeed, this feature was never lost, but in every\r\ncommunity there would be some _novi homines_, clever men many of them,\r\nwhom the old gentry were quite willing to recognize, though a marked\r\ndifference in culture prevented family visiting. These could be\r\nadmitted to membership, and at the club-house could be met on equal\r\nterms. The hunting feature was always preserved, though few of the\r\nolder members ever joined in the sport. Under the rules there was a\r\nplace, a day and an hour for the weekly meet; and I remember when it\r\nwas a safe thing to be at \"the White Bridge\" on the Santee Canal any\r\nSaturday morning at nine o'clock. Somebody was sure to be there with\r\ndogs and driver, prepared for a \"wallet-hunt\"--i.e., an all-day hunt\r\nwith wallets at the crupper well filled with hunter's cheer. Once a\r\nmonth the club met for dinner, each member \"finding\" in turn, and\r\non that day a single drive, or at most two, was all that could be\r\nenjoyed. The club-house was a plain frame building in the woods, with\r\na huge fireplace at each end, heavy stationary pine table extending\r\nthe length of the room, and broad soft-pine benches. The dishes,\r\nwines, liquors and cigars were all specified in the rules, the\r\nfinder being allowed two extra dishes at will, and supplying all the\r\ncrockery, cutlery and glass. The kitchen was a rough shed close to the\r\ncool and shaded spring of pure, clear water. Being myself but a guest,\r\nI have not the privilege of extending an invitation to the reader;\r\nso, by his leave, we will drop the present tense and I will assume the\r\npart of _raconteur_. How vividly do the scenes of that day come back\r\nthrough the highways of memory, crowded as they are with experiences\r\nof more than twenty varied years! As I rode up to the bridge on that\r\nbright December morning I found a party which promised rare sport.\r\nThere was Kit Gillam with his crooked nose, and Tom Clifton with his\r\ndeadly Manton and fine cry of dogs, and cheery Jack Parker, who hunted\r\nonly for the good company, and whose gun was as likely as not to be\r\nunloaded when the deer came out to him. Two drives were decided on\r\nwhich might be relied on for shooting, and yet were small enough to\r\ngive ample time for reaching the club-house before dinner.\r\n\r\nAs we rode toward our stands I thought it a good chance to settle\r\na point which had long excited my curiosity. \"Kit,\" said I, \"I have\r\noften wondered how your nose got out of plumb. What caused it?\"\r\n\r\n\"When I was a little bit of a boy I fell down and stepped on it.\"\r\n\r\nThis very satisfactory explanation brought us to our ground, and\r\nwe were soon at our respective stands and listening eagerly for the\r\ntrail-notes of the old hounds. The deer have regular runs, from which\r\nthey rarely deviate, and which do not vary in the course of years.\r\nThese are guarded by the standers while the game is driven down\r\nfrom the opposite direction. A large drive may have a dozen of these\r\nstands, by one of which the deer will almost certainly pass, but which\r\none nobody knows. Quiet is absolutely necessary and a cigar is fatal\r\nto sport, but concealment is useless, as these animals see imperfectly\r\nin daylight.\r\n\r\nI had not to wait long before I caught the distant cheering and\r\nhand-clapping of the drivers as they encouraged the dogs to hunt.\r\nIn the quiet of the sombre woods every sound was distinctly audible.\r\nSuddenly three or four quick, sharp yelps brought my gun to the\r\n\"ready,\" and the hammers clicked as a burst of music followed. But\r\nabove the clamor of the hounds came the crack of the driver's whip,\r\nand his voice, mellowed by distance, was heard in angry tones: \"Come\r\nback yah, you good-for-nuttin', wutless lee' rabbit-dog, you! I sway\r\nmaussa ha' for shoot da' puppy 'fore he spile ebery dog in de pack!\"\r\n\r\nSoon, however, came another open, deep and musical, and there was no\r\nmistaking old Drummer's trail-note: then Killbuck joined in, and then\r\nthe cry became general. For a while the broken, quavering tongue tells\r\nthat the dogs are only trailing and the deer is still cowering in his\r\nbed, or perhaps has sneaked out of the drive at the first sound of the\r\nhorn. Hark! what a burst! They had \"started\" within two hundred yards\r\nof me. The next moment there was a rustle of leaves, and a yearling\r\ndoe dashed by. I am not a dead shot, and have nothing to say about\r\nthat first barrel, but the second sent her down and over with a roll\r\nthat almost broke her neck. The dogs were stopped and the deer\r\nthrown over the pommel of one of the boys, and we rode on to try the\r\nBrunswick swamp. The boy had assured us that \"One pow'ful big buck bin\r\nin day (there) las' night. I see all he track gwine in, an' I nebber\r\nsee none come out.\"\r\n\r\nWe were soon strung along the narrow dam across which the game was to\r\nbe forced by the drivers, who had to make their way through an ugly\r\nbog among cypress \"knees\" and dense brier-patches. Jack Parker stood\r\nnext to me, fidgeting about uneasily, because it was against rules to\r\ntalk on stand. Jack's prominent feature was his nose, and he had\r\nan incorrigible trick of blowing it \"out loud\" whenever there was a\r\nparticular reason for keeping perfectly quiet. The dogs had begun\r\nto open, and their loose, scattering trail-notes indicated turkeys.\r\nLooking directly before me, I saw seven noble gobblers stepping\r\ncautiously toward my stand. Their glossy breasts glittered with\r\ncoppery lustre in the straggling sunbeams as, with drooping wings and\r\nexpanded tails, they advanced, looking fearfully about and uttering\r\ntheir low alarm-notes, \"Quit! quit! quit!\" Three more steps will make\r\na certain shot, and--out rang Jack's nasal clarion, loud and clear as\r\nthe _morte_ at a fox-chase. I looked round in horror, and there\r\nstood my hunter complacently eying me and flourishing his white silk\r\nhandkerchief, while his gun leaned against a tree ten paces distant:\r\n\"Expect I'd better go back to my stand, eh? Are those dogs barking at\r\na deer?\"\r\n\r\nI jumped to my feet for a snap-shot at the old gobbler which flew over\r\nme, making a clear miss. Bang! bang! went two more guns; a woodcock\r\nwhistled up from the bog and two swamp-rabbits dashed into the\r\nbrier. The dogs came out, shaking the water from their coats, and the\r\nspattered drivers rode through the creek. There was not a feather to\r\nshow, and of course everybody was \"down\" on Jack, but with an air of\r\ndeep injury he put it off on me with the question, \"Why didn't you\r\ntell me the turkeys were coming? How can a fellow help having a cold?\"\r\n\r\nWe reached the club-house just in time to take our seats as dinner was\r\nserved, and were in capital condition to enjoy the rich mutton, the\r\nfat turkey, the juicy home-cured ham and the rare old madeira which\r\ngraced the board. This last was a specialty with the gentlemen of\r\nthose days, and probably no cellars in the world could boast choicer\r\nvintage than the \"Newton & Gordon\" and \"Old Leacock\" which cheered the\r\ntable of that \"hunting-club.\" There were stronger liquors, too, though\r\nthese were chiefly used as appetizers before dinner. The moderate use\r\nof brandy was universal, but the drunkenness which blots these days of\r\nprohibitory laws was comparatively rare. Few ever left the club-house\r\n\"disguised\" by liquor except the young men, who then, as now and\r\nalways, would occasionally indulge in a \"frolic.\" With the clearing of\r\nthe board came the regular and volunteer toasts, and then an hour of\r\n\"crop-talk\" and \"horse-talk\" and hunting-stories over the wine and\r\ncigars. With the departure of the older members came the inevitable\r\nquarter-race, with its accompaniment of riding feats which would have\r\ndone credit to a Don Cossack. The equestrian performance was commenced\r\nby Kit Gillam (who now dismounts and leads over every little\r\nditch) forcing his active chestnut up the wooden steps and into\r\nthe club-room, and rearing him on the dining-table. Then came a\r\nleaping-match over a ten-railed fence, resulting in the barking of\r\nsome shins and the demolition of sundry panels of rail. Joe Keating,\r\nthe wildest rider I ever knew, had emptied his tumbler too often, and\r\ninsisted on running his horse home through the woods. An hour after\r\nhe was overtaken trudging along the road, perfectly sober, with the\r\nsaddle on his shoulders and the bridle over his arm.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Joe, where's your horse?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dead!\" was the laconic reply.\r\n\r\nSure enough. He had run full against a huge pine, and the horse had\r\ngone down with a broken skull. He never tried it again.\r\n\r\nChristmas Eve has come at last, and the old plantation is in all its\r\nglory. Carriage after carriage has deposited its freight of blooming\r\ngirls and merry-eyed children at the broad, open hall-door. There is\r\nnot a vacant stall in the stables, nor an unoccupied bedroom among all\r\nthe seventeen of the spacious mansion. The broad dinner-table is\r\nset diagonally in the long dining-room, and to-morrow, at least, the\r\nguests will have to take two turns at filling its twenty seats, while\r\nthe children go through the same manoeuvre in the pantry. Where they\r\nwill all sleep to-night is a mystery which none can unravel save the\r\nbusy, hospitable \"lady of the manor;\" but it makes little\r\ndifference, for there will be little sleeping done. The day passes\r\nin riding-parties and rowing-parties and similar amusements, as\r\neach freely follows the bent of his inclination. \"Brass,\" the negro\r\nfiddler, has been summoned, and \"Newport\" comes with his stirrup and\r\nsteel for the \"triangle\" accompaniment, and the merry feet of the\r\ndancers are soon keeping time to the homely but inspiriting music. The\r\n\"German\" and the \"Boston\" have not usurped the places of the old-time\r\ncotillon, quadrille and Virginia reel, and the dance is often varied\r\nby romping games of \"Blindman's Buff,\" \"Move-House\" and \"Stage-Coach,\"\r\nin which old and young unite with equal zest.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the limit of the fun. From time immemorial Christmas\r\nEve has been licensed for the performance of all sorts of tricks,\r\nand demure little faces are flitting about convulsed by the effort to\r\nconceal the merry sense of mischief. The stockings are duly hung for\r\nSaint Nicholas, and the holly, with its glossy leaves and scarlet\r\nberries, stands ready to be planted in the parlor, to bloom to-morrow\r\ninto all kinds of rich flowers and gift-fruit. At nine o'clock the\r\nwork of arranging the Christmas tree begins. The ladies retire, and\r\nafter a quiet smoke by the roaring hall-fire the gentlemen follow\r\nsuit. To bed, but not to sleep. Jack Parker is the first man ready,\r\nand bounces into the best bed to secure the softest place; but the\r\nbars have been skillfully removed, and he is the centre of a rather\r\nmixed pile on the floor. I feel another, to be sure that all is right,\r\nand slip cozily between the sheets, but some graceless little wretch\r\nhas placed a walking-cane \"athwart-ships,\" which nearly breaks my\r\nback. None escape. Some find their sheets strewed with chaff or\r\ncockle-burs, some find no sheets at all. At midnight a fearful roar\r\ncomes from the girls' room, followed by pretty shrieks and terrible\r\nconfusion; but it is only the old Cochin rooster, which was slyly shut\r\nup in the empty chimney-place before they retired, indulging in his\r\nfirst crow.\r\n\r\nDaylight puts an end to all sleep, for the boys are on the piazza\r\nready to welcome Christmas with innumerable packages of fire-crackers.\r\nWe rise to find our pantaloons sewed up, our boots stuffed with wet\r\ncotton, our tooth-brushes dusted with quinine and our _café noir_\r\nsweetened with salt. These practical jokes are all taken in good\r\npart and made to contribute to the jollity of the season. At\r\nthe breakfast-table lumps of cracked marble serve admirably for\r\nloaf-sugar, except that the hottest coffee will not dissolve them, and\r\nboiled eggs tempt the appetite only to disappoint with their sawdust\r\nfilling. Then all assemble on the piazza to witness the merriment\r\nof the crowd of negroes who have assembled to claim little gifts of\r\ntobacco and sugar and to receive the annual glass of whisky which a\r\ntime-honored custom bestows. The liquor is served in a wine-glass, and\r\nswallowed eagerly by men, women and boys from ten years old upward.\r\nThen they disperse to get their portion of the Christmas beef which\r\nhas been slaughtered for their special benefit, and we prepare for\r\nservice at the parish church, which stands among the shadows of the\r\nold forest oaks an easy walk from the house. There the solemn services\r\ntemper and soften, but do not check or lessen, the joy and good-will\r\nwhich so well become the season, and which find their appropriate\r\nmanifestation in all kinds of innocent amusement. The religious and\r\nthe social observances of the day react each upon the other, and\r\nharmonize most admirably in the impressions which they produce. The\r\ninterchange of gifts and tokens around the Christmas tree follows\r\nmost appropriately, and the Christmas feast is marked by profuse\r\nhospitality and keen enjoyment unmarred by riot or excess.\r\n\r\nAh, well! there are piles of dusty memories in the old cockloft still\r\nuntouched, but I shall rummage no more to-night. The scenes which have\r\nfloated past me with the wreathing smoke of my cigar are green and\r\nfragrant to me with a freshness which time can never blight, but they\r\nnever can harden into reality again for any mortal experience. They\r\nhave gone into the irretrievable past with a state of things which\r\nsome may regret and others rejoice in, and well will it be if the new\r\n_régime_ shall supply their places with other pictures which twenty\r\nyears hence it may be no less pleasant to remember.\r\n\r\nROBERT WILSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR MONTHLY GOSSIP.\r\n\r\nA GERMAN AGRICULTURAL FAIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the 27th to the 30th of September all Stuttgart flocks to\r\nCannstatt for the _Volksfest_; and this year every good Würtemberger\r\nwas bound to feel an additional interest in the fête on account of\r\nthe opening ceremony, the inauguration of a statue to the late king,\r\nWilhelm I.--and \"well beloved,\" one is tempted to add from the way\r\nin which his people still speak of him. \"The old king\" and \"this one\"\r\nthey say with an inflection of voice anything but flattering to\r\nthe latter. Our landlady assures us that let the weather look as\r\nthreatening as it would, the sun always contrived to burst out when in\r\nformer times the late king rode into the arena to give the prizes; and\r\nshe is evidently by no means certain it will not pour all three days\r\nof the fair this year. However, to judge from the skies, \"this one\" is\r\nnot so bad as he might be: the sun shines propitious on him too, and\r\nconsequently on us as we set forth to see what we can see. The second\r\nis the great day, as the prizes are then distributed; but already on\r\nMonday the booths and shows were on the field, and Cannstatt was gay\r\nwith banners and wreaths and garlands of green. The carpenters were\r\nstill hard at work hammering at seats for us to occupy next day,\r\nbut the wonderful triumphal arch stood quite completed and worthy of\r\nsincere admiration. No one knows who has not seen it worked into an\r\narchitectural design how beautiful a string of onions can be, how\r\ngorgeous a row of vegetable-marrows, how delicate a cluster of\r\nturnips. It sounds puerile, but it was lovely nevertheless. Imagine a\r\ntemple-like construction all composed of odorous pine, with an arched\r\nportal on either hand, and then every line and curve, every niche and\r\npillar and balustrade, defined with glowing fruit. It was looped in\r\nfestoons and hung in tassels of red and white and gold: the arms of\r\nWürtemberg even were traced in yellow corn, while above it all rose\r\na graceful column, a mosaic from base to summit of every fruit that\r\nautumn can bring to perfection.\r\n\r\nThat was the great show: after that, mammoth cucumbers and carrots or\r\nrows of agricultural implements did not detain us long. The next best\r\nthing was to see the booths and the crowd on the outskirts of the\r\nexhibition. There the circus was in full blast, and triumphant,\r\nbrazen-throated opposition to all smaller attractions that had\r\nventured into that neighborhood. The performing dogs in red petticoats\r\nwere reduced to making an appearance before their tent to entice\r\nspectators, and Harlequin and Columbine had to shout themselves hoarse\r\ninviting people to come in and split with laughter for sixpence. Those\r\nwho did not aspire to a seat under painted canvas gathered round a\r\nmelancholy bear dancing a _pas seul_ on the grass with heartbroken\r\ngravity. Then came the _Schützhallen_, where the marksmen stationed\r\nthemselves three feet from the target and cracked away at it with no\r\nother visible effect than that produced on a monkey doing its tricks\r\nclose by: at every shot the poor little creature stopped fiddling and\r\nlooked over its shoulder with a distressed air of \"If I'm not hit this\r\ntime!\" Hand-organs, penny trumpets and rattles quite drowned the voice\r\nof a street-songstress with a large assortment of vocal music before\r\nher, from which she was giving the public a selection. Whether the\r\nsongs had any reference to the pictures that formed her background we\r\ndid not discover, but, at all events, the latter were tragic in the\r\nextreme. \"The twenty-four-year-old murderer of his mother and six\r\nbrothers and sisters\" was there portrayed in a neat suit of black,\r\nwith a hatchet in his hand and a very irresolute expression of\r\ncountenance, while the various members of his family, seen through\r\nthe open bedroom doors, awaited their fate in peaceful slumber. The\r\nbooths, with toys, gingerbread, sausages, cheese and light literature\r\ntastefully intermingled, went on and on like the restaurants that\r\nlined each side of the long avenue. Around primitive tables family\r\nparties clinked foaming glasses and hailed with demonstrative\r\nhospitality any stray cousin who chanced that way. In one of the last\r\nof these improvised _Trinkhallen_ we came upon a young man and maiden\r\nwho had the place quite to themselves. Her brown parasol kept the\r\nsun off them both, and it was of no sort of consequence that they had\r\nnothing more interesting than the back of a shed to look at. Future\r\nprospects were the only ones they cared for: the present had no need\r\nof anything but a faint beeriness, conducive to day-dreaming.\r\n\r\nAs we get into the carriage again our coachman says we must see the\r\nnew statue. Accordingly, we drive through the town and halt before it\r\nin the square. It is very fine, glowing like gold from the mint.\r\nThe king sits his charger well, and gazes majestically at nothing in\r\nparticular: still, one must be a little critical, and we imagine the\r\nhorse's tail is not quite right. But then is not the whisk of a tail\r\nin bronze almost impossible to conceive of? If the artist suffers no\r\nseverer censure than that, he will probably call himself a happy\r\nman. The inscription on the pedestal of the statue reads, \"From his\r\ngrateful people.\" High and low have contributed to it, and gladly.\r\n\"That was a man!\" says our driver. He was a soldier under him, and\r\nknows. And in fact the old king seems to have been always doing\r\nsomething for the country, so that the gratitude is not without a\r\ncause. The inhabitants of Cannstatt have special reason to remember\r\nhim kindly: he himself was grateful to them and showed it. In the\r\ntroublous times of 1848 he was sadly in need of money: Ludwigsburg\r\n(another satellite of Stuttgart) refused it, while Cannstatt came\r\nup to the mark handsomely. The royal creditor never forgot that. He\r\ninstituted the _Volksfest_ as a sort of memorial, and Cannstatt is\r\nproud and prosperous, while Ludwigsburg is like a city of the dead.\r\nSo the coachman affirms; and once conversation is opened between us it\r\nflows without intermission. His head is over his shoulder all the way\r\nas we roll back to the city under the beautiful trees of the palace\r\ngrounds. \"If the old king had been living, Würtemberg would never have\r\njoined in the last war: he would have told Prussia to fight it out by\r\nherself.\" Apropos of the war, we ask what he thinks of Bismarck.\r\nHe evidently thinks a great deal of him, though not perhaps in the\r\ngenerally accepted sense of that expression. He states as a fact that\r\nthere _are_ limits, leaving it to us to understand that the chancellor\r\nof the empire has overstepped them. He declares further that a\r\nPrussian, and especially a Berliner, is always to him an obnoxious\r\nmember of society through his insisting on knowing everything (except\r\nhis own place) better than anybody else. \"Now, there was the Prussian\r\ngeneral before this last one,\" he continues, changing from politics\r\nto court-gossip (naturally, since 1870, military matters in Würtemberg\r\nflourish under Prussian auspices): \"the first ball he went to at the\r\npalace he asked the queen to dance! _Our_ queen!! And then he took his\r\nwhole family, and they sat in chairs that never were meant for them,\r\nso that the king had to say to him next day, \"Mr. General, first come\r\nI, and then my ministers, and then this one, and then that one, and\r\n_then_ you.\" He went back to Berlin soon after. It is pleasanter to\r\nsit one's self down where one doesn't belong than to be set down\r\nby somebody else.\" Our driver chuckles, and then bursts out afresh,\r\n\"Asking the _queen_ to dance!\" He certainly has perfect faith in his\r\nown stories.\r\n\r\nWe saw the successor of that presumptuous military man next day\r\namong the greater and lesser lights that revolve around the throne of\r\nWürtemberg. We ourselves were stationary, crowded into the foremost of\r\nthe tiers of seats that rose surrounding the immense enclosure, and\r\nin the best place for observation, close by the royal pavilion.\r\nThe hills, bright in the sun and velvet in shadow, made a natural\r\namphitheatre beyond, a little church with its pretty tower looked\r\npicturesquely down from a neighboring height, and the whole place\r\nwas gay with flags and branches, glittering uniforms and gorgeous\r\nliveries. We were to see the _hohe Herrschaften_ come in at the\r\nfarthest entrance and drive around directly before our seats. As the\r\ntrumpets flourish and the first magnificence sweeps by we hear all\r\nabout us, \"The princess Vera,\" and \"No, the duchess of Uhra,\" and \"Is\r\nit?\" \"Isn't it?\" \"Which is it?\" till we finally settle down to the\r\nserene conclusion that it is either one or the other. There is no\r\nmistaking the queen, however, with the outriders, six superb black\r\nhorses and postilions in scarlet and gold. The Majesty herself looks\r\npale and resigned, bending to the right and left in answer to the\r\nbows and _hochs._ Our neighbors \"the Weimars\" come in full force. A\r\nsuperfluous prince of that family appears to have drifted to these\r\nregions, and makes our street aristocratic for us. Young Weimar looks\r\nuncommonly well in his hussar uniform, and the old prince and his wife\r\nand daughter are resplendent. We met them later that same day in town,\r\nbut they had taken off their best clothes, and truth compels us sadly\r\nto admit that we should hardly have known them.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time, after various false alarms on our part, the\r\nband confidently strikes up \"God Save the King!\" and there is a\r\nflashing and prancing in the distance that creates a great stir. The\r\ncitizen guard, a stately body of burghers, rides out with the king on\r\nthis day of all the year, and comes caracoling by in fine style, he in\r\nthe midst bowing and smiling. And now, after the _Herrschaften--hohe_\r\nand _höchste_--come the animals. First, horses haughtily stepping,\r\nand then splendid bulls with wreaths on their horns and garlands round\r\ntheir--waists shall we say?--are led before the king, standing at the\r\nfoot of the steps and handing the prizes to the farmers, who present\r\nthemselves, ducking and scraping. It seems a shame to tie up the\r\ncreatures' legs so, and put rings through their noses: some have\r\neven a cloth bound over their heads; and if all these precautionary\r\nmeasures are necessary, it ought to be a relief when the procession of\r\nmild cows begins, They look out amiably from under the floral crowns\r\nthat have slipped low on their brows, or turn with half-conscious\r\npride to the handsome little calves that trot beside them. The sheep,\r\nseeking to attract too early the notice of royalty, dash out in a\r\nflock, and are driven back with jeering and hooting, as they deserve\r\nto be. Then the pigs stagger by: their garlands are excessively\r\nunbecoming. Such of the family of swine as are too young to stagger\r\nare wheeled in handcarts in the rear; and so the ceremonies are\r\nclosed, except for a couple of races which take place immediately, and\r\nwith no great éclat. The burgher races these are called, while on the\r\nthird and last day are the officers' races. The rain prevented our\r\nattending them, and we consoled ourselves, hearing it intimated by\r\nthose who had been at Ascot and Longchamps that we had not lost a\r\ngreat deal.\r\n\r\nG.H.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PAIR OF WHEELS AND AN OLD PARASOL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe threads from which the tissue of history is being woven are ever\r\nin unceasing and rapid motion in the hands of the Fates. But these\r\ndeities for the most part love to work unseen, like the bees. It is\r\nonly when the spinning is going on with exceptional rapidity and\r\nvigor that the movements of the threads and the characteristics of the\r\noperation can be observed on the surface of social life, Such is\r\nthe case in these days at Rome, and it is not necessary to watch the\r\nactions of governments or listen to the discussions of legislative\r\nchambers in order to assure one's self of the fact. One cannot walk\r\nthe streets without having the phenomena which are the outward and\r\nvisible signs of it thrust in a thousand ways on the observation\r\nof our senses. The other day I read a whole chapter of contemporary\r\nhistory compressed into the appearance of a pair of wheels engaged in\r\ntheir ordinary daily duty in the streets. It was in that central and\r\ncrowded part of the city which is between the church of the Gesù and\r\nthe Farnese palace, a labyrinth of tortuous streets and lanes,\r\nnot often visited by foreigners unless when bent on some special\r\nexpedition of sight-seeing. There are no sidewalks for foot-passengers\r\nin these streets. They are narrow, very tortuous and very crowded.\r\nFoot-passengers and vehicles of all sorts find their way along as best\r\nthey may in one confused mass. It was there I saw the historic pair\r\nof wheels in question. They were attached to the barrow of a\r\ncoster-monger, who was retailing a stock of onions, carrots and\r\n\"cavolo Romano\" which he had just purchased at the neighboring market\r\nof the \"Campo de' Fiori.\" His wares, I fear, had been selected from\r\nthe refuse of the market, and he and his barrow were in a state of\r\ndilapidated shabbiness that matched his stock in trade. But not so the\r\nwheels on which his barrow was supported. They were wheels of the most\r\ngorgeous description. The spokes and the circumference were painted\r\nof the most brilliant scarlet, and the entire nave was gilded so as\r\nto have the appearance of a solid mass of gold. It is impossible to\r\nimagine anything more _bizarre_ than the effect of these magnificent\r\nwheels doing the work of carrying such an equipage. Nevertheless,\r\nthe apparition seemed to attract very little attention in the crowded\r\nstreet. The grand scarlet and gilded wheels flamed along among the\r\ncrowd of shabby men and shabby vehicles with their load of onions and\r\ncabbages, and scarcely anybody turned his head to stare at them. I\r\nsuppose the denizens of the district were used to the apparition of\r\nthem. To me they looked as if they had been the originals from\r\nwhich Guido Reni painted those of the car in which he has placed the\r\ncelebrated Aurora of his world-famous fresco. They were solidly and\r\nheavily built wheels--very barbarous an English carriage-builder would\r\nhave considered them in their heavy and clumsy magnificence--but they\r\nwere very gorgeous. What could be the meaning of their appearance in\r\npublic under such circumstances? I was walking with an Italian friend\r\nat the time, who saw my state of amazement at so strange a phenomenon,\r\nand explained it all by a single remark.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"there go a pair of His Eminence's wheels. They are\r\nsharing the fortunes of their late master in a manner that is at once\r\ndramatic and historical.\"\r\n\r\nThe wheels from a cardinal's carriage! Of course they were. How was\r\nit possible that such wheels should be mistaken for any other in the\r\nworld? A few years ago, when pope and cardinals had not yet suffered\r\nthe horrible eclipse which has overtaken them, one of the most notable\r\nfeatures of the Roman streets and suburban roads used to consist\r\nof the carriages of the members of the Sacred College taking their\r\ndiurnal drive. It was not etiquette for a cardinal to walk in the\r\nstreets, or indeed anywhere else, without his carriage following him.\r\nThere was no mistaking these barbarously gorgeous vehicles. They were\r\nall exactly like each other, and unlike any other carriages to be\r\nseen in the nineteenth century--heavy, clumsy, coarsely built and\r\ngorgeously painted of the most flaming scarlet, and largely gilded.\r\nThey were drawn by long-tailed black horses covered with heavy harness\r\nrichly plated with silver, or something that looked like it, and\r\ndriven by a coachman whose livery, always as shabby as magnificent,\r\nwas as heavily laden with huge masses of worsted lace of the kind that\r\nused to be placed on carriage-linings some five-and-twenty years ago.\r\nTwo similarly bedizened footmen always stood on the monkey-board\r\nat the rear, who descended and walked behind His Eminence and\r\nhis chaplain when the cardinal left his carriage to get his\r\nconstitutional. Ichabod! Ichabod! The glory has departed! Such\r\ncavalcades are no longer to be seen crawling along the Via Appia,\r\nor following His Eminence on a fine and sunny afternoon about four\r\no'clock as he walks on the footpath between the Porta Pia and the\r\nBasilica of St. Agnes in search of an appetite for his dinner. The\r\nworld will never see such carriages and such servants any more. _Fuit\r\nIlium!_ I thought of the old lines on the \"high--mettled racer,\" and\r\nof \"imperial Cæsar, dead and turned to clay, stopping a hole to keep\r\nthe wind away.\" To see such splendor reduced to the service of such\r\nvile uses! Yes, as my Italian friend said, \"There go the cardinal's\r\nwheels,\" and it is impossible not to feel sure that the phenomenon\r\nis symbolical of the way the cardinal is going himself. When an\r\ninstitution, a dignity, a social arrangement of any sort, has grown\r\nto be purely ornamental, has become so splendid that its splendor has\r\ncome to be the essence of it, it will no longer be able to exist shorn\r\nof its splendor, however much it may in its origin have been adapted\r\nfor use rather than for show. The wheels were heavy, cumbrous and\r\nill put together; they were not well adapted for the costermonger's\r\npurpose, and will probably fall to pieces before long. Their fate is\r\na type of that of their once master. That ornamental individual, shorn\r\nof his ornamental character, is useless. His _raison d'être_ is gone\r\nas entirely as Othello's occupation was. And it will probably not be\r\nlong before the fate of the cardinal's wheels overtakes the cardinal\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe second little bit of street incident which recently occurred to me\r\nwas in itself less striking, but seemed to me to symbolize changes of\r\nyet higher moment and wider significance. This time what I saw was in\r\nthe Ghetto. Many of my readers probably know what the Ghetto at Rome\r\nis, but untraveled stayers-at-home may very excusably never have heard\r\nof it. The Ghetto is the Jews' quarter in Rome--the district in which\r\nthey were for many generations compelled to reside and to be locked\r\nin by night, and where from habit the greater part, especially of the\r\npoorer members of the Jewish community, still live. As will be easily\r\nbelieved, it is the worst and most wretched quarter of the city--the\r\nlowest physically as well as morally--and inundated with tolerable\r\ncertainty every year by the rising of the Tiber. The dilapidated and\r\nfilthy streets of the other parts of old papal Rome used to look\r\nclean and spruce by comparison with the lurid and darksome dens of\r\nthe Ghetto. There are Ghettos in London--streets where the children of\r\nIsrael congregate, not in obedience to any law old or new, but drawn\r\ntogether by mutual attraction and similarity of occupation. And the\r\noccupations there are very much of the same nature as those pursued\r\nin the Ghetto of Rome--the buying and selling of old clothes and\r\nsecond-hand property of all sorts, the preparation and distribution of\r\nfried fish, and here and there a little usury. But the _genius loci_\r\nhere impresses on the trade in discarded odds and ends a peculiar\r\ncharacter of its own. A much larger number of old pictures figure\r\namong the hoards of useless \"property\" than would be the case\r\nelsewhere. The constant decay of noble and once wealthy families\r\nfurnishes to the second-hand market a much more abundant supply of\r\nthe remains of articles that were once rich and rare in their day--old\r\ndamask hangings torn from walls that have witnessed the princely\r\nrevelry of many a generation; rich brocades and stuffs that have made\r\npart of the moving pageant in the same saloons; lace of the finest\r\nand rarest from the vestments of deceased prelates, whose heirs, as\r\nregards such property, have probably been their serving-men; purple\r\nand scarlet articles from the wardrobes of cardinals and princes of\r\nthe Church; and odds and ends of various sorts widely different in\r\nkind from aught that could be found in similar repositories in other\r\ncities. And another specialty of the Roman Ghetto is that it is not\r\naltogether easy to obtain a sight of the miscellaneous treasures of\r\nthis rag-fair. Partly because the low-lying and narrow lanes of the\r\nGhetto are too murky and filthy to permit of the advantageous exposure\r\nof the merchandise in question; partly, probably, from an habitual\r\nconsciousness on the part of the dealers that the details of their\r\ntraffic in all its particulars are not of a nature to be safely\r\nsubmitted to the public eye; partly from that secretiveness which is\r\nthe natural result of living for many generations from father to son\r\nunder the tyranny of an alien race, whose bitterly hostile prejudices\r\nwere but little restrained by law or justice; and partly also, no\r\ndoubt, from the genuine Roman laziness, which in its perfection is\r\ncapable of overriding even Jewish keenness of trade,--the Jew brokers\r\nof the Ghetto are often unwilling to show their hidden stores to the\r\nfirst comer. Some amount of diplomacy and some show of the probability\r\nof effecting an advantageous deal must be had recourse to in order to\r\nattain the purpose of the explorer.\r\n\r\nOn the recent occasion to which I have referred these difficulties had\r\nbeen overcome, and I had made my way into the interior of one of\r\nthe dens I have described in the company of a lady friend who is a\r\nconfirmed and irreclaimable lace-hunter, and who in pursuit of her\r\ngame would have confronted worse obstacles than any that we had\r\nto encounter. For, in truth, the exterior appearance and the\r\nentrance-chambers are the worst part of the Ghetto dwellings. One is\r\ncuriously reminded of the old mediæval stories of Jewish dwellings,\r\nwhere the utmost squalor and poverty of exterior was a mere blind for\r\nan interior gorgeous with every manifestation of wealth and luxury. I\r\nwill not say that much of the latter is to be found in the dwellings\r\nof the Ghetto, but a degree of comfortable decency and indications\r\nof the possession of capital may be met with which the exterior\r\nappearances would not have led one to anticipate. Well, we had reached\r\nthe third floor of one of these sinister-looking abodes, conducted by\r\na fat old Jewess with a pair of huge black eyes, a large smooth face\r\nas yellow as a guinea, and a vast development of bust clad in dirty\r\nwhite wrappers of some sort. A door on the landing-place jealously\r\nlocked with two huge keys admitted us into a suite of three good-sized\r\nrooms crammed from floor to ceiling with a collection of articles more\r\nheterogeneous than can easily be conceived--far more so than can be\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nThose who have ever accompanied a lady lace-hunter when she has struck\r\na promising trail know that the business in hand is likely to be a\r\nsomewhat long one. My companion on the present occasion very soon\r\nconvinced the Jewess that she knew quite as much about the matter as\r\nshe, the dealer, did. But I presume that some of the old yellow stores\r\nproduced were \"the real thing;\" for my friend and the old Jewess soon\r\nbecame immersed in an eager and, as it seemed to me interminable,\r\ndiscussion as to qualities, condition and values. Meantime, I had to\r\namuse myself as best I might by looking at the multifarious objects.\r\nI must content myself with mentioning one article, the appearance\r\nof which in such a place struck me as strange and not a little\r\nsignificant. It was simply an old parasol, very much faded and a\r\nlittle tattered, but not such a parasol as your fair hands ever\r\ncarried, my dear madam, nor such as the once equally fair hands of any\r\ngeneration of your ancestors ever carried. The article in question was\r\nmore like the shelter which we see represented in Chinese paintings as\r\ncarried over the heads of persons of high rank among the Celestials.\r\nIt was very large, not much curved into the shape of a dome when\r\nexpanded, very clumsily and coarsely put together, but of gorgeous\r\nmagnificence of material. It was made of a very thick and rich damask\r\nsilk, additionally ornamented by embroidery in gold and silver thread,\r\nand the handle and points of the supports were richly gilt. In a word,\r\nI perceived at once, not being a novice in such matters, that the\r\narticle before me was one of the canopies used for holding over the\r\n\"Host\" when the holy sacrament is carried by the priest through the\r\nstreets to a dying person. It needs but a moment's reflection on the\r\nRoman Catholic theory of the sacrament of the \"Last Supper\" to be\r\naware of the extremely sacred nature of the uses to which this parasol\r\nhad been put, and of the associations connected with it. Nevertheless,\r\nI found this bit of sacred church property in the hands of a Jew\r\nbroker, exposed to sale for a few francs to the first comer, heretic,\r\nscoffer or infidel, that might take a fancy to buy it. This would\r\nhardly have been the case when the pope was absolute master of Rome\r\nand of all in it. The thing could not have happened save by the\r\ndishonesty and cynical disbelief of some priest, and indeed probably\r\nof more than one. And, upon the whole, it struck me as a second\r\ncurious indication of the somewhat breakneck speed with which the\r\nthreads of history are spinning themselves in these days and in these\r\nlatitudes.\r\n\r\nT.A.T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA great deal of discussion has recently taken place on the subject of\r\nmedical education in the United States. To a foreigner, or to one not\r\nacquainted with the influences that have led to and have kept up this\r\ndiscussion, it might seem to be the result of a spontaneous outburst\r\nof popular feeling, earnestly demanding much-needed progress. Really,\r\nhowever, the very reverse is the case; and the revolutionists are\r\nthose whose _kind_ and _sympathetic_ interest in the welfare of the\r\ncommunity is prompted solely by selfish considerations. The changes\r\nurged by these self-condemning philanthropists are not demanded by the\r\nmedical profession nor by the public; neither have they been, nor will\r\nthey be, sustained by both or by either. This assertion is clearly\r\nproved by the experience of the University of Pennsylvania, In 1846\r\nthe American Medical Association recommended to all medical colleges\r\ncertain changes and improvements in their courses of instruction.\r\nIn consequence of this recommendation the University of Pennsylvania\r\nextended its session to six months: not a _single medical college in\r\nthe country followed_ its progressive lead, and after continuing the\r\nexperiment for six years at great pecuniary loss, it was reluctantly\r\nobliged to retrace its steps, and to return to the old standard as to\r\nlength of session. During the period of this advance the classes of\r\nthe University fell off greatly, and the classes of other medical\r\nschools correspondingly increased. Even medical men sent their sons\r\nto other medical schools, to save the time and money necessary for the\r\nlonger course. Indeed, medical men, as a rule, have sought to evade\r\nthe restrictions as to length of time of study, etc. more than any\r\nother class; and the statement, that the \"student usually dates his\r\nmedical studies from the time he buys his first _Chemistry_\" applies\r\nmore frequently to the sons of _physicians_ than to any others. Hence,\r\nI declare that these proposed changes are not demanded by the medical\r\nprofession nor by the public.\r\n\r\nThe writer of a recent article in _Lippincott's Magazine_ (Dr. H.C.\r\nWood) on \"Medical Education in the United States\" seems to have\r\nbeen so lost in admiration at the methods of instruction followed in\r\nEuropean medical colleges as to be utterly blind to the good in the\r\nsystem of medical education as it exists in this country--a system the\r\n_necessary_ result of our political, social, financial and territorial\r\nconditions; a system which, though in the abstract may not be the\r\nbest, is certainly, judging from its results, the best _possible_\r\nunder our peculiar circumstances. This much abused system of\r\nmedical education (only greatly improved in its extent and\r\nthoroughness--improvements developed by the constant advances in\r\nknowledge) is the same system which has produced the great medical\r\nmen of the United States during the past seventy-five years--medical\r\npractitioners whose success has been surpassed by none in Europe;\r\nsurgeons whose skill has been, and is, world-wide in reputation;\r\nauthors whose works are standard authorities everywhere. It is the\r\nsame system of medical instruction--I quote verbatim (italics mine)\r\nfrom this article that holds it up to scorn--which \"accomplished such\r\n_splendid results_ during the late rebellion.\" The writer says: \"The\r\ngreat resources of the medical profession were proved during the\r\ncivil war, when there was created in a few months a service which\r\nfor magnitude and efficiency has rarely if ever been equaled. Indeed,\r\nmilitary medicine was raised by it to a point _never reached before\r\nthat time in Europe_ and the results achieved have, in many points,\r\n_worked a revolution in science_.\" After this frank declaration of the\r\ninestimable value and glorious results of American medical education,\r\nthe writer draws the _logical_(?) sequence that it (American medical\r\neducation) is responsible for a case of most heartrending malpractice,\r\nwhich he relates, compared to which the Japanese hari-kari were\r\nmerciful mildness, and approaching more nearly the tortures by\r\ncrucifixion as administered by this same _kind-hearted_ people. With\r\nabout as much reason and justice might he conclude that the _American\r\nsystem_ of Sunday-school education is lamentably inferior to that of\r\nGreat Britain, _because_(!) Jesse Pomeroy was a possibility in that\r\nmost respectable town of Boston.\r\n\r\nDr. Wood alludes to the ignorance of the American medical student,\r\nand makes a statement \"not founded on the authority of official\r\npublication,\" in which he endeavors to show that from \"six to ten\r\nper cent.\" of American medical students have an ignorance of vulgar\r\nfractions and rudimentary astronomy that would exclude them from an\r\nordinary infant-school. Every one familiar with the students attending\r\nour first-class American medical colleges knows perfectly well that\r\nin origin and in culture they compare favorably with the young men\r\nengaged in the study of law and divinity, or with those entering upon\r\nmercantile or manufacturing pursuits. True, there are some imperfectly\r\neducated, but certainly not \"six or ten per cent.\" destitute of\r\nthat knowledge taught even in _American_ infant-schools, and without\r\nknowing, and without the statement \"being founded on the authority of\r\nany official publication,\" I _infer_ that in _Europe_, owing to their\r\n\"better methods,\" similar knowledge is communicated to the average\r\nEuropean child many months _before its birth_.\r\n\r\nNext follows a comment on the poverty of the American medical student.\r\nDr. Wood says: \"Even worse than this, however, is the fact that the\r\nsummer between the winter courses is often not spent in study, but\r\nin idleness, or, not rarely, in acquiring in the school-room or\r\nharvest-field the pecuniary means of spending the subsequent winter in\r\nthe city.\" Alas! this _is_ too true. Providence seems to have ordained\r\nthat our young _American_ doctors are not always reared in the lap of\r\nluxury and wealth as the fittest preparation for the trials, hardships\r\nand self-denials of their future lives. It is also true that some\r\n_other_ young American professional men have been compelled \"in the\r\nschool-room or harvest-field\" to acquire the means to prosecute their\r\nprofessional studies. Daniel Webster, the son of a New England farmer,\r\ntaught school at Fryeburg, Maine, \"upon a salary of about one dollar\r\nper diem.\" \"His salary was all saved ... as a fund for his _own\r\nprofessional_ education and to help his brother through college.\"\r\n\"During his residence at Fryeburg, Mr. Webster borrowed (he was too\r\npoor to buy) Blackstone's _Commentaries_.\" Mr. Webster's great rival,\r\nHenry Clay, also was compelled to resort to the \"school-room and\r\nharvest-field to obtain the pecuniary means,\" etc. etc. etc. The son\r\nof the poor widow with seven children \"applied himself to the labor of\r\nthe field with alacrity and diligence;\" \"and there yet live those who\r\nremember to have seen him oftentimes riding his sorry horse, with a\r\nrope bridle, no saddle, and a bag of grain.\" \"By the familiar name\r\nof the Mill-boy of the Slashes do these men ... perpetuate the\r\nremembrance of his lowly yet dutiful and unrepining employments.\"\r\nAmerican biography is so filled with similar instances, showing how\r\nthe great characters of her great men acquired their development and\r\nstrength in the stern gymnasium of poverty, even in \"the school-room\r\nand harvest-field,\" that I could fill volumes with the glowing\r\nrecords. The youngest American school-boy recognizes Abraham Lincoln\r\nand Henry Wilson in this _American_ galaxy. Whose heart has not been\r\nstirred by the life-story of the great Hugh Miller, the stonecutter's\r\npick earning for him humble means, thereby enabling him to acquire\r\nthat learning which made his name a household word even in America.\r\nTruth, then, as I have remarked, obliges me to admit that we have in\r\nour medical colleges some young men who labor \"in harvest-fields and\r\nschool-rooms\" in order that they may honorably pay their way, rather\r\nthan eat the bread or accept the gratuities of pauperism.\r\n\r\nLast March there graduated at the medical department of the University\r\nof Pennsylvania one of these self-supporting young men. He was the son\r\nof a missionary clergyman: the father was poor in pocket, but the son\r\nwas not poor in spirit. During the interval between his winter courses\r\nof lectures, rather than be a burden to his father, rather than accept\r\ngratuitous instruction from the school, he went into the coal regions\r\nof Pennsylvania and worked in a coal-mine, as a common miner, to\r\nprocure funds to enable him to complete his professional studies;\r\nand, _strange_ as it may seem, this young miner passed an excellent\r\nexamination, and received the unanimous vote of the medical faculty\r\nfor his degree. I mention this case, but every year there are several\r\nsimilar; and we always find that the school-teachers and miners are by\r\nno means at the foot of the graduating class.\r\n\r\nConcerning clinical teaching, we have the following statement:\r\n\"The clinical teaching in an American hospital is comprised in the\r\nfollowing routine: Once or twice a week, from one to five hundred men\r\nbeing congregated in an amphitheatre, the professor lectures upon a\r\ncase brought into the arena, perhaps operates, and when the hour has\r\nexpired the class is dismissed. Evidently, under such circumstances\r\nthere cannot be the training of the senses, the acquiring of a\r\nknowledge of the hourly play of symptoms of disease and of familiarity\r\nwith the proper handling of the sick and wounded, which is of such\r\nvital importance, and which can be the outcome only of daily contact\r\nwith patients.\" What can the writer of this sentence mean? Certainly,\r\nno one knows better than he does that such _is not_ the practice in\r\nthe hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, in Bellevue and in\r\nmany other large hospitals, where clinics and dispensary services\r\nare held for _several hours daily_ throughout the year, and where the\r\nstudent has furnished him abundant opportunities four \"acquiring a\r\nknowledge of the ... symptoms of disease, ... of handling the sick and\r\nwounded,\" etc. etc. That the American medical student profits by these\r\nopportunities, and learns his clinic lessons well, is proved by the\r\nunexpected and evidently unintended testimony which occurs toward the\r\nclose of the article, where Dr. Wood says, \"The great resources of the\r\nmedical profession in America were proved during the civil war, when\r\nthere was created in a _few months_ a service which for _magnitude_\r\nand _efficiency_ has _rarefy if ever been equaled_. Indeed, military\r\nmedicine was raised by it to a point _never reached before_ that time\r\n_in Europe_, and the results achieved have in many points worked a\r\n_revolution in science_.\" The italics in this quotation are mine, as\r\nthey also are in those which follow.\r\n\r\nBut (says the article under review) \"the largest proportion of our\r\nprominent physicians have educated themselves after graduation.\" As\r\nif this were an extraordinary or unusual circumstance! Certainly,\r\nthey have; and so have all prominent men in all professions and all\r\npursuits of life, in every age and every country, not even excepting\r\nthe much-lauded men of Great Britain and the continent of Europe. What\r\nyoung lawyer is entrusted with an important cause immediately after\r\nadmission to the Bar? And as the young doctor (according to the\r\naforesaid showing) \"gains his first practical knowledge while serving\r\nas a hospital resident, under the supervision of experienced men,\"\r\nso the young lawyer, _even in Great Britain_, must gain _his_ first\r\npractical knowledge by constant attention at the courts, and by\r\ndiligently following the proceedings of his preceptor's and other\r\noffices. Even the young clergyman, whose business it is to save\r\n_souls_, has to do very much as the young doctor does, and, like him,\r\nis often \"thrown at once on his own resources, gaining his experience\r\nwithout supervision, and at the _expense_ of the _poorer classes_,\r\nwho _naturally_ fall to his charge, and whose ignorance precludes them\r\nfrom an even approximately correct estimate of\" his fitness. \"It is\r\none of the saddest features of our system that the famed skill of our\r\nbest\" _(clergymen)_ \"should so often be acquired at such a cost.\"\r\n\r\nWhat can be more unphilosophical and illogical than to compare the\r\nyoung doctor, or any other young professional man, to a new piece of\r\nmachinery, fresh from the manufactory, complete and perfect in all\r\nits parts? And yet something like this is _attempted_ in the article\r\nbefore us. Even as Minerva sprang from the brain of Jove the complete\r\nand perfect goddess of learning, so would our Utopian writer have\r\nthe young doctors to come from the brains of their medical professors\r\ncomplete and perfect; only, if his idea be correct, their medical\r\nprofessors have so little brains that the annual graduating medical\r\nclasses of the United States would be immediately reduced from\r\nthe frightful army of three thousand \"legalized murderers\" to the\r\ncomparatively small and easily counted number of _one graduate_ (of\r\ncourse, springing from one head). No; the young doctor, at graduation,\r\ncannot be compared to a new, complete and perfect machine fresh from\r\nthe manufactory; rather, let him be compared to the young marsupial\r\ncreature at birth, extremely rudimentary, whose natural, and hence\r\nfittest, place is the parental pouch, but which in due time becomes\r\nthe vigorous and well-developed specimen. I suppose, if I compare\r\nthe young doctor to the young marsupial, I should also say that _his_\r\nprotecting parental pouch, in which he acquires growth and vigor, is\r\nthe hospital where he goes after graduation, or the practice which he\r\nsees under his preceptor's supervision.\r\n\r\nThe article continues: \"The remarks which follow do not apply to\r\nthe medical department of Harvard College or to _one or two other\r\nschools_\" (the italics are mine); and farther on it continues: \"In\r\nother words, Harvard has copied the European plan of medical teaching\r\nin some of its essential features, and as a consequence its medical\r\ndiploma is the _only one_ issued by _any prominent medical American_\r\ncollege which is a _guarantee_ that its possessor has been well\r\neducated in the science and practice of medicine.\" Where can we\r\nfind meekness and modesty like this?--modesty as becoming as it\r\nis unexpected and surprising, seeing that the writer fills _two_\r\nprofessorships in the University of Pennsylvania, Does he hang his\r\nhead so low in his--I was about to say _singular_--self-abasement\r\n(but, considering, the _two_ professorships, I suppose I should say\r\n_doubled_ self-abasement) that he cannot see? or are his eyes so\r\nblinded by the effulgence of \"Harvard\" and \"European\" plans that he\r\nfails to recognize and appreciate the immense advantages offered by\r\nhis own home institutions? I do not propose to make any invidious\r\nremarks concerning Harvard, but I maintain that an _honest_ and _just_\r\ncomparison of the schools, of their requirements, of the character of\r\ntheir teachings and the facilities they furnish their students, _must_\r\nshow that modesty alone prevented Professor \"H.C. Wood, Jr., M.D.,\"\r\nalso excepting from his sweeping denunciations the two great schools\r\nof Philadelphia, though I only speak for and defend the medical\r\ndepartment of the University of Pennsylvania from an attack unjust,\r\nuncalled-for and untrue.\r\n\r\nR.A.F. PENROSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe party opposed to any reforms in medical education has, of course,\r\na right to be heard, and Dr. Penrose is well entitled to represent it\r\nboth by his position and by the evident heartiness with which he is\r\nprepared to defend the existing system at every point. In impugning\r\nthe motives of those who have attacked it he lays himself open to an\r\nobvious retort; but it is sufficient to remark that the contest is\r\nnot of a nature to call for or justify the use of personalities, which\r\ncould serve only to divert attention from the real issues.\r\n\r\nThe arguments put forward by Dr. Penrose may be summarized as follows:\r\n1st, that the proposed changes are not demanded either by the public\r\nor by the profession; 2d, that the present system is the best possible\r\nin a nation constituted like ours; 3d, that the preparatory education\r\nof our medical students is equal to that of law or divinity students,\r\nor of young men entering upon mercantile or manufacturing pursuits;\r\n4th, that in certain cases obstacles in the way of a regular and\r\nthorough training have been overcome and success achieved in spite of\r\nthem; and 5th, that it is unavoidable and proper that medical men, as\r\nwell as members of other professions, should educate themselves after\r\ngraduation.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that none of these arguments except the last,\r\nwhich is based on a mere verbal ambiguity, touches the two subjects\r\ndiscussed in Dr. Wood's article--namely, the _need_ of reform and the\r\n_methods_ by which, if practicable, it is to be effected. Dr. Penrose\r\ndoes not venture to assert that the existing system is perfect, or\r\nto deny that the suggested changes are in the nature of improvements.\r\nWhat he wishes us to believe is that the system, whatever its defects,\r\nis as good a one as Americans have a right to demand, and that it is\r\nso closely interwoven with our political and social institutions as to\r\nadmit of no separate handling. Similar arguments are frequently urged\r\nagainst the desire to raise the standard and widen the avenues of the\r\n\"higher education.\" We are thus taught to regard ourselves as a poor\r\nand struggling nation with no claim to the possession of intellectual\r\nluxuries, or as having bound ourselves to forego any aspirations to an\r\nequality with other nations in respect of culture when we secured the\r\nadvantages of popular government and its social concomitants. It would\r\nseem, however, to be a sounder, as it is certainly a more gratifying\r\nbelief, that precisely because we have attained these advantages\r\nit will be easier for us to appropriate all the benefits which\r\ncivilization has to offer--possible for us to make more rapid strides\r\nthan have been made by other nations, impeded by a diversity of\r\ninterests and conflicts between the government and the people. No\r\ndoubt the comparative youthfulness of the nation will account for\r\nour backward condition in certain respects; but surely it is time to\r\nabandon this and every similar plea as an argument against any attempt\r\nat progress.\r\n\r\nWe have not space, and for the reasons indicated we see no necessity,\r\nto discuss Dr. Penrose's positions in detail. It will be sufficient\r\nto notice generally what seems to us their inherent weakness. His\r\nassertion that no changes are _now_ demanded by the public or the\r\nprofession is, he thinks, \"clearly proved\" by the fact that thirty\r\nyears ago some that were introduced in the University of Pennsylvania\r\nat the suggestion of the American Medical Association ended in\r\nfailure. But what this experience really proves is, that the defects\r\nof the system were even then admitted, while the remedies are still to\r\nbe applied. At Harvard this has been done; and the question for other\r\nmedical schools is whether they are to follow the example or to\r\nbe deterred by a bugbear--whether, for example, the University of\r\nPennsylvania, after raising her scientific and art departments to\r\na higher level, shall be content to let her medical school remain\r\nstationary. It is the opinion of intelligent physicians who are not\r\nparties to this controversy that the experiment which failed in 1846\r\nwould succeed now. The new plan adopted at Harvard, which exacts\r\nthree years of study, and embraces lectures, recitations, clinical\r\nconferences and written examinations of the most stringent character,\r\nhas, we are informed, attracted a class of very superior men. Compared\r\nwith the effort made here in 1846, this change may be described as a\r\nrevolution, and it has proved a success.\r\n\r\nWe are at a loss to understand what Dr. Penrose wishes to prove by his\r\ncitation of cases in which eminence has been reached--chiefly, it\r\nis to be noticed, in politics or the law--by persons who have\r\nhad insufficient opportunities for study. If the disadvantage was\r\nimaginary, where was the merit of overcoming it? If it was real, as\r\nmost people would admit, what is the objection to insisting on it as\r\nsuch? In the great majority of cases it is _not_ overcome, and the\r\nresult is, that the country is overstocked with men engaged in the\r\npractice of professions for which they are inadequately qualified. As\r\nto the skill that is gained by practice, the ripe knowledge that may\r\nresult from experience, this cannot without a confusion of terms\r\nbe described as \"education.\" It will in general be most surely and\r\nrapidly acquired by those who have received the best training, and\r\nthe great object of our higher educational institutions should be\r\nto provide such training--not, by maintaining a low standard, to\r\nfacilitate the efforts of those who, from whatever cause, would find\r\nit difficult to meet the demands of a higher one. Such persons may\r\nhave a claim to encouragement and assistance in their endeavors to\r\nreach the mark; but they have no right to expect that the distance\r\nshall be regulated to suit their convenience.\r\n\r\nDr. Wood's admissions in regard to the excellence of the army medical\r\nservice during the war are seized upon with natural exultation by his\r\nopponent, who draws from them a legitimate inference in favor of the\r\ngeneral status of medical skill and knowledge throughout the country.\r\nIf Dr. Wood really intended to say--what his language, we confess,\r\nwould seem to imply--that the service attained its high state of\r\nefficiency in a few months, we do not well see how he is to resist the\r\nconclusion thus pressed upon him. But we conceive the truth to be that\r\neither his phraseology or his recollection of the facts was at fault.\r\nIt is well known that at the beginning of the war it was impossible to\r\nfind competent surgeons in anything like the number that was\r\nneeded, and that the examining boards were consequently forced to be\r\nridiculously lenient. We know of an able surgeon who after a battle\r\nfound that he had not a single assistant in his corps who could be\r\ntrusted to perform an operation. This state of matters was the direct\r\nresult of the imperfect education given in the schools. Not one man in\r\nten who leaves them has ever been practically exercised in operations\r\non the cadaver, and the proportion was still smaller before the war.\r\nIt is easy therefore to understand, while it would be painful to\r\nrecall, the circumstances under which the great bulk of our army\r\nsurgeons acquired the requisite proficiency. The ultimate success\r\nof our medical service, like the final triumph of our armies, was\r\npreceded by many woeful blunders and mishaps, and, like that, was due\r\nin great measure to a lavish outlay which would scarcely have been\r\npossible in any European war, and to the general devotion and united\r\nefforts which drew out all the resources of the country, of whatever\r\nkind, and directed them to the furtherance of a single aim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR EARLY NEWSPAPERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn looking over the contents of the old newspapers of this country, of\r\nwhich there was a considerable number as early as the year 1730, one\r\nis specially struck by the number of advertisements of slave sales and\r\nof runaway slaves, apprentices and servants. The following are common\r\nexamples:\r\n\r\n\"To be sold, a very likely Negro woman about 30 years of Age, has been\r\nin this city about 10. She is a fine Cook, has been brought up to all\r\nsorts of House Work, and speaks very good English. She has had the\r\nsmall Pox, and has now a Young Child.

Instant from John Bell of the city of New York\r\nCarpenter, an Apprentice Boy named James Harding, aged about 19 years,\r\nbeing a tall well-set Lad of a Fresh Complexion, he wears a Wig, he\r\nis spley-footed and shuffles with his feet as he Walks, has a Copper\r\ncoloured Kersey Coat with large flat white Mettle Buttons, a grey\r\nDuroy Coat lined with Silk, it is pretty much faded by wearing, a\r\nbroad blue striped Waistcoat and Breeches and a pair of blue striped\r\nTickin Breeches, in warm weather he often bleeds at the nose.\"\r\nThen follows the offer of forty shillings to any one who will give\r\ninformation whereby his master, John Bell, can regain possession of\r\nthe runaway.\r\n\r\nThat the women of that time were strong-minded, or at least that they\r\nwere disposed to assist in the reformation of bad husbands, is shown\r\nby the following from the same journal, date December 31, 1733. The\r\nsubject, or victim, was one William Drinkwater, living near New York,\r\nwho had proved quarrelsome with his neighbors and abusive to his wife:\r\n\"The good Women of the Place took the Matter into Consideration and\r\nlaid hold of an Opportunity, to get him tied to a Cart, and there with\r\nRods belaboured him on his Back, till, in striveing to get away, he\r\npulled one of his Arms out of Joint, and then they unti'd him. Mr.\r\n_Drinkwater_ Complained to Sundrie Magistrates of this useage, but all\r\nhe got by it was to be Laughed at; Whereupon he removed to New Milford\r\nwhere we hear he proves a good Neighhour and a loving Husband. _A\r\nRemarkable Reformation ariseing from the Justice of the good Women._\"\r\n\r\nAnother advertisement indicates a toilet article now out of fashion:\r\n\r\n\"To be Sold by _Peter Lynch_, near Mr. _Rutgers_ Brewhouse, very good\r\nOrange Butter, it is excellent for Gentlewomen to comb up their Hair\r\nwith, it also cures Children's sore Heads.\"\r\n\r\nThe next sounds quite as odd:\r\n\r\n\"_James Munden_ Partner with _Thomas Butwell_ from London, Maketh\r\nGentlewomens Stays and Childrens Coats in the Newest Fashion, that\r\nCrooked Women and Children will appear strait,\" Same paper, date\r\nFebruary, 1735.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that the deaths at that time, both in the New\r\nYork and New England papers, were announced not by the names of the\r\ndeceased, but by the churches to which they belonged. For example:\r\n\"Buried in the city last week, _viz._, Church of England 26, Dutch 24,\r\nLutheran 2, French 1, Presbyterians 3. The number of Blacks we\r\nrefer till Next Week.\"--_New England Weekly Journal_, Nov. 1, 1731.\r\nSometimes the number is recorded as four or five, or even less:\r\ntherefore the record must be very imperfect, and there seems to have\r\nbeen no notice taken of those who were not buried from any church.\r\n\r\nM.H.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE OF THE DAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Dante and his Circle; with the Italian Poets preceding him.\r\n    Edited and translated in the original Metres by Dante Gabriel\r\n    Rossetti. Revised and rearranged edition, Boston: Roberts\r\n    Bros.\r\n\r\nDante is so great a figure in Italian literature that he hides from\r\nsight the host of minor poets who preceded him, and throws his own\r\ncontemporaries so into the shade that we are apt to think that Italian\r\npoetry began with him, and that its second exponent is Petrarch. Such\r\na view is to be regretted, not only because it overlooks much that\r\nis in itself valuable, but because it attributes to a period of\r\nslow development a phenomenal character. There were many poets worth\r\nlistening to before the great Florentine wrote the _New Life_ or the\r\n_Divine Comedy_, and many whom he listened to and praised, although\r\nhis prophetic foresight told him that he would one day bear their\r\nglory from them.\r\n\r\nIt was to make us acquainted with these forgotten singers that Mr.\r\nRossetti wrote some years ago his charming book. _The Early Italian\r\nPoets_, which, after being long out of print, he now presents to us in\r\na revised and rearranged edition. The author's wish is not merely to\r\ngive us a glimpse of the quaint conceits of a school that continued in\r\nItaly the waning influence of the Troubadours, but to open to us the\r\nintimate social life of the literary men of that period as reflected\r\nin their vague Platonic rhapsodies, their friendly letters, their\r\njests and quarrels, their joy and sadness. Interwoven with all this\r\nare stately _canzoni_, and dainty sonnets full of quaint conceits,\r\nlike that wherein Jacopo da Lentino (1250) sings _Of his Lady in\r\nHeaven_:\r\n\r\n  I have it in my heart to serve God so\r\n  That into Paradise I shall repair--\r\n  The holy place through the which everywhere\r\n  I have heard say that joy and solace flow.\r\n  Without my lady I were loath to go--\r\n  She who has the bright face and the bright hair--\r\n  Because if she were absent, I being there,\r\n  My pleasure would be less than naught, I know.\r\n  Look you, I say not this to such intent\r\n  As that I there would deal in any sin:\r\n  I only would behold her gracious mien,\r\n  And beautiful soft eyes, and lovely face,\r\n  That so it should be my complete content\r\n  To see my lady joyful in her place.\r\n\r\nWe seem, in turning over these pages, to see the brilliant,\r\never-changing current of Italian thirteenth and fourteenth century\r\nlife--from Palermo, where Frederick II. held an almost Oriental\r\ncourt, to the communes of Central Italy, the best type of which is\r\nthe merchant-city of the Arno, whose sons in those days could fight as\r\nwell as wield the yardstick, and sing in strains that have rarely\r\nbeen equaled. In the first division of the work the great poet and his\r\nfriends are brought vividly before us from the time when, a sensitive\r\nchild, his eyes first beheld Beatrice and his new life began, to the\r\npainful hours of bereavement and exile. The poet, it is known, made\r\na curious sonnet out of a dream he had after his first meeting with\r\nBeatrice, and, in accordance with the fashion of the day, sent it to\r\nvarious well-known poets, asking them to interpret his vision. The\r\nanswers are all given here; and among those whose attention was thus\r\nattracted to the precocious youth was one whom he calls his \"first\r\nfriend,\" Guido Cavalcanti--after Dante one of the most interesting\r\nliterary personages of the day. Rash and chivalrous, we can follow him\r\nin his poems from the time he made his pilgrimage to the shrine of St.\r\nJames, and fell in love on the way with Mandetta of Toulouse, to the\r\nturbulent days of Florentine party strife, when he rides down Messer\r\nCorso Donati, \"the baron,\" and wounds him with his javelin, and then\r\ngoes into exile at Sarzana, where he sings his dying song and sends\r\nit to his lady, \"who,\" he says, \"of her noble grace shall show thee\r\ncourtesy.\" All the poets were not as constant as their own lines\r\nwould have us believe. Dante reproaches the famous Cino da Pistoja\r\nfor fickleness, and the latter confesses the charge, and declares he\r\ncannot get \"free from Love's pitiless aim.\" Guido Cavalcanti rebukes\r\nDante himself for his way of life after the death of Beatrice; and\r\nthis valuable sonnet should be read in connection with the beautiful\r\npassage in the _Purgatory_ (xxx. 55-75) where Beatrice herself\r\nupbraids the tearful poet.\r\n\r\nIn the second part, comprising _Poets chiefly before Dante_, we have\r\nspecimens of the Sicilian school--a _canzone_ by the great Frederick,\r\nand a sonnet by his luckless son Enzo, who died in prison at Bologna\r\nafter a confinement of nearly twenty-three years. Of more importance\r\nare the poems of Guido Guinicelli, of which the philosophical one\r\nentitled \"Of the Gentle Heart\" was a nine days' wonder, but which,\r\neven in Rossetti's elegant version, seems cold and formal. The\r\nmost natural and pleasing pieces among much that is artificial and\r\nconventional are a ballad and two \"catches\" by Sacchetti, who died\r\njust after 1400, and properly does not belong to Dante's circle.\r\nMr. Rossetti's readers will, however, be grateful to him for his\r\ndelightful versions of the two catches, one \"On a Fine Day,\" the other\r\n\"On a Wet Day,\" giving the experiences of a band of young girls who\r\nhave gone to spend the afternoon in the fields and are overtaken by a\r\nshower.\r\n\r\nPoems like these, unfortunately, are rare. The range is a limited\r\none--Platonic love in its conventional form, or the still more\r\nconventional form of chivalric love, imported bodily from the\r\nTroubadours. Scattered here and there are some noble poems; as, for\r\ninstance, the one attributed to Fazio degli Uberti on his lady's\r\nportrait, which begins--\r\n\r\n  I look at the crisp golden-threaded hair,\r\n  Whereof, to thrall my heart, Love twists a net;\r\n  Using at times a string of pearls for bait,\r\n  And sometimes with a single rose therein.\r\n\r\nMr. Rossetti has performed his task in a way to deserve the warmest\r\npraise. The difficulties he has overcome are very great, consisting\r\nnot merely of intricate rhyme and assonance, which he has faithfully\r\nreproduced, but a text often corrupt and meaning often obscure.\r\nHe says himself in his preface that \"The life-blood of rhythmical\r\ntranslation is this commandment--that a good poem shall not be turned\r\ninto a bad one;\" and this commandment, as far as we can see, he has\r\nnot broken in a single case, while in some instances, we are bold\r\nenough to say, the translation is better than the original.\r\n\r\n    History of the Army of the Cumberland, its Organization,\r\n    Campaigns and Battles. Written at the request of Maj.-Gen.\r\n    George H. Thomas, chiefly from his private military journal\r\n    and other official documents furnished by him. By Thomas B.\r\n    Van Horne, U.S. Army. Illustrated with campaign and\r\n    battle maps compiled by Edward Ruger, late Superintendent\r\n    Topographical Engineer Office, Head quarters Department of the\r\n    Cumberland. 2 vols. and atlas. Cincinnati: Robert Clarke & Co.\r\n\r\nIt was natural that General Thomas should make choice of some one to\r\nwhom he could entrust the task of writing his military history. For\r\nthat purpose he chose Mr. T.B. Van Home, a chaplain in the regular\r\narmy, and the work, which was begun in 1865 and finished in 1872, was\r\nsubject to Thomas's own examination. The result is now, after this\r\nlong delay, presented to the public in a shape that does great credit\r\nto the publishers, whose imprint is almost synonymous with good\r\nworkmanship. Of the literary skill, or want of it, on the part of the\r\nauthor not much need be said: he is evidently zealous in his anxiety\r\nto do honor to the memory of General Thomas, and to do justice to all\r\nwho served with him; but he is sadly lacking in the art of suitably\r\nclothing his ideas with fitting words, and much of his elaborate\r\ncomposition is badly wasted in trying to find extravagant language\r\nfor the recital of important events. In some cases, where the official\r\nreports printed at the close of each chapter recite in simple words\r\nthe actual occurrences, the text of the book is overlaid with unusual\r\nwords and involved sentences, in which the statement of the same facts\r\nis lost in a cloud of phraseology of a very curious and original kind.\r\n\"Primal success,\" \"the expression of a stride,\" \"the belligerence of\r\nthe two armies,\" \"philosophy of the victory,\" \"palpable co-operation,\"\r\n\"the expression of an insurrection,\"--these are some of the odd\r\ninventions of the author; and for instances of passages just as odd,\r\nbut too long for citation, we refer to the description of the battle\r\nof Shiloh--a weak imitation of Kinglake's worst style--where we\r\nare told that \"change is the prophecy of unexpected conditions.\"\r\nFortunately, the second volume is much less marred by such faults, and\r\nthe great event of Thomas's career, the battle of Nashville, is told\r\nwith clearness and in full detail.\r\n\r\nAlthough Thomas is the hero of the book from the time when he took\r\ncommand at Camp Dick Robinson in August of 1861, it was not till\r\nOctober, 1863, which brings us to page 394 of the first volume, that\r\nhe succeeded to the command of the Army of the Cumberland, after\r\nRosecrans, who had followed Buell and Sherman and Anderson. Under the\r\nother generals Thomas had served with marked ability and fidelity, and\r\nhis dealing with them is fairly reflected by the author of this work,\r\nfor he rarely criticises either of Thomas's commanding officers--for\r\nthe most part merely records the operations of the army, and puts in\r\nmost prominence Thomas's own services, just as his military journal no\r\ndoubt supplied the material. Of all that long and dreary marching and\r\ncountermarching through Kentucky and Tennessee the account is full and\r\nclear, and we find Buell and Halleck saying that they know nothing of\r\nany plan of campaign in the very midst of their operations. At last\r\nwith Halleck, and still more with Grant in authority, there were\r\nmovements ordered that had some relation to each other and a general\r\nplan of operations, and then the overwhelming strength of the North\r\nbegan to turn the scale. Thomas was called on by Rosecrans, as he had\r\nbeen by Buell, for advice, but he was obliged to act independently\r\ntoo; and then, as at Stone River, he showed an energy and a capacity\r\nthat ought to have secured his earlier promotion. At Chickamauga he\r\nwas actually left in command by Rosecrans, and while the latter\r\nwas looking for new help elsewhere, Thomas at the front saved the\r\nshattered army and led it safely back to Chattanooga, where it\r\nunderwent its famous long siege. The measures for its relief were\r\nplanned by Rosecrans, approved by Grant, and executed by Thomas, with\r\nlarge assistance from \"Baldy\" Smith, whose skill as an engineer was\r\nfully attested then. When Thomas did at last succeed to the command\r\nof the Army of the Cumberland, he showed his superiority to his\r\npredecessors by marked improvement in his method of securing supplies,\r\nin his use of cavalry, and in the increased efficiency of his\r\ninfantry. When Johnston, thanks to Davis's unwise interference with\r\nthe Confederate armies, gave way to Hood, the latter almost at once\r\ngave token of his inferior skill by being defeated by the Army of the\r\nCumberland--by less than half of it, in fact--in an attack intended to\r\ndestroy three armies of more than five times the number of the Union\r\nforce actually engaged. Thomas was in command at this battle of\r\nPeach-tree Creek, one of the sharpest and most significant actions\r\nof the campaign, though no official report is found at the end of\r\nthe chapter in which it is described. The events that led up to the\r\nvictory of Nashville are always worth the telling, and the account\r\ngiven in this work may be looked upon as in some respects Thomas's own\r\nversion of them. A brief chapter by Colonel Merrill of the Engineers\r\ngives a very good description of three of the leading features of the\r\nwork done by that corps in the Army of the Cumberland. To cross great\r\nrivers there was need of pontoon-bridges; to protect the long lines\r\nof railroads it was necessary to provide block-houses; to go through\r\na country that was often a trackless forest, and always badly provided\r\nwith real high-roads, it was all-important to have maps, and to\r\nreproduce them rapidly and plentifully. Colonel Merrill's chapter\r\nis pithy, pointed and to the purpose, showing how well our technical\r\ntroops did their share of work, and how large and important that share\r\nwas in securing the general result. The maps are also well done, and\r\ntherefore useful in enabling a reader to follow out the details of the\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_BOOKS RECEIVED._\r\n\r\n\r\nDissertations and Discussions; Political, Philosophical and\r\nHistorical.
